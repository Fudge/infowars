[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:50.000]  From the front lines, from the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:50.000 --> 00:59.000]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong and new world order.
[00:59.000 --> 01:11.000]  The new world order, the new world order, the new world order, the new world order.
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  We're not about to make that same mistake.
[01:15.000 --> 01:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, July 1st in the year 2022.
[01:32.000 --> 01:43.000]  And despite our enemy's best efforts, thanks to you and the good Lord above, we are still in attack formation.
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.000]  Staying in attack formation.
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.000]  Thank you so much for joining us. We are kicking some globalist ass.
[01:49.000 --> 01:56.000]  I took off yesterday to take care of a bunch of critical behind the scenes stuff, but I was working hard.
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  And I'm not ready to announce some of this news yet, but it's very important.
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  I should be able to tell you about it.
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.000]  Maybe today, probably sometime next week, but certainly some very, very good news and a fight for liberty.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  There was a big Supreme Court ruling.
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  I got to tell you, I don't put all my faith in the Supreme Court.
[02:13.000 --> 02:19.000]  And they've made a lot of bad rulings, but they have been made a bunch of good ones the last week, two weeks as you know.
[02:19.000 --> 02:30.000]  And they just made a big ruling saying you can't have the EPA just randomly make law and shut down all the power plants and the coal power plants in America.
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  We got rolling blackouts everywhere.
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  And you can't say carbon dioxide is a pollutant when it's not.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  Carbon dioxide is what planets breathe.
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  They try to confuse it with carbon monoxide that will kill plants or humans.
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  And so this is just massive news.
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000]  While they're busy announcing, I've got multiple clips today.
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  Saw multiple clips yesterday of White House officials saying, yeah, we're turning off the energy.
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  We're moving to solar.
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.000]  We're moving to wind.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  When they built windmills and solar for 20 years, it couldn't power everything.
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  It doesn't even work at those levels.
[03:06.000 --> 03:17.000]  So they're saying we are here to bankrupt the American people while China and India and everybody else don't make any cuts.
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000]  And now Russia was the third largest oil provider.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  Now they're the biggest oil provider.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  In many ways, Russia is doing better during this war.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  And it's all at our expense.
[03:26.000 --> 03:34.000]  So that is a huge, massive issue that ties in again with the Obama officials.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  That's not a Freudian slip.
[03:36.000 --> 03:48.000]  That's his third unelected term saying, yeah, we're going to bankrupt oil and gas and other fossil fuels.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  They're going to bankrupt you.
[03:50.000 --> 04:02.000]  And that ties in to this first clip we're going to play when we come back in the next segment where they have the White House spokesperson on national television
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  saying it's a liberal world order.
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.000]  And boy, has this quote really gotten people's attention in a big way.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  So we got a bunch of news on that front.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  The attack on our energy is central.
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  The attack on our bodies with the deadly shots and the bio weapons is central.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  The attack on the currencies is central.
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  The attack on the national sovereignty and borders is central.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  The attack on our spirit is critical.
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  It's absolutely A number one.
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  And we're going to be going over all of it on this special Friday edition.
[04:33.000 --> 04:43.000]  We're going to have open phones and so much more here today in foe wars.com tomorrow's news today.

[06:20.000 --> 06:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, July 1st on this special worldwide edition of the transmission.
[06:29.000 --> 06:35.000]  We have another just unbelievably powerful broadcast for you today.
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  A lot of super good positive news.
[06:39.000 --> 06:47.000]  Also a lot of really ugly, ugly, ugly, horrible news and some very dangerous news as well.
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.000]  And a lot of really hilarious stuff that will actually make you cry when you actually think deeper about it.
[06:52.000 --> 06:59.000]  We've got big Gisling Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein news that is just devastating to the globalist pedophile rings.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  We've got huge Ukraine news.
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  We've got so much here today.
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  We have Dr. Zev Zelenko dying yesterday.
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  I was working yesterday.
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  It was not a vacation day, but I had to take care of much stuff to keep him for us on the air.
[07:17.000 --> 07:25.000]  And I learned after Owen was already off air that he had died privately from folks that were working with him,
[07:25.000 --> 07:35.000]  that he would probably die last week and was extremely ill with cancer all over his body with one lung and with blood clots,
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  not just in his heart.
[07:37.000 --> 07:43.000]  And so when we play his final words from just three days ago where he says,
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  this is the hill to die on and his final words are just extremely powerful.
[07:47.000 --> 07:52.000]  It made me cry yesterday because he was such a loving, sweet, good person.
[07:52.000 --> 08:01.000]  And he was really one of the first doctors to come out against the New World Order over 27, 28 months ago and really nailed it.
[08:01.000 --> 08:09.000]  And we just had such a beautiful spirit and we know he is with us in eternity and he certainly understood that better than most of us.
[08:09.000 --> 08:16.000]  So a beautiful soul, a beautiful mind and a brother and people are just really, really touched by his passing.
[08:16.000 --> 08:22.000]  This is our hill to die on and his last words and these are his last words of the world.
[08:22.000 --> 08:28.000]  The last 30 seconds of what he says is just so calm and so focused and so true.
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  And this little six and a half minute clip we're going to play at the bottom of the hour is powerful.
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  It's at band.video and the Bill Gates is evil section and we had a lot of interviews with him.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  He was on the other shows as well.
[08:40.000 --> 08:48.000]  We put a compilation of some of those together that will be airing coming up in the third hour today.
[08:48.000 --> 08:57.000]  But I will bottom of this hour play his last statement after he'd already been in surgeries and was going to emergency surgery.
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  He was basically having a heart attack while he recorded this.
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  And when you realize that, that's tough guy.
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  You can actually see when he's talking, you see him kind of go, I mean he is literally fighting.
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.000]  His heart is absolutely out of control with the rhythm as you name it.
[09:14.000 --> 09:22.000]  While he is giving this final message and he does it so calmly and so focused, just real resilience.
[09:22.000 --> 09:29.000]  And powerful, ladies and gentlemen, that is coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  Brinks tears in my eyes right now because he was fighting so hard and he didn't want to die because he wanted to keep fighting.
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  But he knows he'll continue fighting through us.
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  And don't worry, Dr. Zalinko, we're going to up our game.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  I'm going to up my game.
[09:41.000 --> 09:51.000]  We're all going to up our game like he did traveling the country working 15, 16 hours a day until the last few days he died.
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  And that's the human spirit and that's what I admire.
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  I'll give a rat's ass about football players or movie stars, any of that crap.
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  But people that are trailblazers and buck the system, they're beautiful.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  They're examples to us all.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  And Joe Rogan made that point about Fauci and how evil he is.
[10:07.000 --> 10:14.000]  And people like Zalinko and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are true leaders leading us out of this tyranny.
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  That's coming up after the Zalinko clip as well, bottom of the hour segment.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  So stay with us for that.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  Okay.
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.000]  If I mentioned all the good things the Supreme Court's done the last two weeks, it would take up the whole segment.
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.000]  So I'm just going to remind you.
[10:29.000 --> 10:37.000]  They said you can't stop Christians from saying they're Christians or saying prayers at commencement speeches or football players saying prayers or coaches if they want to.
[10:37.000 --> 10:38.000]  That's their first amendment.
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000]  You just can't have state run religion telling people what religion you can be.
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  Government has no jurisdiction in your religious practices as long as they're not illegal.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  Sacrificing babies like the Satanists do.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  And they're not even arguing under the First Amendment.
[10:54.000 --> 10:57.000]  They should be able to do that in official court documents this year.
[10:57.000 --> 10:58.000]  Not kidding.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  I'm sure you heard about it was big news.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  So we had that.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  We had the Roe v. Wade that was massive.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  We had the Second Amendment saying these states and these cities can't just ban people owning guns that don't have criminal records.
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  You can't just bar them from even gun permits, even permits themselves are unconstitutional.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  Massive ruling was a bunch of other ones.
[11:17.000 --> 11:27.000]  But this ruling on energy if you just talk about the economy and the economic globalist reset war we're under is gigantor.
[11:27.000 --> 11:35.000]  And obviously it's going to override the FDA and the EPA and all these agencies that don't care about our health.
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  They don't care about the fentanyl.
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  They don't care about leaking nuclear reactors.
[11:39.000 --> 11:45.000]  They care about power and siege and the great reset and bringing us to our knees.
[11:45.000 --> 11:51.000]  And so I read the Supreme Court ruling last night and it's very clear, very cut and dried.
[11:51.000 --> 11:52.000]  True.
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.000]  Congress never passed laws banning carbon dioxide or water vapor out of smokestacks of clean burning coal plants.
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  They never ban natural gas.
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  They never ban the use of oil and fuel.
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  And you've got the Democrats saying under the UN global mandate they're banning it.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  So they said none of these regulations are constitutional.
[12:10.000 --> 12:17.000]  You can't make law via proclamation from a federal agency.
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  Congress has to be elected and then passed laws.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  It's got to be found constitutional by the court.
[12:22.000 --> 12:35.000]  But the EPA and the FDA and the EEOC and all these groups and the IRS are just imperiums, imperial courts under themselves that just do whatever the hell they want.
[12:35.000 --> 12:42.000]  And the special interests get their people into those agencies and they are the fourth branch of an elected deep state government.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  The bureaucracy is the true deep state.
[12:45.000 --> 12:52.000]  And so this ruling doesn't just overturn the shutdown of almost all the coal power plants.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  But see, how are they going to reopen now?
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  Took billions of dollars to build the bigger plants, hundreds of millions of smaller ones.
[12:59.000 --> 13:06.000]  It's kind of like a day late and a dollar short here, but it rolls back so much.
[13:06.000 --> 13:15.000]  And remember a year and a half ago, much of Texas was out power because the feds wouldn't let them output at the coal power plants.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  Only got like 15 plants left.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  They supply over half the state's power.
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  There's a gigantic plant outside Austin called the Fayetteville plant.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  Three gigantic plants.
[13:25.000 --> 13:34.000]  And Austin owned two of them and sold them for less than 10% of their value to shut them down.
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.000]  So taxpayers paid for these gigantic coal power plants. They're totally clean.
[13:39.000 --> 13:46.000]  And the Austin City Council, what a decade ago, ordered them shut down within five years.
[13:46.000 --> 13:47.000]  Both of them were shut down.
[13:47.000 --> 13:53.000]  There's one plant going overdrive that is supplying Austin more than half its power right now.
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  You go out there, it's going overdrive.
[13:55.000 --> 14:01.000]  And you notice what they call smoke coming out the top disappears after a few hundred feet because it's not smoke.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  It's steam.
[14:03.000 --> 14:09.000]  And in the summer, you see nothing coming out of it because it's 100 degrees and the stuff coming out of the furnace is 100 degrees.
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  And the smoke stack, you see nothing coming out.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  That's how clean they are.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  Now in the winter, they aim their cameras at them and you'll see this big steam cloud going for, you know, a half mile.
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  And they go, look at that pollution, my lord. It's so incredibly evil.
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  I think you guys just found the Fayetteville Clip.
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  Yeah, help the Fayetteville, Texas power plant complex.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  Two of the big plants are shut down. One is left going.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  And you can go out there and look at it for yourself.
[14:34.000 --> 14:40.000]  And all that's coming out of those stacks, ladies and gentlemen, is, yeah, that's not Fayetteville.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  That's a smaller facility. It's still big.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  That may be Fayetteville, actually.
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  The point is, is that all that's coming out of there is water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  But they aim cameras at it and tell you a bunch of toxic waste is coming out.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  Let me tell you where the toxic waste is coming out.
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  It's coming out China and Mexico.
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  You go down to the Texas border.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  There are huge coal power plants right across the border with black smoke coming out of them.
[15:00.000 --> 15:06.000]  That's dirty coal with full of mercury and toxins being ejected out of there that gets into the atmosphere and we breathe it.
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  So they shut down the clean plants and let China and Mexico and India run dirty ones.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  And then you wonder why they have cheaper electricity and why all the jobs move there.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  It's economic warfare. They're foot on our necks.
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  Part of the liberal world order.
[15:19.000 --> 15:25.000]  So I got a bunch of clips when we come back of the White House spokesman on CNN saying,
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  well, of course we've got higher gas prices.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  It's part of the new world order. It's liberal.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  We have a liberal agenda here.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  And we have the other officials in the Obama administration, the third Obama administration,
[15:35.000 --> 15:41.000]  known as the Biden administration, saying we're doing this to bankrupt, you know, gasoline cars.
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  And we're doing this for the liberal world order.
[15:43.000 --> 15:50.000]  And in Europe, they're banning tractor gasoline, tractor diesel, and they're all protesting.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  I mean, this is feudalism. This is a takeover.
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  We're going to talk about when we come back.
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.000]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  You might not agree with everything.
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.000]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  Thank you for that, Ward. Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  Infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks, and we do have the best supplements.
[16:29.000 --> 16:34.000]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.000]  we do the best with our supplements as well.
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.000]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula. Folks, this is a joke.
[16:42.000 --> 16:45.000]  I mean, we're giving this thing away. It's 75% off.
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  By the way, it works for me, in case you haven't noticed.
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[16:51.000 --> 16:57.000]  Quite well, I might add. Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  I go and see him quite often now.
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  There's an old bed of one saying that's thousands of years old, and it goes like this.
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.000]  Trust in God, but tie up your camel. Hunter S. Thompson put it this way.
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  Pray to God, but row away from the rocks. If your boat is going towards the rocks,
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  pray to God that you don't get smashed on him and killed, but also try to row away.
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  You can't just sit there like a jellyfish, and it's the same thing with our immune system.
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  God helps those who help themselves.

[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  It even tastes better than last formula, and what it does for your body is simply amazing.

[20:00.000 --> 20:22.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:22.000 --> 20:29.000]  They said that this could be a long war measured in years, and I think everybody understands why this is happening,
[20:29.000 --> 20:32.000]  but is it sustainable? What do you say to those families who say,
[20:32.000 --> 20:37.000]  listen, we can't afford to pay 4.85 a gallon for months if not years.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  This is just not sustainable.
[20:40.000 --> 20:44.000]  What we've heard from the president today was a clear articulation of the stakes.
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.000]  This is about the future of the liberal world order, and we have to stand firm.
[20:48.000 --> 20:58.000]  We have a club coming up, a Biden saying, Russia, Russia, Russia,
[20:58.000 --> 21:02.000]  copying Trump, he goes, it's Russia is the reason there's no food.
[21:02.000 --> 21:06.000]  It's Russia is the reason the gas prices are so high.
[21:07.000 --> 21:12.000]  That of course is White House spokesperson Brian Dees saying that.
[21:12.000 --> 21:22.000]  Meanwhile, Biden just announced a plan to shut down America's largest domestic oil field, land-based oil field.
[21:22.000 --> 21:27.000]  They're shutting down the baby formula plants, they're shutting down the major meat packing plants,
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  and the other ones are mysteriously burning up.
[21:29.000 --> 21:35.000]  I mean, have you figured out folks, we're under attack at every level.
[21:35.000 --> 21:40.000]  So what an incredible statement out of that guy.
[21:40.000 --> 21:45.000]  Being honest that, oh, it's a liberal world order and it's the war though.
[21:45.000 --> 21:49.000]  That's the reason things are never going to get better.
[21:49.000 --> 21:55.000]  But then all the other spokespersons say it's a transition off of fossil fuels,
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  but they're not even transitioning us on anything.
[21:58.000 --> 22:05.000]  And the little bit of systems, the batteries and the solar panels,
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.000]  and all of that is coming almost entirely from China,
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.000]  so it's a complete transference of our industrial power of what's left.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  All we had left was our high tech and our oil,
[22:17.000 --> 22:22.000]  and now they transferred the high tech, and now they're transferring the energy away,
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  and all these other countries are becoming energy leaders while we are destroyed.
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.000]  Notice it's only against Europe and the United States and Canada,
[22:31.000 --> 22:32.000]  Australia and New Zealand.
[22:32.000 --> 22:37.000]  It is the British Empire countries that are running this new world order
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.000]  because they control much of the third world countries where all the industry is being developed,
[22:41.000 --> 22:48.000]  and then they can further dominate the globe while impoverishing us for control.
[22:48.000 --> 22:52.000]  Here's Joe Biden, as I mentioned, continuing to blame everything on Vladimir Putin.
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  Here it is.
[22:54.000 --> 23:01.000]  Hold on a minute. The reason why gas prices are up is because of Russia.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  Russia, Russia, Russia.
[23:03.000 --> 23:08.000]  The reason why the food crisis exists is because of Russia.
[23:08.000 --> 23:12.000]  Russia not allowing grain to get out of Ukraine.
[23:12.000 --> 23:19.000]  Now here's just a clip of farmers in Belgium, farmers in France, farmers in Germany,
[23:19.000 --> 23:24.000]  farmers in the Netherlands blocking major highways because the EU announced
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  that they're not just going to let them pay extra taxes for their diesel or gasoline,
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  that they are forcing them to transition off of it,
[23:31.000 --> 23:36.000]  and are paying farmers a one-time sum to never farm again.
[23:36.000 --> 23:42.000]  That's the London Guardian, and you wonder why millions of people, millions,
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  are protesting and blocking roads.
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  They are literally being shut down.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  It's the same thing. It's not Russia.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  The farmers aren't blaming Russia. It's preposterous.
[23:56.000 --> 24:01.000]  And of course, Biden last week tried to blame gas stations for the price
[24:01.000 --> 24:09.000]  when everybody knows gas stations might make 20 cents a gallon on the freaking gas.
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.000]  Most stations lose money, but they use the gas to bring you in
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  to buy soft drinks, beer, cigarettes, lottery tickets.
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  I mean, this is just insane.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  But they think you're stupid. They think I'm stupid, but we're not.
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  We know it's you. We know it's a worldwide agenda.
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  Here's another clip. This is Gina McCarthy.
[24:34.000 --> 24:39.000]  This is one of the Obama Administration advisors for the Third Obama Administration.
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.000]  I'm just going to refer to it as the Obama Administration, the elected Third Obama Administration,
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  making a lot of comments on these subjects here at us.
[24:46.000 --> 24:52.000]  We have opportunities now to transfer to clean energy in a way that grows thousands of jobs.
[24:52.000 --> 24:59.000]  We just had a recent report that was put out that's showing all of the energy
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.000]  and the employment stats from last year. Clean energy is winning.
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  Fossil fuel is losing jobs. We're gaining them every step of the way.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  And so the challenge is now that we're moving from denial to actually just trying
[25:14.000 --> 25:21.000]  to disengage the public from understanding the values of solar energy,
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  the values of wind energy, the benefits of clean energy.
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  We have to get tighter. We have to get better at communicating.
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.000]  And frankly, the tech companies have to stop allowing specific individuals
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.000]  over and over again to spread disinformation.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  That's what the fossil fuel companies pay for.
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.000]  That's what folks who make money out of fossil fuels and don't make money
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  and don't care about saving consumers' costs.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  That's what they do. We have to be smarter than that.
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  And we need the tech companies to really jump in.
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.000]  That's directly from the White House.
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  And I could play another hundred clips of the different criminals up there saying that.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  So they have a name for what she just said.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  It's called a declaration of war against you and your family and your standard of living
[26:13.000 --> 26:19.000]  to drive you into the social credit score, universal basic income bankruptcy.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  That's their game plan. Make you dependent.
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  Take your right to defense away. Take the police away while they have armed guards.
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  Every level of it is a hypocritic fraud by this cult.
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  And it is our acquiescence and our ignorance that allows them to do this.
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.000]  Did you hear? Now we want to take your speech, not to say the vaccine isn't a vaccine,
[26:37.000 --> 26:43.000]  not to say hydroxychloroquine or other things work,
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.000]  not to just block treatment with vitamin C or ivermectin.
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  No, now we don't want you, they're saying this everywhere, to be able to question
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.000]  not just manmade global warming, but all the policies they have of banning meat
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  and having a phone with a carbon credit.
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.000]  In fact, everywhere you go, what you do, they're putting the ball and chain on.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  They're putting the handcuffs on.
[27:06.000 --> 27:12.000]  They're putting the chains on our bodies, on our economy, on us right now.
[27:12.000 --> 27:18.000]  So when they take your speech, they then take your energy, your mobility,
[27:18.000 --> 27:24.000]  your freedom, and finally your life, which is their goal, global collapse
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  and global depopulation.
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.000]  You will own nothing, you will have nothing, and you will like it.
[27:34.000 --> 27:42.000]  Think of the cult-like statements that this group is making.
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  And then we've got stacks of news like this.
[27:48.000 --> 27:54.000]  Toronto police caused confusion with posts about missing woman with goatee,
[27:54.000 --> 28:00.000]  and it looks like a crazy method schizophrenic with a full beard, not just a goatee,
[28:00.000 --> 28:06.000]  moustache, and they put that in your face and show you a man and say,
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  we're looking for a missing woman.
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  It's all about training you to just see absurdity everywhere, lies everywhere,
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  the murder of logic and common sense everywhere, where you're just going to a
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  catatonic state and roll over.
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  Guess what? I told you this was coming.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  Not just men competing in women's sports.
[28:22.000 --> 28:34.000]  Now men are identifying as children and winning in a competition 10 years old to 18,
[28:34.000 --> 28:40.000]  trans skateboarder defiant after beating child rivals.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  So I identify as a 10-year-old.
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.000]  I'm going to go join a Pee Wee baseball group for a Pop Warner football.
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  I'm going to play 10-year-olds, and I'm going to win.
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.000]  I'll be the greatest 10-year-old you ever saw.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  We've got a lot more coming up.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  Dr. Zev Selinko straight ahead, his final word.

[30:33.000 --> 30:40.000]  60% off, then the Trafecta immune support, 50% off on immune support, X2 and D3 gummies,

[31:10.000 --> 31:18.000]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare, and that alone is something to be grateful for.
[31:18.000 --> 31:25.000]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[31:25.000 --> 31:31.000]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.

[32:24.000 --> 32:30.000]  The Crill is hallucinogenic.
[32:30.000 --> 32:31.000]  It's so good.
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  It might be a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  I eat five caplets of Crill oil before I go to bed.
[32:36.000 --> 32:39.000]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[32:39.000 --> 32:45.000]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[32:45.000 --> 32:49.000]  So we don't make a big profit off of it,
[32:49.000 --> 32:53.000]  but you know what, I'm just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[32:53.000 --> 32:54.000]  I just can't do it.
[32:54.000 --> 33:20.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[33:20.000 --> 33:25.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide.
[33:25.000 --> 33:31.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:31.000 --> 33:37.000]  Well, I saw something extremely powerful yesterday afternoon after I learned that Dr. Zev Zelenko,
[33:37.000 --> 33:42.000]  just a wonderful fighter against medical tyranny and for human liberty,
[33:42.000 --> 33:47.000]  that I learned he had made a few days ago before he died.
[33:47.000 --> 33:52.000]  And it has his last public words on it and it's extremely powerful.
[33:52.000 --> 33:59.000]  We're going to be playing that coming up here in just a few minutes.
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.000]  But when you think about the magnitude of what we've been hit by
[34:04.000 --> 34:09.000]  and how the system is targeting Dr. Peter McCullough trying to take his license right now
[34:09.000 --> 34:16.000]  because he's become very prominent and well-spoken here and on Joe Rogan and Fox News and so many places,
[34:16.000 --> 34:17.000]  it's criminal.
[34:17.000 --> 34:25.000]  And it shows that they've got to silence leaders who are willing to stand up to their tyranny
[34:25.000 --> 34:33.000]  so that other leaders who are thinking about standing up think there's no hope and roll over to the tyranny.
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.000]  There is nothing but hope and assured victory if we have courage and get rid of the fear
[34:38.000 --> 34:47.000]  and take action and do the right thing like Dr. Zelenko did very early on and prominently.
[34:47.000 --> 34:56.000]  What you should all be concerned about is people being cowards and being intimidated by this intimidation and rolling over.
[34:56.000 --> 35:02.000]  Next segment I'm going to play a very powerful clip of Joe Rogan making just these points,
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.000]  but first I'm going to go to the Dr. Zelenko clip here in just a moment.
[35:07.000 --> 35:13.000]  But let me read to you the last 30 seconds of what he had to say and then we're going to play the clip
[35:13.000 --> 35:21.000]  in full his last public words about Dr. Zelenko right here on air today.
[35:21.000 --> 35:30.000]  The world has now chosen sides, those that will worship the machinations of man and those that will bow down to the Creator.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  So let the culling begin.
[35:32.000 --> 35:40.000]  The world needs a cleaning and when the process is done the world will be filled with the knowledge of God just like the waters cover the seas.
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.000]  The sociopaths have a big thing coming for them.
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  They think they are gods, they think they are ruling the world.
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.000]  We'll see. Let the games begin.
[35:50.000 --> 35:56.000]  I have no problem falling in battle because this is a hill we need to die on.
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.000]  Otherwise our progeny will have nowhere to breathe free.
[36:01.000 --> 36:09.000]  And that is his final public words.
[36:09.000 --> 36:16.000]  Otherwise our progeny, our children and their children, our future will have nowhere to breathe free.
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  This clips on Band-Aid video. I hope you share it. We love you.
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.000]  Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, you're a great patriot and you will live on forever.
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  We know we'll see you on the other side.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  Here is Dr. Zelenko's final words.
[36:29.000 --> 36:34.000]  If I have to leave the world, I accept God's will.
[36:34.000 --> 36:49.000]  But I encourage and plead with everyone else to up your game and stand up and resist.
[36:49.000 --> 36:55.000]  Hi, this is Dr. Zelenko and I'm making this video from my hospital bed.
[36:55.000 --> 37:01.000]  I just want to give a quick update. Many, many people have expressed their love and prayers.
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.000]  And I'm very grateful. Thank you.
[37:06.000 --> 37:15.000]  Unfortunately, I had an MRI and a trans esophageal echocardiogram called a TE.
[37:15.000 --> 37:25.000]  I found a tumor in my right ventricle. That's the lower right chamber of the heart.
[37:25.000 --> 37:31.000]  And on top of that tumor is a blood clot.
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  That's not pretty good news. It's not good news.
[37:35.000 --> 37:43.000]  And the treatment would be to go and blood thinner, which I'm on, to try to dissolve the clot.
[37:43.000 --> 37:48.000]  And then we have to figure out what to do with that tumor.
[37:48.000 --> 37:56.000]  To be frank, if that clot breaks off, that's a ticket to the next world.
[37:56.000 --> 38:03.000]  Also, there are more tumors around my lower left lobe and my lung.
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.000]  So I'm in a precarious situation.
[38:08.000 --> 38:14.000]  However, as King David writes, even though I walk in the shadow of death,
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  I shall fear no evil, for God is with me.
[38:17.000 --> 38:24.000]  And I do really feel that way and those words resonate in my soul more now than ever in my life.
[38:24.000 --> 38:32.000]  And there is a tell, mutic teaching that even if the sword is on your neck, a person should never give up hope.
[38:32.000 --> 38:39.000]  And so I'm in a very good state of mind. And as I frequently said,
[38:39.000 --> 38:54.000]  they're going to have to carry my body off the battlefield because my resolve to help humanity, the vulnerable, the innocent,
[38:54.000 --> 39:03.000]  the decent people, overcome this terrible darkness and plague that is upon us, has never been stronger.
[39:03.000 --> 39:08.000]  And if I have to leave the world, I accept God's will.
[39:08.000 --> 39:21.000]  But I encourage and plead with everyone else to up your game and stand up and resist first within yourselves
[39:21.000 --> 39:29.000]  against giving into fear and then resist publicly against the policies of tyranny which are coming again.
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  Because it's pretty obvious what's going to happen right now.
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.000]  The World Health Organization, which is essentially funded by the sociopath Gates,
[39:40.000 --> 39:46.000]  is gaining more and more power over sovereign nations.
[39:46.000 --> 39:53.000]  Gates messaged, I think five or six months ago, that smallpox is a big threat.
[39:53.000 --> 40:02.000]  And then supposedly it was eradicated in 1980 and it was only found in two labs in America and in Russia,
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.000]  in DSL level four labs, the highest maximum security labs.
[40:07.000 --> 40:15.000]  And yet five days after the sociopath criminal Gates said his prophetic words,
[40:15.000 --> 40:26.000]  a few vials of smallpox were found in an unsecure refrigerator in a Merck laboratory in Philadelphia.
[40:26.000 --> 40:31.000]  And so it's not surprising to me now that we're seeing monkeypox.
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  I anticipate global panic about it.
[40:35.000 --> 40:46.000]  This will be the next media horror narrative that will continue the fear campaign and lockdown campaign
[40:46.000 --> 40:53.000]  and mass campaign to create anxiety, isolate you from people you love,
[40:53.000 --> 40:59.000]  and dehumanize you with these face diapers.
[40:59.000 --> 41:05.000]  And so this is their playbook.
[41:05.000 --> 41:15.000]  And they're going to keep on sending wave after wave of their evil agenda
[41:15.000 --> 41:22.000]  until we make internal resolutions to kick the evil out from within us.
[41:22.000 --> 41:31.000]  We should, in my opinion, denounce the worship of false gods,
[41:31.000 --> 41:39.000]  the god of technology, the god of science, the god of corrupt governments, money, power, fame,
[41:39.000 --> 41:48.000]  and reconcile our hearts with our Creator who's making us anew every instant in time.
[41:48.000 --> 41:57.000]  Basically, the world has now chosen sides, those that will worship the machinations of men
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.000]  and those that will bow down to the Creator.
[42:01.000 --> 42:10.000]  And so let the calling begin.
[42:10.000 --> 42:16.000]  You know, the world needs a cleaning.
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  And when the process is done, the world will be filled with knowledge of God,
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  just like the waters cover the seas.
[42:24.000 --> 42:29.000]  And the sociopaths have a big thing coming for them.
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.000]  They think they're gods, they think that they're ruling the world.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  We'll see.
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  So let the games begin.
[42:39.000 --> 42:46.000]  And I have no problem falling in battle because this is a hill that we need to die for
[42:46.000 --> 43:13.000]  because otherwise our progeny will have nowhere to breathe free.
[43:17.000 --> 43:26.000]  So let the games begin.
[43:26.000 --> 43:36.000]  So let the games begin.
[43:36.000 --> 44:00.000]  So let the games begin.
[44:00.000 --> 44:08.000]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control,
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.000]  the asleep France that the general public is in,
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.000]  the best word would actually be the people are lost.
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.000]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare,
[44:21.000 --> 44:30.000]  you're in horror and get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused.
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  You have a concussion.
[44:32.000 --> 44:33.000]  And that's what the globalists have done.
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  They have stunned us.
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.000]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech called The Great New Narrative
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.000]  where he brags how the public is lost, how the culture in the media has been driven
[44:47.000 --> 44:52.000]  to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  That's what the Great Reset is.
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  They need darkness to thrive.
[44:56.000 --> 45:00.000]  The light lives at infowars.com.
[45:00.000 --> 45:05.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[45:05.000 --> 45:08.000]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food.
[45:08.000 --> 45:09.000]  It's all come out.
[45:09.000 --> 45:14.000]  And they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of God, the creator,
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.000]  and we are powerful.
[45:17.000 --> 45:20.000]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[45:20.000 --> 45:27.000]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy, is it true?
[45:27.000 --> 45:33.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[45:33.000 --> 45:38.000]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death
[45:38.000 --> 45:46.000]  because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser.
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.000]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep infowars in the air now more than ever
[45:50.000 --> 45:56.000]  because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe and secure.
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[46:00.000 --> 46:06.000]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.000]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  You might not agree with everything.
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.000]  You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.000]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  Infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks, and we do have the best supplements.
[46:29.000 --> 46:34.000]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  we do the best with our supplements as well.
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  Folks, this is a joke.
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[46:44.000 --> 46:45.000]  It's 75% off.
[46:45.000 --> 46:46.000]  By the way, it works for me.
[46:46.000 --> 46:51.000]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  Quite well, I might add.
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.000]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.000]  I go and see him quite often now.
[47:00.000 --> 47:10.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:10.000 --> 47:16.000]  All the waiting's over.
[47:16.000 --> 47:20.000]  We tried to stop it, but the Bible said it would be fulfilled so it will.
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.000]  You can't say that I still didn't try to fight it to stop it.
[47:23.000 --> 47:25.000]  God says we're supposed to do that.
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.000]  Will we overcome in the first major battle?
[47:29.000 --> 47:36.000]  That's the battle we're entering, but the biggest revival and awakening and the biggest victory ever will come after it.
[47:36.000 --> 47:46.000]  Satan wins some battles, but Satan knows he's already lost the war.
[47:46.000 --> 47:53.000]  All we've got to do in this boot camp, it's this life, is prove we've got the medal it takes to get taken to the next level.
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  And believe me, believe me, you want to be there.
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  I want to be there.
[47:59.000 --> 48:06.000]  It's private, I don't get into it, but if you think the things I've covered here are next level, you have not seen anything yet.
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  And I know a lot of you probably have seen what I've seen.
[48:09.000 --> 48:15.000]  King David talks about the quiet place, the most high, others talk about the third heaven.
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  You see the heavens, that's just in this dimension.
[48:17.000 --> 48:23.000]  There's the third heaven, and it's very, very real, my friends, and you want to see it.
[48:23.000 --> 48:31.000]  Now, let's talk about something really important.
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  I think as listeners and viewers, you care about this broadcast, that's why you're here.
[48:35.000 --> 48:49.000]  And I have become such a servant of truth that when I was pulled over a year and a half ago and it had a half bottle of sake by my house,
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  and the police said, have you been drinking?
[48:53.000 --> 49:01.000]  Even though I knew I'd get arrested, I had not told a lie, because I'd lied to some of my parents and lied to girlfriends and stuff like that.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  I didn't like to lie, I was not what you call a liar, I'm a very faithful guy.
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.000]  I make a deal with you, I'm going to really try to fulfill it, and if I can't, I'll try to make amends.
[49:09.000 --> 49:18.000]  But I mean, I'm like Tony Montana, I got two things in this world, and that's my word and my balls, and I don't break them for anybody.
[49:18.000 --> 49:23.000]  Some would call it neurotic, but I don't think it's neurotic.
[49:23.000 --> 49:30.000]  If I lied to those police, and I get in the military being a spy, you're supposed to lie in the Bible, you can lie if you're fighting an enemy.
[49:30.000 --> 49:41.000]  I just said, you know, yeah, I had a couple glasses of wine, I'm below the alcohol level, but that's what happened.
[49:41.000 --> 49:48.000]  And then I got a Achilles that's gone, I never had the surgery, they wanted me to walk on this and do all that, and they decided to pass that test.
[49:48.000 --> 49:55.000]  So they took me to jail, and I was there 15 minutes later, and I blew under the alcohol level, like I told them.
[49:55.000 --> 49:59.000]  Yeah, I was at a Japanese restaurant, had two glasses of sake.
[49:59.000 --> 50:04.000]  Well, I guess they quibbled on two glasses, but I had like five little cups of it.
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  Had zero buzz, you know, zero buzz.
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.000]  And I liked to drink, I've been drunk plenty, but not while I'm behind a wheel of a car.
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  That's going on, somebody's going to drive me.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  And they took me to jail.
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  And people said, why didn't you lie?
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  I tried when he was asking me to lie, I was like, no, I hadn't, I said, yeah, I've been drinking.
[50:22.000 --> 50:33.000]  And it wasn't because I was weak, I did that, because I was strong, because I've gotten to the point where I've learned how the universe works.
[50:33.000 --> 50:42.000]  And when you don't lie, your brain is trained to not make calculations of all the lies you've told, which uses up brain space, computing power.
[50:42.000 --> 50:49.000]  When you train your brain to just be truthful, then it fires directly and it's more powerful.
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  So see, it's a greediness that I don't lie.
[50:52.000 --> 51:03.000]  Being arrested and spending the night in jail was nothing compared to lying.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  So I'm not perfect.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  And I don't claim to be.
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  And I sure have a lot of bad thoughts.
[51:09.000 --> 51:19.000]  When the rubber meets the road, I've learned the secrets of the universe and not lying ever is powerful.
[51:19.000 --> 51:30.000]  And that's why when I'm in these depositions, and there's such liars in the Democratic Party running these things, I've been in seven depositions,
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  give them all our documents and all their fake suits, and they default to the saying we gave them nothing.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  They're liars, I'm not.
[51:36.000 --> 51:44.000]  They get on there and they go, you got tens of millions of dollars, you're not close to being bankrupt.
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  You don't need all this money.
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  You don't need all this stuff.
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  You just got an eight million dollar Bitcoin donation.
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  You lied on air and they played a clip.
[51:53.000 --> 51:57.000]  This is just last Tuesday in another deposition of the court orders.
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  Total abuse.
[51:59.000 --> 52:04.000]  And I'm sitting there knowing we already spent all the money on back bills and stuff and that's not my money.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  I go, no, I don't have two million dollars in my bank accounts.
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  I don't have a million dollars in my bank accounts right now.
[52:10.000 --> 52:13.000]  That's not even that much money with the bills I've got.
[52:13.000 --> 52:19.000]  So it's just so good to not be them because their whole world's trying to keep track of all their lies
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  and you notice they've gotten exhausted.
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  They don't even try to keep track now.
[52:23.000 --> 52:29.000]  They say there's no world government, but then they announce world government on the same program.
[52:29.000 --> 52:33.000]  Or they say there's no inflation, then they blame Putin for it.
[52:33.000 --> 52:40.000]  So my mind's a computer and lies are viruses.
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  So my wife says, well, you really liked that woman we were just talking to.
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  But she really thinks, yeah, I think she's gorgeous.
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  Yeah, but I'm with you and I think you're great too.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  But yeah, I think she's really amazing.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  Yeah, I was lusting after that woman.
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.000]  Said it's just lying about, oh, no, I don't like how that woman looks.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  Yeah, the woman's incredibly gorgeous.
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  Yeah, God made her.
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  And that means you're truthful with yourself when you're wrong.
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  It means you're truthful with your family.
[53:03.000 --> 53:09.000]  It means you start shooting people straight instead of lying.
[53:09.000 --> 53:23.000]  So when I tell you that we will shut down and that even these giant donations we got that were literally right on time turned out to be exactly what we needed just to continue on.
[53:23.000 --> 53:28.000]  When I tell you that I could sell everything I've got.
[53:28.000 --> 53:36.000]  If we get in the hole, which I will do and run this place for a month, that's the truth.
[53:36.000 --> 53:42.000]  I don't like tempting God, but people like to say and I'll say it on my children and on my soul.
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  I'm not lying to you and I can say that straight.
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  That's an oath to you.
[53:46.000 --> 53:49.000]  I need your money for this war.
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  We have come so far.
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  No one, thanks to God, has delivered like we have.
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  That means you, the listeners, the guests, the crew.
[53:56.000 --> 53:59.000]  This is a team effort here.
[53:59.000 --> 54:05.000]  This team has ticked New World Order ass up and down the field like nobody else.
[54:05.000 --> 54:10.000]  I don't say that boastingly because it makes us the big enemy.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  But I'm in this fight.
[54:12.000 --> 54:13.000]  I'm not backing down.
[54:13.000 --> 54:18.000]  I'm not holding back 1%.
[54:18.000 --> 54:23.000]  But I can tell you, I'll never give up.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  I'll never sell out, but I could give out.
[54:25.000 --> 54:30.000]  And there's nothing that makes me more angry than them being so close to shutting us down.
[54:30.000 --> 54:44.000]  It makes me have nightmares, it pisses me off so much that I grind my teeth.
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  All I want to do is speak to these people.
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  They're on my back.
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.000]  They're on your back.
[54:48.000 --> 54:49.000]  I've got children.
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  You've got children.
[54:50.000 --> 54:51.000]  I have empathy.
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  I see stuff happen to somebody.
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  I feel it myself.
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  I don't know how these Satanists operate having no feelings.
[54:57.000 --> 55:00.000]  They're just idiots.
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  But I have feelings and that's my strength.
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  And you are my strength and I am your strength.
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  And so, I need your support.
[55:07.000 --> 55:08.000]  I need your funds.
[55:08.000 --> 55:14.000]  I need you to understand that we are the tip of the spear in this war and to be all in.
[55:14.000 --> 55:19.000]  I need you to take advantage of the Shilai Force Special where we're selling products.
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.000]  He'll be able to operate for 40 to 75% off of double-paid trade points.
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.000]  Plus, there are amazing products you need.
[55:27.000 --> 55:30.000]  Do you know what the adventure is like?
[55:30.000 --> 55:35.000]  When you get an Alex Jones's right, either regular shirt or the designer's shirt, it's a fundraiser.
[55:35.000 --> 55:40.000]  And who you'll meet and who you'll know and what will happen to you when you wear that shirt.
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  You talk about joining an adventure.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  You talk about joining the military.
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  You talk about experiencing what it's like to be Alex Jones.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  Wear that shirt and find out.
[55:48.000 --> 55:55.000]  The love you'll get will be 90% but the hate you'll get will be nightmarish.
[55:55.000 --> 55:56.000]  Experience it.
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  Get an Alex Jones's right shirt at MFullWarsFor.com.
[55:59.000 --> 56:04.000]  We have the July 4th Super Sale running right now through next Friday.
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.000]  And this is definitely, we escalate the sales to the year, the biggest sale ever.
[56:09.000 --> 56:16.000]  40% off and double-paid trade points on knockout sleep support, alpha power, living defense plus, whole food multi-vitamin,
[56:16.000 --> 56:22.000]  pollen block, survival shield X2, all Dr. Jones naturals, including the coral toothpaste,
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  the activated charcoal toothpaste, the top brain, the rocket rest and more.

[56:46.000 --> 56:52.000]  And finally, a massive 75% off on the hair and beard formula, which I'm going to explain.
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.000]  That's my idea.
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.000]  I said, men like hair and beard formulas make that.
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.000]  All it is is a super strong vitamin mineral, good for men and women.
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.000]  And for some reason, nobody buys it, nobody wants it, even though it's just as good,
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  maybe even better than the other whole food multi-vitamin we came out with.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  That's another manufacturer.
[57:10.000 --> 57:11.000]  Probably even better.
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.000]  I'm not going to get the other one.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  That is 75% off.
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  We're losing money on that, but I got to get the money in to operate.
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  Hair and beard support is a multi-vitamin mineral for everybody.
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  Children, adults, men, women, you name it, infowarstore.com.
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  And don't forget, high-quality, durable food, ready to ship.
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  Everybody needs at preparetoday.com.
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.000]  And we get the support from that as well, preparetoday.com.
[57:34.000 --> 57:39.000]  Okay, I got all the stuff I mentioned, your phone calls next hour, the Joe Rogan clip
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  on what's happening with the medical tyranny and so much more.
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[57:43.000 --> 57:44.000]  God bless you.
[57:44.000 --> 58:13.000]  We'll be right back.
[58:14.000 --> 58:40.000]  We'll be right back.
[58:40.000 --> 59:06.000]  We'll be right back.
[59:06.000 --> 59:34.000]  We'll be right back.
[59:34.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  China has recently invited Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran, Egypt,
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  and several other countries to join BRICS,
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  a growing world alliance led by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  While some are reporting that BRICS is somehow challenging the globalists,
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  this is demonstrably false.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  The original concept for BRICS was proposed by the chief economist for Goldman Sachs.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  BRICS's new development bank is staffed by known players of the IMF and World Bank.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  And BRICS has repeatedly affirmed their commitment to the United Nations Agenda 2030.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  Aside from Brazil's President Bolsonaro, all of BRICS nation states have pushed the COVID-19 lockdowns
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  and experimental shots.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  And China recently announced five more years of their brutal zero COVID lockdowns.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  BRICS is also pushing a digital currency and has launched a vaccine research and development center for member states.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  BRICS is clearly not anti-globalist.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Even the CCP's state-run media explains how BRICS now leads the globalization mission.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  But they are all turning against the United States and its allies.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  Xi Jinping accused the US of weaponizing the financial system with their sanctions against Russia,
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  which has caused the average person to suffer worldwide.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  And Vladimir Putin suggested that BRICS could provide a new world reserve currency.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  At the recent St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin blamed the West for disrupting the international economy
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  and announced that NATO's unipolar world order is over.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  In just three months, Russia has managed to reverse inflation and has increased their financial surplus to more than four times it was last year.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  Russia is now thriving and Putin announced that their international priority is to increase food deliveries to countries that need it the most.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  They are pouring billions into their farming communities, raised the minimum wage by 10% and provided more money to pensioners and families with children.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  He also criticized the West for choosing an economic suicidal path and having suicidal intentions,
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  which seems to be the only explanation for what the Biden administration is doing.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  They have deliberately cut off our fuel, which will cut off our food, and they are pushing the deadly shots for every single healthy child in America.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  They have opened our borders and are pushing for a world war with a thriving nuclear power while destroying our military from within.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  The Biden administration's plan is clear. Destroy America from within.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  And they have amassed an army of the miserable through mass psychosis.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  An army of ugly, insane, sexually obsessed deviants who want abortion on demand and acceptance for pedophiles.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  Psychotics who castrate their own children because it's trendy and mindless drones who believe the human race needs to die.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  At what point will Americans begin to care enough to work together and do something when the nuclear bombs start falling?
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  America is being mass murdered by our own federal government and the emerging new globalized economy will let it happen.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Unless Americans take back control of their own government, America will soon end.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  That's the plan being executed right now.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  For Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  These are all amazing products at great prices at InfowarsShore.com.

[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  And don't forget, Alex Jones' right T-shirt while you're there.
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  Well, Dr. Vladimir Zelinko was already a well-known prominent doctor serving thousands of patients in upstate New York, a orthodox tube.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  And I saw him in February and March of 2020, 30 months ago, come right out against the New World Order and be fearless and have a huge effect on Trump and other leaders
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  on the therapies and treatments that saved millions of lives here and millions of lives around the world.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  And I didn't know he'd already had cancer and heart surgery a bunch.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  I didn't know he'd almost died already.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  And I saw him travel all over the country and do endless interviews.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  He said the hill to die on because he knew he was killing himself.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  And I just saw the huge effect and then interviewing him personally, he was so smart about the population in the New World Order and the Rothschilds and Rockefellers.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  And he called out all sections of the New World Order.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  And I just really, at a spiritual discernment level, saw the fruits of what he did, but also spiritually knew how great he was and how he loved Christians
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  and how he loved Jesus and how he really understood the 35,000-foot view.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  He was a real teacher.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  And when I learned he died yesterday, I had to take off to work here and deal with accounting and trying to get products in the future.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  Because if we don't get product in the next few months to sell, we're screwed.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  I'm not going to just sit here and beg you for donations all day to stay on air.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  Or I guess I will if I have to, but that's hard for everybody.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  So when he died, it was upsetting, but it was also a life really fulfilled and that was powerful.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  And you see other examples of Dr. Zelinko in Tucker Carlson and in Joe Rogan and in Dr. McCullough and Merkola
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  and in countless other great people we've had on this show who have gone up against a system that tries to put them in prison,
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  that tries to take their licenses, that sues them.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  They're trying to take Dr. Peter McCullough's license, Scott and White Baylor suing him.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  He's a prominent FDA scientist that's done major trials, a prominent cardiologist.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  He's testifying to legislatures and they're trying to destroy him.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  So that's an honor and let me tell you something.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  I am so honored to know people like Dr. McCullough and Dr. McCullough and the Joe Rogan's the world.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  Because I've known Joe 24 years.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  I've known him really good for 20.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  I mean, we've had a lot of fun.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  And Joe was just so optimistic over the years, such a nice person, that he couldn't believe the system was this evil.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  Because if he was already successful and rich and powerful like Joe's been, a big TV star and everything since the mid-90s,
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  big network TV shows, you name it, he's like, if you have hundreds of millions of dollars and a beautiful family in America is great.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  Why would you want to screw people over?
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  Why would you want to cut people's power off? Why would you want to destroy the borders?
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  Why would you want to ship into fentanyl? Why would you want to give people poisonous shots?
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  And finally, before Joe moved to Austin about two years ago, I'm not going into private conversations,
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  but he said, my God, he said it on air, it's all like this, Alex, you were right.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  You were dead on. I can't believe they're this bad.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  And he told me like a year ago, more than a year ago, he said, once your view of this shifts and you get that they're out to get us,
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  then everything makes sense. And so the journey that Joe Rogan has gone through, the journey that Tucker Carlson,
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  he told me the same thing face to face, the journey that Dr. Zelinko went through.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  He's been a big liberal 20 years ago. The journey that they've gone through is all of our journeys.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  And if we understand that journey, we'll know how to reach out to others that aren't totally giving over to evil,
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  who really are deceived and believe they're on the good guy team. Take DeSantis.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  He's not perfect in his background, but he's gotten better and better.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  And he's doing things I can tell you, you don't do if you're part of the New World Order.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  And so the best part of my job is that I've gotten to meet the men and the women.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  Black, brown, white, everybody who loves liberty and truth.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  And it has been a beautiful, beautiful experience and a great honor.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  And it really is the journey being the destination. Life is this big test.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  And it makes you really feel sorry for the people that have made the wrong decision.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  Let's play these back-to-back. Here's Joe Rogan saying the way they've disparaged legitimate scientists and legitimate doctors
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  that were not lockstep in agreement with them when the scissors have been proven to be alive is effing shameful.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  It's not scientific, it's political. And then DeSantis making statements about these shots don't help children.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  This is revolutionary, because that's an infowars audience of activists on the field in the arena.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  You're like, hey, tell us something we don't know, but remember to have a DeSantis, to have a Joe Rogan,
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  to have a Zelenko, to have a Mercola-Makala, to have all these people getting their seismic.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  A Robert Kennedy Jr. We're winning, the globalists are losing.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  But in that lies the danger, because as they know they're losing, they're going to pull out every stop.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  Here's the clips.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  From Peter Datzik and Anthony Fauci and all these people that were involved in the funding of this research.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  Just the way they were framing it and the way they were disparaging legitimate scientists and legitimate doctors
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  that were not lockstep in agreement with them, it's effing shameful. It's not scientific.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  It's political. Not only that, this should be a thing, like Rand Paul is the only one who calls him out on it.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  And he does it on a regular basis, and he's 100% correct in the things that he's saying about the funding of this particular type of research.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  Because when you see Fauci say that it's not gain of function research, but that's not true, because the NIH says it's gain of function research.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  They all say it now, because they want to protect their own ass.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  This is a rumor online, and I'm going to ask you a bunch of things.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  Okay, so is Dr. Fauci's wife on the NIH, isn't she like one of the heads? Is that some sort of thing?
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  Well, let's find out. She does something. She has some function.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  And he used to be the head of the NIH during that whole AIDS thing, which we're not making any comparisons to if you make any comparisons to him.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  She's the head of the Department of Bioethics. It's a National Institute of Health Clinical Center. Yes, there it is.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  Do you think maybe this is...
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  Well, it's all crazy, because these people have massive amounts of power to decide who gets funded, what labs get funded, and no one wants to step out of line.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  There's a crazy book that I'm in the middle of that's a very controversial book.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  And it was one of those books, I'm like, God, do I want to get into this? Robert Kennedy Jr.'s book, The Real Anthony Fauci.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  Holy f***.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  Yeah.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  There's some stuff in that that is 100% verifiable truth, and it's crazy.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  Our Department of Health has been very clear the risks outweigh the benefits, and we recommend against.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  That's not the same as banning it. I mean, people can access it if they want to, and parents can do.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  But if you look at when they were doing the hearing, you had one physician say, you know, parents are really, really frightened.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  Like, we know that the risk is low. We're not sure how this is going to work, but we parents are really frightened about COVID for their kids.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  And which I would say is, why would they be frightened about it? It's because of media hysteria. It's because of a lot of misinformation.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  That's why they're scared. But to do an emergency use for a six-month-old or a one-year-old simply to placate anxiety, that's not the standard when you're doing this.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  The standard is, is this something that's safe and effective, and then, very importantly, for recommendations, does the benefit outweigh the risk?
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  But it's not about placating fear. It's about getting federal immunity when you start injecting children.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  It's about destroying their immune systems and taking over their lives.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  All right. I've got a bunch of economic news and a bunch of military news I want to hit, and a lot of transgender, post-humanist, new order news.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  But I also want to give the number out and take your calls.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  So that's coming up. I'll give the number out next segment. Stay with us.

[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  Get them separate, get them together, massively discounted at infowarscore.com.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  But everyone needs to have 2,000 mules in their library so the globalists can't censor it.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  infowarscore.com to get 2,000 mules today.
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view, 2,000 mules, is now available on DVD with expanded extras at infowarscore.com.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  You can also get the powerful film with other documentaries discounted at infowarscore.com.

[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  We have the tools to bring these criminals to justice.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  If you get around the same scams again, this film can stop them if you take action.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  infowarscore.com for 2,000 mules.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  It's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-904-285.
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  To be an American where it means I know I'm free and I won't forget the men who died who gave that bite to me
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  and I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land, God bless the USA.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  And I'm proud of being an American where it means I know I'm free and I won't forget the men who died who gave that bite to me
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  And if all the things that happened a month ago, he refused to go where he was already paid to go, the NRA conference in Houston
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  and ran like a coward because he thought that was a good move for him personally.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  And it's cowards like that, it's cowardice acts like that that will destroy us.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  But it's people standing up and doing the right thing when they know it's the right thing, they're going to save us.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones, I intend to open the phones up and take your calls here today.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  Into the next hour, we'll also be playing some powerful Dr. Zebs and Linko clips.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  He went over to meet the next level with God.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  That is all coming up.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  In fact, I'll be taking your phone calls for first time callers on Dr. Zebs and Linko on the Supreme Court ruling that they can't just make law at the federal agencies to ban carbon dioxide and water vapor
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  and cut off US energy, how huge that is on the other big announcements coming out of the Supreme Court as well.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  A lot of topics I want to get into, but I hope you'll call in about these specific topics with us here today because they are so incredibly important.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  We're also going to be laying out the whole transgender revolution and what that's really about.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  I want to be a trillion percent clear here.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  I don't hate the people deceived by this and sucked into this and who get sterilized by this. They're the victims.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  I am exposing what this agenda is opening up and what its in game is.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  And I'll talk about that some at the start of the next segment with a big stack of news I have here and then go to your phone calls.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  But what do you make? This is the big question I wanted for callers.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  I was driving to the office this morning and I said, I want to take calls today. I haven't even canceled some of the guests we have, which I did,
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  because I want to have time for calls into memorialized Dr. Zelinko.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  And I said, what's the big question I want to ask?
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  And that's basically the question.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  So we're going to be discussing all of that here today on air.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  How do we override this tyranny? How do we defeat it together?
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  How do we trigger other people to awaken to the fact that this is a globalist war to cut off our energy,
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  destroy our borders, to destroy our infrastructure, to steal our sovereignty, to put us on this liberal new world order?
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  And so driving in the big question wise, what do you make of the White House spokesperson saying,
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  we'll play the clip next segment, hell, we'll play it going out to break, that this is a liberal world order?
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  What do you make of it being out in the open?
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  What do you make of them with one hand saying world government, global government, chips to buy and sell, cell phones to buy and sell,
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  world social credit scores, carbon taxes, guaranteed universal incomes,
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  the family pedophilia legalized, no more nation states, what do you make of this agenda where you have nothing and you own nothing?
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  And they've declared war on you and your family.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  They've declared war on your very existence.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  They said you're not essential.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  Don't you understand that everything else is window dressing, everything else is rearranging deck chairs and polishing silverware
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  and playing the violin on the deck of the sinking Titanic.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  We've got to let people know it's a corporate world government anti-human takeover that is antithetical to everything we do
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  and to prosperity and to society.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  It is a corporate anti-human takeover of the very biological processes that it is to be human.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  What do you want to say about the declaration of war against humanity?
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  And what do you think the resistance should be to that?
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  That's another one of the big questions.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  So the toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  Alex, 877-789-2539, first time callers, that's a giant ocean of questions.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  But how do we get people to wake up that a declaration of war has been made against them and their families
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  and these globalists are running around like this White House spokesperson, Brian Dees.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  Hey, what about the power prices? What about the oil prices? What about the electricity prices?
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  What about the inflation? Well, it's a liberal world order and it's all Russia's fault.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  I thought the new world order didn't exist. I thought we were making it all up.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  So we're in this paradox where they're admitting world government, they're attacking us for our own good,
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  but it's Putin's fault and it's our fault.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  We go out to break with that 44-second clip here in just a moment, but that's the question we're raising.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  877-789-2539, 877-789. Alex.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  And then I'll take calls for an hour for the bottom of the next hour, an hour and 25 minutes from now.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  And I'm going to end the show with some amazing excerpts of Dr. Zelenko, Zev Zelenko on the broadcast.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  Dr. Vladimir Zev Zelenko and what he stood for.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  Because he stood for being a trailblazer and a maverick and going against the system and standing up for humanity.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  And he's asked us, in his final words, to up our game, to not back down and to die on the cell for our children in the future because God's watching.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  And I can't think of a more important message going into this July 4th weekend than that.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  I'm going to spend this July 4th weekend in reflection and focus and research and exercise my body to be healthy with my family
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  and just recommitting, how can I be the most truthful?
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  How can I be the most hardcore?
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  How can I be the most focused?
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  How can I be an example to others of what needs to happen in the future?
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  And I'm telling you, people like Dr. Peter McCullough and Dr. Joseph Merkola and people like Dr. Zev Zelenko and so many others are the examples of what we need to be like and to model ourselves like.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  And I just want to say it again, I love this audience of activists.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  You are the tip of the spear. What you've done has changed the world and I am so thankful the fact that you care and you're tuned in and you're involved and you want to fix things.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  That is the spirit that's going to save the world and I am so proud of this crew.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  Let's go to this quick clip as they declare war on us. We'll be right back.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  They said that this could be a long war measured in years and I think everybody understands why this is happening, but is it sustainable?
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  What do you say to those families who say, listen, we can't afford to pay for 85 a gallon for months if not years. This is just not sustainable.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  What you heard from the president today was a clear articulation of the stakes. This is about the future of the liberal world order and we have to stand firm.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  The liberal world order means your children is castrated, you're bankrupt, you're homeless, you die, you have no future, you have no hope, humans are obsolete, humans are bad.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  We need to reject the liberal world order that is the satanic new world order. We'll be right back.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  Some of these products were selling at below cost. You've got to move them out of the warehouse and be able to continue to stay on the air.

[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  I want to thank you all this July 4th for your continued fight for America and I would encourage you to join the fight even harder now because we're so close to winning.

[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  Well known filmmaker and talk show host and good friend of mine Jason Jones.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  Wrote an article yesterday we posted at infowars.com saying is the Democratic party the alien party.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  I don't care about flying saucers, I don't care about little green men, I don't care about all that speculation.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  Everything the Democrats do is anti-human, anti-human rights, destroying our environment, destroying a human future.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  They act like an alien species taking over and then you go to the Davos group with Hurari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  And they say oh a post-human world is coming, humans are bad, we've got a new human we are about to build.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  I mean this is happening and the FDA is set to approve human chimeric pigs that are part human part pig with organs they grow for us.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  Now the thing is you cover that decades ago when they were developing it, you're a cuckoo, you're a nut, you're crazy, it doesn't exist.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  But now that it's being announced it's just in your face. That's the type of issue.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  So when they tell you a man can have a baby or a woman can be a man or two women had a baby in state prison in California or New Jersey or New York or wherever.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  It's about getting you to accept logical fallacies and just scramble your brain.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  And here's some of these headlines and we'll go to your phone calls.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  First state moves to ban gender affirming treatments for children.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  If I went to the doctor and I said doc I just believe I'm a transhumanist, I shouldn't have arms.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  When you cut my arms off they put me in a mental institution.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  And when they say oh a five year old who got confused by his teacher wants to be a girl, we want to sign him up when he's 10 to have his balls cut off.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  You'd say that person was insane.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  But no, because the media and the corporations and the institutions, the schools, the universities and the judges and the psychologists, many of them, not all of them gaslight us.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  We go okay, stunning and brave. Cut that boys genitals off.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  State of Alabama has called on federal court to uphold a ban on so-called gender affirming medical treatments for transgender youths.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  Which cause all sorts of medical problems.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  Look at this insane image of your radio listener.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  You're being spared at the guy.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  It looks like a demonic chipmunk.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  Toronto police caused confusion with post about missing a woman.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  I've got the post with a goatee.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  All points bulletin an image of a woman.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  This is what the woman looks like, and it's a man.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  Here is the Toronto police press release.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  News release missing woman.

[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  Trans state border defiant after beating child rivals.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  He's not just a woman now.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  He's a teenager.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  Beat the other number two 15 year old.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  That's on infowars.com.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  Poll shows American belief in transgender ideologies falling.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  Is American belief in Santa Claus following?
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  Is American belief in the Easter Bunny falling?
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  Is American belief in the Tooth Fairy falling?
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  And again, if you're a full grown man and you've been effeminate your whole life
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  and a lot of chemicals in the food and water do blur those lines,
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  that's actually happening.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  And you want to go have surgeries and you want to go do stuff.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  That's your business.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  Just don't have me as a taxpayer pay for it.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  Be prepared for a massive nuclear waste crisis.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  It's official as of June 19.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  I now serve my nation as the deputy assistant secretary of spent fuel waste.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  Disposition in the office of nuclear energy in the Department of Energy.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  So the new head.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  The new deputy head of nuclear waste.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  Is a man.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  Press like a woman who poses in their official photo is that complete with high heels.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  It's a dude that looks like a space alien with a bald head.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  So they don't just say they're women.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  They then blaspheme the powerful image of a woman and look like Lex Luthor.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  Complete with the red, white and blue high heels.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  And it's like I've said, if you make that personal choice, that's your issue.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  But take Blair White.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  Blair White looks like a woman and Blair White's not trying to sterilize little kids.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  And Blair White's not trying to teach kids this stuff.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  Blair White made that decision.
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  And it's a smart, nice person.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  I don't hate Blair White.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  This is a ballheaded dude saying I run the nuclear waste dumps and I'm in my office in a red jumper.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  So again, be prepared for massive nuclear waste crisis.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  Here's the full photo.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  This is the strutting around, pissing on our face, declaring victory over us.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  This is the aftermath.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  And it continues.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  Yep, there he is.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  That's not a woman, folks.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  That's an affront to women.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  I mean, if you're going to say you're a woman, buddy boy, you better look like one.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  But it's about taking over the image.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  A woman is an ugly ballheaded dude in a dress.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  Marvel Comics introducing first gay Spider-Man.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  What if Spider-Man's heterosexual?
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  It's all just sexual.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  It's a sex cult.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  And it goes on from there.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  Weird New Disney show Baymax features transgender tampons scene where men use tampons.
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  It's about totally screwing up our children, period.

[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  I'm going to come back and take your phone calls for the next 45 minutes.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  And then I'm going to do a memorial for Dr. Zevzilenko, who is a real patriot and somebody we love and who is alive with us right now.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  And then we've got more of the carbon tax news, all over the world just saying farming is banned, cars are going to be banned.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  They're not at one side of their mouth.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  They're like, yeah, we're banning all your cars for the earth, but it's all Putin's fault.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  That's coming up as well.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  And we've got representative MTG calls for committee to investigate Epstein Maxwell clients.

[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  Only way you lose is not taking action.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  I got storeable food.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  I got it for friends and family.

[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying and that's why they run the fake headline against myself.
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  And Tucker Carlson, everywhere, every day, Jones admits he's an actor.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  Or Tucker Carlson says, nobody would take me seriously.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  Where do we say that? We never said that. They just say, we said that.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  But where's the clip? Where's the article? Where do we say that? It doesn't exist.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  He's actually a performance artist. He's a performance artist.
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  And it's all based on custody by Will Max's wife five years ago.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  And she was trying to put into evidence to be dressed up more than a decade before like the Joker.
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  And he's sarcastic saying, take your Prozac kids, take your illegal drugs too. You'll die. It's fun.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  So people wouldn't take drugs. And they wanted to enter that in evidence.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  They look. He's insane telling kids to use drugs.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker,
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  no one thinks that's really Jack Nicholson.
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander, or Optimus Prime, or the Joker,
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  because I can do imitations of them all really good.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  Or Darth Vader.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  Do I really think I'm Darth Vader?
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  No. Do I think I'm Optimus Prime, Cobra Commander, the Joker? No.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  And clearly no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying is what I really think.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  No one believes the Babylon Bee. It's not trying to lie to you.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  It's being sarcastic.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  By the vaccinate me Elmo doll today. It's required by the CBC.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  But they play those games. And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke. This isn't serious.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  They clip it out and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  Every day when I leave work, I do this.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  That man's a threat to this country.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  And they go, look, he admitted in court he's an actor.
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  Yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly. I was an actor in Waking Life.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  I was an actor when I was Cobra Commander.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles to you isn't a real thing.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  And isn't something I'm actually saying. And you know that.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  You're insulted right now. I'm even explaining that to you. And so am I.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  But that's who these people are.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented. He's smart. He's funny as hell. He's truly funny.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  I'm kind of retarded.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes,
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  do you now not listen to what I say about other things when I show you a powerful news article
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  by Dr. Joseph Mercola on infowars.com that has all the cited information.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  The latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  No, that's a real thing. That's something happening in the real world.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  And that's what we're breaking down here today.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  I am Alex Jones. And I am the guy on this show every day.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  I am an American. And that's what I promote is freedom, and justice, and liberty, and they can't stand it.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  It's Friday, July 1st.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  Pesky Earth Creatures.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  All right. For the next 40-something minutes, let's take your phone calls.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  We're doing a great job, lately taking the calls.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  We're going to go bam, bam, bam through your calls.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  Let's talk to Mark in Florida, then Sam, CJ, Leroy, Junior, Luke, Dave, Robert, Kevin, Abraham, Matt.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  But first up, Mark in Florida here on the air.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  Alex, thank you for taking my call. First-time caller, long-time listener.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  I'm a self-employed 66-year-old senior who last November moved from the suburbs of Detroit
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  to leave the Nazi governor, moved to the Panhandle of Florida.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  And at the time, my family and friends thought I'd lost my mind.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  They no longer think that way, but at the time, they did.
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  And I want to say, God bless you. Stay on the air. The devil is a liar.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  I'm going to plug one of your products.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  I listen all the time, and I heard this guy talking about the iodine supplement XQ saying,
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  well, he's been taking it. His memory is getting better, and he's having dreams, and I'm like, yeah, maybe.
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  So I had to go back to Michigan for three weeks for business.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  I came back, and for a week, I had massive sinus headache, massive sinus condition,
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  and the earache that was driving me nuts.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  I said, you know, I'm going to try the XQ. I had just gotten it.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  Two days later, earache was gone. Sinuses were cleared. No headaches.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  I couldn't believe it. The stuff is real. It works.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  So anyways, I want to thank you for all that. Two questions I have.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  Why did SCOTUS give Biden a win with the stay in Mexico policy?
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  I'm trying to understand that when I'm scratching my head on that one.
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  And my second question is, with the red wave coming, the GOP have done absolutely nothing in Michigan, Pennsylvania,
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia to fix what happened in 2020.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  How do we overcome that? Those are two concerns I have, and I don't see any clarity on those issues.
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  Well, I totally agree with you. I don't trust the Supreme Court as far as I can throw them.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  They've made good rulings on Christian Liberty First Amendment being able to pray if you want individually.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  That's not state-run religion. They've had a great Roe v. Wade, a great Second Amendment ruling,
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  a great carbon banning EPA ruling.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  But then, why would they say the president can't say migrants have to stay in Mexico while they seek asylum?
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  Now they just let them in and turn them loose, and 95% or more never come back to court hearings.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  So that's a bad ruling by the Supreme Court. I would ask you, why do you think they did that, Mark?
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  And then as for RINOS and neocons trying to sabotage our populist revolution,
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  they're bigger enemies of the Democrats at the end of the day.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  So yeah, that's one of the big threats we face. Let me ask you briefly, then.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  Why do you think the Supreme Court did that? In an ocean of good decisions, why that bad decision?
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  That's a great question. I've been vacillating back and forth trying to scratch my head saying, how did that happen?
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  Because my understanding is, and again, I'm no expert, but I thought international law was whatever the first country,
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  a migrant, illegal, whatever you want to tag them as, lands in,
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  international law says that's where they have to be processed and stayed,
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  yet the cartels in Mexico are allowing them to continue to flood over the border.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  As far as I'm concerned, with Roberts having pictures of him hanging with the Epstein crowd in college,
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  I think we've got a situation within the Supreme Court that's bought and paid for that goes to the political realm of...
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  No, I hear you, but then why would they make the good decisions? That's the paradox. Thanks for the call, Gray Point.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  Let's go to Kevin in Colorado. It says a massive shift is happening. I agree. How would you define that massive shift?
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  The shift has been insane. Alex, I've been an Uber driver for seven years. Currently, I'm in Denver,
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  and usually I feel like I'm surrounded by a bunch of liberals and snowflakes, but the last couple of months has been an insane shift.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  All I have to do is mention high gas prices and everyone comes in talking about the New World Order, tuning in to Info Wars,
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  talking about Owen Schwoiger, Tim Pool, Tucker Carlson. The people are shifting and they're waking up in the masses,
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  and it's really beautiful to see, but the work is just getting started, I feel like.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  Well, I agree with you. You know, we didn't play this this hour. I think we did play it again.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  Maybe we'll play it going out to break, but White House spokesperson says,
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  yeah, gas prices are part of a liberal New World Order, a transition. They're admitting it.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  Yeah, I saw that. It's insane. I mean, no one is going to go along with this. Everyone's waking up.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  I talked to a guy yesterday who's growing a garden in his backyard. He's prepping. He's getting storeable food.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  I talked to a woman from Cuba. I talked to another woman from Venezuela and they're both just like,
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  how do people not see this coming? This is what starts communism. This is what it collapses countries.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  We're the last free country. And by the way, since you mentioned that it's in my stack, I can't find it.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  I'll try to find it in the break. There's footage now in Ottawa, the capital of Canada,
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  where peaceful demonstrators show up with Canadian flags on the street and the police slam their head in the ground and beat them up.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  Trudeau, his band demonstrating that footage and photo of them executing that famous Cuban farmer that wouldn't hand his property over to Fidel Castro.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  So they had my four-minute trial. Shay Guevara did and they executed him. I mean, this is crazy.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  I mean, the new North Korea is Canada, brother. We have got a problem.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  One of my good friends is from Canada. He's kind of a liberal. He's met Trudeau before and he just refuses to wake up.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  He comes to America and he looks around and sees all these American flags and he doesn't understand it.
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  He says, you know, why is there so many American flags everywhere? It's like offended by it. Disgusting.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  Well, that's people pretending under Stockholm syndrome. They're part of the power structure.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  Kevin, powerful call. I agree. I'm seeing what you're seeing. Mass awakening.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  Well, folks, the freedom lives. The resistance is at infowars.com. We're going to go to break.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  Come back next hour with Sam C.J. Leroy, Jr., Luke, Dave, Robert, Abraham, Matt, all of you, the order they're received.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  But here is the White House spokesperson saying all of this is for your own good. It's part of the liberal new world order.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  So they said that this could be a long war measured in years. And I think everybody understands why this is happening.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  But is it sustainable? What do you say to those families who say, listen, we can't afford to pay for 85 a gallon for months if not years.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  This is just not sustainable.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  What we've heard from the president today was a clear articulation of the stakes. This is about the future of the liberal world order.
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  We have a giant sale going right now of amazing products that you and your family really, really need.

[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  It was a pre-skimming, the last rise to a human farmer, or it was land. Months later, they banned the Catholic Church.
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  The picture work for Castro regime died. A firing squadron for trial by Shay Gavar, the last of four minutes.
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  You will never see picture on a t-shirt.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  We've got some key clips of Dr. Zebsalinka who died yesterday coming up this hour.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  Let's go ahead and go to the callers of the order that they are received.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  And let's talk to Dave in Georgia. You're on the air, Dave.
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  Hey, Alex, you there?
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  Okay, so I am a cultural anthropologist. In 2011, I did my dissertation and my thesis.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  And my professor worked for the CDC here in Atlanta, worked for the CDC in Atlanta for 30 years.
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  And you had a caller that called in a week and a half ago when you were asking about what is the main problem.
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  And I look at two issues in regards to geoengineering and the gay pride stuff.
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  And all of the drag queens story time and all of that stuff, we can step aside from that and we can fight it.
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  But the geoengineering stuff is so in our face.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  And my father died from COVID last year and my mother's got a new boyfriend. He died at 86.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  And her new boyfriend, she's seven years old, has got an airplane.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  And he took me flying in his airplane over Stone Mountain a month ago.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  And when we were flying in the airplane, the traffic controllers were like, hey, y'all got to get away from this airplane coming in before you land in the Peat Street airport.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  I could even understand it for some X reason.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  And I asked him, what does that mean? He goes, oh, that's an unmarked airplane.
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  And we had to fly around it. And then when we landed, we saw they were just spraying cross lines of all this poison over us.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  It's all declassified giant geoengineering programs. CIA admits it.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  Just like, oh, there's no world government, but there is a world government. Yeah, it's just all in our face.
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  And being in the studies with my professor in school, he told me that he was flown to Vietnam during the Vietnam War
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  and how it was declassified in 2004 that they came out and said that they did cloud seed the skies during the Vietnam War
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  to drown out and cause rain supply issues to the supply lines in the war.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  You can see my doctor Ben Livingston interviews at band.video in 2004. They declassified that.
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  They were weather controlling in World War II.
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  Well, he laughed about it. And, you know, this is a side issue. And he said, he told us, he said, David, you don't have to believe in evolution, but you got to know it.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  And we have diseases known all the way back to 2000 years ago at the time of Jesus that we're weaponizing now.
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  And this issue in regards to me being in Vietnam, we were trying to save the soldiers that were dying from dehydration.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  But he even admitted it. He said, I saw them deploying their geoengineering tactics back then.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  And I didn't understand what the grid lines were, but it's just so in our face, man.
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  That's the thing. They treat us like animals. The globalists have decided they're a new species. They've decided they're God.
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  They're using us as guinea pigs. I really appreciate your call, Dave.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  All right. We got a lot of callers here. No more calls.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  We'll take these. I'm going to get to Matt and Abraham and Robert and Andrew and Luke and Junior and Anderson and Leroy and CJ and Joe.
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  I will get to every one of those calls. But in the last segment, I've got the last time Zelenko was on with us.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  A very powerful segment I'm going to air. And I've got a short clip of Zelenko coming up after the break because he was a great guy and he's alive with us today.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  We know he's at the next level, but he lives with us on today. He asks us to step up our game. He asks us to take action.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  We are doing it, not just for him, but for the children.
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  We'll be right back infowars.com. Share that link. They can't stand it when you do infowars.com.

[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  I just came from my doctors and not good news. My cancer, which I've been fighting for four years, has progressed.
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  There's one last ditch effort that may lead to cure, which I'm going to do. But if that fails, then the estimates are unpleasant.
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  But I've been at this place multiple times in the last four years. And so when someone lives with that consciousness, something happens.
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  Something very good happens. You kind of live each day and you appreciate time. And in reality, just think of it philosophically.
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  You begin to die from the day you're born. No one lives forever. Some people live 20 years, some people live 100 years, but in the grand scheme of creation, it's fine.
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:29.000]  So in my opinion, it's not important when and how you die. It's much more important how you live.
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  And so, because when and how you die is not in your control. But how you live is in your control.
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  How you think, how you speak, and how you act is within the free will and the volition of man.
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  So my advice to people is, appreciate the gift of consciousness in life, if you're being given. Happy birthday, because every instant of time is an active recreation.
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  It's a dynamic involvement in God's part for us to be. If you woke up, that's proof that He wants you to be and that you didn't finish your job.
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:27.000]  And I would say the world will be redeemed or fixed, rectified through acts of goodness and kindness.
[2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  Even if the sword is on your neck, you should never give up. I do feel the sword on my neck, but I'm still very hopeful.
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  And I live with more tranquility and serenity than I've ever had in my life, which is very counterintuitive.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  Because for the carnage and the malevolence evil that I've come to contact with in the last two years, I would not expect that type of inner peace.
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  But what I've realized is that when you're in alignment, you seem to be in alignment with the divine will, there's a certain gift of tranquility that's given.
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  And it's not easy, by the way, very hard, but so what? And it's kind of some struggle, but all the suffering that I went through, I still wouldn't give up.
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  By the way, I didn't ask for this challenge, but no one asked me, so as I went through it, I am going through it.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  The serenity is really something I've been seeking my whole life, so I'm very grateful to have it.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  Listen, we need generals, we need people with plan forms like Joe Rogan and other people like that who are free-thinking spirits, but don't buy into the false narrative.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  They're not able to kind of dig out the truth themselves, and they have to trust the people.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  So this is the key here, this is a narrative war, the enemies of humanity have control over the social media, they have a head start in social media and mainstream media, but we can catch up, and a little truth, a little light, dispenses a lot of darkness.
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  So I plead on people like Joe and Rogan and other people with plan forms to wake up, join together as an army of truth speakers, and say no to these animals and these despots, and save as many people as we can with spreading the truth.
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  The soul of humanity is at stake here.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  I had thousands, hundreds, probably thousands of sick patients with no treatment, but what are you supposed to do? Let them die?
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  The whole, the government was telling us to send them home, the government is still telling us, NIH, as of today, tells you don't treat COVID, go home, then go to the hospital, and if the oxygen is less than 92, then you should be treated.
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  That's a policy of the government that wants you to die. Any policy that obstructs early pre-hospital treatment is a policy of death.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  And I'm sorry to say this, I have to be realistic and I have to protect humanity, and I feel I have to let the world know that we are being slaughtered by a few sociopathic oligarchs and corrupt governments and false promises.
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  And we need to stop listening to these people saying no.
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  I'm not going to let you kill me or my family and the people I love. No.
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  And come to my house and try to put a shot into my arm, let's see what happens to you. We'll get a different shot.
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  The difference between us and Australia now, where they're building gulags already, and then turning people into quarantine facilities, and putting ankle braces on people who don't want to take a shot, is that we have 415 million guns.
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  Powerful. Watch the interviews right up on inforwars.com with Dr. Zelensky. Dr. Zelensky has made the jump into hyperspace.
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  We love you, Dr. Zelensky.
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  All right, we're going back to your phone calls right now. Who's up next here?
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  I guess that would be Luke in Tennessee. Luke, you're on the air. Welcome.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  Good to be on the air. How are you doing today?
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  Man, crazy time. They're announcing world government and it's liberal.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  Yeah, liberal world order. I want to talk to everybody about what we can do about that announcement.
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  And the first thing I think that people need to do is admit the problem.
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  You need to admit that there is a hostile world government takeover.
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  It is a very scary thing to admit that these people want you dead. They do not want you to have a family. They want an anti-human future.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  They are going to try to starve you out by reducing energy, reducing crop yields, and creating war.
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  They're going to try to kill you. You have to admit that to yourself, number one.
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  That's right. They're in direct war against humanity on record. They are the enemy.
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  Anybody endorsing great reset build back matter is a literal enemy of humanity.
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  Now, that's hard for a lot of people to deal with. But once you get past that, it is very freeing.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  And instead of panicking, you just need to become the solution.
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  And the first thing you need to do is to secure yourself and your family.
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  So you just need to prepare for the pain that they're going to try to give you.
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  Because just because they say they want to do this doesn't mean they're going to be able to.
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  And they're putting us in pain to drive us into breaking down and accepting a world social credit score and universal basic income where they have complete control.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  And I hear a lot of people on here talking about how, you know, they started gardening or their neighbor is gardening or they're planting a garden and that is great.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  But it's starting to become later in the season. And one of the things you can do is that you don't have a lot of property.
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  You don't have a garden. You live in a populated area. Buy a little bit more food every time you go to the grocery store.
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  And I'm not talking big stuff. I'm talking canned beans.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  That's right. Because it only shuts stuff down for a few months to make the average person break down.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  You've just got to be less weak than the last person.
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  And don't forget about preparewithalx.com. My patriots apply. Those are good as well.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  But if you don't have that much money, at least do something.
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  And the next thing that I want people to do is once you have admitted the problem, once you know what you're facing and you're no longer afraid.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  And when you're becoming part of the solution, you need to build a community. You need to building that.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  More important than water filtration and guns and food is a relationship with God and then a community.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  Because together we are so powerful together on a mission. Humans are incredible. Thank you so much, Luke.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  And if you want the entire MyPatriot Supply catalog with even more survival items than they've got, we have it ready to ship.

[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  We also have the July 4 special. It's all of our products, 40 to 75% off.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  At 75% off, we're losing money on some of these products.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  Infowarsstore.com. You need to get Alpha Power and Brainforce Plus and Polym Block and Ultimate Crilla and Fish Oil and Vitamin D3 Gummies
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  and Knockout and the Multivitamin, which is the same as the Heron Beer Support, but that's even a lower price.
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  All right. I'm doing OK taking calls. The next segment is nine minutes long. I'm taking four calls.
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  We come out of this break. So get ready. Get ready.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  There is nothing. There is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with. And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:16.000]  You might not agree with everything. You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here. Thank you for that, Ward.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, Infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks, and we do have the best supplements.
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the best with our supplements as well.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  I mean, look at the Heron Beer Support formula. Folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away at 75% off.
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  By the way, it works for me. In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  Quite well, I might add. Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men. I go and see them quite often now.
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome.
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  Hello, Alex.
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  Yes, Malcolm.
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer. SuperMell Vitality and Brainforce Plus.
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank.
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  SuperMell Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions. They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:36.000]  This is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  I don't have to tell you that fish oil is known to be so good for your brain, so good for your heart, so good for your cells, your cardiovascular system, your lungs, your sleep.
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  It's amazing. Well, we set out a few years ago to go out and develop with top manufacturers the strongest, highest quality, purest fish oil out there.
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  And this blend is amazing. Ultimate fish oil, back in stock at InfoWarsHore.com.
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  Wild anchovy purified fish oil, ultra pure arctic krill oil, high quality, wild caught salmon oil, vitamin D, vitamin E.

[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  We've not sold food for three months because there was a wait. Now there is not a wait.
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  Almost every other storeable food distributor is completely out and will not have more food for months if ever, and the prices are exploding.
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to protect yourself and your family and not be dependent on the system. The time to be self-sufficient is now.

[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  We really are changing the world together. We really are laying out how things actually work.
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  And if the public ever gets wind of it and ever tunes in, which is happening, it's game over for the New World Order.
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  And that's why they're so scared. Thank you so much for joining the Alex Jones Show. I'm your host Alex Jones here on this Friday Worldwide Broadcast.
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  Let's go to the callers back in the order they are received. Let's go to Robert in Kentucky, then CJ in Ohio.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  Robert, you're on the air.
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  Yes, sir. Thank you so much, Alex Jones, for all you do.
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  Thank you.
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  For a long time listener. Now I've listened for over 10 years. It's the first time I've called. Just wanted to get a quick thing out.
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  I'm in my late 30s. I'm a healthy individual. I'm a construction worker.
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  I had to have a surgery last year and the hospital where I was going to get my surgery done said that I had to get COVID, both the COVID vaccines to be able to have my surgery.
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  About six months after my vaccinations and my surgery, I started having lots of thinking spells and blood pressure issues.
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  And after lots of tests and blood, blood work and stuff that I got done, I was diagnosed with pox disease.
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  Now that is not a sense for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  I guess my question would be, and just a few months ago, I actually caught COVID-19.
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  So I guess my question is, why are we being forced to have the vaccines? And if I can still catch COVID, what is the COVID vaccine doing for us?
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  Well, it terrorized you and bullied you for the right to work into taking something that, I'm not a doctor, but what you described, was that a heart problem, a cardiovascular issue?
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  Yes, sir. It's a heart problem. And when I stand up or start to walk after sitting down, I feel like I'm in a faint.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  I mean, sir, have you seen that the October 2020 document from the CDC where they said exactly that would happen if you took the shot? They knew, they did it to you, and they have these useful idiots telling you to have a job, you got to do it.
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  And it's literally eugenics. They give you a soft kill weapon. There's ways to mitigate it.
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  I've talked to a bunch of medical doctors on and off air. It's growing prion crystals in your body, causing blood clots.
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  Ivermectin, not just when you have it, but cycles of Ivermectin now every couple of months is what people are doing to detoxify for a moment.
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  I personally did another cycle of Ivermectin, had my dad do it a few months ago, and it really helped us. This is a very serious chronic infection, nanotech bioweapon.
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  But Ivermectin kills parasites, and it's a parasite, so God bless you. I'm sorry to hear that happen to you, Robert. These people are unbelievable.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  But they have idiots that know what they're doing, making you do it.
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:25.000]  I've talked to a lot of doctors and nurses on and off air.
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  Were you wondering about their hospital staffing shortages now? There weren't two years ago. Their excuse was, take the shot, lock down because of hospital shortages. Now they're shortages because people are so sick.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:48.000]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Junior. No, no, CJ's next. And then Junior. CJ in Ohio. Welcome. Thanks for holding.
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:50.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  What's on your mind, CJ?
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  Yeah, I wanted to thank you for honoring Drs. Blanco today. I think that's a great thing to do.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  You know, I'm calling in to give him my blessings and his family and be thinking about him and praying for them over the coming days in the midst of the confusion and all the BS with the COVID, all the data manipulation stuff.
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  I mean, he was a real lighted path for many of us and hopefully for many others.
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  He was exactly where he wanted to be and he did a great job. So we all are very proud of him, including his family right now.
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  That's a life well led against the enemy.
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  Yep. He was a sturdy stolen thinker and the lovable teddy bear all in one. And we should continue to support his Z-stack formulation too.
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:39.000]  It makes a lot of sense. He did a great job explaining why it worked and all the research he did on it.
[2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  Also to help support his family, just like we support the Info Wars.
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  Absolutely.
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  Yeah, we all need to find a hill to die on like he did. And, you know, it's all around us.
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  I mean, if you watch what happened with the Tina Fears election the other day, I mean, it's the full steam ahead.
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  Well, you know, he loved everybody, but he was Jewish and proud of his faith, which is great.
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  That's Masada. Where does a hill to die on come from? It comes from Masada with the Romans and the Jews all dying on the hill.
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  And so we are all at our Masada right now. I appreciate your call, brother. God bless you.
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  All right, let's jam in another call here. Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in Florida, then Junior.
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  Matt in Florida, you're on the air. Welcome.
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  They say that you're a character, Alex, and you are a great guy, man, that Biden and Kamala are the real characters.
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  You know, they're faking it. They're actors, they're career politicians.
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  They work their way into powered lying and cheating. So don't let them get to you.
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  Let me tell you, everything I say here, I mean life and death, real on my soul.
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  And that's what they say. Oh, he's not really doesn't mean it. Well, why is all this fake stuff I claim keep coming true?
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  No, I mean, when I say 100 percent, you got that right, Alex.
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  And you know, I speak about you positively in my book info war.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  I mean, COVID 42, which is getting crushed by the cancel culture.
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  I think I got a publishing deal on it, but we just can't get it out there regardless.
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  And so I want to plug that. Send me a copy, Matt. We love you, brother.
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  We appreciate you. Let's put in another caller here. Let's talk to junior junior in Texas.
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  You're on the air, junior. Go ahead.
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones. I just want to say it started by saying I commend you and I believe for the hard work that you can be doing.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  With everything said, Dr. Zelenko did not die in vain.
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  He brought us a lot of wisdom.
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  Well, let me stop your phone's little muffled. Talk right in your receiver.
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  Can you hear me now? I hear you loud and clear. Go ahead, junior.
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  Awesome. I just want to just say I commend you for your hard work and that you continue to keep doing.
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  And Dr. Zelenko did not die in vain.
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  His beacon of wisdom that he shared with us will be forever cherished.
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  And I can attest this as a science major.
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  With that being said, have you have you heard about the new drops that a great village from 2000 news is about to release?
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  It's going to literally make the 2000 news look like a walk in the park.
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  I have heard about it. I want to get the folks from 2000 Meals back on.
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  Tell listeners the new developments.
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  Yes. This upcoming July literally is going to be crazy.
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  It's going to be fireworks.
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  God is getting ready to intervene and deliver this nation and teach us a lesson.
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  With that being said, it's going to be crazy.
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  I heard they're about to release more info, so what are they about to release?
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  I'm going to definitely look it up. Tell me.
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  It's going to have to deal with the election fraud of 2020 and foreign interference.
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  This was an act of war and a national security has been breached and compromised.
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  It's going to divide this nation probably much more than it already is.
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  I'm just grateful that I'm alive to witness this stuff.
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  I've been recording and keeping archives of all this following the election frauds in 2020.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  This lady by the name of Maria Zach, I will really suggest you bring her on to your show.
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  She's from Nations in Action, a non-profit organization.
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  We'll get her on.
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  I totally agree with you, Junior, that who could be bored during this time?
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  This is not a movie. This is not a football game. It doesn't matter.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  This is the real world battle for the future.
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  Thank you so much, Junior.
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:28.000]  All right, Joe, Anderson, Andrew, Abraham, we're going to order the calls received.
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  So Abraham is up next on the other side than the Dr. Zelenko compilation we have and more.
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  Wow, absolutely insane. What a time to be alive.
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  I mean, no way to be bored right now.
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  People will say they're bored.
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  That's because they're watching too much Netflix, baby.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  I ain't living in Netflix's world.
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  I'm living in the info war and it's real.
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  Stay right back. Stay with us.
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  We've got to move them out of the warehouse and be able to continue to stay on the air.
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  So please take action and declare independence from the New World Order by keeping the tip of the spear on air
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  and getting great products at infowarsstore.com.
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:38.000]  I want to thank you all this July 4th for your continued fight for America,
[2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  and I would encourage you to join the fight even harder now because we're so close to winning.
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:56.000]  infowarsstore.com and celebrate July 4th, 1776, Part 2 against the New World Order because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:29:56.000 --> 2:30:12.000]  I want to say Brain Force is great. I want to say Turbo Force is amazing. It is, but if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[2:30:12.000 --> 2:30:15.000]  The fish oil is better than it, and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:26.000]  And it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm just sorry. You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[2:30:26.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good. It might be. I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:37.000]  I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:44.000]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:49.000]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I'm just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got,
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:53.000]  I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:24.000]  It can't be censored in the future, and so you can show it to everyone you know.
[2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:32.000]  Go to infowarstore.com and get 2,000 mules today and get it discounted up to 30% off when you get it with other documentary films,
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:38.000]  like in-game blueprint for global enslavement, the seminal classic that predicted the great reset,
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:42.000]  and of course part one, part two, and now the new part three of COVIDland.
[2:31:42.000 --> 2:31:51.000]  Get them separate, get them together, massively discounted at infowarstore.com, but everyone needs to have 2,000 mules in their library
[2:31:51.000 --> 2:31:53.000]  so the globalists can't censor it.
[2:31:53.000 --> 2:32:16.000]  infowarstore.com to get 2,000 mules today.

[2:32:57.000 --> 2:33:08.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:08.000 --> 2:33:33.000]  You are either with the Republic or against it. Resistance to Titans is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:40.000]  The Obama administration, that's what is in charge of the U.S. right now,
[2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  went on Fox News and said, it's Trump's fault 53 people died in the tractor trailer this week in South Texas.
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  That clip's coming up in the first segment of the next hour,
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  because we've added a lot of video and documentation that it's also going to be added to Bandod video.
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  And I have a Dr. Zelinko compilation eclipse in this last interview with us, parts of it next segment.
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  But right now, we're taking your phone calls, and so let's go in the order they are received.
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  Abraham in New York, thanks for calling. Let's talk about Dr. Zelinko. Go ahead.
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  I love you, Alex. You're doing great work. Dr. Zelinko did great work. We cannot forget about him.
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  I'm going to make two very sound suggestions as to what the Info War family should consider.
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  You need to create a corporation that runs parallel with Info Wars.
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:38.000]  And everybody can pay a monthly due, whatever you're able to.
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  And maybe every 60 days, we have a vote on how those monies will be invested,
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  whether it's for Owens legal defense, whether it's to expand bandwidth,
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  whether it's to give out 3DVDs on the street to people, whatever we have to do, we have to do it.
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:35:00.000]  But that would be one part, and it would be an Info Wars family-based apparatus
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  that helps to command the monetized resources that we need to protect Owens
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  and to protect Hamilton and to protect Alex.
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:12.000]  And we could use those monies for other things as new problems emerge.
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:20.000]  Second, we need from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m., we need to keep re-running all of the great work, Malcolm X,
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  Dr. Zelinko, all of the classic material that brought us knowledge.
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  By the way, I totally agree with you. I agree with everything Malcolm X said.
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  Like you tuned into Malcolm X interviews, which they suppressed, every bit of it's true.
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  Today, it's just as important or more important than when he said it.
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  Absolutely. And Dr. Zelinko, every single day of our lives, we need to hear words from him.
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  He was courageous. He could have lived a comfortable life and not had all the stress
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  and not all those dangerous exposures. He risked himself, put himself out there more for us.
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  It is our duty to salute him and all the others that were brave enough to work endowed by God
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  with wisdom, with courage, like Owens, like Hamilton.
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  Lots of Abraham. If there weren't other men and women that had courage, we would be totally screwed.
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  As bad as things are, we are living off the gas these men and women put in the tank.
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  And let me tell you, my mother, she was in the classroom in Columbia University under Dmitry Zabinski.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  And about 15 years later than after that, because she was computer literate in 1980,
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  she was working right next to David Rockefeller, hoping him to do his computer setup.
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  And when I asked her about these people, they're nerds.
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  These are calm persons that when you are next to them, they don't seem to have any evil agenda, any power.
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  Just like Jeffrey Dahmer or just like all the famous serial killers, they look non-threatening with their dangerous as hell.
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  Absolutely. And these two ideas that I'm saying are very important.
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  An Infowars Union, just an Infowars Union, the Alex Jones accounting firm, those guys could be the elders of this to make sure we manage it correctly.
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  And from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m., we run seven days a week, all of the great orators,
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:20.000]  whether it's Bill Cooper, Malcolm X, even Dr. King, and all the classic content,
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  and let the people from time to time vote on what we need to reinforce.
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  But we have to let the great wise men of the past have their words be thoroughly preserved.
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  No, you're totally right. That's how they win is demonizing great leaders,
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  misrepresenting what they said, and then suppressing.
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  Take Eisenhower, his 21-minute speech was not just military-industrial complex.
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  He said there's a scientific elite that's evil that is in control and taking over.
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  Where is that speech? I mean, I agree. Famous speeches from the past, those that don't know history,
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:54.000]  don't repeat it. Beautiful Abraham, thank you so much.
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  A powerful caller. Let's go ahead and talk to Anderson in Maryland.
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  Anderson, thanks for calling.
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  Alex.
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  Welcome.
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  Thank you. Thank you very much, y'all.
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  Hey, look, RIP, Dr. Jeff, love what you're doing. Love your products.
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  Watch all three shows.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  Hey, look, what's on my mind is, I can't believe this hasn't exploded.
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  But May 20th, 2022, Navy Lieutenant Phil Mosley went before the administrative board,
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  and he was cleared, 3-0 unanimously, of misconduct and not taking the shot.
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  I saw that. No, you're right. The fact is, they can't make you take an experimental shot. It's all a hoax.
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  Well, they, I assume the government, was not able to provide the FDA-approved vaccine, so-called vaccine.
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  But they weren't able to provide that.
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  That's right. Under federal law, and under the anthrax ruling, you cannot give somebody an experimental shot
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  that matter of their military, that matter of their black person or white person,
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  you can't tiskegee people anymore in this country.
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:12.000]  Yeah, well, hey, look, I was terminated for not taking it. They don't own my body.
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  You know, I have my two feet on the ground, and I plant them firmly.
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  But doesn't this help the people that I've lost?
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  No, you're right. We should make a lot bigger deal about it, brother. We forget this.
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  Yeah.
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  And I'm sorry that you lost your, they planned it as a culling and as a litmus test to get rid of the good people.
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  Yeah. I mean, I completed a third of my career.
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  And they just let me go because they think that-
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  Well, Anderson, I'm sorry that happened to you, but you do the right thing. God's looking.
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  At least you're not having a heart attack and dying right now. God bless you. I love you.
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  I'm jamming everybody in there and talking to these callers for hours. We got to get to everybody.
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:57.000]  Joe in New Jersey, you're on the air. Welcome.
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing?
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:02.000]  Man, I'm just blown away. It's up so crazy now.
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  Yeah. You know what? I want to give you a thank you.
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  Every other one of these news outlets, politicians, I mean, they touted this back forever.
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:16.000]  People, families got torn apart. People got hurt. You know, you deserve a thank you, you know?
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:20.000]  Well, I'm doing it for everybody, brother, but thank you.
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  You know, I've got, well, I've kid number two on the way.
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  You know, I thank God every day that my wife, me, my current kid and my, you know, the unborn child right now
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  were all safe, not backed and safe to alpha power.
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  It only took me about a month to make the second one. So I don't know if that's bad for me, but good for you guys.
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  So I mean, I mean, alpha power is definitely a libido male in hand. It's good for women too, but it's definitely powerful.
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  It's unbelievable, unbelievable. Also, I want to bring up the second point.
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  You know, you look at people like Hannity and they always go, they always go so soft with, you know, let's say, oh, look,
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  stupid Biden, he's getting rid of the gasoline and blah, blah, blah.
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  But they don't even see the quote where they're literally saying liberal new world order.
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  When are people going to wake up? I mean, pretty soon, even these rhinos, they're going to be complicit in the loss of America.
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  If you ask me.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  No, I agree. I think they're already complicit, Andrew, and I appreciate your call.
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  All right, here's what I'm going to do. Got another great guest.
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  I was coming up, but I asked Rob do this morning to put together. He put it together.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  Some stations don't carry it, but we'll post it for those that don't see it.
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  There you go. I saw this clip of a Democrat operative on Fox and he's saying.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  You'll see the clip in a minute.
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  Oh, we're controlling the borders.
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  Trump made it fail.
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  The borders not failed.
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  And finally, both the host of the guests, the other guest say, you're full of crap.
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  And they don't even respond to it.
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  They're like, you're a liar.
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  You know, it's a lie.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  And instead of debating the fraud, they just say, you're a liar.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  And that's the point we've got to get to where we just say you are a liar.
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  You're lying. We're calling you out.
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  We're not debating all your fake points. We know you're a liar.
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  So that clips coming up.
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  And then I'll go a little bit the second segment before we hand the baton to
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:10.000]  forget to the guest.
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  Oh, since then the fourth hour, the great Jay Dyer.
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  So I'll host about 10 minutes in the next hour.
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  So I got some other news going ahead as well.
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  And then we will hand the baton to Jay Dyer.
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  And I would show her coming up in about an hour and 15 minutes with the war room
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  three to six p.m. Central.
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  And then did it last Saturday.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  Made national news.
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  Great job.
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  Savannah Hernandez and Drew Hernandez.
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  We are going to do another special live show Saturday.
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  Tomorrow, 11 a.m.

[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  only on the streams and in force.
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:52.000]  That way we can say things that you can't say on AM and FM radio stations
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:54.000]  tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central.

[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:51.000]  This is survival.
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:53.000]  PrepareToday.com.
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  And I'll see you there.
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:29.000]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view.
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  2000 Mules is now available on DVD with expanded extras at infowarsstore.com.

[2:46:53.000 --> 2:46:55.000]  infowarsstore.com.
[2:46:55.000 --> 2:46:57.000]  2000 Mules.
[2:47:13.000 --> 2:47:18.000]  It isn't about us being right, but I think it's key to really have people face
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  what we're up against with any chance of beating them.
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:22.000]  It's like someone who plays chess.
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  The better chess player you are, the more moves ahead you could see.
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:29.000]  And I see already that it's checkmate.
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:33.000]  The only question that's still a variable is how much carnage
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  and what will be the body count of the innocent until we get to that point.
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  And the reason why I'm doing these interviews is that I hope that spreading the true narrative
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  and giving people hope may mitigate or reduce the body count.
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  30 years ago, it became obvious to the people in power
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  and people who are the wealthiest, most powerful people in the planet
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  that there was going to be a major catastrophe economically in 30 years.
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  There would be a collapse bankruptcy of the beginning, a bankruptcy of social security and Medicare.
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  And that's all known and Biden's recent policies of increased entitlements
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  have upped the date to the anticipated collapse that 2027, 2026 used to be 2028.
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  That's the beginning.
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  And within 10 years, there will be a complete bankruptcy.
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  That will have a tsunami effect on the global economy
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  and threatens the stakeholders, their power and their wealth and control mechanisms over humanity,
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  which they've had cultivated over millennia.
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  When the system collapses and the dust settles,
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:58.000]  they will have the new financial infrastructure and control mechanisms
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  to lead to the ultimate enslavement of humanity.
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  And let me explain.
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  In 2016, everyone knows, Klaus Schwab said that within 10 years, meaning by 2026,
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  right before the anticipated collapse, 7 billion people will be tagged with a digital tracking device, essentially.
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  A biometric sensor that transmits biometric data with your location to a third party.
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  The patent that I mentioned earlier gives the technology and the mechanism
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  through which Klaus Schwab's prophecy, let's say, about 7 billion people having a digital identifier
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  that connects them to a centralized network or grid or matrix, is going to happen.
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  And the second patent that goes together with that is what Microsoft has from 2020.
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  It's 00202060606.
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  And that patent describes the linkage of biometric data transmission to cryptocurrency.
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  And so let me explain to you what that actually means.
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  It means that in the future, let's say 2026 at a time, there'll be no more easy pass.
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:19.000]  There'll be no more Apple Pay.
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  There'll be no more credit cards.
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  It'll be biometric transactions.
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  In other words, you are now injected with a technology that transmits your internal temperament
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  and your internal data with your location to a third party.
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  Now, and that will allow you to, let's say, put your hand on a scanner and then walk out from the supermarket.
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  So the hipsters think it's cold.
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  But the problem with that is, what if I don't want to be part of the matrix?
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  What if I don't want to be injected with a tracking technology?
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  Well, then I would be excluded from the system of finance.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  I won't be able to buy bread, at least probably on the black market, but I won't be able to buy bread with my family.
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:04.000]  So it's a control mechanism.
[2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  It's the mark of the beast.
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  We're talking about a force of evil that has always used human slavery as an asset.
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  Slavery has always been the most lucrative industry in the history of humanity.
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  And these people are amoral.
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  They're not immoral.
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:31.000]  They are amoral, which means they are moral when it's expedient to them.
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  They're immoral when it's expedient to them.
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  They support the Jews when it's expedient to them.
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:39.000]  They support the Christians when it's useful to them.
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:43.000]  And then they set the Jews against the Christians and vice versa when it's useful for them.
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  They're capitalists when they need to be.
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  They're communists when they need to be.
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  This level of malevolence transcends all of these systems that they have set.
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  And they play games and create chaos and geopolitical destabilization in order to promote their own agenda.
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:09.000]  In this particular case, it became obvious to everyone that there was going to be a huge economic collapse and they were threatened.
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  So what have they done?
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  They've initiated a plan over the last 30 years that will result in when the system collapses and the dust settles,
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:31.000]  they will have the new financial infrastructure and control mechanisms to lead to the ultimate enslavement of humanity.
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  But the reality is that COVID-19 is a weapon of mass destruction.
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  It was made in a laboratory.
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:37.000]  No one denies that.
[2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  Ralph Barrick in 1999 did research at the University of Chapel Hill in North Carolina.
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  He was able to manipulate a bad animal virus, a bad coronavirus,
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  converted by modulating a surface protein to infect human beings.
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:54.000]  But it was still benign.
[2:52:54.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  It was just infecting human beings then.
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:53:06.000]  And then in 2010, the same Ralph Barrick figured out a way to diffuse coronaviruses by using zinc and zinc ion,
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:14.000]  of course, inhibiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or inhibiting a coronavirus replication.
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  In 2015, and by the way, everything's here being fond of the United States government.
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:27.000]  So, because it's on the papers, and on the peer-reviewed papers, they thank the United States government, NIH, or whatever, for the funding.
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  Then in 2015, in Wuhan, Barrick, together in collaboration with Dr. Zheng Li, the bad lady, they called her,
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  were able to figure out a way to augment the payload of this weapon to destroy human tissue and cause blood clots.
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:47.000]  They wrote a paper about it.
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:52.000]  They thanked the NIH, they published it, and they got patents on it.
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  And here's another layer to the story.
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  The same Ralph Barrick worked with a team from Gilead Pharmaceuticals to make remdesivir.
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:02.000]  So, every way you can see the criminal pre-planning?
[2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:05.000]  And they suppressed the antidote intentionally.
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:06.000]  And that's for themselves.
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  You think these masterminds want their own families to die?
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  Of course not.
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  They themselves know this is consistent with what I knew about the executives of...
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:24.000]  Yeah, you broke that a year ago, and Joe Rogan confirmed it, that hundreds of members of Congress in Hollywood all know about this,
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  but still want to suppress that your protocol, they were using your protocol, but they suppressed it for the general public.
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  Talk about evil.
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  Yeah, also the executives of Google, I know internally that they're all taking hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  And so, this information, the antidote to the bomb, the poison, was known, was created by the same monsters, but they hid it from you and me.
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  Now, when doctors like myself stumbled across these approaches because we had a necessity for patients who died,
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  and so we needed some help, we needed to help, we needed to treat the patients.
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  And so, immediately, anything that would help hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin,
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  and even the concept of early intervention, getting rid of this infection before the complications begin,
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  everything was vilified, marginalized, and doctors that were advocating for it were depleted.
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  I know folks, a lot of people have come and gone, but I always liked Zelenko, I really love him.
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  And I just feel joyful that he's had this great life, been such a good man.
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  I don't feel sad he's dead, because I know he lives on with us.
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:50.000]  He's just a good man, and up front fighting hard, and we look at Dr. Mercola and Dr. McCullough being attacked,
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  and we're being attacked, that's where we're supposed to be.
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  Damn it, we're men, and if we're fighting evil, we should expect to be attacked.
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:02.000]  People say, oh, I'm so sorry, they're lying about you and doing all this to you.
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  Look, I don't enjoy the attacks, I don't like them, but you know what?
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  I mean, I decided to take these people on, and I can tell you this.
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  Just like Congress will commission an officer to be in the military, you have commissioned me.
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  And I take that commission very, very seriously.
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  My biggest problem is I get mad, but I'm not doing enough, but I just want to say, all of this crew,
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  this crew is amazing, I love them all, and I love our listeners, and I love our sponsors and affiliates,
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  and I'm just so thankful to you all. Okay, here's what I'm going to do.
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  I'm not going to cut into Jay Dyer, he's got too much to cover, too much to cover.
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:48.000]  If we call Andrew back during the live show tomorrow at 11 a.m. when we take calls,
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  remember the phones up tomorrow in the live show and take calls again, and it's a Saturday uncensored show.
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  And by that, I'm not hiding any information that I won't say on the main show,
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:06.000]  but we can't show you a live abortion rally, or we can't show you what happens at these pedophile parades on our affiliates,
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:11.000]  because quite frankly, it should be illegal, but they're doing it, we're going to show you.
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  So parental discretion advised, but I say I'm going to show it, I just can't make myself.
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  I'll show some of it. The point is, 11 a.m. tomorrow, we're going live.
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  Jay Dyer's coming up. Andrew will get your number from Portland for holding for an hour.
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  If you want to call in tomorrow, we'll put you in the front of the line.
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:29.000]  If you give us your name and number, we'll call you back.
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  But great job, the crew. Now, I asked Rob to do this morning, put this together.
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  He did it hours ago, but I forgot to get to it.
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:39.000]  This is a compilation of people finally responding to lies the way they should.
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  That's coming up. Then Jay Dyer is straight ahead.
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:47.000]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow is Tuesday.
[2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:15.000]  You've got to move them out of the warehouse and be able to continue to stay on the air.
[2:58:15.000 --> 2:58:20.000]  So please take action to declare independence from the New World Order by keeping the tip of the spear on air
[2:58:20.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  and getting great products at infowarsstore.com.
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:29.000]  I want to thank you all this July 4th for your continued fight for America,
[2:58:29.000 --> 2:58:33.000]  and I would encourage you to join the fight even harder now, because we're so close to winning.
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  InfoWars.com and celebrate July 4th, 1776, part two against the New World Order,
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:47.000]  because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:58:47.000 --> 2:58:53.000]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[2:58:53.000 --> 2:58:57.000]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[2:58:57.000 --> 2:59:01.000]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[2:59:01.000 --> 2:59:04.000]  You might not agree with everything. You might not agree with all our perspectives,
[2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:06.000]  but we cover all the information.
[2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:09.000]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[2:59:09.000 --> 2:59:10.000]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:13.000]  InfoWarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions,
[2:59:13.000 --> 2:59:17.000]  InfoWarsstore.com is where to get them, folks, and we do have the best supplements.
[2:59:17.000 --> 2:59:22.000]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:26.000]  we do the best with our supplements as well.
[2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:28.000]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:31.000]  Folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:34.000]  It's 75% off. By the way, it works for me.
[2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:39.000]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[2:59:39.000 --> 2:59:42.000]  Quite well, I might add. Quite well.
[2:59:42.000 --> 2:59:45.000]  My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[2:59:45.000 --> 2:59:47.000]  I go and see him quite often now.
[2:59:47.000 --> 2:59:57.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[2:59:57.000 --> 3:00:17.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:23.000]  How much longer are we going to refer to the policy at the border as compassionate
[3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:28.000]  when this makes it clear that it is anything but?
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  Well, I think, first and foremost, we have to recognize that we are a nation of laws,
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  but we're also a nation of immigrants.
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:35.000]  Republicans talk the big game.
[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:37.000]  They say they want to make sure that we increase security.
[3:00:37.000 --> 3:00:42.000]  Well, you know what? Why don't we pass President Biden's 2023 budget?
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  Jose, hold on. I'm sorry. I got to jump in because you're going back.
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:48.000]  I'm talking about what happened with these people, right?
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:52.000]  I mean, this is the absolute opposite of compassion.
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  You know better than probably most people who cover this story.
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  The cartels are completely in charge here.
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  So we are allowing the cartels to abuse these human beings to the point of stranding them on the side of the road with absolute disregard for life.
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  It's highly possible that these young women were being trafficked for sex in the United States and beyond.
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:18.000]  When are we going to stop calling this what it is?
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  Well, look, I understand that and my heart goes out to the families that their migrants have passed.
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:28.000]  But what I can tell you is we need more resources out of the border. Republicans have blocked us.
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  This is a joke. That's a joke. That's not a real resource.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  No, that's a joke. That is not true. Come on.
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  No, no, no. No, it is not true.
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:42.000]  I have been dealing with this issue for two decades.
[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  And the fact that you can engage in these lies.
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  That's not true at all. This is ridiculous.
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:52.000]  This is a choice. It's a policy choice.
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  The Biden administration is enabling these cartels to profit from the sadness of these people.
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  They are leading to this exactly to this.
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  This blood is on your hands and you know it.
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:09.000]  And no amount of defense that you try to marshal here is going to make up for that.
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  This is the truth. The fact is you had majorities in the House and the Senate. You had the White House.
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:20.000]  You could have absolutely done whatever you wanted to do on immigration.
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  It's not true. It's not true.
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  It's in 2008.
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  That's a lie. You're engaging in a lie here.
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:30.000]  You know deep in your heart this is true.
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:34.000]  And this fact, you cannot get around it.
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  Let me fill up in here and ask one more question, guys.
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:48.000]  Jose, when you look at this situation, I can't even wrap my head around what it was like for the people who were still alive inside of this vehicle.
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:50.000]  And I want to go back to the point.
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  The idea that the White House continues to say that the border is closed is so preposterous.
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  Obviously it is not closed and obviously both sides have lost, both governments on both sides have completely lost control of what's going on at the border.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:10.000]  The cartels are running the border.
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:15.000]  Do you agree with that, Jose, that the cartels are running the border?
[3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  And what was the answer of President Trump?
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  He wanted to build a wall. He built a couple miles of wall. And guess what?
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:27.000]  What a joke. You cannot take this seriously. This is absurd.
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  He is turning this into a political game where people are dying.
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  Let me finish. Over 3,000 smugglers have passed the wall that supposedly President Trump built.
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  So look at this guy. He has engaged in leadership when people are dying.
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  This is unacceptable.
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  He is engaged in this ridiculous partisan and stupid argument that is designed to score points and not designed to stall the people in the Democratic Party.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:01.000]  I'm going to have to wrap it up because we're out of time.
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  Jose and Ben, thank you for coming, but we do have to get.
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  I agree.
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:14.000]  Jose, we have to get past the point where this is about pointing political fingers and we have to start caring about the compassion
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  that is said to be the motivation at the border has clearly failed in the most heinous way imaginable by what is happening to the lives of these poor people and these families.
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:37.000]  So we need to wake up and understand that arguing about technology or a section of wall that was built, obviously if the whole wall isn't built, the wall is not going to function and people are going to get through.
[3:04:37.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  But I hate even saying my heart goes out to these families because it sounds so trite at this point, but it absolutely does.
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:46.000]  I cannot imagine what these individuals went through.
[3:04:56.000 --> 3:05:04.000]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands of great items and then 4store.com all the storeable food.

[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:31.000]  And I'm telling you it's going to get a lot worse.
[3:05:31.000 --> 3:05:32.000]  They have designed this.

[3:05:56.000 --> 3:06:02.000]  Welcome back to the Oxygen Show.
[3:06:02.000 --> 3:06:06.000]  I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:11.000]  And today I wanted to talk about biblical signs of the end times the last days.
[3:06:11.000 --> 3:06:18.000]  I did an excellent interview a couple of days ago with the Australian journalist Maria Z.
[3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:24.000]  She does a lot of really good work in terms of exposing all of the COVID scams and the lockdowns and all that.
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:28.000]  And she asked me to come on and talk about biblical signs of the end times.
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  The Antichrist, Mark of the Beast and all that kind of stuff.
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  And I thought it would be good to kind of do an overview of what Scripture says about not just the figure of Antichrist,
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  but even types and images of the Antichrist going all the way back to the Old Testament.
[3:06:42.000 --> 3:06:44.000]  Of course we know about Nimrod, right?
[3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:51.000]  Nimrod tried to build a tower that would ascend into heaven to basically fly in the face of God.
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:06:54.000]  I don't believe that they really thought they could build a tower to heaven,
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:07:01.000]  but they thought they could build a tower in defiance of God and the worship of God towards the worship of man.
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  Saint Augustine wrote a famous book that I lectured on and did several hours of lectures through the City of God,
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:16.000]  which is one of the most famous books in the history of Western literature and the Western canon, so to speak, of Great Lit.
[3:07:16.000 --> 3:07:23.000]  And he characterizes the two cities at war in history, the City of God being God's people, the church,
[3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  and the city of man being mankind in rebellion against God, worshipping by default Satan, not necessarily directly,
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:34.000]  but indirectly even through the worship of himself.
[3:07:34.000 --> 3:07:41.000]  So the city of man, which is erected around humanism, secularism, polytheism, Satanism, you name it,
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:45.000]  versus the city of God, which is the church or God's people.
[3:07:45.000 --> 3:07:55.000]  And so as we move through all the way at the time of Genesis up into, as we said, the Tower of Babel and the events of Genesis 10,
[3:07:55.000 --> 3:08:06.000]  God confuses that situation, in other words, he gives us languages because there was an attempt to unify the world around this single beast type of system and world power.
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:16.000]  So Nimrod then becomes a type of every future sort of Antichrist until we get to the final Antichrist figure, whenever that is, at the end of days,
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:20.000]  or at the end of the world, and we don't know when that is, but we know that there will be certain signs,
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:24.000]  and that's what we're going to look at today to see what are the biblical signs, not what are the headlines,
[3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  not what are the various preachers, speculations, and end times dates, and all that kind of nonsense,
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:32.000]  but what are the actual signs that are listed.
[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:39.000]  And there's other points that I think we want to pay attention to, to see that there will be things like a one-world economic attempt,
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:44.000]  a one-world government attempt, there will be a one-world religion attempt as well.
[3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:50.000]  All of those factor very prominently into the totality of the message of Scripture both Old and New Testament when it comes to this,
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  and also the history of what the Orthodox, I'm an Orthodox person, so what are the saints of the first thousand years of the church?
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:08:59.000]  What are the theologians, the great theologians of the first thousand years of the church?
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:05.000]  What do they think about the end times, the very people who compiled the canon of Scripture in the first several centuries?
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:09.000]  What did they think would be the sign of the last days?
[3:09:09.000 --> 3:09:11.000]  So we'll look at that here in a minute.
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:15.000]  But as we come through Scripture, we see a lot of other types of the Antichrist.
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:17.000]  We think of the figure of Pharaoh, right?
[3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  Pharaoh is a perfect image of Antichrist because he's a state figure who claims to be God.
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  He sees himself as God.
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  In the Egyptian religion, Pharaoh was kind of the apex of the, you had the heavens that come down like this as a pyramid,
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:34.000]  and then the earthly rulers go up like this.
[3:09:34.000 --> 3:09:40.000]  And Pharaoh is at the middle of that apex as the bridge between heaven and earth, as God himself.
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:46.000]  So Pharaoh was a kind of a type of Antichrist in that he was an inversion of the incarnation, right?
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:48.000]  The son of God becoming man.
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  Well, Pharaoh said, no, I am the son of God. I am God. I am both man and God.
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:57.000]  That should be worshiped as the great image of the beast system or the state.
[3:09:57.000 --> 3:10:00.000]  And so he, of course, persecuted God's people, as everybody knows, in Exodus.
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  And we have the plagues, which ironically, if you look into the history of that,
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:10.000]  each plague is actually an attack on a specific Egyptian deity.
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  So there's kind of a spiritual battle of apologetics going on there in terms of the different deities that are being attacked.
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:19.000]  And so Pharaoh then is clearly a type of Antichrist.
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  There are other figures that could be types of Antichrist, not just the other pagan emperors and rulers,
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  but the figure actually of Solomon.
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:32.000]  And the reason Solomon is a curious type of Antichrist is that Solomon started out very good,
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:36.000]  as we know from the historical books of Scripture, but then he had so many wives,
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  he got into such a fascination with the ladies, we'll say,
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  that he caved in and started worshiping the gods of his wives, right?
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:51.000]  So the gods of his wives were all the surrounding pagan beliefs.
[3:10:51.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  And then he allowed that to come into Israel.
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:11:00.000]  And so we see a gradual decline in the faithfulness and the kingdom under the person of Solomon,
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:02.000]  who, as we said, begins very good.
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:09.000]  So Solomon becomes a kind of a dual type, both of the apostasy of the church that Paul talks about in 2 Thessalonians,
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:15.000]  and of the evil of the Antichrist in the sense that there's a specific text in Scripture
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  that not many people know about, where it says that Solomon brought in 666 talents of gold
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  as a sort of a tax that he would do, right?
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  And so that's, I think, a key indicator that that number, that mystical number of 666 that John talks about in the Apocalypse,
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:35.000]  we're supposed to connect that also to the idea of the apostasy of Solomon.
[3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:44.000]  And so that becomes in a nutshell also kind of a microcosm of the apostasy of the life of the nation of Israel,
[3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  who eventually goes against God in so many cases in the Old Testament,
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:53.000]  and the prophets have to call them back out of that apostasy.
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:59.000]  So we can see an image of both the false religion of the future and the false state rule or Antichrist,
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:02.000]  the beast in the figure of Solomon as well.
[3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:06.000]  Other figures like, excuse me, Nebuchadnezzar, if you read the book of Daniel,
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:10.000]  you'll notice that the great idol that Nebuchadnezzar erects and then says,
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:15.000]  you have to worship this, fall down before this, and of course everybody knows the story of Daniel and his friends,
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  they don't do it, and they're put into the fiery furnace and we see in the midst of the fiery furnace,
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:24.000]  one like the Son of Man standing amongst them.
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  That's, of course, the angel of the Lord who throughout the Old Testament is always given this form,
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:33.000]  this appearance or what's called a theophany or a manifestation,
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  and he's always distinguished from the person of God the Father throughout the Old Testament.
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  So this angel of the Lord figure, at least according to the classic Orthodox Christian interpretation
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:47.000]  of the church fathers and so forth, that is the person of Christ before his incarnation.
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:49.000]  So we see the messenger of the Lord.
[3:12:49.000 --> 3:12:52.000]  An angel doesn't always mean a creative being, it can just mean a messenger.
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:13:00.000]  The angel of the Lord, the messenger of the Lord is called God, he's called Yahweh, he's called divine,
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:05.000]  and that's who is there spoken of in the midst of the fiery furnace, the angel of the Lord.
[3:13:05.000 --> 3:13:13.000]  Now, as we go into other texts, we see other characters who, as I said, are very, very clear emblematic figures of Antichrist.
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:17.000]  One of those is in the books that are not in the Protestant canon of Scripture,
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:21.000]  but are in the Catholic and Orthodox canon of Scripture, in the books of the Maccabees.
[3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:25.000]  And we find in the books of the Maccabees this figure Antiochus Epiphanes,
[3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:32.000]  and he's important because he engages in this event that will become later cited by Christ in the Synoptic Gospels
[3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  as the abomination of desolation.
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:40.000]  It's the abomination spoken of by the prophet Daniel, and I think that Daniel is talking about,
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:47.000]  especially in those latter chapters Alexander the Great and then the people who were his sort of underlings
[3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:53.000]  who took over after him, one of whom was the most famous Antichrist figure, Antiochus Epiphanes.
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:13:57.000]  And of course, if you read the book of Maccabees, you know that Antiochus goes into the temple
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:14:02.000]  and defiles it by sacrificing a pig on the altar, viewed as an unclean animal.
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:08.000]  This is a great defilement, and it's called the abomination of that desolation that Daniel predicts.
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  So when Jesus references this in the Gospels in Matthew 24 and Luke 21,
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:21.000]  he's referring back to the text in Daniel, and he says in Luke 19 that you will see this temple raised to the ground.
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:29.000]  And even your children, there will not be one stone left upon this. This is Luke 19.
[3:14:29.000 --> 3:14:37.000]  I can barely see the, I can't see the verses here, but it's right at the end of Luke 19 right before he cleanses the temple.
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:41.000]  He says that the temple and all of its bricks will be raised to the ground.
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  And he even says that it will come upon this generation in Luke 21 because they didn't know the time of their visitation.
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:51.000]  And this was the vindication and the vengeance of all things spoken in the prophets.
[3:14:51.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  He says in Matthew 23, coming upon this generation, that is the generation standing in front of him.
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:14:58.000]  So this isn't, it was called partial preterism.
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:05.000]  The idea that a lot of the texts that are talking about the destruction of the temple will be fulfilled in 70 AD.
[3:15:05.000 --> 3:15:11.000]  And this is very important for Christian prophecy and proving Christianity because these prove that Jesus' predictions did come true.
[3:15:11.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  There is an in times fulfillment, but the immediate context, if you read Luke 19, especially Luke 21, Jesus is very clearly talking about the temple in his day.
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  He even says this temple here that you see will be raised to the ground.
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:27.000]  That will be a sign of the diaspora that occurs.
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:33.000]  That will be a sign of the judgment that's to come, the 70 AD destruction of the temple.
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  And so the character there, Titus Vespasian, is another Antichrist type of figure just like Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a Greek.
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  And now you have Titus, the Roman.
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:54.000]  So both the Greeks and the Romans engage in this profanation and this blasphemous event, which is part of those covenantal sanctions and punishments for Israel's apostasy.
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:15:56.000]  Don't go anywhere. We'll be right back.
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:15:59.000]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[3:15:59.000 --> 3:16:07.000]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[3:16:07.000 --> 3:16:13.000]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going.
[3:16:13.000 --> 3:16:21.000]  You know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins,
[3:16:21.000 --> 3:16:26.000]  plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[3:16:26.000 --> 3:16:30.000]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis.
[3:16:30.000 --> 3:16:32.000]  I have bad joints. Thanks, mom.
[3:16:32.000 --> 3:16:39.000]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[3:16:39.000 --> 3:16:43.000]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[3:16:43.000 --> 3:16:47.000]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news.
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:55.000]  Turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and Sorilis can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[3:16:55.000 --> 3:17:02.000]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[3:17:02.000 --> 3:17:06.000]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:13.000]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare, and that alone is something to be grateful for.
[3:17:13.000 --> 3:17:21.000]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[3:17:21.000 --> 3:17:27.000]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[3:17:27.000 --> 3:17:34.000]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[3:17:34.000 --> 3:17:44.000]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by having an abundance of storeable foods and water filtration.
[3:17:44.000 --> 3:17:49.000]  Whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.

[3:18:19.000 --> 3:18:27.000]  I told you over two years ago, the global is going to have massive inflation and food shortages, and it's happened just like clockwork.
[3:18:27.000 --> 3:18:30.000]  And I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse. They have designed this.
[3:18:30.000 --> 3:18:36.000]  The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued.

[3:18:55.000 --> 3:19:02.000]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire.
[3:19:02.000 --> 3:19:06.000]  And Money Magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year.
[3:19:06.000 --> 3:19:11.000]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers. 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[3:19:11.000 --> 3:19:18.000]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system
[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:21.000]  and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[3:19:21.000 --> 3:19:27.000]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[3:19:27.000 --> 3:19:32.000]  To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:37.000]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[3:19:37.000 --> 3:19:43.000]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com.
[3:19:43.000 --> 3:19:48.000]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-904-285.
[3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:58.000]  833-904-285.
[3:20:18.000 --> 3:20:22.000]  You are emblematic of Antichrist, the final Antichrist who will come.
[3:20:22.000 --> 3:20:26.000]  And we're looking for the signs that will be present when that figure emerges.
[3:20:26.000 --> 3:20:31.000]  And we can see elements of that final figure in the historical Antichrist figures that have come.
[3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:36.000]  And we're working our way up through the Old Testament and we got up to the New Testament period when we have,
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:42.000]  after Antiochus Epiphanes, there's another lesser known book, Third Maccabees that not many people know about.
[3:20:42.000 --> 3:20:48.000]  But that also describes a figure named Ptolemy, an Egyptian ruler as well, who also repeats this pattern
[3:20:48.000 --> 3:20:53.000]  of trying to profane the temple and take over and destroy Israel.
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:58.000]  And there's a specific text at the very beginning of Third Maccabees where it says that he tries to basically
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:21:05.000]  catalog and mark and track all of his empire and all of those under him.
[3:21:05.000 --> 3:21:10.000]  And that becomes another key type, historical type figure, because we know of course in Revelation 13
[3:21:10.000 --> 3:21:14.000]  that Antichrist at the end will do the same type of thing.
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:23.000]  He will try to control all commerce and all food and so forth through a mark upon every citizen in some way,
[3:21:23.000 --> 3:21:25.000]  however he may that may be.
[3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:29.000]  I think we're beginning to see inklings of that with the kinds of systems that are rolling out.
[3:21:29.000 --> 3:21:34.000]  I don't think that we're looking at the Mark of the Beast system, but it's definitely that spirit
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:38.000]  and that kind of thing that we've seen in the last few years rolling out.
[3:21:38.000 --> 3:21:45.000]  And so the reason we look at these historical patterns is to show that the spirit of Antichrist,
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:48.000]  the spirit of Satan, does the same thing over and over.
[3:21:48.000 --> 3:21:54.000]  And they try to incarnate and instantiate the same program, the same plan over and over and over.
[3:21:54.000 --> 3:21:57.000]  And that's part of the message of Scripture is telling us that very thing,
[3:21:57.000 --> 3:22:03.000]  that this demonic spirit, this power in the universe that wants to destroy man,
[3:22:03.000 --> 3:22:10.000]  that wants to basically destroy the universe, is engaged in the same playbook over and over and over
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:13.000]  and it's almost like it can't but do that.
[3:22:13.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  And so from the time of Babel and we come all the way up to the time of Christ,
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:23.000]  we see it repeated once again and Herod, the figure of Herod, becomes another version of this
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:26.000]  because if you remember, he does the same thing that Pharaoh did.
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:32.000]  He tries to have the infants murdered and ultimately we see this as he actually has them murdered.
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:37.000]  And he does this out of an attempt to destroy the lineage of the Messiah.
[3:22:37.000 --> 3:22:44.000]  I think that whether it's Pharaoh or whether it's Herod, we're told in the New Testament that the motivation
[3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:50.000]  for this going after and destroying and murdering the infants is to destroy the lineage of the Messiah,
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:53.000]  which we know would come through the Jews.
[3:22:53.000 --> 3:22:58.000]  And of course, abortion is also a satanic sacrifice just in itself,
[3:22:58.000 --> 3:23:02.000]  apart from trying to destroy the messianic lineage.
[3:23:02.000 --> 3:23:09.000]  But the main reason in Scripture is said to be that Satan wanted to get rid of the line through which the Messiah would come,
[3:23:09.000 --> 3:23:13.000]  the descendants of Abraham, the descendants of David.
[3:23:13.000 --> 3:23:20.000]  And so we can see then that repeated pattern of trying to create that world government.
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:23.000]  But another thing that comes about is, as we said, this sign.
[3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:28.000]  So the first sign is the attempt to unify everybody to destroy the church, destroy God's people.
[3:23:28.000 --> 3:23:33.000]  This attempt to subvert the church in a unique and bizarre way through,
[3:23:33.000 --> 3:23:37.000]  which we do get inklings of this, as we said, in Old Testament Israel,
[3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:42.000]  through getting the church to compromise, getting the church to water its messengers and is teaching down,
[3:23:42.000 --> 3:23:49.000]  getting them to teach doctrines that are conformable to the standards of the world and not to God's standards.
[3:23:49.000 --> 3:23:54.000]  For example, the moral decline that we've seen, these kinds of things are obvious signs.
[3:23:54.000 --> 3:23:56.000]  But of course, we've always seen that in history, right?
[3:23:56.000 --> 3:23:58.000]  So what's the real essence of the end times?
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:04.000]  Well, according to the Second Thessalonians, Paul says that the church will undergo a massive apostasy.
[3:24:04.000 --> 3:24:09.000]  We'll see more and more and more of the church caving to that idea.
[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:15.000]  And in my view, this is my opinion, based on many of the church fathers like St. Cyril of Alexandria,
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:20.000]  in a lot of his interpretation of Scripture, he believes that the largely Gentile church,
[3:24:20.000 --> 3:24:23.000]  now there have always been Jewish believers in every age of the church,
[3:24:23.000 --> 3:24:31.000]  but the idea based on Romans 11 that the largely mainly Gentile church will eventually apostatize,
[3:24:31.000 --> 3:24:36.000]  apostatize, excuse me, and then we'll begin to see more and more Jews convert to the faith
[3:24:36.000 --> 3:24:39.000]  and be grafted in according to what Paul says.
[3:24:39.000 --> 3:24:43.000]  And so this is typically even the Orthodox Church, many of its saints and elders have pointed out
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:49.000]  that one of the key signs that we would be living in the last days would be more and more Jews converting
[3:24:49.000 --> 3:24:53.000]  to authentic Christianity, in my view, Orthodox Christianity, and we would see a revival.
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:59.000]  So that is one of the signs that's listed as well as a massive apostasy of the largely Gentile church.
[3:24:59.000 --> 3:25:03.000]  Doesn't mean there won't be still Gentile believers in the end times or anything like that.
[3:25:03.000 --> 3:25:06.000]  There would be, but it's sort of a reversal, right?
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:14.000]  In the first century, you had the Jews not accepting the, on the whole, in terms of the national acceptance of the message of Christ.
[3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:18.000]  And then at the end, you kind of get a flip where most of the Gentile church,
[3:25:18.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  where Jesus talks about the times of the Gentiles coming to an end,
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:24.000]  it'll flip to where you'll have a conversion of the Jews.
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:27.000]  And I think that's what Romans 11 is talking about.
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  And so, you know, but I think both of these things are taught in Scripture.
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  I don't think that it's either or we have to fall over into these extremes that a lot of people fall over into
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:40.000]  when it comes to these sort of difficult, controversial questions.
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:45.000]  But regardless, when we've considered that figure of Antichrist,
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:50.000]  one of the key figures that we have to look at as an end times emblem would be the figure of Nero.
[3:25:50.000 --> 3:25:54.000]  I believe that there's a great book written by Dr. Ken Gentry.
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:26:01.000]  It's a PhD thesis on the dating of the book of Revelation, and it's a really strong argument that it was written prior to 180.
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:07.000]  And he argues that the best figure that in the first century fit this image of Antichrist would be Nero.
[3:26:07.000 --> 3:26:12.000]  Nero Caesar, of course, was a rabid persecutor of the church and of Christianity.
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  And one of the key indicators that this could be the case is that John in the Apocalypse is using 666 as a form of gematria.
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:25.000]  Now, I don't mean that in a weird esoteric sense, just in the sense of a code,
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:31.000]  because in the ancient world languages functioned also as their numerical indicators, right?
[3:26:31.000 --> 3:26:36.000]  So alpha would be the number one, beta would be the number two in the Greek.
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:40.000]  And so what's interesting is that there are textual variants of the Apocalypse,
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:44.000]  specifically where it mentions the 666.
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:47.000]  There's a few manuscripts that mention 616.
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:26:53.000]  And interestingly, you can tease out of that Nero Caesar in both the 666 and the 616,
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:58.000]  which is a really strong indicator that John writing in code and wanting to mention,
[3:26:58.000 --> 3:27:04.000]  you know, to the seven churches of Asia Minor, the figure of Antichrist the beast under the guys of Rome.
[3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:08.000]  And we know it's Rome because he says the city on seven hills where the beast is.
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:12.000]  He's definitely talking about, in my view, Nero Caesar.
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:17.000]  And so that's, again, a very important indicator that proves that a lot of Jesus' prophecies and predictions
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:21.000]  in Luke 21 and Matthew 24 are fulfilled in 70 AD.
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:26.000]  And that proves to us the New Testament, it proves in part the veracity of Jesus' messages,
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:28.000]  especially in the All of Ed discourse.
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:33.000]  That's why the Book of the Apocalypse, again, written to seven actual historical churches in Asia Minor.
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:35.000]  And by the way, several of those churches still exist.
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:38.000]  Several of those Orthodox churches still exist.
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:41.000]  The Orthodox Church of Ephesus traces its lineage all the way back to
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:47.000]  the time when John was writing his letters to them, the bishops of Ephesus, right?
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:52.000]  And, you know, he begins that letter by saying, these things will quickly come to pass.
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:56.000]  Well, if the book is primarily about some 2000 years later,
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:28:02.000]  it doesn't really have much reference to the people at that time who got the message that it would quickly come to pass, right?
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:05.000]  Remember, Jesus said that a lot of these things will come upon this generation.
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:12.000]  So I do think there's end times events, but I think the events of 70 AD are a type of the end time events, right?
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:13.000]  And that's the Orthodox view.
[3:28:13.000 --> 3:28:18.000]  There's a great book put out by Jordanville Monastery, which is an Orthodox monastery,
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  which is a collection of saints, elders, and church fathers on their takes from the history of the church
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:27.000]  on Antichrist and apostasy.
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  And they make this point that the destruction of the temple in 70 AD is a type of the end of the world
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:34.000]  because the temple is an emblem of the universe.
[3:28:34.000 --> 3:28:39.000]  And so it's being destroyed and raised as an emblem of the heavens and the earth being rolled up
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:42.000]  as Hebrews talks about at the end of the world, right?
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:45.000]  So it's kind of like a pre-signifier of the end times.
[3:28:45.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  And we can look at other figures like Nero and so forth as a final Antichrist,
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:28:55.000]  just as we saw that mirroring event going back to Antiochus and others in the past.
[3:28:55.000 --> 3:29:04.000]  That's just Susan's new film, 2000 Mules, is the most important documentary in modern times because it proves how the deep state
[3:29:04.000 --> 3:29:10.000]  stole the 2020 election and how they're planning to steal future elections and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.

[3:32:56.000 --> 3:33:03.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:12.000 --> 3:33:16.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. This is your guest host, Jay Dyer and Jay Zinolf.
[3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:22.000]  We're talking about end times. We're talking about Antichrist and specifically the biblical signs of the end times, what those would be.
[3:33:22.000 --> 3:33:30.000]  And we were looking at different historical figures who were types of Antichrist and we had just gotten to the figure of Nero, Nero Caesar,
[3:33:30.000 --> 3:33:44.000]  who heavily persecuted the church right around the time of John the Revelator and the time of the destruction of the temple in 70 AD,
[3:33:44.000 --> 3:33:51.000]  where his general Titus of Aspation comes in and destroys the temple in much the same fashion as Antiochus Epiphanes had done
[3:33:51.000 --> 3:33:57.000]  and all the way back to the Babylonians who sacked the temple first back in 586 BC.
[3:33:57.000 --> 3:34:04.000]  So we're seeing this repeated pattern and if you read 2 Thessalonians, Paul goes on to talk about the other element that we've got to get to,
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:11.000]  which is the end times delusion. What is that? Well, he says that before the coming of Antichrist,
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:18.000]  he says there will be an apostasy and he talks about a falling away and this will reveal the man of sin.
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:26.000]  He says that the man of sin will exalt himself and oppose himself to all gods and all figures and all entities or anything called God.
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  So that he will sit in the temple and proclaim himself to be God.
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:36.000]  Now in the history of the church, there have been all the way back for 2000 years, there have been basically two different interpretations of this text.
[3:34:36.000 --> 3:34:44.000]  I don't have any certainty. I mean, I could see either one of them being true. One of them is the idea that there will be an actual third temple rebuilt
[3:34:44.000 --> 3:34:51.000]  and that that would be the temple that Antichrist would stand up in and proclaim himself to be God in.
[3:34:51.000 --> 3:34:59.000]  The other view is that the temple of God here is symbolically speaking of the church, the church as God's true new temple,
[3:34:59.000 --> 3:35:04.000]  and that it would be a figure who invades the church, so to speak, and calls himself God.
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:13.000]  Either one, I think, is possible and makes sense. Many of the church fathers do tend to think that a new rebuilt temple would be the actual sign of Antichrist.
[3:35:13.000 --> 3:35:22.000]  And so many of the Orthodox elders and church fathers and saints do make this point to say that if you're looking for a couple of the key signs of the final, final end times,
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  one of those would be the move towards a world religion. One of those would be the move towards a world state.
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:34.000]  One of those would be the persecution and shutting down of classical traditional Christianity in all forms.
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:43.000]  And another one of those would be the attempt to subvert the church and turn it into a world religion and to control and track and trace everybody's
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:51.000]  moves, everybody's economic transactions and so forth. So those are the key signs and then the last one being conversion of the Jews.
[3:35:51.000 --> 3:35:58.000]  So according to Orthodoxy, that's our view. We think that those are the real signs. Are we in the last days? I don't know. I can't say.
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:06.000]  That's not my position to say. But I can say that these are the signs that we should look for, and these are the ones that I think Scripture talks about.
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:13.000]  And the most fascinating here is this idea of the complete leaving of Christianity by the nations, right?
[3:36:13.000 --> 3:36:22.000]  We have this idea that there will be a great falling away, a great apostasy, presumably amongst profession Christianity, to accept some kind of
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:30.000]  world religion, some kind of new age, presumably type of thing. In the apocalypse, we have this important figure who is the false prophet.
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:39.000]  And we don't exactly know who it is or what it is, but it seems to be a figure who has the ability to deceive the nations in a religious way,
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:48.000]  whereas Antichrist is specifically a state figure, right? And we know that in the apocalypse, there's this period where it says that the whore,
[3:36:48.000 --> 3:36:56.000]  this false religion rides the beast. And so they're allied for a time period at the end. And then it says that Antichrist decides to cast off the woman,
[3:36:56.000 --> 3:37:03.000]  doesn't need her anymore, and proclaims himself to be God, right? So there's this period where there's a sort of false union,
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:11.000]  oh, let's all love each other and we're going to, you know, bring world peace and this kind of stuff. And the false prophet, this sort of
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  false religious leader of the end times, deceives the nations and points them to Antichrist, and then eventually Antichrist says,
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:24.000]  I'm done with you, I don't need you, I don't need your stupid fake religion. I'm the true God here, right? And I think that's what Paul's getting at here,
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:34.000]  this final act of blasphemy. And we get really clear indicators here in the apocalypse that this is an intentional inversion of the incarnation.
[3:37:34.000 --> 3:37:41.000]  So if you remember, Jesus becoming incarnate at his first advent, right, coming to earth, the second person that God had becoming man,
[3:37:41.000 --> 3:37:50.000]  living his life on earth, teaching us dying for redemption, for our sins, to bring us to the resurrection. We get an inversion of that in the
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  apocalypse with the figure of Antichrist, who instead of claiming to be God is essentially demonically possessed, many of the church fathers say,
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:08.000]  and that's the source of his charisma and his ability to charm the nations and whatnot. And he sort of mimics the life of Christ in many ways,
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:16.000]  even to the point of an apparent wound where he revives from, and by the way, there was an event in Nero's life where something like this happened,
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:23.000]  whether it's a complete deception, or whether it's some demonic event or miracle, or who knows, an evil miracle, we don't know,
[3:38:23.000 --> 3:38:31.000]  but it's something like that, where again, it mimics the life of Christ, right, to survive some sort of death type of experience,
[3:38:31.000 --> 3:38:38.000]  or to come back from the dead. But we're told that, of course, he deceives the nations through all kinds of lying signs and wonders.
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  And the religion of Antichrist does the same thing, right, it points to him and it involves a mass deception. It could be something like what we see with the
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:55.000]  New Age and the Gurus and all the, you know, Madame Blavatsky's great wide brotherhood and my tray, it could be something like that.
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:39:04.000]  It could be a thing that has yet to come that we haven't seen yet. It could be something, you know, related to the so-called discovery of offworld entities or aliens,
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  right, it could be a new alien deception, we don't know, right, it might be 500 years from now, it might be a thousand years, we don't know,
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:18.000]  but whatever or whenever it comes, we will definitely see those signs of a new type of religion, probably masquerading as Paul seems to say here,
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  under the guise of a new type of Christianity, a new universal religion, very plausible too, that it could be a pope type of figure.
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:36.000]  I don't think the present pope is the Antichrist or the false prophet, I'm not saying that, but it could be something like that in the future of a fallen away global world religion
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:46.000]  that then seeks to turn everyone not to Jesus, but to some new kind of state run religion or something like that.
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:51.000]  They might try to tie it into transhumanism and a new type of promise of immortality, right.
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:40:04.000]  So I think that when we look for the fact that, look at the fact that we're told that Antichrist and the final deception will really involve a mimicking of Christianity,
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  we can begin to look for the patterns and the signs of what historic Christianity teaches and offers, and then we'll see that the end times deception is the mimic of that,
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:26.000]  it's the cheap copy of that, that for example, as we said, eternal life through technology and transhumanism, solving all the economic crises and poverty through tracking and tracing.
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:34.000]  If we could just track and trace everything and then we could create a fair world order, something like that, the idea of the world religion.
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:44.000]  We don't need dogmas anymore, we don't need the Bible and Trinity and those boring old dusty doctrines, what we need is something new about the inner Christ, the inner God,
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:49.000]  the inner spirit, the inner consciousness, you know, could be anything like that.
[3:40:49.000 --> 3:40:58.000]  Meditate, it could be, you know, the alien space brothers or the Bible's really agnostic text about the alien space brothers, who knows, it could be any of those things.
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:07.000]  But all of those things tend to, what we do see is that there's always a convergence, right, the convergence towards, if we only got rid of nation states,
[3:41:07.000 --> 3:41:16.000]  if we only got rid of families, if we only got rid of these patriarchal oppressive things, then we could have true equality,
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:31.000]  liberty, equality and fraternity, right, the illuminous dictum. If we could have those things, then we would all be free from the, what does Psalm 2 say, you know, the nation's rage, how can we be free from the cords of the Lord and His Messiah, right, in Psalm 2.
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  So that's the spirit of Antichrist there, again, manifested clearly at the end in this move towards the resurrection of Babel.
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:48.000]  And remember that it's just like in what did Jesus say in the days of Noah, right, right around the same time, you have the Nimrod Babel situation.
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  Well, the end in times, we'll see very similar situations where there will be an attempt towards this global order, a Babel, a tower, a Babel type of thing.
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:07.000]  And that's what all those previous empires had tried to do. You ever wonder why all the ancient world empires tried to do the exact same thing?
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:18.000]  Why would they try to exalt the emperor as the God figure? Why did they try to create one world order? Why did they try to create one imperial religion?
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  Why did they do all those things? Well, because they were motivated by the same spirit, the same demonic entity. Satan was behind those world religions, that's what I'm trying to say, right, or those imperial world religions, I should say.
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  And then it doesn't change until, according to Daniel 2, in the Roman Empire, the Messiah is born, and this crushes that fourth empire, that empire, which is Rome.
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:52.000]  That's the empire under which Jesus was born. It's not an end times empire. Daniel 2 is talking about the birth of the Messiah in the Roman Empire, which happened at his first advent.
[3:42:52.000 --> 3:42:56.000]  And then he sets up his kingdom, which will never be destroyed, and which will overtake the rest of the kingdom.

[3:47:12.000 --> 3:47:17.000]  Welcome back to The Ocean Show. I'm Jay Dyer, your guest host for the fourth hour here.
[3:47:17.000 --> 3:47:25.000]  We were talking about signs of the end times, the types of Antichrist, and what are the authentic biblical patterns that we should look for?
[3:47:25.000 --> 3:47:28.000]  And of course, as many others, I was just trying to boil it down to some of the key ones.
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:36.000]  We know about, you know, there would be plagues and famines and all those kinds of things, sure, but they're real key stuff because those always exist, right?
[3:47:36.000 --> 3:47:48.000]  But I think that we have to look for other key indicators that don't always exist, such as the conversion of the Jews, such as a massive apostasy of Christianity,
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:56.000]  an attempt to create a one-world religion that is in ways patterned on or similar to Christianity, but more of a pseudo-Christianity,
[3:47:56.000 --> 3:48:03.000]  more of a pseudo-universal religion that kind of probably integrates all of the religious leaders and all the cults.
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:10.000]  And cults are another thing, like the explosion of false religions, explosions of cults, explosions of demonic activities, Satanism.
[3:48:10.000 --> 3:48:16.000]  I think all of these would be under that umbrella of a false end times religion that we should look for.
[3:48:16.000 --> 3:48:22.000]  The mark of the beast, whatever that will be, some sort of chips, some sort of nanotech.
[3:48:22.000 --> 3:48:25.000]  We don't know yet a future thing that's coming.
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:29.000]  I definitely think, as you said, that last couple years, we see a pattern or type of that kind of thing.
[3:48:29.000 --> 3:48:36.000]  And again, if you're looking for really good proof that the biblical theology is true, we don't have to look much further than the fact that,
[3:48:36.000 --> 3:48:43.000]  doesn't it seem to accurately describe this recurring pattern in history and that it will occur again, right?
[3:48:43.000 --> 3:48:50.000]  Talking about the attempt to create a one-world religion, a one-world currency, a one-world government, all under the aegis of nothing to do with Jesus.
[3:48:50.000 --> 3:48:56.000]  So just make sure you get rid of him or rebrand him into something a little more palatable, right?
[3:48:56.000 --> 3:49:01.000]  Cut out a lot of those texts where he talks about, you know, John 14.6 being the way the truth in life.
[3:49:01.000 --> 3:49:03.000]  None of that stuff, right?
[3:49:03.000 --> 3:49:05.000]  Just make it like Christ's consciousness.
[3:49:05.000 --> 3:49:09.000]  And he's one of the many avatars and one of the many world teachers, right?
[3:49:09.000 --> 3:49:13.000]  This is the ecuminous New Age religion of the Rockefellers.
[3:49:13.000 --> 3:49:18.000]  We're really into advocating and promoting according to their authorized biography.
[3:49:18.000 --> 3:49:21.000]  So those are the key signs to look for.
[3:49:21.000 --> 3:49:26.000]  And I don't think we have to get too crazy into the speculations about dates and this kind of stuff.
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:32.000]  We don't need to know the date and the hour because we know the signs that will precede that final end times situation.
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:34.000]  Obviously, there'll be a lot of persecution.
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:37.000]  There will be a lot of martyrs of real authentic Christianity.
[3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:42.000]  And then we have the final, you know, resurrection and the great white throne judgment,
[3:49:42.000 --> 3:49:47.000]  which the last few chapters of the Apocalypse talk about as a future-oriented scenario.
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:52.000]  So that's my take on that. As I said, a really good book, if you want to go further into this,
[3:49:52.000 --> 3:49:55.000]  is Dr. Ken Gentry's book Before Jerusalem Fell.
[3:49:55.000 --> 3:50:00.000]  There's a really good commentary written by a guy who was kind of into the Anglican sphere of theology
[3:50:00.000 --> 3:50:03.000]  and was getting really close to becoming orthodox towards the end of his life.
[3:50:03.000 --> 3:50:05.000]  But he died before that.
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:08.000]  A guy named David Chilton wrote a really good book called Days of Vengeance,
[3:50:08.000 --> 3:50:13.000]  which is a really excellent long commentary on the book of the Apocalypse.
[3:50:13.000 --> 3:50:18.000]  There's another book by Milton Terry called Biblical Apocalyptics or George Peter Holford's book
[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:22.000]  The Destruction of Jerusalem or David Chilton's book Paradise Restored.
[3:50:22.000 --> 3:50:27.000]  Those are all texts that I really recommend that have influenced me quite a bit.
[3:50:27.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  And to really show the orthodox view, I would say look at the sermons of St. John Chrysostom on Matthew 24
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:38.000]  or the teachings of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, as well as St. Cyril of Alexandria.
[3:50:38.000 --> 3:50:43.000]  Those church fathers discussed these topics in good depth.
[3:50:43.000 --> 3:50:48.000]  But I also want to note that to change it up a little bit, although it's kind of related to this,
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:51.000]  my third book is about to come out.
[3:50:51.000 --> 3:50:57.000]  It just went to the printer a couple of days ago, so it should be arriving in the next week or two.
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:51:00.000]  And I'm happy to say that this is a little different.
[3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:04.000]  Everybody knows that if you like my stuff, if you've not seen my first two books,
[3:51:04.000 --> 3:51:09.000]  I dealt with Hollywood, Esoteric Hollywood 1 and 2, where we covered a lot of movies and directors
[3:51:09.000 --> 3:51:12.000]  and inside stuff relating to Hollywood.
[3:51:12.000 --> 3:51:18.000]  And I'd written most of those articles 10, 11 years ago, so they ended up being in a weird way,
[3:51:18.000 --> 3:51:20.000]  in a providential way, kind of prophetic.
[3:51:20.000 --> 3:51:22.000]  I'm not saying I'm a prophet, I'm not.
[3:51:22.000 --> 3:51:31.000]  Because I talked about a lot of the Hollywood-style scandals and the blackmail networks that we see
[3:51:31.000 --> 3:51:34.000]  for now that have been talked about a lot in the last few years.
[3:51:34.000 --> 3:51:38.000]  I had covered a lot of that stuff in my book many years ago.
[3:51:38.000 --> 3:51:43.000]  And so a lot of my theories and a lot of my analyses have proven to, I think, correct.
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:47.000]  It's a little different because over the years, I've had a lot of people say,
[3:51:47.000 --> 3:51:50.000]  hey, I'm really interested in a lot of the philosophy that you talk about,
[3:51:50.000 --> 3:51:53.000]  a lot of the geopolitics that you talk about,
[3:51:53.000 --> 3:51:58.000]  a lot of the apologetic argumentation against atheism, against logical fallacies.
[3:51:58.000 --> 3:52:03.000]  What about that stuff? Hollywood is fun and that's neat to talk about that in the movie symbolism.
[3:52:03.000 --> 3:52:11.000]  So people have asked for introductions to philosophy, introductions to analyzing literature and symbols
[3:52:11.000 --> 3:52:13.000]  and movies the way that I do that, and how do you do that?
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:15.000]  What's your approach? What's your pattern?
[3:52:15.000 --> 3:52:17.000]  Well, I decided to write a book on that.
[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:25.000]  And so it's a very readable, I call it an educated person's introduction to philosophical thinking.
[3:52:25.000 --> 3:52:27.000]  So it's not a philosophy textbook.
[3:52:27.000 --> 3:52:33.000]  It's not a boring, dry thing where you're going to have to try to memorize a bunch of stuff.
[3:52:33.000 --> 3:52:37.000]  It's more so, again, a readable introduction to philosophical thinking,
[3:52:37.000 --> 3:52:42.000]  to how to do critical thinking, to how to analyze works of literature or movies,
[3:52:42.000 --> 3:52:46.000]  because if you're doing a reading a book and decoding the symbolism,
[3:52:46.000 --> 3:52:49.000]  it's not much different than watching a movie and decoding the symbolism.
[3:52:49.000 --> 3:52:51.000]  It's just different mediums, right?
[3:52:51.000 --> 3:52:56.000]  So it's called meta-narratives and it's essays in philosophy and symbolism
[3:52:56.000 --> 3:53:00.000]  and the final copy and all that's been, as I said, sent to the printer.
[3:53:00.000 --> 3:53:05.000]  And so basically we go through the first few chapters talking about what metaphysics is
[3:53:05.000 --> 3:53:08.000]  and why this has been discarded from philosophy and education.
[3:53:08.000 --> 3:53:12.000]  It's something that the ancient and medieval world were very fond of.
[3:53:12.000 --> 3:53:16.000]  And because of the predominance of atheism and materialism,
[3:53:16.000 --> 3:53:19.000]  metaphysics has pretty much been done away with, right?
[3:53:19.000 --> 3:53:24.000]  Soul, mind, abstract objects, God, angels, those things are all superstition.
[3:53:24.000 --> 3:53:28.000]  We've done away with all that. We're smart, rationalistic, atheist now.
[3:53:28.000 --> 3:53:32.000]  We don't need any of that gibber jabber, but is that really sensible?
[3:53:32.000 --> 3:53:36.000]  So I go through a heavy critique of the scientific worldview,
[3:53:36.000 --> 3:53:41.000]  not science, but scientism and the worldview of scientism in the first few chapters.
[3:53:41.000 --> 3:53:43.000]  I go into explaining metaphysics.
[3:53:43.000 --> 3:53:46.000]  I go into ancient, famous texts of philosophy that are really insightful,
[3:53:46.000 --> 3:53:51.000]  that have kind of been suppressed in academia like Plato's Timaeus,
[3:53:51.000 --> 3:53:55.000]  Plato's Faedo. These are famous philosophical essays and dialogues
[3:53:55.000 --> 3:53:58.000]  that don't get a lot of coverage even in academia.
[3:53:58.000 --> 3:54:02.000]  Why? In my view, because they point us to the transcendent.
[3:54:02.000 --> 3:54:07.000]  They point us to God. They point us to divine things beyond just the here and the now.
[3:54:07.000 --> 3:54:11.000]  So clearly academia is not going to be that interested in that because they have an agenda.
[3:54:11.000 --> 3:54:18.000]  Academia is bought off and paid for and under the ages of the same globalist agenda,
[3:54:18.000 --> 3:54:21.000]  that we've been talking about for so long as all of the other areas of life.
[3:54:21.000 --> 3:54:27.000]  So you're not going to get that great of a philosophical education unless you were specialized in Plato.
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:29.000]  Then you might go into these kinds of things.
[3:54:29.000 --> 3:54:36.000]  So I have essays where I go into that and kind of decoding and bringing out the ancient archetypal symbols
[3:54:36.000 --> 3:54:42.000]  and patterns that we see in the ancient Greek philosophy from Plato and Aristotle.
[3:54:42.000 --> 3:54:48.000]  I go into heavy critiques of Darwinism and the materialist philosophy that's out there.
[3:54:48.000 --> 3:54:54.000]  So I utilize quite a few philosophers from both Orthodox tradition, Catholic tradition as well,
[3:54:54.000 --> 3:54:59.000]  Protestants as well. They all kind of come into this work where I see good arguments that are there.
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:03.000]  So even though it's not an argument, it's not a book about proving God,
[3:55:03.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  it's more of a preparatory book on beginning to think in different ways.
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:14.000]  We alter our paradigm and think and look at the world in a different way to change our paradigm.
[3:55:14.000 --> 3:55:17.000]  I don't just automatically jump into arguing for God or anything like that.
[3:55:17.000 --> 3:55:23.000]  I do bring that up, but it's not primarily an apologetics book or a book about the transcendental argument for God.
[3:55:23.000 --> 3:55:27.000]  It's more of a preparatory book for how to start thinking in that way,
[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:34.000]  and it does include some elements of, as I said, critiquing Darwinism, critiquing scientism, critiquing atheism,
[3:55:34.000 --> 3:55:37.000]  and those prevalent things that are out there, especially empiricism.
[3:55:37.000 --> 3:55:43.000]  I've got several chapters critiquing that. There's a chapter critiquing David Hume, critiquing Kant,
[3:55:43.000 --> 3:55:48.000]  and then the Frankfurt School. There's critiques of Nietzsche as well,
[3:55:48.000 --> 3:55:54.000]  and a positive appraisal of people like Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard.
[3:55:54.000 --> 3:55:57.000]  So you might think, well, it's not anti all the philosophers.
[3:55:57.000 --> 3:56:00.000]  I bring out some of the good elements in Kierkegaard and Nietzsche.
[3:56:00.000 --> 3:56:08.000]  There's a really in-depth chapter on Dostoevsky. How would we find parallels and insights into human psychology,
[3:56:08.000 --> 3:56:12.000]  even in literature from somebody like Dostoevsky?
[3:56:12.000 --> 3:56:17.000]  I go into Egyptian philosophy and how they viewed the universe and its structure
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:20.000]  and what insights we might even draw out of that.
[3:56:20.000 --> 3:56:26.000]  And then there's even a chapter on Machiavelli who wrote a book that not many people know about called Art of War.
[3:56:26.000 --> 3:56:30.000]  Not the same thing as Sun, Zeus, Art of War. It's a different book. Everybody knows about Machiavelli's prints,
[3:56:30.000 --> 3:56:36.000]  but not many people know he wrote another book about warfare, which actually was very important in terms of setting the stage
[3:56:36.000 --> 3:56:40.000]  for the revolution out of medieval warfare into modern warfare.
[3:56:40.000 --> 3:56:45.000]  And that's important to go into because one of the most famous books talks about false flags.
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:53.000]  So I try to bring in even the metaphysics or the higher level analysis of geopolitics as well.
[3:56:53.000 --> 3:56:57.000]  It's not primarily a geopolitics book, but that's what it is. You want to get the pre-orders of that.
[3:56:57.000 --> 3:57:02.000]  We'll be out in the next couple of weeks. You can go to my website. The link is there at the top of the website for pre-orders.
[3:57:02.000 --> 3:57:07.000]  All the copies from my website are signed and we're going to be having a Nashville event.
[3:57:07.000 --> 3:57:13.000]  So if you live in the Nashville area, go to my social medias. I think around July 30th, maybe August 6th,
[3:57:13.000 --> 3:57:19.000]  we're going to have an event. It'll be a ticketed event. And so look for the exact date. I'll put it up.
[3:57:19.000 --> 3:57:25.000]  It'll be a speaking event. It'll be a lot of fun. You can come on out if you're in the Nashville area in about a month on a Saturday.
[3:57:25.000 --> 3:57:30.000]  And I'll be talking about the book. I'll be acting silly. I'll be doing all the impressions that you're used to.
[3:57:30.000 --> 3:57:38.000]  So hopefully it'll be a fun event. I'll speak to this again when we have a venue locked down in the next couple of weeks.
[3:57:38.000 --> 3:57:45.000]  And it'll be about a month out. So follow me on social medias if you want to come out to the speaking event.
[3:57:45.000 --> 3:57:53.000]  The National Suisse's new film 2000 Mules is the most important documentary in modern times because it proves how the deep state
[3:57:53.000 --> 3:57:59.000]  stole the 2020 election and how they're planning to steal future elections and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
