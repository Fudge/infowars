[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:40.400]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:42.720 --> 00:48.160]  ladies and gentlemen I do not let the music play out sometimes at the start of a broadcast
[00:49.280 --> 00:59.440]  to try to peak peak your your entrance the it is not a dramatic flourish that I am engaging in
[01:00.160 --> 01:06.560]  I am so busy during the breaks and right before the show feverishly looking over all of the
[01:06.560 --> 01:14.640]  unbelievably important news that I I have to be flogged into my chair to begin the
[01:14.640 --> 01:22.160]  transmission so again thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday the 23rd day of July
[01:22.160 --> 01:31.120]  2013 the day after the momentous birth of the future king of England counter Dracula the 27th
[01:31.120 --> 01:38.080]  the parasitic rule vestige the whole world rejoicing of a hereditary dictatorship I want
[01:38.080 --> 01:45.200]  to know why there's not tea cups with Kim Jong-un on them and why you know when he marries there
[01:45.200 --> 01:52.720]  needs to be the royal baby the royal baby was about to be born but I need to get over that now
[01:52.720 --> 01:58.240]  it's just I'm being bombarded with race warfare constantly by the establishment which is a British
[01:58.240 --> 02:05.520]  globalist divide and conquer technique and then and then being taught to love people riding around
[02:05.520 --> 02:13.520]  in disneyland carriages and and and to watch women mainly fawning everywhere live of the queen
[02:13.520 --> 02:19.360]  you know they have no idea how evil and wicked those people are and that Seville the admitted
[02:19.360 --> 02:25.520]  necrophiliac pedophile was their best friend it would bring them special goodies and then I have
[02:25.520 --> 02:33.280]  to watch them being worshipped everywhere it is just beyond disgusting and makes me want to vomit
[02:37.040 --> 02:40.080]  and it just makes me want to throw out an exploitative I've decided the new exploitative
[02:40.080 --> 02:47.840]  I'm going to use the FCC may find me for is Joe Biden by Joe Biden you've done it I've decided
[02:47.840 --> 02:52.960]  that that that's like a profanity now like if I slam my hand in the door I'm but it's only
[02:52.960 --> 02:57.680]  profanity if you say the word Joe Biden in a British accent if you swim it makes no sense
[02:57.680 --> 03:04.320]  it's nonsensical I'm probably developing some type of syndrome but the point is I just want to
[03:04.320 --> 03:12.160]  say over and over again Joe Biden whatever we're going to go to break and come back here because
[03:12.160 --> 03:16.960]  you know why do we do this why is there a weird five-minute segment we started eight after everybody
[03:16.960 --> 03:21.680]  else starts at six or seven after because I didn't like running network news on my show going back
[03:21.680 --> 03:26.400]  16 years ago when it got syndicated and they said fine do the five minutes we'll have a different
[03:26.400 --> 03:32.880]  clock but I keep saying we're going to do this the time has come the time has come now that we
[03:32.880 --> 03:38.720]  must go to the regular clock at least the start of the hour so I guess I need to just make that
[03:38.720 --> 03:44.960]  decision and go with we put feelers out to our our radio affiliates asking what they think and
[03:45.920 --> 03:49.440]  we're going to be doing that soon because it's almost like a false start or something
[03:49.440 --> 03:54.320]  I realized some listeners cannot hear us on AM and FM and things when I come in in this segment and
[03:54.320 --> 04:03.680]  so maybe now I'll just play like elevator music I just just looped in a British accent Joe Biden
[04:03.680 --> 04:14.000]  Joe Biden Joe Biden Joe Biden look the whole place that that comes from ladies and gentlemen
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.960]  is I did a little video last night we played a clip from this tv series back in the 80s v
[04:18.960 --> 04:24.400]  where the two babies are born and I said it basically Kate Middleton actually the Duchess
[04:24.400 --> 04:31.440]  of Cambridge excuse me had actually given birth to two clones of Joe Biden and Barack Obama
[04:31.440 --> 04:36.800]  and when the Joe Biden baby comes out he has a little snake tongue shoots out and I say Joe Biden
[04:37.840 --> 04:41.040]  right there at that point you know as I'm announcing them like whenever they have
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.800]  people at these Washingtoners walk in they'll announce who's been knighted and it's like oh

[08:38.720 --> 08:43.920]  2013 we have one of the national leaders and the head of the houston new black panther party
[08:43.920 --> 08:52.640]  quantel x joining us quantel x has actually been on the broadcast before because even though i
[08:52.640 --> 08:58.800]  disagree with a lot of his statements and politics um he is one of the only people that would stand
[08:58.800 --> 09:05.600]  up say when black people are having their children taken for no reason other than the fact that they
[09:05.600 --> 09:12.400]  are poor and the dad works two jobs the cps now nationwide says that being poor is a reason to
[09:12.400 --> 09:19.920]  have your children taken no drugs no abuse no nothing plenty of food healthy oh my gosh uh
[09:19.920 --> 09:24.880]  you know you live in a little house at the storage facility and you're the manager of the
[09:24.880 --> 09:29.920]  storage facility and kind of the night watchman and then you also mow yards in the area and you're
[09:29.920 --> 09:35.520]  married and have four kids we're going to take them all and then who went and raised a stink
[09:35.520 --> 09:42.240]  about it we sent reporters confirmed it quantel x and quantel x uh you know i liken him to basically
[09:42.800 --> 09:47.680]  a black clan member i mean it's it's the same it's kind of statements but it's from a black
[09:47.680 --> 09:56.480]  perspective so i'm i'm i'm going to ask quantel x today uh when he comes on the air uh is there
[09:56.480 --> 10:01.200]  anything in this world outside of black and white does he know that white people are about seven
[10:01.200 --> 10:05.520]  percent of the world population as you know all over the world there's just human beings going
[10:05.520 --> 10:12.080]  through the same tyranny under the global new world order or is it just too fun to get into
[10:12.080 --> 10:18.080]  this whole race game and play along with it so quantel x and you've had the big demonstrations
[10:18.080 --> 10:23.600]  he's had with the folks with the guns they've got guns the the pros everyone people have got guns
[10:24.560 --> 10:29.040]  it is it is pretty serious stuff by the way there's a story up on info wars.com
[10:29.040 --> 10:34.240]  it's also up on drudgereport.com that's where we found it from gateway pundit and they did some
[10:34.240 --> 10:39.920]  great research and i've got adan salazar doing a report on this to show some background because
[10:39.920 --> 10:45.600]  this is a great report but what we always do at info wars.com is we show you the just department's
[10:45.600 --> 10:53.440]  own numbers where they admit 90 plus percent of so-called hate crimes you can look this up it's
[10:53.440 --> 11:01.040]  a major phenomenon in the last 30 years or so are committed by the jewish synagogue itself
[11:01.040 --> 11:07.840]  against itself or the black students against themselves as a attention getting thing you
[11:07.840 --> 11:12.960]  can become a movie star basically and be all over the news and then you know not have to do your
[11:12.960 --> 11:16.720]  finals if it can always happens right before finals people are freaked out what do they do
[11:17.760 --> 11:21.200]  the old days they you know somebody stage a car wreck to get out of finals or whatever
[11:21.200 --> 11:25.440]  you know being so nervous or whatever about it now you just spray paint a swastika or you
[11:25.440 --> 11:30.320]  burn a cross in your own front yard or you burn the local black church down and then say you saw
[11:30.320 --> 11:36.960]  white guys doing it or you carve uh you know on your face uh the kkk and you're black or they've
[11:36.960 --> 11:43.280]  had white women carve obama on their face and then say black men did it i mean this is this is
[11:43.280 --> 11:50.800]  uh whites do it too it's it's a it's a it's a false flag self-inflicted wound staged event
[11:51.840 --> 11:56.560]  where you try to frame people and and i could take one look at the woman and i even said this
[11:56.560 --> 12:01.600]  yesterday to the crew you could take one look at the woman and again we're doing our own article
[12:01.600 --> 12:06.880]  on this that shows their report but shows some background on this left-wing plant at houston
[12:06.880 --> 12:11.920]  prozeman rally is far left activist and they've confirmed her name and who she works with
[12:11.920 --> 12:19.440]  and that she went out with a sign uh it appears the other leftist left her alone and the national
[12:19.440 --> 12:25.600]  media zoomed in on we're racist and proud and the media went with it didn't go over and ask her
[12:25.600 --> 12:32.960]  msnbc and others hey uh the houston chronicle didn't go over and ask her hey is this for real
[12:33.680 --> 12:39.040]  no one did that in fact one more thing for adon to add if he's listening add not once not twice
[12:39.040 --> 12:43.760]  not three times four times i can remember they would have people dress up in john deere hats
[12:44.800 --> 12:53.040]  wear overalls and go out and say i love rand paul and i hate black inwards and makins
[12:54.320 --> 13:02.240]  and over and over again they had signs all of it saying i'm with the kkk and i like rand paul
[13:02.880 --> 13:07.200]  remember three years ago when he was running for the senate and winning i don't believe that many
[13:07.200 --> 13:14.400]  years has already passed the point is is that they did the folks i i have been doing a pro gun
[13:14.400 --> 13:18.320]  rally before mike hanson by the way has the footage all this we're digging it out a few weeks
[13:18.320 --> 13:21.360]  from now he's going to bring me a big thing of archives we're going to dig through it i'm going
[13:21.360 --> 13:26.080]  to put all this stuff on the web where we'd be at a rally and there'd be guys show up in kook looks
[13:26.080 --> 13:32.240]  plan outfits and i'd fall into their car and i'd go that's a democratic party union sticker you
[13:32.240 --> 13:37.440]  guys for democrats they'd be like if you jones we're going to get you i mean i've got this kind
[13:37.440 --> 13:44.080]  of stuff on tape just bombshell i've been through this over and over it's theater ladies and gentlemen
[13:46.080 --> 13:50.000]  yeah hit refresh on that guy so it'll actually come up with a photo or give me a document cam and
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.240]  i'll uh actually show uh tv viewers what i'm talking about yeah yeah we can document cam right in here
[13:56.240 --> 14:02.960]  and i'll uh i'll pull this up for people left wing plant at houston pros amendment rally is far left
[14:02.960 --> 14:07.680]  activist oh i see you were pulling up sorry about ram paul good job yeah there it is we're racist and
[14:07.680 --> 14:14.000]  proud i mean why didn't other reporters from the tea party groups that were there go over and and say
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.560]  hey you're fake and and and they're so disdainful folks they'll they'll tell you their fake to your
[14:20.560 --> 14:28.560]  face and then laugh at you so here's a false flag by the way george zimmerman
[14:30.320 --> 14:37.120]  a suv turned over and had gas leaking and he ran over with a fire extinguisher
[14:37.120 --> 14:42.320]  and drug the people out of the car it's funny saturday i was driving back from the coast and
[14:42.320 --> 14:48.080]  this guy was about 30 40 runs a red light smashes this whole lady t bonzer i was three cars back
[14:48.080 --> 14:53.440]  but i stopped his witnesses were needed till the police got there i'm not some hero but i did see
[14:53.440 --> 14:58.240]  that people that were closer to the crash than i was just drove on by and by the way that's illegal
[14:58.960 --> 15:06.000]  in texas and it should be illegal failure to render aid is unbelievably disgusting uh if if people
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.200]  need help and uh small ladies that were right in front of me they stopped were helping some cars
[15:11.200 --> 15:18.960]  around that they drove on by this woman was t boned hurt her head hurt her knee uh couldn't get out
[15:18.960 --> 15:27.680]  of the car and i just couldn't believe that other the people closer to the wreck than i was i was
[15:27.680 --> 15:33.280]  back like three four cars i saw it happen didn't didn't didn't go render aid to this woman i mean
[15:33.280 --> 15:38.160]  wouldn't you want your grandmother to to have people stop and help her and it's like when i saw
[15:38.160 --> 15:43.120]  lady choking once there's like 25 people around her going 911 911 like parents and no one was
[15:43.120 --> 15:47.440]  helping the woman and then i had to physically pull them out of the way they're like hey are you
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.440]  trained hey wait for the police and then as soon as i got the woman to cough a big piece of bread
[15:51.440 --> 15:55.120]  up they're like you're a hero but we're looking at me real weird i'm like we're gonna get sued
[15:55.120 --> 15:57.920]  because i had to pick that woman up i thought i might have you know heard a rib or something
[15:57.920 --> 16:04.240]  was a woman weighed like 300 pounds 270 pounds or so and then we got out of there because in america
[16:04.240 --> 16:13.680]  helping somebody it's true is is is is is prasada non grata but a zimmerman we have the tweets up
[16:13.680 --> 16:23.520]  on info wars dot com of people attacking zimmerman for helping so we're going to be uh going over
[16:24.960 --> 16:31.760]  that report as well and now we have the justice department and now we have all of these congressmen
[16:31.760 --> 16:39.840]  coming out and i'm going to cover this in the next segment and saying that we need to ban guns and
[16:39.840 --> 16:47.680]  ban concealed carry all over the country as a civil right the guns are racist and i told you
[16:47.680 --> 16:54.080]  this was coming and you saw it back during the whole uh sandy hook situation where on the news
[16:54.080 --> 17:00.000]  they said gun owners collectively caused this and you saw the headlines about gun owners you know
[17:00.000 --> 17:06.000]  we're sick of you you killed those kids and then all these black activists from alsharpton to reporters
[17:06.000 --> 17:11.600]  at fox sports were like i'm telling you the in all rays the new clan they want to kill black people
[17:11.600 --> 17:16.240]  and michael moore came out and said i'm telling you right this is a quote racist white people want
[17:16.240 --> 17:23.520]  their guns because they're scared of black people unbelievable when it's black people denied ownership
[17:23.520 --> 17:30.480]  of guns in all these major cities that's why it's such a high crime rate the criminals can run wild i
[17:30.480 --> 17:34.640]  mean they've done this in european countries and the crime rate explodes because because they've
[17:34.640 --> 17:41.440]  disarmed the people it empowers predators and that's how you take disarming black cities
[17:41.440 --> 17:47.520]  cities that are mainly black or largely black all are disarmed is the clans the democratic party folks
[17:47.520 --> 17:52.080]  they've never let blacks have guns and they're never going to let you have guns you belong to them
[17:52.080 --> 17:56.800]  they're going to run the welfare programs they administer to suck off of they're going to run
[17:56.800 --> 18:00.400]  the food stamp programs and you're going to be used as a political weapon to bring down the rest of
[18:00.400 --> 18:05.360]  the country just like mexican laborers are they're not bad people but they're subsidized with government
[18:05.360 --> 18:10.880]  welfare at a level nobody else is to help bring down the wages that's a corporate subsidy so they
[18:10.880 --> 18:16.320]  can pay illegals things that they couldn't live off of without the government subsidy it's a plan
[18:16.320 --> 18:24.880]  so george emerman helps save a bunch of people and now he is being demonized as usual we're
[18:24.880 --> 18:31.440]  going to get to the latest on the nsa and paul watson has chilling photographs of jesus christ
[18:31.440 --> 18:39.840]  desecrated uh the crucifix machine gun and bombed by al qaeda christians having their
[18:39.840 --> 18:43.920]  heads cut off thrown off buildings i mean you know the mass martyr there's new photos of of
[18:43.920 --> 18:50.960]  churches ransacked all over syria churches are also ransacked all over egypt that's being reported
[18:50.960 --> 18:55.360]  today we're going to be getting into that uh obama back syrian rebels ransacked christian
[18:55.360 --> 19:00.400]  villages and churches christians attacked in egypt by muslim brotherhood supporters in mass

[24:24.000 --> 24:31.040]  now first off confirmed left-wing plant at houston's emerman rally is a far left activist and they
[24:31.040 --> 24:37.680]  had a bunch of these people out there to hold up racist signs to hold up stupid signs and to say
[24:37.680 --> 24:42.880]  stupid things to the media and to be quoted by the media and the media knew the establishment
[24:42.880 --> 24:47.200]  media knew full well what they were doing engaging in a piece of theater to deceive the public
[24:48.400 --> 24:53.840]  they thought of from the houston pros emerman counter rally at the nbpp anti-zimmerman rally
[24:54.400 --> 24:59.760]  picked up by ap shows a woman holding a sign that read racist and proud and again that was picked up
[24:59.760 --> 25:06.160]  by the ap you will not get a retraction they're guaranteed in on it ladies and gentlemen that
[25:06.160 --> 25:10.880]  looked incoherent with other reports that pros emerman side the houston chronicle identified
[25:10.880 --> 25:19.520]  her as renais vaughn and then it goes on to break down that the austin resident renais vaughn echoed
[25:19.520 --> 25:25.440]  the signs ugly statements by yelling where races were proud we're better because we're white this
[25:25.440 --> 25:32.880]  is on msnbc last night folks at the group as they passed according to the chronicle so trying to
[25:32.880 --> 25:37.920]  start stuff up the act to smear those emerman supporters as races she probably works with the
[25:37.920 --> 25:43.120]  just department folks this should be investigated as racist where they left his plant working as
[25:43.920 --> 25:50.240]  photo and comment was picked up and spread worldwide scanning the internet we found that
[25:50.240 --> 25:54.480]  renais vaughn from austin worked as a far left environmental group the texas campaign for the
[25:54.480 --> 25:59.600]  environment and that is federally funded by the way renais was even her photo linked to the far
[25:59.600 --> 26:05.120]  left environmental website and it shows her right there with the federally funded group
[26:05.120 --> 26:09.360]  and i'm telling you we should add in our article i know this group they're a land grab group for
[26:09.360 --> 26:13.680]  the big banks uh not about real environmental issues they may have useful idiots in the
[26:13.680 --> 26:20.160]  organization i don't know but i i know this group they get federal funds and so you have a federally
[26:20.160 --> 26:27.840]  funded operative guaranteed guaranteed confirmed and they don't even care they even say their real
[26:27.840 --> 26:35.040]  name because they know the media isn't going to cover it just like they edited zimmerman to make
[26:35.040 --> 26:41.840]  it sound like he was racist there's a black guy out here look at him instead it's a this guy here
[26:41.840 --> 26:45.920]  he's looking in things doing things he looks exact and weird like he's on drugs blah blah blah
[26:45.920 --> 26:50.560]  okay where's he going where's he going okay well well is he a white Hispanic black he looks black
[26:50.560 --> 26:56.400]  see they they're all manipulating you ladies and gentlemen meanwhile there's a whole world
[26:56.400 --> 27:03.280]  of serious things going on now i've said this day one it's about making owning guns racial
[27:04.480 --> 27:11.360]  and coming out with 180 degree frauds 180 degrees from the truth and saying ladies and gentlemen
[27:11.360 --> 27:18.160]  worldwide it is racist to own guns you have a right to be free in your community of no guns
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.480]  all the government has the monopoly of force and rules over you and criminals don't follow the law
[27:22.480 --> 27:27.520]  and abuse you it doesn't work but they know it doesn't work it's about a monopoly of force in
[27:27.520 --> 27:36.720]  the un zone treaty they say the state must have the monopoly of force look it up unidire july 7th
[27:36.720 --> 27:43.280]  2001 ratified in the original treaty and the new treaty says we implement according to these
[27:43.280 --> 27:50.960]  agreements just like obama care says we get a blank check or the nsa cyber security is a blank check
[27:50.960 --> 27:55.520]  or the amnesty bill is a blank check they're dictatorial blank checks and that's what the
[27:55.520 --> 28:00.640]  un treaty does and that's why forbs and even the wall street journal have had to admit it goes
[28:00.640 --> 28:08.000]  after individuals guns it says states can have guns but not people and now representative
[28:08.640 --> 28:14.640]  louis gutierrez or louise gutierrez calls for house hearings on trevon martin and gun

[34:46.640 --> 34:52.080]  takeover of dhs it's been done by foreign banks of the fellow reserve but to illustrate it they
[34:52.080 --> 34:57.520]  show them using german mercenaries and parts of this that are incompatible with radio i will
[34:57.520 --> 35:05.600]  narrate it the film is purge and it's 17 minutes long here it is department of homeland security
[35:05.600 --> 35:10.240]  headquarters last two weeks now i'm here to tell you the time is critical the department of homeland
[35:10.240 --> 35:14.880]  security is determined that now is the time to implement action to suppress the activities of
[35:14.880 --> 35:20.800]  right wing extremists the economic and political environment in which these extremists thrive is
[35:20.800 --> 35:25.760]  becoming more volatile it's apparent that the world is entered into a currency crisis they're in a
[35:25.760 --> 35:32.960]  homeland security briefing room civil unrest and armed conflict now these are environments in which
[35:32.960 --> 35:40.160]  our enemies both foreign and domestic thrive we're not going to let that happen it's no secret that
[35:40.160 --> 35:45.280]  the dhs recently purchased over two billion rounds of ammunition we're going to continue to purchase
[35:45.280 --> 35:50.240]  ammunition to keep it off the open market this prevents these extremists from getting ammunition
[35:50.240 --> 35:56.560]  in their hands additionally we've purchased 7 000 assault weapons these weapons will be issued to
[35:56.560 --> 36:01.760]  newly formed fema youth corps brigades as we receive threat level assessments these brigades
[36:01.760 --> 36:07.600]  will be deployed into combat areas using 2700 war wagons that were specifically designed for this
[36:07.600 --> 36:13.520]  purpose now in the past extremists were easy to identify they were skinheads kkk members
[36:13.520 --> 36:18.240]  radical political ideologists well now it's become a little more difficult this group includes
[36:18.240 --> 36:25.680]  anti-abortionists pro-constitutionalists believers in biblical end times gun owners and most importantly
[36:25.680 --> 36:32.160]  military veterans excuse me but uh military veterans are not extremists pro-constitution
[36:32.800 --> 36:37.680]  every american should be pro-constitution i mean the constitution is the written law of the land
[36:38.720 --> 36:45.440]  we've all sworn an oath to protect it in believers in end times that's like every christian in america
[36:45.440 --> 36:52.560]  that's millions and millions of people and they're good people strike and zed and umar on the bus
[36:52.560 --> 37:02.800]  write their ids down we can go after them later now look you may not think that these people are
[37:02.800 --> 37:07.600]  extremists but we've been monitoring their activity we've been looking at internet traffic
[37:08.320 --> 37:13.680]  cell phone use and financial transactions all this information is being sent to the threat
[37:13.680 --> 37:19.920]  fusion center the department of justice department of homeland security the fbi and other federal
[37:19.920 --> 37:26.000]  agencies have determined that these people pose a real threat now effective immediately all dhs
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.800]  agents will be required to undergo firearms desensitivity training using these new targets
[37:31.520 --> 37:38.080]  the elderly children pregnant women gun owners by the way this is all real military veterans
[37:38.080 --> 37:42.640]  will actually have these briefings to see who will be part of it an additional asset that's
[37:42.640 --> 37:47.600]  been made available to dhs has been the use of drones these drones will be outfitted for
[37:47.600 --> 37:52.560]  surveillance but as threat levels increase and the need arises they will be set up for military
[37:52.560 --> 38:04.240]  strikes this is treason i think we'd better expedite this speaking in german does not
[38:04.240 --> 38:14.960]  mask your guilt one of the fed says your attitude is not appreciated do what you do best
[38:20.160 --> 38:24.000]  some of us learn through schooling others through experience
[38:24.000 --> 38:34.800]  is this your funeral agent stein thank you for your time today please continue the evaluation
[38:34.800 --> 38:46.000]  in the next room the only difference is the feds now just clamor to go up against the american
[38:46.000 --> 38:56.400]  people americans are not as weak as you'd like to believe by the way i've they've actually
[38:56.400 --> 39:03.040]  used german intelligence from a city economic problems have already begun and that real wars
[39:03.040 --> 39:09.440]  and civil unrest would be the end result now in the fog of war who's to say who was violent first
[39:09.440 --> 39:16.320]  i didn't say we're having economic problems yes you did this is exactly what they do on
[39:16.320 --> 39:22.000]  purpose to gaslight you and that would lead to real wars and civil unrest i didn't say that
[39:22.000 --> 39:28.800]  you said that you started today saying okay okay we all know that this is caused by the
[39:28.800 --> 39:35.040]  extremist hoarding gold silver and food and it's also because of their racism
[39:35.040 --> 39:38.640]  well especially military show agent walker next room
[39:41.920 --> 39:43.200]  and what are you doing
[39:46.160 --> 39:48.960]  getting some real intelligence get out
[39:55.840 --> 40:00.240]  now ladies and gentlemen this does get more urgent our preparations for the purge have
[40:00.240 --> 40:05.600]  to be expedited we received a request from the federal reserve that the department of treasury
[40:05.600 --> 40:10.560]  with the assistance of dhs be authorized to confiscate all gold and silver being held in
[40:10.560 --> 40:14.160]  safe deposit boxes and banks throughout the country by the way they've actually done that
[40:15.120 --> 40:21.040]  furthermore in order to just have an employment tax to alleviate a toxic derivative market
[40:22.160 --> 40:28.320]  and to starve out our political adversaries the federal government is prepared to heavily tax
[40:28.320 --> 40:34.080]  all 401ks all savings this is the plan all pensions and all social security just like
[40:34.080 --> 40:38.080]  they did with the rs especially those military back absolutely they're going to ruin you
[40:38.080 --> 40:43.840]  and the christians now a possible shutdown of the entire banking system may be required
[40:45.680 --> 40:49.040]  well of course people are going to become violent you're stealing their money
[40:49.040 --> 40:53.120]  when my Aunt Gertrude finds out that you're going to yank her pension and cut off her
[40:53.120 --> 40:57.360]  social security you're going to need all that ammo and all those times that's right or telly how dare
[40:57.360 --> 41:02.240]  you do this to veterans who serve their country faithfully only to be backstabbed by a bunch of
[41:02.240 --> 41:06.400]  ivory tower bureaucrats committing treason is that what you think this is agent or telly
[41:06.400 --> 41:10.640]  bureaucrats committee you want to know what this is i'll tell you what this is the dhs has become a
[41:10.640 --> 41:29.600]  gestapo the nazi ss tortelli next room now your mission briefs contain profiles of the extremists
[41:29.600 --> 41:38.560]  in your sectors know them before the next evaluation that's why they're going to private
[41:38.560 --> 41:42.000]  contractors as they can't even get the fed to do what they want and it's actually happening
[41:45.280 --> 41:50.640]  so one of the homeland security people one of the fbi people calls one of the extremists
[41:50.640 --> 41:56.320]  that's on her list hello is this roland mcmahan yes roly who is this this is the agent and y'all
[41:56.320 --> 42:01.600]  robins of the department of homeland security i'm concerned about an operation the dhs is conducting
[42:01.600 --> 42:06.720]  and i'm wondering if i can get some more information from you why does my gut tell me that i should
[42:06.720 --> 42:13.520]  just hang up right now i understand you know the dhs is not exactly on my favorite list
[42:21.120 --> 42:26.720]  i received orders to investigate alleged extremist activity in my sector the dhs is
[42:26.720 --> 42:31.360]  planning to purge certain individuals in the near future and i believe they're doing it illegally
[42:32.240 --> 42:35.680]  you're on the list and i want to get down to the bottom of this before it gets any worse
[42:35.680 --> 42:44.640]  let me buy you a beer somewhere so we can talk more about it by the way the army manual says
[42:44.640 --> 42:48.880]  they're training to put us in quote re-education camps this is real i don't think you're gonna
[42:48.880 --> 42:53.840]  like where this is going i already don't like where this is that's what i'm calling but it's so over
[42:53.840 --> 42:58.640]  the top here people are following orders because they don't know how to deal with the real thing
[42:58.640 --> 43:04.320]  happening in america i want to get involved roly i have an intel profile report on you a
[43:04.320 --> 43:10.880]  mile long i know internet posts phone conversations bank transactions they have you all figured out
[43:10.880 --> 43:15.360]  all of that's illegal in the constitution but they do i want to find out if you are who they
[43:15.360 --> 43:21.360]  say you are oh they're already coming after us if it's not as advertised well agent and yel robbins
[43:21.360 --> 43:26.320]  is going to be barking fire here at the office they put poison in the water folks you're already
[43:26.320 --> 43:36.800]  committed all right but when we meet you come alone sure so they made a football field yeah it's
[43:36.800 --> 43:43.840]  part of the first tank battalion abrams who rolled into bagdad rack 2003 we're the first boots on
[43:43.840 --> 43:50.720]  the ground i didn't see much action until a couple weeks later but yeah tell me more
[43:50.720 --> 43:58.400]  i don't think we were in iraq for weapons of mass destruction i don't think we're in afghanistan
[43:58.400 --> 44:02.960]  for terror i don't think we went into libya to free the people and i don't think we're
[44:02.960 --> 44:09.680]  in syria now helping anybody and if we get into a war with iran i don't think it's going to end
[44:09.680 --> 44:19.280]  well for america that's the plan are you a republican or a democrat and who did you vote
[44:19.280 --> 44:25.680]  for in the last election if you don't mind me asking uh neither i will not vote for the lesser
[44:25.680 --> 44:32.320]  of two evils and i will not be part of their system whose system the federal reserve system
[44:33.120 --> 44:38.400]  the federal reserve is a private company who has the power to issue our own currency they're the
[44:38.400 --> 44:43.760]  real power brokers the real shadow government they want you back rest in president can't even question
[44:43.760 --> 44:50.560]  them the politicians are just puppets in this game the politicians give us the illusion as if
[44:50.560 --> 44:59.120]  we're free and now they're gonna get rid of even that the federal reserve is printing 85 billion
[44:59.120 --> 45:04.880]  dollars a month through quantitative easing and giving it to themselves it is total counterfeit
[45:06.320 --> 45:11.840]  i mean look at the vastan bombing look at that happen on the same day that the gold and silver
[45:11.840 --> 45:17.600]  market crashed and all the big banks swooped in to grab all the money while everyone was
[45:17.600 --> 45:23.040]  busy watching the news of the bombing they swooped in and bought gold and silver by the ton
[45:25.440 --> 45:32.720]  and the reason that they want me purged is because i don't buy their lies i tried folks
[45:33.440 --> 45:37.040]  they're gonna start with the leaders first and they're gonna move down to you power brokers
[45:37.040 --> 45:43.040]  so that is that their plan to get all the money no they already have money they want control that's
[45:43.040 --> 45:48.640]  right they want to bring about a new one world government a one world currency and a one world
[45:48.640 --> 45:56.320]  religion they want to control everything they're coming for everybody folks
[45:58.400 --> 46:03.520]  you're lying to yourself you don't admit that none of you that work for this are part of the
[46:03.520 --> 46:12.240]  winners can you play this all out for me just play it all out it's gonna start with a bank holiday
[46:12.240 --> 46:15.840]  that's where they shut down all the banks it's gonna come like on a friday afternoon
[46:16.880 --> 46:23.520]  they're gonna say that there's some cyber attack and then they'll reopen the banks after they've

[46:43.440 --> 46:50.000]  fema youth soldiers and then they're gonna bring on foreign troops to help you however i doubt
[46:50.000 --> 46:55.200]  that they have briefed you that these foreign troops are going to turn on you and then it's
[46:55.200 --> 46:59.920]  going to get real bloody and in the end the foreign troops is going to try to plunder the entire
[46:59.920 --> 47:04.640]  country they've already been promised whatever they can plunder they can have now what they don't
[47:04.640 --> 47:09.840]  know is that the ruling elite are going to use robots to turn on them and then when they're
[47:09.840 --> 47:14.160]  all dead the ruling elite get it all and anyone left is subject to the new world order
[47:14.160 --> 47:25.920]  oh god yeah we're gonna need them is there any hope
[47:28.960 --> 47:34.400]  there is any hope the american people have got to wake up and the current police and military
[47:34.400 --> 47:39.600]  have got to stand down when they're given the order to fire upon americans then they got to join

[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:52.320]  my son another way of saying that is a trevon martin could have been me uh 35 years ago and
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:16:00.400]  and when you think about why in the african-american community at least um there's a lot of pain around
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:05.920]  what happened here i think it's important to recognize we're here to put salt in the
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:10.480]  wounds as much as possible to distract you from the farm banks i work for rafting everybody
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:17.920]  at this issue through a set of experiences and that's enough yeah he goes on to say i'm used to
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:23.360]  when i walk through a parking lot people lock the doors yeah when i get in my car and then i turn
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:29.920]  it on and i'm in a parking lot i lock the door and you know i'm a man and i've been walking
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.760]  through parking lots and seeing women kind of look at you and got their purse because people
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.720]  are living in fear i'm a white guy and i'm sure there are some people out there that stereotype
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:43.040]  and think black guys about rape you know rape and reduce something my whole issue is if i see guys
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:49.760]  with wife beaters with like devil tats and they're bugging their eyes out at me and you know uh
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:54.400]  they're white they're hispanic they're black whatever i start kind of paying attention to them
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:01.120]  but absolutely you know if i'm in you know especially in a poor area and i see guys walking
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.440]  like they're thugs down the street i don't care what color they are i go that's guy looks like
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:10.560]  they're a thug and looks like they're tough okay if they try to shake me down i'm just gonna say
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:14.000]  i'm gonna ignore them and keep walking and if they come up to me and try to put a hand on me
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.640]  i'm gonna punch them right in the throat because i don't want to jump on top of them and hurt my
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.080]  knees and stuff when i slam their head in the ground plus i don't want to kill them because
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.520]  i have to go to jail and stuff and then i have to find that i didn't you know that it was done in
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:31.120]  self-defense been down that road so i'm sitting there and i'm thinking all right i'm gonna punch
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.680]  this guy in the throat i'm thinking how hard am i gonna punch him and and and and i'm not thinking
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:39.760]  he's a black guy i'm thinking the guy's walking like a thug thinks they're tough and i'm thinking
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:46.000]  about how i'm going to defend myself just like when i've been at the coast a few years ago and
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.040]  walk out of a restaurant in south padre and they're having a biker rally and it wasn't like a nice
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:55.600]  biker rally most rallies are nice people it was like thug wannabes rode up with a motorcycle on
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:01.040]  a revenant looking at me and i was thinking okay all right that guy's taking his helmet off i'm
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.960]  going to punch him in the throat the minute he tries to get up and do something and then i'm
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:09.600]  going to assault those next three guys then they'll probably pull a weapon i need to take that i mean
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:14.000]  that's that's i mean like that's what i'm thinking whenever something like that's going on i can't
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.800]  help it i'm thinking all right i'm ready to kill i mean i mean that's just how i am and i and i'm
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:24.240]  thinking all right all right okay instantly assess these guys these are probably ex-con real criminals
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:29.760]  i've got my three kids here uh that gives me you know just turbo dinosaur power and i'm thinking
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:34.400]  control yourself don't have a fight unless you've absolutely got to you know the man in me is ready
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:42.560]  to take them all on you know what i'm talking about out there don't you scum i hate gang members
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:48.720]  and filth and it has nothing to do with black people but i will stomp your head in if you
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:52.960]  start a fight with me you thug scum anyways excuse me ladies and gentlemen
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:03.120]  the point here is that they are simply trying to invoke a racial division here and that's what
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:08.720]  he's doing because i mean i see it all the time people are insecure they go to a country club that's
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:13.520]  above their standard they're white or black folks will think i don't want to go there you know that's
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:17.040]  uh i mean i had black friends in high school or like i don't really want to you know really want
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:20.960]  me to go to that golf course with you and go to that country club you think people like me there
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:25.440]  you know i get that and there's obama trying to evoke it let me tell people are looking at it a
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:32.080]  country club nowadays how sharp your car is your posture and how you're dressed and do you act arrogant
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:40.480]  if you act black you know uh i mean i mean if you're black and you go in there and you act uh
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:46.160]  you know like uh you're the president everyone will kiss your ass if you sit there and you act
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.560]  like a thug and you're a white guy everybody's gonna want to throw you out of a place that's
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:55.360]  what it comes down to ladies and gentlemen that's where all this goes that's how all this sits there

[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:38.160]  really this is all we ought to get some clan people on the show too and of course matt i'll
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:44.160]  say jones had the clan on and said he loved him but he had wonderful new black panther party on so
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:50.960]  i guess it's okay uh let's go ahead and talk to andrew in florida you're on the year welcome
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:57.600]  hello alex this is andrew um first time caller i wanted to say real quick i appreciate what you
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:04.080]  do in every day and uh and i do what i can to figure things out and do my own research and
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:11.040]  i just wanted to bring up a specific point um i'm an employee at a local grocery store i'm not
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:19.120]  going to uh use any names but um i've investigated a certain type of drinking water for babies called
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:23.280]  a nursery water i'm not sure if i'm allowed to say that on the air but yeah but i know all
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:28.720]  about it i've probably shot i'm just not exaggerate 20 reports on it uh where it even has higher
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:36.000]  levels on what the they have come out and they have said uh what seven years ago the american
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.840]  dental association said stop brushing kids teeth with fluoride it causes fluorosis cracking of teeth
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:46.400]  and reduction of iq they've said take it out of pesticide that they spray on crops because it bio
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:52.800]  accumulates uh and they've also uh gone around and i had to admit because the lawsuits and the
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:59.920]  science and they had i bashed government all day they had 97 percent of the toxicologist
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:11.120]  and and and and scientist at the um environmental protection agency in 2000 and again in 2005 or
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:20.080]  so and then again two years ago send letters with their names saying take this out of the drinking
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:26.880]  water and the and the answer was we'll go from 1.6 part per millions federally recommended uh to
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:39.200]  1.07 so they got it basically in half that's still deadly and and again yes everywhere the the
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:44.800]  government has been forced to say don't give babies fluoride water i mean you might as well
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:50.560]  literally give them a lobotomy and i mean i've drunk that nursery water on air i mean it you can
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:56.800]  taste the chemical in i mean it tastes like pool water folks and it's for the kids and by the way
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:01.440]  i was in a cvs the manager came over he goes you're the one shot that video in here i know my store
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:07.600]  i went yeah he goes uh well i i looked that stuff up because we were thinking about suing you and i
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:11.760]  guess it's true besides nobody buys it anymore i've heard it's going to be discontinued i went well
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:16.800]  why are you bucking up to me what you're six foot four so they made you the manager and you're now
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:21.680]  kind of getting in my face i said i'm trying to help kids stop bugging your jaw out at me i mean
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.880]  i'm sorry that's how i am get off my back i'm sorry go ahead go ahead and make your point about it
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:33.440]  no problem uh i actually just think it's a little strange and in a weird way kind of funny
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.800]  um but when you look at the packaging for this uh for this type of water i'm pretty sure you've
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:44.880]  noticed it that it provides the information that fluoride is added like it's uh like it's a huge
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:51.600]  benefit and it's like i look at this and the way i read is like with fluoride added like it's good
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:58.560]  for your children and and i think it's pretty insane in my opinion uh if anyone does any basic
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:05.520]  research on fluoride and then i did a little investigation on the uh the supposed um usage
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:11.840]  by hitler on his uh death camps with his now that's insure it's rise and fall the third right
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:17.600]  he got it from the soviets it's a fact since about 1925 the russians with us government
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:23.360]  advisors from the rockefeller brother foundation uh were spiking the water with about three parts
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:28.640]  per million they that that becomes so obvious though we're not good androids for them that slows
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:34.480]  you down too much uh in a work camp you only want about one part per six one point six parts per
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:40.480]  million that's why we get work camp dosages america you can't blame america for being zombies we've
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:45.840]  been under chemical attack since the 1950s okay well they're right back with more of your phone

[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:46.800]  your calls right now let's talk to andrew in the uk you're on the air ah hello alley hey buddy
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:51.040]  good to finally good to finally talk i called yesterday but it's point hold for five minutes
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:56.000]  now to walk the dog anyway i've got you linked in right now which i do pretty much every day
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:02.560]  on infoaudio.net that's my thing in the united kingdom awesome so so yeah i don't know how many
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:07.440]  lists as you've got stateside but i'm sure it's kind of double that over here now because i've been
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:13.680]  on since 29th of february of last year and the bonus video i hadn't heard of alex jones the only alex
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:20.320]  jones i knew about was the bbc one presenter if you're aware of her on the one show so somebody
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:25.040]  says if you heard alex jones i went that woman on bbc one because they went no the guy off from
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:30.240]  austin texas does info wars dot com so they had a look at your site thought all right this guy's
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:35.600]  opinionated he's outspoken so it's good to know that there's other people out there that are willing
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:43.600]  to take that risk and talk out loud well worldwide the broadcast is growing and i just see that as
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:48.800]  a metric a measurement of the global awakening and it's different strokes for different folks
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:54.480]  the other's different uh you know ideas out there but overall we know we're going in the wrong
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:35:00.560]  direction we know we're going into a planned global economy run by some very nasty people
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:07.520]  and it's time to wake up uh what percentage of brits do you really think uh are actually
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:14.000]  fawning and worshiping over the new royal baby i mean i i think kate middleton is attractive it
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.760]  seems like a nice lady because she is a commoner i mean and i'm not against inbred elites just
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:24.560]  because they're inbred elites i'm against them because of what they do but worshiping a bunch
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:31.440]  of inbred mental midgets on average i mean why am i supposed to worship someone i mean we all
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:37.360]  know people whose dad gave their son a business and the person's a jerk and we don't like them because
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:41.440]  you know they were given everything and and they're usually jerks because they don't appreciate
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:46.720]  anything we all know that but we all admire self-made men and women at least i do and and
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:52.160]  but then there's also people who've been given a lot but who've also done a lot with it and then
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:58.960]  you admire them as well uh but but but just the royalty and then everyone bowing down to them
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:04.000]  i mean it's absolutely disgusting but uh i've asked my question what you're calling about
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:10.800]  what about you yeah just to say that i've got your link into infoaudio.net i can say i run i
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:15.360]  start to do my live show after you you finish about nine o'clock i think i'll patch you in about five
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:20.000]  six in the afternoon because of the time delay then i do my thing i do a new section at ten i do the
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.720]  big section on the royal family i don't like the worship of wealth it ain't you know the human
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:29.200]  beings after all and that baby's going to be brought up in you know flash photography getting
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.000]  when she comes out of the hospital you know what it's going to be like they're going to be all
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.520]  perhaps there and which has just come out for me a few photos they'll do 32 page pullouts for it
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:42.400]  it's this sort of worship of wealth that i don't like and i'm not a royalist obviously but i'd say
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:48.560]  in answer to your question the percentage of people i'd say 10 to 20 percent you know it's the
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:53.920]  older generation that will stand and wait for the queen to come out to wave and go past you know
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:37:00.000]  the youth of today they're interested in that in fact the way i promote my wider infoaudio.net
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.320]  is by fake money i print counterfeit money with my logos on it i've got five pound issued out there
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:10.480]  and we're doing a 10 pounds of 20 pounds you know that's a great idea i want to come back out
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:16.320]  because they have the conspiracy notes i want to come back out with a global government currency
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:22.080]  and make it like a joke but have factoids all over it uh and and maybe we'll do one like
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:26.640]  vampire in chief with the queen of england and then another that has you know a eugenicist mass
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.720]  murderer in chief david rockefeller i've been wanting to do that for a while that's a great idea
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:37.440]  and handbills handed out people then get them to your site you can generally get enough ad revenue
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:43.840]  off that even with automated systems to pay for more handbills and then you you you self fund
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:50.160]  getting the word out using a free market that's how you do it uh absolutely anything else sir
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:55.840]  sure yeah i'll say alex basically i'm a self i'm a self funder i don't i don't advertise them i said
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:00.800]  dot net it's not a dot com infoaudio dot net it's not a dot com no no i think self funding is great
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:06.240]  if you're a doctor or a businessman or woman and you have extra money donating it to the fight
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:12.240]  doing it yourself uh is beautiful or have a hobby of a youtube channel whatever all of us doing a
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:17.200]  little something will bring the globalist down yeah it's what it's with you though i'm i'm kind of
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:21.920]  happy not advertising that way i've got no i've got enough to answer to sponsors or anything like
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:27.120]  and i can actually talk freely i've got friends who are printers they'll print it real cheap i mean
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:31.280]  that it's the paper here's the deal you don't have to answer for sponsors there's a lot of automated
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:36.640]  ad systems where you can approve and disapprove they just come to you and they go into an automated
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:42.960]  market and you say your price and then you know say you only accept libertarian or anti-globalism
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:48.240]  advertising i mean look they've made it dirty to make money because they want to make it all
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:53.680]  and then use their control the market to shut us off god bless you i appreciate your call you know
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:58.400]  it's come out that came out 15 years ago when i first saw it that high-end stores everywhere
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:04.640]  through a database of digital driver's license photos in a global database because they sell
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:10.800]  this data a lot of businesses have a secondary thing of selling data when you go in to a barns
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:14.720]  and noble or you know whatever these stores are that have the face scanning systems they know what
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:20.080]  you read what you buy your size they know how much you spend and they now have screens
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:28.000]  that will direct their salespeople to who really has money now folks that's an invasion of your
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:35.760]  privacy okay and they want you to get a customer loyalty card because that's a contract allowing
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:41.200]  them to use all the data and sell your data and there is high-end stores use facial recognition
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:49.120]  tools to spot VIPs and that's a story what is that out of Forbes NPR also reported on it
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:54.480]  but the bigger issue and i have it here in my stack is they're using it to cheat you in fact
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:00.800]  stores use facial recognition to gouge wealthy shoppers but it's not really even wealthy if you
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:09.520]  surf fancy things the the computer thinks oh you're buying yachts no maybe i was doing research on
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:15.120]  politicians buying yachts with taxpayer money or maybe i was looking at uh researching a jet that
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:21.200]  went down i'm not really going to be buying a 25 million dollar jet or whatever it doesn't matter
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:24.880]  you do that i mean i've gone and looked at jets i've gone and looked up globalist i've gone and
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:32.720]  then next time getting you know russian fab luge egg advertisements uh you know a year later on my
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:39.360]  computer i went and looked up the Mercedes that michael hastings was in we looked at it on computers
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:45.920]  all the jobs now there's Mercedes ads everywhere now i'm getting mail for the Mercedes at my house
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:52.240]  the exact Mercedes you see how that works folks i mean you need to be aware of this
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:41:01.520]  us and so they're all using the system to game us and then meanwhile we're like oh we we better not
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:08.240]  write a book and sell it my goodness i don't want to profiteer off my teeth aside well folks you've
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:14.240]  got to sell things to build a base to build an operation you you you could write a book and
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:19.280]  give it out for free and if you already have money that's fine that's a labor of love half the time
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:23.120]  people don't even appreciate it if it's given to them for free and we give most of what we do out
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:28.160]  for free but we've got to do enough to pay for things what i'm looking for is unlocked minds
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:34.240]  that's my treasure i'm looking for freedom a future i'm a bleeding heart libertarian i'm a
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:41.040]  bleeding heart fan of humanity i'm a bleeding heart lover of humanity lover of art lover
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:47.760]  of goodness lover of courage lover of beauty lover of life love it love it love it love it
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:54.160]  hate scum hate thugs hate tyrants hate criminals hate gangs hate because they're scum they're
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:59.040]  parasites and when i see a parasite a tick attached to my dog that i missed in between
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:04.160]  its toes it's been there for two weeks i'm ashamed i didn't look over the animal i'm ashamed i haven't
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:10.320]  given in a bath i'm ashamed it's got a tick big and fat and then i didn't get that tick off and
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:14.240]  i pull that tick off and i take it outside and i grind it into the ground because i don't like
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:21.600]  parasites it's like good dentist will tell you you think it's gross pulling out rotten teeth and
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:27.360]  pus coming out and stuff there's like a satisfaction but it's not that you like pus it's like you
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:34.000]  like healing you like removing the pus you like helping people not because you're some goody tissue
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.400]  who does it from a fake perspective to act like you're a good person but because it's who you want
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:45.360]  your children to be it's who you are it's what flows from you so they come to good people and go
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:50.640]  oh you shouldn't have a radio show and make money how do you think you build an economy how do you
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:57.120]  think you build a new media you've got to go out and you've got to put the information out do the
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:03.520]  best research you can and then sell products you already use that that you know we're good to share
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:09.760]  with others and give them a good price so that they can communally but in an individual way
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:16.000]  vote with their dollars and vote up the organic food vote up the best vitamins and supplements
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  vote up the best films vote up the best culture the best t-shirts the best art the best ideas
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:28.160]  vote up you have to choose with your dollars with your decisions with your feet what you promote
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:36.320]  to crush the enemy instead of them force feeding i mean i don't let my children watch television
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:44.080]  unless it's like archaeology shows history shows hunting fishing shows things like that
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:49.040]  but whenever we go to a hotel or something we flip through the children channels it's every
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:55.600]  channel is be gay for stuff targeting seven-year-olds and it's like oh but politically correct let
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:01.120]  them sexualize children if it's gay and i'm offended by that it's like you're a bigot if you
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:06.320]  don't let us sexualize your kids see they couldn't say hey teach your kid teach your seven-year-old
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:11.360]  daughter how to go out and find a sugar daddy you'd be like that's pedophilia but see if it's
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:17.520]  hey kids be gay it's oh that's just you know tolerance see the truth is the globalist are a
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:24.320]  bunch of degenerates folks and so it's the thrill of sexualizing a child that's all they've got left
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:28.240]  is screwing up wholesome good things and it makes me want to beat people's brains out
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:35.120]  i mean that's a normal response to messing with people's kids and it's going to get worse and
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:39.360]  worse i mean the public schools i have a curriculum article you guys gave it to me and i can't find it
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:43.600]  will you print it again where they're now going to teach the racism of guns and how they're meant
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:48.000]  to kill black people that's the party line of course they were coming out with that and and how
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:55.280]  they teach five-year-olds that two daddies and that men have sex together and that women have
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:59.200]  sex together and then you could say oh whatever don't be a square alex i bet you like you know
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:03.600]  women and together or whatever you know all the well i like beauty period but but the whole
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:08.960]  the whole point is is that i know where it glides where it goes and then you're sitting there
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:14.400]  shoving it on five-year-olds five-year-olds shouldn't even be thinking about that
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:23.760]  they're ruining natural discovery they're ruining normal behavior and all the studies show when you
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:29.120]  make a child mature early you are actually abusing their psyche and their IQ and their
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:33.520]  development and it stunts their development it's like if you take steroids when you're 10 years old
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:37.520]  it's going to infuse your growth plates and you're going to be a midget
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:44.640]  if you take them when you're 14 you're you're you're gonna have four years of growth you're not
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:54.400]  going to get do they tell people that no that's see so it's like they go oh you're just anti-gay
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:58.880]  yeah the fish the frogs are coming out bisexual they're like what are you against that are you
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:03.760]  against their sexual preference they're having their sexual preference taken they're being attacked
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:07.600]  i want to go to this fluoride report the guys found that there's like no exaggeration i've
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:13.520]  probably done 20 30 40 reports on nursery water and and they've got like with the school buses all
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:18.320]  these brands and it says go into school get your fluoride moms and the moms i see them at the store
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:24.160]  going and i walk over and go ma'am please look up the study on fluoride because i'll be in the

[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:13.760]  like when i go to a home that has no electricity and sometimes like here in michigan we have a lot
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:19.360]  of uh copper theft so they still all the wires i'm gonna have to rewire the houses so what i do
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:25.840]  i go in with a power converter and i hook it to my car which can be adapted to like home use where
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:33.200]  you can take just uh a car battery alternator and a fan blower motor which uh runs your heat in your
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:40.320]  car and actually make a self-sustaining power system i know there's all sorts of alternative
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:45.600]  energy things being suppressed with the fake clean energy movement they've got the trilogy just a

[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:37.440]  set it up to where they take existing profitable companies and bankrupt them or create a subsidiary
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:43.360]  steal the pensions and now they're even taking private bank accounts and not getting in trouble
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:47.680]  because they got paramilitary swat teams that were set up to fight al qaeda who they run
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:53.120]  trained and ready and and they want a civil war and they're going to start one you know

[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:27.120]  mean i i saw the article posted yesterday about the finalists and some of them were just really
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:32.400]  high quality stuff and i really i've watched some of them over actually because i saw them in the
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:39.360]  finalist but i went down to the comment section and i saw a lot of people very angry about uh
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:44.320]  some of the selections for the finalists um mainly because they feel like some of the rules are
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:50.080]  broken to let these people content to be a finalist i mean every video that every video is a good
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:55.280]  video and deserves respect yeah but i mean listen listen in the rules are i'm gonna pick whoever i
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:03:00.800]  want and i'm gonna pick people that i believe followed the rules when you're watching 600 videos
[02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:05.200]  i mean you know some people mentioned info wars they don't show info wars dot com i mean is that
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:10.800]  rule really really broken we just kind of had some basic rules to get the riff raff out to make sure
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:15.920]  it was good filmmakers so i mean anything like this you're gonna have people that aren't happy
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:20.080]  that they you know aren't the winner but everybody should be happy because they entered the contest
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:24.480]  brother yeah i agree with you hundred percent i mean everybody's a winner at the end of the day
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:30.480]  but um you know there's people who put probably tons of money and effort and there's
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:34.480]  then i a finalist i mean i don't know who should be the final that's up for you guys to judge fine
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:41.760]  everyone's a finalist but i'll pick we're doing finalists to try to just focus in and that's one
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:46.720]  reason i'm holding off the next wednesday to announce the first place because i want to go back into
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:50.880]  we picked 35 and i think those are pretty much some of the best but then there's other ones
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:55.760]  that that either again honorable mentions or i don't know i mean it's torture i mean i'm the one
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:00.720]  that comes up with these crazy ideas my team tries to implement them and i mean can you imagine
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:05.760]  trying to watch 600 videos while you're running a syndicated radio show nightly news fending off
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:13.520]  globalist attacks managing things running a full scale easter bunny farm well um i agree with you
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:18.720]  hundred percent actually i don't blame you for some of the confusion or whatnot but um i guess my
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:23.840]  question is uh when you choose your finalist was this going to be i mean when you choose the winners
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:27.920]  is this going to be based solely off the finalists are you going to look through other ones because
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:32.400]  some people feel like they've been left out wow is that i mean i mean i mean did you make a video
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:37.040]  what is your video i haven't made a video i'm just i'm just read the comment yesterday and i was
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:41.120]  just like you know i i couldn't believe some of the stuff i was hearing you know well people get

[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:15.120]  sense of justice growing up and i like all cultures all groups you know i find it to be
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:21.120]  interesting exciting and i also said a lot of history so i know that the system uses divide
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:27.440]  and conquer to manipulate people and they use tribalism which is really the new racism the
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:32.320]  globalist will play one african tribe off against another one's english tribe off against a scottish
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:36.480]  tribe or catholics off against protestant surprises off against catholics or protestants
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:41.040]  off against 70 adventist or on and on and on people love to get in groups love to get in gangs
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:47.840]  but there was a Trent Leonard case about a year ago where this guy uh he's only crown was being
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:53.360]  poor because i know they take white uh people's kids when they're poor as well he worked hard
[02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:58.080]  mowing yards in the area and as a maintenance man running a storage area but they thought
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:06.080]  he is home that he built there was not fancy enough uh and they took his children and i and i saw
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:12.080]  quantel x covering it the head of the black panther new black panther party there in houston
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:16.160]  one of the biggest chapters in the country international leader in it and i went and looked
[02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:19.440]  up the case i went read about it in the houston chronicle i went and checked it it was true they
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:23.200]  were persecuting this guy and i would have come to his aid if it was brought to my attention uh and
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:28.720]  it was admitted that cps was saying being poor was a crime and i came to the guy's aid we raised
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:34.720]  money and he got his kids back and so it's not my job to get quantel x on here and calling names
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:39.120]  even though i don't agree with a lot of things he says it's really to try to understand this
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:43.680]  because i get i could get a big crowd right now if i wanted to go say the things he's saying
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:50.080]  from a white perspective and i got to be honest i mean i see things being spouted by the white
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:54.240]  separatist groups that are basically what the black groups are saying and i and at the end of the day
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:58.880]  i see the black panther new black panther group i'm a video of this uh you know zehrman's and no
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:05.360]  good jews say black panthers out of florida and my whole issue is really so so you know getting
[02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:12.960]  at this why is it okay if if you're black to then say things but it's not okay if you're white i just
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:17.520]  want to stop letting the system use race to control everybody and then i get that there are things
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:21.280]  that are done wrong to black people like driving while black walking while black a lot of black
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:25.520]  friends growing up in dallas i remember being pulled over and things uh or if we're walking on the
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:31.200]  street when i had a black friend with me i i get all that but what does all of this division do to
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:36.480]  fix it now now i've said my piece on that i want to get his take the quantel x is the leader of the
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:43.920]  new black panther party in houston texas qxjustice.com i want to get his take on this because he does go
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:48.160]  out with nobody else else you know the regular black leaders say hey take our kids put us in
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:53.600]  prison feed on us you know food to the government have all the forced abortions you know where they
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:57.760]  pressure people into having abortions uh sterilized black women that's going on in california right
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:02.400]  now and then the white liberals go there are too many black people my whole issue is that's the real
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:08.080]  racism and but but and and so i hear all this stuff i disagree from the new black panther party
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:13.360]  but then i hear things that i agree coming out of them so i want to get to the bottom of this with
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:18.240]  us uh with our guest today he's going to be here till about 50 after then i'll take some calls but
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:23.040]  quantel x thank you for coming on the broadcast today and thank you for having me mr jones i want
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:26.960]  to greet you and your listening audience and a great bunch of people i'd love to link them
[02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:32.480]  those words to me may please be up to you and i am the national leader of the new black panther
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:36.000]  okay so you're the national leader i want to be clear as i apologize for getting that wrong
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:42.080]  uh can you speak right on your telephone it's a little bit low sorry i said that i am the national
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:48.320]  leader of the new black panther nation i split with the new black panther party several years back
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:52.640]  and i'm the national leader of the new black panther nation okay so it's a new black panther
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:57.360]  nation great i'm i'm sorry i got that wrong i've got several bios here break down your take on
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:02.960]  sammerman where you think this is going the armed march yesterday and both sides and what was
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:11.120]  happening there let me put this entire simmering case in contact with simmering attempting to do
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:17.200]  something good in his community by being a neighborhood watchman yes was he doing something
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:22.640]  good by following during people who had their homes broken to his phone number you can call me
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:28.160]  or my wife if you use this as a help yes was he attempting to do something good with some children
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:35.440]  that he may have mentored that either the mentor absolutely but did he do something wrong and bad
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:41.440]  on that night that he encountered trevon martin absolutely he did trevon martin had a right
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:48.240]  to go home he was not breaking any laws he was committing no crimes there's no evidence anywhere
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:54.160]  to support or suggest he was committing any crimes that night that he was walking home simmering
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:59.920]  racially profiled someone would say profiled but i believe racially profiled trevon martin
[02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:06.000]  before he ever spoke to trevon martin he called him an effing hunk an effing thug they always get
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:13.040]  away with it so he got out of his vehicle with a preconceived mindset that he was going to approach
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:20.080]  a thug and a criminal this young man that night going home with neither the young man was walking
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:27.920]  with skittles and a can of arizona t that he's going back to his home you have a right mr jones
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:33.600]  i have a right and every citizen in this country and we're not breaking the law our children have
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:41.120]  a right to walk home not being profiled or costed and i believe that jones simmerman was the pursuer
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:46.400]  he was the one doing the stalking and he was the one already had his mind made up when he approached
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:54.160]  trevon martin i do not believe that mr simmerman had to kill trevon martin that night and if he
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:16:00.080]  felt trevon martin was a threat would then wait till the police get there and do their job now if
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:04.720]  you're protecting a neighbor and he's committing a crime and you use your firearm that's a different
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:10.720]  story but there was no crime being committed so there was no need for him to approach that young
[02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:16.560]  man but he said he looked suspicious looked like he's on drugs i don't think he belongs around here
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:21.520]  those are the racial stereotypes that we believe play the significant role in this simmerman case
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:30.240]  again the national leader of the new black panther party nation quantel x is joining us he led
[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:35.840]  a big demonstration in houston yesterday and we're trying to get his perspective on this
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:42.160]  pulling back though uh what do you think obama is doing with this whole case i mean undoubtedly
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:46.880]  the justice department went down there tried to start things up it's a tragedy i don't think we
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:50.560]  know what really happened that's why he was found not guilty there's reasonable doubt from my
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:54.400]  perspective jimmy carter has said that i don't think he said it because he's racist i think he
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:17:00.560]  said it because he actually followed the trial but i think they chose this case because it is debatable
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:07.600]  i believe from both sides to create a political diversion now now that's my take on it what do
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:14.960]  you think in a larger context uh is going on here i have listened to everything that the president
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:21.840]  said in his address to the nation in regards to the trayvon morton case and i agree he said
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:29.760]  some valuable things i can appreciate that but he did not say the one thing i was hoping that he
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:37.200]  would say not one african-american leader none of my brothers and sisters from community activists
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:46.480]  to congressmen to uh leaders of organizations etc none of them asked obama to do one thing
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:53.280]  i asked the president of the united states of america since there's a great controversy in
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:18:02.240]  the zimmerman case of whose voice it was screaming on that 911 call i'm asking president obama
[02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:10.240]  to bring in your very best voice analyzers that you have working in the cia and the pentagon
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:15.600]  and give the american people the answer because the court may have not been able to conclude it
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:20.800]  the judge may have not known the prosecutors and defense may differ on that but i believe that the
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:27.440]  super counterintelligence program in america's government has the ability to tell everybody
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:33.520]  whose voice that was screaming on that 911 tape if we could determine who that was screaming
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:38.960]  with it i think that would solve a whole lot of the pain that's out here right now behind
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:43.840]  this verdict involving george zimmerman see see when i have you on you sound reasonable
[02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:49.520]  and then i see quotes attributed to you uh you know saying some pretty radical things
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:58.320]  what what is your view in general uh quantel x uh on white people and black folks in this
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:03.920]  country because my issue is there's a whole world out there other things going on and and and why
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:10.160]  do you think the media loves to obsess on race all day if you would like to take me to pass on
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:15.680]  something that you have read that i have said i hope for you to please do so i'm not going to run
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:20.240]  in time for many things that i've said because i'm a man who means what he says this is exactly
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:24.560]  what he means okay but i mean i mean you know some of those controversial statements do you think
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:32.480]  white people are inherently more corrupt and evil than other groups i believe that the mindset of
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:39.840]  white supremacy is inherently evil i also believe the mindset of black self destruction and black
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:47.600]  self inferiority is evil a skin color don't make no man evil a skin color can't make a woman evil
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:53.680]  because you and other i can control what skin color we're born into this world so for any human
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:59.520]  being to be hated strictly on their skin color is ignorant and foolishness but if your mindset
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:04.000]  is that you are better because you're white or you're better because you're black or you're
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:08.400]  inferior because you're white or inferior because you're black well that's something wrong with that
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:14.720]  igno manyist mindset the problem in america the number one enemy of white people and the number
[02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:21.520]  one enemy of black people in this nation is ignorance and we are not willing to try to eradicate
[02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:28.800]  ignorance by any means necessary both black and white most white people sometimes they're racist
[02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:34.320]  and don't even know it but it's not because they hate black people it's because they are ignorant
[02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:38.720]  to exactly what they're saying what they're doing what they've been taught it's the same thing yeah
[02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:46.000]  but doesn't doesn't doesn't msnbc hyping the stuff up actually create more not even racism but more
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:53.200]  of just paranoia on all sides obviously msnbc has the right to do exactly what they're doing
[02:20:53.840 --> 02:21:01.520]  and i watch a lot of msnbc because some of the commentary and some of what they say
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:07.280]  i'm very uncomfortable with but i don't watch a lot of fox news because i'm just as uncomfortable
[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:16.960]  with that i respectfully say to you mr jones fox news saying in msnbc none of them are willing to
[02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:23.920]  speak the wrong unadulterated truth to the american people so i can't be a big fan of neither one of
[02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:30.320]  them because none of them are willing to let people tell and speak the truth they bring people
[02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:37.440]  on to the show that will bring calm to the situation that won't rock the boat but i see
[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:43.200]  the boat of ignorance in america needs to have a hold not did it not just rock but none of them
[02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:48.640]  are willing to do it let's be honest well i mean here's my issue we're overrun by foreign megabanks
[02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:52.960]  our government's funding al-qaeda to take over all these countries there's a there's spike in the
[02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:57.920]  water with poison on record to dump everybody down white folks don't get a memo saying don't drink
[02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:01.760]  the fluoride water and it's a hundred percent meant to hurt us there's government documents
[02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:07.120]  it's on record harvard studies you name it and then instead i see the very establishment
[02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:14.000]  injecting race race race then claiming they want to clean up the problem i put forward
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:21.840]  that the obsession on all this race issue is meant to actually keep it going i mean i mean
[02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:26.160]  here's an example uh this has been confirmed by gateway pundit we've confirmed it right here in
[02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:31.200]  austin we have an article false flag leftist run false flag against george zimmerman up on
[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:35.680]  infall wars dot com and i don't have a dog in this fight i'm just looking for the truth left wing
[02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:40.640]  plant at houston prozerman rally is far left activist that works for a federally funded
[02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:46.160]  environmental group uh saying we're racist and proud and she ran around trying to stir up the
[02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:51.680]  black crowd there now now now what do you say about not white people that are paranoid of black
[02:22:51.680 --> 02:22:56.640]  folks they don't hate them they're just scared because of the media or black folks that think
[02:22:56.640 --> 02:23:00.320]  all the whites are out to get them so then they're paranoid it kind of creates the self-fulfilling
[02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:05.280]  prophecy and you got real racist out there as well what do you say to that special type the liberal
[02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:11.760]  trendy activist who i know not this woman but people like her that i've met and talked to
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:16.480]  who at the end of the day are the actual racist and want to abort all the black people if they had
[02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:20.960]  had their druthers the margaret singer type i mean a quantel extra you aware i'm going to be
[02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:25.680]  kind of sending but most people aren't are you aware of that breed of master manipulator
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:34.880]  let me study this the honorable lydian mohamed told us that you cannot phantom the depth of the
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:45.200]  devil we really have been so deceived by the government of the united states many of us
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:54.000]  can't even phantom to what depth these people will go to to manipulate the masters of the ignorant
[02:23:54.000 --> 02:24:01.840]  people who are not well informed and will learn and will read see nobody wants to talk about what
[02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:08.720]  rules though to build a bird group play and what's happening inside of america around the world
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:15.760]  but if you can keep pity common white people pity common white people this guy is looking at each
[02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:22.800]  other we're not looking at what's really behind all of this do i doubt that there was a plant
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:28.400]  at that particular march it wasn't a plant just on that side there were plants on both sides
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:35.360]  there were people there who were marching with us and i had to check because they were attempting
[02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:41.680]  to create a confrontation because they had a different agenda but i was already warned about
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:47.600]  that potentially the government and law enforcement would have people planted among us
[02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:55.120]  pretending to be protesters with a hidden platform and a hidden agenda so i don't doubt it at all
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:25:02.240]  but i asked the american people both black and white what are you willing to sacrifice to really
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:07.760]  expose the truth if you're not willing to sacrifice that pretty home that you have on the suburbs and
[02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:11.920]  that job that you have and you're only one paycheck away from poverty if you
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:18.720]  you're willing to give up something to expose the truth to freedom lines of both black and white
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:25.120]  in this country we are not going to be successful i'm going to eradicate that myth that guanyo x
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:30.880]  takes white people that's a lie okay well since you raised that since you raised that
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:39.920]  oh no no no finish your point sorry but what i do he is how white people have not been willing to
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:47.200]  go to war to tell black people the truth white people who have been in power and are still
[02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:54.000]  currently in power have not been willing to expose other white people who have gotten rich
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:01.040]  at the back and the clearance of black people they have not willing to fight to expose the truth
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:06.240]  to my team well sure but i mean look the average white persons just like the average hispanic
[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:11.840]  or black person or asian i know they just want to go to work get their money go home watch tv they
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:17.360]  don't even know what planet they're on that and and instead the liberal media that's not liberal at
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:22.880]  all just race race race where people are like man i'm sick of hearing about this but but listen
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:27.360]  expanding on this since you raised it because i'm not here to attack you i'm here to understand
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:32.560]  these statements or i've had media put stuff out and say that i've said it before and i didn't say it
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:38.160]  but reportedly you were quoted by the new york daily news is saying i say to jewish america get
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:44.800]  ready knuckle up put your boots on because we're ready and war is going down the real deal is black
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:49.600]  youth do not want a relationship with the jewish community or the mainstream white community or
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:55.440]  the uh foot shuffling well i mean look at how sharp has been given a job at msnbc head bowing
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:27:01.280]  knee bobbing black community all you jews go straight to hell uh here's another one you reportedly
[02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:07.760]  said if you feel that you just got to mug somebody because you're hurt and you and you're in pain
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:15.040]  go to river oaks and mug you some white folks if you're angry that your brother is put to death
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:20.640]  don't burn down your own community give these white folks hell from the womb to the tomb now now
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:26.240]  are those statements out of context or what do you mean by those and let me explain both of them
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:31.520]  the comments that i made in 1995 as the national youth minister of the nation is long
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:42.560]  what i said was we were holding a black holocaust convention in washington dc in october 1995
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:50.880]  that there were jewish people outside marching against us using the term holocaust and they
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:57.040]  felt that we did not have the right to apply the term holocaust to the transatlantic slave trade
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:02.720]  and the genocidal practice of what happened in the rest in the middle passage during slavery
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:09.680]  and they were saying death to farrakhan death to farrakhan this was a day before the million
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:20.240]  man march and what i said was that if those gents outside protesting cannot respect the black
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:26.960]  holocaust why should we respect theirs if they can't respect the suffering of black people
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:33.200]  and many more millions died in the transatlantic slave trade and they wanted to respect their
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:40.080]  suffering but won't respect ours i think they held with those jews gone to grill knuckle up put your
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:47.600]  boots on because the war is going down and i stand by that to this day that if you cannot
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:53.280]  respect another people suffering but the man that we respect yours that's racism that's
[02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:58.640]  insensitivity suffering is suffering no matter who the people is if it's legitimate suffering
[02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:02.400]  we now want i mean undoubtedly a lot more black people died in the transatlantic slave trade
[02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:06.720]  than were then killed in world war two total i mean you have to understand though and i mean
[02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:12.240]  it's a terrible thing on average about 90 percent of the sailors after three or more missions died
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:19.040]  as well it was and as you know most the sailors were actually white slaves on press gangs stolen
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:24.480]  from their homes in england and put on those ships did you know that quant lx i do know that and what
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:30.480]  we also know to be a fact that three quarters of the slave cargo never made it to america
[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:34.960]  three quarters because of the disease and malnutrition was thrown overboard with other
[02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:39.920]  yeah the sharks followed yes some numbers are half some others are yeah or two or three quarters
[02:29:39.920 --> 02:29:44.960]  of at least uh 50 million that were brought from that no yeah that's it's it's it's definitely
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:48.480]  in the millions of millions you they're not sure historically we'll be right back i want to hear
[02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:56.480]  more about this with you we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[02:29:56.480 --> 02:30:05.440]  network are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us as we've moved through

[02:33:19.920 --> 02:33:24.000]  well folks i don't have any hidden agendas i think that's pretty clear i can't even control what i
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:30.080]  say on air my agenda is that i believe what comes around goes around you reap what you so
[02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:39.040]  you call it karma whatever you don't get away with stuff and it is not taught in all the steven
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:45.200]  spielberg movies that one big reason for the revolutionary war was the press gangs and pressmen
[02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:50.960]  where on average it was five to ten years of slavery and they would drag you along the bottom
[02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:55.440]  of the boat and kill you they whip you and it's bad we're doing to a black guy it's bad we're doing
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:34:01.520]  it to a white guy the point is is that you know the spanish galleys would grab other sailors and
[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:06.480]  put them as slaves in the bottom to work them to death this is what barbarism was and and it
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:10.800]  still goes on and the last group that it was okay to do it too was black people and that's terrible
[02:34:11.920 --> 02:34:17.040]  but i think there's this attempt to create dependency and this idea that well i can't
[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:22.560]  ever be successful because of you know i come from slaves i mean almost everybody comes from slaves
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:29.280]  and it it's a ignorance of history that's pushed and and you notice we have the leader of the
[02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:33.280]  national leader of the new black panther party nation on with us i want to give you the floor
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:37.360]  for the rest of this segment because you had some points you wanted to make about so-called liberal
[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:43.120]  media uh by the way the woman who was went out there with a sign saying we're racist and proud
[02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:48.560]  that the ap and ms mbc ran with she now says it was a joke yeah you know you got caught in the
[02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:53.600]  false flag there you and in our article detailing that is on info wars dot com but but quanta
[02:34:53.600 --> 02:34:57.840]  election so we can understand this what happened with you in the in the in the new black panther
[02:34:57.840 --> 02:35:01.520]  party and then of course i've had members the original black panther party on who were very
[02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:07.120]  critical of the new black panther party what is the difference i always hear about you is your
[02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:12.320]  group becoming bigger uh explain to us why you had a split because i gotta tell you i see some of
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:18.480]  these new black panther party people and the stuff they say and do and they act like plants i've proven
[02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:23.280]  a lot of white supremacists are actually feds like hal turner and others and i gotta say a lot of the
[02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:29.840]  new black panther party people i mean there's no way they're saying and doing these things uh on
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:37.520]  their own it it's it's scripted to make them sound like idiots in my opinion let me say what
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:45.520]  the real issue is here with african-american leadership including the revolutionary wing of the
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:57.760]  movement we must be consistent in our call and application of justice we cannot we cannot
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:05.040]  go without the evil of what white people do by some white person has done but we are not willing
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:12.960]  to use that same tactic that same energy for the evil that's being carried out by us on us
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:20.320]  and that was my disagreement with the original leadership of the new black panther party i love
[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:27.120]  them those are my brothers and my sisters but we cannot put a ten thousand dollar bounty on
[02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:34.160]  george demerman but we would not put a ten thousand dollar bounty on men that's raping young black
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:39.360]  children and kidnapping and abducting young black children we are not willing to put a ten
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:46.720]  thousand dollar bounty on a man that is still rapist of black women if we got ten thousand
[02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:51.920]  dollars and we don't need a body for george demerman black people will go after him for free
[02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:57.760]  but if we're going to spend ten thousand dollars on a bounty on the head of somebody they're like
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:04.000]  me and right now for an in our community for doing things ten times worse than what george
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:10.160]  demerman has ever done or can do and so if we're going to point out the evil of people like george
[02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:17.120]  demerman in the wrong of him we got it's not the howler when that enemy looks like us and comes
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:24.000]  from among our community that's my problem with us we must be consistent and the principles of
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:30.560]  truth oh god we remove his hands from us and he would not assist us nor help us in what we are
[02:37:30.560 --> 02:37:37.840]  trying to do so that's my position those are the real differences we must be just as diligent
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:45.600]  man and i don't see that happening but i've tried to be consistent in that i feel more rallies in
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:51.600]  texas than in louisiana against black on black crime than any other african-american leader in this
[02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:58.720]  region in fact check your facts alex jones i've turned more black men in on the street for killing
[02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:06.240]  other black people into the into jail than any other black leader in america i've solved more
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:13.440]  on black murders in this country than any other black leader in america so if i was anti white
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:18.480]  and only for black why am i taking black men off the streets for killing other black people
[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:22.080]  when the police couldn't let me ask you this question because you wanted to get into the
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:24.960]  so-called leftist media and you were saying some interesting things during the break so i'd like
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:29.120]  you to repeat those you got pretty uh pretty hot when you were talking about it understand why
[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:35.440]  why do you think there was less black illegitimacy pre-civil rights movement than than that than
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:39.760]  whites there were more whites with single parent families and there were blacks how did the numbers
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:47.120]  completely flip we're now 94 percent of blacks that are murdered since 1976 are killed by their
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:56.000]  blacks why what what happened what was done uh in in your view the honorable life and mohammed
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:04.480]  taught us that integration was a hypocritical trip we as african-americans really did need
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:09.760]  to fight for social integration the way that we did morally it was the right thing to do yes
[02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:18.080]  but strategically it was not the wisest thing to do because morally we should all be one race and
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:23.920]  one human family but strategically that was not the living reality in america for black people
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:30.320]  do you realize alex that during segregation we built black hospitals we built black banks we
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:36.240]  had black transportation companies black hotels and motels black insurance agencies we had black
[02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:41.520]  loan companies during segregation we were building and establishing black universities during
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:47.360]  segregation and the big mega banks saw that just like they bombed libia or syria or any other sovereign
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:52.640]  nation was about that integration had nothing to do with a change of the moral consciousness of
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:59.280]  people in america they saw that we as black people were working for the vast majority of white people
[02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:04.720]  in america but we were taking the paycheck money and pooling the resources among ourselves in our
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:09.120]  own community because if we wanted to be respected we could only spend our dollars with each other
[02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:12.640]  that's right blacks were getting rich they were turning on it they were not getting
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:18.800]  return on that money so they had to integrate to give the money back to them integration the way it
[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:25.600]  was done was not done correctly we just need social integration all we needed was the real
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:31.040]  fine extra integration in america and i guarantee you everybody would have wanted to get with us
[02:40:32.720 --> 02:40:37.120]  no i mean you're absolutely right look it sounds good you'll have women all going to the workforce
[02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:42.880]  well the woman wants to sure but it's declassified the whole suffrage movement was run by the
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:48.240]  department of war to get women in there so they could tax them and have the state raise the children
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:53.760]  a fact sounds great and and women want to work that's wonderful the point is they force the economy
[02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:59.840]  now where a woman's got to work or the or somebody's you know both have to work regardless of whether
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:05.200]  somebody wants to stay home or not and in that is the secret the globalism does not want you to
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:10.960]  spend your money in your community they want it going to them for control and that's the name of
[02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:15.440]  the game of the new world order and that's what my dad talked about that's what the history shows
[02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:21.200]  black people were becoming upwardly mobile but in their own giant economies that were actually
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:26.800]  becoming so popular they were even being patronized by whites at that point and the system and the
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:32.000]  democratic party of the Ku Klux Klan said we can't beat these republicans and the civil rights movement
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:38.080]  let's own it but do race politics playing sides off against each other and that is the official
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:43.520]  plan of these people like chris mathews and other disgusting maggots like him and this is not our
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:48.160]  opinion this is historical truth so so get into what the so-called liberals did what you were
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:55.200]  saying earlier during the break but the coldest move the coldest move next to slavery that white
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:42:03.520]  liberals did in america would give black people a welfare program that would make us absolutely
[02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:10.880]  psychologically co-dependent on somebody else and never have an independent upward mobile
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:19.120]  way of thinking of doing for yourself it's welfare came in after integration we didn't even need that
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:26.800]  kind of welfare program for segregation you rarely i was a young boy i'm 42 years old but i remember
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:33.360]  as a child i never saw a homeless black person in my community everybody said everybody and when
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:38.880]  somebody dies black women would go through the door and get money from everybody in the neighborhood
[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:44.640]  to bury that person we need no death insurance you call life insurance nobody was homeless
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:50.560]  everybody said we said one another but they brought us a welfare program and look at the word
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:57.360]  welfare turn the word around it means farewell to being the independent people you once were and
[02:42:57.360 --> 02:43:03.040]  you were becoming and so they told black women i'm a product of the welfare program in america
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:09.920]  we were on welfare for years and i know what it did i remember as a young boy the welfare workers
[02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:15.280]  would come by the house they would ask my mother are you dating anyone have you seen the children's
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:20.960]  father has they have they brought anything to them do you have any gifts that he's brought has he paid
[02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:26.800]  for anything but you know if you accept any gifts from him or he gives you any money you don't report
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:34.960]  it will cut you off and you lose all your benefits but my party will allow their baby after baby after
[02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:41.440]  baby as long as they had no man in the home and no man involved they would continue to receive
[02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:51.280]  those benefits that would do a whole people for four decades with the mindset of co-dependency
[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:55.840]  and kill the independent spirit and i'm sure you've read with margaret singer i'm sure you
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:44:00.720]  wrote margaret singer said that's the official plan is not our opinion so this is why the media
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:06.480]  takes out of context what you say because they don't want people hearing the large uh overall
[02:44:06.480 --> 02:44:13.040]  statement of what you've had to say here and i can disagree with black woman no black woman in america
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:19.520]  should ever go to plan parents do it but i am a supporter of the right of choice talents choose
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:26.320]  who you're going to lay down with that's your biggest right of choice margaret singer the founder
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:31.680]  was a believer in eugenics and extermination of black people i know many for millions of black
[02:44:31.680 --> 02:44:37.360]  people will go through this i'm telling you i've been at the liberal meetings i've been at the
[02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:43.840]  liberal meetings these are the most racist people on earth i mean it is incredible and i've even talked
[02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:48.400]  to their black operatives and they know it and say there are too many black people and again my
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:55.520]  bottom line is i don't want to hear how i'm racist all day if i think that there was obviously from
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:45:01.040]  the evidence uh you know reasonable doubt in the zimmerman case and it becomes this football
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:06.400]  well meanwhile the real program's going on now i want to raise i want to raise this point to you
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:11.440]  because it's very very important i slavery's terrible it's wrong it's horrible on and on and on
[02:45:11.440 --> 02:45:15.840]  but but look at the penal slave colony of australia it's so successful because the people that
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:21.200]  colonized it were white slaves white prisoners and work brigades look at the u.s for all its
[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:26.960]  problems founded by a district servant slaves you name it rough tough you mean you name it productive
[02:45:26.960 --> 02:45:32.320]  that which does not kill you only makes you stronger and the system knows that so they took
[02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:40.160]  the incredibly powerful wealthy black engine that was that that was absolutely upwardly mobile and
[02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:45.680]  they blew it into a thousand pieces and that's why you've seen the wreckage and the model they've
[02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:50.800]  done to the blacks on record is a model for every community now so i want people to know when you
[02:45:50.800 --> 02:45:57.280]  watch the nightly news the mainstream news and you see those messages in it that all seem liberal
[02:45:57.280 --> 02:46:06.640]  and trendy those are psychological warfare torpedoes your comment on that you know i i want to warn
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:14.800]  everybody who are listening to this radio show when you see a black person who hates the white
[02:46:14.800 --> 02:46:19.200]  person it's because they're white are you see some white person strictly hitting them black
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:25.680]  person the other race because of their in color that's a dumb devil when you see some of these
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:30.320]  people who come on television who don't know they're behind from a hole in the ground when it comes
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:36.560]  to the wall trooper but the problem is in america that's a dumb devil don't worry about the dumb
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:45.200]  devils you might want to pay close attention to the wise satan that's sitting behind the thing that
[02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:52.240]  we don't see every day i'm talking about that five percent of the people who control the world's
[02:46:52.240 --> 02:47:01.920]  global economy those are the real enemies of the united states citizens but it's not even five percent
[02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:07.680]  we've done the math it's not even one percent it's i believe that it's point zero zero zero zero
[02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:13.040]  zero two six i can believe there's only about six thousand globalists that that brag roth cop
[02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:16.880]  wrote a book head of the kissinger group that actually run things i'm telling you i know people
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:21.760]  were fifty million dollars who don't even know how to tie their shoelaces it's a very small
[02:47:21.760 --> 02:47:26.400]  technocratic group but but i want to ask is this why you and we ain't talking about folks that got
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:32.480]  fifty million dollars they ain't got no money the people we're talking about those who have multi-billion
[02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:36.960]  those are the people we're talking about no i agree uh it's so crazy haven't you on an agreement
[02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:42.160]  with almost everything you say let's talk about though uh the spokesman in jacksonville florida
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:46.880]  for the black panther party i want to play this clip and get your your your your take from this
[02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:52.880]  because uh this is the kind of stuff that that the media is using and my whole issue is this
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:56.800]  sounds like the stuff that comes out of the mouths of white supremacists let's go to the black panther
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:00.800]  party in florida here it is speak to the city of jacksonville we wanted to tell our side of the
[02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:08.080]  story that we got involved because when we went to sanford and initial stages there was a attempt
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:14.320]  to cover up this case and so we went down and we investigated and we found out the true facts and
[02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:22.560]  that trevon had been assassinated by wicked white beast who today is talking about he's a hispanic
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:27.280]  and so we're not going to go along with that we don't care because his father's a Jew he's a no good
[02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:34.000]  Jew to sit before the world George Zimmerman and try to justify the brutal assassination of murder
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:40.400]  of trevon modern all right that's enough that's uh mucale mohammed my whole point is that sounds
[02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:46.640]  like the exact same stuff i hear out of the white supremacist all day who do nothing but obsess over
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:53.040]  Jews all day and it just you know i know Jewish people i have Jewish friends they're not off
[02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:58.160]  scheming some great evil and and and i understand that you know in the Rothschilds and people are
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:03.040]  Jewish and are part of the new world order at the tops of it but i see the whole israel palestinian
[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:08.800]  thing as another globalist puppet show your take on on what you just heard from the new black panther
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:16.480]  party well that is my brother brother mohammed i don't know him personally but he wears the name
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:23.520]  mohammed so obviously he's a muslim and i am a muslim i would want i would want to encourage
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:32.800]  my dear brother to go and truly read the holy qaraan and read the sooner the prophet mohammed
[02:49:32.800 --> 02:49:39.600]  please be a party the question was raised to mohammed who did he see in heaven and mohammed
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:47.520]  said he saw jews christians and muslim in heaven in paradise it's not what you call yourself that
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:54.880]  makes you righteous today it's what you do in high duty so to call his father no good to you i don't
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:50:01.120]  know his father but there are some very good jews so every person that wears the title jew don't
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:06.720]  make them no good because now you're saying a law who allows the jews to come into existence and
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:12.080]  see if they would be in paradise your same god is wrong so i would say to my brother what makes

[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:16.880]  like jackal and others that are patiently holding uh you were making some more points here in the
[02:55:16.880 --> 02:55:21.760]  break about when the chinese come marching up 45 repeat that and make any other points about the
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:25.760]  demonstration and your security guys were armed you said some of the pros and women people were
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:30.720]  armed i mean that's exactly what the new world order wants but go ahead it is true that some of
[02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:35.440]  my security were alarmed but those members of my security were those who have legal concealed
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:41.040]  hands-on permits to carry those weapons and those weapons they've carried for years but it's only
[02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:45.040]  those who have those people could stand on can't permit to carry those weapons that was never
[02:55:45.040 --> 02:55:48.960]  anyone yeah but you've got a right to open carry in texas without a permit i agree with
[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:52.960]  your right there i'm saying the globalist would love to get a shooting war going between black
[02:55:52.960 --> 02:55:57.600]  and white oh no doubt about it and there were one or two who had firearms out in the open with
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:56:04.400]  the counter protesters but we would not bother by that because we knew that that was more demonstration
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:10.560]  than actual stuff and you've done you've done open carry demonstrations we have that open carry
[02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:15.600]  demonstrations yes we have and so if it was my desire to have an open carry demonstration i would
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:19.440]  have done that but i have not was it the black panthers that were the first to do that didn't
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:25.920]  khalid mohammad who was the old leader that died dr collett after mohammad yeah he was the guy that
[02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:30.960]  killed the white babies of the military manufacturing center i mean did he still believe that when he
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:36.480]  died i believe that college the college mohammad believes everything he absolutely spoke and
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:40.720]  did before he passed away do you agree that we should kill the babies and kill the white women
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:45.040]  because of the military manufacturing center i believe that which the honorable minister
[02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:51.600]  lost our comment on me and teachers of us we have to kill the mind instead of hatred in america
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:56.560]  to kill the mind instead of no i know but i mean i'm glad to see the views softening because i saw
[02:56:56.560 --> 02:57:03.840]  the anthony hilder debate he did with him when uh when uh uh uh khalid mohammad said you know we
[02:57:03.840 --> 02:57:08.080]  we need to kill all the white people and you've seen these professors say that you don't you don't
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:14.560]  agree with that no you cannot you know instant babies from the womb you don't do no madness like that
[02:57:15.360 --> 02:57:21.280]  that's the same thing that hitler attempted brother minister khalid to mohammad was absolutely
[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:27.360]  in love with it but he was one of the most old uncompromising revolutions we had ever produced
[02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:32.880]  and he was born directly i believe out of the line of the worst oppression among our people and
[02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:37.520]  sure well he died young too do you think he might have been killed i thought he died pretty young
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:41.440]  i believe he absolutely was assassinated but we won't get into who i believe did it either
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:48.400]  that'll be a whole another show yeah i mean what was it a stroke or something like
[02:57:48.400 --> 02:57:54.720]  he's pretty young he died from an aneurysm and he died very young in fact i was in the hospital
[02:57:55.440 --> 02:58:00.480]  when we announced his death i was in the hospital before he passed away i was right there in the
[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:08.000]  very thick of it all when decisions were being made when he was being made and i absolutely
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:13.680]  know for a fact that a lot of things that was done were not right and in fact they were outright
[02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:19.200]  downright suspicious all right well we're gonna have to have you back quant lx we're out of time

[03:00:54.000 --> 03:01:01.600]  like that now uh and and and it's i think he genuinely gets the humanity has to come together
[03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:06.960]  the globalists are trying to play us off against each other race politics works for a while uh but
[03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:10.880]  it's it's just so destructive and i'm telling you so much of what you hear come out of the
[03:01:10.880 --> 03:01:18.000]  black and hispanic radical groups sounds like the kuklux klan and then his racism is promoted by the
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:25.120]  media then it becomes a tactical issue of well i'm i'm not racist but everybody's saying i'm
[03:01:25.120 --> 03:01:29.360]  racist and saying i'm bad they're being racist to me so then you get forced into it it's kind of
[03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:34.400]  like i'm not really a republican i'm a libertarian but the democrats have always hated me because
[03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:38.960]  they're the party are really bringing in the new world order the republicans are kind of their
[03:01:38.960 --> 03:01:46.320]  placeholder and so the republican libertarian arm has been nicer to me and so whether i like it or
[03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:51.520]  not i'm putting that camp and that's the camp you just become part of and the system knows that it
[03:01:51.520 --> 03:01:59.680]  makes you choose a sign and i just wish we would all become aware of the manipulation

[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:56.000]  trying to push uh on americans it's just it's it makes me sick to my stomach it just really does
[03:02:56.880 --> 03:03:00.800]  and uh you know i have two daughters and and i definitely always tell my girls
[03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:06.640]  you know rate rate don't be right there's no such thing as race you know it's all about pure
[03:03:06.640 --> 03:03:10.800]  love you're talking about earlier like i love humanity but but instead of but if you're just
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:14.800]  going to be but you've also got to have some culture and the globalists are overriding all
[03:03:14.800 --> 03:03:19.600]  of our cultures and bringing in this plastic corporate death we know we don't want that
[03:03:21.120 --> 03:03:26.080]  no absolutely not that that's where you that's where you have to be smart about what's going on
[03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:31.360]  you have to be awake you know i tell my friends and my family and everybody in contact with
[03:03:31.360 --> 03:03:35.680]  you know the you got to connect dots you got to be awake you know you you just can't just you
[03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:43.280]  know be in the zombie mode last night i watched uh kasa blanka and uh and it kind of it kind of uh
[03:03:43.280 --> 03:03:48.160]  opened my my mind a little bit about what was going on in this movie they had all the germans
[03:03:48.160 --> 03:03:52.480]  there they had the you know french and then they had a pump your pump for bogart there
[03:03:52.480 --> 03:03:56.640]  you know he was just kind of neutral guy that really cared about any which is more about himself
[03:03:56.640 --> 03:04:02.480]  you have to choose a side right now because uh you know right now united states exactly and they
[03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:07.520]  want you to choose a false side that they control the narrative on they don't want us to come together
[03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:12.240]  under a bill of rights constitution declaration of independence getting out from under the private
[03:04:12.240 --> 03:04:19.120]  fellow reserve that's the enemy they want us fighting and and again it becomes racial because
[03:04:19.120 --> 03:04:24.480]  let's say they program mexico that you're collapsing so come here then they go under democratic party
[03:04:24.480 --> 03:04:29.760]  control you have to oppose that but not because you dislike all these poor refugees of the new
[03:04:29.760 --> 03:04:35.440]  world order you understand it's part of a larger program so it doesn't mean that there aren't strategic
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:40.880]  things that go on it means that you understand the great game and now you're part of the great game
[03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:47.600]  countering it from a master strategic position being aware of getting outside the box get outside
[03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:53.120]  the box step outside the box that's what it's all about become aware of the game and then decide not
[03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:58.800]  to play and to build your own game i'll stare away to the stars we're going to overdrive more calls

[03:09:12.640 --> 03:09:19.280]  hey alex that that actually threw me for a loop uh he came out pretty knowledgeable which i knew he
[03:09:19.280 --> 03:09:25.120]  was but um just i i've talked to michelle williams in tampa florida you remember her the big new
[03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:30.880]  black panther party yeah oh yeah really a moronic person no no no actually on the phone this is
[03:09:30.880 --> 03:09:36.480]  this kind of reminded me of this on the phone she is highly intelligent i've i've spoken with her
[03:09:36.480 --> 03:09:40.960]  i called her out i've been threatened by the new black panther party blah blah blah it doesn't it
[03:09:40.960 --> 03:09:45.600]  doesn't scare me i actually gave my address that come on over but the point being is is i want you
[03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:50.480]  to be careful with this guy with his listeners he'll say one thing come off perfect like a politician
[03:09:50.480 --> 03:09:56.160]  and then turn around and go back to his group and say another thing in a district no no listen
[03:09:56.160 --> 03:10:02.800]  that's why i brought up uh khalid mohammad which if you i mean it's like i quoted it earlier
[03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:06.640]  he said you kill the white babies why because they'll grow up to kill your babies and you kill
[03:10:06.640 --> 03:10:11.200]  the white woman because every nine months she lays down and reinforcement rolls out because of the
[03:10:11.200 --> 03:10:17.200]  military manufacturing center i love i love that clip but we got to find that somewhere
[03:10:17.200 --> 03:10:21.040]  anthony hilder has it it's it's it oh we have it we're gonna play it in a moment
[03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:25.920]  when you talk about just i i could that guy was a nice preacher he had a good baptist sermon i could
[03:10:25.920 --> 03:10:32.160]  go hear him on sunday i love his voice the military a military manufacturing center
[03:10:32.160 --> 03:10:37.360]  uh anyways uh i think i'm gonna change my name to military manufacturing center sir i'm gonna come
[03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:44.640]  back to you marvin uh here is the uh deceased dr mohammad uh here he is white kill the women
[03:10:46.400 --> 03:10:53.120]  first white kill the babies just a little innocent blue-eyed babies because god damn it
[03:10:53.120 --> 03:11:00.080]  they're gonna grow up one day to ruin your babies kill them now white kill the women in south africa
[03:11:00.080 --> 03:11:06.240]  i said kill the women because the women are the military manufacturing center and every nine
[03:11:06.240 --> 03:11:12.800]  months they lay down on their backs and reinforcement rolls out from between their legs so shut down
[03:11:12.800 --> 03:11:19.520]  the military manufacturing center by killing the white woman white kill the elves of crackers
[03:11:19.520 --> 03:11:25.200]  the old crepit crackers in south africa and the hell you think they got old they got old
[03:11:25.200 --> 03:11:31.840]  press and all right that's good we ought to get that black professor to search black professor says
[03:11:31.840 --> 03:11:37.920]  kill all whites was a few years ago and they they defended it my whole point is this is like hitler
[03:11:37.920 --> 03:11:42.960]  i mean that's a genocide kill everybody they don't worry seven percent of the world's white
[03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:48.000]  most whites are quote intermarrying so there's not going to be any white people but don't worry
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:53.360]  if you got lighter skin you're going to get killed because you got devil blood and the devil blood
[03:11:53.360 --> 03:12:00.400]  is the most evil it has got to be dealt with and if you're not as black as dr. mohammed then we're
[03:12:00.400 --> 03:12:08.080]  gonna chop your head off you white devil anyways kind of fun to talk like that hey i can do the
[03:12:08.080 --> 03:12:14.640]  redneck voices i can do the black preacher voices as well i've actually been offered jobs and
[03:12:14.640 --> 03:12:18.720]  voiceovers in hollywood the problem is i have to live out there they want you there to do like
[03:12:18.720 --> 03:12:24.560]  weekly auditions for movies and stuff maybe i should just do all that take my cracker butt out to
[03:12:24.560 --> 03:12:30.560]  hollywood and make a bunch of money and sit around drinking pina coladas but i'm not going to do it
[03:12:30.560 --> 03:12:38.080]  because i'm part of the military manufacturing center man i love talking like that i think i
[03:12:38.080 --> 03:12:44.720]  should be my new persona all right let's go to uh jose i know marvin uh is that what you're talking
[03:12:44.720 --> 03:12:51.280]  about are you saying quantel x talks like that uh yeah i'm just saying you got to be real careful
[03:12:51.280 --> 03:12:57.680]  with him because uh like on the new black panther that's coming from a cracker yes and i'm also in
[03:12:57.680 --> 03:13:03.520]  a biracial marriage and she's parked back so i don't know what i'm gonna do well those babies
[03:13:03.520 --> 03:13:08.320]  are evil because they're part white need to be dealt with yeah but anyway like on the arkansas
[03:13:08.320 --> 03:13:12.160]  new black panther party they're talking about george zimmerin must be killed blah blah blah
[03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:18.240]  quantel associates with these people so don't i when he said he wasn't part of them he's probably
[03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:24.560]  not but he still associates with them but listen i just got the guy on so we could have a discussion
[03:13:24.560 --> 03:13:30.560]  and not just have a fight with each other and it was actually very it threw me for a loop i was like
[03:13:30.560 --> 03:13:34.400]  wow and he and he pulled the michelle williams because i would talk to michelle williams on the
[03:13:34.400 --> 03:13:38.160]  phone and she would tell me we got to do this this and this i said makes perfect sense then she
[03:13:38.160 --> 03:13:42.320]  would go back out to her but she knows she doesn't get on the media unless she says kill what you
[03:13:42.320 --> 03:13:48.080]  know all that kind of stuff they say i appreciate your call let's talk to jose in california jose
[03:13:48.080 --> 03:13:56.640]  you're on the air go ahead amen uh that guy is a liar uh the blacks are the killers uh you're
[03:13:56.640 --> 03:14:01.840]  being sarcastic that's enough i appreciate your call jose you probably have a last name like
[03:14:01.840 --> 03:14:07.200]  johnson or something now you're calling i mean there's just no people just love fighting over
[03:14:07.200 --> 03:14:15.920]  everything i uh the stupid simmerman stuff man i tell you this is no end to it oh boy let's talk
[03:14:15.920 --> 03:14:20.880]  to chris in new york chris you're on the air should i do the whole show in the voice of uh khalid
[03:14:20.880 --> 03:14:33.280]  mohammad info wars dot com tonight seven o'clock the news al shopton step aside we're gonna expose
[03:14:33.280 --> 03:14:48.000]  these racist cracker asses what they are sorry oh my sorry go ahead hello yes sir you can turn your
[03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:56.160]  radio off okay uh yeah i'm calling because of the fact that um the uh guest that was in the show just
[03:14:56.160 --> 03:15:05.120]  a minute ago um said the simmer man and quote said that he's an effing dog and that he doesn't
[03:15:05.120 --> 03:15:10.400]  belong around here i think the fact that he said he doesn't belong around he it was because of the
[03:15:10.400 --> 03:15:16.160]  fact that he actually did not live around that area and the only kid and the only moment i think
[03:15:16.160 --> 03:15:20.640]  there was some profiling because he was black and wearing a hoodie i mean look while i was growing up
[03:15:20.640 --> 03:15:24.160]  if i was walking around between houses people come out and say what are you doing i mean i mean that
[03:15:24.160 --> 03:15:29.360]  kind of stuff plus older folks don't know and people like simmerman looks pretty pretty square
[03:15:29.360 --> 03:15:34.880]  that that hoodies are have been in for like a decade the hoodies are definitely in around my
[03:15:34.880 --> 03:15:39.040]  office because i keep it so cold around here everybody was like arctic outfits but i mean
[03:15:39.040 --> 03:15:45.920]  what do you think overall about all of this chris well the overall i think that it has to be hyped up
[03:15:45.920 --> 03:15:53.680]  up too much to be used as a political tool absolutely absolutely from the fact that um
[03:15:54.320 --> 03:15:59.840]  let me tell you something when you give out your money to the bank you become an insecure
[03:15:59.840 --> 03:16:06.160]  creditor and the bank is a debtor the fact that it's not being talked about in the mainstream media
[03:16:06.160 --> 03:16:14.080]  is that barack lobama made us all unsecured creditors to the private fed absolutely god bless
[03:16:14.080 --> 03:16:18.560]  you well it's like lewis furkan he says a lot of stuff i agree with like you want to build up the
[03:16:18.560 --> 03:16:23.200]  black community spend your money in your local community i mean i go out of my way to try to
[03:16:23.200 --> 03:16:29.120]  go to little shops little places uh whether black white ispanic i don't care i like to go to mom and
[03:16:29.120 --> 03:16:34.400]  pops usually the food's better anyways i try to go to little stores i try to i try to go with small
[03:16:34.400 --> 03:16:40.240]  local companies if they can give good service and a lot of times it is better um plus big companies
[03:16:40.240 --> 03:16:44.480]  like the secret police or something they've always got a side business info and so they're sitting there
[03:16:44.480 --> 03:16:47.920]  you know you're like having a police interrogation you know with the carpet cleaner or whatever
[03:16:48.560 --> 03:16:55.360]  with the yard people um so i mean it's very very simple things like that really makes sense i mean
[03:16:55.360 --> 03:17:01.760]  i want i wish mexico was like switzerland man with jet ports and awesome houses and it's beautiful
[03:17:01.760 --> 03:17:06.960]  down there i'd i'd say merge mexico with the us i don't care what color the people are i care about
[03:17:06.960 --> 03:17:13.680]  the culture and the culture of mexico is a failed kleptocracy we don't want to merge with that and
[03:17:13.680 --> 03:17:19.920]  that's like spoken like a blue-eyed devil let's talk to lori in arkansas last caller i have time
