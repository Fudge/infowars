[00:00:04.878 --> 00:00:09.722]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:11.303]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:12.845]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:17.048]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.048 --> 00:00:21.112]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.862 --> 00:00:55.728]  Ladies and gentlemen, I do not let the music play out sometimes at the start of a broadcast to try to peak your entrance.
[00:00:55.728 --> 00:01:00.390]  It is not a dramatic flourish that I am engaging in.
[00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:11.496]  I am so busy during the breaks and right before the show feverishly looking over all of the unbelievably important news that I have to be flogged
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.441]  into my chair to begin the transmission.
[00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:31.228]  So again, thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday, the 23rd day of July 2013, the day after the momentous birth of the future King of England, Count Dracula the 27th.
[00:01:31.228 --> 00:01:37.951]  The parasitical visage, the whole world rejoicing over hereditary dictatorships.
[00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:41.673]  I want to know why there's not teacups with Kim Jong-un on them.
[00:01:42.714 --> 00:01:48.218]  And why, you know, when he marries, there needs to be the royal baby!
[00:01:48.218 --> 00:01:51.640]  The royal baby is about to be born!
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.821]  But I need to get over that now.
[00:01:52.821 --> 00:02:00.126]  It's just I'm being bombarded with race warfare constantly by the establishment, which is a British globalist divide-and-conquer technique.
[00:02:02.187 --> 00:02:21.118]  And they're being taught to love people riding around in Disneyland carriages, and to watch women mainly fawning everywhere over the queen, who they have no idea how evil and wicked those people are, and that Savelle, the admitted necrophiliac pedophile,
[00:02:21.778 --> 00:02:25.243]  Was their best friend and would bring them special goodies.
[00:02:25.243 --> 00:02:28.007]  And then I have to watch them being worshipped everywhere.
[00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:33.335]  It is just beyond disgusting and makes me want to vomit!
[00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:39.034]  And it just makes me want to throw out an expletive.
[00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:45.556]  I've decided the new expletive I'm going to use that the FCC may find me for is, Joe Biden!
[00:02:45.556 --> 00:02:47.416]  Bye Joe Biden, you've done it!
[00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:50.897]  I've decided that that's like a profanity now.
[00:02:50.897 --> 00:02:56.679]  Like if I slam my hand in a door, but it's only profanity if you say the word Joe Biden in a British accent.
[00:02:56.679 --> 00:03:00.540]  It makes no sense, it's nonsensical.
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.582]  I'm probably developing some type of syndrome, but the point is I just want to say over and over again, Joe Biden!
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.421]  Whatever.
[00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:14.427]  We're going to go to break and come back here because, you know, why do we do this?
[00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:18.572]  Why is there a weird five minute segment we started eight after and everybody else starts at six or seven after?
[00:03:18.572 --> 00:03:23.258]  Because I didn't like running network news on my show going back 16 years ago when it got syndicated.
[00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.841]  And they said, fine, do the five minutes, we'll have a different clock.
[00:03:26.841 --> 00:03:28.823]  But I keep saying we're going to do this.
[00:03:28.823 --> 00:03:36.229]  The time has come, the time has come now that we must go to the regular clock at least at the start of the hour.
[00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:44.756]  So I guess I need to just make that decision and go with, we put feelers out to our radio affiliates asking what they think.
[00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:49.631]  We're going to be doing that soon because it's almost like a false start or something.
[00:03:49.631 --> 00:04:02.306]  I realize some listeners cannot hear us on AM and FM and things when I come in in this segment and so maybe now I'll just play like elevator music, just looped in a British accent.
[00:04:02.306 --> 00:04:06.691]  Joe Biden, Joe Biden, Joe Biden, Joe Biden.
[00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:15.993]  The whole place that that comes from, ladies and gentlemen, is I did a little video last night.
[00:04:15.993 --> 00:04:20.284]  We played a clip from the TV series back in the 80s, V, where the two babies are born.
[00:04:21.897 --> 00:04:31.639]  I said that basically Kate Middleton, actually the Duchess of Cambridge, excuse me, had actually given birth to two clones of Joe Biden and Barack Obama.
[00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.981]  And when the Joe Biden baby comes out, he has a little snake tongue shoots out, and I say, Joe Biden!
[00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:41.182]  Right there at that point, as I'm announcing them, like whenever they have
[00:04:42.142 --> 00:04:45.525]  People at these Washingtoners walk in, they'll announce, who's been knighted?
[00:04:45.525 --> 00:04:48.327]  And it's like, oh, look, it's, who's here?
[00:04:48.327 --> 00:04:49.308]  It's Colin Powell!
[00:04:49.308 --> 00:04:52.270]  And they'll go, that is the Knight Commander of the Realm!
[00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.415]  And even effected an accent, so, you're not truly trendy, unless you've been knighted by El Queenie!
[00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.593]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[00:05:03.593 --> 00:05:09.976]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:16.358]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:05:16.758 --> 00:05:19.060]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.401]  They're the good guys.
[00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:23.483]  You can trust SimpliSafe to protect your family.
[00:05:23.483 --> 00:05:27.986]  SimpliSafe was created by a Harvard Business School engineer, and it's revolutionary.

[00:06:04.156 --> 00:06:05.436]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:05.436 --> 00:06:09.358]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.358 --> 00:06:11.578]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:11.578 --> 00:06:17.460]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.702]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.122 --> 00:06:30.107]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.107 --> 00:06:34.290]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.574]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:38.574 --> 00:06:44.519]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:48.082]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.082 --> 00:06:50.063]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.063 --> 00:06:50.484]  It's here.

[00:08:11.147 --> 00:08:14.731]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:14.731 --> 00:08:18.896]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:29.082 --> 00:08:40.065]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, and we are broadcasting worldwide on this 23rd day of July, 2013.
[00:08:40.065 --> 00:08:47.288]  We have one of the national leaders and the head of the Houston New Black Panther Party, Quanell X, joining us.
[00:08:47.288 --> 00:08:54.890]  Quanell X has actually been on the broadcast before, because even though I disagree with a lot of his statements and politics,
[00:08:57.122 --> 00:09:08.130]  He is one of the only people that would stand up say when black people are having their children taken for no reason other than the fact that they are poor and the dad works two jobs.
[00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:13.593]  The CPS now nationwide says that being poor is a reason to have your children taken.
[00:09:13.593 --> 00:09:18.697]  No drugs, no abuse, no nothing, plenty of food, healthy.
[00:09:18.697 --> 00:09:22.600]  Oh my gosh, you know, you live in a little house at the storage facility.
[00:09:23.976 --> 00:09:27.481]  And you're the manager of the storage facility and kind of the night watchman.
[00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:29.845]  And then you also mow yards in the area.
[00:09:29.845 --> 00:09:31.447]  And you're married and have four kids.
[00:09:31.447 --> 00:09:33.811]  We're going to take them all.
[00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:36.014]  And then who went and raised a stink about it?
[00:09:36.014 --> 00:09:37.717]  We sent reporters, confirmed it.
[00:09:37.717 --> 00:09:38.578]  Quanell X.
[00:09:39.801 --> 00:09:41.101]  I don't know.
[00:09:56.324 --> 00:09:59.288]  Is there anything in this world outside of black and white?
[00:09:59.288 --> 00:10:03.013]  Does he know that white people are about 7% of the world population?
[00:10:03.013 --> 00:10:09.001]  Does he know all over the world there's just human beings going through the same tyranny under the global New World Order?
[00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:10.343]  Or is it just too fun?
[00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.772]  To get into this whole race game and play along with it.
[00:10:14.772 --> 00:10:20.635]  So, Quan LX, and you've had the big demonstrations he's had with the folks with the guns.
[00:10:20.635 --> 00:10:21.596]  They've got guns.
[00:10:21.596 --> 00:10:25.398]  The pro-Zimmerman people have got guns.
[00:10:25.398 --> 00:10:26.899]  It is pretty serious stuff.
[00:10:26.899 --> 00:10:28.740]  By the way, there's a story up on Infowars.com.
[00:10:30.325 --> 00:10:35.488]  It's also up on DrudgeReport.com, that's where we found it, from Gateway Pundit, and they did some great research.
[00:10:35.488 --> 00:10:39.450]  And I've got Don Salazar doing a report on this to show some background.
[00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:57.941]  Because this is a great report, but what we always do at InfoWars.com is we show you the Justice Department's own numbers, where they admit 90 plus percent of so-called hate crimes, you can look this up, it's a major phenomenon in the last 30 years or so, are committed by
[00:10:59.673 --> 00:11:07.860]  The Jewish synagogue itself against itself, or the black students against themselves, as a attention-getting thing.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:13.606]  You can become a movie star, basically, and be all over the news, and then, you know, not have to do your finals.
[00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:15.467]  It always happens right before finals.
[00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:16.308]  People are freaked out.
[00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:16.748]  What do they do?
[00:11:17.947 --> 00:11:23.372]  The old days, somebody would stage a car wreck to get out of finals or whatever, you know, being so nervous or whatever about it.
[00:11:23.372 --> 00:11:37.825]  Now you just spray paint a swastika, or you burn a cross in your own front yard, or you burn the local black church down and say you saw white guys doing it, or you carve, you know, on your face the KKK and you're black, or they've had white women
[00:11:39.246 --> 00:11:42.128]  Carve Obama on their face and then say black men did it.
[00:11:42.128 --> 00:11:45.231]  I mean this is, this is, whites do it too.
[00:11:45.231 --> 00:11:53.437]  It's a false flag, self-inflicted wound, staged event where you try to frame people.
[00:11:53.437 --> 00:11:58.741]  And I could take one look at the woman, and I even said this yesterday to the crew.
[00:11:58.741 --> 00:12:04.045]  You could take one look at the woman, and again we're doing our own article on this that shows their report but shows some background on this.
[00:12:05.077 --> 00:12:14.633]  Left-wing plant at Houston pro-Zimmerman rally is far-left activist and they've confirmed her name and who she works with and that she went out with a sign
[00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:22.955]  It appears the other leftist left her alone, and the national media zoomed in on, we're racist and proud.
[00:12:22.955 --> 00:12:33.823]  And the media went with it, didn't go over and ask her, MSNBC and others, hey, the Houston Chronicle didn't go over and ask her, hey is this for real?
[00:12:33.823 --> 00:12:34.484]  No one did that.
[00:12:34.484 --> 00:12:37.306]  In fact, one more thing for Adan to add if he's listening.
[00:12:37.306 --> 00:12:43.832]  Add, not once, not twice, not three times, four times I can remember, they would have people dress up in John Deere hats,
[00:12:44.946 --> 00:12:49.349]  Wear overalls and go out and say, I love Rand Paul!
[00:12:49.349 --> 00:12:52.011]  And I ain't black in words!
[00:12:52.011 --> 00:12:54.492]  And Mexicans!
[00:12:54.492 --> 00:13:02.558]  And over and over again they had signs, all of it, saying I'm with the KKK and I like Rand Paul!
[00:13:02.558 --> 00:13:05.139]  Remember three years ago when he was running for the Senate and winning?
[00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:09.022]  I don't believe that many years has already passed.
[00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:09.862]  The point is,
[00:13:10.928 --> 00:13:11.668]  Is that they did?
[00:13:11.668 --> 00:13:15.451]  Folks, I have been doing a pro-gun rally before.
[00:13:15.451 --> 00:13:17.012]  Mike Hanson, by the way, has the footage of all this.
[00:13:17.012 --> 00:13:17.612]  We're digging it out.
[00:13:17.612 --> 00:13:20.294]  A few weeks from now he's going to bring me a big thing of archives.
[00:13:20.294 --> 00:13:21.274]  We're going to dig through it.
[00:13:21.274 --> 00:13:23.015]  I'm going to put all this stuff on the web.
[00:13:23.015 --> 00:13:28.819]  Where we'd be at a rally and there'd be guys show up in Ku Klux Klan outfits and I'd fall into their car.
[00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:32.180]  And I'd go, that's a Democratic Party Union sticker!
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.741]  You guys are Democrats!
[00:13:33.741 --> 00:13:36.582]  They'd be like, F you Jones, we're gonna get you!
[00:13:36.582 --> 00:13:38.423]  I mean, I've got this kind of stuff on tape.
[00:13:38.423 --> 00:13:40.323]  Just bombshell.
[00:13:40.323 --> 00:13:42.624]  I've been through this over and over.
[00:13:42.624 --> 00:13:44.145]  It's theatre, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:46.257 --> 00:13:48.918]  Yeah, hit refresh on that, guys, so it'll actually come up with a photo.
[00:13:48.918 --> 00:13:54.320]  Or give me a document cam and I'll actually show TV viewers what I'm talking about.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.742]  Yeah, yeah, we can document cam right in here and I'll pull this up for people.
[00:13:58.742 --> 00:14:03.504]  Left-wing plant at Houston pro-Zimmerman rally is far-left activist.
[00:14:03.504 --> 00:14:04.705]  Oh, I see you were pulling up.
[00:14:04.705 --> 00:14:05.525]  Story about Rand Paul.
[00:14:05.525 --> 00:14:05.905]  Good job.
[00:14:05.905 --> 00:14:06.726]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:14:06.726 --> 00:14:08.706]  We're racist and proud.
[00:14:08.706 --> 00:14:14.749]  I mean, why didn't other reporters from the Tea Party groups that were there go over and say, hey, you're fake?
[00:14:16.604 --> 00:14:23.366]  And they're so disdainful, folks, they'll tell you they're fake to your face and then laugh at you.
[00:14:23.366 --> 00:14:26.966]  So, here's a false flag.
[00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:38.709]  By the way, George Zimmerman, a SUV turned over and had gas leaking and he ran over with a fire extinguisher and drugged the people out of the car.
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:47.207]  It's funny, Saturday I was driving back from the coast and this guy was about 30, 40, runs a red light, smashes this old lady T-Bones.
[00:14:47.207 --> 00:14:51.511]  I was three cars back, but I stopped in case witnesses were needed until the police got there.
[00:14:51.511 --> 00:14:57.197]  I'm not some hero, but I did see that people that were closer to the crash than I was just drove on by.
[00:14:57.197 --> 00:15:01.080]  And by the way, that's illegal in Texas and it should be illegal.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.523]  Failure to render aid is unbelievably disgusting.
[00:15:04.978 --> 00:15:05.339]  I don't
[00:15:23.587 --> 00:15:33.232]  I just couldn't believe that other, the people closer to the wreck than I was, I was back like three, four cars, I saw it happen, didn't, didn't, didn't go render aid to this woman.
[00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:37.674]  I mean, wouldn't you want your grandmother to, to have people stop and help her?
[00:15:37.674 --> 00:15:40.396]  It's like when I saw a lady choking once, there was like 25 people around her.
[00:15:40.936 --> 00:15:43.958]  Going 9-1-1, 9-1-1 like parrots, and no one was helping the woman.
[00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.660]  And then I had to physically pull them out of the way.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.121]  They're like, hey, are you trained?
[00:15:48.121 --> 00:15:49.182]  Hey, wait for the police!
[00:15:49.182 --> 00:15:52.825]  And then as soon as I got the woman to cough the big piece of bread up, they're like, you're a hero!
[00:15:52.825 --> 00:15:54.926]  But were looking at me real weird, and I'm like, we're gonna get sued.
[00:15:54.926 --> 00:15:58.589]  So I had to pick that woman up, and I thought I might have, you know, heard a rib or something.
[00:15:58.589 --> 00:16:00.430]  But the woman weighed like 300 pounds.
[00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.391]  270 pounds or so.
[00:16:01.391 --> 00:16:03.433]  And then we got out of there.
[00:16:03.433 --> 00:16:10.178]  Because in America, helping somebody, it's true, is, is, is, is, is prasada non grata.
[00:16:11.581 --> 00:16:20.868]  But Zimmerman, we have the tweets up on InfoWars.com of people attacking Zimmerman for helping.
[00:16:20.868 --> 00:16:22.949]  So we're going to be going over.
[00:16:24.944 --> 00:16:50.974]  uh... that report as well and now we have the justice department and now we have all of these congressman coming out and i'm gonna cover this in the next segment and saying that we need to ban guns and ban concealed carry all over the country as a civil right the guns are racist and i told you this was coming and you saw it back during the whole uh...
[00:16:52.737 --> 00:16:57.621]  Sandy Hook situation where on the news they said gun owners collectively caused this.
[00:16:57.621 --> 00:17:00.004]  You saw the headlines about gun owners.
[00:17:00.004 --> 00:17:01.125]  You know, we're sick of you.
[00:17:01.125 --> 00:17:02.225]  You killed those kids.
[00:17:02.225 --> 00:17:09.952]  And then all these black activists from Al Sharpton to reporters at Fox Sports were like, I'm telling you the NRA is the new clan.
[00:17:09.952 --> 00:17:11.834]  They want to kill black people.
[00:17:11.834 --> 00:17:18.460]  And Michael Moore came out and said, I'm telling you, this is a quote, racist white people want their guns because they're scared of black people.
[00:17:21.078 --> 00:17:30.585]  Unbelievable, when it's black people denied ownership of guns in all these major cities, that's why you have such a high crime rate, the criminals can run wild.
[00:17:30.585 --> 00:17:36.209]  I mean, they've done this in European countries and the crime rate explodes because they've disarmed the people.
[00:17:36.209 --> 00:17:44.614]  It empowers predators and that's how you take disarming black cities, cities that are mainly black or largely black, all are disarmed.
[00:17:45.675 --> 00:17:47.636]  The Klan is the Democratic Party, folks.
[00:17:47.636 --> 00:17:50.957]  They've never let blacks have guns, and they're never going to let you have guns.
[00:17:50.957 --> 00:17:52.218]  You belong to them.
[00:17:52.218 --> 00:17:56.420]  They're going to run the welfare programs they administer to suck off of.
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:02.863]  They're going to run the food stamp programs, and you're going to be used as a political weapon to bring down the rest of the country, just like Mexican laborers are.
[00:18:02.863 --> 00:18:09.266]  They're not bad people, but they're subsidized with government welfare at a level nobody else is to help bring down the wages.
[00:18:09.266 --> 00:18:13.708]  That's a corporate subsidy, so they can pay illegals things that they couldn't live off of.
[00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:15.856]  Without the government subsidy.
[00:18:15.856 --> 00:18:17.997]  It's a plan.
[00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:24.899]  So George Zimmerman helped save a bunch of people and now he is being demonized as usual.
[00:18:24.899 --> 00:18:27.340]  We're going to get into the latest on the NSA.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:32.301]  And Paul Watson has chilling photographs of Jesus Christ desecrated.
[00:18:34.841 --> 00:18:39.065]  The crucifix machine-gunned and bombed by Al-Qaeda.
[00:18:39.065 --> 00:18:41.487]  Christians having their heads cut off, thrown off buildings.
[00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:42.828]  I mean, you know the mass murder.
[00:18:42.828 --> 00:18:47.532]  There's new photos of churches ransacked all over Syria.
[00:18:47.532 --> 00:18:50.255]  Churches are also ransacked all over Egypt.
[00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:51.315]  That's being reported today.
[00:18:51.315 --> 00:18:53.297]  We're going to be getting into that.
[00:18:53.297 --> 00:18:57.381]  Obama-backed Syrian rebels ransacked Christian villages and churches.
[00:18:57.381 --> 00:19:00.463]  Christians attacked in Egypt by Muslim Brotherhood supporters en masse.
[00:19:01.424 --> 00:19:06.408]  More videos of them chopping their heads off, beating their heads in, and throwing them off roofs.
[00:19:06.408 --> 00:19:11.512]  These videos are pouring out and will never be on any news channel in the United States.
[00:19:11.512 --> 00:19:13.153]  This is the plan.
[00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:15.575]  Exterminate Christians in Africa.
[00:19:15.575 --> 00:19:19.098]  Exterminate black Christians in Libya after Al Qaeda took over.
[00:19:19.098 --> 00:19:21.580]  Exterminate Christians in the
[00:19:26.277 --> 00:19:27.460]  Muslim Crescent?
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.165]  The Red Crescent?
[00:19:29.165 --> 00:19:30.328]  South of Russia?
[00:19:30.328 --> 00:19:31.471]  I mean, it's on!
[00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:32.293]  It is a UN program!
[00:19:35.129 --> 00:19:42.193]  And meanwhile, the TSA says they won't stick their hands down your pants anymore if you fingerprint when you go to the airport.
[00:19:42.193 --> 00:19:43.973]  But then they still might stick their hands down your pants.
[00:19:43.973 --> 00:19:45.814]  And that's been the plan all along.
[00:19:45.814 --> 00:19:48.856]  They're now expanding checkpoints outside the airports.
[00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:52.538]  We've got breaking news on that and so much more.
[00:19:52.538 --> 00:19:57.280]  And we're going to premiere some radio theater here at the bottom of the hour.

[00:21:35.502 --> 00:21:41.226]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:41.226 --> 00:21:43.388]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[00:21:43.388 --> 00:21:44.809]  No word about IRAs.

[00:23:00.294 --> 00:23:03.435]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[00:23:03.435 --> 00:23:07.257]  At eFoods Direct, we're again celebrating Food Freedom Month.

[00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:29.289]  I think so.
[00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:04.021]  We're good.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.342]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:24:21.342 --> 00:24:24.764]  And I mentioned this, but let's drill into this right now.
[00:24:24.764 --> 00:24:30.968]  First off, confirmed left-wing plant at Houston Zimmerman rally is a far-left activist.
[00:24:30.968 --> 00:24:41.474]  And they had a bunch of these people out there to hold up racist signs, to hold up stupid signs, and to say stupid things to the media, and to be quoted by the media.
[00:24:41.474 --> 00:24:47.198]  And the media knew, the establishment media knew full well what they were doing, engaging in a piece of theater to deceive the public.
[00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:59.159]  A photo from the Houston pro-Zimmerman counter rally at the NBPP anti-Zimmerman rally picked up by AP shows a woman holding a sign that read racist and proud.
[00:24:59.159 --> 00:25:01.181]  Again, that was picked up by the AP.
[00:25:01.181 --> 00:25:03.002]  You will not get a retraction.
[00:25:03.002 --> 00:25:06.025]  They're guaranteed in on it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:06.025 --> 00:25:12.671]  That looked incoherent with other reports that pro-Zimmerman side, the Houston Chronicle, identified her as Renee Vaughn.
[00:25:13.815 --> 00:25:25.419]  And then it goes on to break down that the Austin resident Renee Vaughn echoed the signs, ugly statements by yelling, we're racist, we're proud, we're better because we're white.
[00:25:25.419 --> 00:25:31.601]  This was on MSNBC last night, folks, at the group as they passed according to the Chronicle.
[00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:34.242]  So, trying to stir stuff up.
[00:25:34.242 --> 00:25:36.644]  The act to smear the Zimmerman supporters is racist.
[00:25:36.644 --> 00:25:38.826]  She probably works with the Justice Department, folks.
[00:25:38.826 --> 00:25:40.127]  This should be investigated.
[00:25:40.127 --> 00:25:47.693]  As racist, with a leftist plant working as a photo and comment was picked up and spread worldwide.
[00:25:48.633 --> 00:25:55.296]  Scanning the internet, we found that Renee Vaughn from Austin worked as a far-left environmental group, the Texas Campaign for the Environment.
[00:25:55.296 --> 00:25:57.097]  And that is federally funded, by the way.
[00:25:57.097 --> 00:26:01.719]  Renee was even, her photo linked to the far-left environmental website.
[00:26:01.719 --> 00:26:05.320]  And it shows her right there with the federally funded group.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.062]  And I'm telling you, we should add in our article, I know this group.
[00:26:08.062 --> 00:26:10.943]  They're a land-grab group for the big banks.
[00:26:10.943 --> 00:26:12.724]  Not about real environmental issues.
[00:26:12.724 --> 00:26:15.525]  They may have useful idiots in the organization, I don't know.
[00:26:15.525 --> 00:26:17.766]  But I know this group, they get federal funds.
[00:26:19.076 --> 00:26:21.898]  And so you have a federally funded operative.
[00:26:21.898 --> 00:26:23.220]  Guaranteed.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.260]  Guaranteed.
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.622]  Confirmed.
[00:26:25.622 --> 00:26:26.702]  And they don't even care.
[00:26:26.702 --> 00:26:28.844]  They even say their real name.
[00:26:28.844 --> 00:26:32.928]  Because they know the media isn't going to cover it.
[00:26:32.928 --> 00:26:37.491]  Just like they edited Zimmerman to make it sound like he was racist.
[00:26:37.491 --> 00:26:38.873]  There's a black guy out here!
[00:26:38.873 --> 00:26:39.553]  Look at him!
[00:26:39.553 --> 00:26:40.254]  Instead it's a...
[00:26:41.409 --> 00:26:46.073]  This guy here, he's looking in things, doing things, he looks, he's acting weird like he's on drugs, blah, blah, blah.
[00:26:46.073 --> 00:26:47.194]  Okay, where's he going, where's he going?
[00:26:47.194 --> 00:26:49.677]  Okay, well, is he white, Hispanic, black?
[00:26:49.677 --> 00:26:50.718]  He looks black.
[00:26:50.718 --> 00:26:54.841]  See, they're all manipulating you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:58.144]  Meanwhile, there's a whole world of serious things going on.
[00:26:58.144 --> 00:27:03.289]  Now, I've said this day one, it's about making owning guns racial.
[00:27:04.679 --> 00:27:14.762]  And coming out with 180-degree frauds, 180 degrees from the truth, and saying, ladies and gentlemen, worldwide, it is racist to own guns.
[00:27:14.762 --> 00:27:23.405]  You have a right to be free in your community of no guns, while the government has the monopoly of force and rules over you, and criminals don't follow the law and abuse you.
[00:27:23.405 --> 00:27:24.405]  It doesn't work.
[00:27:24.405 --> 00:27:25.586]  But they know it doesn't work.
[00:27:25.586 --> 00:27:28.226]  It's about a monopoly of force in the U.N.'
[00:27:28.206 --> 00:27:29.087]  's own treaty.
[00:27:29.087 --> 00:27:32.548]  They say the state must have the monopoly of force.
[00:27:32.548 --> 00:27:32.988]  Look it up.
[00:27:34.118 --> 00:27:34.486]  And a deer!
[00:27:35.762 --> 00:27:44.629]  July 7th, 2001, ratified in the original treaty, and the new treaty says we implement according to these agreements.
[00:27:44.629 --> 00:27:48.291]  Just like Obamacare says we get a blank check.
[00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:51.213]  Or the NSA cybersecurity is a blank check.
[00:27:51.213 --> 00:27:53.055]  Or the amnesty bill is a blank check.
[00:27:53.055 --> 00:27:55.096]  They're dictatorial blank checks.
[00:27:55.096 --> 00:27:56.738]  And that's what the UN treaty does.
[00:27:56.738 --> 00:28:02.322]  And that's why Forbes and even the Wall Street Journal have had to admit it goes after individuals' guns.
[00:28:02.322 --> 00:28:05.124]  It says states can have guns, but not people.
[00:28:06.892 --> 00:28:16.097]  And now Representative Luis Gutierrez calls for House hearings on Trayvon Martin and gun control.
[00:28:16.097 --> 00:28:17.558]  Washington Times.
[00:28:17.558 --> 00:28:18.298]  Boom.
[00:28:18.298 --> 00:28:23.441]  I heard him this morning, because I monitor enemy channels, on XM MSNBC.
[00:28:23.441 --> 00:28:26.563]  I'm saying XM's an enemy, but you know they carry enemy operations on there.
[00:28:27.561 --> 00:28:29.923]  And, literally, this is enemy operations.
[00:28:29.923 --> 00:28:31.244]  I'm not just saying that.
[00:28:31.244 --> 00:28:34.406]  This is an occupation takeover grid.
[00:28:34.406 --> 00:28:35.507]  Here's another one.
[00:28:35.507 --> 00:28:38.809]  NRA holder exploiting Trayvon Martin death to push gun control to the Hill.
[00:28:38.809 --> 00:28:40.090]  Yeah, no kidding.
[00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:43.273]  NRA blast Eric Holder for pushing gun control on Trayvon Martin's back.
[00:28:43.273 --> 00:28:48.196]  Pelosi, Congress must uphold oath to protect and defend the Constitution by passing gun control.
[00:28:48.196 --> 00:28:48.817]  CNS News.
[00:28:48.817 --> 00:28:50.418]  See, this is the whole thing.
[00:28:50.418 --> 00:28:53.320]  Bloomberg goes, I'm the biggest Second Amendment supporter in the world.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.362]  Second Amendment means I take all your guns.
[00:28:57.093 --> 00:28:58.614]  I believe in a Fourth Amendment.
[00:28:58.614 --> 00:29:01.895]  We're going to have police without warrants search everybody on the street.
[00:29:01.895 --> 00:29:03.996]  You have a right to be a slave.
[00:29:03.996 --> 00:29:11.659]  George Zimmerman, ladies and gentlemen, look at the Twitter users after he helped save those people in the overturned car.
[00:29:11.659 --> 00:29:14.880]  Supposedly, George Zimmerman saved a family from an overturned car last week.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.821]  Well, I say F him.
[00:29:17.537 --> 00:29:18.578]  The family's never been saved.
[00:29:18.578 --> 00:29:19.720]  Were they black?
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.542]  If not, I still say, F him.
[00:29:21.542 --> 00:29:22.703]  You know, on and on and on.
[00:29:22.703 --> 00:29:24.065]  You don't know who this guy is.
[00:29:24.065 --> 00:29:26.408]  You don't know if he really did this on purpose.
[00:29:26.408 --> 00:29:33.596]  I mean, stop being so stupid and hating somebody you don't know while the New World Order puts fluoride in your water that lowers your IQ 20 points.
[00:29:34.938 --> 00:29:39.062]  They've stolen all of our advanced intellects that some of us would have had.
[00:29:39.062 --> 00:29:40.564]  They've robbed us all!
[00:29:40.564 --> 00:29:41.825]  We've got an incredible film.
[00:29:41.825 --> 00:29:42.646]  It's Radio Theater.
[00:29:42.646 --> 00:29:44.168]  It works well with radio.
[00:29:44.168 --> 00:29:46.991]  Coming up, the full video's up on Infowars.com.
[00:29:46.991 --> 00:29:48.132]  It's called Purge.
[00:29:48.132 --> 00:29:49.053]  It needs to go viral.
[00:29:49.053 --> 00:29:49.674]  It's coming up.
[00:29:49.674 --> 00:29:51.075]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.075 --> 00:29:53.598]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.598 --> 00:29:56.281]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.425 --> 00:30:04.307]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:30:04.307 --> 00:30:09.810]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:17.554]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:30:17.554 --> 00:30:26.658]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:34.066]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:30:34.066 --> 00:30:35.648]  All of this is happening so fast.
[00:30:35.648 --> 00:30:36.909]  You need to be ahead of the game.
[00:30:36.909 --> 00:30:42.855]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[00:30:43.536 --> 00:30:46.797]  There is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[00:31:05.379 --> 00:31:12.388]  At Silverlungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[00:33:21.798 --> 00:33:34.371]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:34.371 --> 00:33:41.418]  Monday through Friday, we're here for three hours live, 12 noon to 3 Eastern, back weeknight, 7 o'clock, InfoWars at Nightly News.
[00:33:41.418 --> 00:33:42.760]  I'm going to make an announcement here.
[00:33:44.324 --> 00:33:48.067]  about the film contest after we premiere this film.
[00:33:48.067 --> 00:33:52.029]  TV viewers can watch it right now at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:53.991]  PrisonPlanet.tv members can also see it.
[00:33:53.991 --> 00:34:02.296]  They get all the films, the nightly news, all the free podcasts, all the free iPhone and Droid apps are all at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:34:02.296 --> 00:34:07.500]  I'm going to tweet that out again while this film is premiering here on air.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.041]  Now we've gotten over 600 entries.
[00:34:09.041 --> 00:34:10.222]  They're all incredible.
[00:34:10.222 --> 00:34:13.184]  We're down to the top 35 right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:13.664 --> 00:34:15.751]  Forward slash Revere.
[00:34:17.998 --> 00:34:20.719]  Or, Infowars.com forward slash Paul.
[00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:21.439]  It'll all take you there.
[00:34:21.439 --> 00:34:24.720]  In fact, the best way is Infowars.com forward slash Paul.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.921]  But a lot of them don't work well on radio.
[00:34:26.921 --> 00:34:33.443]  Some that do, we're going to be airing even after the contest here on radio slash TV.
[00:34:33.443 --> 00:34:36.564]  But film depicts foreign takeover of DHS.
[00:34:36.564 --> 00:34:44.146]  The film is posted via YouTube up on Infowars.com in the featured news area and also tweeted it out on Real Alex Jones Today.
[00:34:45.106 --> 00:34:48.307]  Uh, and this deals with a foreign takeover of DHS.
[00:34:48.307 --> 00:34:57.409]  It's been done by foreign banks of the Federal Reserve, but to illustrate it, uh, they show them using German mercenaries and parts of this that are incompatible with radio.
[00:34:57.409 --> 00:34:58.229]  I will narrate it.
[00:34:58.229 --> 00:35:01.110]  The film is Purge, and it's 17 minutes long.
[00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:04.071]  Here it is.
[00:35:04.071 --> 00:35:06.451]  Department of Homeland Security, headquarters.
[00:35:06.451 --> 00:35:09.492]  Now I'm here to tell you the time is critical.
[00:35:09.492 --> 00:35:13.773]  The Department of Homeland Security has determined that now is the time to implement an action to suppress
[00:35:14.281 --> 00:35:17.543]  The activities of right-wing extremists.
[00:35:17.543 --> 00:35:22.887]  The economic and political environment in which these extremists thrive is becoming more volatile.
[00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:25.569]  It's apparent that the world has entered into a currency crisis.
[00:35:25.569 --> 00:35:27.831]  They're in a homeland security briefing room.
[00:35:27.831 --> 00:35:30.713]  Civil unrest and armed conflict.
[00:35:30.713 --> 00:35:36.998]  Now, these are environments in which our enemies, both foreign and domestic, thrive.
[00:35:36.998 --> 00:35:39.440]  We're not going to let that happen.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.583]  It's no secret that the DHS recently purchased over 2 billion rounds of ammunition.
[00:35:44.192 --> 00:35:48.013]  We're going to continue to purchase ammunition to keep it off the open market.
[00:35:48.013 --> 00:35:51.493]  This prevents these extremists from getting ammunition in their hands.
[00:35:51.493 --> 00:35:54.914]  Additionally, we've purchased 7,000 assault weapons.
[00:35:54.914 --> 00:35:59.335]  These weapons will be issued to newly formed FEMA Youth Corps brigades.
[00:35:59.335 --> 00:36:08.037]  As we receive threat level assessments, these brigades will be deployed into combat areas using 2,700 war wagons that were specifically designed for this purpose.
[00:36:08.817 --> 00:36:11.578]  Now, in the past, extremists were easy to identify.
[00:36:11.578 --> 00:36:15.538]  They were skinheads, KKK members, radical political ideologists.
[00:36:15.538 --> 00:36:17.479]  Well, now it's becoming a little more difficult.
[00:36:17.479 --> 00:36:27.601]  This group includes anti-abortionists, pro-constitutionalists, believers in biblical end times, gun owners, and most importantly, military veterans.
[00:36:27.601 --> 00:36:31.262]  Excuse me, but military veterans are not extremists.
[00:36:31.262 --> 00:36:32.982]  Pro-constitution?
[00:36:32.982 --> 00:36:35.062]  Every American should be pro-constitution!
[00:36:35.062 --> 00:36:37.783]  I mean, the Constitution is the written law of the land!
[00:36:38.902 --> 00:36:41.185]  We've all sworn an oath to protect it.
[00:36:41.185 --> 00:36:43.728]  And believers in the end times?
[00:36:43.728 --> 00:36:45.570]  That's like every Christian in America.
[00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:49.174]  That's millions and millions of people.
[00:36:49.174 --> 00:36:50.896]  And they're good people!
[00:36:50.896 --> 00:36:54.660]  Write their IDs down.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:59.425]  We can go after them later.
[00:36:59.425 --> 00:36:59.746]  Now look.
[00:37:01.479 --> 00:37:06.000]  You may not think that these people are extremists, but we've been monitoring their activity.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.282]  We've been looking at internet traffic, cell phone use, and financial transactions.
[00:37:11.282 --> 00:37:15.083]  All this information is being sent to the Threat Fusion Center.
[00:37:15.083 --> 00:37:23.185]  The Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and other federal agencies have determined that these people pose a real threat.
[00:37:23.985 --> 00:37:31.691]  Now effective immediately, all DHS agents will be required to undergo firearms desensitivity training using these new targets.
[00:37:31.691 --> 00:37:37.155]  The elderly, children, pregnant women, gun owners... By the way, this is all real.
[00:37:37.155 --> 00:37:41.659]  Actually have these briefings to see who will be part of it.
[00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:46.383]  An additional asset that's been made available to DHS has been the use of drones.
[00:37:46.383 --> 00:37:48.784]  These drones will be outfitted for surveillance.
[00:37:48.784 --> 00:37:53.008]  But as threat levels increase and the need arises, they will be set up for military strikes.
[00:37:54.875 --> 00:37:59.899]  This is treason!
[00:37:59.899 --> 00:38:02.120]  I think we better expedite this.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:08.105]  Speaking in German does not mask your guilt, one of the feds says.
[00:38:08.105 --> 00:38:14.169]  Your attitude is not appreciated.
[00:38:14.169 --> 00:38:20.314]  Do what you do best.
[00:38:20.314 --> 00:38:24.077]  Some of us learn through schooling, others through experience.
[00:38:29.604 --> 00:38:30.625]  Is this your funeral?
[00:38:30.625 --> 00:38:33.486]  Agent Stein, thank you for your time today.
[00:38:33.486 --> 00:38:42.391]  Please continue the evaluation in the next room.
[00:38:42.391 --> 00:38:47.814]  The only difference is the Feds now just clamor to go up against the American people.
[00:38:47.814 --> 00:38:50.296]  Americans are not as weak as you'd like to believe.
[00:38:55.233 --> 00:38:58.154]  By the way, they've actually used German intelligence for Oklahoma City.
[00:38:58.154 --> 00:39:05.876]  You say that economic problems have already begun and that real wars and civil unrest would be the end result.
[00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:11.077]  Now, in the fog of war, who's to say who is violent first?
[00:39:11.077 --> 00:39:13.758]  I didn't say we're having economic problems.
[00:39:13.758 --> 00:39:14.678]  Yes, you did.
[00:39:14.678 --> 00:39:18.579]  This is exactly what they do, on purpose, to gaslight you.
[00:39:18.579 --> 00:39:21.300]  And that would lead to real wars and civil unrest.
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.700]  I didn't say that, you said that.
[00:39:23.496 --> 00:39:26.639]  You started today saying... Okay, okay.
[00:39:26.639 --> 00:39:33.064]  We all know that this is caused by the extremists hoarding gold, silver, and food.
[00:39:33.064 --> 00:39:35.646]  And it's also because of their racism.
[00:39:35.646 --> 00:39:37.507]  Especially military racism.
[00:39:37.507 --> 00:39:42.411]  Agent Walker, next room.
[00:39:42.411 --> 00:39:43.312]  What are you doing?
[00:39:43.312 --> 00:39:48.576]  Getting some real intelligence.
[00:39:48.576 --> 00:39:49.057]  Get out!
[00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:58.891]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this does get more urgent.
[00:39:58.891 --> 00:40:01.672]  Our preparations for the purge have to be expedited.
[00:40:01.672 --> 00:40:12.898]  We received a request from the Federal Reserve that the Department of Treasury, with the assistance of DHS, be authorized to confiscate all gold and silver being held in safe deposit boxes in banks throughout the country.
[00:40:12.898 --> 00:40:15.260]  By the way, they've actually done that.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:24.625]  Furthermore, in order to disable fiber tax, to alleviate a toxic derivative market, and to starve out our political adversaries,
[00:40:25.626 --> 00:40:33.892]  The federal government is prepared to heavily tax all 401ks, all savings accounts, all pensions, and all social security.
[00:40:33.892 --> 00:40:34.973]  Just like they did with the IRS.
[00:40:34.973 --> 00:40:36.594]  Especially those military veterans.
[00:40:36.594 --> 00:40:38.295]  Absolutely, they're going to ruin you.
[00:40:38.295 --> 00:40:39.196]  And the Christians.
[00:40:39.196 --> 00:40:43.899]  Now, a possible shutdown of the entire banking system may be required.
[00:40:45.845 --> 00:40:47.746]  Well, of course people are going to become violent.
[00:40:47.746 --> 00:40:49.247]  You're stealing their money!
[00:40:49.247 --> 00:40:56.192]  When my Aunt Gertrude finds out that you're going to yank her pension and cut off her Social Security, you're going to need all that ammo and all those tanks.
[00:40:56.192 --> 00:40:57.153]  That's right, Tortelli.
[00:40:57.153 --> 00:41:04.358]  How dare you do this to veterans who serve their country faithfully, only to be backstabbed by a bunch of ivory tower bureaucrats committing treason?
[00:41:04.358 --> 00:41:06.540]  Is that what you think this is, Agent Tortelli?
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.440]  Bureaucrats committing treason?
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.281]  You want to know what this is?
[00:41:08.281 --> 00:41:09.682]  I'll tell you what this is.
[00:41:09.682 --> 00:41:11.823]  The DHS has become a Gestapo.
[00:41:11.823 --> 00:41:13.625]  The Nazi SS.
[00:41:13.625 --> 00:41:15.206]  Tortelli, next room.
[00:41:26.195 --> 00:41:30.878]  Now, your mission briefs contain profiles of the extremists in your sectors.
[00:41:30.878 --> 00:41:37.722]  Know them before the next evaluation.
[00:41:37.722 --> 00:41:45.466]  That's why they're going to private contractors, because they can't even get the Feds to do what they want, and it's actually happening.
[00:41:45.466 --> 00:41:51.950]  So, one of the Homeland Security people, one of the FBI people calls one of the extremists that's on our list.
[00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:52.911]  Hello, is this Roland McMayhem?
[00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:58.270]  This is Agent Danielle Robbins of the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:05.412]  I'm concerned about an operation the DHS is conducting, and I'm wondering if I can get some more information from you.
[00:42:05.412 --> 00:42:07.633]  Why does my gut tell me that I should just hang up right now?
[00:42:07.633 --> 00:42:10.714]  I understand.
[00:42:10.714 --> 00:42:13.674]  You know, the DHS is not exactly on my favorite list.
[00:42:13.674 --> 00:42:17.436]  I understand, and I'm on your side.
[00:42:17.436 --> 00:42:18.576]  Are you?
[00:42:18.576 --> 00:42:18.936]  Prove it.
[00:42:20.544 --> 00:42:26.068]  Sir, I've received orders to investigate alleged extremist activity in my sector.
[00:42:26.068 --> 00:42:32.353]  The DHS is planning to purge certain individuals in the near future, and I believe they're doing it illegally.
[00:42:32.353 --> 00:42:40.379]  You're on the list, and I want to get down to the bottom of this before it gets any worse.
[00:42:40.379 --> 00:42:42.781]  Let me buy you a beer somewhere so we can talk more about it.
[00:42:42.781 --> 00:42:47.165]  By the way, the Army manual says they're training to put us in, quote, re-education camps.
[00:42:47.165 --> 00:42:48.145]  This is real.
[00:42:48.145 --> 00:42:49.947]  I don't think you're going to like where this is going.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.382]  I already don't like where this is.
[00:42:52.382 --> 00:42:53.202]  That's why I'm calling.
[00:42:53.202 --> 00:42:57.126]  But it's so over the top, people are following orders.
[00:42:57.126 --> 00:42:59.388]  Because they don't know how to deal with the real thing happening in America.
[00:42:59.388 --> 00:43:01.610]  I don't want to get involved.
[00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:05.053]  Rolly, I have an intel profile report on you a mile long.
[00:43:05.053 --> 00:43:09.677]  I know internet posts, phone conversations, bank transactions.
[00:43:09.677 --> 00:43:10.818]  They have you all figured out.
[00:43:10.818 --> 00:43:13.200]  And all of that's illegal under the Constitution.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:13.720]  But they do.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.142]  I want to find out if you are who they say you are.
[00:43:16.142 --> 00:43:17.504]  Folks, they're already coming after us.
[00:43:18.171 --> 00:43:23.512]  If it's not as advertised, well, Agent Danielle Robbins is going to be barking fire here at the office.
[00:43:23.512 --> 00:43:25.853]  They put poison in the water, folks.
[00:43:25.853 --> 00:43:26.913]  You're already committed.
[00:43:26.913 --> 00:43:28.614]  Alright, but when we meet, you come alone.
[00:43:28.614 --> 00:43:35.476]  Sure.
[00:43:35.476 --> 00:43:36.616]  So they made it a football field.
[00:43:36.616 --> 00:43:39.657]  Yeah, I was part of the first tank battalion.
[00:43:39.657 --> 00:43:42.077]  Abrams, who rolled into Baghdad, RAC 2003.
[00:43:42.077 --> 00:43:44.318]  We were the first boots on the ground.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:50.264]  I didn't see much action until a couple weeks later, but yeah.
[00:43:50.264 --> 00:43:53.107]  Tell me more.
[00:43:53.107 --> 00:43:56.149]  I don't think we were in Iraq for weapons of mass destruction.
[00:43:56.149 --> 00:43:59.392]  I don't think we're in Afghanistan for terror.
[00:43:59.392 --> 00:44:01.714]  I don't think we went into Libya to free the people.
[00:44:01.714 --> 00:44:07.019]  And I don't think we're in Syria now helping anybody.
[00:44:07.019 --> 00:44:10.562]  And if we get into a war with Iran, I don't think it's going to end well for America.
[00:44:14.984 --> 00:44:15.585]  That's the plan.
[00:44:15.585 --> 00:44:18.068]  Are you a Republican or a Democrat?
[00:44:18.068 --> 00:44:23.214]  And who did you vote for in the last election, if you don't mind me asking?
[00:44:23.214 --> 00:44:24.536]  Neither.
[00:44:24.536 --> 00:44:29.122]  I will not vote for the lesser of two evils and I will not be part of their system.
[00:44:29.122 --> 00:44:29.783]  Whose system?
[00:44:30.831 --> 00:44:33.293]  The Federal Reserve System.
[00:44:33.293 --> 00:44:38.036]  The Federal Reserve is a private company who has the power to issue our own currency.
[00:44:38.036 --> 00:44:40.178]  They're the real power brokers.
[00:44:40.178 --> 00:44:41.479]  The real shadow government.
[00:44:41.479 --> 00:44:42.219]  And they want you bankrupt.
[00:44:42.219 --> 00:44:44.641]  Congress and President can't even question them.
[00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:47.884]  The politicians are just puppets in this game.
[00:44:47.884 --> 00:44:52.367]  The politicians give us the illusion as if we're free.
[00:44:52.367 --> 00:44:53.508]  And now they're going to get rid of even that.
[00:44:55.250 --> 00:45:03.594]  The Federal Reserve is printing 85 billion dollars a month through quantitative easing and giving it to themselves.
[00:45:03.594 --> 00:45:04.975]  It is total counterfeit.
[00:45:04.975 --> 00:45:08.857]  I mean, look at the Boston bombing.
[00:45:08.857 --> 00:45:13.599]  Look at that happen on the same day that the gold and silver market crashed.
[00:45:13.599 --> 00:45:20.182]  And all the big banks swooped in to grab all the money while everyone was busy watching the news of the bombing.
[00:45:20.182 --> 00:45:23.144]  They swooped in and bought gold and silver by the ton.
[00:45:25.663 --> 00:45:32.024]  And the reason that they want me purged is because I don't buy their lies.
[00:45:32.024 --> 00:45:32.744]  That's right, folks.
[00:45:32.744 --> 00:45:37.185]  They're going to start with the leaders first, and they're going to move down to you.
[00:45:37.185 --> 00:45:38.525]  So is that their plan?
[00:45:38.525 --> 00:45:39.966]  To get all the money?
[00:45:39.966 --> 00:45:40.286]  No.
[00:45:40.286 --> 00:45:41.786]  They already have money.
[00:45:41.786 --> 00:45:43.006]  They want control.
[00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:43.486]  That's right.
[00:45:43.486 --> 00:45:50.148]  They want to bring about a new one-world government, a one-world currency, and a one-world religion.
[00:45:50.148 --> 00:45:51.988]  They want to control everything.
[00:45:55.196 --> 00:45:58.539]  They're coming for everybody, folks.
[00:45:58.539 --> 00:46:01.541]  You're lying to yourself if you don't admit that.
[00:46:01.541 --> 00:46:03.923]  None of you that work for this are part of the winners.
[00:46:03.923 --> 00:46:05.464]  Can you play this all out for me?
[00:46:05.464 --> 00:46:08.886]  Just play it all out.
[00:46:08.886 --> 00:46:12.389]  It's gonna start with a bank holiday.
[00:46:12.389 --> 00:46:14.030]  That's where they shut down all the banks.
[00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:15.832]  It's gonna come like on a Friday afternoon.
[00:46:16.988 --> 00:46:26.836]  They're going to say that there's some cyber attack and then they'll reopen the banks after they've dealt with the cyber attack on Monday morning.
[00:46:26.836 --> 00:46:37.825]  In the meantime, martial law will begin and they'll start purging all veterans, all gun owners, all Christians or anyone that they see as a threat.
[00:46:37.825 --> 00:46:40.767]  The civil war is going to be bloody.
[00:46:40.767 --> 00:46:42.869]  They'll bring out the DHS, they'll bring out the
[00:46:43.581 --> 00:46:49.007]  FEMA youth soldiers and then they're going to bring in foreign troops to help you.
[00:46:49.007 --> 00:46:53.312]  However, I doubt that they have briefed you that these foreign troops are going to turn on you.
[00:46:54.943 --> 00:46:56.865]  And then it's going to get real bloody.
[00:46:56.865 --> 00:47:00.407]  And in the end, the foreign troops is going to try to plunder the entire country.
[00:47:00.407 --> 00:47:03.870]  They've already been promised whatever they can plunder, they can have.
[00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:09.295]  Now what they don't know is that the ruling elite are going to use robots to turn on them.
[00:47:09.295 --> 00:47:11.797]  And then when they're all dead, the ruling elite get it all.
[00:47:11.797 --> 00:47:19.923]  And anyone left is subject to the new world order.
[00:47:19.923 --> 00:47:20.384]  God.
[00:47:20.384 --> 00:47:23.026]  Yeah, we're going to need them.
[00:47:25.123 --> 00:47:28.924]  Is there any hope?
[00:47:28.924 --> 00:47:33.065]  If there is any hope, the American people have got to wake up.
[00:47:33.065 --> 00:47:38.586]  And the current police and military have got to stand down when they're given the order to fire upon Americans.
[00:47:38.586 --> 00:47:46.328]  Then they gotta join the counter-revolution, us, who wants to return the United States of America back to a constitutional republic.
[00:47:46.328 --> 00:47:52.870]  And then together we can fight the technocratic tyranny.
[00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:53.990]  They're still good people.
[00:47:59.505 --> 00:48:05.847]  We're going to need them.
[00:48:05.847 --> 00:48:11.789]  In a press statement from the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, all banking activity will cease at 5 p.m.
[00:48:11.789 --> 00:48:14.110]  Eastern Time Friday afternoon.
[00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:16.831]  All banks will be closed throughout the weekend.
[00:48:16.831 --> 00:48:22.773]  ATMs will be shut down, and all online financial transactions will be suspended.
[00:48:22.773 --> 00:48:27.694]  According to the Federal Reserve press statement, normal banking will resume at 8 a.m.
[00:48:27.694 --> 00:48:29.095]  Eastern Time Monday morning.
[00:48:29.548 --> 00:48:45.583]  In other news, at the military bases across the nation, troops are conducting emergency deployment readiness exercises in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security and the other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.
[00:48:45.583 --> 00:48:49.487]  Today, the National Council of Churches has made an urgent plea with all Christians
[00:48:49.941 --> 00:48:55.023]  Observe the scriptures and obey the federal government's order to turn in all firearms by Monday.
[00:48:55.023 --> 00:49:03.206]  It is the civic duty of all Christians to be an example to the nation as peaceful obedient citizens who quickly become part of the solution and do not cling to the problem.
[00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:08.507]  This is the most disturbing weekend I have ever experienced in this country.
[00:49:08.507 --> 00:49:10.268]  Let's go to the phones.
[00:49:10.268 --> 00:49:12.029]  Larry, you're on the air.
[00:49:12.029 --> 00:49:12.809]  Jack!
[00:49:12.809 --> 00:49:13.729]  Jack!
[00:49:13.729 --> 00:49:15.490]  Our pastor sold us out!
[00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:15.690]  What?
[00:49:17.594 --> 00:49:18.235]  We're good to go.
[00:49:31.004 --> 00:49:50.079]  The DHS has been put on high alert in anticipation of imminent terrorist attacks from veterans and is urgently requesting information of sightings of any suspicious activity such as stockpiling or transporting en masse food, water, guns, ammunition, fuel, or any indication of home fortification.
[00:49:50.579 --> 00:49:55.162]  Again, if you see something suspicious, please contact the DHS immediately.
[00:49:55.162 --> 00:49:56.923]  A cash reward may be given.
[00:49:56.923 --> 00:49:59.184]  They're bringing down the hammer hard, folks.
[00:49:59.184 --> 00:50:01.785]  You must keep vigilant.
[00:50:01.785 --> 00:50:03.586]  Let's get back to the phones.
[00:50:03.586 --> 00:50:06.067]  Jody from Texas, you're on the air.
[00:50:06.067 --> 00:50:07.108]  Yeah, good, Tony.
[00:50:07.108 --> 00:50:08.549]  I'm telling you, this is it.
[00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:10.350]  Yeah, I saw some people.
[00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:12.691]  It's pulling right out of their houses.
[00:50:12.691 --> 00:50:13.731]  They're showing no mercy.
[00:50:13.731 --> 00:50:14.272]  This is it.
[00:50:14.272 --> 00:50:15.833]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:50:18.208 --> 00:50:21.731]  You can see the final minutes of the film up on Infowars.com.
[00:50:21.731 --> 00:50:24.034]  It's in the featured news area.
[00:50:24.034 --> 00:50:29.439]  Film depicts foreign takeover of DHS and what ends up happening.
[00:50:29.439 --> 00:50:36.706]  I believe this is further out in the future for a hot purge, but they are moving towards that and admitting that's the plan.
[00:50:36.706 --> 00:50:37.587]  It's totally illegal.
[00:50:38.547 --> 00:50:41.329]  We have hundreds of admitted crimes from the top.
[00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:42.730]  They should all be in jail.
[00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:44.191]  They're going for broke.
[00:50:44.191 --> 00:50:50.035]  And I've got announcements concerning the Operation Paul Revere film contest on the other side.
[00:50:50.035 --> 00:50:56.959]  But go to InfoWars.com forward slash Paul to see the top 35 finalists.
[00:50:56.959 --> 00:50:59.421]  We've got a lot of news on Obamacare, you name it, coming up as well.
[00:51:01.926 --> 00:51:03.526]  Time and time again.
[00:51:03.526 --> 00:51:06.467]  You need to come here and help us.
[00:51:06.467 --> 00:51:07.907]  We need assistance.
[00:51:07.907 --> 00:51:08.727]  Please!
[00:51:08.727 --> 00:51:12.308]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:51:12.308 --> 00:51:16.009]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way.
[00:51:16.009 --> 00:51:18.690]  While the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:21.230]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:46.154]  Detecting, measuring, and monitoring nuclear radiation.

[00:53:56.599 --> 00:53:58.039]  Spelled M-A-Z-U-R.
[00:53:58.039 --> 00:53:59.100]  Instruments dot com.
[00:54:03.837 --> 00:54:06.839]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:54:06.839 --> 00:54:10.021]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.021 --> 00:54:13.864]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:13.864 --> 00:54:18.607]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:54:18.607 --> 00:54:25.812]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire, the ring of fire.
[00:54:25.812 --> 00:54:29.614]  The taste of love is sweet, folks, when hearts like ours meet.
[00:54:29.614 --> 00:54:30.775]  Alright, here's the announcement.
[00:54:32.676 --> 00:54:34.557]  We've had over 600 entries.
[00:54:34.557 --> 00:54:35.498]  All of them are pretty good.
[00:54:35.498 --> 00:54:39.740]  300 or so were put up in the first group of finalists.
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:43.242]  Now it's down to 35.
[00:54:43.242 --> 00:54:47.345]  And you can find out at InfoWars.com forward slash poll.
[00:54:47.345 --> 00:54:48.425]  Or you can link through.
[00:54:48.425 --> 00:54:59.372]  Every day we're posting five, six, seven different finalists up on the front page of InfoWars.com, like Purge that you just saw and listened to part of, depending on how you're watching or listening.
[00:55:00.496 --> 00:55:07.041]  And it has been really, really rough trying to decide who's the best here.
[00:55:07.041 --> 00:55:17.567]  I tell you, it's amazing viewing at home at night, sitting there with an iPad until one in the morning watching these and trying to figure out what the finalists were and now who's going to win.
[00:55:17.567 --> 00:55:19.849]  I still don't know.
[00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:27.014]  And we're supposed to have, I'm supposed to know by, I'm supposed to decide like today or tomorrow, so I can say Thursday who third place is.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.802]  And then Friday, who second place is.
[00:55:30.802 --> 00:55:35.206]  And then Monday, so I can say who first place is.
[00:55:35.206 --> 00:55:39.510]  And I've just got to give myself the weekend to really properly judge this.
[00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:40.851]  And I also want to go back.
[00:55:40.851 --> 00:55:42.993]  I say these are the top 35 finalists.
[00:55:42.993 --> 00:55:47.818]  I want to go back through a bunch of the others, because this is just what we did trying to meet this deadline.
[00:55:47.818 --> 00:55:49.660]  I'm going to go back to and look at some of the others.
[00:55:51.255 --> 00:55:59.464]  Uh, and think if I've missed any of those to kind of put unofficially, you know, in the 35 finalists, because I'm the main judge, I can decide whatever I want.
[00:55:59.464 --> 00:56:04.490]  And then I'll decide by Sunday who the winners are.
[00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:06.512]  And Monday, I'll tell you, again, third place.
[00:56:06.512 --> 00:56:08.695]  Tuesday, second place.
[00:56:08.695 --> 00:56:10.997]  And Wednesday, first place.
[00:56:11.983 --> 00:56:14.647]  So, the contest will be done by the end of July.
[00:56:14.647 --> 00:56:15.989]  By next Wednesday.
[00:56:15.989 --> 00:56:23.200]  And this also gives us more time to promote all these great films and the great people that came together and everyone's a winner because you made a documentary.
[00:56:24.295 --> 00:56:32.298]  And there's well over 600 of them, and everybody, whether it was a slideshow or a voiceover, it didn't matter.
[00:56:32.298 --> 00:56:34.378]  You took action, that's winning.
[00:56:34.378 --> 00:56:36.199]  Resistance is victory.
[00:56:36.199 --> 00:56:38.680]  And there's already millions of views of these films.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:42.441]  One of the films I saw has like 500,000 views, it's climbing.
[00:56:42.441 --> 00:56:45.462]  Another had 500 plus thousand, and then Michael Moore had it taken down.
[00:56:45.462 --> 00:56:50.644]  A Paul Revere based one, for no reason, it's incredible, it was a comedy video.
[00:56:51.484 --> 00:56:52.405]  Uh, there's been a bunch of others.
[00:56:52.405 --> 00:56:59.592]  I mean, all total, I think there's like three, four million views so far, and these will just grow forever.
[00:56:59.592 --> 00:57:01.673]  Uh, so, $115,000 in prizes.
[00:57:01.673 --> 00:57:06.398]  We take all the money that comes in from books, videos, t-shirts, ProPures, advertising.
[00:57:08.055 --> 00:57:11.017]  I don't know of any other media person who's spending everything that comes in.
[00:57:11.017 --> 00:57:11.757]  I'm proud of that.
[00:57:11.757 --> 00:57:18.380]  It's not bad if I made money for myself and I've got a decent house and some cars and a little bit of money in the bank.
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:19.701]  I'm spending that now.
[00:57:19.701 --> 00:57:23.343]  If I have to, down the road, I'd sell my house and move into an apartment.
[00:57:23.723 --> 00:57:24.764]  You know, to keep funding this.
[00:57:24.764 --> 00:57:27.965]  I'm 100% going all out against the globalists.
[00:57:27.965 --> 00:57:35.989]  So infowarestore.com if you want to support us and get the new film State of Mind, The Psychology of Control on Blu-ray or DVD.
[00:57:35.989 --> 00:57:38.931]  Yeah, we put it out for free on YouTube after it premiered on Nightly News.
[00:57:39.551 --> 00:57:40.251]  Yeah, great.

[00:59:00.285 --> 00:59:06.672]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:59:07.072 --> 00:59:09.374]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.

[00:59:53.479 --> 00:59:55.860]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:58.661]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:10.030]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:11.612]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.612 --> 01:00:13.154]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.154 --> 01:00:17.338]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.338 --> 01:00:21.402]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.059 --> 01:00:26.861]  You know, I do this sometimes.
[01:00:26.861 --> 01:00:28.463]  I look at the guest sheet and I'm wrong.
[01:00:28.463 --> 01:00:42.373]  Quanell X, one of the head Black Panther Party, new Black Panther Party people, who was down there on the armed march in Houston, where they had Democratic operatives out there with racist signs to try to create division and distractions.
[01:00:42.373 --> 01:00:43.975]  He's going to be joining us in the next hour.
[01:00:45.811 --> 01:00:51.674]  So that is going to be coming up in the third hour today.
[01:00:51.674 --> 01:01:03.880]  We are going to be taking your calls in the shower, open phones, first-time callers yet again on all the news already covered in the last hour and the news that's coming up in this hour.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.062]  But we're also going to be getting into the Muslim Brotherhood and others.
[01:01:07.882 --> 01:01:15.228]  Blowing up and burning down and mass murdering Christians as usual and how that ties in to Homeland Security and their fake war on terror.
[01:01:15.228 --> 01:01:17.630]  It's really a war on our liberties.
[01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:22.353]  We're going to get into the latest developments with Fukushima.
[01:01:22.353 --> 01:01:27.537]  TEPCO admits Fukushima 1 reactor is still leaking radioactive water into the Pacific.
[01:01:27.537 --> 01:01:28.298]  Guess where that comes?
[01:01:28.298 --> 01:01:30.320]  Right over here.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:35.524]  But when the federal government discovers the tuna are filled with radiation, their answer is just keep feeding it to us.
[01:01:36.622 --> 01:01:46.092]  And we're also going to be getting into a host of other articles that are up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:46.092 --> 01:01:59.085]  And first off, when we come back in the next segment, I am going to get into the Obamacare showdown being reported by the Hill newspaper and really what Obamacare signifies
[01:02:00.544 --> 01:02:01.786]  And what that means.
[01:02:01.786 --> 01:02:05.390]  And the 1,200 days left with Obama in office.
[01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:09.976]  And Obama saying Trayvon looks like the sun, and now Trayvon looks like him.
[01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:12.779]  If you didn't hear that a few days ago.
[01:02:12.779 --> 01:02:14.862]  Literally trying to now make himself the victim.
[01:02:14.862 --> 01:02:15.943]  So they make Trayvon a victim.
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.942]  Which clearly, at some level, was a victim, and we're sad for him and his family.
[01:02:19.942 --> 01:02:24.925]  And then they transfer that manipulation onto Obama.
[01:02:24.925 --> 01:02:26.606]  And this is just basic mind control.
[01:02:26.606 --> 01:02:28.468]  In fact, everybody's been playing that for days.
[01:02:28.468 --> 01:02:29.328]  We haven't played that yet.
[01:02:29.328 --> 01:02:35.692]  Can you guys get me the Obama clip where he says, I could have been Trayvon.
[01:02:35.692 --> 01:02:39.815]  And then we clip it together with, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.
[01:02:39.815 --> 01:02:41.716]  I want to play that, just so people can hear that again.
[01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:42.897]  A president
[01:02:44.548 --> 01:02:48.059]  I mean, I tune into MSNBC now, and it is like a hallucination.
[01:02:48.894 --> 01:02:51.615]  The race baiting, the division, the lying.
[01:02:51.615 --> 01:02:53.216]  Everyone wants to turn their guns in.
[01:02:53.216 --> 01:02:54.836]  Everyone wants open borders.
[01:02:54.836 --> 01:02:56.417]  Everyone knows America's racist.
[01:02:56.417 --> 01:02:58.218]  Everyone knows white people are bad.
[01:02:58.218 --> 01:02:59.898]  Everyone knows Obama loves us.
[01:02:59.898 --> 01:03:03.780]  I mean, it's like, everyone knows we love taking cyanide.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.401]  Everyone knows we love being thrown into meat grinders.
[01:03:06.401 --> 01:03:08.622]  Everyone knows we love being fed to sharks.
[01:03:08.622 --> 01:03:13.143]  Everyone, everyone, everyone loves checkpoints on the highway.
[01:03:13.143 --> 01:03:15.424]  Everyone loves the government funding Al Qaeda.
[01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:16.885]  Everyone loves, yeah, Congress has a
[01:03:17.465 --> 01:03:18.725]  10% approval rating.
[01:03:18.725 --> 01:03:21.486]  Some polls are 9%, some are 15%.
[01:03:21.486 --> 01:03:25.848]  Obama's plunging in the polls, but everyone loves him!
[01:03:25.848 --> 01:03:30.669]  Everybody knows that the moon's made of cheese.
[01:03:30.669 --> 01:03:34.250]  Everybody knows that Bill Clinton did not have sex with that woman.
[01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:38.291]  Look how happy Bill Clinton looks.
[01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:41.632]  Big sellout to the New World Order, looks like a zombie.
[01:03:41.632 --> 01:03:42.993]  Look at all these New World Order people.
[01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:58.871]  Schmidt, the head of Google, who has dozens of girlfriends and basically has jumbo jets, they admit, with flying harems on them in his open marriage and is reportedly into all sorts of weird stuff.
[01:03:58.871 --> 01:04:02.392]  But he says you don't have any privacy, but he's obsessed with his.
[01:04:02.392 --> 01:04:03.532]  I saw this article in Daily Mail.
[01:04:03.532 --> 01:04:04.833]  Will you guys print that again for me?
[01:04:04.833 --> 01:04:05.993]  Or we'll show it.
[01:04:05.993 --> 01:04:10.255]  Where his girlfriends, when he's out with them, they wear veils.
[01:04:10.255 --> 01:04:12.856]  So he's obsessed with privacy, but he wants to know
[01:04:15.063 --> 01:04:36.061]  What you've got growing on your tally walker, I mean, I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but I mean, this is, this is unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen, that this guy wants to know if you have breast implants, this guy wants to know where you go eat, what you do, so he can predict the future and run your life and sell the data to big corporations to game you and your family.

[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:44.602]  How these high-end stores have face-scanning cameras in them to, to, to game.
[01:04:44.602 --> 01:04:47.142]  Yeah, scroll down to his girlfriend covering her faces.
[01:04:47.142 --> 01:04:50.143]  To, to, to game.
[01:04:50.143 --> 01:04:51.803]  The name of the game is gaming.
[01:04:51.803 --> 01:04:53.204]  Oh, they know you'll buy something?
[01:04:53.204 --> 01:04:54.444]  They know you'll be ripped off?
[01:04:54.444 --> 01:04:55.344]  They know you'll pay more?
[01:04:55.344 --> 01:04:56.044]  They know!

[01:08:48.506 --> 01:08:50.128]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:08:50.128 --> 01:08:51.429]  We're not left or right.
[01:08:51.429 --> 01:08:53.671]  We're about doing the right thing.
[01:08:53.671 --> 01:09:02.198]  I am a constitutional libertarian, and I know that we have a private, corporate, global government forming that has made itself above the law.
[01:09:02.198 --> 01:09:05.460]  The new royalty with diplomatic immunity.
[01:09:06.201 --> 01:09:12.405]  And they are engaged in a scorched earth, ruthless process of establishing a planetary corporate government.
[01:09:12.405 --> 01:09:14.887]  I am here to resist that and try to wake folks up.
[01:09:14.887 --> 01:09:15.867]  First time callers, 800-259-9231.
[01:09:21.127 --> 01:09:33.451]  Okay, let me just recap the situation, and I'm going to get to some new news on Obamacare and then your phone calls, and then the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda just slaughtering Christians all over the Middle East under U.S.
[01:09:33.451 --> 01:09:34.192]  government funding.
[01:09:34.192 --> 01:09:41.054]  I mean, our government is absolutely over-the-top evil, and they know they can get away with it because it's so over-the-top.
[01:09:42.677 --> 01:09:45.318]  And overnight, they're like, it's not for Al Qaeda now.
[01:09:45.318 --> 01:09:47.019]  You're all the terrorists.
[01:09:47.019 --> 01:09:48.900]  Conservative libertarian veterans.
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.801]  You're gonna attack any minute now.
[01:09:50.801 --> 01:09:53.362]  When you do, we're gonna put you in re-education centers.
[01:09:53.362 --> 01:09:54.423]  The army's training.
[01:09:54.423 --> 01:09:55.583]  But that's no big deal.
[01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:58.545]  I mean, it's just beyond insanely evil.
[01:10:00.899 --> 01:10:15.854]  But it's so over the top, you're like, I can't even compute our government publicly runs Al-Qaeda and publicly is trying to take our guns and publicly buying thousands of armored vehicles and billions of rounds of ammo and ordering posters of kids to shoot them called no more hesitation.
[01:10:15.854 --> 01:10:19.097]  I mean, it's just it's all Twilight Zone.
[01:10:20.222 --> 01:10:22.645]  And then they have the media, you know, up there lying about me.
[01:10:22.645 --> 01:10:28.191]  Well, there's no bullets, there's no armored vehicles, there's no FEMA camp plan, even though it's all on record.
[01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:31.895]  Alex Jones believes giant wasps live under the UN building.
[01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:34.938]  I never said anything like that.
[01:10:34.938 --> 01:10:37.581]  Alex Jones says Obama runs every tornado.
[01:10:37.581 --> 01:10:39.383]  Never said that.
[01:10:39.383 --> 01:10:40.905]  Alex Jones is racist.
[01:10:40.905 --> 01:10:41.646]  Never said that.
[01:10:43.314 --> 01:10:44.675]  And now they've caught the Democrats.
[01:10:44.675 --> 01:10:46.677]  This is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:10:46.677 --> 01:10:50.520]  We've given some of the history of it as well.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:56.225]  Having people with signs saying we're racist and chanting that they're racist.
[01:10:56.225 --> 01:11:01.790]  And this is the same thing that we've seen over and over and over again.
[01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:05.353]  So we're going to be getting to more of that after I take your phone calls.
[01:11:05.353 --> 01:11:06.394]  But here it is, Representative
[01:11:06.954 --> 01:11:23.642]  Luis Gutierrez calls for House hearings on Trayvon Martin and gun control and I heard him and other congressmen this morning on MSNBC saying we've got to pass gun control and we've got to get rid of concealed carry federally for Trayvon.
[01:11:23.642 --> 01:11:25.063]  Now how about for the
[01:11:27.279 --> 01:11:28.881]  A globalist mafia.
[01:11:28.881 --> 01:11:29.941]  That's why they want our guns.
[01:11:29.941 --> 01:11:30.922]  Government arming of the teeth.
[01:11:30.922 --> 01:11:31.683]  They want our guns.
[01:11:31.683 --> 01:11:33.585]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:11:33.585 --> 01:11:34.145]  NRA.
[01:11:34.145 --> 01:11:36.988]  Holder exploiting Trayvon Martin death to push gun control.
[01:11:36.988 --> 01:11:38.629]  The Hill.
[01:11:38.629 --> 01:11:40.371]  NRA blast Holder for pushing gun control.
[01:11:42.071 --> 01:11:43.732]  on Trayvon Martin's back.
[01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:49.794]  Pelosi, Congress must uphold oath to protect and defend the Constitution by passing gun control.
[01:11:49.794 --> 01:11:54.636]  By the way, Pelosi has government paid for bodyguards with guns and she has guns.
[01:11:54.636 --> 01:11:56.656]  But you ain't gonna gab them.
[01:11:56.656 --> 01:11:58.157]  You understand that slave?
[01:11:58.157 --> 01:12:02.499]  That witch runs your life, bow to her and all the rest of them.
[01:12:02.499 --> 01:12:08.201]  So that's just some of the news on that front here today.
[01:12:08.201 --> 01:12:10.762]  Now let's get to the Obamacare.
[01:12:11.767 --> 01:12:13.329]  Obama give me free!
[01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:16.251]  Obama!
[01:12:16.251 --> 01:12:18.353]  I want free house!
[01:12:18.353 --> 01:12:20.675]  You said Obamacare!
[01:12:20.675 --> 01:12:24.019]  Not raise taxes on anyone!
[01:12:24.019 --> 01:12:27.442]  But it raises them on anyone working!
[01:12:27.442 --> 01:12:28.843]  Even people being paid $18,000 a year!
[01:12:32.066 --> 01:12:33.206]  Obama!
[01:12:33.206 --> 01:12:34.327]  Obama!
[01:12:34.327 --> 01:12:37.588]  Obama!
[01:12:37.588 --> 01:12:38.668]  That hurts!
[01:12:38.668 --> 01:12:41.049]  That hurts me!
[01:12:41.049 --> 01:12:44.890]  You look like a wolf, but you say you love me!
[01:12:44.890 --> 01:12:46.471]  Obama!
[01:12:46.471 --> 01:12:51.493]  Obama!
[01:12:51.493 --> 01:12:53.813]  Then we can find a sound of sheep being killed.
[01:12:53.813 --> 01:12:57.355]  They have varmint tapes online that you play to bring in wolves and coyotes.
[01:12:57.355 --> 01:13:00.216]  Can we get the sound of dying sheep?
[01:13:00.216 --> 01:13:01.076]  Sounds like a person.
[01:13:01.716 --> 01:13:02.656]  Because that's you!
[01:13:02.656 --> 01:13:06.278]  And you're like, I don't like Republicans!
[01:13:06.278 --> 01:13:07.538]  How about a fake choice?
[01:13:07.538 --> 01:13:10.279]  You walk on a car lot and the guy's like, how are you doing?
[01:13:10.279 --> 01:13:11.200]  Good to have you here.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.721]  I got all these beauties.
[01:13:13.721 --> 01:13:16.982]  1976 Gremlin, perfect condition, no miles.
[01:13:16.982 --> 01:13:18.922]  I've got other vehicles now.
[01:13:18.922 --> 01:13:22.604]  It's not like this vehicle was in a river and we drained it out and covered that up.
[01:13:24.577 --> 01:13:26.158]  We got a really good deal for you.
[01:13:26.158 --> 01:13:32.501]  We got two choices here on the lot for you, and you're going to buy one of them today.
[01:13:32.501 --> 01:13:34.962]  And then they lean in to intimidate you to buy it.
[01:13:34.962 --> 01:13:35.642]  I say, I'm leaving.
[01:13:35.642 --> 01:13:37.183]  I'm not buying this.
[01:13:37.183 --> 01:13:46.087]  See, that confidence game where the country primed for mass Stockholm syndrome, and if somebody's wearing a uniform, everybody wears uniforms now.
[01:13:46.087 --> 01:13:47.107]  Everyone bows down.
[01:13:47.107 --> 01:13:49.208]  Oh my gosh, you're in a janitor outfit.
[01:13:49.208 --> 01:13:49.909]  I better kneel.
[01:13:51.150 --> 01:13:56.355]  I think I could dress up in a janitor outfit if it had some flags on it and walk up and say, hello, sir, give me your wife.
[01:13:56.355 --> 01:13:59.598]  And the wife would probably say, absolutely, you are my master.
[01:13:59.598 --> 01:14:02.681]  Because everybody's watched, you know, I Dream of Jeannie.
[01:14:02.681 --> 01:14:12.371]  I mean, I guess they've been programmed like that to sit there and do anything they're told, because that's what the sheep do.
[01:14:12.691 --> 01:14:15.092]  No!
[01:14:15.092 --> 01:14:17.032]  I like my vaccines!
[01:14:17.032 --> 01:14:24.735]  Really, the Gardasil shots in their own trials killed a large percentage of people that took it, and injured thousands, and all these governments have banned it.
[01:14:24.735 --> 01:14:27.375]  India, Japan, and it just keeps killing people.
[01:14:27.375 --> 01:14:28.236]  It doesn't even protect you.
[01:14:28.236 --> 01:14:32.517]  The insert says, doesn't protect you from the thousands of strains of papilloma.
[01:14:32.517 --> 01:14:35.418]  It's a total hoax, and Rick Perry's saying it's a law to take it.
[01:14:35.418 --> 01:14:36.438]  It's a total hoax.
[01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:37.959]  This is a eugenics operation.
[01:14:37.959 --> 01:14:39.579]  It's been connected to infertility.
[01:14:39.579 --> 01:14:39.839]  Please!
[01:14:43.921 --> 01:14:48.824]  Like that scary man, Obama looks like Trayvon.
[01:14:48.824 --> 01:14:51.326]  Obama could be Trayvon.
[01:14:51.326 --> 01:14:59.271]  He's a victim of white racists, racists, racists.
[01:14:59.271 --> 01:15:00.432]  Hey, the government's a wolf.
[01:15:00.432 --> 01:15:01.113]  It's taking your rights.
[01:15:01.113 --> 01:15:02.133]  It's run by foreign banks.
[01:15:02.133 --> 01:15:04.275]  That's what the racists say.
[01:15:05.478 --> 01:15:06.018]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:15:06.018 --> 01:15:06.979]  I'm going crazy here.
[01:15:06.979 --> 01:15:08.660]  Let's go to our leader.
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:11.462]  First, Trayvon looked like his son and personalized it.
[01:15:11.462 --> 01:15:13.203]  Justice Department running the whole operation.
[01:15:13.203 --> 01:15:17.927]  Now, now, now, he is Trayvon.
[01:15:17.927 --> 01:15:28.014]  How dare the white people of America do this to our savior, our royalty, the man who stands above Joe Biden.
[01:15:28.014 --> 01:15:30.355]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[01:15:30.355 --> 01:15:33.578]  You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.
[01:15:33.578 --> 01:15:33.718]  And
[01:15:35.738 --> 01:15:44.146]  When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son.
[01:15:44.146 --> 01:15:52.334]  Another way of saying that is, Trayvon Martin could have been me, 35 years ago.
[01:15:52.334 --> 01:15:56.818]  And when you think about why, in the African American community at least,
[01:15:58.936 --> 01:16:01.878]  There's a lot of pain around what happened here.
[01:16:01.878 --> 01:16:09.703]  I think it's important to recognize that... We're here to put salt in the wounds as much as possible, to distract you from the foreign banks I work for, raping everybody!
[01:16:09.703 --> 01:16:14.967]  The American people are looking at this issue through a set of experiences.
[01:16:14.967 --> 01:16:16.268]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:16:16.268 --> 01:16:20.871]  Yeah, he goes on to say, I'm used to when I walk through a parking lot, people lock the doors.
[01:16:20.871 --> 01:16:25.374]  Yeah, when I get in my car, and then I turn it on and I'm in a parking lot, I lock the door.
[01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:34.975]  And, you know, I'm a man, and I've been walking through parking lots and seeing women kind of look at you and got their purse, because people are living in fear.
[01:16:34.975 --> 01:16:36.456]  I'm a white guy.
[01:16:36.456 --> 01:16:41.460]  And I'm sure there are some people out there that stereotype and think black guys about rape, you know, rape them or do something.
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:54.450]  My whole issue is, if I see guys with wife beaters, with like devil tats, and they're bugging their eyes out at me, and, you know, they're white, they're Hispanic, they're black, whatever, I start kind of paying attention to them.
[01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:56.551]  But absolutely!
[01:16:56.551 --> 01:17:08.935]  You know, if I'm in an, you know, especially in a poor area, and I see guys walking like they're thugs down the street, I don't care what color they are, I go, that guy looks like they're a thug, and looks like they're tough, okay.
[01:17:08.935 --> 01:17:15.838]  If they try to shake me down, I'm just going to say, I'm going to ignore them and keep walking, and if they come up to me and try to put a hand on me, I'm going to punch them right in the throat.
[01:17:17.159 --> 01:17:20.680]  Because I don't want to jump on top of them and hurt my knees and stuff when I slam their head in the ground.
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.001]  Plus, I don't want to kill them.
[01:17:22.001 --> 01:17:26.822]  Because then I have to go to jail and stuff and then I have to find that I didn't, you know, that it was done in self-defense.
[01:17:26.822 --> 01:17:28.403]  Been down that road.
[01:17:28.403 --> 01:17:32.524]  So, I'm sitting there and I'm thinking, alright, I'm going to punch this guy in the throat.
[01:17:32.524 --> 01:17:34.505]  I'm thinking, how hard am I going to punch him?
[01:17:34.505 --> 01:17:36.386]  And I'm not thinking he's a black guy.
[01:17:36.386 --> 01:17:41.547]  I'm thinking the guy's walking like a thug, thinks they're tough, and I'm thinking about how I'm going to defend myself.
[01:17:41.547 --> 01:17:42.448]  Just like when I've been
[01:17:43.641 --> 01:17:50.469]  at the coast a few years ago and walk out of a restaurant in South Padre and they're having a biker rally.
[01:17:50.469 --> 01:17:51.731]  It wasn't like a nice biker rally.
[01:17:51.731 --> 01:17:53.272]  Most rallies are nice people.
[01:17:53.272 --> 01:17:57.117]  It was like thug wannabes rode up with a motorcycle and were revving and looking at me.
[01:17:57.117 --> 01:17:58.418]  And I was thinking, okay,
[01:17:59.542 --> 01:18:01.044]  Alright, that guy's taking his helmet off.
[01:18:01.044 --> 01:18:04.690]  I'm going to punch him in the throat the minute he tries to get up and do something.
[01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:07.273]  And then I'm going to assault those next three guys.
[01:18:07.273 --> 01:18:08.435]  Then they'll probably pull a weapon.
[01:18:08.435 --> 01:18:09.537]  I need to take that.
[01:18:09.537 --> 01:18:13.843]  I mean, that's, that's, I mean, like, that's what I'm thinking whenever something like that's going on.
[01:18:13.843 --> 01:18:14.323]  I can't help it.
[01:18:14.784 --> 01:18:16.484]  I'm thinking, all right, I'm ready to kill.
[01:18:16.484 --> 01:18:18.705]  I mean, that's just how I am.
[01:18:18.705 --> 01:18:22.206]  And I'm thinking, all right, all right, okay, instantly assess these guys.
[01:18:22.206 --> 01:18:24.466]  These are probably ex-con, real criminals.
[01:18:24.466 --> 01:18:26.307]  I've got my three kids here.
[01:18:26.307 --> 01:18:29.327]  That gives me, you know, just turbo dinosaur power.
[01:18:29.327 --> 01:18:32.708]  And I'm thinking, control yourself, don't have a fight unless you've absolutely got to.
[01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:36.369]  You know, the man in me is ready to take them all on and toss them!
[01:18:37.409 --> 01:18:40.473]  You know what I'm talking about out there, don't ya?
[01:18:40.473 --> 01:18:41.654]  You scum!
[01:18:41.654 --> 01:18:43.697]  I hate gang members in filth!
[01:18:43.697 --> 01:18:46.880]  And it has nothing to do with black people!
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:51.606]  But I will stomp your head in if you start a fight with me, you thug scum!
[01:18:51.606 --> 01:18:52.968]  Anyways, excuse me ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:55.888 --> 01:19:03.795]  The point here is that they are simply trying to invoke a racial division here, and that's what he's doing.
[01:19:03.795 --> 01:19:06.337]  Because, I mean, I see it all the time.
[01:19:06.337 --> 01:19:10.280]  People are insecure if they go to a country club that's above their standard if they're white.
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:12.081]  Or black folks will think, I don't want to go there.
[01:19:12.802 --> 01:19:19.529]  You know, uh, that's, uh, I mean, I had black friends in high school who were like, I don't really want to, you know, really want me to go to that golf course with you and go to that country club.
[01:19:19.529 --> 01:19:20.670]  You think people like me there?
[01:19:20.670 --> 01:19:24.234]  You know, I get that, and there's Obama trying to evoke it.
[01:19:24.234 --> 01:19:26.676]  Let me tell you what people are looking at at a country club nowadays.
[01:19:26.676 --> 01:19:30.200]  How sharp your car is, your posture, and how you're dressed.
[01:19:31.021 --> 01:19:32.221]  And do you act arrogant?
[01:19:32.221 --> 01:19:44.185]  If you act black, I mean, if you're black and you go in there and you act like you're the president, everyone will kiss your ass.
[01:19:44.185 --> 01:19:50.506]  If you sit there and you act like a thug and you're a white guy, everybody's going to want to throw you out of a place.
[01:19:50.506 --> 01:19:52.647]  That's what it comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:52.647 --> 01:19:54.007]  That's where all this goes.
[01:19:54.007 --> 01:19:55.988]  That's how all this sits there and operates.
[01:19:55.988 --> 01:19:59.469]  And the media is trying to tell us how we're supposed to act to create division.
[01:19:59.469 --> 01:20:00.389]  Your phone call's coming up.
[01:20:00.789 --> 01:20:02.030]  What does freedom mean to you?
[01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:05.193]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[01:20:05.193 --> 01:20:08.996]  At eFoods Direct, we're again celebrating Food Freedom Month.

[01:22:09.241 --> 01:22:16.206]  Is this capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:16.206 --> 01:22:19.909]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:22:19.909 --> 01:22:20.870]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[01:23:05.103 --> 01:23:06.745]  What are bitcoins?
[01:23:06.745 --> 01:23:13.231]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.

[01:23:15.053 --> 01:23:20.734]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.

[01:23:57.257 --> 01:23:58.799]  We mine your business.
[01:24:20.967 --> 01:24:30.332]  But I take my focus, I take my anger, I take it all, and I try to direct it towards the globalists.
[01:24:30.332 --> 01:24:34.855]  And to see them trying to invoke, bring back all the classism, racism,
[01:24:36.266 --> 01:24:38.507]  And to manage us makes me disgusted.
[01:24:38.507 --> 01:24:48.410]  We have a graphic up on InfoWars.com that Anthony Frieda put together, Divide and Conquer, that breaks it all down, exactly what the globalists are doing.
[01:24:48.410 --> 01:24:50.870]  I mean, people are absolutely integrating together.
[01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:53.291]  People are getting along better than ever.
[01:24:53.291 --> 01:24:58.793]  And I'm telling you, stuff like this is meant so the government can divide and conquer and manage everybody.
[01:24:58.793 --> 01:25:01.474]  I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[01:25:01.474 --> 01:25:02.674]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[01:25:02.674 --> 01:25:05.095]  In fact, I'm going to do it right now.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:14.003]  And then when we come back from break, I will briefly get into the showdown on Obamacare and a bunch of other news.
[01:25:14.003 --> 01:25:28.389]  And then we have Quan LX, I shouldn't yell and scream on air, I lose my voice, joining us to talk about the Black Panther, new Black Panther Party rally they had yesterday and all the things that happened down there and his take on all this.
[01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:29.770]  This should be interesting and informative.
[01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:35.953]  I'm going to try to actually talk to this guy and say, really, really, this is all, we ought to get some Klan people on the show too.
[01:25:36.977 --> 01:25:42.159]  And of course Matt I'll say Jones had the clown on and said he loved him.
[01:25:42.159 --> 01:25:45.880]  But he had a wonderful new Black Panther party on so I guess it's okay.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.022]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andrew in Florida.
[01:25:50.022 --> 01:25:50.702]  You're on the air.
[01:25:50.702 --> 01:25:52.643]  Welcome.
[01:25:52.643 --> 01:25:54.604]  Hello Alex, this is Andrew.
[01:25:54.604 --> 01:25:55.564]  First time caller.
[01:25:55.564 --> 01:26:04.127]  I wanted to say real quick I appreciate what you do every day and I do what I can to figure things out and do my own research.
[01:26:04.127 --> 01:26:06.268]  And I just wanted to bring up a specific point
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.923]  I'm an employee at a local grocery store.
[01:26:10.923 --> 01:26:20.271]  I'm not going to use any names, but I've investigated a certain type of drinking water for babies called nursery water.
[01:26:20.271 --> 01:26:22.473]  I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say that on the air.
[01:26:22.473 --> 01:26:23.714]  Yeah, but I know all about it.
[01:26:23.714 --> 01:26:30.340]  I've probably shot, let's not exaggerate, 20 reports on it, where it even has higher levels.
[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:31.001]  They have come out.
[01:26:31.914 --> 01:26:39.638]  And they have said, what, seven years ago, the American Dental Association said stop brushing kids' teeth with fluoride.
[01:26:39.638 --> 01:26:43.580]  It causes fluorosis, cracking of teeth, and reduction of IQ.
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:47.102]  They've said take it out of pesticide that they spray on crops because it bioaccumulates.
[01:26:48.362 --> 01:27:15.578]  And they've also gone around and I had to admit because the lawsuits and the science and they had I bashed government all day they had 97% of the toxicologists and and and and scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency in 2000 and again in 2005 or so and then again two years ago send letters with their names
[01:27:17.381 --> 01:27:20.522]  Saying, take this out of the drinking water.
[01:27:20.522 --> 01:27:26.845]  And the answer was, we'll go from 1.6 part per million is federally recommended to 1.07.
[01:27:26.845 --> 01:27:33.148]  So they cut it basically in half.
[01:27:33.148 --> 01:27:35.829]  That's still deadly.
[01:27:35.829 --> 01:27:39.010]  And again, yes, everywhere.
[01:27:39.010 --> 01:27:42.611]  The government has been forced to say, don't give babies fluoride water.
[01:27:42.611 --> 01:27:46.173]  I mean, you might as well literally give them a lobotomy.
[01:27:47.148 --> 01:27:49.691]  And I mean, I've drunk that nursery water on air.
[01:27:49.691 --> 01:27:52.714]  I mean, you can taste the chemical in it.
[01:27:52.714 --> 01:27:55.337]  I mean, it tastes like pool water, folks.
[01:27:55.337 --> 01:27:56.498]  And it's for the kids.
[01:27:56.498 --> 01:27:58.240]  And by the way, I was in a CVS.
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.483]  The manager came over and goes, you're the one shot that video in here.
[01:28:00.483 --> 01:28:01.183]  I know my store.
[01:28:01.183 --> 01:28:02.124]  I went, yeah.
[01:28:02.825 --> 01:28:03.365]  No problem.
[01:28:03.365 --> 01:28:05.606]  Actually, I just think it's
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:34.661]  It's a little strange and in a weird way kind of funny.
[01:28:34.661 --> 01:28:43.583]  But when you look at the packaging for this type of water, I'm pretty sure you've noticed that it provides the information that fluoride is added.
[01:28:43.583 --> 01:28:46.124]  Like it's a huge benefit.
[01:28:46.124 --> 01:28:53.026]  I look at this and the way I read it, it's like, with fluoride added, it's good for your children.
[01:28:53.026 --> 01:28:56.247]  And I think it's pretty insane, in my opinion.
[01:28:57.359 --> 01:29:12.042]  If anyone does any basic research on fluoride, and I did a little investigation on the supposed usage by Hitler on his death camps with his... No, that's insurance, rise and fall of the Third Reich.
[01:29:12.042 --> 01:29:13.763]  He got it from the Soviets.
[01:29:13.763 --> 01:29:17.343]  It's a fact, since about 1925, the Russians, with U.S.
[01:29:17.343 --> 01:29:23.905]  government advisors from the Rockefeller Brother Foundation, were spiking the water with about three parts per million.
[01:29:25.286 --> 01:29:30.529]  That becomes so obvious, though we're not good androids for them, that slows you down too much.
[01:29:30.529 --> 01:29:33.431]  In a work camp, you only want about one part per six.
[01:29:33.431 --> 01:29:35.073]  1.6 parts per million.
[01:29:35.073 --> 01:29:37.674]  That's why we get work camp dosages.
[01:29:37.674 --> 01:29:38.795]  America?
[01:29:38.795 --> 01:29:40.436]  You can't blame America for being zombies.
[01:29:40.436 --> 01:29:43.919]  We've been under chemical attack since the 1950s.
[01:29:43.919 --> 01:29:44.780]  Okay?
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:46.241]  We'll be right back with more of your phone calls.
[01:29:46.241 --> 01:29:50.083]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.083 --> 01:29:51.464]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.464 --> 01:29:52.966]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.971 --> 01:30:00.998]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.998 --> 01:30:05.843]  Now why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:30:05.843 --> 01:30:08.967]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:30:08.967 --> 01:30:14.532]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:30:14.532 --> 01:30:16.154]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:30:16.434 --> 01:30:18.075]  We are what we eat.
[01:30:18.075 --> 01:30:22.757]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:30:22.757 --> 01:30:26.960]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.541]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:30:29.541 --> 01:30:35.764]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:32:05.339 --> 01:32:08.221]  Coffee shops, airports, libraries.
[01:32:08.221 --> 01:32:12.444]  But using public Wi-Fi means that people can spy on you.
[01:32:12.444 --> 01:32:17.908]  And it's easy as... Yep, they can access your data at the touch of a button.

[01:32:27.914 --> 01:32:36.117]  Well, it's kinda nerdy, but to put it simply, spies and companies that track you don't like us one bit.
[01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:40.198]  We create an encrypted tunnel so that nobody can spy on you.

[01:33:24.798 --> 01:33:34.640]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:38.321]  Alright, I'm not going to start talking now, or I'll never go to your calls.
[01:33:38.321 --> 01:33:40.501]  Let's just go to your calls right now.
[01:33:40.501 --> 01:33:42.742]  Let's talk to Andrew in the UK.
[01:33:42.742 --> 01:33:43.402]  You're on the air.
[01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:46.307]  Ah, hello Alex.
[01:33:46.307 --> 01:33:47.808]  Hey buddy.
[01:33:47.808 --> 01:33:49.129]  Good to finally talk.
[01:33:49.129 --> 01:33:52.071]  I called yesterday but it was pulling a hold of 40 minutes and I had to walk the dog.
[01:33:52.071 --> 01:33:57.894]  Anyway, I've got you linked in right now which I do pretty much every day on infoaudio.net.
[01:33:57.894 --> 01:33:59.976]  That's my thing in the United Kingdom.
[01:33:59.976 --> 01:34:01.697]  Awesome.
[01:34:01.697 --> 01:34:10.282]  So yeah, I don't know how many listeners you've got stateside but I'm sure it's kind of double that over here now because I've been on since the 29th of February of last year.
[01:34:10.282 --> 01:34:11.063]  And to be honest with you,
[01:34:11.795 --> 01:34:13.376]  I hadn't heard of Alex Jones.
[01:34:13.376 --> 01:34:15.938]  The only Alex Jones I knew about was a BBC One presenter.
[01:34:15.938 --> 01:34:18.500]  I don't know if you're aware of her.
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:20.061]  On the One Show.
[01:34:20.061 --> 01:34:21.722]  So somebody says, have you heard of Alex Jones?
[01:34:21.722 --> 01:34:23.283]  I went, that woman on BBC One?
[01:34:23.283 --> 01:34:23.604]  He goes, no.
[01:34:23.604 --> 01:34:24.264]  I went, no.
[01:34:24.264 --> 01:34:25.885]  The guy from Austin, Texas.
[01:34:25.885 --> 01:34:28.167]  It was Infowars.com.
[01:34:28.167 --> 01:34:29.328]  So I had a look at your site.
[01:34:29.328 --> 01:34:31.109]  I thought, right, this guy's opinionated.
[01:34:31.109 --> 01:34:32.070]  He's outspoken.
[01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:37.814]  So it's good to know that there's other people out there that are willing to take that risk and talk out loud.
[01:34:39.281 --> 01:34:46.906]  Well, worldwide, the broadcast is growing, and I just see that as a metric, a measurement of the global awakening.
[01:34:46.906 --> 01:34:55.551]  And it's different strokes for different folks, there's different ideas out there, but overall, we know we're going in the wrong direction.
[01:34:55.551 --> 01:35:00.574]  We know we're going into a planned global economy run by some very nasty people.
[01:35:01.634 --> 01:35:04.076]  And it's time to wake up.
[01:35:04.076 --> 01:35:10.801]  What percentage of Brits do you really think are actually fawning and worshipping over the new royal baby?
[01:35:10.801 --> 01:35:16.466]  I mean, I think Kate Middleton is attractive and seems like a nice lady because she is a commoner.
[01:35:16.986 --> 01:35:21.868]  I mean, and I'm not against inbred elites just because they're inbred elites.
[01:35:21.868 --> 01:35:28.011]  I'm against them because of what they do, but worshipping a bunch of inbred mental midgets on average?
[01:35:28.011 --> 01:35:31.012]  I mean, why am I supposed to worship someone?
[01:35:31.012 --> 01:35:41.916]  I mean, we all know people whose dad gave their son a business, and the person's a jerk, and we don't like them because, you know, they were given everything, and they're usually jerks because they don't appreciate anything.
[01:35:41.916 --> 01:35:45.538]  We all know that, but we all admire self-made men and women, at least I do.
[01:35:46.338 --> 01:35:55.062]  And, but then there's also people who've been given a lot, but who've also done a lot with it, and then you admire them as well.
[01:35:55.062 --> 01:36:01.625]  But just the royalty, and then everyone bowing down to them, I mean, it's absolutely disgusting.
[01:36:01.625 --> 01:36:04.046]  But I've asked my question, what you calling about?
[01:36:04.884 --> 01:36:08.946]  Yeah, just to say that I've got you linked into infoaudio.net.
[01:36:08.946 --> 01:36:14.128]  Like I say, I start to do my live show after you finish about 9 o'clock.
[01:36:14.128 --> 01:36:17.109]  I think I'll patch you in about 5, 6 in the afternoon because of the time delay.
[01:36:17.768 --> 01:36:19.510]  I'll do my thing, I'll do a news section at ten.
[01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:22.294]  I'll do the big section on the Royal Family.
[01:36:22.294 --> 01:36:23.796]  I don't like the worship of wealth.
[01:36:23.796 --> 01:36:25.998]  They're human beings after all.
[01:36:25.998 --> 01:36:29.402]  And that baby's going to be brought up in, you know, flash photography.
[01:36:29.402 --> 01:36:31.225]  When she comes out of the hospital, you know what it's going to be like.
[01:36:31.225 --> 01:36:33.247]  They're going to be all paps there.
[01:36:33.247 --> 01:36:37.352]  And she'll just come out, there'll be a few photos, they'll do 32-page pull-outs for it.
[01:36:37.737 --> 01:36:40.179]  It's this sort of worship of wealth that I don't like.
[01:36:40.179 --> 01:36:46.285]  And I'm not a royalist, obviously, but I'd say, in answer to your question, the percentage of people, I'd say 10 to 20%.
[01:36:46.285 --> 01:36:53.832]  You know, it's the older generation that will stand and wait for the Queen to come out to wave and get passed.
[01:36:53.832 --> 01:36:56.594]  You know, the youth of today, they ain't interested in that.
[01:36:56.594 --> 01:37:01.278]  In fact, the way I promote my, what I do, infoaudio.net, is via fake money.
[01:37:01.278 --> 01:37:01.819]  I print
[01:37:02.299 --> 01:37:03.121]  Counterfeit money.
[01:37:03.121 --> 01:37:04.804]  With my logos on it.
[01:37:04.804 --> 01:37:06.587]  I've got £5 issued out there.
[01:37:06.587 --> 01:37:09.071]  And we're doing a £10, a £20... You know, that's a great idea.
[01:37:09.071 --> 01:37:10.333]  I want to come back out.
[01:37:10.333 --> 01:37:12.036]  Because they have the conspiracy notes.
[01:37:12.952 --> 01:37:20.796]  I want to come back out with a global government currency and make it like a joke, but have factoids all over it.
[01:37:20.796 --> 01:37:28.541]  And maybe we'll do one like Vampire-in-Chief with the Queen of England and then another that has, you know, eugenicist mass murderer-in-chief David Rockefeller.
[01:37:28.541 --> 01:37:29.621]  I've been wanting to do that for a while.
[01:37:29.621 --> 01:37:30.862]  That's a great idea.
[01:37:30.862 --> 01:37:34.144]  And handbills, hand it out to people, then get them to your site.
[01:37:34.964 --> 01:37:40.868]  You can generally get enough ad revenue off that, even with automated systems, to pay for more handbills.
[01:37:40.868 --> 01:37:47.172]  And then you self-fund getting the word out using a free market.
[01:37:47.172 --> 01:37:48.913]  That's how you do it.
[01:37:48.913 --> 01:37:49.633]  Absolutely.
[01:37:49.633 --> 01:37:50.214]  Anything else, sir?
[01:37:51.042 --> 01:37:52.283]  Yeah, that's it, Alex.
[01:37:52.283 --> 01:37:54.624]  Basically, I'm a self-funder.
[01:37:54.624 --> 01:37:57.246]  I don't advertise on my site.
[01:37:57.246 --> 01:37:58.046]  It's a .net.
[01:37:58.046 --> 01:37:59.487]  It's not a .com.
[01:37:59.487 --> 01:38:00.948]  No, no, I think self-funding's great.
[01:38:00.948 --> 01:38:09.193]  If you're a doctor, or a businessman, or a woman, and you have extra money, donating it to the fight, doing it yourself, is beautiful.
[01:38:09.193 --> 01:38:11.214]  Or have a hobby of a YouTube channel.
[01:38:11.214 --> 01:38:11.694]  Whatever.
[01:38:11.694 --> 01:38:14.296]  All of us doing a little something will bring the globalists down.
[01:38:15.592 --> 01:38:18.854]  Yeah, to be honest with you, though, I'm kind of happy not advertising.
[01:38:18.854 --> 01:38:22.296]  That way I don't have to answer to sponsors or anything like that.
[01:38:22.296 --> 01:38:24.397]  I can actually talk freely.
[01:38:24.397 --> 01:38:25.778]  I've got friends who are printers.
[01:38:25.778 --> 01:38:27.039]  They'll print it real cheap.
[01:38:27.039 --> 01:38:28.500]  I mean, it's the paper... Yeah, but here's the deal.
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.281]  You don't have to answer for sponsors.
[01:38:30.281 --> 01:38:34.163]  There's a lot of automated ad systems where you can approve and disapprove.
[01:38:34.163 --> 01:38:43.769]  They just come to you and they go into an automated market and you say your price and then, you know, say you only accept libertarian or anti-globalism advertising.
[01:38:44.269 --> 01:38:51.693]  I mean, look, they've made it dirty to make money because they want to make it all and then use their control of the market to shut us off.
[01:38:51.693 --> 01:38:53.654]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[01:38:53.654 --> 01:39:05.901]  You know, it's come out that came out 15 years ago when I first saw it that high-end stores everywhere through a database of digital driver's license photos in a global database is they sell this data.
[01:39:05.901 --> 01:39:07.982]  A lot of businesses have a secondary thing of selling data.
[01:39:08.956 --> 01:39:26.623]  When you go in to a Barnes and Noble or whatever these stores are that have the face scanning systems, they know what you read, what you buy, your size, they know how much you spend, and they now have screens that will direct their sales people to who really has money.
[01:39:26.623 --> 01:39:30.905]  Now folks, that's an invasion of your privacy, okay?
[01:39:30.905 --> 01:39:37.868]  And they want you to get a customer loyalty card because that's a contract allowing them to use all the data and sell your data.
[01:39:39.192 --> 01:39:44.354]  And there it is, high-end stores use facial recognition tools to spot VIPs.
[01:39:44.354 --> 01:39:47.836]  And that's a story, what is that, out of Forbes?
[01:39:47.836 --> 01:39:49.316]  NPR also reported on it.
[01:39:49.316 --> 01:39:53.958]  But the bigger issue, and I have it here in my stack, is they're using it to cheat you.
[01:39:53.958 --> 01:40:00.541]  In fact, stores use facial recognition to gouge wealthy shoppers, but it's not really even wealthy.
[01:40:00.541 --> 01:40:02.962]  If you surf fancy things,
[01:40:05.206 --> 01:40:07.227]  The computer thinks, oh, you're buying yachts.
[01:40:07.227 --> 01:40:15.831]  No, maybe I was doing research on politicians buying yachts with taxpayer money, or maybe I was looking at, researching a jet that went down.
[01:40:15.831 --> 01:40:20.334]  I'm not really going to be buying a $25 million jet or whatever.
[01:40:20.334 --> 01:40:21.334]  It doesn't matter.
[01:40:21.334 --> 01:40:21.874]  You do that.
[01:40:21.874 --> 01:40:23.115]  I mean, I've gone and looked at jets.
[01:40:23.115 --> 01:40:24.456]  I've gone and looked up Globalist.
[01:40:24.456 --> 01:40:33.200]  I've gone, and then next I'm getting, you know, Russian Faberge egg advertisements, you know, a year later on my computer.
[01:40:34.304 --> 01:40:38.427]  I went and looked up the Mercedes that Michael Hastings was in.
[01:40:38.427 --> 01:40:39.968]  We looked at it on computers all over the office.
[01:40:39.968 --> 01:40:41.829]  Now there's Mercedes ads everywhere.
[01:40:41.829 --> 01:40:46.113]  Now I'm getting mail for the Mercedes at my house.
[01:40:46.113 --> 01:40:48.454]  The exact Mercedes.
[01:40:48.454 --> 01:40:49.575]  You see how that works, folks?
[01:40:49.575 --> 01:40:54.318]  I mean, you need to be aware of this.
[01:40:54.318 --> 01:40:57.541]  And so, they're all using the system to game us.
[01:40:59.175 --> 01:41:02.738]  And then meanwhile, we're like, oh, we better not write a book and sell it.
[01:41:02.738 --> 01:41:05.600]  My goodness, I don't want to profiteer off my ideas.
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:12.065]  Well, folks, you've got to sell things to build a base, to build an operation.
[01:41:12.065 --> 01:41:17.709]  You can write a book and give it out for free, and if you already have money, that's fine.
[01:41:17.709 --> 01:41:18.850]  That's a labor of love.
[01:41:18.850 --> 01:41:21.912]  Half the time, people don't even appreciate it if it's given to them for free.
[01:41:21.912 --> 01:41:25.735]  And we give most of what we do out for free, but we've got to do enough to pay for things.
[01:41:26.698 --> 01:41:28.262]  What I'm looking for is unlocked minds.
[01:41:28.262 --> 01:41:29.184]  That's my treasure.
[01:41:29.184 --> 01:41:32.432]  I'm looking for freedom, a future.
[01:41:32.432 --> 01:41:34.116]  I'm a bleeding heart libertarian.
[01:41:34.116 --> 01:41:35.780]  I'm a bleeding heart fan of humanity.
[01:41:37.045 --> 01:41:45.710]  I'm a bleeding heart lover of humanity, lover of art, lover of goodness, lover of courage, lover of beauty, lover of life.
[01:41:45.710 --> 01:41:47.892]  Love it, love it, love it, love it.
[01:41:47.892 --> 01:41:53.996]  Hate scum, hate thugs, hate tyrants, hate criminals, hate gangs, hate because they're scum.
[01:41:53.996 --> 01:41:54.996]  They're parasites.
[01:41:54.996 --> 01:42:00.840]  And when I see a parasite, a tick attached to my dog that I missed in between its toes, it's been there for two weeks.
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:02.421]  I'm ashamed I didn't look over the animal.
[01:42:03.618 --> 01:42:05.599]  I'm ashamed I haven't given him a bath.
[01:42:05.599 --> 01:42:09.059]  I'm ashamed it's got a tick big and fat.
[01:42:09.059 --> 01:42:18.182]  And then I didn't get that tick off and I pull that tick off and I take it outside and I grind it into the ground because I don't like parasites.
[01:42:18.182 --> 01:42:19.782]  It's like good dentists will tell you.
[01:42:19.782 --> 01:42:22.923]  You think it's gross pulling out rotten teeth and pus coming out and stuff?
[01:42:22.923 --> 01:42:24.924]  There's like a satisfaction.
[01:42:24.924 --> 01:42:26.924]  But it's not that you like pus.
[01:42:26.924 --> 01:42:28.184]  It's like you like healing.
[01:42:28.184 --> 01:42:29.525]  You like removing the pus.
[01:42:30.643 --> 01:42:32.584]  You like helping people.
[01:42:32.584 --> 01:42:40.988]  Not because you're some goody two-shoe who does it from a fake perspective to act like you're a good person, but because it's who you want your children to be.
[01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:42.129]  It's who you are.
[01:42:42.129 --> 01:42:44.750]  It's what flows from you.
[01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:48.953]  So they come to good people and go, oh, you shouldn't have a radio show and make money.
[01:42:48.953 --> 01:42:51.034]  How do you think you build an economy?
[01:42:51.034 --> 01:42:52.635]  How do you think you build a new media?
[01:42:52.635 --> 01:42:54.676]  You've got to go out and you've got to
[01:42:56.189 --> 01:43:11.691]  Put the information out, do the best research you can, and then sell products you already use that you know are good to share with others and give them a good price so that they can communally, but in an individual way, vote with their dollars and
[01:43:12.251 --> 01:43:14.211]  Vote up the organic food.
[01:43:14.211 --> 01:43:16.592]  Vote up the best vitamins and supplements.
[01:43:16.592 --> 01:43:18.212]  Vote up the best films.
[01:43:18.212 --> 01:43:22.613]  Vote up the best culture, the best t-shirts, the best art, the best ideas.
[01:43:22.613 --> 01:43:23.653]  Vote up!
[01:43:23.653 --> 01:43:34.115]  You have to choose with your dollars, with your decisions, with your feet, what you promote to crush the enemy instead of them force feeding.
[01:43:34.115 --> 01:43:36.956]  I mean, I don't let my children watch television unless it's like
[01:43:39.867 --> 01:43:45.708]  Archaeology shows, history shows, hunting, fishing shows, things like that.
[01:43:45.708 --> 01:43:51.069]  But whenever we go to a hotel or something, and we flip through the children's channels, it's every channel is, be gay!
[01:43:51.069 --> 01:43:53.549]  For stuff targeting seven-year-olds.
[01:43:53.549 --> 01:43:55.530]  And it's like, oh, but it's politically correct.
[01:43:55.530 --> 01:43:58.730]  Let them sexualize children if it's gay.
[01:43:58.730 --> 01:44:00.191]  And I'm offended by that.
[01:44:00.191 --> 01:44:02.891]  It's like, you're a bigot if you don't let us sexualize your kids.
[01:44:02.891 --> 01:44:08.132]  See, they couldn't say, hey, teach your kid, teach your seven-year-old daughter how to go out and find a sugar daddy.
[01:44:08.817 --> 01:44:10.378]  You'd be like, that's pedophilia!
[01:44:10.378 --> 01:44:15.362]  But see, if it's, hey kids, be gay, it's, oh, that's just, you know, tolerance.
[01:44:15.362 --> 01:44:19.505]  See, the truth is the globalists are a bunch of degenerates, folks.
[01:44:19.505 --> 01:44:23.488]  And so it's the thrill of sexualizing a child.
[01:44:23.488 --> 01:44:26.430]  That's all they've got left is screwing up wholesome good things.
[01:44:26.430 --> 01:44:28.312]  And it makes me want to beat people's brains out.
[01:44:29.735 --> 01:44:34.320]  I mean, that's a normal response to messing with people's kids.
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.461]  And it's going to get worse and worse.
[01:44:35.461 --> 01:44:38.083]  I mean, the public schools, I have a curriculum article.
[01:44:38.083 --> 01:44:39.505]  You guys gave it to me and I can't find it.
[01:44:39.505 --> 01:44:40.606]  Will you print it again?
[01:44:40.606 --> 01:44:45.271]  Where they're now going to teach the racism of guns and how they're meant to kill black people.
[01:44:45.271 --> 01:44:46.231]  That's the party line.
[01:44:46.231 --> 01:44:47.893]  Of course they were coming out with that.
[01:44:47.893 --> 01:44:49.395]  And how they teach five-year-olds.
[01:44:51.101 --> 01:45:12.021]  That two daddies, and that men have sex together, and that women have sex together, and then you can say, oh, whatever, don't be a square, Alex, I bet you like, you know, women together or whatever, you know, all the, well, I like beauty, period, but the whole point is, is that I know where it bleeds, where it goes, and then you're sitting there, shoving it on five-year-olds?
[01:45:12.021 --> 01:45:14.464]  Five-year-olds shouldn't even be thinking about that.
[01:45:17.483 --> 01:45:19.824]  They're ruining natural discovery.
[01:45:19.824 --> 01:45:22.004]  They're ruining normal behavior.
[01:45:22.004 --> 01:45:31.207]  And all the studies show, when you make a child mature early, you are actually abusing their psyche and their IQ and their development, and it stunts their development.
[01:45:31.207 --> 01:45:40.450]  It's like if you take steroids when you're 10 years old, it's going to infuse your growth plates and you're going to be a midget.
[01:45:40.450 --> 01:45:45.212]  If you take them when you're 14, you're going to have four years of growth you're not going to get.
[01:45:49.363 --> 01:45:51.524]  Do they tell people that?
[01:45:51.524 --> 01:45:54.525]  No, that's... So it's like they go, oh, you're just anti-gay.
[01:45:54.525 --> 01:45:57.706]  Yeah, the fish, the frogs are coming out bisexual.
[01:45:57.706 --> 01:45:58.886]  They're like, what are you, against that?
[01:45:58.886 --> 01:46:00.407]  Are you against their sexual preference?
[01:46:00.407 --> 01:46:02.968]  They're having their sexual preference taken.
[01:46:02.968 --> 01:46:03.888]  They're being attacked.
[01:46:03.888 --> 01:46:05.429]  I want to go to this Fluoride report.
[01:46:05.429 --> 01:46:06.049]  The guys found it.
[01:46:06.049 --> 01:46:07.590]  There's like... No exaggeration.
[01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:08.110]  I've probably done...
[01:46:08.851 --> 01:46:11.935]  20, 30, 40 reports on nursery water.
[01:46:11.935 --> 01:46:17.142]  And they've got like with the school buses, all these brands, and it says, go into school, get your fluoride moms.
[01:46:17.142 --> 01:46:20.967]  And the moms, I see them at the store going, and I walk over and go, ma'am, please look up the study.
[01:46:22.907 --> 01:46:23.827]  On fluoride.
[01:46:23.827 --> 01:46:27.009]  I'll be in the water, I'll see a woman putting her thing on, I'll go, hey, how you doing?
[01:46:27.009 --> 01:46:28.169]  And I do this because I care.
[01:46:28.169 --> 01:46:30.230]  I mean, I'd be a weirdo if I didn't render aid.
[01:46:30.230 --> 01:46:35.572]  And I go, listen, I don't want to get in your business, but I know, you know, fluoride, calcium fluoride, a little bit helps the teeth.
[01:46:35.572 --> 01:46:36.492]  We need everything.
[01:46:36.492 --> 01:46:40.534]  We need a little bit of arsenic, you know, a little bit of cyanides and apples.
[01:46:40.534 --> 01:46:44.275]  But I said, listen, they've actually said reduce the amount of fluoride out there.
[01:46:44.275 --> 01:46:48.457]  It's actually causing dental fluorosis and stuff a lot worse.
[01:46:48.457 --> 01:46:50.498]  Will you just look up the Harvard study?
[01:46:51.218 --> 01:46:55.282]  And the woman's like, sure, but I'm a man, so they don't really listen.
[01:46:55.282 --> 01:47:02.410]  They listen to the advertisement because the TV patronizes them and talks to the women, oh, you're the boss now, you're the... But if I was a woman...
[01:47:04.324 --> 01:47:05.685]  Then women tend to listen to women.
[01:47:05.685 --> 01:47:06.827]  I've watched this.
[01:47:06.827 --> 01:47:08.348]  I've seen my wife talk to people about it.
[01:47:08.348 --> 01:47:09.849]  Then women will actually listen to her.
[01:47:09.849 --> 01:47:14.474]  I mean, since when does a woman not want to listen to a man going, hey, I see you got your kids here.
[01:47:14.474 --> 01:47:15.215]  You just bought that.
[01:47:15.215 --> 01:47:16.896]  That's really going to hurt your kids.
[01:47:16.896 --> 01:47:18.638]  Please just look it up.
[01:47:18.638 --> 01:47:21.841]  And I had one woman go, they can put anything on the Internet.
[01:47:21.841 --> 01:47:23.343]  I said, listen, it's a Harvard study.
[01:47:23.343 --> 01:47:24.404]  This is just about six months ago.
[01:47:26.826 --> 01:47:30.370]  And my kids now have gone from saying, Daddy, don't, now they're not even embarrassed.
[01:47:30.370 --> 01:47:31.411]  That's good.
[01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:35.715]  When I'm at the grocery store or I'm at a gas station, now they're the ones telling people.
[01:47:35.715 --> 01:47:38.198]  Because at first, they need to get past being embarrassed.
[01:47:38.198 --> 01:47:39.359]  Slaves are embarrassed.
[01:47:39.359 --> 01:47:40.961]  Slaves are scared to speak out.
[01:47:40.961 --> 01:47:47.247]  Slaves sit there and take chemical weapons advertised on a hook for kids, like a worm for a bass.
[01:47:47.247 --> 01:47:47.868]  Here, kids,
[01:47:48.388 --> 01:47:50.469]  It's fluoride for the children!
[01:47:50.469 --> 01:47:52.589]  With the smiley kids getting on the school bus!
[01:47:52.589 --> 01:47:56.370]  With, you know, drawing with little kids and, you know, stick figures with a puppy.
[01:47:56.370 --> 01:47:59.211]  Oh, it's nursery water for kids, the school bus.
[01:47:59.211 --> 01:48:02.772]  You know, it's like a six-pack of water with a school bus on the side with kids.
[01:48:02.772 --> 01:48:05.553]  On the plastic packaging around it, getting on the school bus.
[01:48:05.553 --> 01:48:08.194]  Yeah, getting on the brain-damaged cancer bus.
[01:48:08.194 --> 01:48:11.395]  I mean, I would be a scumbag if I didn't talk to those people.
[01:48:11.395 --> 01:48:12.115]  Let's go to this clip.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.420]  There I am videotaping it.
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:18.981]  ...bombarding you everywhere with stuff that poisons you.
[01:48:18.981 --> 01:48:24.023]  Fluoride, which the American Mental Association has admitted for five years.
[01:48:24.023 --> 01:48:26.503]  Children under five shouldn't even brush their teeth with it or drink it.
[01:48:26.503 --> 01:48:28.684]  No, this is two years ago, so it's five years ago.
[01:48:28.684 --> 01:48:29.604]  I mean, I was seven.
[01:48:29.604 --> 01:48:31.405]  ...nursery water for the baby with fluoride.
[01:48:31.405 --> 01:48:36.546]  And then, you go down this aisle,
[01:48:39.361 --> 01:48:41.923]  And it's you versus the flu at CVS.
[01:48:41.923 --> 01:48:43.544]  Get your flu shot.
[01:48:43.544 --> 01:48:46.486]  When they admit that it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next year.
[01:48:46.486 --> 01:48:48.568]  Big Canadian studies.
[01:48:48.568 --> 01:48:52.771]  And they admit they've never guessed the year before what the flu's going to be the next year.
[01:48:52.771 --> 01:48:55.293]  I mean, total hoax.
[01:48:55.293 --> 01:48:56.574]  Totally worthless.
[01:48:56.574 --> 01:48:59.837]  Three flu shots and you double your chances of getting Alzheimer's.
[01:48:59.837 --> 01:49:00.537]  Just Google that.
[01:49:00.537 --> 01:49:01.358]  Search it.
[01:49:01.358 --> 01:49:01.878]  Look it up.
[01:49:01.878 --> 01:49:03.019]  They admit it.
[01:49:03.019 --> 01:49:05.681]  And then down here, more anti-human propaganda.
[01:49:05.681 --> 01:49:06.902]  Just everywhere is propaganda.
[01:49:08.965 --> 01:49:11.928]  Oh, CVS, you know, buy their product because it's Earth-friendly.
[01:49:11.928 --> 01:49:17.713]  And again, there's a lot of reasonable stuff environmentally, but they tag this onto the whole eugenics, anti-human agenda.
[01:49:17.713 --> 01:49:20.676]  It's all about bossing you around, making you feel guilty.
[01:49:20.676 --> 01:49:24.000]  When you go through this place, it is just everywhere.
[01:49:25.043 --> 01:49:27.825]  Everywhere, in every store you go to just bombard you.
[01:49:27.825 --> 01:49:29.586]  You need fluoride for your kids.
[01:49:29.586 --> 01:49:34.370]  You need mercury filled vaccines.
[01:49:34.370 --> 01:49:36.231]  You need all of this.
[01:49:36.231 --> 01:49:41.955]  I noticed they push it in the chemical aisle as well.
[01:49:41.955 --> 01:49:47.899]  The flu shots, which is where it really should be.
[01:49:47.899 --> 01:49:53.123]  Oh look, right by the fluoride nursery water in the pharmacy area, you've got
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:56.602]  The mercury-filled vaccines.
[01:49:56.602 --> 01:50:00.545]  And of course, all of this is just ongoing.
[01:50:00.545 --> 01:50:02.846]  This is what I'm bombarded with.
[01:50:02.846 --> 01:50:03.607]  Take the shots.
[01:50:03.607 --> 01:50:05.268]  Do you notice how you're being bombarded?
[01:50:05.268 --> 01:50:06.249]  Do you like it?
[01:50:06.249 --> 01:50:07.450]  Drink the water.
[01:50:07.450 --> 01:50:08.610]  Your kid will never talk again.
[01:50:08.610 --> 01:50:09.171]  Isn't that nice?
[01:50:09.171 --> 01:50:10.672]  Isn't that cute?
[01:50:10.672 --> 01:50:11.352]  Hey!
[01:50:11.352 --> 01:50:12.833]  You want a brain-damaged kid?
[01:50:12.833 --> 01:50:15.055]  You gotta change their diapers until they're 35?
[01:50:15.055 --> 01:50:17.597]  Hey, drink some nursery water, baby.
[01:50:18.652 --> 01:50:22.434]  By the way, Nursery Water, uh, whatever company puts that on, all you guys sue me!
[01:50:22.434 --> 01:50:23.074]  Come on!
[01:50:23.074 --> 01:50:23.715]  Let's go!
[01:50:23.715 --> 01:50:24.535]  Let's get in court!
[01:50:24.535 --> 01:50:27.637]  I'm gonna walk in with all the studies, all the facts!
[01:50:27.637 --> 01:50:29.377]  But they don't, you see.
[01:50:29.377 --> 01:50:29.658]  They don't.
[01:50:29.658 --> 01:50:31.779]  It's all a sick joke to them.
[01:50:31.779 --> 01:50:33.880]  And by the way, they all know full well what they're doing.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:39.864]  Just like Bayer knew it was putting in those Factor VIII, HIV and Hepatitis for all those little kids.
[01:50:39.864 --> 01:50:41.526]  Because they love you and your family.
[01:50:41.526 --> 01:50:43.908]  They love children dying slowly.
[01:50:43.908 --> 01:50:45.809]  They love robbing you of your intellect.
[01:50:45.809 --> 01:50:47.971]  They love lobotomizing you and your family.
[01:50:47.971 --> 01:50:54.096]  You're all under globalist chemical warfare, bio-warfare, GMO warfare attack.
[01:50:54.096 --> 01:50:57.019]  And we're all supposed to just sit here and take it and love it.
[01:50:57.019 --> 01:50:59.521]  Because the government's going to protect us from Al-Qaeda.
[01:50:59.521 --> 01:51:00.682]  They publicly run.
[01:51:00.682 --> 01:51:02.183]  Bill Carroll here for Blue Text.
[01:51:02.463 --> 01:51:05.604]  Just because the IRS says you owe them a lot of money, are you just gonna do what?
[01:51:05.604 --> 01:51:07.625]  Throw your hands up in the air and write a check?
[01:51:07.625 --> 01:51:08.245]  What are you doing?
[01:51:08.245 --> 01:51:10.005]  You gotta fight this stuff.

[01:51:34.072 --> 01:51:39.854]  Or how they helped set up installment agreements or got debts reduced through the proper submission of an offer in compromise.

[01:54:39.149 --> 01:54:40.569]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:54:40.569 --> 01:54:41.570]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:54:41.570 --> 01:54:43.531]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:54:43.531 --> 01:54:45.652]  Let's talk to Ernie in Michigan.
[01:54:45.652 --> 01:54:49.233]  Thank you for holding your On The Air Worldwide.
[01:54:49.233 --> 01:54:50.313]  How you doing Alex?
[01:54:50.313 --> 01:54:50.834]  Pretty good sir.
[01:54:50.834 --> 01:54:51.834]  Long time listener.
[01:54:51.834 --> 01:54:53.015]  First time caller.
[01:54:53.015 --> 01:54:53.695]  I was just trying to
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:57.942]  Get people a little hip to how to get off the grid.
[01:54:57.942 --> 01:55:02.945]  Um, are you familiar with power converters?
[01:55:02.945 --> 01:55:03.405]  A little bit.
[01:55:03.405 --> 01:55:07.107]  I'm not, I'm not an electrician, if that's what you mean.
[01:55:07.107 --> 01:55:08.128]  Well, I'm an electrician.
[01:55:08.128 --> 01:55:15.652]  So, uh, like when I go to a home that has no electricity and sometimes like here in Michigan, we have a lot of, uh, copper theft.
[01:55:15.652 --> 01:55:18.994]  So they stole the wires up and I have to rewire the house.
[01:55:18.994 --> 01:55:20.895]  So what I do, I go in with a power converter.
[01:55:21.539 --> 01:55:37.241]  And I hook it to my car which can be adapted to like home use where you can take just a car battery, an alternator, and a fan blower motor which runs your heat in your car and actually make a self-sustaining power system.
[01:55:38.453 --> 01:55:44.758]  I know there's all sorts of alternative energy things being suppressed with the fake clean energy movement they've got.
[01:55:44.758 --> 01:55:49.081]  It's really just a boondoggle bank robbery transfer to globalists.
[01:55:49.081 --> 01:55:51.583]  I mean, again, they already control the issuance of currency and credit.
[01:55:51.583 --> 01:55:58.288]  They're waging war on the physical economy with their fiat economy.
[01:55:58.288 --> 01:55:59.789]  How is Michigan doing up there?
[01:55:59.789 --> 01:56:04.913]  Beautiful state, but how are you doing under the wonders of NAFTA and GATT that Al Gore told us would be so wonderful?
[01:56:07.116 --> 01:56:07.556]  Terrible.
[01:56:07.556 --> 01:56:09.118]  We're actually going into bankruptcy.
[01:56:09.118 --> 01:56:12.361]  The city is going into bankruptcy.
[01:56:12.361 --> 01:56:14.302]  Well, that's the plan for all of us.
[01:56:14.302 --> 01:56:18.526]  We're going into bankruptcy to the globalists and their whole fiat system.
[01:56:18.526 --> 01:56:28.215]  Yeah, actually, since I've been listening to you, I've actually been spreading the word to a lot of people how they've been turning countries into companies and bankrupting the company and taking the country.
[01:56:28.215 --> 01:56:30.737]  And I was like, that's just mind boggling.
[01:56:30.737 --> 01:56:30.997]  Oh, yeah.
[01:56:30.997 --> 01:56:33.960]  Well, they set it up to where they take existing profitable companies
[01:56:35.154 --> 01:56:49.802]  And bankrupt them or create a subsidiary, steal the pensions, and now they're even taking private bank accounts and not getting in trouble because they got paramilitary SWAT teams that were set up to fight Al-Qaeda, who they run, trained and ready.
[01:56:49.802 --> 01:56:51.703]  And they want a civil war.
[01:56:51.703 --> 01:56:53.864]  And they're going to start one.
[01:56:53.864 --> 01:56:54.384]  That's the issue.
[01:56:54.384 --> 01:56:57.046]  They're going to blow stuff up, blame it on us, roll it out.
[01:56:57.046 --> 01:56:58.146]  And that's the program.
[01:56:58.146 --> 01:57:01.008]  And we either totally wake up to the hoax, or they win.
[01:57:02.461 --> 01:57:07.563]  I've been watching, like, closely, very closely, like, this is, like, crazy.
[01:57:07.563 --> 01:57:09.764]  Uh, are you familiar with Moorish Americans?
[01:57:09.764 --> 01:57:13.465]  I'm not familiar with what, sir?
[01:57:13.465 --> 01:57:15.386]  Moorish American?
[01:57:15.386 --> 01:57:16.446]  Moors?
[01:57:16.446 --> 01:57:19.128]  Uh, the, uh, folks from, uh, North Africa?
[01:57:19.128 --> 01:57:21.448]  Uh, yeah.
[01:57:21.448 --> 01:57:25.410]  They actually, uh, they were in America, too.
[01:57:25.410 --> 01:57:28.871]  Like, uh... No, no, no, I understand, but the Moors, the Moors are from North Africa.
[01:57:28.871 --> 01:57:30.272]  That's the group that invaded Spain.
[01:57:31.701 --> 01:57:33.442]  Yes, yes.
[01:57:33.442 --> 01:57:37.484]  And the original La Reconquista was taking Spain back from them.
[01:57:37.484 --> 01:57:39.645]  But yeah, go ahead.
[01:57:39.645 --> 01:57:52.611]  Yeah, but they got laws actually on American books stating that they get some things free because, you know, the Moors are the Indians too, but they changed the names.
[01:57:52.611 --> 01:57:53.752]  Yeah, I'm confused about...
[01:57:55.580 --> 01:57:57.702]  I'm confused about what group.
[01:57:57.702 --> 01:57:58.743]  Send me some info.
[01:57:58.743 --> 01:58:00.285]  We've got to end this hour.
[01:58:00.285 --> 01:58:01.546]  I'm going to come back with some more calls.
[01:58:01.546 --> 01:58:07.371]  Then we've got Quanell X, the head of the Black Panthers, the new Black Panthers down in
[01:58:08.615 --> 01:58:13.419]  Houston and all that big news that's been taking place down there with both sides armed and the rest of it.
[01:58:13.419 --> 01:58:19.604]  He's going to be popping in with us, and I will get into the whole situation on Obamacare, where they're talking about shutting the government down.
[01:58:19.604 --> 01:58:23.327]  And I say good for some of the Republican leadership that's now saying, let's kill Obamacare.
[01:58:23.327 --> 01:58:28.671]  Because, I mean, it was written by insurance companies and banks to rip everybody off.
[01:58:28.671 --> 01:58:30.472]  It's an admitted ripoff.
[01:58:30.472 --> 01:58:34.415]  I believe it's unconstitutional because it's a tax to foreign banks.
[01:58:34.415 --> 01:58:37.057]  And everybody knows it's a scam now, so let's just get rid of it.
[01:58:37.057 --> 01:58:37.618]  We'll be right back.

[02:00:25.233 --> 02:00:28.134]  I feel like I should talk in a Ted Nye voice.
[02:00:28.134 --> 02:00:35.038]  Cornel X will be joining us today, along with Aquaman, and the rest of the Legion of Doom.
[02:00:37.816 --> 02:00:42.257]  I just catch myself sometimes being silly and doing a Ted Nye voice.

[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:57.920]  Nick in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:00.541]  Yeah, how you doing Alex?
[02:01:00.541 --> 02:01:03.782]  We're about to see the battle between the Super Friends and the White Cracker.
[02:01:03.782 --> 02:01:04.902]  Sorry, I'm doing alright.
[02:01:06.823 --> 02:01:08.805]  I'm a first-time caller.
[02:01:08.805 --> 02:01:16.250]  I've been listening to you for many years and I really enjoyed this Paul Revere contest that you put out.
[02:01:16.250 --> 02:01:22.735]  I've probably watched about a hundred of the films and I've enjoyed each and every single one of them.
[02:01:22.735 --> 02:01:31.701]  I just want to congratulate you on such a great effort and I'm really looking forward to see who wins this contest.

[02:01:33.869 --> 02:01:35.110]  Yes, I am, sir.
[02:01:35.110 --> 02:01:37.352]  I'm doing more Ted Nye, I apologize.
[02:01:37.352 --> 02:01:38.513]  Oh, Billy, Billy, Billy.
[02:01:38.513 --> 02:01:41.255]  Sir, have you seen Caddyshack?
[02:01:41.255 --> 02:01:41.756]  No, I have not.
[02:01:42.639 --> 02:01:46.220]  Probably a greater... Okay, I don't know, I get a goofy mood sometimes, I apologize.
[02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:48.060]  Probably a greater film than even The Godfather.
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:52.841]  Cinematic virtuoso of... Do you do drugs, Billy?
[02:01:52.841 --> 02:01:53.582]  I don't.
[02:01:53.582 --> 02:01:54.462]  That's good, Billy.
[02:01:54.462 --> 02:01:56.782]  Now, I'm gonna stop right there.
[02:01:56.782 --> 02:02:00.463]  No, this contest is incredible, Nick.
[02:02:00.463 --> 02:02:04.524]  And 600 plus entries, hundreds and hundreds of awesome ones.
[02:02:04.524 --> 02:02:06.204]  I don't know who to pick.
[02:02:06.204 --> 02:02:08.305]  In fact, maybe I should open the phones up for an hour Friday.
[02:02:09.245 --> 02:02:23.169]  I just wanted to say one thing.
[02:02:23.169 --> 02:02:29.571]  I saw the article posted yesterday about the finalists and some of them were just really high quality stuff.
[02:02:29.571 --> 02:02:33.352]  I watched some of them over actually because I saw them in the finalists.
[02:02:33.352 --> 02:02:38.273]  But I went down to the comments section and I saw a lot of people very angry about
[02:02:39.365 --> 02:02:45.520]  Uh, some of the selections for the finalists, mainly because they feel like some of the rules were broken to let these...
[02:02:46.499 --> 02:02:48.040]  People contend to be a finalist.
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:51.701]  I mean, every video is a good video and deserves respect.
[02:02:51.701 --> 02:02:58.704]  Yeah, but I mean, listen, listen, and the rules are, I'm going to pick whoever I want, and I'm going to pick people that I believe follow the rules.
[02:02:58.704 --> 02:03:04.606]  When you're watching 600 videos, I mean, you know, some people mention InfoWars, they don't show InfoWars.com.
[02:03:04.606 --> 02:03:06.867]  I mean, is that rule really broken?
[02:03:06.867 --> 02:03:11.789]  We just kind of had some basic rules to get the riffraff out to make sure it was good filmmakers.
[02:03:12.415 --> 02:03:12.876]  Yeah, I agree with you 100%.
[02:03:12.876 --> 02:03:14.117]  I mean, everybody's a winner at the end of the day.
[02:03:14.117 --> 02:03:16.941]  But, um, you know, there's people who put probably tons of money and effort and
[02:03:29.949 --> 02:03:31.650]  They're not a finalist.
[02:03:31.650 --> 02:03:32.951]  I mean, I don't know who should be the finalist.
[02:03:32.951 --> 02:03:34.212]  That's up for you guys to judge.
[02:03:34.212 --> 02:03:34.592]  Fine!
[02:03:34.592 --> 02:03:50.444]  Everyone's a finalist, but I'll pick... We're doing finalists to try to just focus in, and that's one reason I'm holding off the next Wednesday to announce the first place, because I want to go back into... We picked 35, and I think those are pretty much some of the best, but then there's other ones.
[02:03:51.044 --> 02:03:51.704]  Well, I agree with you 100%.
[02:03:51.704 --> 02:03:55.447]  Actually, I don't blame you for some of the confusion or whatnot, but I guess my question is,
[02:04:20.254 --> 02:04:27.843]  Uh, when you choose your finalists, is this going to be, I mean, when you choose the winners, is this going to be based solely off the finalists, or are you going to look through other ones?
[02:04:27.843 --> 02:04:30.386]  Because some people feel like they've been left out.
[02:04:30.386 --> 02:04:31.007]  Who is that?
[02:04:31.007 --> 02:04:32.549]  I mean, did you make a video?
[02:04:32.549 --> 02:04:33.170]  What is your video?
[02:04:34.056 --> 02:04:35.337]  I haven't made a video.
[02:04:35.337 --> 02:04:40.400]  I just read the comments yesterday and I was just like, you know, I couldn't believe some of the stuff I was hearing, you know?
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:41.922]  Well, people get mad.
[02:04:41.922 --> 02:04:43.102]  Plus, trolls go in there.
[02:04:43.102 --> 02:04:46.305]  And it's a nice site, the Paul Revere site.
[02:04:46.305 --> 02:04:48.046]  Infowars.com.org.slash.Paul.
[02:04:48.046 --> 02:04:49.947]  You can comment and rate and things.
[02:04:49.947 --> 02:04:54.410]  And, you know, people really think... Look, this is about fighting the New World Order.
[02:04:54.410 --> 02:04:55.731]  This isn't about winning the $100,000.
[02:04:55.731 --> 02:04:59.594]  They're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:05:01.257 --> 02:05:04.240]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:10.626]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[02:05:10.626 --> 02:05:17.013]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[02:05:17.433 --> 02:05:19.715]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[02:05:19.715 --> 02:05:21.056]  They're the good guys.

[02:06:01.121 --> 02:06:02.381]  What does freedom mean to you?
[02:06:02.381 --> 02:06:05.522]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[02:06:05.522 --> 02:06:09.323]  At eFoods Direct, we're again celebrating Food Freedom Month.
[02:06:09.323 --> 02:06:18.725]  In July, for every $329 you spend on our highly nutritious, great-tasting food, you will receive a $190 Patriot Pack free.
[02:06:18.725 --> 02:06:23.527]  For example, purchase a six-month supply and get three Patriot Packs free.
[02:06:23.527 --> 02:06:28.748]  The Patriot Pack is a 24-day supply of eFoods Quick-Fix, easy-to-store food
[02:06:31.783 --> 02:06:32.003]  I think so.
[02:07:00.698 --> 02:07:05.422]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:07:05.422 --> 02:07:08.524]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:07:08.524 --> 02:07:14.088]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:07:14.088 --> 02:07:16.029]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:07:16.029 --> 02:07:17.671]  We are what we eat.
[02:07:17.671 --> 02:07:22.334]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:07:22.334 --> 02:07:26.557]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:07:26.557 --> 02:07:28.819]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:07:29.099 --> 02:07:35.342]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[02:07:35.342 --> 02:07:38.304]  To learn more, visit InfoWarsHealth.com.

[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.721]  Make sure it's an original one you've made just for the site so you can share it.
[02:09:53.721 --> 02:09:55.722]  You don't want to have the same code to your bank account.
[02:09:55.722 --> 02:09:58.483]  So again, 11 memberships for $5.95 a month.
[02:09:58.483 --> 02:10:04.585]  Please become subscribers today and really vote with your dollars to get behind free speech.
[02:10:04.585 --> 02:10:10.488]  Now listen, I always had a sense of justice growing up and
[02:10:11.927 --> 02:10:18.212]  I, like all cultures, all groups, you know, I find it to be interesting, exciting.
[02:10:18.212 --> 02:10:23.136]  And I also studied a lot of history, so I know that the system uses divide and conquer to manipulate people.
[02:10:25.194 --> 02:10:27.536]  And they use tribalism, which is really the new racism.
[02:10:27.536 --> 02:10:39.305]  The globalists will play one African tribe off against another, or one English tribe off against a Scottish tribe, or Catholics off against Protestants, or Protestants off against Catholics, or Protestants off against Seventh-day Adventists, or on and on and on.
[02:10:39.305 --> 02:10:41.928]  People love to get in groups, love to get in gangs.
[02:10:41.928 --> 02:10:49.293]  But there was a Trent Leonard case about a year ago, where this guy, his only crime was being poor, because I know they take white
[02:10:50.668 --> 02:10:52.248]  People's kids when they're poor as well.
[02:10:52.248 --> 02:10:57.630]  He worked hard mowing yards in the area and as a maintenance man running a storage area.
[02:10:57.630 --> 02:11:02.591]  But they thought his home that he built there was not fancy enough.
[02:11:02.591 --> 02:11:04.631]  And they took his children.
[02:11:04.631 --> 02:11:09.272]  And I saw Quanell X covering it.
[02:11:09.272 --> 02:11:12.293]  The head of the new Black Panther Party there in Houston.
[02:11:12.293 --> 02:11:14.393]  One of the biggest chapters in the country and a national leader in it.
[02:11:15.663 --> 02:11:16.764]  And I went and looked up the case.
[02:11:16.764 --> 02:11:18.385]  I went and read about it in the Houston Chronicle.
[02:11:18.385 --> 02:11:19.045]  I went and checked it.
[02:11:19.045 --> 02:11:19.445]  It was true.
[02:11:19.445 --> 02:11:20.486]  They were persecuting this guy.
[02:11:20.486 --> 02:11:23.208]  And I would have come to his aid if it was brought to my attention.
[02:11:23.208 --> 02:11:27.450]  And it was admitted that CPS was saying being poor was a crime.
[02:11:27.450 --> 02:11:28.451]  And I came to the guy's aid.
[02:11:28.451 --> 02:11:31.112]  We raised money, and he got his kids back.
[02:11:31.112 --> 02:11:37.696]  And so it's not my job to get Quan LX on here and call him names, even though I don't agree with a lot of things he says.
[02:11:37.696 --> 02:11:40.138]  It's really to try to understand this.
[02:11:40.138 --> 02:11:44.901]  Because I could get a big crowd right now if I wanted to go say the things he's saying from a white perspective.
[02:11:45.669 --> 02:12:07.325]  And I gotta be honest, I mean, I see things being spouted by the white separatist groups that are basically what the black groups are saying, and at the end of the day, I see the Black Panther, the Black Panther group, I have a video of this, uh, you know, Zimmerman's a no good Jew, say Black Panthers out of Florida, and my whole issue is, really, so, so, you know, getting at this, why is it okay
[02:12:08.146 --> 02:12:08.446]  Yes.
[02:12:27.119 --> 02:12:31.763]  I get all that, but what does all of this division do to fix it?
[02:12:45.413 --> 02:12:56.638]  Also, you know, the regular black leaders say, hey, take our kids, put us in prison, feed on us, you know, food to the government, have all the forced abortions, you know, where they pressure people into having abortions, sterilize black women.
[02:12:56.638 --> 02:12:58.539]  That's going on in California right now.
[02:12:58.539 --> 02:13:00.960]  And then the white liberals go, well, there are too many black people.
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:03.021]  My whole issue is that's the real racism.
[02:13:04.441 --> 02:13:11.105]  But and so I hear a lot of stuff I disagree from the new Black Panther Party, but then I hear things that I agree coming out of them.
[02:13:11.105 --> 02:13:15.028]  So I want to get to the bottom of this with us with our guest today.
[02:13:15.028 --> 02:13:17.069]  He's going to be here till about 50 after.
[02:13:17.069 --> 02:13:18.270]  Then I'll take some calls.
[02:13:18.270 --> 02:13:20.451]  But Quan LX, thank you for coming on the broadcast today.
[02:13:21.269 --> 02:13:22.930]  And thank you for having me, Mr. Jones.
[02:13:22.930 --> 02:13:27.211]  I want to greet you and your listening audience in the greeting words of peace, the bustle of Lincoln.
[02:13:27.211 --> 02:13:29.812]  Those words simply mean, may peace be unto you.
[02:13:29.812 --> 02:13:32.632]  And I am the National Leader of the New Black Panther.
[02:13:32.632 --> 02:13:33.713]  Okay, so you're the National Leader.
[02:13:33.713 --> 02:13:36.214]  I want to be clear, so I apologize for getting that wrong.
[02:13:36.214 --> 02:13:37.414]  Can you speak right on your telephone?
[02:13:37.414 --> 02:13:41.055]  It's a little bit low.
[02:13:41.055 --> 02:13:44.896]  I am the National Leader of the New Black Panther Nation.
[02:13:44.896 --> 02:13:50.818]  I split with the New Black Panther Party several years back, and I'm the National Leader of the New Black Panther Nation.
[02:13:51.636 --> 02:13:53.078]  Okay, so it's the new Black Panther Nation.
[02:13:53.078 --> 02:13:53.418]  Great.
[02:13:53.418 --> 02:13:54.740]  I'm sorry I got that wrong.
[02:13:54.740 --> 02:13:56.282]  I've got several bios here.
[02:13:56.282 --> 02:13:58.265]  Break down your take on Zimmerman.
[02:13:58.265 --> 02:13:59.967]  Where do you think this is going?
[02:13:59.967 --> 02:14:02.851]  The armed march yesterday and both sides.
[02:14:02.851 --> 02:14:04.613]  What was happening there?
[02:14:04.613 --> 02:14:07.858]  Let me put this entire Zimmerman case in context.
[02:14:09.205 --> 02:14:15.331]  Was Zimmerman attempting to do something good in his community by being a neighborhood watchman?
[02:14:15.331 --> 02:14:16.252]  Yes.
[02:14:16.252 --> 02:14:20.636]  Was he doing something good by volunteering people who had their homes broken into?
[02:14:20.636 --> 02:14:24.860]  His phone number, you can call me or my wife if you need assistance or help.
[02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:25.740]  Yes.
[02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:30.865]  Was he attempting to do something good with some children that he may have mentored that he didn't mentor?
[02:14:30.865 --> 02:14:31.686]  Absolutely.
[02:14:32.637 --> 02:14:38.581]  But did he do something wrong and bad on that night that he encountered Trayvon Martin?
[02:14:38.581 --> 02:14:40.202]  Absolutely he did.
[02:14:40.202 --> 02:14:42.864]  Trayvon Martin had a right to go home.
[02:14:42.864 --> 02:14:44.725]  He was not breaking any laws.
[02:14:44.725 --> 02:14:46.286]  He was committing no crimes.
[02:14:46.286 --> 02:14:53.810]  There's no evidence anywhere to support or suggest he was committing any crimes that night that he was walking home.
[02:14:53.810 --> 02:14:59.414]  Zimmerman racially profiled, some would say profiled, but I believe racially profiled Trayvon Martin.
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:05.241]  Before he ever spoke to Trayvon Martin, he called him an effing hunk, an effing thug.
[02:15:05.241 --> 02:15:07.022]  They always get away with it.
[02:15:07.022 --> 02:15:14.943]  So he got out of his vehicle with a preconceived mindset that he was going to approach a thug and a criminal.
[02:15:14.943 --> 02:15:18.804]  This young man, that night going home, was neither.
[02:15:18.804 --> 02:15:21.825]  The young man was walking with Skittles and
[02:15:22.538 --> 02:15:24.259]  A can of Arizona tea.
[02:15:24.259 --> 02:15:26.460]  That he's going back to his home.
[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:27.940]  You have a right, Mr. Jones.
[02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:30.801]  I have a right, and every citizen in this country.
[02:15:30.801 --> 02:15:38.265]  If we're not breaking the law, our children have a right to walk home not being profiled or accosted.
[02:15:38.265 --> 02:15:42.006]  And I believe that George Zimmerman was the pursuer.
[02:15:42.006 --> 02:15:47.968]  He was the one doing the stalking, and he was the one who already had his mind made up when he approached Trayvon Martin.
[02:15:47.968 --> 02:15:48.949]  I do not believe
[02:15:49.605 --> 02:15:53.915]  That Mr. Zimmerman had to kill Trayvon Martin that night.
[02:15:53.915 --> 02:15:56.140]  And if he felt Trayvon Martin was a threat...
[02:15:56.798 --> 02:15:59.981]  Well, then wait until the police get there and do their job.
[02:15:59.981 --> 02:16:05.526]  Now, if you're protecting a neighbor and he's committing a crime and you use your firearm, that's a different story.
[02:16:05.526 --> 02:16:11.432]  But there was no crime being committed, so there was no need for him to approach that young man.
[02:16:11.432 --> 02:16:14.735]  But he said he looked suspicious, looked like he's on drugs.
[02:16:14.735 --> 02:16:16.676]  I don't think he belongs around here.
[02:16:16.676 --> 02:16:21.501]  Those are the racial stereotypes that we believe played a significant role in the Zimmerman case.
[02:16:23.979 --> 02:16:29.883]  Again, the national leader of the New Black Panther Party Nation, Quanell X, is joining us.
[02:16:29.883 --> 02:16:35.948]  He led a big demonstration in Houston yesterday, and we're trying to get his perspective on this.
[02:16:35.948 --> 02:16:39.591]  Pulling back, though, what do you think Obama's doing?
[02:16:40.732 --> 02:16:41.293]  This whole case.
[02:16:41.293 --> 02:16:45.117]  I mean, undoubtedly, the Justice Department went down there, tried to skirt things up.
[02:16:45.117 --> 02:16:46.359]  It's a tragedy.
[02:16:46.359 --> 02:16:47.921]  I don't think we know what really happened.
[02:16:47.921 --> 02:16:49.102]  That's why he was found not guilty.
[02:16:49.102 --> 02:16:50.324]  There's reasonable doubt.
[02:16:50.324 --> 02:16:52.326]  From my perspective, Jimmy Carter has said that.
[02:16:52.326 --> 02:16:54.208]  I don't think he said it because he's racist.
[02:16:54.208 --> 02:16:56.591]  I think he said it because he actually followed the trial.
[02:16:56.591 --> 02:16:58.233]  But I think they chose this case
[02:16:59.130 --> 02:17:06.014]  Because it is debatable, I believe, from both sides, to create a political diversion.
[02:17:06.014 --> 02:17:07.395]  Now, that's my take on it.
[02:17:07.395 --> 02:17:12.018]  What do you think, in a larger context, is going on here?
[02:17:12.018 --> 02:17:20.723]  I have listened to everything that the President said and has addressed to the nation in regards to the Trayvon Martin case.
[02:17:20.723 --> 02:17:23.765]  And I agree he said some valuable things.
[02:17:23.765 --> 02:17:24.866]  I can appreciate that.
[02:17:25.743 --> 02:17:31.085]  But he did not say the one thing I was hoping that he would say.
[02:17:31.085 --> 02:17:33.726]  Not one African American leader.
[02:17:33.726 --> 02:17:42.609]  None of my brothers and sisters, from community activists, to congressmen, to leaders of organizations, etc.
[02:17:42.609 --> 02:17:47.731]  None of them asked Obama to do one thing.
[02:17:47.731 --> 02:17:54.254]  I asked the President of the United States of America, since there's a great controversy in the Zimmerman case,
[02:17:55.026 --> 02:18:12.714]  Of whose voice it was screaming on that 911 call, I'm asking President Obama to bring in your very best voice analyzers that you have working in the CIA and the Pentagon and give the American people the answer.
[02:18:12.714 --> 02:18:19.177]  Because the court may have not been able to conclude it, the judge may have not known, the prosecutors and defense may differ on that.
[02:18:19.557 --> 02:18:30.985]  But I believe that the super counterintelligence program in America's government has the ability to tell everybody who's voice that was screaming on that 9-1-1 tape.
[02:18:30.985 --> 02:18:40.731]  If we could determine who that was screaming, I think that would solve a whole lot of the pain that's out here right now behind this verdict involving George Zimmerman.
[02:18:41.337 --> 02:18:50.504]  See, when I have you on, you sound reasonable, and then I see quotes attributed to you, saying some pretty radical things.
[02:18:50.504 --> 02:18:58.811]  What is your view in general, Quan LX, on white people and black folks in this country?
[02:18:58.811 --> 02:19:06.617]  Because my issue is, there's a whole world out there of other things going on, and why do you think the media loves to obsess on race all day?
[02:19:07.276 --> 02:19:14.779]  If you would like to take me to task on something that you have read that I have said, I offer you to please do so.
[02:19:14.779 --> 02:19:18.080]  I'm not going to run and hide from anything that I've said.
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:21.921]  Because I'm a man who means what he says and says exactly what he means.
[02:19:21.921 --> 02:19:24.262]  Okay, but I mean, you know some of those controversial statements.
[02:19:24.262 --> 02:19:28.784]  Do you think white people are inherently more corrupt and evil than other groups?
[02:19:29.835 --> 02:19:35.644]  I believe that the mindset of white supremacy is inherently evil.
[02:19:35.644 --> 02:19:43.036]  I also believe the mindset of black self-destruction and black self-inferiority is evil.
[02:19:43.036 --> 02:19:45.179]  A skin color don't make a man evil.
[02:19:45.814 --> 02:19:52.817]  Skin color can't make a woman evil, because you and all the I's can control what skin color we're born into this world.
[02:19:52.817 --> 02:19:57.940]  So for any human being to behave strictly on their skin color is ignorance and foolishness.
[02:19:57.940 --> 02:20:10.086]  But if your mindset is that you are better because you're white, or you're better because you're black, or you're inferior because you're white, or you're inferior because you're black, well there's something wrong with that ignominious mindset.
[02:20:10.526 --> 02:20:18.433]  The problem in America, the number one enemy of white people and the number one enemy of black people in this nation is ignorance.
[02:20:18.433 --> 02:20:25.380]  And we are not willing to try to eradicate ignorance by any means necessary, both black and white.
[02:20:25.380 --> 02:20:26.441]  Most white people
[02:20:27.546 --> 02:20:30.388]  Sometimes they're racist and don't even know it.
[02:20:30.388 --> 02:20:38.055]  But it's not because they hate black people, it's because they're ignorant to exactly what they're saying, what they're doing, what they've been taught.
[02:20:38.055 --> 02:20:49.023]  It's the same thing- Yeah, but doesn't MSNBC hyping this stuff up actually create more, not even racism, but more of just paranoia on all sides?
[02:20:49.023 --> 02:20:54.088]  I would say MSNBC have the right to do exactly what they're doing.
[02:20:54.088 --> 02:20:56.089]  And I don't watch a lot of MSNBC.
[02:20:57.458 --> 02:21:03.484]  Because some of the commentary and some of what they say, I'm very uncomfortable with.
[02:21:03.484 --> 02:21:08.509]  But I don't watch a lot of Fox News, because I'm just as uncomfortable with that.
[02:21:08.509 --> 02:21:12.493]  I respectfully state to you, Mr. Jones, Fox News
[02:21:13.115 --> 02:21:21.202]  CNN, MSNBC, none of them are willing to speak the wrong, unadulterated truth to the American people.
[02:21:21.202 --> 02:21:29.309]  So, I can't be a big fan of neither one of them because none of them are willing to let people tell and speak the truth.
[02:21:29.309 --> 02:21:36.355]  They bring people on to the show that will bring calm to the situation, that won't rock the boat.
[02:21:36.935 --> 02:21:42.599]  But I see the boat of ignorance in America needs to have a hold, not get it not just rocked.
[02:21:42.599 --> 02:21:44.140]  But none of them are willing to do it.
[02:21:44.140 --> 02:21:44.921]  Let's be honest.
[02:21:44.921 --> 02:21:46.322]  Well, I mean, here's my issue.
[02:21:46.322 --> 02:21:48.984]  We're overrun by foreign megabanks.
[02:21:48.984 --> 02:21:51.766]  Our government's funding Al-Qaeda to take over all these countries.
[02:21:51.766 --> 02:21:55.829]  They're spiking the water with poison on record to dumb everybody down.
[02:21:55.829 --> 02:21:59.131]  White folks don't get a memo saying, don't drink the fluoride water.
[02:21:59.131 --> 02:22:00.893]  And it's 100% meant to hurt us.
[02:22:00.893 --> 02:22:01.893]  There's government documents.
[02:22:01.893 --> 02:22:02.774]  It's on record.
[02:22:02.774 --> 02:22:03.815]  Harvard studies, you name it.
[02:22:04.315 --> 02:22:13.020]  And then instead I see the very establishment injecting race, race, race, then claiming they want to clean up the problem.
[02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:17.743]  I put forward that the obsession on all this race issue
[02:22:19.256 --> 02:22:21.478]  is meant to actually keep it going.
[02:22:21.478 --> 02:22:23.400]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:25.101]  This has been confirmed by Gateway Pundit.
[02:22:25.101 --> 02:22:27.003]  We've confirmed it right here in Austin.
[02:22:27.003 --> 02:22:33.028]  We have an article, false flag, leftists run false flag against George Zimmerman up on InfoWars.com.
[02:22:33.028 --> 02:22:35.250]  And I don't have a dog in this fight, I'm just looking for the truth.
[02:22:35.250 --> 02:22:41.596]  Left-wing plant at Houston pro-Zimmerman rally is far-left activist that works for a federally funded environmental group.
[02:22:42.336 --> 02:22:47.639]  Uh, saying we're racist and proud, and she ran around trying to stir up the black crowd there.
[02:22:47.639 --> 02:23:03.106]  Now, now, now, what do you say about not white people that are paranoid of black folks, they don't hate them, they're just scared because of the media, or black folks that think all the whites are out to get them, so then they're paranoid, it kind of creates the self-fulfilling prophecy, and you got real racist out there as well.
[02:23:03.106 --> 02:23:06.488]  What do you say to that special type, the liberal, trendy,
[02:23:07.428 --> 02:23:09.549]  Let me tell you this.
[02:23:09.549 --> 02:23:12.989]  The Honorable Elijah Muhammad taught us that you cannot fathom the depths of the devil.
[02:23:36.878 --> 02:23:44.381]  We really have been so deceived by the government of the United States.
[02:23:44.381 --> 02:23:58.707]  Many of us can't even fathom to what depths these people will go to to manipulate the masses of the ignorant people who are not well-informed and well-learned and well-read.
[02:23:58.707 --> 02:24:04.450]  See, nobody wants to talk about what role does the Bilderberg Group play.
[02:24:05.510 --> 02:24:08.812]  And what's happening inside of America and around the world.
[02:24:08.812 --> 02:24:20.617]  But if you can keep petty common white people and petty common black people misguided looking at each other, we're not looking at what's really behind all of this.
[02:24:20.617 --> 02:24:24.739]  Do I doubt that there was a plant at that particular march?
[02:24:24.739 --> 02:24:26.800]  It wasn't a plant just on that side.
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:29.081]  There were plants on both sides.
[02:24:29.081 --> 02:24:31.682]  There were people there who were marching with us.
[02:24:32.504 --> 02:24:39.868]  I had to check because they were attempting to create a confrontation because they had a different agenda.
[02:24:39.868 --> 02:24:53.015]  But I was already warned by my officers that potentially the government and law enforcement would have people planted among us pretending to be protesters with a hidden platform and a hidden agenda.
[02:24:53.015 --> 02:24:58.778]  So I don't doubt it at all, but I asked the American people, both black and white,
[02:25:00.293 --> 02:25:03.834]  What are you willing to sacrifice to really expose the truth?
[02:25:03.834 --> 02:25:22.542]  If you're not willing to sacrifice that pretty home that you have in the suburbs, and that job that you have, and your only one paycheck away from poverty, if you're not willing to give up something to expose the truth, to free the minds of both black and white in this country, we are not going to be successful.
[02:25:22.542 --> 02:25:26.104]  I'm going to eradicate that myth that Guantel X hates white people.
[02:25:26.104 --> 02:25:26.944]  That's a lie!
[02:25:28.075 --> 02:25:33.277]  Okay, well since you raised that, since you raised that, finish your point, sorry.
[02:25:33.277 --> 02:25:44.660]  But what I do hate is how white people have not been willing to go to war to tell black people the truth.
[02:25:44.660 --> 02:25:54.003]  White people who have been in power and are still currently in power have not been willing to expose other white people who have gotten rich.
[02:25:55.194 --> 02:25:55.775]  I don't know.
[02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:11.806]  Well, sure, but I mean, look, the average white person, just like the average Hispanic or black person or Asian, I know, they just want to go to work, get their money, go home, watch TV.
[02:26:11.806 --> 02:26:14.687]  They don't even know what planet they're on.
[02:26:14.687 --> 02:26:22.512]  And instead, the liberal media that's not liberal at all is just race, race, race, where people are like, man, I'm sick of hearing about this.
[02:26:22.512 --> 02:26:28.115]  But listen, expanding on this, since you raise it, because I'm not here to attack you, I'm here to understand these statements.
[02:26:28.115 --> 02:26:31.057]  Or I've had media put stuff out and say that I've said it before.
[02:26:31.897 --> 02:26:33.418]  But I didn't say it.
[02:26:33.418 --> 02:26:43.581]  But reportedly, you were quoted by the New York Daily News as saying, I say to Jewish America, get ready, knuckle up, put your boots on because we're ready and war is going down.
[02:26:43.581 --> 02:26:51.423]  The real deal is, black youth do not want a relationship with the Jewish community or the mainstream white community or the foot shuffling.
[02:26:51.423 --> 02:26:54.484]  Well, I mean, look at, Al Sharpton has been given a job at MSNBC.
[02:26:54.484 --> 02:26:57.585]  Head-bowing, knee-bobbing black community.
[02:26:57.585 --> 02:26:59.606]  All you Jews, go straight to hell.
[02:27:00.286 --> 02:27:01.707]  Here's another one you reportedly said.
[02:27:01.707 --> 02:27:12.076]  If you feel that you just got to mug somebody because you're hurt and you're in pain, go to River Oaks and mug you some white folks.
[02:27:12.076 --> 02:27:16.560]  If you're angry that your brother is put to death, don't burn down your own community.
[02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:20.423]  Give these white folks hell from the womb to the tomb.
[02:27:20.423 --> 02:27:24.586]  Now are those statements out of context or what do you mean by those?
[02:27:24.586 --> 02:27:26.308]  And let me explain both of them.
[02:27:27.031 --> 02:27:43.462]  The comment that I made in 1995 as the National Youth Minister of the Nation of Islam, what I said was we were holding a black holocaust convention in Washington DC in October of 1995.
[02:27:43.462 --> 02:27:49.706]  There were Jewish people outside marching against us using the term holocaust.
[02:27:50.589 --> 02:28:03.717]  And they felt that we did not have the right to apply the term Holocaust to the transatlantic slave trade and the genocidal practice of what happened in the rest in the Middle Passage during slavery.
[02:28:03.717 --> 02:28:07.340]  And they were saying, death to Farrakhan, death to Farrakhan.
[02:28:07.340 --> 02:28:11.622]  This was a day before the Million Man March.
[02:28:11.622 --> 02:28:17.386]  And what I said was that if those Jews outside protesting
[02:28:18.234 --> 02:28:21.936]  We cannot respect the black holocaust.
[02:28:21.936 --> 02:28:24.418]  Why should we respect theirs?
[02:28:24.418 --> 02:28:37.687]  If they can't respect the suffering of black people, and many more millions died in the transatlantic slave trade, and they want us to respect their suffering but won't respect ours, I say to hell with those Jews.
[02:28:37.687 --> 02:28:39.768]  Guard your grill, knuckle up.
[02:28:39.768 --> 02:28:43.110]  Put your boots on, because the war is going down.
[02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:45.852]  And I stand by that to this day.
[02:28:46.778 --> 02:28:51.801]  That if you cannot respect another people's suffering, but demand that we respect yours.
[02:28:51.801 --> 02:28:53.182]  That's racism.
[02:28:53.182 --> 02:28:54.963]  That's insensitivity.
[02:28:54.963 --> 02:28:57.325]  Suffering is suffering no matter who the people is.
[02:28:57.325 --> 02:28:59.566]  If it's legitimate suffering, we respect it.
[02:28:59.566 --> 02:29:05.110]  I mean, undoubtedly, a lot more black people died in the transatlantic slave trade than were killed in World War II total.
[02:29:05.110 --> 02:29:07.492]  I mean, you have to understand, though, it's a terrible thing.
[02:29:08.212 --> 02:29:13.719]  On average, about 90% of the sailors after three or more missions died as well.
[02:29:13.719 --> 02:29:21.649]  And did you know most of the sailors were actually white slaves on press gangs, stolen from their homes in England, and put on those ships?
[02:29:21.649 --> 02:29:22.730]  Did you know that, Quanell X?
[02:29:23.411 --> 02:29:30.618]  I do know that, and what we also know to be a fact is that three quarters of the slave cargo never made it to America.
[02:29:30.618 --> 02:29:34.701]  Three quarters because of disease and malnutrition were thrown overboard.
[02:29:34.701 --> 02:29:36.203]  Yeah, and the sharks followed.
[02:29:36.203 --> 02:29:38.124]  Yeah, some numbers are half, some numbers are two-thirds.
[02:29:38.124 --> 02:29:43.790]  So we're talking about three quarters of at least 50 million that were brought across that mill.
[02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:46.292]  Yeah, it's definitely in the millions and millions.
[02:29:46.292 --> 02:29:47.533]  They're not sure historically.
[02:29:47.533 --> 02:29:48.194]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:48.194 --> 02:29:49.455]  I want to hear more about this with you.
[02:29:50.339 --> 02:29:54.267]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.267 --> 02:29:56.953]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.939 --> 02:30:04.801]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:30:04.801 --> 02:30:10.324]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:30:10.324 --> 02:30:18.048]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:30:18.048 --> 02:30:27.173]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:30:27.353 --> 02:30:34.520]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:37.422]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:30:37.422 --> 02:30:43.368]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[02:30:44.068 --> 02:30:44.629]  War.
[02:30:44.629 --> 02:30:45.950]  Oh, there's another one!
[02:30:45.950 --> 02:30:47.211]  Another plane just hit!
[02:30:47.211 --> 02:30:48.292]  State of Mind.
[02:30:48.292 --> 02:30:49.853]  Because there's a war on.
[02:30:49.853 --> 02:30:50.894]  For your mind.

[02:33:11.181 --> 02:33:15.282]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:15.282 --> 02:33:20.083]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.083 --> 02:33:22.284]  Well, folks, I don't have any hidden agendas.
[02:33:22.284 --> 02:33:23.204]  I think that's pretty clear.
[02:33:23.204 --> 02:33:26.025]  I can't even control what I say on air.
[02:33:26.025 --> 02:33:29.225]  My agenda is that I believe what comes around goes around.
[02:33:29.225 --> 02:33:31.366]  You reap what you sow.
[02:33:31.366 --> 02:33:32.626]  You call it karma, whatever.
[02:33:32.626 --> 02:33:34.947]  You don't get away with stuff.
[02:33:34.947 --> 02:33:35.087]  And
[02:33:37.512 --> 02:33:48.705]  It is not taught in all the Steven Spielberg movies that one big reason for the Revolutionary War was the press gangs and pressmen, where on average it was five to ten years of slavery.
[02:33:49.713 --> 02:33:51.954]  They would drag you along the bottom of the boat and kill you.
[02:33:51.954 --> 02:33:52.634]  They'd whip you.
[02:33:52.634 --> 02:33:54.795]  And it's bad for doing it to a black guy.
[02:33:54.795 --> 02:33:57.477]  It's bad for doing it to a white guy.
[02:33:57.477 --> 02:34:04.540]  The point is that the Spanish galleys would grab other sailors and put them as slaves in the bottom to work them to death.
[02:34:04.540 --> 02:34:06.221]  This is what barbarism was.
[02:34:06.221 --> 02:34:07.461]  And it still goes on.
[02:34:07.461 --> 02:34:10.803]  And the last group that it was okay to do it to was black people, and that's terrible.
[02:34:12.128 --> 02:34:21.066]  But I think there's this attempt to create dependency and this idea that, well, I can't ever be successful because of, you know, I come from slaves.
[02:34:21.066 --> 02:34:22.609]  I mean, almost everybody comes from slaves.
[02:34:24.566 --> 02:34:32.635]  And it's a ignorance of history that's pushed, and you notice we have the leader, the national leader of the new Black Panther Party nation on with us.
[02:34:32.635 --> 02:34:39.642]  I want to give you the floor for the rest of this segment, because you had some points you wanted to make about so-called liberal media.
[02:34:39.642 --> 02:34:46.750]  By the way, the woman who went out there with a sign saying, we're racist and proud that the AP and MSNBC ran with, she now says it was a joke.
[02:34:47.540 --> 02:34:48.100]  Yeah, I don't.
[02:34:48.100 --> 02:34:50.082]  You got caught in the false flag there.
[02:34:50.082 --> 02:34:53.104]  And our article detailing that is on Infowars.com.
[02:34:53.104 --> 02:35:05.752]  But Quan Al, just so we can understand this, what happened with you and the new Black Panther Party, and then of course I've had members of the original Black Panther Party on who are very critical of the new Black Panther Party, what is the difference?
[02:35:05.752 --> 02:35:09.375]  I always hear about you, is your group becoming bigger?
[02:35:09.375 --> 02:35:11.256]  Explain to us why you had a split.
[02:35:11.256 --> 02:35:17.360]  Because I got to tell you, I see some of these new Black Panther Party people and the stuff they say and do, and they act like plants.
[02:35:18.100 --> 02:35:22.324]  I've proven a lot of white supremacists are actually feds, like Hal Turner and others.
[02:35:22.324 --> 02:35:30.409]  And I gotta say, a lot of the new Black Panther Party people, I mean, there's no way they're saying and doing these things on their own.
[02:35:30.409 --> 02:35:35.974]  It's scripted to make them sound like idiots, in my opinion.
[02:35:35.974 --> 02:35:46.061]  Let me say what the real issue is here with African-American leadership, including the revolutionary wing of the movement.
[02:35:48.226 --> 02:35:54.929]  We must be consistent in our call and application of justice.
[02:35:54.929 --> 02:36:04.033]  We cannot, we cannot point out the evil of what white people do, what some white person has done.
[02:36:04.033 --> 02:36:13.977]  But we are not willing to use that same platform, that same energy for the evil that's being carried out by us, on us.
[02:36:13.977 --> 02:36:15.878]  And that was my disagreement
[02:36:16.584 --> 02:36:19.987]  With the original leadership of the new Black Panther Party.
[02:36:19.987 --> 02:36:20.767]  I love them.
[02:36:20.767 --> 02:36:23.329]  Those are my brothers and my sisters.
[02:36:23.329 --> 02:36:28.113]  But we cannot put a $10,000 bounty on George Zimmerman!
[02:36:29.011 --> 02:36:37.713]  But we would not put a $10,000 bounty on men that's raping young black children and kidnapping and abducting young black children!
[02:36:37.713 --> 02:36:45.314]  We are not willing to put a $10,000 bounty on a man that is a serial rapist of black women!
[02:36:45.314 --> 02:36:52.095]  If we got $10,000, and we don't need a body for George Zimmerman, black people will go after him for free!
[02:36:52.095 --> 02:36:56.416]  But if we're gonna spend $10,000 on a bounty on the head of somebody,
[02:36:57.116 --> 02:37:06.998]  There are black men right now who are in our community who are doing things ten times worse than what George Zimmerman has ever done or can do.
[02:37:06.998 --> 02:37:19.121]  And so if we're going to point out the evil of people like George Zimmerman and the wrong of him, we've got to be wrong if not louder when that enemy looks like us and comes from among our community.
[02:37:19.121 --> 02:37:20.641]  That's my problem with us.
[02:37:21.644 --> 02:37:28.251]  We must be consistent on the principles of truth or God will remove his hand from us!
[02:37:28.251 --> 02:37:32.336]  And he will not assist us nor help us in what we are trying to do.
[02:37:32.336 --> 02:37:33.617]  So that's my position.
[02:37:33.617 --> 02:37:36.080]  Those are the real differences.
[02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:39.183]  We must be just as diligent, man.
[02:37:39.183 --> 02:37:42.727]  And I don't see that happening, but I've tried to be consistent in that.
[02:37:43.992 --> 02:37:52.439]  I've held more rallies in Texas and in Louisiana against black-on-black crime than any other African American leader in this region.
[02:37:52.439 --> 02:37:55.081]  In fact, check your facts, Alex Jones.
[02:37:55.081 --> 02:38:00.765]  I've turned more black men in off the street for killing other black people into jail.
[02:38:03.055 --> 02:38:10.842]  If any other black leader in America, I've solved more on black murders in this country than any other black leader in America.
[02:38:10.842 --> 02:38:18.409]  So if I was anti-white and only pro-black, why am I taking black men off the streets who are killing other black people?
[02:38:19.847 --> 02:38:26.212]  Let me ask you this question, because you wanted to get into the so-called leftist media, and you were saying some interesting things during the break, so I'd like you to repeat those.
[02:38:26.212 --> 02:38:30.055]  You got pretty hot when you were talking about it, and I understand why.
[02:38:30.055 --> 02:38:35.840]  Why do you think there was less black illegitimacy pre-civil rights movement than whites?
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:39.142]  There were more whites with single-parent families than there were blacks.
[02:38:39.142 --> 02:38:47.509]  How did the numbers completely flip where now 94% of blacks that are murdered since 1976 are killed by other blacks?
[02:38:48.567 --> 02:38:49.468]  Why?
[02:38:49.468 --> 02:38:50.528]  What happened?
[02:38:50.528 --> 02:38:54.771]  What was done in your view?
[02:38:54.771 --> 02:39:01.615]  The Honorable Elijah Muhammad taught us that integration was a hypocritical trick.
[02:39:01.615 --> 02:39:07.738]  We as African Americans really did need to fight for social integration the way that we did.
[02:39:07.738 --> 02:39:10.940]  Morally, it was the right thing to do, yes.
[02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:14.242]  But strategically, it was not the wisest thing to do.
[02:39:15.265 --> 02:39:19.907]  Because morally, we should all be one race and one human family.
[02:39:19.907 --> 02:39:24.110]  But strategically, that was not the living reality in America for black people.
[02:39:24.110 --> 02:39:38.577]  Do you realize, Alex, that during segregation, we built black hospitals, we built black banks, we had black transportation companies, black hotels and motels, black insurance agencies, we had black loan companies during segregation.
[02:39:38.577 --> 02:39:40.958]  We were building and establishing black universities.
[02:39:42.287 --> 02:39:47.968]  And the big mega banks saw that, just like they bombed Libya or Syria or any other sovereign nation.
[02:39:47.968 --> 02:39:49.708]  That's right, blacks were getting rich.
[02:40:14.415 --> 02:40:17.698]  We had to integrate to give the money back to them.
[02:40:17.698 --> 02:40:22.381]  Integration, the way it was done, was not done correctly.
[02:40:22.381 --> 02:40:24.603]  We didn't need social integration.
[02:40:24.603 --> 02:40:28.046]  All we needed was some real financial integration in America.
[02:40:28.046 --> 02:40:31.168]  And I guarantee you, everybody would have wanted to get with us.
[02:40:32.901 --> 02:40:34.082]  No, I mean, you're absolutely right.
[02:40:34.082 --> 02:40:35.703]  Look, it sounds good.
[02:40:35.703 --> 02:40:37.204]  You'll have women all going to the workforce.
[02:40:37.204 --> 02:40:39.165]  Well, if a woman wants to, sure.
[02:40:39.165 --> 02:40:40.706]  But it's declassified.
[02:40:40.706 --> 02:40:48.411]  The whole suffrage movement was run by the Department of War to get women in there so they could tax them and have the state raise the children.
[02:40:48.411 --> 02:40:49.011]  A fact.
[02:40:49.011 --> 02:40:49.592]  Sounds great.
[02:40:50.532 --> 02:40:52.193]  And if women want to work, that's wonderful.
[02:40:52.193 --> 02:41:01.640]  The point is they force the economy now where a woman's got to work or somebody's, you know, both have to work regardless of whether somebody wants to stay home or not.
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:03.201]  And in that is the secret.
[02:41:03.201 --> 02:41:07.083]  Globalism does not want you to spend your money in your community.
[02:41:07.083 --> 02:41:09.765]  They want it going to them for control.
[02:41:10.325 --> 02:41:10.525]  That's
[02:41:29.244 --> 02:41:32.826]  The coldest move, the coldest move next to slavery that white liberals did in America
[02:41:58.046 --> 02:41:58.726]  We're good to go.
[02:42:18.146 --> 02:42:22.209]  We didn't even need that kind of welfare program during segregation.
[02:42:22.209 --> 02:42:24.431]  You rarely... I was a young boy.
[02:42:24.431 --> 02:42:31.176]  I'm 42 years old, but I remember as a child, I never saw a homeless black person in my community.
[02:42:31.176 --> 02:42:33.238]  Everybody fed everybody.
[02:42:33.238 --> 02:42:40.323]  And when somebody died, black women would go door to door and get money from everybody in the neighborhood to bury that person.
[02:42:40.323 --> 02:42:41.944]  We didn't need no death insurance.
[02:42:41.944 --> 02:42:43.605]  You call life insurance.
[02:42:43.605 --> 02:42:44.746]  Nobody was homeless.
[02:42:44.746 --> 02:42:45.727]  Everybody fed.
[02:42:45.727 --> 02:42:46.848]  We fed one another.
[02:42:47.288 --> 02:42:49.909]  But they brought up the welfare program.
[02:42:49.909 --> 02:42:51.529]  And look at the word welfare.
[02:42:51.529 --> 02:42:52.910]  Turn the word around.
[02:42:52.910 --> 02:42:59.031]  It means farewell to being the independent people you once were and you will be becoming.
[02:42:59.031 --> 02:43:03.152]  And so they told black women, I'm a product of the welfare program in America.
[02:43:03.152 --> 02:43:05.533]  We were on welfare for years.
[02:43:05.533 --> 02:43:07.174]  And I know what it did.
[02:43:07.174 --> 02:43:10.815]  I remember as a young boy, the welfare workers would come by the house.
[02:43:10.815 --> 02:43:14.116]  They would ask my mother, are you dating anyone?
[02:43:14.116 --> 02:43:15.776]  Have you seen the children's father?
[02:43:16.667 --> 02:43:18.969]  Has he brought anything to them?
[02:43:18.969 --> 02:43:20.510]  Do you have any gifts that he's brought?
[02:43:20.510 --> 02:43:21.670]  Has he paid for anything?
[02:43:21.670 --> 02:43:30.276]  Well, you know if you accept any gifts from him, or he gives you any money and you don't report it, we'll cut you off and you'll lose all your benefits.
[02:43:30.276 --> 02:43:43.024]  But my auntie will allow their baby after baby after baby, as long as they had no man in the home and no man involved, they will continue to receive those benefits.
[02:43:43.024 --> 02:43:45.366]  That's reduced a whole people
[02:43:46.556 --> 02:43:51.839]  For four decades with the mindset of codependency and guilty independent spirit.
[02:43:51.839 --> 02:43:54.541]  No black woman, no black woman in America should ever go to Planned Parenthood.
[02:44:15.811 --> 02:44:19.277]  But I am a supporter of the right of choice, Alex.
[02:44:19.277 --> 02:44:21.641]  Choose who you're going to lay down with.
[02:44:21.641 --> 02:44:23.844]  That's your biggest right of choice.
[02:44:23.844 --> 02:44:29.053]  Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, was a believer in eugenics and extermination.
[02:44:33.528 --> 02:44:36.933]  I'm telling you, I've been at the liberal meetings.
[02:44:36.933 --> 02:44:38.355]  I've been at the liberal meetings.
[02:44:38.355 --> 02:44:41.640]  These are the most racist people on earth.
[02:44:41.640 --> 02:44:42.822]  I mean, it is incredible.
[02:44:42.822 --> 02:44:47.909]  And I've even talked to their black operatives and they know it and say there are too many black people.
[02:44:47.909 --> 02:44:49.511]  And again, my bottom line is
[02:44:50.032 --> 02:45:03.625]  I don't want to hear how I'm racist all day if I think that there was, obviously, from the evidence, reasonable doubt in the Zimmerman case, and it becomes this football, while meanwhile the real program's going on.
[02:45:03.625 --> 02:45:08.389]  Now, I want to raise this point to you, because it's very, very important.
[02:45:08.389 --> 02:45:11.171]  Slavery's terrible, it's wrong, it's horrible, on and on and on.
[02:45:11.892 --> 02:45:19.974]  But look at the penal slave colony of Australia, so successful because the people that colonized it were white slaves, white prisoners in work brigades.
[02:45:19.974 --> 02:45:20.834]  Look at the U.S.
[02:45:20.834 --> 02:45:22.014]  for all its problems.
[02:45:22.014 --> 02:45:24.735]  Founded by indentured servants, slaves, you name it.
[02:45:24.735 --> 02:45:27.075]  Rough, tough, you name it, productive.
[02:45:27.075 --> 02:45:30.296]  That which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[02:45:30.296 --> 02:45:35.777]  And the system knows that, so they took the incredibly powerful, wealthy, black engine
[02:45:36.957 --> 02:45:44.760]  That was absolutely upwardly mobile, and they blew it into a thousand pieces, and that's why you've seen the wreckage.
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:49.902]  And the model they've done to the blacks, on record, is a model for every community now.
[02:45:49.902 --> 02:46:01.346]  So I want people to know, when you watch the nightly news, the mainstream news, and you see those messages in it that all seem liberal and trendy, those are psychological warfare torpedoes.
[02:46:01.346 --> 02:46:02.126]  Your comment on that?
[02:46:03.854 --> 02:46:12.164]  You know, I want to warn everybody in this country who are listening to this radio show.
[02:46:12.164 --> 02:46:23.398]  When you see a black person who hates a white person strictly because they're white, or you see some white person strictly hating some black person of other race because of their skin color, that's a dumb devil.
[02:46:24.110 --> 02:46:34.675]  When you see some of these people who come on television, who don't know they're behind from a hole in the ground when it comes to the world truth of what the problem is in America, that's a dumb devil.
[02:46:34.675 --> 02:46:37.836]  Don't worry about the dumb devils.
[02:46:37.836 --> 02:46:47.360]  You might want to pay close attention to the wise Satan that's sitting behind the scenes that we don't see every day.
[02:46:47.360 --> 02:46:53.483]  I'm talking about that 5% of the people who control the world's global economy.
[02:46:54.181 --> 02:46:58.868]  Those are the real enemies of United States citizens.
[02:46:59.423 --> 02:47:00.784]  I can't believe that.
[02:47:00.784 --> 02:47:01.964]  I can't believe that.
[02:47:01.964 --> 02:47:04.966]  And we ain't talking about folks that got 50 million dollars.
[02:47:04.966 --> 02:47:06.106]  They ain't got no money.
[02:47:29.079 --> 02:47:32.549]  The people we're talking about are those who have multi-billion.
[02:47:32.549 --> 02:47:33.712]  Those are the people we're
[02:47:34.527 --> 02:47:35.727]  No, I agree.
[02:47:35.727 --> 02:47:38.328]  It's so crazy having you on and agreeing with almost everything you say.
[02:47:38.328 --> 02:47:43.269]  Let's talk about, though, the spokesman in Jacksonville, Florida, for the Black Panther Party.
[02:47:43.269 --> 02:47:51.431]  I want to play this clip and get your take from this, because this is the kind of stuff that the media is using.
[02:47:51.431 --> 02:47:55.672]  And my whole issue is, this sounds like the stuff that comes out of the mouths of white supremacists.
[02:47:55.672 --> 02:47:57.593]  Let's go to the Black Panther Party in Florida.
[02:47:57.593 --> 02:47:57.953]  Here it is.
[02:47:57.953 --> 02:48:01.194]  To speak to the city of Jacksonville, we wanted to tell our side of the story.
[02:48:01.974 --> 02:48:09.778]  That we got involved because when we went to Sanford in the initial stages, there was an attempt to cover up this case.
[02:48:09.778 --> 02:48:22.723]  And so we went down and we investigated and we found out the true facts that Trayvon had been assassinated by a wicked white beast who today is talking about he's a Hispanic.
[02:48:22.723 --> 02:48:24.524]  And so we're not going to go along with that.
[02:48:24.524 --> 02:48:26.165]  We don't care because his father's a Jew.
[02:48:26.605 --> 02:48:35.209]  He's a no good Jew to sit before the world, George Zimmerman, and try to justify the brutal assassination and murder of Trayvon Martin.
[02:48:35.209 --> 02:48:36.029]  All right, that's enough.
[02:48:36.029 --> 02:48:38.590]  That's Mukail Mohammed.
[02:48:38.590 --> 02:48:47.615]  My whole point is, that sounds like the exact same stuff I hear out of the white supremacists all day, who do nothing but obsess over Jews all day.
[02:48:47.615 --> 02:48:50.116]  And it just, you know, I know...
[02:48:50.996 --> 02:48:52.256]  Well, that is my brother, Brother Mohammed.
[02:48:52.256 --> 02:48:53.657]  I don't know him personally.
[02:48:53.657 --> 02:48:55.257]  But he wears the name Mohammed.
[02:48:55.257 --> 02:48:56.298]  So obviously he's a Muslim.
[02:48:56.298 --> 02:48:57.098]  And I am a Muslim.
[02:49:20.914 --> 02:49:34.478]  I would want to encourage my dear brother to go and truly read the Holy Quran and read the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.
[02:49:34.478 --> 02:49:38.799]  The question was raised to Muhammad, who did he see in heaven?
[02:49:38.799 --> 02:49:45.281]  And Muhammad said he saw Jews, Christians, and Muslims in heaven, in paradise.
[02:49:45.281 --> 02:49:49.262]  It's not what you call yourself that makes you righteous today.
[02:49:50.202 --> 02:49:50.482]  All right.
[02:50:20.799 --> 02:50:24.922]  Well, listen, I think there was reasonable doubt, and that's what Jimmy Carter says.
[02:50:24.922 --> 02:50:26.644]  But I can see your point, Quan Alex.
[02:50:26.644 --> 02:50:31.087]  I'm glad that we had a real discussion here instead of just a big diversion and a fight.
[02:50:33.503 --> 02:50:35.965]  I want to come back and ask you one more question and then I'll let you go.
[02:50:35.965 --> 02:50:52.698]  I want to ask about the media said you guys were armed and then the other pro-Zimmerman protesters were armed and I want to talk about that and was there any type of confrontation and obviously I'm sure you're glad that nothing bad happened there and then what the police were up to.
[02:50:52.698 --> 02:50:56.421]  We'll get a final report from you on that straight ahead.
[02:50:56.421 --> 02:50:57.742]  I'm Alex Jones with M4Wars.com.
[02:51:01.445 --> 02:51:03.005]  Don't throw away leftovers.

[02:53:29.991 --> 02:53:30.471]  I think so.
[02:54:06.923 --> 02:54:14.244]  Folks, all over the country, whether you're black or white, doesn't matter what color you are, the police are doing proctology exams without warrants on the side of the road.
[02:54:14.244 --> 02:54:20.446]  Now, Arkansas police add saliva tests to check for drugs and alcohol without warrants.
[02:54:20.446 --> 02:54:28.607]  Look, you're not sticking your saliva test, and I know you're keeping the DNA, because every time you get saliva, there's cheek cells and tongue cells in it.
[02:54:28.607 --> 02:54:29.908]  That's how you do it.
[02:54:29.908 --> 02:54:31.648]  I mean, it's just scary.
[02:54:32.577 --> 02:54:35.418]  No, you're not going to stick in your gangster state.
[02:54:35.418 --> 02:54:38.779]  Great state, by the way, but the government's totally gangster in my mouth.
[02:54:38.779 --> 02:54:41.680]  It's all about getting in our business.
[02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:44.260]  Leftist caught running Zimmerman Frame Up.
[02:54:44.260 --> 02:54:48.482]  Rand Paul, Obama's goal in Syria is to fight to a stalemate.
[02:54:48.482 --> 02:54:52.523]  We've got a new comedy film, Talk to Your Kids About the Dangers of Royal Weddings.
[02:54:52.523 --> 02:54:52.883]  That's a...
[02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:56.111]  One of the entries to the Paul Revere contest.
[02:54:56.111 --> 02:55:00.472]  Just amazing info up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:55:00.472 --> 02:55:04.294]  No-fly zone over Syria, an act of war, General Dempsey warns.
[02:55:04.294 --> 02:55:07.235]  Absolutely, things are just escalating big time.
[02:55:07.235 --> 02:55:14.097]  QuanellX, I'm going to go to a little bit of overdrive and take phone calls here from folks like Jacqueline and others that are patiently holding.
[02:55:15.482 --> 02:55:19.906]  You were making some more points during the break about when the Chinese come marching up 45.
[02:55:19.906 --> 02:55:23.810]  Repeat that and make any other points about the demonstration and your security guys were armed.
[02:55:23.810 --> 02:55:26.192]  You said some of the pro-Zimmerman people were armed.
[02:55:26.192 --> 02:55:28.835]  I mean, that's exactly what the New World Order wants, but go ahead.
[02:55:29.918 --> 02:55:38.621]  It is true that some of my security were armed, but those members of my security were those who have legal concealed handgun permits to carry those weapons.
[02:55:38.621 --> 02:55:44.563]  And those weapons they've carried for years, but it's only those who have a legal concealed handgun permit to carry those weapons.
[02:55:44.563 --> 02:55:48.604]  There was never anyone... Yeah, but you've got a right to open carry in Texas without a permit.
[02:55:48.604 --> 02:55:49.685]  I agree with your right there.
[02:55:49.685 --> 02:55:53.686]  I'm saying the globalists would love to get a shooting war going between black and white.
[02:55:53.686 --> 02:55:54.486]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[02:55:54.486 --> 02:55:58.748]  And there were one or two who had firearms out in the open with a counter-protester.
[02:55:59.457 --> 02:56:06.300]  But we were not bothered by that because we knew that that was more demonstration than actual stuff.
[02:56:06.300 --> 02:56:09.341]  And you've done open carry demonstrations?
[02:56:09.341 --> 02:56:12.263]  We have had open carry demonstrations, yes we have.
[02:56:12.263 --> 02:56:17.045]  And so if it was my desire to have an open carry demonstration, I would have done that, but I have not done it.
[02:56:17.045 --> 02:56:19.346]  Was it the Black Panthers that were the first to do that?
[02:56:19.346 --> 02:56:20.726]  Didn't Khalid Mohammed?
[02:56:20.726 --> 02:56:21.907]  Who was the old leader that died?
[02:56:25.014 --> 02:56:29.517]  Yeah, he was the guy that killed the white babies at the Military Manufacturing Center.
[02:56:29.517 --> 02:56:31.359]  I mean, did he still believe that when he died?
[02:56:31.359 --> 02:56:33.720]  I believe that Col.
[02:56:33.720 --> 02:56:38.203]  Muhammad believed everything he absolutely spoke and did before he passed away.
[02:56:38.203 --> 02:56:43.187]  Do you agree that we should kill the babies and kill the white women at the Military Manufacturing Center?
[02:56:43.187 --> 02:56:48.491]  I believe that, which the Honorable Minister Mubarak taught me and teaches others.
[02:56:48.491 --> 02:56:51.353]  We have to kill the mindset of hatred in America.
[02:56:53.157 --> 02:57:07.803]  No, I know, but I mean, I'm glad to see the views softening, because I saw the Anthony Hilder debate he did with him when Khalid Mohammed said, you know, we need to kill all the white people, and you've seen these professors say that.
[02:57:07.803 --> 02:57:09.324]  You don't agree with that?
[02:57:09.324 --> 02:57:12.965]  No, you cannot kill innocent babies from the womb.
[02:57:12.965 --> 02:57:15.526]  You don't do no madness like that.
[02:57:15.526 --> 02:57:18.728]  That's the same thing that the Hitler attempted to do.
[02:57:18.728 --> 02:57:22.269]  Brother Minister Khalid Muhammad was absolutely in love with
[02:57:23.368 --> 02:57:25.570]  Sure, well he died young too.
[02:57:25.570 --> 02:57:27.931]  Do you think he might have been killed?
[02:57:27.931 --> 02:57:29.152]  I thought he died pretty young.
[02:57:46.274 --> 02:57:47.995]  Yeah, I mean, what was it, a stroke or something?
[02:57:47.995 --> 02:57:49.675]  Like, he was pretty young.
[02:57:49.675 --> 02:57:56.958]  He died from an aneurysm, and he died fairly young, and in fact, I was in the hospital when we announced his death.
[02:57:56.958 --> 02:57:59.459]  I was in the hospital before he passed away.
[02:57:59.459 --> 02:58:06.741]  I was right there in the very thick of it all when decisions were being made, when decisions were being made.
[02:58:06.741 --> 02:58:12.163]  And I absolutely know for a fact that a lot of things that were done were not right.
[02:58:12.163 --> 02:58:14.744]  And in fact, they were outright downright pathetic.
[02:58:15.589 --> 02:58:17.209]  Alright, well we're going to have to have you back.
[02:58:17.209 --> 02:58:19.350]  Kwon Alex, we're out of time.
[02:58:19.350 --> 02:58:22.111]  I appreciate you joining us and spending time with us.
[02:58:22.111 --> 02:58:27.092]  The website is QXJustice.com and hopefully you can pop back in from time to time.
[02:58:27.092 --> 02:58:30.473]  Sometime I want to get you on Skype because the quality is amazing there.
[02:58:30.473 --> 02:58:34.674]  But thank you for bringing us your perspective and I'm glad nothing violent happened here.
[02:58:34.674 --> 02:58:35.094]  Take care.
[02:58:35.094 --> 02:58:35.654]  Thank you very much.
[02:58:36.294 --> 02:58:36.935]  Thank you.
[02:58:36.935 --> 02:58:39.039]  All right, we're going to come right back with some overdrive on your phone calls.
[02:58:39.039 --> 02:58:42.725]  Infowars.com forward slash show for the free video and audio feeds.
[02:58:42.725 --> 02:58:44.068]  Your station doesn't carry it.
[02:58:44.068 --> 02:58:46.953]  And I'll be back tonight, seven o'clock Infowars Nightly News.
[02:58:46.953 --> 02:58:47.834]  Joe Biden.
[02:58:51.547 --> 02:58:54.549]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[02:58:54.549 --> 02:59:00.913]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.

[02:59:51.992 --> 02:59:55.576]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.576 --> 02:59:58.799]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.782 --> 03:00:10.627]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.627 --> 03:00:12.209]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.209 --> 03:00:14.131]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.131 --> 03:00:17.935]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.935 --> 03:00:22.020]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.509 --> 03:00:34.275]  You know, we can dig up the clip of his mentor, you know, when he's talking about, kill the white babies, kill the beautiful blue-eyed babies, because they're gonna grow up to kill your babies.
[03:00:34.275 --> 03:00:38.579]  And when the white woman lays down every month, reinforcements rolls out.
[03:00:39.930 --> 03:00:44.513]  So we kill the Military Manufacturing Center!
[03:00:44.513 --> 03:00:46.274]  I actually heard I can do a perfect imitation.
[03:00:46.274 --> 03:00:51.017]  I love doing imitations, as everybody knows.
[03:00:51.017 --> 03:00:54.580]  But I'm glad that Quan LX doesn't talk like that now.
[03:00:57.862 --> 03:01:01.764]  It's... I think he genuinely gets that humanity has to come together.
[03:01:01.764 --> 03:01:03.846]  The globalists are trying to play us off against each other.
[03:01:03.846 --> 03:01:08.968]  Race politics works for a while, but it's just so destructive.
[03:01:08.968 --> 03:01:15.252]  And I'm telling you, so much of what you hear come out of the black and Hispanic radical groups sounds like the Ku Klux Klan.
[03:01:15.252 --> 03:01:21.616]  And then as racism is promoted by the media, then it becomes a tactical issue of, well, I'm...
[03:01:23.211 --> 03:01:26.273]  I'm not racist, but everybody's saying I'm racist and saying I'm bad.
[03:01:26.273 --> 03:01:27.753]  They're being racist to me.
[03:01:27.753 --> 03:01:29.074]  So then you get forced into it.
[03:01:29.074 --> 03:01:31.255]  It's kind of like I'm not really a Republican.
[03:01:31.255 --> 03:01:32.796]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:01:32.796 --> 03:01:37.858]  But the Democrats have always hated me because they're the party are really bringing in the new world order.
[03:01:37.858 --> 03:01:39.919]  The Republicans are kind of their placeholder.
[03:01:39.919 --> 03:01:42.281]  And so the Republican libertarian arm.
[03:01:43.351 --> 03:01:50.174]  Has been nicer to me, and so whether I like it or not, I'm putting that camp, and that's the camp you just become part of.
[03:01:50.174 --> 03:01:51.415]  And the system knows that.
[03:01:51.415 --> 03:01:53.656]  It makes you choose a side.
[03:01:56.471 --> 03:02:03.412]  And I just wish we would all become aware of the manipulation and come together for... We love to be in gangs.
[03:02:03.412 --> 03:02:13.094]  Let's have a gang of liberty that's based on human justice, free market, ideas, where we admire people that build better and better things and who stand up for what's right in a culture of virtue.
[03:02:13.094 --> 03:02:16.135]  Let's reach for the stars or fall into hell.
[03:02:16.135 --> 03:02:17.995]  The choice is up to you.
[03:02:17.995 --> 03:02:19.456]  Let's talk to Pete in California.
[03:02:19.456 --> 03:02:20.136]  You're on the air.
[03:02:20.136 --> 03:02:20.496]  Go ahead.
[03:02:22.893 --> 03:02:25.734]  Hey Alex, nice to hear that show.
[03:02:25.734 --> 03:02:28.075]  That was a pretty amazing show right there.
[03:02:28.075 --> 03:02:30.336]  I just wanted to let you guys know that.
[03:02:30.336 --> 03:02:36.518]  Yeah, you had a lot of call waiting happening, so it was like clicking in and out, but overall it was an interesting interview.
[03:02:36.518 --> 03:02:47.683]  Yeah, it was, you know, to kind of hear that perspective, it kind of, you know, being out here in Santa Clara, I'm a Latino guy, I grew up in Los Angeles, and I'm out here in Santa Clara out here.
[03:02:48.652 --> 03:02:55.121]  You know, the division that they're really trying to push on Americans, it's just, it makes me sick to my stomach.
[03:02:55.121 --> 03:02:57.123]  It just really does.
[03:02:57.123 --> 03:03:02.610]  And, you know, I have two daughters and I definitely always tell my girls, you know, raise the
[03:03:03.676 --> 03:03:04.376]  Don't be afraid.
[03:03:04.376 --> 03:03:05.856]  There's no such thing as race.
[03:03:05.856 --> 03:03:08.537]  It's all about pure love you were talking about earlier.
[03:03:08.537 --> 03:03:11.417]  Gotta love humanity.
[03:03:11.417 --> 03:03:13.258]  But you've also got to have some culture.
[03:03:13.258 --> 03:03:18.339]  And the globalists are overriding all of our cultures and bringing in this plastic corporate death.
[03:03:18.339 --> 03:03:21.319]  We know we don't want that.
[03:03:21.319 --> 03:03:23.760]  No, absolutely not.
[03:03:23.760 --> 03:03:26.280]  That's where you have to be smart about what's going on.
[03:03:26.280 --> 03:03:27.960]  You have to be awake.
[03:03:27.960 --> 03:03:30.861]  I tell my friends and my family and everybody I'm in contact with
[03:03:31.573 --> 03:03:33.215]  You know, you gotta connect dots.
[03:03:33.215 --> 03:03:34.958]  You gotta be awake.
[03:03:34.958 --> 03:03:37.521]  You just can't just be in the zombie mode.
[03:03:37.521 --> 03:03:45.232]  Last night I watched Casablanca and it kind of opened my mind a little bit about
[03:03:45.959 --> 03:03:47.260]  What was going on in this movie?
[03:03:47.260 --> 03:03:52.163]  They had all the Germans there, they had the, you know, French, and then they had Humphrey Bogart there.
[03:03:52.163 --> 03:03:56.806]  You know, he was this kind of neutral guy that didn't really care about anything, which was more about himself.
[03:03:56.806 --> 03:04:02.290]  You have to choose a side right now, because, uh, you know, right now the United States, uh... Exactly!
[03:04:02.290 --> 03:04:06.453]  And they want you to choose a false side that they control the narrative on.
[03:04:06.453 --> 03:04:13.077]  They don't want us to come together under a Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, getting out from under the private Federal Reserve.
[03:04:13.077 --> 03:04:13.738]  That's the enemy.
[03:04:14.378 --> 03:04:25.552]  They want us fighting, and again, it becomes racial because let's say they program Mexico that you're collapsing, so come here, then they go under Democratic Party control.
[03:04:25.552 --> 03:04:30.838]  You have to oppose that, but not because you dislike all these poor refugees of the New World Order.
[03:04:30.838 --> 03:04:32.661]  You understand it's part of a larger program.
[03:04:33.041 --> 03:04:37.022]  So it doesn't mean that there aren't strategic things that go on.
[03:04:37.022 --> 03:04:47.146]  It means that you understand the great game, and now you're part of the great game, countering it from a master strategic position, being aware of getting outside the box.
[03:04:47.146 --> 03:04:49.387]  Get outside the box, step outside the box.
[03:04:49.387 --> 03:04:50.467]  That's what it's all about.
[03:04:50.467 --> 03:04:54.988]  Become aware of the game, and then decide not to play, and to build your own game.
[03:04:54.988 --> 03:04:57.589]  Now, stairway to the stars.
[03:04:57.589 --> 03:04:58.470]  We're going to overdrive.
[03:04:58.470 --> 03:04:59.270]  More calls coming up.
[03:05:01.556 --> 03:05:02.977]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.977 --> 03:05:13.642]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:13.642 --> 03:05:17.724]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:05:18.104 --> 03:05:20.846]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:05:20.846 --> 03:05:32.115]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:32.115 --> 03:05:35.278]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:35.598 --> 03:05:41.740]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.740 --> 03:05:51.644]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:51.644 --> 03:05:53.144]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.144 --> 03:05:55.045]  It's an info war.
[03:05:55.045 --> 03:05:56.985]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:01.707 --> 03:06:07.071]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[03:06:07.071 --> 03:06:08.712]  What are bitcoins?
[03:06:08.712 --> 03:06:15.197]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[03:06:15.197 --> 03:06:17.018]  No bank needed.
[03:06:17.018 --> 03:06:22.703]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[03:06:22.703 --> 03:06:24.484]  You are in control of your money.
[03:06:24.964 --> 03:06:26.124]  And the best part?
[03:06:26.124 --> 03:06:29.746]  You can start earning and making money with bitcoins right away.
[03:06:29.746 --> 03:06:37.608]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept bitcoins.
[03:06:37.608 --> 03:06:41.649]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros and more.

[03:07:02.741 --> 03:07:05.883]  Just because the IRS says you owe them a lot of money, are you just going to do what?
[03:07:05.883 --> 03:07:07.905]  Throw your hands up in the air and write a check?
[03:07:07.905 --> 03:07:08.545]  What are you doing?
[03:07:08.545 --> 03:07:10.287]  You've got to fight this stuff.

[03:07:34.363 --> 03:07:40.127]  Or how they helped set up installment agreements or got debts reduced through the proper submission of an offer in compromise.

[03:07:52.734 --> 03:07:53.995]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:07:53.995 --> 03:07:55.215]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:12.065 --> 03:08:22.113]  Well, the media is pressuring John Boehner, the head of the House, to go along with Obamacare and to expand it.
[03:08:22.113 --> 03:08:28.318]  And you got Weiner over there, Weiner and Boehner and all of them, running for mayor again.
[03:08:28.318 --> 03:08:30.620]  There just seems to be no end to any of this.
[03:08:30.620 --> 03:08:33.042]  Alright, that was a horrible attempt at stupid humor.
[03:08:33.042 --> 03:08:34.583]  It's now turned into the Benny Hill Show.
[03:08:35.981 --> 03:08:38.344]  Don't we have the Benny Hill soundtrack for screw-ups around here?
[03:08:38.344 --> 03:08:43.530]  Yeah, we should have that more often on the show.
[03:08:43.530 --> 03:08:52.681]  When we like, try to go to a... You know, when I was a kid, I used to stay up late when I'd stay at friends' houses.
[03:08:52.681 --> 03:08:53.742]  Watch Benny Hill.
[03:08:53.742 --> 03:08:55.764]  Technical difficulties.
[03:09:01.627 --> 03:09:02.387]  Gotta love it.
[03:09:02.387 --> 03:09:04.208]  Alright, you've been holding long enough.
[03:09:04.208 --> 03:09:07.209]  I went into overdrive to take your phone calls.
[03:09:07.209 --> 03:09:11.030]  Let's go ahead and talk to Marvin in Texas.
[03:09:11.030 --> 03:09:12.371]  Let's talk about Quan LX.
[03:09:12.371 --> 03:09:13.811]  Go ahead.
[03:09:13.811 --> 03:09:14.732]  Hey, Alex.
[03:09:14.732 --> 03:09:17.233]  That actually threw me for a loop.
[03:09:17.233 --> 03:09:19.633]  He came off pretty knowledgeable, which I knew he was.
[03:09:19.633 --> 03:09:23.275]  I've talked to Michelle Williams in Tampa, Florida.
[03:09:23.275 --> 03:09:23.915]  You remember her?
[03:09:24.696 --> 03:09:26.437]  The big New Black Panther Party guy.
[03:09:26.437 --> 03:09:28.459]  Yeah, oh yeah, really a moronic person.
[03:09:28.459 --> 03:09:29.440]  No, no, no!
[03:09:29.440 --> 03:09:32.782]  Actually, on the phone, this is, this kind of reminded me of this.
[03:09:32.782 --> 03:09:35.364]  On the phone, she is highly intelligent.
[03:09:35.364 --> 03:09:40.428]  I've spoken with her, I've called her out, I've been threatened by the New Black Panther Party, blah blah blah.
[03:09:40.428 --> 03:09:41.749]  It doesn't scare me.
[03:09:41.749 --> 03:09:44.291]  I actually gave him my address and said, come on over.
[03:09:44.291 --> 03:09:47.554]  But the point being is, is I want you to be careful with this guy, with his listeners.
[03:09:47.554 --> 03:09:53.719]  He'll say one thing, come off perfect, like a politician, and then turn around and go back to his group and say another thing.
[03:09:55.279 --> 03:10:03.002]  No, no, listen, that's why I brought up Khalid Mohammed, which if you, I mean, it's like, I quoted it earlier.
[03:10:03.002 --> 03:10:04.623]  He said, you kill the white babies.
[03:10:04.623 --> 03:10:04.823]  Why?
[03:10:04.823 --> 03:10:06.364]  Because they'll grow up to kill your babies.
[03:10:06.364 --> 03:10:14.347]  And you kill the white woman because every nine months she lays down and reinforcement rolls out because of the military manufacturing center.
[03:10:14.347 --> 03:10:17.388]  I love, I love that clip, but we got to find that somewhere.
[03:10:17.388 --> 03:10:18.289]  Anthony Hilder has it.
[03:10:19.429 --> 03:10:19.869]  Oh, we have it.
[03:10:19.869 --> 03:10:21.269]  We're going to play it in a moment.
[03:10:21.269 --> 03:10:24.250]  He talked about just, I could, that guy was a nice preacher.
[03:10:24.250 --> 03:10:25.830]  He had a good Baptist sermon.
[03:10:25.830 --> 03:10:26.910]  I could go hear him on Sunday.
[03:10:26.910 --> 03:10:28.171]  I love his voice.
[03:10:28.171 --> 03:10:32.952]  The Military, the Military Manufacturing Center.
[03:10:32.952 --> 03:10:36.992]  Anyways, I think I'm going to change my name to Military Manufacturing Center.
[03:10:36.992 --> 03:10:38.873]  Sir, I'm going to come back to you, Marvin.
[03:10:38.873 --> 03:10:42.133]  Here is the deceased Dr. Muhammad.
[03:10:42.133 --> 03:10:43.514]  Here he is.
[03:10:43.514 --> 03:10:44.674]  Why kill the women?
[03:10:46.454 --> 03:10:48.856]  First, why kill the babies?
[03:10:48.856 --> 03:10:51.938]  They're just little innocent blue-eyed babies!
[03:10:51.938 --> 03:10:55.880]  Because goddammit, they're gonna grow up one day to rule your babies!
[03:10:55.880 --> 03:10:57.681]  Now kill them now!
[03:10:57.681 --> 03:10:59.962]  And why kill the women in South Africa?
[03:10:59.962 --> 03:11:05.005]  I said kill the women because the women are the military manufacturing center!
[03:11:05.325 --> 03:11:06.786]  Alright, that's good.
[03:11:28.373 --> 03:11:30.855]  We ought to get that black professor to search.
[03:11:30.855 --> 03:11:32.736]  Black professor says kill all whites.
[03:11:32.736 --> 03:11:35.017]  It was a few years ago, and they defended it.
[03:11:35.017 --> 03:11:38.119]  My whole point is, this is like Hitler.
[03:11:38.119 --> 03:11:39.240]  I mean, that's a genocide.
[03:11:39.240 --> 03:11:40.481]  Kill everybody.
[03:11:40.481 --> 03:11:41.962]  Hey, don't worry.
[03:11:41.962 --> 03:11:43.142]  7% of the world's white.
[03:11:43.142 --> 03:11:45.544]  Most whites are, quote, intermarrying.
[03:11:45.544 --> 03:11:46.965]  So there's not going to be any white people.
[03:11:46.965 --> 03:11:48.226]  But don't worry.
[03:11:48.226 --> 03:11:51.728]  If you got lighter skin, you're going to get killed because you got devil blood.
[03:11:52.188 --> 03:11:54.850]  And the devil blood is the most evil!
[03:11:54.850 --> 03:11:56.972]  And it's got to be dealt with!
[03:11:56.972 --> 03:12:04.377]  And if you're not as black as Dr. Muhammad, then we're gonna chop your head off, you white devil!
[03:12:04.377 --> 03:12:06.218]  Anyways.
[03:12:06.218 --> 03:12:07.299]  Kind of fun to talk like that.
[03:12:07.299 --> 03:12:11.182]  Hey, I can do the redneck voices, I can do the black preacher voices as well.
[03:12:13.339 --> 03:12:15.980]  I've actually been offered jobs and voiceovers in Hollywood.
[03:12:15.980 --> 03:12:17.260]  The problem is I have to live out there.
[03:12:17.260 --> 03:12:21.322]  They want you there to do like weekly auditions for movies and stuff.
[03:12:21.322 --> 03:12:23.223]  Maybe I should just do all that.
[03:12:23.223 --> 03:12:29.325]  Take my cracker butt out to Hollywood and make a bunch of money and sit around drinking pina coladas.
[03:12:29.325 --> 03:12:30.786]  But I'm not gonna do it.
[03:12:30.786 --> 03:12:35.487]  Because I'm part of the Military Manufacturing Center!
[03:12:35.487 --> 03:12:36.628]  Man, I love talking like that.
[03:12:37.908 --> 03:12:39.989]  I think I should be my new persona.
[03:12:39.989 --> 03:12:42.349]  Alright, let's go to Jose.
[03:12:42.349 --> 03:12:44.090]  No, Marvin.
[03:12:44.090 --> 03:12:45.030]  Is that what you're talking about?
[03:12:45.030 --> 03:12:48.991]  Are you saying Quanell X talks like that?
[03:12:48.991 --> 03:12:49.952]  Uh, yeah.
[03:12:49.952 --> 03:12:56.514]  I'm just saying you gotta be real careful with him because like on the new Black Panther... But that's coming from a cracker!
[03:12:56.514 --> 03:13:00.335]  Yes, and I'm also in a biracial marriage and she's part black!
[03:13:01.024 --> 03:13:02.986]  So, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[03:13:02.986 --> 03:13:06.108]  Well, those babies are evil because they're part white and need to be dealt with.
[03:13:06.108 --> 03:13:12.273]  Yeah, but anyway, like on the Arkansas New Black Panther Party, they're talking about George Zimmerman must be killed, blah, blah, blah.
[03:13:12.273 --> 03:13:21.079]  Quannell associates with these people, so don't, when he said he wasn't part of them, he's probably not, but he still associates with them.
[03:13:21.079 --> 03:13:27.464]  But listen, I just got the guy on so we could have a discussion and not just have a fight with each other.
[03:13:27.464 --> 03:13:29.906]  And it was actually very, it threw me for a loop.
[03:13:30.365 --> 03:13:31.325]  I was like, wow.
[03:13:31.325 --> 03:13:32.985]  And he pulled a Michelle Williams.
[03:13:32.985 --> 03:13:36.326]  Because I would talk to Michelle Williams on the phone and she would tell me, we gotta do this, this, and this.
[03:13:36.326 --> 03:13:38.026]  I said, makes perfect sense.
[03:13:38.026 --> 03:13:39.126]  Then she would go back out to her phone.
[03:13:39.126 --> 03:13:43.967]  Yeah, but she knows she doesn't get on the media unless she says kill, you know, all that kind of stuff they say.
[03:13:43.967 --> 03:13:45.247]  I appreciate your call.
[03:13:45.247 --> 03:13:47.828]  Let's talk to Jose in California.
[03:13:47.828 --> 03:13:48.828]  Jose, you're on the air.
[03:13:48.828 --> 03:13:50.728]  Go ahead.
[03:13:50.728 --> 03:13:53.949]  Hey man, that guy is a liar.
[03:13:53.949 --> 03:13:56.629]  The blacks are the killers.
[03:13:56.629 --> 03:13:57.650]  You're being sarcastic.
[03:13:57.650 --> 03:13:58.290]  That's enough.
[03:13:58.290 --> 03:13:59.450]  I appreciate your call, Jose.
[03:14:00.758 --> 03:14:02.819]  You probably have a last name like Johnson or something.
[03:14:02.819 --> 03:14:04.300]  Now you're calling it.
[03:14:04.300 --> 03:14:10.544]  I mean, there's just no... People just love fighting over everything.
[03:14:10.544 --> 03:14:12.345]  The stupid Zimmerman stuff, man.
[03:14:12.345 --> 03:14:15.146]  I tell you, there's just no end to it.
[03:14:15.146 --> 03:14:15.667]  Oh, boy.
[03:14:15.667 --> 03:14:17.788]  Let's talk to Chris in New York.
[03:14:17.788 --> 03:14:18.948]  Chris, you're on the air.
[03:14:18.948 --> 03:14:21.350]  Should I do the whole show in the voice of Khalid Muhammad?
[03:14:24.360 --> 03:14:24.500]  Hello?
[03:14:24.500 --> 03:14:26.982]  Uh, yeah, I'm calling because of the fact that, um,
[03:14:54.224 --> 03:15:07.173]  The guest that was in the show just a minute ago said that Zimmerman and quote said that he's an effing thug and that he doesn't belong around here.
[03:15:07.173 --> 03:15:18.661]  I think the fact that he said he doesn't belong around here was because of the fact that he actually did not live around that area and the only kid and the only moment... I think there was some profiling because he was black and wearing a hoodie.
[03:15:19.468 --> 03:15:23.789]  I mean, look, when I was growing up, if I was walking around between houses, people would come out and say, what are you doing?
[03:15:23.789 --> 03:15:25.670]  I mean, that kind of stuff.
[03:15:25.670 --> 03:15:32.371]  Plus, older folks don't know, and people like Zimmerman look pretty square, that hoodies have been in for like a decade.
[03:15:32.371 --> 03:15:36.472]  Now, hoodies are definitely in around my office because I keep it so cold around here.
[03:15:36.472 --> 03:15:38.653]  Everybody wears like Arctic outfits.
[03:15:38.653 --> 03:15:42.854]  But I mean, what do you think overall about all of this, Chris?
[03:15:42.854 --> 03:15:45.975]  Well, I think overall, I think that it has to be hyped up.
[03:15:46.673 --> 03:15:49.735]  Too much to be used as a political tool?
[03:15:49.735 --> 03:15:54.537]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:15:54.537 --> 03:15:55.378]  Let me tell you something.
[03:15:55.378 --> 03:16:02.841]  When you give out your money to the bank, you become an unsecured creditor and the bank is a debtor.
[03:16:02.841 --> 03:16:11.626]  The fact that it's not being talked about in the mainstream media is that Barack Obama made us all unsecured creditors to the private Fed.
[03:16:13.115 --> 03:16:13.736]  Absolutely.
[03:16:13.736 --> 03:16:14.616]  God bless you.
[03:16:14.616 --> 03:16:15.677]  Well, it's like Louis Farrakhan.
[03:16:15.677 --> 03:16:19.340]  He says a lot of stuff I agree with, like, you want to build up the black community?
[03:16:19.340 --> 03:16:21.842]  Spend your money in your local community.
[03:16:21.842 --> 03:16:28.427]  I mean, I go out of my way to try to go to little shops, little places, whether they're black, white, Hispanic, I don't care.
[03:16:28.427 --> 03:16:29.548]  I like to go to mom and pops.
[03:16:29.548 --> 03:16:31.049]  Usually the food's better anyways.
[03:16:31.049 --> 03:16:32.190]  I try to go to little stores.
[03:16:32.190 --> 03:16:36.353]  I try to, I try to go with small local companies if they can give good service.
[03:16:36.353 --> 03:16:37.334]  And a lot of times it is better.
[03:16:39.514 --> 03:16:51.297]  Plus, big companies like the Secret Police or something, they've always got a side business of info, so they're sitting there, you know, you're like having a police interrogation, you know, with the carpet cleaner or whatever, or with the yard people.
[03:16:51.297 --> 03:16:53.578]  So, I mean, it's very, very simple.
[03:16:53.578 --> 03:16:55.178]  Things like that really make sense.
[03:16:55.178 --> 03:17:03.441]  I mean, I want, I wish Mexico was like Switzerland, man, with jet ports and awesome houses and it's beautiful down there.
[03:17:03.441 --> 03:17:04.921]  I'd say merge Mexico with the U.S.
[03:17:04.921 --> 03:17:07.682]  I don't care what color the people are, I care about the culture.
[03:17:08.582 --> 03:17:11.765]  And the culture of Mexico is a failed kleptocracy.
[03:17:11.765 --> 03:17:13.727]  We don't want to merge with that.
[03:17:13.727 --> 03:17:17.270]  And that's like spoken like a blue-eyed devil.
[03:17:17.270 --> 03:17:19.131]  Let's talk to Lori in Arkansas.
[03:17:19.131 --> 03:17:20.793]  Last caller I have time for in Overdrive.
[03:17:20.793 --> 03:17:22.074]  Sorry to the other people.
[03:17:22.074 --> 03:17:24.356]  Go ahead, Lori.
[03:17:24.356 --> 03:17:29.060]  Are you ready to have the warrantless checkpoint take your DNA on the side of the highway cupcake?
[03:17:30.226 --> 03:17:31.506]  Can you hear me, Mr. Jones?
[03:17:31.506 --> 03:17:31.967]  Yes, ma'am.
[03:17:31.967 --> 03:17:32.507]  Thanks for holding.
[03:17:32.507 --> 03:17:33.087]  Go ahead.
[03:17:33.087 --> 03:17:34.927]  Okay.
[03:17:34.927 --> 03:17:42.410]  First of all, you're not going to believe what I've been going through since July 1st here in the second-largest city, Portsmouth, Arkansas.
[03:17:42.410 --> 03:17:43.950]  What's going on?
[03:17:43.950 --> 03:17:49.492]  It's like you're not even in America, let alone the state of Arkansas.
[03:17:49.492 --> 03:17:52.753]  Let me try to make a long story short what occurred to me this past July.
[03:17:52.753 --> 03:17:53.033]  No, I know.
[03:17:53.033 --> 03:17:55.714]  They've got checkpoints, curfews.
[03:17:55.714 --> 03:17:56.554]  Is that what you're calling about?
[03:17:57.347 --> 03:18:08.950]  No, I was falsely arrested just as Mr. Jones was supposedly intercepting government operations here in Fort Smith, Arkansas, which is the second largest city in Arkansas.
[03:18:08.950 --> 03:18:14.352]  All I was doing was waiting for a taxi cab, me and my beloved cat, to go to a motel.
[03:18:14.352 --> 03:18:15.232]  Is the cat racist?
[03:18:16.852 --> 03:18:17.613]  I am not.
[03:18:17.613 --> 03:18:19.334]  I am a white person, but I am a Dalmatian white person.
[03:18:19.334 --> 03:18:19.674]  You're racist.
[03:18:19.674 --> 03:18:20.574]  We can't listen to you now.
[03:18:20.574 --> 03:18:23.776]  They are killing poor people as well here in Portland.
[03:18:23.776 --> 03:18:25.637]  The cat's racist, ma'am.
[03:18:25.637 --> 03:18:27.818]  So, let me be serious.
[03:18:27.818 --> 03:18:34.261]  They arrested you for intercepting government communications, because they're all looking for spies.
[03:18:34.261 --> 03:18:36.523]  The spies run the government.
[03:18:36.523 --> 03:18:37.223]  What happened to you?
[03:18:38.680 --> 03:18:45.143]  Mr. Jones, me and my three adult cats with our five kittens to go to the motel outside the Payless Shoes store.
[03:18:45.143 --> 03:18:51.165]  Let me tell you that the governor in Little Rock, Arkansas, he claims to be a Democrat.
[03:18:51.165 --> 03:18:52.366]  There is not a diagram thing.
[03:18:52.366 --> 03:18:55.147]  My cats are being held hostage at Humane Society.
[03:18:55.147 --> 03:18:58.088]  They want me to pay them close to $2,000.
[03:18:58.088 --> 03:19:01.429]  I was released from the jail cell July 5th.
[03:19:01.429 --> 03:19:04.491]  They arrested you for intercepting a government communication?
[03:19:04.491 --> 03:19:07.592]  Waiting for a cab, Mr. Jones, to go to the motel, me and my cats.
[03:19:08.403 --> 03:19:09.364]  Mm-hmm.
[03:19:09.364 --> 03:19:12.686]  And so now they've arrested you as a spy?
[03:19:12.686 --> 03:19:13.606]  What's happening next?
[03:19:13.606 --> 03:19:14.727]  Gitmo?
[03:19:14.727 --> 03:19:15.868]  No, not a spy, Mr. Jones.
[03:19:15.868 --> 03:19:16.328]  I don't know.
[03:19:16.328 --> 03:19:17.889]  They made up some cockamamie excuse.
[03:19:17.889 --> 03:19:23.132]  They wanted the wagon back from the Dollar Tree store that it was a felony offense to take our wagon.
[03:19:23.132 --> 03:19:24.513]  But let me make a long story short.
[03:19:24.513 --> 03:19:31.157]  I was released from their jail cell July 5th, and I'm trying to get my cats back from the Humane Society.
[03:19:31.157 --> 03:19:32.398]  They're holding them hostage.
[03:19:32.398 --> 03:19:33.679]  They want me to pay them close to $2,000.
[03:19:33.679 --> 03:19:36.420]  Well, they're obviously in league with Al-Qaeda, ma'am.
[03:19:36.420 --> 03:19:36.941]  I tell you what.
[03:19:37.281 --> 03:19:39.002]  I'm going to put you on hold, give you one of my riders.
[03:19:39.002 --> 03:19:46.084]  If you can show us proof, and this isn't a spoof call, then we're absolutely... Let me tell you, if it isn't a spoof call, it's amazing.
[03:19:46.084 --> 03:19:47.425]  Stuff just gets so much crazier.
[03:19:47.425 --> 03:19:49.085]  Man, we're going to try to get you some help here.
[03:19:49.085 --> 03:19:55.007]  I'm going to get you with one of our crack reporters, Julie Wilson, and we'll try to get your cats out of Camp Gitmo.
[03:19:55.007 --> 03:19:55.928]  They will kill them.
[03:19:55.928 --> 03:19:57.468]  I mean, that's not a joke.
[03:19:57.468 --> 03:19:59.549]  But we all know those cats are racist folks.
[03:19:59.549 --> 03:20:00.870]  I mean, one of them's white.
