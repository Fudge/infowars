[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:37.000]  we've got a head spinningly jammed back transmission lined up for you today we've
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.520]  got Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs retired joining us to talk about the Bob
[00:42.520 --> 00:48.200]  Bergdahl situation how he goes from a matter of weeks that he's totally mentally
[00:48.200 --> 00:52.000]  ill no one can talk to him the press can't talk to him to oh he's back on
[00:52.000 --> 00:58.360]  active duty that's just not done with a supposed intelligence trove like an
[00:58.360 --> 01:02.200]  individual held for years by the Taliban when he was really basically ordered to
[01:02.200 --> 01:06.840]  go give himself up at the group and I believe from day one he is a deep cover
[01:06.840 --> 01:11.280]  infiltrator and that's what Biggs thinks as well a lot of other people I trust
[01:11.280 --> 01:15.840]  think that and now the fact that the story is a non-issue the question is what
[01:15.840 --> 01:21.400]  was the point of the story well the point of the story we said a month ago and we
[01:21.400 --> 01:26.760]  say it now and the evidence is mounting was a distraction from the mounting VA
[01:26.760 --> 01:32.960]  scandal just like red a dare would send in dynamite to blow up an oil fire you
[01:32.960 --> 01:39.000]  take a big story to extinguish an even bigger one use an explosion to take out
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.480]  an explosion the public loves a mystery they love who done it is he a trader is
[01:45.480 --> 01:50.160]  any a trader right out of central casting but it also had a foreign effect
[01:50.160 --> 01:55.320]  and we'll discuss that but it creates the illusion that again the West is
[01:55.320 --> 02:00.400]  actually fighting with the Taliban and al-Qaeda they are fighting with the
[02:00.400 --> 02:05.560]  grassroots organizations but not with the main players you see on the nightly
[02:05.560 --> 02:10.200]  news and that's been proven in triplicate with ISIS and al-Qaeda and more and
[02:10.200 --> 02:13.360]  there's a bunch of mainstream news articles last week we're going to go
[02:13.360 --> 02:18.040]  over where it's just admitted oh yeah they really work for the CIA for British
[02:18.040 --> 02:25.600]  intelligence for Pakistani intelligence and it is truly disgusting and and
[02:25.600 --> 02:29.840]  they're actually growing a real radical Islamic threat in the West that will be
[02:29.840 --> 02:34.600]  used as a further excuse to bring in social control Wayne Madsen who quite
[02:34.600 --> 02:39.960]  frankly is a bigger whistleblower than Snowden over the years he's brought out
[02:39.960 --> 02:43.880]  more than Snowden has I'm just saying in the past they would ignore whistleblowers
[02:43.880 --> 02:47.320]  he's going to be joining us to cover the waterfront had been on about three four
[02:47.320 --> 02:53.400]  months and then we've also got Syrian girl from Australia whose family was
[02:53.400 --> 02:57.360]  formerly in the ruling party over there before Assad had him kicked out so
[02:57.360 --> 03:01.360]  they're actually anti Assad but even more anti al-Qaeda everything she's been
[03:01.360 --> 03:04.640]  saying here the last year and a half they turned out to be accurate she's
[03:04.640 --> 03:10.480]  going to be joining us as well so all that and more today there's also some
[03:10.480 --> 03:17.000]  really interesting comedy relief up on info wars comm and drugs report comms
[03:17.000 --> 03:23.240]  where I found it CNS news comm White House we substantially improve the
[03:23.240 --> 03:28.520]  tranquility of the global community I meant to do this for the show and I got
[03:28.520 --> 03:34.200]  busy and didn't do it guys just search engine world more unstable than ever or
[03:34.200 --> 03:38.920]  I mean they've got British Ministry of Defense reports Pentagon reports they've
[03:38.920 --> 03:42.840]  got think tank reports University reports but but I mean anybody can look
[03:42.840 --> 03:47.320]  at the world with Ukraine the Middle East the dollar in decline Mexico
[03:47.320 --> 03:52.160]  collapsing Latin America and depression the Caribbean in depression Japan in
[03:52.160 --> 03:56.240]  20 years of recession China having hundreds of riots a day thousands a
[03:56.240 --> 04:06.240]  week I mean the world is more unstable than ever and so we're being told that
[04:06.240 --> 04:14.360]  Obama has created just such wondrous happy tranquility that's why the
[04:14.360 --> 04:17.480]  Pentagon's own report two weeks ago said they're preparing for collapse and
[04:17.480 --> 04:24.360]  total civil unrest and martial law and the British are as well because Obama
[04:24.360 --> 04:29.240]  has created incredible tranquility and again that's a lie within a lie
[04:29.240 --> 04:33.960]  Obama's the front man for the globalists the technocrats who were
[04:33.960 --> 04:38.280]  destabilizing the planet by design so it's kind of a lie to even counter him
[04:38.280 --> 04:43.480]  and say no you have destabilized things because he's running nothing but
[04:43.480 --> 04:48.320]  politically as a front man must be politically brought down to discredit
[04:48.320 --> 04:52.560]  their system and to scare the other functionaries of the globalists that
[04:52.560 --> 04:56.880]  they might get in trouble like lowest learner if they continue their criminal

[09:00.800 --> 09:08.840]  of space all our ancestors that came before us in their struggles science the
[09:08.840 --> 09:13.440]  technology the act of men and women coming together to produce the next
[09:13.440 --> 09:23.160]  generation the kinsmanship the honor the passion the love the treachery I have
[09:23.160 --> 09:29.880]  learned from fools and from sages it is the great adventure it is life trapped
[09:29.880 --> 09:35.720]  in purgatory awaiting the hour of reprisal
[09:40.280 --> 09:47.520]  trapped in purgatory you can say we're in the Phantom Zone here ladies and
[09:47.520 --> 09:51.680]  gentlemen in the third dimension I just want people to think about the big
[09:51.680 --> 09:59.360]  picture out there and understand there is a lot of things going on that are
[09:59.360 --> 10:04.040]  bigger and more important than all the little criminal politicians with their
[10:04.040 --> 10:09.360]  Air Force One and their their big red carpets trying to make us feel small and
[10:09.360 --> 10:15.600]  powerless they're doing that on purpose and now the White House has come out and
[10:15.600 --> 10:19.680]  the stories in the printer you guys bring that into me thank you now the White
[10:19.680 --> 10:26.240]  House has come out and said we've substantially improved the tranquility of
[10:26.240 --> 10:34.000]  the global community and if you continue down that line if you have a business
[10:34.000 --> 10:41.440]  you didn't build that raising the debt limit does not raise the debt if you
[10:41.440 --> 10:45.000]  have a doctor you can keep them and this will cut the price of your health care
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.880]  to that of a phone bill or cable build instead of doubling or tripling it there
[10:48.880 --> 10:55.800]  are no death panels and Barack Obama is a progressive liberal well only if you
[10:55.800 --> 11:02.360]  think that deadly pancreatic cancer metastasizing into the liver and the
[11:02.360 --> 11:07.240]  lungs and the brain and the lymph nodes is something good in the word
[11:07.240 --> 11:14.320]  progressive then I guess it is something that is good in other wild headlines
[11:14.320 --> 11:20.280]  before I plunge into all the really serious news here today NASA has come
[11:20.280 --> 11:27.360]  out and said that humans will prove we are not alone how many times did NASA
[11:27.360 --> 11:35.840]  find what they believe are the skeletal remains or the imprint of microbes on
[11:35.840 --> 11:41.920]  Mars and how many times did they then retract it later saying it wasn't look
[11:41.920 --> 11:45.240]  I don't believe we're alone in the universe let's be clear about that
[11:45.240 --> 11:50.200]  obviously ladies and gentlemen we're not alone on this planet there's a lot of
[11:50.200 --> 11:55.000]  things going on on heaven and earth that we are not privy to just look at all
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.120]  the ancient writings they all mirror each other across the globe there's
[12:00.120 --> 12:04.120]  definitely some things going on here we're not in Kansas ladies and gentlemen
[12:04.120 --> 12:10.160]  we're in deep space humans will prove we are not alone in the universe CBS news
[12:10.160 --> 12:18.240]  within 20 years the word is you can research this with the SETI system the
[12:18.240 --> 12:23.800]  high-powered radio telescopes but they've had up since the 70s that they've
[12:23.800 --> 12:31.520]  gotten a lot of transmissions that are not of naturally occurring space chatter
[12:31.520 --> 12:41.840]  coming out of planets and suns and black holes and let's just hope that whoever's
[12:41.840 --> 12:50.320]  listening is nice and of course I would venture to say that in the Bible it
[12:50.320 --> 12:54.520]  talks about these entities that aren't visible to the eye but are right there
[12:54.520 --> 12:58.400]  around us and of course that would fit into the fourth and fifth dimension
[12:58.400 --> 13:04.520]  equations that are out there and again I don't mean to go off into the speculative
[13:04.520 --> 13:08.480]  realm here today when you've got the Pope saying there's aliens and that you
[13:08.480 --> 13:11.720]  know that they're prepared for him to come and you've got NASA saying get ready
[13:11.720 --> 13:15.840]  and then there's all the original moon footage that didn't get released till
[13:15.840 --> 13:24.000]  later with a whole string of different astronauts saying that their ships were
[13:24.000 --> 13:30.440]  followed by other craft and then in the NASA order that information suppressed
[13:30.440 --> 13:34.560]  there's obviously something going on and again I've talked to Buzz Aldrin
[13:34.560 --> 13:42.960]  privately and I've talked to Buzz Aldrin on the air and Buzz Aldrin's
[13:42.960 --> 13:47.560]  assistant is a listener and did get Buzz Aldrin second person to walk on the
[13:47.560 --> 13:52.000]  moon on the show and then there was a quite a freak out after that happened
[13:52.000 --> 14:00.240]  and he is not coming back on the show just like we were one micron from
[14:00.240 --> 14:05.440]  getting Chuck Yeager on the broadcast till government people found out and got
[14:05.440 --> 14:12.840]  involved because they don't want these icons coming on the show but expanding
[14:12.840 --> 14:20.440]  on that I have told part of the story about Buzz Aldrin the only reason I
[14:20.440 --> 14:31.480]  tell this again is because it's so fantastical I'm out in Hollywood and I'd
[14:31.480 --> 14:35.640]  already interviewed this person before Buzz Aldrin and the phone rings and his
[14:35.640 --> 14:38.760]  Hollywood stars house I was at was going to be going to dinner with him in a
[14:38.760 --> 14:42.200]  couple days and I was invited but I couldn't stay in town I had to come back
[14:42.200 --> 14:46.640]  I wish I would have gone now and and and they're going to dinner ended up being
[14:46.640 --> 14:53.000]  on the news was on TMZ to a steakhouse a few days later and this is about a 30
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.680]  minute conversation on speakerphone sitting out over the Hollywood Hills in
[14:56.680 --> 15:00.560]  the classic Hollywood setting with the big pool and the Butler bringing you
[15:00.560 --> 15:06.680]  know iced tea just you know matrix like bizarreness and I'm sitting up there
[15:06.680 --> 15:10.120]  because and the matrix like weirdness is that Buzz Aldrin's on the phone
[15:10.120 --> 15:20.120]  speakerphone on an iPhone it was like an iPhone one and he's conversing with his
[15:20.120 --> 15:30.960]  Hollywood star and I chime in a few times and he's saying all this wild stuff
[15:30.960 --> 15:38.600]  off record and then he says by the way the Indians in a few months are gonna
[15:38.600 --> 15:44.120]  crash a probe into the moon and they're gonna discover water of course we
[15:44.120 --> 15:47.440]  really discovered it there but weren't supposed to release that info but just be
[15:47.440 --> 15:50.880]  waiting for that folks it wasn't in the news yet they were gonna crash a probe
[15:50.880 --> 15:56.560]  in and I'm thinking Buzz Aldrin's nuts at this point this is how naive I was
[15:56.560 --> 16:01.280]  even then okay they had about a month later or so they announced they're gonna
[16:01.280 --> 16:05.480]  crash a probe in and then a couple months later I'm walking through an
[16:05.480 --> 16:10.160]  airport and there's USA Today with the cover Indians discover water by crashing
[16:10.160 --> 16:13.800]  the probe in and then it sent up the ice crystals another probe you know that
[16:13.800 --> 16:18.720]  dropped that probe flew back by and picked up the ice crystals there's the
[16:18.720 --> 16:22.340]  headline India's first lunar mission finds water on the moon but when Buzz
[16:22.340 --> 16:30.920]  Aldrin came on the show he goes we need to land a probe on Mars's one moon and
[16:30.920 --> 16:40.200]  there you'll find the monolith and it was probably put there by an advanced
[16:40.200 --> 16:46.160]  intelligence and that's all I can tell you that off air I'm like come on talk
[16:46.160 --> 16:51.840]  more about it he goes no no no that's all I can say it's all I can say and then
[16:51.840 --> 16:57.880]  I have this this conversation at Charlie Sheen's house with him and I mean it's
[16:57.880 --> 17:02.040]  Buzz Aldrin folks I got it punches people out that says he didn't go the moon and
[17:02.040 --> 17:06.600]  and of course I knew Raymond T he died I guess it was earlier this year late last
[17:06.600 --> 17:10.240]  year what a sweetheart he was you know he was on the main Mars mission I mean
[17:10.240 --> 17:15.520]  main moon missions ran the RCA cameras on the moon ran the sky lab cameras the
[17:15.520 --> 17:19.800]  space shuttle cameras I mean he was mission one command he said no we were
[17:19.800 --> 17:24.520]  there but then he said I can't tell you the other stuff it's just you're dead on
[17:24.520 --> 17:28.720]  it's more advanced so basically they've got tinker toy missions that they show
[17:28.720 --> 17:33.200]  you piggybacked with real missions on top of it and that's what dr. Bob Bowman
[17:33.200 --> 17:37.840]  who died about a year ago nuclear physicist fighter bomber pilot vietnam
[17:37.840 --> 17:43.320]  just another amazing individual that's exactly what he said but the monolith
[17:43.320 --> 17:46.720]  and I didn't mean I don't know why I went off of this low support news today
[17:46.720 --> 17:50.800]  it's just that I see the story up on drudge report calm it's also up on
[17:50.800 --> 17:56.080]  info wars.com NASA humans will prove we are not alone in the universe within 20
[17:56.080 --> 17:58.240]  years
[17:58.600 --> 18:05.400]  well whether it's a blue beam psi op or whatever it is and maybe it isn't true
[18:05.400 --> 18:08.960]  maybe it's a psi op you know Ronald Reagan the Pope they've all been saying
[18:08.960 --> 18:12.560]  you know outside aliens will unify us and the rest of it Kissinger said that
[18:12.560 --> 18:18.960]  for world government they have you in studies about it Lenin LaRouge wanted to
[18:18.960 --> 18:23.520]  put a space-based system up in the 70s to unify the world around asteroid and
[18:23.520 --> 18:27.600]  comet repulsion or shootdowns thought that was a way to bring the planet
[18:27.600 --> 18:32.680]  together and that was picked up by the CIA that plan in the early 70s that's in
[18:32.680 --> 18:39.520]  the Washington Post by the way that's not LaRouge saying that and it was
[18:39.520 --> 18:46.240]  actually the cover then to put up space planes with a global decapitation system
[18:46.240 --> 18:52.080]  to decapitate state leaders in one hour was the plan back in 79 with over a
[18:52.080 --> 18:59.080]  hundred of these space planes with DU Sabo Sabo decapitator weapons again
[18:59.080 --> 19:03.760]  they can shoot let's say your base is two miles under a mountain because you

[25:23.280 --> 25:27.600]  the headlines here so you know what's coming up but a staff sergeant retired
[25:27.600 --> 25:33.320]  Joe Biggs gonna be in studio giving us his take on Beau Bergdahl supposedly
[25:33.320 --> 25:39.320]  held for years by the Taliban al Qaeda and we said look like a staged ex
[25:39.320 --> 25:43.400]  filtration probably with an al Qaeda cell controlled by the west it's just like
[25:43.400 --> 25:48.920]  ISIS is we've seen this before being released and we said he'll just be
[25:48.920 --> 25:51.880]  basically put back on the general public if that's the case they'll have
[25:51.880 --> 25:56.640]  some new distraction about will he be tried for murder you know aiding and
[25:56.640 --> 26:03.680]  abetting enemy combatants or whatever I don't think so this was done to cover up
[26:03.680 --> 26:07.040]  the VA scandal but we'll get Joe Biggs take on that but what's really important
[26:07.040 --> 26:12.680]  coming up is Joe has all these incredible videos and photos of stuff he did in
[26:12.680 --> 26:17.920]  Afghanistan and Iraq that's never before been seen and I said man you got to put
[26:17.920 --> 26:25.520]  this out on air I know Esquire wrote some articles about it but you really need
[26:25.520 --> 26:30.000]  to release some of this so is it what do they got a release and I said well this
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.320]  van full of plastic explosives with US passports and how they were gonna come
[26:34.320 --> 26:38.520]  basically bomb the US you know the fact that there were real terrorists we'd
[26:38.520 --> 26:42.480]  like to know about that so you're gonna see photos of that if you're a TV viewer
[26:42.480 --> 26:46.080]  radio listener you'll hear about it and then about tonight it'll be on the
[26:46.080 --> 26:49.400]  nightly news the video and then posted for everybody about Amara with an
[26:49.400 --> 26:55.440]  article and info wars dot com but Joe is gonna start making contact with all
[26:55.440 --> 26:58.600]  these military people that are already sending us videos photos he'll be
[26:58.600 --> 27:04.520]  vetting it and bring on all this battlefield footage and photos that
[27:04.520 --> 27:09.440]  never see a lot of day both from the past and currently and he's helping us
[27:09.440 --> 27:15.280]  go through all of that so that'll certainly freak out the Pentagon but
[27:15.280 --> 27:21.800]  that is coming up in the next segment real news real journalism that's what
[27:21.800 --> 27:25.960]  we do just like we went down and bar patrol says that the illegals are being
[27:25.960 --> 27:29.320]  let in they're bringing them deeper in the country we talked to our source to
[27:29.320 --> 27:33.160]  tell us where to go there are the buses pulling up on the Mexican side they get
[27:33.160 --> 27:37.040]  on US buses the board patrol gives them money and the illegals are bus deeper in
[27:37.040 --> 27:42.800]  that was four weeks ago now national news that's what we do and we just go
[27:42.800 --> 27:46.040]  where the news takes us we don't go get a new story and then say well we don't
[27:46.040 --> 27:50.240]  agree with this politically so we're gonna cover it up we just put it out
[27:50.240 --> 27:55.800]  there and let the chips fall where they may because this is bigger than just
[27:55.800 --> 28:00.600]  the listeners are bigger than myself it's about the truth and it's about that
[28:00.600 --> 28:05.040]  journey and that discovery of what really is true knowing yourself knowing
[28:05.040 --> 28:09.200]  others and what are the secrets of the universe and what's really going on
[28:09.200 --> 28:14.240]  because in the battle against the globalist tyrants it's gonna be reality
[28:14.240 --> 28:19.480]  not not illusion not delusion not propaganda that is going to save this
[28:19.480 --> 28:24.520]  country and this world in our minds we are trapped in a type of purgatory I
[28:24.520 --> 28:29.400]  woke up about 4 a.m. this morning I just thought you know the earth is
[28:29.400 --> 28:37.600]  purgatory it's it's it's where you're tested it's where the decision is made
[28:37.600 --> 28:46.400]  by you about which side you're gonna choose to be on and all of us have our
[28:46.400 --> 28:55.480]  struggles every day with evil but what matters is which way your heart turns
[28:55.480 --> 29:02.800]  like David a man after God's own heart did a lot of terrible things but truly
[29:02.800 --> 29:10.240]  repented and truly was taken over by his flesh and had courage I'll tell you
[29:10.240 --> 29:18.120]  this folks God hates a coward and the universe hates a coward whenever you
[29:18.120 --> 29:23.760]  want to call it now coming up Dick Cheney this is rich says Obama has
[29:23.760 --> 29:28.160]  exceeded constitutional authority by use of executive power he's the guy that
[29:28.160 --> 29:32.400]  argued that even the vice president had unlimited power but you know it's getting
[29:32.400 --> 29:37.880]  bad when Dick Cheney that is the pot calling the kettle black probably a
[29:37.880 --> 29:41.240]  singing incident was a racist statement it wasn't it's no staying like you know
[29:41.240 --> 29:46.560]  watch pots never boil or it's what's another word of being a total hypocrite

[34:22.080 --> 34:26.520]  more high level from the nsa to blow the whistle than him and that's william
[34:26.520 --> 34:31.200]  benney who was number four over the agency telling the london guardian last

[34:51.600 --> 34:55.880]  inside on what's happening in syria right now is what we're busy watching i
[34:55.880 --> 35:02.000]  reckon I just run around murdering everybody blowing up mos churches killing
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.440]  men women and children crucifying people their normal activity and as our
[35:07.440 --> 35:12.080]  media basically doesn't even expose the fact that the government runs them all
[35:12.080 --> 35:17.360]  that's happening they're still attacking areas of africa and syria and
[35:17.360 --> 35:20.480]  they're still trying to destabilize to the muslim brotherhood this allied with
[35:20.480 --> 35:26.960]  them Egypt and boy of Egypt falls that's a big circus the ceasefire was broken by
[35:26.960 --> 35:33.960]  the different organizations Hamas mainly in Gaza firing more rockets against
[35:33.960 --> 35:39.360]  Israel people say how dare Israel bomb Gaza I don't like seeing civilian areas
[35:39.360 --> 35:45.920]  being bombed but who's launching the rockets and why is Hamas doing that when
[35:45.920 --> 35:51.400]  Israel then comes up and blows up their infrastructure because Hamas is tied in
[35:51.400 --> 35:55.840]  with the UN and the globalist and those political leaders are being paid ladies
[35:55.840 --> 36:01.400]  and gentlemen to destabilize and undermine their own people and that's
[36:01.400 --> 36:06.800]  come out you can search Israel created fake al-qaeda groups in peace process
[36:06.800 --> 36:15.480]  Jerusalem post 1998 when they say Israel that means criminal elements when the
[36:15.480 --> 36:20.160]  Israeli government and our own government does this as well because
[36:20.160 --> 36:24.920]  what's the goal keep the political class in power keep Obama in power keep the
[36:24.920 --> 36:31.880]  NSA in power keep the CIA in power but most people in the Israeli government the
[36:31.880 --> 36:36.240]  US government you name it are not bad people it's tiny groups that want
[36:36.240 --> 36:43.280]  destabilization look at Saudi Arabia caught red-handed funding ISIS who may
[36:43.280 --> 36:47.520]  want to overthrow them it's a very dangerous game that's why it's always
[36:47.520 --> 36:52.040]  stabbing in the back and double-dealing and flipping sides there's no honor
[36:52.040 --> 36:55.760]  among thieves the British Empire called it the great game of
[36:55.760 --> 37:03.000]  Balkanization or divide and conquer literally hundreds of textbooks from
[37:03.000 --> 37:08.440]  the 1700s on until the 60s that are public don't look it up we're written
[37:08.440 --> 37:15.040]  four technocrats of the British Empire to understand this and books have been
[37:15.040 --> 37:19.200]  written here like tragedy and hope that we sell back in print only a thousand
[37:19.200 --> 37:23.440]  were printed the plates were destroyed Patriots reverse engineered it fought
[37:23.440 --> 37:28.880]  the lawsuits and reprinted it and we have it 1,100 pages long tragedy and
[37:28.880 --> 37:33.560]  hope Carol Quigley head of Georgetown political science admitting everything I
[37:33.560 --> 37:38.480]  just told you Brzezinski's written five books telling you everything I just told
[37:38.480 --> 37:43.040]  you because it's meant for the elite they think you're so stupid you'll never
[37:43.040 --> 37:46.680]  read the Anglo-American establishment or tragedy and hope by Carol Quigley
[37:46.680 --> 37:50.720]  you'll never read the technotronic era written in the 70s by the Ziggie
[37:50.720 --> 37:57.400]  Brzezinski you read that little 250-page book it all came true because the
[37:57.400 --> 38:01.840]  bigger Brzezinski's one of about five master technicians of the
[38:01.840 --> 38:06.160]  technocracy that we know of who literally were given the full Rothschild
[38:06.160 --> 38:15.800]  Rockefeller Leggett imperial governor power to chart our world government
[38:15.800 --> 38:18.960]  running narcotics government breaking up the family government weather control
[38:18.960 --> 38:22.120]  it's all in his book when did he write technotronic era
[38:22.120 --> 38:32.920]  technotronic age I forget I read it when I was like 14 people say how do I know
[38:32.920 --> 38:36.200]  all this stuff because criminals brag ladies and gentlemen they write
[38:36.200 --> 38:40.400]  blueprints people always say something this big would come out it would come
[38:40.400 --> 38:45.280]  out that the CIA put Mao Zedong in declassified it would come out that our
[38:45.280 --> 38:49.320]  governments behind Al Qaeda public it would come out they're putting cancer
[38:49.320 --> 38:53.440]  viruses and many vaccines public it would come out fluoride lowers IQ and
[38:53.440 --> 38:58.640]  causes cancer Harvard Harvard Medical Journal public last year public public
[38:58.640 --> 39:04.440]  public public public public public public public it's all public public public
[39:04.440 --> 39:09.720]  of most of its public what we know is so off the charts that I I don't even want
[39:09.720 --> 39:17.560]  to imagine what else these people are up to now all they're doing is battling
[39:17.560 --> 39:22.480]  with each other in the fortune of 100 and the governing class battling with
[39:22.480 --> 39:29.120]  each other to try to get control of the levers we're not even in the game now
[39:29.120 --> 39:34.600]  and all I'm trying to do is get the public to get in the game now what's
[39:34.600 --> 39:42.040]  coming up after we cover Bob Bergdahl being put back on active duty I'm gonna
[39:42.040 --> 39:44.840]  talk about that in a moment and then we're gonna get to this breaking news
[39:44.840 --> 39:50.920]  with Joe Beggs a new special report he's put out but then coming up US
[39:50.920 --> 39:54.680]  government editing Wikipedia the smear independent media caught red-handed
[39:54.680 --> 39:59.640]  saying I'm a Russian agent with no proof on the website directly from
[39:59.640 --> 40:10.040]  Capitol Hill separately Elgin Air Force Base Eglin Air Force Base busted
[40:10.040 --> 40:15.040]  gaming Reddit evidence of web manipulation by specific military
[40:15.040 --> 40:21.720]  installation here's another one Snowden files manipulating polls and net netting
[40:21.720 --> 40:29.640]  from LinkedIn YouTube and GCHQ bag of tricks that's in England just gaming
[40:29.640 --> 40:33.440]  everything that's what they do it's called sock puppets that's who attacks us
[40:33.440 --> 40:40.000]  Snowden files it's all coming out and the Pentagon announced about a year ago
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.680]  they're gonna be involved in psyops against the American people openly that
[40:44.680 --> 40:48.400]  means paying off local media paying off bloggers you're gonna see a lot of turn
[40:48.400 --> 40:53.240]  coding going on right now it's getting to be a very dangerous situation as they
[40:53.240 --> 40:56.400]  enter the final phase trying to take this country down now what's really big
[40:56.400 --> 41:01.760]  news is his special report we're about to play it's a new series he's gonna be
[41:01.760 --> 41:06.520]  putting out every week or so with his own video and photos but also with
[41:06.520 --> 41:10.480]  information that comes to us public videos online that he'll be reviewing
[41:10.480 --> 41:15.640]  we've already done some of that with Staff Sergeant retired Joe Biggs we saw
[41:15.640 --> 41:22.240]  combat in Afghanistan and Iraq and he's here with us today of course he came to
[41:22.240 --> 41:24.920]  our attention not just from those articles few years ago but he was also
[41:24.920 --> 41:28.880]  good friends with Michael Hastings it was clearly killed the others is
[41:28.880 --> 41:34.240]  overwhelming and himself was probably a CIA cutout certainly his wife worked at
[41:34.240 --> 41:38.640]  the National Security Council in the Star Chamber secret meetings and I mean
[41:38.640 --> 41:42.240]  just give me a break folks it's off the charts I mean that's that's that that is
[41:42.240 --> 41:46.560]  the that is the government and he helped expose all that so he now works here in
[41:46.560 --> 41:50.320]  Austin moved down here from the Carolinas and he's gonna start this new
[41:50.320 --> 41:53.560]  report but just a few minutes on burgdoll I mean for those that don't know
[41:53.560 --> 41:56.360]  explain to people I mean you I mean you don't just end up a couple years with
[41:56.360 --> 42:00.120]  Taliban al-Qaeda and then a month after you're back no one can talk to you
[42:00.120 --> 42:03.520]  because you're mentally ill or you know you you know you can't even talk but now
[42:03.520 --> 42:07.840]  you're back on active duty what do you think this was all about Joe Biggs I
[42:07.840 --> 42:11.440]  mean he definitely had to be some kind of CIA asset I mean to stay with the
[42:11.440 --> 42:14.800]  Akhani network for as long as he did without getting his head cut off without
[42:14.800 --> 42:20.400]  being physically tortured they're saying that he is but clearly you can see when
[42:20.400 --> 42:23.840]  he gets off that helicopter and he's brought in US custody he's walking
[42:23.840 --> 42:27.800]  around fine he's standing up on his own the story didn't fit no off and said I'm
[42:27.800 --> 42:30.440]  leaving and went and joined him yeah that's what every soldier in his unit
[42:30.440 --> 42:35.280]  said that he left a note he walked off and he had intent to contact Taliban
[42:35.280 --> 42:40.040]  spoke English and go and live with them he was an infiltrator and this was all
[42:40.040 --> 42:46.080]  announced two days after the CIA section chief's cover was blown in cobbled yes
[42:46.080 --> 42:50.200]  exactly that was the reason why it was important to get him out of there I mean
[42:50.200 --> 42:53.720]  he wasn't in danger why wasn't he in danger those whole you know nearly five
[42:53.720 --> 42:57.120]  years he was over there if he was in such bad condition why didn't they get him
[42:57.120 --> 43:02.160]  out before you know it's it's clearly to also another way for them to cover that
[43:02.160 --> 43:05.720]  VA scandal that was hitting them so hard a congressman Mick Mulvaney out of
[43:05.720 --> 43:09.360]  South Carolina said that there's a email going around and I read this in an
[43:09.360 --> 43:12.920]  article on the on the internet the other day that said from the White House VA
[43:12.920 --> 43:16.960]  scandal is killing us and we need to move on the burglar trade without going
[43:16.960 --> 43:20.880]  through Congress so clearly like you said the video that we made a while back
[43:20.880 --> 43:24.480]  saying that the Beau burglar situation was a distraction from the VA this whole
[43:24.480 --> 43:28.560]  thing is just one big nothing adds up at all whatsoever I think that was the
[43:28.560 --> 43:32.880]  Washington examiner had that yeah that and politicics a few other ones what
[43:32.880 --> 43:37.840]  else you got on this but I mean one of the things too was everyone says he
[43:37.840 --> 43:41.840]  deserted everyone in that unit so how and you called me on a Saturday and I
[43:41.840 --> 43:44.920]  said don't go with it yeah that you got guys that were in the unit with him yeah
[43:44.920 --> 43:47.940]  and they said it was all staged and I said well let's just not go with your
[43:47.940 --> 43:50.880]  buddies yet I'm sure you're right let's wait till Monday and now it's
[43:50.880 --> 43:54.040]  everywhere everyone knows these guys have all come out and told their stories
[43:54.040 --> 43:58.960]  and yet there's still this investigation to find out if he is a deserter or truly
[43:58.960 --> 44:02.880]  a POW and they find to be a POW in which they probably will because it's
[44:02.880 --> 44:07.840]  better to have that kind of story he'll get 350,000 of our dollars tax-free you
[44:07.840 --> 44:11.200]  know and he's going to be like you said he's returned active duty and he'll have
[44:11.200 --> 44:16.920]  some desk job somewhere be able to anyone believe that if he'd really been
[44:16.920 --> 44:21.360]  under al-Qaeda Taliban a Connie network and you wouldn't be alive or much less
[44:21.360 --> 44:24.120]  they would just let him out in the public now a month later I mean give me a
[44:24.120 --> 44:28.400]  break yeah it doesn't add up I mean he said to be with those guys those guys
[44:28.400 --> 44:32.200]  were bad hardened criminals like I said they were the Sopranos of Afghanistan
[44:32.200 --> 44:35.840]  they don't play around you know they weren't going to keep him around for that
[44:35.840 --> 44:39.960]  long I just there had to be some kind of inside thing going on we were work he
[44:39.960 --> 44:44.560]  had them deep undercover we were working with them well we know all those groups
[44:44.560 --> 44:48.720]  are heavily infiltrated by criminal rogue networks in the highest levels of
[44:48.720 --> 44:53.800]  intelligence agencies actually funding the leadership of Taliban of al-Qaeda of
[44:53.800 --> 44:59.040]  a Connie in all these double deals opium dealing you name it you know the
[44:59.040 --> 45:05.640]  brother of Karzai Karzai all of this is going on and so there are real real
[45:05.640 --> 45:09.240]  terrorists real groups that attack but generally they're being given funding
[45:09.240 --> 45:13.840]  and support from the military industrial complex globally it's bigger than the
[45:13.840 --> 45:18.400]  US that needs to keep these conflicts going but then they always allow al-Qaeda
[45:18.400 --> 45:23.440]  and Taliban leaders to escape aka the airlift of evil in November of 2001
[45:23.440 --> 45:28.240]  where 40 plus thousand al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders were flown out on C-130s
[45:28.240 --> 45:34.120]  out of Kandahar into Pakistan and paid in gold bars and it's the same story over
[45:34.120 --> 45:37.080]  and over again the opium trade went up there in that time too like tenfold
[45:37.080 --> 45:43.760]  tenfold from 7% to 93% and and again then they moved them into bases in
[45:43.760 --> 45:49.720]  Jordan Turkey and Western Iraq and then now they've let them take most of Iraq
[45:49.720 --> 45:53.360]  and they act like oh we don't know why they're doing this and then they're
[45:53.360 --> 45:57.400]  claiming they're allied with Iran Obama's an ally with Iran with the
[45:57.400 --> 46:01.480]  Prime Minister of Iraq that's pure BS us going to Iraq right now is like
[46:01.480 --> 46:05.720]  inviting an arsonist back to the scene of a crime we started that fire we
[46:05.720 --> 46:08.520]  created everything that's going on there now they're doing it again bringing
[46:08.520 --> 46:12.480]  al-Qaeda who makes Saddam Hussein in my view look like a choir boy yeah
[46:12.480 --> 46:16.880]  exactly it's a mind-blowing that I mean that our country does this stuff all the
[46:16.880 --> 46:21.440]  time well I mean look at al-Qaeda they literally mutilate women they kill kids
[46:21.440 --> 46:25.400]  they murder any Muslim that isn't a radical Christians I mean these people
[46:25.400 --> 46:29.960]  are nutcases they're eating hearts on TV they're just a bunch of criminal scum
[46:29.960 --> 46:33.640]  I mean these people are filth I mean you give them that kind of backing
[46:33.640 --> 46:40.760]  of all Muslims who's the worst Taliban by far a Taliban al-Qaeda yeah but
[46:40.760 --> 46:43.800]  those guys were they're so organized because we've given them the training
[46:43.800 --> 46:48.960]  we train them special forces train them in the 80s and again the quote fight
[46:48.960 --> 46:52.400]  together so the only time like in Iraq that was a bunch of guys popping shots
[46:52.400 --> 46:55.320]  off at you for the most part insurgents farmers picking up guns and
[46:55.320 --> 46:59.280]  shooting in Afghanistan those were well-coordinated attacks they had the
[46:59.280 --> 47:04.880]  weapons they had funding they could get passports it was crazy to see the amount
[47:04.880 --> 47:09.840]  of force they had when they would come at you now are you you were blown up in
[47:09.840 --> 47:15.640]  Afghanistan and Iraq in our vehicles right indeed Iraq Iraq was a pretty
[47:15.640 --> 47:19.800]  nuts though that time one of the times yeah because didn't you get blown up by
[47:19.800 --> 47:22.880]  an ID and then the special forces dug you out and then you got it again yeah
[47:22.880 --> 47:27.560]  that was in Samar Iraq that was one of the holiest cities in Iraq just above
[47:27.560 --> 47:32.720]  Tikrit what happened then I was coming over a bridge and I remember we had been
[47:32.720 --> 47:39.800]  stopped that night prior we're doing a convoy security route down MSR Tampa
[47:39.800 --> 47:47.840]  from Missoulle yeah from or from Tikrit down to a blod and we got stopped
[47:47.840 --> 47:51.480]  because a convoy in front of us got blown up so we're waiting all night and
[47:51.480 --> 47:55.160]  you can't do anything you're stuck on a road everyone's pulling security you're
[47:55.160 --> 47:58.520]  doing your fives and 25s where you look five feet out and they look another 25
[47:58.520 --> 48:01.280]  feet out to make there's no make sure there's no IDs or bombs anywhere around
[48:01.280 --> 48:04.400]  your vehicle and we're sitting there the night goes through and the sun starts
[48:04.400 --> 48:07.240]  coming up and they finally get that that accident cleared up out of the way
[48:07.240 --> 48:11.720]  people are taking the hospital and we're free to go so we're driving down the
[48:11.720 --> 48:15.880]  road and I remember coming over this bridge it's the Samar bypass right over
[48:15.880 --> 48:20.240]  the river and I remember going was the last thing I had Metallica fuel was on
[48:20.240 --> 48:24.080]  in my ear and I'm sitting there driving over the bridge and I remember going
[48:24.080 --> 48:29.640]  that looks like a and just this huge explosion and everything slowed down and
[48:29.640 --> 48:33.200]  I remember seeing a piece of paper like float right past my face and then
[48:33.200 --> 48:36.120]  everything sped up and we were just rocking back and forth flipping down the
[48:36.120 --> 48:41.440]  road the tires were gone my commander was about almost a quarter mile half a
[48:41.440 --> 48:46.400]  mile back and the convoy between fuel trucks and he said the tires blew past
[48:46.400 --> 48:53.440]  him in midair I mean it was chaos and screaming and I had blood coming out of
[48:53.440 --> 48:56.720]  my head I'm throwing up blood and all our members sitting there laying there as a
[48:56.720 --> 49:01.520]  vehicle starts catching on fire banging on the the panels and they're like
[49:01.520 --> 49:05.800]  ripping them off trying to get us out before we burned to death it was the
[49:05.800 --> 49:10.160]  then you said you got hit again right there yeah what happened next well after
[49:10.160 --> 49:13.960]  we got pulled out of special forces from a compound called Brassville Moore came
[49:13.960 --> 49:17.960]  and got us and put me in a Humvee and they start trying to drive me to the
[49:17.960 --> 49:22.200]  hospital real quick and then another explosion right down the road maybe about
[49:22.200 --> 49:27.560]  a mile down the road and around a corner to the right it was just horrible I
[49:27.560 --> 49:31.760]  remember laying outside of that Humvee and I put my back against a tire and I
[49:31.760 --> 49:34.360]  just remember looking up the sky and going like you know what this is it like
[49:34.360 --> 49:38.560]  I'm I don't even I'm not gonna live past this day again now how many months you've
[49:38.560 --> 49:43.240]  been waiting to get into VA coughing up blood every night I mean technically it's

[54:30.360 --> 54:35.960]  the first episode of hard-hitting news coverage of wars and conflicts on the
[54:35.960 --> 54:59.360]  front lines in the trenches with staff sergeant retired Joe Biggs let me tell
[54:59.360 --> 55:03.960]  you a story about a couple years ago when I was in Afghanistan the unit I was
[55:03.960 --> 55:09.320]  with we got a call from our commanding unit back in Salerno Afghanistan and
[55:09.320 --> 55:13.680]  they had intel on what they thought was going to be a possible IED making
[55:13.680 --> 55:17.040]  facility so we get this call and we're kind of thinking like all right you know
[55:17.040 --> 55:20.360]  what are we gonna come across this is gonna be crazy none of us are you know
[55:20.360 --> 55:23.160]  EOD trained we don't know how to deal with explosives that much that's gonna
[55:23.160 --> 55:26.960]  be a little a little crazy going up into this place like that without that kind
[55:26.960 --> 55:29.760]  of training so we got everything gathered all the equipment we could
[55:29.760 --> 55:33.560]  possibly think we would need for something like this and we kind of go to
[55:33.560 --> 55:38.560]  the door and we don't know what to expect at all we walk in and there's this
[55:38.560 --> 55:43.080]  family just regular family there's a I think there was four adult males a
[55:43.080 --> 55:48.800]  couple wives and a whole bunch of kids you know cows goats all this stuff
[55:48.800 --> 55:53.040]  inside this compound area and we're walking around and I'm sitting there
[55:53.040 --> 55:55.840]  thinking this place could be booby trapped every time I took a step I'm
[55:55.840 --> 55:59.280]  sitting there thinking oh my god this would be the last step ever taken my
[55:59.280 --> 56:04.840]  life so we go through we have an initial search of the entire compound we
[56:04.840 --> 56:08.360]  don't find anything at all and usually when we get it intel from the source so
[56:08.360 --> 56:12.880]  we got it from it's usually always been pretty much spot-on never it's never been
[56:12.880 --> 56:16.120]  too far off so I was sitting there thinking you know what I'm gonna get my
[56:16.120 --> 56:21.280]  metal detector so run back out to the m-wrap and I go grab the metal detector
[56:21.280 --> 56:24.440]  and come back in I just start scanning the walls and we immediately start
[56:24.440 --> 56:28.200]  getting hits so we bring out hammers and all that stuff and just start knocking
[56:28.200 --> 56:33.120]  through the walls and what we found was mind-blowing the skin I mean the hair on
[56:33.120 --> 56:37.920]  my skin just popped up I had goosebumps HME which is homemade explosives
[56:37.920 --> 56:43.960]  passports money grenades weapons throughout I mean they had it buried
[56:43.960 --> 56:49.360]  under huge stacks of hay just after we spent time we went through with that
[56:49.360 --> 56:53.920]  detector we found so much stuff and laid it out it was an entire arsenal I mean
[56:53.920 --> 56:58.960]  they had phone books with people's names in New York Circle like Congress
[56:58.960 --> 57:02.440]  people things like that that they had intent they had the money they had the
[57:02.440 --> 57:08.040]  backing they had the explosives to pull it off and it was just nuts and the
[57:08.040 --> 57:11.120]  scariest thing for me was seeing those glass marbles because what happens when
[57:11.120 --> 57:14.960]  something like that blows up and you go in and you get x-rayed you can't pick up
[57:14.960 --> 57:19.840]  glass shards so when that hits you those fragments go in your body those marbles
[57:19.840 --> 57:22.960]  and you're just bleeding the death you just sit there and the doctors are
[57:22.960 --> 57:26.880]  laying around you like you know there's nothing they can do and just to see what
[57:26.880 --> 57:32.520]  they had in the plan you know it wasn't just an IED making facility these guys
[57:32.520 --> 57:36.520]  were planning on doing something over here in America so for all these people
[57:36.520 --> 57:42.080]  that think that a lot of the stuff's made up I mean it's real the threat is out
[57:42.080 --> 57:46.120]  there there's people out there who hate us who want us killed you know I know we
[57:46.120 --> 57:51.680]  funded Taliban back in the day let's remember here the people we are fighting
[57:51.680 --> 57:57.320]  today we funded but these were Taliban guys that had money to do it and they
[57:57.320 --> 58:02.200]  had the motivation to get all that stuff and spend that much time hiding that
[58:02.200 --> 58:05.840]  stuff in their compound putting up these huge fake walls holding all their stuff
[58:05.840 --> 58:09.080]  I just I wake up in the middle of night sometimes just sitting there thinking
[58:09.080 --> 58:12.280]  like oh my god like if we wouldn't have stopped that from happening that could
[58:12.280 --> 58:16.880]  have been another big incident here on our home turf and I'm just glad that we
[58:16.880 --> 58:22.720]  got the intel we did to be able to go out there and stop that from happening
[58:23.440 --> 58:27.880]  all right first installment of that we'll put it up on info wars.com for
[58:27.880 --> 58:31.360]  everybody by the end of the broadcast today with an article it's got a lot of
[58:31.360 --> 58:34.920]  exclusive photos and video that Joe Biggs and other members of this unit shot

[1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:19.560]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:30.080]  Alex Jones all right we mentioned comes up in the next segment and we did find
[1:00:30.080 --> 1:00:34.160]  the clip from 2008 with Dick Cheney saying the president's basically above
[1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:39.120]  the law but now he says Obama has exceeded constitutional authority by
[1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:44.360]  use of executive power which I agree with Dick Cheney on but it's just
[1:00:44.360 --> 1:00:51.440]  literally like Joseph Garble's criticizing Hitler in my view people
[1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:54.880]  like oh Dick Cheney is a conservative really he supported the assault weapons
[1:00:54.880 --> 1:00:58.200]  ban really he wanted to stage a false flag on our ships
[1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:03.240]  start a war with Iran that that came out Cyhurst all you Republicans just in
[1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:07.600]  love with Republicans because they're Republicans make me sick like like like
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:14.880]  Boehner he went along with Obamacare went along with the banker bailout and blocks
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:21.720]  these investigations and blocks impeachment and says oh we're getting a
[1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:26.480]  lot of political points by you know letting Obama stay in you're aiding and
[1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:30.040]  abetting it and that's why we've gotten to this point is the lawyer think of
[1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:35.960]  well just let him get discredited to be be that's a cover story is the same
[1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:40.440]  special interest are trying to buy off the Republicans that have bought off
[1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:45.240]  Obama and by buying off the Democrats versus Republicans you got a bunch of
[1:01:45.240 --> 1:01:49.760]  Tea Party people getting in office at the state and federal level who haven't
[1:01:49.760 --> 1:01:55.800]  been bought off and who are staying true to their principles and winning a lot of
[1:01:55.800 --> 1:02:01.280]  primaries and that's the big issue here we have a chance and I've tried to be a
[1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:04.720]  political purist and not ever endorse the Tea Party even though it came out of
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:09.040]  Ron Paul and the neocons try to take it over that failed the last few years so
[1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:12.640]  now they're trying to kill it you're always seeing Republican leadership
[1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:18.680]  statements oh let's you know be nice to incumbent Republicans Tea Party don't
[1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:23.720]  come after us while big Democratic Party donors give Republican incumbents
[1:02:23.720 --> 1:02:28.360]  money and districts Democrats can't win to keep Tea Party people out okay if
[1:02:28.360 --> 1:02:32.240]  you're not supporting the real Tea Party you're an enemy now this was up
[1:02:32.240 --> 1:02:35.600]  yesterday on infoworks.com I never got to it I want to play it now here's some
[1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:39.360]  of the Chicago residents talking about how angry they are about the open
[1:02:39.360 --> 1:02:44.000]  borders and but it's kind of sad though I mean they think of progressing in life
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:48.200]  of what the government can give them it's so sad here it is he's gonna go down
[1:02:48.200 --> 1:02:54.480]  as being one of the worst presidents ever today if you look at the time that
[1:02:54.480 --> 1:03:00.680]  we brought here to sleep or in the years ago we got the same results today
[1:03:00.680 --> 1:03:05.680]  Amalans by the power police running up and down the street all the violence out of the community
[1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:09.680]  Oh my block it's always dark, it's always sunny today
[1:03:09.680 --> 1:03:16.680]  I can't go outside and play, play, oh my block, oh my block, oh my block
[1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:22.160]  do something for our children have the same love for these young people like you
[1:03:22.160 --> 1:03:26.680]  got for the ones across the border and you want to save them. President Barack
[1:03:26.680 --> 1:03:31.880]  needs to pay attention to Chicago if he cannot pay attention to Chicago in the
[1:03:31.880 --> 1:03:37.120]  African-American community he needs to resign here we got a mayor in our city
[1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:42.200]  and our president United States who have passed legislation and have given up
[1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:47.960]  funding to create opportunities for new citizens to come into United States
[1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:54.040]  ignore people who have been born and raised here with the president a sign
[1:03:54.040 --> 1:04:00.960]  already fund for immigrants and forsaken African-American community and
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:06.120]  African-American families I think that's a disgrace and Barack is from the heart
[1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:12.800]  of 55th in the city of Chicago he saw this as a state senator and he did not
[1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:20.520]  pay attention then. Mr. President we're asking for you you're spending billions
[1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:26.160]  of dollars in Texas but we got a problem he's got your vote lady we would not

[1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:31.240]  well there's a lot of unintentional comedy in the news today but it's actually
[1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:35.480]  intentional by the establishment the same folks that teach kids in the u.s. 2
[1:08:35.480 --> 1:08:43.200]  plus 2 equals 5 White House we've quote substantively substantially improve the
[1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:48.680]  tranquility of the global community White House press secretary John Ernest
[1:08:48.680 --> 1:08:53.520]  said yesterday that the Obama administration's foreign policy in a
[1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:57.480]  number of areas have enhanced the world's tranquility close quote a word
[1:08:57.480 --> 1:09:02.680]  that raises eyebrows as reporters pointed out Gaza Syria Iraq Iran Ukraine
[1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:11.880]  South China Sea but not to be topped dick chaining came out yesterday and dick
[1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:17.600]  Cheney Obama has exceeded constitutional authority by use of executive
[1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:21.680]  power former vice president dick Cheney believes that President Obama has
[1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:24.880]  exceeded his executive authorities granted to him by the Constitution United
[1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:32.520]  States and then it goes on with his quotes just amazing he's just chosen by
[1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:37.520]  himself to set certain parts and provisions aside I don't think he's
[1:09:37.520 --> 1:09:41.560]  exceeded his constitutional authority excuse me I was going back to his old
[1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:45.920]  quote I quote do think he's exceeded his constitutional authority that's the new
[1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:52.080]  quote Cheney said pointing to Obama's actions to alter or ignore enforcing
[1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:58.560]  certain elements of Obamacare and he went on well here he is in 1998 talking
[1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:03.920]  about the Imperial Unitary Executive of his administration that he really ran
[1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:09.760]  Bush mainly played golf and watch Sports Center and here's what Cheney had to
[1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:15.800]  say six years ago but rights to the Congress what constitutional rights to
[1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:20.240]  the Congress and the courts have to limit the power of the president when it
[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:25.160]  comes to these matters of national security the Congress has clearly has
[1:10:25.160 --> 1:10:28.800]  the ability to write statutes and that certain constitutional authorities
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:33.520]  granted in the in the Constitution but I would argue that they do not have the
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:39.680]  right by statute to alter a presidential constitutional power in other
[1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:44.280]  words you can't override his constitutional authorities and responsibilities so
[1:10:44.280 --> 1:10:47.880]  if they want to say he can't survey or he can't detain well they have for
[1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:53.720]  example said pass the war powers act war powers act is still enforced out there
[1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:58.520]  today that requires him to grant certain notifications to the Congress and give
[1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:03.880]  them the authority to supersede those by vote if they want to when it comes to
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:07.920]  committing troops you know it's funny I am miss spoken said 1998 because I'm
[1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:13.240]  teleprompter free here I mean I'm really going over the news here that was in 2008
[1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:19.800]  six years ago but Obama's so bad that what Cheney was saying was actually true
[1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:23.880]  they would at least get a tacit approval though it wasn't fully
[1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:28.080]  constitutional they weren't going and getting a declaration of war but they
[1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:32.280]  would get some type of resolution from Congress authorizing all of their
[1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:38.880]  different Imperial military operations and looting operations because the
[1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:42.520]  journey for these people is the destination it's making trillions of
[1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:46.920]  dollars in no bid contracts he stabilized in the world but Obama is so
[1:11:46.920 --> 1:11:52.200]  bad now that he's actually doing what Cheney said he couldn't do and just
[1:11:52.200 --> 1:11:56.720]  completely ignoring Congress and even Ron Paul said last Friday here that
[1:11:56.720 --> 1:12:00.960]  Obama has gone further than anybody else Jonathan Turley who's kind of a
[1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:06.320]  liberal has said that and again I'm not here on some bandwagon just demonizing
[1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:12.160]  with Democrats it's just that they're making a go right now to basically show
[1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:15.840]  up the country and not even have a second party out there we need a third
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:20.240]  fourth party but instead you've got the Republican and Democratic leadership
[1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:24.840]  working together to kill the libertarian movement that's getting a lot of people
[1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:29.960]  elected to the Republican Party and they don't like that and that's why the
[1:12:29.960 --> 1:12:33.640]  Democrats and Republicans are lined up against them so we're gonna get Wayne
[1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:38.560]  Madsen's take on that and a lot more in the balance of the hour and coming up
[1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:42.040]  at the bottom of the hour I'm gonna give the phone number out and take some
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:47.560]  calls for Wayne Madsen Wayne Madsen report.com excellent website he's
[1:12:47.560 --> 1:12:51.800]  testified to Congress he's testified to legislators he's testified to the EU he's
[1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:55.600]  written for some of the biggest newspapers in at the United States the
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:13:00.640]  Houston Chronicle Philadelphia Inquirer Miami Herald the Village Voice the
[1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:05.360]  online journal info wars.com and he was a witness for the US House
[1:13:05.360 --> 1:13:09.760]  representatives on the UN criminal tribunal for Rwanda an expert on
[1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:13.600]  terrorism as well as testified to Congress but he's also someone who blew
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:18.600]  the whistle back in the late 90s on the NSA there's only one person more senior
[1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:24.280]  because he headed up a whole department of the NSA internal security and that is
[1:13:24.280 --> 1:13:28.800]  William Benny who was in the very top echelon some estimates are number four
[1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:33.160]  in the NSA at that time when he resigned and he said the ultimate goal over the
[1:13:33.160 --> 1:13:39.200]  weekend London Guardian of the NSA is total population control when he left
[1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:43.760]  he said at least 80% of audio calls are being recorded not just metadata and
[1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:47.800]  they're being stored in the US says whistleblower William Benny who we've
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:51.680]  interviewed here on the broadcast I want to get him back on David Knight is
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:56.560]  interviewing he says it's part of a totalitarian mentality and so I wanted
[1:13:56.560 --> 1:14:01.240]  to get Wayne Madsen on about that and where all this is going but first
[1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:05.720]  geopolitically you've traveled to Syria Iraq you've traveled to Libya when it was
[1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:10.000]  under bombardment I know you've traveled to Indonesia you've traveled the world
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  and you can you'll give us your expert take from your perspective on what's
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:21.320]  geopolitically happening and all the the arms build up the bullets the armored
[1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:26.960]  vehicles the I forgot to get to this Obama for the first time is now ready the
[1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:31.480]  internet kill switch that's really what it does and put the quote national alert
[1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:36.960]  code in for emergency messages to turn your TV on to turn your cell phone on
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:43.240]  and to force video and audio messages that's in the Hill newspapers today they
[1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:47.680]  are really gearing up they're announcing in the US and Europe bail ins that they
[1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:52.600]  started the Cyprus to now take money out of your account I mean clearly they're
[1:14:52.600 --> 1:14:56.360]  moving on all fronts towards a global crisis Russia is threatening to attack
[1:14:56.360 --> 1:15:00.640]  Ukraine after they got shelled you've got ISIS running around everywhere
[1:15:00.640 --> 1:15:04.960]  murdering people killing tens of thousands blowing up churches and mosque
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:10.800]  our government's publicly behind that it appears that they're going into
[1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:15.880]  overdrive that we've seen nothing yet Wayne Madsen geopolitically what are we
[1:15:15.880 --> 1:15:19.840]  facing right now it seems to be the globalists are making their big move
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:26.000]  well it's a big met mess going on Alex I mean it's it was crazy to hear Josh
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.680]  Ernest talk about how the Obama administration of states world a more
[1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:37.640]  twang tranquil place when yeah we have the situation now and in Iraq where the
[1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:48.960]  US help trainees I ISL IL ISIL ISIS now called the the caliphate the Islamic
[1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:54.720]  state the caliphate these were these guys were trained in Jordan and in Turkey
[1:15:54.720 --> 1:16:00.240]  and we had John and saying McCain John McCain is seen with these guys he
[1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:03.640]  actually snuck into Syria last year and had his picture taken with some of these
[1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:10.440]  characters he loves these guys I mean John McCain as it seems like any time
[1:16:10.440 --> 1:16:15.320]  there's a terrorist anywhere he's embracing the terrorists and and now
[1:16:15.320 --> 1:16:20.920]  now we've got the situation where you know some of Saddam's guys in Iraq join
[1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:27.520]  these caliphate jihadis to go against the Maliki government in Baghdad and now
[1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:31.560]  you've got the Saddam people saying hey wait a minute these guys are crazier than
[1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:36.880]  we we thought and now they're fighting each other it's it's a man that's just
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:43.320]  Iraq then we have Ukraine where the US supported the coup that resulted in all
[1:16:43.320 --> 1:16:50.880]  these civilian deaths now the regime in Kiev attacking civilian targets and
[1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:58.080]  in eastern Ukraine we've got Putin it in South America in Brazil to be exact
[1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:04.880]  announcing with the other BRICS countries Brazil Russia India China they're
[1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:09.200]  accelerating away from the dollar they are and one of the topics because the
[1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:14.000]  BRICS secretary has sent me a copy of that their items of discussion and for
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:19.200]  delays of Brazil and one of them is institutional international financial
[1:17:19.200 --> 1:17:23.880]  institution reform so clearly they don't like what the World Bank is doing and
[1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:28.680]  the IMF and and the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve and they're
[1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:33.880]  getting together to fight against this these of international financial
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:37.640]  institutions and create their own institutions and I think that's a good
[1:17:37.640 --> 1:17:42.640]  idea that the good thing is that the US is nowhere on the at the table and in
[1:17:42.640 --> 1:17:48.480]  these meetings being conducted in Brazil but every single South American leader
[1:17:48.480 --> 1:17:54.980]  is present including ones that ostensibly have voice support for us
[1:17:54.980 --> 1:17:59.760]  they're all there talking to Putin he's also talking to some other world leaders
[1:17:59.760 --> 1:18:04.240]  that happen to be in Brazil for the final game of the World Cup so he's he's
[1:18:04.240 --> 1:18:09.080]  running circles you know they talk about Obama being able to play 11 dimension
[1:18:09.080 --> 1:18:15.440]  chess but he always thinks ahead Obama can't he you know he against Putin
[1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:22.840]  Obama can't play any kind of strategic game including the one that the Russians
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:29.800]  a master at and that's chess Obama is not even a one-dimensional chess player
[1:18:29.800 --> 1:18:33.600]  let alone 11 dimensional well it's being reported by Democratic members of
[1:18:33.600 --> 1:18:39.120]  Congress in major headlines that Obama is lackadaisical angry won't talk to
[1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:43.640]  anybody just wants to vacation and watch TV all day so I think it's clear that
[1:18:43.640 --> 1:18:49.640]  he's not running anything who's running the show well it's his assistance it's
[1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:57.160]  people like Valerie Jarrett his who was his domestic advisor but clearly she
[1:18:57.160 --> 1:19:05.200]  also plays a role in foreign policy and and and basically it's it's her I hear
[1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:08.760]  Michelle calls the shots because her relation she has a very close
[1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:13.560]  relationship with Valerie Jarrett so basically it's these two individuals
[1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:19.560]  running the show in the White House and and and even the chief of staff is is
[1:19:19.560 --> 1:19:26.400]  it's kind of a meaningless individual I mean nobody even knows who he is that's
[1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:28.800]  stunning because I know you're up there on Capitol Hill and you've never
[1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:33.360]  stirred us wrong you're saying Michelle Obama has more to do with what's going
[1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:38.040]  on than Obama yeah yeah with Valerie Jarrett's assistant really Valerie Jarrett
[1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:42.760]  as well as it's you know if you can get a FaceTime with Valerie Jarrett if you're
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:46.560]  a lobbyist you're gonna get a lot done it doesn't do you any good to get you're
[1:19:46.560 --> 1:19:50.640]  saying you're saying they're all busy basically running swindles as the world
[1:19:50.640 --> 1:19:57.680]  burns oh yeah get ready for the big Obama library and and and stay there

[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:34.480]  testified to Congress you name it but back then the power structure was smart
[1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:39.840]  they wouldn't give news coverage to it now they they try to arrest you so that
[1:24:39.840 --> 1:24:46.320]  forces coverage so it does show the craziness of the establishment they
[1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:52.200]  have a method to their madness but still they have knowledge but not wisdom I
[1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:55.760]  think it's the best way to put it and this is your chance to talk to an NSA
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:25:00.440]  whistleblower and ask your questions coming up geopolitically on the NSA on

[1:25:24.760 --> 1:25:29.320]  the time we have left in this segment what do you make of William Benny's
[1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:34.720]  statement that it's about total authoritarian totalitarianism he uses
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:42.720]  those words total control that it's part of population control a totalitarian
[1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:46.800]  mentality I mean that's what it is people you understand all the spying is
[1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:53.080]  illegal they got caught lying but that it's pointed at good people that don't
[1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:57.040]  want Goldman Sachs involved in insider trading I mean it's really the political
[1:25:57.040 --> 1:26:01.440]  corporate criminal class in my view that just wants to be above the law and be
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:06.200]  allowed to arrest their detractors I mean I mean this is we're living in a
[1:26:06.200 --> 1:26:11.400]  James Bond villain movie aren't we Wayne oh absolutely I know Bill Benny and I
[1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:17.440]  chat it with them in person just about a month or so ago a month and a half ago
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:25.880]  and actually what he says is true and now we have some actual documentation to
[1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:32.720]  show and illustrate what Bill Benny's talking about and there's been a recent
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:38.040]  drip of these documents so the Ed Snowden documents and I'm really concerned
[1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:42.480]  about how slowly these are being released that this latest set should have been
[1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:48.680]  released a long long time ago and what it what the this document is it's from an
[1:26:48.680 --> 1:26:56.240]  internal Wikipedia system used by the British GCHU that's in UK's NSA
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:00.400]  counterpart a group there called the Joint Threat Research Intelligence
[1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:07.680]  Group or J-Trigg has this thing called GC Wiki where they've listed all these
[1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:15.000]  tools that they use to not only surveil social media but to corrupt social
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:21.160]  media this is a toolbox for hackers now they've got all I don't know who blocks
[1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:24.440]  these names out I guess it's Greenwell like I think Greenwell must a kind of
[1:27:24.440 --> 1:27:29.680]  separate deal through Pierre Omidyar for that hundred million dollars for that
[1:27:29.680 --> 1:27:34.280]  first look site that they started because all the names of these British
[1:27:34.280 --> 1:27:42.240]  individuals at GCHU that are involved in this attack these attacks on the
[1:27:42.240 --> 1:27:46.280]  internet have their names blocked out and why I find that is that's important
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:51.720]  is that the obviously the NSA is using the Brits to come after the United
[1:27:51.720 --> 1:28:01.040]  States US citizens because they don't the Brits don't have to comply with any
[1:28:01.040 --> 1:28:05.600]  sort of US laws and I've been like that for a long time on illegal stuff like
[1:28:05.600 --> 1:28:09.360]  they'll use British hit teams over here US hit teams over there because it
[1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:13.760]  creates another membrane of plausible deniability that's right and that's what
[1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:18.000]  the five eyes of Britain Canada UK Australian New Zealand are all about
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:26.600]  they they don't of course we say we don't spy on them but that's ridiculous
[1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:32.720]  we they spy on one another to evade their own domestic laws and that's
[1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:38.400]  exactly what's going on here with this Jake these J-Trigg software tools that
[1:28:38.400 --> 1:28:44.600]  are hacker tools I think that the computer fraud and abuse act in 1986 makes
[1:28:44.600 --> 1:28:48.760]  the use of any of these tools against US citizens illegal actually against
[1:28:48.760 --> 1:28:53.360]  anyone in the United States illegal because that's the law of the land
[1:28:53.360 --> 1:29:00.000]  there's other privacy laws that also what we could bring civil charges against
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:04.600]  these Brits at GCHQ that are using the software against American citizens
[1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:08.880]  that's why the names are blocked out so I I would I would challenge so they're
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:12.160]  not just illegally scooping up the data once it leaves your computer or
[1:29:12.160 --> 1:29:16.360]  network they're breaking into your business breaking in without warrants
[1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:20.640]  and sneaking peaks and they're also planting stuff we know about the black
[1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:24.160]  male ops in the Pentagon putting child porn on tens of thousands of computers
[1:29:24.160 --> 1:29:27.920]  but then blackmail everybody and that's what they're doing and they have all
[1:29:27.920 --> 1:29:33.200]  these tools under a program called shaping and honey pots well what do you
[1:29:33.200 --> 1:29:37.320]  think that is honey pots stay there let's walk through this because days
[1:29:37.320 --> 1:29:40.640]  after this breaks in the Guardian didn't really break you talked about it years

[1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:01.320]  Uh huh
[1:34:01.320 --> 1:34:03.320]  Excuse me folks, I'm sorry
[1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:06.320]  Uh huh
[1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:09.320]  Tell them Vince
[1:34:09.320 --> 1:34:12.320]  Alright ladies and gentlemen
[1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:17.320]  I get a little bit excited sometimes when we're having big victories against tyranny
[1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:23.320]  The fact that all this is coming out and that more and more is coming out could bring down the globalist
[1:34:23.320 --> 1:34:31.320]  Because they're definitely using all these tools to suppress dissent, to game the stock market and shut down our economy
[1:34:31.320 --> 1:34:35.320]  I mean I don't like the Russians or the Chinese incredibly corrupt governments
[1:34:35.320 --> 1:34:44.320]  But America and England we do it bigger and better and our elites are more sophisticated, more evil, more out of control
[1:34:44.320 --> 1:34:49.320]  And are really screwing over the little guy as a tool of political control
[1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:54.320]  And that's why I'm so mad at them, I mean I want my checks and balances back
[1:34:54.320 --> 1:34:59.320]  I'm super creeped out being on the White House Enemies list for three years, publicly that's been in the news
[1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:03.320]  I'm creeped out that we got hit by the Pentagon yesterday
[1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:10.320]  And a whole bunch of other groups got publicly hit and that they admitted last year they're operating domestically and changed the law
[1:35:10.320 --> 1:35:14.320]  But there's a backfire in that, I want to talk to Wayne Madsen in a moment about that
[1:35:14.320 --> 1:35:19.320]  The average person in the government including the NSA is not a bad person
[1:35:19.320 --> 1:35:21.320]  And they're really freaked out by what's going on
[1:35:21.320 --> 1:35:25.320]  And they realize man this is real authoritarianism
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:30.320]  We have the headlines up on infowars.com, U.S. government editing Wikipedia, despair independent media
[1:35:30.320 --> 1:35:33.320]  Alex Jones at the top of the list
[1:35:33.320 --> 1:35:38.320]  Eglin Air Force Base, busted gaming reddit
[1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:41.320]  Snowden Files, manipulating polls
[1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:46.320]  Netting from LinkedIn, YouTube and GCHQ, bag of tricks
[1:35:46.320 --> 1:35:48.320]  That's what Wayne Madsen was talking about
[1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:51.320]  Folks we have IP people here, you know IT people
[1:35:51.320 --> 1:35:58.320]  They can go and look, we check with top hackers and people, some of which we have consulting for us
[1:35:58.320 --> 1:36:02.320]  Looking at what comes in and it's just old hat news
[1:36:02.320 --> 1:36:09.320]  That we have agencies, foreign agencies, German agencies, British agencies
[1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:14.320]  Viacom, Soros groups, Congress
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:18.320]  Hacking people's websites and blaming it on us and trying to leave tracks to us
[1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:22.320]  Spoofing our IP addresses and threatening police
[1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:24.320]  Just you name it, it's continual
[1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:28.320]  But it's a weird effect, it's been done so much now
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:31.320]  That by default the whole system knows it's made up
[1:36:31.320 --> 1:36:35.320]  So the dirty tricks don't work, it's almost like you survived so many of them
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:39.320]  All the arrows stuck in your hide become like an armor
[1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:43.320]  You've got so many slings and arrows and darts sticking out of your back
[1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:46.320]  That it becomes a shield like an asteroid belt
[1:36:46.320 --> 1:36:49.320]  We'll talk to Wayne Madsen and take your phone calls in a minute
[1:36:49.320 --> 1:36:54.320]  First off, this whole broadcast is funded by prisonplanet.tv members

[1:38:19.320 --> 1:38:22.320]  And everyone around the office is really noticing
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:27.320]  The cameras put 10 to 20 pounds, 30 pounds on you
[1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:30.320]  In person, people are like, whoa dude, you're losing a lot of weight
[1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:34.320]  Whoa, your skin looks really good compared to what it looked like before
[1:38:34.320 --> 1:38:38.320]  It's all the true nation iodine that no other manufacturer has
[1:38:38.320 --> 1:38:42.320]  This proprietary rare earth crystal pure iodine
[1:38:42.320 --> 1:38:46.320]  The other stuff comes from seaweed, things like that, which is fine
[1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:50.320]  We have the best double the strength, half the cost of competitors
[1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:53.320]  And it's the best out there, but regardless, check into iodine
[1:38:53.320 --> 1:38:56.320]  It's incredible what it's done for me and my family
[1:38:56.320 --> 1:39:00.320]  We've got the supermill vitality, I better only take a regular dose here, I took a triple dose this morning
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:07.320]  At first, I only took half the dose until I got used to it and now, well, I may be abusing my own products
[1:39:07.320 --> 1:39:12.320]  The point is, is that hey, sometimes at night I don't want a beer anymore, I just have this
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:17.320]  I'm going to be honest with you, take the challenge, get the nation iodine, the survival shield X2
[1:39:17.320 --> 1:39:21.320]  If you want something a little bit wigger, we have this original survival shield discounted
[1:39:21.320 --> 1:39:26.320]  The fluoride shield 25% off right now, M4WarsLife.com
[1:39:29.320 --> 1:39:34.320]  Put some more water in there, it's always at the bottom, it's just so delicious
[1:39:34.320 --> 1:39:38.320]  The more you drink it, the more you take it, the more you realize what it's doing
[1:39:38.320 --> 1:39:42.320]  I mean, Dr. Group is a godsend, I just want to literally kiss his feet
[1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:46.320]  And it's helping fund the operation, expand the operation as well, M4WarsLife.com
[1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:51.320]  Okay, enough of me ranting, we'll keep Wayne a little bit in the next hour at a Syrian girl
[1:39:51.320 --> 1:39:54.320]  So he can finish up all his incredible points
[1:39:54.320 --> 1:40:00.320]  Wayne, I am like a kid at Christmas when we see the carbon tax documents come out
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:04.320]  That it's really meant to form world government and bankrupt the third world, not just the west
[1:40:04.320 --> 1:40:06.320]  And it's all a fraud by Al Gore
[1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:08.320]  I mean, I celebrate it when that happened
[1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:11.320]  I celebrate when Snowden documents come out
[1:40:11.320 --> 1:40:18.320]  I celebrate when they put a ballot initiative on the ballot in New York to investigate Building 7 being blown up
[1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:22.320]  I mean, I get excited like people get excited about a football game
[1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:30.320]  And when you started talking about how we got the leaks now on how they're spying on media
[1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:34.320]  And fighting it and manipulating it and planting fake stories
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:41.320]  And coming after Matt Drudge and Alex Jones and Abby Martin over at RT
[1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:44.320]  Who's been critical of the Russians in Ukraine
[1:40:44.320 --> 1:40:49.320]  Which I think she just did purely because of propaganda claiming she's a Russian propagandist
[1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:51.320]  As long as she says what's true, she's not
[1:40:51.320 --> 1:40:55.320]  I mean, obviously working over at RT, that's partially state run
[1:40:55.320 --> 1:40:58.320]  You can argue that, but the truth is still the truth, I don't care who says it
[1:40:58.320 --> 1:41:06.320]  But I know this, the Congress having people, this is confirmed by the IP addresses
[1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:11.320]  Planting on there that I'm a Russian agent is absolute baloney
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:14.320]  And comes out of the usual suspects who were known
[1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:17.320]  And I'm not going to even name their names and give them attention
[1:41:17.320 --> 1:41:19.320]  To work with the neocons and the CIA
[1:41:19.320 --> 1:41:22.320]  So they've been putting this out for a while
[1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:27.320]  I'm about as Russian as somebody from Angola
[1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:30.320]  And I admire the Russians, I think they're a lot of great scientists
[1:41:30.320 --> 1:41:32.320]  Interesting culture, I want to travel there one day
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:34.320]  But I've really had enough of this, I mean
[1:41:34.320 --> 1:41:37.320]  I had family on both sides on the Mayflower
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:39.320]  I had family in the entire Texas Revolution
[1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:41.320]  Basically starting it
[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:48.320]  I am Americana and I'm not saying I'm exceptional or I'm perfect or I'm American royalty
[1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:51.320]  But if there is such a thing, my entire pedigree is America
[1:41:51.320 --> 1:41:54.320]  It is the bankers and the globalists destroying this country
[1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:56.320]  Shutting down our power plants, opening our borders
[1:41:56.320 --> 1:41:58.320]  I'm fighting for this country
[1:41:58.320 --> 1:42:00.320]  And I've gotten to the point where if somebody tells me
[1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:02.320]  That I'm a Russian agent to my face
[1:42:02.320 --> 1:42:04.320]  I'm going to punch them in the nose, Wayne, go ahead
[1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:07.320]  I don't blame you, I get the same kind of nonsense
[1:42:07.320 --> 1:42:10.320]  And the people that make those charges
[1:42:10.320 --> 1:42:13.320]  Many of them work for people like George Soros
[1:42:13.320 --> 1:42:14.320]  Who's Hungarian
[1:42:14.320 --> 1:42:16.320]  A Nazi collaborating piece of crap
[1:42:16.320 --> 1:42:19.320]  Right, and Rupert Murdoch who's Australian
[1:42:19.320 --> 1:42:27.320]  My mom's side, they were fighting with George Washington's army too
[1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:31.320]  And I'll be darned if I'm going to have some guy who just got off the boat from Poland
[1:42:31.320 --> 1:42:32.320]  Or Lithuania
[1:42:32.320 --> 1:42:36.320]  Or one of those countries whose parents came to Elvis Island
[1:42:36.320 --> 1:42:39.320]  Just 60 or 70 years ago
[1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:43.320]  Tell me that I'm not some sort of true American
[1:42:43.320 --> 1:42:50.320]  You know, they're still eating recipes
[1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:55.320]  From their grandmother's cookbooks from Czechoslovakia
[1:42:55.320 --> 1:43:00.320]  So anyway, no, it's true
[1:43:00.320 --> 1:43:03.320]  This fanning tools and these other intrusion tools
[1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:06.320]  Can be used very effectively, of course
[1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:09.320]  As you say, to attack an individual or an organization
[1:43:09.320 --> 1:43:15.320]  They've got one called Cannonball that sends repeated text messages
[1:43:15.320 --> 1:43:20.320]  To a target, then that could be a media operation
[1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:24.320]  So what if your Fox News and all of a sudden they're getting repeat text messages
[1:43:24.320 --> 1:43:31.320]  From GCHQ operatives saying, look, you got to do something about Alex Jones or Wayne Massin
[1:43:31.320 --> 1:43:34.320]  They are spamming the trends
[1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:38.320]  Because everything now on cable, you name it, and the internet is about what's trending
[1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:41.320]  So they're faking the trends, just like Nielsen fakes the readies
[1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:44.320]  Let me ask you this, did you see the footage four or five months ago
[1:43:44.320 --> 1:43:51.320]  When our reporters Anthony Gutiarty and Josh Owens
[1:43:51.320 --> 1:43:57.320]  And of course Air Force Vet and great reporter Weldon Henson
[1:43:57.320 --> 1:44:01.320]  Went to the NSA center outside of Salt Lake
[1:44:01.320 --> 1:44:04.320]  And all they did was go there and asked to talk to the head people
[1:44:04.320 --> 1:44:07.320]  Within hours of that happening, all their phones were crashing going down
[1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:13.320]  Someone was on my iPhone 5 typing and sending things and weird stuff was going on
[1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:18.320]  I had to get rid of that phone, they did it again, I had to get another phone again
[1:44:18.320 --> 1:44:20.320]  I mean, what is going on, Wayne?
[1:44:20.320 --> 1:44:27.320]  Well, it's the same thing when I discussed the NSA third party allies last year
[1:44:27.320 --> 1:44:33.320]  And it was in the front page of the UK observer and also ran by the Guardian
[1:44:33.320 --> 1:44:37.320]  And all of a sudden I was subjected to this Twitter campaign
[1:44:37.320 --> 1:44:42.320]  Which now we know that those tools exist at GCHQ
[1:44:42.320 --> 1:44:47.320]  Where you can only be a few individuals and make it sound like, my God, there's, you know, 50,000 people
[1:44:47.320 --> 1:44:50.320]  You found out the attacks on you were coming out of the Naval War College
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:52.320]  Oh, they were participating in it
[1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:58.320]  And fortunately, one of the ringleaders of that operation just a few weeks ago
[1:44:58.320 --> 1:45:03.320]  He was caught sending, he sort of had an Anthony Weiner problem, he was caught sending
[1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:08.320]  Textures of his junk to somebody via text messaging, some woman
[1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:13.320]  So that leaked out and he's under some investigation, so I don't think he'll be there
[1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:16.320]  Oh, I wonder if somebody got into his computer to counter strike on him
[1:45:16.320 --> 1:45:23.320]  You know, I have to say the shot in Freud was very, very good for a couple of days
[1:45:23.320 --> 1:45:25.320]  When that story broke
[1:45:25.320 --> 1:45:30.320]  Continuing, I mean, where do you expect all this to go as more just keeps coming back
[1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:33.320]  That everything's under surveillance, total control
[1:45:33.320 --> 1:45:36.320]  I mean, can they get away with bringing in authoritarian government?
[1:45:36.320 --> 1:45:41.320]  Oh, absolutely, and that's why just last month I gave a talk in New York City on NSA
[1:45:41.320 --> 1:45:46.320]  And my feeling now is a lot of people say, well, let's reform NSA
[1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:50.320]  Well, the reforms we've seen pushed through by Obama are meaningless
[1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:55.320]  But the privacy board that looked at NSA gave them a pass, basically
[1:45:55.320 --> 1:46:00.320]  The way to deal with NSA is not to mend it, it's to end it
[1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:06.320]  And that's the message that I put out in New York City was, end it, don't mend it
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:10.320]  They didn't mend or reform the KGB, they got rid of it
[1:46:10.320 --> 1:46:13.320]  Or the Romanian Securitate
[1:46:13.320 --> 1:46:15.320]  Or the East German Stasi
[1:46:15.320 --> 1:46:19.320]  Or the Stasi or the South African Bureau of State Securities
[1:46:19.320 --> 1:46:21.320]  Or the Gestapo
[1:46:21.320 --> 1:46:24.320]  Right, they were all eliminated, Chile's Dina was eliminated
[1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:30.320]  And that's not how, that you don't reform these types of organizations
[1:46:30.320 --> 1:46:34.320]  These Orwellian outfits, you get rid of them and start from scratch
[1:46:34.320 --> 1:46:39.320]  And make sure that whatever takes their place doesn't have these kinds of capabilities
[1:46:39.320 --> 1:46:42.320]  And you say why it was ended, you send the strong messages, it's not done anymore
[1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:44.320]  Right, exactly, exactly
[1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:49.320]  The reason they got rid of the Stasi and the KGB was because of their past excesses
[1:46:49.320 --> 1:46:52.320]  And their brutality, and that's not, so I just say
[1:46:52.320 --> 1:46:55.320]  Look, you know, it's a big campus up at NSA at Fort Meade
[1:46:55.320 --> 1:47:00.320]  But you know, we have a shortage of engineers and mathematicians and other technical people
[1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:03.320]  Take all those NSA people and turn them into...
[1:47:03.320 --> 1:47:06.320]  That's right, has the NSA been a giant brain drain
[1:47:06.320 --> 1:47:09.320]  Putting all these top people on the business of spying?
[1:47:09.320 --> 1:47:14.320]  Yeah, I think it would make a wonderful campus for, say, the University of Maryland,
[1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:21.320]  Columbia, Maryland campus, that I just have it as a math, engineering, science type university
[1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:25.320]  And take all those ex NSA people and have them, they're the teachers
[1:47:25.320 --> 1:47:29.320]  But isn't a total surveillance grid the ultimate national security threat?
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:34.320]  Because bad individuals will use it, will abuse it, and then will use it to take over
[1:47:34.320 --> 1:47:36.320]  As has now already happened
[1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:41.320]  Oh, yeah, I mean, these tools that I noticed are used by GCHU
[1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:45.320]  And I want to emphasize that they're using them against Americans
[1:47:45.320 --> 1:47:48.320]  They can deny that to the calcium home, but that's how it's done
[1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:55.320]  These tools are used to, they can put images without you knowing it on your computer
[1:47:55.320 --> 1:47:59.320]  Now, I'm not saying that that should be used as a pass for all these pedophiles
[1:47:59.320 --> 1:48:02.320]  Especially all the ones they're now finding in the British government
[1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:08.320]  But a person could be targeted that way, they could put some sort of...
[1:48:08.320 --> 1:48:12.320]  Well, we know they've done that, they also do it to a bunch of innocent groups
[1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:16.320]  As a smoke screen to protect the real operatives that are pedos
[1:48:16.320 --> 1:48:22.320]  Exactly, exactly, so these are very dangerous tools now at the disposal of GCHU
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:28.320]  And of course, you know, the U.S. Congress has no authority over GCHU
[1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:32.320]  But I would suggest that the reason Greenwald blacked out the names is
[1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:37.320]  He's trying to protect their people over their GCHU from civil lawsuits
[1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:41.320]  That can be brought here in the United States against them
[1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:48.320]  For potentially violating our privacy, especially violating the Computer Front Abuse Act of 1986
[1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:54.320]  Sure, I want to go to break and come back and take calls from George, Kenny, David, Paul, Mike, and others
[1:48:54.320 --> 1:48:59.320]  But first, Wayne Madsen Report.com folks, excellent site, some of it's subscription
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:04.320]  You should go there and subscribe and support this patriot and hero for the First Amendment and truth
[1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:09.320]  He's gone through death threats, attacks, you name it to bring you the intel that he brings you now
[1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:13.320]  But what do you see happening with ISIS?
[1:49:13.320 --> 1:49:17.320]  Because never before have they operated Al Qaeda so openly
[1:49:17.320 --> 1:49:23.320]  I mean, a name change did not keep the public from finding out that it's Al Qaeda or that the West is behind it
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:26.320]  Where do you see that nightmare situation going?
[1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:30.320]  Well, it's clear that they're trying to take over Iraq
[1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:37.320]  And now we have Prince Bandar back in power in Saudi Arabia basically advising the king
[1:49:37.320 --> 1:49:44.320]  He was the head of Saudi intelligence and he was basically fired in April
[1:49:44.320 --> 1:49:49.320]  But now he's got probably more power than he had even when he was head of Saudi intelligence
[1:49:49.320 --> 1:49:54.320]  It was Prince Bandar that arranged for these groups to be funded
[1:49:54.320 --> 1:49:58.320]  That were fighting against President Assad in Syria
[1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:02.320]  Then they turned around and started fighting against Maliki in Iraq
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:11.320]  They want to create a caliphate and unfortunately the CIA and I do believe that our CIA director John Brennan
[1:50:11.320 --> 1:50:17.320]  They call him Sheikh Brennan, you know, he visited Mecca when he was the CIA station chief in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
[1:50:17.320 --> 1:50:24.320]  Back in the 90s and that's supposedly only reserved for Muslims to visit the holy city of Mecca
[1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:30.320]  Of course somebody who has expressed some great interest in Islam, you know, there's a former FBI agent
[1:50:30.320 --> 1:50:34.320]  I forget his name who thinks that Brennan converted to Islam
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:44.320]  I don't know if that's true, but I have to say that Brennan, if Al Qaeda could have their own guy running the CIA
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:47.320]  They would probably want a guy like Brennan doing it
[1:50:47.320 --> 1:50:51.320]  Of course, Brennan and Obama go back a long way, they're very close
[1:50:51.320 --> 1:50:55.320]  And the word is that Brennan and Valerie Jarrett basically work
[1:50:55.320 --> 1:50:57.320]  Hold on, stay there, I want to hear more about this
[1:50:57.320 --> 1:51:14.320]  Stay with us
[1:51:27.320 --> 1:51:30.320]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson
[1:51:58.320 --> 1:52:01.320]  Alex Jones here for infowars.com
[1:52:01.320 --> 1:52:08.320]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at madein1776.com
[1:52:08.320 --> 1:52:13.320]  You already discounted made in 1776 t-shirts are only 1776
[1:52:13.320 --> 1:52:18.320]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling out
[1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:20.320]  There's only 500 of each
[1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:24.320]  We're talking about made in America belt buckles and nickel brass
[1:52:24.320 --> 1:52:27.320]  This is more than a summer blowout special
[1:52:27.320 --> 1:52:30.320]  This is a new declaration of independence
[1:52:30.320 --> 1:52:36.320]  But to expand the info orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free
[1:52:36.320 --> 1:52:42.320]  Right now when you get a membership at prisonplanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year
[1:52:42.320 --> 1:52:45.320]  That's more than five months free off the regular price
[1:52:45.320 --> 1:52:49.320]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July
[1:52:49.320 --> 1:52:58.320]  At madein1776.com, Molan Lombay, you can take my gun from my cold dead aunt
[1:53:20.320 --> 1:53:22.320]  Where other silver solutions simply cannot reach
[1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:26.320]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com
[1:53:26.320 --> 1:53:55.320]  That's SilverLungs.com
[1:53:56.320 --> 1:53:58.320]  That's SilverLungs.com
[1:54:27.320 --> 1:54:33.320]  I mean we used to live across the street from a park
[1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:38.320]  And there were a lot of people like their 8, 9, 10 year olds play and you'd look out the window
[1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:42.320]  CPS is taking kids that play in the backyard now
[1:54:42.320 --> 1:54:46.320]  But then the borders wide open, dead babies are washing up in Rio Grande
[1:54:46.320 --> 1:54:53.320]  And the illegals don't have to show IDs flying, it's just all a giant power grab
[1:54:53.320 --> 1:54:58.320]  We've got all these national security forces to have neighbors call and say
[1:54:58.320 --> 1:55:02.320]  Oh, the kids playing in the park, so they come take the kid
[1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:05.320]  What a screwed up government, I want to go to phone calls
[1:55:05.320 --> 1:55:07.320]  We're going to have Wayne with us 20 minutes to the next hour
[1:55:07.320 --> 1:55:09.320]  We're going to George and others here in a moment
[1:55:09.320 --> 1:55:12.320]  But Wayne, you look at the government openly funding Al Qaeda
[1:55:12.320 --> 1:55:15.320]  While they take all our rights and spy on us in the name of fighting Al Qaeda
[1:55:15.320 --> 1:55:18.320]  The public's learning about this
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:22.320]  I had customs people complaining to me when I flew back into the country a few weeks ago
[1:55:22.320 --> 1:55:24.320]  Saying, oh, it's all staged
[1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:27.320]  I got into this after 9-11 and it's all bull
[1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:32.320]  I mean, I really think, as you said, Obama and the globalists are mismanaging things
[1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:34.320]  Congress has a 7% approval rating
[1:55:34.320 --> 1:55:37.320]  I don't know how they think they're going to get away with all this
[1:55:37.320 --> 1:55:40.320]  I think Toto pulled the curtain back
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:47.320]  Yeah, I mean, the thing is that people that they talk about, we have to arm the Syrian opposition moderates
[1:55:47.320 --> 1:55:53.320]  There are no moderates, the head of the Syrian opposition allowed these Al Qaeda, these ISIL people
[1:55:53.320 --> 1:56:01.320]  To basically come in with, John Brennan gave them lethal equipment
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:04.320]  They want to give them more now
[1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:12.320]  They basically, and then you had, you know, you have John McCain and his South Carolina wife
[1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:19.320]  Miss Lindsey Graham, every time, you know, these Syrian opposition people want something more
[1:56:19.320 --> 1:56:21.320]  They're saying, oh, give them more
[1:56:21.320 --> 1:56:27.320]  And then, you know, we open up the weapons pipeline to these groups, not only fighting in Syria
[1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:29.320]  But also fighting in Iraq
[1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:31.320]  It's insane
[1:56:31.320 --> 1:56:39.320]  And like I say, I mean, Brennan has a lot of power, I understand
[1:56:39.320 --> 1:56:42.320]  He still is very close to Jared in the White House
[1:56:42.320 --> 1:56:45.320]  I also understand Jay Carney, the White House press secretary
[1:56:45.320 --> 1:56:50.320]  Really wanted to stay until after the midterm elections in November
[1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:52.320]  But it was Valerie Jarrett that forced them out
[1:56:52.320 --> 1:56:54.320]  Well, let's expand on something here
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:57.320]  And then we're going to go to break them right back with the calls, I promise
[1:56:57.320 --> 1:57:00.320]  You know, you're a moderate when it comes to partisanship
[1:57:00.320 --> 1:57:02.320]  You're not an Islamophobe
[1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:04.320]  But I respect what you have to say
[1:57:04.320 --> 1:57:10.320]  And there's mounting evidence when he goes to Mecca or goes to Cairo and speaks better Arabic
[1:57:10.320 --> 1:57:13.320]  Than a lot of the Imams, Obama, and the way he acts reverent
[1:57:13.320 --> 1:57:15.320]  And the way they're arming all the radicals
[1:57:15.320 --> 1:57:18.320]  You know, Napoleon for a while made a deal with the Muslims
[1:57:18.320 --> 1:57:21.320]  There was ancient deals in Europe and during the Crusades
[1:57:21.320 --> 1:57:25.320]  You know, you have double dealers teaming up with the Muslims
[1:57:25.320 --> 1:57:28.320]  This is a billion and a half people
[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:30.320]  And they've got a lot of money from the oil
[1:57:30.320 --> 1:57:33.320]  And Saudi Arabia is involved in everything
[1:57:33.320 --> 1:57:36.320]  I mean, are you saying that you've got good intel
[1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:39.320]  That it's not just, you know, previous right wing paranoia
[1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:45.320]  That, I mean, we see weird common core teaching Sharia law in public schools
[1:57:45.320 --> 1:57:54.320]  Is there some fifth column or triple cross radical Islamic Saudi Arabian jihad movement
[1:57:54.320 --> 1:57:56.320]  I mean, in government?
[1:57:56.320 --> 1:58:03.320]  Well, okay, I was, last month I visited both the Truman and Eisenhower libraries
[1:58:03.320 --> 1:58:07.320]  I was in Abilene, Kansas and Independence, Missouri
[1:58:07.320 --> 1:58:13.320]  I'm looking at old documents that show that the CIA, even after it was formed back in 1947
[1:58:13.320 --> 1:58:19.320]  Favored backing Muslim organizations against secular organizations in a number of countries
[1:58:19.320 --> 1:58:26.320]  Because the secular organizations and parties were considered either pro-communist or communist themselves
[1:58:26.320 --> 1:58:30.320]  One country they did that in was Indonesia, where they supported the Muslims
[1:58:30.320 --> 1:58:33.320]  Also in Iran, let's say they were to come back, Operation Ajax
[1:58:33.320 --> 1:58:34.320]  Well, I mean, that's the issue
[1:58:34.320 --> 1:58:37.320]  Whether they really are Muslims or not, they're backing radical Muslims
[1:58:37.320 --> 1:58:39.320]  We'll be right back with Wayne Madsen, 60 seconds
[1:58:39.320 --> 1:58:42.320]  Your phone calls will get the rest of this intel on the situation
[1:58:42.320 --> 1:58:49.320]  George, Kenny, David, Paul, Mike, stay with us, third hour straight ahead
[1:58:49.320 --> 1:58:53.320]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered city of Austin tap water
[1:58:53.320 --> 1:58:54.320]  I didn't taste dirt in it
[1:58:54.320 --> 1:58:55.320]  God knows what's in this
[1:58:55.320 --> 1:58:59.320]  These people just sampled city of Austin tap water straight from the faucet
[1:58:59.320 --> 1:59:05.320]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system
[1:59:05.320 --> 1:59:06.320]  Now my nose better
[1:59:06.320 --> 1:59:07.320]  Tastes like nothing
[1:59:07.320 --> 1:59:09.320]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like, it's good water
[1:59:09.320 --> 1:59:15.320]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others
[1:59:15.320 --> 1:59:19.320]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues
[1:59:19.320 --> 1:59:22.320]  Including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer
[1:59:22.320 --> 1:59:25.320]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're in tap water
[1:59:25.320 --> 1:59:30.320]  The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances
[1:59:30.320 --> 1:59:33.320]  Leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water
[1:59:33.320 --> 1:59:34.320]  Okay, this is very tasty
[1:59:34.320 --> 1:59:35.320]  It's good water
[1:59:35.320 --> 1:59:36.320]  Refreshing
[1:59:36.320 --> 1:59:37.320]  It's good

[2:00:17.320 --> 2:00:22.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[2:00:22.320 --> 2:00:41.320]  Alright, I promised to go to your call, so what I'll do with Wayne Madsen who got cut off by the break is we'll get into the radical Islamic conspiracy
[2:00:41.320 --> 2:00:47.320]  Is there a Islamic cell takeover in the US government of the West?
[2:00:47.320 --> 2:00:50.320]  We're going to talk about that with Wayne before he leaves us
[2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:52.320]  Right now, let's go to George
[2:00:52.320 --> 2:00:55.320]  Ian, Connecticut, thanks for holding George here on the air
[2:00:55.320 --> 2:00:59.320]  Hi, Wayne, I have three quick questions you can answer quickly
[2:00:59.320 --> 2:01:07.320]  One is about Karen Houdas, maybe she'd be, if she's for real, she'd be useful down at the economic summit in South Carolina, South America
[2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:11.320]  And the next one is Mr. Barry Socorro
[2:01:11.320 --> 2:01:17.320]  If everything's being checked, all our records are being gone through and we have no privacy
[2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:22.320]  As in his school records, public, so we can see if he ever made a legal name change
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:27.320]  That might open a whole can of worms, whether he is a citizen or not a citizen, all that stuff
[2:01:27.320 --> 2:01:35.320]  And the last point is, since these people are doing all these illegal actions off our budget, isn't that a misuse of funds?
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:46.320]  Isn't there some way we can push the Congress and everybody to go after these different departments and organizations of misusing and embezzling funds for al-Qaeda, et cetera, et cetera
[2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:50.320]  Well, yes, the last question, I'll answer that first
[2:01:50.320 --> 2:02:07.320]  Yeah, Congress has the purse strings, and there was a time in this country where there were some of these old-time senators and members of the House who would either threaten to cut off funds if they didn't clean up their actor, just cut them off entirely
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:21.320]  But the draft was ended because the Nixon administration basically decided not to fund the selective service any longer, that's how it died, you know, I mean, this is how you bring programs to an end by cutting off the money
[2:02:21.320 --> 2:02:31.320]  Now on President Obama's records, absolutely, we don't know anything about his school records at Occidental or at Columbia
[2:02:31.320 --> 2:02:49.320]  And, you know, why not release those? You know, after being at the Truman and Eisenhower libraries, we know so much, and even then we knew so much about the private lives of these two presidents and their histories
[2:02:49.320 --> 2:03:00.320]  We knew how many lemon trees grew on the Nixon, in the Nixon lemon grove in New York, Olinda, but we don't know what courses Obama took at Occidental
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:08.320]  And he's got multiple names, Barry Sataro and others he operated under, he was signed up at a mosque when he was living in Indonesia, that's on record
[2:03:08.320 --> 2:03:21.320]  He was an Indonesian citizen too, when he was a child, and there's no record of him doing anything at the age of 18 to proactively declare that he was a US citizen, which he was supposed to do
[2:03:21.320 --> 2:03:31.320]  He always looked at it as he was CIA, which we know on record the whole family was, and an infiltrator of the Islamist, but, you know, spying goes both ways
[2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:36.320]  I mean, is there a chance that he could actually be like a Saudi Arabian operative?
[2:03:36.320 --> 2:03:53.320]  I don't think so, I think it just fits the bill, I mean, we know that if Brennan is, you know, I think he's a Saudi file myself, but is that because he wanted to, you know, move in basically into the Saudi royal family, which is kind of secretive in some respects
[2:03:53.320 --> 2:04:07.320]  It's not a democracy for one thing, anything but, but we've got Brennan, who basically looked out for Obama during a campaign and cleaned out his passport records of anything that would be negative towards Obama
[2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:16.320]  And of course, all the records on his mother and father disappeared as well, as well as those of his grandparents
[2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:30.320]  And we're going to break great question callers, more callers coming up, Kenny, Paul, Mike and others, for Wayne Madsen, 800-259-9231, specific questions for Wayne Madsen, briefly, Bergdahl, what do you think about him?
[2:04:30.320 --> 2:04:57.320]  You know, I don't think we, we know that he's been given a desk job there in Texas, and if the army feels that they can give him a desk job, they must know a lot more about that situation than we know, I just think it was premature for some people to be saying, oh, let's, you know, let's put him on trial, I think that the army has looked at the case
[2:04:57.320 --> 2:05:00.320]  Well, hold on, let's come back with that.
[2:05:27.320 --> 2:05:38.320]  The ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula. Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[2:06:58.320 --> 2:07:09.320]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxified. Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[2:07:09.320 --> 2:07:23.320]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[2:07:23.320 --> 2:07:30.320]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[2:07:30.320 --> 2:07:39.320]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:07:39.320 --> 2:07:48.320]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.

[2:08:16.320 --> 2:08:23.320]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[2:08:23.320 --> 2:08:29.320]  Music
[2:08:29.320 --> 2:08:38.320]  We're going to your phone calls with Wayne Madsen. We're covering the waterfront right now. One of the most important NSA whistleblowers in history.
[2:08:38.320 --> 2:08:44.320]  Let's go to Mike and Louisiana. You're on the air. Go ahead, Mike.
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:58.320]  Good day. Wayne, this is Mike from New Orleans. I picked you up at the train station and introduced you to the lady that did the BP spell.
[2:08:58.320 --> 2:09:01.320]  Right. Good to hear from you.
[2:09:01.320 --> 2:09:20.320]  Good to see you. In your expert analysis, Wayne, all of this, if you take it all, the bird doll thing, the influx of the immigration, the NSA, it all ties into the overall picture.
[2:09:20.320 --> 2:09:31.320]  It's only a matter of the question, I guess, would be when, you know, to your best analysis, when do you think is, you know, what's going to be the trigger?
[2:09:31.320 --> 2:09:38.320]  What will be the timeframe that you see in your best judgment in the near future?
[2:09:38.320 --> 2:09:46.320]  Yeah, that's what I said at the start of the interview is that global dollar death, wars, domestic police state gearing up.
[2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:53.320]  What's the big enchilada? What's the end game? What do you expect to see next? What are they planning? How does all this tie together?
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:10:01.320]  Well, I'm quite concerned about some sort of, you know, the NSA will try to justify its existence now.
[2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:09.320]  And I'm afraid about some sort of massive attack on the infrastructure, whether it's a computer infrastructure, which would affect all the other infrastructures.
[2:10:09.320 --> 2:10:16.320]  Everything's automated. And you mentioned the kill switches and all this other thing, emergency alert systems. That's what I'm afraid of.
[2:10:16.320 --> 2:10:22.320]  They want to try to, you know, test that type of scenario out.
[2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:30.320]  And I just want to say something about bird doll. I did enough UCMJ article 32 investigations in the Navy.
[2:10:30.320 --> 2:10:34.320]  If they don't have anything to charge in with now, I doubt they have anything at all.
[2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:40.320]  And the knuckleheads over at Fox News, I wonder how many of them have ever done an article 32 investigation.
[2:10:40.320 --> 2:10:47.320]  I don't see a lot of military vets over there as their anchorman, certainly not Sean Hannity or Bill O'Reilly.
[2:10:47.320 --> 2:10:54.320]  But anyway, I just don't think they, if they don't have anything to charge in with by now, I doubt they have anything at all.
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:10:59.320]  Well, caller, I appreciate your call. Thank you for your very important question. We'll get a more in a moment.
[2:10:59.320 --> 2:11:09.320]  Going back to Bergdahl, I go off patterns. You have the CIA section chief in Cobble's cover blown two days later.
[2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:15.320]  This guy who's been in this economy network for supposedly years gets released.
[2:11:15.320 --> 2:11:19.320]  Many of those networks are fully infiltrated by the globalist being funded in most cases.
[2:11:19.320 --> 2:11:23.320]  Certainly their grassroots don't know that, but the higher ups are run by it. That's on record.
[2:11:23.320 --> 2:11:30.320]  It's just like ISI or ISIS. Now they're calling themselves just IS Islamic State.
[2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:38.320]  So, so, I mean, I saw that as a way to just kill the story on the VA and basically have them hand him back over.
[2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:44.320]  And I think, I mean, because his buddies, we do this before it was in the news, said, no, he said, I am, you know,
[2:11:44.320 --> 2:11:50.320]  telling you all that I'm defecting and left his stuff and then walked out into the desert, the high desert.
[2:11:50.320 --> 2:11:58.320]  It sounds to me like he was an attempt to infiltrate into those groups and that they just did this whole story because his cover been blown.
[2:11:58.320 --> 2:12:05.320]  It may be that, you know, and then that they basically decided to keep him as a hostage for five years.
[2:12:05.320 --> 2:12:14.320]  That's happened before. You know, and that's, and here we have another situation where there is no oversight over what the CIA does.
[2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:20.320]  These committees in Congress, the intelligence committees are a joke. You got that guy, Mike Rogers.
[2:12:20.320 --> 2:12:25.320]  All of a sudden, he resigns as the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to be, he wants to be like you, Alex.
[2:12:25.320 --> 2:12:30.320]  He wants, he's been offered a talk show somewhere on the radio, I guess.
[2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:33.320]  I mean, he's leaving that position. I mean, what do they got on that guy?
[2:12:33.320 --> 2:12:37.320]  But he's been a lip-spittle for the CIA and NSA, everything they want.
[2:12:37.320 --> 2:12:40.320]  He's given them and Diane Feinstein over to Senate.
[2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:44.320]  I can't, I can't say anything. I can't say enough bad about that woman.
[2:12:44.320 --> 2:12:49.320]  She could have been dumped by the people of California years ago, but they, they have a death wish out there.
[2:12:49.320 --> 2:12:58.320]  They keep these old, they keep these old ancient women around Boxer and Feinstein and I don't know why they keep them there, but they do.
[2:12:58.320 --> 2:13:05.320]  Amazing. You know, I got a lot of criticism and I expected it because I said it about 80% tongue in cheek.
[2:13:05.320 --> 2:13:12.320]  At this point, I just don't believe anything they say, you know, is Michelle Obama a transsexual?
[2:13:12.320 --> 2:13:18.320]  Because we know Obama was raised by one of those folks in Indonesia, that's on record.
[2:13:18.320 --> 2:13:19.320]  30, right.
[2:13:19.320 --> 2:13:21.320]  Yeah. And, you know, all this is going on.
[2:13:21.320 --> 2:13:25.320]  So, so there was a joke by Joanne or whatever her name is.
[2:13:25.320 --> 2:13:26.320]  Joan Rivers.
[2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:28.320]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Joan Rivers.
[2:13:28.320 --> 2:13:30.320]  Teleprompter free folks going from memory here.
[2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:35.320]  So I came out and just said, look, you know, the fish are turning bisexual with all the chemicals.
[2:13:35.320 --> 2:13:37.320]  All this stuff's going on. Who knows.
[2:13:37.320 --> 2:13:41.320]  And of course, the media picked up on it, but there is incredible.
[2:13:41.320 --> 2:13:45.320]  You were the first guy that ever said Hillary had a bunch of girlfriends and named them that I heard.
[2:13:45.320 --> 2:13:48.320]  You were the first guy exposed to DC Madame stuff.
[2:13:48.320 --> 2:13:50.320]  And I mean, that happened. I mean, I'm not tooting your horn.
[2:13:50.320 --> 2:13:56.320]  You're just somebody that I did a man culpa on Larry Sinclair when I went to Chicago.
[2:13:56.320 --> 2:14:01.320]  I found out that a lot of everything he said was correct about Obama himself.
[2:14:01.320 --> 2:14:04.320]  Yeah. At first, you were saying it was a made up that Obama was gay.
[2:14:04.320 --> 2:14:05.320]  What's the latest?
[2:14:05.320 --> 2:14:07.320]  I know you got death threats once you did say it was true.
[2:14:07.320 --> 2:14:09.320]  I mean, what's the real deal?
[2:14:09.320 --> 2:14:14.320]  Because, I mean, about what's going on with Michelle?
[2:14:14.320 --> 2:14:16.320]  Well, you know, I, I don't know.
[2:14:16.320 --> 2:14:20.320]  I, I don't know where Joan Rivers may have heard that.
[2:14:20.320 --> 2:14:26.320]  I mean, I have heard nothing about Michelle being, you know, a transgender person.
[2:14:26.320 --> 2:14:30.320]  So I'll assume that she's a woman because I have no other.
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:37.320]  See, on Obama and on Hillary, there were people coming to me who had, who had good bona fides.
[2:14:37.320 --> 2:14:44.320]  I have to say that basically confirmed the rumors about Hillary being a lesbian.
[2:14:44.320 --> 2:14:48.320]  And well, at least a switchhead or she not total lesbian.
[2:14:48.320 --> 2:14:52.320]  Well, that's now public though. I mean, it's admitted she's got a string of girlfriends.
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:56.320]  Yeah. And, and on Obama, I had no income.
[2:14:56.320 --> 2:15:01.320]  The only thing I heard about Michelle Obama was that, you know, that she lost her law license
[2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:05.320]  because she had done something pretty heinous and that the, the record of what she did,
[2:15:05.320 --> 2:15:08.320]  what she, when she agreed to give up her law license,
[2:15:08.320 --> 2:15:13.320]  that record is now held by the Illinois State Supreme Court and no one can see it.
[2:15:13.320 --> 2:15:16.320]  So that's the only thing I heard negative about her.
[2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:22.320]  Other than the fact she right, she really runs the show with Valerie Jarrett at the White House.
[2:15:22.320 --> 2:15:29.320]  That's the other negative thing. But she's not the first, first lady who would have been running the show.
[2:15:29.320 --> 2:15:37.320]  We know that Nancy Reagan pretty much ran the show after Ronnie started suffering badly from Alzheimer's.
[2:15:37.320 --> 2:15:42.320]  Absolutely. Let's go to more calls here. Let's talk to Paul in New Jersey.
[2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:45.320]  And then we'll go to Kenny and others. Paul, you're on the air.
[2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:54.320]  How you doing? Wayne, do you know that we've been, we've been on the Communist rule since 1913?
[2:15:54.320 --> 2:15:58.320]  Well, I know in the Communist manifesto, the bankers took the record.
[2:15:58.320 --> 2:16:01.320]  I know in the Communist manifesto, the bankers took the record.
[2:16:01.320 --> 2:16:04.320]  That was the year the, the federal reserve kicked off.
[2:16:04.320 --> 2:16:09.320]  And, and also we had the council on foreign relations starting not too long after that.
[2:16:09.320 --> 2:16:17.320]  Which is British intelligence. I mean, what it really is, is fascist above the law tax-exempt bankers who have unlimited money they create,
[2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:21.320]  who put us under socialism, but only to control us.
[2:16:21.320 --> 2:16:27.320]  So I don't really call it a Communist system. I mean, hell, the very same bankers funded the Bolshevik Revolution,
[2:16:27.320 --> 2:16:31.320]  put Mao Zedong into power. Your take on that statement, Wayne Madsen?
[2:16:31.320 --> 2:16:41.320]  Yeah, I mean, it's totalitarianism. I mean, yes, a lot of this started in 1913 at the infamous Jekyll Island retreat.
[2:16:41.320 --> 2:16:47.320]  And that wasn't Communist. That was Robert Barons. And I'm not, I mean, I get where the callers coming from.
[2:16:47.320 --> 2:16:53.320]  Yes, technically they use Communist systems, but their exempt from it, that's what people don't get.
[2:16:53.320 --> 2:16:56.320]  They create it for us and then they set offshore exempt from it.
[2:16:56.320 --> 2:17:02.320]  Right, right. And the thing is, Woodrow Wilson certainly turned in. He was the first neocon.
[2:17:02.320 --> 2:17:06.320]  I always said that even under the dark days of Bush Cheney. He was talking about the neocon.
[2:17:06.320 --> 2:17:13.320]  The first neocon was Woodrow Wilson. And he's the guy that instituted the Espionage Act,
[2:17:13.320 --> 2:17:23.320]  which Obama has brought more charges under the Espionage Act against whistleblowers than all of his predecessors, including Woodrow Wilson combined.
[2:17:23.320 --> 2:17:29.320]  Yeah, I mean, they put Obama in as a closer, like a closing pitcher to just bring it all in.
[2:17:29.320 --> 2:17:33.320]  And I've got to say, they've got a lot done, but it's blown up in their face.
[2:17:33.320 --> 2:17:41.320]  And I don't think he's gone very well for him. I would have to say, Wayne, for the establishment, I don't think they're doing too well.
[2:17:41.320 --> 2:17:49.320]  Right. And then you would think next time they're not going to take a total, the first covert operative in the CIA and make them the president of the United States.
[2:17:49.320 --> 2:17:57.320]  Maybe they'll, you know, if they want another one, they'll take at least the mid-level person or a higher level person, like a George H.W. Bush,
[2:17:57.320 --> 2:18:07.320]  and put them in charge of the country. But yeah, it was a big disaster to take a low-level covert operative and groom him for the presidency.
[2:18:07.320 --> 2:18:15.320]  And I don't agree with the suzer that it's all about America hating, but at the end of the day, you look at these authoritarian liberals and right-wing neocons.
[2:18:15.320 --> 2:18:26.320]  They really don't like the country and want to dismantle it. And I don't get why if they run it, why do they want to shut the power plants off and ship the jobs overseas and get our guns?
[2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:32.320]  We were all going in the direction they wanted. I guess it's a bully's instinct to just try to dominate everything.
[2:18:32.320 --> 2:18:39.320]  Alex, the limousine liberals and the neocons, they drink together in Washington. They go to the same social events in Washington.
[2:18:39.320 --> 2:18:49.320]  They really love each other because they feed off of one another. This whole dichotomy of, you know, left versus right, they need that to exist.
[2:18:49.320 --> 2:18:59.320]  Otherwise, their sources of funding, whether it's from the Koch brothers or the late Richard Mellon skates for George Soros, it dries up.
[2:18:59.320 --> 2:19:06.320]  They have to, they love to hate each other. Or they love to hate each other, either way.
[2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:10.320]  Let's do one more segment, Wayne. I appreciate your time because I want to get to Kenny.
[2:19:10.320 --> 2:19:15.320]  And then we're going to get to Jeremy, Ned, and Shelly quickly when we come back.
[2:19:15.320 --> 2:19:20.320]  Wayne Madsen Report.com. Wayne, what else do you have on your radar screen?
[2:19:20.320 --> 2:19:25.320]  Alex, I was also in Nebraska recently. There's a Senate race there.
[2:19:25.320 --> 2:19:34.320]  And unfortunately, anyone who remembers the infamous Franklin credit union scandal, the use of kids out of Boys Town for prostitution,
[2:19:34.320 --> 2:19:38.320]  that thing has come back again in a current race for the Senate in Nebraska.
[2:19:38.320 --> 2:19:44.320]  Wow, we'll have to talk about that as well. Jam pack coming up. We'll see if we can keep Wayne even longer.
[2:19:44.320 --> 2:19:47.320]  I mean, there's no, six-minute segments coming up. There's no way to cover that in that time.
[2:19:47.320 --> 2:19:52.320]  WayneMadsenReport.com. And again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.

[2:23:09.320 --> 2:23:16.320]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.

[2:23:56.320 --> 2:24:12.320]  Bottom line, Wayne Madsen. Alex Jones back live, folks. We're on right back to calls, but I want to ask you.
[2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:23.320]  When the White House Press Secretary comes out yesterday and says that we have a substantially improved tranquility of the global community that Obama has done that,
[2:24:23.320 --> 2:24:34.320]  they've got to know that that is ridiculous. Do you agree with my basic approximation that the world's probably never been more unstable than it is now,
[2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:41.320]  and that everything Obama and George Soros and the State Department are doing, and the neocons are doing, is it destabilized?
[2:24:41.320 --> 2:24:53.320]  Right. I mean, the White House spending the spin-meisters that they are trying to put lipstick on a pig by making this claim. The world is very unstable right now,
[2:24:53.320 --> 2:25:04.320]  and the chances are we're going to see an increase in that instability as there's plans to push what happened in Ukraine and Syria and Iraq,
[2:25:04.320 --> 2:25:10.320]  try to push that further into Eurasia, and go after the two big prizes, Russia and China.
[2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:17.320]  We're going to go to calls. Finish with who's on the board. You've agreed to say to 45 after, and then we'll get into geopolitically where you see it all going,
[2:25:17.320 --> 2:25:22.320]  and I want you to quantify like a five-minute period because you've been interrupted by breaks and by myself.
[2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:31.320]  This relationship with Saudi Arabia, the Caliphate, ISIS, and government officials in Obama, because it's in mainstream news now,
[2:25:31.320 --> 2:25:38.320]  what you were talking about a while back ago about members of the establishment being a secret Saudi Arabian Muslims.
[2:25:38.320 --> 2:25:42.320]  Right now, let's go to Kenny in Florida. Thanks for holding Kenny. You're on the air.
[2:25:42.320 --> 2:25:52.320]  Greetings, comrades. I want to thank you both for being the tip of the spear to start with. I pray for you often, but I want to run something by you.
[2:25:52.320 --> 2:25:59.320]  We know that the United States created Al Qaeda and Israel created Hamas.
[2:25:59.320 --> 2:26:09.320]  If the majority of people in Israel don't believe that Jesus is a Messiah, why are American Christians so quick to jump to the defense of Israel, no matter what they do?
[2:26:09.320 --> 2:26:19.320]  You basically have Palestine shooting bottle rockets at Israel and Israel getting back with the most high-tech weapons in the world, and do you think this will ever end?
[2:26:19.320 --> 2:26:23.320]  That's a great question, Wayne. I want you to give your take, and then I will.
[2:26:23.320 --> 2:26:34.320]  Yeah, the thing that Kenny's referring to is, of course, the people like John Hagee, they call themselves Christian Zionists.
[2:26:34.320 --> 2:26:38.320]  He actually says Jesus is not the Messiah. I have it on video.
[2:26:38.320 --> 2:26:48.320]  Yeah, I mean, these guys are worse than the old carnival barkers and the old revival tents, but they're deep-pocketed.
[2:26:48.320 --> 2:27:01.320]  They get a lot of money to build these megachurches, but what they're preaching has no relevance to the New Testament, so I don't know how they can even call themselves Christians.
[2:27:01.320 --> 2:27:17.320]  They say, oh, yes, we support Israel. They're more supportive of people like Netanyahu and the settler parties in Israel than some of the other center-left political parties in Israel.
[2:27:17.320 --> 2:27:25.320]  But again, I agree with a lot of what you said about that, but you've got the globalists manipulating the Muslims to be radical and do crazy stuff,
[2:27:25.320 --> 2:27:34.320]  and why are they shooting these rockets out of Gaza and out of Lebanon if it means they get bombed, and why do they do it from civilian areas?
[2:27:34.320 --> 2:27:42.320]  See, that's what I'm saying. You've got ISIS over here. I mean, what's the grand chessboard point, Wayne, of doing all of this?
[2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:52.320]  Well, it all gives to the increasing instability. Just when it looked like there might have been some advancement on the peace front,
[2:27:52.320 --> 2:28:02.320]  now we have this situation with Gaza, and now Netanyahu is saying, well, you see, we can never give independence to the West Bank.
[2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:13.320]  We've got to remain there. So it meets an agenda. An agenda has been set that the Palestinians on the West Bank are going to be told to look elsewhere.
[2:28:13.320 --> 2:28:20.320]  No, I know, but who could trigger them to fire rockets? Because they say they're firing them. I could see a false flag where some of the Israelis...
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:30.320]  Oh, I could too. As a matter of fact, Moshe Diane said Israel will continue to exist by doing exactly creating these false flags.
[2:28:30.320 --> 2:28:33.320]  Oh, you think Israel may be shooting the rockets?
[2:28:33.320 --> 2:28:43.320]  Or at least somebody in the book, as the caller said, it was Israel that created Hamas to be a foil against Tata, which is the majority party of the Palestine Liberation.
[2:28:43.320 --> 2:28:49.320]  And for those that don't know, that's in the Jerusalem Post and herits. I mean, every time I say that, I get mean emails.
[2:28:49.320 --> 2:28:56.320]  How dare you say Israel founded Hamas? That's in the Knesset. I mean, that's not debatable. What, 1975?
[2:28:56.320 --> 2:29:01.320]  Right, right. That's a matter of historical fact.
[2:29:01.320 --> 2:29:08.320]  But let's see people hearing this out there, hearing reality. I mean, I don't have some dog in the fight. I don't hate Israel when I tell the truth.
[2:29:08.320 --> 2:29:11.320]  I'm reading it out of the Jerusalem Post.
[2:29:11.320 --> 2:29:21.320]  Right, right, right. But keep in mind that Israel has been very, very good at doing exactly what we were talking about earlier with GCHQ, using all kinds of tools.
[2:29:21.320 --> 2:29:27.320]  Their system is called megaphone. Megaphone in the Hasbara community, right? They can call on through that type of.
[2:29:27.320 --> 2:29:33.320]  And it's a small political class using instability in Israel to keep control of their population. Sound familiar?
[2:29:33.320 --> 2:29:42.320]  Thank you, Kenny. Great question. We're going to talk to Jeremy, Shelley, Ned, and Sam. And then that's it for calls.
[2:29:42.320 --> 2:29:47.320]  We'll get into the Muslim angle of this. We're looking at everything. Nothing's taboo here.
[2:29:47.320 --> 2:29:52.320]  Well, look at the Vatican, too. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[2:29:52.320 --> 2:29:59.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:59.320 --> 2:30:02.320]  I can taste dirt in it. God knows what's in there.
[2:30:02.320 --> 2:30:06.320]  These people just sampled city of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[2:30:06.320 --> 2:30:12.320]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system.
[2:30:12.320 --> 2:30:16.320]  That one is better. Tastes like nothing. Yep. I know what good water tastes like. It's good water.
[2:30:16.320 --> 2:30:22.320]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[2:30:22.320 --> 2:30:29.320]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[2:30:29.320 --> 2:30:32.320]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[2:30:32.320 --> 2:30:40.320]  The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[2:30:40.320 --> 2:30:44.320]  Okay, this is very tasty. It's good water. Refreshing. It's good.

[2:32:52.320 --> 2:33:21.320]  Molan Lombay, you can take my gun from my cold, dead, anch.
[2:33:21.320 --> 2:33:28.320]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:28.320 --> 2:33:33.320]  Wayne Madsen is our guest. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[2:33:33.320 --> 2:33:46.320]  Look, here's where I stand on Israel. It has become a political football issue where you'll get 100 Palestinians that are killed,
[2:33:46.320 --> 2:33:51.320]  or five Jews that are killed, and you think it was the end of the world.
[2:33:51.320 --> 2:33:57.320]  And it's all anybody talks about. I mean, I think it's an important issue. It's terrible. It's horrible.
[2:33:57.320 --> 2:34:02.320]  But it's manufactured compared to everything else going on, is my point.
[2:34:02.320 --> 2:34:06.320]  You got 15 million people, the UN admits. They're the ones that got it banned.
[2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:10.320]  15 million people a year that die of malaria.
[2:34:10.320 --> 2:34:18.320]  Another 20 million children that starve to death each year. Another 20 million adults or so.
[2:34:18.320 --> 2:34:26.320]  You've got ISIS killing 300,000 people in Syria, non-radical Muslims, Shiite Muslims,
[2:34:26.320 --> 2:34:32.320]  Alawites, and mainly Christians. And they're doing it all over Iraq right now,
[2:34:32.320 --> 2:34:35.320]  funded and armed and commanded by British Special Forces and others.
[2:34:35.320 --> 2:34:40.320]  It's all come out. We know the camps where they were trained. I told you this years ago.
[2:34:40.320 --> 2:34:44.320]  And my issue is I'm sick of everyone setting my agenda.
[2:34:44.320 --> 2:34:48.320]  I mean, you go to the comments on infoworks.com. It's like a battle in there.
[2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:55.320]  Israel's perfect. Israel's the devil. On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[2:34:55.320 --> 2:35:00.320]  And Alex, you know, you work for Israel, or Alex is an anti-Semite, doesn't like Israel.
[2:35:00.320 --> 2:35:08.320]  And my whole issue is my biggest criticism with some of the Israel lobby is the manipulation of our domestic politics.
[2:35:08.320 --> 2:35:13.320]  And a lot of the Israel lobby supports socialism, gun control.
[2:35:13.320 --> 2:35:18.320]  I don't like foreign governments involved in our policies. That's what I criticize with Israel.
[2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:23.320]  The Palestinians, you know, I'm sad for them. They're having a lot of kids.
[2:35:23.320 --> 2:35:28.320]  And I don't know how they live in Gaza. I don't know how they live in a desert by a beach.
[2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:32.320]  And you notice Egypt holding a lot of men.
[2:35:32.320 --> 2:35:36.320]  And you notice Jordan is on the verge of getting overthrown by those folks.
[2:35:36.320 --> 2:35:39.320]  So, I mean, it's kind of like Latin America borders.
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:42.320]  And people say, well, Israel was never right to exist. Blah, blah, blah.
[2:35:42.320 --> 2:35:46.320]  Look, I understand it was put in there as a colony and as a military base.
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:51.320]  It's political by the British Zionists.
[2:35:51.320 --> 2:35:57.320]  And their reason was different than the Jewish Zionists. It's a disaster.
[2:35:57.320 --> 2:36:02.320]  And my point is it's not one group in Israel. It's not one agenda.
[2:36:02.320 --> 2:36:07.320]  And it's the same thing everywhere else. I mean, you've got the Vatican involved setting up the EU.
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:11.320]  And you've got the EU trying to come into countries and basically restrict what the church can do.
[2:36:11.320 --> 2:36:16.320]  It's all these big power structures that get built and then all these people fight over it.
[2:36:16.320 --> 2:36:22.320]  That's my view on it. But I'm just, you know, there's other things other than Israel in this world.
[2:36:22.320 --> 2:36:25.320]  Or people that want me to say the Vatican runs everything.
[2:36:25.320 --> 2:36:29.320]  Or people that want me to say, I mean, I just criticized the Protestant Christian Zionists,
[2:36:29.320 --> 2:36:33.320]  who don't look like Protestants I know.
[2:36:33.320 --> 2:36:39.320]  And then you've got the Vatican promoting gun control in this country and open borders, large sections of it.
[2:36:39.320 --> 2:36:42.320]  I mean, I've got a lot of issues with all of this.
[2:36:42.320 --> 2:36:44.320]  I mean, I actually study what each country does.
[2:36:44.320 --> 2:36:51.320]  Wayne Madsen, you've heard the gestalt I've thrown out here just when I'm thinking about here, what's in my heart.
[2:36:51.320 --> 2:36:57.320]  It's a mess and a tribal fight that I don't have a dog in is what I'm saying.
[2:36:57.320 --> 2:37:00.320]  And there's a bunch of different propagandists involved.
[2:37:00.320 --> 2:37:07.320]  But I don't ever hear all these Israel bashers saying one word about Saudi Arabia and ISIS,
[2:37:07.320 --> 2:37:11.320]  because they almost always endorse anything Islamic.
[2:37:11.320 --> 2:37:13.320]  I mean, it's very bizarre.
[2:37:13.320 --> 2:37:20.320]  And then meanwhile, I've seen no anti-Israel criticism of Netanyahu tacitly endorsing ISIS last month.
[2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:25.320]  And when I criticize that, they go on YouTube and say, shut up, Israeli operative.
[2:37:25.320 --> 2:37:27.320]  We're going to kill you and all the Jews.
[2:37:27.320 --> 2:37:29.320]  Well, they use a different word for it.
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:30.320]  And I'm not even Jewish.
[2:37:30.320 --> 2:37:33.320]  But then I say, fine, if you are obsessed with me being Jewish, I am Jewish.
[2:37:33.320 --> 2:37:34.320]  You see what I'm saying?
[2:37:34.320 --> 2:37:42.320]  I mean, I mean, I am so sick of the mental illness, the shallowness of the public's political understanding.
[2:37:42.320 --> 2:37:43.320]  I agree.
[2:37:43.320 --> 2:37:49.320]  You know, I've written at length about the connections between Saudi Arabia and Israel.
[2:37:49.320 --> 2:37:53.320]  They're historical connections, especially between their intelligence services.
[2:37:53.320 --> 2:37:55.320]  And you're right.
[2:37:55.320 --> 2:38:02.320]  The Israel Defense Force has been coordinating its operations, especially around the Golan Heights with ISIS.
[2:38:02.320 --> 2:38:03.320]  We know that.
[2:38:03.320 --> 2:38:14.320]  And because the common enemy is the Shias of Syria, the Alawites who are a Shias sect in Syria, that's Assad,
[2:38:14.320 --> 2:38:20.320]  the Shia government of Iraq, and the big tamale of them all is Iran.
[2:38:20.320 --> 2:38:25.320]  And, you know, and they want us to actually get involved in a war with Iran.
[2:38:25.320 --> 2:38:26.320]  That has been their goal.
[2:38:26.320 --> 2:38:28.320]  That's been Netanyahu's goal.
[2:38:28.320 --> 2:38:32.320]  Remember he showed that stupid Wiley Coyote bomb at the U.N. General Assembly?
[2:38:32.320 --> 2:38:33.320]  Oh, yeah.
[2:38:33.320 --> 2:38:38.320]  Or he drew this line across as, yeah, here's where Iran is and this is where they're going to be.
[2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:43.320]  And it looked like one of those Wiley Coyote Acme bombs.
[2:38:43.320 --> 2:38:45.320]  Those round bombs.
[2:38:45.320 --> 2:38:54.320]  And, you know, what a ridiculous thing that was up there, but, you know, really sort of juvenile propaganda.
[2:38:54.320 --> 2:39:02.320]  But, you know, it's quite clear that the two problem countries are Saudi Arabia and Israel.
[2:39:02.320 --> 2:39:04.320]  And they work together.
[2:39:04.320 --> 2:39:07.320]  They want to keep the status quo going.
[2:39:07.320 --> 2:39:12.320]  Well, I mean, it was supposedly Saudi Arabia and al-Qaeda that attacked us.
[2:39:12.320 --> 2:39:14.320]  Why do we attack Iraq?
[2:39:14.320 --> 2:39:15.320]  It was a secular country.
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:18.320]  I mean, it's just the public needs to stop being so stupid.
[2:39:18.320 --> 2:39:29.320]  After World War I, yes, the Brits, the French created these artificial states of Iraq and Syria.
[2:39:29.320 --> 2:39:36.320]  And after World War II, we had to put these strong men in charge, a series of them.
[2:39:36.320 --> 2:39:42.320]  Saddam Hussein was just the latest one and then Syria Assad and then his son.
[2:39:42.320 --> 2:39:48.320]  And isn't he an angel even though it was terrible that the CIA put in in 1979?
[2:39:48.320 --> 2:39:51.320]  Wouldn't he be considered an angel compared to ISIS?
[2:39:51.320 --> 2:39:52.320]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:39:52.320 --> 2:40:00.320]  You know, I mean, it's now should be clear to everyone that because we created these states, these artificial states,
[2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:03.320]  and we wanted to keep those borders intact.
[2:40:03.320 --> 2:40:08.320]  We had to keep Saddam in power and Assad and Gaddafi and Libya.
[2:40:08.320 --> 2:40:09.320]  That country's fallen apart.
[2:40:09.320 --> 2:40:16.320]  What happened to the CIA and the power structure that they went from trying to put stable regimes in and water systems
[2:40:16.320 --> 2:40:20.320]  and let the population, you know, go to college and control it.
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:25.320]  But they had some basic freedom to try to put al-Qaeda in blowing up every church,
[2:40:25.320 --> 2:40:30.320]  slitting women's throats, mutilating people, crucifying Christians upside down,
[2:40:30.320 --> 2:40:34.320]  trying to overthrow the Egyptian government and put in them.
[2:40:34.320 --> 2:40:39.320]  I mean, it really is like a Jacobin French Revolution craziness.
[2:40:39.320 --> 2:40:41.320]  What happened at the CIA?
[2:40:41.320 --> 2:40:46.320]  I know it's been bad since it got set up in, you know, 1947 with the National Security Act.
[2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:51.320]  But my God, it's like a James Bond supervillain now.
[2:40:51.320 --> 2:40:52.320]  Oh, it's not even.
[2:40:52.320 --> 2:40:57.320]  I think it's they have no adult supervision there because I think of Brennan,
[2:40:57.320 --> 2:41:00.320]  a guy like Brennan, he's like a knuckle-dragger.
[2:41:00.320 --> 2:41:06.320]  He probably did kill people when he was in the CIA, clandestine services division.
[2:41:06.320 --> 2:41:10.320]  But yeah, there's another agency.
[2:41:10.320 --> 2:41:17.320]  I found an interesting letter at the Truman Library just a week and a half after John Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.
[2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:20.320]  Hoover wrote a column saying, let's get rid of the CIA.
[2:41:20.320 --> 2:41:21.320]  We got to really reform.
[2:41:21.320 --> 2:41:26.320]  He said it was a big mistake for me to create that agency back in 1947.
[2:41:26.320 --> 2:41:33.320]  Now, why do you think Harry Truman would have said that when everybody else's mind was on the recent assassination of President Kennedy?
[2:41:33.320 --> 2:41:36.320]  I think President Truman knew the CIA had something to do with that.
[2:41:36.320 --> 2:41:38.320]  He probably knew Doc's quack as well.
[2:41:38.320 --> 2:41:40.320]  Yeah, right.
[2:41:40.320 --> 2:41:47.320]  Well, I mean, it's just that the old elite at least wanted stability and prosperity because they could cut a bigger skim off the top.
[2:41:47.320 --> 2:41:51.320]  This elite really does want to screw everybody over.
[2:41:51.320 --> 2:42:01.320]  And my dad always told me that he said, you got to watch not just even the average criminal, but there are people that would rather screw you out of a dollar than make a million dollars with you.
[2:42:01.320 --> 2:42:09.320]  But he said those were usually low-level scumbags like Benny Blanco from the Bronx to use an analogy, a parable from Carlitos Way.
[2:42:09.320 --> 2:42:16.320]  Now it's the elites act like mentally ill deviants.
[2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:21.320]  But they profit in times of conflict and warfare.
[2:42:21.320 --> 2:42:30.320]  A number of these elitists made money off both the allies in the Nazi Germans during World War II and the Japanese.
[2:42:30.320 --> 2:42:37.320]  And I think that's, remember, Rahm Emanuel's favorite line was never let a good crisis go to waste.
[2:42:37.320 --> 2:42:39.320]  And I think we're saying that.
[2:42:39.320 --> 2:42:46.320]  But anyway, with it so long, they just have bravada, what's but arrogance.
[2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:49.320]  So what's the proper term for it?
[2:42:49.320 --> 2:42:51.320]  The hubris.
[2:42:51.320 --> 2:42:52.320]  Right, right.
[2:42:52.320 --> 2:43:00.320]  And remember the fear that they had after the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union collapsed, you know, when peace was breaking out around the world.
[2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:05.320]  Notice, notice how that old man Bush 41 had started talking about a new world order.
[2:43:05.320 --> 2:43:10.320]  You know, I think that was the code saying, look, we, we've got to be able to handle this new situation.
[2:43:10.320 --> 2:43:16.320]  Remember how they tried to prop up the so-called reformer Gorbachev?
[2:43:16.320 --> 2:43:17.320]  Yeah.
[2:43:17.320 --> 2:43:18.320]  Yeah.
[2:43:18.320 --> 2:43:21.320]  Well, he turned out to be, you know, you know, a total judge.
[2:43:21.320 --> 2:43:25.320]  And here's a guy who walks hand in glove with people like George Soros today.
[2:43:25.320 --> 2:43:27.320]  It's truly disgusting.
[2:43:27.320 --> 2:43:34.320]  I mean, isn't it bizarre that George Soros to be a Nazi collaborator rounding up people and finding where the Jews were hidden?
[2:43:34.320 --> 2:43:37.320]  He's the perfect James Bond villain.
[2:43:37.320 --> 2:43:39.320]  You mentioned James Bond earlier.
[2:43:39.320 --> 2:43:42.320]  I mean, Ian Fleming should have met this guy Soros.
[2:43:42.320 --> 2:43:44.320]  Maybe he did when he was younger.
[2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:50.320]  Maybe he met his dad who was equally as complicit with the Nazis in Hungary.
[2:43:50.320 --> 2:43:57.320]  Well, I mean, look at how Marilyn Albright relished attacking Serbia, who had saved her and her dad.
[2:43:57.320 --> 2:44:06.320]  Exactly. Also, she had stolen artwork that was purlying from her father out of Prague that he took through Belgrade on his way to the United States.
[2:44:06.320 --> 2:44:10.320]  So it turns out they'd been double dealing with the Nazis.
[2:44:10.320 --> 2:44:11.320]  Oh, them too.
[2:44:11.320 --> 2:44:12.320]  Yeah, sure.
[2:44:12.320 --> 2:44:21.320]  I mean, you know, maybe, you know, they have this constitutional amendment that only, you know, presidents and vice presidents have to be natural born citizens.
[2:44:21.320 --> 2:44:24.320]  Maybe that should be extended to the secretary of state position.
[2:44:24.320 --> 2:44:31.320]  That would eliminate people like Marilyn Albright and Henry Kissinger, who did a lot of damage.
[2:44:31.320 --> 2:44:37.320]  Let's face it to the secretary of state position and also maybe throw in the national security advisor.
[2:44:37.320 --> 2:44:40.320]  Then we wouldn't have had guys like Spignia Brzezinski.
[2:44:40.320 --> 2:44:41.320]  Sure.
[2:44:41.320 --> 2:44:52.320]  When you look at Albright and Soros and a lot of these people, these are Jews that escaped Nazi Germany with a piece of the hoard because they were managers over Jews shelling them out.
[2:44:52.320 --> 2:44:54.320]  This has come out.
[2:44:54.320 --> 2:45:01.320]  And then they run off with a bunch of the Nazi hoard to then rule over us. It's disgusting.
[2:45:01.320 --> 2:45:12.320]  Yeah, I think maybe the founders had a good point when they put in that you had to be a natural born citizen to become president and vice president.
[2:45:12.320 --> 2:45:16.320]  I just think maybe it's time to extend that to some other positions of government.
[2:45:16.320 --> 2:45:24.320]  Well, for me, it's surreal because one grandfather has been dead 20 plus years, the other 10 years, they were both in the Army Air Corps, both almost died.
[2:45:24.320 --> 2:45:26.320]  I won't go into all those stories.
[2:45:26.320 --> 2:45:29.320]  Over Europe, Germany, Italy, you name it.
[2:45:29.320 --> 2:45:41.320]  And then George Soros is a living fossil Nazi collaborator and he's got news articles saying I'm a Nazi and he's trying to overthrow the free press.
[2:45:41.320 --> 2:45:50.320]  It's surreal that my grandfathers are dead in the ground fighting Nazis and a Nazi collaborator against his own people is trying to overthrow my country.
[2:45:50.320 --> 2:45:53.320]  I mean, it's just it's like a movie. It's bizarre.
[2:45:53.320 --> 2:45:58.320]  Absolutely. Well, we also had Prescott Bush, the father of Brown Brother Harriman.
[2:45:58.320 --> 2:46:04.320]  Yeah, he was the he was the banker for the Nazis on Wall Street and he became a senator from Connecticut.
[2:46:04.320 --> 2:46:09.320]  And of course, the rest of his family's history as they say is history.
[2:46:09.320 --> 2:46:15.320]  Well, that's it. I mean, the loot of Europe for those that don't know the Germans emptied out treasure hordes.
[2:46:15.320 --> 2:46:23.320]  The Rothschilds even got double cross and a bunch of them got killed by Hitler and they emptied out treasure hordes of art gold, you name it, that are just unfathomable.
[2:46:23.320 --> 2:46:25.320]  And then that's why they wanted the rat line.
[2:46:25.320 --> 2:46:28.320]  30 plus thousand Nazis wasn't just the science.
[2:46:28.320 --> 2:46:38.320]  They all paid to get out just like rich Jews paid Madeline Albright's dad and people to get out and Soros to get out.
[2:46:38.320 --> 2:46:43.320]  And so there was a whole business that's on record with Hitler of him letting people get out.
[2:46:43.320 --> 2:46:49.320]  And so that money has been used all the way until now as political dynasties.
[2:46:49.320 --> 2:46:52.320]  That's the word on the Bushes. They're much more rich than we're told.
[2:46:52.320 --> 2:47:07.320]  And that's why CIA nobody would become the vice president from nowhere with Bush, Herbert Walker, because they were managers at Brown Brother Harriman over the Latin American cookie jars of Nazi money.
[2:47:07.320 --> 2:47:09.320]  Right. And this is why it's so important.
[2:47:09.320 --> 2:47:13.320]  You mentioned the CIA going in there and changing Wikipedia.
[2:47:13.320 --> 2:47:16.320]  They're not the only ones doing it. A lot of people are changing Wikipedia.
[2:47:16.320 --> 2:47:19.320]  I do not recommend Wikipedia to be used at all.
[2:47:19.320 --> 2:47:24.320]  They've got a they've got a bogus page on myself.
[2:47:24.320 --> 2:47:32.320]  I've threatened them with lawsuits to no avail because they're too big and they hide behind this volunteer rubric.
[2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:35.320]  But they're definitely they're revising history.
[2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:37.320]  All that we're discussing.
[2:47:37.320 --> 2:47:40.320]  Sure. Sure. To be clear, I use them sometimes because the bibliography is good.
[2:47:40.320 --> 2:47:43.320]  But one will be pure bull. One will be a good bibliography.
[2:47:43.320 --> 2:47:48.320]  So the bibliographies might be useful, but you got to watch it all very, very closely.
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:53.320]  So I agree. The general public shouldn't believe a word in there unless you've been studying this for a long time.
[2:47:53.320 --> 2:47:57.320]  Right. And the thing is, many of them in their bibliography, many of the links are broken.
[2:47:57.320 --> 2:48:04.320]  They don't they do nothing to restore the links or to take out the information that are based on those links.
[2:48:04.320 --> 2:48:11.320]  And so, yeah, it's hard. Yeah. For the periodic table of elements, yeah, they're not going to go in there and change that.
[2:48:11.320 --> 2:48:20.320]  But anything on people, biographies or political historical issues, yes, it's it's it's right with propaganda and false information.
[2:48:20.320 --> 2:48:25.320]  Yep. Let's go to Jeremy in California. Thanks for holding it on the air with Wayne Madsen.
[2:48:25.320 --> 2:48:27.320]  Yes. Hello. Can you hear me, Mr. John?
[2:48:27.320 --> 2:48:28.320]  You're loud and clear.
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:30.320]  All right. Thank you for taking my call.
[2:48:30.320 --> 2:48:34.320]  I just have a message of peace and prosperity. I'm a state owned dad of two girls.
[2:48:34.320 --> 2:48:37.320]  I'm also a disabled veteran VA priority two.
[2:48:37.320 --> 2:48:47.320]  And I was calling because my experience of hope and it starts in a garden, a natural garden, a garden that has a culture as diverse as liberty itself.
[2:48:47.320 --> 2:48:54.320]  And I want to get this message across to my citizen by one on every American citizen to be bored and free.
[2:48:54.320 --> 2:48:55.320]  I can't stand.
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:48:58.320]  No, here, that's very exciting. You have a question for Wayne?
[2:48:58.320 --> 2:49:08.320]  Yeah, well, yes, yes and no, I have a question that if someone was to give away birthrights for a dollar, would you be willing to pay a dollar?
[2:49:08.320 --> 2:49:13.320]  Would you give your soul up for worldly power?
[2:49:13.320 --> 2:49:21.320]  I'm not for sale. I gave up good paying jobs.
[2:49:21.320 --> 2:49:30.320]  You know, one in the national security community because I opposed what I saw happening back in the 90s.
[2:49:30.320 --> 2:49:35.320]  So I went from a $90,000 a year job, which wasn't bad money back then.
[2:49:35.320 --> 2:49:36.320]  That's like $200,000.
[2:49:36.320 --> 2:49:42.320]  Yeah, like I went from that to eating canned tuna fish and baked beans.
[2:49:42.320 --> 2:49:44.320]  So I'm not for sale.
[2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:46.320]  Well, I was about to say, I can't even sell out.
[2:49:46.320 --> 2:49:49.320]  I mean, I just will not go along with this.
[2:49:49.320 --> 2:49:51.320]  Collard, did you have anything else for him?
[2:49:51.320 --> 2:49:53.320]  Because it says you want to talk about the Constitution.
[2:49:53.320 --> 2:49:55.320]  I used to take 240 purchases a month.
[2:49:55.320 --> 2:50:02.320]  I was discharged on OxyContin and for four years I haven't taken a single VA medicine, fading my fellow.
[2:50:02.320 --> 2:50:07.320]  Well, that's a whole other story, how they drug the troops on purpose to then revoke their rights later.
[2:50:07.320 --> 2:50:08.320]  I appreciate your call.
[2:50:08.320 --> 2:50:09.320]  Well, we'll just go to the end with this.
[2:50:09.320 --> 2:50:11.320]  One more segment and you'll be gone in 10 minutes, Wayne.
[2:50:11.320 --> 2:50:12.320]  Short break coming up.
[2:50:12.320 --> 2:50:14.320]  But briefly, what do you think of the VA scandal?
[2:50:14.320 --> 2:50:25.320]  Oh, well, I just have to say that I'm in the VA system myself and after we had the revelations about those poor vets that died in Arizona,
[2:50:25.320 --> 2:50:30.320]  I got a call from the VA saying, hey, we had a check that giving you a checkup recently.
[2:50:30.320 --> 2:50:31.320]  Can you come in?
[2:50:31.320 --> 2:50:35.320]  So yeah, it looks like those poor people died.
[2:50:35.320 --> 2:50:44.320]  So the VA could be, you know, shaken up to start looking after some of the people that they're supposed to look after.
[2:50:44.320 --> 2:50:50.320]  Notice they had a secret death list and they're now taking them off working on vets to work on the illegals.
[2:50:50.320 --> 2:50:57.320]  We're going to come back and go right to Ned and then on to Shelly, Sam and others.
[2:50:57.320 --> 2:50:59.320]  Final segment straight ahead.
[2:50:59.320 --> 2:51:00.320]  This is Dan Billet.
[2:51:00.320 --> 2:51:02.320]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[2:51:02.320 --> 2:51:04.320]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[2:51:04.320 --> 2:51:07.320]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[2:51:07.320 --> 2:51:09.320]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[2:51:09.320 --> 2:51:14.320]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[2:51:14.320 --> 2:51:18.320]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[2:51:18.320 --> 2:51:22.320]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[2:51:22.320 --> 2:51:29.320]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, that's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, DanPillet.com.
[2:51:29.320 --> 2:51:38.320]  Today, the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[2:51:38.320 --> 2:51:45.320]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[2:51:45.320 --> 2:51:49.320]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[2:51:49.320 --> 2:51:52.320]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[2:51:52.320 --> 2:51:54.320]  It's time to understand the system.

[2:52:06.320 --> 2:52:14.320]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[2:52:14.320 --> 2:52:19.320]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[2:52:19.320 --> 2:52:23.320]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[2:52:23.320 --> 2:52:29.320]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[2:52:29.320 --> 2:52:32.320]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.

[2:53:59.320 --> 2:54:05.320]  I'm going to do a bit of overdrive to hit some stories we haven't gotten to yet.
[2:54:05.320 --> 2:54:13.320]  Adia Wright-Pradar, scientists babbled by gigantic 262-foot hole that's appeared on Siberia's end of the world.
[2:54:13.320 --> 2:54:17.320]  That's coming up. I'm going to hit some other news right now. Let's go to your calls.
[2:54:17.320 --> 2:54:24.320]  Thanks for holding with Wayne Madsen. I'm Alex Jones, your host, Ned in Pennsylvania. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:54:24.320 --> 2:54:26.320]  Hi, Wayne.
[2:54:26.320 --> 2:54:36.320]  It seems like the Bergdahl exchange coincided with the ISIS crisis. Usually those who go on tarmac will be used to bolster the ranks of ISIS.
[2:54:36.320 --> 2:54:38.320]  Do you think we'll see more exchanges?
[2:54:38.320 --> 2:54:45.320]  Well, I'm going to interrupt. The second command of ISIS is a graduate of Gitmo.
[2:54:45.320 --> 2:55:00.320]  Right. Well, Bergdadi, the guy who says he's the college now, was being held also in Abu Ghraib. Apparently told the US troops there when he was releasing.
[2:55:00.320 --> 2:55:06.320]  Hey, I'll see you guys in New York in a couple of years. That's a lot. Talk about Hoopers.
[2:55:06.320 --> 2:55:19.320]  Well, these Taliban guys that were released from Gitmo are supposed to go to Qatar, where they're supposed to be under surveillance for a period of time.
[2:55:19.320 --> 2:55:32.320]  But let's keep in mind one thing. Qatar is one of the other countries other than Saudi Arabia that's provided funding and weapons to the Syrian ISIL and Syrian ISIL.
[2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:40.320]  I mean, it's a graduation center for double agents, in my view. Shelly. Shelly in Canada, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:55:40.320 --> 2:55:42.320]  Hi, Alex. Hi, Wayne.
[2:55:42.320 --> 2:55:57.320]  I don't know if this is a question or a comment, but I just, I find that the comments that Obama has made with regard to his concern that there's a nuke in New York.
[2:55:57.320 --> 2:56:07.320]  I read that gun confiscation is also going to start in New York. So do you think there's, I mean, obviously everything Obama does is planned out.
[2:56:07.320 --> 2:56:12.320]  Yeah, are the globalists willing to set off a nuke in New York to bring in total martial law, Wayne Madsen?
[2:56:12.320 --> 2:56:21.320]  Well, you know, we've had a series of movies and remember, you know, we have a fear about this predictive programming.
[2:56:21.320 --> 2:56:27.320]  We see in movies sometimes happening in real life. We've seen that scenario play out in a number of them.
[2:56:27.320 --> 2:56:37.320]  And yeah, I think it's always a fear that they might try something like that. But, you know, the number of deaths will certainly be much more than what happened.
[2:56:37.320 --> 2:56:43.320]  Well, I mean, they're total maniacs. They're clearly involved in 9-11. The sky's the limit. I mean, they're funding ISIS. Why not?
[2:56:43.320 --> 2:56:56.320]  Right. Well, I mean, that's why I think we've got, we've got to bring these intelligence agencies under control because, and then we have Homeland Security now and the director of the National Intelligence.
[2:56:56.320 --> 2:57:03.320]  So we have more of these agencies now than we had in the past, even on 9-11.
[2:57:03.320 --> 2:57:09.320]  Let's talk to David in New Jersey real quick. David in New Jersey, your question is where are the heroes? Go ahead.
[2:57:09.320 --> 2:57:22.320]  Yeah, Alex, I appreciate your time. And, you know, you guys have a great show and I've listened for a very long time. And then I keep burning down and getting down to the bottom of what's actually happening.
[2:57:22.320 --> 2:57:33.320]  And, you know, I study, you know, beyond what you suggest and it scares me. And I just get to the point where I just have to ask the question, like, where are the heroes?
[2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:39.320]  You know, and we've got Wayne Mattron on air right now and we've had Ron Paul on. There's people fighting back everywhere, brother.
[2:57:39.320 --> 2:57:50.320]  Alex, I understand that, but I'm saying we have the zeros, you know, in terms of what we read and we go on and on and on. It's extensive. It goes back to Brzezinski.
[2:57:50.320 --> 2:57:56.320]  Well, David, I'm out of time, but it's a great question. Where are the heroes? Real fast, Wayne. We've got 20 seconds.
[2:57:56.320 --> 2:58:06.320]  They're here. Look, we mentioned Bill Benny earlier, Tom Drake. That's just an NSA. Bill Benny worked in the head office of NSA when I worked there.
[2:58:06.320 --> 2:58:12.320]  So, I mean, I would have never gotten a chance to talk to him when I was an NSA. He was way up on the top.
[2:58:12.320 --> 2:58:20.320]  Yeah, we have to celebrate the heroes we have now and supplant the dinosaur media. Wayne Mattronport.com. Thanks for the time, brother. Great job.
[2:58:20.320 --> 2:58:21.320]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[2:58:21.320 --> 2:58:27.320]  Well, we did almost two hours with Wayne. Always great to have him on. Remember, this hour was brought to you by mypatriotsupply.com.
[2:58:27.320 --> 2:58:33.320]  Ford slash Alex, the best horrible foods out there, super high quality. With all this instability, you're crazy if you don't have the high quality foods.
[2:58:33.320 --> 2:58:45.320]  Mypatriotsupply.com. Ford slash Alex, or 866-229-0927. Five minutes of overdrive coming up. I'm going to wrap it up with a couple calls from Sam and Paul with a few news articles.
[2:58:45.320 --> 2:58:47.320]  Stay with us, gclive.com.
[2:58:47.320 --> 2:58:59.320]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grobe. It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[2:58:59.320 --> 2:59:10.320]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[2:59:10.320 --> 2:59:20.320]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[2:59:20.320 --> 2:59:28.320]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today. It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[2:59:28.320 --> 2:59:32.320]  Experience the new formula. Experience the ancient purity.
[2:59:32.320 --> 2:59:39.320]  Shield your family. Survival Shield X2. Available now at infowarslife.com.
[2:59:39.320 --> 2:59:47.320]  X2 from infowarslife.com or call toll 3-888-253-3139.
[2:59:50.320 --> 2:59:58.320]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[2:59:58.320 --> 3:00:17.320]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:17.320 --> 3:00:21.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:00:21.320 --> 3:00:32.320]  This is absolute pure bull. Customs and Border Patrol and Homeland Security SWAT teams that descended a few days ago on an Illinois small town of 850.
[3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:37.320]  They now say it was to get one guy who might have had child porn on a computer.
[3:00:37.320 --> 3:00:44.320]  The only way that is, if it was some congressman or something they want to cover up, that is not. And that's not their jurisdiction.
[3:00:44.320 --> 3:00:51.320]  A bunch of helicopters and armored vehicles. It was a drill. They had the local kids loading on the armored vehicles and all the rest of it.
[3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:54.320]  I don't buy any of it. But that story is up on infowars.com.
[3:00:54.320 --> 3:01:02.320]  Meanwhile, mother jailed child taken by social services after her child played in the park who was 9 across the street.
[3:01:02.320 --> 3:01:07.320]  I mean, this is just, they can define anything they want as child endangerment. Makes me sick.
[3:01:07.320 --> 3:01:14.320]  Meanwhile, Alcada is murdering children all over the world. Our government funds them. It's just a total fraud. All of it.
[3:01:14.320 --> 3:01:20.320]  It's all pointed at you as a senior NSA officer, one of the top guys in the agency.
[3:01:20.320 --> 3:01:25.320]  William Benning has told you it's totalitarianism pointed at you and your family.
[3:01:25.320 --> 3:01:29.320]  Total social control. Close quote. Period.
[3:01:29.320 --> 3:01:35.320]  And all these, you know, journalists and reporters are saying what it's like to live in the police state and to live in Stasiville.
[3:01:35.320 --> 3:01:39.320]  See, I was right again. And I don't want to be right, people.
[3:01:39.320 --> 3:01:42.320]  I want you to realize I'm not making this stuff up.
[3:01:42.320 --> 3:01:46.320]  But I shouldn't even quasi-joke around about Michelle being a tranny. That was wrong.
[3:01:46.320 --> 3:01:50.320]  And not that they even attacked me for it. Injustifies the means.
[3:01:50.320 --> 3:01:55.320]  I just get real cynical in a bad mood sometimes and make sick jokes out of things.
[3:01:55.320 --> 3:01:58.320]  Because who knows if such liars, it could be true.
[3:01:58.320 --> 3:02:03.320]  You know, there could be, you know, leprechauns in Ireland as well.
[3:02:03.320 --> 3:02:05.320]  Santa Claus might be real.
[3:02:05.320 --> 3:02:08.320]  The point is, I don't believe anything. I just defile these people.
[3:02:08.320 --> 3:02:11.320]  They're nothing to me. I hate them.
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:13.320]  So, I mean, you know, whatever.
[3:02:13.320 --> 3:02:18.320]  Maybe Obama's space alien. I'm being sarcastic, folks.
[3:02:18.320 --> 3:02:23.320]  What I know is they're scum. And I don't worship them and I'm not afraid of them.
[3:02:23.320 --> 3:02:29.320]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories that seduce Republicans.
[3:02:29.320 --> 3:02:32.320]  It's an internet talk show called Info Wars.
[3:02:32.320 --> 3:02:37.320]  Yes, this is the same guy who has been selling the idea that the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School
[3:02:37.320 --> 3:02:40.320]  and the massacre at Aurora, Colorado were actually fake.
[3:02:40.320 --> 3:02:45.320]  They were faked as an excuse to take away our guns and enslave us to the giant wasps
[3:02:45.320 --> 3:02:48.320]  who have beneath the U.N. building or whatever.
[3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:50.320]  See, I never said that.
[3:02:50.320 --> 3:02:53.320]  So that's why I shouldn't even joke about Michelle Obama looking like a man.
[3:02:53.320 --> 3:02:57.320]  I mean, that'd be like saying Janet Reno looks like a man.
[3:02:57.320 --> 3:03:02.320]  Chromosomally, she might be. I mean, a lot of those women have the brains of men that's come out.
[3:03:02.320 --> 3:03:06.320]  I mean, that's science literature. That was the point I was getting at.
[3:03:06.320 --> 3:03:12.320]  Michelle looks like she's a snapping turtle, so I believe she's a transvestite snapping turtle.
[3:03:12.320 --> 3:03:17.320]  Sam, that's a joke, too, folks. Sam in California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:03:17.320 --> 3:03:22.320]  Hey, Alex, man, I hope you every day you find some peace when you leave your job, man,
[3:03:22.320 --> 3:03:26.320]  because it's got to be rough doing this every day, day in, day out.
[3:03:26.320 --> 3:03:28.320]  But it's also a lot of fun.
[3:03:28.320 --> 3:03:33.320]  I hope so. I hope it is. I hope you can make it as fun as you possibly could, because this is rough.
[3:03:33.320 --> 3:03:37.320]  I got five quick things I wrote on a piece of paper, so I don't take up much of your time.
[3:03:37.320 --> 3:03:38.320]  Go ahead, bubble.
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:41.320]  So first thing, people, it's about morality.
[3:03:41.320 --> 3:03:43.320]  Okay, you've got to be a moral person.
[3:03:43.320 --> 3:03:46.320]  If you're not, then you're part of that. You're part of the problem.
[3:03:46.320 --> 3:03:50.320]  And it's a 50-50. If you want to look at it scientifically, it's 50-50.
[3:03:50.320 --> 3:03:54.320]  50% chance there is something after we die. 50% chance there isn't.
[3:03:54.320 --> 3:03:58.320]  Now, on the off chance that there is something, that's too big of a chance.
[3:03:58.320 --> 3:04:02.320]  But there is something. Your kids are going to live on and pay for the bad stuff you do.
[3:04:02.320 --> 3:04:06.320]  So there is life after death through your children in debates.
[3:04:06.320 --> 3:04:08.320]  I'm going to give them that for the sake of argument.
[3:04:08.320 --> 3:04:13.320]  But eternity is too long to be playing around with that 50% is what I'm trying to get at.
[3:04:13.320 --> 3:04:20.320]  So the solution that I'm going with is stop the funding, stop paying taxes, stop reporting.
[3:04:20.320 --> 3:04:22.320]  That's the only way. Let them come out. They don't have enough agents.
[3:04:22.320 --> 3:04:27.320]  Well, I mean, I'll say this. That's what people are getting the point of.
[3:04:27.320 --> 3:04:31.320]  And the illegals are above the law. So the governments above the law and the rich are above the law.
[3:04:31.320 --> 3:04:34.320]  So why not? Well, we fall into a third-world country.
[3:04:34.320 --> 3:04:36.320]  Well, it's better than the globalist start in World War III.
[3:04:36.320 --> 3:04:39.320]  Look, I'm out of time. Sorry to Paul. Sorry to Sam.
[3:04:39.320 --> 3:04:42.320]  Back tomorrow, Lord Willen. Pray for us. 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central.
[3:04:42.320 --> 3:04:45.320]  I want to thank the crew. Another great job. Our guest, Wayne Madsen.
[3:04:45.320 --> 3:04:47.320]  We'll check it on Serious Girl. See where she's at.
[3:04:47.320 --> 3:04:51.320]  And Nightly News is tonight. I will make an appearance on the Nightly News.
[3:04:51.320 --> 3:04:54.320]  I'm going to tape some of the Nightly News to scramble the X-Wings.
[3:04:54.320 --> 3:05:23.320]  And we'll see you back tomorrow.
