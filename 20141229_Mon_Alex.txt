[01:51.040 --> 01:56.080]  cardinal because it's supposedly a guardian organization of the Catholic Church so it's
[01:56.080 --> 02:00.920]  it's like third world countries always have the military takeover or it's like back in Rome you

[10:36.920 --> 10:45.400]  headlines seed libraries struggle with state laws limiting exchange no we're not talking about marijuana
[10:45.400 --> 10:54.840]  seeds mary jane we're talking about heirloom seeds being targeted worldwide by laws that are getting
[10:54.840 --> 11:04.280]  passed by the big gmo companies to not let people save and pass on some seed varieties that are over
[11:04.280 --> 11:15.080]  six thousand years old the ultimate crime is having a garden or saving your seeds or having a swap
[11:15.080 --> 11:21.960]  meat or shopping at thrift shops or shopping at local shops this is how you control a population
[11:21.960 --> 11:25.960]  you're not allowed to shop outside the company store you're not allowed to shop outside the
[11:25.960 --> 11:30.360]  plantation store you're not allowed to shop outside the reservation store

[11:46.520 --> 11:52.360]  of spots around the country are sharing seeds as part of an increasing interest in locally
[11:52.360 --> 12:01.400]  grown food but some agriculture officials say the well-meaning effort violates state laws in
[12:01.400 --> 12:08.920]  spots like diluth minnesota the conflict has surprised gardeners and library officials who
[12:08.920 --> 12:18.680]  never thought to examine the intricacies of state seed laws agriculture officials say they weren't
[12:18.680 --> 12:24.200]  looking for a fight but must enforce laws that are intended to protect farmers by ensuring seeds
[12:24.200 --> 12:31.160]  are viable will grow the intended plant aren't mixed with unwanted seeds or weeds or plants yes
[12:31.160 --> 12:37.480]  that's right you're not allowed to trade seeds because because there's seed purity laws there are
[12:37.480 --> 12:41.080]  a lot of old laws i have family that have been farmers from any generations on both sides but
[12:41.720 --> 12:47.320]  they're old laws on you selling bags of seeds they better be what you claim they are but that's a
[12:47.320 --> 12:52.840]  civil issue this country did great without all these laws now they're bringing it in just like i
[12:52.840 --> 13:01.800]  saw in um michigan and in oklahoma the last few years where they passed laws or had city councils
[13:01.800 --> 13:10.600]  come out in the case of um in the case of uh it's it's it's the second big city in uh oklahoma it's
[13:10.600 --> 13:17.720]  not oklahoma city um it's the one jacarys from tulsa tulsa yeah tulsa came out and tried to pass
[13:17.720 --> 13:23.400]  a law banning backyard gardens and the city council had statements like because we don't
[13:23.400 --> 13:27.960]  know what you're growing it could be marijuana see oh my gosh you're growing something we need to
[13:27.960 --> 13:32.840]  have an inspection because you might you know prisoners can't grow things in their backyards
[13:34.040 --> 13:38.040]  this is why they have a war on lemonade stands that forbes has written about it's why they have a
[13:38.040 --> 13:43.880]  war on swap meets a war on christmas markets a war on raw milk a war on the amish
[13:46.440 --> 13:54.120]  because a wild human an independent human is an enemy human in the corporate globalist google
[13:54.120 --> 14:03.800]  microsoft takeover system so knowing how to sew knowing how to make a fire knowing how to do basic
[14:03.800 --> 14:08.840]  metallurgy knowing how to fix an engine but that's why they don't want you to know any of those basics
[14:08.840 --> 14:16.280]  anymore in the great depression 1929 we've read the national studies here on air 90 percent of
[14:16.280 --> 14:22.360]  the country was rural and most of them self-sufficient or somewhat self-sufficient today look up the number
[14:24.440 --> 14:32.840]  90 right at 90 again percent of the united states lives in a city or in a suburban setting
[14:32.840 --> 14:38.680]  10 live in the country and wait for it of the 10 percent live in the country about half are
[14:38.680 --> 14:43.880]  seeing a self-sufficient in major studies by the federal government itself so we've gone from 90
[14:43.880 --> 14:50.920]  percent on the land to 10 percent on the land we've gone from over 50 percent totally self-sufficient
[14:50.920 --> 14:57.320]  to 5 percent that are self-sufficient and let me tell you it's weird if you know how to skin a
[14:57.320 --> 15:03.320]  buck around a trot line homeland security says look out for those people i see articles every year
[15:03.320 --> 15:08.840]  of somebody in the country skinning a deer by a major road on their own property and you know what
[15:08.840 --> 15:14.600]  the cops come because people drive by and they see an animal being cut up and they think it's animal
[15:14.600 --> 15:22.040]  abuse and the police come and they act like something's wrong because they've been trained
[15:22.040 --> 15:28.360]  that when you get called while you got to act like something's been done wrong now i've got 100
[15:28.360 --> 15:33.240]  articles or more i want to cover here today but that's the domestication that we've gone under
[15:35.800 --> 15:43.240]  all of the instincts that like electricity are transmitted through our dna right back to the
[15:43.240 --> 15:52.600]  beginnings of our origins are there in the genetic memory we have magnetic cells in our brains in our
[15:52.600 --> 15:59.160]  spinal cords and in our guts and in our heart in hundreds and hundreds of studies i'm about to cover
[15:59.160 --> 16:06.360]  one right now where we are connected to the moon the sun the earth's polarity the gravitational
[16:06.360 --> 16:15.320]  field changes in that and the globalists have known this for 100 plus years and they have been
[16:15.320 --> 16:20.600]  manipulating it you don't just think they're trying to shut down the amish and trying to shut down
[16:20.600 --> 16:28.600]  backyard gardens do you and trying to shut down seed exchanges for no reason worldwide we are being
[16:28.600 --> 16:36.600]  destroyed as a species by the technocrats in their own words and and as i talk about your
[16:36.600 --> 16:43.240]  ancestors can touch you an ancestor three thousand years ago whether africa europe asia it doesn't
[16:43.240 --> 16:51.080]  matter mezzo america 3000 5000 6000 is physically connected to you because your mother and your
[16:51.080 --> 16:56.040]  father touched them and came out of them their mother and their father touched them and were
[16:56.040 --> 17:03.320]  raised by them it is a genetic electrical transmission of data and genetics that is magic
[17:04.200 --> 17:11.320]  and that's under attack with the gmo that within three generations just bt corn alone turns guinea
[17:11.320 --> 17:16.840]  pigs into blind mentally retarded creatures if they're lucky to live with tumors all over their
[17:16.840 --> 17:22.280]  bodies we're already now going into the second generation of attack autism set by 2025 to be half
[17:22.280 --> 17:29.880]  the population we are under mega attack the data is incontrovertible and the reason i mentioned that
[17:29.880 --> 17:37.080]  is here's this article this is out of fox news seals may have natural gps i love how they always
[17:37.080 --> 17:42.920]  have old articles as if they're new it's been known for decades that seals can even have goggles put
[17:42.920 --> 17:49.240]  on them they could be dropped in and know where they're going they have magnetic gps beyond echo
[17:49.240 --> 17:57.960]  location with bats so do we folks peter radgic the editor of the atlantic sun and the us national
[17:57.960 --> 18:04.040]  science foundation to live science contributed to this fox news report while hunting
[18:06.120 --> 18:11.080]  weddle seals have biological adaptations that allow them to dive deep as much as hundreds of
[18:11.080 --> 18:16.040]  meters but also to uncannily ability to find the breathing holes they need on the surface of the
[18:16.040 --> 18:22.280]  ice now researchers supported by the us national science foundation nsf believe they have figured
[18:22.280 --> 18:30.360]  out they really do do it and how they do it by using the earth's magnetic field as a natural gps
[18:30.360 --> 18:35.400]  how do you think butterflies hatch out in canada and fly all the way to central mexico the monarch
[18:36.920 --> 18:42.040]  takes three four generations to get up to canada and then the big one's born there's four times the
[18:42.040 --> 18:48.360]  size the big b2 bomber and it flies back magnetic they've done the university studies shooting
[18:48.360 --> 18:51.880]  magnetic fields at them they just fall out of the sky why do you think the honeybees are dying
[18:51.880 --> 19:01.000]  along with bt corn the magnetic fields are being jacked and it goes into this animal we think maybe
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.560]  highly evolved the ability to navigate using magnetic sensors in order to find ice holes some
[19:05.560 --> 19:10.360]  doesn't support and get back to them safely and it goes on from there from marine biology university
[19:10.360 --> 19:17.800]  of an m university and just goes on the reason i raise this is i'm gonna tie it in to the red
[19:17.800 --> 19:24.040]  skins and the cowboys getting a whole bunch of fights yesterday when we come back all right
[19:24.040 --> 19:29.160]  and i'm gonna explain how all this works coming up and how we're being manipulated and how they take
[19:32.600 --> 19:39.480]  ritualized memories you name it and create false rivalries in the population to control us
[19:39.480 --> 19:49.720]  using our physical memory our genetic memory you name it it's all coming up some of the deep
[19:49.720 --> 19:55.880]  secrets of how we're controlled and how we can break free this is the ultimate self-help broadcast
[19:55.880 --> 20:03.240]  stay with us the cdc just announced flu vaccines may have the wrong strain of flu virus you may

[24:47.480 --> 24:59.960]  On record by electromagnetic magnified magnetic cell ganglia in the brain, in the heart, and in the gut.
[24:59.960 --> 25:07.560]  On record. In so many studies it'll make your head spin. People that have been in traumatic
[25:07.560 --> 25:13.360]  injuries and had areas of this damage or removed, they found are completely different. We are tied
[25:13.360 --> 25:19.920]  in to not just the magnetic field of the earth but the magnetic field of the sun, the galaxy, the
[25:19.920 --> 25:27.920]  universe around us. That's why they know that birds and mice and other animals sense storms days in
[25:27.920 --> 25:38.720]  advance. Tornadoes days in advance before weather systems have even arrived. Earthquakes days in
[25:38.720 --> 25:48.240]  advance. It's been proven. They knew 60, 70, 80 years ago and they surmised that it was magnetic
[25:48.240 --> 25:58.240]  cells in the brain and now they've got high-powered electromagnetic microscopes, electron microscopes
[25:59.120 --> 26:06.400]  and they know they can cut the part out of a rat's brain and suddenly it doesn't have those
[26:06.400 --> 26:11.200]  senses. That's why you say you feel something in your heart, you feel something in your gut
[26:13.760 --> 26:18.960]  and then those ganglia of cells communicate with your brain that's got the same cells in it.
[26:23.680 --> 26:26.640]  It was first given a scientific name in 1972.
[26:26.640 --> 26:39.520]  How do you pronounce that? Magnetic perception? Magnetoception. Magnetoception is a sense which
[26:39.520 --> 26:46.160]  allows an organism to detect a magnetic field in perceived direction, altitude or location.
[26:46.160 --> 26:50.800]  The sense has been proposed to explain animal navigation in vertebrates and insects
[26:50.800 --> 26:57.440]  and it goes on from there. How does something hatch out of an egg in Canada
[27:01.600 --> 27:04.480]  and then fly all the way south to Mexico like the monarch?
[27:05.680 --> 27:10.960]  And many other species of butterflies, well, do similar things. Well, it's known just like the
[27:10.960 --> 27:17.840]  seals they've proven have this brain tissue. It's the same thing at a pep rally. Why do you go to
[27:17.840 --> 27:23.440]  a pep rally? Because the energy, before you would go to war hundreds of years ago, thousands of
[27:23.440 --> 27:28.560]  years ago, before the men marched off, there'd be a big party the night before to get everybody hyped
[27:28.560 --> 27:36.160]  up and to dance around the fire and to get the energy up. Well, that's hormonal energy, brain
[27:36.160 --> 27:45.040]  energy, psychic energy. What do we see happening with this rivalry of the cowboys and the redskins
[27:45.040 --> 27:49.040]  since both teams were founded, getting in fights with each other and hating each other?
[27:49.040 --> 27:53.520]  Well, part of its cultural and it gets passed on. But if you think about those teams, from the day
[27:53.520 --> 27:58.880]  the cowboys were founded and the redskins were founded and played each other, was it back in the
[27:58.880 --> 28:07.040]  50s? Right through to now, there are people and members of that team that were connected to the
[28:07.040 --> 28:14.240]  next group that comes in. So it's one stream, just like a family, just like genetics, just like
[28:14.240 --> 28:20.320]  common sense that's passed on, just like ritual and culture is passed on. So it's electromagnetic,
[28:20.320 --> 28:28.560]  it's chemical, it's culturally taught. And it's a perfect example of how they organize us into false
[28:28.560 --> 28:36.480]  tribal constructs, false battles, simulated combat that then turns into real combat,
[28:36.480 --> 28:43.920]  to then insert the other messages, like Northrop Grumman ads, showing how in real time,
[28:43.920 --> 28:48.960]  everything we're doing is being tracked, so SWAT teams can attack us to keep us safe.
[28:49.920 --> 28:54.160]  I want to take that new Northrop Grumman ad, I want to find that and download it. I saw it last
[28:54.160 --> 28:59.440]  night during the football game. And I want to, I was watching some of it, about an hour of it,
[28:59.440 --> 29:07.120]  analyze it. And I want to go find that state ad out of Pennsylvania with a satellite spying on you
[29:07.120 --> 29:11.360]  in your backyard. They said, we know where you live, we're watching you, and just show people
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.320]  how they're throwing it in our face now. It's all a giant conditioning operation
[29:17.520 --> 29:20.240]  to take our normal instincts, our normal tribal warfare,
[29:20.240 --> 29:29.680]  and to distract us from the real world. But it's worse than that. And we'll put bookends
[29:29.680 --> 29:36.240]  on this when we come back, get into all the news we haven't hit yet. Asia Air CEO dumped shares
[29:36.240 --> 29:41.760]  days before flight disappeared, moved prompt speculation that Tony Fernandez had prior knowledge.

[36:05.360 --> 36:08.800]  this is the heart of 1776
[36:12.800 --> 36:18.320]  that's right we wrote the book on the police state the info war has been about exposing the
[36:18.320 --> 36:27.280]  global move to turn police forces into un controlled gun confiscating social worker
[36:27.280 --> 36:37.680]  minions of the system and that's now where we live that's now the place we are at in this society
[36:40.080 --> 36:43.840]  that is now the place that we stand
[36:46.240 --> 36:51.840]  the final ingredient is getting moron nerdy wells to start talking about how they want to
[36:51.840 --> 36:58.320]  shoot and kill police to start a war against the police that will finalize their move to the
[36:58.320 --> 37:02.960]  dark side being a paramilitary suppression force against the american people
[37:06.480 --> 37:14.640]  and it's all completely scripted by the social engineers in london in the haig in the netherlands
[37:14.640 --> 37:23.760]  in new york and dc and colorado springs in los angeles it's all a big joke
[37:26.080 --> 37:30.320]  it's all been written about in books it's all been put out by the rand corporation it's all
[37:30.320 --> 37:38.160]  public the global government the the forced inoculations the anthropogenic diseases
[37:38.160 --> 37:47.760]  the binary weapons the social engineers sitting back coldly
[37:49.920 --> 37:54.000]  as if we were nothing but amoebas in a petri dish manipulating our world
[37:55.200 --> 38:03.360]  to paraphrase the opening passages of war the worlds by hg wells who was one of them
[38:03.360 --> 38:08.000]  and wrote nonfiction books admitting it that war the world is an allegory
[38:09.840 --> 38:14.320]  of what the establishment sees us as and what they're doing to us
[38:16.720 --> 38:19.840]  he and burton russell both proposed in different times
[38:21.520 --> 38:25.040]  using atomic bombs to reduce the world population of me big
[38:27.520 --> 38:30.160]  and how a nuclear war might actually be a good thing
[38:30.160 --> 38:39.280]  that's why they call them liberals if you get awards from hitler and give awards to hitler
[38:39.920 --> 38:44.720]  love letters you are hailed as one of the greatest women to ever live and walk the earth
[38:47.040 --> 38:50.560]  if you're a grand dragon you're hailed by the black caucus
[38:52.160 --> 38:55.600]  if you're not you're attacked by the black caucus that's just the way it works
[38:55.600 --> 39:01.520]  talking about margaret sanger and of course senator bird the late senator
[39:04.800 --> 39:08.160]  yeah woman sues city of tulsa for cutting down her edible garden
[39:10.240 --> 39:14.560]  code police six things that surprisingly may be banned in your front yard or backyard
[39:16.160 --> 39:19.200]  i just mentioned those older articles because here's the ap
[39:20.080 --> 39:25.040]  we're all over the country they're trying to ban people exchanging seeds from plants
[39:25.040 --> 39:28.080]  they've grown can't do that without a special license
[39:31.360 --> 39:36.720]  got to end that ancient human activity that started civilization of seed sharing
[39:38.640 --> 39:42.240]  can't make that up huh boy we're such a free country aren't we
[39:44.080 --> 39:50.960]  but don't worry uh pope francis this is in the one in guardian pope francis edict
[39:50.960 --> 39:57.760]  edict i love his edict like obama has edicts now forget congress on carbon taxes or open borders
[39:57.760 --> 40:06.400]  or grabbing our guns or funding al-qaeda or obama care pope francis edict
[40:07.120 --> 40:11.200]  yeah obama's changed obama care over 200 times without law but it's okay because
[40:11.200 --> 40:17.840]  well it's an edict pope francis is edict that he can uh he can keep to himself i guess because
[40:17.840 --> 40:24.080]  i'm not going to follow it on climate change will anger deniers see we're holocaust deniers folks
[40:26.800 --> 40:30.400]  but it is religious so it's it's it's fitting that one of the biggest religious leaders in the
[40:30.400 --> 40:37.280]  world if not the biggest should be telling us we shouldn't be deniers it's like denying christ
[40:38.640 --> 40:45.760]  sacrilege or or they have a word for it heresy in fact in england they've called for lord
[40:45.760 --> 40:51.520]  montan's arrest they've talked about my arrest in major newspapers for being a denier and they even
[40:51.520 --> 41:00.000]  call it heresy maybe after i'm tortured in a dungeon maybe then if there's an inquisition
[41:00.000 --> 41:09.760]  maybe i i i will then behave myself and admit al gore is my sacrament we break bread we think
[41:09.760 --> 41:15.600]  about him and this wine is al gore's blood and this this this bread is his body as he lives in
[41:15.600 --> 41:21.680]  giant mansions and obama says you can't have a car or air conditioning but he can it's how they make
[41:21.680 --> 41:28.720]  it we live in the palace and you're poor and it's trendy how's that sound he's been called the super
[41:28.720 --> 41:34.160]  pope yeah the establishment has been viciously attacking the catholic church for whatever reason
[41:34.160 --> 41:39.680]  there's been a open war on it to infiltrate it to liberalize it to do all these things you
[41:39.680 --> 41:47.360]  can say what you want about its history that's certainly checkered but now oh we have the
[41:47.360 --> 41:51.680]  jesuit pope and i'm no catholic but i've read a lot of history you're not supposed to have
[41:51.680 --> 41:56.720]  anybody in the society of jesus in a high-level position in the catholic church it was a big
[41:56.720 --> 42:04.800]  deal a hundred years ago when they started having cardinals that were jesuits there's a folks like
[42:04.800 --> 42:09.600]  rama govern formerly the cia that exposes the tyranny is super accurate he's a jesuit nice guy
[42:09.600 --> 42:15.040]  respecting but i mean you're not supposed to have jesuits running the catholic church are you
[42:15.920 --> 42:24.160]  i mean i'm just giving you the edicts of all the past popes but now you have the new edict of the
[42:24.160 --> 42:29.200]  jesuit pope that the media says is the most wonderful person in the world because he goes in
[42:29.200 --> 42:33.920]  hugs people that are sick and doesn't have a bunch of security when he randomly shows up out of the
[42:33.920 --> 42:40.640]  blue in a crowd where they know he's safe he's pulling stunts and i don't hate pope francis
[42:40.640 --> 42:48.000]  but i do hate carbon taxes that are a giant stinking fraud pope francis is called for restricting
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  civilian ownership of guns and other horrible tyranny he's called for ecumenical merging of
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.720]  religions boy that doesn't sound too good and it's got a lot of conservative catholics upset
[42:56.720 --> 43:04.560]  hope francis's edict on climate change will anger deniers and u.s. churches the pontiff hopes to
[43:04.560 --> 43:09.920]  inspire action at next year's u.n. meeting in paris in december after visits the philippines and
[43:09.920 --> 43:20.160]  new york yeah third world let us put giant taxes on you right at double it's almost double it came
[43:20.160 --> 43:23.360]  out in the Copenhagen secret treaty and they said no that's our treaty remember five years ago
[43:23.360 --> 43:30.640]  no right at double one point shy of double and then huge taxes on us to stop development except
[43:30.640 --> 43:35.040]  for the elites that are exempt and will kill a billion people according to lord mongton who's
[43:35.040 --> 43:39.920]  a catholic and he's a guy fighting it uh and we ought to get lord mongton on about this and get
[43:39.920 --> 43:46.640]  his view on them making it religious to pay gore and blood the company in london and the Rothschild
[43:46.640 --> 43:51.200]  exchange trillions of dollars a year if they get this through and the surveillance of all human
[43:51.200 --> 43:55.920]  activity to make sure you're complying europe already moving to ban well actually they've done
[43:55.920 --> 44:03.840]  it some areas single family dwellings the new construction of them uh and having wood stoves
[44:03.840 --> 44:07.360]  fireplaces or space eaters don't believe me just type that in
[44:10.480 --> 44:16.000]  he has been called the super pope and it would be hard to deny that pope francis has had a good
[44:16.000 --> 44:23.600]  December oh see it's just a rock star cited by president obama as a key player in thwarting
[44:23.600 --> 44:30.480]  relations between the us and thawing relations between the us and cuba oh he was cited by obama
[44:30.480 --> 44:37.520]  that's incredibly unpopular and hated and a total criminal fraud ooh it's like being cited by by
[44:37.520 --> 44:46.080]  jeffrey dommer the argentinian pontiff followed that by lectures his cardinals on the need to clean
[44:46.080 --> 44:53.520]  up vatican politics oh yes he'll he'll he'll persecutive he wants for a full full jesuit
[44:53.520 --> 45:02.960]  takeover but can francis achieve a feat that has so far eluded secular powers and inspire decisive
[45:02.960 --> 45:08.560]  action on climate change which means giant taxes to the rothschilds it looks as if he
[45:08.560 --> 45:14.800]  will give it a go in 2015 the pope will issue a lengthy message on the subject of the world's
[45:14.800 --> 45:19.840]  1.2 billion catholics and give an address to the un general assembly and call a summit of
[45:19.840 --> 45:29.280]  the world's main religions to call for the adoption of the un climate agenda and the article goes on
[45:29.280 --> 45:37.840]  in that just special in that just cutesy tootsie i want to take some calls just at the end of the
[45:37.840 --> 45:41.760]  sour a little bit of the next hour before our guest show i just from catholics specifically
[45:43.520 --> 45:49.760]  what do you think about this i mean this is a basically endorsing abortion because it will
[45:49.760 --> 45:55.040]  cause starvation by tens of millions a year conservatively this will shut down development
[45:55.040 --> 46:00.480]  worldwide it's implying development is bad and that what plants breathe is bad carbon dioxide
[46:00.480 --> 46:06.320]  that's at a very low level it's a giant global government total fraud v takeover plan by the
[46:06.320 --> 46:12.080]  green police it is a nightmare it is a nightmare death sentence to the third world
[46:15.440 --> 46:20.640]  we already see uh catholic churches calling for open borders and world government and gun
[46:20.640 --> 46:25.760]  controls so are the protestant ones i mean this is state run this is state run religion
[46:27.360 --> 46:33.280]  and it's frightening and it shows the world government agenda is showing its hand as
[46:33.280 --> 46:38.720]  left right the center they come out oh boy the pontiff was endorsed by mr abortion
[46:38.720 --> 46:47.200]  obama oh my goodness he's a rock star here's the toll free number to join us 800 259 92 31
[46:47.200 --> 46:51.360]  only it's only got a little bit of time when you're from catholics you think i'm wrong about this or
[46:52.240 --> 46:57.440]  i mean are you all now going to get rid of your car your television and your heat in the winter
[46:57.440 --> 47:03.840]  because most of it's from cold power i wonder if the pontiff is gonna go green oh they probably
[47:03.840 --> 47:12.160]  buy a few volt cars as a knickknack as a as a token i wonder what the carbon footprint is
[47:12.160 --> 47:18.480]  of vatican city that's exempt from taxation and one of the pay its power bill to italy just above
[47:18.480 --> 47:30.000]  the law doing everyone 800 259 92 31 before we go any further um you're supposed to take oxy

[49:11.280 --> 49:17.920]  let's go ahead and go to dr kelly in california what's your take on the pope uh endorsing the
[49:17.920 --> 49:24.000]  roth child world government carbon tax u n plan well i think they should go back to letting the
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.840]  pope ski and back in the day that he would be gone and the the ladies couldn't find him and he'd be
[49:29.840 --> 49:36.320]  out on the slopes getting some exercise and having a good old time and um it's oh come now
[49:36.320 --> 49:40.400]  popes have never had girlfriends throughout history even though it's on record hundreds of times
[49:41.520 --> 49:48.960]  and um it's interesting how the catholic school truly is the prisoner training with the uniforms
[49:48.960 --> 49:55.840]  and the segregation and all of the um you know all of the tyranny that they they promote there
[49:55.840 --> 50:00.400]  well look i mean i think it's a mixed bag one catholic church will be totally communist one
[50:00.400 --> 50:04.880]  will be conservative i mean i think it's diversified like any big organization but undoubtedly the
[50:04.880 --> 50:09.600]  catholic church has been behind the e you the catholic church is now behind gun control moves
[50:09.600 --> 50:15.600]  in the us and open borders endorsing it and housing the illegals it is a foreign government
[50:15.600 --> 50:22.720]  operating inside the united states uh now openly with the globalist agenda but the problem is is
[50:22.720 --> 50:28.320]  the protestant churches are like endorsing bill gates i mean look the catholic church has been
[50:28.320 --> 50:32.640]  one of the main fighters of abortion worldwide so that's a very positive you judge a tree by its
[50:32.640 --> 50:36.880]  fruits there are some positive fruits i think there's really signals notice the media is
[50:36.880 --> 50:41.680]  hailing this pope as the best guys that slice bread when they usually attack the other pups i
[50:41.680 --> 50:45.920]  mean i think you can say what you want about the catholic church i'm not here to cause division
[50:45.920 --> 50:50.160]  a lot of friends that are catholics great people there's big changes going on at the catholic
[50:50.160 --> 50:56.400]  church and everywhere else right now and they ain't good gun control open borders and carbon taxes

[53:15.280 --> 53:20.080]  through an asthmatic breathing type situation my breathing is shallow and generally constricted
[53:20.080 --> 53:25.520]  in the nose and lungs after consuming one world away today i have tremendous energy and also notice
[53:25.520 --> 53:31.520]  my breathing is free i can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen
[53:31.520 --> 53:35.920]  which is pretty remarkable because i rarely get that feeling being a singer i love feeling
[53:35.920 --> 53:40.960]  that's unrestricted voice the only thing no i've actually added to my routine is one world away

[53:51.840 --> 54:01.840]  whey.com
[54:06.640 --> 54:11.840]  this is not america
[54:11.840 --> 54:22.640]  there is no doubt that whether it's the british royal combine the dutch royal
[54:22.640 --> 54:28.080]  combine the vatican city operation israel the united states the pentagon
[54:29.600 --> 54:36.400]  nato they're all working in conjunction to establish a planetary government under which
[54:36.400 --> 54:42.320]  human life is completely devalued the family is broken up and hell on earth is deployed
[54:43.600 --> 54:47.840]  now the vatican on average has been pretty pro-life and pro-family and i said that's
[54:47.840 --> 54:52.320]  something positive and you've seen globalist attempts to take it over and turn it into whatever
[54:52.320 --> 54:56.720]  they wanted you could debate what the vatican was before but there's been an attempt to take it over
[54:57.840 --> 55:02.800]  it appears that's now been done even though the catholic church at some of the local levels is
[55:02.800 --> 55:07.760]  endorsing abortion but not at the international level castedly by supporting this un carbon
[55:07.760 --> 55:14.640]  tax agenda that's what's happening and it's got to be addressed and dealt with just like i get
[55:14.640 --> 55:19.440]  disgusted and read out the big protestant churches that are involved in open borders and gun control
[55:20.400 --> 55:21.920]  i mean you know religion
[55:25.280 --> 55:30.160]  when it becomes state run or state merged is very very dangerous it's why we have a first
[55:30.160 --> 55:35.360]  amendment in this country saying congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
[55:35.360 --> 55:41.280]  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof but then what do you do when foreign based
[55:42.080 --> 55:48.960]  governmental churches so powerful and so old it's a government of itself says your borders will
[55:48.960 --> 55:54.880]  be open we'll bring people in and legalize them we will push carbon taxes we will go to the un
[55:54.880 --> 55:59.440]  and try to enforce it over you it's over the top
[56:01.840 --> 56:08.560]  Keith in indiana you're on the air go ahead yeah i i just wanted to mention the idea that i'm
[56:08.560 --> 56:12.640]  roman catholic and i've had a lot of discussions with people about the pope and a lot of people
[56:12.640 --> 56:19.440]  think that his function is to introduce these subjects to the congregation that even if they
[56:19.440 --> 56:25.440]  don't go through he's like this guy who's going to lay the foundation for the next pope he's already
[56:25.440 --> 56:32.320]  80 years old but he can bring up all these subjects and put them out there and say we need to do this
[56:32.320 --> 56:37.680]  we and then you you have it given to you and you can sit on it for a while some politicians do the
[56:37.680 --> 56:44.160]  same thing they prepare the public for what's coming and a lot of people think that's what his job
[56:44.160 --> 56:48.000]  is is to pair well look i have nothing against catholics everybody knows that i don't try to
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.560]  get into this but he's making it political and look the last pope had to step down under scandal
[56:52.560 --> 56:58.400]  guaranteed the catholic church is being blackmailed so either do you agree with that or disagree with
[56:58.400 --> 57:03.280]  that and then what do you do about something like that i completely agree with you and i think
[57:04.240 --> 57:07.840]  they are being blackmailed and one of the reasons is that they're being blackmailed
[57:07.840 --> 57:12.720]  through the international banking system they've got all kinds of terrible banking problems
[57:12.720 --> 57:16.480]  through and he was from south america and a lot of them came out of that section because they were
[57:16.480 --> 57:22.240]  running apparently laundering drug money through the vatican bank people have said but anyway you're
[57:22.240 --> 57:27.440]  right they bring blackmail and what you do about it is the only answer you have is is you have to
[57:27.440 --> 57:33.440]  attempt to do a grassroots move just like you talk about all the time it's the individual people in
[57:33.440 --> 57:38.400]  their parishes who have to think they have some say in what happened but if they wash their hands
[57:38.400 --> 57:42.880]  of it like a Pontius pilot move and don't do anything then the top will just get to do what
[57:42.880 --> 57:47.840]  they want and they'll just go along and and i think i don't really know how else they're gonna
[57:47.840 --> 57:53.280]  do it the problem is there's so few priests a lot of the people don't have anybody to talk to anymore
[57:53.280 --> 57:58.240]  well if you go back on record 70 80 years ago with the world council of churches and others
[57:58.240 --> 58:02.880]  the Rockefellers publicly bragged that not just the Catholics but the other seminaries
[58:02.880 --> 58:07.040]  they were infiltrating with communists and socialists that's what Margaret Sanger said they would do
[58:07.040 --> 58:13.520]  to take it over and so you've got a bunch of people that aren't even Christians uh there as
[58:13.520 --> 58:19.680]  ministers as priests you name it and i mean that's come out that's that's on record so we have to
[58:19.680 --> 58:26.240]  recognize that that's a big part of this as well so that's South American tradition of the Marxist
[58:26.240 --> 58:31.840]  things of the the continent that opposes it more than any others Africa not America it's the African
[58:31.840 --> 58:35.040]  priests who are the most conservative that's true and they're the ones that expose the
[58:35.040 --> 58:39.360]  UN agenda you're absolutely right because they're facing the brunt of it they're under they know

[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.640]  right now we're talking to catholics i asked for catholics to call in and give me your take
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:46.240]  on pope frances coming out and saying we gotta do something about climate change
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.280]  i mean it's been a proven fraud
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:59.280]  it's global government and the it's just outrageous now the catholic church from my
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.520]  research and i'm not catholic but i've done lay research is very diverse around the world as
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:08.480]  the last caller mentioned the african leadership of the catholic church is very conservative exposes
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.480]  the u.n the whole world government genica's they've been under it central south america the
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:18.160]  communists basically took it over and that's where old pope frances comes from and i mean my
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:23.760]  goodness you know you tell uh tree bites fruits might as well make him the head of the u.n or
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:29.200]  something in my view but uh what do you do about something like this ron in canada what's your take
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:36.320]  on this how you doing alex good brother dad i just want to say one thing uh about catholics uh have
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:40.320]  you ever heard of something called the know nothing's i want to say what the art of your
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:45.920]  listeners uh the know nothing's where an anti-catholic political group in the united states in the 1840s
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:51.680]  and 1850s who claimed that the irish and roman catholic immigrants to the united states would be
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:58.080]  controlled by the pope for anti-american purposes okay so i'm not surprised that this is going on
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:05.840]  what do you guys say on that well i mean the catholic church was neutral to a great
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:12.720]  extent but also joined in some of the revolutionary war stuff to get out from under britain so if you
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:18.320]  study the history of it i really didn't see the catholic church trying to stop the formation of
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:23.280]  the republic if anything it was on the side of setting it up though there was something that big
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:31.680]  there was multiple things going on but yeah the u.n uh the imf world bank all these organizations
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:38.320]  uh the big fortune 100 in the catholic church as a whole are pushing open borders now that will
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:46.320]  in the country uh as we know it uh so that's where i stand on this i mean i am against carbon taxes
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.960]  it is a eugenics death sentence and i want to get lord moncton on to speak about this
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:57.680]  we ever heard of um something by something called the gray wolves a valvarian secret service
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:05.920]  i've heard that term before refresh my memory uh pope john paul the second 1981 attempt at
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:12.400]  assassination various theories have been brought forward in regards to the attempt by uh men met
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:18.240]  ali agra to kill pope john paul the second oh yes i was aware of that well look i mean isn't that
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:22.800]  see that's something good the catholic church did trying to bring down the soviet union that's
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:26.880]  what i mean it's i just don't think it's one monolithic thing it's like any big institution
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.960]  but this is a really bad turn in my view what who do you think was really behind
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:36.800]  uh the attempt of killing a pope john paul the second i think the cia i honestly think
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:42.640]  i think the cia is involved in almost every assassination and there has ever been including
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:49.040]  president cary i i want to get your take on on the catholic and hitler what what how were the
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:58.960]  caskets involved in the the nazi movement well the fascists took over italy and so at that point
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:04.640]  the catholic church didn't have a lot they could do either way some of the catholics were for the
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:12.880]  nazi some were against some got persecuted some weren't uh but um my memory this is a complex
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.800]  issue i think it was pope pious wasn't it who was in there at the time went along with it
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:22.320]  or i guess get politically taken out you can slice either way then the the vatican was used
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.200]  to help get some of the nazis out via the rat line operation paperclip that they also used
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:32.240]  british intelligence and others so that's what i mean it just seems like uh it's all part of
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:38.960]  one big operation so there you've got my historical take on that and this from someone that the
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:46.400]  catholic bashers claim is a secret jesuit assassin priest i just try to cover the real
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.240]  history without getting a bunch of infighting going on i want to promote the basic ideas of
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:55.360]  liberty and i think uh in many people's hearts regardless of what your religion is that that
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:04.720]  that desire is there when you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:11.840]  but if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets there's a place

[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.960]  within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states well over a thousand
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:27.440]  types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:32.160]  million americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics

[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.600]  to break down the anatomy of how they try to assassinate your character and why they're
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:06.080]  firing at her so much with some of the great success that she's been having mobilizing
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:14.480]  uh the grass roots and what she's done is a template uh really of success uh also coming
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:23.360]  up the next hour this is so incredible when i woke up this morning and i saw this headline
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:32.400]  michael savage changing radio show format to become a life coach
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:42.240]  now michael savage i would say is one third political hardcore conservative firebrand one
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:48.160]  third doctor of botany believe me he knows his stuff i've done a lot of research into it and
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:53.200]  i listened to him he knows what he's talking about and then one third life coach and storyteller
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:59.840]  he's one of the only syndicated hosts i can listen to and he's not a complete ego maniac either he
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:05.280]  other hosts are such ego maniacs on average limbaugh isn't he has guest hosts but other than limbaugh
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:11.280]  and and savage ego mania does not even begin to touch it i mean some of the national talk show
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:16.800]  host i know other people know actually think they're christ people could probably imagine
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.920]  who i'm talking about but i'm not going to go there there's nothing worse than being around
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:30.640]  some of the things they're god but what's amazing is i had privately told my family
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:31.280]  and crew
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:40.640]  and everyone that we needed to start having more of the show be about self-help and life coaching
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:46.880]  and how to skin a buck how to run a trot line how to be personable how to start a business
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:53.280]  uh track new startup businesses that can be successful because my family and myself personally
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:59.040]  i mean i did business before i did radio and tv when i was like 16 to 20 and everything i did was
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:09.200]  successful didn't matter if it was sales or oil painting or uh marketing or working on a golf course
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.720]  for one summer i'd already been promoted being there two weeks because i'd work was already
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:19.120]  being paid basically double little secrets to life like don't say no problem when someone says thank
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:26.640]  you say my pleasure little things like that because that's how we're going to defeat the new world
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:32.160]  order is by making the individual successful and letting the individual know how the world really
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:36.800]  works i mean i've said this many times that knowing how the world really works doesn't just make you
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:42.960]  informed it makes you wealthy compared to people around you the globalists obsess over this there's
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:48.960]  a reason the syrian and japanese and german and dutch and british government and russian government
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:54.960]  listen to this broadcast it's come out in the news they listen i've had the former head of the
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:03.200]  german cia on andres von bulow who thanked me for helping him wake up to 9 11 and researching it
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:11.600]  wrote his book i'm not bragging i'm saying figuring out how the world really works the

[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:32.160]  flight disappeared we'll cover that at the bottom of the hour we're going to keep our guests for
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:36.880]  the rest of the hour but i'll hit news the bottom of the hour la pd police in florida you name it
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.960]  are all getting shot at nambush this it's it's it's on the crest of a race slash cop war starting
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.960]  all run by the justice department by the way the justice department got caught funding one of these
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:55.360]  organizations but when i say great minds think alike michael savages making the right move
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:00.640]  to shift a lot of the format into life coaching because people i was thinking about this in the
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:06.960]  shower this morning and we're going to our guest we now know there's a global government back when
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:11.040]  we were trying to prove there's a global government the corporate takeover crony capitalist
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.840]  anti-free market plan back when we were trying to prove gmo was killing lab animals back when we
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:20.160]  were trying to prove aspartame would make you go blind back we were trying to prove autism was
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:24.720]  increasing in linked vaccines back we were trying to prove the fellow reserve was run for profit and
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:33.360]  private ron paul couldn't get one cosponsor 18 years ago 20 years ago now it's past the house
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:37.680]  twice set to pass the senate to audit it and basically start abolishing it
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:46.800]  this show and i've told my crew this is passe unless we really start educating people about
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:52.000]  the minutiae of history also the big ideas getting people to think outside the new order box about
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.280]  how beautiful and big the universe is and how beautiful humanity is and how much potential we have
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.680]  and then also discredit and attack the globalist but we've got to the point now
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:09.200]  you know where most people go yeah man i know you're right what do we do about it and more than
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:14.080]  ever if people learn to help themselves they'll then learn to fight tyranny but you first got
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:20.240]  to have some success in your own life and so i intend to shift the format of this show 20 30
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:28.080]  percent more into bona fide self-help reports factoids kind of an encyclopedia of videos and
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:32.560]  articles on every subject i want to go to the next level and by the grace of god i hope i have the
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:36.320]  energy and i hope i have the crew to do it and i think i do so thank you all for your prayers

[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.680]  the successes you've had and then what's coming in the future but you can really feel the wave
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:44.640]  that you and others are writing that this show is writing with our health news people are really
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:51.360]  waking up they're pulling the fructose corn syrup out of most things the candy you name it the catch
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:55.840]  up i mean everywhere i turn the best for you always getting taken out there is such a huge
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:00.640]  awakening happening and you're right there at the tip of the spear so we salute you thank you so much
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:05.520]  for having me on here alex i really appreciate it i'm really excited to be back here because you
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:12.560]  know uh as you know you know when i launched certain petitions you you fielded my uh research
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:18.240]  first and i know that had a huge impact in getting these companies to change and so you know one of
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:23.040]  the things that's been happening as of late is you know and this is something that i didn't realize
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:29.200]  because you know i didn't set out to be an activist it was really an accident that it happened and it
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:35.920]  was my own um weight issues it was my own health issues and just feeling really terrible about
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:42.000]  myself that eventually allowed me to have this wake-up call this light bulb moment to take control
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.520]  of my health and say no to what the food industry was telling me and the professionals were telling
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:54.240]  me and use some basic common sense and that's the message behind all of the activism that i've been
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:00.240]  a part of which is we need to have transparency about what we're eating and we need the food
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:05.360]  chemicals and the food additives that the food industry is using to make us addictive and to
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:12.560]  make food taste better than it should and to make the food industry's pockets richer out of our food
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:17.600]  because what that is doing is is providing no nutritional benefit to the consumer and it's
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:24.560]  only providing benefit to the food industry and what we see the alarming rates of obesity and
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:30.560]  cancer and heart disease and diabetes there's something that needs to be done and right now
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:36.960]  the food industry has gone completely unregulated i mean they have self-regulation when it comes to
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:41.920]  approving these additives at the FDA level which are really drugs which is their big secret that
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:47.200]  makes them addictive your your camera switch from external mic to internal i'm going to give you
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:51.680]  a moment to try to switch to external or because you're you're got really bad reverb and i want
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.800]  folks to be able to hear what you have to say spend about a minute working on that we're going to
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:00.000]  come back to you let me read to you some of the successes she's had with campaigns she started
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:07.600]  with a website and her activism with facebook and other platforms just a couple years ago and she's
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:12.080]  also thanked this broadcast you the listeners to serve a big part of that credit she's launched a bunch
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:18.960]  these campaigns on this show so i'm very proud of our listeners cheerios removing gmo sugar from

[01:22:53.280 --> 01:23:01.600]  preservatives uh starting basically now next year anhyzer bush and miller brewing as well as
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:07.360]  curves announced that they will publish ingredients for the first time and did in june of 2014 and we
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:11.760]  helped her launch that very proud of our listeners there you did it starbucks told the press that
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:16.640]  they are working on removing class four caramel coloring from their drinks and considering
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:22.400]  listing ingredients on their website they've now done that white wave who owns silk horizon
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:30.000]  announced plans to remove all of these different types of chemicals from their products gmo labeling
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:35.680]  initiative in oregon lost only by 837 votes wall street journal reported that more meat
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:41.360]  manufacturers are dumping antibiotics powerful entities have a financial incentive to try to
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:47.200]  discredit me this is her writing in the work that the food babe army is doing to secure a healthy
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:54.960]  unpolluted food supply uh vance crow the director of uh millennials at monsanto says he is quote paid
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:02.720]  to stop fear and called vani harry a snake oil salesman massive monsanto advertising campaign
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:08.880]  in oprah magazine food network etc to counter her companies have spent over 105 million dollars
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:14.800]  to fight gmo labeling i mean if they're so great just let us know and then it just goes on if they
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:20.240]  are spending this much money to hire our right to know if they are eating gmo's then why wouldn't
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:26.400]  they spend some more money to hire people to discredit me and others in this movement and
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:31.840]  we're having so many other factories please continue uh breaking this down food babe hey thank
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:36.960]  you so much you know what's really interesting is that the media has tried to spin this to make
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:42.000]  it a story about me and not a story about the food industry they want to take the focus off
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.560]  what the food industry has been doing and getting away with and make the story about me they want
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:52.400]  to call me a fearmonger you know what's more scary not knowing what we're eating or continuing
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:57.760]  allowing these food chemists these food companies and these giant chemical companies continue to
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:02.960]  pollute our food right under our noses without us having the right to know you know what's more
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:07.920]  scary and who do you trust do you trust the food industry that wants you to buy their products do
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:14.240]  you trust the food chemists that develop these additives are you trusting the director of millennials
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:24.720]  vance crow at monsanto for messaging i mean he has literally stated verbatim on twitter that he is
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:34.240]  paid to take down snake oil salesmen like myself he calls me a snake oil salesman i mean that someone
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:42.160]  who is promoting organic non-gmo food food without these additives food that other countries have
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:48.320]  safeguarded their citizens for food that these same companies have taken out these additives
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:55.200]  for other people in other countries and going after me and going after this message and when
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:01.280]  they come after me when they say that looking at food ingredients is fearmongering or that knowing
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:06.320]  about what's in your food is taking it too far it leads to a eating disorder what they're doing is
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:11.760]  they're trying to discredit the entire real food movement and right now people are fed up
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:16.960]  they want these additives out of their food they want more access to real food and they want access
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:23.440]  to healthier food and they don't want to be conned by what's on the label i mean just look at subway
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:28.800]  subway for years was telling you to eat fresh by eating at their stores meanwhile they're putting
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:37.440]  plasticizers in their bread we need to really rise up together and we need to hold these food
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:43.520]  companies accountable and that's what i've made my mission to do and it's because of the health
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:50.320]  issues that i turned around i mean i went from six to eight prescription drugs to zero when i started
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:56.480]  looking at the ingredients in my food and moving towards an organic non-gmo real food diet and in
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:02.160]  my book the food babe way which you guys have an advanced copy but this book is going to give people
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:08.160]  the plan the tactics the habits everything they need to know in order to navigate this
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:14.000]  over processed world we live in where the food industry is making the conversation out there
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.960]  they're the ones deciding what to put on food network during the commercial break i mean the
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:26.560]  fact that monsanto has had to go on this massive pr campaign putting ads in opera magazine putting
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:32.320]  ads on the radio and i want to endure a station i mean it's everywhere and the fact that they've
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:39.520]  had to hire people to physically and literally go after activists like myself and bun and ashiva
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:47.920]  and so many others proves that they are losing this debate they are losing this game the consumers
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:53.920]  want access to real food that isn't tainted with their chemicals and we're going to rise up because
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:28:00.400]  together i know we're going to be able to change the industry um one of the things that's in this
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:06.320]  book the food babe way is dr mark hyman actually wrote the forward and something that he says in
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:13.840]  the forward is just it gives me chills every time i read it and that's if everybody were to follow
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:19.120]  the habits in the food babe way the food industry as we know it today would crumble
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:26.400]  and a new innovation and new creativity would take root and that's what i'm looking for is a
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:33.440]  system that we can all be part of and we can eat because we don't have a choice not to eat food
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:41.520]  and we can be healthy as a nation together and reverse the the the rise of disease
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:48.480]  i'll continue we're about to go to break but i mean i want to talk more about the big successes
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:54.400]  you've had when we come back but uh continue yeah you know what's really interesting is what they're
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:29:02.080]  doing is they're taking a play right out of the tobacco playbook back in the 1970s they said that
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:07.680]  the consumer advocates the ones that were speaking out against secondhand smoke were causing
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:14.480]  smoke phobia and cancer phobia and these were the same scientists that work for harvard medical
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:21.280]  school that went on record in front of congress and said you know what we don't have the scientific
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:28.160]  data that shows that secondhand smoking causes cancer but we all know how that ended and what
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:33.360]  i'm saying here is that the media needs to look at the scientists that are looking at the food
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:38.720]  additives from an independent perspective not the people who belong to the ift that are funded by
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:44.320]  monsanto and craft and coca-cola well how dare you speak out food babe you're terrible we'll have

[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:39.440]  the hood babe food babe dot com honey harry is our guest the reason we've got her on is she's
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:45.920]  a blueprint for success just as info wars is a blueprint for success or drugs report dot com's
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:51.840]  a blueprint for success for alternative outside the system ideas doesn't mean we all agree with
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:56.640]  each other on every issue or go back to her in a moment i'm gonna hit a few news stories that i
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:04.640]  mentioned uh first but just think about it we've gone from 20 years ago you couldn't find organic
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:10.480]  food basically anywhere in this country that hadn't had deadly pesticides used on it or wasn't gmo to
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:19.200]  some extent now it is displacing all of the garbage hind's ketchup a couple years ago got
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:26.160]  rid of fructose corn syrup and went to sugar non-gmo sugar i know coke and pepsi have been
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:30.320]  talking about going back to sugar which tastes great anyways you've read a mexican coke it's
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:34.720]  like an old-fashioned coke when you were a kid i quit liking cokes when they went to high fructose
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:40.560]  corn syrup fries your pancreas a bunch of other stuff the diet drinks it's now mainstream news
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:47.280]  mainstream studies cause diabetes and cause you to get fat they just fry your body aspartame
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:52.560]  i could go on for hours about all the big victories but everywhere you go you see it
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:59.360]  with the bisphenol a being taken out of the plastics to on and on and on mainly because
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:06.000]  women in this country got informed and women listen to other women like the food babe and
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:12.880]  her info is just mainline research mainline studies mainline common sense hey shouldn't
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:20.320]  you be able to label something that it's gmo and we're not talking about gmo where you cross two
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:27.920]  pumpkins that's hybridization that's how they confuse people the old fake conservative line
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:33.680]  where they got conservatives the last few decades to get on board for gmo is george washington carver
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:40.880]  crossed plants yeah he crossed different types of corn or different types of soybeans to make
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:49.040]  an edible soybean crossing plants is natural sticking insect genes in them or fish genes in them
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:55.120]  or human genes in them or having corn grow hiv virus look that up pharmacological
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:03.440]  and thousands and thousands of other glowing i remember 15 years ago bbc reported in Hong
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:11.680]  kong you could buy glowing monkeys glowing cats and glowing puppies for like a thousand dollars look
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:19.200]  it up type in glowing cats glowing monkeys for sale you can now buy them in the us and i know
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:26.480]  people that know folks who have them rich people have glow in the dark monkeys and cats in america
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:39.600]  that are part jellyfish i'm not kidding it's on screen just type glowing monkey in glowing mice
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:47.440]  glowing cats type in by glowing pets by glowing monkeys type glowing monkeys for sale it's
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:55.440]  in hong kong you may even get the 15 year old article the point is we're in buck rogers land
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:59.920]  this isn't george washington carver who was a master at hybridization
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:07.120]  which helped us and did a lot of great yields they go oh people don't want to have rice that
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:14.240]  can grow in less water you know they're racist or people don't want to know this could feed the
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:20.720]  world but you don't want bill gates involved in it and you certainly want it labeled bt corn has
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:26.960]  about a thousand times higher naturally occurring toxin in it than it naturally occurs yes it's
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:32.400]  a natural toxin that keeps bugs from eating it because it tastes bad it kills bugs that eat it
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:37.840]  in the natural world it does it just makes them sick and they don't like it i remember talking
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:44.240]  to farmers 20 years ago who talked about their hogs wouldn't eat gmo corn and if they got them
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:49.920]  to eat it they would die now that's in the news that it's linked to pigs dying and and being
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:55.200]  infertile do you understand that the when they can afford them they don't use lab rats that were
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:01.600]  closely associated with they use pigs pigs are the most closely associated animal to homo sapien
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:09.280]  sapien when drug testing you can take a pig heart folks over a baboon heart they work better pigs
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:14.080]  die when they eat it now i'm ranting i said i'd go to our guests i'ma shut up and give her the floor
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:19.920]  or let me uh get into this headline half of children will be autistic by 2025 warrants senior
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:26.160]  research scientists and mit natural health usa info wars dot com i mean this is big folks
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:33.040]  i wish the pope would come out against gmo but oh no no no the bible says don't mix the seed
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:41.600]  the pope won't talk about that though air asia's ceo dump shares days before flight disappeared
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:48.000]  moob prompt speculation tony fernandez had prior knowledge info wars dot com asia air ceo

[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:55.600]  tying it into that info wars dot com prison planet dot com coming up after our guest leaves us
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:02.640]  media companies and executives on the hot seat in 2015 and that ties into reality tv facing its own
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:09.120]  reality a rating slump we're nearing the media singularity i'll talk about it a term i've coined
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:14.560]  in the next hour right now back to the food babe food babe thanks for holding uh there and we got
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:20.160]  your audio dialed up and tuned in now so again thank you for spending time with us in the twilight
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:26.080]  of 2014 i want you to get into more successes but first off what's big on the radar screen
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.720]  we know the empire is striking back they're approving all these new gmo potatoes you name it
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:37.600]  uh what should we be most focused on right now and what are you planning to target next well you
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:43.280]  know alex i won't be able to tell you my target today but i'll tell you exactly what we need to
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:50.320]  focus on as a nation is we need to focus on number one transparency when a company won't
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:55.760]  give you the list of ingredients in their food you should automatically know that you
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:01.680]  shouldn't be eating that food and that goes for big companies i'm talking companies like starbucks
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:10.320]  who before i a blog post that i wrote in regards to the pumpkin spice latte went viral before my
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:18.240]  investigation on them that came out in 2012 they were basically getting away with saying that they
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:22.880]  were a pretty healthy company that they were removing high fruit toast corn syrup or removing
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:28.560]  artificial ingredients for their food but for their main bread and butter their drinks the coffee
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:35.040]  drinks the frappuccinos the the the lattes all of those things they have never once put the
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:42.240]  ingredient list online for those items like their competitors do like dunk and donuts does and so for
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:48.000]  this long and up until this point where they finally committed to do this after you know huge
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:54.960]  wave of media attack them for for not being transparent they basically told the public you
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:42:00.720]  know what drink our coffee because it's the best and we're not going to tell you what's in it and
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:05.600]  that's a type of scenario that i say the american public should fight back and they should also say
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:10.640]  you know what i'm not going to support companies that don't tell us what's in their food the same
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:18.640]  goes for papa john's papa john's is a huge giant manufacturer of food has one of the most popular
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:25.040]  piece of chains in the united states even their their labeling on their marketing says better
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:30.720]  ingredients better pizza well how do we know if it's better ingredients if they don't label
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:34.640]  their ingredients that they're selling to the american public if you look at dominoes you
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:39.840]  look at pizza hut you look at any of their competitors they post their ingredients online
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:45.280]  for the american public to view and see and find out what they're eating but papa john's does not
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:50.960]  so that's another company that's getting away with not being transparent that i think needs to change
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:59.280]  an entire industry for as long as they've been in existence has gotten away with not putting
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:03.760]  the ingredients on the label and that's and what i'm talking about here is actually chapter number
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:08.720]  seven in my book the food babe way i'm actually giving out this chapter early if you want to read
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:14.320]  it if you pre-order the book and you send me your receipt at bonus at food babe.com i'll send you
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:19.840]  this chapter so you can read it before new year's eve but it's all about how the alcohol industry
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:28.240]  has gotten away with not putting the ingredients on beer on liquor and on wine and i investigate
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:33.280]  these companies in this chapter and i show you what's actually in the most popular beers now
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:38.080]  that we know some of the ingredients because of anheuser bush's commitment to start listing them
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:45.600]  but i start asking other brands and then also the same brands of wine you know what is this gmo yeast
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:52.880]  that wine companies have developed to produce the wine cheaper and faster you know i expose those
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:57.840]  companies in this chapter as well as the liquor companies that are adding artificial flavors
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:03.840]  artificial coloring and you know one thing is clear you know alex you know that alcohol is a
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:09.760]  class one carcinogen it's not a healthy thing for your liver you're not going to be a healthy
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:16.560]  person by drinking all the time but the american public has the right to know what they're drinking
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:22.080]  and also as a healthy individual like myself or my husband or anybody else who tries to live
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:29.280]  as as three from these additives as possible we want to know what's in our alcohol and one thing
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:36.480]  that really drives me crazy is that these scientists and other skeptics that are speaking out against
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:42.640]  this transparency want to continue having this information hidden from the public but they also
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:48.000]  want us to make us feel stupid for asking they're like if alcohol is bad for you why do you care
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:54.400]  that all these other additives are added well tell you why you should care because the food industry
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:45:00.640]  along with the tobacco industry and the alcohol industry are working together and spending billions
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:06.960]  of dollars trying to figure out how to make you addicted to certain flavors and taste and if they're
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:12.960]  adding that already into alcohol which is addictive in nature by itself you have the right to know as
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:22.160]  an individual there's papers leaked papers from 2006 and earlier in the 80s up until 2001 where it
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:28.240]  showed that Kraft and Philip Morris who were owned by the same company back in the day they
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:33.760]  no longer are but they were owned by the same company were working together to figure out how
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:38.880]  the brain works on how to create that addictive taste you're telling me the alcohol industry
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:44.960]  hasn't also used that research yeah they have and let's expand on that i mean we know where
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:49.760]  colonel sanders secret ingredient came from this is on record it's a mainstream news for
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:58.240]  folks want to look it up the japanese military in after world war one couldn't get japanese soldiers
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:03.440]  to eat the horrible basically rotten horse meat because the japanese were into quality
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:07.040]  they would follow orders they just wouldn't eat and starve they wouldn't even complain they just
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:15.200]  wouldn't eat so they started putting msg just total brain damage total cell death uh excited
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:19.840]  doctors have had brain surgeons scientists there's all these studies that we have the last 20 years
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:25.760]  all they knew was it made troops eat it you could feed them garbage so they took that
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:31.760]  kentucky fried chicken used that uh so many old people i know that have Alzheimer's if you can get
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:37.120]  them off of msg to stop eating doritos and stuff suddenly their minds come back quite a bit it's
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:43.040]  chronic uh inflammation in the brain that's what vaccines do to kids but notice how the left
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:50.640]  left wants to push carbon taxes on carbon dioxide to tax it worldwide while ignoring gmo and things
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:56.160]  that are on record bad that shows how the fake environmentalism in my view covers up all the
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:03.120]  real stuff that shouldn't be about left or right i should know that something has bt corn that has
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:09.600]  a pesticide in it that kills the bugs that eat it i mean that's a no brainer that i should know
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:15.600]  that this phenol a is an estrogen mimiker and totally will screw up a man or a woman i mean i
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:20.400]  don't want to go on estrogen sorry i'm not you know trying to become a transvestite or a tranny
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:24.320]  and if somebody wants to do that that's great they can go become that i'm not even attacking
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:29.200]  you know transsexuals or whatever the point is i don't want to be one i want to be a man and so
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:34.720]  this is social engineering and you're right they've known for a hundred years through the eugenics
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:41.520]  movement and barter and russell wrote about this in two books he said diet uh diet injections and
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:47.680]  injunctions diet injections and injunctions the courts so diet vaccines and the courts
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:55.520]  will make rebellion against the superclass and the controlling class uh as hard as
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:03.600]  sheep revolting against the practice of eating mutton so sheep revolting against the practice
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:09.520]  of humans eating sheep they said we're rendering you down into basically animals how else could
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:15.040]  ten years ago we learned that mcdonald's and others were putting a plastic emulsifier in the
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:22.400]  nuggets i mean it's amazing that they've gotten away with this go ahead i'm ranting well you know
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:31.600]  one of the things that you know is so crazy about this is that um msg you know it it does
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:36.560]  affect the brain according to the research done by russell blalock and by the way you know i've
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:42.480]  got a list of 10 pages of different scientists and chemists that are actually studying food
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:48.080]  additives and obscene risks and some of these um scientists are all over the globe some of them are
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:52.320]  here in the united states and i wish the media would actually contact me for this list and start
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:57.680]  interviewing these people instead of the skeptic scientists that you know make it their job to speak
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:02.560]  out against anyone who's trying to protect the public and look for a different solution than the
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:10.240]  pharmaceuticals in the in the screwed up system that we live in but if you look at msg what the
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:15.920]  thing that an average person like myself can really benefit from and you look at msg and there's like
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:23.600]  in in my book there's a page where i list all of the different hidden names of msg if you avoid
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:28.960]  these chemicals in food which they're in the majority of the processed foods on on conventional
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:33.840]  supermarket shelves and even in whole foods they have some of these hidden ingredients
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:40.640]  if you avoid them you're going to start taking back your taste buds you're going to start taking
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:46.240]  back control of any addictive behavior you have towards food and if you want to lose weight if
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:51.440]  you want to start feeling better start eliminating this additive because i tell you you're going to
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:58.800]  stop having your mouth water when you drive past McDonald's or Chick-fil-A or Wendy's or a Burger King

[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:24.400]  i'm telling people i'm just going to break but i'm in a great example is Pepsi using fetal tissue

[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:08.880]  all right food babe is our guest food babe dot com and really all i'm trying to say today and i
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:15.600]  get really excited when she's on is we can have success we can make a better world we can inform
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:21.760]  others but you're not going to find mainstream dinosaur media that's full of drug ads and
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:28.880]  gmo food ads and mcdonald's ads telling you that and i was never a huge fast food person
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:34.000]  but i i ate it a few days a week for lunch and i remember i'd always get a headache and feel
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.400]  bad after i ate it and even nicer restaurants sometimes i can eat something and tell it had
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:44.720]  preservatives because i'll feel bad and over time you can taste something and tell it has
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:49.920]  preservatives and i just won't eat it because i don't want the headache i don't want the zits
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:57.200]  i don't want the weight gain and you think about the school lunch program cut back to calories as
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:02.720]  if it's calories that are bad but was full of gmo and aspartame and i mean i don't mean to get the
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:08.560]  food babe off on a rant about that but uh it's just crazy since when does the federal government
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:13.440]  tell our kids what to eat in school and tell parents they can't pack them lunches
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:19.920]  but then when the feds make you eat what they want you to eat it's it's gmo it's just crazy i mean
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:25.600]  we know michelle obama eats organic and has that garden in the white house why would they do something
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:31.680]  like that food babe well i i want to read you this quote and this is really telling to how
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:37.920]  screwed up our food system is today and the fda this is from the deputy commissioner of the fda
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:44.800]  michael taylor to the washington post last summer okay this is just this past summer in 2014 we do
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:50.720]  not know the volume of particular chemicals that are going into the food supply so we can
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:56:00.160]  diagnose trends we do not know what is going in post market basically there is no information
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:07.120]  that the fda can even provide reporters or the media or anyone about the amount of chemicals the
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:14.720]  american public is consuming and on top of that nobody is studying the cumulative effect of all
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:20.160]  these chemicals together the chemicals that you eat in your egg McMuffin at breakfast and then the
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:25.520]  food chemicals that you eat at lunch when you go out to panara bread or you go out subway and the
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:30.960]  food chemicals that are in the processed foods that you bring home to to feed your family at night
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:37.840]  nobody's testing the cumulative effect of all these chemicals in our body at once and what i'm
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:44.640]  asking for everyone to consider is to start using just some basic common sense you don't have to be a
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:50.400]  scientist you don't have to be a doctor you don't have to be a nutritionist actually you can become
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:56.560]  your own nutritionist with my book because i'm going to teach you how to be an expert label
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:02.800]  ingredient reader and i'm also going to teach you what those ingredients mean and i'm going to show
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:08.000]  you how to avoid them and i'm going to show you the habits the actual habits that i taught myself
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:14.320]  on how to live in this over processed world while still enjoying life while still eating the things
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:19.040]  that i love to eat and still having sweets and still having alcohol every once in a while and
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:26.240]  having these different things but instead take back my my taste buds and take back my body
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:31.120]  from this industry that has decided to pollute it and by the way in my experience when folks
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:36.000]  who are really addicted to fast food go off of it you will go through withdrawals and get sick
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:44.160]  i mean this is no joke and and and i designed this book it's a 21 day plan so each day you're
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:49.760]  going to develop one new habit so it's going to take you gradually through eventually breaking
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:55.120]  your grip from the food industry breaking free from the toxins in your food you're going to lose
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:58:02.000]  weight you're going to feel younger i'm telling you i feel younger now which is crazy to think about
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:08.800]  than i did 15 years ago that doesn't make any sense to me i'm 15 years older and i feel better now

[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:48.160]  we can take back from the social engineers now we've had a lot of callers like nick who's listening
[02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:57.600]  on 1340 am in california and bill listening on shortwave and patty listening on ipad and
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:06.800]  lino listening on info war streams and tim and others we're going to get to all of you i know
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:11.840]  it's about what i brought up in the first hour then we're going to segue into other subjects
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:16.320]  and other news but folks are welcome to call in everybody knows i don't bash muslims for
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:21.920]  being muslims i don't bash catholics for being catholics prosdents for being protestants i don't
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:27.520]  bash jews for being jews germans for being germans mexicans for being mexicans i bashed
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:34.320]  though individuals when they're clearly want my guns say my kids belong to them are promoting
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:42.800]  abortion are promoting gmo are promoting scams like carbon taxes if you do any or you randomly
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:48.720]  want to just kill somebody like you just randomly want to kill police for no reason i'm against
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:55.040]  that or you want to randomly kill black people say or white people i i'm against that seems like
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:02:00.000]  common sense i mean it's nothing special but nowadays it's kind of weird hope frances has
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:05.600]  an edict on climate change the headline says it will anger deniers in u.s churches and he says
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:09.840]  we've got to get behind and adopt the u n plan which will kill about a billion people according
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:16.000]  to lord montan who is a catholic i should add and stands up for human life so i've always been able
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:21.200]  to say you know at least the catholic church's pro life when people criticize it well this is bad
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:28.000]  and i'll also ask the catholics that are calling in am i wrong but i thought it was canon law that
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:34.880]  you couldn't have a jesuit as the pope and i'm not even here bashing the jesuits a lot of our
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:39.200]  guests that come on that really fight tyranny like rama govern others you know or jesuit trained
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:44.880]  i judge people by people but this does not look good and then the mainstream media is always saying
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:52.960]  how great this guy is and obama's praising him i mean what's next uh so uh nick in california
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:57.840]  thanks for holding you're listening on 1340 go ahead thank you for your time i like i'm still
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:04.320]  at this point i didn't see you in tanik who's a computer generated um you know it's a lot about
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:13.840]  how you the mentality and how you walk on this ground level um you uh well you talk about the
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:23.360]  fine print on these labels uh you have to be so rushed you can't read them um you well back you
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:29.280]  were asking talking about brainstorming and i was brainstorming and you were uh with this guy talking
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:36.000]  about immigration and um now i'm going we need those mexicans because they are not flat footed
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:41.840]  they got here on their own thing and and you were talking earlier about how we see things
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:48.240]  i only i'm a borderline flat foot i'm very lightweight this place is methyl bromide
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:55.440]  at half the time of the year there's a valley in san francisco they have six zones of fuel blend
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:04:00.800]  additives it all concoct it ends up here no you're right i mean our water is poisoned and i get
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:07.680]  the cliche is pretty accurate that latin american mexican workers smart hardworking people not now
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:14.240]  latin america has had a huge population bloom it's collapsed and criminal dregs or welfare heads
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:19.120]  you know people that wear six x underwear are showing up and they're ordering 30 000 pairs of them
[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:24.240]  so folks are coming up here to get a free ride the country's bankrupt and so the cliche
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:32.800]  that uh the people all coming up here want to work is just that a big fat giant cliche
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:39.040]  now what just happened with the latin americans is they will get welfare and work on the side
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:44.160]  because they like two paychecks so i guess you can say that's better than four whites or blacks who
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:48.800]  will uh on average we look at the demographic numbers we'll just sit there and not work on
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:54.080]  welfare but it's almost worse because they'll work for less that drives down the wages so
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:05:02.080]  the globalists are for open borders i'm against it when you're out on the road the last place

[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:21.840]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:29.600]  now we had the food babe on talking about the globalist fight to stop gmo labeling a lot more
[02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:33.920]  in some of the victories but in the first hour i raised the point to open the phones on pope
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:39.520]  frances coming out and saying he's issued an edict on climate change that we should just adopt the
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:48.160]  un program and hold it bans single family homes bans uh most people having cars puts taxes on
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:54.480]  basically everything you can imagine shuts down the family farm it is a dark age selectively enforced
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:09:00.240]  upon enemies of the globalist and having the leader of a billion 200 million people come out
[02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:06.400]  and say that is a big deal pontiff hopes to inspire action at next year's un meeting in paris
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:13.440]  in december after visits to philippines in new york we have beaten back this onslaught that is a
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:19.280]  total takeover now i don't want to spend the rest of the hour on this you're welcome to call in
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:23.920]  about it we have loaded phones i said i wanted to hear from catholic specifically if they're upset
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:30.800]  about this and i should have just said people period but i don't want to turn it into just a
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:35.680]  bunch of bashing or worship or whatever the point is this has been done and
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:44.400]  it's very anti-life not in my view but in the facts lord montan a prominent catholic
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:50.640]  who's done analysis of this says it'll kill about a billion people over 10 years and that's a
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:56.560]  conservative number this is total anti-human activity you know when obama comes out and says
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:00.880]  you know we need to have carbon taxes and africans can't have cars or air conditioners i'm upset
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:08.000]  about it not because obama's black but because he's a eugenicist and when the pope comes out
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:14.400]  and says this i'm not attacking him because he's catholic uh i'm i'm attacking his stance to do
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:21.120]  this that i know is a total fraud so i think catholics particularly who disagree with this uh
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:27.360]  should let it be heard uh directly to the vatican itself and as well to your local uh
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.560]  is it's diocese just like when they have Protestant groups come out and promote open
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:40.000]  borders or gun control you need to protest that you need to say no to that i mean we need to stop letting
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  you know what i'm saying
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:47.920]  major religious organizations push the globalist agenda you know you notice that the pope came
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:52.800]  out and endorsed the second amendment they say how dare you be political but when he does this oh
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:58.640]  obama's praising him i mean it's just crazy the irs is auditing tens of thousands and harassing
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:04.160]  christian churches libertarian churches patriot churches veterans groups you name it
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:10.720]  admittedly is political persecution that's been released in the documents and that's okay
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:15.120]  see it's all selective just like the carbon taxes will be selective
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:20.800]  let's go ahead and go to bill in wisconsin you're on the air what's your take on this
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:30.320]  yeah alex um first of all if we can say it happy new year but anyway i am what's known as a traditional
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:40.640]  catholic born and raised in the catholic church and years ago my parents and myself and many others
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:50.480]  began to detect uh some uh changes within the church that were not catholic it does not go to
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:59.440]  this current occupant of the papal c francis it goes back to the vatican council too and
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:09.600]  they made major changes in doctrine and in the apostolic succession and consequently there is
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:17.280]  an alternative there are traditional catholic pockets of resistance throughout the world
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:28.560]  we say that the sea is vacant in other words for since john the 23rd paul the sixth john paul the
[02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:38.080]  second and now this so-called francis that they are occupiers just like we have occupiers within
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:46.640]  our government they are occupiers within the catholic church deliberate subverters who have
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:54.160]  brought about these changes not only to bring havoc in the world but to destroy
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:13:04.000]  the means of grace for catholics and anyone else that would want to become a catholic
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:14.400]  and consequently you know you can go back and see how freemasons and um these anti-catholic groups
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:21.920]  infiltrated the church over a hundred years ago but they did not have the control of the papal
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:31.600]  sea which they now have since this bogus council promoted all of these things now i would like to
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:39.440]  put out a website that people can go to and find out about these traditional catholic
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:53.200]  uh pockets of resistance and it's c m r i dot org c m r i dot org we go three and a half miles
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:14:00.720]  not every sunday three and a half hours i'm sorry wife correct me here three and a half hours to
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:09.840]  attend a traditional mass not this bogus thing that goes on in your parish and in the diocese
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:17.840]  they are all under the thumb of the new world order and consequently there is a solution there
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:25.840]  is a way that people can still practice their traditional catholic faith fight the new world
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:34.960]  order and uh stop what's going on in the world well as as soon as i saw a mainstream media
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:39.840]  that was always bashing catholics switched to worshiping and understand and research what
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:46.240]  you're saying about this happening you know 60 70 years ago but now i think it's really a cherry
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:52.000]  on top i mean i'm not a catholic but i'm going from research to just memory isn't it in the doctrine
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:59.360]  like a long time ago that that uh a jesuit cannot be pope well uh they're not supposed to take
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:09.120]  titles in in things like that but you'll notice francis does not call himself or sign uh himself
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:18.880]  as as pope francis he says simply francis last night on 60 minutes there was almost the entire
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:27.440]  show on the vatican and on francis and so forth and it it showed you know the francis has his own
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:35.760]  rabbi and the rabbi says well uh francis is a revolutionary he understands what's going on
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:45.200]  okay but most catholics sitting in the pew have no idea they changed the the idea of going to mass
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:51.680]  on sunday to saturday night they like that they can go saturday night then they can watch all the
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:16:00.720]  football games and they can do this and that and they've taken away a lot of the uh traditions of
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:09.520]  penance and prayer and and things like that that made them catholics and and you know you might
[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:16.400]  disagree with it but kept them in line kept them in line they were having big families now they're
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:24.880]  not they were not of course and now they call it annulment okay tenry the eighth was booted out
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:34.000]  of the catholic church took the almost the entire nation okay because of what was uh you know they
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:42.640]  wouldn't let them have his second wife third wife fourth wife fifth wife sixth wife you know this was
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:53.520]  this was the catholic church standing up against something that was wrong sin and therefore uh you
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:17:02.240]  know now if a catholic doesn't like the wife that he's married well we can go and get an annulment
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:12.400]  no what god has joined together let no man put us under so that's what's going on good catholics
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:19.360]  that listen to alex you don't have to put up with it you can stand up for your catholic faith
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:29.520]  find these pockets of resistance go to cmri.org and uh they have app listen to this alex they have
[02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:39.600]  apostolic succession coming from an archbishop from vietnam who saw what was going on he was a
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:48.720]  member of the dm family and while he was not in the country when the rest of the family was
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:59.280]  assassinated by the cm by the cia uh you know it was archbishop tux so they have their apostolic
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:09.680]  succession we are ordaining priests that provide valid sacraments you know it's a whole different
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:14.080]  world and i'm familiar with that move and i know mel Gibson's been involved in that so they kind of

[02:24:57.440 --> 02:25:03.280]  ukraine shut down one of the six reactors in its most powerful nuclear power plant today
[02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:06.560]  for the second time in a month because of an apparent electrical malfunction

[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:34.640]  disconnected from the grid by the generator's internal defense mechanism yeah i love how
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:39.440]  they just turn off themselves and then blow up like Chernobyl an official statement said the
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:45.120]  plant was operating at 40 power their reason for the outage are being investigated yeah
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:49.920]  i'll tell you it's great what george soros did with five billion dollars of us taxpayer money
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:56.000]  overthrowing the country stirring stuff up with russia thanks a lot are you for that putin alex
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:02.400]  no that i'm not for starting wars i really don't like the communist chinese leadership
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:06.400]  if our government was on their border overthrowing stuff trying to start a war with them i'd be
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:11.120]  against it because our government's run by a bunch of special interests that are even worse
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:16.960]  a short circuit the same power station's third reactor contributed to power cuts
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:23.120]  cross ukraine earlier this month the union is in the southeast of the country is europe's largest
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:28.640]  and fifth most powerful in the world oh it blows up that ought to be nice it generates up to 40 percent
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:35.440]  of ukraine's nuclear power and switched on its first reactor 84 the prime minister noted the
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:39.120]  previous outage during one of his cabinet sessions urged ministers to tell the truth
[02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:46.400]  about the accident his words not go unnoticed the term accident was after all the word used
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:53.680]  with a soviet newspaper when it reported on chernobyl disaster in ukraine four days late on
[02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:57.520]  the 30th of april and it took them like over a week to really admit how bad it was they just
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:03.280]  admitted something had happened in four days after by then most the residents of towns neighboring
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:10.160]  the plant had been evacuated weeks stunned and later largely forgotten yep just like in japan
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:18.720]  so folks want to talk about fukushima i mean that happened four years ago three and a half years ago
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:29.120]  how long did that happen six general electric reactors big ones over 35 years old almost 40 years
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:35.360]  old not supposed to be kept on more than 30 years that radiation just eats the equipment
[02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:41.120]  they're storing the waste there it's four years ago okay i was going for memory thanks
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:50.400]  they pop in my ear and remind me of stuff so four years ago one of them was a mox reactor
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:28:00.080]  that uses plutonium and uranium the most horrid type it blew up and i could measure it off the
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:06.880]  electrical pulse heights and i said it looked like it shot stuff a mile in the air a year later
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:14.960]  the new york times admitted that it shot the reactor a mile in the air it was not a hydrogen
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:22.960]  explosion it achieved limited fission and exploded and we had all these in fact who's the
[02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:29.040]  top scientist we have on routinely um will pop my head to men and on fukushima
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:38.560]  he wears the beanie cap um he's a chemical physicist i want to get him back on because
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:44.880]  everything he said later came out in the news that rained down and our media's like it's no big
[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:49.280]  deal no problem then all this radioactive tuna came in and they covered that up and some radio
[02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:54.400]  radioactive isotopes went up over 2 000 times safe levels so the epa you said oh we'll just
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:29:00.080]  say it's safe now here's the problem with the prevailing trade winds and the jet stream it just
[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:06.240]  loops around the earth towards europe and then back around over us we will get this radiation as well
[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:10.880]  but if it has melted down or had a crisis you can count on them not to tell you
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:12.880]  you
[02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:16.960]  the parallels with today's conflict torn ukraine are obvious
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:22.960]  but a press officer for the plant said it would be a major exaggeration to describe either
[02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:28.400]  recent event is significant nuclear incident the latest shutdown will be zero rated in the
[02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:33.920]  international nuclear scale events and it just goes on who knows what the truth is we've had
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:38.560]  reactors blow up in california and other areas completely blow up and they covered them up for
[02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:45.520]  30 years that salt reactor they had that radiated most of california they just covered that up so
[02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:53.760]  we'll be back stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:55.360]  want to get into media companies and executives on the hot seat in 2015 i want to look at what i call
[02:33:55.360 --> 02:34:06.560]  the media information singularity and give you my predictions on that i want to get to the intensification
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:18.080]  of police getting shot or shot at and it's a good thing that the idiots that are buying into shooting
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:25.360]  police are such bad shots and you got to be a pretty big moron to just randomly want to go shoot cops
[02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:32.160]  in some jurisdiction for no reason and so it's happening in florida california and other states
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:40.160]  new york they're they're they're shooting at police it happened in ferguson and
[02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:45.760]  i'm going to give you my take on that because it's a very dangerous situation obviously
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:52.640]  and the whole thing is being financed and protected by the usual suspects uh briefly

[02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:58.240]  in california patty you're on the air hey thanks alex um i was raised catholic and just so you
[02:37:58.240 --> 02:38:05.520]  know your parish is your church it's like your little town the deosas is like the county which
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:11.680]  many churches can belong to and i'm a student self-taught of eschatology which is like the study
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:18.000]  of end times i studied with uh java witnesses and seven-day adventures and it's really interesting
[02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:24.640]  there was prophecies about this pope being the last pope by saint malachi i don't know if you
[02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:34.480]  remember that at all i've heard of that he had made prophecies in the 12th century of the 266
[02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:41.040]  following popes he did it in the style of nostradamus he would write the name and a little blurb about
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:48.400]  each pope and the last pope he said and i can read it it's pretty short in the extreme persecution
[02:38:48.400 --> 02:38:54.080]  of the holy roman church there will sit peter the roman who will pasture his sheep and by
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:39:00.080]  pasturing his sheep that can also mean feeding his sheep in many tribulations and when these things
[02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:05.120]  are finished the city of seven hills which is considered realm the city of seven hills will
[02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:12.800]  be destroyed and the terrible judge will judge his people the end so um i've been really watching
[02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:18.320]  this pope because he was supposed to be the last pope and you know he started out really good
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:25.360]  pope francis and they're like well maybe he's the last of the you know bad popes and he's the start
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:31.920]  of the good popes or whatever but uh when i saw what was going on with him hooking up with the whole
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:38.480]  climate change thing i'm thinking he might be making a deal with the devil to feed his sheep
[02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:45.840]  literally when um like when you had steven quail unless we could said that there was food shortages
[02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:52.720]  and the decodas and we know that the prices of food have quadrupled in the ukraine over the past
[02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:57.920]  year with what's going on with the oil prices that's all kind of related you know that um we
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:05.680]  could be seeing um food shortages and he could be making preparations to to feed his people
[02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:12.160]  and that could be why he's doing this deal because the whole climate change thing is interconnected
[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:16.240]  with the food and the food supply well i mean that's going to cut the food off as the whole
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:20.880]  point of they bring in carbon taxes worldwide they had carbon taxes for two years and it
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:27.840]  devastated australian agriculture folks have no idea how evil this is it is total control
[02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:33.840]  of every facet and every detail of our lives by a un council and that's what he's calling for and
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:40.000]  we need to spur a debate about this thank you so much patty lino in nevada thanks for holding
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:44.640]  you're on the year hello alexis is the first time i've listened to you and i've been listening to
[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:50.320]  you i think just for a few months i call i don't usually uh you know i wasn't going to call i don't
[02:40:50.320 --> 02:40:54.480]  usually call and usually i just listen for information purposes i wanted to collect
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:59.440]  correct your caller the set of a contest who called who uh talked about bishop took milk
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:05.760]  gibson wasn't under bishop took uh he was under under arch bishop uh philae arch bishop filet
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:12.720]  bernard filet he's still alive um uh and it's a pious intense society that uh that um he was
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:19.040]  that mill gibson was in association association with fact it's that very society that is right
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:24.880]  now in controversy with roam in keeping the traditions alive and they're doing a heroic
[02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:29.520]  job by the way their masses are all over the world they're throughout this country and anybody can
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:34.880]  look it up and find them but anyway what i wanted to get out of this you know i remembered your comment
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:40.720]  about you know uh how many you know how you'd like to state so much and so little time i've
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:46.000]  studied this for over 40 years uh i don't know where to begin so i've decided to go on a timeline
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:51.760]  with this and and it begins thus uh you know after the founding of the free masons we had pope
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:42:01.680]  clementus 12th in the in around 1730 1740 who began to warn in an encyclical uh the faithful
[02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:07.360]  about secret societies that were popping up all over the place it was happening uh you know when
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:11.600]  the masons were founded i'm not going to go into that but it happened within 20 years after their
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:15.920]  founding they began to make trouble and there was a pope that paid attention to this and wrote about
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:20.320]  it pope clement the the 12th uh people who are interested can go in and look up his encyclicals
[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:27.200]  and we'll go into details next we have um we have seven eight mystics that deal with us that had
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:33.760]  up that had appearances had apparitions and so on we have two marine apparitions related to this
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:40.480]  eight popes that that dealt with this issue we next have in the mid 19th century pope benedict
[02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:46.560]  the 16th who wrote an encyclical called morari moose warning about these things we begin to
[02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:51.120]  see things heating up uh with these secret societies don't forget this is after the french
[02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:55.920]  revolution pope pope clement the 12th was before the french revolution warned about this sort of
[02:42:55.920 --> 02:43:02.320]  thing we have the french revolution then we have pope benedict the 16th i mean the pope benedict
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:09.520]  the 14th rather uh beginning to really sound the alarm about revolutions beginning to develop
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:16.160]  all over europe now the two there i'm going to mention only uh three three mystics four mystics
[02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:23.120]  that relate to this one was a woman by the name of adam ria tai eggy she knew napoleon born apart
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:30.880]  part's mother was friends with her she had visions and she had many children uh and she she she's
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:35.680]  basically saying they blessed adam ria tai eggy and she had visions the end product of this is
[02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:40.800]  simply this she said i see i'm just only going to give you this phrase from one of her revision
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:46.720]  she says i see in those days she said i see russians in genoa she says okay so we'll leave
[02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:52.320]  adam ria tai eggy there people can look up her writings and uh and look at the details next we
[02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:58.400]  have an kathryn emmerich who was a stigmata she was a nun an augustinian monk and for 50 years
[02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:03.520]  had the stigmata was lived on nothing but the eucharist for some 50 years and discussed the
[02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:09.040]  utter destruction of the catholic church and the the attempts by traditional catholics to build it
[02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:15.120]  up will leave that aside there are some 4000 uh there there's some four uh four thousand pages
[02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:21.120]  of material for people who wish to go into and kathryn emmerich's visions okay so we'll go there now
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:26.960]  sir that's very interesting i just wanted to get your take on the current pope basically calling
[02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:32.080]  for the un to run the planet through carbon taxes i need to get some other callers hit some other news
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:36.560]  it's very interesting but just wrap it up for folks within three days after his ascent to the
[02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:41.360]  papacy the way he acted told me that he was a communist ideologue i knew he was marxist i've
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:46.960]  studied marxist by the way i i'm a you know uh you know completed my studies years ago in
[02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:52.000]  philosophy i took a specialty in marxism and existentialism i knew immediately by the way
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:57.440]  he acted that he was a marxist and i began to tell some of my friends a few of whom quit talking to
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:04.720]  me because of it um and um i the reason i say that is because of what what the con what marxist
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:09.200]  will do once they get into your organization especially the catholic church they lower the
[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:14.880]  they lower the uh your gaze let's put it this way they confine your gaze to the material
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:19.680]  and that's precisely what this pope did did in taking the option for the poor he didn't raise
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:23.760]  our gaze he didn't put on the papal tear so that we could look up at the papal tear and
[02:45:23.760 --> 02:45:28.960]  watch him repose on its throne to look beyond him to be inspired by him and love jesus christ
[02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:33.840]  and the blessed mother he didn't do that he basically brought our gaze down into the streets
[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:37.440]  and it was and it was upon that principle a little bowl that i had decided that this is
[02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:44.160]  that this is a marxist no different from cadel castro who in uh the early 1960s did the same thing
[02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:49.840]  when he went to harlem and began to uh butcher his own chickens in a motel there in a hotel there
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:57.040]  and and did the same thing in in in basically uh drawing everybody's attention to with his option
[02:45:57.040 --> 02:46:02.960]  for the poor very interesting sir thanks for holding to tell us all that it's it's just it's
[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:09.360]  complex very interesting at the perspectives all i know is this a kill a bunch of people carbon
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:17.520]  taxes half the world is living at survival level roughly and you raise their food prices it kills
[02:46:17.520 --> 02:46:24.400]  them and that's what this will do i want to get to a few other news stories and i'm going to go to
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:33.040]  tom and matt and paul and john and a few other callers here but adding some of the news on the
[02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:39.840]  police front this is the type of news we've got today anti police protesters planned to disrupt

[02:54:53.760 --> 02:55:00.880]  mole on lobby line and so much more or made in 1776.com i said i would get into the media
[02:55:00.880 --> 02:55:07.440]  singularity so i'll do that go into overdrive and go to tom matt poll and others that are
[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:12.800]  patiently holding media companies and executives on the hot seat in 2015 the new york times
[02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:20.000]  and they say while it's great to see the economy coming back which isn't really true even though
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:27.280]  fiat money's been printed by the trillions they go on to say that media movies cable news but
[02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:34.240]  across the board entertainment is cratering well there's a lot of reasons a you put out
[02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:40.640]  establishment bills everybody's sick of but more importantly there were roughly 10 million
[02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:50.080]  websites in 1996 97 last number i saw was three to five billion websites web pages not being counted
[02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:56.320]  there's so many other pages but there are billions of different destinations on the web
[02:55:56.320 --> 02:56:00.960]  more people are getting cameras more people are being journalists more people are doing blogs
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:08.880]  and so we were able to come into the new media early and grow slowly and become very large
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:15.440]  but there's more competition every day of entertainment sex news whatever we're being
[02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:20.080]  atomized and what is the singularity it's when machines and technology gets so incredible that
[02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:24.960]  it starts growing exponentially until you become omnipresent the elite believe we're done we're a
[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:28.640]  joke they're going to merge whether they're going to be gods i don't know if that singularity is
[02:56:28.640 --> 02:56:33.280]  possible sounds more like a singularity of destruction when all these technologies get
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:37.680]  developed and we don't know what we're doing with them but there is a singularity or at least a
[02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:45.120]  presingularity of information where in the next five to ten years you're going to see hundreds of
[02:56:45.120 --> 02:56:53.920]  billions of pieces of content out there i mean youtube we could use to easily get you know 500
[02:56:53.920 --> 02:56:58.880]  thousand million views on a youtube and we still get millions of views sometimes and and things
[02:56:58.880 --> 02:57:06.240]  like that but it's much more competition and people that were huge on the web are now tiny on the
[02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:12.160]  web we're bigger than ever in the aggregate but if you just take something like youtube with so
[02:57:12.160 --> 02:57:16.720]  much competition more than half the video views in the world every day are on youtube i mean just
[02:57:16.720 --> 02:57:25.040]  the competition is staggering well we are seeking liberty and freedom against all this other
[02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:31.920]  atomized confusing cacophony that kind of puts people into a too much information mode where they
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:37.520]  just go into a catatonic state or give up it's our job to point out in the scheme of information
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:40.880]  we really are covering as close as you're going to get to what's really happening
[02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:47.280]  and trying to formulate a general idea to have a debate about the future of the human species
[02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:53.840]  but i've got a stack of news about media going under reality tv facing its own reality la times
[02:57:53.840 --> 02:58:02.320]  a huge rating slump across the board because the real reality tv is online it's people that put
[02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:06.960]  webcams in their houses it's people that put webcams in their offices it's it's one website with tens
[02:58:06.960 --> 02:58:12.880]  of thousands and growing where people dial in to business webcams with audio that folks don't know
[02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:20.720]  have been dialed into because they just use the default code so what rose the new alternative
[02:58:20.720 --> 02:58:25.040]  media that happened to be patriot many cases because we cared about freedom so we were there first
[02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:31.920]  we'll also atomize us so we better be getting bigger and reaching more people now while we
[02:58:31.920 --> 02:58:38.240]  still have a big voice ahead of the media singularity that i'd say is about seven to ten years out
[02:58:38.240 --> 02:58:43.200]  maybe even quicker we're gonna go to overdrive main transmission's over god bless you all
[02:58:43.200 --> 02:58:51.200]  gonna take a few calls stay with us sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive

[03:01:10.800 --> 03:01:16.240]  scuffles and stuff and i guess they were all got together and supposedly used this you know social
[03:01:16.240 --> 03:01:20.480]  networking or something prompted them to go there's what they said i said they really said there was
[03:01:20.480 --> 03:01:24.880]  a couple hundred of them there like i've seen a bunch of those stories this week that's been
[03:01:24.880 --> 03:01:32.000]  happening a lot and white kids do it black kids Hispanic kids mixed groups of kids uh it's just
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:35.600]  absolutely idiotic and mindless i mean i did stupid stuff when i was a kid too but
[03:01:35.600 --> 03:01:41.840]  well i usually got blamed for stuff i hadn't done like i'd be the guy when they were tying

[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:58.880]  don't know what it is yeah five arrested after brawl at navy pier appreciate your call tom
[03:01:58.880 --> 03:02:04.720]  interesting point uh let's talk to matt and mass you're on the air go ahead hey how's it going
[03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:08.960]  good brother um i'm calling to talk about the intelligent traffic system because a lot of
[03:02:08.960 --> 03:02:12.800]  people aren't talking about this most people don't know much about it it's going to be meant to
[03:02:12.800 --> 03:02:18.800]  taxes and attracts everywhere we go um yeah exactly well the cameras put up on top of all
[03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:24.480]  the traffic lights the cctv cameras they're called autoscopes solar care that's one company that makes
[03:02:24.480 --> 03:02:29.440]  them uh here in massachusetts they were put up under the mass chapter 90 roadwork program
[03:02:29.440 --> 03:02:33.440]  that's called the intelligent traffic system it's supposed to change the lights with the cars
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:37.760]  but the problem is is that what they really do what i found out by going to my fusion center in
[03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:43.360]  manor massachusetts and asking questions is that these these cameras on top of the traffic lights
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:47.680]  actually record all the time and take pictures of the cars as they go on of course they did
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:52.480]  so see they have one legitimate use that they tell us about but that's maybe two percent of
[03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:58.240]  what it really is up to yeah and the thing is they deny that see that my local police department
[03:02:58.240 --> 03:03:03.600]  dilemmas of police in my city they don't have access to these cameras in massachusetts they
[03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:07.920]  act like the cameras don't exist but they admit that they exist at the fusion center right down
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:12.800]  to a point where every single one of us has a file in a data center which is owned by a private
[03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:17.840]  company to try and nationalize the one in utah but every single one of us has a file so say you
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:21.440]  throw your cell phone out the window after a protest and you think you went there and they
[03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:25.760]  don't know who you are they can just track you by these traffic cameras all the way back that's
[03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:30.160]  right everywhere you go is a complete database of everywhere you go and what you do and nobody
[03:03:30.160 --> 03:03:34.480]  you ask and i'm gonna say it again this is a great caller i'm glad you raised this and it freaks you
[03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:41.520]  out all the new smart tv's listen to you and record you and in the terms of service tell you
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:47.680]  that what you say is being given to third party so quote watch what you say i mean that that's
