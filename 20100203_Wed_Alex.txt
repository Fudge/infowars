[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:32.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:32.880 --> 00:40.040]  Wolfgang Wardog will be joining us from the EU today.
[00:40.040 --> 00:46.880]  He is the head of the Health Council of the Council of Europe, the one criminally investigating
[00:46.880 --> 00:49.360]  the big pharma companies.
[00:49.360 --> 00:52.360]  That is an extremely important interview coming up.
[00:52.360 --> 00:57.920]  It's not enough to expose the hoax of the swine flu as a dangerous injection and a fraud
[00:57.920 --> 01:02.460]  and that the flu wasn't even dangerous compared to the regular flu.
[01:02.460 --> 01:07.320]  We must expose the criminality and bring them to justice so they won't engage in other dangerous
[01:07.320 --> 01:08.880]  hoaxes in the future.
[01:08.880 --> 01:13.080]  Judge Andrew Napolitano will be joining us coming up in the next segment to talk about
[01:13.080 --> 01:17.320]  a host of key issues and then Freeway Ricky Ross.
[01:17.320 --> 01:21.560]  We interviewed him once from prison over the phone from prison.
[01:21.560 --> 01:26.560]  He'll be live with us out of prison, one of the biggest cocaine dealers in U.S. history
[01:26.560 --> 01:31.480]  selling drugs for the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:31.480 --> 01:34.320]  So that is coming up in the third hour.
[01:34.320 --> 01:38.320]  Kevin Booth will also be popping in with us with his new film, How We Won the West,
[01:38.320 --> 01:43.640]  in government drug dealing and how the drug war works, and also Dr. Doug Rocky, who wrote
[01:43.640 --> 01:49.880]  the book for the Pentagon on DU and how deadly it was in the aftermath for our troops and
[01:49.880 --> 01:54.960]  the Iraqis, the Serbs and others dying from it.
[01:54.960 --> 01:58.560]  That is coming up in the last hour today.
[01:58.560 --> 02:02.960]  So you definitely want to stay with us throughout the full four hours.
[02:02.960 --> 02:11.600]  Andrew Napolitano, Wolfgang Wardog, Ricky Ross, Dr. Doug Rocky and others, ladies and
[02:11.600 --> 02:16.760]  gentlemen, totally jam-packed radio broadcast today, and we have your Twitter questions
[02:16.760 --> 02:22.880]  coming in for all of those guests, twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones.
[02:22.880 --> 02:29.400]  Those are pouring in on the news front.
[02:29.400 --> 02:35.760]  There is no doubt the government is getting ready to stage a provocateur new terror attacks.
[02:35.760 --> 02:39.720]  And the CIA, in fact, I noticed this wasn't my stack, guys.
[02:39.720 --> 02:46.600]  It's the Kurt Nemo's top story on infowars.com, CIA says al-Qaeda to attack in the next three
[02:46.600 --> 02:47.600]  to six months.
[02:47.600 --> 02:48.600]  I need that.
[02:48.600 --> 02:51.200]  Thank you so much information.
[02:51.200 --> 03:00.800]  And I wanted to dovetail that with top neocons saying Obama should save presidency by attacking
[03:00.800 --> 03:03.320]  Iran.
[03:03.320 --> 03:05.360]  That is a prisonplanet.com story.
[03:05.360 --> 03:12.080]  And I wanted to dovetail that further with this story from August 10, 2007, the Philadelphia
[03:12.080 --> 03:19.880]  Daily News column pitching for more dead Americans, neocon fetish, the Ward Churchill of the demented
[03:19.880 --> 03:24.320]  right wing has a death wish for terror in order to unite the country.
[03:24.320 --> 03:30.480]  Remember what he said when the columnist called for another 9-11 and how great it was for
[03:30.480 --> 03:32.960]  their agenda?
[03:32.960 --> 03:34.680]  We have all these Pentagon reports.
[03:34.680 --> 03:35.760]  We have the CIA.
[03:35.760 --> 03:41.120]  We have neocons currently saying we need new wars, new attacks to get our agenda through.
[03:41.120 --> 03:45.600]  They are right out in the open with what their agenda is and what they're doing.
[03:45.600 --> 03:51.120]  They think you're so stupid that they're going to be able to get away with this.
[03:51.120 --> 03:56.240]  So we're going to be talking about that throughout the broadcast today.
[03:56.240 --> 04:03.080]  Also another devastatingly powerful report and we directly have the U.S. support for
[04:03.080 --> 04:09.120]  arms trade treaty and Obama signaling a month ago that he plans to sign it.
[04:09.120 --> 04:15.360]  Headline at infowars.com from the national gun rights blog, U.S. agrees to timetable
[04:15.360 --> 04:18.200]  for a U.N. gun ban.
[04:18.200 --> 04:22.720]  And remember Newsmax with the headline, U.S. hands control of Internet over to United
[04:22.720 --> 04:23.720]  Nations.
[04:23.720 --> 04:25.520]  Everything is being handed over.
[04:25.520 --> 04:31.200]  They tried to officially under treaty hand over all of our industry and energy to the
[04:31.200 --> 04:34.480]  U.N. two months ago in Copenhagen.
[04:34.480 --> 04:36.840]  They're still moving forward to attack the states at that level.
[04:36.840 --> 04:45.960]  We'll talk about it all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick
[04:45.960 --> 04:51.840]  break and we're going to be talking to Judge Andrew Palatano live.
[04:51.840 --> 04:57.560]  It is the third day, Wednesday, the third of February 2010.
[04:57.560 --> 05:00.240]  Stay with us.
[05:00.240 --> 05:04.200]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[05:04.200 --> 05:07.080]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[05:07.080 --> 05:08.480]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[05:08.480 --> 05:09.480]  It's very real.
[05:09.480 --> 05:13.340]  I know because I use one every day in my own home and it's available right now to you.
[05:13.340 --> 05:16.880]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Acola Blue, you'll know what's

[05:31.000 --> 05:34.180]  The Acola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.

[05:36.600 --> 05:40.560]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including

[06:02.400 --> 06:06.120]  Residents of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[06:06.120 --> 06:09.280]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[06:09.280 --> 06:13.640]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[06:13.640 --> 06:14.640]  at home.
[06:14.640 --> 06:19.280]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[06:19.280 --> 06:20.280]  calling the shots.
[06:20.280 --> 06:25.640]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[06:25.640 --> 06:31.200]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[06:31.200 --> 06:35.760]  bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[06:35.760 --> 06:38.160]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[06:38.160 --> 06:42.080]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[06:42.080 --> 06:48.160]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[06:48.160 --> 06:49.480]  of the Republic.
[06:49.480 --> 06:53.960]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[06:53.960 --> 07:00.520]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[07:00.520 --> 07:01.520]  Hi, everyone.
[07:01.520 --> 07:02.520]  Andy Anderson here.
[07:02.520 --> 07:06.400]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other
[07:06.400 --> 07:07.400]  nasties?
[07:07.400 --> 07:10.880]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknob shopping carts and
[07:10.880 --> 07:12.680]  handrails we touch every day.
[07:12.680 --> 07:17.000]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[07:17.000 --> 07:18.960]  No more protection till you use it again.
[07:18.960 --> 07:20.200]  Pure Works to the rescue.
[07:20.200 --> 07:24.640]  Our FDA compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[07:24.640 --> 07:26.880]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[07:26.880 --> 07:33.200]  Pure Works disinfecting spray is EPA certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis
[07:33.200 --> 07:37.920]  B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kill C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses
[07:37.920 --> 07:41.560]  and bacteria, moles and fungus too, so even safe around pets and children.

[07:44.680 --> 07:45.680]  No more dry skin.
[07:45.680 --> 07:50.560]  Here's to a little piece of mind knowing that your hands are still germ-free hours later.

[07:56.720 --> 07:57.720]  your hands.
[07:57.720 --> 08:00.640]  That's 888-245-0300.
[08:00.640 --> 08:06.560]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[08:06.560 --> 08:31.320]  a war on for your mind.
[08:31.320 --> 08:37.680]  Now with us for the next 20 minutes is Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, and of course he hosts
[08:37.680 --> 08:40.720]  his own TV show on the Fox Business Channel.
[08:40.720 --> 08:43.280]  He has his own syndicated radio broadcast.
[08:43.280 --> 08:49.520]  He does Freedom Watch as well, and I think he's the best person out there, period, on
[08:49.520 --> 08:50.520]  national television.
[08:50.520 --> 08:57.400]  In fact, he's the only person that I agree with, almost 100 percent, and he's a constitutional
[08:57.400 --> 09:03.840]  lawyer, judge, of course, award-winning researcher, best-selling author, and we are very, very
[09:03.840 --> 09:06.760]  honored to have him on.
[09:06.760 --> 09:09.720]  He's the author of Constitutional Chaos, What Happens When the Government Breaks Its
[09:09.720 --> 09:14.480]  Own Laws, New York Times Best Seller, The Constitution in Exile, How the Federal Government
[09:14.480 --> 09:18.160]  Has Seized Power by Rewriting the Supreme Law of the Land, and A Nation of Sheep.
[09:18.160 --> 09:22.440]  He's got a new book coming out, but he's with us until the bottom of the hour, so let's
[09:22.440 --> 09:23.440]  move quickly.
[09:23.440 --> 09:27.480]  Judge, I've got my list of rapid-fire questions, but I am ready for you, and thank you for
[09:27.480 --> 09:29.800]  that very generous introduction, my friend.
[09:29.800 --> 09:35.480]  Well, the truth is veritas and stands on its own, so the truth is the truth, not an introduction,
[09:35.480 --> 09:36.480]  just the truth.
[09:36.480 --> 09:41.880]  Judge, before I get into my questions, what is most important on your radar?
[09:41.880 --> 09:46.160]  What's important on my radar is fidelity to the Constitution.
[09:46.160 --> 09:50.120]  It's the supreme law of the land, and everybody in the government has taken an oath to uphold
[09:50.120 --> 09:51.120]  it.
[09:51.120 --> 09:58.120]  I see the political maneuverings and utter disregard of the Constitution with everything
[09:58.120 --> 10:04.680]  from bailouts, which aren't authorized, with everything from regulating contracts that
[10:04.680 --> 10:09.360]  banks can enter into, and salaries that can pay their executives, which aren't authorized,
[10:09.360 --> 10:14.040]  to trying people before military tribunals because we hate the person, or we hate the
[10:14.040 --> 10:18.200]  manner in which they attempted to commit their crime, none of that is authorized.
[10:18.200 --> 10:25.160]  My greatest fear is that lack of fidelity to the Constitution will expose innocent people
[10:25.160 --> 10:30.160]  to the wrath of the government in ways that the founders could never have imagined, but
[10:30.160 --> 10:36.080]  I must tell you, very, very few presidents and very, very few Congresses from the first
[10:36.080 --> 10:41.040]  one to the present one have been utterly faithful to the Constitution.
[10:41.040 --> 10:44.880]  They make their living by finding ways around it.
[10:44.880 --> 10:52.080]  Well, how do you hold somebody for five to seven years, admittedly torture them and
[10:52.080 --> 10:57.600]  threaten their families, and then use that evidence in trials?
[10:57.600 --> 11:00.800]  I mean, America is over if we allow this to happen.
[11:00.800 --> 11:05.720]  The precedent is then set for the end of habeas corpus and everything else that protects
[11:05.720 --> 11:06.720]  them.
[11:06.720 --> 11:07.720]  Absolutely.
[11:07.720 --> 11:11.320]  You're 100% on the mark if the government can do that, and the government has done it
[11:11.320 --> 11:12.600]  and gotten away with it.
[11:12.600 --> 11:19.080]  I mean, the government arrested Jose Padilla at O'Hare Airport because of a conversation
[11:19.080 --> 11:20.520]  he had in Pakistan.
[11:20.520 --> 11:24.800]  Mr. Padilla was born in Brooklyn, New York.
[11:24.800 --> 11:29.120]  His birth records are better known than the birth records of the President of the United
[11:29.120 --> 11:32.960]  States, even though this happened under the Bush years.
[11:32.960 --> 11:39.120]  He was kept in solitary confinement and tortured for four years without any communication
[11:39.120 --> 11:44.160]  with anybody from the outside, not even the guards who fed him his meals and escorted him
[11:44.160 --> 11:46.520]  to the bathroom.
[11:46.520 --> 11:51.120]  And then when the Supreme Court was about to say you can't do that, they suddenly sprung
[11:51.120 --> 11:57.320]  him from that solitary confinement with no charges, put him in a regular federal jail,
[11:57.320 --> 12:01.760]  charged him with a bogus crime, and persuaded a jury to convict him, and claimed they didn't
[12:01.760 --> 12:06.120]  use any of the evidence that he spilled under torture against him.
[12:06.120 --> 12:13.200]  They did this to an American citizen because of a conversation he had on a trip to Pakistan,
[12:13.200 --> 12:17.480]  not because he tried to shoot anybody, not because he tried to explode a bomb, not because
[12:17.480 --> 12:22.080]  he had bomb-making materials with him, but because he landed at O'Hare Airport within
[12:22.080 --> 12:26.680]  a few hours of the conversation, if they could do that to him, they could do it to anybody.
[12:26.680 --> 12:30.320]  And if they could do it to him, they could do it to anybody.
[12:30.320 --> 12:33.920]  So these are my peers, Alex, and I am seriously fearful of this.
[12:33.920 --> 12:40.040]  The Bush administration showed less fidelity to the Constitution than any administration
[12:40.040 --> 12:41.560]  since Abraham Lincoln.
[12:41.560 --> 12:48.480]  This administration is picking up exactly where Bush left off, is doing it with less
[12:48.480 --> 12:49.480]  in your face.
[12:49.480 --> 12:55.000]  There is no Dick Cheney in this administration who's boasting about torture, who's boasting
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.880]  about deficits, who's boasting about locking people up and throwing away the key, but they're
[12:59.880 --> 13:01.880]  doing the very same thing.
[13:01.880 --> 13:08.160]  Well, Judge Hitler targeted unpopular groups to set the precedent, but in the end, the
[13:08.160 --> 13:14.520]  target was the German people in surrounding nations, and expanding on this, if we allow
[13:14.520 --> 13:21.040]  torture to be admissible evidence, then North Vietnam was good in torturing our soldiers
[13:21.040 --> 13:26.720]  and airmen into lying, and North Korea was good, and the Soviets were good.
[13:26.720 --> 13:31.440]  And what we know from the Mayak and Homeland Security reports that we got and released
[13:31.440 --> 13:37.440]  to the public in 2009, what we know is the real architecture of Homeland Security in
[13:37.440 --> 13:44.120]  Northcom is pointed at red-blooded conservatives, libertarians, gun owners, returning veterans,
[13:44.120 --> 13:49.760]  and so what a perfect way to fool Middle America and conservatives into going along with tyranny
[13:49.760 --> 13:54.520]  and secret arrest and rendition and torture than saying it's for men that don't look
[13:54.520 --> 14:00.400]  like us from foreign countries to set that precedent when really the entire howitzer
[14:00.400 --> 14:03.920]  of tyranny is really focused and pointed at America.
[14:03.920 --> 14:10.960]  Well, of course, I mean, war is the health of the state, and fear is what gets us into
[14:10.960 --> 14:12.360]  into war.
[14:12.360 --> 14:16.760]  My new book is called Lies the Government Told You, comes out next month, Myth, Power,
[14:16.760 --> 14:20.120]  and Deception in American History, Question.
[14:20.120 --> 14:28.600]  Would FDR have been reelected in 1944 if the public knew he caused Pearl Harbor?
[14:28.600 --> 14:31.720]  Don't look the other way, but cause it to happen.
[14:31.720 --> 14:38.000]  Question, would George W. Bush have been reelected in 2004 if the public knew he made up the
[14:38.000 --> 14:45.920]  reasons for invading Iraq, that he was torturing people and spying on Americans and lying about
[14:45.920 --> 14:46.920]  it?
[14:46.920 --> 14:52.560]  Question, would LBJ have defeated Barry Goldwater, would he have successfully portrayed himself
[14:52.560 --> 14:57.360]  as the peace candidate if the public had secretly known, and the public knew that he had secretly
[14:57.360 --> 15:03.960]  made up the Gulf of Tonkin incident and was secretly planning to vamp up the Vietnam War?
[15:03.960 --> 15:07.080]  Bigger question, why did all these presidents want war?
[15:07.080 --> 15:11.520]  Because people are afraid in wartime and they will surrender their liberties and they will
[15:11.520 --> 15:15.520]  look the other way when agents of the government come for their neighbors.
[15:15.520 --> 15:19.840]  They will only complain when agents of the government come for them.
[15:19.840 --> 15:26.720]  Shifting gears to the pretext for war, we have a PrisonPlanet.com article by Steve Watson
[15:26.720 --> 15:33.960]  and top neoconservative Daniel Pipes writing for National Review says Obama should save
[15:33.960 --> 15:39.360]  presidency by attacking Iran and invoking a crisis the level of 9-11.
[15:39.360 --> 15:47.480]  That reminds me of the Philadelphia Daily News article titled, one month from the anniversary
[15:47.480 --> 15:55.480]  I'm thinking of another 9-11 would help America, I mean these guys are right out in the open
[15:55.480 --> 16:02.040]  saying they want new wars and the CIA is saying we will be hit by al-Qaeda in the next three
[16:02.040 --> 16:06.720]  to six months and then dovetailing that judge, I want your take on this, Kurt Haskell, his
[16:06.720 --> 16:11.160]  wife and a bunch of other witnesses went public and said a smart dressed man got the underwear
[16:11.160 --> 16:15.960]  bomber in Amsterdam on the plane and the State Department came out last Wednesday and said
[16:15.960 --> 16:22.640]  DetroitNews.com and said yes, we let him on to track him as al-Qaeda and there was another
[16:22.640 --> 16:27.720]  man on the plane supposedly with a bomb now, the FBI is backtracked on that but it's buried
[16:27.720 --> 16:33.240]  in an ABC News report, it's not getting the traction it needs, this looks like an attempt
[16:33.240 --> 16:39.720]  at provocateur or let the terrorist attack us as a pretext so Obama composes a savior.
[16:39.720 --> 16:47.720]  Well, of course it is and all of this stuff came out, not that the State Department let
[16:47.720 --> 16:53.440]  him on the plane but that the FBI has been entered into some kind of an agreement with
[16:53.440 --> 17:01.240]  his family so that he can speak with the FBI and that we are in danger of another 9-11,
[17:01.240 --> 17:05.280]  in fact these characters told us that a committee was absolutely certain that it was going to
[17:05.280 --> 17:08.920]  happen, I don't know how that could be certain but any, all this comes out at a time when
[17:08.920 --> 17:14.280]  the President's polls are low, when the Democrats are losing ground and I hold no water for
[17:14.280 --> 17:19.520]  the Republicans because like virtually all big government status, Ron Paul and a dozen
[17:19.520 --> 17:24.560]  or so in the House of the Exceptions to the rule but when the President needs shoring
[17:24.560 --> 17:31.240]  up is when they decide they want to scare us and what would scare us more than the
[17:31.240 --> 17:36.840]  Director of the FBI, the Director of Central Intelligence and the Director of National
[17:36.840 --> 17:42.880]  Intelligence all answering yes, yes, yes to the question are we certain to be attacked
[17:42.880 --> 17:49.120]  again, no specifics, no examples, no evidence chest, it's going to happen so be afraid,
[17:49.120 --> 17:54.000]  be very afraid and P.S. give us your freedoms so that we can keep you safe, that's what
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.000]  we'll come next.
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.880]  And let's go back, I remember in 2002-2003 and then even Ari Fleischer, White House
[18:00.880 --> 18:05.960]  Press Secretary bizarrely in a press conference said we're issuing these for political gain,
[18:05.960 --> 18:10.520]  I guess to try to cover his hind in but Ridge came out as you know in a best-selling book
[18:10.520 --> 18:16.160]  last year that the former head of Homeland Security and said we issued these for political
[18:16.160 --> 18:25.880]  effect under the Patriot Act issuing a fake terror threat is an act of terrorism itself.
[18:25.880 --> 18:32.560]  Absolutely, absolutely because it is lying to the American public and when the government
[18:32.560 --> 18:40.440]  lies to us and we rely on that false information, we make poor choices because we don't know
[18:40.440 --> 18:47.360]  the truth, we vote for presidents who tricked us like FDR, George Bush and LBJ, they end
[18:47.360 --> 18:54.000]  up with more power, they start with destructive wars and sap our freedoms, it's the same pattern
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.160]  over and over and over again.
[18:57.160 --> 19:02.160]  And with Obama stalling on every front with his Copenhagen greenhouse gas tax, open world
[19:02.160 --> 19:06.400]  government being announced, failing the flu hoax coming out, criminal investigations in
[19:06.400 --> 19:10.840]  Europe and England with the heads of the health department, the EU saying it was a payoff
[19:10.840 --> 19:14.360]  fraud to the health heads, he's coming on next hour.
[19:14.360 --> 19:20.040]  With all of this coming out with his big tax increases in trouble, his government seizure
[19:20.040 --> 19:24.600]  of healthcare in trouble because it's so illegal, the state's lining up to fight at the Attorney
[19:24.600 --> 19:30.240]  Generals, the federal and state courts with their entire agenda, his youth core falling
[19:30.240 --> 19:35.600]  apart, his lowest approval rating of any president in history one year in with the fastest decline
[19:35.600 --> 19:42.360]  accelerating towards something that looks Nixonian in 74, he is going to need a crisis
[19:42.360 --> 19:48.520]  and we've got neocons and establishment liberals saying attack Iran to get you dug out of this.
[19:48.520 --> 19:53.600]  I mean, these guys are right out in the open, judge, where do you see Obama going?
[19:53.600 --> 19:59.280]  Starting a war, picking a fight, creating a crisis so that we will unite behind him
[19:59.280 --> 20:05.560]  and in that euphoria of uniting behind him, they'll enact all the march towards socialism
[20:05.560 --> 20:12.000]  and they've tried to enact, just like the Republicans in the euphoria of unifying behind
[20:12.000 --> 20:17.800]  George W. Bush in the weeks and months after 9-11 enacted the Patriot Act, the most hateful
[20:17.800 --> 20:22.240]  and un-American piece of legislation ever enacted by Congress at least since the Alien
[20:22.240 --> 20:29.520]  Incedition Act of 1798, but president and the Democrats will do the same thing, a crisis
[20:29.520 --> 20:34.640]  makes people afraid, makes them think the government can take care of them and when
[20:34.640 --> 20:40.080]  the devil makes that satanic bargain, that satanic bargain, hey, give me your freedoms
[20:40.080 --> 20:45.360]  and I'll keep you safe, most Americans would give away their freedoms in return for safety.
[20:45.360 --> 20:52.400]  It doesn't work, you went up less free, less safe, and you don't get the freedoms back.
[20:52.400 --> 20:56.880]  Shifting to naked body scanners, they ordered them a year ago, Chertoff's making money off
[20:56.880 --> 21:02.520]  of it, a bunch of Obama officials are making money, as advisors, while they recommend these
[21:02.520 --> 21:09.240]  systems, he spent a billion bucks, he wants 215 million more, so every major airport of
[21:09.240 --> 21:16.360]  any size has them, it records your naked body, and then I have a headline here out of the
[21:16.360 --> 21:23.080]  British news where they're now saying, oh Al Qaeda is going to sew these into their body,
[21:23.080 --> 21:28.160]  and so now we need X-rays, chest X-rays, I mean this is insane.
[21:28.160 --> 21:33.520]  Well, this will put the airlines out of business because at some point people will say enough
[21:33.520 --> 21:34.520]  is enough.
[21:34.520 --> 21:39.720]  I think we ought to get rid of the TSA, the Transportation Safety Administration, and
[21:39.720 --> 21:44.640]  get the business of keeping airlines safe into the hands of the airlines.
[21:44.640 --> 21:50.440]  Look, if we were truly allowed the right to keep them bare arms, there would have been
[21:50.440 --> 22:00.200]  no 9-11 because some sane, safely armed passenger on one of those planes would have blown away
[22:00.200 --> 22:04.760]  the guys that commandeered them, but the same government that thinks it can keep us safe
[22:04.760 --> 22:07.160]  will not let us protect ourselves.
[22:07.160 --> 22:09.000]  Well, we notice how that works.
[22:09.000 --> 22:13.320]  First they disarm us, they domesticate us, like Chicago, like New York, and other gun
[22:13.320 --> 22:17.840]  ban cities, they disarmed the pilots six months, because before that they were, some of them
[22:17.840 --> 22:20.800]  were allowed if they got the license to carry a gun on the plane, you can trust them to
[22:20.800 --> 22:25.600]  fly the plane but not have a gun locked up in the cockpit, and then the more liberty
[22:25.600 --> 22:30.440]  we give up, the more tyranny they always sell us, the less safe we get, I mean they know
[22:30.440 --> 22:31.760]  exactly what they're doing.
[22:31.760 --> 22:33.320]  Well, of course they do.
[22:33.320 --> 22:37.200]  Look, flying has become a little bit safer now, not because of anything the government
[22:37.200 --> 22:42.600]  did, but because some pilots are carrying guns, because the cockpit doors are built
[22:42.600 --> 22:46.520]  like vaults, and because passengers are becoming more courageous.
[22:46.520 --> 22:53.480]  All this was done by individual behavior or corporate behavior, none of it by the government.
[22:53.480 --> 22:58.840]  In Newark, New Jersey, where a guy walked through a security door to kiss his girlfriend
[22:58.840 --> 23:04.920]  goodbye, and then walked back out the security door and left to the airport, they put 10,000
[23:04.920 --> 23:10.760]  people out in 15 degree cold at night in Newark because their surveillance cameras didn't
[23:10.760 --> 23:15.680]  work, and they didn't know he had already left the airport, and all he did was kiss
[23:15.680 --> 23:22.200]  her, and then they arrested him and blamed him for kicking everybody out, as if he, the
[23:22.200 --> 23:26.880]  object of the photograph, should be responsible that the camera didn't work.
[23:26.880 --> 23:32.040]  This is what happens when we trust our safety to the government.
[23:32.040 --> 23:36.000]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is our guest, he's going to fire out some websites and their
[23:36.000 --> 23:42.520]  key info, and he leaves us coming up here in about seven minutes, but judge, the problem
[23:42.520 --> 23:47.480]  here, and I want to ask you as a constitutional expert, one of the foremost in the world,
[23:47.480 --> 23:53.400]  your strategy for our listeners at the state level or federal level to fight this, Copenhagen
[23:53.400 --> 23:59.760]  fails, and so in Bloomberg and the Associated Press report, literally the UN and Schwarzenegger
[23:59.760 --> 24:05.320]  organizing it with the council of governors and mayors, Austin is coming out with a $2.6
[24:05.320 --> 24:13.080]  million tax in the first three years on all human activity, natural gas, oil, you name
[24:13.080 --> 24:16.440]  it, in violation of state and federal law, they can't have the Senate to pass it, so
[24:16.440 --> 24:18.360]  they're just doing it.
[24:18.360 --> 24:26.080]  We have Obama saying he will now sign the United Nations Small Arms Treaty, which National
[24:26.080 --> 24:31.360]  Gun Rights Blog headline US agrees to timetable for gun ban.
[24:31.360 --> 24:36.800]  So my point is, on every front, he can't get the Senate to say carbon dioxide's a deadly
[24:36.800 --> 24:41.000]  poison, so he says the EPA will just do it, he's taking over the cities, he's coming
[24:41.000 --> 24:46.320]  after our guns through treaty, what do we do to fight this?
[24:46.320 --> 24:52.080]  Well, under the constitution, as you know, and as most people listening to us now know,
[24:52.080 --> 24:57.880]  Alex, a treaty is meaningless until it's enacted by two-thirds of the Senate.
[24:57.880 --> 25:01.800]  I doubt that the president could get two-thirds of the Senate to enact a treaty that would
[25:01.800 --> 25:02.800]  interfere...
[25:02.800 --> 25:04.840]  But then he orders the bureaucracy to do it.
[25:04.840 --> 25:05.840]  Pardon me?
[25:05.840 --> 25:07.720]  But then he just orders the bureaucracy to do it.
[25:07.720 --> 25:13.400]  Well, if he orders the bureaucracy to follow a treaty that has not been enacted, then the
[25:13.400 --> 25:19.120]  first person who is harmed by behavior of a bureaucrat, say it's you or me with a lawful
[25:19.120 --> 25:25.200]  weapon being seized by a federal agent because the bureaucracy is told the agent to do it,
[25:25.200 --> 25:27.440]  he claims he's just doing his job.
[25:27.440 --> 25:33.160]  Then we would have to challenge this in court, and hopefully we would find judges that are
[25:33.160 --> 25:35.240]  faithful to the constitution.
[25:35.240 --> 25:42.400]  But he cannot create law on his own, he wishes he could, and treaties basically create law,
[25:42.400 --> 25:48.240]  which is why, A, they require a two-thirds vote of the constitution, and B, they cannot
[25:48.240 --> 25:53.080]  interfere with any fundamental liberties guaranteed by the constitution.
[25:53.080 --> 25:58.560]  And thanks to a great opinion called Heller, H-E-L-L-E-R, written by Justice Antonin Scalia
[25:58.560 --> 26:04.520]  last year, we now know that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental, read, natural
[26:04.520 --> 26:09.240]  right, like the right to defend yourself in a fight in the streets, and the government
[26:09.240 --> 26:13.360]  can't take that right away, though we know they will try.
[26:13.360 --> 26:16.360]  You've said this more effectively than anybody else on the air.
[26:16.360 --> 26:20.400]  Alex, the first thing that Tyrant does is to disarm the citizenry because they fear
[26:20.400 --> 26:25.440]  more than anything else, an armed citizenry.
[26:25.440 --> 26:30.640]  And I guess you have the states come down on cities that are unconstitutionally going
[26:30.640 --> 26:31.640]  along with this as well.
[26:31.640 --> 26:36.800]  Well, that's not going to happen in New York or in Illinois, where, as you say, New York
[26:36.800 --> 26:41.920]  City and Chicago have virtually banned guns in utter disregard for the Heller decision.
[26:41.920 --> 26:43.880]  They're trying to police other states' cities.
[26:43.880 --> 26:46.240]  Well, they're about to get their comeuppance.
[26:46.240 --> 26:52.480]  I can tell you that it is my opinion that the Supreme Court agreed to hear two cases
[26:52.480 --> 26:56.760]  from a federal appeals court in New York City and from a federal appeals court in Chicago
[26:56.760 --> 27:01.440]  in order to smack them down, and says Heller, and to tell them that Heller is the law, and
[27:01.440 --> 27:06.200]  the Second Amendment not only says the feds can't interfere with your right to keep and
[27:06.200 --> 27:10.520]  bear arms, but no government can interfere with your right to keep and bear arms.
[27:10.520 --> 27:16.120]  Look, Alex, in my opinion, couldn't registration laws are unconstitutional.
[27:16.120 --> 27:20.840]  The government has no more right to know that I own a gun than it does to know that I own
[27:20.840 --> 27:21.840]  a pair of shoes.
[27:21.840 --> 27:22.840]  All right.
[27:22.840 --> 27:23.840]  Moving, moving quickly.
[27:23.840 --> 27:24.840]  Absolutely.
[27:24.840 --> 27:28.640]  I have a question here from one of our Twitter people that says, is nullification a workable
[27:28.640 --> 27:32.520]  solution for the overreaching Fed or will it take secession?
[27:32.520 --> 27:38.800]  I think it will take nullification by a good number of states before the feds, the federal
[27:38.800 --> 27:39.960]  government takes note of it.
[27:39.960 --> 27:45.120]  A single state nullifies the federal government, like Virginia is on the verge of enacting
[27:45.120 --> 27:50.880]  a statute, which would make it a crime in Virginia to follow federal health care law.
[27:50.880 --> 27:54.520]  That, of course, will create a conflict between state and federal.
[27:54.520 --> 27:57.320]  A federal judge will probably rule for the feds.
[27:57.320 --> 28:03.000]  But if many, many other states did the same thing, the Congress would fear that that many
[28:03.000 --> 28:06.400]  states could gang up on it in a constitutional way.
[28:06.400 --> 28:11.040]  And we are on that road, so you agree with many listeners that one of the key battlegrounds
[28:11.040 --> 28:16.000]  is getting our states back, that's the Achilles heel of this globalist system.
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  Absolutely.
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  Okay.
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.000]  We've only got a minute and a half left.
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.400]  Where do you see America going?
[28:20.400 --> 28:25.280]  We know the Republicans, people like Brown, getting in Massachusetts, it's a good message
[28:25.280 --> 28:27.120]  to Obama to back off.
[28:27.120 --> 28:33.120]  The problem is these Republicans are just as bad once they get in, but it took eight
[28:33.120 --> 28:35.200]  years to wake up to Bush or seven years.
[28:35.200 --> 28:37.240]  It took a year to wake up to Obama.
[28:37.240 --> 28:40.920]  The system knows the people aren't putting up with the bait and switch.
[28:40.920 --> 28:45.080]  What happens when Republicans get in and continue to sell us out to the foreign banks?
[28:45.080 --> 28:46.080]  Do we go into revolution?
[28:46.080 --> 28:50.960]  I don't think we go into revolution, but I have spoken to enough tea parties to know
[28:50.960 --> 28:56.240]  that they are about 90% filled with freedom lovers who reject the Republican party as
[28:56.240 --> 28:58.480]  much as they do the Democratic party.
[28:58.480 --> 28:59.480]  Amen.
[28:59.480 --> 29:02.400]  It is that type of rejection that will save us.
[29:02.400 --> 29:04.000]  That's the only thing we can do peacefully.
[29:04.000 --> 29:10.080]  Well, I'm for a peaceful revolution of info war, calling into talk radio, websites, banner
[29:10.080 --> 29:11.080]  things.
[29:11.080 --> 29:12.080]  We are the majority.
[29:12.080 --> 29:16.000]  If we just don't shut up and we have natural law and truth on our side, there's no way
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.920]  these criminals in government can get away with it.
[29:18.920 --> 29:20.680]  I agree with you.
[29:20.680 --> 29:24.320]  And you, my friend, are doing more than anybody I know.
[29:24.320 --> 29:29.120]  I'm trying to keep up with you to educate the public in the dangers of too much government.
[29:29.120 --> 29:30.120]  And guess what?
[29:30.120 --> 29:31.840]  The message is getting through a while.
[29:31.840 --> 29:32.840]  God bless you.
[29:32.840 --> 29:34.520]  I look forward to having you in studio in the near future.
[29:34.520 --> 29:36.960]  Judge, give us your website.
[29:36.960 --> 29:40.240]  Judgedap.com is the best way to find all my stuff.
[29:40.240 --> 29:41.240]  All right.
[29:41.240 --> 29:42.240]  Thank you so much.
[29:42.240 --> 29:43.240]  We'll talk to you soon.
[29:43.240 --> 29:44.240]  God bless you.
[29:44.240 --> 29:45.240]  God bless you.
[29:45.240 --> 29:46.240]  Take care.
[29:46.240 --> 29:47.240]  My websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[29:47.240 --> 29:48.240]  Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[29:48.240 --> 30:00.320]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.320 --> 30:04.960]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[30:04.960 --> 30:09.320]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[30:09.320 --> 30:13.640]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[30:13.640 --> 30:14.960]  allows you to have.
[30:14.960 --> 30:15.960]  It's true.
[30:15.960 --> 30:20.680]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[30:20.680 --> 30:25.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[30:25.000 --> 30:29.000]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[30:29.000 --> 30:32.520]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[30:32.520 --> 30:36.200]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[30:36.200 --> 30:40.960]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[30:40.960 --> 30:44.720]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science.
[30:44.720 --> 30:46.120]  One of my oldest sponsors.
[30:46.120 --> 30:50.360]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[30:50.360 --> 30:51.920]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[30:51.920 --> 31:02.360]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[31:02.360 --> 31:06.240]  Grids of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[31:06.240 --> 31:09.400]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[31:09.400 --> 31:13.760]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[31:13.760 --> 31:14.760]  at home.
[31:14.760 --> 31:19.920]  I have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the
[31:19.920 --> 31:20.920]  shots.
[31:20.920 --> 31:25.680]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[31:25.680 --> 31:31.200]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[31:31.200 --> 31:35.800]  bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[31:35.800 --> 31:38.280]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[31:38.280 --> 31:42.280]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[31:42.280 --> 31:48.360]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[31:48.360 --> 31:49.360]  of the Republic.
[31:49.360 --> 31:54.520]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[31:54.520 --> 32:07.200]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at PrismPlanet.tv.
[32:07.200 --> 32:15.080]  Aerial spring, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens
[32:15.080 --> 32:18.960]  and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[32:18.960 --> 32:22.000]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[32:22.000 --> 32:31.760]  Get detoxified with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[32:31.760 --> 32:36.760]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[32:36.760 --> 32:40.520]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[32:40.520 --> 32:44.280]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[32:44.280 --> 32:49.600]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long term storage.
[32:49.600 --> 32:56.600]  Hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today.
[33:19.600 --> 33:27.160]  From France at the EU, we went back from France to Germany today, he's back in Germany today.
[33:27.160 --> 33:33.760]  He's the head of health at the Council of Europe, the head of the 40 plus member board
[33:33.760 --> 33:39.520]  representing the nations, calling for criminal investigations.
[33:39.520 --> 33:43.160]  International hearings began on falsified swine flu pandemic, that's the article from
[33:43.160 --> 33:47.640]  a week ago.
[33:47.640 --> 33:53.360]  And now they've had the hearings, the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, a 47 nation
[33:53.360 --> 33:59.000]  body encompassing democratic elected members of the parliament has begun hearings to investigate
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.360]  whether the H1N1 swine flu pandemic was falsified or exaggerated attempt to profit for vaccine
[34:04.360 --> 34:05.800]  makers.
[34:05.800 --> 34:15.600]  And writing in one of the reports is Wolfgang Wodarg in order, this is quoting, to promote
[34:15.600 --> 34:21.060]  their patented drugs and vaccines against flu pharmacological companies, influenced
[34:21.060 --> 34:25.520]  scientists and official agencies responsible for public health standards to alarm governments
[34:25.520 --> 34:31.120]  worldwide and make them squander tight health resources for inefficient vaccine strategies
[34:31.120 --> 34:39.000]  and legally expose millions of healthy people to risk of an unknown amount of side effects
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.040]  of insufficiently tested vaccines.
[34:41.040 --> 34:47.120]  The bird flu campaign of 2006 combined with the swine flu campaign to have seemed to have
[34:47.120 --> 34:51.240]  caused a great deal of damage, not only to some vaccinated patients and the public health
[34:51.240 --> 34:56.960]  budgets, but to the credibility and accountability of important international health agencies,
[34:56.960 --> 34:59.440]  wrote Dr. Wodarg.
[34:59.440 --> 35:05.440]  So he is joining us, ladies and gentlemen, who's scientist swine flu pandemic was completely
[35:05.440 --> 35:06.520]  exaggerated.
[35:06.520 --> 35:11.240]  Another info wars.net headline, Steve Watson, international inquiry hears evidence, base
[35:11.240 --> 35:15.000]  was weak and charges of collusion with drug companies.
[35:15.000 --> 35:22.200]  That is coming up with Wolfgang Wodarg later in the broadcast and Ricky Ross will send
[35:22.200 --> 35:27.080]  us to life imprisonment after being convicted of trying to purchase more than 100 kilograms
[35:27.080 --> 35:29.080]  of cocaine from a federal agent.
[35:29.080 --> 35:34.600]  He's one of the biggest CIA contracted drug dealers in history and got set up by them
[35:34.600 --> 35:35.600]  when they were done with him.
[35:35.600 --> 35:39.760]  And of course, that was in Gary Webb's Pulitzer Prize winning report for the San Jose Mercury
[35:39.760 --> 35:40.760]  news.
[35:40.760 --> 35:41.760]  They killed him.
[35:41.760 --> 35:46.240]  He was writing another book that vindicated everything they'd reported and the Dr. Doug
[35:46.240 --> 35:50.040]  Rocky depleted uranium expert in the last hour today.
[35:50.040 --> 35:53.080]  You definitely don't want to miss any of this during the break.
[35:53.080 --> 35:55.360]  I was talking to Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[35:55.360 --> 35:59.800]  He did not know about Detroit news and the State Department saying, yes, we ordered them
[35:59.800 --> 36:03.760]  to let this guy get on the plane because we were tracking Al Qaeda.
[36:03.760 --> 36:05.240]  Oh, they're always tracking them.
[36:05.240 --> 36:10.520]  Oh, we ordered the State Department to let Mohammed Atta and others in, in 2000.
[36:10.520 --> 36:16.320]  Well, we got Springman on the head of the visa section of the embassy next week.
[36:16.320 --> 36:20.200]  They ordered him to let them in saying, oh, well, their Al Qaeda designation is a CIA
[36:20.200 --> 36:21.200]  cover.
[36:21.200 --> 36:23.480]  It's always the same.
[36:23.480 --> 36:25.320]  And then who gets to lose their freedoms?
[36:25.320 --> 36:27.280]  Who gets targeted by all this police state?
[36:27.280 --> 36:28.520]  You and I.
[36:28.520 --> 36:39.880]  That's who gets targeted by it, ladies and gentlemen, we cover such a wide range of incredibly
[36:39.880 --> 36:48.760]  important issues and dynamic stories that are constantly changing and evolving that routinely
[36:48.760 --> 36:54.400]  I will cover a bombshell issue, but it just gets mixed in with all the other incredibly
[36:54.400 --> 36:59.120]  important issues, though it's even more important.
[36:59.120 --> 37:05.520]  And the fact is, if you study politics and you study the geopolitical strategies used
[37:05.520 --> 37:10.920]  by the Anglo-American establishment, and that means that doesn't mean white people, people
[37:10.920 --> 37:16.360]  always get emails saying, why are you saying Anglos are bad that it's a geographic designation
[37:16.360 --> 37:19.680]  in a geopolitical system.
[37:19.680 --> 37:23.280]  England and the U.S. are known as the Anglo-American power axis.
[37:23.280 --> 37:29.960]  Okay, I'm talking about these rich nations run by the bankers, okay?
[37:29.960 --> 37:32.640]  And we know what their strategies are in the past.
[37:32.640 --> 37:40.680]  We know what their current strategies are, and we know what they are currently doing.
[37:40.680 --> 37:47.400]  They are openly and publicly on a monthly basis bare minimum.
[37:47.400 --> 37:49.480]  More often than that, I miss most of it.
[37:49.480 --> 37:52.800]  There's no way to keep track of all this, ladies and gentlemen.
[37:52.800 --> 37:57.840]  openly saying they want to enslave the people of Europe, England and the U.S. that they
[37:57.840 --> 38:02.960]  use terror as a pretext to enslave us their milk cows.
[38:02.960 --> 38:04.800]  We are the target.
[38:04.800 --> 38:10.480]  They openly state they want to launch new wars to expand their empire and to distract
[38:10.480 --> 38:17.960]  the public from the trillions they've stolen, from the banker bailout robbery, from all
[38:17.960 --> 38:21.080]  the crimes being committed.
[38:21.080 --> 38:25.880]  The public is now learning about all these secretive private trust that the trillions
[38:25.880 --> 38:32.240]  were put through by Geithner, Bernanke, Paulson and others, and it's all illegal on its face.
[38:32.240 --> 38:34.000]  That's in my stack.
[38:34.000 --> 38:40.520]  Giving themselves waivers to give themselves hundreds of millions of dollars apiece is
[38:40.520 --> 38:43.240]  absolutely illegal.
[38:43.240 --> 38:52.800]  Being the Federal Reserve ordering the Federal controllers of AIG when the government took
[38:52.800 --> 38:58.720]  it over to not file and to not tell the public or the media who AIG was giving the money
[38:58.720 --> 39:04.120]  to is illegal on its face.
[39:04.120 --> 39:05.520]  And then the debate starts up.
[39:05.520 --> 39:07.600]  Well, did Geithner know and then it comes out.
[39:07.600 --> 39:12.360]  Yes, he indeed did know in the emails as the New York Fed that his lawyers were ordering
[39:12.360 --> 39:19.560]  the Federal regulators to do this, which is backwards to have the private Fed telling
[39:19.560 --> 39:20.560]  them what to do.
[39:20.560 --> 39:22.000]  But that's how it's set up.
[39:22.000 --> 39:23.000]  Okay.
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.160]  Why aren't the lawyers that wrote the emails under Geithner being indicted?
[39:27.160 --> 39:32.640]  You know, they'll roll over and expose Geithner that happens, but we don't need them to roll
[39:32.640 --> 39:33.640]  over.
[39:33.640 --> 39:36.520]  Geithner's been on TV more times than I can even keep track of.
[39:36.520 --> 39:39.320]  You've all seen him saying, we won't tell you where the money went.
[39:39.320 --> 39:42.080]  It's our policy to make it secret.
[39:42.080 --> 39:44.600]  So it's a lie out in the open.
[39:44.600 --> 39:46.280]  So what are they going to do?
[39:46.280 --> 39:48.480]  Well, I'm going to tell you what they're going to do.
[39:48.480 --> 39:52.280]  They're going to launch new wars and they are going to stage terror attacks.
[39:52.280 --> 39:55.240]  And there's no doubt the underwear bomber was that that's been proven without a shadow
[39:55.240 --> 39:58.800]  of a doubt.
[39:58.800 --> 40:01.760]  There is no doubt.
[40:01.760 --> 40:03.920]  And now I just put Napolitano onto it.
[40:03.920 --> 40:05.320]  I'm sure it'll be covering the next few days.
[40:05.320 --> 40:08.680]  He was unaware of the fact of the State Department even admits that, oh, well, we let him get
[40:08.680 --> 40:09.680]  on the plane.
[40:09.680 --> 40:14.120]  And yeah, we lied about the second man on board the plane and the bond that was supposedly
[40:14.120 --> 40:15.120]  found.
[40:15.120 --> 40:17.320]  And we lied about Haskell and now he's been proven right.
[40:17.320 --> 40:23.600]  And yeah, somebody was videotaping him.
[40:23.600 --> 40:31.000]  They are clearly playing the terror card and the war card right now.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.720]  What are we going to do about this?
[40:33.720 --> 40:39.000]  We had better get the word out on this at the grassroots now.
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.520]  This is the number one issue.
[40:40.520 --> 40:45.640]  Just like I told you, we need to target all firepower on the Copenhagen fraud and the
[40:45.640 --> 40:49.000]  climate gate, knowing that would then blow up sky high.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.240]  And there's no need to spend all our time on that now because new scandals, two new
[40:54.240 --> 40:57.280]  scandals came out today, dwarfing climate gate emails.
[40:57.280 --> 41:03.800]  I mean, it's just it's like bombing an aircraft carrier and hitting the magazine where all
[41:03.800 --> 41:07.720]  the munitions are, you just better get get back.
[41:07.720 --> 41:15.000]  We don't need to pump any more rounds into that dead horse at the international level,
[41:15.000 --> 41:20.840]  at least until later this year when they try again and what's seven, eight months in Mexico
[41:20.840 --> 41:21.840]  city.
[41:21.840 --> 41:24.760]  Now it's the local fight.
[41:24.760 --> 41:30.440]  But see on the flu fraud, on the banker takeover fraud, on the new war they want with Iran
[41:30.440 --> 41:37.680]  and Yemen and Pakistan, all of their frauds, their healthcare fraud, their new bankers,
[41:37.680 --> 41:42.560]  the banker robbery that they call a jobs bill and congressmen are on record saying it's
[41:42.560 --> 41:47.000]  not a jobs bill, it's another banker bailout, which isn't a bailout.
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.560]  It's lies within lies within lies within lies within hoaxes within frauds within spin within
[41:51.560 --> 41:55.200]  scams within more lies.
[41:55.200 --> 42:01.880]  Their entire agenda is in flames right now.
[42:01.880 --> 42:07.960]  If this is allowed to continue, the new world order is crippled.
[42:07.960 --> 42:08.960]  They're hurt right now.
[42:08.960 --> 42:12.520]  It's kind of like they got gang green in one of their legs.
[42:12.520 --> 42:18.400]  And if they don't stage a terror attack, which is basically the penicillin and save that
[42:18.400 --> 42:22.720]  leg, they're going to have to cut it off and be seriously crippled.
[42:22.720 --> 42:24.320]  It may even kill them.
[42:24.320 --> 42:26.600]  It may politically rock their whole body.
[42:26.600 --> 42:28.200]  It could even be too late.
[42:28.200 --> 42:34.280]  But people have this foregone conclusion that freedom can't win and that liberty is impossible.
[42:34.280 --> 42:38.600]  No, that's a, that's mind control.
[42:38.600 --> 42:41.780]  That's a foregone conclusion and planted in your brain.
[42:41.780 --> 42:44.600]  And why am I the number one person fighting the new world order?
[42:44.600 --> 42:49.360]  As you heard Napolitano say earlier, the number one person, because I understand history and
[42:49.360 --> 42:50.960]  we can win.
[42:50.960 --> 42:55.120]  And that's why I'm the number one target of Cointel, protest info, hoaxes, propaganda
[42:55.120 --> 42:57.120]  lies.
[42:57.120 --> 43:01.600]  So anytime you see me being attacked, you better research it fully because you're always
[43:01.600 --> 43:06.080]  going to find out it's a liar of fraud or you will hear me come out and say I was wrong,
[43:06.080 --> 43:13.360]  which is very rare.
[43:13.360 --> 43:16.360]  I can't spend my time responding to lies.
[43:16.360 --> 43:21.600]  I can't spend my time when Dean Haglin here is a great guy and says, Oh, you're, you're,
[43:21.600 --> 43:23.800]  you're owned by ABC, aren't you?
[43:23.800 --> 43:30.360]  You're just a total lie, but I can't spend my time countering it.
[43:30.360 --> 43:32.480]  And if I do, it doesn't matter.
[43:32.480 --> 43:38.240]  So regardless folks, you need to take action against tyranny and not be distracted by the
[43:38.240 --> 43:44.480]  continued sustained organized attacks on myself.
[43:44.480 --> 43:46.240]  I am not a Scientologist.
[43:46.240 --> 43:49.160]  I am not nothing wrong with it, but I'm not Catholic.
[43:49.160 --> 43:50.160]  I'm not Jewish.
[43:50.160 --> 43:57.080]  There's nothing wrong with that, but I'm not.
[43:57.080 --> 44:00.320]  We are not owned by ABC.
[44:00.320 --> 44:03.560]  We have at least three different satellites over the years.
[44:03.560 --> 44:09.200]  That's what anybody on talk radio, if you try to go start a show about dirt buggy racing
[44:09.200 --> 44:12.560]  around the country and you want to syndicate it, there's one way to do it.
[44:12.560 --> 44:17.680]  And that's to rent a Jones, a clear channel or an ABC and it's not even ABC now.
[44:17.680 --> 44:20.480]  It's something else.
[44:20.480 --> 44:25.360]  The point is that's how this info works.
[44:25.360 --> 44:30.080]  But let's just say this is an ABC radio show.
[44:30.080 --> 44:31.080]  It's not.
[44:31.080 --> 44:32.080]  Okay.
[44:32.080 --> 44:35.320]  What are you going to do about the fact they want to stage new terror attacks and go to
[44:35.320 --> 44:36.320]  war with Iran?
[44:36.320 --> 44:42.680]  What are you going to do about them taking over your cities to implement around Congress?
[44:42.680 --> 44:44.280]  The carbon tax.
[44:44.280 --> 44:48.080]  What are you going to do about joblessness rates exploding?
[44:48.080 --> 44:51.920]  What are you going to do about them attempting to have forced inoculations around the country?
[44:51.920 --> 44:57.040]  You better fight it and stand up and go against it.
[44:57.040 --> 45:01.320]  Because we've got a chance of winning, ladies and gentlemen, but it's not just me that gets
[45:01.320 --> 45:02.320]  attacked.
[45:02.320 --> 45:08.360]  It's anybody who's real and who effectively is actually exposing the system and hurting
[45:08.360 --> 45:13.400]  it is going to have hit pieces written about them from above and below from the fake grassroots
[45:13.400 --> 45:15.000]  right up to the top.
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  That's the badge of honor.
[45:17.000 --> 45:24.400]  That's the signature, the battle wounds on my war helmet and on my breastplate.
[45:24.400 --> 45:29.680]  The fact that I've got a dented war helmet on and the fact that my sword has got notches
[45:29.680 --> 45:39.920]  in it and is more of a club these days is the signature of the bonafide because they
[45:39.920 --> 45:43.600]  don't want you to know there's real patriots or real heroes.
[45:43.600 --> 45:48.160]  They don't want you to know because you will then envision yourself as that and you will
[45:48.160 --> 45:53.640]  become the leaders that you were meant to be.
[45:53.640 --> 46:02.840]  So I will tell you all right here today that if you commit to the fight against tyranny
[46:02.840 --> 46:09.500]  and take action, we will defeat these people, but I will tell you here today without a shadow
[46:09.500 --> 46:17.960]  of a doubt, just as I told you six months before, two months before, a week before and
[46:17.960 --> 46:21.840]  on the day of 9-11 that they were going to stage an attack on the World Trade Center
[46:21.840 --> 46:25.800]  and blame it on their CIS said Osama bin Laden.
[46:25.800 --> 46:31.280]  I have only issued two separate alerts after this when they were clearly in the preparatory
[46:31.280 --> 46:41.480]  phase getting the public ready for stage terror attacks 2004 and 2007.
[46:41.480 --> 46:46.680]  Remember when Cheney told US News and World Report, a US city will be nuked.
[46:46.680 --> 46:50.600]  They had Tommy Franks on the payroll running around saying one more attack.
[46:50.600 --> 46:54.680]  We get a military dictatorship to keep you safe and I told you that was a government
[46:54.680 --> 46:56.760]  paid for op and it came out.
[46:56.760 --> 46:58.680]  He was on the payroll to say that.
[46:58.680 --> 47:05.960]  They are trying to prepare you, but because we got the word out and because 9-11 truth
[47:05.960 --> 47:12.000]  wounded the dragon and exposed false flag terror and the false flag paradigm and the
[47:12.000 --> 47:20.160]  inside job self-inflicted wound, Reichstag paradigm, the fake terror stage terror paradigm
[47:20.160 --> 47:30.400]  because you got the word out because we are changed and 9-11 truth took the heat and went
[47:30.400 --> 47:34.120]  up against the Cointel Pro and because I went up against them.
[47:34.120 --> 47:38.920]  Now the general public knows about it and it's very hard for the enemy to do it, but
[47:38.920 --> 47:42.440]  all their major pundits are saying we need a new crisis.
[47:42.440 --> 47:49.640]  We need a new war and the terror is a common and the CIA says it's going to happen.
[47:49.640 --> 48:00.320]  They say we're going to be hit within three to six months and I'm going to be breaking
[48:00.320 --> 48:04.420]  this down in the next segment.
[48:04.420 --> 48:08.920]  Remember all the Cointel Pro that we are changed New York went through.
[48:08.920 --> 48:12.240]  Every time they went to public events they got arrested on the street.
[48:12.240 --> 48:14.480]  They got arrested going to press conferences.
[48:14.480 --> 48:17.680]  We had to raise money for Luke, send them more cameras.
[48:17.680 --> 48:22.640]  Remember Jeremy Tallis, that's his official name, German Tallis is his nickname.
[48:22.640 --> 48:31.440]  Out of a dark corner outside a bookstore where Laura Bush was speaking, a man comes running
[48:31.440 --> 48:36.560]  out with a little girl on a wheelchair and begins ramming and into him screaming, don't
[48:36.560 --> 48:39.320]  attack my daughter, don't attack my daughter.
[48:39.320 --> 48:47.160]  I went on air and I defended Tallis, I defended Luke, I exposed that was a fraud.
[48:47.160 --> 48:52.840]  Two my listeners raised them the money for the lawyer part of it and they went to court
[48:52.840 --> 48:56.880]  even though he was facing a decade in prison under fake charges and made it come out on
[48:56.880 --> 49:02.840]  stand and the Secret Service had met that they actually attacked him and boy did I get a
[49:02.840 --> 49:03.840]  lot of heat.
[49:03.840 --> 49:09.560]  Alex, you're sticking up for somebody who attacked a girl in a wheelchair and a lot
[49:09.560 --> 49:13.760]  of patriots bought the Psyop ladies and gentlemen and there's so many other examples of this
[49:13.760 --> 49:21.400]  but in the end the New York Post had to print a full retraction, it was all a hoax.
[49:21.400 --> 49:27.840]  They're masters of deception, they're masters of like Michelle Malcolm sitting behind me
[49:27.840 --> 49:33.480]  screaming kill Michelle Malcolm and saying I had said that but the truth came out and
[49:33.480 --> 49:38.680]  the truth comes out when I go to events when mentally ill people are provocateurs or whatever
[49:38.680 --> 49:44.520]  run up and stage a distraction and then blame me for what they've done that comes out in
[49:44.520 --> 49:53.680]  the end because the truth always comes out.
[49:53.680 --> 50:00.520]  The truth is incontrovertible and God is on our side and we are winning and no matter
[50:00.520 --> 50:08.720]  whatever happens to Alex Jones as we go into stormier and stormier waters the truth has
[50:08.720 --> 50:15.520]  been laid the track has been laid it's out there and the people are discovering it and
[50:15.520 --> 50:21.280]  we know their strategy and they are green lighting stage terror attacks right now and
[50:21.280 --> 50:26.240]  if we get the word out about the underwear bomber about the Gulf of talking about all
[50:26.240 --> 50:31.760]  these other events when they stage it it is going to blow up in their face and it won't
[50:31.760 --> 50:36.040]  take three or four years to expose it like 9-11 did.
[50:36.040 --> 50:45.520]  It's going to happen very very quickly.
[50:45.520 --> 50:49.480]  I'm going to come back and break down the details of this on the other side but realize
[50:49.480 --> 50:54.360]  the national media attacks 9-11 truth is the number one enemy because we are their enemy
[50:54.360 --> 50:59.120]  we have exposed their favorite trick and they absolutely hate us and they've got their operatives
[50:59.120 --> 51:01.760]  crawling all over us.
[51:01.760 --> 51:06.560]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high
[51:06.560 --> 51:08.600]  energy and vibrant health?
[51:08.600 --> 51:13.400]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen
[51:13.400 --> 51:18.680]  content of your body disease organisms like bacteria viruses and cancer cannot survive
[51:18.680 --> 51:21.520]  in an alkaline high pH environment.
[51:21.520 --> 51:26.640]  Alchovision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[51:26.640 --> 51:31.520]  Using alchovision pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get
[51:31.520 --> 51:34.880]  rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[51:34.880 --> 51:39.440]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[51:39.440 --> 51:44.000]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.

[52:02.560 --> 52:06.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[52:06.320 --> 52:09.440]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[52:09.440 --> 52:13.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[52:13.800 --> 52:14.800]  at home.
[52:14.800 --> 52:19.960]  We've turned an endless influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[52:19.960 --> 52:20.960]  shots.
[52:20.960 --> 52:26.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the republic
[52:26.760 --> 52:29.080]  identifies the enemies of our nation.
[52:29.080 --> 52:34.920]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[52:34.920 --> 52:35.920]  world government.
[52:35.920 --> 52:40.400]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[52:40.400 --> 52:44.280]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care.
[52:44.280 --> 52:49.680]  And right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the republic.

[1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:31.760]  is our guest for at least the next 30 minutes a very busy individual we are honored to have
[1:00:31.760 --> 1:00:38.960]  him this is a major newsmaking interview he is the head of health of the council of Europe
[1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:46.280]  and we have the 47 nation body now investigating falsified swine flu pandemic health ministers
[1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:51.000]  and officials being on the payroll worldwide in different countries to push the fear the
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:55.480]  dangerous nature of the vaccine all the deaths that were caused in the trials a few years
[1:00:55.480 --> 1:01:00.560]  ago of the bird flu he's investigating and all we salute him they've been having their
[1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:06.800]  investigation the last few weeks so here to break it down for us is Dr. Wolfgang Wodark
[1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:11.880]  and sir we really appreciate you coming on with us today thank you that I can be with
[1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:18.960]  you today again tell us about this basically about the health council of Europe why you
[1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:25.640]  started your investigation what your investigation is finding if I'm a physician myself and I
[1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:30.760]  was director for many years of a public health institution north in Germany observing the
[1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:38.840]  flu waves coming every year and as my region has about 120,000 inhabitants I used to count
[1:01:38.840 --> 1:01:45.480]  about 10% of the population getting ill with the flu and something or symptoms of a flu
[1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:52.160]  almost every year so when I observed this what we heard last April about Mexico City
[1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:58.400]  a region with 20 million people I was very much astonished that there were only thousand
[1:01:58.400 --> 1:02:03.280]  cases when somebody already spoke about pandemic I didn't understand that because in my small
[1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:09.200]  town we had more busy more people getting ill within one or two weeks from from the
[1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:14.160]  influencer to when there was an influencer and so I started investigating and I found
[1:02:14.160 --> 1:02:20.560]  out that this was due to a change of definition WHO had changed the definition what a pandemic
[1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:26.600]  is me as a public health doctor I learned that the pandemic is something spreading
[1:02:26.600 --> 1:02:33.800]  very fast but as the flu always spreads every year very fast or as fast as the planes fly
[1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:39.520]  so this was nothing new and a pandemic which is really worthwhile an alarm or an alert
[1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:44.440]  reaction of the people of this world this is a pandemic which has serious diseases which
[1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:51.200]  goes along with very high mortality with many deaths and so when I heard about the Mexican
[1:02:51.200 --> 1:02:56.160]  cases I was curious why they did this because they didn't give any sense there was nothing
[1:02:56.160 --> 1:03:01.480]  extraordinary there were mild cases it was not even a new virus this was obvious very
[1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:06.840]  soon because elder people didn't get ill people older than 60 almost didn't get ill and this
[1:03:06.840 --> 1:03:11.600]  is a very clear indication for that they have already been vaccinated with a similar virus
[1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:17.720]  or that they have been infected with a similar virus some years ago or many years ago so
[1:03:17.720 --> 1:03:25.360]  this is so I didn't understand why this happened and now you've had a chance to begin your
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:31.760]  investigation when when did the council start looking at this yeah the council decided in
[1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:37.240]  the middle of last of December on the 11th of December in last year there was a session
[1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:46.240]  in the committee of social affairs and health in Paris and we had an anonymous decision
[1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:51.720]  that we want an urgent debate on the topic because we wanted to reinstall trust in the
[1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:59.440]  WHO because the many the population in Europe is very much astonished about this agency
[1:03:59.440 --> 1:04:06.040]  because they just they advised us twice now or at least twice and they told us there's
[1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:10.640]  be a big threat for health it was the birds flew where they said thousands of people
[1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:18.000]  may be dead and they said it now the same way with a with a swan flu so we want to reinstall
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:24.560]  health in this we want to reinstall trust in this WHO and this is why we wanted an urgent
[1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:29.720]  debate and we are 47 countries and in this parliamentary assembly of the council of Europe
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:34.880]  you have all the parliamentarians you have the national parliamentarians from 47 countries
[1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:39.640]  you have the opposition parliamentarians you have the governing parties there so if you
[1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:46.760]  transport a topic to this platform you can be sure that there is a discussion 47 times
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:51.920]  in the different nations okay doctor doctor not to interrupt but we have to break doctor
[1:04:51.920 --> 1:04:56.720]  wolfgang woe dark is our guest he's the head of the health council of Europe we're going
[1:04:56.720 --> 1:05:03.040]  to break down what they found and it's incredible on the other side hundreds of nations have
[1:05:03.040 --> 1:05:09.080]  fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history
[1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:13.520]  as we're finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:19.160]  at home and have tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really are
[1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:25.480]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[1:05:25.480 --> 1:05:30.960]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:35.760]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim
[1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:40.800]  Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying
[1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:45.360]  who do we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington

[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:11.640]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg
[1:08:11.640 --> 1:08:17.280]  has been the head of health for the council of Europe until late last month now he rotated
[1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:21.520]  off that post it's still an honorary member of it now he's a private citizen medical doctor
[1:08:21.520 --> 1:08:25.600]  who can now speak about this they've been investigating it since last year they've
[1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:31.080]  now started the formal investigation from a week and a half ago and we have the quotes
[1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:39.320]  here from the resolution about big pharma pushing this most the White House here the
[1:08:39.320 --> 1:08:44.240]  scientific experts on the payroll they talk about it being a dangerous vaccine the German
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:48.880]  government wouldn't take it wouldn't give it to the troops our media lied and said
[1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:54.400]  there wasn't mercury in it and of course it killed a fraction of those with a regular
[1:08:54.400 --> 1:08:59.360]  flu does so so that's what they're looking at so in that first segment doctor we got
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:05.040]  up to the point of the formal investigation starting what did you guys hear in testimony
[1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:10.440]  in the last few weeks and then break down personally some of the statements you've
[1:09:10.440 --> 1:09:16.440]  made the research of what this appears to be we had the WHO was president of the first
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:20.560]  petition and there will be a report which will be finished in June and there will be
[1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:26.080]  recommendations for our member governments how to handle this problem in future because
[1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:31.640]  we have seen that the government's head to order ordered a lot of vaccines and they
[1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:35.400]  were obliged they made marketing commitments with pharmaceutical companies because they
[1:09:35.400 --> 1:09:40.320]  were threatened by specialists by scientists that there could be something very dangerous
[1:09:40.320 --> 1:09:45.200]  coming and so they just made those contracts and within those contracts which was secret
[1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:50.080]  which we could not see as parliamentarians there was written that the WHO was at the
[1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:54.720]  trigger to say this is a pandemic and if they say it then the whole business was on and
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:10:01.200]  they had to take the vaccines for pandemic use and this were about 18 billion dollars
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:07.600]  worldwide value and this is a lot of money in health so we we were wondering because
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:14.120]  of this mild flu how such such an enormous waste of money could happen and how millions
[1:10:14.120 --> 1:10:19.640]  of people could have been vaccinated parallelly to the seasonal vaccination so it's a double
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:27.120]  vaccination without any scientific evidence to do so and there was there is Poland for
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:32.320]  instance where the health minister she's experienced in public health as she said no we don't buy
[1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:36.560]  this vaccine and the Polish now are very well off they are not vaccinated they didn't spend
[1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:41.280]  the money and in other nations the people didn't trust the French for instance they bought
[1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:46.760]  for 90% of the population they bought vaccines and only 6% took the vaccines it's similar
[1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:52.480]  in Germany and nevertheless people are well off this was the mildest flu ever and the
[1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:56.480]  people were much clever much more clever than the government so we have to find out what
[1:10:56.480 --> 1:11:01.800]  was going on with WHO why did they do this pandemic alarm and we found out that there
[1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:07.120]  is a public-private partnership within WHO which developed the last 10 years and which
[1:11:07.120 --> 1:11:12.000]  the very powerful pharmaceutical companies seemed to have used quite well for them for
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:19.280]  their purpose for their shareholders because the decisions there were the reason why they
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:24.840]  now earn so much money with this vaccine and we don't know what really happened we only
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:30.080]  know that they changed the definition of pandemic which was a very dangerous thing before and
[1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:36.040]  now it's just a normal flu is called a pandemic and this is the reason why the business pharmaceutical
[1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:43.240]  companies was open well doctor looking at this and again we're talking to the former
[1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:50.600]  head he just left his post a regular rotation off of it last month as the head of the health
[1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:56.040]  council of Europe specific I still go on cooperating with my colleague and working on this matter
[1:11:56.040 --> 1:12:02.160]  very intensive so you're still part of it the my point is this so out of the gates and
[1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:09.160]  we notice this they changed the definition of a pandemic so because they knew that it
[1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:15.360]  was very mild and wasn't a pandemic by the old measurement not even near so out of the
[1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:22.360]  gates we know that that is fraud and then in the reports I've been reading the council
[1:12:22.360 --> 1:12:28.320]  and yourself have been talking about that the vaccine wasn't properly tested was approved
[1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:33.840]  without testing thanks to government's declarations of emergency that's why they went with the
[1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:40.000]  pandemic designation correct it's true because if you if the if the pharmaceutical companies
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:44.080]  wanted to have a real business they would they have a monopole on the vaccines and this
[1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:50.200]  is what they tried by using new vaccines using at events using new technologies to to breed
[1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:57.320]  the virus for the vaccine and this work patented method so they could monopolize it and tell
[1:12:57.320 --> 1:13:04.360]  the government that this was a pandemic vaccine a special one which they can produce more quickly
[1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:11.160]  than normally and this is what they made the contract and so this is the trick how the
[1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:22.240]  big pharmaceutical companies had this marketing commitment normally normally you can if you
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:26.800]  have the virus which is to come you make a mixture of certain viruses you expect to come
[1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:31.560]  and there are so many facilities all over the world which would be able to produce non
[1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:38.960]  patented vaccines everywhere very fast and very much adapt to the epidemiological situation
[1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:45.120]  but when you do this with a monopole when you have such a small passage only and and
[1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:51.720]  everything has to go through those few enterprises it is not faster it's not quicker and I think
[1:13:51.720 --> 1:13:56.680]  it is just the wrong pandemic plans we do we should have no patents on vaccines this
[1:13:56.680 --> 1:14:00.920]  is what we think politically the council of Europe already had a decision on this we said
[1:14:00.920 --> 1:14:07.960]  there should be no patents no monopoles possible on life saving vaccines because doctor doesn't
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:13.440]  that also incentivize the big pharma to engage in hype and hoaxes and fraud because it is
[1:14:13.440 --> 1:14:20.480]  a monetary driver yes I think it is it is their trick that they always try to monopolize
[1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:27.600]  this and we pay much more like this if we would pay the scientists to find out the best the
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:33.360]  best vaccines and develop the best vaccine and let this do without patents and let them
[1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:38.960]  be copied all over the world very fast the taxpayer would be much better off and it would
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:43.480]  be much cheaper now doctor Wolfgang Wudarg I want to move quickly because I know your
[1:14:43.480 --> 1:14:48.720]  time is precious here and you're very busy I have so many questions but a thought that
[1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:52.880]  I just have when you mentioned the third world they're already saying they're going to ship
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:57.800]  this throughout the year around the world when they admit that the virus is already
[1:14:57.800 --> 1:15:03.160]  mutated and is already even weakening more and in six months a year it'll be absolutely
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:07.200]  worthless if it wasn't already worthless and they're saying they're going to ship the
[1:15:07.200 --> 1:15:12.240]  unused vaccine because the hoax failed the people didn't take it en masse to the third
[1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:17.880]  world I mean is that not manifest fraud on top of fraud right there but there is no influence
[1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:23.200]  of the hot in the hot countries and we don't need it and there is no no influence in the
[1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:28.760]  Arctic neither the virus needs a certain climate to spread and this is only in our regions
[1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:34.080]  in winter and so we don't the third world doesn't need it really but I had a discussion
[1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:38.440]  yesterday with Japanese colleagues and the Japanese they are going to have the vaccination
[1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:43.520]  campaign in February so they just will start now and they know already that it is a very
[1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:49.880]  mild flu to come and there is no danger in it but the Japan bought a vaccine for a hundred
[1:15:49.880 --> 1:15:57.000]  ten million people and they cannot retire from this vaccine contract so they are in
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:01.800]  a very very big political dilemma now and they have very big problems because the Japanese
[1:16:01.800 --> 1:16:06.600]  people they already know it wouldn't be necessary to get vaccinated what shall Japan do with
[1:16:06.600 --> 1:16:11.560]  all its vaccines but that's my next issue is this is destroying the credibility of the
[1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:16.240]  entire medical system when it is big pharma that is doing it.
[1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:22.600]  In the Council of Europe report it is discussed that this is an untested dangerous vaccine
[1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:28.040]  can you speak to that also can you speak to the German military and government ministers
[1:16:28.040 --> 1:16:33.040]  being given a special additive free vaccine that isn't a very strong vote of confidence.
[1:16:33.040 --> 1:16:39.240]  Yeah this is two points the first thing is that the pandemic vaccine is a pandemic vaccine
[1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:47.920]  and it was it was planned to be produced very fast trust me and so this is the we have additives
[1:16:47.920 --> 1:16:53.680]  at Juven's end with it and they are only tested with elderly people this is why the FDA in
[1:16:53.680 --> 1:17:00.040]  US didn't allow this vaccine to be used with children and younger people in US and so US
[1:17:00.040 --> 1:17:06.120]  people population is well better protected against those side effects but in Europe we
[1:17:06.120 --> 1:17:10.680]  just use them for children for pregnant women and there are no clinic there's no clinical
[1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:16.240]  testing has been done with with children and with some of the vaccines and there are other
[1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:21.000]  vaccines which you spoke about for soldiers this is a vaccine which takes the whole virus
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:26.200]  and it is known to have more side effects so it's not better than the one the rest of
[1:17:26.200 --> 1:17:30.200]  the population gets it was very well yes sir doctor we know what adjuvants did with the
[1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:34.840]  anthrax shot the Pentagon suspended it because in young people as you know doctor before
[1:17:34.840 --> 1:17:39.640]  the audience may not when you give a young person who has a really strong immune system
[1:17:39.640 --> 1:17:46.000]  an adjuvant it can trigger what the cytokine storm and have the lungs fill full of liquid
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:52.360]  similar to hemorrhagic fever correct this I don't I don't have this scientific evidence
[1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:57.840]  for this but I know that the adjuvants they stimulate the immune system enormously and
[1:17:57.840 --> 1:18:03.080]  this may lead to a misfunction of the immune system which means that there may be auto
[1:18:03.080 --> 1:18:09.000]  immune diseases or allergic diseases result afterwards within those vaccinated people
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:14.480]  so what about all the confirmed cases of Guillain beret Guillain beret was there when
[1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:22.280]  they had this vaccine some it was in in in the US when they stopped having this and
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:27.920]  this is the there is evidence for this but what they what they use now is a new patent
[1:18:27.920 --> 1:18:32.920]  adjuvant and we don't have any ad we don't have any evidence how the side effects of
[1:18:32.920 --> 1:18:39.160]  this will be but this is the big risk and it would not be necessary to take this risk
[1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:42.920]  I mean sure if the flu was killing tens of millions of people it might be if you could
[1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:49.040]  trust the shot but if it's a mild bottom line doctor you personally looking at the research
[1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:55.400]  is this a giant hoax was this I mean we know they paid off most of the big health ministers
[1:18:55.400 --> 1:19:00.760]  to come out in fear monger is that not a conflict of interest it is for sure it is a conflict
[1:19:00.760 --> 1:19:04.880]  of interest those people who are there for their shareholders who are ahead to have the
[1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:09.440]  interest of the pharmaceutical companies and to earn a lot of money they have different
[1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:14.200]  reasons to decide and they decide differently than those people who are in charge of public
[1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:19.680]  health and of safety and the WHO is an institution a public institution for public health and
[1:19:19.680 --> 1:19:26.360]  it should not its decision should not be into influenced by the by the interest of the industry
[1:19:26.360 --> 1:19:31.480]  and this seems to be what happened there is no other explanation for those decisions
[1:19:31.480 --> 1:19:40.360]  bottom line it's a hoax unbelievable doctor wolfgang wudar is our guest we're going to
[1:19:40.360 --> 1:19:44.680]  give you his website when we come back I'm going to try to twist his arm and staying
[1:19:44.680 --> 1:19:47.360]  maybe to forty after because we're going to have one five minute segment when we come
[1:19:47.360 --> 1:19:51.200]  back and I've got this huge list of questions if it sounds like I'm interrupting you doctor

[1:24:19.880 --> 1:24:26.680]  giving us a lot of time he was the head of the investigation for the 47 member nation body council
[1:24:26.680 --> 1:24:32.920]  of europe parliamentary assembly over health and they just had the start of the intense
[1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:38.680]  investigation i want to get into that in the next segment any new breaking info that came out
[1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:43.800]  what you were told by big pharma that you had before you but first doctor you talk about the
[1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:51.640]  bird flu and i have the check republic news i have the london telegraph where they were mixing
[1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:57.800]  weaponized i mean very deadly bird flu in thank god they found out it was killing the test animals
[1:24:57.800 --> 1:25:03.240]  we have homeless people die after bird flu vaccine trial in poland roughly 30 percent that we're
[1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:09.400]  given it died the media never said what big pharma company that was you mentioned that that hoax as
[1:25:09.400 --> 1:25:15.240]  well can can you speak to that oh i'm not so much in this matter i only know that the enterprise
[1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:23.320]  will back the sand such stuff to uh 16 lever laboratories in europe and that in check republic
[1:25:23.320 --> 1:25:29.080]  they found out that it is a very dangerous mixture which they send and they it is said
[1:25:29.080 --> 1:25:35.160]  that they send it by accident but the enterprise doesn't declare anything and as far as i know
[1:25:35.160 --> 1:25:39.560]  there have been no parliamentary investigation i think that should be a very deep and thorough
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:45.160]  investigation on this what i know is there is some courts dealing with this so we have to
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:50.200]  to look at the single states and i think the german parliament should to be engaged in this
[1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:55.000]  and have a look at what happened really what happened why it happened it is a very dangerous
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  thing if those materials are handled if those dangerous viruses are handled uh by people
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:07.640]  who who are not very responsible and who are not very much bound to public interest and to public
[1:26:07.640 --> 1:26:14.360]  health this is the dangerous thing and uh if an enterprise which goes for money has such stuff
[1:26:14.360 --> 1:26:22.920]  i think it is not uh we should not allow me i also saw a lot of top genetic engineers and
[1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:28.280]  scientists in the headlines i'm i would imagine you saw a doctor saying this was clearly a
[1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:34.760]  manufactured that the that the swine flu appeared to come out of nowhere in the wrong hemisphere
[1:26:34.760 --> 1:26:41.000]  wrong time of year and then it had a pedigree leading back to laboratories it is a funny thing
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:48.040]  that it went like it went and it it is an unusual event which happened and the blow up which was
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:55.720]  made very soon after the whole thing started uh seems to be an indication that there was a
[1:26:55.720 --> 1:27:00.200]  that there were people already waiting for something to happen to use this what happened
[1:27:00.200 --> 1:27:05.480]  for their purposes it looks like that uh but we have to find out what really happened i don't know
[1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:10.360]  it well sir you told me off there you were aware of info wars dot com and prison planet dot com i
[1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:18.040]  will send you today the secret department of cemetery document we got in january of 2009
[1:27:18.760 --> 1:27:24.280]  and the clips of an emergency manager who we did not give his name but we confirmed who he was
[1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:28.280]  we we interviewed him others interviewing i interviewed him off there we had the reporter
[1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:33.800]  on to interview him with the newspaper dot com in january three months before the hype in
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:39.960]  mexico city began they went all over the u.s from california illinois new york and i got the
[1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:47.640]  bureau of uh of cemeteries and said millions will die prepare for martial law now it appears
[1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:54.120]  that that was done also in in in april got secret documents department of health in texas
[1:27:54.120 --> 1:27:59.400]  where they told him we're really at level six and that the government was scaring the locals
[1:27:59.400 --> 1:28:07.800]  covertly to create this fear uh so clearly sir we know before it even popped up in mexico that
[1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:12.600]  they were hyping this i don't know whether your parliamentarians in your parliament whether they
[1:28:12.600 --> 1:28:17.960]  are after they should be after this too because when we have such uh when we have such uh
[1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:23.720]  informations in parliament normally the opposition goes for it and the opposition tries to find out
[1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:28.040]  and the parliamentarians have the right to investigate everything every door has to open
[1:28:28.040 --> 1:28:33.160]  if a parliamentarian comes and it has to be made obvious we have to see all the files this is how
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:38.760]  we work normally in in many countries of europe in germany i did this many times and this should
[1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:45.320]  be done and there should be investigations and uh so i think this is a very very big and very
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:54.280]  severe suspicion uh we must have and so we have to to to be sure well sir going back to the hoax
[1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:59.800]  which you you're agreeing and clearly it's a hoax what was the point of the hoax and we also know
[1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:04.760]  again all these different government ministers in health a lot of them are on the payroll of these
[1:29:04.760 --> 1:29:11.880]  companies i know about some countries that they they were listed are listed now of of scientists
[1:29:11.880 --> 1:29:19.000]  who advised the minister of health and those the scientists are on the payroll of several companies

[1:33:04.760 --> 1:33:09.720]  Dr Wolfgang Wodarg is our guest we just got about eight minutes left with him today
[1:33:10.440 --> 1:33:18.760]  his website is wodarg.deowdarg very honored to have him uh with us he headed up the investigation
[1:33:18.760 --> 1:33:23.880]  for the 47 member health council of europe okay sir tell us now that you've had official
[1:33:23.880 --> 1:33:28.440]  hearings on this new information that you've discovered you also told me during the break
[1:33:28.440 --> 1:33:33.800]  the connection between bird flu swine flu secret contracts why that is so important
[1:33:34.840 --> 1:33:41.960]  yeah we had a first edition and the WHO representative was there and we asked them
[1:33:41.960 --> 1:33:48.520]  um which uh reasons they had to change the definition of a pandemic and he didn't give
[1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:53.800]  us scientific reasons he just told us that the WHO is asking many scientists he told us
[1:33:53.800 --> 1:34:01.480]  the number of scientists about 138 scientists he said they were asking and after this they
[1:34:01.480 --> 1:34:07.960]  had changed the definition but when you really when you really see the the press reports from
[1:34:07.960 --> 1:34:13.800]  that time it's from the 19th of may and we asked him this too then you can see that there were
[1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:22.520]  many member states urging urging the WHO not to use the new definition and mr fukura who is the
[1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:29.080]  representative of WHO who was present in stress book he told us he told those the member states
[1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:34.120]  of WHO had told them yes we will have a deep thought on it but then they met again with
[1:34:34.120 --> 1:34:41.880]  pharmaceutical industry and they just went on blindly using this unwanted uh pandemic
[1:34:41.880 --> 1:34:47.880]  definition and this led to spending enormous amounts of money and this led to unnecessary
[1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:55.240]  vaccinations of millions of people so i think this will be a very very severe thing and very
[1:34:56.600 --> 1:35:02.120]  accusations we have against the WHO and against those pharmaceutical companies
[1:35:02.120 --> 1:35:08.840]  doing such an anti-influence on the WHO decision well dr woodard we know
[1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:16.760]  that they paid off ministers we know they falsified the pandemic we know they didn't
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:21.560]  get proper testing of the vaccine we know they're making billions of dollars off of this
[1:35:21.560 --> 1:35:27.800]  we know that bird flu trials killed a bunch of people i mean is this not a very serious criminal
[1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:36.920]  operation that we're investigating i think we have to stop this entering of the private private
[1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:42.760]  firms private pharmaceutical firms to the public health institution they should just been uh they
[1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:48.040]  should just leave this institution they should have no influence on the decisions of the agency
[1:35:48.040 --> 1:35:53.720]  of the public health agency which is so important for for uh protecting us against health threats
[1:35:53.720 --> 1:36:01.560]  worldwide and this is this shall be one of our uh our goals to to give advice to our governments
[1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:08.760]  to go to the World Health Assembly and to say that WHO has to change its rules and that there has
[1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:14.920]  to be more transparency this will be the result i think of our uh of our recommendations this
[1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:21.800]  will be our recommendations to the to the member states well we know that in the us in Europe
[1:36:21.800 --> 1:36:25.560]  especially the us because i've really studied that area perhaps you can fill a sin on europe
[1:36:26.280 --> 1:36:30.120]  i mean these are very draconian powers and they try to have forced inoculations
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:37.560]  in new york state in massachusetts state i saw some european union member states tried to say
[1:36:37.560 --> 1:36:43.160]  everyone must take it it's the law isn't this a human rights issue when the government yes
[1:36:43.160 --> 1:36:48.600]  in in in league with big pharma says you must take this experimental shot yes the the council
[1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:53.480]  of europe is a human rights institution and this is why we deal with a matter because the integrity
[1:36:53.480 --> 1:37:01.080]  of of the body and and and the right to health is a very important uh fundamental right which
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:06.760]  is touched and it should not be touched by uh if a doctor just do something because he because he
[1:37:06.760 --> 1:37:12.040]  wants to earn money he's punished if he doesn't do it for the for the health of of his patient but
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:17.880]  he does it only for his his pocket so if an institution or if a big institution does decisions
[1:37:17.880 --> 1:37:24.280]  and for money and it's influenced by people who do it for money this is a crime too and i think
[1:37:24.280 --> 1:37:31.960]  we have to go after it as a as a human rights institution and we will do it well sir we appreciate
[1:37:31.960 --> 1:37:39.480]  you joining us here today my final question is this it's two part what is the process on the report
[1:37:39.480 --> 1:37:44.200]  any other breaking news that came out of the preliminary hearings so what is the process
[1:37:44.200 --> 1:37:50.280]  any new information breaking news you'd like to relate to the world here and when will the final
[1:37:50.280 --> 1:37:57.080]  report come out i think the first the last question i can answer the first is that there is no pandemic
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:38:04.040]  vaccination necessary we know this now rather we are we are very very sure that it is not necessary
[1:38:04.040 --> 1:38:08.840]  so the people were right in france the people were right in germany not to have this pandemic
[1:38:08.840 --> 1:38:15.400]  vaccination this is the first and most important thing and what will be the the result of our
[1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:24.680]  investigations we see that in many national parliaments we have special investigations according
[1:38:24.680 --> 1:38:31.720]  to their institutes and their scientists now so we are 47 nations 47 parliaments will do
[1:38:31.720 --> 1:38:37.560]  investigations and what we do in the council of here we will be the platform for exchange of
[1:38:37.560 --> 1:38:43.320]  experience and we will foster this discussion in the national parliaments and we try to feed
[1:38:43.320 --> 1:38:49.800]  them with informations we get from who and from other institutions we have we are now collect
[1:38:49.800 --> 1:38:53.960]  all information that we are in this file in the in this period that we collect many many
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:58.360]  informations about single scientists single institutes where they get their money from
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:04.680]  and all this is now collected and we we get a better and better mosaic a better picture of
[1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:11.000]  what had happened and this will be the this will be the report then and the recommendations will
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:17.960]  come out of it well we know laws have been broken some crimes have been committed conflict of
[1:39:17.960 --> 1:39:25.640]  interest but if this clear picture is confirmed do you believe that there will be calls for
[1:39:25.640 --> 1:39:32.280]  indictments or criminal investigations or does big pharma have too much control there is no law
[1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:40.520]  for who there is no one who punishes those people in who we only have national law so this is very
[1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:46.120]  important that we have collect the information and on the national level we try to find those
[1:39:46.120 --> 1:39:50.760]  people responsible and we try to punish them there if they are if they did did something wrong
[1:39:50.760 --> 1:39:55.720]  because if we don't they're just going to keep doing this over and over again again yes we
[1:39:55.720 --> 1:40:00.040]  if this is a but this is the task of the government because the governments they
[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:07.000]  define the role of the who it's a contract between the u n nations and the u n nations
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:11.880]  as and the governments of those nations they control the work of who but it's the government
[1:40:11.880 --> 1:40:17.720]  it's not the part will you be able to ever get those secret contracts we got it in Germany
[1:40:17.720 --> 1:40:22.040]  the french got it and the national parliaments on our working to get all the contracts the
[1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:28.440]  japanese told me that they had no possibility to retire from their contract as we in Germany
[1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:32.760]  succeeded to do a little bit so we negotiated with the pharmaceutical companies and they let us
[1:40:33.720 --> 1:40:41.560]  save a little bit money from from those almost 700 million euros they wanted first so it's very
[1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:46.760]  very different from nation to nation and i just can't tell my colleagues and just can ask my
[1:40:46.760 --> 1:40:52.840]  colleagues in all parliaments go ahead have investigations have a deep look we cannot
[1:40:52.840 --> 1:40:59.560]  uh to tolerate such a development we cannot have this the next winter again we don't want
[1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:05.320]  such faked pandemics but the good news is the court of public opinion i've seen the numbers
[1:41:05.320 --> 1:41:11.000]  this is record numbers of people not buying the hype who are refusing to take the shots
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:16.040]  and in the final equation we're going to let you go doctor uh who who are the real bad guys big
[1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:23.240]  pharma and and are you saying the who is run by big pharma the who has opened the door for big
[1:41:23.240 --> 1:41:30.600]  pharma and the big pharma influences the who buy scientists with institutes paid by big pharma
[1:41:30.600 --> 1:41:35.320]  scientists are dependent that the institutes get money from big pharma and the scientists
[1:41:35.320 --> 1:41:39.880]  go there they do the clinical studies for big pharma on one hand on the other hand they go to
[1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:46.280]  w.h.l. and say you have to buy those pills do do such decisions this is what the suspicion is
[1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:52.360]  and this cannot be tolerated but the public health institutions have to be free from influence
[1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:57.400]  from economic influence we it's about our health it's not about business yeah well that's like
[1:41:57.400 --> 1:42:01.800]  rick perry our governor saying all girls must take the Gardasil shot that they admits killed a
[1:42:01.800 --> 1:42:06.680]  bunch of people and then that wasn't even a law he just recommended it but went on tv and said it
[1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:12.360]  was the law hoax after hoax and it turned out most of his party got massive money from murk
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:20.840]  dr wolfgang wudarg we appreciate uh dr wodarg for joining us wodarg uh dot d e is the website
[1:42:20.840 --> 1:42:28.120]  w o d a r g we appreciate you and your colleagues unanimous investigation uh unanimously agreeing
[1:42:28.120 --> 1:42:33.240]  this is a hoax and a fraud and and and expanding the investigation we salute your courage sir and

[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:45.400]  take care sir we're very very interested thank you there goes dr uh wodarg now notice
[1:42:46.440 --> 1:42:51.560]  that they tried to make it mandatory in france and then in states in the u.s and this whole thing
[1:42:51.560 --> 1:42:59.800]  fell apart because we exposed it because we found out in january early on that they were
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:04.600]  planning a flu hoax height we didn't know that would be real we didn't know that would be super
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:10.280]  deadly we didn't know there'd be martial law we just knew they were hardening all police facilities
[1:43:10.280 --> 1:43:17.400]  for martial law in the name of pandemic megadeth flu millions dead in illinois millions dead in
[1:43:17.400 --> 1:43:22.440]  new york state i mean these are the documents we got these are the eyewitnesses and i went on
[1:43:22.440 --> 1:43:28.280]  air in january in february in march and said look for flu and then when it popped up in mexico
[1:43:28.280 --> 1:43:34.680]  and they hyped it up we said we don't know what's happening but we know they're staging it look out
[1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:40.200]  and we our websites got hacked we got attacked and then i really got concerned because these were
[1:43:40.200 --> 1:43:46.920]  government level attacks and i was like my god this is real but the good news is we exposed the
[1:43:46.920 --> 1:43:52.440]  hoax together you the listeners of this show and others and we came through this together
[1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:59.480]  and now they are damaged to where it will be hard for them but obama signed an executive order
[1:43:59.480 --> 1:44:04.120]  for total police state control during a biological attack and what he signed that a month ago or
[1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:08.280]  i guess it was in december a month and a half ago now and so there are it's hard to believe we're
[1:44:08.280 --> 1:44:14.680]  in the second month of 2010 before we know it it'll be december 31st 2010 and we'll be going into
[1:44:14.680 --> 1:44:23.320]  2011 uh and all of this craziness but um we've got freeway ricky ross coming up
[1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:29.400]  who was running narcotics for the cia and didn't even find out about it till later
[1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:33.640]  one of the most famous drug dealers in history we're going to talk about a host of issues with
[1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:38.840]  free ricky ross and then kevin booth pops in halfway through the interview uh he is uh
[1:44:40.120 --> 1:44:44.520]  he's interviewed in kevin's film how we'd won the west and that's kevin's title i i think it's
[1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:48.520]  a great film i consulted on and i would have called a drug war too this exposes the drug war
[1:44:48.520 --> 1:44:54.360]  how they want codex alimentarius to restrict and control the vitamins it exposes how they're trying
[1:44:54.360 --> 1:45:00.920]  to stop medical marijuana it exposes how 87 percent of illegal drug users only use marijuana
[1:45:00.920 --> 1:45:04.680]  and that's why they want to keep marijuana illegal because if they don't have that they
[1:45:04.680 --> 1:45:09.560]  don't have an excuse for swat teams and prisons and controlling us and how the government ships
[1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:14.520]  in and launders the majority of the drugs how we'd won the west you can pre-order it it ships in 12

[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:07.480]  attack i know paul watson told me before i went on air he's writing a big detailed report on this
[1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:13.640]  i hope he adds the part about all the white house officials and uh the five different network
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:21.160]  advisors on military affairs all former generals that famous tape came out three years ago
[1:49:21.160 --> 1:49:25.000]  well they're saying man we really need another terror attack another 9 11 would sure help us
[1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:30.040]  and rumsfeld's yeah it's too bad just the public you know i mean they come one hair
[1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:35.800]  breath from coming right out and saying they carried out 9 11 yes it's up red alert intelligence
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:42.360]  chiefs certain their bosses will stage terror attack soon and we know the underwear bomber was
[1:49:42.360 --> 1:49:47.320]  staged they let him on the plane protecting us government state departments that we were tracking
[1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:53.640]  him totally staged and this article is now up on prisonplanet.com you guys print it for me so i
[1:49:53.640 --> 1:49:57.720]  can read it so they're looking across the room when i get back thanks we're going to cover this
[1:49:57.720 --> 1:50:04.680]  when we come back from break and dovetail it with neo con says obama should save presidency by attacking
[1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:10.840]  iran this was just said yesterday a national review and if that didn't stage terror attack
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:16.280]  i don't know what is and then we have all these other people in the past uh these different neo
[1:50:16.280 --> 1:50:24.840]  cons coming out and saying we sure need another 9 11 so i want to go over uh some of their statements
[1:50:24.840 --> 1:50:33.160]  as well because these people are just devilishly obvious and have such contempt for the public
[1:50:33.160 --> 1:50:42.680]  they just admit this right out in the open and so again uh this is uh stew by kovsky writing for
[1:50:42.680 --> 1:50:47.080]  the philadelphia daily news i want to remind you of what he said where they're just right out in
[1:50:47.080 --> 1:50:51.800]  the open with their game plan if they don't stage terror and launch new wars it's over for them but

[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:51.160]  efforts of the underwear bombing patsy military industrial complex promises to try again using
[1:54:51.160 --> 1:54:55.880]  information gleaned from the blatantly set up underwear bomber patsy intelligence chiefs have
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:54:59.720]  assured us that their bosses will stage another terror attack in the u.s i'm going to play the
[1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:03.880]  fox news clip in the last 30 minutes of the show today within the next three to six months
[1:55:05.080 --> 1:55:10.120]  that's their timeline as they mass ships and troops for iran according to the nation's
[1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:14.680]  intelligence chiefs a terror attack in the united states will be likely launched within the next
[1:55:14.680 --> 1:55:20.920]  six months reports the wall street journal abc news has learned some of the intelligence has come
[1:55:20.920 --> 1:55:25.720]  from accused christmas day bomber states the report now they want to x-ray your body with
[1:55:25.720 --> 1:55:31.320]  chest x-rays because they may have fake breast implants with bombs despite the fact that the
[1:55:31.320 --> 1:55:35.080]  official story about the christmas day bombing has been discredited beyond all recognition
[1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:40.440]  the establishment is still constantly invoking it is yet another reason for americans to
[1:55:40.440 --> 1:55:45.400]  obediently line up for naked body scans in fear of whatever boogie man is being waived in front
[1:55:45.400 --> 1:55:50.360]  of their faces this week since federal and state authorities apparently now consider libertarians
[1:55:50.360 --> 1:55:54.680]  ron paul supporters gun owners and basically anyone with two brain cells left rub together
[1:55:54.680 --> 1:56:00.440]  as potential terrorist domestic terrorist whatever tricks they do decide to pull over the next
[1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:04.840]  six months will undoubtedly be used to tighten the screws against the american dissidents
[1:56:04.840 --> 1:56:09.080]  they have consistently characterizes extremist threats and they're saying they want to start
[1:56:09.080 --> 1:56:13.160]  censoring the internet in the name of countering this i mean they're moving folks because we're
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:19.320]  hurting them authorities not servants but authorities last week quietly uh reverse the
[1:56:19.320 --> 1:56:23.400]  official story about the christmas day underwear bombing attack acknowledging that the accomplice
[1:56:23.400 --> 1:56:28.600]  was involved despite weeks of denial and derision of key eyewitness kurt haskell's description
[1:56:28.600 --> 1:56:34.120]  of a sharp-dressed man who helped the underwear bomber board flight 253 in amsterdam to detroit
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:40.040]  detroit lawyer kurt haskell maintained from the beginning that he saw a well-dressed indian man
[1:56:40.040 --> 1:56:44.680]  aid the accused bomber to board the plane despite the fact that he had no passport and was on a
[1:56:44.680 --> 1:56:49.800]  terror watch list while mutala but was poorly dressed his friend was dressed in exquisite suit
[1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:55.240]  haskell said he says the man's the suited man asked ticket agents whether the underwear bomber
[1:56:55.240 --> 1:57:00.120]  could board without a passport this guy he said is from sudan and we do this all the time reported
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:06.760]  michigan live news website fbi just interviewed haskell and told him about the sharp-dressed man
[1:57:06.760 --> 1:57:12.280]  but officials refused to admit that a wider conspiracy was at hand stoically maintaining
[1:57:12.280 --> 1:57:17.000]  the official story that the underwear bomber acted alone authorities claimed that videotapes
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:21.640]  did not show a second man accompanying the underwear bomber and yet they refused to release any footage
[1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:27.000]  of the alleged bomber there seems little doubt that the underwear bomber was at least one
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:31.720]  accomplice if not more authorities have remained silent about other eyewitness reports which
[1:57:32.440 --> 1:57:39.080]  described a man intently filming the alleged terrorists throughout the whole flight a connection
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:43.000]  that strongly suggests the attempted bomber was involved in some kind of drill and then his strings
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:48.040]  were being pulled by people in more senior positions then you have the other guy they say
[1:57:48.040 --> 1:57:54.280]  they found with the bomb they jerked off the plane it continues hundreds of terror suspects
[1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:59.000]  patsy's and mentally deficients have been convicted in civilian federal courts including
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:04.600]  convicted shoe bomber richard reid who attended the finsbury park mosque of north london the
[1:58:04.600 --> 1:58:12.920]  finsbury imam at the time has been working for british security services since 97 just like the

[2:02:42.600 --> 2:02:49.800]  you know when you see these people uh attacking different countries over oil and and you know
[2:02:49.800 --> 2:02:55.560]  resources you know it makes you wonder you know what is all this about you know is it really about
[2:02:56.280 --> 2:03:02.360]  weapons of mass destruction or really just about making somebody's pocket richer who already have
[2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:10.760]  so much money that they're never gonna spend it absolutely expanding on that uh ricky expanding
[2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:17.320]  on it just in a nutshell how did you get into drug dealing how did you get supplied by the cia
[2:03:17.320 --> 2:03:24.520]  and is it true you were you were making profit four or five million dollars a day uh yes uh
[2:03:24.520 --> 2:03:32.360]  i got into it from a school teacher turned me on to the drug business uh i started with absolutely
[2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:40.520]  nothing a hundred twenty five dollars i was broke um i was making my heyday a million to two million
[2:03:40.520 --> 2:03:46.360]  dollars every day it wouldn't be a day it was not a day went by that i wasn't making a million dollars
[2:03:48.200 --> 2:03:54.120]  now was that profit or just uh overall overall wasn't profit it would be uh off of a million
[2:03:54.120 --> 2:04:01.480]  dollars my profit would be about two hundred four dollars now when we come back because we're
[2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:05.560]  about to break i want to go through you know the history briefly for people that don't know most

[2:04:11.240 --> 2:04:16.440]  you didn't even discover till later you were really being supplied by the cia i want to walk
[2:04:16.440 --> 2:04:21.000]  through that because this is a historical record and then gary webb they tried to discredit him he
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:25.960]  had a new book coming out proving he was right he's been since vindicated he said people been
[2:04:25.960 --> 2:04:31.560]  breaking into his house then he got killed uh shot himself twice in the head and the police said oh
[2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:38.680]  it's normal to shoot yourself twice in the head so what is that doing i i don't know all right

[2:10:04.520 --> 2:10:10.520]  trying to become a tennis pro wanting to go to college first to play tennis and then wanting to
[2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:16.280]  go from there to become a pro uh it was a movie came out that first introduced me the first time
[2:10:16.280 --> 2:10:21.080]  i ever heard about cocaine and then it went from there to a teacher telling me that that's how he
[2:10:21.080 --> 2:10:28.680]  made his money and that sparked my interest i went from being a total novice within five months
[2:10:28.680 --> 2:10:36.040]  to being you know a player in the drug business making you know a thousand dollars a day so
[2:10:37.160 --> 2:10:43.480]  basically i was trapped almost i would say because you know when i go out and talk to
[2:10:43.480 --> 2:10:48.120]  these kids right now i let them know that i know that today they may be innocent and not involved
[2:10:48.120 --> 2:10:53.720]  in drugs or anything like that there but tomorrow you know that could change with circumstances
[2:10:53.720 --> 2:11:01.400]  so that's basically how i got started in it uh how i found out about that the cia was involved
[2:11:01.400 --> 2:11:06.840]  i got a call one day from my lawyer my counselor came and got me to say hey your lawyer said he
[2:11:06.840 --> 2:11:12.600]  needs to talk to you so when i called my lawyer back it was uh uh he was telling me about gary he
[2:11:12.600 --> 2:11:16.600]  didn't tell me gary's name but he said some reporters investigating your informant and he
[2:11:16.600 --> 2:11:20.920]  said this guy's a major player i said well i already knew he's a major player that's why
[2:11:20.920 --> 2:11:25.800]  i used to get all my drugs from him so uh i don't know how major he was though you know i didn't
[2:11:25.800 --> 2:11:29.720]  know that he had the ties that that that he had i thought that we would just basically
[2:11:29.720 --> 2:11:35.000]  you know work in los angeles i didn't know that you know he had uh spiced up in san francisco
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:41.880]  oklahoma new orleans he was basically working the whole country so uh my lawyer told me he said
[2:11:41.880 --> 2:11:45.480]  well uh this reporter wants to come and see you i said well i ain't got nothing to lose you know
[2:11:45.480 --> 2:11:49.560]  i'm looking at life sentence i ain't never going home and the evidence is it's stacked up pretty
[2:11:49.560 --> 2:11:54.520]  good against me you know this guy he called me and and tells me that he has 700 kilos of cocaine
[2:11:54.520 --> 2:11:59.080]  and he needs to get rid of him and these guys on his back and he owes him money and they're gonna do
[2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:04.600]  something to him and would i please help him get rid of you know a couple hundred you know and i try
[2:12:04.600 --> 2:12:07.960]  to explain to him hey man you know i'm out the game i'm trying to go straight through the right
[2:12:07.960 --> 2:12:14.040]  thing you know and uh you know just just do the right thing now well anyway he he sweated me for
[2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:20.280]  six months and finally i broke down and i introduced him to a friend when i introduced him to this friend
[2:12:20.280 --> 2:12:25.800]  da come in and arrest all of us and take my friend's money who i who i introduced him to and they
[2:12:25.800 --> 2:12:31.320]  wanted to burn you in hindsight because though previously your big supplier had been the cia
[2:12:31.320 --> 2:12:37.080]  let's go back though and explain that because that later came out in the uh dark alliance
[2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:45.720]  piece give folks the names of these players uh uh and um normanessus danilo blendon danilo blendon
[2:12:45.720 --> 2:12:51.320]  is the guy that i dealt with ten hands you know i saw him every single day two or three times a day
[2:12:51.320 --> 2:12:57.480]  uh normanessus i never remember seeing him but danilo testified on the witness stand that we
[2:12:57.480 --> 2:13:01.800]  have been in building a couple times together because you know when i was young i was young i
[2:13:01.800 --> 2:13:06.120]  wasn't really paying attention to who was the whose name was what uh i didn't care about the
[2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:11.560]  contrast they were using you as the main front continue right basically what the only thing
[2:13:11.560 --> 2:13:16.920]  i was really doing alex was selling drugs i loved the debt that i was getting drugs so cheap and
[2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:21.240]  i could beat anybody's price and i could get all the drugs that i wanted those were my main
[2:13:21.240 --> 2:13:25.480]  concerns at that time i didn't care if they was coming from the contrast the cia i didn't ask any
[2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:30.840]  question you know you're taking a guy who was crap broke and you know living in south central
[2:13:30.840 --> 2:13:35.880]  offensives and now he's out of south central he has a condo and houses and cars you know i'm able
[2:13:35.880 --> 2:13:40.520]  to help my family those are the things that i was yeah suddenly you're making a million dollars a day
[2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:45.160]  but the government the banks bringing it in and laundering it they're not bad it's it's you that's
[2:13:45.160 --> 2:13:49.880]  bad so so let me bring us through when you really got the big connections what year that was when
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:57.880]  the money really started rolling in about 82 which 83 we started making money hand over i mean just
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:02.760]  i started making so much money that money didn't even matter anymore it wasn't about the money it
[2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:06.600]  got to the point where i was just doing it for the rush i had more money than i thought i could
[2:14:06.600 --> 2:14:13.960]  ever spend uh you know i just bought whatever i wanted and how i found out about the cia for
[2:14:13.960 --> 2:14:19.080]  the first time was when when uh gary was paper because gary didn't let it out you know gary
[2:14:19.080 --> 2:14:25.000]  didn't tell me what the story was he first he went make sure that we want to the same guy that my
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:32.520]  guy who set me up with his guy and uh the next thing i know uh after my trial you know gary gary
[2:14:32.520 --> 2:14:39.560]  basically questioned blend on for us he interrogated blend on through my attorney and this is the sand
[2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:45.400]  this is the san jose mercury news polling surprise winning author right and uh what we did when we
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:50.360]  were going to trial gary said right on the first row and whenever my lawyer would read a question he
[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:55.320]  would always walk back to gary and ask me what should i ask him and then gary would give him names
[2:14:55.320 --> 2:15:00.360]  and and and you know times and dates and all this stuff and we couldn't believe where all this
[2:15:00.360 --> 2:15:07.080]  information was coming from so uh gary made the informant say stuff like uh ragan and gave him
[2:15:07.080 --> 2:15:12.760]  18 million dollars to buy uh medical supplies and they took it and bought drugs you know things that
[2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:20.600]  other other nature came out in his testimony so it turns out that blandone and others were working
[2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:29.240]  for the cia absolutely they're what they call cia operative they did not cia agent but but they were
[2:15:29.240 --> 2:15:35.240]  they were operative meaning that uh they're on the cia payroll but you know they don't have green
[2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:43.720]  cards so that they can't officially be cia agent and then later people like barry seal who were
[2:15:43.720 --> 2:15:51.480]  operatives they end up killing them absolutely we're not sure blend is still alive we don't know
[2:15:51.480 --> 2:15:55.400]  where he's at right now go through some more of what came out in the trial of what came out in
[2:15:55.400 --> 2:16:00.200]  dark alliance i mean they really wanted to get web and i talked to his friends and others
[2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:04.200]  who said that there were people breaking in his house everything else and then suddenly all
[2:16:04.200 --> 2:16:08.680]  these operatives came out and said we were liars nobody ever broke in his house even though i had
[2:16:08.680 --> 2:16:12.840]  all these friends that had talked to gary webb i'd interviewed gary webb i'd talked to webb about
[2:16:12.840 --> 2:16:17.800]  threats he was getting he's got a new book coming out it's totally proving even more i was going to
[2:16:17.800 --> 2:16:23.000]  get him on and then he shoots himself twice in the head with a shotgun well you know even not not
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:28.840]  just there but even in the courtroom to hear rest gary you know the da uh the the prosecutor all of
[2:16:28.840 --> 2:16:32.360]  them told gary that they were going to get him you know they didn't want him inside the courtroom
[2:16:32.360 --> 2:16:37.160]  oh really tell us about that as a witness in the court oh well when he was inside the courtroom
[2:16:37.160 --> 2:16:41.400]  they would when he walked outside the hall all of them would be all over him what the hell are

[2:16:50.440 --> 2:16:55.720]  what was going on in the hallway you know because i couldn't see that but this is the thing that my
[2:16:55.720 --> 2:17:00.680]  lawyer was telling me and also gary had told me some of the things that happened to him as well
[2:17:00.680 --> 2:17:04.120]  well that's like the dc madame i said you're not going to kill yourself and she said no
[2:17:04.680 --> 2:17:08.600]  and then i said you better watch it and then her landlord said people were following her
[2:17:08.600 --> 2:17:12.760]  she was fearing for her life she would never kill herself then they kill her and then they
[2:17:12.760 --> 2:17:17.000]  have these operatives come out on the news and say she told me she was going to kill herself
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:21.640]  look if anybody kills me or kills you uh let me let's say it on record i'm never going to kill
[2:17:21.640 --> 2:17:26.120]  myself and you're never going to kill yourself right right i was just going to tell you that just

[2:25:23.800 --> 2:25:29.240]  well we thought we kind of this kind of information we thought that that was enough
[2:25:29.240 --> 2:25:34.920]  to free me from prison you know that that that the cia knew that their operatives because what
[2:25:34.920 --> 2:25:42.120]  we tried to do is we try to use the government theory about entrapment against them that if
[2:25:42.760 --> 2:25:48.440]  you're operative somebody that you're paying is selling drugs then that's just like you selling
[2:25:48.440 --> 2:25:54.440]  drugs you know you're connected to this person from the pay so whatever he does you're responsible
[2:25:54.440 --> 2:26:01.320]  for and we tried to get him from that angle on my appeal did you understand what i'm trying to say
[2:26:01.320 --> 2:26:07.240]  yeah oh absolutely i mean clearly and this wasn't even a stanger entrapment they were using you to
[2:26:07.240 --> 2:26:13.240]  make the money they were using you that'd be like of a mafia don gives an order to a soldier
[2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:18.600]  to go do something the mafia don's more guilty than the soldier how do you send the soldier
[2:26:18.600 --> 2:26:23.800]  to prison and not the don absolutely and that's that's the that's the scenario that we tried to
[2:26:23.800 --> 2:26:29.320]  use in in in our case in trial that that you know me and howlin tried to put together
[2:26:29.320 --> 2:26:35.000]  uh and we got all that information via gary's investigation you know what gary put together
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:40.680]  and and turn in we we turn around and use those same documents in court in the federal government
[2:26:40.680 --> 2:26:46.600]  uh the nice record of appeal said yeah okay they were selling drugs the CIA was involved
[2:26:47.320 --> 2:26:53.240]  but we're not going to excuse ricky ross from selling drugs too now a lot of evidence shows
[2:26:54.760 --> 2:27:00.760]  a lot of evidence shows you'd gone completely clean and that they set you up because they
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:04.440]  didn't want you running around out there because they knew gary webb had already been talking to you
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:09.080]  well you know what i figured and like you're saying they felt that it would be better
[2:27:09.080 --> 2:27:14.120]  for me to be in prison talking about what had happened hey it would it would leave
[2:27:14.120 --> 2:27:19.160]  him my credibility you know if you got a guy he's from prison he's saying that the CIA is selling
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:25.640]  drugs you know oh some wacko from prison you know saying all this stuff but if a guy is on the street
[2:27:26.200 --> 2:27:30.280]  saying it you know it gives him more credibility so they felt that it would be much better
[2:27:30.280 --> 2:27:34.200]  to have me in prison than to have me uh out on the street saying the same thing
[2:27:34.200 --> 2:27:39.720]  is the government putting pressure on you or have you had any veiled or open threats to keep
[2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:46.520]  your mouth shut no not at this time i haven't nobody has contacted me at all uh about anything
[2:27:46.520 --> 2:27:52.600]  but you know alex i really don't talk about it much uh uh anymore uh i just been trying to
[2:27:52.600 --> 2:27:58.120]  go on with my life and you know hopefully uh you know i don't wind up uh you know in the ocean
[2:27:58.120 --> 2:28:02.920]  or nothing like that dear well plus it's an open secret they've had congressional hearings
[2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:08.680]  documentaries the cover of esquire cia aircraft are always crashing full of drugs i mean i guess
[2:28:08.680 --> 2:28:12.920]  they just don't even care anymore okay we bring the drugs in your kids use it and we put them in
[2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:16.680]  prison right you're not going to people not going to do anything you know they're under there under
[2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:22.200]  the feeling that that i mean we do what we want to do uh we lie about whatever we want to lie about
[2:28:22.200 --> 2:28:26.680]  and the people keep on letting us stay in power and keep on collecting all the money you know and and
[2:28:26.680 --> 2:28:33.080]  and uh you know i take my hat off to gary you know for what he did but i don't know many people
[2:28:33.080 --> 2:28:39.080]  that would put their lives on the line like gary did and knowing that nothing's gonna change and
[2:28:39.080 --> 2:28:45.720]  our people are going to continuously allow our elected officials to continue run a mockery of
[2:28:45.720 --> 2:28:51.160]  our country and he had a new book coming out with even more damning evidence and now that book
[2:28:51.160 --> 2:28:55.640]  didn't get published because they shot him twice in the head with a shotgun well you know they took
[2:28:55.640 --> 2:28:59.240]  the other book they didn't they didn't want to put the other book out they wouldn't put any promotion
[2:28:59.240 --> 2:29:04.760]  behind it uh you know they fired him from the news from the news the news station yes i mean from
[2:29:04.760 --> 2:29:09.800]  the newspaper i mean gary gary was catching purity ale from everywhere you know uh one of my friends
[2:29:09.800 --> 2:29:18.120]  jesse catchman l a time uh he uh come down and and you know try to secretly do an interview with me
[2:29:18.120 --> 2:29:26.200]  that i felt was totally unproper you know that i didn't know what was going on so you know all
[2:29:26.200 --> 2:29:31.160]  of them ganged up on it and and i thought that it was it was really unfair i thought that they
[2:29:31.160 --> 2:29:36.600]  should go into investigation and and and try to prove that he was right but that's what he's been
[2:29:36.600 --> 2:29:41.320]  proven right but but but that's why they killed him yet another book coming out to prove all that
[2:29:41.320 --> 2:29:45.800]  good guys get torn down by co until pro and that's what they did to gary webb and he wouldn't
[2:29:45.800 --> 2:29:51.960]  shut up so they killed him we'll be right back with freeway ricky ross stay with us we're on

[2:33:38.120 --> 2:33:44.040]  biggest drug dealer in west coast history who discovered that the cia was why he was getting
[2:33:44.040 --> 2:33:48.920]  cocaine cheaper than anybody else and they've got similar people all over today just like tony
[2:33:48.920 --> 2:33:54.120]  montana says in scarface which is based on a composite of true stories oliver stone wrote that
[2:33:54.120 --> 2:33:57.560]  with with real drug dealers he's sitting there in his hot tub and he's going there the banks
[2:33:57.560 --> 2:34:02.040]  they've got it all figured out they've been here a thousand years they'll be here in a thousand years
[2:34:02.040 --> 2:34:09.240]  fly pelican and uh i mean basically basically that's what's going on ladies and gentlemen
[2:34:09.240 --> 2:34:15.640]  and they use people like ricky ross a real life tony montana except he's not out murdering people
[2:34:15.640 --> 2:34:21.320]  and set him up to get him out of the way now uh ricky you know i've thrown out a lot of questions
[2:34:21.320 --> 2:34:26.360]  i have a lot of questions here from twitter but but anything else you want to impart to this audience
[2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:30.600]  of a couple million people what you think is important what you're currently doing before
[2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:35.000]  we get into some of the listener questions well i think that an ounce of prevention is better than
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:39.400]  a pound of cure i think that we got to get out here to our kids we got to start talking to them
[2:34:39.400 --> 2:34:42.920]  and we got to start listening you know to what they're saying you know i've been visiting a lot
[2:34:42.920 --> 2:34:48.280]  of these kids these schools in the ghetto and men it's amazing that these kids come up to me
[2:34:48.280 --> 2:34:52.600]  after i finish talking to them and say you know what nobody never told me to think like this here
[2:34:52.600 --> 2:34:56.200]  you know basically what what what i'm teaching them alex is that you have to take something put it
[2:34:56.200 --> 2:35:01.480]  in your hand and weigh it you know you just don't take everything at face value for what the tv says
[2:35:01.480 --> 2:35:07.640]  what rappers say or what your god on the street say or what your neighbors say you have to be
[2:35:07.640 --> 2:35:13.080]  to think for yourself and analyze every situation for what it is because when you start letting
[2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:17.080]  other people think for you you're in trouble they're going to take you they're going to use you
[2:35:17.080 --> 2:35:23.320]  and you'll become their victim on the drug war all the statistics all the studies european
[2:35:23.320 --> 2:35:29.400]  countries that have done it if we decriminalize drugs on average within a decade drug use drops
[2:35:29.400 --> 2:35:33.720]  by more than half crime and plodes look what happened with alcohol prohibition and alcohol
[2:35:33.720 --> 2:35:41.160]  kills 300 000 people a year uh what is your stance on drug decriminalization i i totally agree with
[2:35:41.160 --> 2:35:46.840]  you that if you take the value out of drugs then it will no longer have the attraction that it has
[2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:51.400]  right now right now drug even has an appeal you know how it's right now they treat me like a rock
[2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:56.840]  star out here on the street you know when i go places people come up to me and and hug me they
[2:35:56.840 --> 2:36:01.800]  want to take pictures with me i've probably taken 20 30 000 pictures since i've been home i go to
[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:05.960]  usc football games they want to take pictures i go to the lakers games they want to take pictures
[2:36:07.080 --> 2:36:11.320]  when i go to the schools so you know it's something wrong with that way of thinking you
[2:36:11.320 --> 2:36:15.720]  know when when you figure that that i was the drug dealer that why would anybody want to take
[2:36:15.720 --> 2:36:21.720]  pictures with a guy like this here it's because of the decriminalization it's the glamour that
[2:36:21.720 --> 2:36:27.160]  goes with it you know you beat the system you're different we have to take that kind of stuff out
[2:36:27.160 --> 2:36:33.720]  of it exactly you take the 500 billion dollars a year in the us connected illegal drugs out of it
[2:36:33.720 --> 2:36:39.080]  and it will disappear overnight and we can have real communities and not have these cancers in
[2:36:39.080 --> 2:36:43.880]  the community and the system knows that that's why they chose the black community to put the
[2:36:43.880 --> 2:36:48.600]  cocaine out in it just like they say in the godfather you know keep it in the colored area
[2:36:48.600 --> 2:36:54.600]  their animals let them lose their souls and on top of that alex look at the prison industry
[2:36:54.600 --> 2:36:58.840]  they have these guys they put these guys in there 19 years old and give them 20 years
[2:36:58.840 --> 2:37:04.280]  and these guys work 20 years but then on top of that they pay them 25 a hour but then they charge
[2:37:04.280 --> 2:37:09.560]  a taxpayer 40 000 dollars a year per guy you know take a guy like me they gave me a life sentence
[2:37:10.520 --> 2:37:17.640]  for selling drugs i was going to live another 50 years so america taxpayers you alex we've been
[2:37:17.640 --> 2:37:24.680]  paying 40 000 a year to keep me in prison plus my medical bills and then you only feed me beans
[2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:30.200]  and rice where's all this money going you know you got me in a room the size of a closet uh the
[2:37:30.200 --> 2:37:36.360]  sheets probably only cost a dollar where's all the money going alex who's getting greed from this
[2:37:36.360 --> 2:37:41.080]  prison industry well that's what's sick ricky is i know you've studied this being in there for more
[2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:48.680]  than 20 years but i've looked at it in depth the major global private prison industries are all
[2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:55.640]  owned and run by the biggest money laundering drug dealing banks huh ain't that crazy don't
[2:37:55.640 --> 2:38:00.520]  it all come together and then the only people that can invest in that company you have to be
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:06.360]  a part of the government judge prosecutor police officer i mean it's like one big family everybody's
[2:38:06.360 --> 2:38:11.960]  benefiting everybody's profanity well that's how they legalize slavery again they put addictive
[2:38:11.960 --> 2:38:16.920]  substances out that they know people are going to get addicted to they promote it in the movies
[2:38:16.920 --> 2:38:22.840]  like it's cool and fun and glamorous and when you use it they lock you up in their private prison
[2:38:22.840 --> 2:38:29.160]  owned by the king pin drug dealers alex you figured that thing out you know better than i do when i
[2:38:29.160 --> 2:38:35.240]  live there that's exactly the way it works alex uh i don't know how you did it from out here you
[2:38:35.240 --> 2:38:39.640]  you were one of the conscious ones but that's what we need the rest of our country to wake up to and
[2:38:39.640 --> 2:38:43.640]  know that you know we could take that money that we're pumping into their pockets and start using
[2:38:43.640 --> 2:38:48.600]  it to educate our kids as you know i go to those schools and these these schools don't have a basic
[2:38:48.600 --> 2:38:56.920]  book that our kids need to learn it's ridiculous it's incredible ricky i want to bring kevin
[2:38:56.920 --> 2:39:02.680]  booth up who has interviewed you and posted it on his sacred cal site uh who's been working with you
[2:39:02.680 --> 2:39:07.960]  for the last five six seven years in prison was also working with gary webb till he got murdered
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:14.280]  i want to bring kevin up with some of his questions or stories about working with you and how great it
[2:39:14.280 --> 2:39:20.360]  is to now have you as a force of truth out on the street kevin is another trailblazer like like
[2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:26.280]  gary man kevin gets it in kevin comes out here and believe me i worry about him sometimes he's in
[2:39:26.280 --> 2:39:32.040]  south central los angeles gangfest in south central los angeles little kevin white boy
[2:39:32.040 --> 2:39:40.360]  with a camera can you believe that when i thought i was like kevin are you out of your mind i can
[2:39:40.360 --> 2:39:45.800]  hear kevin right now uh kevin you're on with the free ricky ross good to have you here with us hey
[2:39:45.800 --> 2:39:50.680]  man if i could bring the tear to my eye to hear to hear ricky free and talking to you and everything
[2:39:50.680 --> 2:39:57.480]  like that so it's a really great day kevin tell the story you wrote back with free ricky ross
[2:39:57.480 --> 2:40:04.040]  on the greyhound bus for what 20 hours what was that like 20 hours try practically 48 hours it's
[2:40:04.040 --> 2:40:11.800]  about 30 38 hours um i think ricky chose the bus ride because however long if he flew he would
[2:40:11.800 --> 2:40:15.640]  have only gotten out for for eight hours to go to the halfway house so he choose the bus trip
[2:40:16.280 --> 2:40:22.040]  so he could at least have 36 hours of freedom to go to the halfway house so but i think the last
[2:40:22.040 --> 2:40:27.880]  time i came on your show we were all talking about how ricky had a release date and they weren't
[2:40:27.880 --> 2:40:33.640]  going to hear by it and all the games that they played and uh i heard ricky mention uh congress

[2:41:42.040 --> 2:41:45.880]  you know there's so many questions i've asked ricky and i want ricky to i mean talk more about
[2:41:45.880 --> 2:41:51.720]  his experience in prison before that with the cia uh but kevin any questions you've got for ricky
[2:41:52.280 --> 2:41:57.080]  oh you know not really i mean we we talk all the time but um it just you know once again it just
[2:41:57.080 --> 2:42:01.560]  it just makes me happy to hear ricky on the show finally and and being able to express
[2:42:01.560 --> 2:42:06.440]  himself so well and uh um i just no i know kevin obviously you talk to ricky all the time you
[2:42:06.440 --> 2:42:10.760]  guys are good friends i'm saying any any interesting questions for the radio listeners
[2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:16.680]  well um you know why don't you talk a little bit about the the halfway house experience
[2:42:16.680 --> 2:42:21.240]  and and you know that that whole process that you are forced to go through and how how ridiculous
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:26.760]  that was oh oh yeah that's another one halex they they expect us to go out in the halfway house
[2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:32.520]  you know now every place you go you got to fill out a job application online right you would think
[2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:39.720]  that the halfway house would have computers right yes no no computers no cell phones uh
[2:42:39.720 --> 2:42:45.720]  uh you can only go out at a certain time to look for a job i mean total bs guess how much
[2:42:45.720 --> 2:42:52.440]  they make a day we're holding the inmate 75 dollars taxpayers money and they and they call
[2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:56.840]  these places halfway house it's a total joke i mean my brother was mentally ill and he was in
[2:42:56.840 --> 2:43:01.960]  what i would consider a real halfway house their actual houses when i went to go see this place
[2:43:01.960 --> 2:43:06.680]  that they had ricky and these aren't halfway houses these are like little mini prisons that
[2:43:06.680 --> 2:43:11.160]  are like just scattered all over our neighborhoods i mean this is like a little miniature prison it
[2:43:11.160 --> 2:43:17.640]  was almost like it's like a high school the size of a high school 300 people sleeping there uh in
[2:43:17.640 --> 2:43:21.160]  the just in the middle of a neighborhood you know it's it's incredible this is like a whole
[2:43:21.160 --> 2:43:26.360]  another scam taking place right under our noses and all the research shows i want ricky to speak
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:33.080]  to this just from personal experience that when you put large populations of people in prison
[2:43:33.080 --> 2:43:39.080]  especially for nonviolent crime they become colleges of crime the people now have a record
[2:43:39.080 --> 2:43:44.280]  now they're part of the criminal underworld and this creates more and more crime you know police
[2:43:44.280 --> 2:43:50.040]  always send me emails and say i'm glad we've got more people in prison than china or the whole
[2:43:50.040 --> 2:43:57.480]  e u combined well no i'm not glad because i know that creates a culture of crime ricky absolutely
[2:43:57.480 --> 2:44:01.800]  you take young guys that come in prison and they only was you know buying a thousand dollars
[2:44:01.800 --> 2:44:08.120]  were for drugs now he's with a king fan from columbia or from mexico or with bank robbers
[2:44:08.120 --> 2:44:14.440]  and these older guys they they they feed off of these young kids you know like for me i fed off
[2:44:14.440 --> 2:44:19.400]  of them too but i was trying to teach them the things that i've been through but a lot of times
[2:44:19.400 --> 2:44:23.640]  in prison that doesn't happen that's why they're so concerned right now with terrorism because
[2:44:23.640 --> 2:44:29.800]  they know that they give these young kids so much time alex you know you give a kid 18 19 years old
[2:44:29.800 --> 2:44:37.480]  20 years in prison he's gonna be bitter and it is then i'm sorry and as we discussed in the new
[2:44:37.480 --> 2:44:42.280]  film how we'd won the west there's there's an incarceration rate that actually the government's
[2:44:42.280 --> 2:44:48.120]  own research is shown where when we hit a certain level of incarceration it makes crime rates grow up
[2:44:50.200 --> 2:44:54.760]  which is then more police to control more people to make more money to put more people in the
[2:44:54.760 --> 2:45:02.120]  prisons as the military industrial complex absorbs america ricky ross the naked body scanners they
[2:45:02.120 --> 2:45:06.280]  want to put everybody through at airports recording our naked bodies i mean we're all
[2:45:06.280 --> 2:45:13.720]  being trained to be prisoners absolutely absolutely and and if we don't stop it alex if we don't stop
[2:45:13.720 --> 2:45:19.720]  it we're not going to have any rights you can tap our phones now whenever they want to uh your
[2:45:19.720 --> 2:45:24.760]  friends can come and record you i mean it's it's ridiculous i mean what is what is america coming
[2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:32.360]  to us we've been coming uh harmony it's amazing ricky again how do people support what you're
[2:45:32.360 --> 2:45:38.920]  doing with your community programs well they they can donate money to uh to us at freeway
[2:45:38.920 --> 2:45:46.040]  enterprise dot com they can contact me on there i have my own email address is rick ross r i c k
[2:45:46.040 --> 2:45:52.840]  r o s s 90746 at email dot com uh i definitely need help because i'm trying to start programs
[2:45:52.840 --> 2:45:58.200]  here in south central for the kids uh i also need help with my traveling you know i'm right now
[2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:02.840]  i'm i'm putting it out of my check you know when i go across around the country uh speaking to
[2:46:02.840 --> 2:46:07.800]  kids in different schools we plan on doing a tour here in california where i go to like 20 schools
[2:46:07.800 --> 2:46:12.280]  and you know just just educate the kids and and i would appreciate any help that i can get
[2:46:12.280 --> 2:46:17.320]  and anybody that would like to volunteer to come out to the schools and support uh would be much
[2:46:17.320 --> 2:46:23.560]  appreciated and you're explaining to children that the drug culture is evil and designed to
[2:46:23.560 --> 2:46:29.640]  destroy them correct absolutely and that just because they feel that they're going against the
[2:46:29.640 --> 2:46:35.160]  government by selling drugs is just what the government have in in mind you know they have
[2:46:35.160 --> 2:46:40.520]  us thinking that by selling drugs you're rebelling against the government but that's exactly what
[2:46:40.520 --> 2:46:44.520]  the government wants you to think it's like a reverse psychology thing that they've done to
[2:46:44.520 --> 2:46:48.520]  the kids because most of the kids that get involved with drug considered themselves rebels
[2:46:50.520 --> 2:46:55.640]  absolutely and and in truth you're funding the big banks and you're allowing them to now have a
[2:46:55.640 --> 2:47:00.920]  pretext to control and run your life and destroy your communities and i'd like to do and i and
[2:47:00.920 --> 2:47:05.880]  i've been lucky enough to travel with ricky on at least one of the the trips that he went to
[2:47:05.880 --> 2:47:11.000]  and i just want to say it's uh what an incredible effect he has to go to a place like a detention
[2:47:11.000 --> 2:47:15.000]  center where you've got a bunch of teenagers who they won't listen to anybody but when ricky
[2:47:15.000 --> 2:47:18.920]  walked in the room they definitely all shut up and they they listen to every word he has to say
[2:47:18.920 --> 2:47:28.120]  and it's uh really really uh uh quite moving to see it in person i've got some questions here um
[2:47:28.840 --> 2:47:34.600]  from listeners here's a twitter question ricky what other illegal activities was your cia
[2:47:34.600 --> 2:47:40.120]  supplier involved with to give himself credibility to hook you in i mean how do they keep you from
[2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:52.680]  knowing it was the cia gun hand grenade automatic fully automatic weapons machine gun so the cia
[2:47:52.680 --> 2:47:57.480]  wasn't just bringing in cocaine they were bringing in guns absolutely
[2:47:57.480 --> 2:48:06.520]  unbelievable and then the public gets even more scared and they get to get more police to then
[2:48:06.520 --> 2:48:12.920]  control the public and they got all this firepower you don't remember and then they need more time
[2:48:12.920 --> 2:48:17.240]  remember they they they increased the minimum mandatory well now we need minimum mandatory
[2:48:17.240 --> 2:48:21.080]  so we can put them in prison longer because these guys are more violent than they used to be
[2:48:21.080 --> 2:48:27.160]  well you know that's a gun that's come out in florida the cia was supplying and i and i knew
[2:48:27.160 --> 2:48:33.800]  in texas but so this cia handler and this came out in hearings and in court folks was also supplying
[2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:39.960]  weapons which was they used to sell me weapons didn't they used to have a front is like some sort
[2:48:39.960 --> 2:48:44.920]  of car place or something so some sort of car dealership they had a car dealership they had a
[2:48:44.920 --> 2:48:50.680]  security uh uh thing with a they did security for different different people and you know they had a
[2:48:50.680 --> 2:49:01.160]  bunch of different fronts ricky uh so this whole time you were working for them they kept it secret
[2:49:01.160 --> 2:49:06.840]  that they were cia or did you ever hear that or did you ever wonder you know i never knew i never
[2:49:06.840 --> 2:49:15.320]  had a clue the only thing that i knew alex is that they were fighting a war in their country i
[2:49:15.320 --> 2:49:19.400]  didn't know that i knew that much about it that's what they had told me many times that's why they
[2:49:19.400 --> 2:49:24.920]  sold drugs oh so they admitted to you that they were funding a war in their country right they
[2:49:24.920 --> 2:49:28.600]  admitted that now where the war was that i didn't know that i didn't know anything about nigger
[2:49:28.600 --> 2:49:36.920]  rock what i knew nothing about contra nor the cia at that time did you know how they were getting
[2:49:36.920 --> 2:49:43.720]  the drugs into southern california you know they wouldn't tell me that well you know he was a racist
[2:49:43.720 --> 2:49:52.360]  and a bigot too really oh yeah yeah gary found uh a found a tape that they had where where he said
[2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:57.240]  just like you said you know give it to to the end you know nobody cares what happens to him
[2:49:57.240 --> 2:50:02.120]  you know i believe i think there's that sound bite of of him actually in american drug war
[2:50:02.120 --> 2:50:07.160]  where he says you know i hate i hate the ends but uh they they have a lot they but they deal
[2:50:07.160 --> 2:50:11.800]  in cash so let's let's use them that's exactly what i think you hit it right on here kevin
[2:50:12.920 --> 2:50:18.200]  and again folks you can get american drug war and how the weed won the west at info wars.com

[2:50:29.240 --> 2:50:34.440]  that tape to the jury they let this guy testify against me and said that that tape had absolutely
[2:50:34.440 --> 2:50:42.920]  nothing to do with his testimony him saying we're dealing drugs to the inwards right and don't nobody
[2:50:42.920 --> 2:50:50.280]  care about him and that he didn't like him because i never heard the tape because the judge wouldn't
[2:50:50.280 --> 2:50:55.160]  let us play the tape in court well for 150 years it's been on record that the prostitution the

[2:54:00.440 --> 2:54:23.080]  your life. In two years of his career as one of the biggest drug dealers in US history,
[2:54:23.080 --> 2:54:31.240]  Ricky Ross made $500 million or $500 million conservatively went through his hands and he
[2:54:31.240 --> 2:54:38.760]  was just one of the larger conduits to put it on the street. They only bust the middle size
[2:54:38.760 --> 2:54:46.200]  and small drug dealers. 80 plus percent of illegal drug users only use marijuana. If you
[2:54:46.200 --> 2:54:53.800]  decriminalize that, it wounds their phony drug war that the drug cartels controlled by our government
[2:54:54.440 --> 2:55:03.640]  are taken over the planet with. If you decriminalize, you shut off the CIA's main funding mechanism
[2:55:03.640 --> 2:55:08.440]  and the fake war they're using to take over America. Your comments on that, Ricky Ross.
[2:55:08.440 --> 2:55:19.640]  He's got guys talking to him in the background. Ricky, what would it do to the CIA if we decriminalized
[2:55:19.640 --> 2:55:26.920]  drugs? Oh man, it would take a big bite out of their budget. They couldn't no longer raise funds
[2:55:26.920 --> 2:55:33.320]  that Congress and the rest of the country knows about. With illegal drugs, they can get money
[2:55:33.320 --> 2:55:38.760]  that's non-traceable. Nobody knows where it comes from. Nobody knows that this person was paid off
[2:55:38.760 --> 2:55:44.200]  or that person was paid off. It's just free money. Three weeks ago, Ron Paul gave a speech
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:49.000]  documenting that the CIA has had a coup in America and already runs our country.
[2:55:51.240 --> 2:55:57.800]  I wouldn't doubt that. I believe that that's probably true. I mean, the people are not standing
[2:55:57.800 --> 2:56:04.520]  up until the people take charge. Somebody's going to run it and the people with money,
[2:56:04.520 --> 2:56:09.720]  that's what they want money for. But it's so obvious that criminal elements in government
[2:56:09.720 --> 2:56:14.200]  made drugs illegal because their alcohol prohibition had ended and they wanted a new
[2:56:14.200 --> 2:56:21.560]  black market to take over with. I agree. I totally agree with that and drugs was a perfect venue for
[2:56:21.560 --> 2:56:27.240]  that. And we're now 70 plus years into the drug war and the bigger the drug war gets,
[2:56:27.240 --> 2:56:29.480]  Ricky, the more drugs we got on the street. Why is that?
[2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:35.960]  Well, I mean, it's like this here, Alex. There's no way that they can win this drug war. Drugs,
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:40.920]  if somebody wants to get high, Alex, they're going to get high. You know, a guy, O.D., when I
[2:56:40.920 --> 2:56:46.520]  was in the hole at a maximum security prison, a guy O.D. in the hole, he's in a cell by himself.
[2:56:46.520 --> 2:56:52.040]  No other inmate contact. How did this happen? How could he be in the hole in O.D.?
[2:56:52.040 --> 2:56:57.560]  The jail guards are selling him the drugs. Exactly. Somebody's going to get it to him and
[2:56:57.560 --> 2:57:03.640]  use it to people of authority, which is why they want to keep it illegal. And they want to get
[2:57:03.640 --> 2:57:08.120]  50% of kids, according to the new freedom initiative on Prozac and Ritalin, which are even
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:14.280]  more dangerous than other narcotics. Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, a lot of the drugs that
[2:57:14.280 --> 2:57:19.320]  and it's been proven to that children who take those drugs in an early age will be more susceptible
[2:57:19.320 --> 2:57:24.760]  to becoming addicted to things like crystal meth, cocaine, crack, and on and on. Well,
[2:57:24.760 --> 2:57:29.560]  it's so obvious. And the government is a bunch of drug dealing crooks who want to make us all
[2:57:29.560 --> 2:57:34.440]  drug addicts. The only thing we can do is decriminalize now. Look at Mexico collapsing,
[2:57:34.440 --> 2:57:39.400]  Ricky Ross, because of the drug war. Exactly. And the drug lords run the country
[2:57:40.520 --> 2:57:45.240]  because they have all the money. They're draining all the money out of the economy.
[2:57:45.240 --> 2:57:50.360]  And the same thing has happened in the in America. I mean, the people, the black market
[2:57:50.360 --> 2:57:55.080]  is killing us all the way around. That's how the British, that's how the British brought
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:58:01.160]  down China was bringing drugs in. Yeah, nobody wins from a drug war. I'm totally convinced
[2:58:01.160 --> 2:58:08.680]  of that. It's no way that anybody wins except the authority, the bankers and the bankers.
[2:58:08.680 --> 2:58:15.800]  What are the authority? They're going to continue to push this makes you a war on us
[2:58:15.800 --> 2:58:21.320]  and keep selling the money out of our education system and in all the other places that need
[2:58:21.320 --> 2:58:27.640]  money, they're going to continue to rob them. Ricky, fire out your website for folks. We're

[3:00:15.800 --> 3:00:20.600]  We'll put his website up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers so when they're on the web,
[3:00:20.600 --> 3:00:27.960]  they'll know the bona fide Ricky Ross website. It really is a pop legend and we just appreciate
[3:00:27.960 --> 3:00:32.280]  that he's here with us fighting the New World Order, exposing the drug war for what it is,
[3:00:32.280 --> 3:00:37.160]  because in How We'd Won the West that we're selling at infowars.com, Kevin went and interviewed
[3:00:37.160 --> 3:00:42.200]  street drug dealers that do not want the marijuana dispensaries. They do not want it decriminalized.
[3:00:42.200 --> 3:00:47.400]  The ground level drug dealers, not just the marijuana but other more hardcore drugs,
[3:00:47.400 --> 3:00:52.680]  they want to keep it illegal, don't they, Ricky? Absolutely. I mean, when you start legalizing,
[3:00:52.680 --> 3:00:59.080]  you cut into their money and they don't want that to happen. Kevin, as you were saying earlier,
[3:00:59.080 --> 3:01:05.080]  that 80% of all illegal drug users only smoke marijuana, so if you take all those people
[3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:10.920]  and they start going to these illegal dispensaries, then you're destroying the whole market for all
[3:01:10.920 --> 3:01:18.200]  sides of the fraud. When you take all that money out of it, you also take the violence out,
[3:01:18.200 --> 3:01:22.280]  because most of the violence comes from people trying to rob the people with all the money.
[3:01:23.240 --> 3:01:27.880]  Because it costs so much and they can't legally get it and this is well known,
[3:01:27.880 --> 3:01:33.480]  the British took down China on record by bringing opium in, the government had it illegal,
[3:01:33.480 --> 3:01:37.800]  they brought it in, bought off the cities, took over the whole country and then broke China up
[3:01:37.800 --> 3:01:44.120]  in 11 pieces. The globalists are doing this now. CIA got caught in Vietnam bringing in the opium.
[3:01:44.680 --> 3:01:51.640]  Ricky Ross, look at Afghanistan. Now it's 13 times the previous record level of heroin pouring out
[3:01:51.640 --> 3:01:57.960]  into the world with the CIA and the Pentagon openly protecting it. I saw that on the news a few times
[3:01:57.960 --> 3:02:02.200]  a couple years ago, since we went over and took over the country, that it's gotten worse.
[3:02:02.840 --> 3:02:07.240]  I mean, that's just another example. But now what are we going to do? Are we just going to
[3:02:07.240 --> 3:02:11.000]  sit around? Are our people going to stand up and take the White House back?
[3:02:12.120 --> 3:02:16.520]  Right now here in Los Angeles, they're trying to shut down the thousand legal dispensaries we
[3:02:16.520 --> 3:02:21.080]  have. They're trying to get it down to like 70 or something, which is going to create this incredible
[3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:26.040]  consolidation and make some of the dispensaries, it's going to drive the price. It won't be able
[3:02:26.040 --> 3:02:30.440]  to supply the market and then the illegalness will continue and the crime will continue.
[3:02:30.440 --> 3:02:35.400]  Ricky, you're talking about education too. The hundreds of millions in the fake drug war into
[3:02:35.400 --> 3:02:40.920]  education. Absolutely. I mean, if we educate the people, then they won't need to go out and use
[3:02:40.920 --> 3:02:45.960]  drugs. Most people that use drugs are uneducated. Kevin, you're going to have a screening of how
[3:02:45.960 --> 3:02:51.320]  weed won the West, which isn't out until the 15 ships here on DVD at infowars.com. You are
[3:02:51.320 --> 3:02:56.600]  having a viewing. Tell folks real fast. Right. This is at the Organica dispensary that's actually in
[3:02:56.600 --> 3:03:02.600]  the film. It gets busted in the film. And this is on Saturday, February 13th, around 7 p.m. It's
[3:03:02.600 --> 3:03:10.920]  in Venice Beach on a 13456 Washington Boulevard in Venice, Organica dispensary, February 13th.
[3:03:10.920 --> 3:03:15.800]  All right. And what's worse is these are legal under state law, but the feds come in and beat
[3:03:15.800 --> 3:03:20.280]  them up and smash and then steal the money in the weed and you never even hear where it went.
[3:03:20.280 --> 3:03:25.240]  I mean, the feds are so corrupt and the locals are doing it now. They just openly keep the money.
[3:03:25.240 --> 3:03:31.320]  Yeah. I mean, it's, uh, it's in your face. That's all you could say.
[3:03:31.320 --> 3:03:35.560]  Ricky, last question from your deep research on this. I mean, just experiencing it,
[3:03:35.560 --> 3:03:39.720]  what percentage of cops on average would you say are crooked that are involved in narcotics?
[3:03:39.720 --> 3:03:44.440]  Oh, man, it's so many. You know, my whole task force, you know, I took down 35 crooked cops.
[3:03:44.440 --> 3:03:49.480]  They were robbing us, paying drugs on us. You know, they came up with a game that if they come in
[3:03:49.480 --> 3:03:53.400]  your house and you have a bunch of money, the easiest way to get you not to claim the money is
[3:03:53.400 --> 3:03:57.560]  to plant some drugs on you, you know, because drug dealers had stopped keeping money and drugs in the
[3:03:57.560 --> 3:04:01.800]  same house because they knew that if they didn't have any drugs there, the money was okay.
[3:04:02.600 --> 3:04:06.520]  Yeah. That's something, something we didn't go into is the Ricky Ross task force and the fact
[3:04:06.520 --> 3:04:11.080]  that some of the guys on the Ricky Ross task force are still in jail. Look, look, we're out of time,
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:16.120]  but Ricky, I want to have you back up just to tell some of the incredible war stories and
[3:04:16.120 --> 3:04:20.920]  corrupt, uh, corrupt cop stories that you witness. Can we do that in a month or so?
[3:04:20.920 --> 3:04:24.680]  Um, you, you call me out. Anytime you call me, I'll be there wherever it's that.
[3:04:25.240 --> 3:04:28.600]  Uh, as long as the government let me come, you know, I'm still on parole,
[3:04:28.600 --> 3:04:32.440]  so I have to get permission from them to travel, but, uh, you call me and I'm coming.
[3:04:33.240 --> 3:04:36.920]  We're going to have you back on soon. Kevin's back on next week with some other witnesses
[3:04:36.920 --> 3:04:42.280]  to the drug war freeway enterprise.com. Get how we won the West and American drug war at info

[3:04:56.120 --> 3:04:59.640]  know what I'm saying and put it back the way it's supposed to be. Absolutely. God bless you. We'll

[3:06:02.840 --> 3:06:08.040]  you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[3:06:08.040 --> 3:06:13.000]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much
[3:06:13.000 --> 3:06:18.280]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[3:06:18.280 --> 3:06:23.240]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[3:06:23.240 --> 3:06:28.760]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[3:06:28.760 --> 3:06:33.960]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands
[3:06:33.960 --> 3:06:38.680]  of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[3:06:38.680 --> 3:06:43.160]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[3:06:43.160 --> 3:06:47.880]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information
[3:06:47.880 --> 3:06:54.760]  at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,
[3:06:54.760 --> 3:07:00.280]  so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[3:07:02.520 --> 3:07:06.680]  Hi neighbor, they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[3:07:06.680 --> 3:07:10.360]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was
[3:07:10.360 --> 3:07:15.240]  none left at any price. We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could
[3:07:15.240 --> 3:07:20.280]  care for those unable to care for themselves. We would intend not to be standing in the breadline
[3:07:20.280 --> 3:07:25.240]  with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[3:07:25.240 --> 3:07:30.280]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the breadline may have no bread.
[3:07:30.840 --> 3:07:35.880]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone
[3:07:35.880 --> 3:07:40.680]  to get a supply of food will not feed us. Only getting our food supply immediately
[3:07:40.680 --> 3:07:50.600]  will make us independent and fearless for the future. Call 800-409-5633. 800-409-5633
[3:07:50.600 --> 3:07:56.120]  on the web, efoodsdirect.com. Who am I? Some of who cares.
[3:07:56.120 --> 3:08:07.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines,
[3:08:07.000 --> 3:08:12.680]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:15.080 --> 3:08:21.960]  We are going to plumb the depths of evil, the mindset of the elite. They don't just bring
[3:08:21.960 --> 3:08:27.000]  the narcotics in. They don't just push Ritalin and Prozac and other deadly drugs on kids and
[3:08:27.000 --> 3:08:33.400]  pregnant women and dangerous vaccines. They revel in corruption. They revel in who can be the most
[3:08:34.040 --> 3:08:37.240]  wicked, the most evil, the most psychopathic, the most sociopathic.
[3:08:38.040 --> 3:08:42.280]  Depleted uranium is used at proving sites all over the United States and all over the world.
[3:08:43.320 --> 3:08:49.560]  It's now being used in even smaller rifle munitions, not just Abrams tank Sabo rounds or
[3:08:49.560 --> 3:08:57.640]  Vulcan warthog cannons in ATINs or in Hellfire missiles. It's being put into most munitions now
[3:08:58.360 --> 3:09:03.480]  and the troops are dying. They've known for decades. It's causing deformities,
[3:09:03.480 --> 3:09:08.680]  just like they knew in secret reports that have been declassified recently in the 60s that Agent
[3:09:08.680 --> 3:09:13.640]  Orange was going to literally fry the testicles of men and make them have deformed children.
[3:09:13.640 --> 3:09:19.960]  And I mean, this is what's going on. We're going to talk to Dr. Doug Rocky here in a moment who
[3:09:19.960 --> 3:09:26.600]  literally wrote the Army manuals for them on DU. They know what they're doing. They don't care about
[3:09:26.600 --> 3:09:30.840]  our troops. They say caring about the troops is putting them in all these fraudulent wars.
[3:09:30.840 --> 3:09:34.680]  So I want to get into what DU is doing. The Iraqi government suing the U.S. over this
[3:09:35.240 --> 3:09:38.680]  and we haven't talked to Dr. Rocky in over a year. I want to get all the latest developments
[3:09:38.680 --> 3:09:45.000]  from him. Before we go to Dr. Doug Rocky for the balance of the hour, I want to go over some of
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:09:49.320]  the sponsors that have made this radio show possible and who I really believe in. One of them
[3:09:49.320 --> 3:09:55.400]  is a Kola blue, a Kola blue dot com and they have great atmospheric water generators, big ones that
[3:09:55.400 --> 3:09:59.880]  could supply hundreds or even thousands of people, little ones that do seven and a half, eight gallons
[3:09:59.880 --> 3:10:04.280]  a day, a Kola blue 30, a Kola blue 28. They've already shipped one of their giant units and a
[3:10:04.280 --> 3:10:10.760]  bunch of small ones with a convoy of hope to Haiti. 20% of your purchase goes towards that.
[3:10:10.760 --> 3:10:15.080]  Check out a Kola blue atmospheric water generators today. The cleanest, best water.
[3:10:16.040 --> 3:10:21.400]  Their 28 has seven filters on it. Reverse osmosis carbon keeps it in the stainless steel tank,
[3:10:21.400 --> 3:10:26.200]  grabs it out of the air. The Kola blue 30 has 12 filters. They've got a bunch of special deals
[3:10:26.200 --> 3:10:35.720]  running a Kola blue dot com or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043. Another sponsor is eatfoodsdirect.com,
[3:10:35.720 --> 3:10:43.400]  the highest quality, storable foods available bar none. They have ready to eat gourmet style meals,
[3:10:43.400 --> 3:10:49.000]  non GMO. They have organic food lines. They have just so many. This is the place to get food and
[3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:52.920]  they make it new every month. You know, this stuff's usually just a few weeks old when you get it,
[3:10:52.920 --> 3:10:58.920]  uh, the max a month. I mean, this is the big dog. This is the quality people. I did research for
[3:10:58.920 --> 3:11:03.080]  my own preparedness because I don't trust the system for the depression and the rest of it. And
[3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:07.000]  this is who I went with and this is who I'm happy with because I tried some others didn't like it.
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:15.560]  Eatfoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633, call them get a free catalog, 800-409-5633.
[3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:22.360]  And finally, I want to plug frontsite.com like the front of your rifle. It's not enough to
[3:11:22.360 --> 3:11:25.960]  have a bunch of ammo and guns to protect yourself from criminals and government and
[3:11:25.960 --> 3:11:30.440]  all the stuff that's going on. You need to be trained and it's out in front, Nevada.
[3:11:30.440 --> 3:11:35.080]  It's the biggest private farms training facility, no drill instructor, tough guy attitudes.
[3:11:35.080 --> 3:11:41.000]  It's family and it's frontsite.com. You can get five days of world-class gun training,
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:47.080]  very inexpensive and secure a 30-stake concealed weapons permit and get a free spring-filled
[3:11:47.080 --> 3:11:53.560]  armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice, frontsite.com. That's frontsite.com. Okay.
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:12:03.320]  Going to Dr. Doug Rocky. What this evil system does is it uses its authority of the government
[3:12:03.320 --> 3:12:08.360]  and the system to do outrageous things and then just set the precedent. Government's caught drug
[3:12:08.360 --> 3:12:13.640]  dealing literally thousands of times. The drug war continues. But though people are starting to wake up,
[3:12:13.640 --> 3:12:19.320]  the government's caught engaged in all forms of corruption. The banks are robbing as they just
[3:12:19.320 --> 3:12:26.760]  continue. The vaccine makers are caught maiming people. The corruption continues. The DU being
[3:12:26.760 --> 3:12:33.240]  used all over the world now and improving grounds all over the U.S. So incredibly deadly and they
[3:12:33.240 --> 3:12:38.120]  knew in the late 40s, it was deadly. They knew in the 80s and in the early 90s when Dr. Doug Rocky
[3:12:38.120 --> 3:12:44.680]  wrote the book, the manual for the Pentagon of the Army, they knew how deadly it was. And now they
[3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:49.960]  just say, look, when we attack a military base in Iraq or somewhere, we move troops in a week later,
[3:12:49.960 --> 3:12:55.000]  have them move right in next to blast points with the DU. We have people without protective gear,
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:59.320]  clearing up tanks and stuff we've destroyed with it, knowing it's going to really hurt them.
[3:12:59.320 --> 3:13:05.000]  And it's hurt Dr. Rocky. Many of his colleagues have died just involved in studying this stuff
[3:13:05.000 --> 3:13:11.160]  and in cleanups. So this gives you a window into the minds of the controllers. Dr. Doug Rocky is
[3:13:11.160 --> 3:13:17.320]  a depleted uranium expert, a BS in physics at the Western Illinois University, followed by his MS
[3:13:17.320 --> 3:13:21.640]  and PhD in physics and technology education, University of Illinois. His military career
[3:13:21.640 --> 3:13:26.760]  has spent four decades to include combat duty during Vietnam and Gulf War one. He served as a
[3:13:26.760 --> 3:13:32.200]  member of the third U.S. Army medical commands, nuclear biological, chemical teaching, medical
[3:13:32.200 --> 3:13:37.080]  response and special operations team. Third U.S. Army captured equipment project team with the
[3:13:37.080 --> 3:13:42.760]  third U.S. Army, the uranium assessment team, Gulf War, Operation Desert Storm. This thing's
[3:13:42.760 --> 3:13:48.040]  five pages long folks. He was the U.S. Army's depleted uranium project director from 94 to 95.
[3:13:48.040 --> 3:13:52.280]  He developed the congressional mandated education training manuals and wrote the U.S. Army regulation
[3:13:52.280 --> 3:14:00.040]  700 dash 48, the U.S. Army PAM 700 dash 48 and the U.S. Army's command task for DU incidents.
[3:14:00.040 --> 3:14:04.600]  He is the DU expert and they won't even allow the manuals to be given to officers and troops.
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:10.120]  They march them in to die. That's who your government is. So don't give me when I'm against
[3:14:10.120 --> 3:14:14.760]  new wars that I don't care about the troops. Killing our troops isn't taking care of them.
[3:14:14.760 --> 3:14:19.720]  And the murderers that run this system, wrap themselves in our troops heroism. I'm sorry
[3:14:19.720 --> 3:14:24.120]  I'm ranting Dr. Rocky and I want you to give out the websites. I mean, I literally didn't even get
[3:14:24.120 --> 3:14:30.520]  into your bio here. There's so much, but just to watch this evil set the precedent and I mean,
[3:14:30.520 --> 3:14:37.640]  what is it like for you to see this, the use of DU going wild? Well, I mean, it's a continuous thing
[3:14:37.640 --> 3:14:43.640]  considering that the United States Army friendly fire casualties from Operation Desert Storm
[3:14:44.200 --> 3:14:48.360]  who became casualties as a direct result, the use of uranium mission
[3:14:48.360 --> 3:14:54.840]  fired by military personnel against our own military personnel to this day have still not
[3:14:54.840 --> 3:15:00.600]  got the medical care that I ordered as a theater health business that was ordered by the theater
[3:15:00.600 --> 3:15:07.160]  medical commander, then General D. Z. Zulison Desert Storm 1991. And it's still not being provided.
[3:15:07.160 --> 3:15:13.560]  And today what bothers me the most is General Erikson Sekhi is now the secretary of the U.S.
[3:15:13.560 --> 3:15:18.840]  Department of Veteran Affairs. He wrote the original order mandated medical care environment
[3:15:18.840 --> 3:15:24.120]  cleanup and training in 1993. He signed the Army regulation that I wrote that you already quoted
[3:15:24.760 --> 3:15:30.840]  and we're not getting the care that we earned. It's real simple. They just do not want to provide
[3:15:30.840 --> 3:15:35.800]  medical care to U.S. military personnel because you have to understand the million are so casually
[3:15:35.800 --> 3:15:41.160]  we have now from the nonsense of the Persian Gulf are not as a result of bullets and bombs.
[3:15:41.160 --> 3:15:47.480]  They are the result of parking exposures, primarily uranium emissions, oil, well fires,
[3:15:47.480 --> 3:15:52.200]  pesticides, hazardous materials, and everything else. And blowing up Camicia,
[3:15:52.200 --> 3:15:57.240]  the one of the biggest chemical weapons dumps in the world, and they know and they just don't care.
[3:15:57.240 --> 3:16:01.960]  But you have to understand Camicia was only one that we blew up. We blew up 105 of them.
[3:16:01.960 --> 3:16:06.600]  We made the decision to blow up all the chemical and biological weapons facilities that Iraq possessed
[3:16:06.600 --> 3:16:13.720]  in December of 1990. And that was because we, the U.S. military, and specifically the U.S.
[3:16:13.720 --> 3:16:19.880]  Army gave them anthrax, weaponized anthrax. So we had destroyed the place. And if anybody has
[3:16:19.880 --> 3:16:23.880]  any question as whether or not we did it or not, all they have to do is go to General Norman
[3:16:23.880 --> 3:16:28.920]  Schwarzkopf autobiography. It doesn't take a hero and go to page 390 and read about it.
[3:16:29.560 --> 3:16:32.360]  The arrogance of these guys is beyond comprehension.
[3:16:32.360 --> 3:16:38.040]  And then they did the brain studies from the chemical weapons, killing troops in mass.
[3:16:38.040 --> 3:16:41.560]  When you talk about a million casualties, break that down for us.
[3:16:42.280 --> 3:16:47.400]  Well, when we look at a million casualties, what we are seeing, that's right now, for example,
[3:16:47.400 --> 3:16:53.560]  CBS News 60 Minutes did a story on this on January 3rd. And they, you know, they broadcasted it.
[3:16:53.560 --> 3:16:58.040]  And Paul, God bless Paul Sullivan from Betra Common Concern, you know, Common Sense,
[3:16:58.040 --> 3:17:03.720]  he was the one that pushed that through. But what CBS News 60 Minutes confirmed on January 3rd,
[3:17:03.720 --> 3:17:11.320]  in their story was, delay, deny, and wait till I die. In other words, what we will do,
[3:17:11.320 --> 3:17:15.800]  the military and the Department of Defense and the VA will do, will deny any correlation between
[3:17:15.800 --> 3:17:19.800]  all the adverse health and environmental effects from all these toxic exposures,
[3:17:19.800 --> 3:17:25.720]  specifically uranium emissions. Deny medical care for it, delay any treatment that you do get,
[3:17:25.720 --> 3:17:31.720]  if you are lucky to get it, and just wait till you die. And the number of family members
[3:17:32.440 --> 3:17:37.480]  and everybody else and the soldiers involved and everybody, they never stopped calling for help.
[3:17:37.480 --> 3:17:43.000]  It's every day, it never stopped. And the deformities of the troops, their children,
[3:17:43.000 --> 3:17:50.360]  the deformities of the Iraqis, the Serbs, the Afghans. And I know you've got the numbers on this,
[3:17:50.360 --> 3:17:56.520]  but is it not an exponential increase year to year in the amount of DU being served out by
[3:17:56.520 --> 3:18:01.560]  armories? Incredible amount. I mean, the United States gives us stuff away to anybody and everybody
[3:18:01.560 --> 3:18:06.440]  that will take it, and then we use it against all known targets. I mean, during Desert Storm,
[3:18:06.440 --> 3:18:11.160]  we use it against the armor effectively, all the tanks and the trucks and everything else.
[3:18:11.160 --> 3:18:16.120]  But we also shot up the bunkers and everything else. And then with Operate, when we went into
[3:18:16.120 --> 3:18:22.360]  the Balkans in 1994, we shot up buildings and everything. Again, in the Balkans in 1991, this
[3:18:22.360 --> 3:18:28.280]  is in the old U.S. lobby, and Pekta Abiso, who was head of the United Nations, he actually told
[3:18:28.280 --> 3:18:32.920]  the U.S. Department of Defense to clean up all of these facilities they shot up. And then we
[3:18:32.920 --> 3:18:38.280]  continued Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Iraq. We have literally,
[3:18:38.280 --> 3:18:42.600]  with uranium emissions, and I've got total video, total reports, we've got all of this stuff,
[3:18:42.600 --> 3:18:49.080]  no questions photographed, shot up apartment buildings, hospitals, water treatment facilities,
[3:18:49.080 --> 3:18:54.200]  sewage sanitation plants, plus all the, you know, cars and trucks you could ever imagine.
[3:18:54.760 --> 3:18:59.400]  And this stuff is so extraordinarily effective. They talked about it originally when it was
[3:18:59.400 --> 3:19:03.800]  used for armor, but it's far more effective against a conventional house or an apartment building
[3:19:03.800 --> 3:19:12.520]  or a water facility than it is against a tank, because if there ain't any tanks left to shoot.
[3:19:12.520 --> 3:19:16.600]  And then our troops move into the areas they've blown to bits.
[3:19:16.600 --> 3:19:21.000]  That's correct. Our troops move in, and then they're not even provided the mandatory
[3:19:21.000 --> 3:19:25.320]  respiratory and skin protection that is required by the U.S. Army Regulation,
[3:19:25.320 --> 3:19:30.040]  and the U.S. technical bulletin provides all the specifications. But more important,
[3:19:30.040 --> 3:19:33.800]  the fact that our Department of Defense, the British Ministry of Defense,
[3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:37.560]  the Canadians and the Australians and the Israelis, I mean, you have to understand,
[3:19:37.560 --> 3:19:43.320]  those are the five countries that use it. They use it without hesitation, completely and totally
[3:19:43.320 --> 3:19:48.760]  disregard what the specifications are. Stay there, Dr. Rocky. I mean, basically,
[3:19:48.760 --> 3:19:52.280]  you might as well, after our troops have had a war, line them all up and shoot them.
[3:19:52.280 --> 3:19:57.160]  And that's the equivalent of this. But when they come home and die, all the people singing,
[3:19:57.160 --> 3:20:00.840]  God bless America, they don't want to talk to them. Just get in the coffin, shut up and die.
[3:20:27.800 --> 3:20:32.840]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information
[3:20:32.840 --> 3:20:38.280]  you need to do it yourself for free. Herb K was right. His free information helped me stop the

[3:21:02.600 --> 3:21:08.200]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance
[3:21:08.200 --> 3:21:13.800]  to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath
[3:21:13.800 --> 3:21:19.880]  Americans at home. We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really
[3:21:19.880 --> 3:21:26.280]  are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:21:26.280 --> 3:21:31.720]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[3:21:31.720 --> 3:21:36.360]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:21:36.360 --> 3:21:40.920]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is
[3:21:40.920 --> 3:21:45.560]  saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in
[3:21:45.560 --> 3:21:52.120]  Washington D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic

[3:22:02.120 --> 3:22:06.600]  Peter Krauss novel here from Midas Resources. Are you concerned about uncontrollable government
[3:22:06.600 --> 3:22:12.520]  spending, a banking system on the verge of collapse, banks on the edge of being nationalized,
[3:22:12.520 --> 3:22:17.800]  Wall Street and continuous freefall? Scandal after scandal with hedge funds companies?
[3:22:17.800 --> 3:22:23.240]  If protecting your hard earned savings or retirement fund is on your mind, the answer is simple.
[3:22:23.240 --> 3:22:28.600]  Secure your assets by purchasing gold and silver. Since President Nixon took us off the gold standard
[3:22:28.600 --> 3:22:34.040]  in 1971, the United States has been operating the longest running fiat currency in the history of
[3:22:34.040 --> 3:22:40.840]  mankind. Gold has held its purchasing power for over 6,000 years. Contact me, Peter Krauss novel

[3:24:04.680 --> 3:24:08.440]  We're not going to open the phones up for Dr. Doug Rocky. The best way for you to send your
[3:24:08.440 --> 3:24:15.400]  questions is twitter.com forward slash the real Alex Jones. That's our Twitter account. There's
[3:24:15.400 --> 3:24:20.360]  a lot of other great Alex Jones fan sites, but that's our official Twitter account also. Yeah,
[3:24:20.360 --> 3:24:24.600]  real Alex Jones, not the real Alex Jones. So twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones.
[3:24:25.400 --> 3:24:29.640]  Going back to Dr. Doug Rocky, one of the top experts in the world on DU, even according to
[3:24:29.640 --> 3:24:36.520]  the Pentagon, who he worked for. Dr. Rocky, let's talk about the real health effects and the studies
[3:24:36.520 --> 3:24:41.560]  and what they've known DU does. And now it's a toxic byproduct of spent fuel rods from nuclear
[3:24:41.560 --> 3:24:46.760]  reactors. But more importantly, I want to ask you now about the mindset of the elite. I mean,
[3:24:46.760 --> 3:24:51.960]  they had DU in the 40s and 50s, and I saw papers where they talked about it as a weapon, and they
[3:24:51.960 --> 3:24:56.360]  said we can't use it because it kills our own personnel and people that move into the areas.
[3:24:56.360 --> 3:25:02.440]  What changed in the mindset where they wouldn't use it in the 50s, 60s, and 70s? And now it's just,
[3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:07.080]  we're going to use it at local shooting ranges for the military. We're going to use it in Hawaii.
[3:25:07.080 --> 3:25:11.640]  We're going to use it in Puerto Rico. We're going to tell the troops it's okay and watch them die.
[3:25:11.640 --> 3:25:17.080]  I mean, this is psychopathic murder. Yes, it is. It's just the fact that they made the decision
[3:25:17.080 --> 3:25:23.800]  that human life had no value, that animals had no value, that food has no value. And they just made
[3:25:23.800 --> 3:25:28.360]  a conscious decision, and I've been fighting this since I did all the research for them,
[3:25:28.360 --> 3:25:33.800]  that I've had a test site and broke the directives. They just don't care. But as you said,
[3:25:33.800 --> 3:25:37.400]  the health and environmental effects of all this have always been known. I mean,
[3:25:37.400 --> 3:25:41.720]  my own medical care for my depleted uranium exposure is because of my assigned duties.
[3:25:41.720 --> 3:25:47.480]  One of the things I forced it with was the original 1973 report on the use of uranium
[3:25:47.480 --> 3:25:53.160]  emissions by Israelis against the Egyptians in the Sinai. And all of that stuff was known then.
[3:25:53.160 --> 3:25:56.840]  It was documented there in the official reports. Again, these are not classified,
[3:25:57.480 --> 3:26:02.440]  but they just totally there, and they totally ignored. Prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom and
[3:26:02.440 --> 3:26:08.760]  Enduring Freedom, Colonel J. Edgar Wakiama, who's the director of the Department of Defense
[3:26:08.760 --> 3:26:13.480]  Operational Test and Evaluation Command, gave a briefing to all the senior generals and everybody
[3:26:13.480 --> 3:26:18.440]  in the Pentagon upon depleted uranium, how it works, what it is, the fact that the munitions,
[3:26:18.440 --> 3:26:22.760]  as you said, go all the way down to the M16 rifle, 50 cal, everything all the way up.
[3:26:23.400 --> 3:26:28.600]  But in this briefing, he stated very specifically, I'm going to quote very, very specifically,
[3:26:28.600 --> 3:26:39.800]  depleted uranium munitions, when used. Okay. They emit alpha, beta, and gamma particle next race.
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:44.840]  The alpha particle taken inside the body in large doses, this hazard is producing
[3:26:44.840 --> 3:26:52.680]  cell damage and cancer. Quote, lung cancer is well documented. We continue on. Beta
[3:26:52.680 --> 3:26:56.920]  particle, it's hazardous to the skin and the lens of the eye. Now personally, I've learned that
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:01.080]  because of all my radiation cataracts and the other problems with the eyes and everybody else
[3:27:01.080 --> 3:27:08.280]  is reporting it. It continues on very, very, quote, I mean, very, very direct. And it says,
[3:27:08.840 --> 3:27:15.640]  D, was chemically toxic. We look at all the stuff. We have total confirmation. Quote,
[3:27:15.640 --> 3:27:21.080]  urine samples containing uranium are mutagenic as determined by the Ames test. The culture of human
[3:27:21.080 --> 3:27:26.760]  stem bone cell line with D, you also transform the cells that become carcinogenic. That's the
[3:27:26.760 --> 3:27:32.120]  reason why we're seeing so incredible levels. I mean, incredible levels, leukemia. And these,
[3:27:32.120 --> 3:27:36.920]  all these young kids coming back from desert storm, but we're also seeing leukemia in the
[3:27:36.920 --> 3:27:42.040]  children, the offspring of those who were exposed during deserts. Because just like fluoride,
[3:27:42.040 --> 3:27:47.160]  the particle so small, doctor, correct me if I'm wrong, it precipitates into the bone.
[3:27:47.160 --> 3:27:51.320]  That's correct. There is nothing, there is no respiratory skin protection that'll work.
[3:27:51.880 --> 3:27:55.960]  Even though when we did all this work for the military, the department of energy gave us their
[3:27:55.960 --> 3:28:00.360]  best respirators. The army gave us their best respirators. It went through it like an open
[3:28:00.360 --> 3:28:06.040]  barn door. It absolutely does it. One of the big problems, quote from the Wachiyama briefing,
[3:28:06.040 --> 3:28:10.600]  I'm going to read this because it's astonishing. They know and they disregard it. The three major
[3:28:10.600 --> 3:28:16.840]  rocks of human exposure to D are wounding by shrapnel, inhalation, lungs and thoracic, lymph
[3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:23.960]  nodes, ingestions, most among children, plain and contaminated soil, and contaminated drink
[3:28:23.960 --> 3:28:29.320]  of water and food in the community, end quote. That is what we're seeing throughout Iraq.
[3:28:29.320 --> 3:28:34.600]  And that's from what year? Pardon me. What year was that report? This is a briefing to the
[3:28:34.600 --> 3:28:39.960]  senior Pentagon leadership in 2002 before the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Endurance.
[3:28:39.960 --> 3:28:43.240]  And again, I'm going from memory interviewing you and others and reading mainstream news,
[3:28:43.240 --> 3:28:48.600]  but I saw reports in the 50s. It was a secret weapon they were only going to use of the Russians,
[3:28:48.600 --> 3:28:53.240]  flooded into Eastern Europe, but they said we still don't advise because it ruins
[3:28:53.240 --> 3:29:00.280]  the area for billions of years. I mean, they know this. It's just so incredible. And they know,
[3:29:00.840 --> 3:29:04.920]  I mean, I see the numbers of troops coming back and dropping dead and getting cancer
[3:29:04.920 --> 3:29:09.640]  and getting leukemia and other blood cancers. And they know it's killing them. I mean, this is,
[3:29:09.640 --> 3:29:16.440]  we ought to make all these generals go into the proving grounds and snort a line of DU if it's
[3:29:16.440 --> 3:29:20.840]  so good. When I specifically talked to the generals from Washington D.C. as I've done in the last
[3:29:20.840 --> 3:29:25.560]  few weeks, and asked them very specifically for help and getting medical care, environmental
[3:29:25.560 --> 3:29:29.960]  remediation, they just say, go to your kind, spend a senator, we're not going to help you.
[3:29:32.600 --> 3:29:37.160]  And I noticed those troops troops have told me enough saying the news that generals won't stay
[3:29:37.160 --> 3:29:41.080]  in these bombed out buildings like they tell the troops to. And notice none of these generals
[3:29:41.080 --> 3:29:45.640]  want to stay in Iraq very long. Dr. Rocky Long segment coming up, roll through the documents
[3:29:45.640 --> 3:29:49.960]  for people because all you folks out there that claim you love the troops so much and stick American
[3:29:49.960 --> 3:29:58.360]  flags on your car. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:01.800 --> 3:30:06.440]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[3:30:06.440 --> 3:30:11.160]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[3:30:11.160 --> 3:30:16.520]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only
[3:30:16.520 --> 3:30:21.560]  ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When
[3:30:21.560 --> 3:30:26.200]  will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will
[3:30:26.200 --> 3:30:30.760]  it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the
[3:30:30.760 --> 3:30:36.360]  gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:30:36.360 --> 3:30:41.800]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[3:30:41.800 --> 3:30:47.240]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live
[3:30:47.240 --> 3:30:56.280]  to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again,
[3:30:56.280 --> 3:31:06.840]  that number 1-800-409-5633. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:31:06.840 --> 3:31:11.560]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[3:31:12.360 --> 3:31:15.960]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've determined the
[3:31:15.960 --> 3:31:21.640]  members' influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think
[3:31:21.640 --> 3:31:28.280]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies
[3:31:28.280 --> 3:31:34.120]  the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty,
[3:31:34.120 --> 3:31:39.080]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're
[3:31:39.080 --> 3:31:43.400]  asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today
[3:31:43.400 --> 3:31:49.240]  seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the
[3:31:49.240 --> 3:31:56.520]  Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right
[3:31:56.520 --> 3:32:04.360]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear
[3:32:04.360 --> 3:32:09.320]  their government, there is tyranny. When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[3:32:09.320 --> 3:32:14.200]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives
[3:32:14.200 --> 3:32:19.720]  and our family's health, are in jeopardy. If we the people do not diligently assert these rights,
[3:32:19.720 --> 3:32:25.080]  they may be taken away and lost forever. Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom,
[3:32:25.080 --> 3:32:30.280]  and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter, sitting passively by,
[3:32:30.280 --> 3:32:35.080]  and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[3:32:35.080 --> 3:32:40.280]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight. Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective

[3:32:59.320 --> 3:33:16.920]  We had Dr. Wolfgang Wodrog in the second hour of the radio show today.
[3:33:17.880 --> 3:33:22.920]  Right at the start of the show, we had Judge Andrew Napolitano on government stage terror attacks,
[3:33:22.920 --> 3:33:29.400]  and a lot more. We had Free Ricky Ross on CIA drug dealing, and then Dr. Doug Rocky. So when this
[3:33:29.400 --> 3:33:35.960]  show ends in T-minus 26 and a half minutes, the restreams at infowars.com will have Judge Andrew
[3:33:35.960 --> 3:33:42.280]  Napolitano and more coming up. And that was powerful, and I covered all the neocons telling
[3:33:42.280 --> 3:33:47.720]  Obama, we need a new war to get your approval rating up. We need new stage terror attacks.
[3:33:47.720 --> 3:33:54.600]  I mean, what a bizarre headline out of Philadelphia Daily News. One month after the anniversary,
[3:33:54.600 --> 3:34:01.240]  I'm thinking about another 9-11 would help America. I mean, that's Stu Baikovsky. These are bizarre
[3:34:01.240 --> 3:34:07.800]  people right out in the open. Now, I got cut off by the break. I usually nail it, but I went over.
[3:34:07.800 --> 3:34:11.480]  I was trying to make the point that all these people that stick stickers on their cars and
[3:34:11.480 --> 3:34:15.960]  talk about how much they love the trips, they just like to go to football games,
[3:34:15.960 --> 3:34:20.680]  put their hand on their heart and cry. And to them, patriotisms, more wars, more death,
[3:34:20.680 --> 3:34:27.720]  more tyranny, more enslavement. I mean, it must be because DU is well known. It's killing our
[3:34:27.720 --> 3:34:33.560]  sons and daughters. It's killing the people, the innocent people. We bomb with it years after.
[3:34:33.560 --> 3:34:38.200]  Dr. Rocky, I mean, what's the half-life of depleted uranium? How long is it deadly?
[3:34:39.320 --> 3:34:43.720]  Longer than the age of the earth. I mean, one half-life is 4.5 billion years, and you have to
[3:34:43.720 --> 3:34:48.680]  go through 10 half-lifes, so that's 45 billion years. Even think about it being safe radiologically.
[3:34:48.680 --> 3:34:55.320]  So 45 billion years, and last number I had was at least 10 proving grounds in the U.S.
[3:34:55.320 --> 3:34:58.840]  are using this just all over the place, and they've just gotten to the point where they
[3:34:58.840 --> 3:35:02.520]  don't even tell the troops there's any danger. That's correct, but one of the most, and we've
[3:35:02.520 --> 3:35:08.760]  talked about this before, on the 18th of April of 75, hardly a man has left alive. Our nation was
[3:35:08.760 --> 3:35:16.360]  born in Concord, Massachusetts in 1775. Concord, Massachusetts is the site of the starmet depleted
[3:35:16.360 --> 3:35:21.480]  uranium addition plant that's been closed, and it has incredible environmental and medical
[3:35:21.480 --> 3:35:27.640]  disasters as a consequence of that. And when you look at what's happened, it goes back and again,
[3:35:27.640 --> 3:35:32.520]  here is the direct quote from the Waukeama briefing for the emerging environmental concerns,
[3:35:32.520 --> 3:35:38.760]  the quote, a significant exposure to depleted uranium on children's planet impact sites by
[3:35:38.760 --> 3:35:45.080]  adjusting heavily contaminated soil, slowly to the depleted uranium in the local water supply
[3:35:45.080 --> 3:35:50.680]  for years, and consuming depleted uranium-contaminated food and sources, animals, and plants, end quote.
[3:35:51.560 --> 3:35:58.360]  So with all of these things, if we know what's going to happen, if you're an injured, ill-wounded
[3:35:58.360 --> 3:36:03.160]  veteran, or you've got cross-contaminated from the stuff being brought back to the United States or
[3:36:03.160 --> 3:36:08.680]  Europe, wherever you are, you cross-contaminate your family, the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs
[3:36:08.680 --> 3:36:14.680]  in vision 11, this is the region here that takes to East Central Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio,
[3:36:15.400 --> 3:36:21.320]  the director, Barbara Hyde, who totally, totally acknowledges that both these, and I'm going to
[3:36:21.320 --> 3:36:25.640]  quote this exactly, read it exactly, some of the physical symptoms which occur as a result of
[3:36:25.640 --> 3:36:33.080]  exposure to depleted uranium are sleep problems, mood swings, symptoms in upper and lower respiratory
[3:36:33.080 --> 3:36:39.560]  system, neuropsychological symptoms, including memory loss, chronic fatigue, immune dysfunction
[3:36:39.560 --> 3:36:46.440]  syndrome, skin rashes, unusual hair loss, aching joints, headaches, abdominal pain, sensitivity
[3:36:46.440 --> 3:36:52.040]  to light, LERD vision, menstrual disorders, gastrointestinal symptoms, reoccurrent diarrhea,
[3:36:52.040 --> 3:36:58.120]  constipation, nervous systems, disorientations, numbness in a limb, multiple chemical sensitivity,
[3:36:58.120 --> 3:37:06.600]  and birth defects in children whose parents were exposed, end quote. It's that, I mean, within
[3:37:06.600 --> 3:37:11.400]  their own documents, they thoroughly, totally acknowledge it, okay? And Dr. Rocky, what about
[3:37:11.400 --> 3:37:18.200]  all the mainstream reports I've seen of radiation detectors worldwide, especially during a new war,
[3:37:18.200 --> 3:37:23.080]  picking it up in the atmosphere? That is absolutely correct. Dr. Chris Busby,
[3:37:23.080 --> 3:37:28.760]  Professor Chris Busby in England, who is probably one of the world's leading, if not the world's
[3:37:28.760 --> 3:37:34.040]  leading experts on low-level radioactivity, thoroughly confirmed that the contamination
[3:37:34.040 --> 3:37:39.480]  from the Middle East reached Northern Europe and England, thoroughly confirmed it without
[3:37:39.480 --> 3:37:45.560]  any question whatsoever. And so we're seeing all of this stuff. And as a consequence from all of
[3:37:45.560 --> 3:37:50.840]  this, okay? We have to come back to the requirements for the Department of the Defense. General
[3:37:50.840 --> 3:37:56.840]  Erick Shinseki, when he was a commanding general, signed and mandated US Army Regulation 700-48
[3:37:56.840 --> 3:38:03.800]  that I wrote, my team wrote. He, in this regulation, what it required, quote,
[3:38:05.640 --> 3:38:10.760]  during peacetime or as soon as operational risk permits, the core Joint Task Force Division
[3:38:10.760 --> 3:38:16.520]  Commanders Radiation Safety Officer will identify, segregate, isolate, secure, and label all
[3:38:16.520 --> 3:38:21.400]  radioactivity contaminated equipment. Procedures to minimize the spread of activity will be
[3:38:21.400 --> 3:38:28.440]  implemented as soon as, you know, immediately, as soon as possible. We continue on this stuff.
[3:38:28.440 --> 3:38:33.000]  The requirement is to take care of all the explosives and all of the hands, material stuff
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:38.680]  that must be done. But when we come on down to the real fundamental stuff on handling all of this
[3:38:38.680 --> 3:38:45.240]  stuff, okay? Every individual in the Army has responsibility to do it properly and in the
[3:38:45.240 --> 3:38:51.160]  personnel well. Quote, all equipment to include capture, combat, relapse, parametri, equipment
[3:38:51.160 --> 3:38:56.120]  will be surveyed, packaged, retrograded, decontaminated, and released in accordance with
[3:38:56.120 --> 3:39:02.920]  detectives of both the 9-13-10278, the Army pamphlet, 700-48, which is procedures manual
[3:39:02.920 --> 3:39:07.080]  and other relevant guides. But they don't do that. They don't follow their own rules.
[3:39:07.080 --> 3:39:11.160]  They don't follow their own rules at all. And the other thing, too, that bothers me the most,
[3:39:11.160 --> 3:39:14.120]  and this has happened over and over again, because they're doing this in the United States,
[3:39:14.120 --> 3:39:18.600]  just burning and blowing it up and whatever. Quote, radioactive material and waste will
[3:39:18.600 --> 3:39:23.240]  not be locally disposed of through burial, submersion, incineration, and destruction
[3:39:23.240 --> 3:39:27.960]  or a place of abandonment. And they just do it continuously without any hesitation.
[3:39:29.960 --> 3:39:34.680]  So really, you have the nuclear weapons and nuclear power plant industry, and they're just
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:42.120]  seeding their waste everywhere that has a 40-plus-million-year half-life. People thousands
[3:39:42.120 --> 3:39:47.080]  of years from now will be being killed by this if we last that long as a species.
[3:39:47.080 --> 3:39:52.280]  Again, Dr. Rocky, what does it say? I'm going to warn prisonplanet.tv viewers. I'm going to put
[3:39:52.280 --> 3:39:57.560]  some images. We saw a doubling, tripling, now quadrupling of deformities in the areas where it
[3:39:57.560 --> 3:40:05.080]  was used in Kosovo, in Iraq, and in other areas. What does it say about the generals and the
[3:40:05.080 --> 3:40:10.440]  politicians and the companies that they know their kids are breathing this? They know they're
[3:40:10.440 --> 3:40:16.040]  breathing it. They know it's getting into the water, and they just don't care. They wouldn't
[3:40:16.040 --> 3:40:22.200]  do this until the early 90s. What changed? What is the mindset of these people? I'm going to be
[3:40:22.200 --> 3:40:27.160]  putting images of these to form babies up, and then I want to ask you, Dr. Rocky, about fighting
[3:40:27.160 --> 3:40:31.400]  back against this, because you look at graphs of the use of DU. It's going up parabolically,
[3:40:31.400 --> 3:40:37.080]  straight up, as you know. The good news is the Iraqis are now suing the U.S. for using this and
[3:40:37.080 --> 3:40:41.240]  not cleaning it up, as if you could clean it up. So maybe there's, I mean, you know, talk about
[3:40:41.240 --> 3:40:46.280]  solutions to fight this. Well, the other thing, too, is not only the Iraqis are bringing this up,
[3:40:46.280 --> 3:40:52.280]  and rightfully so, but the residents of Vieques in Puerto Rico are also bringing this up. And then
[3:40:52.280 --> 3:40:57.480]  I just literally got, just right before we came on the air, you know, uranium emissions, as you
[3:40:57.480 --> 3:41:02.760]  said, have been used extensively and contaminated Hawaii, Schofield barracks on Oahu, and then
[3:41:02.760 --> 3:41:08.120]  Pocaloa train area, and the U.S. Army and Nuclear Regulatory Commission a few weeks ago said,
[3:41:08.120 --> 3:41:12.680]  the residents of Hawaii have no standing to object or demand cleanup or medical care.
[3:41:13.400 --> 3:41:20.040]  And what happened here a couple days ago, CNN did a whole report on Vieques and how we thoroughly
[3:41:20.040 --> 3:41:25.480]  contaminated that area caused all the medical problems have walked away. And then now what I
[3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:30.040]  heard just a few minutes ago before we went on the air is CNN has now contacted the residents of
[3:41:30.040 --> 3:41:35.880]  Hawaii and said, okay, guys, what's happening? You need help. But you have to understand the
[3:41:35.880 --> 3:41:41.160]  senior leadership in the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army and the Marines and Navy
[3:41:41.160 --> 3:41:45.560]  thoroughly, totally disregard the health and environmental effects. They do not provide
[3:41:45.560 --> 3:41:50.440]  the training. They do not clean it up after it's used. And then what happens is the men,
[3:41:50.440 --> 3:41:55.000]  the women, and the children are all affected. They can't get the medical care that they've
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:42:00.440]  earned because it's denied, delayed, and they die. Or if they do get in for medical care,
[3:42:00.440 --> 3:42:06.040]  which has happened personally to me and my guys right here in Danville, Illinois and Danville,
[3:42:06.040 --> 3:42:11.320]  Illinois, they just deny any correlation. And if we get a doctor or somebody starts helping us,
[3:42:11.320 --> 3:42:19.080]  they immediately get transferred or fired. Now I want to say that I told them to just go online
[3:42:19.080 --> 3:42:26.200]  and type in Deformed Babies DU and they went to mindfully.org, which is one I hadn't even looked
[3:42:26.200 --> 3:42:30.200]  at. I looked at major news sites and these were so horrible, I told them to stop putting them
[3:42:30.200 --> 3:42:34.600]  up there. But if people want to go look at them, it's mindfully.org. I mean, it's just,
[3:42:34.600 --> 3:42:41.000]  and they admit it's causing deformities. I mean, this is so hellish that I can't even look at it.
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:46.040]  Let's look at, you know, I mean, you mentioned, you said about 9-1-1. Okay, 9-1-1 was black
[3:42:46.040 --> 3:42:51.160]  operations, but what is really horrific to me personally is the individuals that I trained
[3:42:51.160 --> 3:42:55.800]  from the New York Police and Fire years, you know, before 9-1-1 to go and do emergency
[3:42:55.800 --> 3:43:00.280]  rescue on has materials, nuclear, biological, chemical warfare, explosive. You have to understand
[3:43:00.280 --> 3:43:05.880]  the Army tasked me to train them. New York Emergency Services Unit personnel, those guys
[3:43:05.880 --> 3:43:10.760]  that went in there then got out and they became members of the New York Army National Guard
[3:43:10.760 --> 3:43:17.080]  442nd Military Police Unit. They were then sent over to Iraq. They got exposed. They started
[3:43:17.080 --> 3:43:22.440]  getting sick. The children they were conceived were born with birth defects. When those heroes
[3:43:22.440 --> 3:43:27.800]  of New York Police and Fire asked for medical care, the Army denied it. When they tried to sue
[3:43:27.800 --> 3:43:32.040]  it, they came up and said, you can't sue if you have no standing because of Ferris Doctrine.
[3:43:32.040 --> 3:43:37.640]  In other words, you guys are out of luck. In other words, you're just going to have to walk away,
[3:43:37.640 --> 3:43:41.880]  ignore your medical care that we already require, but we don't provide you. And just
[3:43:42.520 --> 3:43:44.600]  so sorry about your children. We really don't care.
[3:43:46.840 --> 3:43:50.600]  Well, I can't even look at this. I mean, I was talking about mainstream news articles
[3:43:50.600 --> 3:43:55.320]  showing the deformed children. They went and found a news site, mindfully, that I'm aware of.
[3:43:55.320 --> 3:44:00.680]  And I couldn't even look at it. I mean, and then I mean, I remember back after the first Gulf War,
[3:44:00.680 --> 3:44:06.280]  the cover of life books, a life magazine was admitting the DU was causing deformities and
[3:44:06.280 --> 3:44:11.960]  it showed the deformed U.S. kids. I mean, it's all been there for years. And if I understand,
[3:44:11.960 --> 3:44:17.080]  every internal briefing we have, every report that we've ever had thoroughly acknowledges it.
[3:44:17.080 --> 3:44:23.080]  When General, when General Schwarzkopf was ordered after repeat, the Pentagon leadership
[3:44:23.080 --> 3:44:27.080]  ordered General Schwarzkopf to find me and tell me to clean up the pleaded terrain during Desert
[3:44:27.080 --> 3:44:31.960]  Storm. So his chief of staff wrote the order and, you know, off I went again, you know, but hey,
[3:44:31.960 --> 3:44:36.680]  being a career military and, you know, lover of America and everything, okay, we'll go and do it.
[3:44:37.240 --> 3:44:40.920]  And today, you know, all of us are affected, but, you know, I kind of come back and say,
[3:44:40.920 --> 3:44:46.520]  if I didn't do the work, nobody else would. What made the changes as I finished the work
[3:44:46.520 --> 3:44:51.400]  as the director of the U.S. Army to Pleaded Rainier Project would end up be not only
[3:44:51.400 --> 3:44:55.400]  for the U.S. Army, it ended up being for the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Marines,
[3:44:55.400 --> 3:45:02.200]  but I also had a German officer, a Canadian officer, an Australian officer assigned to me.
[3:45:03.080 --> 3:45:08.040]  Okay. So we're working all together to get it all done, and we're acknowledging everything,
[3:45:08.040 --> 3:45:12.600]  finding all the problems. And I had the total realization after we did the research in the
[3:45:12.600 --> 3:45:17.400]  Nevada test site in Merckton, Nevada, you can't clean it up. There is no medical care. There is
[3:45:17.400 --> 3:45:22.120]  no way to protect everybody. And I came out and told them they can't ever use it again. Well,
[3:45:22.120 --> 3:45:26.760]  you know, how fast do you become persona non-grat, when you tell somebody you can't use their favorite
[3:45:26.760 --> 3:45:34.520]  weapon? How do we stop the use of this? How do we fight back? Well, it's very simply. There's a
[3:45:34.520 --> 3:45:39.400]  war against, it's a crime against God and a crime against humanity. And we need to have those
[3:45:39.400 --> 3:45:43.320]  individuals accountable for whether, whether they do. Everybody is supposed to be trained. Everybody
[3:45:43.320 --> 3:45:49.080]  knows what the hazards are. The senior leadership totally disregards it. We need to restore order.
[3:45:49.080 --> 3:45:54.680]  We need to restore confidence in our nation. We need to restore the go back to the Constitution
[3:45:54.680 --> 3:46:00.360]  and what's right under God, not what somebody needs to do to kill, destroy the main in order to
[3:46:00.360 --> 3:46:05.800]  seize terrain, resources or control people. You know, we have to go back to the fundamentals.
[3:46:06.360 --> 3:46:11.800]  What is right? What should we do? I mean, when we destroy a nation's infrastructure to release
[3:46:11.800 --> 3:46:17.720]  all these toxic chemical compounds, or we take all our trash as we're doing a rack and we burn it
[3:46:17.720 --> 3:46:24.360]  and open pits resulted in credible thousands and thousands of U.S. casualties who are denied care.
[3:46:24.360 --> 3:46:29.480]  This is called the toxic burn pit problem. You can read about it on ArmyTimes.com website or
[3:46:29.480 --> 3:46:34.440]  all over. You know, we need to hold these people accountable and tell them enough is enough. I
[3:46:34.440 --> 3:46:38.440]  mean, if we have a viable threat and an enemy that's going to attack us, you have to be
[3:46:38.440 --> 3:46:43.320]  understand as a military guy, I'm going to be the first in the line to shoot the guy, okay?
[3:46:43.320 --> 3:46:50.440]  The real enemy. But we cannot continue to contaminate air, water, soil and food, disregard the
[3:46:50.440 --> 3:46:56.200]  environment contamination, thoroughly disregard the fact that we already ordered medical care for
[3:46:56.200 --> 3:47:01.720]  this and acknowledge it. But to the sick soldier, their family member or the civilian, we tell them
[3:47:01.720 --> 3:47:09.800]  there's no problem. We can do what we want to do. Well, it's our own troops. Even if people love
[3:47:09.800 --> 3:47:15.080]  killing Iraqi children or Serb children and think it's cute, I mean, this is our own troops we're
[3:47:15.080 --> 3:47:23.080]  doing this to. It wasn't acceptable until 1991. Why did it suddenly in the last 19 years become
[3:47:23.080 --> 3:47:30.280]  acceptable to engage in wars against humanity, crimes against humanity of mass murder? I mean,
[3:47:30.280 --> 3:47:34.680]  there's no doubt they know what they're doing. Yeah, and I don't have the answers to that because,
[3:47:34.680 --> 3:47:39.480]  you know, when I started yelling and screaming about it, they got very nasty. You know, one thing we
[3:47:39.480 --> 3:47:44.360]  do know from the U.S. Department of Veterans Report, you've seen these, what they do is statistical
[3:47:44.360 --> 3:47:48.360]  analysis of the various casualties in the age groups and what's happening in their war.
[3:47:49.240 --> 3:47:54.840]  With Operation Iraqi Freedom, this matches Desert Storm, this matches 100 percent of the New York
[3:47:54.840 --> 3:47:58.840]  police and fire that went into the World Trade Center, matches completely to the police and
[3:47:58.840 --> 3:48:03.240]  fire that went into the Pentagon on that day. We're looking at a 12 percent infectious and
[3:48:03.240 --> 3:48:10.920]  parasitic disease. We've got 1 percent absolute cancer. We've got 4 percent benign cancer,
[3:48:10.920 --> 3:48:16.200]  endric and nutritional metabolic problems at 23 percent. When we look at leukemias, we're looking
[3:48:16.200 --> 3:48:21.400]  at 3 percent leukemias among young kids, which they never should have. Yeah, I've talked to a
[3:48:21.400 --> 3:48:26.600]  lot of medical doctors, Dr. Rocky, and they say that 30 years ago, finding a kid with cancer
[3:48:26.600 --> 3:48:31.560]  in a ward was like finding a leprechaun or, I mean, it was incredibly rare. And that now,
[3:48:31.560 --> 3:48:35.800]  it's just cancer everywhere. I mean, it's like, oh yeah, kids, just get cancer like they get the
[3:48:35.800 --> 3:48:41.800]  flu now. Yeah, and then the PTSD is 50 percent. We look at the neurological problems. We're
[3:48:41.800 --> 3:48:48.120]  looking at 37 percent, and that's actually gone up, and it's thoroughly reported. I mean, in the
[3:48:48.120 --> 3:48:52.920]  most recent report that came out on Army Times and again about the casualties, they're thoroughly
[3:48:52.920 --> 3:48:57.960]  acknowledging that the most evacuations out of Iraq and Afghanistan have nothing to do with bullets
[3:48:57.960 --> 3:49:03.960]  of bombs. They're all these toxic exposures resulting in incredible neurological respiratory
[3:49:03.960 --> 3:49:09.880]  and cardiac problems. Well, Dr. Rocky, did you see the Mayak and Homeland Security reports last year
[3:49:09.880 --> 3:49:15.080]  where they admit Homeland Security is really set up for returning veterans, gun owners, libertarians,
[3:49:15.080 --> 3:49:20.360]  conservatives? And I know the globalists are a bunch of bloodthirsty eugenicists. I know they
[3:49:20.360 --> 3:49:25.400]  hate the troops because they're a bunch of globalists, and I believe they actually like this. They
[3:49:25.400 --> 3:49:32.040]  don't just not care and know about it. They like it. They like that this is happening to the troops
[3:49:32.040 --> 3:49:37.000]  because it's a soft-kill weapon. They're done with them. They've served them. They want to get rid
[3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:41.720]  of them. We know they won't give them treatment. I mean, that is the most phrasing. And again,
[3:49:41.720 --> 3:49:46.600]  as you said, all the plague waivers, it bothers me the most. You know, the people and the veterans
[3:49:46.600 --> 3:49:51.960]  are foreign whereas the American Legion, disabled American veterans, when you specifically ask them
[3:49:51.960 --> 3:49:55.960]  the community, will you help us get medical care? Will you take us to an appointment?
[3:49:55.960 --> 3:50:01.720]  How about acknowledging what has really happened here with these incredible casualties,
[3:50:01.720 --> 3:50:07.080]  not from bullets and bombs or toxic exposures? Man, they run the other way. They run so fast
[3:50:07.080 --> 3:50:12.200]  in the other direction. Yeah, they're cowards. I mean, if George Bush or Obama doesn't tell
[3:50:12.200 --> 3:50:17.080]  them to do it at a baseball game, they're not going to do it. Well, most people prefer to just
[3:50:17.080 --> 3:50:21.240]  sit there and have a six-pack of beer and watch a football game rather than do something that's
[3:50:21.240 --> 3:50:27.240]  meaningful to help somebody. Even as their son comes back and his wife has two deformed kids,
[3:50:27.240 --> 3:50:31.320]  and then the one that lives gets leukemia, and they wonder why their grandkids dying.
[3:50:31.960 --> 3:50:35.320]  Yeah, and, you know, we've seen this forever. I mean, you know, one of my best friends that I
[3:50:35.320 --> 3:50:40.680]  served with in Vietnam, his son died as a result of the consequence of his father's, you know,
[3:50:40.680 --> 3:50:44.600]  age and orange exposure. And then, you know, we're saying the same thing with my uncle.
[3:50:45.320 --> 3:50:49.640]  Same thing, age and orange. Their son died. I guess it was at three holes in his heart,
[3:50:49.640 --> 3:50:55.000]  everything else. This is the gift the government gives you. And he was a helicopter pilot in
[3:50:55.000 --> 3:51:01.560]  Vietnam, and they knew and just didn't care. It's fun for them that they're hurting people's children.
[3:51:01.560 --> 3:51:05.800]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that

[3:52:12.440 --> 3:52:17.320]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence
[3:52:17.320 --> 3:52:23.320]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[3:52:23.320 --> 3:52:29.320]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our
[3:52:29.320 --> 3:52:35.160]  nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[3:52:35.160 --> 3:52:39.640]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for
[3:52:39.640 --> 3:52:44.280]  more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody
[3:52:44.280 --> 3:52:51.320]  does care. And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your copy of

[3:54:45.800 --> 3:54:52.120]  Pleteoranium from the Pentagon when he was there. Again, coming up, we've got right at the start
[3:54:52.120 --> 3:54:59.000]  of the show, Judge Andrew Napolitano, Wolfgang Wodarg on the vaccine fraud, and Freeway Ricky
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:03.160]  Ross coming up in the retransmission. I think today was an amazing show. Great job to the crew.
[3:55:03.160 --> 3:55:06.600]  In the four minutes we've got left, Dr. Doug Rocky, give us some of the websites that have
[3:55:06.600 --> 3:55:11.880]  your research, the documents posted, the best place for people to visit who want to expose what's
[3:55:11.880 --> 3:55:15.800]  happening with DU. I mean, hell, they may start putting it in the drinking water like fluoride
[3:55:15.800 --> 3:55:21.960]  and saying it's good for us if we don't. Well, probably the best website is grassrootspeace.org
[3:55:21.960 --> 3:55:32.600]  G-R-A-S-S-R-O-O-T-S-P-E-A-C-E.org. That's Sonny Miller and Charlie Jankiew. People used to be
[3:55:32.600 --> 3:55:38.680]  at TrapRock until they got canned, and that website is maintained. The other one is with a power hour
[3:55:38.680 --> 3:55:45.080]  and that goes to the Beyond Treason website and the whole documentary and video. We've done a lot
[3:55:45.080 --> 3:55:50.680]  documentaries and videos for it all over the thing. We've done CBS 60 Minutes several times,
[3:55:50.680 --> 3:55:57.560]  the BBC CNN, Nightline, Dateline, you know, but what happened, there's no long-term changes.
[3:55:57.560 --> 3:56:02.280]  Everybody kind of looks at it and then they ignore it because they don't want to deal with a hardcore
[3:56:02.280 --> 3:56:07.000]  reality that the United States Department of Defense in their effort to do a war has thoroughly
[3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:12.200]  contaminated air, water, and soil and food resulted in incredible health and...
[3:56:12.200 --> 3:56:16.360]  And now if they admit what they did was wrong, they'll have to give people treatment so they'll
[3:56:16.360 --> 3:56:20.760]  just expand it. And there is not enough money. I mean, we don't have enough money so they continue
[3:56:20.760 --> 3:56:27.480]  on their merry way and totally disregard it. So the only thing we can do is to get the truth out,
[3:56:27.480 --> 3:56:32.840]  force medical care individually by thing with the actual reports, and talk to our leader,
[3:56:32.840 --> 3:56:37.560]  see your leadership in Congress and the House and the Senate, talk to the president, and make
[3:56:37.560 --> 3:56:42.520]  these jerks change their attitude and do what is right. But, you know, the probability of that is
[3:56:42.520 --> 3:56:50.440]  very low because it's all about making a buck. I have a final question from the Twitter. It says,
[3:56:50.440 --> 3:56:55.880]  do you think DU is being used because it's effective at penetration or because it keeps on
[3:56:55.880 --> 3:57:01.400]  killing or both? Everything all of the above. You have to understand it's extraordinarily
[3:57:01.400 --> 3:57:06.120]  effective against all targets. And we know there's no armored targets left in Iraq and Afghanistan,
[3:57:06.120 --> 3:57:12.360]  to Magyar, Yemen, or the Balkans. They're shooting up houses and buildings and civilian cars and
[3:57:12.360 --> 3:57:17.720]  trucks that they could use a slingshot against. Georgia. They used it in Georgia. Oh, incredible.
[3:57:17.720 --> 3:57:22.200]  They used it out in, uh, every, all over the United States has had a problem. I mean, you know,
[3:57:22.200 --> 3:57:28.200]  Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, you know, we go down to Texas all over down Texas. We go out to
[3:57:28.200 --> 3:57:33.800]  Utah. We go out to Nevada. I mean, I personally shot Nevada. I mean, all over the place. I personally
[3:57:33.800 --> 3:57:38.040]  did. Uh, it's just a total disregard. And then you have all the manufacturing sites,
[3:57:38.040 --> 3:57:41.960]  whether it's Albany, New York, with National lead that, you know, it's been closed, but it's a
[3:57:41.960 --> 3:57:47.480]  total environmental disaster, starved at Concord, Massachusetts. You got Aerojet down at, uh,
[3:57:47.480 --> 3:57:52.920]  Johnstown, Tennessee. You've got a lion up there in the Twin Cities, Minneapolis, St. Paul. They
[3:57:52.920 --> 3:58:02.440]  don't care. They don't care. Unbelievable. But in Austin, they'll come arrest somebody if they cut
[3:58:02.440 --> 3:58:06.920]  down a cedar tree on their own property and they'll arrest you if you accidentally throw a battery
[3:58:06.920 --> 3:58:11.640]  away in the trash. Again, they use this to control us, but anything really that's a serious threat
[3:58:11.640 --> 3:58:19.480]  like genetic engineering, GMO, depleted uranium, HIV and the factor eight shots, mercury in the
[3:58:19.480 --> 3:58:24.360]  vaccines, uh, melamine in the milk. They say, Hey, have your kids drink it. Melamine is no
[3:58:24.360 --> 3:58:30.120]  longer bad. Mercury in the corn syrup. Dr. Doug Rocky, God bless you. And thank God you're out
[3:58:30.120 --> 3:58:34.280]  there. This would be far worse. And we'll continue to track all the great work you're doing. We'll
