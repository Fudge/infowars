[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:38.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.000 --> 00:45.720]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome it is Tuesday thank you for joining us the
[00:45.720 --> 00:55.280]  17th day of April 2011 and this is the day that the government has made
[00:55.280 --> 01:01.320]  government is what makes the Sun sit in the sky and the Earth orbit it
[01:01.320 --> 01:05.900]  government is what runs our lives and of course that that controls the
[01:05.900 --> 01:11.320]  government is the loving private megabanks openly establishing world
[01:11.320 --> 01:19.360]  government in everyone's face so we are going to be discussing all of this
[01:19.360 --> 01:30.160]  today normally you pay on April 15th but because of a federal holiday yesterday
[01:30.160 --> 01:38.380]  you do not pay on the 15th you pay on the 17th because the 15th fell on the
[01:38.380 --> 01:44.420]  Sunday there was a federal holiday on the 16th the buildup to the holy day when
[01:44.420 --> 01:48.580]  you pay the private fellow reserve your tax money and then of course today is the
[01:48.580 --> 01:53.500]  day of course most of you just have your money taken out of your paycheck and of
[01:53.500 --> 01:58.640]  course taken via social security that you'll never really collect on or if you
[01:58.640 --> 02:03.220]  do it will be in devalued dollars and it was really hitting me this morning
[02:03.220 --> 02:10.300]  that we pay the income tax that's in the communist manifesto and in the 10
[02:10.300 --> 02:14.660]  planks of the communist manifesto that was written by the big European banks
[02:14.660 --> 02:21.860]  on record through their agents marks and angles as a way to pay for the interest
[02:21.860 --> 02:26.620]  on the right to even have a currency and they got to us a little bit later by
[02:26.620 --> 02:32.380]  1913 a few decades to slowly implement it because they knew they had us they
[02:32.380 --> 02:37.180]  wanted to take their time and since then we've become the greatest debtor nation
[02:37.180 --> 02:41.940]  from the greatest creditor nation and in every other statistic we are the
[02:41.940 --> 02:47.780]  laughing stock we are the imperium we are the heart of the new world order
[02:47.780 --> 02:55.220]  muscle we are the modern Hessian mercenaries for the new world order now
[02:55.220 --> 03:00.860]  we are going to open the phones up I'm going to give the number out when we
[03:00.860 --> 03:05.140]  come back from break so start your engines or not give me the green light
[03:05.140 --> 03:09.180]  yet I want to hear from you or take a bunch of calls ahead of Alan Watt
[03:09.180 --> 03:13.100]  joining us that means I'll probably get the calls in the last segment of the
[03:13.100 --> 03:17.420]  shower or maybe not even this hour no seriously I'm gonna try to go to your
[03:17.420 --> 03:21.260]  calls in the next segment in fact in the spirit of that let me just give the
[03:21.260 --> 03:25.820]  number out right now for first-time callers the first few rounds will be
[03:25.820 --> 03:33.700]  first-time callers 800-259-9231 and we don't screen your calls you can talk
[03:33.700 --> 03:37.380]  about any issue you want but if it's just a bunch of plugs or you got a tractor
[03:37.380 --> 03:42.980]  you're selling or you want to ask me about my reptoid from planet Pop-Tard
[03:42.980 --> 03:48.780]  then well we're just not gonna be able to talk very long I want to have I want
[03:48.780 --> 03:51.580]  to hear questions comments or points you've got to make and move on to the
[03:51.580 --> 03:55.580]  next person because it's like that holy grail I've never actually attained but
[03:55.580 --> 03:58.980]  a few times actually taking a bunch of phone calls we can take thousands of
[03:58.980 --> 04:01.900]  phone calls here and I think it's some of the best radio I do when I actually
[04:01.900 --> 04:09.660]  take phone calls so we're gonna do it 800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to
[04:09.660 --> 04:17.980]  join us and we will get you up and on the air 800-259-9231 when we come back
[04:17.980 --> 04:22.420]  I will give you the top stories briefly and they start going to your calls and
[04:22.420 --> 04:28.220]  then go back into them but we did a story yesterday Paul Watson and my shelf IRS
[04:28.220 --> 04:33.300]  travel ban revoking citizenship by stealth it was the top story on the
[04:33.300 --> 04:40.660]  vaunted Mac daddy of traffic drudge report.com I had since moved off the
[04:40.660 --> 04:45.020]  page but the top story at drudge is record numbers of Americans giving up
[04:45.020 --> 04:49.500]  their citizenship to get away from the private fellow reserve tax man that's
[04:49.500 --> 04:53.380]  raping them of course the globalist answer is hey Jack you ain't leaving
[04:53.380 --> 04:57.380]  we're taking everything you got the illegals can come in but the slave
[04:57.380 --> 05:02.780]  Americans cannot get out. A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of
[05:02.780 --> 05:06.700]  research into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still
[05:06.700 --> 05:11.180]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[05:11.180 --> 05:14.100]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[05:14.100 --> 05:18.420]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the
[05:18.420 --> 05:23.540]  key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight
[05:23.540 --> 05:28.500]  off cancer and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral
[05:28.500 --> 05:32.820]  company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are

[08:36.660 --> 08:43.420]  when it comes to defending liberty and exposing the global corporate crime

[08:50.420 --> 08:57.420]  worldwide you see police state grids being put in and the exact same programs
[08:57.420 --> 09:03.140]  the exact same names under continuity of agenda it is a global corporate world
[09:03.140 --> 09:10.860]  government that we face it is the new world order it is the main fount or the
[09:10.860 --> 09:18.140]  organizer of all the major problems on earth humans we have our own problems we
[09:18.140 --> 09:21.540]  have our own issues we repeat throughout history generation after
[09:21.540 --> 09:25.980]  generation we only live for a short period the elites understand that if
[09:25.980 --> 09:30.620]  people aren't given the knowledge of how humanity operates and are kept in the
[09:30.620 --> 09:36.140]  dark the average person will never become wise and in your limited life
[09:36.140 --> 09:41.540]  span understand the tricks that corrupt syndicates have developed in every
[09:41.540 --> 09:54.220]  civilization in more than 6,000 years of human settlements civilization the
[09:54.220 --> 09:59.980]  globalists know all the tricks and are masters at it and that simply put is what
[09:59.980 --> 10:04.900]  the Illuminati is they are illuminated they have the light they know the tricks
[10:04.900 --> 10:09.540]  they know the secrets of humanity they know the basic psychology before that
[10:09.540 --> 10:14.620]  word was invented they wrote the handbooks on control and deception and
[10:14.620 --> 10:19.700]  they pass it down through the different genetic crime families that are
[10:19.700 --> 10:27.460]  intermarried and they control this planet to a great extent they are trying to get
[10:27.460 --> 10:35.420]  full control and if they get full control they are going to kill depending on
[10:35.420 --> 10:45.260]  which document you read they debate it 80 to 90 all the way up to 99.9 plus
[10:45.260 --> 10:51.300]  percent and I've quoted these documents with at nauseam we've posted articles
[10:51.300 --> 11:01.780]  there's new articles at infowars.com today documenting this now
[11:04.020 --> 11:09.460]  humanity is in grave peril when you look at the innocence of children when you
[11:09.460 --> 11:13.460]  look at the decency and the beauty and the goodness and the wholesomeness in
[11:13.460 --> 11:19.580]  the world you have to understand there is more good in the world than evil but
[11:19.580 --> 11:31.540]  good never seeks power until things get so desperate good is forced to fight
[11:31.540 --> 11:35.300]  back and generally it's against overwhelming odds because you've waited
[11:35.300 --> 11:41.420]  too long but still good triumphs when it takes action the first that stand up
[11:41.420 --> 11:45.700]  may be destroyed and maybe the second and third and fourth wave but those that
[11:45.700 --> 11:51.500]  persevere with truth and justice and goodness stacked against evil will
[11:51.500 --> 12:00.940]  always prevail in the end now I want to take your phone calls today I want to
[12:00.940 --> 12:08.140]  get the calls first and early here and then coming up we wrote a story yesterday
[12:08.140 --> 12:17.820]  Paul Watson and I IRS travel ban revoking citizenship by stealth and I
[12:17.820 --> 12:22.380]  noticed that it went up on the drudge report is the top story and then I
[12:22.380 --> 12:26.460]  noticed about an hour later as I'm always
[12:28.940 --> 12:33.620]  swimming around over at the drudge report checking for the latest news
[12:33.620 --> 12:41.540]  orbiting it and I noticed another article popped up from CBC Canadian TV and
[12:41.540 --> 12:46.740]  media documenting that record numbers of Americans are giving up their
[12:46.740 --> 12:52.260]  citizenship to get out from under the taxes in the United States that are
[12:52.260 --> 12:59.220]  unbelievably unfair and draconian and most importantly paid to the private
[12:59.220 --> 13:06.780]  run-for-profit Federal Reserve literally the Reagan's administration did a
[13:06.780 --> 13:12.740]  congressional study you can look it up it reported over 98% of it went to
[13:12.740 --> 13:17.580]  interest on the debt and to pay for interest for the dollar to be created
[13:17.580 --> 13:20.180]  paid to the private Federal Reserve a few percentage points went to
[13:20.180 --> 13:24.980]  administrative issues and then separately Social Security goes in another
[13:24.980 --> 13:29.700]  fund they rated from day one it's about tying you into their system getting you
[13:29.700 --> 13:34.100]  into the Ponzi scheme so you'll stay in even if the payment's reduced you'll
[13:34.100 --> 13:38.100]  stay into the system seeing it's too big to fail so you'll stay in the in the
[13:38.100 --> 13:46.900]  fraud our government our country our system was built on federal taxes that
[13:46.900 --> 13:53.900]  range between depending on the era five and ten percent I hear this lie about
[13:53.900 --> 13:59.060]  when the income tax first went in I hear it at nauseam on TV and radio put out by
[13:59.060 --> 14:04.740]  the Democrats oh the first tax rates were 90% for the rich yes there was a
[14:04.740 --> 14:10.660]  corporate tax that they sold to get the income tax finagled though it wasn't
[14:10.660 --> 14:16.820]  ratified by the states it's a fraud as well where there were corporate taxes
[14:16.820 --> 14:21.340]  of 90% but no one had to pay it because there were accounting tricks where you
[14:21.340 --> 14:27.580]  just paid it out to other subsidiaries in yourself so another fraud but I don't
[14:27.580 --> 14:32.900]  want to get caught up in the minutiae here this is tax day when you're paying
[14:32.900 --> 14:40.980]  the private Federal Reserve and make no mistake you pay the lion's share of your
[14:40.980 --> 14:47.940]  taxes that they take out of your paycheck that you pay at the end of the
[14:47.940 --> 14:52.580]  year or you pay quarterly depending on how you pay you pay it directly to
[14:52.580 --> 15:02.980]  Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of America Wells Fargo city group now
[15:02.980 --> 15:14.140]  continuing with this information when you pull back and look at it we have a
[15:14.140 --> 15:18.060]  private Federal Reserve in this country and they're not just getting your income
[15:18.060 --> 15:23.620]  tax money that's paid directly to them for interest on the debt that they set
[15:23.620 --> 15:27.220]  up to put the government in fraudulently now they've signed us on to
[15:27.220 --> 15:31.260]  their derivatives fraud and had government sign on to it and spin it
[15:31.260 --> 15:35.340]  that it's our debt and we're lazy and we're not working enough jobs the
[15:35.340 --> 15:40.380]  uniquely American thing that Bush talked about working three jobs and having
[15:40.380 --> 15:43.420]  your children raised by the state and government training centers eating GMO
[15:43.420 --> 15:49.140]  poison and dying of cancer if they're not neurologically damaged or both in
[15:49.140 --> 15:56.980]  death camp America slow death soft kill eugenics America Rothschild Rockefeller
[15:56.980 --> 16:06.380]  Bill Gates death camp slow kill death camp so understand what will bring down
[16:06.380 --> 16:11.940]  the Federal Reserve is exposing it's not federal it's run for profit and it's
[16:11.940 --> 16:17.540]  waging war on the free market and is selectively enforcing the tax laws that
[16:17.540 --> 16:22.820]  they wrote the Federal Reserve lobbyists wrote to shut down all their competition
[16:22.820 --> 16:27.020]  they are monopoly men they are the enemy of this country they are the

[16:44.820 --> 16:48.820]  debt and get America back on its feet they mean give all the money to them
[16:48.820 --> 16:52.980]  cut the benefits bankrupt the economy further so they can buy it up for pennies

[17:32.940 --> 17:36.860]  to break up the families and militarize the police and have the cities go
[17:36.860 --> 17:41.460]  bankrupt and then squeeze the public for more money they want a post industrial
[17:41.460 --> 17:45.740]  world they want you bankrupt they want you impoverished they openly say they

[18:04.620 --> 18:09.660]  Bill and Melinda Gates who got over a trillion dollars into their companies of
[18:09.660 --> 18:15.020]  the bailout money Warren Buffett himself in the first round three billion

[18:41.660 --> 18:44.020]  gonna come back and go to your phone calls but then later I'm getting into
[18:44.020 --> 18:50.300]  this because some people I got emails I saw text I saw comments on YouTube I saw
[18:50.300 --> 18:55.220]  comments on our article IRS travel ban revoking citizenship by stealth and
[18:55.220 --> 19:00.420]  people are like how does that revoke citizenship you cannot under federal
[19:00.420 --> 19:04.020]  court rulings the Constitution and no other government does this but Russia by
[19:04.020 --> 19:09.820]  the way take someone's passport extra judicially without a conviction you

[20:02.100 --> 20:06.260]  began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal

[20:09.860 --> 20:13.900]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[20:13.900 --> 20:18.140]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all

[24:04.060 --> 24:08.540]  by the way one more point I'm going to your calls before I get into this top
[24:08.540 --> 24:13.620]  story IRS travel ban revoking citizenship by stealth and how it ties into
[24:13.620 --> 24:18.900]  Paul Watson's latest article at infowars.com IRS to revoke passports of
[24:18.900 --> 24:27.220]  30,000 US troops you heard that right but of course they might be given
[24:27.220 --> 24:32.220]  selective waivers the TSA is now announcing they'll decide who gets to
[24:32.220 --> 24:39.820]  get waived from the crotch group the point here is that I've seen a lot of
[24:39.820 --> 24:45.060]  people comment that well already states request that the federal government not
[24:45.060 --> 24:51.180]  issue you a passport or cancel it if you owe child support you can't strip
[24:51.180 --> 24:56.540]  somebody of their absolute right but of course it started with the children well
[24:56.540 --> 25:01.100]  it's for the children and now it's well it's for the Federal Reserve and it's
[25:01.100 --> 25:05.420]  going to be you can't have a job you can't have a car you can't travel you
[25:05.420 --> 25:13.300]  say well you'll just drive illegally well now they've got license plate
[25:13.300 --> 25:17.900]  readers and in real time know if you're even up on your insurance the future is
[25:17.900 --> 25:23.140]  going to be a hellish system the economy is meant to be predatory now we are
[25:23.140 --> 25:27.540]  meant to go into a cannibalistic phase politically economically where we
[25:27.540 --> 25:34.820]  implode you think two million in prisons ten years ago four years ago four and
[25:34.820 --> 25:39.980]  a half million now seven point one the estimate by the next decade will be more
[25:39.980 --> 25:47.740]  than 15 million in prison more prisoners than China this is the economy and then
[25:47.740 --> 25:51.980]  the people come out of the jails not afraid to commit crime not afraid to
[25:51.980 --> 26:01.900]  rape and rob they're colleges of crime America is under a scientific attack
[26:01.900 --> 26:07.620]  there's the New York Times US prison population dwarfs that of other
[26:07.620 --> 26:12.220]  nations the United States has less than 5% of the world's population but it has
[26:12.220 --> 26:16.940]  almost a quarter of the world's prisoners all right let's go to your phone
[26:16.940 --> 26:23.820]  calls David Tony Cameron Christopher Jeff Wally David in Florida you're on the
[26:23.820 --> 26:29.140]  air go ahead hi Alex I really love your show a lot I was wondering if you'd
[26:29.140 --> 26:33.900]  seen the study a month or two ago that came out in the news that 20% of the
[26:33.900 --> 26:40.900]  population 25% of women are now on psychotropic drugs I was astounded how
[26:40.900 --> 26:46.180]  high yes and then a new freedom initiative number six years ago that leaked
[26:46.180 --> 26:49.420]  out because one of the board members exposed it it was meetings with the
[26:49.420 --> 26:54.700]  White House the regulators and big pharma and they said the goal was within a
[26:54.700 --> 27:00.580]  figure was it 10 years I remember the exact number they wanted 50% of school
[27:00.580 --> 27:06.340]  kids of children on psychotropic and back then they had about 10% and now I
[27:06.340 --> 27:11.180]  was reading it's over 20 for kids over 20 for women and this is the way they
[27:11.180 --> 27:16.980]  roll yeah right well in my opinion what I think is a lot of fascinating
[27:16.980 --> 27:20.740]  subjects you discuss like the Fed and TSA and the upcoming police state I think
[27:20.740 --> 27:24.340]  this is the number one issue and the reason why is because having everybody
[27:24.340 --> 27:28.740]  drugged out on an apathetically in a zombie state like walking in front of
[27:28.740 --> 27:32.900]  the cars as you said a few weeks ago this allows them to roll in all the other
[27:32.900 --> 27:37.060]  programs sir it is we've done reports on it and shown the scientific reports the
[27:37.060 --> 27:42.700]  universities since TV became ubiquitous across the board everywhere in the 50s
[27:42.700 --> 27:51.460]  brainwaves have lowered brainwaves IQs and you could just pull up every week
[27:51.460 --> 27:57.860]  now it's a study computers rewiring children's brains lowering IQs you can
[27:57.860 --> 28:09.300]  also guys just type in iPads causing autism and it literally is the language
[28:09.300 --> 28:13.060]  has been reduced where people don't have very many words anymore their
[28:13.060 --> 28:18.060]  vocabulary is lower advertising agencies are putting out reports saying dumb it
[28:18.060 --> 28:23.100]  down to a third grade level for adults now and it's just all about being
[28:23.100 --> 28:28.940]  programmed into a zombie state and so people were either awakening to a higher
[28:28.940 --> 28:34.020]  level or they're being dumbed down and yes sir they the average person you say
[28:34.020 --> 28:37.620]  people like it's like they're in a trance it's not like they are in a near
[28:37.620 --> 28:42.180]  dream state and they have pre-programmed responses it's like black
[28:42.180 --> 28:49.620]  helicopters just terrorized Chicago but 15 years ago they would just say it
[28:49.620 --> 28:53.700]  didn't exist you were insane even if they covertly leased a building and blow it
[28:53.700 --> 28:58.140]  up local news would because I've been to these would say it does not exist Alex
[28:58.140 --> 29:02.780]  Jones is bad and I'd go here's footage of it they'd go does not exist see they
[29:02.780 --> 29:06.660]  were already in a trance and you're like but it's I have footage I I talked to
[29:06.660 --> 29:10.220]  police chief they tried to pay him off the San Antonio news was like does not
[29:10.220 --> 29:15.780]  exist the Austin America statesman said Jones is insane it's like the New York
[29:15.780 --> 29:18.900]  Times just four years ago said Bilderberg doesn't exist Jones is
[29:18.900 --> 29:24.020]  hallucinating you understand this is total mind control so you're conscious
[29:24.020 --> 29:27.700]  and it's like well it doesn't make any sense because you're awake but to a
[29:27.700 --> 29:32.260]  zombie it's it's like a magician who hypnotizes somebody and they can't see
[29:32.260 --> 29:36.020]  the audience anymore they are in a dream state stay there I want to give you
[29:36.020 --> 29:39.740]  another comment as I ran over you more calls coming up this is an important

[33:18.180 --> 33:24.860]  University of Texas psychology building and was shown around it's got a lot of
[33:24.860 --> 33:29.780]  classified projects going on in it and they've got cameras into classified
[33:29.780 --> 33:35.420]  projects hooked into computer systems this is like a decade ago and more now
[33:35.420 --> 33:39.740]  this is about no just about a decade ago hooked into all the different
[33:39.740 --> 33:45.860]  laboratories spread out around Austin in the Hill Country and most of it is just
[33:45.860 --> 33:50.900]  monkeys chained down with their wires in their brains with TV screens flickering
[33:50.900 --> 33:55.940]  different rates at them testing how to lower their brainwaves and put them into
[33:55.940 --> 34:01.020]  a trance and then they have students come in and hook them up to the EKG systems
[34:01.020 --> 34:05.180]  and all these electrodes on their heads and just practice they'll have whole
[34:05.180 --> 34:10.100]  programs on just how to stimulate a woman sexually I was shown one DARPA
[34:10.100 --> 34:15.180]  program with just flicker rates so they they send a flicker wave over through
[34:15.180 --> 34:19.260]  the television and and then they've got other programs that they found well if
[34:19.260 --> 34:22.580]  you sexually stimulate and then hit them with this other rate and then show
[34:22.580 --> 34:27.620]  them something else you can really imprint the knowledge on them and by
[34:27.620 --> 34:33.900]  knowledge the brainwashing and my point is that was just one example and it's
[34:33.900 --> 34:38.220]  just all the universities all the complexes dedicated to wrecking your
[34:38.220 --> 34:42.900]  mind and hurting you and murdering you and your family I just lay it right out

[35:07.020 --> 35:11.900]  years ago I was given like a four-hour tour it was amazing late at night oh

[35:15.940 --> 35:21.380]  didn't see that come in here DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA
[35:21.380 --> 35:26.460]  Department of Defense Air Force Bellarmine and the Gates Foundation every
[35:26.460 --> 35:33.460]  sector would have on the door what was funding and everything was about mind
[35:33.460 --> 35:39.420]  control on one floor go another area it's all about cameras that scan your
[35:39.420 --> 35:43.460]  facial expressions to tell what products you're looking and that track your eyes
[35:43.460 --> 35:48.300]  and the cameras are hidden when you go into these smart stores now of course
[35:48.300 --> 35:58.780]  that's been put in everywhere it is just total absolute savage control and
[35:58.780 --> 36:03.140]  that's why you talk to the average adult there's no way to even reach them or get
[36:03.140 --> 36:09.260]  through to them they're just not there these are zombies and they too men tune
[36:09.260 --> 36:13.060]  into their sports shows and they talk about the coach I think he's underrated

[37:21.780 --> 37:27.820]  scientific evil trips are dying to do you poisoning don't get medical treatment
[37:27.820 --> 37:31.820]  but then there's all this sticky sweet stuff about loving the troops and get
[37:31.820 --> 37:37.420]  money for their kids so they can go to college and all the country music stars
[37:37.420 --> 37:42.020]  raising money for the troops cuz they're the best people we got meanwhile you
[37:42.020 --> 37:45.980]  only care about the troops though when you're told to on specific things it's
[37:45.980 --> 37:52.260]  all half an inch deep mile wide all had no cattle okay I'm gonna go back to the
[37:52.260 --> 37:59.660]  calls here and people are like hey that you they've been taking passports for
[37:59.660 --> 38:03.440]  about a 10 years if you own child support so it's alright it's kind of like
[38:03.440 --> 38:09.140]  saying we've had black slaves in the Americas for 250 years you can't get
[38:09.140 --> 38:13.660]  rid of it now I mean the Aztecs were chopping people's hearts out every day
[38:13.660 --> 38:18.500]  for thousands of years under the Mayan culture before them I mean why not bring
[38:18.500 --> 38:23.260]  it back they did it before I mean Jeffrey Dahmer grabbed 13 year olds off the
[38:23.260 --> 38:27.100]  street and torture him to death why not just you know it's been I love this
[38:27.100 --> 38:31.140]  idea that you know we've had the IRS and the private Federal Reserve running
[38:31.140 --> 38:41.260]  things for 98 years or 99 years since 1913 I mean what's wrong with it it's all
[38:41.260 --> 38:45.540]  about acclimating you there's no world government there's no urban warfare
[38:45.540 --> 38:49.380]  black helicopters and I sat there with a statesman writer who've been the
[38:49.380 --> 38:56.140]  former employee high level of the DPS and DPS intelligence and I'm in the
[38:56.140 --> 38:58.860]  interview and he's going so you believe there are these black helicopters I went
[38:58.860 --> 39:02.220]  alive interviews with the police chiefs they try to pay them off Thomas Sanchez
[39:02.220 --> 39:05.860]  urban warfare drills they went mm-hmm you see you believe they exist and I went
[39:05.860 --> 39:09.980]  well they do exist they're doing urban warfare drills to acclimate us it's part
[39:09.980 --> 39:13.100]  of this presidential decision directive to get us ready for martial law this is
[39:13.100 --> 39:16.660]  like 14 years ago and then they just went with the statesman Jones believes
[39:16.660 --> 39:21.780]  they exist and you know the guy was sitting there looking at me just just
[39:21.780 --> 39:26.620]  with just cold mercenary behavior he was an old guy fact his name's out there on
[39:26.620 --> 39:30.100]  the paper it's actually hanging on the wall we've got it framed is it so funny
[39:30.100 --> 39:33.740]  that we guys run me that black helicopter story and it's hanging on the wall right
[39:33.740 --> 39:38.540]  there I'll show it to the TV viewers Tim here our office dug through a bunch of
[39:38.540 --> 39:41.020]  the old boxes and how all these news clippings and framed them it's kind of
[39:41.020 --> 39:44.020]  cool to actually have stuff on the walls I'm always too busy even think about that
[39:44.020 --> 39:48.980]  and it's the one about preaching the conspiracy gospel on the station near
[39:48.980 --> 39:57.780]  you that's the headline on it guys it's right there now and and and he just sat
[39:57.780 --> 40:04.020]  there looking at me mm-hmm and he had that secure feeling you know he works
[40:04.020 --> 40:10.780]  for the system and the public is gonna get to laugh at me it's going to be
[40:10.780 --> 40:17.620]  funny and they're all gonna get to feel official and powerful and laugh at me
[40:17.620 --> 40:22.260]  and then when the urban warfare drill hits them they'll say doesn't exist so
[40:22.260 --> 40:26.220]  they were do a coup d'etat over a governor or something as the PDD state
[40:26.220 --> 40:31.100]  and as the John Warner fence authorization act 2007 states insurrection by
[40:31.100 --> 40:33.780]  state legislatures against the federal government which is run by foreign
[40:33.780 --> 40:38.980]  banks the captured occupied federal government here it is look here it is
[40:38.980 --> 40:45.740]  we'll show folks the document cam right here look at this Alex Jones preaching
[40:45.740 --> 40:50.420]  the conspiracy gospel at a station near you and that's only part of the article
[40:50.420 --> 40:59.060]  they had a separate article right next to it and of course it was Mike Kelly I
[40:59.060 --> 41:05.700]  mean it wasn't that bad of an article but still it's a conspiracy theory to
[41:05.700 --> 41:13.620]  report on things that are real and admit it oh wait a minute I happened to have
[41:13.620 --> 41:25.820]  the Fox News here what's this black hawk circle low through Chicago skies his
[41:25.820 --> 41:36.140]  secret service releases security details and it talks about the AM 8 6 little bird
[41:36.140 --> 41:40.180]  helicopters used by special forces circling through downtown Chicago skies
[41:40.180 --> 41:46.300]  made for a scary scene along the Chicago River rattled windows flying among the
[41:46.300 --> 41:51.260]  city skyscrapers the training exercise and you've got explosions and things
[41:51.260 --> 41:57.660]  going off but it's still a conspiracy children all right go ahead caller finish
[41:57.660 --> 42:02.220]  up your point sir okay one last point I wanted to make for those people who've
[42:02.220 --> 42:06.380]  got any doubts about a lot of things we talk about here there's a key term we
[42:06.380 --> 42:11.020]  got we they should look up tardive dyskinesia it's a neurological disease
[42:11.020 --> 42:15.460]  and this is just an incredible when you look up what this word means it's your
[42:15.460 --> 42:19.660]  tongue going in and out of your mouth uncontrollably it's permanent
[42:19.660 --> 42:26.220]  irreversible and guess where it comes from antipsychotic medication according
[42:26.220 --> 42:31.540]  to Yale you get one it's not just a rare side effect is 100% of the people if
[42:31.540 --> 42:35.420]  they're on this drug long enough are going to get tardive dyskinesia it's a
[42:35.420 --> 42:40.340]  key term people if this will this word will wake people up when you look it up
[42:40.340 --> 42:46.740]  and see what the word is well all I know is neurological disorders are all off
[42:46.740 --> 42:52.340]  the charts they're killing a seven ways to Sunday and it's funny to them that
[42:52.340 --> 42:59.860]  we're going into a THX 1138 situation they force on children right at 69%
[42:59.860 --> 43:06.700]  nationwide average of foster children are on seven or more psychotropic drugs
[43:06.700 --> 43:11.900]  seven on average there's been news reports documenting that and there've
[43:11.900 --> 43:14.860]  been doctors that have spoken out who even work in the CPS they say we get
[43:14.860 --> 43:18.540]  healthy kids we put them on drugs they start having problems we put them on
[43:18.540 --> 43:21.780]  more then they start having seizures from the drugs so we put them on even
[43:21.780 --> 43:26.220]  more and some of them were killing I remember that was in a WO AI TV
[43:26.220 --> 43:29.700]  investigation where whistleblower went public and then they had a state hearing
[43:29.700 --> 43:34.380]  about it it's in my film in game and the state head psych psychiatrist said well
[43:34.380 --> 43:41.500]  they have bad gene pools it's eugenics so we just do this to him I appreciate
[43:41.500 --> 43:47.340]  your call sir thank you okay let's go ahead and go to Tony in Toronto Canada
[43:47.340 --> 43:52.660]  you're on the air hi Alex how are you I'm all right I'm watching I'm kill
[43:52.660 --> 43:57.380]  everybody but it's okay yeah never dull moment Alex I'll try to make it quick
[43:57.380 --> 44:01.980]  I've been listening for ten years first-time caller and after ten years
[44:01.980 --> 44:08.180]  listening you have to say pretty well every single thing you've said come
[44:08.180 --> 44:12.540]  true I stopped watching TV about nine years ago after I woke up thanks to you
[44:12.540 --> 44:17.780]  and I constantly promote your show and when I tell listeners to tune in
[44:17.780 --> 44:22.060]  potential listeners I always tell them give Alex a chance I said he's very
[44:22.060 --> 44:29.260]  passionate but I always laugh and I tell him that I said many times Alex Jones
[44:29.260 --> 44:34.740]  has reported on things that sound outrageous and I can remember many times
[44:34.740 --> 44:42.060]  over ten years laughing saying that's impossible and 99 out of a hundred times
[44:42.060 --> 44:47.500]  Alex I've always laughed because everything you've reported on is
[44:47.500 --> 44:53.300]  absolutely conservative the numbers you've quoted it's many times worse so I
[44:53.300 --> 44:59.020]  have to congratulate you that you're you're way ahead of the curve well God
[44:59.020 --> 45:02.820]  bless you my friend good to hear you for the first time to hear a voice over ten
[45:02.820 --> 45:08.580]  years with me there's a total desperation to get out of this to beat
[45:08.580 --> 45:13.380]  them to to turn it back because I love humanity I love people just having good
[45:13.380 --> 45:17.740]  lives and going to the stars with my fellow humans and instead we've turned
[45:17.740 --> 45:23.980]  things over to the most wicked twisted people who enjoy hurting people so they
[45:23.980 --> 45:29.340]  can sit back and dominate these globalist can't be in control if we
[45:29.340 --> 45:34.460]  have a strong humanity so they are basically lobotomizing humanity so they
[45:34.460 --> 45:40.940]  can then feel superior and every fiber of my humanity and the species race
[45:40.940 --> 45:48.580]  memory strength of our of our species tells me revolt resist adapt overcome
[45:48.580 --> 45:55.220]  defeat and it's and I'm just one person we can do it together and I wish that I
[45:55.220 --> 45:59.740]  wasn't right about this stuff again look at the numbers they're killing us
[45:59.740 --> 46:05.020]  they're killing us everybody there's only a few thousand globalists they admit
[46:05.020 --> 46:10.060]  it themselves Rothkopf wrote super class six thousand super gophers less than
[46:10.060 --> 46:15.980]  20 families they are and I appreciate your call God bless anything else yes
[46:15.980 --> 46:19.260]  Alex I have some breaking news for you and I'll try to make it quick go ahead
[46:19.260 --> 46:22.620]  and I'm going to choose my words carefully because I have to protect who
[46:22.620 --> 46:26.860]  they are I have a very good friend whose spouse works for one of the largest
[46:26.860 --> 46:31.700]  banks in Canada this person is responsible for branches outside of
[46:31.700 --> 46:36.860]  Canada and I'm not going to say where they are and this person just recently a
[46:36.860 --> 46:43.100]  week ago confirmed they're working on a huge systems upgrade project where
[46:43.100 --> 46:49.460]  basically at the push of a button they can shut down ATM and access to people's
[46:49.460 --> 46:56.700]  bank accounts for up to 12 hours and when they come back online there'll be
[46:56.700 --> 47:03.900]  maximum withdrawal amounts put in and I was told this project is a huge priority
[47:03.900 --> 47:12.860]  and also the Bank of Canada I was told is backing or kind of pushing all the
[47:12.860 --> 47:20.500]  banks by offering them huge seven-figure bonuses if they meet the the criteria
[47:20.500 --> 47:25.140]  to have all the systems in place by a certain date I'm not sure what the date
[47:25.140 --> 47:30.100]  is and I guess Alex I'm also going to surmise that if they're working on
[47:30.100 --> 47:34.980]  branches outside of Canada these systems are either fully implemented or being
[47:34.980 --> 47:40.380]  implemented in Canada and you've reported on similar systems like this in the
[47:40.380 --> 47:44.500]  US they're getting ready for currency and withdrawals and bank holidays and I
[47:44.500 --> 47:50.460]  have the clip of the vice president Biden saying that he and John Corzine
[47:50.460 --> 47:54.980]  discussed the bank holiday and whether they need one or not this is a guy that
[47:54.980 --> 47:58.300]  will bank holiday by taking the money out of your account keeping it and again
[47:58.300 --> 48:02.620]  he gets away with it because this is a mafia of larcenist criminals with
[48:02.620 --> 48:09.180]  armies of scientists DARPA the CIA everything on their side and they just
[48:09.180 --> 48:12.940]  love it I mean they are it's just total criminals running around with their
[48:12.940 --> 48:17.820]  tongues hanging out with just super high-tech sci-fi technology on their
[48:17.820 --> 48:23.540]  side but they're still humans too and they're the scum of the earth but I've
[48:23.540 --> 48:26.700]  actually heard a lot of rumblings about that we've got embassy staff
[48:26.700 --> 48:31.660]  connections that have been giving us that same intel and there's no doubt this
[48:31.660 --> 48:35.180]  has already happened in Europe during many crises thank you so much for the
[48:35.180 --> 48:40.500]  call let's go ahead and take another phone call Jeff in Missouri you're on
[48:40.500 --> 48:47.820]  the air hello how you doing Alex good body hey I'm here in Missouri and if I
[48:47.820 --> 48:54.140]  want everybody to get their W2s and time you add up your federal state city
[48:54.140 --> 49:01.140]  Medicare so security tax you're damn near paying 50% of your income to the
[49:01.140 --> 49:04.140]  federal government in one form of another and then you got all the other
[49:04.140 --> 49:09.900]  property taxes and fines and fees and regulations America actually has one of
[49:09.900 --> 49:13.940]  the highest tax rates now in the industrialized world and if they would
[49:13.940 --> 49:19.020]  charge it charges all at once people would freak out because they divided up
[49:19.020 --> 49:25.060]  no one sees it it's a trap and remember the more you pay the less industry the
[49:25.060 --> 49:31.060]  less jobs and the more in debt you are because it's all on a gangster mafia
[49:31.060 --> 49:37.100]  two sets of book system where upwards of 76% goes out of the country all they
[49:37.100 --> 49:40.820]  talk about what's on budget but that's only the 20 something percent they keep
[49:40.820 --> 49:46.100]  it no matter how much you pay you we just go more bankrupt because it's designed
[49:46.100 --> 49:52.460]  to bankrupt us exactly nothing I want to talk about real quick is I'm a letter
[49:52.460 --> 49:56.420]  carrier for the post office and without going in too much detail they are
[49:56.420 --> 50:02.980]  destroying us on purpose out of course go ahead use your online bill pay for
[50:02.980 --> 50:08.220]  free right now but once the post office is destroyed then you think that online
[50:08.220 --> 50:12.700]  bill pay is going to be free no way no no listen the banks have said that they're
[50:12.700 --> 50:17.020]  pressuring a lot of companies make you get automatic transfer but they admit
[50:17.020 --> 50:21.060]  it's been public that is very soon well Bank of America already tried it they're
[50:21.060 --> 50:24.100]  gonna charge you when you do that and they're coming out with global and
[50:24.100 --> 50:29.580]  national taxes on all digital transfers anyways exactly once we're cashless
[50:29.580 --> 50:34.900]  they are going to make you pay giant fees and they're gonna shut down the
[50:34.900 --> 50:39.220]  entire underground market that's what Homeland Security's for it's right out
[50:39.220 --> 50:44.820]  of Stalinist Russia anything else sir and then yeah all right I'll give you
[50:44.820 --> 50:48.780]  another minute on the other side and then we're gonna go to Cameron and others
[50:48.780 --> 50:54.860]  and we've got at the eight after Ellen Watt joining us but it's just what would
[50:54.860 --> 50:58.860]  total criminals do if they had Buck Rogers technology that's the new world

[54:34.380 --> 54:39.300]  okay go ahead and finish up the points you were making Jeff real quick yeah I
[54:39.300 --> 54:45.140]  was just trying to tell everybody to go ahead use your emails use online bill
[54:45.140 --> 54:50.580]  pay watch them destroy us because once they pass the internet sensor bill so
[54:50.580 --> 54:55.620]  bill or its evil twin that's on right now they can turn off your internet and
[54:55.620 --> 55:00.740]  then there's nothing you can do won't be able to communicate with the outside
[55:00.740 --> 55:05.460]  by the way that's the plan they have these big internet consortium meetings
[55:05.460 --> 55:10.160]  they admit destroy the old economy using the web then shut down the open and
[55:10.160 --> 55:14.420]  free web and only allow the big players to operate it's just like the globalist
[55:14.420 --> 55:20.340]  with water systems dams infrastructure roads we build then they come in pay off
[55:20.340 --> 55:24.140]  the politicians to just hand it over to them and they call it privatization it's
[55:24.140 --> 55:28.260]  not it's hijacking good points absolutely you could say what you want
[55:28.260 --> 55:32.100]  about the post office but there's a continual demonization of the
[55:32.100 --> 55:38.260]  infrastructure of it to basically phase it down to nothing and to make it
[55:38.260 --> 55:42.540]  super expensive so they can start charging more most people don't even know
[55:42.540 --> 55:47.140]  how to use a letter now also it's very hard to spy on all the letters but
[55:47.140 --> 55:52.620]  everything that goes over email phones is being scanned by the NSA computers they
[55:52.620 --> 55:56.700]  now admit remember that was a wild theory that would be illegal I remember
[55:56.700 --> 56:00.540]  first being on air 17 years ago and I'd say echelon NSA system here's the
[56:00.540 --> 56:03.820]  congressional hearing they've got hubs at all the major telecommunications
[56:03.820 --> 56:09.540]  companies randomly reading your your faxes at phone calls and emails and
[56:09.540 --> 56:13.660]  people calling to go how dare you say that that's illegal never in America I
[56:13.660 --> 56:18.060]  work at the phone company and be like your digital cable box is tracking you
[56:18.060 --> 56:22.100]  here's the documents shut up I used to listen to you but you're a liar now it's
[56:22.100 --> 56:27.540]  just like well he's still bad but it's good they listen to us to find Al Qaeda and
[56:27.540 --> 56:31.500]  I'm like but Al Qaeda our government's putting them in charge in all these
[56:31.500 --> 56:35.740]  countries and set them up because it's not our government it's the bankers they
[56:35.740 --> 56:40.140]  fund the radical Muslims to so they can attack us to take our liberties and they
[56:40.140 --> 56:44.340]  just go well fine I'll give my liberties up then but I'm like but Al Qaeda works
[56:44.340 --> 56:48.340]  for them I mean there's even like associated press articles admitting the
[56:48.340 --> 56:56.060]  head of the 7-7 bombings in England MI 6 the head of the attack at Fort Hood and

[57:28.700 --> 57:32.820]  been cases before I've read about in the US and other countries where people come
[57:32.820 --> 57:36.300]  home and there's a criminal there who's claiming they're them and the cops have
[57:36.300 --> 57:39.940]  come and you know the person can't prove who they say they are and they've
[57:39.940 --> 57:44.340]  arrested the wrong guy that's what it is it's not our government but it sits there

[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:52.500]  poppies all of it and they keep drugs illegal so that the price will be higher
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:58.460]  so people will have to rob your house or rob your wife or rob you to pay it and
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:03.020]  that money goes back to the banks then when they catch the low-level zombies
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:07.300]  who were on their product they then put them in large private prisons owned by
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:13.300]  the big money laundering banks to then work for 25 cents an hour driving down
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:19.620]  wages and displacing your jobs and the good old boys cheer it and they say I
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:24.700]  work at the prison I work at the Justice Center and then their own sons in
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:29.500]  there and they're proud of it my boys in prison now I'm over him but that's a
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:34.940]  good thing that's America he got caught with some of them drugs because the only
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:41.420]  job was dealing drugs or run in the prison and that's the predatory New
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:46.260]  World Order economy Vicente Fox who is a globalist though it's probably pretty
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:50.980]  sad that his ranch is overrun down in Mexico and that the criminal government
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:54.820]  down there's gonna lose control see they've lost the war with smaller
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:10:00.220]  cartels who were the people are so poor they're ready to die they're not afraid
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:05.380]  to die pretty macho down in Mexico I mean it's more people dying every year
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:10.940]  than died in a year times three times at least three times the people die every
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:15.820]  year or more in Mexico in the fake drug war then died it on the US side in the
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:22.740]  Vietnam War every year it's 40 something thousand the last three years 58,000 died
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:27.460]  in over a decade of Vietnam so do the math and so now they're like ceasefire
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:34.220]  ceasefire let's decriminalize this stuff and at the sound of America's with all
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:40.340]  the hookers and the rest of it with all of this going on the news with the
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:47.140]  Latin American leaders was decriminalize stop it they know Europe and some
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:51.660]  areas has done this crime rates drop massively people didn't see drugs as a
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:55.660]  sad disease not as sexy associated with money I see the system has a two-prong
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:11:00.340]  attack get now over 20% of the population of women are higher men close to
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:05.180]  that school children over 20% on psychotropic brain damaging drugs when
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:08.420]  they go haywire and kill people they just then call for taking our guns and
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:12.980]  then also push the illegal drugs on them and the quote US government that means
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:15.540]  the big banks that run our government that launder the money and control the
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:20.220]  Federal Reserve they said no we're not getting rid of it in fact we're gonna
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:25.420]  keep shipping guns into Mexico and Honduras to keep destabilizing things
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:32.380]  we like it we like it just fine because the war on drugs is a success corrupt
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:36.940]  the police imprison the population bring in drugs kill the people with ODs
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:42.740]  destroy society have SWAT teams busting houses kill people kill people's dogs
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:48.020]  kill insurance salesman's wrong house corrupt the police you think prohibition
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:51.580]  10 years of alcohol prohibition tripling the size of the mafia corrupting
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:56.260]  police hundreds and hundreds of millions made in those days numbers a year you
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:12:01.140]  think that was a success prohibition for the mafia or was it a failure oh no
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:09.220]  don't make alcohol illegal that you just made it criminals and domain the
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:12.900]  government the feds deal with child molestation rules and kidnapping rules
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:17.380]  because they publicly run most the child kidnapping they'll make a big deal out
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:20.900]  of some loan scumbag but when they're loading little kids on C-130s to be
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:25.100]  flown to Saudi Arabia to have their heads beat in with claw hammers and snuff
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:29.340]  film with shotgun blast to the head you know what it comes out Italian news
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:33.140]  reports it German news reports it they fire the people that report it not
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:40.860]  because they were wrong but because US government officials are involved you
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:44.820]  got people that like to beat little kids heads in with hammers after they rape
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:51.620]  them that's who runs the world okay and go look at what I just said by the way
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:58.260]  you're gonna be like that's a true story oh yeah would you like to hear more
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:02.980]  it's kind of like Starship troopers on the news would you like to hear more we
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:06.540]  take you now to clandestine we take you now to the planet earth where the
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:11.780]  crazy people run things the New World Order is insane and I want to bring this
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:19.300]  up to top researchers a great researcher Alan Watt musician author radio
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:24.100]  host in his own right cutting the matrix.com I want to get him on with us
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:27.860]  and out of the gates here what he has to say today maybe hold him a little bit in
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:32.500]  the next hour and take some calls but I wanted to get Alan on today to bring up
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:36.620]  this point because I have a theory but it's not really a theory it's kind of
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:42.980]  like I have a theory that crawdads come up to the edge of the water and hunt
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:47.900]  little frogs and things little crawdads little freshwater lobsters little
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:53.540]  freshwater crustaceans it's not a theory I watch them do it I don't have a theory
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:14:01.820]  that ducks fly south in the winter and back north in the spring I know it and
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:06.220]  I've studied elites it's like a tropism in every case going back to the
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:11.140]  beginnings of civilization every culture built pyramids and sacrificed
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:16.180]  children on top of them every day every culture eight children every culture
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:23.340]  tortured people what is that that's what cultures always end in is it because
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:27.500]  psychopath inbred crazy people keep inbreeding they're the ones that are
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:30.860]  like cancer they're willing to do whatever to have power they lust after
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:34.820]  it and then something happens they interbreed which in every mammal species
[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:43.180]  causes crazy behavior antisocial behavior megalomania aggression a sense of
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:48.820]  psycho domination masochistic blood lust blood thirst every culture study
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:53.020]  history but then something worse happens syphilis has been with humans as long
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:57.340]  as we've been on this planet syphilis basically is microscopic worms that eat
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:03.900]  your brain and almost all elites that have been studied had syphilitic brains
[01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:09.420]  pharaohs mafia dons British royalty Jack the Ripper the crown prince running
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:14.940]  around killing people so you've got syphilitic brains interbreeding with
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:19.940]  aggressive dominant people creating hyper psychopathic blood drinking
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:24.540]  goblin creatures basically that's what the New World Order is that's why they
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:30.780]  do this why does a spider spin a certain web why does a squirrel bury nuts it's
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:36.340]  it's it's inbred into them normal wholesome people are blind to this
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:42.620]  because it's so alien if we can ever admit and discover this historically we
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:48.020]  wouldn't be doomed to repeat it alright I take you now to Canada and Alan Watt
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:51.260]  joining us Alan what do you think of my statements and what do you think of the
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:56.140]  the point I made with the inbreeding and the syphilitic brain overlay oh it's
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:16:01.780]  pretty accurate I mean even Lenin they found out the left part of his brain was
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:05.140]  pretty well it's in a way when he was when he died and of course it was
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:10.220]  insane basically for the last few months so it's a very common thing but
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:16.780]  it is because we turns up in the second and third generation of elite where they
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:21.860]  might all start off as gangsters or robbers or murderers probably all of
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:26.780]  a fact and if in the third generation forget the education come along and they
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:32.540]  start to form their clubs and then they discuss the normal topics like why are we
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:37.060]  so different from all the peasants that we rule over and they came up with their
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:40.940]  own theories and that what they came up with of course is there's always been
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:45.540]  slavery is a natural thing slavery is a natural thing and the peasants are
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:51.060]  always in a different mindset than we are because we're the leisure class and
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:55.500]  we have time to think about things that peasants doesn't and then of course the
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:58.580]  fourth generation comes along and then it's a good person actually can't think
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:03.660]  about that he's actually fever he's low IQ and this goes on for many many
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:08.300]  generations and until you hit the present time today you're ruled by the
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:13.100]  same descendants they'll be here for an awful long time an awful long time and
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:16.620]  again if you study the royalty the Rothschild's all of them generally half
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:20.180]  the offspring are locked up in asylums that's the half that survived
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:24.700]  generally about half die and then the half that live half are criminally
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:30.100]  insane literally be acting like monkeys and then the other half are just
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:34.100]  psychopathic control freaks the control freaks we must remember to these
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:39.780]  characters like the Rothschilds belong to their own secret societies and they
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:45.940]  have them and Benjamin Franklin in fact joined a couple of them in fact
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:51.900]  hellfire club yeah and one of the friends to the night sisters lodge and he
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:55.300]  lived the same kind of lifestyle as it is over in France when you see how much
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:59.980]  he he was given per month by the French government and the mansion if you come
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:04.420]  up and the parties he had endless parties and all the top women of the
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:12.420]  day etc he actually enjoyed that lifestyle but the thing is corruption
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:16.060]  has always ruled the world Charles Galton Darwin said the same thing and he
[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:21.060]  was a another inbred descended to Charles from Charles Darwin related to
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:25.620]  the Huxley's of course all the top names are all related together and he said
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:30.780]  there's always been slavery in one form or another and of course democracy is
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:35.900]  another form of a disabusing slavery and that with income taxes etc property
[01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:40.980]  taxes and he says we are in the process of creating a more efficient form of
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:46.620]  slavery that was the 1950s well you were seeing the birth pangs as they go
[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:50.380]  through all trading the public to be terrified because it was a Soviet system
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:56.340]  as well by the way and and we were supposed to be called under the threat
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:00.060]  of power being used against us it works very effectively as I say it worked
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:05.420]  terribly well the Soviet Union and the kill method here isn't taking you at
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:09.300]  the moment into the streets and shooting you the kill method is of course as
[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:16.100]  you mentioned earlier is to do with giving you cancers cancers and various
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:23.220]  diseases that you're never fully a hundred percent a fit nobody today is you
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:29.100]  can't be with inoculations and the poison foods etc elite don't get those
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:33.940]  injections they don't eat the food and by the way they brag about how they do it
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:37.580]  but when you tell the general public about this they're like oh that's scary
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:42.380]  I just decide that isn't true and the elites say see we openly admit we're
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:45.660]  killing them and they don't care and the mothers are like that's right I'm
[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:48.940]  taking my kid in to give him a cancer shot right now and then the mother will
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:52.100]  get attention when their kid dies a horrible death of cancer and that at
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:54.980]  the end of the day is really what matters it's like gee can my kid get
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:20:00.380]  cancer so I combine the cancer Barbie that's what they really want
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:04.340]  folks have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the

[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:28.580]  overthrow the natural creation ugliness is beautiful to them Alan you were
[01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:31.900]  getting into their admissions and what's incredible is we've posted all these
[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:35.700]  documents you've covered it they admit they're putting cancer viruses in the
[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:38.980]  vaccines we have videos of the inventors of some of the biggest vaccines
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:44.540]  joking about killing hundreds of millions and laughing on PBS and you
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:47.540]  talk to trendies and they go well there are too many people and I'm like listen
[01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:52.860]  you maggot you're being injected to the GMOs for you and they're like whatever
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:58.020]  it's like they think if they decide they've joined it it's like they're on
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:01.620]  the team even though they're being destroyed by it and that's part of the
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:07.740]  mind control Alan Watt continue yeah that's all part of the education in fact
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:11.700]  to get to school and social sciences there's many names for it but really in
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:17.540]  a new indoctrination into the value of life what is the value of life are we
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:23.300]  more important than those guys over in the sub Sahara or wherever and and the
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:29.140]  guardian and alternated a whole bunch into the death is good or will mention
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:33.380]  this to an oral that's a hoaxly and brave new world where the children are
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:38.020]  brought around the dying and they're big big party time and now of course we're
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:41.180]  getting into euthanasia now they've already been prepared for a whole
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:44.900]  generation has prepared the death it's all right and we should just celebrate
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:48.380]  it's and and from then it goes on to well why don't we just kill them off
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:52.460]  earlier there's too many people or the pensioners will take all the money to
[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:56.540]  the cost of fortune to keep them going I understand use of money for us and this
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:26:00.420]  is all happening right now as we speak and no one really understands how it's
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:05.180]  all connected we live through a plan everything from government is still the
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:11.220]  same part the same of the long-term agenda depopulation a sovietized world
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:15.260]  technically that's British it says sovietized world first to see where
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:18.780]  right now they haven't bludgeoned everybody to death they don't like
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:22.540]  they're simply doing the soft kill and bringing down the populations globally
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:27.700]  and whenever these third-world countries sign on to the United Nations and the
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:30.860]  bubbles they give them the bubbles are awfully good we've had it used on
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:34.980]  ourselves at one time a long time ago and they take the bubbles and then they
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:39.620]  take the injections from the World Health Organization and immediately the
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:45.620]  fertility problems and they have very early cancer on sets and especially in
[01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:50.340]  women too it disrupts her whole hormonal system meals as well turn into
[01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:54.740]  females almost and that's a bisphenose the estrogens they've known about the
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:58.980]  bisphenose since the late 1800s when they first discovered them they knew what
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:03.220]  it did to the public then and they waited till the 1950s to put it into the
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:08.300]  plastic bottles plastic pipes everything's plastic and only getting a good
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:13.260]  daily dose of it wherever you happen to be so you're under full-scale attack and
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:16.980]  you could understand this is not a happenstance thing from one president or
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:20.900]  prime minister to the other that there's not a difference between any president
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:25.900]  or prime minister they've all belonged to the same organization worldwide since
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:30.020]  the late 1800s and that's what Carl quickly talked about in his book
[01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:35.980]  Tragedy and Hope so it's hard for most folk to think that that can continue but
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:40.860]  it does you can understand how long the Soviet system lasted look at it took a
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:45.740]  hundred years to plan the takeover by the Bolsheviks a hundred years before
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:51.220]  even the first revolution in Russia these guys are wrong-term planners because
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:56.180]  the world is a goal and they work intergenerational and employ and train
[01:27:56.180 --> 01:28:00.300]  under intergenerational and now of course with the school systems being
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:05.220]  pretty well universal in curriculum you've got their own doctor needed from
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:10.580]  school the education is plummeted since the 50s and definitely definitely the
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:16.180]  60s every when on a rampage them and the children are simply indoctrinated into
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:21.940]  socialism and groupthink and especially in the US individuality is pretty well
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:26.420]  eradicated as a nasty thing to be an individual and the United Nations itself
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:30.980]  has said their main enemy to the whole agenda is individualism it must be
[01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:37.700]  destroyed so we are living through our plan we've got taxes that we the term
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:42.780]  are crippling the public never mind all the taxes on food that they're putting
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:47.020]  a tax year on canned across all of food stuff that's well now a value-added tax
[01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:53.900]  or GST HST is not what they call it it's all a value-added tax and we must go
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:57.320]  into value-added taxes because when you're signing all the free trade
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:01.280]  agreements then you're allowing to import from all those countries with which
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:05.220]  are tax exempt to the import customs therefore they don't want to lose that
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:09.300]  money they simply put that what they're losing on to you and make it up that way
[01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:12.940]  through your taxes that's why they had to bring in value-added taxes for all
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:17.900]  free trade countries the US is told to get really hit by that in any significant
[01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:21.780]  way all right stay there stay there Alan but what you're saying here is
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:27.380]  empires don't die they just reinvent themselves and this is a secretive
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:32.700]  illuminati cult that's much older than illuminati that's just one of the more
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:36.740]  modern names that understands how to control humans that has advanced
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:43.260]  technologies and who basically praise on humanity as a predator class which was
[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:48.060]  put into an allegorical form of the Morlocks and the Eloise by we're on the
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:59.260]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network I had tried

[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:15.500]  viruses in the vaccines the GMOs designed to sterilize this the elites all
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:19.060]  have their own private farms are obsessed with it Wall Street Journal LA
[01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:24.940]  Times won't eat GMO the Monsanto cafeterias at their elite facilities

[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:38.660]  this is the genetic engineers that's associated press the German the memos
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:42.420]  came out a few years ago said don't take vaccines and if you want them we have a
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:50.380]  quote clean vaccine that's real I take it personal I get upset last week we
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:55.820]  worked real late we're up here at 9 at night and I said guys you've really kicked
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:59.540]  some romp we've reached millions of extra people thanks to your work let me
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:07.580]  take you out to a Brazilian steakhouse we get there about 9 30 and there is a
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:13.100]  child obviously damaged and I go out on the street afterwards and see people
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:17.220]  with another child that's got neurological problems and I started
[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:22.860]  crying and I mean sobbing in front of the guys and they've never seen anything
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:26.100]  like it a few times on air I've kind of thought about something bring up the
[01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:33.300]  image because it gets to me this is a soft kill covert holocaust against
[01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:39.020]  humanity the West is dying 1.3 children for every two adults we're dying it's
[01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:44.940]  painful I'm not just some selfish idiot that wants to go whatever I'm going to
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:50.140]  drink beer watch a football game I love beauty I love poetry I love humanity I
[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:55.940]  love creativity I love the innocence of my children and I want them to have a
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:36:03.860]  future and I think about how we're in the grasp of highly intelligent inbred
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:11.900]  super psychos who base their culture on syphilitic hallucinations we're living
[01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:18.380]  in the creation of of hallucinating syphilitics I mean that's it this is
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:25.300]  planet syphilis brain and Hitler turned out had syphilis all of them Stalin
[01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:31.940]  Lenin all of them rotten brains I mean I now understand it we are living in the
[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:37.980]  in the in the wonderland of syphilitic crazy people and again even though they've
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:42.900]  cured syphilis or the treatments for it by the 40s the point is the whole
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:48.460]  culture is set by that inbreeding syphilis this is what demo side is this
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:52.260]  is why leaders throughout history right when they have total control just say
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:57.620]  black uniforms mass murder burn cities death that that's what somebody with
[01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:01.900]  syphilitic brain rot will just go out and start stabbing people will you give
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:07.180]  people because again the elites are you having sex with 20 30 women men a day
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:12.180]  Nero if I say people don't believe it you can look it up in the history Nero
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:17.180]  they would have these big day-long parties on holidays that they had
[01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:21.780]  basically every week and his favorite thing to do with all the Roman elite in
[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:26.380]  his palace is he would dress up like a werewolf they chain up a child and he'd
[01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:29.700]  run up you gotta read deeper to the histories because the mainlanders don't
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:33.580]  like to put this in there but he'd rape a child in public and then bite their
[01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:38.060]  throats out ripping their arteries out spraying blood all over him dressed up
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:44.900]  in a wolf's outfit what Caligula after he married his horse you don't get the
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:49.580]  full story on that he was married to it you know he made it the consulate the
[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:55.060]  head of Rome the head of the Roman Senate he would have the high priest you
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:58.900]  read tea leaves or they throw bones on the ground or they cut a bowl open and
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:04.580]  read their liver well he would he would have the high priest and that was one
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:10.540]  of the last straws for him read its excrement they all announced themselves
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:14.300]  God and that's what Ray Kurzweil and all we're doing oh we're God we're merging
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:18.300]  with the computers release the GMO whatever happens is natural because we
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:22.060]  did it and it's a mutation they're gonna destroy the planet okay they're
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:27.020]  crazy if Nero wants to marry his horse and rip children's throats out 2,000
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:31.220]  years ago or whatever or 1800 years ago or whatever that's and that's that that's
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:35.100]  bad enough they got nuclear weapons they've got any matter weapons they've
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:38.780]  got biological weapons and they're gonna kill everybody including they're
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:44.060]  building giant underground bases huge redoubts seed vaults total insanity and
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:48.900]  everybody that works for these people better start sabotaging them however you
[01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:52.820]  can to resist them and I don't mean physically I mean you just better start
[01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:56.980]  resisting however you can or there's no future Alan what can you feel the sense
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:39:00.540]  of immediacy you've got the floor what do you say about what I just broke down
[01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:05.860]  what's the latest on Alan watt cut into the matrix comms radar screen well
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:09.780]  they're they're definitely ready for a big call I mean I mean I mean a physical
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:14.860]  call as well you look at the nonsense with the Olympic games in London you've
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:20.140]  got a warship in the Thames you've got guided missile systems they're not
[01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:25.820]  bringing snipers and helicopters to go over the crowds army snipers I mean this
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:31.300]  is supposed to be a peacetime country and everyone is literally living inside
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:36.220]  a prison camp this is something you expect in a prison camp and I mean I'm a
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:41.340]  real high you know futuristic prison camp this is not a life for the general
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:48.180]  public but the training is we're using these these big games etc to get us all
[01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:52.900]  trained through that is we're attending the things yourselves or watching on
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:57.820]  television that this is the new system be very afraid of the new system because
[01:39:57.820 --> 01:40:02.780]  there are a lot of really nasty stuff to implement socially still yet and the
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:06.420]  training the people step-by-step through fear and to be honest with you that I
[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:13.780]  don't see any any peaceable way out of this because remember quickly said that
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:17.780]  these guys have been running all the countries in the West for since the late
[01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:23.020]  1800s with this particular agenda I cannot see them getting up because we
[01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:27.620]  asked them nicely I can't see them getting up if you didn't try to run
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:32.020]  your own guys in there into into the offices of the presidency can't see
[01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:35.860]  happening it's never happened in a hundred years it's always their boy gets
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:40.700]  in and so you're living through an agenda as I say but at the top of the
[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:45.580]  tree above even the syphilitics you have another group who do run the banking
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:49.540]  system they their names are generally never mentioned much in the papers at
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:52.740]  all because they're not open to the public they're not really public
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:56.620]  figures and they have their own particular agenda but you've got to go
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:41:00.460]  back as it's two ancient times to the present in this particular society as
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:04.820]  always said and Albert Pike said this he's on book moral and dogma for the
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:09.500]  Mason's the Bible of Freemasonry at the time he said he said those who will not
[01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:15.340]  use their own intellect to think for themselves are there for meat on the table
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:21.420]  and beasts of burden by choice and consent now that really is was taught to
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:25.780]  all the elite generation to generation that's a simple explanation they claim
[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:30.420]  as to why you're all down there and they're up there you see you are you're
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:35.780]  inferior species you are slaves and and you never complain if you complain it's
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:40.180]  always petitions and please please please to a bunch of wolves and you get
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:44.180]  nothing done and return for it doesn't work obviously so they know they're
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:48.940]  getting to a step where you understand democracy even as farce I call it farce
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:53.780]  it's never been democracy but the farce of democracy is to be eliminated all
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:58.340]  together eventually in the plan society where you have your own
[01:41:58.340 --> 01:42:02.300]  communitarian areas like they have in Britain they've got regions set up in
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:06.260]  the states as well they take power away from your local education authorities
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:10.420]  they give it to the to the state or even between three states so it gets further
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:14.780]  and further away the ability for the ordinary person to go and complain about
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:18.900]  anything to a politician or a representative or an official goes
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:23.060]  further and further away and that trains you that it is remote it is remote
[01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:26.980]  until eventually you don't even think about complaining to them it's just
[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:30.580]  out of the question you take it for granted you're now simply ruled by
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:36.500]  experts and scientists and that's how they've already trained the youngsters
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:41.660]  youngsters today are only trained in this they're getting that at school and it's
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:46.780]  a better way to claim and they can do away eventually with elections all
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:50.980]  together technocracy is a techniques now we've watched in Europe they place their
[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:56.060]  own boys from the central bank of Europe right into countries as the prime
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:43:01.260]  ministers no election that's to happen elsewhere too and in the states as well
[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:06.100]  I think in the US though they'll have a lot more trouble they do expect resistance
[01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:12.980]  more really when you expect the states such as simple not even rebellion being
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:16.780]  a personal level when people start losing their homes on mass that type of
[01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:21.460]  thing or they've been told there'd be no more private property under agenda 21
[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:25.580]  and they simply burn your house down with you in it or you evacuate so that's
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:32.500]  really what's happening so in the US there will be rag tag sporadic
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:40.420]  uncoordinated non-disciplined rebellion on small levels but look what
[01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:44.140]  they're ready for look at the ammunition they ordered in for the homeland
[01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:50.140]  security for close quarter battle you don't use your pistol dumb dumb bullets
[01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:56.860]  hollow points for overseas can't use them overseas against other armies you can
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:44:02.700]  only use them on your own population but they put 750 million rounds ordered
[01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:08.660]  what do you think that's for what do the people out there think that is for it's
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:12.340]  not for target practice it's too expensive for target practice you use the
[01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:17.980]  ordinary rounds for that it's simply for it to be used on the public so the
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:22.580]  leader are taking no chances whatsoever that anything possibly could go wrong but
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:29.260]  it also is very ominous because you're looking at a war situation where those
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:33.300]  who will represent government just like the henchmen in the Soviet Union will
[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:37.740]  that you might always make sure that and they do the selected guys the pre-selected
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:41.380]  guys out of the armies you know every every soldiers given psychological tests
[01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:45.780]  on the way and they know the ones and how many of them they can count on to be
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:50.260]  the new Soviet army in America that's right and the ones that are good they
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:53.820]  send them to fight the insurgents that are actually financed by the bankers and
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:45:00.620]  it's a full-spectrum dominance false system where they see an excuse to be in
[01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:04.660]  a country so they fund both sides to create the fake war and then the ones
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:09.020]  that like to be psychopaths and dominate and control everybody they bring them
[01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:12.340]  back here and put them in command to do and they've been doing that for years
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:16.460]  now every every person who applies to be a police officer is a psychological
[01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:23.660]  evaluation they don't want to want an IQ over 95 or 1990 98 but they want the
[01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:27.900]  brute force type ones the ones who get off on slaughter and power and watching
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:31.660]  civilians quiver in front of them that that's the type they've been employing
[01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:36.140]  and that very deliberately remember everything is nothing is happenstance
[01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:40.580]  okay well let me say this to you because because I know they're scientific they
[01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:46.500]  study every facet to the military industrial complex but but the globalists
[01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:51.260]  are not invincible I mean give me your take on that it depends how you see it
[01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:55.420]  understand most of what's happening today is through almost perfect
[01:45:55.420 --> 01:46:00.060]  conditioning generation by generation through the school system is taken over
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:06.980]  by entertainment and television and and people are pretty well perfectly
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:11.500]  conditioned they really will adapt to almost anything they know despite the
[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:15.260]  studies they've done already that the public the general public will adapt
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:19.700]  to almost every situation that you let me stop you're right there I was on an
[01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:22.940]  airplane and even wrote his name down and told Ted Anderson about it and he
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:27.340]  looked at it on his iPhone and then later I lost the guy's name but he was
[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:33.900]  one of the managing director presidents of one of the biggest banks in New
[01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:37.660]  York and I was being flown up there to be on the view so I was in first class
[01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:42.540]  with him he'd come to Austin to visit his dad that was a retired general and he
[01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:47.500]  knew who I was I later learned in the talk and he said look people will muddle
[01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:52.260]  through anything whatever we do they'll just adapt to it and we basically use
[01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:57.260]  that against him and and and I told him no humanity will prevail was kind of
[01:46:57.260 --> 01:47:01.220]  like Winston talking to O'Brien but Alan I'm gonna be honest with you there's
[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:06.300]  only one area with you that I don't totally agree with you and that's that
[01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:10.620]  that they've got their act completely together they have general programs they
[01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:14.460]  studied things they're worried about the wild card individual you've talked
[01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:18.260]  about that but I've also heard you talk about you know the elite will give us
[01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:23.540]  leaders and the elite will do all this well I know I'm for real I know that I
[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:27.620]  came out of nowhere by the you know going to access TV and stuff like that I
[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:32.420]  know you're for real and not controlled and I know so many other people in the
[01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:36.460]  system itself not just independence like us that don't like what's happening and
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:41.380]  I do see a bigger awakening and I do see victories you know people can't believe
[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:45.420]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove they think it must have been fake people can't
[01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:49.900]  believe that you know other stuff like they think my David Gergen is is fake
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:53.820]  well no they never just went and stood outside the main entrance to Madison
[01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:58.140]  Square Garden during the RNC in 2004 knowing bigwigs would come in to
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:02.180]  confront them I mean that's not rocket science to know okay there's one of the
[01:48:02.180 --> 01:48:06.380]  back entrances where all the VIPs are coming in let's sit here and eat hot
[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:12.020]  dogs you know to stand for an hour and see at the time smoke cigarettes see who
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:16.140]  comes in here hey that's David Gergen let's get him people who sit there on
[01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:21.180]  the bench cannot imagine men of action so all I'm saying is people have to
[01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:25.060]  believe they can take action because I know laying down is not going to do
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:30.900]  anything I mean what do you say to that well they know consistently the 80 or
[01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:36.140]  percent of the public will do nothing and again they've got all the statistics
[01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:39.020]  there are other countries that measured it did it with the Soviet Union
[01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:43.620]  Drozinski said at the time he says he says you can beat them you can you can
[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:47.620]  starve them he says will they turn around and fight he says no he says they'll eat
[01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:52.060]  each other now that wasn't the first time in history that's happened with
[01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:57.820]  overwhelming force but the public here haven't seen that you can read about
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:01.540]  the brutality on the occasional individual we see them tasering folk
[01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:05.300]  when they're down unconscious that kind of stuff we see them kicking punching
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:10.220]  them but again we always take it as to be the isolated incident you see it
[01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:16.100]  hasn't happened to most people yet and because of that they still think it's
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:20.180]  been exaggerated but when these cases come on television or the internet or
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:24.260]  whatever it's not happened to them them they would they'll actually do all they
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:29.820]  can to try and keep normalcy even though you're going through an abnormal
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:35.620]  situation and to keep the illusion of law and order while they break the law
[01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:39.780]  absolutely at the top which was honest about it they break the law all the time
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:46.980]  at the top and and so many ways I mean if the American people truly were American
[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:50.700]  people maybe the American person of today is not the American person of the
[01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:55.820]  1950s or 40s they would not put up with this what's happening today
[01:49:55.820 --> 01:50:01.340]  well that's the hormones I mean that's the hormones as you know people eat and
[01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:04.500]  compared to the 50s diet a lot healthier now and there are a lot more obese that's
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:07.980]  on record they're just killing us with the hormones and they love it it's in
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:13.780]  its fun yeah and but also it's to do with a massive education if you were ever
[01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:19.260]  to try and truly alter the main thing I mean Lenin said the same things down to
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:23.620]  it too you must pay your police your military and your teachers the best
[01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:28.940]  amounts of money and take care of them because the teachers especially train the
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:33.020]  next generation then indoctrinate the next generation in the agenda it's not
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:37.100]  the same agenda it's updated just like a computer gets up and by the way I saw
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:41.940]  this article where a six-year-old girl will talk about we get back briefly they
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:45.500]  don't let the parents discipline their children then the kids get out of control

[01:50:56.540 --> 01:51:02.380]  right back a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:05.860]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my
[01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:10.220]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:13.540]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:18.820]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:22.780]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:27.540]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:06.020]  another one here this is out of 13 WMAZ police handcuffs six-year-old girl for
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:09.940]  misbehaving and they said you're not allowed to spank your kids but we're
[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:13.860]  gonna taser them or handcuff them and they're charging her with resisting and
[01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:16.860]  now want to put her in the juvenile hall where she'll probably get gangraped and
[01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:20.140]  learn how to have diseases what is this all about we're about to go to break but
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:24.260]  tell us briefly again it's a Sovietization they use these techniques in
[01:57:24.260 --> 01:57:29.500]  the Soviet system and the training the public here to get used to it as well
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:35.420]  pretty well everything is happening as Sovietization the regionalism that the
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:38.780]  free trade agreement all came out of the council of foreign relations the
[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:41.740]  council of foreign relations is one of the main spearheads to control all of
[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:47.780]  this in the US and across the world to the run the EU parliament and they
[01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:51.620]  post on their own website in Britain that's there was their members that
[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:56.460]  brought in the personal income tax and the property tax in the States and in
[01:57:56.460 --> 01:58:00.860]  Britain I mean these guys want to bring in their plan society which they rule
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:05.660]  over totally with peasants going back to renting and of course to get the cash
[01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:09.700]  for renting you've got to be very politically correct look at interviews

[02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:31.420]  research into the globalist hierarchy we debate just how insurmountable this
[02:00:31.420 --> 02:00:38.260]  lodging ourselves from their grass fish but what about just a saddling the
[02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:44.780]  normal values having the TSA grope the TSA every day a new pedophile scandals
[02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:50.820]  HBO I don't know if you've seen this it is now promoting children doing things
[02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:55.660]  on TV I can't even say on radio and then and then you're bad if you're not into
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:58.980]  it the media makes fun of quote conservatives I'm not even what you
[02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:02.820]  call a conservative I'm not a sicko that wants to hurt innocence and then
[02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:07.420]  you've got all these comedians doing you know talking about how great abortion is
[02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:11.340]  and how killing babies is great you know they say it's fun it's like before it's
[02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:14.860]  like we just it's a right now it's like we like killing babies so so we're
[02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:21.060]  really seeing I guess they're turning the public into themselves I mean I mean
[02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:25.980]  what's going on here well remember to the whole manifesto and there's two or
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:30.780]  three manifestos for the lower middle and high that the top manifesto talked
[02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:34.460]  about they put up a pretty well accomplished for the majority of the
[02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:38.540]  public and that is the end of the family unit I've lost Canada so many
[02:01:38.540 --> 02:01:42.140]  youngsters phoning me and they've never known a dad most of them whole
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:46.740]  generation and so that was part of it because only the parents and generally
[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:51.740]  the meal would stand up for for protecting his wife and his children so
[02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:55.140]  that to be abolished once you destroy the family unit the meal if he's still a
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:58.980]  meal has nothing much to fight for except themselves you see and it's
[02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:01.940]  far more ferocious when he's fighting for the rights of his wife and children
[02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:06.180]  so you'd never allow with the grouping and all this kind of stuff to go on in
[02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:10.220]  the first place plus again the culture industries a big part of this in the
[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:15.020]  movies you can watch movie after movie and witness sex sex sex you you being
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:20.860]  again upgraded this program with the latest download and to the new normal
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:24.420]  the new normal well that's acceptable that's now it's like what girls watch
[02:02:24.420 --> 02:02:28.380]  and all this hardcore porn the women studies show don't even really like it
[02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:31.180]  but then the women start doing it because well that's what you're supposed
[02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:34.860]  to do yes and you've now got women dressing up like there's there's
[02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:39.860]  show children they go to these these parades these are these shows that they
[02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:45.460]  go to for for top beautiful child so I think this press like a little whore and
[02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:49.420]  the mother's dress exactly the same with them like an older whore I mean this is
[02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:54.060]  the new normal that's the new feminism is turning women into abject whores yeah
[02:02:54.060 --> 02:02:57.900]  yum and once you've done that you see you've destroyed the family unit there's
[02:02:57.900 --> 02:03:02.140]  no mail input into anything the males gonna watch all this stuff and maybe
[02:03:02.140 --> 02:03:06.380]  Google it too because they're because they're all degenerate as well but we
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:09.820]  all become degenerate through our indoctrination mainly through comedies
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:14.180]  and television the most perverse stuff but we'll start with in a comedy where
[02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:17.820]  where you don't want to turn it off you can't use to the characters and it comes
[02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:22.140]  near the middle of the story or the movie and and then you'll fall to see the
[02:03:22.140 --> 02:03:26.340]  end the same with thrillers and again because they know when they destroy your
[02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:31.500]  normal basic human programming they overwrite it so you can't recognize
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:37.140]  threats to society so you're just basically being wrecked psychologically this
[02:03:37.140 --> 02:03:42.740]  this is this is an attack yes yeah and at the United Nations remember to which
[02:03:42.740 --> 02:03:46.900]  is a big pusher of all of this stuff I mean that's the prime function is to
[02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:50.500]  destroy all the stuff and bring in a Sovietized type system the Sovietized
[02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:55.500]  system remembers Communitarianism where you it's all run by councils right down
[02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:59.900]  to your local level then are we getting back to to pedophilia and so on it's
[02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:04.380]  been taught gradually and this is a very old thing that they did try to push in
[02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:10.220]  even even in the Middle Ages at some countries that's holding your body from
[02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:15.380]  a person who wants the use of it is anti-social and they're teaching this
[02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:19.100]  gradually been teaching it for years now and that's so they can forcibly
[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:22.020]  inoculate you which is now beginning without parental consent and then the
[02:04:22.020 --> 02:04:26.660]  state says not only is it you're right now we're gonna make you the state wants

[02:05:55.380 --> 02:06:00.900]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had
[02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:04.700]  a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:08.820]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[02:06:08.820 --> 02:06:12.460]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:17.020]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[02:06:17.020 --> 02:06:21.500]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then

[02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:11.940]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:07:11.940 --> 02:07:16.300]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:20.380]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:24.940]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:07:24.940 --> 02:07:29.060]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[02:08:09.420 --> 02:08:13.660]  to your phone calls here in a moment Christopher first has been patient and
[02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:19.300]  others but Alan I wanted to talk to you about the acceleration of the cashless
[02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:23.460]  society we always said it was coming even if you use cash they're gonna
[02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:28.900]  thumb print or face scan you the IRS same thing rush is doing if they say you
[02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:33.900]  haven't paid taxes no judge your jury no no proof plus it's even paid to the
[02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:37.220]  private Federal Reserve so it's illegitimate and fraud then you can't
[02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:41.620]  leave the country they're saying we'll be able to have a job but you'll just be
[02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:47.740]  homeless all of this is coming into place open war against farmers ranchers
[02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:51.700]  we've got some big breaking news on the TSA it's now been announced they've got
[02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:56.660]  undercover officers on the streets a congresswoman has admitted this and on
[02:08:56.660 --> 02:09:02.100]  buses even here in Texas in Houston that's going up on info wars.com the
[02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:08.180]  next 30 minutes all of this is just I mean it's leaping forward and in the word
[02:09:08.180 --> 02:09:12.980]  games they play of how they're doing this all for our own good Alan what yeah
[02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:16.260]  it's our well-earned isn't everything they do is our well-earned it means the
[02:09:16.260 --> 02:09:21.940]  opposite of whatever they tell you it's for and it's going to escalate and
[02:09:21.940 --> 02:09:26.340]  escalate because they do know they do they expect kickback from all the laws
[02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:31.740]  that they're pushing through and they run these programs through the
[02:09:31.740 --> 02:09:36.140]  RAND Corporation even give estimates on sporadic violence here near kickback
[02:09:36.140 --> 02:09:40.500]  from the public who are very unhappy with what's happening and so they're
[02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:44.340]  making sure like all governments have done in the past by the way that they've
[02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:47.660]  got so many spies out there that they can't miss anything they can't reply
[02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:51.900]  totally on electronics they've got to also listen to conversations in bars in
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:56.660]  restaurants and buses wherever people are chatting that's what they're out for
[02:09:56.660 --> 02:10:00.260]  to take the pulse of the public to see if they're dumbed down talking about the
[02:10:00.260 --> 02:10:03.460]  latest movie or to talking about you know this is pretty awful what's
[02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:08.780]  happening the taxes and so on or America's becoming a scary place that's
[02:10:08.780 --> 02:10:13.180]  what they're out there to do Britain did it's even the early 1900s when they
[02:10:13.180 --> 02:10:18.980]  sent Lawrence oh oh baby see we're a few years ago if they hear you just say you
[02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:23.620]  don't like open borders they arrest you even though there's no law they arrest
[02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:28.420]  you just to create a total fear and I told people the TSA is the new Gestapo
[02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:33.580]  minimum wage thug which Stalin Hitler they all create their own little goon
[02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:39.020]  force and then expanded and they're now everywhere and again they're caught
[02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:43.540]  committing crimes everywhere they're just acclimating us to that and now
[02:10:43.540 --> 02:10:49.700]  they're admitting on Houston TV we got the report going up that yes the Congress
[02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:54.140]  woman is so proud of it they're there spying on everyone so now spying and
[02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:58.340]  people are like man it's good and then I randomly go to churches now to check
[02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:02.020]  them out and even little country churches are like worship your government
[02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:06.700]  I mean it's just total Soviet Union yeah because they'll belong to the World
[02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:10.260]  Council of Churches and Rockefeller started to up that very purpose long
[02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:14.660]  ago so you're living in a planned society we're going generation through
[02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:19.340]  generation through a plan and they'll update the plan once time tune it here
[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:23.100]  and there when they want it to be more effective but the reason they publish
[02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:28.740]  these articles themselves is to instill into everyone to be like the Soviets
[02:11:28.740 --> 02:11:32.180]  were to you walk along the street you look at the sidewalk don't look up don't
[02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:36.900]  look at the eyes don't make conversation you've been trained literally not to
[02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:40.340]  express your thoughts and you don't care if they kill you with GMO and cancer
[02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:44.820]  viruses and fluoride and radiation as long as everybody leaves you alone
[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:48.380]  you're you're coming so it's all these cowards who are just afraid of being
[02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:52.020]  looked at so that so they wear the proper outfit to be trendy whatever that
[02:11:52.020 --> 02:11:55.820]  is in their area and then that's just it and we better shut up you know the
[02:11:55.820 --> 02:11:59.620]  government's corrupt Alex is still a kook and crazy and so is Alan Watt but
[02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:03.660]  it's all real so we just better shut up yeah it's all training the public and
[02:12:03.660 --> 02:12:06.860]  again it's great too with their iPhones they can steer that instead of steering
[02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:13.260]  it people and and simply you live in your own little world out amongst the
[02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:17.700]  general public that's the whole training exercise of it how do we stop people out
[02:12:17.700 --> 02:12:20.780]  of the trance because I do see a lot of people coming out of the trance it is a
[02:12:20.780 --> 02:12:25.500]  minority but it's explosive compared to what it used to be mm-hmm and and you
[02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:30.500]  have to get ready to start expressing themselves understand any change at all
[02:12:30.500 --> 02:12:34.340]  and I'm talking about eating peaceful change will still take sacrifice of many
[02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:39.140]  individuals who are persecuted and tortured or killed until another
[02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:43.540]  tortured and killed until even the general public so you know this can't go on
[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:47.540]  and that's what's happened in the past when attorneys have risen up to this height
[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:54.380]  so it's not a matter of looking at for a big massive group to form generally fall
[02:12:54.380 --> 02:12:57.660]  back into the con game of politics they're infiltrated and then it goes
[02:12:57.660 --> 02:13:02.700]  round in circles both parties and correctly said that since late 1800s at
[02:13:02.700 --> 02:13:09.060]  the top levels have belonged to the same organization across the world so it's
[02:13:09.060 --> 02:13:13.660]  nothing new so you understand it's something else has to happen here
[02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:17.340]  everything of course is within the public's ability but the public are
[02:13:17.340 --> 02:13:21.700]  never unified on anything and they could stop going to work tomorrow they
[02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:25.020]  could stop driving their cars they could stop paying their taxes you stop doing
[02:13:25.020 --> 02:13:29.340]  a hundred things but they won't be unified in doing it and again the elites
[02:13:29.340 --> 02:13:35.060]  make sure that a good percentage are terrified of being singled out and
[02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:38.260]  they've been an example often that's the common thing they make an example of
[02:13:38.260 --> 02:13:44.020]  you or else if they are married or they have a partner or whatever the partner
[02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:47.300]  will nag no don't don't stick your head up don't bring the heat on our house and
[02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:51.900]  and so on so it's fear that keeps people down and the fear allows and so I give
[02:13:51.900 --> 02:13:55.860]  the kids the cancer shots because they might you know they might get in our
[02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:59.220]  face about it so go ahead and go ahead and brain damage our kid it's just oh
[02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:03.260]  yeah I mean there's no doubt about it I mean just going over the statistics and
[02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:07.380]  you can get anywhere pretty well the graphs for autism and the introduction
[02:14:07.380 --> 02:14:11.580]  in the 50s of all inoculations and they're both side-by-side in the same
[02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:16.460]  graph that says skyrockets well a pediatric cancer on average is up 10,000
[02:14:16.460 --> 02:14:23.540]  percent and I haven't done the graph on if it was if it if if roughly 30 something
[02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:30.140]  years ago autism was one in 25,340 something and then now depending on the
[02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:35.820]  actuary it's one in 65 or one in 54 it varies right in that area the imposter
[02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:39.260]  pull up the numbers on that I mean how many thousand point increase is that
[02:14:39.260 --> 02:14:44.500]  or diabetes I know it's like 3,000 percent for type 2 yeah and if you
[02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:49.460]  tack if you tack into that it's about one and four one and five who's got a
[02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:54.340]  form of autism because because really attention deficit hyperactivity all
[02:14:54.340 --> 02:14:59.780]  these things are simply degrees of the same thing real autism of course is
[02:14:59.780 --> 02:15:03.380]  when it's really pronounced and they can't look in the face and they can't pay
[02:15:03.380 --> 02:15:08.540]  attention to you at all but the people all these other categories as well now
[02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:13.820]  interesting enough to the World Health Organization announced about three four
[02:15:13.820 --> 02:15:19.860]  months ago and from their own website that they're getting ready for these
[02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:23.540]  third world countries that they're so-called liberating and bring into
[02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:27.220]  the new system to bring them up the standard of living well the first one
[02:15:27.220 --> 02:15:30.500]  is in the World Health Organization and it said they're going to have to do
[02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:35.340]  multi vaccinations on everyone and then it said they'll have to get ready for
[02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:39.340]  the sudden tremendous increase in cancers this is from the United Nations
[02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:45.500]  website they know what they're doing this is deliberate so you understand it's
[02:15:45.500 --> 02:15:49.660]  already happened to us oh yeah I saw a big American Medical Association report
[02:15:49.660 --> 02:15:53.980]  where they said we need to start giving children painkillers and tell them to go
[02:15:53.980 --> 02:15:57.340]  lie down and get in bed for a day when given the shots because it's freaking
[02:15:57.340 --> 02:16:00.940]  mothers out to give them the shot and they throw up get sick convulsed they're
[02:16:00.940 --> 02:16:05.860]  just like it's normal there's special things in this and all the doctors who've
[02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:08.380]  gone along with it they're not consciously aiding in a bedding but
[02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:12.380]  they have to like fully commit to it because they know it's crazy deep down
[02:16:12.380 --> 02:16:16.060]  yeah I mean it's just they're getting everybody ready it's just like it's time
[02:16:16.060 --> 02:16:21.180]  to die it's time to have fun you know increased death and early death and
[02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:24.860]  now becomes normal they normalize everything that they bring into the
[02:16:24.860 --> 02:16:31.300]  system and and you know right now it's not like having five people in your
[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:35.660]  speed dying all at once but eventually I'll get to that step and even then
[02:16:35.660 --> 02:16:39.780]  people will see what's going on and they want to believe the doctors excuses
[02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:44.860]  and it's just one of them things and etc. people always take the the easy way
[02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:48.420]  for their own mental or they think it's their mental health I won't look at the
[02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:53.460]  bad stuff I prefer to listen yeah that's delusion over reality yeah oh it's too
[02:16:53.460 --> 02:16:56.940]  scary they're doing this to my kid I'll just do it and hope everything's all
[02:16:56.940 --> 02:17:00.020]  right then they're kidding yeah the doctor the doctor will give you the
[02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:04.180]  scientific explanation of course which is no explanation at all it's just a
[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:08.380]  cover and that you'll want to believe it no no doctors will still lie and say
[02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:11.980]  there's not mercury and I've gotten my listeners to go give me the insert they
[02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:17.300]  go here's the femoris all the doctors like oh you got me because the mid-level
[02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:24.100]  folks get off online it's like a power to deceive somebody they enjoy it and
[02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:28.980]  that's what they do and actually understand the psychology behind all
[02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:33.340]  this even with the elite who affects them because as with the public go along
[02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:38.220]  and adapt to all this stuff they adapt to massive autism diabetes all the
[02:17:38.220 --> 02:17:41.940]  cancers juvenile and they always create a gimmick we'll have a race for breast
[02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:46.140]  cancer not to find a cure not to find out why it's up by several thousand
[02:17:46.140 --> 02:17:50.020]  percent and they'll make it fun like the kids are all getting cancer but they
[02:17:50.020 --> 02:17:55.140]  get a cancer Barbie put it back up oh yeah and that becomes cute not heavy
[02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:59.940]  all pros show I'm sure you know all the rest of them and because that's how they're
[02:17:59.940 --> 02:18:04.380]  all conditioned now it was through the big the big television talk shows like
[02:18:04.380 --> 02:18:08.500]  opera because 50 years ago they would put medical students on aircraft or
[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:14.020]  trains to fly and hundreds a day to come see a child with cancer but now we've
[02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:17.740]  been given the gift and people are like what's wrong with the cancer Barbie for
[02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:22.100]  kids with cancer no I'm saying let's find out why they're all getting cancer oh I
[02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:26.940]  happen to know the people running things are murdering our children and people
[02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:31.620]  are like well that's just too extreme yeah I know reality is extreme yes and
[02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:36.460]  I've built these massive new hospitals in the States and in Canada really big
[02:18:36.460 --> 02:18:42.780]  factory blocks huge things and to treat cancers and the dying and of course and
[02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:45.220]  near that of course you're offered euthanasia that's all we've got our
[02:18:45.220 --> 02:18:51.780]  new economy now prisons cancer wards brain damage diabetes the fruits of new
[02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:57.060]  world order NAFTA GATT no jobs giant crime waves huge prisons trudge and
[02:18:57.060 --> 02:19:02.260]  tasers taser bracelets children wearing tasers in school death murder stinking
[02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:07.580]  war millions of dead Iraq he's trendy it's which is it's wonderful Alan yeah
[02:19:07.580 --> 02:19:11.620]  that's what they that's what they've done and then again it turns so much off
[02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:16.740]  what was government's job you know one time over to private sectors including
[02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:23.860]  the health industries and Britain and elsewhere and no profit of course so
[02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:27.860]  then so then the next debate comes and always is costing too much to treat these
[02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:32.220]  people Alan stay there we've got to keep you even longer now I promise I'll get to

[02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:06.220]  bit of results but I wasn't following the regimen every day but Aaron Dykes in
[02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:11.140]  my office did and lost more than 60 pounds when I saw those results I said
[02:20:11.140 --> 02:20:15.140]  I better follow my own advice I started taking the ungevity products and it's
[02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:21.500]  been incredible 37 pounds in two months our bodies are amazing and God gave us
[02:20:21.500 --> 02:20:25.660]  an incredible gift but if our body doesn't have the tools it needs all of

[02:24:23.820 --> 02:24:27.420]  into Ted Nugent in this video that the establishment loblists are freaking out
[02:24:27.420 --> 02:24:32.100]  about where he talks about Obama being a criminal which he is a criminal but
[02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:37.980]  Mitt Romney's gonna save us and this is part of the mind game people play so I'm
[02:24:37.980 --> 02:24:41.180]  gonna talk about that coming up Christopher in Missouri you're on the

[02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:59.300]  the air yeah hi I'm just gonna talk about the situation that happened on
[02:24:59.300 --> 02:25:03.420]  Thursday I live in Modesto California I live like five blocks away from that
[02:25:03.420 --> 02:25:08.300]  where the sheriff deputy got killed on the big notice and I heard rumors that
[02:25:08.300 --> 02:25:12.380]  day when it was happening on Facebook feed that it was an army that actually
[02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:15.900]  did it and they couldn't find them they couldn't leave him bar he like
[02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:19.740]  barricaded himself in the building and when they burnt it up they found a body
[02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:26.420]  that I don't know if it's a girl or female yeah I saw that report and as they
[02:25:26.420 --> 02:25:32.220]  as they go to take farms ranches and I got the cops reportedly just burned it
[02:25:32.220 --> 02:25:36.100]  down the new thing is they're gonna burn you out but people aren't gonna just be
[02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:39.500]  waiting to be burned out in the future there's a lot of evidence they murdered
[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:44.180]  this guy up in Georgia burned his house down with a minute and we got there in
[02:25:44.180 --> 02:25:47.620]  the police said you're not allowed to film the city hall you're not allowed to
[02:25:47.620 --> 02:25:51.100]  enter this is not America is basically what they told us I played that
[02:25:51.100 --> 02:25:55.340]  yesterday Alan Watt we're gonna see more and more of this aren't we
[02:25:55.340 --> 02:25:59.740]  definitely again go back to the old videos you there's plenty up there on
[02:25:59.740 --> 02:26:04.860]  the net to do with the Soviet system in the Ukraine and in Russia where they
[02:26:04.860 --> 02:26:09.540]  sent armies after farmers and not all of them caved in and lots of them went
[02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:13.300]  down with their houses you seem firing back at the troops and so on as they
[02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:16.900]  tried to take off the only little bit of property they had and a livelihood
[02:26:16.900 --> 02:26:21.460]  away from them this is obviously again it's a global agenda it's not happening
[02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:24.900]  just in one country whatever happens to America is happy across the world at the
[02:26:24.900 --> 02:26:29.740]  same time because they're standardizing the culture of the world and the system
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:37.180]  of the world for global government you see well said anything else Skywalker one
[02:26:37.180 --> 02:26:40.460]  more I think I'm surprised to see that my neighborhood happening in front of my
[02:26:40.460 --> 02:26:45.100]  eyes but yesterday the two neighboring towns two people were killed by two
[02:26:45.100 --> 02:26:48.900]  different officers on two different incidents one was just a pulled over
[02:26:48.900 --> 02:26:53.180]  charge not actually one was a report for a family dispute but it turned into the
[02:26:53.180 --> 02:26:56.540]  officer had a shooting in the name of dying to the other what's gonna happen is
[02:26:56.540 --> 02:27:00.980]  the public's degenerating the police are degenerating and stressed out and
[02:27:00.980 --> 02:27:05.660]  there's five million guns or more being sold a month and the police are gonna
[02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:09.100]  start getting scared and they're gonna start killing people and so the public's
[02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:13.500]  gonna start just shooting when they see police which is a bad idea and that's
[02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:17.620]  what they want the globalist want a civil war thank you skywalker do you
[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:21.140]  agree with my statement on that now that the globalist don't care of the
[02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:24.660]  military and police get chewed up they want to have a civil war in North
[02:27:24.660 --> 02:27:29.780]  America I'd say so and in order to justify with overwhelming force and a
[02:27:29.780 --> 02:27:35.220]  pre-planned agenda of how the tackle at all to typical was left really down and
[02:27:35.220 --> 02:27:40.300]  into your beans and SPP says that as you know the North American Union documents
[02:27:40.300 --> 02:27:45.260]  we got they admit that mm-hmm and also to the police are not the same police
[02:27:45.260 --> 02:27:49.020]  there have been trains to be paranoid of the public for years now but they've
[02:27:49.020 --> 02:27:53.500]  also been given permission it's a tacit admission and permission to simply
[02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:57.860]  taser the people to death or shoot them kill them that's the inquiries go
[02:27:57.860 --> 02:28:01.980]  nowhere the inquiries is eventually they'll just do away with inquiries all
[02:28:01.980 --> 02:28:07.460]  together that's where it's going well said Alan let's now go to Jessica in
[02:28:07.460 --> 02:28:13.460]  Texas Jessica you're on the air welcome hi Alex I'm wondering what you think is
[02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:18.820]  the realistic level of complicity by the media politicians and Hollywood and
[02:28:18.820 --> 02:28:21.980]  bringing in the New World Order do you think that they're what they're
[02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:28.420]  helping to create or yeah I just talked to a national media figure today who was
[02:28:28.420 --> 02:28:31.220]  actually brought into the meeting and given the speech I was given years ago
[02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:35.180]  that sell out you'll get all this power and of course he's all freaked out about
[02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:42.460]  it but the point is that low-level media just regurgitates the national media at
[02:28:42.460 --> 02:28:46.700]  a local TV station you get national packages and then just read your voice
[02:28:46.700 --> 02:28:50.620]  so it looks like it's local or you stand there and read it so it's it's it's
[02:28:50.620 --> 02:28:54.220]  talking points most people are just thinking about how they want to go home
[02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:58.660]  and get drunk or go home and see their girlfriend or go to the park and you
[02:28:58.660 --> 02:29:05.060]  know play frisbee golf so it's a selfishness I'd say what 95% of people
[02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:10.340]  that work for the system don't know it Alan a lot of them but I see that a lot
[02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:14.820]  of them do know it as well she made a good point about Hollywood Hollywood is
[02:29:14.820 --> 02:29:19.580]  an essential arm it's the essential arm for the culture industry say what stay
[02:29:19.580 --> 02:29:22.140]  there and I want her to stay there too Jessica we're come back and have a
[02:29:22.140 --> 02:29:26.060]  follow-up and let Alan comment on that riveting information I'm not about locals
[02:29:26.060 --> 02:29:31.860]  95% oh yeah if you get into manager levels of Hollywood national TV and
[02:29:31.860 --> 02:29:35.180]  stuff these people are smart enough to know what's going on in the follow
[02:29:35.180 --> 02:29:40.740]  orders and they get off on it so yeah I agree with that statement so just enjoy
[02:29:40.740 --> 02:29:48.180]  then we'll be right back stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the

[02:31:56.900 --> 02:32:01.420]  ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size
[02:32:01.420 --> 02:32:05.940]  meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that
[02:32:05.940 --> 02:32:09.500]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[02:32:09.500 --> 02:32:13.500]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[02:32:13.500 --> 02:32:18.340]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[02:32:18.340 --> 02:32:22.740]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best

[02:33:06.220 --> 02:33:14.420]  on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network I
[02:33:14.420 --> 02:33:19.620]  was just looking at info wars dot com and one of the top stories there in the
[02:33:19.620 --> 02:33:24.140]  tiles John Stewart exposes the fraud of the
[02:33:24.140 --> 02:33:29.900]  Federal Reserve John Stewart's brother is the head of the New York Stock Exchange
[02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:37.660]  John Stewart's a fake stage name and you talk about victory the fact that 15
[02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:42.700]  years ago I would have national media call me and say you are insane the
[02:33:42.700 --> 02:33:49.180]  Federal Reserve is not private and it's racist to say it is I'm racist you know
[02:33:49.180 --> 02:33:55.020]  that they would inject that don't like government health care you're racist they
[02:33:55.020 --> 02:34:03.340]  just throw that in there doesn't make any sense non sequitur they do it and now
[02:34:03.340 --> 02:34:07.180]  all these years later over 90% major polls know the Federal Reserve is private
[02:34:07.180 --> 02:34:13.660]  so now John Stewart can expose it to his idiot viewers of course they'll just
[02:34:13.660 --> 02:34:21.540]  change the name I predict when the charter comes up next year in 2013 that
[02:34:21.540 --> 02:34:24.380]  they're going to change the name of it they're going to reincorporate same
[02:34:24.380 --> 02:34:32.860]  owners new name at least they're going to try it now going back to Alan Watt
[02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:37.820]  and Jessica in Texas Alan you were cut off by the break getting into Hollywood
[02:34:37.820 --> 02:34:42.300]  and how many people in the media system know what they're doing go ahead well
[02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:50.460]  I've got a list of the CFR members from their own website in the US and anybody
[02:34:50.460 --> 02:34:54.580]  who's any kind of reporter at all across the whole country and the world is a
[02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:58.580]  member of the Council on Foreign Relations you can't join it you have to be
[02:34:58.580 --> 02:35:02.660]  asked to join after you've been vetted for your your opinions on things will
[02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:07.980]  you go along with this agenda yep that's it and and getting back to Hollywood
[02:35:07.980 --> 02:35:14.180]  though Hollywood it's almost like an invasion into the US I don't people you
[02:35:14.180 --> 02:35:18.260]  don't even know how it started from from the European guilds that came over
[02:35:18.260 --> 02:35:24.380]  especially when when Hitler was coming in and they started pushing the
[02:35:24.380 --> 02:35:29.140]  communist ideals through movies right away again destruction the family unit
[02:35:29.140 --> 02:35:34.980]  affairs everybody had affairs in the movies made it exciting and the same
[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:41.020]  techniques were used until of course they had the anti-American hearings of
[02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:46.740]  course and even the top owners of some of these big television companies a big
[02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:51.140]  movie companies had to admit that employed lots of writers and that they
[02:35:51.140 --> 02:35:54.180]  blame the writers for bringing all its communistic stuff and all the
[02:35:54.180 --> 02:35:58.340]  agendas and then they cooled it down for years and gave you nothing but westerns
[02:35:58.340 --> 02:36:01.940]  after that you remember that they lost and lots and lots of westerns with not
[02:36:01.940 --> 02:36:07.380]  too much political mention at all and in the dialogue but then they went back
[02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:12.860]  again yeah just pro-war so they shifted yeah and again folks in Hollywood have
[02:36:12.860 --> 02:36:17.460]  admitted that they saw it as revolutionaries to destroy Christianity
[02:36:17.460 --> 02:36:22.940]  and destroy the family ethic to render us down to be weak servile minions that's
[02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:26.980]  right and also Sarah Sarah Sarandon came on television at one of the big
[02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:32.660]  meetings big big award things for actors and producers she's on live
[02:36:32.660 --> 02:36:36.820]  television along with Michael Moore of course and she said we are the culture
[02:36:36.820 --> 02:36:41.820]  creators so see that's how they refer to themselves in the industry not not they
[02:36:41.820 --> 02:36:45.820]  don't follow culture they create the next part of culture they update you you
[02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:49.340]  see and that's well known amongst all the Hollywood peoples what they're
[02:36:49.340 --> 02:36:55.140]  actually doing they are the prime people to give us our thoughts our
[02:36:55.140 --> 02:36:59.380]  emotions about things most folk think emotionally don't think through logic
[02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:04.660]  and you remember that the scenes etc with emotion attached to it and of course
[02:37:04.660 --> 02:37:09.060]  they don't understand that this is all to affect you and by the way I have at
[02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:15.460]  the highest levels take Jesse Ventura's TV show when we actually got shows on
[02:37:15.460 --> 02:37:21.020]  about FEMA camps and the takeover plans homeland security threaten people once
[02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:24.180]  you once you're part of something and as a journalist you promise not to reveal
[02:37:24.180 --> 02:37:30.900]  things I can't go into all of it but it was stuff being broken into threats not
[02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:35.580]  just congressmen calling and they took that show off the air and then now
[02:37:35.580 --> 02:37:38.500]  basically I'm not even gonna get into it people are like where's the third
[02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:44.260]  season well the point is that it's real and I just talked to another national
[02:37:44.260 --> 02:37:50.380]  media figure earlier who said oh my god it's all real and I know all the behind
[02:37:50.380 --> 02:37:53.460]  the scenes stuff and of course he's like in confidence you know I'm gonna tell
[02:37:53.460 --> 02:37:59.420]  you this now because this was in confidence and it's so real it's so real
[02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:05.580]  it's so real people say well if you were in media meetings over the years and
[02:38:05.580 --> 02:38:09.820]  people offered you jobs and admitted the new world order was real why don't you
[02:38:09.820 --> 02:38:13.500]  expose them because they say as a journalist or in business we're gonna
[02:38:13.500 --> 02:38:17.980]  offer you this but this is off record if I ever break an oath then there's no
[02:38:17.980 --> 02:38:21.420]  point people ever giving me information now if it was of a criminal act like
[02:38:21.420 --> 02:38:25.380]  hurting children or something I would break it or a bank robbery but it's
[02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:34.300]  and it's also the way they the way they do it I'm just telling them that when
[02:38:34.300 --> 02:38:36.900]  I'm talking to fade the collar down because there's a buzz on the line the
[02:38:36.900 --> 02:38:43.860]  point is that that when you're sitting there talking to people and you know
[02:38:43.860 --> 02:38:46.780]  it's like well yeah there's got to be a global government to help people and
[02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:50.980]  we've got to you know get rid of this system to bring it in and we're gonna
[02:38:50.980 --> 02:38:55.060]  help others and it needs to be managed and yeah it's real but the public
[02:38:55.060 --> 02:38:58.260]  doesn't want freedom the fact that you're to the point you've gotten means
[02:38:58.260 --> 02:39:04.060]  you're one of us you're successful join the team it's almost like they live when
[02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:06.860]  they get into the underground complex and they see the guy they thought was
[02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:11.020]  just a bomb it was really a spy working with the off-worlders and he's like hey
[02:39:11.020 --> 02:39:15.620]  guys good to know you made it gotta get yourself some fancier duds now that
[02:39:15.620 --> 02:39:20.760]  you've joined the team let's go on in and he's like incredible technology hidden
[02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:25.300]  boys it's good to be on the winning team isn't it you know you want it you
[02:39:25.300 --> 02:39:29.700]  know you wanted to join the team boy I'm sorry go ahead Alan well that's
[02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:36.780]  exactly how it is and so self-interest and ego is pampered too and and most
[02:39:36.780 --> 02:39:40.620]  people take the baits and go with it think okay I'm I don't belong to the
[02:39:40.620 --> 02:39:44.420]  masses anymore I belong to the better a group and that's how they literally see
[02:39:44.420 --> 02:39:49.900]  it and talk about it amongst themselves so but the Hollywood itself is is the
[02:39:49.900 --> 02:39:54.460]  culture in this industry which gives you the updates on the culture and the
[02:39:54.460 --> 02:39:57.860]  people follow it's because monkey see monkey do that's what they said you
[02:39:57.860 --> 02:40:01.660]  know it's 60 years ago and Hollywood have you had him come to you and say
[02:40:01.660 --> 02:40:05.420]  Alan you're really smart you know you really know what's going on join us
[02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:09.180]  because because that's the speech everybody gets I've been approached by
[02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:13.380]  the top ones who've asked me to come to their own table societies for global
[02:40:13.380 --> 02:40:16.700]  citizenship committees I have to I've been invited to the U.N. everything yeah
[02:40:16.700 --> 02:40:22.100]  yeah and of course I won't take the baits because and I know too if I did I'd
[02:40:22.100 --> 02:40:25.900]  be sitting on an easy no you get there and there's like a gorgeous woman who's
[02:40:25.900 --> 02:40:29.180]  gonna be with you for the weekend and all these business opportunities it'd be
[02:40:29.180 --> 02:40:33.060]  like people like oh that sounds great sell out sell out no it is a heartless
[02:40:33.060 --> 02:40:37.260]  soulless system I will not yeah and then it even offered to you you'll do all
[02:40:37.260 --> 02:40:40.660]  that you don't write your own books to ghost writers or just turn up books for
[02:40:40.660 --> 02:40:46.060]  you and one after another you know and and so it's because you're useful what's
[02:40:46.060 --> 02:40:49.220]  your public figure you see they can use you know they told me you'll be a big
[02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:55.420]  national talk show host who's young like Limbaugh you'll be on TV I was described
[02:40:55.420 --> 02:41:00.340]  Glenn Beck's job before he even had a political show three separate times by
[02:41:00.340 --> 02:41:04.820]  different groups I mean they were looking for the new Glenn Beck well yeah
[02:41:04.820 --> 02:41:08.100]  and it's in the council and foreign relations own reports I have them here
[02:41:08.100 --> 02:41:12.900]  where a few years ago I kept them all where they said that they'd have to take
[02:41:12.900 --> 02:41:18.540]  on board more celebrity figures in the culture actors even talk show hosts and
[02:41:18.540 --> 02:41:22.260]  bring them on board because the public will follow them like sheep you see and
[02:41:22.260 --> 02:41:28.300]  as many did they recruit quite a few from Hollywood now to lead the fans along
[02:41:28.300 --> 02:41:34.340]  this new way of thinking of globalism internationalism and and of course the
[02:41:34.340 --> 02:41:37.580]  people are already going along with them whatever they say must they'll start
[02:41:37.580 --> 02:41:43.140]  partying it too and notice they take people like like Charlie Rose and he's
[02:41:43.140 --> 02:41:47.460]  got ABC shows he's got PBS shows and he's one of the few journalists allowed
[02:41:47.460 --> 02:41:50.820]  into Bilderberg let's go back to Jessica Jessica does that answer your
[02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:55.820]  question yes and I'd also just like to say that I noticed how you often make
[02:41:55.820 --> 02:41:59.220]  reference to historical events and I think that's really important in giving
[02:41:59.220 --> 02:42:03.140]  people context for what's going on now and I was hoping that you would
[02:42:03.140 --> 02:42:08.100]  consider having a contest for writers in addition to your contest for reporters
[02:42:08.100 --> 02:42:12.380]  so that people like me have a platform to submit the things that we write about
[02:42:12.380 --> 02:42:16.460]  in the research that we do well number one if anybody can submit stuff to
[02:42:16.460 --> 02:42:21.380]  writers and info wars calm and from your blog or whatever we'll post it with a
[02:42:21.380 --> 02:42:24.860]  link you know at the top to your blog if we can read over it and find that we
[02:42:24.860 --> 02:42:29.260]  you'll think it's accurate information so you can write for info wars calm I
[02:42:29.260 --> 02:42:32.060]  mean I don't do what other people do is go through all the other sites and try
[02:42:32.060 --> 02:42:35.780]  to take people's contributors and sometimes sites that want us to post
[02:42:35.780 --> 02:42:39.980]  their stuff later say don't post it and I like their Alexa rating drop you know
[02:42:39.980 --> 02:42:43.540]  because they they think that you know being on our site it actually takes
[02:42:43.540 --> 02:42:47.540]  traffic when it actually gives them traffic but all we care about is getting
[02:42:47.540 --> 02:42:51.660]  the info out so if you'd like to write stories for us go ahead but a on staff
[02:42:51.660 --> 02:42:56.260]  writer job would be good we just have the limited capital in the final equation
[02:42:56.260 --> 02:42:59.540]  if I can you'll pay my people a living wage and try to give them you know
[02:42:59.540 --> 02:43:03.340]  bonuses so they can be comfortable in their work I can't hire that many more
[02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:07.460]  people but we're working on it thank you so much let's jam in some other calls
[02:43:07.460 --> 02:43:14.500]  now quickly Judy in Florida you're on the air go ahead hey this is a dream phone
[02:43:14.500 --> 02:43:18.380]  call for me I've actually spoken with both of you gentlemen and it's an honor
[02:43:18.380 --> 02:43:26.460]  to speak with you now can you hear me okay yes we can good um what I've been
[02:43:26.460 --> 02:43:32.500]  thinking while I've been listening to you and just what I consider a lot is
[02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:36.500]  that you know we're we're in a time right now where I think it's going to
[02:43:36.500 --> 02:43:44.220]  probably be probably fairly soon some type of false flag and I hope I'm wrong
[02:43:44.220 --> 02:43:50.500]  but um it seems as though there's two paths either the acceleration is
[02:43:50.500 --> 02:43:56.140]  occurring because as I've heard Alan say we are the globalists are right on
[02:43:56.140 --> 02:44:02.100]  course or they can be just as fearful as they're trying to make us and I was
[02:44:02.100 --> 02:44:08.420]  wondering what your thoughts are both of you on whether or not if there was a
[02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:14.020]  day when everyone including those with memes those in Hollywood that had
[02:44:14.020 --> 02:44:21.460]  consciences people I mean there's organizations that I sure a day a day
[02:44:21.460 --> 02:44:29.820]  that we do what in order to internationally show a you know not
[02:44:29.820 --> 02:44:35.260]  just a disdain but but to you know go to government places and say we want
[02:44:35.260 --> 02:44:40.260]  individuals removed we want this to happen now and to show this peaceful
[02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:44.820]  force of people that will be sure sure here's the deal like shark teeth and I
[02:44:44.820 --> 02:44:48.900]  appreciate your call another row of teeth will roll up you've got to expose
[02:44:48.900 --> 02:44:53.140]  the entire false system or they'll just replace it with new puppets you've got
[02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:57.700]  to have a full awakening and brzezinski did say a few years ago that
[02:44:57.700 --> 02:45:01.900]  humanity's waking up politically for the first time in history to the man
[02:45:01.900 --> 02:45:06.300]  behind the throne and in that is the victory in realizing you're in a
[02:45:06.300 --> 02:45:12.940]  manipulated scientific dictatorship in in that you know I'm not saying it's a
[02:45:12.940 --> 02:45:16.820]  bad idea just to go have a day but we need like it not an anti corporate day
[02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:22.500]  or an anti whatever day an anti scientific dictatorship day Alan you do
[02:45:22.500 --> 02:45:28.580]  but you also have to also write about and get into how many non-governmental
[02:45:28.580 --> 02:45:32.260]  organizations are attached to every government across the world the same
[02:45:32.260 --> 02:45:36.900]  ones by the way by the same foundations who help make policy for
[02:45:36.900 --> 02:45:41.380]  governments to run remember the Biden conquer was initial way of the communist
[02:45:41.380 --> 02:45:45.220]  system and under different names the same same system same guys same people
[02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:51.500]  pushing the same stuff and so many so much the business in society now right
[02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:55.500]  so the child means no rights of the parents they've got men and women as a
[02:45:55.500 --> 02:45:59.500]  couple almost eliminated and that because they really you want to defeat the new
[02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:04.100]  world order get families back get humanity back that's how you defeat the
[02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:08.620]  new world order literally wipe out I mean I mean get rid of this this expel and
[02:46:08.620 --> 02:46:13.300]  all all these governmental organizations that now we're appointees to
[02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:18.020]  governments across the world are the same ones and the ones that cause the
[02:46:18.020 --> 02:46:22.300]  divisiveness etc etc and who know the agenda and know their part in it and
[02:46:22.300 --> 02:46:26.020]  who get legislation on the books they have you don't elect them in and
[02:46:26.020 --> 02:46:29.700]  therefore they shouldn't be there at all you're right the unelected boards the
[02:46:29.700 --> 02:46:34.580]  NGOs the shadow government kick it out identify the shadow government the
[02:46:34.580 --> 02:46:38.820]  parasite legitimate system kick it out get rid of the Federal Reserve get rid
[02:46:38.820 --> 02:46:42.980]  of it all great points Richard in Canada Richard you're on the air go ahead
[02:46:42.980 --> 02:46:47.900]  yeah hi guys I just wanted to say growing up in this little town I live
[02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:55.300]  in in Canada the four main pedophiles one was a cop not to put down police
[02:46:55.300 --> 02:47:00.780]  officers because of you know bad apple one was a priest one was a teacher and
[02:47:00.780 --> 02:47:08.060]  the fourth one was a high-ranking member of the Mormon church and the other thing
[02:47:08.060 --> 02:47:12.580]  I want to point out is no no I'm 40 years old and you know I've been I've
[02:47:12.580 --> 02:47:18.380]  we we tend to look at pedophiles as being a an old man but I'm of that
[02:47:18.380 --> 02:47:23.580]  generation now I'm of that age group where you know you know look at my
[02:47:23.580 --> 02:47:28.260]  Miley Cyrus and Billy Ray and and the half-naked pictures of them on on
[02:47:28.260 --> 02:47:33.220]  television and this sort of thing and I don't know maybe maybe I'm not making a
[02:47:33.220 --> 02:47:38.260]  lot of sense but I just I'm seeing the demise of our society and the pedophilia
[02:47:38.260 --> 02:47:44.740]  look it's just like Rome it's just like the Aztecs we're a society in deep deep
[02:47:44.740 --> 02:47:51.100]  decadence and it seems like it's organized sure sure go ahead Alan here's
[02:47:51.100 --> 02:47:55.540]  the kicker for this one they want to do away with the name pedophilia altogether
[02:47:55.540 --> 02:47:59.740]  the World Health Organization that the United Nations has said this and the
[02:47:59.740 --> 02:48:03.540]  International Department of Sensors that their meetings every year Nambla is an
[02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:08.700]  NGO exactly they love Nambla they love it well they actually say that they want
[02:48:08.700 --> 02:48:12.340]  to do away to professors said at the same time same script actually carried
[02:48:12.340 --> 02:48:16.620]  in the states at the last census it sent saw a meeting for television
[02:48:16.620 --> 02:48:20.340]  internationally that they had they said now they will have won the rights for
[02:48:20.340 --> 02:48:25.700]  homosexuality we must now go into removing pedophilia from the books
[02:48:25.700 --> 02:48:30.780]  and introducing animal human sex and bestiality that was in one of the bills
[02:48:30.780 --> 02:48:35.780]  they passed that the troops can have sex with animals on base yeah United Nations
[02:48:35.780 --> 02:48:40.220]  and professors at universities etc because you understand everything that
[02:48:40.220 --> 02:48:44.860]  they introduced this way causes an opposite reaction that there's chaos in
[02:48:44.860 --> 02:48:49.020]  different new areas now and then the government steps in with even more
[02:48:49.020 --> 02:48:53.380]  authority new bureaucracies to deal with all and before you know it no family at
[02:48:53.380 --> 02:48:58.700]  all exactly and before you know it you're a pedophobe you're a bad person
[02:48:58.700 --> 02:49:02.260]  because you don't want them grabbing your five-year-old yeah that's right so
[02:49:02.260 --> 02:49:05.820]  that's the whole thing government wants to get to run everybody's life from
[02:49:05.820 --> 02:49:11.380]  cradle to grave and so the more chaos they can introduce by the legislation
[02:49:11.380 --> 02:49:16.780]  the better for them and now they've got to eat and someone sent me a disc I
[02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:19.940]  don't watch television so they sent me a disc from what's showing in Britain and
[02:49:19.940 --> 02:49:26.140]  they're showing you 12 years 13 year old girls with guys in their 50s 60s and
[02:49:26.140 --> 02:49:31.780]  how much and parties eating fetuses yes that too so so you're being totally
[02:49:31.780 --> 02:49:36.220]  degraded and degenerated until you cannot take care of yourself or your own
[02:49:36.220 --> 02:49:41.100]  that's a whole purpose of this it's a war and then just like in one of the old
[02:49:41.100 --> 02:49:44.340]  books the Bible is it Genesis where they're in Sodom and Gomorrah and the
[02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:47.940]  guys come to the door and bang on it say give us your kids yeah give your
[02:49:47.940 --> 02:49:52.220]  children and your and your boys I mean I was really the boys that were after you
[02:49:52.220 --> 02:49:55.740]  know and and of course he offered his wife to them he didn't but they didn't
[02:49:55.740 --> 02:49:59.700]  want the wife that's right they he's like here's my wife they're like no we
[02:49:59.700 --> 02:50:04.660]  want your little kids they want to wreck the innocence it's always the Legion
[02:50:04.660 --> 02:50:09.620]  vanguard of the New World Order for thousands of years is potbellied men
[02:50:09.620 --> 02:50:15.220]  coming for your children and that's the TSA I mean this is a planet pedophile
[02:50:15.220 --> 02:50:20.340]  ruled by pedophiles with nuclear weapons yes and as I say it takes strips
[02:50:20.340 --> 02:50:23.700]  all they've already stripped almost all the rights of the parents away if it's
[02:50:23.700 --> 02:50:28.420]  apparent at all and and then of course they're given the rights to the child
[02:50:28.420 --> 02:50:32.540]  with the intention that the child can then make make their own decision if
[02:50:32.540 --> 02:50:35.540]  they're going to have sex with its old geezer and that's really what it is and
[02:50:35.540 --> 02:50:38.820]  that's actually used that already that that well that's why they're saying
[02:50:38.820 --> 02:50:42.860]  they're gonna inoculate kids and have abortions if the 10-year-old says they
[02:50:42.860 --> 02:50:48.260]  want it again and they say it's their consent I mean and they say they're
[02:50:48.260 --> 02:50:51.700]  gonna start killing children up to age three we haven't talked about that Alan

[02:54:30.420 --> 02:54:35.300]  article up yet an info wars dot com about secret TSA agents on the streets of

[02:54:40.420 --> 02:54:44.260]  the funding but now Congress has admitted it I'm gonna know that's up yet
[02:54:44.260 --> 02:54:51.260]  because I know Watson I know Watson is on the job so look for that here is Ted
[02:54:51.260 --> 02:54:55.300]  Nugent I'm gonna try to bleep out where he says they're wiping the Constitution
[02:54:55.300 --> 02:55:00.220]  you know on there you know what but everything he says is true he says the
[02:55:00.220 --> 02:55:05.100]  administration or criminals I admire his courage it's in the Wall Street Journal
[02:55:05.100 --> 02:55:09.220]  it's up on the drudge report also an info wars dot com you want to watch it
[02:55:09.220 --> 02:55:13.500]  if you're a radio listener but then he says Mitt Romney is gonna save us Mitt
[02:55:13.500 --> 02:55:19.100]  Romney was bought and paid for by the same banks carbon taxes gun control open
[02:55:19.100 --> 02:55:23.340]  borders it wrote health care I hear callers going I want Obama out because
[02:55:23.340 --> 02:55:28.580]  of health care I would love to believe Mitt Romney was gonna fix things and I
[02:55:28.580 --> 02:55:34.820]  guess you know he might be better than Obama but the same elite is behind him
[02:55:34.820 --> 02:55:39.580]  it's who backs them and the fruit of him being governor and everything all
[02:55:39.580 --> 02:55:45.420]  these horrible droppings he leaves let's let's let's go to Ted Nugent here it
[02:55:45.420 --> 02:55:58.060]  is and if you can't get a couple a hundred people each each of you some of
[02:55:58.060 --> 02:56:01.620]  you I bet you can get a couple thousand your goal should be to get a couple of
[02:56:01.620 --> 02:56:09.460]  thousand people per person who's here to vote for Mitt Romney in November if you
[02:56:09.460 --> 02:56:15.620]  don't know that our government is wiping its with the Constitution you're
[02:56:15.620 --> 02:56:19.500]  living under a rock someplace and that there's a dead soldier an airman a
[02:56:19.500 --> 02:56:26.740]  marine a seaman a hero of the military that just got his legs blown off for the
[02:56:26.740 --> 02:56:30.980]  US Constitution and we got a president and Attorney General who doesn't even
[02:56:30.980 --> 02:56:37.580]  like the Constitution we got four Supreme Court justices who don't believe in the
[02:56:37.580 --> 02:56:41.380]  Constitution everybody know here that four of the Supreme Court justices
[02:56:41.380 --> 02:56:46.340]  not only determined you don't have the right to keep and bear arms for Supreme
[02:56:46.340 --> 02:56:52.740]  Court justices sign their name to a declaration that Americans have no
[02:56:52.740 --> 02:56:59.380]  fundamental right to self-defense that sounds like a stoned hippie that doesn't
[02:56:59.380 --> 02:57:04.540]  sound like a Supreme Court anything it sounds like a supremely intellectually
[02:57:04.540 --> 02:57:11.500]  vacuous punk to think that a human could think that humans don't have a basic
[02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:18.020]  right to self-defense is so bizarre to me as to my brain can't accept the
[02:57:18.020 --> 02:57:24.180]  information and if you want more of those kinds of evil anti-american people in
[02:57:24.180 --> 02:57:28.380]  the Supreme Court then don't get involved and let Obama take office again
[02:57:28.380 --> 02:57:32.100]  because I tell you this right now if Barack Obama becomes the president in
[02:57:32.100 --> 02:57:38.860]  November again I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year being at
[02:57:38.860 --> 02:57:44.860]  the NRA event God bless you good indicator but if you can't go home and
[02:57:44.860 --> 02:57:52.340]  get everybody in your lives to clean house in this vile evil America hating
[02:57:52.340 --> 02:57:58.500]  administration I don't even know what you're made out of if you can't galvanize
[02:57:58.500 --> 02:58:04.500]  and promote and recruit people to vote for Mitt Romney we're done will be a
[02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:10.660]  suburb of indonesia next year our president and attorney general our
[02:58:10.660 --> 02:58:17.500]  vice president Hillary Clinton they're criminals they're criminals and if you
[02:58:17.500 --> 02:58:21.900]  take that adamant weed yeah but so is George Bush in those wars they're not
[02:58:21.900 --> 02:58:25.900]  getting their legs blown off for freedom they're getting blown off for opium and
[02:58:25.900 --> 02:58:31.020]  world government and that's my point how can you recognize tyranny under Obama
[02:58:31.020 --> 02:58:37.380]  but not under Bush that's the point that's the problem
[02:58:37.380 --> 02:58:56.740]  thank you can add to GCA come on come all the way
