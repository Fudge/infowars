[00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.751]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:11.352]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:12.893]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.893 --> 00:00:17.075]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:21.177]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:40.618]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:41.319]  Welcome.
[00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:43.822]  It is Tuesday.
[00:00:43.822 --> 00:00:45.644]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:49.029]  The 17th day of April, 2011.
[00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:56.057]  And this is the day that the government has made.
[00:00:56.057 --> 00:00:57.579]  Government is what makes the sun.
[00:00:59.497 --> 00:01:01.419]  Sit in the sky and the earth orbit it.
[00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:16.210]  Government is what runs our lives and of course that that controls the government is the loving private megabanks openly establishing world government in everyone's face.
[00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.933]  So we are going to be discussing all of this today.
[00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:28.280]  Normally you pay on April 15th, but because of a federal holiday yesterday,
[00:01:33.547 --> 00:01:37.249]  You do not pay on the 15th, you pay on the 17th.
[00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:40.391]  Because the 15th fell on a Sunday, that was a federal holiday.
[00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:47.215]  On the 16th, the build-up to the Holy Day, when you pay the private Federal Reserve your tax money.
[00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:48.897]  And then, of course, today is the day.
[00:01:48.897 --> 00:01:53.319]  Of course, most of you just have your money taken out of your paycheck.
[00:01:53.319 --> 00:02:00.244]  And, of course, taken via Social Security that you'll never really collect on, or if you do, it'll be in devalued dollars.
[00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:25.009]  And it was really hitting me this morning that we pay the income tax that's in the Communist Manifesto and in the ten planks of the Communist Manifesto that was written by the big European banks on record through their agents Marx and Engels as a way to pay for the interest on the right to even have a currency.
[00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:29.330]  And they got to us a little bit later by 1913, took them a few decades to slowly
[00:02:30.507 --> 00:02:32.268]  Implement it because they knew they had us.
[00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:34.389]  They wanted to take their time.
[00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:40.051]  And since then, we've become the greatest debtor nation from the greatest creditor nation.
[00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:43.373]  And in every other statistic, we are the laughingstock.
[00:02:43.373 --> 00:02:45.494]  We are the Imperium.
[00:02:45.494 --> 00:02:48.755]  We are the heart of the New World Order muscle.
[00:02:48.755 --> 00:02:55.138]  We are the modern Hessian mercenaries for the New World Order.
[00:02:55.138 --> 00:02:57.919]  Now, we are going to open the phones up.
[00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:59.180]  I'm going to give the number out.
[00:03:00.657 --> 00:03:01.960]  When we come back from break.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.322]  So, start your engines.
[00:03:03.322 --> 00:03:05.527]  We're not giving you the green light yet.
[00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:06.388]  I want to hear from you.
[00:03:06.388 --> 00:03:09.835]  We're going to take a bunch of calls ahead of Alan Watt joining us.
[00:03:11.087 --> 00:03:15.932]  That means I'll probably get to calls in the last segment of this hour, or maybe not even this hour.
[00:03:15.932 --> 00:03:16.773]  No, seriously.
[00:03:16.773 --> 00:03:18.435]  I'm going to try to go to your calls in the next segment.
[00:03:18.435 --> 00:03:24.661]  In fact, in the spirit of that, let me just give the number out right now for first-time callers.
[00:03:24.661 --> 00:03:26.743]  The first few rounds will be first-time callers.
[00:03:26.743 --> 00:03:26.783]  800-259-9231.
[00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:48.097]  And we don't screen your calls and talk about any issue you want, but if it's just a bunch of plugs, or you got a tractor you're selling, or you want to ask me if I'm a reptoid from Planet Pop-Tart, then, well, we're just not going to be able to talk very long.
[00:03:48.097 --> 00:03:52.139]  I want to hear questions, comments, or points you've got to make, and move on to the next person.
[00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:58.141]  Because it's like that holy grail I've never actually attained, but a few times I've actually taken a bunch of phone calls.
[00:03:58.141 --> 00:04:02.485]  We can take thousands of phone calls here, and I think it's some of the best radio I do when I actually take phone calls.
[00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:03.146]  So we're going to do it.
[00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:07.631]  800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us, and we will get you up and on the air.
[00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:14.555]  I don't know.
[00:04:37.657 --> 00:04:50.411]  DrudgeReport.com has since moved off the page, but the top story at Drudge is record numbers of Americans giving up their citizenship to get away from the private Federal Reserve tax man that's raping them.
[00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:53.794]  Of course, the globalist answer is, hey Jack, you ain't leaving.
[00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:55.096]  We're taking everything you got.
[00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:59.320]  The illegals can come in, but the slave Americans cannot get out.
[00:05:00.197 --> 00:05:07.420]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:25.306]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:05:25.306 --> 00:05:29.408]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:05:29.688 --> 00:05:31.469]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:39.635]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:05:39.635 --> 00:05:45.939]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:47.220]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.080]  It's incredible.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:57.307]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:05:57.307 --> 00:05:59.148]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:06:00.008 --> 00:06:01.310]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.915]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:06:06.915 --> 00:06:11.920]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.506]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:06:17.506 --> 00:06:22.191]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:06:22.711 --> 00:06:29.836]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:06:29.836 --> 00:06:30.957]  And here's the best part.
[00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:37.641]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:40.823]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:40.823 --> 00:06:43.986]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:06:48.989 --> 00:06:51.852]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:06:51.852 --> 00:06:56.675]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:06:56.675 --> 00:07:00.619]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:15.070]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:07:16.075 --> 00:07:20.777]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:20.777 --> 00:07:33.544]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:07:33.544 --> 00:07:40.808]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:07:41.488 --> 00:07:51.856]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:07:51.856 --> 00:07:55.778]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:07:55.778 --> 00:08:01.282]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:08:01.282 --> 00:08:06.866]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:31.172 --> 00:08:36.135]  Welcome to the number one radio transmission in the world.
[00:08:36.135 --> 00:08:49.023]  Number one when it comes to defending liberty and exposing the global corporate crime syndicate that is the New World Order.
[00:08:49.023 --> 00:08:53.886]  You want to know why standardized worldwide?
[00:08:53.886 --> 00:09:00.470]  You see police state grids being put in and the exact same programs, the exact same names under continuity of agenda.
[00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:05.255]  It is a global corporate world government that we face.
[00:09:05.255 --> 00:09:07.696]  It is the New World Order.
[00:09:07.696 --> 00:09:16.238]  It is the main fount, or the organizer, of all the major problems on Earth.
[00:09:16.238 --> 00:09:24.381]  Humans, we have our own problems, we have our own issues, we repeat throughout history, generation after generation, we only live for a short period.
[00:09:24.381 --> 00:09:30.883]  The elites understand that if people aren't given the knowledge of how humanity operates, and are kept in the dark,
[00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:50.310]  The average person will never become wise and in your limited lifespan understand the tricks that corrupt syndicates have developed in every civilization in more than 6,000 years of human settlements.
[00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.174]  Civilization.
[00:09:54.174 --> 00:09:57.257]  The globalists know all the tricks and are masters at it.
[00:09:58.632 --> 00:10:01.035]  And that simply put is what the Illuminati is.
[00:10:01.035 --> 00:10:02.456]  They are illuminated.
[00:10:02.456 --> 00:10:03.818]  They have the light.
[00:10:03.818 --> 00:10:05.519]  They know the tricks.
[00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:07.522]  They know the secrets of humanity.
[00:10:07.522 --> 00:10:11.306]  They know the basic psychology before that word was invented.
[00:10:11.306 --> 00:10:20.376]  They wrote the handbooks on control and deception and they pass it down through the different genetic crime families that are intermarried.
[00:10:22.699 --> 00:10:26.521]  And they control this planet to a great extent.
[00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:40.249]  They are trying to get full control, and if they get full control, they are going to kill, depending on which document you read, they debate it, 80 to 90, all the way up to 99.9 plus percent.
[00:10:47.912 --> 00:10:50.333]  And I've quoted these documents ad nauseum.
[00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:51.934]  We've posted articles.
[00:10:51.934 --> 00:10:59.677]  There's new articles at InfoWars.com today documenting this.
[00:10:59.677 --> 00:11:06.961]  Now, humanity is in grave peril.
[00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:13.824]  When you look at the innocence of children, when you look at the decency and the beauty and the goodness and the wholesomeness in the world,
[00:11:16.448 --> 00:11:19.430]  You have to understand there is more good in the world than evil.
[00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:24.132]  But good never seeks power.
[00:11:24.132 --> 00:11:31.976]  Until things get so desperate, good is forced to fight back.
[00:11:31.976 --> 00:11:36.098]  And generally, it's against overwhelming odds because you've waited too long.
[00:11:36.098 --> 00:11:39.300]  But still, good triumphs when it takes action.
[00:11:40.256 --> 00:11:54.364]  The first that stand up may be destroyed, and maybe the second and third and fourth wave, but those that persevere with truth and justice and goodness stacked against evil will always prevail in the end.
[00:11:54.364 --> 00:12:00.688]  Now, I want to take your phone calls today.
[00:12:00.688 --> 00:12:05.471]  I want to get the calls first and early here, and in coming up,
[00:12:06.744 --> 00:12:17.651]  We wrote a story yesterday, Paul Watson and I, IRS travel ban revoking citizenship by stealth.
[00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:34.942]  And I noticed that it went up on the Drudge Report as the top story, and then I noticed about an hour later, as I'm always swimming around over at the Drudge Report checking for the latest news, orbiting it,
[00:12:36.923 --> 00:13:02.188]  And I noticed another article popped up from CBC, Canadian TV and media, documenting that record numbers of Americans are giving up their citizenship to get out from under the taxes in the United States that are unbelievably unfair and draconian, and most importantly, paid to the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[00:13:03.448 --> 00:13:07.731]  Literally, Reagan's administration did a congressional study.
[00:13:07.731 --> 00:13:10.372]  You can look it up.
[00:13:10.372 --> 00:13:19.057]  It reported over 98% of it went to interest on the debt and to pay for interest for the dollar to be created, paid to the private Federal Reserve.
[00:13:19.057 --> 00:13:23.199]  A few percentage points went to administrative issues.
[00:13:23.199 --> 00:13:25.481]  And then separately, Social Security goes in another fund.
[00:13:25.481 --> 00:13:26.761]  They raided from day one.
[00:13:26.761 --> 00:13:27.082]  It's about
[00:13:28.228 --> 00:13:40.981]  Tying you into their system, getting you into the Ponzi scheme so you'll stay in, even if the payment's reduced, you'll stay into the system, seeing it as too big to fail, so you'll stay in the fraud.
[00:13:40.981 --> 00:13:50.872]  Our government, our country, our system was built on federal taxes that ranged between, depending on the era, 5 and 10 percent.
[00:13:52.836 --> 00:13:55.780]  I hear this lie about when the income tax first went in.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:00.285]  I hear it ad nauseum on TV and radio put out by the Democrats.
[00:14:00.285 --> 00:14:04.169]  Oh, the first tax rates were 90% for the rich.
[00:14:04.169 --> 00:14:11.859]  Yes, there was a corporate tax that they sold to get the income tax finagled, though it wasn't ratified by the states.
[00:14:11.859 --> 00:14:12.639]  It's a fraud as well.
[00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:24.055]  Where there were corporate taxes of 90%, but no one had to pay it because there were accounting tricks where you just paid it out to other subsidiaries and yourself.
[00:14:24.055 --> 00:14:27.296]  So, another fraud.
[00:14:27.296 --> 00:14:30.977]  But I don't want to get caught up in the minutia here.
[00:14:30.977 --> 00:14:35.679]  This is tax day, when you're paying the private Federal Reserve.
[00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:41.641]  And make no mistake, you pay the lion's share of your taxes
[00:14:42.705 --> 00:15:02.959]  That they take out of your paycheck, that you pay at the end of the year, or you pay quarterly, depending on how you pay, you pay it directly to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup.
[00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:12.186]  Now, continuing with this information, when you pull back and look at it,
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:25.926]  We have a private Federal Reserve in this country and they're not just getting your income tax money that's paid directly to them for interest on the debt that they set up to put the government in fraudulently.
[00:15:25.926 --> 00:15:36.332]  Now they've signed us on to their derivatives fraud and had government sign on to it and spin it that it's our debt and we're lazy and we're not working enough jobs that uniquely American
[00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:45.324]  Thing that Bush talked about working three jobs and having your children raised by the state and government training centers eating GMO poison and dying of cancer.
[00:15:45.324 --> 00:15:47.226]  If they're not neurologically damaged.
[00:15:47.226 --> 00:15:49.167]  Or both.
[00:15:49.167 --> 00:15:51.369]  In death camp America.
[00:15:51.369 --> 00:15:55.792]  Slow death, soft kill, eugenics, America.
[00:15:55.792 --> 00:15:59.975]  Rothschild, Rockefeller, Bill Gates, death camp.
[00:15:59.975 --> 00:16:02.917]  Slow kill, death camp.
[00:16:02.917 --> 00:16:03.778]  So understand,
[00:16:05.208 --> 00:16:23.195]  What will bring down the Federal Reserve is exposing it's not federal, it's run for profit, and it's waging war on the free market, and is selectively enforcing the tax laws that they wrote, the Federal Reserve lobbyists wrote, to shut down all their competition.
[00:16:23.195 --> 00:16:24.236]  They are monopoly men.
[00:16:24.236 --> 00:16:26.056]  They are the enemy of this country.
[00:16:26.056 --> 00:16:28.517]  They are the occupational government.
[00:16:28.517 --> 00:16:29.618]  They are our conquerors.
[00:16:30.652 --> 00:16:32.373]  They are the fraudsters.
[00:16:32.373 --> 00:16:34.814]  They are the people that killed the Republic.
[00:16:34.814 --> 00:16:40.977]  They are the people, openly, they have thousands of Federal Reserve operatives involved at every level of local government, you name it.
[00:16:40.977 --> 00:16:47.160]  Lobbying and selling, raising taxes to pay off our debt and get America back on its feet.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:53.423]  They mean, give all the money to them, cut the benefits, bankrupt the economy further, so they can buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.213]  They are the authors of our destruction.
[00:16:59.213 --> 00:17:01.054]  They are the authors of our misery.
[00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:02.476]  They are the enemies.
[00:17:02.476 --> 00:17:04.037]  They are the hijackers.
[00:17:04.037 --> 00:17:05.379]  They are the criminals.
[00:17:05.379 --> 00:17:06.860]  They are the destroyers.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.121]  They are the fraud.
[00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:10.063]  They are the criminal crime syndicate.
[00:17:10.063 --> 00:17:11.364]  They are the combine.
[00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:14.267]  They are the enemy of every man, woman, and child.
[00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:16.049]  They are the shadow government.
[00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:19.632]  They are the usurpers, the scammers, the fraudsters.
[00:17:20.313 --> 00:17:28.540]  The Ponzi scheme operators that make Madoff and Ken Lay and John Corzine look like choir boys.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.842]  They are the open enemy.
[00:17:31.004 --> 00:17:40.027]  They are the people writing the policy to break up the families, and militarize the police, and have cities go bankrupt, and then squeeze the public for more money.
[00:17:40.027 --> 00:17:41.988]  They want a post-industrial world.
[00:17:41.988 --> 00:17:43.348]  They want you bankrupt.
[00:17:43.348 --> 00:17:44.789]  They want you impoverished.
[00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:46.529]  They openly say they want that.
[00:17:46.529 --> 00:17:51.991]  They are complete enemies of savers, and investors, and small factory owners.
[00:17:51.991 --> 00:17:55.592]  They are the enemy of every man, woman, and child in this country.
[00:17:55.592 --> 00:17:59.734]  They are the foreign, European banks that got the lion's share of the bailout money.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:10.969]  Then you got Americans like Warren Buffett and subsidiary companies he's got with Bill and Melinda Gates, who got over a trillion dollars into their companies of the bailout money.
[00:18:10.969 --> 00:18:17.033]  Warren Buffett himself in the first round, three billion dollars.
[00:18:17.033 --> 00:18:20.016]  First two-plus bill, then a few hundred mil more.
[00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:21.457]  Then billions more.
[00:18:21.457 --> 00:18:22.898]  It's so incredible.
[00:18:22.898 --> 00:18:24.279]  And here is this demonic
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:33.546]  Pig, sitting up there, acting non-threatening like Mr. Magoo when he is a crime lord, going, gee, I want to pay more taxes.
[00:18:33.546 --> 00:18:34.787]  Just raise taxes.
[00:18:34.787 --> 00:18:39.530]  Because he knows he's exempt from them, and even the Washington Post admits that, and he's the biggest beneficiary.
[00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:44.422]  Now that said, I'm going to come back and go to your phone calls, but then later I'm getting into this.
[00:18:44.422 --> 00:18:55.190]  Because some people, I got emails, I saw text, I saw comments on YouTube, I saw comments on our article, IRS travel ban revoking citizenship by stealth.
[00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.832]  And people are like, how does that revoke citizenship?
[00:18:58.832 --> 00:19:08.740]  You cannot, under federal court rulings, the Constitution, and no other government does this but Russia by the way, take someone's passport extra-judicially without a conviction.
[00:19:09.727 --> 00:19:15.830]  You cannot take someone's citizenship and the passport is the right of a citizen to travel in and out of the country.
[00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.671]  We are the country.
[00:19:17.671 --> 00:19:29.477]  This is an ancient right going back to Greece, going back to Rome, going back to city-states, that you have passage into the city, into the country.
[00:19:29.477 --> 00:19:36.060]  You pay taxes because you're paying for the defense for the walls of your city, or of your country.
[00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:40.820]  You have rights that the slaves don't.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.781]  Oh, in all those cultures, they had slaves.
[00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:48.022]  Slaves do not have right of passage.
[00:19:48.022 --> 00:19:54.264]  The passport is the proof that you're a free man in the slave system.
[00:19:54.264 --> 00:19:55.704]  Part of the empire.
[00:19:55.704 --> 00:19:58.065]  The bankers are saying, you're not part of America anymore.
[00:19:58.065 --> 00:20:00.546]  You are our slaves, our chattel.
[00:20:00.546 --> 00:20:07.428]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good sized meal, I was still starving.
[00:20:07.688 --> 00:20:25.421]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:20:25.421 --> 00:20:31.525]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Youngevity.
[00:20:31.525 --> 00:20:35.128]  The Youngevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you
[00:20:35.308 --> 00:20:35.828]  I think so.
[00:20:59.995 --> 00:21:04.038]  HempUSA.org brings you pure camembert powder.

[00:21:29.318 --> 00:21:30.559]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:35.102]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:35.102 --> 00:21:40.926]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[00:24:04.989 --> 00:24:09.291]  By the way, one more point and I'm going to your calls before I get into this top story.
[00:24:09.291 --> 00:24:16.915]  IRS travel ban revoking citizenship by stealth and how it ties into Paul Watson's latest article at Infowars.com.
[00:24:16.915 --> 00:24:22.097]  IRS to revoke passports of 30,000 US troops.
[00:24:22.097 --> 00:24:22.978]  You heard that right.
[00:24:22.978 --> 00:24:28.900]  But of course, they might be given selective waivers.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:34.103]  The TSA is now announcing they'll decide who gets to get waived from the crotch group.
[00:24:36.701 --> 00:24:50.534]  The point here is that I've seen a lot of people comment that, well, already states request that the federal government not issue you a passport or cancel it if you owe child support.
[00:24:50.534 --> 00:24:54.298]  You can't strip somebody of their absolute right.
[00:24:54.298 --> 00:24:56.440]  But of course, it started with the children.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.901]  Well, it's for the children.
[00:24:57.901 --> 00:24:59.723]  And now it's, well, it's for the Federal Reserve.
[00:25:00.871 --> 00:25:05.334]  And it's going to be, you can't have a job, you can't have a car, you can't travel.
[00:25:05.334 --> 00:25:11.378]  You say, well, you'll just drive illegally.
[00:25:11.378 --> 00:25:17.082]  Well, now they've got license plate readers and in real time know if you're even up on your insurance.
[00:25:17.082 --> 00:25:20.505]  The future is going to be a hellish system.
[00:25:20.505 --> 00:25:22.906]  The economy is meant to be predatory now.
[00:25:22.906 --> 00:25:28.130]  We are meant to go into a cannibalistic phase politically, economically, where we implode.
[00:25:29.318 --> 00:25:36.405]  You think 2 million in prisons 10 years ago, 4 years ago 4.5 million, now 7.1?
[00:25:36.405 --> 00:25:43.952]  They estimate by the next decade it'll be more than 15 million in prison.
[00:25:43.952 --> 00:25:45.894]  More prisoners than China?
[00:25:45.894 --> 00:25:47.496]  This is the economy.
[00:25:47.496 --> 00:25:52.601]  And then the people come out of the jails not afraid to commit crime, not afraid to rape and rob.
[00:25:55.353 --> 00:25:56.954]  They're colleges of crime.
[00:25:56.954 --> 00:26:04.576]  America is under a scientific attack.
[00:26:04.576 --> 00:26:05.857]  There's the New York Times.
[00:26:05.857 --> 00:26:06.117]  U.S.
[00:26:06.117 --> 00:26:09.238]  prison population dwarfs that of other nations.
[00:26:09.238 --> 00:26:15.920]  The United States has less than 5% of the world's population, but it has almost a quarter of the world's prisoners.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.061]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[00:26:18.061 --> 00:26:22.522]  David, Tony, Cameron, Christopher, Jeff, Wally.
[00:26:22.522 --> 00:26:24.563]  David in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:26:25.694 --> 00:26:28.035]  Hi Alex, I really love your show a lot.
[00:26:28.035 --> 00:26:39.838]  I was wondering if you'd seen the study a month or two ago that came out in the news that 20% of the population, 25% of women, are now on psychotropic drugs.
[00:26:39.838 --> 00:26:42.659]  I was astounded how high the number is now.
[00:26:42.659 --> 00:26:48.620]  Yes, and New Freedom Initiative, remember six years ago, that leaked out because one of the board members exposed it.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:54.422]  It was meetings with the White House, the regulators, and Big Pharma, and they said the goal was within
[00:26:55.464 --> 00:26:56.445]  I forget, was it 10 years?
[00:26:56.445 --> 00:26:58.026]  I don't remember the exact number.
[00:26:58.026 --> 00:27:03.731]  They wanted 50% of school kids, of children on psychotropics.
[00:27:03.731 --> 00:27:10.197]  And back then they had about 10%, and now I was reading it's over 20 for kids, over 20 for women.
[00:27:10.197 --> 00:27:11.799]  And this is the way they roll, yeah.
[00:27:13.058 --> 00:27:14.199]  Right.
[00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:20.464]  In my opinion, what I think is that there's a lot of fascinating subjects you discuss like the Fed and TSA and the upcoming police state.
[00:27:20.464 --> 00:27:33.595]  I think this is the number one issue and the reason why is because having everybody drugged out and apathetically in a zombie state, like walking in front of the cars as you said a few weeks ago, this allows them to roll in all the other programs.
[00:27:33.795 --> 00:27:38.496]  Sir, it is, we've done reports on it and shown the scientific reports, the universities.
[00:27:38.496 --> 00:27:47.158]  Since TV became ubiquitous across the board everywhere in the 50s, brainwaves have lowered.
[00:27:47.158 --> 00:27:57.640]  Brainwaves, IQs, and you can just pull up, every week now it's a study, computers rewiring children's brains, lowering IQs.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.640]  You can also, guys just type in,
[00:28:01.736 --> 00:28:02.177]  I think?
[00:28:22.899 --> 00:28:26.402]  Being programmed into a zombie state.
[00:28:26.402 --> 00:28:30.866]  And so people were either awakening to a higher level or they're being dumbed down.
[00:28:30.866 --> 00:28:35.631]  And yes sir, they, the average person you say, people like, it's like they're in a trance.
[00:28:35.631 --> 00:28:39.174]  It's not like, they are in a near dream state.
[00:28:39.174 --> 00:28:41.716]  And they have pre-programmed responses.
[00:28:41.716 --> 00:28:46.761]  It's like black helicopters just terrorized Chicago.
[00:28:46.761 --> 00:28:46.941]  But,
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:54.725]  Fifteen years ago, they would just say it didn't exist, you were insane, even if they covertly leased a building and blow it up.
[00:28:54.725 --> 00:28:58.868]  Local news, because I've been to these, would say, it does not exist, Alex Jones is bad.
[00:28:58.868 --> 00:29:00.930]  And I'd go, here's footage of it.
[00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:02.551]  They'd go, does not exist.
[00:29:02.551 --> 00:29:03.592]  See, they were already in a trance.
[00:29:03.592 --> 00:29:08.576]  And you're like, but it's, I have footage, I talked to the police chief, they tried to pay him off.
[00:29:08.576 --> 00:29:11.258]  The San Antonio News was like, does not exist.
[00:29:11.258 --> 00:29:13.920]  The Austin American-Statesman said, Jones is insane.
[00:29:15.188 --> 00:29:20.234]  It's like the New York Times just four years ago said, Mildenberg doesn't exist, Jones is hallucinating.
[00:29:20.234 --> 00:29:23.177]  You understand, this is total mind control.
[00:29:23.177 --> 00:29:27.402]  So your conscience, and it's like, well it doesn't make any sense because you're awake.
[00:29:27.402 --> 00:29:28.383]  But to a zombie!
[00:29:29.682 --> 00:29:34.005]  It's like a magician who hypnotizes somebody and they can't see the audience anymore.
[00:29:34.005 --> 00:29:35.326]  They are in a dream state.
[00:29:35.326 --> 00:29:35.626]  Stay there.
[00:29:35.626 --> 00:29:37.928]  I want to give you another comment, because I ran over you.
[00:29:37.928 --> 00:29:38.929]  More calls coming up.
[00:29:38.929 --> 00:29:41.030]  This is an important subject.
[00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:44.893]  Black helicopters hit Chicago, but they do not exist.
[00:29:44.893 --> 00:29:49.576]  Remember that.
[00:29:49.576 --> 00:29:50.977]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.977 --> 00:29:53.499]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.499 --> 00:29:56.181]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.194 --> 00:30:04.016]  Right now, the average family spends one-fourth of their income on food.

[00:30:57.338 --> 00:31:01.862]  I had tried everything.
[00:31:01.862 --> 00:31:04.225]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:31:04.225 --> 00:31:07.368]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:31:07.368 --> 00:31:12.192]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:31:12.192 --> 00:31:18.559]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:30.251]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.

[00:32:29.657 --> 00:32:34.239]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.

[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.321]  Others don't.

[00:32:52.766 --> 00:32:55.467]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:32:55.467 --> 00:32:57.828]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[00:32:57.828 --> 00:32:58.329]  Others don't.
[00:33:09.998 --> 00:33:23.609]  You know, like I said, and documented years ago, I have been inside the University of Texas psychology building and was shown around.
[00:33:23.609 --> 00:33:33.576]  It's got a lot of classified projects going on in it, and they've got cameras into classified projects hooked into computer systems.
[00:33:33.576 --> 00:33:35.497]  This is like a decade ago, or more now.
[00:33:35.497 --> 00:33:37.259]  This is about, no, this is just about a decade ago.
[00:33:38.496 --> 00:33:43.336]  Hook and all the different laboratories spread out around Austin in the Hill Country.
[00:33:44.637 --> 00:33:56.447]  And most of it is just monkeys chained down with their wires in their brains, with TV screens flickering different rates at them, testing how to lower their brainwaves and put them into a trance.
[00:33:56.447 --> 00:34:04.594]  And then they have students come in and hook them up to the EKG systems and all these electrodes on their heads and just practice.
[00:34:04.594 --> 00:34:08.978]  They'll have whole programs on just how to stimulate a woman sexually.
[00:34:08.978 --> 00:34:12.261]  I was shown one DARPA program with just flicker rates.
[00:34:12.941 --> 00:34:29.222]  So they send a flicker wave over through the television, and then they've got other programs that they found, well if you sexually stimulate, and then hit them with this other rate, and then show them something else, you can really imprint the knowledge on them, and by knowledge, the brainwashing.
[00:34:31.223 --> 00:34:33.665]  And my point is, that was just one example.
[00:34:33.665 --> 00:34:41.991]  And it's just all the universities, all the complexes dedicated to wrecking your mind and hurting you and murdering you and your family.
[00:34:41.991 --> 00:34:43.753]  I'll just lay it right out there for you.
[00:34:43.753 --> 00:34:45.474]  And again, we're all just comfortable.
[00:34:45.474 --> 00:34:58.745]  Ah, 10,000 percentage point pediatric cancer cases, multi-thousand point increases, breast cancer, neurological disorders, everything, death, destruction, pain, sickness, Cancer Barbie, it's fun, everybody gets it.
[00:34:58.745 --> 00:34:59.906]  It's like getting a cold now.
[00:35:00.706 --> 00:35:05.428]  And it's just all fun to be murdered, soft killed.
[00:35:05.428 --> 00:35:09.769]  And the professors, I mean, when I was there 10 years ago, I was given like a four hour tour.
[00:35:09.769 --> 00:35:12.530]  It was amazing, late at night.
[00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:13.951]  Oh, you're not supposed to see this.
[00:35:13.951 --> 00:35:14.591]  Oh, look at that.
[00:35:14.591 --> 00:35:15.551]  What do you think of that?
[00:35:15.551 --> 00:35:17.032]  Oh, you didn't see that.
[00:35:17.032 --> 00:35:17.852]  Come in here.
[00:35:17.852 --> 00:35:29.396]  DARPA, DARPA, DARPA, DARPA, DARPA, DARPA, DARPA, Department of Defense, Air Force, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, every sector would have on the door what was funding it.
[00:35:31.607 --> 00:35:34.810]  And everything was about mind control on one floor.
[00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:44.719]  Go to another area, it's all about cameras that scan your facial expressions to tell what products you're looking and that track your eyes.
[00:35:44.719 --> 00:35:47.862]  And the cameras are hidden when you go into the smart stores.
[00:35:47.862 --> 00:35:53.527]  Now, of course, that's been put in everywhere.
[00:35:53.527 --> 00:35:57.871]  It is just total, absolute, savage control.
[00:35:59.468 --> 00:36:04.762]  And that's why you talk to the average adult, there's no way to even reach them or get through to them.
[00:36:04.762 --> 00:36:06.246]  They're just not there.
[00:36:06.246 --> 00:36:07.028]  These are zombies.
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:12.124]  And they toot, men toot into their sports shows and they talk about the coach.
[00:36:12.124 --> 00:36:13.185]  I think he's underrated.
[00:36:13.185 --> 00:36:14.266]  I agree with you.
[00:36:14.266 --> 00:36:15.388]  What about this great player?
[00:36:15.388 --> 00:36:16.048]  Let's get a call.
[00:36:16.048 --> 00:36:18.090]  You hear the prideful player call in.
[00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:19.352]  Yeah, I'm doing good.
[00:36:19.352 --> 00:36:20.713]  The team's doing great.
[00:36:20.713 --> 00:36:22.335]  We're getting ready for this Sunday.
[00:36:22.335 --> 00:36:23.556]  All right, great.
[00:36:23.556 --> 00:36:25.558]  It's all this fake male stuff.
[00:36:25.558 --> 00:36:28.401]  And these are just people inserted into the Matrix.
[00:36:28.401 --> 00:36:30.363]  Programmed through their eyes, through their ears.
[00:36:31.304 --> 00:36:35.387]  Interfaced with the computers and they're gone and they ain't coming back.
[00:36:35.387 --> 00:36:41.051]  And the women are all prancing around enjoying themselves and, oh girlfriend you got cancer at 32.
[00:36:41.051 --> 00:36:42.392]  I'm so sorry for you.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:43.592]  We're all going to go to her funeral.
[00:36:43.592 --> 00:36:44.353]  It's so sad.
[00:36:44.353 --> 00:36:46.735]  You go to get your hair cut.
[00:36:47.495 --> 00:36:49.036]  And you hear the women all around you.
[00:36:49.036 --> 00:36:50.537]  Yeah, my friend Becky, she just died, 37.
[00:36:50.537 --> 00:36:51.677]  Oh, yeah?
[00:36:51.677 --> 00:36:54.159]  Well, my boyfriend's got cancer.
[00:36:54.159 --> 00:36:54.619]  Oh, really?
[00:36:54.619 --> 00:36:56.580]  Well, you know, my boyfriend just died last year of it.
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:57.100]  He was 24.
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:57.981]  Oh, yeah?
[00:36:57.981 --> 00:37:05.365]  And then you go to a restaurant, and there's mentally retarded children everywhere, and just autistic, just total savage death.
[00:37:05.365 --> 00:37:08.927]  Everybody's just, ah, la, la, la, la, murder me, murder me, murder me.
[00:37:08.927 --> 00:37:09.967]  You know, I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:37:09.967 --> 00:37:13.389]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:37:13.389 --> 00:37:14.550]  And I just sit here and watch it.
[00:37:16.218 --> 00:37:18.642]  And the general public is just victims.
[00:37:18.642 --> 00:37:20.225]  I can't even get mad at them anymore.
[00:37:20.225 --> 00:37:22.769]  They were hit by hardcore scientific evil.
[00:37:24.554 --> 00:37:41.298]  Troops are dying of DU poisoning, don't get medical treatment, but then there's all this sticky sweet stuff about loving the troops and getting money for their kids so they can go to college and all the country music stars raising money for the troops because they're the best people we got.
[00:37:41.298 --> 00:37:45.939]  Meanwhile, you only care about the troops though when you're told to on specific things.
[00:37:45.939 --> 00:37:50.399]  It's all half an inch deep, mile wide.
[00:37:50.399 --> 00:37:51.400]  All hat, no cattle.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.740]  Okay, I'm going to go back to the calls here.
[00:37:56.468 --> 00:38:02.231]  And people are like, hey, they've been taking passports for about 10 years if you owe child support.
[00:38:02.231 --> 00:38:03.091]  So it's all right.
[00:38:03.091 --> 00:38:08.614]  It's kind of like saying, we've had black slaves in the Americas for 250 years.
[00:38:08.614 --> 00:38:09.975]  You can't get rid of it now.
[00:38:09.975 --> 00:38:17.719]  I mean, the Aztecs were chopping people's hearts out every day for thousands of years under the Mayan culture before them.
[00:38:17.719 --> 00:38:19.039]  I mean, why not bring it back?
[00:38:19.039 --> 00:38:20.680]  They did it before.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.702]  I mean, Jeffrey Dahmer grabbed 13-year-olds off the street and tortured them to death.
[00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:25.403]  Why not just do it?
[00:38:26.707 --> 00:38:37.797]  I love this idea that, you know, we've had the IRS and the private Federal Reserve running things for 98 years, or 99 years, since 1913.
[00:38:37.797 --> 00:38:40.979]  I mean, what's wrong with it?
[00:38:40.979 --> 00:38:43.161]  It's all about acclimating you.
[00:38:43.161 --> 00:38:46.424]  There's no world government, there's no urban warfare black helicopters.
[00:38:46.424 --> 00:38:49.687]  I mean, I sat there with a statesman, Ryder, who'd been the former
[00:38:51.664 --> 00:38:55.625]  Employ a high level of the DPS and DPS intelligence.
[00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:58.666]  And I'm in the interview and he's going, so you believe there are these black helicopters?
[00:38:58.666 --> 00:39:03.207]  I went, well I have interviews with the police chiefs, they try to pay them off, Thomas Sanchez, urban warfare drills.
[00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:05.588]  And he went, mm-hmm, so you believe they exist?
[00:39:05.588 --> 00:39:06.988]  And I went, well they do exist.
[00:39:06.988 --> 00:39:09.689]  They're doing urban warfare drills to acclimate us.
[00:39:09.689 --> 00:39:12.870]  It's part of this presidential decision directive to get us ready for martial law.
[00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.710]  This is like 14 years ago.
[00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:17.271]  And then they just went with the statesman Jones believes they exist.
[00:39:18.822 --> 00:39:23.934]  And, you know, the guy was sitting there looking at me, just with cold mercenary behavior.
[00:39:23.934 --> 00:39:24.576]  He was an old guy.
[00:39:25.523 --> 00:39:27.064]  In fact, his name's out there on the paper.
[00:39:27.064 --> 00:39:28.845]  It's actually hanging on the wall.
[00:39:28.845 --> 00:39:30.686]  We've got it framed because it's so funny.
[00:39:30.686 --> 00:39:34.428]  You guys run me that black helicopter story and it's hanging on the wall right there.
[00:39:34.428 --> 00:39:36.890]  I'll show it to the TV viewers.
[00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:40.592]  Tim, here at our office, dug through a bunch of the old boxes and found all these news clippings and framed them.
[00:39:40.592 --> 00:39:42.233]  It's kind of cool to actually have stuff on the walls.
[00:39:42.233 --> 00:39:45.214]  I'm always too busy to even think about that.
[00:39:45.214 --> 00:39:50.017]  And it's the one about preaching the conspiracy gospel on the station near you.
[00:39:50.017 --> 00:39:51.078]  That's the headline on it, guys.
[00:39:51.078 --> 00:39:52.979]  It's right there.
[00:39:52.979 --> 00:39:53.139]  Now,
[00:39:56.682 --> 00:40:00.324]  And he just sat there looking at me.
[00:40:00.324 --> 00:40:03.125]  And he had that secure feeling.
[00:40:03.125 --> 00:40:05.806]  He works for the system.
[00:40:05.806 --> 00:40:10.308]  And the public is going to get to laugh at me.
[00:40:10.308 --> 00:40:12.589]  It's going to be funny.
[00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:17.631]  And they're all going to get to feel official and powerful and laugh at me.
[00:40:18.976 --> 00:40:22.138]  And when the Urban Warfare Drill hits them, they'll say it doesn't exist.
[00:40:22.138 --> 00:40:37.606]  So they ever do a coup d'etat over a governor or something as the PDD state, and as the John Warner Fence Authorization Act 2007 states, insurrection by state legislatures against the federal government, which is run by foreign banks, the captured, occupied federal government.
[00:40:37.606 --> 00:40:38.687]  Here it is, look.
[00:40:38.687 --> 00:40:39.507]  Here it is.
[00:40:39.507 --> 00:40:41.748]  We'll show folks the document, Cam, right here.
[00:40:41.748 --> 00:40:44.450]  Look at this.
[00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:48.112]  Alex Jones preaching the conspiracy gospel at a station near you.
[00:40:49.224 --> 00:40:50.665]  And that's only part of the article.
[00:40:50.665 --> 00:40:57.870]  They had a separate article right next to it.
[00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:59.051]  And of course, it was Mike Kelly.
[00:40:59.051 --> 00:41:03.214]  I mean, it wasn't that bad of an article.
[00:41:03.214 --> 00:41:09.538]  But still, it's a conspiracy theory to report on things that are real and admitted.
[00:41:09.538 --> 00:41:13.001]  Oh, wait a minute.
[00:41:13.001 --> 00:41:14.262]  I happen to have the
[00:41:17.614 --> 00:41:20.136]  Fox News here.
[00:41:20.136 --> 00:41:22.679]  What's this?
[00:41:22.679 --> 00:41:32.287]  Blackhawk circle low through Chicago skies as Secret Service releases security details.
[00:41:32.287 --> 00:41:44.057]  And it talks about the AM86 Little Bird helicopters used by Special Forces circling through downtown Chicago skies made for a scary scene along the Chicago River rattled
[00:41:45.003 --> 00:41:47.844]  Windows flying among the city skyscrapers.
[00:41:47.844 --> 00:41:48.964]  A training exercise.
[00:41:48.964 --> 00:41:55.746]  And you've got explosions and things going off, but it's still a conspiracy, children.
[00:41:55.746 --> 00:41:56.847]  Alright.
[00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:59.968]  Go ahead, caller, finish up your point, sir.
[00:41:59.968 --> 00:42:01.488]  Okay, one last point I wanted to make.
[00:42:01.488 --> 00:42:07.690]  For those people who've got any doubts about a lot of things we talk about here, there's a key term we got we, they should look up.
[00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:09.530]  Tardive dyskinesia.
[00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:11.091]  It's a neurological disease.
[00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:14.712]  This is just incredible when you look up what this word means.
[00:42:14.712 --> 00:42:19.035]  It's your tongue going in and out of your mouth uncontrollably.
[00:42:19.035 --> 00:42:22.637]  It's permanent, irreversible, and guess where it comes from?
[00:42:22.637 --> 00:42:25.900]  Anti-psychotic medication.
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:35.266]  According to Yale, you get one, it's not just a rare side effect, it's 100% of the people if they're on this drug long enough are going to get tardive dyskinesia.
[00:42:35.266 --> 00:42:36.226]  It's a key term.
[00:42:36.226 --> 00:42:41.510]  People, this word will wake people up when you look it up and see what the word is.
[00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:47.313]  Well, all I know is neurological disorders are all off the charts.
[00:42:47.313 --> 00:42:55.397]  They're killing us seven ways to Sunday and it's funny to them that we're going into a THX 1138 situation.
[00:42:55.397 --> 00:42:58.319]  They force on children.
[00:42:58.319 --> 00:43:06.863]  Right at 69% nationwide average of foster children are on seven or more psychotropic drugs.
[00:43:06.863 --> 00:43:07.644]  Seven on average.
[00:43:08.729 --> 00:43:11.010]  There's been news reports documenting that.
[00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:24.493]  And there have been doctors that have spoken out, who even work in the CPS, and they say, we get healthy kids, we put them on drugs, they start having problems, we put them on more, then they start having seizures from the drugs, so we put them on even more, and some of them were killing.
[00:43:24.493 --> 00:43:28.595]  I remember that was in a WOAI TV investigation, where a whistleblower went public.
[00:43:28.595 --> 00:43:37.357]  And then they had a state hearing about it, it's in my film Endgame, and the state head psychiatrist said, well they have bad gene pools, it's eugenics, so we just do this to them.
[00:43:41.112 --> 00:43:42.073]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:43:42.073 --> 00:43:42.814]  Thank you.
[00:43:42.814 --> 00:43:47.358]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Tony in Toronto, Canada.
[00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:47.918]  You're on the air.
[00:43:47.918 --> 00:43:50.160]  Hi, Alex.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.261]  How are you?
[00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:51.922]  I'm all right.
[00:43:51.922 --> 00:43:53.743]  I'm watching him kill everybody, but it's okay.
[00:43:53.743 --> 00:43:55.065]  Yeah.
[00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:56.105]  Never a dull moment.
[00:43:56.105 --> 00:43:57.467]  Alex, I'll try to make it quick.
[00:43:57.467 --> 00:43:58.968]  I've been listening for 10 years.
[00:43:58.968 --> 00:44:00.730]  First time caller.
[00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:06.195]  And after 10 years listening, you have to say pretty well every single thing.
[00:44:07.345 --> 00:44:08.626]  You've said it's come true.
[00:44:08.626 --> 00:44:13.488]  I stopped watching TV about nine years ago after I woke up, thanks to you.
[00:44:13.488 --> 00:44:16.049]  And I constantly promote your show.
[00:44:16.049 --> 00:44:21.311]  And when I tell listeners to tune in, potential listeners, I always tell them, give Alex a chance.
[00:44:21.311 --> 00:44:26.813]  I said he's very passionate, but I always laugh when I tell them that.
[00:44:26.813 --> 00:44:32.436]  I said many times Alex Jones has reported on things that sound outrageous.
[00:44:33.286 --> 00:44:39.172]  And I can remember many times over 10 years laughing, saying, that's impossible.
[00:44:39.172 --> 00:44:49.482]  And 99 out of 100 times, Alex, I've always laughed because everything you've reported on is absolutely conservative.
[00:44:49.482 --> 00:44:53.185]  The numbers you've quoted, it's many times worse.
[00:44:53.185 --> 00:44:57.950]  So I have to congratulate you that you're way ahead of the curve.
[00:44:58.746 --> 00:44:59.926]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[00:44:59.926 --> 00:45:04.068]  Good to hear you for the first time to hear your voice after 10 years.
[00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:11.991]  With me, there is a total desperation to get out of this, to beat them, to turn it back, because I love humanity.
[00:45:11.991 --> 00:45:16.753]  I love people just having good lives and going to the stars with my fellow humans.
[00:45:16.753 --> 00:45:25.857]  And instead, we've turned things over to the most wicked, twisted people who enjoy hurting people so they can sit back and dominate.
[00:45:25.857 --> 00:45:27.518]  These globalists can't
[00:45:28.138 --> 00:45:30.921]  Be in control if we have a strong humanity.
[00:45:30.921 --> 00:45:36.466]  So they are basically lobotomizing humanity so they can then feel superior.
[00:45:36.466 --> 00:45:38.728]  And every fiber of my humanity...
[00:45:39.682 --> 00:45:49.945]  And the species, race, memory, strength of our species tells me revolt, resist, adapt, overcome, defeat.
[00:45:49.945 --> 00:45:51.865]  And I'm just one person.
[00:45:51.865 --> 00:45:54.066]  We can do it together.
[00:45:54.066 --> 00:45:56.987]  And I wish that I wasn't right about this stuff.
[00:45:56.987 --> 00:45:58.727]  Again, look at the numbers.
[00:45:58.727 --> 00:46:00.528]  They're killing us.
[00:46:00.528 --> 00:46:01.948]  They're killing us.
[00:46:01.948 --> 00:46:02.849]  Everybody.
[00:46:02.849 --> 00:46:04.629]  There's only a few thousand globalists.
[00:46:04.629 --> 00:46:05.989]  They admit it themselves.
[00:46:05.989 --> 00:46:07.430]  Rothkopf wrote superclass.
[00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:11.751]  6,000 super gophers, less than 20 families.
[00:46:11.751 --> 00:46:14.571]  They are, and I appreciate your call, God bless you.
[00:46:14.571 --> 00:46:15.832]  Anything else?
[00:46:15.832 --> 00:46:19.052]  Yes, Alex, I have some breaking news for you and I'll try to make it quick.
[00:46:19.052 --> 00:46:19.872]  Go ahead.
[00:46:19.872 --> 00:46:22.993]  I'm going to choose my words carefully because I have to protect who they are.
[00:46:22.993 --> 00:46:28.734]  I have a very good friend whose spouse works for one of the largest banks in Canada.
[00:46:28.734 --> 00:46:33.975]  This person is responsible for branches outside of Canada and I'm not going to say where they are.
[00:46:35.135 --> 00:46:38.357]  This person just recently a week ago confirmed.
[00:46:38.357 --> 00:46:46.761]  They're working on a huge systems upgrade project Where basically at the push of a button they can shut down?
[00:46:46.761 --> 00:47:04.010]  ATM and access to people's bank accounts for up to 12 hours and when they come back online They'll be maximum withdrawal amounts put in and I was told this project is a huge priority and
[00:47:04.913 --> 00:47:23.685]  And also, the Bank of Canada, I was told, is backing or kind of pushing all the banks by offering them huge seven-figure bonuses if they meet the criteria to have all the systems in place by a certain date.
[00:47:23.685 --> 00:47:25.366]  I'm not sure what the date is.
[00:47:26.531 --> 00:47:38.616]  And I guess, Alex, I'm also going to surmise that if they're working on branches outside of Canada, these systems are either fully implemented or being implemented in Canada, and you've reported on similar
[00:47:39.449 --> 00:47:40.689]  Systems like this in the U.S.
[00:47:40.689 --> 00:47:44.330]  No, they're getting ready for currency and withdrawals and bank holidays.
[00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:54.373]  And I have the clip of the Vice President Biden saying that he and John Corzine discussed the bank holiday and whether they need one or not.
[00:47:54.373 --> 00:47:58.034]  This is a guy that'll bank holiday by taking the money out of your account and keeping it.
[00:47:58.034 --> 00:48:07.437]  And again, he gets away with it because this is a mafia of larcenous criminals with armies of scientists, DARPA, the CIA, everything on their side.
[00:48:08.457 --> 00:48:09.737]  And they just love it.
[00:48:09.737 --> 00:48:18.380]  I mean, it's just total criminals running around with their tongues hanging out with just super high-tech sci-fi technology on their side.
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:20.301]  But they're still humans too.
[00:48:20.301 --> 00:48:22.481]  And they're the scum of the earth.
[00:48:22.481 --> 00:48:25.742]  But I've actually heard a lot of rumblings about that.
[00:48:25.742 --> 00:48:30.924]  We've got embassy staff connections that have been giving us that same intel.
[00:48:30.924 --> 00:48:34.465]  And there's no doubt this has already happened in Europe during many crises.
[00:48:34.465 --> 00:48:35.425]  Thank you so much for the call.
[00:48:36.752 --> 00:48:39.093]  Let's go ahead and take another phone call.
[00:48:39.093 --> 00:48:42.133]  Jeff in Missouri, you're on the air.
[00:48:42.133 --> 00:48:42.654]  Hello!
[00:48:42.654 --> 00:48:43.394]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:48:43.394 --> 00:48:44.894]  Good, buddy.
[00:48:44.894 --> 00:48:57.978]  Hey, I'm here in Missouri, and I want everybody to get their W-2s in time you add up your federal, state, city, Medicare, Social Security tax.
[00:48:57.978 --> 00:48:58.858]  You're damn near paying 50%.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:08.786]  And then you got all the other property taxes, and fines, and fees, and regulations.
[00:49:08.786 --> 00:49:13.449]  America actually has one of the highest tax rates now in the industrialized world.
[00:49:13.449 --> 00:49:17.892]  And remember, the more you pay, the less industry, the less jobs, and the more in debt you are.
[00:49:17.892 --> 00:49:18.452]  Because it's all
[00:49:28.937 --> 00:49:30.237]  Exactly.
[00:49:30.237 --> 00:49:33.919]  Another thing I want to talk about real quick is I'm a letter carrier for the post office.
[00:49:54.218 --> 00:49:54.598]  Of course!
[00:50:07.222 --> 00:50:09.744]  Man, you think that online bill pay is going to be free?
[00:50:09.744 --> 00:50:10.365]  No way!
[00:50:10.365 --> 00:50:10.945]  No, no.
[00:50:10.945 --> 00:50:12.586]  Listen, the banks have said that.
[00:50:12.586 --> 00:50:16.309]  They're pressuring a lot of companies to make you get automatic transfer.
[00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:22.894]  But they admit, it's been public that very soon, well Bank of America already tried it, they're going to charge you when you do that.
[00:50:22.894 --> 00:50:27.718]  And they're coming out with global and national taxes on all digital transfers anyways.
[00:50:27.718 --> 00:50:28.599]  Exactly.
[00:50:28.599 --> 00:50:33.263]  Once we're cashless, they are going to make you pay giant fees.
[00:50:33.783 --> 00:50:36.504]  And they're gonna shut down the entire underground market.
[00:50:36.504 --> 00:50:38.725]  That's what Homeland Security's for.
[00:50:38.725 --> 00:50:40.685]  It's right out of Stalinist Russia.
[00:50:40.685 --> 00:50:42.506]  Anything else, sir?
[00:50:42.506 --> 00:50:46.407]  Alright, I'll give you another minute on the other side.
[00:50:46.407 --> 00:50:49.188]  And then we're gonna go to Cameron and others.
[00:50:49.188 --> 00:50:51.729]  And we've got, at the 8 after, Alan Watt joining us.
[00:50:52.805 --> 00:50:58.207]  Mud, it's just... What would total criminals do if they had Buck Rogers technology?
[00:50:58.207 --> 00:50:59.548]  That's the new world order.
[00:50:59.548 --> 00:51:00.548]  It's here.
[00:51:00.548 --> 00:51:03.089]  I've seen the longevity products work for many others.
[00:51:03.089 --> 00:51:08.912]  And so I bought a bunch of them, started using them, had a little bit of results, but I wasn't following the regimen every day.
[00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:13.433]  But Aaron Dykes in my office did, and lost more than 60 pounds.
[00:51:13.433 --> 00:51:17.155]  When I saw those results, I said, I better follow my own advice.
[00:51:17.155 --> 00:51:20.636]  I started taking the Longevity products, and it's been incredible.
[00:51:20.636 --> 00:51:23.257]  37 pounds in two months.
[00:51:23.257 --> 00:51:26.518]  Our bodies are amazing, and God gave us an incredible gift.
[00:51:26.738 --> 00:51:35.625]  But if our body doesn't have the tools it needs, all of the vitamins, all of the minerals, and the other key essential trace elements, we're not going to be healthy.
[00:51:35.625 --> 00:51:36.826]  Folks, this is Hidden Hype.
[00:51:36.826 --> 00:51:41.070]  I only bring to my listeners products that I've tried myself that I truly believe in.

[00:54:01.792 --> 00:54:07.619]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:07.619 --> 00:54:09.922]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:34.727 --> 00:54:38.349]  Okay, go ahead and finish up the points you were making, Jeff.
[00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:57.942]  Real quick, yeah, I was just trying to tell everybody to go ahead, use your emails, use online bill pay, watch them destroy us, because once they pass the internet censor bill, SOPA or its evil twin that's on right now, they can turn off your internet, and then there's nothing you can do.
[00:54:58.604 --> 00:55:01.105]  You won't be able to communicate with the outside world.
[00:55:01.105 --> 00:55:03.506]  And by the way, that's the plan.
[00:55:03.506 --> 00:55:05.526]  They have these big internet consortium meetings.
[00:55:05.526 --> 00:55:13.589]  They admit, destroy the old economy using the web, then shut down the open and free web, and only allow the big players to operate.
[00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:19.171]  It's just like the globalists do with water systems, dams, infrastructure, roads, we build.
[00:55:19.171 --> 00:55:24.032]  Then they come in, pay off the politicians to just hand it over to them, and they call it privatization.
[00:55:24.032 --> 00:55:25.413]  It's not, it's hijacking.
[00:55:25.413 --> 00:55:25.933]  Good points.
[00:55:26.872 --> 00:55:27.492]  Absolutely.
[00:55:27.492 --> 00:55:41.940]  You can say what you want about the post office, but there's a continual demonization of the infrastructure of it to basically phase it down to nothing and to make it super expensive so they can start charging more.
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.362]  Most people don't even know how to use a letter now.
[00:55:44.362 --> 00:55:47.043]  Also, it's very hard to spy on all the letters.
[00:55:47.043 --> 00:55:53.406]  But everything that goes over email, phones, is being scanned by the NSA computers, they now admit.
[00:55:53.406 --> 00:55:55.027]  Remember, that was a wild theory.
[00:55:55.027 --> 00:55:55.948]  That would be illegal.
[00:55:56.468 --> 00:56:01.793]  I remember first being on air 17 years ago, and I'd say, Echelon, NSA system, here's a congressional hearing.
[00:56:01.793 --> 00:56:11.823]  They've got hubs at all the major telecommunications companies, randomly reading your faxes, phone calls, emails, and people calling to go, how dare you say that?
[00:56:11.823 --> 00:56:12.804]  That's illegal!
[00:56:12.804 --> 00:56:13.665]  Never in America!
[00:56:13.665 --> 00:56:14.907]  I work at the phone company!
[00:56:15.467 --> 00:56:18.170]  That'd be like, your digital cable box is tracking you.
[00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:19.211]  Here's the documents.
[00:56:19.211 --> 00:56:20.032]  Shut up!
[00:56:20.032 --> 00:56:21.813]  I used to listen to you, but you're a liar.
[00:56:21.813 --> 00:56:25.017]  Now it's just like, well, he's still bad, but it's good.
[00:56:25.017 --> 00:56:26.718]  They listen to us to fight Al-Qaeda.
[00:56:26.718 --> 00:56:35.627]  And I'm like, but Al-Qaeda, our government's putting them in charge in all these countries and set them up, because it's not our government, it's the bankers.
[00:56:35.627 --> 00:56:38.990]  They fund the radical Muslims so they can attack us to take our liberties.
[00:56:39.943 --> 00:56:42.565]  And they just go, well fine, I'll give my liberties up then.
[00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:44.766]  But I'm like, but Al Qaeda works for them.
[00:56:44.766 --> 00:56:54.032]  I mean, there's even like Associated Press articles admitting the head of the 7-7 bombings in England, MI6.
[00:56:54.032 --> 00:57:01.377]  The head of the attack at Fort Hood and the Times Square and all these big bombings was admitted FBI asset and protected.
[00:57:01.377 --> 00:57:06.400]  I mean, the bankers run the terrorists.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.641]  It's so elementary.
[00:57:09.011 --> 00:57:11.354]  And they use them to take our freedoms.
[00:57:11.354 --> 00:57:13.256]  It isn't our government.
[00:57:13.256 --> 00:57:15.158]  It isn't our country.
[00:57:15.158 --> 00:57:16.900]  It's been taken.
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:26.551]  If you show up at your house and somebody else is sitting in your chair saying they're you, you better go and get your neighbors and prove that you are who you say you are and get the person out of your house.
[00:57:28.268 --> 00:57:31.669]  There's actually been cases before I've read about in the U.S.
[00:57:31.669 --> 00:57:41.291]  and other countries where people come home and there's a criminal there who's claiming they're them and the cops have come and you know the person can't prove who they say they are and they've arrested the wrong guy.
[00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:42.371]  That's what it is.
[00:57:42.371 --> 00:57:43.592]  It's not our government.
[00:57:43.592 --> 00:57:45.532]  But it sits there with all the trappings.
[00:57:45.532 --> 00:57:46.432]  We're about to go to break.
[00:57:46.432 --> 00:57:48.633]  Come back with a few more calls and go to our guest.
[00:57:48.633 --> 00:57:51.694]  But first I want to point out two new films we're carrying.
[00:57:51.694 --> 00:57:52.914]  Both of them are amazing.
[00:57:53.991 --> 00:58:00.643]  The Toronto hearings on 9-11 uncovering 10 years of deception by Dan Dix, amazing filmmaker.
[00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:01.945]  Six hours.
[00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:05.251]  You want to prove that 9-11 was an inside job?
[00:58:05.251 --> 00:58:06.954]  This is the latest intel.
[00:58:08.561 --> 00:58:12.424]  Continuing here with the information, here's the latest.
[00:58:12.424 --> 00:58:14.165]  We're going to get these guys on the show.
[00:58:14.165 --> 00:58:15.346]  Farmageddon.
[00:58:15.346 --> 00:58:23.831]  You want to know about the harassment and how they're attacking and taking over local farms under the pay of Big Pharma and Big Agra?
[00:58:23.831 --> 00:58:24.632]  Farmageddon.
[00:58:24.632 --> 00:58:27.053]  The unseen war on American family farms.
[00:58:27.053 --> 00:58:31.016]  Even the LA Times called it an eye-popping wake-up call.
[00:58:31.016 --> 00:58:32.417]  Even the LA Times.
[00:58:32.417 --> 00:58:33.978]  This is professional.
[00:58:33.978 --> 00:58:35.819]  You need to get it and support us.
[00:58:35.819 --> 00:58:37.440]  Infowars.com!
[00:58:42.909 --> 00:58:46.896]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.465 --> 00:58:53.186]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.186 --> 00:58:58.488]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:58:58.488 --> 00:59:00.028]  Saving means to make money.
[00:59:00.028 --> 00:59:08.792]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:59:09.532 --> 00:59:17.075]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:59:17.075 --> 00:59:25.078]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:59:25.078 --> 00:59:32.481]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:59:53.246 --> 00:59:55.626]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.626 --> 00:59:58.227]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:02.847 --> 01:00:07.690]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:09.271]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.271 --> 01:00:10.812]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:10.812 --> 01:00:15.014]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.014 --> 01:00:19.076]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.578 --> 01:00:24.538]  Yeah, but so did Bush, and I used to get
[01:00:44.887 --> 01:00:51.233]  The new gent on, I'll probably get him on again, and he'd be like, well, I hear you, but the Democrats are worse.
[01:00:51.233 --> 01:00:54.276]  Okay, well, it's like, do you want 500 milligrams of cyanide or 300?
[01:00:54.276 --> 01:01:03.284]  I mean, Benedict Arnold was worse because he posed as a patriot and wasn't.
[01:01:03.284 --> 01:01:08.809]  He was General Cornwallis or somebody, I mean, respectable guy.
[01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:09.930]  He knows what side he's on.
[01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:12.375]  It's worse!
[01:01:12.375 --> 01:01:14.536]  The Republicans are worse!
[01:01:14.536 --> 01:01:17.137]  I mean, Obama's horrible.
[01:01:17.137 --> 01:01:21.700]  Horrible snake, duplicitous scum, filth, teleprompter reader.
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:31.846]  My point is, if you think Mitt Romney's going to save you, if he tried to be like Ronald Reagan and actually do something, he'd end up getting a bullet in him.
[01:01:31.846 --> 01:01:32.806]  Just like Reagan did.
[01:01:32.806 --> 01:01:40.511]  And then a special trip to the Air Force Hospital, get some cold blood, brain damage, and then they'd have to hop him up on amphetamines and roll him out to the public.
[01:01:41.889 --> 01:01:46.332]  Oh yeah, Reagan was like anti-New World Order, giving speeches against the Trilateral Commission.
[01:01:46.332 --> 01:01:48.354]  He'd been a communist early on.
[01:01:48.354 --> 01:01:52.917]  He was reading the New American, you know, John Birch Society stuff.
[01:01:52.917 --> 01:01:55.219]  He was reading Lyndon LaRouche stuff.
[01:01:55.219 --> 01:01:58.061]  And they were like, dude, you're not the president.
[01:01:58.061 --> 01:02:00.763]  Hinkley's have dinner with the Bushes, you know what happens the next day.
[01:02:00.763 --> 01:02:03.064]  Boom!
[01:02:03.064 --> 01:02:07.027]  Cameron in Ohio, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:02:07.027 --> 01:02:07.427]  Hello.
[01:02:07.427 --> 01:02:08.088]  Hey buddy.
[01:02:09.446 --> 01:02:11.990]  We need to get angry, Alex.
[01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:16.736]  We need to be mad at our own government for turning its back on us.
[01:02:16.736 --> 01:02:18.018]  That's what we need to do.
[01:02:18.018 --> 01:02:20.521]  We need to unify and unite.
[01:02:20.521 --> 01:02:24.467]  And it's not that we have to be on Twitter or Facebook.
[01:02:24.727 --> 01:02:34.499]  We have to unite and show our power outside of the controlled matrix that they condemn us to, that they put us to, that they put it there for us.
[01:02:34.499 --> 01:02:39.045]  We have to show them our numbers and our strength and unite for liberty, Alex.
[01:02:39.045 --> 01:02:39.545]  Do you hear me?
[01:02:40.717 --> 01:02:44.342]  Yeah, we've all got to get aggressive, but everybody's always looking for a silver bullet.
[01:02:44.342 --> 01:02:49.168]  We've got to denounce the foreign banker occupation and that America was taken over.
[01:02:49.168 --> 01:02:52.413]  We've got to get that message, the truth.
[01:02:52.413 --> 01:02:53.594]  This isn't the government.
[01:02:53.594 --> 01:02:55.437]  This is illegitimate and criminal.
[01:02:55.697 --> 01:03:09.063]  And everything it's doing is illegal, and they're staging terror attacks, and they're bringing the drugs in, and they're shipping the guns into Mexico and Honduras and Chicago and Dallas and Albuquerque to the drug gangs.
[01:03:09.063 --> 01:03:11.504]  The mafia took over America.
[01:03:11.504 --> 01:03:14.385]  The mafia took over America, just like they did Italy.
[01:03:14.385 --> 01:03:17.867]  But it's a globalist mafia of all different races and creeds and groups.
[01:03:18.527 --> 01:03:21.569]  And it's in there, keeping people in the dark.
[01:03:21.569 --> 01:03:28.092]  And it's a mafia so powerful, they hired high-tech scientists to come up with brainwashing and brain-damaging systems.
[01:03:28.092 --> 01:03:34.155]  And now the mafia is like, why don't we just start killing people and transfer their money to us with the medical treatments?
[01:03:34.155 --> 01:03:36.075]  And they said, yes, we're going to do that.
[01:03:36.075 --> 01:03:43.119]  And so they're just phasing in and testing now how to kill us, that they are the most evil scum you can imagine.
[01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:47.651]  I know, and that's what makes my stomach turn, Alex.
[01:03:47.651 --> 01:03:55.213]  It makes me sick that right now all Americans are up in arms at our Capitol, screaming, why?
[01:03:55.213 --> 01:03:56.353]  Why are they doing this to us?
[01:03:56.353 --> 01:03:57.793]  Why aren't we?
[01:03:57.793 --> 01:03:58.774]  That's what we have to understand.
[01:03:58.774 --> 01:03:59.234]  Why aren't we?
[01:03:59.234 --> 01:04:07.696]  We have to have a goal, which is life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, which should be everyone's goal, but they're taking that right away from us.
[01:04:07.696 --> 01:04:08.976]  They can't take any right away.
[01:04:08.976 --> 01:04:11.137]  They can say they have the right to
[01:04:11.917 --> 01:04:17.880]  Take your two-year-old daughter and have her cry as a fat man sticks his hand down her pants and grabs her genitals.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:21.221]  But we expose it as pedophilia.
[01:04:21.221 --> 01:04:25.803]  We expose them as the pig monsters they are, the man-bear pigs they are.
[01:04:25.803 --> 01:04:30.825]  And we bankrupt the airlines and the system, not subjecting that.
[01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:33.726]  And when they come to your house to try it, you've got to defend yourself.
[01:04:33.726 --> 01:04:39.549]  These are the most demonic, perverted, filthy criminal scum, and we just keep calling them out.
[01:04:39.949 --> 01:04:42.453]  That's why they want to shut down the web and our freedom of speech.
[01:04:42.453 --> 01:04:52.687]  Because the truth is savaging these murdering, narcotics trafficking, child molesting, filthy, gangster, eugenicist scum that have seized our country.
[01:04:52.687 --> 01:04:55.832]  But we first got to call them out for the gang rapist they are.
[01:04:58.251 --> 01:05:02.054]  Right now, the average family spends one-fourth of their income on food.
[01:05:02.054 --> 01:05:07.978]  It's time to cut your food budget in half by using the best, most affordable food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.

[01:05:55.467 --> 01:06:02.630]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:06.952]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:06.952 --> 01:06:12.714]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:12.714 --> 01:06:13.455]  It's true.
[01:06:13.455 --> 01:06:17.997]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:18.317 --> 01:06:19.138]  Number 3.
[01:06:19.138 --> 01:06:22.721]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:22.721 --> 01:06:26.645]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:26.645 --> 01:06:27.445]  Number 4.
[01:06:27.445 --> 01:06:30.208]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:30.208 --> 01:06:33.551]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:33.871 --> 01:06:38.815]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:38.815 --> 01:06:43.859]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:43.859 --> 01:06:48.043]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:48.043 --> 01:06:49.824]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:49.824 --> 01:06:54.428]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:59.738 --> 01:07:03.700]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:12.563]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:07:12.563 --> 01:07:17.185]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:07:17.185 --> 01:07:28.010]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:38.159]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:38.159 --> 01:07:43.604]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:07:43.604 --> 01:07:51.090]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:53.853]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:08:03.035 --> 01:08:07.856]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:07.856 --> 01:08:09.456]  You want answers?
[01:08:09.456 --> 01:08:10.976]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:10.976 --> 01:08:15.177]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.177 --> 01:08:26.039]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.039 --> 01:08:28.459]  Everybody knows now.
[01:08:28.459 --> 01:08:30.940]  There are very few who are in denial.
[01:08:33.797 --> 01:08:39.801]  Everyone knows that the governments and major banks ship in the majority of narcotics and even grow and produce them.
[01:08:39.801 --> 01:08:45.564]  They own the aircraft, they ship the arms in, it's all come out in the news over and over again.
[01:08:45.564 --> 01:08:48.846]  The coca plants, the poppies, all of it.
[01:08:48.846 --> 01:08:59.753]  And they keep drugs illegal so that the price will be higher, so people will have to rob your house or rob your wife or rob you to pay it and that money goes back to the banks.
[01:09:00.751 --> 01:09:16.891]  Then, when they catch the low-level zombies who were on their product, they then put them in large private prisons owned by the big money-laundering banks, to then work for 25 cents an hour, driving down wages and displacing your jobs.
[01:09:16.891 --> 01:09:18.052]  And the good old boys cheer it!
[01:09:19.076 --> 01:09:21.097]  And they say, I work at the prison.
[01:09:21.097 --> 01:09:23.518]  I work at the Justice Center.
[01:09:23.518 --> 01:09:26.079]  And then their own son's in there and they're proud of it.
[01:09:26.079 --> 01:09:30.021]  My boy's in prison now, I'm over him, but that's a good thing.
[01:09:30.021 --> 01:09:31.121]  That's America.
[01:09:31.121 --> 01:09:34.502]  He got caught with some of them drugs.
[01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:38.084]  Because the only job was dealing drugs or running the prison.
[01:09:39.727 --> 01:09:42.770]  And that's the predatory New World Order economy.
[01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:51.998]  Vicente Fox, who is a globalist, though, is probably pretty sad that his ranch is overrun down in Mexico and that the criminal government down there is going to lose control.
[01:09:51.998 --> 01:09:59.745]  See, they've lost the war with smaller cartels who are, the people are so poor, they're ready to die.
[01:09:59.745 --> 01:10:00.646]  They're not afraid to die.
[01:10:00.646 --> 01:10:02.848]  Pretty macho down in Mexico.
[01:10:04.083 --> 01:10:09.688]  I mean, it's more people dying every year than died in a year, three times at least.
[01:10:09.688 --> 01:10:15.433]  Three times the people die every year or more in Mexico in the fake drug war than died on the U.S.
[01:10:15.433 --> 01:10:17.735]  side in the Vietnam War every year.
[01:10:17.735 --> 01:10:20.036]  It's 40-something thousand the last three years.
[01:10:20.036 --> 01:10:26.242]  58,000 died in over a decade of Vietnam, so do the math.
[01:10:26.242 --> 01:10:27.623]  And so now they're like, cease fire!
[01:10:27.623 --> 01:10:28.524]  Cease fire!
[01:10:29.668 --> 01:10:44.158]  Let's decriminalize this stuff and at the Summit of Americas, with all the hookers and the rest of it, with all of this going on, the news with the Latin American leaders was decriminalize.
[01:10:44.158 --> 01:10:46.000]  Stop it.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.961]  They know Europe in some areas has done this.
[01:10:47.961 --> 01:10:50.423]  Crime rates have dropped massively.
[01:10:50.423 --> 01:10:54.526]  People then see drugs as a sad disease, not as sexy, associated with money.
[01:10:54.526 --> 01:10:56.047]  But see, the system has a two-pronged attack.
[01:10:57.068 --> 01:11:03.829]  Get now over 20% of the population of women or higher, men close to that, school children over 20% on psychotropic brain damaging drugs.
[01:11:03.829 --> 01:11:09.170]  And when they go haywire and kill people, they just then call for taking our guns.
[01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:11.371]  And then also push the illegal drugs on them.
[01:11:11.371 --> 01:11:19.713]  And the quote US government, that means the big banks that run our government that launder the money and control the federal reserve, they said, no, we're not getting rid of it.
[01:11:19.713 --> 01:11:25.534]  In fact, we're going to keep shipping guns into Mexico and Honduras to keep destabilizing things.
[01:11:25.534 --> 01:11:26.094]  We like it.
[01:11:28.171 --> 01:11:32.075]  We like it just fine, because the war on drugs is a success.
[01:11:32.075 --> 01:11:46.307]  Corrupt the police, imprison the population, bring in drugs, kill the people with ODs, destroy society, have SWAT teams busting houses, kill people, kill people's dogs, kill insurance salesman's wrong house, corrupt the police.
[01:11:47.128 --> 01:11:59.534]  You think prohibition, ten years of alcohol prohibition, tripling the size of the mafia, corrupting police, hundreds and hundreds of millions made in those days, numbers, a year, you think that was a success, prohibition for the mafia?
[01:11:59.534 --> 01:12:00.915]  Or was it a failure?
[01:12:00.915 --> 01:12:03.616]  Oh no, don't make alcohol illegal!
[01:12:03.616 --> 01:12:07.458]  That, you just made it criminal's domain!
[01:12:09.141 --> 01:12:16.565]  The government, the feds deal with child molestation rules and kidnapping rules, because they publicly run most of the child kidnapping.
[01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:33.075]  They'll make a big deal out of some loan scumbag, but when they're loading little kids on C-130s to be flown to Saudi Arabia to have their heads beat in with claw hammers, and snuff film with shotgun blast to the head, you know what it comes out, Italian news reports it, German news reports it, they fire the people that report it.
[01:12:33.075 --> 01:12:34.916]  Not because they were wrong, but because U.S.
[01:12:34.916 --> 01:12:36.077]  government officials are involved.
[01:12:40.805 --> 01:12:45.789]  You got people that like to beat little kids' heads in with hammers after they rape them.
[01:12:45.789 --> 01:12:46.770]  That's who runs the world.
[01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:48.972]  Okay?
[01:12:48.972 --> 01:12:52.695]  And... Go look at what I just said, by the way.
[01:12:52.695 --> 01:12:54.476]  You're gonna be like, that's a true story?
[01:12:54.476 --> 01:12:55.497]  Oh, yeah!
[01:12:55.497 --> 01:12:56.558]  Would you like to hear more?
[01:12:56.558 --> 01:13:01.903]  It's kinda like Starship Troopers on the news.
[01:13:01.903 --> 01:13:02.944]  Would you like to hear more?
[01:13:02.944 --> 01:13:04.665]  We take you now to Clandethu.
[01:13:04.665 --> 01:13:07.828]  We take you now to the planet Earth, where the crazy people run things.
[01:13:08.939 --> 01:13:11.260]  The New World Order is insane.
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:14.521]  And I want to bring this up to top researchers.
[01:13:14.521 --> 01:13:17.322]  A great researcher, Alan Watt.
[01:13:17.322 --> 01:13:23.165]  Musician, author, radio host in his own right, CuttingTheMatrix.com.
[01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:26.686]  I want to get him on with us and out of the gates hear what he has to say today.
[01:13:26.686 --> 01:13:29.787]  Maybe hold him a little bit in the next hour and take some calls.
[01:13:29.787 --> 01:13:36.290]  But I wanted to get Alan on today to bring up this point because I have a theory, but it's not really a theory.
[01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:38.251]  It's kind of like I have a theory
[01:13:39.286 --> 01:13:46.013]  That crawdads come up to the edge of the water and hunt little frogs and things.
[01:13:46.013 --> 01:13:48.896]  Little crawdads, little freshwater lobsters, little freshwater crustaceans.
[01:13:48.896 --> 01:13:49.617]  It's not a theory.
[01:13:49.617 --> 01:13:50.398]  I watch them do it.
[01:13:50.398 --> 01:13:57.926]  I don't have a theory that ducks fly south in the winter and back north in the spring.
[01:14:01.138 --> 01:14:02.318]  I know it.
[01:14:02.318 --> 01:14:03.779]  And I've studied elites.
[01:14:03.779 --> 01:14:04.679]  It's like a tropism.
[01:14:04.679 --> 01:14:13.481]  In every case, going back to the beginnings of civilization, every culture built pyramids and sacrificed children on top of them every day.
[01:14:13.481 --> 01:14:15.561]  Every culture ate children.
[01:14:15.561 --> 01:14:18.522]  Every culture tortured people.
[01:14:18.522 --> 01:14:19.763]  What is that?
[01:14:19.763 --> 01:14:21.403]  That's what cultures always end in.
[01:14:23.073 --> 01:14:26.755]  Because psychopath, inbred, crazy people keep inbreeding.
[01:14:26.755 --> 01:14:28.176]  They're the ones that are like cancer.
[01:14:28.176 --> 01:14:30.036]  They're willing to do whatever to have power.
[01:14:30.036 --> 01:14:31.497]  They lust after it.
[01:14:31.497 --> 01:14:32.518]  And then something happens.
[01:14:32.518 --> 01:14:44.343]  They interbreed, which in every mammal species causes crazy behavior, antisocial behavior, megalomania, aggression, a sense of psychodomination,
[01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:48.635]  Masochistic, bloodlust, bloodthirst, every culture.
[01:14:48.635 --> 01:14:49.655]  Study history.
[01:14:49.655 --> 01:14:51.476]  But then something worse happens.
[01:14:51.476 --> 01:14:55.097]  Syphilis has been with humans as long as we've been on this planet.
[01:14:55.097 --> 01:14:59.618]  Syphilis, basically, is microscopic worms that eat your brain.
[01:14:59.618 --> 01:15:04.299]  And almost all elites that have been studied had syphilitic brains.
[01:15:04.299 --> 01:15:07.880]  Pharaohs, mafiadons, British royalty.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:11.321]  Jack the Ripper, the Crown Prince, running around killing people.
[01:15:11.321 --> 01:15:14.082]  So you've got syphilitic brains, inner-breathing,
[01:15:14.838 --> 01:15:22.283]  With aggressive, dominant people creating hyper-psychopathic, blood-drinking goblin creatures, basically.
[01:15:22.283 --> 01:15:24.005]  That's what the New World Order is.
[01:15:24.005 --> 01:15:25.366]  That's why they do this.
[01:15:25.366 --> 01:15:27.767]  Why does a spider spin a certain web?
[01:15:27.767 --> 01:15:30.890]  Why does a squirrel bury nuts?
[01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:33.852]  It's inbred into them.
[01:15:33.852 --> 01:15:39.676]  Normal, wholesome people are blind to this because it's so alien.
[01:15:39.676 --> 01:15:43.719]  If we can ever admit and discover this historically, we wouldn't be doomed to repeat it.
[01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:48.970]  Alright, I take you now to Canada and Alan Watt joining us.
[01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:55.936]  Alan, what do you think of my statements and what do you think of the point I made with the inbreeding of the syphilitic brain overlay?
[01:15:55.936 --> 01:15:58.979]  Oh, it's pretty accurate.
[01:15:58.979 --> 01:16:04.644]  I mean, even Lenin, they found out the left part of his brain was pretty well eaten away when he died.
[01:16:04.644 --> 01:16:08.327]  And of course, it was insane basically for the last few months.
[01:16:08.327 --> 01:16:10.029]  So, it's a very common thing.
[01:16:11.122 --> 01:16:37.803]  It really turns up in the second and third generation of elite where they might all start off as gangsters or robbers or murderers probably all of them in fact and then the third generation who get the education come along and they start to form their clubs and then they discuss the normal topics like why are we so different from all the peasants that we rule over and they come up with their own theories
[01:16:38.656 --> 01:16:42.699]  And what they came up with, of course, is there's always been slavery as a natural thing.
[01:16:42.699 --> 01:16:44.561]  Slavery is a natural thing.
[01:16:44.561 --> 01:16:51.706]  And the peasants are always in a different mindset than we are, because we're the leisure class.
[01:16:51.706 --> 01:16:54.849]  And we have time to think about things, but the peasant doesn't.
[01:16:54.849 --> 01:16:59.092]  And then, of course, the fourth generation comes along and they say, well, the peasant actually can't think about that.
[01:16:59.092 --> 01:17:00.853]  He's actually inferior.
[01:17:00.853 --> 01:17:02.194]  He's low IQ.
[01:17:02.194 --> 01:17:04.436]  And this goes on for many, many generations.
[01:17:13.065 --> 01:17:20.606]  And again, if you study the royalty, the Rothschilds, all of them, generally half the offspring are locked up in asylums, that's the half that survived.
[01:17:20.606 --> 01:17:31.548]  Generally about half die, and the half that live, half are criminally insane, literally acting like monkeys, and the other half are just psychopathic control freaks.
[01:17:32.233 --> 01:17:39.357]  The Control Freaks, but you must remember, too, these characters, like the Rothschilds, belong to their own secret societies.
[01:17:39.357 --> 01:17:40.798]  And they have them.
[01:17:40.798 --> 01:17:46.280]  And Benjamin Franklin, in fact, joined a couple of them, in fact.
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:47.961]  Hellfire Club, yum!
[01:17:47.961 --> 01:17:51.363]  Yeah, and one in France, too, the Ninth Sister's Lodge.
[01:17:51.363 --> 01:17:54.525]  And he lived the same kind of lifestyle as the kids over in France.
[01:17:54.525 --> 01:17:58.327]  When you see how much he was given per month by the French government.
[01:17:58.999 --> 01:18:06.546]  And the mansion he grew up in, and the parties he had, endless parties and all the top women of the day, etc.
[01:18:06.546 --> 01:18:08.768]  He actually enjoyed that lifestyle.
[01:18:08.768 --> 01:18:13.852]  But the thing is, corruption has always ruled the world.
[01:18:13.852 --> 01:18:23.881]  Charles Galton Darwin said the same thing, and he was another inbred, descended from Charles Darwin, related to the Huxleys, of course, all the top names are all related together.
[01:18:24.819 --> 01:18:29.182]  And he said, there's always been slavery in one form or another.
[01:18:29.182 --> 01:18:37.147]  And of course, democracy is another form of this kind of slavery, and with income taxes, etc., and property taxes.
[01:18:37.147 --> 01:18:41.470]  And he says, we are in the process of creating a more efficient form of slavery.
[01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:43.472]  That was the 1950s.
[01:18:43.472 --> 01:18:51.177]  Well, you were seeing the birth pangs as they go through all, treating the public to be terrifying, because they use the Soviet system as well, by the way.
[01:18:52.399 --> 01:18:58.221]  And we were supposed to be under the threat of power being used against us.
[01:18:58.221 --> 01:18:59.422]  It works very effectively.
[01:18:59.422 --> 01:19:02.683]  As I say, it worked terribly well in the Soviet Union.
[01:19:02.683 --> 01:19:07.945]  And the kill method here isn't taking you at the moment into the streets and shooting you.
[01:19:07.945 --> 01:19:14.668]  The kill method is, of course, as you mentioned earlier, is to do with giving you cancers.
[01:19:14.668 --> 01:19:17.169]  Cancers and various diseases that
[01:19:18.413 --> 01:19:21.177]  You're never fully 100% fit.
[01:19:21.177 --> 01:19:22.379]  Nobody today is.
[01:19:22.379 --> 01:19:24.302]  You can't be.
[01:19:24.302 --> 01:19:28.128]  With inoculations, and poisoned foods, etc.
[01:19:28.128 --> 01:19:30.531]  Elite don't get those injections.
[01:19:30.531 --> 01:19:30.812]  They don't.
[01:19:31.949 --> 01:19:39.633]  And by the way, they brag about how they do it, but when you tell the general public about this, they're like, oh, that's scary, I just decide that isn't true.
[01:19:39.633 --> 01:19:41.394]  And the elites say, see?
[01:19:41.394 --> 01:19:44.295]  We openly admit we're killing them, and they don't care.
[01:19:44.295 --> 01:19:48.358]  And the mothers are like, that's right, I'm taking my kid in to give him a cancer shot right now.
[01:19:48.358 --> 01:19:51.679]  And then the mother will get attention when their kid dies a horrible death of cancer.
[01:19:51.679 --> 01:19:53.580]  And that, at the end of the day, is really what matters.
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:57.542]  It's like, gee, can my kid get cancer so I can buy him the Cancer Barbie?
[01:19:57.542 --> 01:19:58.423]  That's what they really want.
[01:20:01.078 --> 01:20:05.540]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:08.881]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:20:08.881 --> 01:20:13.283]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[01:20:13.283 --> 01:20:14.284]  Here's why.
[01:20:14.284 --> 01:20:20.406]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:20:20.406 --> 01:20:24.888]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:20:25.268 --> 01:20:31.652]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[01:20:31.652 --> 01:20:35.495]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:20:35.495 --> 01:20:41.439]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:20:41.439 --> 01:20:47.043]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:50.045]  Go to mysolarbackup.com for more information.

[01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:47.411]  For emergency preparedness, self-reliance and food independence.
[01:24:08.311 --> 01:24:09.952]  Alan Watt is our guest.
[01:24:09.952 --> 01:24:11.754]  We'll open the phones up for those that are holding.
[01:24:11.754 --> 01:24:14.656]  You can talk about any issue.
[01:24:14.656 --> 01:24:21.682]  But we're discussing total control freaks who enjoy hurting the natural order.
[01:24:21.682 --> 01:24:22.523]  They want to be God.
[01:24:22.523 --> 01:24:26.126]  They're trying to overthrow the natural creation.
[01:24:26.126 --> 01:24:27.487]  Ugliness is beautiful to them.
[01:24:28.177 --> 01:24:30.318]  Alan, you were getting into their admissions.
[01:24:30.318 --> 01:24:33.620]  And what's incredible is we've posted all these documents, you've covered it.
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:36.202]  They admit they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:24:36.202 --> 01:24:44.346]  We have videos of the inventors of some of the biggest vaccines joking about killing hundreds of millions and laughing on PBS.
[01:24:44.346 --> 01:24:46.727]  And you talk to trendies and they go, well, there are too many people.
[01:24:46.727 --> 01:24:50.469]  And I'm like, listen, you maggot, you're being injected too.
[01:24:50.469 --> 01:24:51.430]  The GMO is for you.
[01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:52.851]  And they're like, whatever.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:25:00.987]  It's like they think if they decide they've joined it, it's like they're on the team, even though they're being destroyed by it.
[01:25:00.987 --> 01:25:02.309]  And that's part of the mind control.
[01:25:02.309 --> 01:25:03.210]  Alan Watt, continue.
[01:25:04.076 --> 01:25:10.240]  Yeah, that's all part of the education and fact you get at school and social sciences.
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.221]  There's many names for it.
[01:25:11.221 --> 01:25:16.004]  There's really a new indoctrination into the value of life.
[01:25:16.004 --> 01:25:17.365]  What is the value of life?
[01:25:17.365 --> 01:25:22.007]  Are we more important than those guys over in sub-Sahara or wherever?
[01:25:22.007 --> 01:25:27.351]  And they've already indoctrinated a whole bunch into that death is good.
[01:25:28.494 --> 01:25:37.341]  Orwell mentioned this too, not Orwell, but Huxley in Brave New World, where the children are brought round to dying, and it's a big party time.
[01:25:37.341 --> 01:25:45.487]  And now of course we're getting into euthanasia now, they've already been prepared for it, a whole generation is prepared, the death is all right, and we should just celebrate it.
[01:25:45.487 --> 01:25:55.434]  And from then it goes on to, well why don't we just kill them off earlier, there's too many people, or the pensioners will take all the money, it's going to cost a fortune to keep them going, why not just use the money for us?
[01:25:56.189 --> 01:26:01.692]  And this is all happening right now as we speak, and no one really understands how it's all connected.
[01:26:01.692 --> 01:26:03.052]  We live through a plan.
[01:26:03.052 --> 01:26:08.675]  Everything from government is still the same part of the long-term agenda.
[01:26:08.675 --> 01:26:19.300]  Depopulation, a sovietized world, technically that's what it is, it's a sovietized world where right now they haven't bludgeoned everybody to death that they don't like.
[01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:22.582]  They're simply doing the soft kill and bringing down the populations globally.
[01:26:23.562 --> 01:26:41.164]  And whenever these third world countries sign on to the United Nations and the bubbles they give them, and bubbles are awfully good, we've had it used on ourselves at one time a long time ago, and they take the bubbles and then they take the injections from the World Health Organization and immediately fertility problems.
[01:26:42.003 --> 01:26:46.905]  And they have very early cancer onsets, especially in women too.
[01:26:46.905 --> 01:26:49.206]  It disrupts our whole hormonal system.
[01:26:49.206 --> 01:26:51.767]  Males as well turn into females almost.
[01:26:51.767 --> 01:26:54.128]  And that's the bisphenols, the estrogens.
[01:26:54.128 --> 01:26:58.630]  They've known about the bisphenols since the late 1800s when they first discovered them.
[01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:00.991]  They knew what it did to the public then.
[01:27:00.991 --> 01:27:05.714]  And they waited until the 1950s to put it into the plastic bottles, plastic pipes.
[01:27:05.714 --> 01:27:06.534]  Everything's plastic.
[01:27:07.134 --> 01:27:07.354]  I think?
[01:27:29.049 --> 01:27:31.430]  Talked about in his book Tragedy and Hope.
[01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:37.153]  So, it's hard for most folk to think that that can continue, but it does.
[01:27:37.153 --> 01:27:39.715]  You can understand how long the Soviet system lasted.
[01:27:39.715 --> 01:27:44.517]  It took a hundred years to plan the takeover by the Bolsheviks.
[01:27:44.517 --> 01:27:48.079]  A hundred years before even the first revolution in Russia.
[01:27:48.599 --> 01:27:57.928]  These guys are long-term planners because the world is their goal and they work inter-generationally, they employ and train inter-generationally.
[01:27:57.928 --> 01:28:06.116]  And now, of course, with the school systems being pretty well universal, same curriculum, they're all indoctrinated from school.
[01:28:06.116 --> 01:28:08.138]  The education has plummeted since the 50s.
[01:28:09.771 --> 01:28:13.313]  Definitely the 60s, it really went on a rampage then.
[01:28:13.313 --> 01:28:18.596]  And the children are simply indoctrinated into socialism and groupthink.
[01:28:18.596 --> 01:28:22.778]  And especially in the US, individuality is pretty well eradicated.
[01:28:22.778 --> 01:28:25.139]  It's a nasty thing to be an individual.
[01:28:25.139 --> 01:28:30.522]  And the United Nations itself has said their main enemy to their whole agenda is individualism.
[01:28:30.522 --> 01:28:32.183]  It must be destroyed.
[01:28:32.183 --> 01:28:34.464]  So we are living through a plan.
[01:28:35.208 --> 01:28:39.693]  We've got taxes that are crippling the public.
[01:28:39.693 --> 01:28:42.355]  Never mind all the taxes on food.
[01:28:42.355 --> 01:28:44.898]  They're putting a tax here on canned across all of food.
[01:28:44.898 --> 01:28:51.765]  It's just as well now, a value-added tax, or GST, HST, doesn't matter what they call it, it's all a value-added tax.
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:29:04.031]  And we must go into value-added taxes because when you're signing all the free trade agreements, then you're allowing imports from all those countries which are tax-exempt of the import customs.
[01:29:04.031 --> 01:29:05.532]  Therefore, they don't want to lose that money.
[01:29:05.532 --> 01:29:10.717]  They simply put what they're losing onto you and make it up that way through your taxes.
[01:29:10.717 --> 01:29:14.460]  That's why they had to bring in value-added taxes for all free trade countries.
[01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:14.981]  The U.S.
[01:29:14.981 --> 01:29:18.204]  is told to get really hit by that in any significant way.
[01:29:18.504 --> 01:29:19.446]  All right, stay there.
[01:29:19.446 --> 01:29:20.348]  Stay there, Alan.
[01:29:20.348 --> 01:29:25.116]  But what you're saying here is empires don't die, they just reinvent themselves.
[01:29:25.116 --> 01:29:28.362]  And this is a secretive, parasite, Illuminati...
[01:29:29.684 --> 01:29:49.020]  A cult that's much older than the Illuminati, that's just one of the more modern names, that understands how to control humans, that has advanced technologies, and who basically preys on humanity as a predator class, which was put into an allegorical form of the Morlocks and the Eloys by... We're on the march.
[01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:51.542]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.542 --> 01:29:54.205]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.835 --> 01:29:59.896]  I had tried everything.
[01:29:59.896 --> 01:30:02.259]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:30:02.259 --> 01:30:05.382]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:30:05.382 --> 01:30:10.207]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:30:10.207 --> 01:30:16.574]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:30:17.074 --> 01:30:28.277]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:30:28.277 --> 01:30:32.759]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:30:32.759 --> 01:30:39.021]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:30:39.021 --> 01:30:40.161]  Now that's results.
[01:30:40.581 --> 01:30:53.111]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[01:30:58.257 --> 01:30:59.558]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:59.558 --> 01:31:05.143]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:31:05.143 --> 01:31:10.167]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:10.167 --> 01:31:10.648]  It's true.
[01:31:10.648 --> 01:31:15.212]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:31:15.732 --> 01:31:20.956]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:31:20.956 --> 01:31:23.277]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:31:23.277 --> 01:31:28.080]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[01:31:48.813 --> 01:31:54.916]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:31:54.916 --> 01:31:57.297]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:58.217 --> 01:32:02.039]  Right now, the average family spends one-fourth of their income on food.

[01:33:12.225 --> 01:33:15.927]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:23.397 --> 01:33:28.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:28.681]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:28.681 --> 01:33:30.582]  Central, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[01:33:30.582 --> 01:33:31.523]  Eastern.
[01:33:31.523 --> 01:33:34.805]  Blasting out on XM channel 166.
[01:33:34.805 --> 01:33:38.107]  Blasting out over 100 AM and FM stations.

[01:33:52.977 --> 01:34:00.044]  Now number one on Roku, everything, streaming video, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:34:00.044 --> 01:34:02.546]  And you know, I get really fired up.
[01:34:02.546 --> 01:34:04.088]  Their conditioning didn't work on me.
[01:34:06.847 --> 01:34:12.808]  I read hundreds of government documents and republish them where they admit they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:34:12.808 --> 01:34:14.969]  The GMO is designed to sterilize us.
[01:34:14.969 --> 01:34:17.949]  The elites all have their own private farms, are obsessed with it.
[01:34:17.949 --> 01:34:21.250]  Wall Street Journal, LA Times won't eat GMO.
[01:34:21.250 --> 01:34:31.592]  The Monsanto cafeterias at their elite facilities with their scientists, since 1999 they had a rebellion and will not eat GMO.
[01:34:31.592 --> 01:34:33.433]  This is the genetic engineers.
[01:34:33.433 --> 01:34:34.733]  That's Associated Press.
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:41.524]  The Germans, the memos came out a few years ago, said don't take vaccines.
[01:34:41.524 --> 01:34:44.966]  And if you want them, we have a quote, clean vaccine.
[01:34:44.966 --> 01:34:45.967]  It's real.
[01:34:45.967 --> 01:34:48.309]  I take it personal.
[01:34:48.309 --> 01:34:49.690]  I get upset.
[01:34:49.690 --> 01:34:51.991]  Last week, we worked real late.
[01:34:51.991 --> 01:34:54.273]  We're up here at nine at night.
[01:34:54.273 --> 01:34:57.215]  And I said, guys, you've really kicked some rump.
[01:34:57.215 --> 01:34:59.377]  We've reached millions of extra people thanks to your work.
[01:34:59.377 --> 01:35:03.100]  Let me take you out to a Brazilian steakhouse.
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:03.820]  We get there about 930 and
[01:35:06.721 --> 01:35:23.893]  There is a child obviously damaged and I go out on the street afterwards and see people with another child that's got neurological problems and I started crying and I mean sobbing in front of the guys and they'd never seen anything like it.
[01:35:23.893 --> 01:35:28.436]  A few times on air I've kind of thought about something bring up the image because it gets to me.
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:34.001]  This is a soft-kill, covert holocaust against humanity.
[01:35:34.001 --> 01:35:35.782]  The West is dying.
[01:35:35.782 --> 01:35:37.542]  1.3 children for every 2 adults.
[01:35:37.542 --> 01:35:38.942]  We're dying.
[01:35:38.942 --> 01:35:41.743]  It's painful.
[01:35:41.743 --> 01:35:46.784]  I'm not just some selfish idiot that wants to go, whatever, I'm going to drink beer and watch a football game.
[01:35:46.784 --> 01:35:48.325]  I love beauty.
[01:35:48.325 --> 01:35:49.225]  I love poetry.
[01:35:49.225 --> 01:35:50.285]  I love humanity.
[01:35:50.285 --> 01:35:51.646]  I love creativity.
[01:35:51.646 --> 01:35:54.907]  I love the innocence of my children.
[01:35:54.907 --> 01:35:56.387]  And I want them to have a future.
[01:35:58.962 --> 01:36:11.265]  And I think about how we're in the grasp of highly intelligent inbred super psychos who base their culture on syphilitic hallucinations.
[01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:17.367]  We're living in the creation of hallucinating syphilitics.
[01:36:17.367 --> 01:36:18.107]  I mean, that's it.
[01:36:18.107 --> 01:36:21.788]  This is planet syphilis brain.
[01:36:21.788 --> 01:36:23.469]  And Hitler, it turned out, had syphilis.
[01:36:23.469 --> 01:36:23.849]  All of them.
[01:36:24.801 --> 01:36:27.325]  Stalin, Lenin, all of them, rotten brains.
[01:36:27.325 --> 01:36:31.151]  I mean, I now understand it.
[01:36:31.151 --> 01:36:37.260]  We are living in the wonderland of syphilitic, crazy people.
[01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:38.942]  And again, even though they've cured syphilis,
[01:36:40.342 --> 01:36:41.743]  Or the treatments for it by the 40s.
[01:36:41.743 --> 01:36:44.766]  The point is, the whole culture is set by that.
[01:36:44.766 --> 01:36:48.369]  Inbreeding, syphilis, this is what democide is.
[01:36:48.369 --> 01:36:55.776]  This is why leaders throughout history, right when they have total control, just say, black uniforms, mass murder, burn cities, death, blah!
[01:36:55.776 --> 01:37:01.481]  That's what somebody with syphilitic brain rot will just go out and start stabbing people.
[01:37:01.481 --> 01:37:06.386]  Well, you give people, because again, the elites are having sex with 20, 30 women, men a day.
[01:37:07.822 --> 01:37:08.282]  Nero.
[01:37:08.282 --> 01:37:10.424]  Every time I say this, people don't believe it.
[01:37:10.424 --> 01:37:11.844]  You can look it up in the history.
[01:37:11.844 --> 01:37:19.129]  Nero, they would have these big day-long parties on holidays that they had basically every week.
[01:37:19.129 --> 01:37:24.112]  And his favorite thing to do with all the Roman elite in his palace is he would dress up like a werewolf.
[01:37:24.112 --> 01:37:25.233]  They'd chain up a child.
[01:37:26.164 --> 01:37:41.975]  And he'd run up, you gotta read deeper into the histories because the main lamas don't like to put this in there, but he'd rape a child in public and then bite their throats out, ripping their arteries out, spraying blood all over him, dressed up in a wolf's outfit.
[01:37:41.975 --> 01:37:51.903]  Caligula, after he married his horse, you don't get the full story on that, he was married to it, you know, he made it the consulate, the head of Rome, the head of the Roman Senate,
[01:37:53.156 --> 01:38:01.983]  He would have the high priest, you read tea leaves, or they throw bones on the ground, or they cut a bowl open and read their liver.
[01:38:01.983 --> 01:38:09.348]  Well, he would have the high priest, and that was one of the last straws for him, read its excrement.
[01:38:09.348 --> 01:38:13.111]  They'd all announce themselves God, and that's what Ray Kurzweil and all of them are doing.
[01:38:13.111 --> 01:38:19.716]  Oh, we're God, we're merging with the computers, release the GMO, whatever happens is natural because we did it and it's a mutation.
[01:38:19.716 --> 01:38:20.817]  They're going to destroy the planet.
[01:38:21.542 --> 01:38:23.423]  Okay, they're crazy.
[01:38:23.423 --> 01:38:32.149]  If Nero wants to marry his horse and rip children's throats out 2,000 years ago or whatever, or 1,800 years ago or whatever, that's bad enough.
[01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:38.633]  They've got nuclear weapons, they've got antimatter weapons, they've got biological weapons, and they're going to kill everybody.
[01:38:38.633 --> 01:38:46.738]  They're building giant underground bases, huge redoubts, seed vaults, total insanity, and everybody that works for these people better start
[01:38:47.458 --> 01:38:50.279]  Sabotaging them however you can to resist them.
[01:38:50.279 --> 01:38:51.360]  And I don't mean physically.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:54.621]  I mean you just better start resisting however you can.
[01:38:54.621 --> 01:38:55.661]  Or there's no future.
[01:38:55.661 --> 01:38:57.962]  Alan Watt, can you feel the sense of immediacy?
[01:38:57.962 --> 01:38:59.063]  You've got the floor.
[01:38:59.063 --> 01:39:00.683]  What do you say about what I just broke down?
[01:39:00.683 --> 01:39:05.746]  What's the latest on Alan Watt cutting to the Matrix.com's radar screen?
[01:39:05.746 --> 01:39:08.707]  Well, they're definitely ready for a big call.
[01:39:08.707 --> 01:39:11.148]  I mean a physical call as well.
[01:39:11.148 --> 01:39:13.969]  You look at the nonsense with the Olympic Games in London.
[01:39:14.685 --> 01:39:17.166]  You've got a warship in the Thames.
[01:39:17.166 --> 01:39:19.908]  You've got guided missile systems.
[01:39:19.908 --> 01:39:23.129]  They're not bringing snipers and helicopters to go over the crowds.
[01:39:23.129 --> 01:39:25.010]  Army snipers.
[01:39:25.010 --> 01:39:32.354]  I mean, this is supposed to be a peacetime country, and everyone is literally living inside a prison camp.
[01:39:32.354 --> 01:39:35.816]  It's the sort of thing you expect in a prison camp.
[01:39:35.816 --> 01:39:39.598]  I mean, a real, you know, futuristic prison camp.
[01:39:39.598 --> 01:39:41.819]  This is not life for the general public.
[01:39:42.535 --> 01:39:47.678]  But the training, they're using these big games, etc.
[01:39:47.678 --> 01:39:55.402]  to get us all trained, through attending the things yourselves, or watching on television, that this is the new system.
[01:39:55.402 --> 01:40:02.446]  Be very afraid of the new system, because there's a lot of really nasty stuff to implement socially still yet.
[01:40:02.446 --> 01:40:05.208]  And they're training the people step by step through fear.
[01:40:05.208 --> 01:40:06.949]  And to be honest with you, I don't see
[01:40:07.857 --> 01:40:11.058]  Any peaceable way out of this?
[01:40:11.058 --> 01:40:21.503]  Because, remember, Quigley said that these guys have been running all the countries in the West since the late 1800s with this particular agenda.
[01:40:21.503 --> 01:40:23.924]  I cannot see them giving up because we asked them nicely.
[01:40:23.924 --> 01:40:31.467]  I can't see them giving up if you try to run your own guys into the offices of the presidency.
[01:40:31.467 --> 01:40:32.787]  I can't see it happening.
[01:40:32.787 --> 01:40:34.888]  It's never happened in a hundred years.
[01:40:34.888 --> 01:40:36.889]  It's always their boy gets in.
[01:40:36.889 --> 01:40:37.229]  And so,
[01:40:38.607 --> 01:40:47.501]  You're living through an agenda, as I say, but at the top of the tree, above even the syphilitics, you have another group who do run the banking system.
[01:40:47.501 --> 01:40:51.988]  Their names are generally never mentioned much in the papers at all because they're not open to the public.
[01:40:51.988 --> 01:40:53.250]  They're not really public figures.
[01:40:54.068 --> 01:40:56.209]  And they have their own particular agenda.
[01:40:56.209 --> 01:41:07.592]  But you've got to go back to ancient times to the present, and this particular society has always said, and Albert Pike said this in his own book, Moral and Dogma for the Masons, the Bible of Freemasonry at the time.
[01:41:07.592 --> 01:41:15.354]  He said, those who will not use their own intellect to think for themselves are therefore meat on the table
[01:41:16.255 --> 01:41:20.016]  And beasts of burden by choice and consent.
[01:41:20.016 --> 01:41:24.357]  Now that really is what's taught to all the elite, generation to generation.
[01:41:24.357 --> 01:41:29.538]  That's the simple explanation they claim as to why you're all down there and they're up there, you see.
[01:41:29.538 --> 01:41:31.798]  You are your inferior species.
[01:41:31.798 --> 01:41:33.299]  You are slaves.
[01:41:33.299 --> 01:41:35.139]  And you never complain.
[01:41:35.139 --> 01:41:39.920]  If you complain, it's always petitions and please, please, please to a bunch of wolves.
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:41.640]  And you get nothing done in return for it.
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:43.581]  It doesn't work, obviously.
[01:41:43.581 --> 01:41:45.101]  So they know they're getting to a step where
[01:41:45.968 --> 01:42:09.410]  You understand democracy, even if it's a farce, I call it a farce, there's never been democracy, but the farce of democracy has to be eliminated altogether eventually in the planned society where you have your own communitarian areas like they have in Britain, they've got regions set up in the states as well, they take power away from your local education authorities, they give it to the state or even between three states.
[01:42:09.850 --> 01:42:11.890]  So it gets further and further away.
[01:42:11.890 --> 01:42:20.792]  The ability for the ordinary person to go and complain about anything to a politician or a representative or an official goes further and further away.
[01:42:20.792 --> 01:42:22.613]  And that trains you that it is remote.
[01:42:22.613 --> 01:42:23.613]  It is remote.
[01:42:23.613 --> 01:42:26.713]  And so eventually you don't even think about complaining to them.
[01:42:26.713 --> 01:42:28.234]  It's out of the question.
[01:42:28.234 --> 01:42:29.094]  You take it for granted.
[01:42:29.094 --> 01:42:33.775]  You're now simply ruled by experts and scientists.
[01:42:33.775 --> 01:42:36.735]  And that's how they've already trained the youngsters.
[01:42:36.735 --> 01:42:38.196]  Youngsters today are already trained in this.
[01:42:38.196 --> 01:42:39.436]  They're getting that at school.
[01:42:40.618 --> 01:42:43.440]  Uh, and, um, it's a better way, they claim.
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:47.443]  And, um, they can do away, eventually, with elections altogether.
[01:42:47.443 --> 01:42:50.506]  Technocracy is a technique now we've watched in Europe.
[01:42:50.506 --> 01:42:56.870]  They place their own boys from the Central Bank of Europe right into countries as the Prime Minister is.
[01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:57.351]  No election.
[01:42:58.221 --> 01:43:01.642]  That's to happen elsewhere too, and in the States as well.
[01:43:01.642 --> 01:43:04.022]  I think in the U.S., though, they'll have a lot more trouble.
[01:43:04.022 --> 01:43:06.183]  They do expect resistance.
[01:43:06.183 --> 01:43:12.884]  Really, what you're going to expect in the States is just simple, not even rebellion.
[01:43:12.884 --> 01:43:25.467]  Be it on a personal level, when people start losing their homes en masse, that type of thing, or they've been told there'll be no more private property under Agenda 21, and they simply burn your house down with you in it, or you evacuate it.
[01:43:25.467 --> 01:43:26.467]  That's really what's happening.
[01:43:27.339 --> 01:43:28.820]  So, in the U.S.
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:39.684]  there will be ragtag, sporadic, uncoordinated, non-disciplined rebellion on small levels.
[01:43:39.684 --> 01:43:41.665]  But look what they're ready for.
[01:43:41.665 --> 01:43:46.987]  Look at the ammunition they ordered in for the Homeland Security for close quarter battle.
[01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:50.849]  You don't use pistol dum-dum bullets, hollow points.
[01:43:53.210 --> 01:43:56.692]  For overseas, you can't use them overseas against other armies.
[01:43:56.692 --> 01:43:59.553]  You can only use them on your own population.
[01:43:59.553 --> 01:44:03.195]  But they've got 750 million rounds ordered.
[01:44:03.195 --> 01:44:04.496]  What do you think that's for?
[01:44:04.496 --> 01:44:08.618]  What do the people out there think that is for?
[01:44:08.618 --> 01:44:10.058]  It's not for target practice.
[01:44:10.058 --> 01:44:11.979]  It's too expensive for target practice.
[01:44:11.979 --> 01:44:14.801]  You use ordinary rounds for that.
[01:44:14.801 --> 01:44:16.942]  It's simply for it to be used on the public.
[01:44:17.739 --> 01:44:22.460]  So the elites are taking no chances whatsoever that anything possibly could go wrong.
[01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:42.827]  But it also is very ominous because you're looking at a war situation where those who will represent government, just like the henchmen in the Soviet Union, will always make sure that, and they do, the selected guys, the pre-selected guys, the armies, you know, every soldier's given psychological tests on the way.
[01:44:42.827 --> 01:44:46.888]  And they know that once, and how many of them they can count on to be the new Soviet army.
[01:44:48.573 --> 01:45:10.783]  That's right, and the ones that are good, they send them to fight the insurgents that are actually financed by the bankers, and it's a full-spectrum dominance, false system, where they see an excuse to be in a country, so they fund both sides to create the fake war, and then the ones that like to be psychopaths, and dominate and control everybody, they bring them back here and put them in command.
[01:45:10.783 --> 01:45:13.544]  To do, and they've been doing that for years now.
[01:45:13.544 --> 01:45:17.166]  Every person who applies to be a police officer has a psychological evaluation,
[01:45:17.884 --> 01:45:19.867]  They don't want an IQ over 95 or 90, 90, 98.
[01:45:22.961 --> 01:45:29.745]  Okay, well let me say this to you, because I know they're scientific, they study every facet of the military-industrial complex, but the globalists are not invincible.
[01:45:29.745 --> 01:45:31.066]  I mean, give me your take on that.
[01:45:49.577 --> 01:45:51.339]  It depends how you see it.
[01:45:51.339 --> 01:46:08.256]  Understand most of what's happening today is through almost perfect conditioning generation by generation through the school system is taken over by entertainment and television and people are pretty well perfectly conditioned.
[01:46:08.256 --> 01:46:10.879]  They really will adapt to almost anything.
[01:46:10.879 --> 01:46:12.721]  They know this by the studies they've done already.
[01:46:13.610 --> 01:46:19.155]  The public, the general public will adapt to almost every situation that you... Let me stop you right there.
[01:46:19.155 --> 01:46:38.130]  I was on an airplane and even wrote his name down and told Ted Anderson about it and he looked at it on his iPhone and then later I lost the guy's name but he was one of the managing director presidents of one of the biggest banks in New York and I was being flown up there to be on The View so I was in first class with him.
[01:46:38.130 --> 01:46:41.673]  He'd come to Austin to visit his dad that was a retired general.
[01:46:42.293 --> 01:46:48.778]  And he knew who I was, I later learned in the talk, and he said, look, people will muddle through anything.
[01:46:48.778 --> 01:46:53.702]  Whatever we do, they'll just adapt to it, and we basically use that against them.
[01:46:53.702 --> 01:46:56.905]  And I told him, no, humanity will prevail.
[01:46:56.905 --> 01:46:59.347]  It was kind of like Winston talking to O'Brien.
[01:46:59.347 --> 01:47:01.068]  But, Alan, I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:47:01.068 --> 01:47:04.791]  There's only one area with you that I don't totally agree with you.
[01:47:05.652 --> 01:47:05.732]  And
[01:47:23.402 --> 01:47:27.865]  That I came out of nowhere by going to AXS TV and stuff like that.
[01:47:27.865 --> 01:47:30.126]  I know you're for real and not controlled.
[01:47:30.126 --> 01:47:36.590]  And I know so many other people in the system itself, not just independents like us, that don't like what's happening.
[01:47:36.590 --> 01:47:38.531]  And I do see a bigger awakening.
[01:47:38.531 --> 01:47:40.252]  And I do see victories.
[01:47:40.252 --> 01:47:43.194]  You know, people can't believe I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[01:47:43.194 --> 01:47:44.415]  They think it must have been fake.
[01:47:44.835 --> 01:47:50.259]  People can't believe that, you know, other stuff, like they think my David Gergen is fake.
[01:47:50.259 --> 01:47:59.107]  Well, no, they never just went and stood outside the main entrance to Madison Square Garden during the RNC in 2004, knowing bigwigs would come in to confront them.
[01:47:59.107 --> 01:48:05.332]  I mean, that's not rocket science to know, okay, there's one of the back entrances where all the VIPs are coming in.
[01:48:05.332 --> 01:48:12.998]  Let's sit here and eat hot dogs, you know, at this stand for an hour and see, and at the time smoke cigarettes, see who comes in here.
[01:48:12.998 --> 01:48:13.858]  Hey, that's David Gergen.
[01:48:13.858 --> 01:48:14.319]  Let's get him.
[01:48:14.659 --> 01:48:18.843]  People who sit there on the bench cannot imagine men of action.
[01:48:18.843 --> 01:48:25.528]  So all I'm saying is, people have to believe they can take action, because I know laying down is not going to do anything.
[01:48:25.528 --> 01:48:28.190]  I mean, what do you say to that?
[01:48:28.190 --> 01:48:32.514]  Well, they know consistently that 80 odd percent of the public will do nothing.
[01:48:34.375 --> 01:48:39.301]  And again, they've got all the statistics there, other countries that measured it, they did it with the Soviet Union.
[01:48:39.301 --> 01:48:44.807]  Dzerzhinsky said at the time, he says, you can beat them, you can starve them.
[01:48:44.807 --> 01:48:46.129]  He says, will they turn around and fight?
[01:48:46.129 --> 01:48:46.930]  He says, no.
[01:48:46.930 --> 01:48:49.072]  He says, they'll eat each other.
[01:48:49.072 --> 01:48:53.057]  Now, that wasn't the first time in history that's happened with overwhelming force.
[01:48:54.352 --> 01:49:00.357]  But the public here haven't seen... You can read about the brutality on the occasional individual.
[01:49:00.357 --> 01:49:04.140]  We see them tasering folk when they're down, unconscious, that kind of stuff.
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:05.862]  We see them kicking, punching them.
[01:49:05.862 --> 01:49:10.185]  But again, we always take it as to be the isolated incident, you see.
[01:49:10.185 --> 01:49:13.468]  It hasn't happened to most people yet.
[01:49:13.468 --> 01:49:20.494]  And because of that, they still think it's been exaggerated when these cases come on television or the internet or whatever.
[01:49:21.403 --> 01:49:23.245]  And to keep the illusion of law and order while they break the law?
[01:49:41.691 --> 01:49:43.152]  And in so many ways.
[01:49:43.152 --> 01:49:47.335]  I mean, if the American people truly were American people.
[01:49:47.335 --> 01:49:53.398]  Remember, the American person of today is not the American person of the 1950s or 40s.
[01:49:53.398 --> 01:49:56.680]  They would not put up with what's happening today.
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:58.001]  Well, that's the hormones.
[01:49:58.001 --> 01:49:59.302]  I mean, that's the hormones.
[01:49:59.302 --> 01:50:03.205]  As you know, people eat, compared to the 50s diet, a lot healthier now.
[01:50:03.205 --> 01:50:04.385]  They're a lot more obese.
[01:50:04.385 --> 01:50:05.166]  That's on record.
[01:50:05.166 --> 01:50:07.187]  They're just killing us with the hormones.
[01:50:07.187 --> 01:50:07.807]  And they love it.
[01:50:07.807 --> 01:50:07.987]  It's fun.
[01:50:09.437 --> 01:50:13.300]  Yeah, but it also has to do with a massive education.
[01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:22.288]  If you were ever to try and truly alter the main thing, I mean Lenin said the same thing, Stalin said it too, you must pay your police, your military and your teachers.
[01:50:23.348 --> 01:50:25.710]  And by the way, I saw this article where a six year old girl...
[01:50:39.941 --> 01:50:41.864]  We'll talk about when we get back briefly.
[01:50:41.864 --> 01:50:44.307]  They don't let the parents discipline their children.
[01:50:44.307 --> 01:50:45.708]  Then the kids get out of control.
[01:50:45.708 --> 01:50:49.573]  Then they handcuff you, taser you, put you in a mental institution.
[01:50:49.573 --> 01:50:55.080]  It's like only the warrior aunts can engage in discipline.
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.362]  It's ending parenthood.
[01:50:56.362 --> 01:50:56.942]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:58.564 --> 01:51:05.707]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:51:05.707 --> 01:51:21.476]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves and
[01:51:21.556 --> 01:51:23.416]  Fight off cancer and be healthy.
[01:51:23.416 --> 01:51:29.538]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Yungevity.
[01:51:29.538 --> 01:51:37.620]  The Yungevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:39.061]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[01:51:41.121 --> 01:51:43.885]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:51:43.885 --> 01:51:45.166]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:51:45.166 --> 01:51:46.027]  It's incredible.
[01:51:46.027 --> 01:51:55.139]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[01:51:55.139 --> 01:51:57.041]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:51:58.752 --> 01:52:02.054]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:52:02.054 --> 01:52:10.038]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:52:10.038 --> 01:52:15.241]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[01:52:15.241 --> 01:52:18.163]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.
[01:52:18.163 --> 01:52:21.425]  Visit us at crossbreedholsters.com.
[01:52:21.425 --> 01:52:24.626]  Don't forget, crossbreedholsters.com.
[01:52:24.626 --> 01:52:26.948]  That's crossbreedholsters.com.
[01:52:28.081 --> 01:52:32.083]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[01:52:32.083 --> 01:52:41.468]  That something is Atwood Rope, the highest quality rope made in the USA from exotic braids for military, rescue, arborists, shipyards, tow line, or boating.
[01:52:41.468 --> 01:52:45.010]  Quality rope at affordable prices you and your customers can depend on.

[01:52:53.394 --> 01:52:56.036]  Atwood Rope, working to keep the world tied together.
[01:52:57.315 --> 01:53:04.757]  Many scientific studies have linked inflammation in the human body to several common health challenges suffered by Americans every day.
[01:53:04.757 --> 01:53:09.159]  This idea about essential fatty acids getting turned into inflammatory or non-inflammatory chemicals.
[01:53:09.159 --> 01:53:15.761]  If you're dealing with an inflammatory issue like arthritis, many diseases and many immune conditions have inflammatory components.
[01:53:16.161 --> 01:53:23.228]  If you have any inflammatory issues, essential fatty acids are maybe the most important nutritional supplements you could use.
[01:53:23.228 --> 01:53:28.473]  If you have fat absorption problems, you're going to want to take your EFAs with digestive enzymes, with fatty meals.
[01:53:28.473 --> 01:53:35.199]  It can also help improve your ability to process and absorb these super, super mega important nutritional compounds, essential fatty acids.
[01:53:35.299 --> 01:53:43.762]  To keep inflammation at a minimum in your body, do what Ben Fuchs does and order Ultimate EFAs and Ultimate EFA Plus from Longevity by calling 866-735-2470.
[01:53:43.762 --> 01:53:44.242]  That's 866-735-2470.

[01:54:17.355 --> 01:54:23.450]  You know, it's depressing to hear some of the things Alan Watts says, but it's better than living in denial.
[01:54:25.916 --> 01:54:27.877]  But I know we can beat these people.
[01:54:27.877 --> 01:54:42.007]  I know that if you have a total awakening by a large enough minority to the full spectrum of just how bad it is, and how this is a false reality to a great extent, a false environment, they're trying to complete.
[01:54:42.007 --> 01:54:45.269]  They're not done with it, but they're accelerating their program.
[01:54:45.269 --> 01:54:51.793]  And they're accelerating their program because from my research, they got behind in the 80s and 90s.
[01:54:51.793 --> 01:54:55.576]  Now they're trying to catch up, and now they're at warp speed.
[01:54:57.257 --> 01:54:58.697]  They're at warp speed.
[01:54:58.697 --> 01:55:02.139]  We're going to go back to Alan Watt here in a moment.
[01:55:02.139 --> 01:55:03.860]  He's agreed to stay 30 minutes to the next hour.
[01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:10.342]  And I'll get to Skywalker, Christopher, Judy, Richard, Jessica, and others for your questions.
[01:55:10.342 --> 01:55:13.644]  For both of us, the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:55:13.644 --> 01:55:18.846]  If you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you can notice we're carrying two new films.
[01:55:18.846 --> 01:55:21.788]  Farmageddon, we've got the director coming on, what is it, Friday.
[01:55:22.808 --> 01:55:30.050]  Amazing film, how the system is waging war on farmers, and how Big Agra is funding that to shut them down.
[01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:31.370]  All part of Agenda 21.
[01:55:31.370 --> 01:55:36.352]  We carry Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey at Infowars.com.
[01:55:36.352 --> 01:55:40.453]  Also, the six-hour documentary, The Toronto Hearings on 9-11.
[01:55:40.453 --> 01:55:45.394]  The latest info, Proving the Inside Job, amazing, by our friend and director, Dan Dix.
[01:55:45.394 --> 01:55:47.275]  All available at Infowars.com.
[01:55:47.275 --> 01:55:51.716]  And all orders get the Citizen Rulebook, Declaration of Independence, Constitution, famous quotes.
[01:55:53.115 --> 01:55:56.637]  Also, Yongevity, the best products out there.
[01:55:56.637 --> 01:56:03.981]  Discounts for our listeners when they go to infowarsteam.com and sign up to be distributors, and your purchase makes this broadcast possible.
[01:56:03.981 --> 01:56:05.842]  Look right here, got my pollen burst.
[01:56:05.842 --> 01:56:12.065]  Instead of drinking coffee, I used to have coffee in the morning, coffee at noon, coffee at five.
[01:56:12.065 --> 01:56:17.968]  Didn't give me the kick that a pollen burst with all the B vitamins, and yes, it's got some caffeine, but about half as much as a regular cup of coffee.
[01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:22.462]  Every other energy drink I ever had, I hated.
[01:56:22.462 --> 01:56:24.463]  This is full of vitamins and minerals.
[01:56:24.463 --> 01:56:25.424]  Will blow you away.
[01:56:25.424 --> 01:56:27.105]  It is so awesome.
[01:56:27.105 --> 01:56:31.889]  A good, clean energy I need right through to shoot the nightly news tonight and everything else.
[01:56:31.889 --> 01:56:32.830]  This is a godsend.
[01:56:32.830 --> 01:56:39.094]  I've lost over 40 pounds taking the Tangy Tangerine, Beyond Tangy Tangerine, that isn't even advertised.
[01:56:39.895 --> 01:56:41.636]  Isn't even advertised as weight loss.
[01:56:41.636 --> 01:56:44.078]  Once you get the minerals and things you need, it's incredible.
[01:56:44.078 --> 01:56:52.183]  So again, Beyond Tangy Tangerine, discounted and available at Infowarsteam.com or 877-551-1301 if you have questions.
[01:56:52.183 --> 01:56:55.005]  You can order on the site or sign up and become a distributor.
[01:56:55.005 --> 01:56:58.448]  Allen, I was mentioning this KENS San Antonio article.
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:01.321]  And then I've got another one here.
[01:57:01.321 --> 01:57:04.264]  This is out of 13 WMAZ.
[01:57:04.264 --> 01:57:06.806]  Police handcuff six-year-old girl for misbehaving.
[01:57:06.806 --> 01:57:11.470]  And they said, you're not allowed to spank your kids, but we're going to taser them or handcuff them.
[01:57:11.470 --> 01:57:18.275]  And they're charging her with resisting and now want to put her in the juvenile hall, where she'll probably get gang raped and learn how to have diseases.
[01:57:18.275 --> 01:57:19.176]  What is this all about?
[01:57:19.176 --> 01:57:21.438]  We're about to go to break, but tell us briefly.
[01:57:21.438 --> 01:57:23.039]  Again, it's a Sovietization.
[01:57:23.039 --> 01:57:25.241]  They use these techniques in the Soviet system.
[01:57:26.167 --> 01:57:30.592]  And the training the public here to get used to it as well.
[01:57:30.592 --> 01:57:33.396]  Pretty well everything that's happening is sovietization.
[01:57:33.396 --> 01:57:38.722]  The regionalism, the free trade agreement all came out of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:57:38.722 --> 01:57:44.388]  The Council on Foreign Relations is one of the main spearheads of control of this in the US and across the world too.
[01:57:44.388 --> 01:57:45.810]  They run the EU Parliament.
[01:57:46.778 --> 01:57:57.347]  And they boast on their own website in Britain that it was their members that brought in the personal income tax and the property tax in the States and in Britain.
[01:57:57.347 --> 01:58:04.773]  I mean, these guys want to bring in their planned society, which they rule over totally, with peasants going back to renting.
[01:58:04.773 --> 01:58:07.835]  And of course, to get the cash for renting, you've got to be very politically correct.
[01:58:08.856 --> 01:58:09.817]  Look at interviews.
[01:58:09.817 --> 01:58:11.858]  I get lots of folk telling me about interviews now.
[01:58:11.858 --> 01:58:13.118]  It's all PC stuff.
[01:58:13.118 --> 01:58:14.019]  What do you think it is?
[01:58:14.019 --> 01:58:14.799]  What do you think it at?
[01:58:14.799 --> 01:58:17.900]  It's all the latest upgrade in PC.
[01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:20.882]  And if you get that job, then you can pay your rent.
[01:58:20.882 --> 01:58:21.942]  It's all about trending.
[01:58:21.942 --> 01:58:22.863]  You don't have thoughts.
[01:58:22.863 --> 01:58:25.344]  You're successful because you do whatever they're told.
[01:58:25.344 --> 01:58:26.144]  Yeah.
[01:58:26.144 --> 01:58:28.525]  And people will adapt into what is politically correct.
[01:58:28.525 --> 01:58:29.105]  Stay there.
[01:58:29.105 --> 01:58:33.527]  I want to bring up to you how HBO's pushing pedophilia now.
[01:58:33.527 --> 01:58:35.368]  Why are the elite pushing that?
[01:58:35.368 --> 01:58:36.269]  Alan wants our guess.
[01:58:38.874 --> 01:58:40.297]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:44.865 --> 01:59:51.228]  Save fuel, save money, save Earth!
[01:59:51.228 --> 01:59:53.629]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:53.629 --> 01:59:56.090]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:01.084 --> 02:00:04.306]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com.
[02:00:04.306 --> 02:00:07.668]  Alan Watt of CuttingTheMatrix.com is our guest.
[02:00:07.668 --> 02:00:10.230]  Spot on research into the globalist hierarchy.
[02:00:10.230 --> 02:00:12.492]  We debate just how insurmountable
[02:00:31.384 --> 02:00:36.208]  It's lodging ourselves from their grass fish.
[02:00:36.208 --> 02:00:39.510]  But what about just assailing the normal values?
[02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:44.034]  Having the TSA grope, the TSA every day, new pedophile scandals?
[02:00:45.936 --> 02:00:46.236]  I don't know.
[02:01:04.426 --> 02:01:08.730]  All these comedians doing, you know, talking about how great abortion is and how killing babies is great.
[02:01:08.730 --> 02:01:10.672]  You know, they say it's fun.
[02:01:10.672 --> 02:01:12.414]  It's like before, it's like we just, it's a right.
[02:01:12.414 --> 02:01:14.476]  Now it's like we like killing babies.
[02:01:14.476 --> 02:01:20.301]  Shows who are really seeing, I guess they're turning the public into themselves.
[02:01:20.301 --> 02:01:22.323]  I mean, what's going on here?
[02:01:22.323 --> 02:01:28.569]  Well, remember too, the whole manifesto, and there's two or three manifestos for the lower, middle, and high.
[02:01:29.651 --> 02:01:37.536]  The top manifesto talked about what they've pretty well accomplished for the majority of the public, and that is the end of the family unit.
[02:01:37.536 --> 02:01:41.979]  I've lost count of the so many youngsters phoning me, and they've never known a dad, most of them.
[02:01:41.979 --> 02:01:43.960]  A whole generation.
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:51.085]  And so that was part of it, because only the parents, and generally the male, would stand up for protecting his wife and his children.
[02:01:51.085 --> 02:01:52.666]  So that had to be abolished.
[02:01:52.666 --> 02:01:57.889]  Once you destroy the family unit, the male, if he's still a male, has nothing much to fight for except himself, you see.
[02:01:58.787 --> 02:02:01.929]  And he's far more ferocious when he's fighting for the rights of his wife and children.
[02:02:02.606 --> 02:02:06.987]  So you'd never allow the groping and all this kind of stuff to go on in the first place.
[02:02:06.987 --> 02:02:11.088]  Plus, again, the culture industry is a big part of this and the movies.
[02:02:11.088 --> 02:02:21.651]  When you watch movie after movie and sex, sex, sex, you're being, again, upgraded to the same program with the latest download and to the new normal, the new normal.
[02:02:21.651 --> 02:02:22.591]  Well, that's acceptable.
[02:02:22.591 --> 02:02:23.312]  That's now acceptable.
[02:02:23.312 --> 02:02:28.453]  It's like what girls watch in all this hardcore porn, the women study show, don't even really like it.
[02:02:28.453 --> 02:02:31.454]  But then the women start doing it because, well, that's what you're supposed to do.
[02:02:31.914 --> 02:02:32.614]  Yes.
[02:02:32.614 --> 02:02:45.398]  And you've now got women dressing up like they're show children that go to these parades, these shows that they go to for top beautiful child sort of thing, that's dressed like a little whore.
[02:02:45.398 --> 02:02:48.879]  And the mothers dress exactly the same with them, like an older whore.
[02:02:48.879 --> 02:02:50.519]  I mean, this is the new normal.
[02:02:50.519 --> 02:02:53.940]  That's the new feminism is turning women into abject whores.
[02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:54.421]  Yeah.
[02:02:54.421 --> 02:02:55.161]  Yeah.
[02:02:55.161 --> 02:02:57.742]  And once you've done that, you see, you've destroyed the family unit.
[02:02:57.742 --> 02:02:59.282]  There's no male input into anything.
[02:03:00.006 --> 02:03:06.288]  The male's going to watch all this stuff and maybe Google it too because they're all degenerate as well.
[02:03:06.288 --> 02:03:11.110]  We all become degenerate through our indoctrination, mainly through comedies and television.
[02:03:11.110 --> 02:03:19.833]  The most perverse stuff will start within a comedy where you don't want to turn it off, you're kind of used to the characters, and it comes near the middle of the story or the movie.
[02:03:20.593 --> 02:03:37.030]  And again, because they know when they destroy your normal, basic human programming, they override it so you can't recognize threats to society, so you're just basically being wrecked psychologically.
[02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:39.293]  This is an attack!
[02:03:39.293 --> 02:03:39.373]  Yes.
[02:03:39.373 --> 02:03:41.174]  And at the United Nations, remember, too,
[02:03:42.616 --> 02:03:45.459]  Which is a big pusher of all of this stuff.
[02:03:45.459 --> 02:03:49.964]  I mean that's the prime function is destroy all the stuff and bring in a sovietized type system.
[02:03:49.964 --> 02:03:56.771]  The sovietized system remembers communitarianism where it's all run by councils right down to your local level.
[02:03:56.771 --> 02:03:59.794]  Then we're getting back to pedophilia and so on.
[02:03:59.794 --> 02:04:01.176]  It's being taught gradually.
[02:04:01.876 --> 02:04:12.943]  This is a very old thing that they try to push, even in the Middle Ages in some countries, that withholding your body from a person who wants the use of it is anti-social.
[02:04:14.261 --> 02:04:17.844]  And they're teaching this gradually, they've been teaching it for years now.
[02:04:17.844 --> 02:04:29.594]  And that's so they can forcibly inoculate you, which is now beginning without parental consent, and then the state says, not only is it your right, now we're going to make you, the state wants to, they're getting you used to being in your space.
[02:04:29.594 --> 02:04:34.778]  Yes, and they're also doing away, you see, gradually, because they're very clever with the use of words and terminology.
[02:04:34.778 --> 02:04:38.622]  I mean, Bush used the Patriot Act, which is the most unpatriotic act, if you're possibly
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:42.123]  Let's talk about word games when we come back and then go to phone calls.
[02:04:42.123 --> 02:04:43.665]  Alan Watts, our guest.
[02:04:43.665 --> 02:04:44.947]  Yeah, I mean, look at the TSA.
[02:04:44.947 --> 02:04:46.388]  They take your little child away from you.
[02:04:46.388 --> 02:04:47.390]  They're crying.
[02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:50.533]  A big fat man comes over and the groping starts.
[02:04:50.533 --> 02:04:51.875]  But it's authority doing it.
[02:04:51.875 --> 02:04:53.897]  They're training you to have your children taken.
[02:04:53.897 --> 02:04:54.959]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:56.803 --> 02:05:03.469]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:03.469 --> 02:05:08.613]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:08.613 --> 02:05:17.340]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:17.340 --> 02:05:21.404]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:21.404 --> 02:05:23.365]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:30.403]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:05:30.403 --> 02:05:34.245]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:05:34.245 --> 02:05:35.486]  Others don't.
[02:05:35.486 --> 02:05:37.627]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:37.627 --> 02:05:39.408]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:39.408 --> 02:05:42.310]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:42.310 --> 02:05:48.934]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:05:48.934 --> 02:05:51.636]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:05:51.636 --> 02:05:53.997]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:05:53.997 --> 02:05:54.497]  Others don't.
[02:05:56.167 --> 02:06:03.394]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:06:03.394 --> 02:06:16.586]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[02:06:16.806 --> 02:06:21.250]  That our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:06:21.250 --> 02:06:27.435]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there, and discovered Youngevity.
[02:06:27.435 --> 02:06:35.602]  The Youngevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:06:35.602 --> 02:06:37.023]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[02:06:39.125 --> 02:06:41.888]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:06:41.888 --> 02:06:43.189]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:44.050]  It's incredible.
[02:06:44.050 --> 02:06:53.259]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[02:06:53.259 --> 02:06:55.101]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:06:55.842 --> 02:07:00.383]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:00.383 --> 02:07:01.303]  Number one.
[02:07:01.303 --> 02:07:04.724]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:04.724 --> 02:07:05.584]  Number two.
[02:07:05.584 --> 02:07:10.486]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:10.486 --> 02:07:11.226]  It's true.
[02:07:11.226 --> 02:07:16.087]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:16.087 --> 02:07:16.907]  Number three.
[02:07:16.907 --> 02:07:20.508]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:20.508 --> 02:07:24.169]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:24.409 --> 02:07:25.210]  Number 4.
[02:07:25.210 --> 02:07:27.972]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:27.972 --> 02:07:31.655]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:31.655 --> 02:07:32.436]  Number 5.
[02:07:32.436 --> 02:07:36.580]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:41.344]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:41.624 --> 02:07:45.808]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:45.808 --> 02:07:47.589]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:47.589 --> 02:07:49.831]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:49.831 --> 02:07:57.778]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:57.778 --> 02:08:04.404]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:04.404 --> 02:08:07.407]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:08.863 --> 02:08:11.530]  Alright, we're going to your phone calls here in a moment.
[02:08:11.530 --> 02:08:14.056]  Christopher first, who's been patient, and others.
[02:08:16.041 --> 02:08:20.384]  But Alan, I wanted to talk to you about the acceleration of the cashless society.
[02:08:20.384 --> 02:08:22.185]  We always said it was coming.
[02:08:22.185 --> 02:08:25.727]  Even if you use cash, they're going to thumbprint or face scan you.
[02:08:25.727 --> 02:08:28.149]  The IRS, same thing Russia's doing.
[02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:38.176]  If they say you haven't paid taxes, no judge or jury, no proof, plus it's even paid to the private Federal Reserve so it's illegitimate and a fraud, then you can't leave the country.
[02:08:39.537 --> 02:08:43.039]  They're saying you won't be able to have a job, you'll just be homeless.
[02:08:43.039 --> 02:08:45.021]  All of this is coming into place.
[02:08:45.021 --> 02:08:48.384]  Open war against farmers, ranchers.
[02:08:48.384 --> 02:08:50.686]  We've got some big breaking news on the TSA.
[02:08:50.686 --> 02:08:54.189]  It's now been announced they've got undercover officers on the streets.
[02:08:54.189 --> 02:08:56.430]  A congresswoman has admitted this.
[02:08:56.430 --> 02:08:59.012]  And on buses, even here in Texas, in Houston.
[02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:03.621]  That's going up on InfoWars.com in the next 30 minutes.
[02:09:03.621 --> 02:09:07.622]  All of this is just, I mean, it's leaping forward.
[02:09:07.622 --> 02:09:11.723]  And in the word games they play of how they're doing this all for our own good.
[02:09:11.723 --> 02:09:12.903]  Alan Watt.
[02:09:12.903 --> 02:09:14.124]  Yeah, it's Orwellian, isn't it?
[02:09:14.124 --> 02:09:15.924]  Everything that they do is Orwellian.
[02:09:15.924 --> 02:09:19.005]  It means the opposite of whatever they tell you it's for.
[02:09:19.005 --> 02:09:27.767]  And it's going to escalate and escalate because they do know, they expect kickback from all the laws that they're pushing through.
[02:09:28.724 --> 02:09:39.635]  And they run these programs through the RAND Corporation to even give estimates on sporadic violence here and there, kicked back from the public, who are very unhappy with what's happening.
[02:09:39.635 --> 02:09:43.139]  And so they're making sure, like all governments have done in the past by the way,
[02:09:44.157 --> 02:09:46.840]  That they've got so many spies out there that they can't miss anything.
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:48.902]  They can't rely totally on electronics.
[02:09:48.902 --> 02:09:55.828]  They've got to also listen to conversations in bars, in restaurants, in buses, wherever people are chatting.
[02:09:55.828 --> 02:09:57.029]  That's what they're out for.
[02:09:57.029 --> 02:09:58.710]  To take the pulse of the public.
[02:09:58.710 --> 02:10:08.719]  To see if they're dumbed down talking about the latest movie, or they're talking about, you know, this is pretty awful what's happening with taxis and so on, or America's becoming a scary place.
[02:10:08.719 --> 02:10:09.700]  That's what they're out there to do.
[02:10:10.433 --> 02:10:15.677]  Britain did it even in the early 1900s when they sent Lawrence to Saudi Arabia.
[02:10:15.677 --> 02:10:25.205]  Oh, BBC, a few years ago, if they hear you just say you don't like open borders, they arrest you, even though there's no law, they arrest you just to create a total fear.
[02:10:25.205 --> 02:10:34.113]  And I told people, the TSA is the new Gestapo minimum wage thug, with Stalin, Hitler, they all create their own little goon force.
[02:10:34.713 --> 02:10:41.039]  And then expand it and they're now everywhere and again, they're caught committing crimes everywhere.
[02:10:41.039 --> 02:10:52.789]  They're just acclimating us to that and now they're admitting on Houston TV, we got the report going up, that yes, the Congresswoman is so proud of it, they're spying on everyone.
[02:10:52.789 --> 02:10:54.671]  So now spying and people are like,
[02:10:55.271 --> 02:11:02.359]  Man, it's good, and then I randomly go to churches now to check them out, and even little country churches are like, worship your government.
[02:11:02.359 --> 02:11:05.423]  I mean, it's just total Soviet Union.
[02:11:05.423 --> 02:11:11.510]  Yeah, because they all belong to the World Council of Churches, and Rockefeller started that up for that very purpose long ago.
[02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:13.532]  So you're living in a planned society.
[02:11:13.532 --> 02:11:15.955]  We're going generation through generation through a plan.
[02:11:16.943 --> 02:11:22.104]  And they'll update the plan once, fine-tune it here and there when they want it to be more effective.
[02:11:22.104 --> 02:11:29.406]  But the reason they publish these articles themselves is to instill into everyone to be like the Soviets were too.
[02:11:29.406 --> 02:11:34.627]  You walk along the street, you look at the sidewalk, don't look up, don't look anybody in the eyes, don't make conversation.
[02:11:34.627 --> 02:11:38.088]  You're being trained literally not to express your thoughts.
[02:11:38.248 --> 02:11:44.913]  And you don't care if they kill you with GMO and cancer viruses and fluoride and radiation, as long as everybody leaves you alone.
[02:11:44.913 --> 02:11:49.396]  So it's all these cowards who are just afraid of being looked at.
[02:11:49.396 --> 02:11:53.979]  So they wear the proper outfit to be trendy, whatever that is in their area, and then that's just it.
[02:11:53.979 --> 02:11:55.520]  And we better shut up.
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:57.182]  You know, the government's corrupt.
[02:11:57.182 --> 02:11:59.503]  Alex is still a kook and crazy and so is Alan Watt.
[02:11:59.503 --> 02:12:01.905]  But it's all real, so we just better shut up.
[02:12:01.905 --> 02:12:03.806]  Yeah, it's all trending in the public.
[02:12:03.806 --> 02:12:05.448]  And again, it's great too with their iPhones.
[02:12:05.448 --> 02:12:07.289]  They can stare at that instead of staring at people.
[02:12:08.061 --> 02:12:14.066]  And simply, you live in your own little world out amongst the general public.
[02:12:14.066 --> 02:12:16.527]  That's the whole training exercise of it.
[02:12:16.527 --> 02:12:18.689]  How do we shock people out of the trance?
[02:12:18.689 --> 02:12:20.591]  Because I do see a lot of people coming out of the trance.
[02:12:20.591 --> 02:12:25.294]  It is a minority, but it's explosive compared to what it used to be.
[02:12:25.294 --> 02:12:28.336]  And they have to get ready to start expressing themselves.
[02:12:28.336 --> 02:12:37.183]  Understand, any change at all, and I'm talking about even peaceful change, will still take sacrifice of many individuals who are persecuted and tortured or killed.
[02:12:38.306 --> 02:12:44.570]  Until enough of them are tortured and killed until even the general public say, you know, this can't go on.
[02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:48.612]  And that's what's happened in the past when tyrannies have risen up to this height.
[02:12:48.612 --> 02:12:53.896]  So it's not a matter of looking for a big massive group to form.
[02:12:53.896 --> 02:12:56.197]  Generally they fall back into the con game of politics.
[02:12:56.197 --> 02:12:59.199]  They're infiltrated and then it goes round in circles.
[02:12:59.199 --> 02:13:07.624]  Both parties, and Carl Quigley said that since the late 1800s, at the top levels have belonged to the same organisation and across the world.
[02:13:08.695 --> 02:13:10.458]  So it's nothing new.
[02:13:10.458 --> 02:13:14.003]  So, you understand, something else has to happen here.
[02:13:14.003 --> 02:13:18.830]  Everything, of course, is within the public's ability, but the public are never unified on anything.
[02:13:19.828 --> 02:13:21.630]  And they could stop going to work tomorrow.
[02:13:21.630 --> 02:13:23.252]  They could stop driving their cars.
[02:13:23.252 --> 02:13:24.473]  They could stop paying their taxes.
[02:13:24.473 --> 02:13:28.557]  They could stop doing a hundred things, but they won't be unified in doing it.
[02:13:28.557 --> 02:13:36.284]  And again, the elites make sure that a good percentage are terrified of being singled out and made an example of.
[02:13:36.284 --> 02:13:38.486]  And that's the common thing, they make an example of you.
[02:13:39.708 --> 02:13:48.277]  Or else, if they are married, or they have a partner or whatever, the partner will nag them, don't stick your head up, don't bring the heat on our house, and so on.
[02:13:48.277 --> 02:13:59.007]  So it's fear that keeps people down, and fear allows... And it's like, give the kids the cancer shots, because they might get in our face about it, so go ahead and brain damage our kid.
[02:13:59.007 --> 02:14:00.709]  Oh yeah, I mean, there's no doubt about it.
[02:14:01.986 --> 02:14:13.811]  Just going over the statistics, and you can get them anywhere pretty well, the graphs for autism and the introduction in the 50s of all inoculations, and they're both side-by-side in the same graph that skyrockets.
[02:14:13.811 --> 02:14:19.213]  Well, a pediatric cancer on average is up 10,000 percent, and I haven't done the graph on if it was...
[02:14:21.551 --> 02:14:34.764]  If roughly 30-something years ago, autism was 1 in 25,340-something, and then now, depending on the actuary, it's 1 in 65 or 1 in 54, it varies right in that area.
[02:14:34.764 --> 02:14:37.267]  Folks will pull up the numbers on that.
[02:14:37.267 --> 02:14:39.489]  I mean, how many thousand point increase is that?
[02:14:39.489 --> 02:14:41.691]  Or diabetes, I know, is like 3,000% for type 2?
[02:14:43.493 --> 02:14:51.240]  Yeah, and if you tack into that, it's about 1 in 4, 1 in 5 who's got a form of autism.
[02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:58.687]  Because really, attention deficit, hyperactivity, all these things are simply degrees of the same thing.
[02:14:58.687 --> 02:15:04.513]  Real autism, of course, is when it's really pronounced and they can't look you in the face and they can't pay attention to you at all.
[02:15:05.436 --> 02:15:08.480]  Uh, all these other categories as well.
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:20.874]  Now, interestingly enough, too, the World Health Organization announced three, four months ago from their own website that they're getting ready for these third world countries.
[02:15:21.834 --> 02:15:26.557]  They're so-called liberating and bringing it into the new system to bring them up to the standard of living.
[02:15:26.557 --> 02:15:38.343]  Well, the first ones in are the World Health Organization and it said they're going to have to do multi-vaccinations on everyone and then it said they'll have to get ready for the sudden tremendous increase in cancers.
[02:15:38.343 --> 02:15:41.464]  This is from the United Nations website.
[02:15:41.464 --> 02:15:42.205]  They know what they're doing.
[02:15:42.205 --> 02:15:44.346]  This is deliberate.
[02:15:44.346 --> 02:15:46.367]  So, you understand, it's already happened to us.
[02:15:46.778 --> 02:16:02.488]  Oh yeah, I saw a big American Medical Association report where they said, we need to start giving children painkillers and tell them to go lie down and get in bed for a day when we give them the shots, because it's freaking mothers out to give them the shot and they throw up, get sick, convulse, and they're just like, it's normal.
[02:16:02.488 --> 02:16:04.929]  There's special things in this.
[02:16:04.929 --> 02:16:12.494]  And all the doctors who've gone along with it, they're not consciously aiding and abetting, but they have to like fully commit to it because they know it's crazy deep down.
[02:16:13.917 --> 02:16:15.438]  I mean, it's just they're getting everybody ready.
[02:16:15.438 --> 02:16:17.099]  It's just like it's time to die.
[02:16:17.099 --> 02:16:18.760]  It's time to have fun.
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:22.563]  You know, increased death and early death now becomes normal.
[02:16:22.563 --> 02:16:25.985]  They normalize everything that they bring into the system.
[02:16:25.985 --> 02:16:33.170]  And, you know, right now it's not like having five people on your street dying all at once.
[02:16:33.170 --> 02:16:35.172]  But eventually I'll get to that step.
[02:16:35.172 --> 02:16:37.513]  And even then, people will say, what's going on?
[02:16:37.513 --> 02:16:39.935]  And they'll want to believe the doctor's excuses.
[02:16:39.935 --> 02:16:41.136]  And it's just one of them things.
[02:16:42.154 --> 02:16:43.877]  Yeah, that's delusion over reality.
[02:16:43.877 --> 02:16:46.099]  Oh, it's too scary, they're doing this to my kid.
[02:16:46.099 --> 02:16:47.621]  I'll just do it and hope everything's alright.
[02:16:58.055 --> 02:17:03.879]  And the doctor will give you the scientific explanation, of course, which is no explanation at all.
[02:17:03.879 --> 02:17:05.100]  It's just a cover.
[02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:06.141]  But you'll want to believe it.
[02:17:06.141 --> 02:17:06.701]  No, no, no.
[02:17:06.701 --> 02:17:09.603]  Doctors will still lie and say there's not mercury.
[02:17:09.603 --> 02:17:11.865]  And I've got my listeners who go, give me the insert.
[02:17:11.865 --> 02:17:13.386]  They go, here's the thimerosal.
[02:17:13.386 --> 02:17:16.228]  The doctor's like, oh, you got me.
[02:17:16.228 --> 02:17:19.090]  Because the mid-level folks get off on lying.
[02:17:19.090 --> 02:17:21.452]  It's like a power to deceive somebody.
[02:17:21.452 --> 02:17:22.572]  They enjoy it.
[02:17:23.793 --> 02:17:25.554]  And that's what they do.
[02:17:25.554 --> 02:17:31.897]  And actually, you understand, there's a psychology behind all this, even with the elites, how it affects them.
[02:17:31.897 --> 02:17:40.781]  Because as the public go along and adapt to all this stuff, they adapt to massive autism, diabetes, all the cancers, juvenile arthritis... And they always create a gimmick.
[02:17:40.781 --> 02:17:47.164]  We'll have a race for breast cancer, to find a cure, not to find out why it's up by several thousand percent.
[02:17:47.164 --> 02:17:51.686]  And they'll make it fun, like, the kids are all getting cancer, but they get a cancer Barbie.
[02:17:51.686 --> 02:17:52.367]  Put it back up.
[02:17:53.687 --> 02:17:59.829]  50 years ago they would put medical students on aircraft or trains to fly at hundreds a day to come see a child with cancer.
[02:18:13.394 --> 02:18:18.437]  But now we've been given the gift, and people are like, what's wrong with the cancer, Bobby, for kids with cancer?
[02:18:18.437 --> 02:18:21.939]  No, I'm saying, let's find out why they're all getting cancer.
[02:18:21.939 --> 02:18:23.280]  Oh, I happen to know!
[02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:25.921]  The people running things are murdering our children!
[02:18:25.921 --> 02:18:28.963]  And people are like, well that's just too extreme.
[02:18:28.963 --> 02:18:31.204]  Yeah, I know, reality is extreme.
[02:18:31.204 --> 02:18:38.328]  Yes, and they've built these massive new hospitals in the States and in Canada, literally big factory blocks.
[02:18:38.328 --> 02:18:38.788]  Huge things.
[02:18:39.517 --> 02:18:42.700]  And to treat cancers and the dying.
[02:18:42.700 --> 02:18:44.241]  And of course, you offered euthanasia.
[02:18:44.241 --> 02:18:44.762]  Well, that's all.
[02:18:44.762 --> 02:18:46.703]  We've got our new economy now.
[02:18:46.703 --> 02:19:05.680]  Prisons, cancer wards, brain damage, diabetes, the fruits of New World Order, NAFTA, GATT, no jobs, giant crime waves, huge prisons, trudgeons, tasers, taser bracelets, children wearing tasers in school, death, murder, stinking war, millions of dead Iraqis, trendy.
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:07.121]  It's wonderful, Alan.
[02:19:07.481 --> 02:19:08.942]  Yeah, that's what they've done.
[02:19:08.942 --> 02:19:19.109]  And then again, it turns so much of what was government's job, you know, one time, over to private sectors, including in the health industries in Britain and elsewhere.
[02:19:20.035 --> 02:19:23.738]  And for profit, of course.
[02:19:23.738 --> 02:19:28.583]  So then the next debate comes and always it's costing too much to treat these people.
[02:19:28.583 --> 02:19:29.243]  Alan, stay there.
[02:19:29.243 --> 02:19:31.185]  We've got to keep you even longer now.
[02:19:31.185 --> 02:19:35.929]  I promise I'll get to Christopher, who's been holding for quite a spell.
[02:19:35.929 --> 02:19:40.913]  Skywalker, Judy, Jessica, who's been holding the longest?
[02:19:43.015 --> 02:19:46.277]  Christopher Skywalker, then Jessica, Richard, Judy.
[02:19:46.277 --> 02:19:47.277]  We're gonna get to all of you.
[02:19:47.277 --> 02:19:49.218]  Alan Watt, on with us now.
[02:19:49.218 --> 02:19:52.360]  And it sounds really horrible, but aren't you glad you know now?
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:53.020]  Aren't you glad?
[02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:55.442]  And then later I've got a special question for Alan Watt.
[02:19:56.525 --> 02:20:05.187]  I'd seen the Longevity products work for many others, and so I bought a bunch of them, started using them, had a little bit of results, but I wasn't following the regimen every day.
[02:20:05.187 --> 02:20:09.408]  But Aaron Dykes in my office did, and lost more than 60 pounds.
[02:20:09.408 --> 02:20:13.129]  When I saw those results, I said, I better follow my own advice.
[02:20:13.129 --> 02:20:16.610]  I started taking the Longevity products, and it's been incredible.
[02:20:16.610 --> 02:20:19.230]  37 pounds in two months.
[02:20:19.230 --> 02:20:22.471]  Our bodies are amazing, and God gave us an incredible gift.
[02:20:22.711 --> 02:20:31.578]  But if our body doesn't have the tools it needs, all of the vitamins, all of the minerals, and the other key essential trace elements, we're not going to be healthy.
[02:20:31.578 --> 02:20:32.799]  Folks, this isn't hype.
[02:20:32.799 --> 02:20:37.043]  I only bring to my listeners products that I've tried myself and I truly believe in.
[02:20:37.043 --> 02:20:43.128]  And the amazing supplements available at infowarsteam.com have certainly delivered in my life.

[02:21:24.828 --> 02:21:33.232]  Yes, for only $34.95 fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked and all your possessions gone.
[02:21:33.232 --> 02:21:38.094]  Fake TV simulates the light from a real TV and can be programmed just like a lamp on a timer.

[02:24:03.771 --> 02:24:10.757]  What they want us to do is
[02:24:11.912 --> 02:24:23.340]  All right, this segment, a little bit of the next, I'll jam in five of your calls or so for all I want.
[02:24:23.340 --> 02:24:34.047]  Then I want to get into Ted Nugent and his video that the establishment globalists are freaking out about, where he talks about Obama being a criminal, which he is a criminal, but Mitt Romney is going to save us.
[02:24:35.114 --> 02:24:37.055]  And this is part of the mind game people play.
[02:24:37.055 --> 02:24:39.336]  So I'm going to talk about that coming up.
[02:24:39.336 --> 02:24:42.138]  Christopher in Missouri, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[02:24:42.138 --> 02:24:47.540]  Go ahead.
[02:24:47.540 --> 02:24:50.281]  Christopher, going once, going twice, gone.
[02:24:50.281 --> 02:24:51.602]  Okay, Christopher.
[02:24:51.602 --> 02:24:53.923]  Let's go ahead and go to Skywalker in California.
[02:24:53.923 --> 02:24:55.904]  You're on the air.
[02:24:55.904 --> 02:24:56.525]  Yeah.
[02:24:56.525 --> 02:24:59.966]  Hi, I'm just going to talk about the situation that happened on Thursday.
[02:24:59.966 --> 02:25:01.367]  I live in Modesto, California.
[02:25:01.852 --> 02:25:02.052]  I don't
[02:25:19.834 --> 02:25:25.476]  Yeah, I saw that report.
[02:25:25.476 --> 02:25:32.558]  And as they go to take farms, ranches, the cops reportedly just burned it down.
[02:25:32.558 --> 02:25:34.459]  The new thing is they're going to burn you out.
[02:25:34.459 --> 02:25:38.280]  But people aren't going to just be waiting to be burned out in the future.
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:43.522]  There's a lot of evidence they murdered this guy up in Georgia, burned his house down with him in it.
[02:25:43.522 --> 02:25:47.864]  And we got there and the police said, you're not allowed to film the city hall, you're not allowed to enter.
[02:25:48.524 --> 02:25:50.724]  This is not America, is basically what they told us.
[02:25:50.724 --> 02:25:52.605]  I played that yesterday.
[02:25:52.605 --> 02:25:56.026]  Alan Watt, we're going to see more and more of this, aren't we?
[02:25:56.026 --> 02:25:56.546]  Definitely.
[02:25:56.546 --> 02:25:58.466]  Again, go back to the old videos.
[02:25:58.466 --> 02:26:06.548]  There's plenty out there on the net to do with the Soviet system in the Ukraine and in Russia, where they sent armies after farmers.
[02:26:06.548 --> 02:26:08.628]  And not all of them caved in.
[02:26:08.628 --> 02:26:17.590]  Lots of them went down with their houses and you see them firing back at the troops and so on as they try to take off the only little bit of property they had and the livelihood away from them.
[02:26:18.430 --> 02:26:20.953]  This is obviously, again, it's a global agenda.
[02:26:20.953 --> 02:26:22.654]  It's not happening just in one country.
[02:26:22.654 --> 02:26:33.723]  But perhaps America is happening across the world at the same time because they're standardizing the culture of the world and the system of the world for global government, you see.
[02:26:33.723 --> 02:26:34.584]  Well said.
[02:26:34.584 --> 02:26:35.264]  Anything else?
[02:26:35.264 --> 02:26:36.986]  Skywalker?
[02:26:36.986 --> 02:26:37.366]  One more.
[02:26:37.366 --> 02:26:40.829]  I think it's surprising to see that my neighborhood happening in front of my eyes.
[02:26:40.829 --> 02:26:46.914]  But yesterday, the two neighboring towns, two people were killed by two different officers on two different incidents.
[02:26:47.657 --> 02:26:55.682]  One was a report for a family dispute, but it turned into the officer had to shoot him, and they ended up dying.
[02:26:55.682 --> 02:27:12.592]  What's going to happen is the public's degenerating, the police are degenerating and stressed out, and there's 5 million guns or more being sold a month, and the police are going to start getting scared, and they're going to start killing people, and so the public's going to start just shooting when they see police, which is a bad idea.
[02:27:13.212 --> 02:27:14.252]  And that's what they want.
[02:27:14.252 --> 02:27:16.033]  The globalists want a civil war.
[02:27:16.033 --> 02:27:17.474]  Thank you, Skywalker.
[02:27:17.474 --> 02:27:19.074]  Do you agree with my statement on that?
[02:27:19.074 --> 02:27:22.895]  That the globalists don't care if the military and police get chewed up.
[02:27:22.895 --> 02:27:26.137]  They want to have a civil war in North America.
[02:27:26.137 --> 02:27:27.037]  I'd say so.
[02:27:27.037 --> 02:27:36.820]  In order to justify with overwhelming force, in a pre-planned agenda of how to tackle it all, to buckle what's left really down into obedience.
[02:27:36.820 --> 02:27:38.561]  And SPP says that, as you know.
[02:27:38.561 --> 02:27:41.782]  The North American Union documents we got, they admit that.
[02:27:43.172 --> 02:27:45.453]  And also, too, the police are not the same police.
[02:27:45.453 --> 02:27:50.116]  They've been trained to be paranoid of the public for years now, but they've also been given permission.
[02:27:50.116 --> 02:27:57.079]  It's a tacit admission and permission to simply taser the people to death or shoot them, kill them.
[02:27:57.079 --> 02:27:58.360]  The inquiries go nowhere.
[02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:02.542]  Eventually, they'll just do away with inquiries altogether.
[02:28:02.542 --> 02:28:04.803]  That's where it's going.
[02:28:04.803 --> 02:28:05.864]  Well said, Alan.
[02:28:05.864 --> 02:28:08.585]  Let's now go to Jessica in Texas.
[02:28:08.585 --> 02:28:09.966]  Jessica, you're on the air.
[02:28:09.966 --> 02:28:10.286]  Welcome.
[02:28:11.550 --> 02:28:20.454]  Hi Alex, I'm wondering what you think is the realistic level of complicity by the media, politicians, and Hollywood in bringing in the New World Order.
[02:28:20.454 --> 02:28:23.196]  Do you think that they're aware of what they're helping to create?
[02:28:23.196 --> 02:28:37.243]  I just talked to a national media figure today who was actually brought into the meeting and given the speech I was given years ago that sell out you'll get all this power and of course he's all freaked out about it but the point is that
[02:28:38.303 --> 02:28:42.424]  Low-level media just regurgitates the national media.
[02:28:42.424 --> 02:28:48.305]  At a local TV station, you get national packages and then just read your voice so it looks like it's local.
[02:28:48.305 --> 02:28:49.805]  Or you stand there and read it.
[02:28:49.805 --> 02:28:52.305]  So it's talking points.
[02:28:52.305 --> 02:29:00.907]  Most people are just thinking about how they want to go home and get drunk, or go home and see their girlfriend, or go to the park and, you know, play frisbee golf.
[02:29:00.907 --> 02:29:03.027]  So it's a selfishness.
[02:29:03.027 --> 02:29:06.628]  I'd say, what, 95% of people that work for the system don't know it, Alan?
[02:29:08.942 --> 02:29:11.563]  A lot of them do know it as well.
[02:29:11.563 --> 02:29:14.284]  She made a good point about Hollywood.
[02:29:14.284 --> 02:29:16.305]  Hollywood is an essential arm.
[02:29:16.305 --> 02:29:19.406]  It's the essential arm for the culture industry.
[02:29:19.406 --> 02:29:21.146]  Stay there, and I want her to stay there too.
[02:29:21.146 --> 02:29:25.207]  Jessica, we're going to come back and have a follow-up and let Alan comment on that riveting information.
[02:29:25.207 --> 02:29:27.088]  I'm talking about locals, 95%.
[02:29:27.088 --> 02:29:28.048]  Oh, yeah.
[02:29:28.048 --> 02:29:36.051]  If you get into manager levels of Hollywood, national TV and stuff, these people are smart enough to know what's going on and to follow orders.
[02:29:36.051 --> 02:29:37.091]  And they get off on it.
[02:29:37.671 --> 02:29:40.075]  So yeah, I agree with that statement.
[02:29:40.075 --> 02:29:41.237]  So just enjoy then.
[02:29:41.237 --> 02:29:42.619]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:42.619 --> 02:29:45.683]  Stay with us.
[02:29:45.683 --> 02:29:47.065]  We're on the march.
[02:29:47.065 --> 02:29:49.609]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:49.609 --> 02:29:52.273]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:57.455 --> 02:29:59.177]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:29:59.177 --> 02:30:04.483]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:30:04.483 --> 02:30:06.025]  Saving means to make money.

[02:30:23.081 --> 02:30:31.066]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:30:31.066 --> 02:30:36.309]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:31:52.971 --> 02:32:03.236]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good sized meal, I was still starving.
[02:32:03.236 --> 02:32:05.517]  And my research led me to a well-known fact.
[02:32:05.777 --> 02:32:21.102]  That most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:32:21.102 --> 02:32:27.284]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Youngevity.
[02:32:27.284 --> 02:32:35.087]  The Youngevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:32:35.427 --> 02:32:41.749]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:32:41.749 --> 02:32:43.029]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:32:43.029 --> 02:32:43.909]  It's incredible.
[02:32:43.909 --> 02:32:53.111]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[02:32:53.111 --> 02:32:55.292]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:33:05.024 --> 02:33:21.691]  I was just looking at InfoWars.com and one of the top stories there in the tiles.
[02:33:21.691 --> 02:33:26.032]  Jon Stewart exposes the fraud of the Federal Reserve.
[02:33:26.032 --> 02:33:30.534]  Jon Stewart's brother is the head of the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:33:30.534 --> 02:33:32.095]  Jon Stewart's a fake stage name.
[02:33:34.025 --> 02:33:35.126]  And you talk about victory.
[02:33:35.126 --> 02:33:42.629]  The fact that 15 years ago, I would have national media call me and say, you are insane.
[02:33:42.629 --> 02:33:45.710]  The Federal Reserve is not private.
[02:33:45.710 --> 02:33:48.431]  And it's racist to say it is.
[02:33:48.431 --> 02:33:49.012]  I'm racist.
[02:33:49.012 --> 02:33:50.452]  You know, they would inject that.
[02:33:50.452 --> 02:33:51.673]  Don't like government health care?
[02:33:51.673 --> 02:33:54.934]  You're racist.
[02:33:54.934 --> 02:33:58.656]  They just throw that in there.
[02:33:58.656 --> 02:33:59.516]  Doesn't make any sense.
[02:33:59.516 --> 02:34:00.697]  It's non sequitur.
[02:34:00.697 --> 02:34:01.097]  They do it.
[02:34:03.007 --> 02:34:07.608]  And now all these years later, over 90% of major polls know the Federal Reserve is private.
[02:34:07.608 --> 02:34:12.929]  So now Jon Stewart can expose it to his idiot viewers.
[02:34:12.929 --> 02:34:14.850]  Of course, they'll just change the name.
[02:34:14.850 --> 02:34:22.892]  I predict when the charter comes up next year, in 2013, that they're going to change the name of it.
[02:34:22.892 --> 02:34:27.333]  They're going to reincorporate the same owner's new name.
[02:34:27.333 --> 02:34:28.193]  At least they're going to try it.
[02:34:31.687 --> 02:34:34.829]  Now going back to Alan Watt and Jessica in Texas.
[02:34:34.829 --> 02:34:38.331]  Alan, you were cut off by the break getting into Hollywood.
[02:34:38.331 --> 02:34:41.113]  And how many people in the media system know what they're doing?
[02:34:41.113 --> 02:34:42.173]  Go ahead.
[02:34:42.173 --> 02:34:47.837]  Well, I've got a list up of the CFR members from their own websites in the U.S.
[02:34:48.829 --> 02:34:57.093]  And anybody who's any kind of reporter at all across the whole country and the world is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:34:57.093 --> 02:34:58.193]  You can't join it.
[02:34:58.193 --> 02:35:02.575]  You have to be asked to join after you've been vetted for your opinions on things.
[02:35:02.575 --> 02:35:04.176]  Will you go along with this agenda?
[02:35:04.176 --> 02:35:05.696]  Yep, that's it.
[02:35:05.696 --> 02:35:13.420]  And getting back to Hollywood, though, Hollywood, it's almost like an invasion into the US.
[02:35:13.420 --> 02:35:18.242]  People don't even know how it started from the European guilds that came over.
[02:35:19.228 --> 02:35:21.730]  Especially when Hitler was coming in.
[02:35:21.730 --> 02:35:27.815]  And they started pushing their communist ideals through movies right away.
[02:35:27.815 --> 02:35:29.956]  Again, destruction of the family unit, affairs.
[02:35:29.956 --> 02:35:31.357]  Everybody had affairs in the movies.
[02:35:31.357 --> 02:35:33.899]  Made it exciting.
[02:35:33.899 --> 02:35:41.425]  And the same techniques were used until, of course, they had the anti-American hearings, of course.
[02:35:41.425 --> 02:35:42.365]  And even the top
[02:35:44.107 --> 02:35:45.648]  Yeah, just pro-war, so they shifted.
[02:35:45.648 --> 02:35:45.988]  And again,
[02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:22.848]  Folks in Hollywood have admitted that they saw it as revolutionaries to destroy Christianity and destroy the family ethic to render us down to be weak, servile minions.
[02:36:22.848 --> 02:36:23.348]  That's right.
[02:36:23.348 --> 02:36:31.474]  And also, Sarah Sarandon came on television at one of the big meetings, big, big award things for actors and producers.
[02:36:31.474 --> 02:36:35.297]  She was on live television, along with Michael Moore, of course.
[02:36:35.297 --> 02:36:37.499]  And she said, we are the culture creators.
[02:36:38.371 --> 02:36:41.333]  So, see, that's how they reflect themselves in the industry.
[02:36:41.333 --> 02:36:43.095]  They don't follow culture.
[02:36:43.095 --> 02:36:44.896]  They create the next part of culture.
[02:36:44.896 --> 02:36:45.997]  They update you, you see?
[02:36:46.747 --> 02:36:49.748]  And by the way, I have at the highest levels, take Jesse Ventura's TV show,
[02:37:13.359 --> 02:37:20.985]  When we actually got shows on about FEMA camps and the takeover plans, Homeland Security threatened people.
[02:37:20.985 --> 02:37:27.030]  Once you're part of something, and as a journalist you promise not to reveal things, I can't go into all of it, but it was...
[02:37:28.271 --> 02:37:39.017]  Stuff being broken into, threats, not just congressmen calling, and they took that show off the air, and then now basically, I'm not even going to get into it, people are like, where's the third season?
[02:37:39.017 --> 02:37:42.779]  Well, the point is that it's real.
[02:37:42.779 --> 02:37:44.940]  And I just talked to another national media figure.
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:47.421]  Earlier who said oh my god.
[02:37:47.421 --> 02:38:08.394]  It's all real And I know all the behind-the-scenes stuff and of course he's like in confidence You know I'm gonna tell you this now because this was in confidence, and it's so real it's so Real it's so real people say well if you were in media meetings over the years and and people offered you jobs and admitted the new world order was real and
[02:38:09.417 --> 02:38:10.318]  Why don't you expose them?
[02:38:33.448 --> 02:38:36.871]  I'm just telling them that when I'm talking to fade the color down because there's a buzz on the line.
[02:38:36.871 --> 02:38:53.547]  The point is that that when you're sitting there talking to people and it's like, well, yeah, there's got to be a global government to help people and we've got to, you know, get rid of this system to bring it in and we're going to help others and it needs to be managed.
[02:38:53.547 --> 02:38:55.929]  And yeah, it's real, but the public doesn't want freedom.
[02:38:56.329 --> 02:38:59.491]  The fact that you're to the point you've gotten means you're one of us.
[02:38:59.491 --> 02:39:00.511]  You're successful.
[02:39:00.511 --> 02:39:02.072]  Join the team.
[02:39:02.072 --> 02:39:10.457]  It's almost like they live when they get into the underground complex and they see the guy they thought was just a bum but was really a spy working with the off-worlders.
[02:39:10.457 --> 02:39:12.758]  And he's like, hey guys, good to know you made it.
[02:39:12.758 --> 02:39:15.299]  Gotta get yourself some fancier duds.
[02:39:15.299 --> 02:39:17.801]  Now that you've joined the team, let's go on in.
[02:39:17.801 --> 02:39:21.323]  And he's like, incredible technology, isn't it boys?
[02:39:21.323 --> 02:39:23.324]  It's good to be on the winning team, isn't it?
[02:39:23.964 --> 02:39:25.205]  You know you want it!
[02:39:25.205 --> 02:39:27.767]  You know you wanted to join the team, boy!
[02:39:27.767 --> 02:39:29.408]  I'm sorry, go ahead, Alan.
[02:39:29.408 --> 02:39:31.210]  Well, that's exactly how it is.
[02:39:31.210 --> 02:39:35.873]  And so self-interest and ego is pampered, too.
[02:39:35.873 --> 02:39:41.458]  And most people take the baits and go with it and think, OK, I don't belong to the masses anymore.
[02:39:41.458 --> 02:39:43.279]  I belong to a better group.
[02:39:43.279 --> 02:39:45.941]  And that's how they literally see it and talk about it amongst themselves.
[02:39:46.872 --> 02:39:53.076]  Have you had them come to you and say, Alan, you're really smart, you really know what's going on, join us, because that's the speech everybody gets.
[02:40:10.683 --> 02:40:14.404]  Who've asked me to come to their own table societies for a global citizenship committee.
[02:40:14.404 --> 02:40:17.565]  I have too, I've been invited to the UN, everything, yeah.
[02:40:17.565 --> 02:40:23.326]  And of course, I won't take the bait because, and I know too, if I did, I'd be sitting on easy seats.
[02:40:23.326 --> 02:40:28.848]  No, you get there and there's like a gorgeous woman who's going to be with you for the weekend and all these business opportunities.
[02:40:28.848 --> 02:40:32.048]  It'd be like, people are like, oh, that sounds great, sell out, sell out.
[02:40:32.048 --> 02:40:34.149]  No, it is a heartless, soulless system.
[02:40:34.149 --> 02:40:34.649]  I will not.
[02:40:35.029 --> 02:40:45.999]  Yeah, and then they even offer to you, they'll do all the, you don't have to write your own books, they'll, ghostwriters will just turn out books for you, one after another, you know, and so, because you're useful.
[02:40:45.999 --> 02:40:48.061]  Once you're a public figure, you see they can use you.
[02:40:48.061 --> 02:40:54.727]  No, they told me you'll be a big national talk show host who's young, like Limbaugh, you'll be on TV.
[02:40:54.727 --> 02:40:59.111]  I was described Glenn Beck's job before he even had a political show.
[02:40:59.111 --> 02:41:01.032]  Three separate times by different groups.
[02:41:02.119 --> 02:41:04.541]  I mean, they were looking for the new Glenn Beck.
[02:41:04.541 --> 02:41:07.522]  Well, yeah, and it's in the Council on Foreign Relations' own reports.
[02:41:07.522 --> 02:41:22.792]  I have them here, where a few years ago, I kept them all, where they said that they'd have to take on board more celebrity figures in the culture, actors, even talk show hosts, and bring them on board because the public will follow them like sheep, you see.
[02:41:22.792 --> 02:41:23.632]  And they did.
[02:41:23.632 --> 02:41:31.217]  They recruited quite a few from Hollywood now to lead their fans along this new way of thinking of globalism, internationalism.
[02:41:33.588 --> 02:41:48.721]  And notice they take people like Charlie Rose, and he's got ABC shows, he's got PBS shows, and he's one of the few journalists allowed into Bilderberg.
[02:41:48.721 --> 02:41:49.943]  Let's go back to Jessica.
[02:41:49.943 --> 02:41:51.184]  Jessica, does that answer your question?
[02:41:52.116 --> 02:42:09.319]  Yes it does and I'd also just like to say that I notice how you often make reference to historical events and I think that's really important in giving people context for what's going on now and I was hoping that you would consider having a contest for writers in addition to your contest for reporters so that people like me have a
[02:42:09.941 --> 02:42:11.101]  We're good to go.
[02:42:34.261 --> 02:42:46.049]  Sometimes sites that want us to post their stuff later say don't post it, and I watch their Alexa rating drop, you know, because they think that, you know, being on our site actually takes traffic when it actually gives them traffic.
[02:42:46.049 --> 02:42:48.570]  But all we care about is getting the info out.
[02:42:48.570 --> 02:42:50.371]  So if you'd like to write stories for us, go ahead.
[02:42:50.371 --> 02:42:53.153]  But an on-staff writer job would be good.
[02:42:53.153 --> 02:42:56.335]  We just have the limited capital in the final equation.
[02:42:56.335 --> 02:43:01.439]  If I can, you know, pay my people a living wage and try to give them bonuses so they can be comfortable in their work,
[02:43:02.139 --> 02:43:04.581]  I can't hire that many more people, but we're working on it.
[02:43:04.581 --> 02:43:06.302]  Thank you so much.
[02:43:06.302 --> 02:43:08.564]  Let's jam in some other calls now, quickly.
[02:43:08.564 --> 02:43:10.105]  Judy in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:43:10.105 --> 02:43:12.126]  Go ahead.
[02:43:12.126 --> 02:43:15.188]  Hey, this is a dream phone call for me.
[02:43:15.188 --> 02:43:21.573]  I've actually spoken with both of you gentlemen, and it's an honor to speak with you now.
[02:43:21.573 --> 02:43:22.654]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:43:22.654 --> 02:43:23.054]  Yes, we can.
[02:43:24.278 --> 02:43:26.160]  Good.
[02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:42.973]  What I've been thinking while I've been listening to you and just what I consider a lot is that we're in a time right now where I think there's going to probably be, probably fairly soon, some type of false flag.
[02:43:42.973 --> 02:43:44.274]  And I hope I'm wrong.
[02:43:44.915 --> 02:43:49.019]  But it seems as though there's two paths.
[02:43:49.019 --> 02:44:00.670]  See, the acceleration is occurring because, as I've heard Alan say, the globalists are right on course, or they could be just as fearful as they're trying to make us.
[02:44:00.670 --> 02:44:08.918]  And I was wondering what your thoughts are, both of you, on whether or not, if there was a day
[02:44:10.006 --> 02:44:20.380]  When everyone, including those with means, those in Hollywood that have consciences, people, I mean, there's organizations that I work with.
[02:44:20.380 --> 02:44:24.306]  Sure, a day that we do what?
[02:44:24.306 --> 02:44:26.589]  In order to, internationally,
[02:44:27.350 --> 02:44:29.071]  Sure, sure, here's the deal.
[02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:47.901]  Like shark teeth, and I appreciate your call, another row of teeth will roll up.
[02:44:47.901 --> 02:44:52.783]  You've got to expose the entire false system or they'll just replace it with new puppets.
[02:44:52.783 --> 02:44:55.764]  You've got to have a full awakening.
[02:44:55.764 --> 02:45:03.366]  And Brzezinski did say a few years ago that humanity's waking up politically for the first time in history to the man behind the throne.
[02:45:03.366 --> 02:45:09.608]  And in that is the victory in realizing you're in a manipulated scientific dictatorship.
[02:45:09.608 --> 02:45:10.228]  In that
[02:45:12.263 --> 02:45:20.346]  I'm not saying it's a bad idea just to go have a day, but we need, like, not an anti-corporate day or an anti-whatever day, an anti-scientific dictatorship day.
[02:45:20.346 --> 02:45:22.227]  Alan?
[02:45:22.227 --> 02:45:31.810]  You do, but you also have to also write about and get into how many non-governmental organizations are attached to every government across the world.
[02:45:31.810 --> 02:45:34.191]  They're the same ones, by the way, by the same foundations.
[02:45:35.071 --> 02:45:38.217]  Who helped make policy for governments to run.
[02:45:38.217 --> 02:45:42.324]  Remember, divide and conquer was the initial way of the communist system.
[02:45:42.324 --> 02:45:46.813]  Under different names, the same system, same guys, same people, pushing the same stuff.
[02:45:47.529 --> 02:45:51.130]  And they've got so much divisiveness in society now.
[02:45:51.130 --> 02:45:53.970]  Rights of the child means there's no rights of the parents.
[02:45:53.970 --> 02:45:58.151]  They've got men and women as a couple almost eliminated.
[02:45:58.151 --> 02:46:00.191]  Yeah, you want to defeat the New World Order?
[02:46:00.191 --> 02:46:01.892]  Get families back.
[02:46:01.892 --> 02:46:03.112]  Get humanity back.
[02:46:03.112 --> 02:46:04.852]  That's how you defeat the New World Order.
[02:46:04.852 --> 02:46:06.352]  ...literally wipe out.
[02:46:06.352 --> 02:46:07.713]  I mean, I mean, get rid of.
[02:46:07.713 --> 02:46:09.273]  Let's expel them all.
[02:46:09.273 --> 02:46:15.554]  All these governmental organizations that now are appointees to governments across the world are the same ones.
[02:46:16.689 --> 02:46:19.255]  And the ones that caused the divisiveness, etc.
[02:46:19.255 --> 02:46:20.057]  etc.
[02:46:20.057 --> 02:46:24.809]  and who know the agenda and know their part in it and who get legislation on the books.
[02:46:24.809 --> 02:46:25.611]  You don't elect them in.
[02:46:26.613 --> 02:46:28.114]  And therefore they shouldn't be there at all.
[02:46:28.114 --> 02:46:28.595]  You're right.
[02:46:28.595 --> 02:46:32.818]  The unelected boards, the NGOs, the shadow government, kick it out!
[02:46:32.818 --> 02:46:37.161]  Identify the shadow government, the parasited legitimate system, kick it out!
[02:46:37.161 --> 02:46:39.383]  Get rid of the Federal Reserve, get rid of it all.
[02:46:39.383 --> 02:46:40.844]  Great points.
[02:46:40.844 --> 02:46:41.825]  Richard in Canada.
[02:46:41.825 --> 02:46:42.666]  Richard, you're on the air.
[02:46:42.666 --> 02:46:43.786]  Go ahead.
[02:46:43.786 --> 02:46:45.528]  Yeah, hi guys.
[02:46:45.528 --> 02:46:52.053]  I just wanted to say, growing up in this little town I live in in Canada, the four main pedophiles
[02:46:52.708 --> 02:46:57.251]  One was a cop, not to put down police officers, because, you know, bad apple.
[02:46:57.251 --> 02:46:58.852]  One was a priest.
[02:46:58.852 --> 02:47:01.353]  One was a teacher.
[02:47:01.353 --> 02:47:07.317]  And the fourth one was a high-ranking member of the Mormon Church.
[02:47:07.317 --> 02:47:11.859]  And the other thing I want to point out is, now I'm 40 years old, and, you know, I've
[02:47:13.422 --> 02:47:19.328]  We tend to look at pedophiles as being an old man, but I'm of that generation now.
[02:47:19.328 --> 02:47:30.379]  I'm of that age group where, you know, look at Miley Cyrus and Billy Ray and the half-naked pictures of him on television and this sort of thing.
[02:47:32.512 --> 02:47:39.818]  Maybe I'm not making a lot of sense, but I'm seeing the demise of our society and the pedophilia thing.
[02:47:39.818 --> 02:47:41.179]  Look, it's just like Rome.
[02:47:41.179 --> 02:47:43.001]  It's just like the Aztecs.
[02:47:43.001 --> 02:47:45.923]  We are a society in deep, deep decadence.
[02:47:45.923 --> 02:47:47.024]  We understand, too.
[02:47:47.024 --> 02:47:49.206]  And it seems like it's organized.
[02:47:49.206 --> 02:47:49.606]  Sure, sure.
[02:47:49.606 --> 02:47:50.487]  Go ahead, Alan.
[02:47:50.487 --> 02:47:52.708]  Here's the kicker for this one.
[02:47:52.708 --> 02:47:55.651]  They want to do away with the name pedophilia altogether.
[02:47:55.651 --> 02:47:58.273]  The World Health Organization, the United Nations has said this.
[02:47:59.392 --> 02:48:02.596]  And the International Department of Censors at their meetings every year.
[02:48:02.596 --> 02:48:04.337]  NAMBLA is an NGO!
[02:48:04.337 --> 02:48:04.858]  Exactly!
[02:48:04.858 --> 02:48:05.879]  They love NAMBLA!
[02:48:05.879 --> 02:48:06.520]  They love it!
[02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:16.250]  Well, they actually say that they want to do a way, two professors said at the same time, same script actually, Canada and the States at the last censor meeting for television.
[02:48:16.950 --> 02:48:28.799]  They said now that we've won the rights for homosexuality, we must now go into removing pedophilia from the books and introducing animal human sex.
[02:48:28.799 --> 02:48:29.799]  Ambitionality!
[02:48:29.799 --> 02:48:35.243]  That was in one of the bills they passed, that the troops can have sex with animals on base, yeah.
[02:48:35.243 --> 02:48:38.405]  United Nations and professors at universities, etc.
[02:48:38.405 --> 02:48:43.229]  Because you understand, everything that they introduce this way causes an opposite reaction.
[02:48:43.849 --> 02:48:47.030]  There's chaos in different new areas now.
[02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:51.631]  And then the government steps in with even more authority, new bureaucracies to deal with all that.
[02:48:51.631 --> 02:48:54.051]  And before you know it... There's no family at all.
[02:48:54.051 --> 02:48:54.491]  Exactly.
[02:48:54.491 --> 02:48:57.552]  And before you know it, you're a pedophobe.
[02:48:57.552 --> 02:49:00.873]  You're a bad person because you don't want them grabbing your five-year-old.
[02:49:00.873 --> 02:49:02.133]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:49:02.133 --> 02:49:03.093]  So that's the whole thing.
[02:49:03.093 --> 02:49:06.794]  Government wants to run everybody's life from cradle to grave.
[02:49:07.734 --> 02:49:13.265]  And so the more chaos they can introduce by this legislation, the better for them.
[02:49:13.265 --> 02:49:16.732]  And now they've got to even... Someone sent me a disc.
[02:49:16.732 --> 02:49:19.558]  I don't watch television, so they sent me a disc from what's showing in Britain.
[02:49:20.649 --> 02:49:26.031]  And they're showing you 12-year, 13-year-old girls with guys in their 50s, 60s.
[02:49:26.031 --> 02:49:28.871]  And parties eating fetuses.
[02:49:28.871 --> 02:49:30.752]  Yes, that too.
[02:49:30.752 --> 02:49:36.394]  So you're being totally degraded and degenerated until you cannot take care of yourself or your own.
[02:49:36.394 --> 02:49:37.774]  That's the whole purpose of this.
[02:49:37.774 --> 02:49:38.754]  It's a war.
[02:49:38.754 --> 02:49:42.896]  And then just like in one of the old books, the Bible, is it Genesis?
[02:49:42.896 --> 02:49:46.637]  Where they're in Sodom and Gomorrah and the guys come to the door and bang on it and say, give us your kids.
[02:49:48.357 --> 02:49:49.658]  And your boys.
[02:49:49.658 --> 02:49:52.818]  I mean, it was really the boys that we're after.
[02:49:52.818 --> 02:49:55.399]  And of course, he offered his wife to them.
[02:49:55.399 --> 02:49:57.640]  They didn't want the wife.
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:49:58.280]  That's right.
[02:49:58.280 --> 02:49:59.200]  He's like, here's my wife.
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:00.721]  They're like, no, we want your little kids.
[02:50:00.721 --> 02:50:02.501]  They want to wreck the innocence.
[02:50:02.501 --> 02:50:11.284]  It's always the Legion vanguard of the New World Order for thousands of years is pot-bellied men coming for your children.
[02:50:11.284 --> 02:50:12.184]  And that's the TSA.
[02:50:13.126 --> 02:50:18.371]  I mean, this is a planet pedophile ruled by pedophiles with nuclear weapons.
[02:50:18.371 --> 02:50:19.032]  Yes.
[02:50:19.032 --> 02:50:25.258]  And as I say, it takes, strips all, they've already stripped almost all the rights of the parents away, if it's a parent at all.
[02:50:25.258 --> 02:50:34.206]  And of course, they're giving the rights to the child with the intention that the child can then make their own decision if they're going to have sex with this old geezer.
[02:50:34.206 --> 02:50:35.267]  I mean, that's really what it is.
[02:50:36.088 --> 02:50:38.069]  And they've actually used that already, that drug.
[02:50:38.069 --> 02:50:45.034]  Well, that's why they're saying they're going to inoculate kids and have abortions if the 10-year-old says they want it.
[02:50:45.034 --> 02:50:47.695]  Again, and they say it's their consent.
[02:50:47.695 --> 02:50:50.057]  And they say they're going to start killing children up to age 3.
[02:50:50.057 --> 02:50:51.498]  We haven't talked about that.
[02:50:51.498 --> 02:50:55.080]  Alan Watt, incredible, incredible having you on with us today.
[02:50:57.245 --> 02:50:58.306]  I had tried everything.
[02:50:58.306 --> 02:51:00.647]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[02:51:00.647 --> 02:51:03.769]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:51:03.769 --> 02:51:08.552]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:51:08.552 --> 02:51:14.876]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:51:15.356 --> 02:51:26.500]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:30.941]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:51:30.941 --> 02:51:37.144]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:51:37.144 --> 02:51:38.284]  Now that's results!
[02:51:38.684 --> 02:51:51.135]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[02:52:56.351 --> 02:52:59.734]  Love gardening, but don't love seeing your hard work destroyed by wildlife?
[02:52:59.734 --> 02:53:04.177]  Then use the number one most effective deer and rabbit repellent you can buy, PlantSkid.
[02:53:04.177 --> 02:53:10.282]  PlantSkid repellent protects gardens, trees, and landscaping by emitting an odor that browsing animals associate with predators.
[02:53:10.282 --> 02:53:13.085]  So animals avoid plants before they nibble, not after.
[02:53:13.085 --> 02:53:14.206]  PlantSkid is made in the U.S.
[02:53:14.206 --> 02:53:18.369]  from non-toxic, 100% organic, environment- and pet-friendly ingredients.
[02:53:18.369 --> 02:53:20.030]  Other repellents wash off in the rain.
[02:53:20.030 --> 02:53:21.031]  Not PlantSkid.
[02:53:21.031 --> 02:53:23.213]  It's guaranteed to outlast all other repellents.
[02:53:23.553 --> 02:53:30.576]  PlantSkid was the first animal repellent to be OMRI listed organic and now comes in liquid spray, powder concentrate, or easy to use granular.
[02:53:30.576 --> 02:53:32.037]  Just sprinkle around your garden.

[02:54:18.817 --> 02:54:21.938]  I want to thank Alan Watt of CutIntoTheMatrix.com for joining us.
[02:54:21.938 --> 02:54:25.960]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:29.541]  I'll be doing the news tonight with some breaking information.
[02:54:29.541 --> 02:54:35.844]  Has Watson gotten the article up yet at InfoWars.com about secret TSA agents on the streets of America?
[02:54:35.844 --> 02:54:42.447]  Of course, we'd already told you this years ago because it's not secret in the funding, but now Congress has admitted it.
[02:54:43.410 --> 02:54:48.392]  I don't know if that's up yet, because I know Watson is on the job.
[02:54:48.392 --> 02:54:49.933]  So look for that.
[02:54:49.933 --> 02:54:51.574]  Here is Ted Nugent.
[02:54:51.574 --> 02:54:58.357]  I'm going to try to bleep out where he says they're wiping the Constitution on their you-know-what.
[02:54:58.357 --> 02:54:59.877]  But everything he says is true.
[02:54:59.877 --> 02:55:01.758]  He says the administration are criminals.
[02:55:01.758 --> 02:55:03.459]  I admire his courage.
[02:55:03.459 --> 02:55:05.060]  It's in the Wall Street Journal.
[02:55:05.060 --> 02:55:08.661]  It's up on the Drudge Report, also on InfoWars.com.
[02:55:08.661 --> 02:55:10.122]  You want to watch it if you're a radio listener.
[02:55:11.132 --> 02:55:13.373]  But then he says Mitt Romney is going to save us.
[02:55:13.373 --> 02:55:20.856]  Mitt Romney was bought and paid for by the same banks, carbon taxes, gun control, open borders, rote healthcare.
[02:55:20.856 --> 02:55:23.818]  I hear callers going, I want Obama out because of healthcare.
[02:55:25.054 --> 02:55:28.417]  I would love to believe Mitt Romney was gonna fix things.
[02:55:28.417 --> 02:55:34.943]  And I guess he might be better than Obama, but the same elite is behind him.
[02:55:34.943 --> 02:55:36.724]  It's who backs them.
[02:55:36.724 --> 02:55:39.526]  And the fruit of him being governor and everything.
[02:55:39.526 --> 02:55:43.510]  All these horrible droppings he leaves.
[02:55:43.510 --> 02:55:45.271]  Let's go to Ted Nugent.
[02:55:45.271 --> 02:55:49.975]  Here it is.
[02:55:49.975 --> 02:55:51.697]  And if you can't get
[02:55:54.560 --> 02:55:56.821]  A couple of hundred people each.
[02:55:56.821 --> 02:55:57.721]  Each of you.
[02:55:57.721 --> 02:55:59.962]  Some of you, I bet you can get a couple thousand.
[02:55:59.962 --> 02:56:09.226]  Your goal should be to get a couple of thousand people, per person who's here, to vote for Mitt Romney in November.
[02:56:09.226 --> 02:56:17.730]  If you don't know that our government is wiping its ass with the Constitution, you're living under a rock someplace.
[02:56:17.730 --> 02:56:21.372]  And if there's a dead soldier, an airman, a marine, a seaman,
[02:56:22.628 --> 02:56:27.115]  We've got a hero of the military that just got his legs blown off for the U.S.
[02:56:27.115 --> 02:56:32.244]  Constitution, and we've got a president and attorney general who doesn't even like the Constitution.
[02:56:32.244 --> 02:56:35.028]  We've got four Supreme Court justices
[02:56:36.496 --> 02:56:38.317]  Who don't believe in the Constitution.
[02:56:38.317 --> 02:56:56.322]  Does everybody know here that four of the Supreme Court justices not only determined you don't have the right to keep and bear arms, four Supreme Court justices signed their name to a declaration that Americans have no fundamental right to self-defense.
[02:56:56.322 --> 02:56:58.923]  That sounds like a stoned hippie.
[02:56:58.923 --> 02:57:01.704]  That doesn't sound like a Supreme Court anything.
[02:57:01.704 --> 02:57:05.785]  It sounds like a supremely intellectually vacuous punk.
[02:57:07.148 --> 02:57:19.913]  To think that a human could think that humans don't have a basic right to self-defense is so bizarre to me, as to my brain can't accept the information.
[02:57:19.913 --> 02:57:24.935]  And if you want more of those kinds of evil, anti-American people in the Supreme Court,
[02:57:25.742 --> 02:57:28.403]  But then don't get involved and let Obama take office again.
[02:57:28.403 --> 02:57:38.525]  Because I'll tell you this right now, if Barack Obama becomes the President in November, again, I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year.
[02:57:38.525 --> 02:57:47.407]  Being at the NRA event, God bless you, good indicator, but if you can't go home and get everybody into your lives,
[02:57:48.789 --> 02:57:53.832]  To clean house in this vile, evil, America-hating administration.
[02:57:53.832 --> 02:57:55.793]  I don't even know what you're made out of.
[02:57:55.793 --> 02:58:04.258]  If you can't galvanize and promote and recruit people to vote for Mitt Romney, we're done.
[02:58:04.258 --> 02:58:08.741]  We'll be a suburb of Indonesia next year.
[02:58:08.741 --> 02:58:15.585]  Our President and Attorney General, our Vice President Hillary Clinton, they're criminals.
[02:58:15.585 --> 02:58:16.206]  They're criminals.
[02:58:17.208 --> 02:58:19.370]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:58:19.370 --> 02:58:21.712]  Yeah, but so was George Bush in those wars.
[02:58:21.712 --> 02:58:24.074]  They're not getting their legs blown off for freedom.
[02:58:24.074 --> 02:58:27.677]  They're getting them blown off for opium and world government.
[02:58:27.677 --> 02:58:28.938]  And that's my point.
[02:58:28.938 --> 02:58:32.942]  How can you recognize tyranny under Obama, but not under Bush?
[02:58:32.942 --> 02:58:34.463]  That's the point!
[02:58:34.463 --> 02:58:38.166]  That's the problem!
[02:58:38.166 --> 02:58:38.927]  Ted Nugent!
[02:58:38.927 --> 02:58:39.207]  Come on!
[02:58:39.207 --> 02:58:39.988]  Come all the way!
