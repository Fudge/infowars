[00:00.000 --> 00:18.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:18.240 --> 00:28.160]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones it's the
[00:28.160 --> 00:33.840]  broadcast that globalist and the entire corporate combine on a planetary scale
[00:33.840 --> 00:41.080]  have been working in public and behind the scenes to destroy but in defiance of
[00:41.080 --> 00:45.000]  their tyranny and thanks to your prayers and support many ways were
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.320]  stronger than we've ever been but in other ways we're on our last legs it was
[00:51.320 --> 00:57.640]  the best of times it was the worst of times and we're just a microcosm of the
[00:57.640 --> 01:04.160]  larger universe what's happening the news is so incredibly important today that
[01:04.160 --> 01:09.080]  I absolutely I'm going to put myself into the calm mode that I'm able to do
[01:09.080 --> 01:14.920]  but seldom able to take carry out on air because there's just so much news and
[01:14.920 --> 01:22.800]  so much information but let me just calmly lay out that if you go even to
[01:22.800 --> 01:27.480]  mainstream statements by the current head of the DHS and the former head of
[01:27.480 --> 01:32.520]  the DHS J. Johnson and what's happening and what our reporters have
[01:32.520 --> 01:36.720]  videotaped and witnessed and what's happening across the United States and
[01:36.720 --> 01:43.920]  what's being organized the UN funded by elements of our own government and stay
[01:43.920 --> 01:48.840]  behind groups put in power by Hillary and Obama help collapse Europe with the
[01:48.840 --> 01:53.920]  help of the EU with over 10 million military aged men the last seven years
[01:53.920 --> 02:00.000]  toward Europe is just wrecked 80 plus percent less terrorism crime rates off
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.040]  the charts just just bedlam thousands of cars burned per week hundreds per
[02:06.040 --> 02:18.520]  night mass stabbings sex slavery the third world many areas is hell and we're
[02:18.520 --> 02:25.240]  in an existential threat crisis here and just as they ran the same operation
[02:25.240 --> 02:29.800]  with North African and Middle Easterners and others against Europe in the last
[02:29.800 --> 02:34.720]  seven eight years the exact same people are running an attempt with not one but
[02:34.720 --> 02:40.680]  two caravans of over 40,000 now the government saying 40,000 they were
[02:40.680 --> 02:47.240]  saying that was a thousand before and it was 50,000 so I don't know but they're
[02:47.240 --> 02:51.200]  always a lot bigger than they say and there's caravans arriving every day of
[02:51.200 --> 02:57.920]  a hundred two hundred five hundred a thousand and Beto O'Rourke is there as a
[02:57.920 --> 03:02.880]  literal treasonous traitor organizing it and bragging what it's happening people
[03:02.880 --> 03:06.200]  are coming across not being tested for diseases they've been caught smuggling
[03:06.200 --> 03:15.080]  children in mass this is insanity total insanity but it's designed to bring the
[03:15.080 --> 03:18.640]  country down and you've got that backdrop with the deep state trying to
[03:18.640 --> 03:24.280]  overthrow Trump all Trump is doing is the basic default that anybody would do
[03:24.280 --> 03:27.720]  to keep the country from collapsing but it's not enough because the attacks been
[03:27.720 --> 03:35.920]  launched and Trump can't get the laws of the funding to stop it and once they
[03:35.920 --> 03:40.120]  overwhelm the courts and once they overwhelm the detention facilities it's
[03:40.120 --> 03:46.280]  over you'll have 10 million people in the next year come in it was a million
[03:46.280 --> 03:50.520]  a half illegals they know of last year probably four million they don't ten
[03:50.520 --> 04:01.520]  million is now estimated will pour in this year ten million people and there
[04:01.520 --> 04:07.480]  is a crime culture an MS-13 and a smuggling culture and all the lawlessness
[04:07.480 --> 04:14.600]  you see in Latin America is now here and it's causing giant crime explosions so
[04:14.600 --> 04:21.880]  we come back it's front and center red alert the headline info wars.com the UN
[04:21.880 --> 04:27.560]  funded migrant caravans designed to collapse our borders and our nation
[04:27.560 --> 04:33.200]  are in full swing and and now when I come back all the articles admitting
[04:33.200 --> 04:39.040]  even USA today admits it it is the end of the country as we know it Sunday red
[04:39.040 --> 04:43.560]  alert UN funded migrant invasion brings US port of the verge of collapse ice
[04:43.560 --> 04:50.720]  reports and the Democrats say abolish ice and have no border and allow the
[04:50.720 --> 04:55.200]  crime gangs to run everything instead if that is a treason I don't know what is
[04:55.200 --> 04:58.120]  by the way we have a big report on treason you want to miss this Sunday
[04:58.120 --> 05:03.960]  broadcast info wars.com is how you support us and it's not like we're
[05:03.960 --> 05:07.960]  selling stuff you don't need you don't want the air in the average American
[05:07.960 --> 05:14.800]  home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city there's some of
[05:14.800 --> 05:18.440]  the most polluted areas on earth are major cities how can I solve that
[05:18.440 --> 05:23.760]  problem so we have air filters at info wars.com the Alexa pure breeze which is

[05:36.040 --> 05:40.160]  basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul go ahead and
[05:40.160 --> 05:45.760]  read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself I've got two in my home you
[05:45.760 --> 05:50.640]  will notice the difference ladies and gentlemen with the Alexa pure breeze in

[06:29.600 --> 06:43.440]  Alex Jones because it's what duty demands be done so I'm going to be as
[06:43.440 --> 06:52.160]  calm as I can but this nation is facing its total destruction and so is every
[06:52.160 --> 06:59.160]  other sovereign country and this is a planned worldwide system and we can
[06:59.160 --> 07:04.440]  defeat it if we simply wake up to it and realize what the costs are going to be
[07:04.440 --> 07:12.400]  if we don't say no so I'm going to get to the fact that we have seen the
[07:12.400 --> 07:20.480]  biggest migrant UN funded invasion waves that not just the United States but
[07:20.480 --> 07:24.400]  that Europe has ever seen pointed at completely breaking our border and I
[07:24.400 --> 07:28.560]  know our audience gets this our general regular great audience but we're on so
[07:28.560 --> 07:31.760]  many radio and TV stations have a lot of new viewers all the time they don't
[07:31.760 --> 07:39.320]  understand what the plan is here there's a diagram laid out operation and the way
[07:39.320 --> 07:48.320]  I liken it to is a damn water is a great thing to drink and to cook your food
[07:48.320 --> 07:53.600]  with and you got to have it but if you've got a big damn like you've seen all
[07:53.600 --> 07:59.960]  over the country this year and last year record floods when dams break houses
[07:59.960 --> 08:04.760]  get destroyed people get killed water is a wonderful thing until a few trillion
[08:04.760 --> 08:11.400]  gallons of it come rushing down at you or a few billion gallons now there's a
[08:11.400 --> 08:19.200]  photo of Austin flooded last year and that's exactly what's happening here
[08:19.200 --> 08:25.800]  floods of crime floods of disease and the UN funding and all to overwhelm the
[08:25.800 --> 08:34.760]  beds the Democrats wanted in the latest budget plan a cap at sixteen thousand
[08:34.760 --> 08:41.360]  seven hundred beds ladies and gentlemen some estimates are fifty thousand
[08:41.360 --> 08:46.000]  people are hitting the border today one point five million illegals got
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.400]  apprehended last year look it up millions more they don't know set to be
[08:51.400 --> 08:54.640]  ten million this year I'm going to show you all the articles in a moment ten
[08:54.640 --> 08:59.400]  million people you ever been in a big football game hundred thousand people
[08:59.400 --> 09:03.120]  it's kind of scary when the stands let out so everybody goes so quick instead
[09:03.120 --> 09:08.720]  of slowly going in there's that fear of that flood isn't it you instinctively
[09:08.720 --> 09:13.800]  know it's dangerous people get killed in stampede
[09:13.800 --> 09:21.400]  but imagine tens of thousands of day men women and children little kidnapped
[09:21.400 --> 09:28.880]  children that's all confirmed and so we have a hundred thousand beds the
[09:28.880 --> 09:36.520]  Democrats wanted at sixteen thousand seven hundred now there are two caravans
[09:36.520 --> 09:41.000]  of over forty thousand people it's estimated set to smash into the US in
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.800]  about two weeks they're being trucked up most of them almost all of military
[09:45.800 --> 09:49.520]  age men but the trader media will go show a few women that are in the crowd to
[09:49.520 --> 09:53.440]  pull on heartstrings when they collapse the courts and collapse law
[09:53.440 --> 10:00.560]  enforcement and the border it's over like Europe it's broken ten million in
[10:00.560 --> 10:09.000]  Europe the last seven years almost all military age men we're about to see ten
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.320]  million it's estimated in the next 12 months not fiscal year 2019 the board
[10:14.320 --> 10:17.880]  patrol put out statements they said in the next 12 months they said that this
[10:17.880 --> 10:20.960]  weekend here's the headlines dr. McCam shot please
[10:20.960 --> 10:27.880]  Obama era DHS chief J. Johnson says US has a crisis the southern border and that
[10:27.880 --> 10:31.080]  the border is being imploded and overwhelmed and we may lose full
[10:31.080 --> 10:37.120]  control of the border he's just saying two plus two equals four Trump cuts aid
[10:37.120 --> 10:41.440]  to central American countries as migrant crisis deepens that's where they
[10:41.440 --> 10:46.160]  organize them all the way as far south as Venezuela because Brazil won't let
[10:46.160 --> 10:52.080]  them in they come up they surge highest levels of criminals highest levels of
[10:52.080 --> 10:55.600]  child trafficking it's all confirmed you can pull the wash and post up admit
[10:55.600 --> 11:01.200]  that under the Obama era they knowingly turn children over to pedophiles just
[11:01.200 --> 11:04.400]  hey you got a bunch of kids with you whatever do whatever you want wouldn't
[11:04.400 --> 11:09.720]  even know who you are but when I fly back in from Canada or England I get asked a
[11:09.720 --> 11:13.080]  bunch of questions and checked which is fine it's a border it's our country
[11:13.080 --> 11:18.760]  that's where the checkpoints are supposed to be not internal I fly to
[11:18.760 --> 11:21.760]  Dallas to see family on a 30-minute flight get to ask questions get
[11:21.760 --> 11:24.720]  everything searched I know why it's because jihadis might blow the plane up
[11:24.720 --> 11:30.080]  but the point is that's an internal checkpoint that they rationalize instead
[11:30.080 --> 11:34.000]  of simply profiling who's really doing the terror attacks we're all treated
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.800]  like criminals but the major borders open let's continue
[11:37.800 --> 11:41.600]  Trump cuts aid to Central American countries as migrant crisis deepens
[11:41.600 --> 11:48.560]  exactly what he had to do the Associated Press reports US government cut aid to
[11:48.560 --> 11:52.280]  El Salvador Guatemala Honduras on Saturday the President Donald Trump blasted
[11:52.280 --> 11:55.320]  the Central American countries for sending migrants the United States and
[11:55.320 --> 11:58.920]  threatened to shutter the US Mexico border that's the only way to exercise
[11:58.920 --> 12:04.400]  power over Mexico that gets over $100 billion trade deficit a year gets over
[12:04.400 --> 12:13.000]  $500 billion from the US every year not to mention about a third of the
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.960]  paychecks of half of Mexico living up here being sent back you had that in
[12:18.960 --> 12:24.240]  it's over $700 billion Mexico gets from us one-way deal but we're the evil El
[12:24.240 --> 12:31.280]  Norte Trump is really fighting back but he has to the Democrats think you're
[12:31.280 --> 12:36.040]  idiots they just had the first wave to get everybody used to seeing that they
[12:36.040 --> 12:40.440]  got in and got asylum because after they climbed the fences the war patrol by
[12:40.440 --> 12:43.720]  law has to turn them over to judges not send them back you've got to stop them
[12:43.720 --> 12:48.960]  before they get here but if you even hold people oh they're in cages oh they
[12:48.960 --> 12:54.040]  show Obama era cages we've never seen anything like this as Trump threatens
[12:54.040 --> 12:59.960]  to close the border migrants overwhelm Texas USA today the border patrol says
[12:59.960 --> 13:05.880]  it's double anything they've ever seen diseases smuggling and by the way I
[13:05.880 --> 13:09.040]  played local news out of New York guess where all the measles outbreaks came
[13:09.040 --> 13:14.720]  from oh in Oregon to illegal aliens oh but people that haven't been up to date
[13:14.720 --> 13:19.960]  vaccinated it's our fault even though we didn't cause it spring brings surge of
[13:19.960 --> 13:26.880]  migrants stretching border facilities far beyond capacity MSN crime exploding
[13:26.880 --> 13:33.880]  across South Texas at Southern Arizona and California it's just horrible
[13:33.880 --> 13:39.880]  America at the immigration breaking point according to border patrol head
[13:39.880 --> 13:46.040]  head of the customs and border patrol says that it's broken Mexico braces for
[13:46.040 --> 13:51.520]  new caravan of Central American migrants the biggest yet AP Donald Trump
[13:51.520 --> 13:56.600]  illegal immigrants met by Democratic lawyers at the border which is true this
[13:56.600 --> 14:00.480]  is a system-wide collapse Texas border city overwhelmed by surge of Central
[14:00.480 --> 14:07.840]  American migrants the border is beyond broken but meanwhile O'Rourke
[14:07.840 --> 14:12.840]  champions US Mexico border during Texas kickoff and you've heard his quotes we
[14:12.840 --> 14:15.320]  played him before he repeated them all last night I sat there and watched him
[14:15.320 --> 14:22.240]  say it as I bullarned him and by the way we took most of it over it's incredible
[14:22.240 --> 14:25.640]  he sat there and he said there is no border crisis and we shouldn't have a
[14:25.640 --> 14:30.280]  border at all he puts out press releases about how he's helping caravans get into
[14:30.280 --> 14:35.840]  the US meanwhile you turn into CNN they go there are no caravans remember all the
[14:35.840 --> 14:43.200]  CNN reporters Jake Tapper the usual suspect saying there is no crisis think
[14:43.200 --> 14:49.520]  of how much disdain they have for you how dumb they think you are open borders
[14:49.520 --> 14:55.040]  CNN promotes sanctuary activists whose shoulder legals from ICE agents
[14:55.040 --> 14:58.880]  meanwhile Tapper defense CNN says we didn't get anything wrong in Russia
[14:58.880 --> 15:04.520]  hoax collusion this country is under a massive crisis if they break the borders
[15:04.520 --> 15:09.720]  if these next caravans get over the world sees that then the real big waves
[15:09.720 --> 15:15.120]  come and the border patrol estimates the next 12 months of a third month of 2020
[15:15.120 --> 15:22.640]  10 million people will come in illegally I mean this is just insane then
[15:22.640 --> 15:27.440]  they're given the names of dead people to vote and it's game over that's why
[15:27.440 --> 15:30.720]  veto and all the rest of them have it up in Spanish they're telling illegal
[15:30.720 --> 15:34.480]  aliens to vote he called the veto supporters and the campaign people
[15:34.480 --> 15:38.440]  telling the legals how to vote they come in they're giving it somebody's name
[15:38.440 --> 15:43.320]  they're giving a driver's license they go vote period into the country called
[15:43.320 --> 15:49.040]  treason come on come on up and then once folks get here they're taught to hate
[15:49.040 --> 15:53.480]  the nation how do we fight back how do we stop it and more straight ahead
[15:53.480 --> 15:57.480]  America's fighting for its life and guess what we're putting the fight up but

[18:31.920 --> 18:36.640]  of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal
[18:36.640 --> 18:41.200]  distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[18:41.200 --> 18:45.280]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[18:45.280 --> 18:49.720]  blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and
[18:49.720 --> 18:54.320]  inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[19:04.560 --> 19:08.560]  managed system there is no uncontenual the continuum is always launching
[19:08.560 --> 19:13.720]  forward in the future so you support us and get creative and get fired up we
[19:13.720 --> 19:16.200]  won't just be here a hundred years we'll be here forever we'll turn the whole
[19:16.200 --> 19:20.480]  thing around our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and if God knows
[19:20.480 --> 19:24.200]  what are gonna look back and say you know that we struggled here we made it
[19:24.200 --> 19:28.160]  and that's really where this goes but yeah God's got a big war for you ready
[19:28.160 --> 19:31.880]  and so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and
[19:31.880 --> 19:36.360]  Mao Zedong are you gonna really be able to face the other stuff because God wants
[19:36.360 --> 19:40.320]  warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight
[19:40.320 --> 19:43.320]  you don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back and
[19:43.320 --> 19:46.760]  I mean I don't know what's gonna happen to me in the future I mean all I know is
[19:46.760 --> 19:51.120]  I want to go with the master belt I want to go to the next level I want to be
[19:51.120 --> 19:55.240]  with the spirit that I've experienced not these devil worshipers they're cold
[19:55.240 --> 20:01.440]  and failed and feels like being a tomb I want life I want Jesus
[20:01.440 --> 20:29.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:29.000 --> 20:32.720]  you're listening to the most banned demonized lot about broadcast in the
[20:32.720 --> 20:40.200]  world the Alex Jones show and I've got some very important information right
[20:40.200 --> 20:44.240]  down next segment about the state of the war against the globalist and how
[20:44.240 --> 20:50.280]  things are doing in this really want to use the allegory attack ship and
[20:50.280 --> 20:55.640]  victories we're having but also the damages we have sustained and I hope to
[20:55.640 --> 21:00.080]  stay commissioned in this fight as long as possible but that does come up to all
[21:00.080 --> 21:05.440]  of you and God above and so I petition God and I petition you to search your
[21:05.440 --> 21:10.240]  heart and decide where you want this information warfare system to go because
[21:10.240 --> 21:16.120]  I am in your hands we are in each other's hands and I say the things that others
[21:16.120 --> 21:22.240]  don't say I say them up front with research I've pointed out treason that's
[21:22.240 --> 21:26.000]  going on against this Republic and I pointed out who's involved and how it's
[21:26.000 --> 21:31.080]  multinational corporations using big tech big banks and non-governmental
[21:31.080 --> 21:35.240]  organizations to implode borders and destroy nation-states to consolidate
[21:35.240 --> 21:40.440]  control and you've seen the deep state work to overthrow
[21:40.440 --> 21:45.920]  nationalists here but also overseas and destroy the free press and so the
[21:45.920 --> 21:48.880]  question that Greg Reese asked in this important report that we're about to
[21:48.880 --> 21:55.960]  premiere here it'll then be posted info wars.com and news wars.com is has
[21:55.960 --> 22:01.040]  treason been committed and that's an overused term but in this case yes
[22:01.040 --> 22:04.840]  Google and others moving to China helping suppress their people helping
[22:04.840 --> 22:08.360]  actively work against the US when they're a US based company that was
[22:08.360 --> 22:14.720]  created by DARPA that's the daddy group of the whole deep state that is the
[22:14.720 --> 22:19.280]  classic treason so is trying to implode your borders and admittedly saying you're
[22:19.280 --> 22:22.800]  doing it but Democrats say America was never great it'll never be that great
[22:22.800 --> 22:27.800]  they are the outside force but under this particular law and several others
[22:27.800 --> 22:32.160]  we've got them dead to rights and then I'll play Giuliani saying criminal
[22:32.160 --> 22:35.440]  charges criminal investigations are ongoing against the deep state and the
[22:35.440 --> 22:38.920]  Trump doesn't tend to move forward on that so that's a really good sign you
[22:38.920 --> 22:43.640]  ask what the solution is cut the funding from the Soros group in USAID and all
[22:43.640 --> 22:47.200]  these UN groups flooding the borders cut the funding from the third world
[22:47.200 --> 22:50.440]  countries that are aiding and abetting this the State Department funding
[22:50.440 --> 22:55.520]  Trump just did that cut the funding cut the funding from big tech when it helps
[22:55.520 --> 23:00.320]  censor pull the US government contracts they already have no respect for our
[23:00.320 --> 23:03.960]  government are already actually not even willing to serve the US government we
[23:03.960 --> 23:10.040]  are down the rat hole far the treason is great ladies and gentlemen the evil is
[23:10.040 --> 23:13.880]  strong but if we wake up we're stronger with God's help so here is Greg
[23:13.880 --> 23:18.240]  Greeks is powerful report that'll be posted the next hour dimfold wars calm
[23:18.240 --> 23:23.160]  only you can spread it if you decide to carry out this mission that's what it's
[23:23.160 --> 23:27.040]  all about if you choose to accept this mission this is this isn't a this isn't
[23:27.040 --> 23:33.880]  a movie this isn't some drama it's on a Netflix show it's not mission impossible
[23:33.880 --> 23:41.400]  it's the real mission possible the law that can take down the deep state 18 US
[23:41.400 --> 23:45.920]  code 2385 and I don't want to hear it was misapplied during World War two I
[23:45.920 --> 23:51.000]  get that it's properly applied here not to races or groups of people like
[23:51.000 --> 24:01.040]  Japanese or some Germans but directly at the deep status here it is now that the
[24:01.040 --> 24:06.020]  Mueller investigation is over many questions are falling upon Adam Schiff
[24:06.020 --> 24:10.960]  and others who all claimed to have direct knowledge of criminal evidence
[24:10.960 --> 24:15.200]  against President Donald Trump think there's plenty of evidence of collusion
[24:15.200 --> 24:20.440]  or conspiracy in plain sight cold hard evidence have you seen things on the
[24:20.440 --> 24:24.520]  classified side that you cannot tell us about though that is even stronger
[24:24.520 --> 24:30.440]  evidence than what is out there publicly yes some people are saying they
[24:30.440 --> 24:35.400]  are guilty of treason but the statute for treason specifies that the person
[24:35.400 --> 24:41.320]  levies war against the United States or adheres to their enemies and while we
[24:41.320 --> 24:46.480]  may discover that may be true for some there is one statute that seems to apply
[24:46.480 --> 24:55.080]  to many enacted in 1940 as the alien registration act or the Smith Act 18 US
[24:55.080 --> 25:02.240]  code 2385 prescribes advocating the overthrow of the US government the
[25:02.240 --> 25:06.920]  corrupt establishment was not willing to accept an outlier in the White House
[25:06.920 --> 25:11.960]  and began their attempt at overthrowing the president with a FISA warrant based
[25:11.960 --> 25:18.280]  on a fake Russian dossier with no evidence of a crime the FBI was
[25:18.280 --> 25:24.080]  discussing plans for a coup d'etat according to court documents several
[25:24.080 --> 25:28.840]  mainstream media outlets were hired to report on Russian interference as
[25:28.840 --> 25:35.240]  directed and the American people who put their faith in the mainstream media were
[25:35.240 --> 25:40.400]  manipulated and turned against their lawful elected government it all
[25:40.400 --> 25:48.000]  certainly seems to fit 18 US code 2385 whoever knowingly or willfully
[25:48.000 --> 25:55.720]  advocates abets advises or teaches the duty necessity desirability or
[25:55.720 --> 26:00.920]  propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government of the United States
[26:00.920 --> 26:04.560]  government's going to kill this guy whoever with intent to cause the
[26:04.560 --> 26:10.440]  overthrow or destruction of any such government prints publishes edits
[26:10.440 --> 26:18.520]  issues circulates cells distributes or publicly displays any written or printed
[26:18.520 --> 26:24.960]  matter advocating advising or teaching the duty necessity desirability or
[26:24.960 --> 26:30.320]  propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States you
[26:30.320 --> 26:34.160]  take on the intelligence community they have six ways from Sunday of getting
[26:34.160 --> 26:39.680]  back at whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society group
[26:39.680 --> 26:45.640]  or assembly of persons who teach advocate or encourage the overthrow or
[26:45.640 --> 26:51.440]  destruction of any such government by force or violence or becomes or is a
[26:51.440 --> 26:57.400]  member of or affiliates with any such society group or assembly of persons
[26:57.400 --> 27:05.840]  knowing the purposes thereof those found guilty of 18 US code 2385 can be
[27:05.840 --> 27:11.640]  imprisoned for up to 20 years and perhaps further investigations will lead to
[27:11.640 --> 27:17.640]  charges of sedition or even treason the righteous heart wants justice to be

[33:57.560 --> 34:03.560]  hateful beat-o-roar supporters foaming at the mouth screaming trying to

[34:25.280 --> 34:28.360]  the UN working with traders in our government is collapse Europe's borders
[34:28.360 --> 34:33.320]  working with the EU they admit it's their plan replacement migration and they
[34:33.320 --> 34:36.360]  want to make us politically socialist they believe third world populations are
[34:36.360 --> 34:39.880]  more malleable in their own white papers now they're trying to completely break
[34:39.880 --> 34:44.480]  our border and if this latest group of millions coming get to get in it will
[34:44.480 --> 34:50.120]  overwhelm things completely and already overburden system on the verge of
[34:50.120 --> 34:55.600]  collapse that is treason and not once not twice but three times this week
[34:55.600 --> 34:59.960]  president Trump that I know of talked about how the deep state needs to be
[34:59.960 --> 35:05.800]  punished for the fraud the hoax of trying to bring down the people's election he
[35:05.800 --> 35:11.480]  also talked about it again when he was in that speech in Michigan we're gonna
[35:11.480 --> 35:18.920]  play that later but think about how crazy the times have gotten this is an
[35:18.920 --> 35:26.640]  Alex Jones January 2017 saying the deep state is using funding and the John
[35:26.640 --> 35:31.080]  Warner Defense Authorization Act here's the executive order here's the code to
[35:31.080 --> 35:34.880]  set up a group to burrow into the government to overthrow the election to
[35:34.880 --> 35:38.760]  declare a national emergency to federalize elections under UN control
[35:38.760 --> 35:43.760]  and never have another real election again bringing in a true dictatorship of
[35:43.760 --> 35:48.920]  the Democratic Party you don't just have dictatorships of a dictator that just
[35:48.920 --> 35:54.320]  means directing you have oligarchies and we had oligarchs literally setting up a
[35:54.320 --> 35:57.800]  similar system to what they had in Russia another Christian nation the
[35:57.800 --> 36:05.720]  globalist ran into the ground and so we're here at the precipice right now and
[36:05.720 --> 36:09.280]  I just played you that powerful report on how this is treason and we have laws
[36:09.280 --> 36:12.720]  to deal with it and I'm gonna play the president talking about it as well with
[36:12.720 --> 36:17.400]  Netanyahu but that's where we are this really happened we have the emails we
[36:17.400 --> 36:21.040]  have the text messages we have the illegal warrants we have the lies and we
[36:21.040 --> 36:26.400]  have the corporate media in unison and by the way I'm not complaining but
[36:26.400 --> 36:31.040]  listeners need to understand this by calling me a Russian they were allowed
[36:31.040 --> 36:38.640]  to use leftist funding and leftist groups in the CIA to do all the PR runs the
[36:38.640 --> 36:43.360]  attacks the coordinated disinfo the lawsuits all of it that's admittedly
[36:43.360 --> 36:48.160]  coordinated out of the Central Intelligence Agency on record and they're
[36:48.160 --> 36:52.400]  doing it to not just me but a lot of other people but it's all unraveling now
[36:52.400 --> 36:55.480]  because people that were following orders a lot of them believed it was
[36:55.480 --> 36:58.840]  really the US government and they really believe Trump was a Russian they
[36:58.840 --> 37:02.320]  really believed I was a Russian they really believed that Michael Caputo was
[37:02.320 --> 37:07.200]  a Russian they had congressional hearings in 2017 saying Alex Jones works
[37:07.200 --> 37:11.960]  for the Russians no proof no due process I didn't get called testify that's in the
[37:11.960 --> 37:17.160]  House Defense Committee Armed Services Committee that that's one of the most
[37:17.160 --> 37:23.040]  powerful committees with straight faces was the Pentagon it was Carnegie
[37:23.040 --> 37:28.480]  Endowment and Rockefeller Endowment and Board of Governors of the FCC not that
[37:28.480 --> 37:32.560]  not the members and the chairman but the governors behind it coming in and just
[37:32.560 --> 37:36.280]  lying because they had to have that for the people in government to watch it and
[37:36.280 --> 37:40.320]  believe that I was a Russian agent and Trump was a Russian agent they had to
[37:40.320 --> 37:45.520]  say it openly or these people following orders to tap my phones follow me run
[37:45.520 --> 37:51.360]  black ops harass me try to destroy my family show me 20 something times run
[37:51.360 --> 37:54.640]  hundreds of thousands of hit piece articles because they've written
[37:54.640 --> 37:59.040]  thousands and they syndicate them thousands of times I'm telling you
[37:59.040 --> 38:02.040]  because I've been in the middle of this and I'm not bitching or complaining I'm
[38:02.040 --> 38:06.160]  proud to fight these people and proud to be under attack bomb I don't enjoy it at
[38:06.160 --> 38:10.720]  a at a at a at a fleshly level but a spiritual level that's exactly where I
[38:10.720 --> 38:16.880]  want to be but I want you to understand we have gone over the top here we still
[38:16.880 --> 38:20.240]  got to get back down the mountain but maybe we have we've made it the top okay
[38:20.240 --> 38:24.120]  we are now in the commanding position they've been exposed they got other
[38:24.120 --> 38:27.960]  tricks up their sleeves but their coup failed and and Trump's got all the dirt
[38:27.960 --> 38:34.040]  and he must act against them he must act against the censorship so this is one
[38:34.040 --> 38:40.440]  hell of a time to be alive I got to tell you but for those of us at the tip of
[38:40.440 --> 38:45.440]  the spear Trump's got protection now others do they have picked me for
[38:45.440 --> 38:50.400]  destruction you can see the big acceleration the warm-up thousands of
[38:50.400 --> 38:56.240]  articles the last few weeks I mean they are just if they can't get Trump they
[38:56.240 --> 39:00.760]  intend to get me because they know that you the listeners are who put Trump in
[39:00.760 --> 39:04.360]  that we're the heart of the American reboot and they don't want America to
[39:04.360 --> 39:07.680]  have culture they don't want America to have will they don't want us to have
[39:07.680 --> 39:13.200]  strength and all I'm doing is promoting selling you know space heaters to
[39:13.200 --> 39:18.280]  Eskimos they want them ice cones in hell snow cones in hell people want them

[39:58.600 --> 40:02.640]  go watch it but here he is with the judge they tried to get off air but
[40:02.640 --> 40:09.240]  she's back laying everything out here it is will something happen now well first
[40:09.240 --> 40:15.040]  of all I know you agree with me the people that indicts are the corrupted
[40:15.040 --> 40:21.360]  politicians at the top of the FBI and DOJ no field office of the FBI is
[40:21.360 --> 40:27.240]  implicated in this right no agent who's sacrificing his life to protect us it's
[40:27.240 --> 40:32.800]  a bunch of these phony politicians at the top who corrupt themselves because
[40:32.800 --> 40:37.880]  they want to suck up to his ever-empower that I would describe Comey that way a
[40:37.880 --> 40:42.000]  whole bunch of other people like that McCabe his wife running for office
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.160]  getting millions of dollars from Hillary's these are these are suck-up
[40:46.160 --> 40:51.480]  politicians they're not FBI agents like you know all right I said you know what
[40:51.480 --> 40:55.920]  people put their lives on the line yeah my god they probably the hands a shake
[40:55.920 --> 40:59.240]  if they had to do that yes so that's who we're talking about right the upper
[40:59.240 --> 41:05.160]  echelon what they did here I believe over the next six months we're gonna
[41:05.160 --> 41:12.000]  uncover evidence that what they did here was criminal this this this whole thing
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.040]  of collusion isn't true I was with Donald Trump for the last five months of
[41:16.040 --> 41:20.120]  the campaign he didn't never talk to a Russian he had nothing to do with a
[41:20.120 --> 41:25.120]  Russian as he would point out I don't speak Russian what are they doing this
[41:25.120 --> 41:31.040]  for right somebody made this up Jeanine somebody conceived this and they
[41:31.040 --> 41:34.480]  superimposed it and then they went out to get pause right there you know this
[41:34.480 --> 41:37.120]  interview is so good I'm gonna come back and play more of it on the other side
[41:37.120 --> 41:40.000]  not just the three-month think I'm gonna play like six seven minutes more because
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.040]  it's really powerful because he's a former federal prosecutor she's a former
[41:43.040 --> 41:46.720]  judge and they just lay it out and I know you already know this listeners but
[41:46.720 --> 41:52.080]  these criminals are still some of them still in the FBI they're desperate now
[41:52.080 --> 41:55.080]  they're even more dangerous and then we also come back because I'm out of time
[41:55.080 --> 42:00.640]  now we're gonna play Trump talking about treason because it is treason when
[42:00.640 --> 42:05.160]  it's treason it's treason and and Trump is about to move on big tech he's about
[42:05.160 --> 42:09.880]  to move to everybody else okay and I'm gonna explain all that next hour Bob
[42:09.880 --> 42:14.400]  Barnes one of the smartest people I know he's gonna be in studio he's also chief
[42:14.400 --> 42:17.360]  legal counsel here at info wars that scared the hell out of the other side
[42:17.360 --> 42:21.240]  we're gonna get into what he thinks Trump should do what the type of charges
[42:21.240 --> 42:27.160]  should be see works in federal criminal areas as well and we're going to break it
[42:27.160 --> 42:31.760]  all down coming up and then yes we'll get to all the huge hit pieces I was one
[42:31.760 --> 42:36.000]  of the top stories this weekend with a bunch of lies I did not say I had
[42:36.000 --> 42:42.360]  psychosis I was explaining in parlance a something a 10 or a type to it in
[42:42.360 --> 42:46.880]  specifics of being on the other end of the spectrum from Stockholm syndrome plus
[42:46.880 --> 42:52.240]  I don't have a PhD in it so I can't diagnose but the mainstream media they're
[42:52.240 --> 42:55.920]  all out there violating the Goldwater Act and I don't know what it is because
[42:55.920 --> 43:02.800]  they're fake intellectuals living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it
[43:02.800 --> 43:07.720]  really is the real drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us
[43:07.720 --> 43:11.960]  on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and
[43:11.960 --> 43:17.840]  acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could
[43:17.840 --> 43:22.680]  lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series
[43:22.680 --> 43:28.640]  of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in
[43:28.640 --> 43:33.520]  fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we
[43:33.520 --> 43:37.800]  tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the
[43:37.800 --> 43:43.040]  heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal
[43:43.040 --> 43:48.600]  levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[43:48.600 --> 43:53.280]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[43:53.280 --> 43:58.200]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will
[43:58.200 --> 44:03.360]  purify it our grandparents a great grandparents do they can't food during
[44:03.360 --> 44:07.680]  the fall so you have it during the winter and that's what I'm talking about in

[46:25.160 --> 46:29.880]  always been that's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately

[47:00.600 --> 47:21.960]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:21.960 --> 47:33.440]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report it's Alex Jones we
[47:33.440 --> 47:39.760]  are the frontline held deep behind enemy lines and occupied US territory you
[47:39.760 --> 47:43.800]  notice I don't ever really run the promos that I've had running for 20 years
[47:43.800 --> 47:48.400]  broadcasting from deep behind enemy lines and occupied FEMA region 6 Alex
[47:48.400 --> 47:55.880]  Jones not occupied FEMA region 6 to a great extent we've taken part of the
[47:55.880 --> 48:00.000]  country back and now the globalists are trying to totally bankrupt us the Federal
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.400]  Reserve raised interest rates eight times never raised them on Obama and
[48:03.400 --> 48:08.800]  they're trying to smash our border and CNN remember said over and over again and
[48:08.800 --> 48:12.720]  MSNBC cops deserve to die because if a cop might have done something wrong in
[48:12.720 --> 48:16.680]  another state and then people just pull up and shoot five ten cops it's okay
[48:16.680 --> 48:21.400]  because cops deserve it people said Alex you've gone from being mr. anti-police
[48:21.400 --> 48:25.440]  state to like mr. pro cop no I was against a police at the Democrats were
[48:25.440 --> 48:30.560]  trying to set up and some blue blood Republicans didn't mean I hate cops
[48:30.560 --> 48:35.440]  when the Democrats are promoting randomly killing cops as if cops deserve to
[48:35.440 --> 48:39.000]  randomly die that's called authoritarianism that's called an
[48:39.000 --> 48:44.480]  intimidation to get law enforcement under their control but instead all the
[48:44.480 --> 48:51.320]  black lives matter kill the cops crap backfired and the police under Obama got
[48:51.320 --> 48:55.400]  a crash course in the real world they already knew to a great extent more than
[48:55.400 --> 49:02.280]  general public but they completely converted to reality so I came around to
[49:02.280 --> 49:06.720]  the police they came around to me people asked how that happened when the
[49:06.720 --> 49:10.760]  police were all buying ADL Southern Harvey Law Center crap hook line and
[49:10.760 --> 49:15.560]  sinker in most areas and we're open on the news going we're prepared for war
[49:15.560 --> 49:19.720]  with the veterans and we're gonna confiscate their guns obviously the
[49:19.720 --> 49:24.520]  average cop didn't like that but that type of leadership had to be removed and
[49:24.520 --> 49:30.440]  to some extent it has been because the last thing we want to civil war and a
[49:30.440 --> 49:35.640]  violent uprising in this country where the police are gonna be put right in the
[49:35.640 --> 49:41.640]  middle of it and I don't even want to say the police are the least of our
[49:41.640 --> 49:48.240]  problems they're not the problem we are the problem you know I used to I got
[49:48.240 --> 49:51.600]  more sophisticated about ten years ago six seven years ago really woke up but
[49:51.600 --> 49:57.640]  I was like why am I bitching at people making $20 an hour who are ordered to do
[49:57.640 --> 50:02.200]  this because I'd go through the TSA and I was so mean to him and I was attacking
[50:02.200 --> 50:05.880]  him and they would give me they'd ask for autographs they'd apologize they'd
[50:05.880 --> 50:10.600]  say we want a union we don't want to do this we want a profile and I guess it
[50:10.600 --> 50:15.520]  was so many of TSA people being fans and they said why don't you ask Congress to
[50:15.520 --> 50:21.080]  change it mr. Jones why do you blame us about after the fifth time that happened
[50:21.080 --> 50:28.880]  I went oh why didn't I because at a visceral level I'm not a terrorist so
[50:28.880 --> 50:33.520]  what have I got a bottle of water in my wife's purse I forgot why are you in my
[50:33.520 --> 50:37.360]  face you know part of it was the training and some of them are jerks and
[50:37.360 --> 50:42.200]  it's a it's a rough job I mean it's you cattle cave people mad stressed out
[50:42.200 --> 50:45.860]  going through there you smell the stress I just got older and I started
[50:45.860 --> 50:52.360]  thinking about how other people feel and then I went wait a minute I need a lot
[50:52.360 --> 51:00.280]  of Congress to change these laws see it's up to us we let this happen and we
[51:00.280 --> 51:05.880]  have to stop it happening but now we've got the president at Michigan rallies and
[51:05.880 --> 51:10.960]  an Oval Office press briefings and on the road and getting on Air Force One
[51:10.960 --> 51:15.000]  saying there was an attempted overthrow an attempted coup was criminal and now
[51:15.000 --> 51:21.040]  they've been caught and they need to go to jail you know how powerful that is
[51:21.040 --> 51:27.120]  because it's the truth people so that sounds radical if you wake up at 2 a.m.
[51:27.120 --> 51:31.160]  and people are downstairs in your house ransacking things and you hear one of
[51:31.160 --> 51:34.760]  them your kids are crying it's an extreme thing that's happening and you grab the
[51:34.760 --> 51:42.600]  shotgun and you go down there and you blast them you don't want the extreme
[51:42.600 --> 51:48.120]  thing to happen the extreme thing came to you you've got a globalist coup over
[51:48.120 --> 51:52.520]  the country you get the information you and back their ass you clean them out
[51:52.520 --> 51:57.560]  people like well they're gonna fight back they've already been fighting back
[51:58.560 --> 52:05.240]  it's like the Merle Hadard song I hear about some squirrely guy who just don't
[52:05.240 --> 52:09.360]  believe in fighting and I wonder how long the rest of us can count on being
[52:09.360 --> 52:16.160]  free and fighting just means fighting for American values and not backing down
[52:16.160 --> 52:23.480]  you've seen what giving up the values does it creates hell and to be a man is
[52:23.480 --> 52:26.840]  to stop worried about what happens to you at the end of the day as long as you
[52:26.840 --> 52:31.320]  the right thing you're gonna be fulfilled I know the listeners know that
[52:31.320 --> 52:35.520]  but I watched so many of these men out there and they think going around kissing
[52:35.520 --> 52:39.480]  ass with the system and going along with the globalist intimidation is gonna get
[52:39.480 --> 52:45.200]  them somewhere it's not gonna get you anywhere but being enslaved it's the
[52:45.200 --> 52:49.480]  same thing for women out there it's called the animating contest of liberty
[52:49.480 --> 52:53.960]  by Thomas Jefferson because it is the animating contest and look there's all
[52:53.960 --> 52:57.560]  these men that work out and are in great shape good for you and they and they
[52:57.560 --> 53:02.960]  got Molon Molon lobby stickers on their car good but we need you to run for
[53:02.960 --> 53:06.480]  office or we need you to go speak at city council or we need you to mentor a
[53:06.480 --> 53:10.480]  local student group to take them hunting or fishing we just need to be humans and
[53:10.480 --> 53:14.080]  we need men to be leaders and I know the average alpha male actually just wants
[53:14.080 --> 53:17.600]  to run their own operation to be left alone and doesn't want to go command
[53:17.600 --> 53:20.640]  people around it's control freaks that want power real alpha males just want
[53:20.640 --> 53:24.360]  to be successful in their own right be left alone most alpha males I found a
[53:24.360 --> 53:29.800]  really solitary creatures and it's that problem you're not gonna be solitary and
[53:29.800 --> 53:34.840]  you're not gonna be left alone unless you get out there and take action and of
[53:34.840 --> 53:38.080]  course a lot of other good smart men I know are like well I need to plan it out
[53:38.080 --> 53:42.360]  it needs to be perfect I've got to do it just right no just do it get on the damn
[53:42.360 --> 53:47.360]  bike you'll learn how to write it half of what I do is a train wreck I've been
[53:47.360 --> 53:51.600]  doing this 25 years I was a mesh when I first was doing it but sometimes I got
[53:51.600 --> 53:54.560]  up there to speak at city council and people's jaws dropped everybody started
[53:54.560 --> 53:57.840]  clapping and they said fine we won't pass that law even though they had every
[53:57.840 --> 54:01.600]  damn person on the city council ready to pass it sometimes I gave speeches so
[54:01.600 --> 54:05.200]  good you've never heard somebody give one so good and other times I was a
[54:05.200 --> 54:11.040]  gibbering moron it doesn't matter what matters is you mean to do good and you
[54:11.040 --> 54:16.440]  get your facts straight and you take action if you don't you're screwed I
[54:16.440 --> 54:20.200]  said I'd be very relaxed today and I was relaxed the first 30 minutes or so but
[54:20.200 --> 54:25.560]  I start thinking about how epic it is that we had a literal total coup over
[54:25.560 --> 54:29.360]  everything the plan to implode the country break the border under Chai
[54:29.360 --> 54:33.520]  com control Google Apple moving to China they thought we were done and in the
[54:33.520 --> 54:39.720]  midst of this it's been almost 100 degree turnaround not 180 degrees yet but
[54:39.720 --> 54:46.760]  we've we have swung this baby around more way than we hadn't we're more than
[54:46.760 --> 54:50.520]  halfway back ladies and gentlemen and it doesn't mean some utopia or some
[54:50.520 --> 54:54.280]  perfect world like the commies or the socialist or the New Agers always offer
[54:54.280 --> 54:58.600]  it's just a world based on humans and based on being honest and based on
[54:58.600 --> 55:02.800]  justice and based on hard work and based on what we know works we're getting
[55:02.800 --> 55:06.600]  closer to that every minute and that's why you hear the screaming and the
[55:06.600 --> 55:10.080]  pulin and the yelling by the evil ones and their minions because their whole
[55:10.080 --> 55:14.720]  universe is about controlling and running other people because if they can
[55:14.720 --> 55:19.440]  control the strong and the brave then they could be somebody the strong and
[55:19.440 --> 55:25.640]  the brave don't crave power that's good but you better crave freedom and you
[55:25.640 --> 55:28.840]  better stand up for the women and children because you haven't been
[55:28.840 --> 55:34.160]  leaders and you've created a vacuum Trump won't regulate for free speech a
[55:34.160 --> 55:38.280]  prohibitory regulation saying no regulation they've allowed the usurpation
[55:38.280 --> 55:43.080]  now the UN and New Zealand are dictating US regulations by fiat I have
[55:43.080 --> 55:47.600]  stacks of mainstream news word-for-word saying when I said two years ago if you
[55:47.600 --> 55:52.040]  don't start saying no censorship mr. president it creates a vacuum for these
[55:52.040 --> 55:56.800]  multinational bodies and the UN to take control of our internet which we built
[55:56.800 --> 56:03.520]  and now it's happened I'm right again sorry let's let's let's go to the
[56:03.520 --> 56:07.320]  president talking about reason here it is it's lasted a long time we're glad
[56:07.320 --> 56:12.680]  it's over it's a 100% the way it should have been I wish you could have gone a
[56:12.680 --> 56:17.520]  lot sooner a lot quicker there are a lot of people out there that have done some
[56:17.520 --> 56:22.040]  very very evil things very bad things I would say treasonous things against our
[56:22.040 --> 56:31.760]  country and hopefully that people that have done such harm to our country we've
[56:31.760 --> 56:39.680]  gone through a period of really bad things happening those people will
[56:39.680 --> 56:43.040]  certainly be looked at I've been looking at them for a long time and I'm
[56:43.040 --> 56:47.000]  saying why haven't they been looked at they lied to Congress many of them you
[56:47.000 --> 56:52.920]  know who they are they've done so many evil things I will tell you I love this
[56:52.920 --> 56:58.640]  country I love this country as much as I can love anything my family my country
[56:58.640 --> 57:04.960]  my God but what they did it was a false narrative it was it was a terrible
[57:04.960 --> 57:11.120]  thing we can never let this happen to another president again I can tell you
[57:11.120 --> 57:17.080]  that I say it very strongly very few people I know could have handled it we
[57:17.080 --> 57:23.000]  can never ever let this happen to another president again thank you all very
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.600]  much believe the president's having to talk about treason and bureaucratic
[57:27.600 --> 57:33.800]  coups to stop the American voter and if they'd had their way they would have
[57:33.800 --> 57:37.680]  taken control of all the elections all 50 attorney generals fought back against
[57:37.680 --> 57:41.640]  it at the state level and they would have come in with the next phase you're
[57:41.640 --> 57:45.680]  already seeing what they plan to do just a shadow of it and it's horrible but
[57:45.680 --> 57:51.000]  they're still trying to execute Hillary's plan it's simple if you want to
[57:51.000 --> 57:54.240]  beat the globalist if you want to take on the New World Order I'm not doing
[57:54.240 --> 57:58.520]  Bitcoin pumping dumps with Jack Dorsey I'm not sitting here selling you cancer
[57:58.520 --> 58:02.080]  cures I'm not sitting here you know selling you late-term abortion and all

[58:09.920 --> 58:12.880]  lab in the country okay they're the highest rate I'm like you're only 50%
[58:12.880 --> 58:16.800]  curcuminoid well yeah they want to put $5 product and bottle but that's still
[58:16.800 --> 58:21.760]  incredible sir I'm like what's the highest you could do a month later 90 95%
[58:21.760 --> 58:25.880]  no one's ever done I said how much that cost a bottle that cost $10 no one's
[58:25.880 --> 58:29.440]  ever done that sir the average competitors three to five percent year the
[58:29.440 --> 58:33.880]  top brand's 50% I'm like we're gonna have 95% curcuminoid I mean you understand
[58:33.880 --> 58:37.360]  like that's like our information is explosive our fish oil I go out and I

[58:45.840 --> 58:49.600]  somebody over like one of these devil worshipers never enforce where I come

[59:00.480 --> 59:05.000]  and the globalist it is you the info warriors across the planet that stood
[59:05.000 --> 59:08.080]  against the bully that stood against the peer pressure that stood against the

[59:47.440 --> 59:51.680]  renaissance and we are winning
[59:52.360 --> 59:57.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:10.280]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show I hear people
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:16.760]  talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:23.960]  harping on wars we fight and griping about the way things are to be
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:31.400]  and I don't mind them switching sides and standing up to things they believe in
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:37.480]  when they're running down my country man they're walking on the fight inside of
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:48.120]  me yeah walking on the fight inside of me running down with life by fighting
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:54.680]  and fought to die to be you don't love it leave it you don't love it leave it let
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:02.080]  this song I'm singing be a warning to you you're running down my country man
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:08.200]  my fellow Texan Merle Hager folks are gonna say he's an oaky from Muscogee
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:13.960]  you just don't know your history then Oklahoma's nothing but North Texas it
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:21.880]  was North Texas after the Civil War they carved it off Texas used to go all
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:27.360]  the way up guys type in a Texas original topography from the Treaty of
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:33.480]  Guadalupe Hidalgo it shot all the way up into Colorado show the eastern part of
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:39.160]  Colorado all the way down part of New Mexico what's Texas today and all of
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:44.840]  Oklahoma little bit of a side history note for folks think about history this
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:51.000]  like a I don't know how to describe it it's like a it's like a jigsaw puzzle
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.840]  or a or a or a just the more pieces you put the more you want to know and then
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.360]  and then everything starts making sense and not really the pop history you get
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:02.640]  but the deep history you know I had to suspend a lot of my deep historical
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.760]  research about a decade ago I used to stay up at night a lot till 2 3 the
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.920]  morning reading history books still but you know I've got four children and
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:14.160]  about after the second one or so I just had to start cutting back and so here
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.080]  we are my real love is reading those history books I'll put that back on
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:26.080]  screen my fellow Texan Merle Haggard overlay that over a new map and show
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:32.480]  a skokie or however you say it Native American word up there in Oklahoma as
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:38.720]  you can see I guess you could say that's also part of I don't know it's
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:45.280]  crazy there's another map of that too yes that's also part of a little bit of
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:50.720]  many Mexico that's actually an intermediate map there's actually an
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.840]  earlier one that's what I'm saying there's an earlier no there's an earlier
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:03:01.720]  one it's even a bigger piece of that but anyways I digress you don't tune in to
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:05.760]  hear my babblings half the time they're distorted anyways and I'm honest
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:12.160]  about that Jones admits he's distorted everything's distorted yeah and there's
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:16.120]  even another version see there's been a bunch of versions of Texas and when I
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.440]  say distorted they all kind of just mix together and then I can always go get a
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:24.240]  refresher but that's why as you get older especially you need to you know go
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:33.280]  back and look crazy when you're young you can have a photographic memory but
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:39.960]  when you're not you don't get a photographic memory some of you but you
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.240]  don't know how to use it and when you get old you don't have the photographic
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.960]  memory anymore but you got some of the wisdom and it's kind of how those two
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.640]  things mix together all right let me stop right there because I kind of went
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:55.400]  off the rails our guest will be here in about 15 minutes or so I want when we
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:59.440]  come back I mean there's really nothing more important than the attempt to crush
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:03.600]  our border implode our currency and kill the nation and the traders trying to
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:09.000]  demoralize and break the country up with the classic psychological warfare race
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.320]  baiting and sexist baiting and all of it it's not our opinion it's being done to
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:18.480]  break us up again it's in the wiki leaks it's in the white papers they write it's
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:22.560]  all just total proof of treason there's a big video we just posted info wars.com
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.320]  the law that can take down the deep state that goes over just a small part of
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:34.640]  it but very eloquently but when we return I want to get into an area that we
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:41.320]  haven't hit yet that deals with the hypocrisy of the so-called left with
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:50.320]  Joe Biden's activities and how that ties in to the disgusting evil tip of the
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:59.280]  global of spear SPLC and its implosion you'll want to stay with us I've been
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:04.760]  doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:10.840]  there's one type of video that is the most censored the most buried the most
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:17.680]  suppressed and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:22.560]  arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:27.400]  hurt when Trump won they don't want us to have that victory they don't want us
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:32.800]  to remember what political action did and that's why the globalist Hillary and
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:37.360]  others are trying to shut in for us now this is a fight about taking your speech
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:42.320]  away not just my speech about taking your very sovereignty away this country is
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:46.640]  in a war so again I want to thank you for what you've done but I want to
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.480]  remind you if you don't spread the articles and videos and if you don't
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:53.400]  financially get the great products we have and fund us in the 360 win we're
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:57.600]  dead in the water I'm in your hands you're in my hands info or store calm
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.360]  thank you
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:20.600]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:27.480]  live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:39.320]  all right ladies and gentlemen let's break down exactly what's going on we
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:44.800]  have globalist forces that have parlayed Americans global dominance after
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:49.240]  world war two into a corporate world government system they've shut up
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:54.440]  loosely in affiliates with the communist Chinese supplying the slave labor and
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:07:03.880]  now they hope the military and cyber chronic muscle for the cyber wars and
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:10.240]  they've got attack dog groups that study the anthropology the sociology the
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:13.720]  psychology the history of the United States and know about our Christian
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:18.520]  ethos and our serious guilt for slavery and things like that the whole world
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:22.560]  has histories on average much worse than ours but those histories aren't taught
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:27.920]  only histories that make America look bad but separately in the West we have
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:33.720]  hands down a history of treating women the very best of women's suffrage of
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:39.440]  women's empowerment of women in positions of power the West undoubtedly
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:44.680]  has the best record on racial equality the best record on women's rights the
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:50.880]  best record on allowing homosexuals to live in peace but of course all those
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.960]  supposed groups hate the West and believe it's the worst thing on earth
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:08:00.200]  you know why is that because if you've got a history of nations in the West that
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:05.240]  that that are tolerant you use their tolerance against them and then you name
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:11.800]  socialism communism globalism gay or liberal or pro-black and then people go
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:15.840]  well I better accept communism or socialism even though it's economically
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:19.120]  horrible I know it doesn't work and it's bad but only let's the elite run
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:23.320]  things I better do it because I'll be called a racist and so it becomes like
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:28.040]  a religious sacrament so it's nothing but political cover that you'll be
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.960]  bullied you'll be attacked if you're not part of the you know the end club the
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:36.320]  the anointed ones who were just basically like club joiners that's what
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:40.200]  leftists really are are just people that want a virtue signal but statistically
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:45.040]  actually don't give the charity and many are very racist people I mean the worst
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:49.080]  people you're gonna find are liberals and they believe they're in a club that
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:53.520]  is has priest power to control people and say who's good and say who isn't good
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:09:01.800]  so it's everything bad about secret societies and clubs on steroids so you
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.640]  have the Southern Poverty Law Center that has reportedly over a billion dollars
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:11.040]  offshore and who trains law enforcement trains universities trains
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.800]  governments and who has control of elementary school curriculum who says
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.560]  if you don't like drag queen story time with convicted child molesters or
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:24.040]  murderers literally they've actually called groups that are against convicted
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:29.360]  murderers being with small children at gay sex shows then they come out and
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:32.760]  say you're bad and I'm gonna show you articles in a moment so you've got the
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:38.640]  head of the SPLC their their sub directors all resigning as it comes out
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.000]  that they are incredibly racist reportedly incredibly sexist whether
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.440]  that's true or not they're eating their own but in my experience with leftists
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.920]  you don't find people more racist more evil more corrupt so SPLC implodes
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:57.960]  president and legal director resigned amid sexual misconduct scandal that was
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:02.600]  last week now more SPLC employees step forward claim systemic culture racism
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:10.160]  and sexism but Michelle Obama her chief of staff has taken over to go
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.280]  investigate oh yes Southern Poverty Law Center urges teachers to lecture first
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:20.000]  graders about microaggressions and structural racism brainwash kids to all
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.480]  fight with each other over what color they are the opposite of Martin Luther
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:31.480]  King's plan and so it just goes on from there now dovetail that hypocrisy of what
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:35.720]  they're doing with Kavanaugh no proof almost all the women came out and said
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:39.520]  it was fake with what they're doing reportedly raping women reportedly
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:44.280]  sexually assaulting women getting away with it paying them off I mean you've
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:47.000]  got a few directors of this that all have hundreds of millions of peace
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:55.640]  reportedly in slush funds that's a piece and their job is to build
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:11:02.520]  conservatives liberals you name it who over the years going back 30 40 years
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:07.360]  with what would hear about stop racism in the south send $20 in to make sure
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:13.680]  black people can vote 30 years ago my mother and my dad bought the bull and
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.160]  then and they were a mix of conservative and liberal and thought yeah the
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:21.960]  Southern Poverty Law is a name like you know it's in Alabama and we're gonna help
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.800]  poor black people because you might ask that help get black folks able to vote
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:30.800]  he was in state government but that's not who they are they're monsters ladies
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.600]  and gentlemen involved in Oklahoma City you name it so think of the
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:38.760]  hypocrisy as it all comes down it's beyond hypocrisy Kavanaugh believable
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:44.120]  the women but when the leftists do it don't now different White House
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:49.080]  officials have come out and said look at Joe Biden with different members of the
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:52.320]  Democratic Party coming out and saying that when he was around them even in
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.560]  public sometimes on video he would grab their bodies he would kiss them he
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:00.560]  would fondle them there's hours of footage of creepy Joe Biden and that's
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:04.000]  what the White House said they just said search engine creepy Joe Biden well
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:10.280]  you know Google just blocked those searches now they always attack me and
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:14.520]  say Jones claims Biden kisses little girls and rubs on them and plays with
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:18.720]  their hair and puts his hands on women's hips and I mean you get punched most
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:24.680]  places doing this and we have hours hours of this footage back tonight I'm
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:27.520]  gonna stay late and compile it all because we always just kind of show the
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.240]  first of the real never the deeper stuff the really really bad stuff where
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:35.400]  his parents are pushing him off their kids he's rubbing their shoulders rubbing
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:40.520]  their hair rubbing their cheeks I mean it just goes on and on full grown women
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:45.840]  he's grabbing their breasts but see when Joe Biden does it it's okay he does it on
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:53.880]  c-span he does it hiding in plain view Biden defends his behavior with women the
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:58.080]  allegation was made in New York magazine article by Lucy Flores who is
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.760]  attractive a former Nevada state representative in 2014 Democratic nominee
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:05.400]  for Nevada lieutenant governor Biden doesn't deny he ran his hands through
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:09.080]  her and tried to kiss her and did kiss her if anybody just types in creepy

[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.760]  clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.560]  1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:25.240]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:29.760]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit

[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:31.040]  and he was suddenly I go knock on doors people knew I was then we were able to
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:31.760]  share the party
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.480]  that's the show that's you we helped launch Brexit
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:39.240]  now it's a fight of course it's not going to be easy but now the fact that the EU's
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.600]  a dictatorship is out in the open
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:46.480]  all these nationalist operations nobody ever launched a big anti-globalist show
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:47.680]  that really let it all out
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:50.800]  they always got off into UFO's
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:54.680]  or they got off into the Vatican or Jews or whatever and all that is a
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.280]  distraction on purpose
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:00.040]  to not make it about humanity unifying around open free
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:04.720]  free market societies and coming together and renaissance in Americana
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:08.760]  the globalist had formulas to sabotage all the movements
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:12.880]  they didn't sabotage us they didn't sabotage Ron Paul
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:17.200]  Ron Paul was critical in this or Matt Drudge or others
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.400]  or world that daily and we built
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.160]  an alternative to globalism that's been picked up everywhere and now we've gone
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:24.800]  from
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:31.320]  no seats in power to winning almost every election
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.320]  there have been hundreds of elections
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:38.120]  and in almost every election right wingers nationalists
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:43.160]  free marketers patriots are getting elected the globalist plan is to kill
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:44.600]  any national sovereignty
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:48.360]  flooding countries with illegal aliens who then are political chattel
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:52.360]  of the bureaucracy so it's a fight between the people
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:55.800]  the bureaucracy in the deep state and as long as we identify that we're going to
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:56.240]  win
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:01.000]  but I cannot stress enough how critical the fight is now
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.680]  John Bownes filed a very important reporter
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:08.680]  titled the border is beyond broken it's on info wars dot com
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:11.880]  and the UN is trying to fully break our border
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:16.200]  with traders inside our government now once they break it once the courts are
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:16.840]  overwhelmed
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:20.280]  once the facilities are overwhelmed then the even bigger floods come
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:23.640]  this is law and order being broken
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:27.720]  Mad Max road warrior level anarchy being introduced
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:31.040]  this is the globalist takedown model here is the video
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:35.800]  Ado O'Rourke the Irishman who identifies as Hispanic
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:40.080]  unleashed his candidacy for president and celebrated his platform to break the
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.160]  back of America
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:45.160]  in El Paso Texas by keeping the southern borders wide open
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.280]  We will find security
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:54.000]  not through walls not through militarization
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.520]  we will find security by focusing on our ports of entry
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:02.880]  that connect us to the rest of the world so we have a better idea of who and what is coming in here
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:06.680]  we facilitate the trade and travel connected to millions
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:11.400]  of jobs around this country meanwhile Mexico warns that a caravan of over
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:15.440]  twenty thousand central americans is heading towards the US border
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.480]  while as the Arizona central reports US border patrol officials in Arizona said
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.960]  they have started releasing migrant families
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:27.360]  from their custody into the streets of humor because processing centers can't
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:30.640]  cope with the large numbers of arriving families and minors
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:34.320]  additionally Princeton policy advisors researcher Stephen
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:39.200]  Copitz projects that in twenty nineteen there will be up to five hundred
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:41.720]  thousand illegal aliens at the southern border
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:45.440]  who successfully cross into the US undetected
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:49.840]  by border patrol agents. Two weeks ago I briefed the media and testified in
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.800]  Congress that our immigration system was at the breaking point
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:56.480]  that breaking point has arrived this week at our border
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:00.000]  and nowhere has that crisis manifested more acutely
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.400]  than here in El Paso. On Monday and Tuesday
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.760]  CBP started the day with over twelve thousand migrants
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:11.560]  in our custody. As of this morning that number was
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:15.880]  thirteen thousand four hundred. A high number for us
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.680]  is four thousand. A crisis level is six thousand.
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:25.880]  Thirteen thousand is unprecedented. The arriving flows are made up primarily of
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.400]  Central American families
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:30.280]  and unaccompanied children over sixty five percent of them.
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.640]  These groups cannot be repatriated expeditiously
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.760]  and instead are almost guaranteed to be released
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:40.480]  to remain in the US indefinitely regardless of the merits
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:43.560]  of their immigration or asylum claim and within that flow
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:47.040]  are thousands of criminals, smugglers, gang members
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:50.120]  and public safety threats that we're sworn to protect
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:54.320]  this country from. With up to forty percent or more of our personnel in key
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.640]  sectors like El Paso
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:59.120]  working to care for, transport, provide medical
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:01.880]  and hospital watch for families and children
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:05.120]  that means our security posture at the border is negatively impacted.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.840]  The same criminal organizations
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:11.360]  that are smuggling migrants, profiting from them,
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:15.160]  abusing them in the journey are benefiting from our reduced security presence.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:19.480]  They're bringing drugs, they're bringing adults who are trying to evade capture behind
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:20.240]  those families
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:24.880]  as we're bogged down with large groups. As the surge continues to be unmanageable
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.560]  Trump's warning that the borders will be closed
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:30.600]  sets up yet another fight with Congress as
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:34.160]  another partial government shutdown could begin soon
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:39.280]  if negotiations continue to stall. Number one, Congress has to act
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:44.120]  and number two, Mexico, they make so much money from the United States and so many
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:45.120]  other things
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:48.680]  so many other assets. They have to grab it
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:52.840]  and they have to stop it. We have right now two big caravans coming up
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:56.120]  from Guatemala. Massive caravans
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.280]  walking right through Mexico. So Mexico is tough,
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:02.920]  they can stop them but they chose not to. Now they're going to stop them
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:06.400]  and if they don't stop them, we're closing the border. They'll
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.920]  close it and we'll keep it closed for a long time. I'm not playing games.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:13.720]  The Democrats should be proud of their anti-American intentions.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:17.880]  They are still winning the unprecedented United Nations battle to
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:20.320]  destroy America from within.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:24.280]  John Baum reporting. That is an incredible report.
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:27.800]  Everyone listening should go to infowars.com, get the report
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:31.720]  and share it with everyone you know. Now
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:35.800]  again, people are probably asking Alex, you're all over the news. They're saying
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.720]  all these incredible things about you. Why aren't you
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:41.000]  countering the fact that you're one of the top stories in the country
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.440]  where you quote admit you're mentally ill, everything you say is BS,
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:47.840]  never said any of that. Didn't say that, that's a lie,
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.160]  it's all edited. I don't matter at the end of the day.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:56.000]  This transmission platform matters. This is big stuff
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.960]  at our border. This is big stuff the president's doing. He's now
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:02.800]  delivering. He's now hit his second win. It's amazing.
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:06.480]  So yes, pray for us, pray for the president, but the main front and center news
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.840]  is not what's going on with infowars.
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:14.240]  Yes, it's important. It shows other media lies. Don't we already know how much the
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:17.360]  corporate media lies. The biggest thing you can do
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:20.240]  is pray for us, is spread the articles and videos,
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:24.320]  and yes, get the products. Everyone needs X2. If you don't know about the good

[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:43.600]  till Thursday here in studio working on the establishment's coordinated effort
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:47.280]  to shut us down. Next segment, so I'm gonna talk about this
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:50.640]  for an hour and a half, I want to get into what you think historically because
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.280]  you're quite a historian, not just a lawyer, a constitutional lawyer and a guy
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:55.760]  that's worked obviously in highest levels of criminal,
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:00.240]  stop as a defense lawyer, what Trump should do legally and lawfully,
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:03.680]  what the crimes are committed by the deep state. We know there's a lot, we've
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:06.960]  gone over some of them with ways they could be charged, classical treason, but
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:10.240]  a lot of easier ways to go after them. We'll do that next segment, but since
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:14.160]  you're talking about during the break, we saw, given the media,
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:17.840]  even though it's on the video, we say 60 days still could be released,
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:21.360]  even then maybe not, my so-called deposition,
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:25.840]  and then we see claims that I'm saying, we're gonna play the clip in a moment, that
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:30.480]  I have a form of psychosis. I wasn't diagnosed with that, I don't have a
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:33.120]  degree in that. What I was saying is, is that when the
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:38.800]  media lies so much and you've been told lies, it induces a
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:42.160]  state historically where people start believing nothing,
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:46.000]  and then much of the public thinks I'm Bill Hicks or Beau Bridges,
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.280]  so you got people on one end that believe the earth is flat
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:52.640]  and that the moon is made of cheese because the government says it isn't,
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:56.560]  and then you've got the other end where they say, you know, that President
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:59.520]  Trump's a Russian agent, we've got all the proof, and then Jake Tapper comes out
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:03.120]  and says, we never said that today. So you've got two ends,
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:06.640]  one lying on purpose, confusing people, the other
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:10.080]  not knowing what's real anymore, and kind of floating around. I was simply
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.640]  saying, they are inducing, instead of the
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.360]  Stockholm syndrome, where I just believe anything they say,
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.000]  I went the other way and said, I don't believe anything you say, which with a
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.520]  known liar is kind of the default, but that is kind of a
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:27.200]  psychosis, meaning that it blurs your cultural, historical,
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:31.040]  temporal understanding of things, when you're given nothing but garbage,
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:34.400]  how do you then come up with a response that's accurate,
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:38.080]  garbage in, garbage out? So they took that as, Jones admits
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:42.880]  he is a, basically a psychotic, or that he has psychosis,
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:46.720]  which is not, I said almost a type of psychosis,
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:50.080]  and that I would overly see things as all staged,
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:53.120]  or at least they were covering something up, which it turns out,
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:55.840]  they showed the police saying they did cover up response time and things. So
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:57.840]  I'm ranting here, we'll get to that clip in a moment, but
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.240]  what is your general thumbnail of where you see this going, what they're
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:04.880]  trying to do? So it's really a systematic effort to
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:08.560]  suppress independent speech, and particularly the independent press,
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:11.280]  and the people's ability to respond and react, and to
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:14.960]  choose their own views across the board. So it's a
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:18.160]  systematic effort, it's being orchestrated by people at
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:21.840]  the top, politically, people who have an agenda that is different than the
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:24.720]  agenda of free speech or free press in the country.
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:26.960]  So they don't believe in freedom of ideas, they don't believe in freedom of
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:31.040]  thought, and so those people who are celebrating these kind of suits,
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:33.760]  who want suppression of speech and want suppression of press,
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:37.280]  are people who are hostile and antithetical to the core values of the
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:39.600]  American Constitution. And that's really what's sort of
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.800]  fundamentally happening, and that's what the big debate is. What you're seeing is,
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:46.560]  you look at what the mainstream media did in propagating a clearly a
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:49.840]  dangerous hoax about Russia collusion, delusion,
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:52.880]  that could have led us into nuclear conflict with the greatest nuclear
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:56.160]  power in the world, and you see a complete lack of responsibility and
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:00.000]  accountability across the board. By contrast, you look at what happened
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.440]  here, where you talk about Sandy Hook in different contexts, you discuss it in
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:06.560]  different contexts, when you recognize you made mistakes, you admit and
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:10.240]  acknowledge those mistakes, and instead there's a constant effort to demonize,
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:13.360]  constant effort to defame, constant effort to destroy.
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:16.640]  So you see a complete disparity in how they're treating the independent press
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:20.240]  versus the institutional press. They want the institutional press to have the
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.280]  only approved narrative, the only one who can propagate a story.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:27.920]  And they reward stonewalling and lying, but they punish people that actually
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:30.720]  try to set the record straight. Absolutely. So those who are people who
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:34.560]  are honest and authentic and recognize errors when those errors occur,
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.920]  recognize mistakes, recognize the state of mind when the state of mind
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:40.880]  is what it is. Those people are the ones getting disproportionately punished.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:43.120]  Those are the people who are disproportionately prosecuted. Those
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:46.400]  are the people disproportionately persecuted by the institutional press
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:49.920]  using their collusion with big institutional tech and social media.
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:52.640]  Because we actually have a state of mind. We're trying to figure things out.
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:55.440]  The establishment just comes up with whatever they want, and then just say
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:58.640]  that's it. Precisely. I mean, you see it, I mean, you couldn't have a bigger
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:02.240]  disparity between people who raised questions and people who had doubts
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:05.680]  about what happened in different cases across in the past, going all the way
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:08.720]  back to Operation Northwoods and its modus operandi, and how the
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:11.600]  institutional press covered the Russia collusion delusion, where they
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.720]  defamed all kinds of people all across the country. None of them have suffered
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:17.840]  any consequences for what they did. None of them are accepting or acknowledging
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:21.200]  any responsibility for what they did. Many of them are doubling down like Jake
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:24.800]  Tapper did. CNN spread all kinds of fake news. Some of the
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:28.640]  leading fake news stories were spread by CNN. CNN was the one that was out there
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:32.000]  saying that Manafort had personally met Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  Embassy, quoting the Guardian story. It's all just knowingly made up.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.600]  Precisely. Completely fictitious from beginning to end. So my point is people
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:43.280]  that believe folks that have lied to them about WMDs, Gulf of Tonkin,
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:47.760]  Northwoods, the Covington kids, Kavanaugh hearings,
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:51.920]  Russiagate, you know, all these other small it.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:56.480]  The left especially is always, and I know the right wing stages things sometimes
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:00.160]  too, but what is it about the left in history where they just are, they
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:03.840]  always are staging stuff. I would call the Nazis left because they were
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:07.680]  national socialists. They were always staging false flags. Oh yeah, almost nobody
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:10.640]  stage things more often than the Nazis did, including the burning down the
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:12.800]  Reichstag that gave them the power in the first place
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:16.080]  to destroy democratic institutions in Germany. An Operation Hemler to start
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:19.360]  World War II? Precisely. So the people think the Nazis
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:22.160]  were elected to the power. They were not. They used false narratives
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:26.640]  in Jesse Smollett style, grand scales, staged events to seize power away from
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:30.080]  democratic institutions. They had newsreels every day. Jews beat up and killed a
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.720]  three-year-old German boy. I mean it was the same
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:35.520]  crap. Every kind of. They didn't hung the poor German boy.
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:39.040]  I mean just one fake thing after the next fake thing and they used it to seize
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:42.160]  and control power and I think what the left understands and because the left is
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:44.960]  more statist and because they're more statist what the left of the
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:48.000]  Nazis have in common and the fascists have in common as they believed in the
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.120]  state as the centralizing institution and that's what sort of libertarian.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:54.640]  The state is God under communism, socialism, fascism.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:58.080]  Precisely and because they're so status they understand the need for narrative.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:00.480]  They understand propaganda and its role and its tool.
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:03.040]  They understand that's why they love secret intelligence. That's why they love
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:06.960]  the Stasi and the KGB have their worst reputations
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:10.160]  under communist or statist rule. It's the same with the fascist and the
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:13.280]  fascist. They could just inflate totally made up hysterics.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:16.400]  Precisely and they understand the need for narrative to control narrative to
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.040]  motivate moral panic. And that's why they admit you've met with
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:22.800]  some of the top editors in the country that they we don't. The establishment
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.440]  doesn't want Jones to put out a counter narrative
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:28.560]  because we've noticed his audience has been enough to challenge a narrative.
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:34.320]  He's messing up our future narratives. It's just incredible and then now
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.200]  they're pushing for even more censorship and I don't know if you can say the names
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:39.840]  of the groups but you met with major editors and they said no we've been
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:43.680]  told by the lawyers we're getting funded to take Jones out as a
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:46.160]  kill shot. Precisely that was their exact words that
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:49.120]  they're not using this lawsuit to seek any recovery
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:52.080]  for other people but that what the media had been told main
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:55.600]  of high-ranking reporters and editors with major publications
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:00.240]  was that this lawsuit was a kill shot on you and a kill shot on independent
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:03.840]  press in the country of this kind. And these are people who are politically
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:07.200]  antithetical to your positions politically hostile to your audience
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:10.240]  and they recognize that if the acute case was handled in the way they thought
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:13.120]  should be handled correctly legally the case would be dismissed.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:16.000]  That this is about what what you're seeing and what you were describing is
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.800]  sort of the reactions that people have to constant fake to being
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:22.400]  smoleted over and over and over again is what you see in people who dealt with
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:26.080]  it in the institutional status press. So people in Russia people in Cuba today
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:29.440]  don't believe anything their government tells them even if a third of it at
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:32.480]  least or half of it may be true because they're so used and accustomed.
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:35.760]  Because you can't and I'm saying living in authoritarian regime
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:38.800]  historians have said is like being mentally ill because you don't know
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:41.920]  what's true and that's what I was saying they took it and spun it that I'm
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:45.200]  saying I'm literally mentally ill. Exactly I mean they wanted to spin it
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.680]  the way they wanted to spin it in order to be on a constant effort to
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:50.560]  de-platform and to fame you and to destroy your audience and the
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:53.840]  ability of the independent press to functionally operate economically
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:56.880]  socially and politically in the country. I want to get to those clips as I
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.640]  mentioned and then we'll get a prelude to a video we're
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:03.760]  going to shoot tonight we're doing more tomorrow about intel I've got and about
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:06.160]  where the president's going and the fact that he is going to move against big
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:09.360]  tech we've now been told these are from good sources and
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:12.880]  that he is going to move with the criminal action
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:15.760]  the media spins that I mean we're going to be criminals no I mean criminal
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:19.360]  justice system they use the I guess the general public's lack of
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:22.880]  understanding of verbiage to say that I want violence when I say
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:26.560]  we'd use the criminal justice system no I mean Trump is preparing to move against
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:30.560]  them and what you expect the deep state to do to counteract that
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:35.040]  Bob Barnes great lawyer smart guy is with us and then

[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:35.920]  so i have a couple clips i'm going to play here from uh the deposition if you
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:42.480]  call it that that the texas lawyers and there's
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:47.840]  five sandy hook lawsuits against me it's all run out of canada kit at the same
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:52.160]  firm senator bloominthal and his son their quarterback against senator
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:54.640]  murphy's openly involved in framing me everywhere
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:57.120]  this is high level and they admit it's to get rid of the free speech for
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:00.480]  conservatives that's why it affects you it affects everybody else
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:04.160]  and a lot of folks are starting to get this like laura ingram and
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:08.160]  childhandy and tucker carlsson but even people above them and bob can't get into
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:10.800]  the all the details but he's got a lot of the inside baseball
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.680]  so do i but people are now really understanding the real shape of this
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:15.840]  they thought they were going to creep through with all this they're not going
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:21.520]  to do it big stuff is about to happen but here here i am talking about how the
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:24.960]  media lies to us and how when we're living under an authoritarianism
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.280]  it becomes almost like a form of psychosis because you don't know what's
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.320]  real anymore and i talk about this all the time it doesn't mean
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:36.560]  i agree i've been diagnosed as as as being psychotic
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:43.200]  not the case so here it is do you think that there's a question
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:47.680]  that i should have asked you today in deposition that i didn't
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:51.280]  i'm not sure what should
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:53.280]  uh
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:57.280]  what should you should ask
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:11.040]  okay mr. jones you would agree with me that
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:15.520]  when some damage happens when you break something
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:19.280]  when you you cause something to be lost
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:22.560]  when you hurt somebody whether it's intentional
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:26.240]  or whether it's a mistake there's consequences for that
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:30.480]  right people should be accountable for the people they hurt
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:33.440]  objection is to form
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:39.920]  well sometimes people claim they've been hurt and they haven't been
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:43.840]  so you have to look at the agenda behind things you have to balance things
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:47.520]  about why is the mainstream media lied so much why have governments lied so much
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:50.080]  the fact that the public doesn't believe what they're told anymore and
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:53.280]  we're going to criminalize questioning jessie spolleter
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:57.280]  wmds or babies and incubators and it really is the fact that we've allowed
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:01.600]  the government and institutions to become so corrupt that people lost
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:05.280]  any compass of what's real and i've you know
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:09.200]  by myself have you almost had like a form of psychosis back in the past where i
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:12.400]  basically thought everything was staged you know i've now learned a lot of times
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:16.480]  things aren't staged so you know i think as a pundit and someone giving
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:19.760]  opinion that you know my opinions have been
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:23.360]  wrong but they were never wrong consciously to hurt people
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:27.040]  and so i think it's part of that process of me growing up
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:30.240]  in rockwall texas and watching the police deal drugs and then conduct
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:34.000]  anti-drug programs at the school i think that should my opinion of police in
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.040]  general and i was very anti law enforcement until i
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:39.760]  grew up and learned more things and now i'm pretty much pro police
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:44.000]  so it's it's it's it's been a process
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:49.440]  bob i said it's something almost like a form
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:52.960]  when when you've been lied to and so many things are fake
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:56.080]  you then start digging everything's fake that's a very honest response oh
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:59.200]  absolutely it's very authentic it's very correct it's very accurate it's very
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:02.640]  descriptive uh it's intended to communicate precisely what
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:04.720]  happened and how it happened and why it happened
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:08.240]  and it reflects what happens when the institutional media is the exclusive
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:11.840]  monopolistic gatekeeper of any kind of story framework
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:15.760]  where people in the 1950s we all believe what the news media was telling us so
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:18.880]  like in los vegas where i live people would go out and have little picnics
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:21.520]  while the nuclear bombs went off and they would watch them together
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:26.160]  and eisenhower specifically directed the local people to the local media of
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:29.520]  the military press operation to not tell people that they could get
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:33.120]  contamination and die and what we had like double the rate of
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:36.400]  uh cancers that were that in fact john wane thought he got that because he
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:39.040]  thought it was safe and filmed a movie there that year
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:43.040]  precisely so this is i mean taking in our african-american military and he
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:45.840]  believed the government absolutely we took in our
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:49.520]  african-american military veterans and used them as test subjects for various
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:53.360]  drugs and products and diseases we we've done horrific things operation
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:57.200]  northwoods was a joint chief of staff approved event 1961
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:01.280]  they went to the president united states who luckily rejected it but but said
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:04.960]  let's do false flags let's stage events and let's blame foreign
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:08.080]  governments for our own domestic terrorism and his brother bobby though
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:12.960]  accepted a counterplan to bomb the u.s embassy in honduras uh to have a coup
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:15.680]  there but then that got shut down well you have i mean when you have people
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:18.560]  who are working for united fruit company like the dole's brothers and then they
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:22.160]  go in and have high-ranking positions of power within the institutional law
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:25.520]  enforcement and intelligence superstructures and they're engaged in
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:29.440]  helping their corporate clients and get rich off of coups then you have an
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:33.200]  extraordinary set of events so it's very natural for a lot of americans to have
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:36.240]  deep doubts about the institutional narratives they've been told
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:40.080]  just like those who were were willing to be skeptical of the russia gate story
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:43.600]  over the last two years it turned out they were right and again a psychosis
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:47.840]  is only where you can't differentiate reality it could be on one issue
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:52.000]  a hundred issues like people that have been attacked by a certain color pit bull
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.880]  they see a pit bull cut on the street they get scared and run off
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:58.320]  it's a psychosis because they don't know that dog's going to attack them
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:03.360]  but it's a real natural form of insanity because they've been attacked by something
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:06.960]  that looked like that before absolutely i mean the damage as even people on the
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:10.400]  left people like erin mate at the nation people like glenn greenwald at the
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:13.280]  intercept people like michael tracy's be part of the young turks
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:16.640]  are all saying the media has done more damage to the credibility of the media
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:19.840]  where they're pushing the russian collusion delusion than any single media
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:23.040]  accents the 1950s and i think this is bigger
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:26.000]  because the redscare there were actual comedies they were going after they went
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.600]  too far sometimes but there was really something going on precisely this time
[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:34.080]  there's just nothing this is a p donald trump getting paid off anybody that
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:39.280]  dude doesn't trust anybody that was that was absurd from day one
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:42.640]  all of it was it was ludicrous on top of ludicrous but what they were trying to
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:47.200]  do was to provoke a potential conflict with the world's other largest nuclear
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:49.360]  power exactly and if you think trump would go in a
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:52.560]  hotel room and get pissed on you're crazy precisely no nothing oh let me set
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:55.120]  myself up and go in a russian hotel room and be peed on
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:58.400]  say this guy who's very paranoid and is a and is a clean he's obsessed with clean
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:01.360]  freak absolutely the he has a little bit of howard hughes in
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:04.640]  him in that regard so everybody knew that story was fake that knew anything
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:07.680]  about trump or that knew anything about russia and yet they propagated it
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:11.280]  repeatedly routinely by the way he was howard he he made himself get over it
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:14.800]  with basically a version therapy but that's a big secret about trump is he
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:18.240]  was he would have to leave you around a woman for weeks and weeks and like
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:21.200]  this time before he could even be with a marquessum then he kind of got wild and
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:24.880]  got over that but the point is is that i mean trump used to be howard hughes
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:27.680]  oh yeah he didn't like to shake anyone's hands i mean that was one well known
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:30.320]  about him so it was extraordinary in the campaign his ability to
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:34.160]  shut uh talk to strangers and shake him well he got over it he did he forced it
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:36.640]  but the but anybody that he wants to get pissed on
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:39.280]  no he's absurd and hey but we're almost out of time we're going to shoot a
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:42.400]  special report tonight that's going to air later at about nine o'clock or so we
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:45.760]  have some big exclusive when i say exclusive it's too big to even get to
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:49.200]  we ran out of time here but let's play this one more clip
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:52.880]  uh because you do a great job here this is you off camera when bankston this
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:55.920]  funny guy starts asking about bowls of chili and stuff and the whole
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:59.840]  internet's on fire about this here it is um that's
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:03.200]  for my memory not what happens i can't comment on hypotheticals
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:07.200]  oh so if if i was to say to you if somebody was to come along
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:11.600]  and strike your hand with a hammer would it hurt you can't answer that question
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:15.120]  objection is to i'm not striking anybody with hammers if i asked you if i gave
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:19.280]  you a big bowl of chili might it affect your memory you can't answer that that's
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:23.840]  hypothetical correct you're just not going to answer
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:26.560]  those kind of questions
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:35.120]  i'll take it that's now let's move on i'll take it that wasn't i mean yeah that's
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:38.160]  the question is that's a common that's not a question i this has been coming
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:41.760]  one of the most harassing again this is for tv and for pr not for a
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:45.120]  legitimate suit that's what this is that's all this is you want to put it on
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:48.560]  tv that's all this is just a show and it's a bad show
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:52.400]  at that to show how not to be a lawyer in deposition of a case
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:56.160]  show i mean if you want to be fair and you want to ask real questions go ahead
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:00.160]  but always don't make comments and then try to reinterpret those comments as a
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:04.400]  question and then try to put words in the mouth of the witness
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:10.240]  first of your law students should know that what was your objection the
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:13.440]  objection was to your comment saying that there was an answer and my point was
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:15.920]  you didn't ask a question so there couldn't have been an answer and that
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:19.040]  was objective for the record purposes that no answer is given to a question that
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:22.400]  not going to ask do you maybe want to take a break so we
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:25.840]  can have a few breaths yes maybe yeah you might need to do that
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:29.600]  yeah yeah absolutely maybe you can go back and read how to ask people questions
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.480]  what do you think's going on there i mean everything was just about getting
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:35.760]  other news articles yeah precisely this was not a serious
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:39.920]  lawyer asking serious questions about a serious deposition it was purely a pr
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:43.040]  strategy of a pr campaign about a suit that does not have a
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:45.600]  religion the families think about this because i know they've kind of been
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:49.040]  cloistered in her fed by these folks that he's torturing you
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:52.400]  he's coming after you he's going to get you and none of that's been going on
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.960]  ever correct all of those stories that have come out
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:57.920]  of the press have always been false there's never been any targeting of any
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:01.440]  families never any desire to hurt or harass any families by us
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:04.400]  it precisely absolutely in fact there's been constant criticism of people who
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:08.160]  were trying to do that so the that's always been sort of a mythology but
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:12.160]  here you have a lawyer who he was making faces juvenile reactions
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:15.760]  throughout the deposition let's just show what he was doing this
