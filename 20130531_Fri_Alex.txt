[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:31.640]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:31.640 --> 00:42.760]  It is Friday, the 31st day of May 2013. We are going to be live here for the next three
[00:42.760 --> 00:47.920]  hours, Lord willing, and take your phone calls. No guests today, though we're gonna have Christie
[00:47.920 --> 00:52.800]  Hightower in here with some of the planetinfullwars.com Ask Alex questions that we're gonna do live
[00:52.800 --> 00:57.280]  on air instead of taping for the nightly news. So that's coming up at the bottom of the next
[00:57.280 --> 01:06.000]  hour. We're working on a breaking story at infoawars.com that is hiding in plain view
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.920]  at the Justice Department and their own website.
[01:10.920 --> 01:21.480]  And so later in the transmission, we will premiere a special report and a news article
[01:21.480 --> 01:24.820]  that when they came to me yesterday, they said, hey, we just wanna run this report by
[01:24.820 --> 01:30.560]  you before we put it on air. And I said, well, why? I usually don't do the editorial reviewing
[01:30.560 --> 01:35.560]  around here. Fact checking, we have other crew that do that. And they said, well, this
[01:35.560 --> 01:41.440]  is talking about how the Justice Department is saying don't use the words husband or wife
[01:41.440 --> 01:45.700]  cuz it's offensive if you work in the federal government.
[01:45.700 --> 01:50.760]  And is it too extreme to point out they're doing this? And I said, absolutely. We're
[01:50.760 --> 01:58.160]  so politically correct. We think men are bad, women are bad, and heterosexuals are evil.
[01:58.160 --> 02:03.120]  And so we're not gonna air this report. Of course, I'm being sarcastic. I said the report
[02:03.120 --> 02:08.080]  isn't hardcore enough. I was reading this Justice Department manual.
[02:08.080 --> 02:15.780]  And it basically says the words husband and wife are hate speech. It's hurtful and so
[02:15.780 --> 02:19.560]  don't use it. And what is hate speech? Something that's hurtful. And of course, I am the king
[02:19.560 --> 02:28.800]  of hate speech, as you know. And I'm really offended by this because I personally don't
[02:28.800 --> 02:35.820]  dislike people for what color they are or who they're attracted to unless they're attracted
[02:35.820 --> 02:36.820]  to children.
[02:36.820 --> 02:41.920]  And of course, the government is always attracted to children to make them slaves of the system
[02:41.920 --> 02:46.480]  or to abuse them. Every authoritarian system has been attracted to them. And now the state
[02:46.480 --> 02:50.840]  says it's the parents and that's happening worldwide. So it's very offensive on that
[02:50.840 --> 02:51.840]  front.
[02:51.840 --> 02:56.440]  And it is an attack on the human institution itself. The state wants to create a brave
[02:56.440 --> 03:00.580]  new world where parenthood is ended for the general public. And they're setting up an
[03:00.580 --> 03:05.000]  economy basically where your child's gonna be in a government training center 16, 17,
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.560]  18 hours a day, 12 months out of the year.
[03:09.560 --> 03:14.060]  Parents are there just to reproduce for now to produce more minions for the state. But
[03:14.060 --> 03:17.600]  humans really aren't needed anymore because the computers and robots. So that's what's
[03:17.600 --> 03:25.800]  really happening here. It's not about equality. It's not about being nice to people. It's
[03:25.800 --> 03:33.560]  about a globalist dehumanization population reduction program where 4% of the population
[03:33.560 --> 03:39.720]  that's reportedly gay or lesbian is used as a pawn and a set piece for an anti-human eugenics
[03:39.720 --> 03:40.720]  agenda.
[03:40.720 --> 03:44.480]  And let me tell you, they're telling people, by the way, you think we're joking that this
[03:44.480 --> 03:49.040]  report's coming to be posted on infoawards.com about an hour. We'll play the report coming
[03:49.040 --> 03:54.400]  up in the next hour. And France set to ban the words mother and father from official
[03:54.400 --> 03:58.840]  documents. That was the London Telegraph. Remember that a few months ago?
[03:58.840 --> 04:03.240]  And we found in England where they're doing the same thing. This is a global program.
[04:03.240 --> 04:09.480]  But federal employees, this is on the DOJ website. And our tipsters sent it to us. No
[04:09.480 --> 04:17.720]  one's picked this up. It turns out for about a year they've been saying, you are to tell
[04:17.720 --> 04:21.920]  everybody that works for the federal government not to say I'm going to pick my husband up
[04:21.920 --> 04:23.560]  or I'm going to pick my wife up.
[04:23.560 --> 04:31.560]  Those are hate words. See, this is how this works, folks. It's a system where anything,
[04:31.560 --> 04:38.780]  see being quote normal is now abnormal. And then you're not allowed to be a parent. You're
[04:38.780 --> 04:42.920]  not allowed as a man to be attracted to a woman. You're not because that creates children.
[04:42.920 --> 04:47.400]  You're not allowed to do that as a woman to be attracted to a man. You will. I mean, that's
[04:47.400 --> 04:51.520]  why the children's shows all teach the kids that they teach five year olds how to masturbate
[04:51.520 --> 04:57.440]  in public schools. This is a pervert guild on a low level. They're the cannon fodder.
[04:57.440 --> 05:00.240]  The social engineers on top is about population reduction.

[07:04.400 --> 07:08.200]  even if I had a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led
[07:08.200 --> 07:13.020]  me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United
[07:13.020 --> 07:18.120]  States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all
[07:18.120 --> 07:23.440]  of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight
[07:23.440 --> 07:29.080]  off cancer and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out
[07:29.080 --> 07:34.160]  there and discovered Younggevity. The Younggevity products are designed to give you the real
[07:34.160 --> 07:39.400]  nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[08:06.200 --> 08:12.280]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[08:12.280 --> 08:33.520]  to Alex Jones. It is the 31st day of May 2013. We're about to pass the meridian into the
[08:33.520 --> 08:46.840]  second half of 2013 as we accelerate into the future. I was looking at headlines on
[08:46.840 --> 08:53.880]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, DrudgeReport.com and they just make my head spin. Coming up,
[08:53.880 --> 09:00.480]  I'm going to get into this report that came out at the end of the broadcast yesterday.
[09:00.480 --> 09:10.680]  This imposed security lockdown for Bilderberg 2013 and they are saying that basically all
[09:10.680 --> 09:18.720]  around the entire multi-thousand acre compound, it was a former royal palace that's a luxury
[09:18.720 --> 09:23.800]  hotel that no pedestrians are allowed and that people that live in the area must show
[09:23.800 --> 09:30.480]  IDs to be able to walk down the street. So it's North Korean martial law and they're
[09:30.480 --> 09:35.840]  saying there'll be a small area inside the grounds where you'll be allowed to be at and
[09:35.840 --> 09:41.120]  that this is a great luxury and then you have to have a permit to be able to have a event
[09:41.120 --> 09:49.640]  in the town and rural area of Watford, northwest of London because it's such a free country
[09:49.640 --> 09:51.120]  and those permits are being denied.
[09:51.120 --> 09:54.560]  Well, let me tell you what's happening. David Icke's put out a statement. Whether you love
[09:54.560 --> 09:58.560]  David Icke or hate him, he's a very interesting guy and he can get six, seven thousand people
[09:58.560 --> 10:04.300]  out to see him in London. I can get six or seven thousand people out as well in any major
[10:04.300 --> 10:10.320]  city in the western world and we've not really promoted it. I've not really promoted it because
[10:10.320 --> 10:14.240]  a group was trying to set up an event. I said, I'm going to be there as press covering this.
[10:14.240 --> 10:18.320]  There'll be demonstrators there, but I'm coming to try to document which globalists are going
[10:18.320 --> 10:23.600]  in and the fact that Bilderberg group that they've said for 50 years or more didn't exist
[10:23.600 --> 10:27.000]  and if you talked about it, you were insane and the New York Times has said it doesn't
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.560]  exist and I'm insane and Nightline has said it doesn't exist and I'm insane and there's
[10:31.560 --> 10:36.800]  no global government, there's no mega bankers and there's no global price fixing or stock
[10:36.800 --> 10:41.200]  market manipulation and there's no interest rate fixing.
[10:41.200 --> 10:45.180]  All of that's now come out and there's no NSA spying. All of that's come out and there's
[10:45.180 --> 10:49.500]  no secret arrest or government hit squads. All of that's come out and there's no government
[10:49.500 --> 10:56.120]  drug dealing and all of that's come out. It's basically all come out and then I want to
[10:56.120 --> 11:02.820]  go cover it and I've got different police agencies emailing us, calling us, asking what
[11:02.820 --> 11:03.820]  we're planning to do.
[11:03.820 --> 11:08.940]  They all know full well and if anybody stirs up trouble, it's them and the mayor of Watford,
[11:08.940 --> 11:13.320]  this woman is in the news going, I just want to say I'm honored Bilderberg has chosen us
[11:13.320 --> 11:20.480]  that we are fancy enough, prestigious enough was the word and I just think it's terrible
[11:20.480 --> 11:24.280]  there's gonna be media and protesters and I think they'll be violent.
[11:24.280 --> 11:28.520]  She said that three weeks ago, prejudicing everybody and if they have to provocateur
[11:28.520 --> 11:33.200]  something they will. So great, regardless, they claim they're gonna let me into England,
[11:33.200 --> 11:37.280]  all this other stuff, regardless of what they do, it doesn't matter. I want everybody in
[11:37.280 --> 11:43.880]  the UK and in the British Isles to get to Watford all next week through the weekend
[11:43.880 --> 11:50.520]  and to cover this event and to exercise your Magna Carta rights paid for in blood against
[11:50.520 --> 11:53.080]  the criminal Bilderberg group.
[11:53.080 --> 11:57.960]  Their members have been indicted for war crimes, they've been arrested for war crimes. Lockheed
[11:57.960 --> 12:03.920]  Martin bid rigging, ripping off taxpayers. I mean, this is a criminal horde that they
[12:03.920 --> 12:09.280]  said didn't exist with British royalty and Dutch royalty and all these people sneaking
[12:09.280 --> 12:15.080]  in and Secret Service driving by five years ago in Virginia and aiming MP5s at us.
[12:15.080 --> 12:18.660]  I was talking to an Esquire writer and he goes, well, you were protesting, they wanted
[12:18.660 --> 12:22.280]  to let you know that they were gonna protect themselves. If I pointed a gun at them, I
[12:22.280 --> 12:29.140]  would have been arrested, folks. But the Esquire writer, he's like, Alex, they needed to point
[12:29.140 --> 12:34.000]  the gun at you, they needed to point the gun at you to let you know. That's right, I'm
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  a commoner.
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.320]  I mean, drive by, point, Secret Service, I'm there bullhorning them. How about we just
[12:40.320 --> 12:46.600]  lift up and show me an MP5 like I'm going to soil myself and fall down on the ground.
[12:46.600 --> 12:51.040]  In fact, I didn't even wanna go to England, but listeners and my wife and so many others
[12:51.040 --> 12:56.600]  said, you gotta go, Jim Tucker just died. You gotta go, it's important, you've exposed
[12:56.600 --> 13:00.040]  it, we forced it out in the open, you gotta go. And I said, okay, I thought I would just
[13:00.040 --> 13:02.520]  send reporters, and now I really wanna go.
[13:02.520 --> 13:09.240]  So I'm gonna talk about this at the bottom of the hour. But it is your duty if you live
[13:09.240 --> 13:15.800]  in the UK to go to Watford. It is your duty if you live in France, or Deutschland, or
[13:15.800 --> 13:23.040]  the Netherlands, or anywhere in Western Europe, and you can just fly over for 50, 100 euros
[13:23.040 --> 13:28.200]  depending on where you're at. You can go into the channel, you can drive in, it is your
[13:28.200 --> 13:33.560]  duty now to go to Bilderberg 2013.
[13:33.560 --> 13:40.160]  And they're erecting a steel fence around just thousands and thousands. You can go to
[13:40.160 --> 13:44.080]  the maps the police have released, thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands.
[13:44.080 --> 13:50.080]  It looks like miles of steel barricades for a group that doesn't matter. And we've had
[13:50.080 --> 13:54.640]  national British TV respond to us and go, we're not sending reporters because this isn't
[13:54.640 --> 13:55.640]  important.
[13:55.640 --> 14:02.800]  Yeah, 150 royals and billionaires and the head of Google and the head of Facebook and
[14:02.800 --> 14:09.880]  all these people meeting in secret with prime ministers and presidents. We stayed in the
[14:09.880 --> 14:14.080]  hotel. Now they make you get out like a day and a half before, but we stayed in.
[14:14.080 --> 14:17.600]  They kick you out at noon, people start arriving three or four. We stayed in the hotel and
[14:17.600 --> 14:21.240]  videotaped the president of Spain arriving before they bang on the door and threw us
[14:21.240 --> 14:26.160]  out five years ago. And he gets out of the limousine and they play the Spanish national
[14:26.160 --> 14:30.400]  anthem and he goes in and then we drive out of the parking lot.
[14:30.400 --> 14:34.680]  They got guys in black sedans following us and green sedans following us and I pull in
[14:34.680 --> 14:38.760]  a parking lot, get out, the guys have shaved head sunglasses. I go over to them, they drive
[14:38.760 --> 14:43.440]  off scared like I'm supposed to be scared of you, like I did something wrong. I don't
[14:43.440 --> 14:49.120]  ship in the opium. I don't load the three-year-old kids on the C-130s in the Balkans to be flown
[14:49.120 --> 14:53.960]  into Russia or Italy that had to be raped and then snuff filmed.
[14:53.960 --> 14:58.520]  I'm not working for the people that do all that. I have nothing to worry about. I'm not
[14:58.520 --> 15:06.360]  scared of you. Torture me, set me up. They just killed Malcolm X's grandson down in Mexico.
[15:06.360 --> 15:10.680]  Now it's mainstream news that they shot this guy multiple times who was a witness of the
[15:10.680 --> 15:15.160]  fact that these guys were patsies. Two of the FBI guys investigating it, they fell out
[15:15.160 --> 15:20.920]  of a helicopter. They're killing everybody just like Pat Tillman, just like 30 something
[15:20.920 --> 15:26.540]  of SEAL Team 6, 23 in the helicopter, then like five more, three more, two more.
[15:26.540 --> 15:31.860]  They're gonna kill everybody in SEAL Team 6. What, you just think you guys are the only
[15:31.860 --> 15:38.280]  ones out killing people? You're totally expendable. In fact, they want you dead after you've served
[15:38.280 --> 15:44.640]  them. You are an obsolete weapon system to be spiked like a cannon, to be leaded like
[15:44.640 --> 15:54.440]  a barrel. There is no honor amongst these New World Order scumbags.
[15:54.440 --> 15:58.640]  Speaking of New World Order scumbags, I'm gonna go to this, kinda refocus, come back
[15:58.640 --> 16:04.280]  and get a bunch of the news. Here is a little Don Henley piece of a dirty laundry that our
[16:04.280 --> 16:08.680]  own Darren McBrain put together with some clips of just some of the recent mainstream
[16:08.680 --> 16:15.520]  media, dinosaur media, kleptocrat media, decepticon media, sewer stream media, narcissist, pimp,
[16:15.520 --> 16:19.840]  dying media, attacking yours truly.
[16:19.840 --> 16:25.240]  And we will go to this clip, and then go to break and come back and I will get into all
[16:25.240 --> 16:27.400]  the off the chart world news.
[16:27.400 --> 16:32.960]  What you just saw there was a Cambridge, Massachusetts native attacking one of the reporters and
[16:32.960 --> 16:37.920]  I used the term loosely for info wars. What a ridiculous argument. Don't try what your
[16:37.920 --> 16:42.520]  ancestors did before. Why don't you come to America, I'll take you out shooting, you can
[16:42.520 --> 16:50.720]  become an American and join the Republic. You finished? 1776 will commence again if
[16:50.720 --> 16:56.620]  you try to take our firearms. That sounds like the ravings of a fascist. Challenge Alex
[16:56.620 --> 17:02.320]  Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop him. I'd love
[17:02.320 --> 17:22.920]  to see that in uniform.
[17:22.920 --> 17:42.320]  Alex Jones is using this so he can be more popular and more people will talk about it.
[17:42.320 --> 17:47.920]  Hate speech. Now Facebook is apologizing for allowing it worldwide. But can anything be
[17:47.920 --> 17:49.800]  done to stop the hatred?
[17:49.800 --> 17:54.840]  And yes, the conspiracy theory about the government having too many bullets is nuts. But it's
[17:54.840 --> 17:59.320]  not out of nowhere. That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories
[17:59.320 --> 18:03.760]  that can seduce Republicans. It's an internet talk show called info wars.
[18:03.760 --> 18:10.960]  We're on over 150 stations, which, and XM, as if being internet's bad. We were sponsored
[18:10.960 --> 18:17.400]  by the people, not by scum globalists like your offshore banker masters, Matt Al. I'm
[18:17.400 --> 18:21.080]  proud of the fact that came from nowhere.
[18:21.080 --> 18:26.720]  And every tragedy, the info wars, Alex Jones world thinks they see a conspiracy. Monday's
[18:26.720 --> 18:31.520]  devastating record-breaking tornado in Moore, Oklahoma killed two dozen people and flattened
[18:31.520 --> 18:36.800]  a community. You're a liar. I never said the government did that. But now I'm not kidding.
[18:36.800 --> 18:41.320]  The same conspiracy theory folks are peddling the idea that the tornado was a conspiracy.
[18:41.320 --> 18:45.760]  You're lying. Seriously. The tornado was a conspiracy.
[18:45.760 --> 18:50.320]  I've seen these info war people on and off, and I kind of have been ignoring them doing
[18:50.320 --> 18:57.120]  a good job doing that. And to me, the info wars, whatever that show is, has become the
[18:57.120 --> 18:58.960]  Westboro Baptist church of journalism.
[18:58.960 --> 19:05.280]  They're totally scared of independent media because they're dying. They're dying.
[19:05.280 --> 19:11.760]  False flag. And by false flag, he means a cloak and dagger, super extra double top secret
[19:11.760 --> 19:16.320]  black ops operation that the government carries out in such a way as to make it look like
[19:16.320 --> 19:21.080]  the operation was done by somebody else. He means the US government bombed Boston.
[19:21.080 --> 19:25.040]  I think it's an overreaction, but also you're making some very serious allegations against
[19:25.040 --> 19:29.600]  the US government saying that they stage attacks. They allow them to occur in the United States
[19:29.600 --> 19:34.760]  against us. What? No. What evidence do you have to support any of that?
[19:34.760 --> 19:41.040]  The Gulf of Tonkin is very, very well documented. Somebody came up to me just two days ago and
[19:41.040 --> 19:48.240]  said, uh, we just bought like 1.5 billion rounds Homeland security. And I said, I don't
[19:48.240 --> 19:54.040]  know, it might be. Um, well, I got it from info wars and I'm like, okay, well then I
[19:54.040 --> 19:57.720]  can tell you right now, it's most likely not.
[19:57.720 --> 20:00.800]  That's right. There's no new world order. We'll be right back.
[20:00.800 --> 20:05.560]  Travel so much and having a fake TV gives added peace of mind.
[20:05.560 --> 20:11.920]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional
[20:11.920 --> 20:15.240]  burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[20:15.240 --> 20:20.320]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near
[20:20.320 --> 20:24.880]  a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is on watching
[20:24.880 --> 20:30.720]  TV when I'm actually away from home. Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet, just
[20:30.720 --> 20:34.560]  like a light on a timer. And they're so easy to use. You just plug
[20:34.560 --> 20:38.880]  them in and they're ready to go. Plus they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and
[20:38.880 --> 20:43.400]  downstairs. Fake TV is only 29 95 with free shipping. Order
[20:43.400 --> 20:53.720]  your fake TV by calling 8 7 7 5 fake TV or go to fake tv.com. That's 8 7 7 5 3 2 5 3
[20:53.720 --> 21:02.920]  8 8 or fake tv.com fake TV, the burglar deterrent. There's been a disaster and most of you don't
[21:02.920 --> 21:08.200]  even realize the serious concern for all of us. Alex Jones has warned you for years to
[21:08.200 --> 21:13.680]  get the most important supply you can for your liberty, freedom and security. And that's
[21:13.680 --> 21:18.560]  food. We thought the danger was drought or food diverted to our gas tanks or food so
[21:18.560 --> 21:23.960]  expensive that we'd all need financial assistance to afford it or our food being sold to other
[21:23.960 --> 21:28.560]  countries. But here's the most effective way you'll lose your liberty and security without
[21:28.560 --> 21:34.000]  a fight. Government regulation. The do it yourself public services of many LDS Mormon
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.480]  food storage canneries can no longer be provided. This along with the recent private gardening
[21:39.480 --> 21:44.980]  and farming regulations and additional government control of food supplies and resources says
[21:44.980 --> 21:50.480]  food is the ultimate priority. E foods direct will provide free shipping on all food orders

[23:40.960 --> 23:44.360]  bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than
[23:44.360 --> 23:48.160]  a standing army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains
[23:48.160 --> 23:56.500]  our monetary system. Call for your copy, 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237.
[23:56.500 --> 24:11.680]  It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237.
[24:26.500 --> 24:32.160]  By the way, in my little stack of news here, the announcement has been made that starting
[24:32.160 --> 24:39.800]  next week, you will be getting notices in your mail, your snail mail from the federal
[24:39.800 --> 24:44.800]  government that your insurance has been canceled and that you've got to go renegotiate it under
[24:44.800 --> 24:51.080]  their terms. And that's why Forbes, Reuters, all of them have reported that the major insurance
[24:51.080 --> 24:58.280]  commission made up of the lobbyists of the big foreign-owned banking-owned insurance
[24:58.280 --> 25:03.240]  companies that this year the rates are doubling on average.
[25:03.240 --> 25:07.720]  This is meant to bankrupt the country. But hey, don't worry. Yours is only going to double
[25:07.720 --> 25:11.680]  on average and then government will say what treatment you can get. So you'll pay more
[25:11.680 --> 25:17.720]  and get less because foreign banks run Obama. But he is a Peace Prize winner. Obamacare,
[25:17.720 --> 25:28.840]  146% rate hike in California. Isn't that nice? So that's what we have to look forward to.
[25:28.840 --> 25:35.800]  That's out of Forbes. But the Marines, though, who are busy growing the opium over in Afghanistan
[25:35.800 --> 25:40.720]  and fighting the al-Qaeda and Taliban, the globalist created, they don't get hot meals
[25:40.720 --> 25:41.720]  anymore.
[25:41.720 --> 25:46.080]  And they're complaining about that. And they shouldn't complain about that because Obama
[25:46.080 --> 25:50.880]  needs to have a million dollar a day vacations and the vice president half million dollar
[25:50.880 --> 25:57.680]  a day vacations. But Marines angry at loss of hot meals in Afghanistan. Well, you don't
[25:57.680 --> 26:03.760]  get hot meals ever. Now, they were only getting them every couple days.
[26:03.760 --> 26:12.600]  You don't get those now. The drawdown diet, Marines esteemed by loss of hot meals at Afghanistan
[26:12.600 --> 26:19.640]  base. Now, you should ought to be seen about the GMO aspartame stuff and all the deadly
[26:19.640 --> 26:23.560]  shots you're given. But hey, you'll get back and have health problems soon enough they
[26:23.560 --> 26:25.140]  won't give you aid for.
[26:25.140 --> 26:29.560]  And then just get ready to die and to have mentally retarded and deformed children. I'm
[26:29.560 --> 26:35.200]  sad that's happening, but I need to warn you, they give you a soft kill injection when you're
[26:35.200 --> 26:38.440]  in the military, a whole bunch of stuff. And they test stuff on you and everything else
[26:38.440 --> 26:42.720]  because the globalists around America and their number one enemy is veterans.
[26:42.720 --> 26:47.400]  That's why they say the number one terror threat is veterans. In fact, they just popped
[26:47.400 --> 26:54.320]  up the article. Let's put up that info wars.com article. And then it's got a link there to
[26:54.320 --> 26:59.040]  the Obama announcement Obamacare to begin automatically canceling private health insurance
[26:59.040 --> 27:00.560]  policies.
[27:00.560 --> 27:04.700]  Remember how Obama said if you liked your health care plan, you could keep your health
[27:04.700 --> 27:10.480]  care plan? He also said he wouldn't hire any lobbyists or was gonna not sign the NDAA and
[27:10.480 --> 27:15.040]  about 100 other lies. Yeah, well, never mind, he didn't really mean it. Start watching your
[27:15.040 --> 27:22.160]  email or your snail mail because in the next few weeks and months, Obamacare is going to
[27:22.160 --> 27:27.560]  start automatically canceling private health care policies.
[27:27.560 --> 27:33.400]  And there's a federal minimum health care insurance requirement. So now you're made
[27:33.400 --> 27:37.760]  to buy exactly what they say, so it's gonna double. But hey, that's not the good news.
[27:37.760 --> 27:44.480]  The really good news is, you can pull this up, by 2015, it set just two years away to
[27:44.480 --> 27:50.300]  triple. That's some good free health care, isn't it? Obamacare to trigger health insurance
[27:50.300 --> 27:52.340]  cancellation notices.
[27:52.340 --> 27:57.120]  There's Fox News reporting on it, the Associated Press as well. So you can keep your health
[27:57.120 --> 28:01.760]  plan. And of course, there's no death panels. But then after they passed it, Newsweek came
[28:01.760 --> 28:06.120]  out and said, yeah, we're gonna kill Granny. And then Bill Gates came out and said, yeah,
[28:06.120 --> 28:07.120]  we're gonna kill Grandma.
[28:07.120 --> 28:17.260]  Tom Daschle wrote a book saying you're above 65, no eye surgery, no knee surgery. You can't
[28:17.260 --> 28:22.640]  shake a stick and not hit a doctor in Cuba. Of course, you can't actually get any health
[28:22.640 --> 28:29.040]  care unless you're an inter-party communist. I mean, if you have a knee problem, you get
[28:29.040 --> 28:32.800]  a cane. Or if you're going blind, you get a cane.
[28:32.800 --> 28:39.520]  Kind of like, here's a cane. I mean, they actually say that. Daschle said, get a cane.
[28:39.520 --> 28:44.900]  So cuz again, they want all your money through the socials health care to go to foreign banks.
[28:44.900 --> 28:48.720]  And then they will give the illegal aliens free health care though, and have their babies
[28:48.720 --> 28:53.200]  free and stuff only to bring in a group to vote to take the guns and then further collapse
[28:53.200 --> 28:54.200]  the country.
[28:54.200 --> 28:57.320]  And again, you can't blame the illegal aliens, their countries have been ruined by the globalist
[28:57.320 --> 29:02.200]  as well. So they're just fleeing somewhere better. And of course, it's meant to make
[29:02.200 --> 29:07.440]  the lifeboat go under. The lifeboat could say hold 20 people. It's got about 50 in it
[29:07.440 --> 29:11.520]  right now. It's right at the water line. People are bailing. And if you bail, you're called
[29:11.520 --> 29:14.080]  a traitor or a terrorist.
[29:14.080 --> 29:18.400]  Not exaggerating, we're gonna break a report in the next few hours where the Justice Department
[29:18.400 --> 29:25.240]  actually says that husband and wife can't use that if you work for the federal government.
[29:25.240 --> 29:29.640]  That's a hate speech. Just those words are hate speech. It's hurtful. And of course,
[29:29.640 --> 29:31.960]  France has already done that. So it's a good thing.
[29:31.960 --> 29:37.800]  Oh, here's the great news. Obama is set to sign the International Gun Control Treaty.
[29:37.800 --> 29:44.120]  They've announced the UN General Assembly has released the vote on that. And Obama has
[29:44.120 --> 29:48.920]  signaled he's set to sign it and implement it outside of Congress. Who needs a stinking
[29:48.920 --> 29:49.920]  Congress?

[33:07.640 --> 33:31.760]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. You remember Ibregum Totaship? He was questioned by the
[33:31.760 --> 33:37.960]  FBI. He was friends with Tamerlan, the supposed leader of the Boston bombing who was on CIA
[33:37.960 --> 33:46.960]  payroll. This is mainstream news being sent to infiltrate southern Russia and was in CIA
[33:46.960 --> 33:54.800]  training programs in Georgia. Well, two of the FBI agents that were investigating this
[33:54.800 --> 33:59.640]  fell out of a helicopter and they were involved investigating and on the ground in the arrest
[33:59.640 --> 34:05.840]  and talked to the surviving brother before he had his throat cut out. He climbed out
[34:05.840 --> 34:11.440]  not bleeding and then minutes later, he may die because news cameras were on the boat.
[34:11.440 --> 34:16.680]  They tried to shoot it up and kill him, but miraculously he didn't get hit or didn't die
[34:16.680 --> 34:21.360]  and so they had to cut his throat out and then announced that he'd confessed with his
[34:21.360 --> 34:25.280]  throat cut out because that's how you do it now. You just go directly to a hospital bed
[34:25.280 --> 34:29.600]  with your throat cut out and then he confesses they could do that to me because it's such
[34:29.600 --> 34:30.960]  a free country.
[34:30.960 --> 34:37.720]  Well, Ibregum Totaship was killed. This has now been admitted by FBI during a questioning,
[34:37.720 --> 34:43.560]  was shot six times and once in the crown of the head, photos shown at a press conference
[34:43.560 --> 34:48.180]  in Moscow reveal his father suspects it could have been a kill shot. Kind of like Terence
[34:48.180 --> 34:52.080]  Yakey, cop of the year that responded first to the Oklahoma City bombing about a minute
[34:52.080 --> 34:56.060]  after it happened and carried my people out on his back and asked the ATF, why are you
[34:56.060 --> 35:01.680]  in bomb squad gear? Why are there people from the federal office here?
[35:01.680 --> 35:06.320]  And they said, shut up or we'll kill you. I've talked to his family, we've made films
[35:06.320 --> 35:10.900]  with them, we did interviews, I've talked to cops that knew him. I've talked to Don
[35:10.900 --> 35:15.800]  Browning, who was head of the K-9 unit, the second to respond and he asked questions and
[35:15.800 --> 35:17.760]  they came to his office and said, the FBI did.
[35:17.760 --> 35:21.480]  He said this on the show and said, you and your wife are dead if you don't shut up. And
[35:21.480 --> 35:27.760]  he went to the police chief and tried to, the chief said, yeah, shut up. You heard him?
[35:27.760 --> 35:34.240]  Take your check and go have a good day, buddy boy. We're playing hero right now. Don't get
[35:34.240 --> 35:38.800]  in the way of that, the daycare got bombed.
[35:38.800 --> 35:46.040]  You and your wife Apu know what to do, don't you? Cuz America is run by the good guys.
[35:46.040 --> 35:50.640]  America is run by the folks that run Fast and Furious, who was the Deputy Attorney General
[35:50.640 --> 35:59.500]  in 1995. And now he's the big honcho. He's now the big man. He's now the King Daddy in
[35:59.500 --> 36:02.360]  charge while he's Eric Holder.
[36:02.360 --> 36:08.800]  People say, why have they killed you yet? Because I'm on the air, they're trying to
[36:08.800 --> 36:12.920]  kill my name, they're trying to destroy me, perhaps before setting me up or doing something
[36:12.920 --> 36:17.800]  like that. They pull me over with drugs, I don't use drugs. They find me dead in a hotel
[36:17.800 --> 36:22.640]  room with a hooker, I don't do that. They're found dead with a heroin injector, I've never
[36:22.640 --> 36:29.520]  used heroin, would never take any hard drugs, it's pure bull.
[36:29.520 --> 36:34.020]  Shoot me in the top of the head. Terence Yankee cop of the year, he was tortured, cuts all
[36:34.020 --> 36:38.360]  over his body, looked like electric shocks out in the field, blood everywhere. And then
[36:38.360 --> 36:43.280]  a shot in the back of the head, cuz that's how he commits suicide, from the back and
[36:43.280 --> 36:49.640]  down. Kinda like this friend of Tamerlan, who said the FBI's coming to talk to me, told
[36:49.640 --> 36:51.760]  people it's a setup, my friends were set up.
[36:51.760 --> 36:55.000]  And he told his friends they're gonna kill me, that's on record. And they said, don't
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  worry, the FBI's the good guys, I saw it on TV. And it turned out the FBI first we heard
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.040]  had been attacked and stabbed, turned out he wasn't stabbed. That's why there's no hospital
[37:04.040 --> 37:08.160]  record, they're now saying, well, he jumped up out of his chair.
[37:08.160 --> 37:16.040]  Well, everybody knows you go in for questioning and then you jump out of your chair. And it's
[37:16.040 --> 37:23.320]  like that woman with the TSA who choked herself, but she was handcuffed behind her back. See
[37:23.320 --> 37:28.040]  what happens is the cops too like to jump on your head now. It's like fun to like jump
[37:28.040 --> 37:30.180]  on, and then you suffocate.
[37:30.180 --> 37:34.360]  Every day I see an article about, they go to the asthmatic's house, there's no guns,
[37:34.360 --> 37:40.880]  no drugs, no nothing. They jump on them, the person begs for 20 minutes and dies. And it's
[37:40.880 --> 37:47.080]  like hi-fi all around her. I think it's great, I think it's all wonderful. And I say, I think
[37:47.080 --> 37:51.880]  it's great they've already taken all the corporate pension funds, almost all of them, the federal
[37:51.880 --> 37:53.400]  pension funds have already been taken.
[37:53.400 --> 37:57.280]  You're still being paid with fiat dollars, but the money's gone. I think it's all great
[37:57.280 --> 38:01.440]  too, I support the government. I support them growing the opium in Afghanistan and shipping
[38:01.440 --> 38:06.120]  it in. I support them persecuting journalists and arresting media people that just report
[38:06.120 --> 38:11.380]  mainstream news. I support secret arrest under NDAA and Obama saying they'll kill Americans
[38:11.380 --> 38:17.180]  inside the US and authorizing NATO countries to kill whoever they want inside the US outside
[38:17.180 --> 38:18.180]  of law.
[38:18.180 --> 38:23.400]  Cuz he's the president and when he does it, it's okay. When he does it, it's not illegal.
[38:23.400 --> 38:28.440]  I mean, it is, but you know what? I think I'm gonna join the team and stop being such
[38:28.440 --> 38:37.760]  a hate monger. In fact, maybe I should just apologize, cuz I'm reading all this news.
[38:37.760 --> 38:45.720]  Look at this, Japan is banning importations of corn GMO that kills the insects. The Japanese
[38:45.720 --> 38:49.960]  government's like, it kills insects, but humans can eat it. We have these studies of organ
[38:49.960 --> 38:55.240]  failure, no thank you. But they still try to ship it in like it was a bio weapon or
[38:55.240 --> 38:58.800]  something, like it was a military operation from Monsanto and others.
[38:58.800 --> 39:05.040]  It was a military operation, sorry. Japan halts imports of US wheat after, it was corn,
[39:05.040 --> 39:13.080]  now it's wheat this week, after USDA shock finding of genetic pollution from GMOs. Yes,
[39:13.080 --> 39:19.840]  it does change your DNA when they add plant and animal and then pharmacological traits
[39:19.840 --> 39:28.760]  to this. And of course, that's USDA even now admits that, but you know what? It's okay.
[39:28.760 --> 39:34.560]  It's all right. I think everybody should just go with the flow, ladies and gentlemen. And
[39:34.560 --> 39:37.560]  again, I mentioned this yesterday, but now there's been a prisonplanet.com article written
[39:37.560 --> 39:38.560]  about it.
[39:38.560 --> 39:43.480]  It was in the Illinois newspapers. Illinois AG Department illegally seizes privately owned
[39:43.480 --> 39:53.920]  bees resistant to GMO poison. Now they claim that the poison isn't expressed in the pollen
[39:53.920 --> 39:59.600]  of these different plants like corn, but it does kill the bees and there's been big studies
[39:59.600 --> 40:03.960]  out on that. Well, now they're very upset that a beekeeper pointed out that his bees
[40:03.960 --> 40:08.160]  were not dying from it and they did a study on it and you don't wanna find out what's
[40:08.160 --> 40:14.440]  going on, including studies that are linked in this article to killing human kidney cells.
[40:14.440 --> 40:19.480]  Well, what's wrong with killing your kidneys? I mean, come on, man. Don't be extreme, it's
[40:19.480 --> 40:26.120]  fun. And Terrence Ingram, a world renowned naturalist who once saved the bald eagle,
[40:26.120 --> 40:30.640]  well, that's a crime, get rid of those, from being on the endangered species list was recently
[40:30.640 --> 40:34.960]  met by the Illinois Agriculture Department, which seizes privately owned bees. The department
[40:34.960 --> 40:39.160]  seized the bees that were resistant to GMO pesticides and killed the remaining healthy
[40:39.160 --> 40:43.640]  queen bees in the beehives. Well, yeah, we can't have the bees surviving. I mean, if
[40:43.640 --> 40:49.600]  they mutate to survive, that's not good. And when your kid's getting sick from this stuff,
[40:49.600 --> 40:52.860]  you supposedly can't get the genetic test to prove it because, well, that's patented.
[40:52.860 --> 40:57.960]  Those poisons in your child are patented. The court said so, good people. Ingram had
[40:57.960 --> 41:02.660]  been researching the effects of Roundup, the Monsanto Frankenfood best selling herbicide
[41:02.660 --> 41:06.720]  meant to make crops more resistant to pests. Roundup itself is a long list of negative
[41:06.720 --> 41:11.600]  effects, again, killing human kidney cells and stuff like that. Much of the ill effects
[41:11.600 --> 41:16.560]  of Roundup are produced by the active ingredient. And then it goes through all that. Ingram
[41:16.560 --> 41:22.560]  has been raising the bees 58 years. Well, those aren't yours anymore. I mean, we're
[41:22.560 --> 41:27.360]  gonna seize them cuz Monsanto said so. And researching Roundup's effects on bees 15 years,
[41:27.360 --> 41:31.320]  well, we can't have that. By Monsanto's buying up all the bee study companies. They ruined
[41:31.320 --> 41:36.280]  15 years of my research. Well, that's the point, but roll over and die. Let's get him
[41:36.280 --> 41:41.600]  on guys. Let's get this guy on. He told Prairie Advocate, by stealing most of my stock, you
[41:41.600 --> 41:46.480]  can surmise that the results of my research were not likely a glowing report on the benefits
[41:46.480 --> 41:54.020]  of GMO pesticides. The AG department allegedly seized Ingram's bees because they were stricken
[41:54.020 --> 41:57.680]  with a disease known as American foul brood.
[41:57.680 --> 42:02.520]  However, Ingram said he could prove that that is simply not true and intended to do so in
[42:02.520 --> 42:08.660]  April a hearing. And it just goes on from there. So that's the kind of stuff that goes
[42:08.660 --> 42:14.880]  on. And here's another article from the LRC blog. I was already mentioning this, I just
[42:14.880 --> 42:21.500]  can't get over it. So why did the FBI shoot the friend of Tamerlan? But the best part
[42:21.500 --> 42:32.760]  is he confessed verbally to the agents about being involved in a triple murder before he
[42:32.760 --> 42:36.840]  shot himself in the top of the head.
[42:36.840 --> 42:42.940]  Yes, we came and questioned Alex Jones or maybe Ron Paul, maybe Rand Paul. We questioned
[42:42.940 --> 42:51.600]  the senator. And then he confessed to, who knows, arming Kim Jong-un. I mean, who knows
[42:51.600 --> 42:56.920]  what they'll make up? And then he jumped up and we felt threatened and shot him six times.
[42:56.920 --> 43:01.920]  You're like, no, no, this is only this other guy they did to. It'll never happen to anybody
[43:01.920 --> 43:09.280]  big. If they get away with it, it will. They'll never arrest reporters that talk to mainline
[43:09.280 --> 43:14.440]  sources just about their views on the administration. That's completely protected by the First Amendment.
[43:14.440 --> 43:23.200]  They are. And then I guess we're all supposed to just get scared by all of this. And then
[43:23.200 --> 43:31.720]  roll over in frothing, shaking, gibbering, uncontrolled fear because that will make the
[43:31.720 --> 43:33.320]  bad guys leave us alone, right?
[43:33.320 --> 43:40.960]  If we lay down, bend over, grease the skids on our back, that will stop the bullies, right?
[43:40.960 --> 43:50.240]  That will fix everything. I mean, if the FBI comes into the cop's office and says, you
[43:50.240 --> 43:53.880]  and your wife are dead if you don't shut up, you're supposed to shut up Don Browning in
[43:53.880 --> 43:55.080]  Oklahoma City.
[43:55.080 --> 43:58.460]  And you saw what happened to Terrence Yakey shot in the top of the head, tortured all
[43:58.460 --> 44:03.360]  over his body, knife wounds all over his body, electrical wounds, all this other stuff, to
[44:03.360 --> 44:08.600]  find out where his documents were at. And see the FBI, the hit team they sent, cuz he
[44:08.600 --> 44:14.040]  called his partner and he said, it looks like I'm being followed by some feds, and all the
[44:14.040 --> 44:16.960]  witnesses of the feds planting the bombs and everything else.
[44:16.960 --> 44:23.080]  You're supposed to understand Terrence Yakey was the bad guy, folks. He was the bad guy
[44:23.080 --> 44:27.240]  saving people out of the wreckage. He was the bad guy seeing the ATF on the scene, dozens
[44:27.240 --> 44:32.240]  of them, and the FBI a minute after it happened in bomb gear and telling him to shut up. And
[44:32.240 --> 44:36.200]  he was supposed to just go with the flow, feel good, get a commendation, and that's
[44:36.200 --> 44:38.720]  the end of it.
[44:38.720 --> 44:44.040]  Because blowing up that nursery was loving to bring in the collective. We have to blame
[44:44.040 --> 44:48.600]  the libertarians and the conservatives and the gun owners for the bombing. We've gotta
[44:48.600 --> 44:53.760]  create a collective guilt to create an omnibus crime bill and then a Homeland Security Bureau
[44:53.760 --> 44:58.640]  to persecute the Tea Party and the pro-lifers and the veterans and the gun owners.
[44:58.640 --> 45:03.960]  How else are we gonna fully take over America and fully break down the family and fully
[45:03.960 --> 45:08.160]  take your private property and fully have offshore banks that are exempt from all of
[45:08.160 --> 45:12.120]  this, transfer all our wealth? How are they gonna destroy a free country without doing
[45:12.120 --> 45:14.120]  that?
[45:14.120 --> 45:22.720]  How, Don Browning, head of the K-9 unit in Oklahoma City? You are the bad man. I, Alex
[45:22.720 --> 45:28.200]  Jones, am the bad man. Ron Paul is the bad man. Rand Paul is the bad man. He came out
[45:28.200 --> 45:32.520]  last week again this week and said in the Senate, why are we funding Al-Qaeda and the
[45:32.520 --> 45:33.520]  bin Laden brigade?
[45:33.520 --> 45:38.280]  The main leadership, it's like 60% of the rebels now they estimate, even Reuters does,
[45:38.280 --> 45:43.720]  are Al-Qaeda. They have Al-Qaeda flags, they march, and they say, after Assad, we destroy
[45:43.720 --> 45:47.640]  America. And they're going to let them attack America as soon as they've done that job,
[45:47.640 --> 45:53.280]  and they'll all be paid in gold as usual. They flew out 30 to 40,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda
[45:53.280 --> 45:54.280]  leaders.
[45:54.280 --> 46:01.120]  Just googled airlift of evil, Newsweek, Daily Mail, Sunday Times of London, where the special
[46:01.120 --> 46:10.680]  forces colonels and generals were like, we are loading them on C-130s with chest of gold.
[46:10.680 --> 46:16.500]  And we're flying them over the mountains into Pakistan. And then of course, that's the group
[46:16.500 --> 46:20.840]  they fight today. They don't really fight them, they bomb other people. See, they move
[46:20.840 --> 46:25.240]  their Al-Qaeda simulant into an area, and they stage some terror attacks and things
[46:25.240 --> 46:27.920]  when it's needed to take liberties and things.
[46:27.920 --> 46:33.600]  But then you say, we may have to attack and take over Pakistan cuz they're harboring Al-Qaeda.
[46:33.600 --> 46:38.880]  And then the Pakistani presidents come out and go, you're running these people. And it's
[46:38.880 --> 46:47.720]  on record they are. And see, Rand Paul should understand it's part of the greater game to
[46:47.720 --> 46:53.920]  overthrow Libya and Egypt and Syria and put Al-Qaeda in.
[46:53.920 --> 46:59.560]  How else is Al-Qaeda gonna shoot down European and Western airliners with heat-seeking missiles
[46:59.560 --> 47:05.360]  the Pentagon gave them? How else are they gonna do that so we can have highway checkpoints
[47:05.360 --> 47:10.400]  to look for missiles? How else are we gonna overthrow America and the rest of the world?
[47:10.400 --> 47:17.240]  Because America can't stand. America can't exist. America can't be there as a free country
[47:17.240 --> 47:23.720]  with private property and guns and families and marriages and children and prosperity
[47:23.720 --> 47:29.280]  when the average African country's got 40% HIV infection, UN caught adding sterilants
[47:29.280 --> 47:33.960]  to the vaccines, GMO being shipped in to kill everybody.
[47:33.960 --> 47:39.200]  The rest of Latin America forced sterilizations, all this stuff. I mean, you can't have them
[47:39.200 --> 47:45.120]  all under this and then we're not under it. We've gotta eat all the GMO. We've gotta have
[47:45.120 --> 47:49.960]  the organ failure. We've gotta have the 3,000% increase in breast cancer, 10,000% increase
[47:49.960 --> 47:53.720]  in pediatric cancer.
[47:53.720 --> 48:03.040]  We've got to do it. We've got to be part of it. We've got to show everybody, look, we're
[48:03.040 --> 48:07.120]  eating it, it's safe. We're drinking it, it's safe. We're taking all the vaccines, it's
[48:07.120 --> 48:12.760]  safe. We're assigning social workers every family and saying, parents, the children don't
[48:12.760 --> 48:14.160]  belong to you, they belong to the state.
[48:14.160 --> 48:18.280]  It's safe. It's America, land of the free, home of the brave. Look at that drone. Look
[48:18.280 --> 48:22.040]  at that black helicopter. You know what the people who talk about black helicopters, they
[48:22.040 --> 48:26.920]  were actually being truthful, but they're here to save you now. You saw that army checkpoint
[48:26.920 --> 48:27.920]  in your town.
[48:27.920 --> 48:31.980]  FEMA came door to door in Chicago. We've got a reporter coming on later. The general manager
[48:31.980 --> 48:38.280]  of our 1530 affiliate in Chicago, he's got video of it. He put out the famous video of
[48:38.280 --> 48:45.160]  his son in a wheelchair being accosted by the TSA. And they're coming and asking questions
[48:45.160 --> 48:46.400]  about you and your family.
[48:46.400 --> 48:52.720]  It's just a, we're just dropping by cuz some stuff's coming to America that we're gonna
[48:52.720 --> 48:59.560]  be in your life every day. Cuz it's in the civilian inmate labor camp program. And again,
[48:59.560 --> 49:03.560]  this doesn't have to happen if we wake up. But see, if Rachel Maddow can say there aren't
[49:03.560 --> 49:07.840]  2 million bullets, there aren't FEMA camps, we can never have a debate about it and say
[49:07.840 --> 49:09.480]  we don't want that.
[49:09.480 --> 49:14.360]  As they roll it out, they go, doesn't exist, doesn't exist, doesn't exist, doesn't exist,
[49:14.360 --> 49:22.320]  doesn't exist, doesn't exist, so we can never have a debate about it. Get offensive. They
[49:22.320 --> 49:30.000]  put bullhorn in Vietnamese and English, this is not an assault. And they learned that,
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  of course, from the German military, and our military learned that.
[49:33.000 --> 49:38.600]  Did you know if you're actually in good old fashioned infantry warfare with groups moving
[49:38.600 --> 49:42.240]  against each other? Some of the last times this happened was really in Vietnam, but they
[49:42.240 --> 49:48.440]  did some of it in the 1990 invasion of Iraq. You broadcast in radio, TV, but also with
[49:48.440 --> 49:53.640]  loudspeakers that we're not attacking, we're not attacking. I mean, you shove bayonets,
[49:53.640 --> 50:02.360]  I'm not attacking you, there's no New World Order, there's no Bilderberg group either.
[50:02.360 --> 50:09.160]  And everybody loves it, cuz the average person doesn't wanna fight. When a bank robber comes
[50:09.160 --> 50:13.400]  in, they say, put your hands up and nothing bad's gonna happen. A lot of times, cuz I
[50:13.400 --> 50:19.840]  read crime reports, I'm sure you do, too. You'll hear about these usually multi-time

[52:05.600 --> 52:10.280]  afford to pay your electric bill. That's closer than you think. You probably haven't heard
[52:10.280 --> 52:13.960]  about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the
[52:13.960 --> 52:20.080]  most shocking news story of 2012. Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your
[52:20.080 --> 52:26.120]  already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months. As shocking as it sounds, it
[52:26.120 --> 52:30.800]  may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America. But
[52:30.800 --> 52:36.680]  here's some good news. There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of
[52:36.680 --> 52:42.000]  smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly. The video
[52:42.000 --> 52:47.240]  at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google, and the liberal media is doing
[52:47.240 --> 52:51.600]  everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark. So watch it now
[52:51.600 --> 52:59.840]  at exposed123.com before it's too late. Again, that's exposed123.com.

[53:29.740 --> 53:34.180]  grow cotton, we fabric engraving embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and
[53:34.180 --> 53:38.480]  carting to a private bank having a lead back at interest forcing taxes to serve a step
[53:38.480 --> 53:42.260]  this capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[53:42.260 --> 53:46.000]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army. Hi Ted
[53:46.000 --> 53:49.460]  Anderson I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system
[53:49.460 --> 53:56.840]  call for your copy 800-686-2237 it's time to understand the system call 800-686-2237
[53:56.840 --> 54:26.640]  that's 800-686-2237. You know I said I would get to the building
[54:26.640 --> 54:32.120]  but I'll do that later in the next hour after I take some phone calls and we'll move the
[54:32.120 --> 54:36.840]  ask Alex thing with Christy Hightower into the third hour also in the third hour up on
[54:36.840 --> 54:44.520]  in full wars.com we're going to post an article with links and a video here on the radio show
[54:44.520 --> 54:51.920]  slash TV show today as I've been announcing from the start of the broadcast today we are
[54:51.920 --> 54:59.400]  going to get into this story right here document can please remember this story France set
[54:59.400 --> 55:11.600]  to ban the words mother and father from official documents.
[55:11.600 --> 55:16.240]  Now we have that going on in England I have articles of this because it's intolerant to
[55:16.240 --> 55:24.120]  say mother and father we have the Justice Department this is on their own website about
[55:24.120 --> 55:35.940]  how to be inclusive it says do not use the words like spouse use inclusive words like
[55:35.940 --> 55:40.220]  partner significant other or spouse rather than gender specific terms like husband and
[55:40.220 --> 55:48.040]  wife see a gender is bad it's bad if you're a male it's bad if you're a female for example
[55:48.040 --> 55:53.360]  in invitations to office parties or when asking a new employee about his or her home life
[55:53.360 --> 55:57.960]  so again this is how they phase this in though see it's it's it's insensitive which then
[55:57.960 --> 56:04.120]  they call hate speech that's what it is they're saying hate speech to say your husband or
[56:04.120 --> 56:13.420]  your wife and again it's sold as if it's being inclusive but all it does is actually charge
[56:13.420 --> 56:19.680]  everyone up obsessing over some type of identity where the fact that you're head of a sexual
[56:19.680 --> 56:23.840]  is a bad thing and that's actually what's taught in the universities that all male and
[56:23.840 --> 56:29.240]  female sexes rape that men are inherently bad blah blah blah this and meanwhile the
[56:29.240 --> 56:35.040]  government has got super militarized men robots drones all of it to enforce they just don't
[56:35.040 --> 56:40.320]  want you to be a man and and and they want women to think it's cool if men are weak it's
[56:40.320 --> 56:44.600]  like I was telling a pregnant woman you know with her husband and some people on the hike
[56:44.600 --> 56:49.760]  and bike trail I was saying be careful of vaccines you know you got a 17% reduction
[56:49.760 --> 56:55.200]  in women's IQ 20 something in men that's about a 20 average you know the autism is way up
[56:55.200 --> 57:00.360]  in boys because they have a thinner blood-brain barrier the woman goes that's because girls
[57:00.360 --> 57:06.960]  are better and I went listen it's not about boys and girls it's hurting people but it's
[57:06.960 --> 57:11.200]  almost kind of like exciting like you mean we're hurting men we get ahead when we do
[57:11.200 --> 57:22.960]  that yeah there it is Washington State gender-neutral vocabulary law signed by Jay Inslee the governor
[57:22.960 --> 57:25.680]  say we need to add all that to our article people won't even believe this that's Reuters

[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:56.960]  hour you heard over in France where they're saying don't use the term mother or father
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.520]  or don't use the term husband or wife well that's now going on in England and the US
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:08.600]  and they're passing laws in different states doing it and it's just it's just see political
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.320]  correctness is meant to put you in a box and make it smaller and smaller and smaller where
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.480]  they say in the US and Europe you've seen it we need to arrest people that don't believe
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:20.200]  in man-made global warming and who don't want to pay their carbon tax not agreeing with

[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.040]  rate hike in California well what's wrong with that the insurance companies wrote the
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:50.720]  bill and they wrote it to absolutely rob the daylights out of you and insurance is then
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.840]  regulated by the state and they're fully adopting Obamacare so it'll be tripled by the time
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:01.100]  they're done in 2015 nationwide what's wrong with that it will make you poor and it will

[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:16.120]  text and video where you've heard about France and England saying don't use the word mother
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:21.440]  father don't use the term spouse or use the term spouse don't say husband or wife because
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.760]  those are hateful well now the Justice Department's saying that as well so I guess I am guilty
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:31.740]  of hate speech when Bill O'Reilly says so and and Rachel Maddow say I'm full of hate
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:37.180]  speech I mean I hate their tyranny I guess it's true I do talk about my wife and I guess
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:42.720]  that will land me if they have their way in a reeducation center because it's all about
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:46.740]  making us criminal so we all better do what they say we all better you know comply with
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:53.800]  all the political correctness right now ladies and gentlemen right now is the time and we've
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:10:00.360]  got more of the scandals on the IRS front government funding Al Qaeda and Taliban front
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:06.880]  that's just some of the news we now have liberal activists admitting to bugging Mitch McConnell's
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:11.440]  office which Mitch McConnell had been exposing the Justice Department's actually doing that
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:17.240]  vet charged rifles confiscated for firing warning shot at a burglar we're becoming England
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:20.680]  the greatest crime is to fight a government criminal or a street criminal they're all
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:25.560]  in it together California bill one ammo we first reported on this a month ago submit
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:31.440]  personal info and pay $50 the power to tax is the power to destroy by the way Detroit
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:37.280]  citizens protect themselves after police force decimated that's another crime to protect
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:44.560]  yourself and that is just some of the news that we're going to be breaking down on that
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.320]  front.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:51.400]  There's a claim that a Russian missile shipment has reached Syria Israel doubts it but has
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:56.840]  warned the Kremlin not to ship missiles in the Kremlin says their defensive missiles
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:03.400]  and there's cell can make fighters to Syria Assad forces are regaining momentum against
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:08.400]  the Al Qaeda forces and I am unpatriotic for not supporting Al Qaeda judge rules Google
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:14.220]  must comply with FBI's warrantless request for user data yeah I mean who needs warrants
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:23.880]  these days and continuing here with the news Rand Paul is challenging Google to stand up
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:37.320]  to the feds and I should add that Drudge is also linked to our story on Bilderberg security
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:44.840]  lockdown and that ties into the Daily Mail and others have now become schizophrenic as
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:51.080]  well like me they're very evil royalty and statesmen to descend on Watford Hotel for
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:57.360]  secret Bilderberg summit amid fears of violent anti-capitalist protest so I'm sure they're
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.180]  gonna try to send in their federal provocateurs and we'll be there with video cameras to expose
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:05.680]  it and show them put on a foundation funded Boston where they're staying and they'll be
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:09.320]  cops you know in amongst them and we'll will because that's kind of stuff I'll be doing
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:14.120]  here I'll be catching them in provocateuring and exposing them and they think we're dumb
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:21.040]  and we'll just expose them you know there's no doubt they'll send in MI5 types to do that
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:25.520]  and we're gonna be breaking that down after I take some phone calls but our article that's
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:30.800]  linked on Drudge the police imposed security lockdown for Bilderberg 2013 ring of steel
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:38.400]  will stifle protests freedom of the press we have the the city council and the police
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:46.720]  department and all of them with Bilderberg security with a press release so this is bizarre
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:55.620]  I mean the police departments and the city and the hotel and G4S security are reporting
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:13:04.560]  on things that do not exist you understand folks that this is a full-blown hallucination
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:10.040]  right now there is no weather modification you heard Rachel Maddow say that even though
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:13.440]  it's all over the news they do weather modification all I said was they probably didn't make this
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.520]  tornado but they are messing with the weather who knows what that's doing oh my gosh I said
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:24.720]  Obama had a joystick controlling the tornado and I'm crazy and said a thing called Bilderberg
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.040]  group exists where they're setting up world government and I've even had people get the
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:33.240]  National Archives and give us restricted information and publish it and you'd think mainstream
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:37.240]  media would want to pick that up you know their plan to establish world government and
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:41.820]  turn off the resources and enslave us but you know what everybody's gonna kind of keep
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:46.900]  their jobs in mainstream media as they're all phased out I can't tell you how many IBM
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:55.720]  and Apple and but especially IBM advanced micro devices Microsoft engineers I've known
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:14:01.440]  who you know had two degrees three degrees electrical engineering chemical engineering
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:09.240]  you name it software engineering degrees that I've lived around and known over the years
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:13.200]  and they would tell me yeah no I'm training my replacements from India who work for ten
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.720]  percent of what we do and then when they're done they'll go to India and then they won't
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:22.840]  even build an economy for the Indians it'll just implode ours and they go but what choice
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:28.800]  do I have I am working to train my replacements and then I see the guy and his wife I've seen
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:35.320]  a lot of people you know years later and you know they're bankrupt these are 30 40 50 year
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:40.460]  old people who run the gamut who are 50 something years old in some cases and still haven't
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:45.280]  paid back their student loans I mean it's not like they were making a lot as a top of
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.880]  their class you know engineer maybe a hundred fifty thousand dollars a year then it was
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:59.320]  sixty thousand a year to turn the replacement and then it's how about no job but your daughter
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:06.560]  can go to California and get paid 500 bucks to be in porn used to be millions to be in
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:10.720]  porn but see everybody got into it so there's no it's the same thing with the whole economy
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:18.840]  there is no economy that's the goal shut everything off create dystopia on purpose and the public
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:23.640]  has all been raised in like this brainwave stare of not being conscious not being awake
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:27.520]  and we're all in it to different degrees but let me tell you being actually conscious is
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:32.520]  incredible not that I have all the answers not that I'm perfect but let me tell you I'm
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:40.080]  conscious and sometimes I wish I could just go into the glaze of not listening to anybody
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:52.960]  not hearing not caring just just kind of flippering through life like some type of quadpedal ostrich
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:16:01.120]  ostrich is bipedal that's the whole stupid joke I don't even know what to say anymore
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:06.680]  at this point I mean it is just madness where the government publicly runs Al Qaeda publicly
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:12.120]  ships in all the major narcotics the big banks publicly launder hundreds of billions a year
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:17.520]  publicly in drug money they run the aircraft they ship the full auto machine guns armored
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.720]  vehicles grenade launchers to the cartels it comes out in Bloomberg AP Reuters nobody
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:28.520]  gets in trouble the government is is grabbing over a million innocent kids a year and then
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:34.000]  putting them on drugs to get federal funds but by them being disabled they're doing medical
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.600]  experiments on kids all over the country the entire nation is under medical experimentation
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:44.840]  with the GMO and the hydrofluorosolic acid and the aspartame that's in all the major
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:49.320]  candies and gums now and the diseases are exploding and they're just killing us and
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:56.280]  the general public can't get upset can't get focused because they're already dead raised
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:04.320]  on television raised on entertainment raised on fantasy I guess we've got a triage thing
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:09.200]  so that means triage if you got a thousand people dead and dying you got 20 doctors you've
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:13.800]  got to go to the ones you think you can save and I don't take some pleasure out of the
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:25.920]  public being a bunch of ruling morons it actually freaks me out completely and totally that
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:30.140]  I can't get through to the average person that they don't know the peril they're in
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:36.760]  that they value their ignorance they wear it like armor that I mean instead people I
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:40.440]  run into most of them are actually awake and really know everything works and go haven't
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:46.240]  you looked at it from this perspective and actually understand this they're usually billionaires
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:50.860]  they're usually super high-powered and they go you can't help them Alex even if you wanted
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:57.880]  to all you can do is join with the system and try to make it better from the inside
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:03.440]  the public would make an even greater evil than we would if they were in control and
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.680]  I know people that are in the power structure hearing us are going wow Alex has got the
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:12.840]  same speech I've gotten yeah it's the same script this whole thing is centralized I've
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:21.440]  been told that speech probably 50 times different ways it's always by high-powered people and
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:25.360]  I mean what am I supposed to do just like sit there and walk around all these zombies
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:29.740]  are everywhere and like prey on them I mean well and the whole point is you better prey
[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:34.300]  on them they're gonna prey on you but it's the globalist organizing the zombies trying
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:39.300]  to make the zombies more zombie like instead of trying to make them more human to use them
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:44.500]  as a weapon against smart people that aren't into evil plus there's not that many places
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:49.840]  at the table in the New World Order I didn't psychoanalyze this you know 18 years ago but
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:56.040]  I'll tell you not selling out the system has gotten me more success because just like porn
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:00.880]  when everybody's doing it when everybody's selling out there's no money there's no power
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:06.400]  there's no nothing in it and that's the whole curse of this because it's a spirit of evil
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.680]  that has deluded everyone who's serving it that you're somehow a winner because you know
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:17.360]  about it but you don't resist it you're in the FBI and you're sent to cut the rope and
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:23.000]  kill two FBI agents that found out it's a false flag you're sent to shoot the young
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.200]  man in the head in the back of the head to cover up he knows it's an inside job and you're
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:33.720]  scared you're given the order you think you're a tough guy got a shaved head devil tattoos
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:37.720]  you know you act real tough at the bar that's kind of gotten old okay you killed five or
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:41.200]  six people after you got out of the military and you're kind of figuring out they're gonna
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:47.680]  kill you and yeah you're first when they take over all you hit teams and people you're dead
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:52.840]  you're all dead I'm not the one that's gonna be killing you and by the way I wouldn't fear

[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:40.560]  government that makes Stalin Hitler and Mao seem like dreams compared to what's gonna happen
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:46.120]  because I look at what they're setting up and the dehumanization of it now it's a covert war to the
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:50.560]  food in the water in the air and then I go and find all their source documents where they admit
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:56.840]  they're doing it and the public can't get out of that and says your shows too scary too scary
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:03.480]  they're doing it I'm up here risking my life because there's no future if I don't that's why
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:09.720]  I don't people saying oh you're doing such a great job or oh you're such a hero a raccoon
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:17.760]  will chew its leg off to get out of a trap I know because I've had cousins of stuff that used to be
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:24.480]  trappers and I've gone out with them to their traps and they're trying to get fur animals go
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:30.240]  sell the taxidermist that's some of the hillbilly family I've got and you come up on a bloody leg
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:39.440]  stuck in a bear trap basically but they're not that big and it's where a raccoon has chewed their
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:43.880]  leg off to get out of it and man I mean does it have courage I don't even think a raccoon has
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:48.600]  courage that's not even what you call it of course they have courage I mean you can be out
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:54.040]  coon hunting and they will climb up on the back of a bloodhound or a dog a coon hound and grab
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:59.920]  their ears and drown them a large coon will pound for pound probably the meanest animal out there
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:07.600]  makes a Tasmanian devil or a Wolverine look tame in comparison you've seen video Wolverines beating
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:11.440]  up grab it jumping on the heads of grizzly bears and holding them biting on their nose you ever
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:18.720]  seen footage of Wolverines beating up cougars and start fights with them well a raccoons even meaner
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:24.000]  pound for pound but the point is it just wants to live it knows it's in a trap it knows it smells
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.880]  like humans doesn't matter if you've dipped the traps in wax before you take them out to plant
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:37.240]  them it could still smell it its leg is caught in there and it will chew through its leg every
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:45.280]  time baby raccoons will do it and you know why because they're extremist they're bad they're
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:50.720]  conspiracy theorists that traps not hurting its leg there's not somebody coming to kill it it
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:57.960]  should stay there with its leg in the trap and watch MSNBC and that's what I'm telling you folks
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:05.200]  I'm not a hero my leg is stuck in the trap our leg is stuck in the trap collectively and I just
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:09.800]  want to get out of this and to get out of it you're going to have to wake up
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:19.760]  and so yeah I'm freaked out on air I'm freaked out around here in the office because I realize
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:28.920]  how real all of this is my mother was at the house last night with my dad when I got home at about
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:39.440]  eight o'clock and she gave me three Bibles she knows I have Bibles and she said I'm praying for
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:43.560]  you I'm worried about you going to Bilderberg and I had the realization after she left that
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:50.600]  I don't even have any fear and it's not because I'm a tough guy folks hey there's not really much
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:56.840]  to worry about if you act afraid that's when they come after you because that's what they sense but
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:02.200]  there's no future if we don't go do things like this I mean is that how much tyranny we live we
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:09.200]  live under that we go to England and cover a globalist criminal conference that that that's
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:18.480]  heroic when all that is is survival that's all that is and the police are going to be there and
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:23.960]  they're going to act like we're criminal and they're going to act like we're bad and they're
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:31.480]  going to act like we're wrong but it's all a sight game like we're bad now now the Bilderberg
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:39.280]  meeting officially begins in five days next Thursday and that's the countdown we have at
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:46.040]  info wars.com forward slash Bilderberg but and it's a great site the guys have built but but I've
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:49.280]  told them Bilderberg is already going on right now they already have Google they're having a
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:53.480]  conference before and after they're now putting up iron fences all around it this is where they
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:57.480]  planned a bunch of World War two stuff this is where they plan the Arab Spring that's on record
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:04.640]  mainstream news this is pretty much a full-time globalist command center now they're basically
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:11.240]  moving in there about half the time but but this is where they meet the government the corporate
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:17.000]  people to have the payoffs to coordinate the scams to coordinate their mafia operations and because
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.680]  they control the British government I mean England's becoming a total police state famously
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:28.760]  beyond 1984 because that they've got all these cops and all these bureaucrats out there to
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:35.480]  convince themselves and us that that somehow it's bad to protest the parasite globalist but now
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:39.800]  we've got members of the UK Parliament the EU Parliament coming David I's coming I'm coming
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:44.240]  and I started realizing this is gonna be huge and the fact that they're gonna act like thugs will
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:50.200]  only illustrate everything for us you understand that they're falling right into our hands we're

[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:32.720]  board right now Genesis has a small phone system only like six phone lines that are like that for
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:37.640]  16 years they might want to expand it I guess with my show doesn't matter cuz I don't go to a
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:44.520]  lot of calls usually but after I've taken those calls I'm gonna open the phones up specifically
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:51.120]  for people in Europe who are planning to go to Bilderberg this year or folks that are in the UK
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:57.720]  itself and what do you think of the police saying we deny a permit for you to have any type of event
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:04.280]  in the square or at a park or any other public event for that matter we deny it and the mayor
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:11.360]  said protesting is bad and and man man man I'm sure will be violent and we just are glad that
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:18.720]  we're we're prestigious enough to be hosting this and how dare there be people coming and and and
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:24.320]  that's you know the Daily Mail royalty and statesmen to descend on Watford Hotel for secret
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:30.400]  Bilderberg summit oh I thought it didn't exist well why is it secret amid fears of violent
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:35.040]  anti-capitalist protest and we've gotten the minutes out of Bilderberg before we know it's
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.720]  authoritarian we know they want to get rid of the nation-state we know they want to bankrupt
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:46.680]  people and and and get a hundred trillion dollars over the next decade in in in carbon taxes paid to
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:51.200]  them so I'm gonna get into that after we take your phone calls now we're gonna premiere this
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:59.080]  report going up on info Wars calm as we speak we have the report dealing with the Justice
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:04.200]  Department saying do not use the term husband and wife it is insensitive and that is hate
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:10.880]  speech husbands and wives are a bad thing ladies and gentlemen and you're not you're not being
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:17.280]  inclusive if you don't do it that's like that you know just department told the pro-life groups they
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:26.320]  said you may have your your demonstration if half the time you promote abortion how is that free
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:31.200]  speech that's the fake fairness doctrine they had on talk radio and the media saying you got to show
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:40.280]  both sides maybe there's 15 sides maybe there's 20 sides they use an equality issue of gay straight
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:49.160]  stuff to create a fake civil rights movement to then persecute an attack having children and it's
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:53.120]  in the major university documents we've covered it on air it's about population reduction and
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:59.600]  further dividing culture never against the corrupt elite never against the insiders never against the
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:04.480]  monopoly men never against the warmongers oh they're good anybody that protests them as a

[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:44.240]  a bunch of pervs on the bottom who want to do whatever they want where the state is the parent
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:50.320]  as msnbc's told you the state is your mommy the state is your daddy we got to get past this
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:57.360]  ridiculous idea that kids belong to their parents they belong to the state they belong to us msnbc

[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:35.680]  terrorist I mean it's so obvious this is the high-tech authoritarian psych warfare crud they've
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:41.520]  come up with and if you just wake up to it it's over for them they're all going to jail thousands
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:52.160]  of studies that hydrofluorosolic acid is eating your brain game over Eric in Colorado you're up
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:58.840]  first this will be a grab bag of stuff go ahead Eric yeah Alex I had called in to Adam Kokesh
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:05.240]  but I just can't help myself I'm gonna have to comment on the political correctness thing that
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:10.080]  you're just going on and on about and I just I have a really simple question really do you think
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:18.680]  life is better for most Americans in the 1950s well you see what they do is they phrase the
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:24.360]  evils that were going on in the past and then they phrase it as if they've got the moral high
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:31.360]  ground today for the reasons they're doing it and some things were better some things were worse but
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:37.160]  they're getting the crowd to go along with this believing they're building a better world when
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:43.880]  the people doing this put hydrofluorosolic acid and hundreds of other poisons in your water and
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:50.920]  they put sterilants in vaccines for people in Latin America Africa Eastern Europe you name it
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:54.480]  and then none of the liberal trendies want to talk about that they'll go well there are too
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:00.400]  many people so see so see you're you're trendy by having a black friend but then you go well there
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:05.000]  are too many Africans you know when I confront so-called liberals with it well they're sterilizing
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.560]  them show me which is it it's all just it's all just a load of crud now you want to say something
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:16.520]  about Adam Kokesh that's why you called him yeah I feel like Adam Kokesh he just strikes me as a
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:22.560]  dangerous individual and I don't quite know what you're doing by promoting them by having them on
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:28.680]  your show over and over again he just seems a little unstable frankly and this whole you know
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:36.040]  armed march on every single capital the armed march to the sea itself was a really bad plan but the
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:40.320]  arm march and I know it's always easy to sit back when you don't do anything and tell everybody
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:47.340]  else's plans a bad idea here's the deal I think Adam Kokesh is smart and aggressive and not at
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:52.720]  the globalist agent okay that's what my gut tells me I I don't I didn't like his plan and I've said
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.280]  day one I didn't like his plan I said day one that there's weather weapons but this was probably a
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:01.760]  real tornado but you want to probably project that I said it was a that Obama's at the tornado
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:07.080]  it's the same thing or that I am endorsing what Adam Kokesh did I said I wouldn't go with guns I'd
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:13.200]  go with cameras so they can't do a false flag and and and it isn't an armed march on all 50 capitals
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:19.400]  it's a July 4th March to say we want in his words to dissolve this corrupt federal government I'm
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:23.640]  saying I just want our federal government back this is a globalist occupied government and my
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:28.760]  words are clear so you can project whatever you want Eric I appreciate I appreciate your call
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:35.240]  onto that because then you know that's what authoritarianism of the liberal psych warfare
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:39.920]  stripe is is it's fellow travelers who really don't even get power from the system they believe
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:47.440]  they're being empowered by and so they sit around in an NPR voice going I just don't think your
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:53.840]  plans very good I don't know why you're promoting Adam Kokesh he comes off as a dangerous individual
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:59.160]  I think Obama persecuting the press like no one's ever done in this country's history is scary I
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:04.280]  think the globalist with NDAA are scary I think all the brigade homelands is scary I think the FBI
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:08.800]  hit teams that routinely go around and shoot people in the back of the head now during interrogations
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:13.400]  are scary I think the billions of rounds of bullets are scary and the media trying to cover
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:17.880]  it up scary I think Obama's saying our military's under NATO command is scary I think the civilian
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:22.400]  inmate labor camp program is scary the model states emergency health powers act force inoculation
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:27.000]  larger response teams are scary I think the emergency centers establishment act is scary I
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:33.360]  think the army field manual on re-education camps just type that in you'll be at army.mil how
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:37.400]  they're gonna process us they're planning to collapse stuff they're planning I don't know what
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:43.240]  it is for total collapse financial nuclear war I don't know they're running around the last 20
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:48.520]  years gearing up for a total takeover and and basically I think they're gonna start a revolution
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:53.960]  they're gonna go out and blow stuff up come persecute people start a revolution and they
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:58.480]  think they're gonna use all this high-tech and spy bases they built in every town to come get
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:04.040]  everybody and I don't think that's what's gonna happen and by the way all the secret I mean the
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:10.880]  folks I just talked to the station manager in 1530 a.m. and he's got video of this FEMA is going
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:15.240]  door-to-door asking about flood damage one guy looks like a hippie that's the cover and the
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:19.920]  other looks like military there's been no emergencies recently and no reason for them to
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:26.160]  be in the area Matt goes on to say he looked for the vehicle but couldn't find one and his wife
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:30.280]  called the county and at first they didn't seem to know but eventually said they got an email
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:35.560]  about FEMA being in the area the county was aware of their presence but it seems very out of the
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:40.360]  ordinary and it's just it's just total Google cars driving around breaking into your passcode
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:48.160]  stealing everything CIA director goes we're watching you there it is FEMA Corps that is the
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:59.280]  FEMA Corps oh my gosh we now had the video thanks take care we're gonna show more I didn't know we
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:05.560]  had that yeah I knew he was sending it and and they send guys in FEMA Corps outfits and again
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:09.640]  it's the military this is I've been to these drills now it's going live but there'll be a
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:15.240]  military guy and he's there and then he's got the little local citizen spy I've shown you the
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:18.760]  footage you've seen my police state films where they got the Marines with the Boy Scouts now
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:23.080]  what's in your parents you know covered what's in the medicine cabinet what how many guns do they
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:44.480]  have okay thanks from this last rain yeah no I mean not that I'm this is just the feds establishing
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:45:03.640]  a relationship all right thanks take care and I think he says he has video to the military guy
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:11.560]  and again this is FEMA Corps that I have national TV saying does not exist and in the documents on
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:16.320]  their own FEMA site it says they're gonna assist in warrant service and surveillance of extremists
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:22.160]  but the first contact is hi I'm just here to see if there's any flooding and we've confirmed in
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:25.800]  some of these cases it's only people they know we're gun owners they've already got databases
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:31.800]  it's just a first contact hi how you doing I'm here with FEMA Corps guys type in yeah she's
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:36.800]  almost at a Freudian subset Hitler type in Obama's National Security Force and click Google and show
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:42.640]  them the images the armored vehicles the the citizen spies I haven't helped us man they are
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:48.560]  gonna they got their whole all their linebackers their whole deal lined up to just just attack us
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:55.140]  man I mean God help us God help this country Robert and West Virginia you're on the air go
[01:45:55.140 --> 01:46:02.240]  ahead hey buddy today you bet I do appreciate the efforts of you and your team you are waking
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:09.360]  people up out well thank you brother today a little bit about what some claim to be the next
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:14.480]  false flag staged event which was supposed to take place here in West Virginia the middle of
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:20.280]  July around the National Boy Scout Jamboree and I know you place links on info wars especially
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:25.200]  regarding David Rory Vanderbeek concern and I'd kind of like get your take on that I know if we
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:30.040]  put more precedence on it and this information gets out there these kids these 50,000 Boy Scouts
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:35.560]  that are going to be attending this year hopefully have a safe event well I did see articles about
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:41.480]  that governor candidate out there you know saying he thinks they're doing this drill there could be
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:45.880]  a false flag against them they have thousands of drills to create the illusion of real terrorists
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:49.880]  and to create fear and to re-engineer the society kind of like duck and cover you know the
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:54.560]  government's going to protect you from the Russian a-bombs it's a more sophisticated model of mind
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:59.640]  control and trauma-based mind control so they get you into shock state to then do the psychic
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:04.040]  driving you know general programming of the day in the government training facility of the
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:08.880]  government re-educations facility but they probably won't attack that now because we've
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:15.240]  talked about the drill but yes they always have a drill to shadow the real attack they will have
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:23.360]  but again if you type in scouts trained to fight terrorists and more you can see from three years
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:30.680]  ago Eagle Scouts training to confiscate guns and kill veterans it actually says that their
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:35.760]  main enemy is veterans and I've been telling you this forever but there they are training
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:40.920]  people people saw you're saying I'll take on those 14 year old punks really there's nothing
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:45.880]  more ignorant than a 14 year old and by ignorant I mean that they're they're fearless they make
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:49.160]  some of the best soldiers and they and they've been trained like it's a game they will go in
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:55.760]  and die all day long we're seeing the same drills taking place now just last month they're actually
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:01.320]  doing announced drills at local hospitals regarding the same possible biological attack no I know
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:05.800]  they're getting ready for total civil war and again they may do a bio attack is the excuse for
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:11.440]  the martial law a nuke any of it god help us I mean this is a criminal long-term program and
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:16.160]  they're gonna probably try to arrest everybody that's been speaking out against them when they
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:19.880]  go for it we're hoping to stop them that's why they don't want to have a debate about the bullets
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:23.600]  and the armored vehicles and all of it until they've done whatever trigger event it is that's
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:30.760]  why we've got to work like our lives depend on it now to expose these people yeah yes there's two
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:36.380]  chilling aspects of this too a lot of people are not aware that our governor our governor Earl Ray
[01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:42.200]  Tomlin signed an executive order last year they gave DHS FEMA and the National Guard martial law
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:47.720]  police power over this event so I want to get this message out and you I know you do a great
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:52.360]  job sir I can't go to a kite festival now without your National Guard trying to search me I know
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:58.520]  it's just they're everywhere except the border and it's just all an acclamation for what what
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:02.600]  do you think they're gonna do what are they gearing up for I mean we know the manual say
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:07.240]  it's for veterans gun owners conservatives the army manual says will be sent to reeducation
[01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:11.240]  camps within the pot bellies will have their way with us all the dumb commies that are just just
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:15.960]  been thinking about how much they want to torture us I mean what do you think in the evidence is
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:20.880]  already there the feeding the cancer that people are documenting this just 20 miles south of Mount
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:25.560]  Hope or this where this jamboree is going to take place there is a FEMA camp being built right now
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:30.920]  as we speak so the evidence is there people just need to wake up and and stay away from the
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:36.080]  mainstream media well it's FM three dash thirty nine dot forty is internment resettlement operations
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:40.880]  and again they probably won't do anything to this Boy Scout Jamboree event with tens of thousands
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:46.120]  of Boy Scouts they're they're immersing them with the Pentagon and the CIA I was reading is gonna
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:51.240]  be there recruiting this is the new FEMA Corps Army and the Boy Scouts that are more athletic
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:55.360]  are gonna lead the yugin crews they've been training them for at least four years now they're
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:00.800]  like 18 and now they're coming to everybody's door now we're just here to let you know we're
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:06.280]  in the area of FEMA Corps we're here to assist you to acclimate her I mean do you realize we're
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:11.080]  living in a science fiction movie how crazy this is we're watching it play out we've seen this played
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:16.680]  out on a grand stage in front of us and we're just now entering the final act the grand finale I
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:22.880]  just can't believe this has to happen I mean this is so incredible and most cowards in the police
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:29.800]  force and military even if they're physically not cowards intellectually it's so scary to go against
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:35.400]  the grain even people that know the truth a lot of them are gonna go along with this because they're
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:42.200]  so scared but you know that you know the issue is gonna be though if just 5% of us don't go along
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:48.080]  we'll beat them and we're not trying to start a fight they're gonna start it and all right I
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:55.440]  guess that's the way it is but notice FEMA Corps in the blue UN blue punch this up UN blue but see
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:02.200]  it won't come as UN troops it'll come as Homeland Security Dudley do right digestive health is the

[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:49.960]  Scouts trained to report on terrorists you'll get NBC News we've got the former White House chief
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:57.280]  of staff now the Chicago mob boss Rahm Emanuel you know who tells the president shut up in meetings
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:03.360]  and stuff and his jab steak knives in the table frothing total insane asylum gangster nutcase

[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:26.440]  a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military and guess who they train
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:32.480]  to fight gun owners conservatives libertarians but watch if Obama ever leaves office all these
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:37.120]  units will stay in place and when conservatives get in they're gonna love them now and explain
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:42.280]  to you what really woke me up is I'd go to urban warfare events in cities and I'd get video by
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:46.440]  listeners as well like Hebron Maryland where it showed Boy Scouts training to take their
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:53.840]  parents guns under the Marines in plain clothes and then they would send out real Marines to
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:58.680]  confiscate the guns after first it'd be plain clothes Marines with the Boy Scouts 12 to 14
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:07.480]  they were wearing uniforms white shirt and blue pants to be identifiable and they ran around with
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:12.040]  the local police and the Marines to confiscate guns and they've had countless drills since then
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:19.040]  it'll be like Alex is a kook he says the Arcadia Iowa drill is for gun confiscation and then I
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:23.600]  was quoting the local newspaper how they were doing every house had agreed 600 plus households
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:27.520]  to be searched for guns and then I read the headline and I had the colonel on he goes well
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:31.840]  we are doing gun confiscation but you're still kooky for not liking it I mean they're training
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:38.800]  for illegal unconstitutional all-out war with us the government's foreign run by foreign banks
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:46.560]  they put fluoride in the water that's killing us on record they're a bunch of scum but they've
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:51.760]  gotten it so far into it it's Homeland Security why all the movies are were terrorists attacked
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:57.280]  the White House those movies aren't real new listeners that the terrorists work for the
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:04.440]  White House and I sit here this isn't fun being on air this isn't fun covering all this is about

[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:21.600]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:35.760]  I'm taking phone calls right now let's talk to Stephanie in London the police are saying
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:42.720]  that basically protesting isn't allowed unless you go into the Grove property so you're under
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:47.480]  private property control so you have no rights show that private security can have their way
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:53.480]  with you and that's the favor they're doing us I think it's a great favor almost as big a favor as
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:01:00.240]  the fluoride in the water and the mercury and the shots and all the cancer rates going up Stephanie
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:03.520]  what are you planning to do what do you what do you make of all this I mean there's gonna be
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:09.000]  thousands of people descending on it and we're gonna be covering it at info wars comm for slash
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:13.080]  Bilderberg I'll start putting battle plans out on there you know politically of where we're gonna
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:16.720]  do how we're gonna get around this how we're gonna exercise free speech and how we're gonna
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:24.080]  exercise the Magna Carta which I know is really really scared of these ghouls but what's what's
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:29.440]  your take on this Stephanie yeah hi Alex it's good to talk to you I just wanted I just wanted
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:34.600]  to first off I just wanted to say I just think you're a I think you're a genuine folk hero and
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:42.040]  you know I'm very surprised at the way that you're being treated by the press and if it was up to me
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:47.120]  you know you'd be on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine well I don't ma'am I appreciate it all
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:52.160]  I want is for them to not put stuff in the water and be setting this up and I hear you but of
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:56.680]  course they demonize me because they tap my phone and stuff they know I'm for real they're scared of
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:01.240]  the fact that I don't care what they do to me and I'm committed to fighting them but I only care
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:07.800]  you know about doing the right thing because there's no future if we don't take action against
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:15.440]  them absolutely I think the problem here I talked to a lot of police kind of over the Olympics time
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:22.840]  and they're scared I think they're being privatized and you know they they had said to me regarding
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:28.680]  the Windsor review which is this thing that came out that that is hoping to privatize the police
[02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:34.120]  they've already started in certain parts of the country that you know they're scared of g4s you
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:39.440]  know they're frightened of g4s they're frightened of the privatization of their police force and I
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:45.680]  think it's really you know it's terrible that they're kind of pitching g4s against the police
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:52.120]  you know with this at Bilderberg you know well I mean look look look the Bilderberg commands their
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:56.920]  police department through the criminal government and so yes I've talked to police off record and
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:00.840]  then they say they don't like what's going on and then they're ordered to say the only place you can
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:07.480]  protest in the entire rural area is in the Grove property where you then have no rights and I don't
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:11.840]  know if the police are even smart enough to get what's going on there and then the police are
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:17.960]  ordered to violate everybody's rights outside driving us into the hands of g4s and this globalist
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:23.680]  group and we're just gonna do whatever we want and and so I call on everybody in mash to go there and
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:30.600]  exercise freedom of the press freedom of assembly and to document the provocateurs mi5 is guaranteed
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:36.080]  to send in it'll be another victory we're gonna show up we're gonna expose their whole thing and
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:41.200]  we're gonna win and if they block me from flying to England that we win it becomes international
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:46.000]  story they blocked me from going to an imaginary meeting again they don't even want this meeting
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:52.880]  to be known by doing this we make them act like these complete scum you see what I'm saying yeah
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:57.960]  absolutely the other thing I would say is that you know there's a there's a really beautiful canal
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:03.160]  that goes right through there and I would really recommend let's just you know we need to get a
[02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:10.240]  boat we need you we need to get well ma'am let's not give away great minds think alike but I like
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:14.740]  to swim and I mean I don't know if you're I mean I'm gonna take I should take a mask and snorkel

[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:37.360]  right now Justice Department says use of husband and wife is considered hate speech because they
[02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:43.160]  say it's insensitive and should not be used by Justice Department employees and other federal
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:50.280]  employees and what is insensitive is hate speech so see here's the issue this is not about inclusion
[02:08:50.280 --> 02:09:01.160]  this is not about not discriminating this is about pushing an agenda on the population and I'm going
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:12.360]  to go to this report that one of our reporters have filed and put together and then I'm going
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:16.320]  to go over some of the articles to show you Europe that's about three to five years ahead
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:21.800]  of us on this front and of course we covered just a few days ago children's cartoons targeting
[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:28.880]  people five to ten are showing children how to be homosexual they're showing them how to be
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:35.800]  cross-dressers I mean this is called pedophilia I mean if a heterosexual was trying to do that
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:40.120]  to children we call pedophilia but it's like oh let's be inclusive see how do they sell the
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:46.160]  sexualization of children I go out now and I see little girls dressed like whores like six
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:54.200]  seven-year-old girls dress like whores and you've shaken their rear ends all of it and that's not
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:10:01.160]  how little girls are really supposed to be this is the destruction of their innocence and it's a
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:05.040]  sick culture and it came out a few years ago that MTV admitted they were targeting children and
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:13.240]  sexualizing them MTV now is targeting people 11 and under that's its main demographic look it up
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:22.400]  and you've got Viacom and all these outfits pushing this to screw up children because they
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:26.880]  don't want real relationships being formed where you have an allegiance to your husband to your
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:33.160]  wife to your children where you have that fealty that human system Aldous Huxley wrote in Brave New
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:38.840]  World in 1932 his brother was the top eugenicist in the world at the time Julian Huxley became the
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:44.760]  head of the United Nations UNESCO program when it was founded in 1946 the year after the UN was set
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:49.760]  up and and he wrote in the book where there's no families everyone's basically grown in laboratories
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:11:00.200]  for the lower and middle classes there's only there's only normal sex and normal behavior in
[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:06.680]  these rural scientific command bases by the elites and then he gave a speech in 62 months before his
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:11.560]  death at Berkeley you can pull it up online it's over an hour long saying what I wrote in 32 is
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:17.440]  coming true because it's a real plan and the public is already caught in it so I will tell
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:23.560]  you it's real and laughed at everyone and he also wrote it in Brave New World Revisited punch that
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:29.960]  article back up I want to show TV viewers this and talk about it for radio listeners so they're
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:40.440]  saying gender-bending action hero Shizo the debut on children's network and then a demonized
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:47.320]  Breitbart News lashes out at television executives for promoting transgender themes to kids how about
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:54.240]  trying to confuse kids see cuz on top of it it's not enough to have the gay bomb the last one about
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:58.160]  the gay bomb I think it was Rachel Maddow a year ago came on air and said it wasn't real but you
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:06.600]  guys type in plan to use gay bomb on Iraqis and they've got chemicals they can spray on men to at
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:13.840]  a pheromone level make a man smell another man and and trick them that it's the smell of a woman the
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:21.560]  scent of a woman okay again even if you can't consciously smell a woman you can smell them okay
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:27.080]  your brain scanning are they fertile you know you know do they have cancer markers it's like oh it's
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:32.920]  a computer they're scanning you as well well they just Jack there it is US military pondered love
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:40.560]  not war BBC a gay bomb now I get up here and say don't drink out of the bistrenol a-line juice
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:46.080]  boxes and milk boxes and and and and the microwavable boxes that are line of bisphenol a it cooks it in
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:51.600]  to the food and is directly linked in major studies I'm saying this for over a decade
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:56.240]  because the studies have been out for 15 years to breast cancer increasing this is a big part of
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:13:03.040]  it it hyper women are going into puberty at three four five six seven years few decades ago as well
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:07.880]  girls are going to puberty at 11 or 10 now now girls are you want to prove it at age three they're
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:15.080]  having babies at age eight there's no discussion of why is this happening it's the bistrenol a it's
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:19.160]  all of it and what do they say in brave new world we will bring you to puberty at age eight you will
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:28.120]  die at age 25 if we even decide to use humanoid biomechanical robots see I'm crazy because I know
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:36.120]  too much I'm crazy because I've read hundreds of white papers and hundreds hundreds hundreds of
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:44.560]  books written by these people and listen I'll hand it to them on this front I'll hand it to
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:53.720]  the globalist on this front the British and Dutch royalty about a hundred and sixty years
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:14:00.360]  ago funded a plan to scientifically dumb down the population and bring in Malthus's Malthusian
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:06.280]  plan to reduce population that was a hundred years older than that or about 70 years older
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:12.200]  than that and then they funded the the the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute but not before the Rockefeller
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:17.520]  Foundation the Cold Springs Harbor and then Hitler set up everything they'd been planning but he went
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:23.680]  after general certain groups instead of everyone so they set him up he believed it was his plan to
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:30.240]  do all this he had a treaty with England the king of England was a Nazi lived in Germany most the
[02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:35.520]  year they double-crossed all them double-crossed the Dutch royalty had them flip back to the
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:40.640]  British run across the channel bring down Germany bring down Europe and then bring in the soft kill
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:45.160]  plan and I was reminded by my guest about this yesterday and I went and looked it back up last
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:50.920]  night I want to a piece on this that the Germans were were saying we're gonna go into these third
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:56.360]  world countries worldwide and then through food and water and vaccines we're going to sterilize
[02:14:56.360 --> 02:15:01.640]  people with systems they don't really notice and know how to deal with and that's how we're going
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:08.040]  to get rid of everybody but the Aryans well the Rothschilds and others said no that's not what's
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:18.400]  gonna happen we're gonna get rid of everybody and that is the program they just want to get rid of
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:25.400]  like 99% everybody and this is the global program this is the global plan and then you're like hey
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:33.520]  the juice box lining is making boys not go into puberty it's making their sperm counts lower it
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:40.040]  is it is shrinking the genitals of males just like it doesn't studies on rats and they go oh you

[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:09.760]  changing the human condition and coming out with vaccines that go in and eat areas of the brain to
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:16.160]  remove your emotion and remove cerebral cortex connections to areas deeper in the brain associated

[02:16:46.960 --> 02:17:02.320]  that we're premiering here on the radio here it is the New World Order seems to be trampling over
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:08.000]  our rights yet again between the latest DOJ memo that is telling managers they should support
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:13.440]  LGBT functions to the Russians being approached by the European Council and being told that they
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:19.440]  should support gay pride parades there seems to be a worldwide bullying campaign against our core
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:26.720]  family values all of that in the guise of gay rights pushing the LGBT agenda is a New World

[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:52.000]  according to the DOJ pride directive silence means disapproval and you shouldn't say husband or wife
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:57.280]  because it could offend the homosexuals in your office it says please use partner or significant
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:03.680]  other so now husband and wife are offensive isn't this hate speech against heterosexuals
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:09.440]  in London they passed a law to remove husband and wife from official British documents so don't be
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:15.120]  surprised if it happens in the United States in France they plan on removing mother and father

[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:45.520]  the people want which is to keep core family values the hypocritical DOJ directive LGBT

[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:30.160]  been right about everything i mean i knew i was right a long time ago but but now it's just all
[02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:37.840]  happening and i just keep having that moment where i can't believe it because it's so historically
[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:48.800]  dangerous so horrible so wretched so fraudulent so unfair and it targets good people and i can't
[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:53.200]  even look at the helpless public anymore without almost wanting to break down and cry because i
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:25:00.640]  just have human empathy in fact somebody gave me my cell phone i can't reach it over there

[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:23.440]  people i'm going to get to y'all and i opened up she gave me a king james version complete bible
[02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:30.640]  and then the new testament and one other little bible and i and i was sitting there at about
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:37.200]  midnight last night after everybody going to bed and i opened it up and i meant to bring it in
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:46.640]  today but then i forgot and so i found it online this morning and it's two timothy three
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:54.480]  one through four in the last days there will be very difficult times where people will love only
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:26:01.600]  themselves and their money they will be boastful and proud i guess we all are in ways i try to be
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:06.720]  arrogant back to the globalist but really that's because i'm in pain scoffing at god disobedient
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:13.680]  of their parents and ungrateful they will consider nothing sacred they will be unloving and
[02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:19.920]  unforgiving they will slander others and have no self-control they will be cruel and hate what is
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:26.480]  good they will betray their friends be reckless be puffed up with pride and love pleasure rather
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:37.040]  than god and people say yeah let's you know let's be evil it's fun it's only fun for a little while
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:42.320]  and then all hell gets released and and that's the point i've gotten to is that
[02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:49.040]  watching secret armies be built against the american people and then now watching them be
[02:26:49.040 --> 02:27:02.240]  rolled out and the government coming out and saying parents aren't the parents anymore and
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:07.120]  we're going to have a government assigned parent and and and then i mean of course if they're
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:12.400]  going to have for tv shows for five and six year olds teaching them to have sex period is
[02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:19.920]  pedophilia totally perverted and now that's all over tv for kids on mainline cartoons
[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:25.680]  of course they're putting stuff in the water to change your gender and it's not meant so there'll
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:32.000]  be a great gay cult in the sky folks that's all like the covering that it's all friendly and hey
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:38.320]  you know all of this stuff it is meant so humans are ended so everyone's alone when the state

[02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:04.000]  we're going to go to nathan we're going to go to mike we're going to go to steven arizona they've
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:08.560]  been holding a while uh people that are uh calling in the broadcast i haven't even gotten into obama
[02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:14.800]  to sign international gun control treaty on june 3rd la times admits our military is training with
[02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:20.240]  the communist chinese even the la times says it's not a good idea the globalists are double crossing
[02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:25.920]  us folks they they've decided to move their main base to china that's what henry kissinger set up
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:30.480]  that's what they've been doing america is not going to exist basically under this plan
[02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:38.640]  and uh i just can't believe how traitorous this is and and the media is demonizing the patriots
[02:34:38.640 --> 02:34:44.240]  of this country now if you type into the search engine scouts trained to fight terrorists and more
[02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:53.120]  you'll get a three-year-old um la times no no new york times article that shows the boy scouts there
[02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:57.440]  it is scouts trained to fight terrorists and more to take on disgruntled veterans and confiscate
[02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:02.480]  their guns now those kids are like 17 years old now they're 14 then look like they're 12
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:07.280]  but that's what authoritarian systems do they always get younger and younger because they'll
[02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:12.720]  do unconstitutional stuff anybody heard of the soviet youth league heard of the nazi uh hugen
[02:35:12.720 --> 02:35:19.760]  hitler hugen that's the type of stuff and i remember reading 10 years ago in the philadelphia
[02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:28.640]  uh inquirer where it was saying that they had the youth brigades in a thing called secure core part
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:34.720]  of fema a subsection of americorps training for gun confiscation warrant service during civil
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:39.760]  emergency and i read that article on air over and over again and then ron emmanuel came in four or
[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:43.680]  five years ago and said well on c-span yeah everybody's got national service we're gonna
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:48.320]  have a domestic security force just as big just as strong as our military then obama said that
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:54.240]  i've played it at nauseum probably 200 times since then then they have rachel maddow go on and go
[02:35:54.240 --> 02:35:59.280]  he's crazy there's no bullets there's no fema corps there's no armored vehicles it's like here's
[02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:06.720]  the purchase order 7 000 anti you know anti-mine tanks it's just and all the training manuals the
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:12.160]  veterans will fight a civil war our plan is to re-educate them you know before we have to execute
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:16.080]  them we're going to take them to the fema centers and it's in the army manual and everybody i know
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:19.440]  when the family and the army's like no we're training to kill everybody yeah we're training
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:23.840]  it's horrible and it's woke up most the military but still they don't even know what to do it's
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:29.520]  like a i mean the globalist takeover they should all be in jail folks i mean this plan is so
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:37.840]  diabolical so evil so public so over the top so textbook tyranny that i mean i i just i'm not even
[02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:43.280]  the one that should be doing this it should be all the top lawyers and people and talk show hosts i
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:49.760]  mean i don't want to be the only one that gets it i know you get it as listeners oh god
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:55.920]  i mean they brag the tsa going down your pants is to train you to put up with anything
[02:36:55.920 --> 02:36:57.280]  this is all domination
[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:05.120]  and then matt dubiel who i've met been under austin texas had us off about a year on wckg
[02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:08.560]  it's been all over the chicago papers got a lot of press being on there a lot of listeners
[02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:16.320]  um 15 30 wckg.com uh he he he put out a viral video that was on drudge and info wars
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:20.960]  a few years ago of his handicapped son disabled son in a wheelchair and they were harassing him
[02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:26.320]  and everything and you know and they're being rude to his son he never took credit for that
[02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:30.320]  by the way he put that out uh anonymously but he talked about it a few months ago when he was in
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:37.680]  studio well now he lives in chicago and it says femacore comes to his door you type in femacore
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:45.760]  i mean they are training to to to literally be your spies and then they have the eugen and the
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:49.920]  police that come in and get you after they're there and of course they're just priming the
[02:37:49.920 --> 02:37:54.000]  public the first time they come to your door it's not going to be hey we're here to get your guns
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:59.360]  it's here to hi we're here for talk about flooding and looking in your house and then he said it
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:03.840]  looked like a military guy that was with him and that's how i've seen it at urban drills they'll
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:11.840]  have the boy scouts with marine you know spec ops uh force recon that's marine special forces with
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:18.480]  them and on walkie talkies and stuff and and i mean it's creepville ladies and gentlemen because
[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:22.400]  i've learned to recognize these guys i probably six or seven times i've had them come up to me
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:31.360]  in a parking lot yeah there's his son uh matt dubia's son a dubiel son and if you're a tv viewer
[02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:35.360]  radio listeners hear me narrating video you can't see it go to prisonplanet.tv and you can watch it
[02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:41.280]  all right there the point here ladies and gentlemen is that this is a slow motion total
[02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:45.680]  takedown of the society they're shipping general motors to china they're turning the power plants
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:50.080]  off three of them a week at least china builds three new ones a week they are poisoning the
[02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:54.560]  water they are dumbing everybody down this is a globalist occupation if hitler would have been
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:39:00.240]  smart he'd have paid for foundations waited 20 years had him take over the the major universities
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:05.280]  with money they would have rolled in and right now we'd all be dead and it'd be you know a couple
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:11.360]  thousand nazis running around instead the globalist who had come up with a plan hitler took it changed
[02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:20.640]  it they took hitler's plan for the cia for the nasa america is a nazi plan all of it but it came
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:27.280]  it was born in england and america and went to nazi germany to be perfected and then was and then
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:31.280]  they shut him down oh no you don't get to do this we're doing it and brought it back and that's the
[02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:37.520]  whole plan and so but they've learned do it incrementally do it incrementally demonize your
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:44.320]  opponents and again it's not a nazi conspiracy it's their soft kill program because hitler was
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:48.560]  looking at once they conquered the world they were going to poison the food slowly and kill people
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:55.600]  slowly so that's a plan i mean we're under a kaiser villhelm institute attack program
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:40:03.360]  kindergarten everything is is nazi everything everything the spy grid is stasi though
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:08.160]  east german that came after that and they hired the former head of stasi so just briefly joining
[02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:13.040]  us uh matt uh we're going to ask christy and then take your calls come hell or high water here today
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:17.920]  and i got to get into the u.n treaty show so so what happened with the loving uh fema core

[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:46.080]  my my fifth grader and the other three classes of fifth graders were brought into a room and talked
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:52.880]  to about pole dancing by their principal in an organized sort of disciplinary oh no no no no

[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:44.480]  yard also and uh you know look out so i'm writing letters to the school board so that's why i was
[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:49.120]  home and and now we're calling parents because that's what we do we talk to each other to find
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:52.800]  out what's going on how do you feel oh yeah i don't know they've sent that's what i've been

[02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:04.800]  got databases so this is just a snooper well and and you know you know how it works if if there's
[02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:09.360]  one person like me that speaks up you know nine out of ten everyone else they don't they don't
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:14.240]  want to rock the boat they and i don't blame them i understand drink the flora it's time to die yeah
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:17.840]  they just want to keep quiet and do their day to day they don't want to get you know they
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:22.960]  don't want to get the stink i want to roll over and die yeah yeah so we're calling around to find
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:28.640]  out what happened with this with this disciplining and the pole dancing and as my my wife is talking
[02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:34.080]  to a neighbor another date home mother down the street she says oh by the way did fema come to
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:40.000]  your house and my wife says you know blah blah blah blah fema what do you mean fema well she
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:45.840]  says well i'm not sure if it's fema but there was a creepy guy that came knocking on my door
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:51.760]  that said he was from fema and he wanted to know if we had flood damage so sure enough i'm sitting
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:56.160]  there and i'm kind of giving my wife a look and she's giving me the look like uh-oh so and and
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:43:00.960]  literally as we're looking at each other the doorbell rings and i'm glad that we had this
[02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:06.640]  sort of pre-warning because i grabbed my iphone and just put record on and i videotaped the whole
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:11.200]  thing and the guy was at the door and sure enough he looks like the guy alice said like if you i've
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:16.320]  never been to a dead show but if you went to like the stone show or see the dead like he's the guy
[02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:21.600]  that you buy mushrooms from i'm guessing that's we don't know he does that we're putting we've
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:26.720]  got him on screen right now for radio listeners i mean very nice guy but he doesn't look like
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:31.120]  a government representative by the way can i have his number i need some mushrooms anyways i'm
[02:43:31.120 --> 02:43:41.040]  joking he uh he uh definitely uh has a badge on and whatnot but you know i've never had somebody
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:46.000]  come door to door to offer me a tax refund or offer me money and you said he had a military
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:51.360]  looking guy see him there in the video well and if you watch the end of the video after you know
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:55.600]  i just took a flyer and i said oh yeah he's wearing a he's wearing a like an fbi jacket
[02:43:55.600 --> 02:44:02.800]  style this is femur yes not only that alex but watch the end watch uh uh captain grateful dead
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:08.800]  he walks over to the military looking guy on the sidewalk and stands next to him and seemingly i
[02:44:08.800 --> 02:44:13.280]  couldn't hear him but it looked like he gave him like you know like the blow by blow like all
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:17.680]  right yeah there was a dude home uh here's what you know here's the way to land there and then
[02:44:17.680 --> 02:44:21.520]  they marked something off on the clipboard and then they walked down this tree like laverne and
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:25.040]  surely down the sidewalk and went to the rest of the house no no what they're doing is casing
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:29.920]  everything and they're even compartmentalized and don't know it's on record that femacore is
[02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:34.400]  training for quote warrant service and gun confiscation this is just first contact which

[02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:18.480]  were actually showing the martial law pictures just on screen just a second ago but the first
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:21.920]  question i have for you right out the gate is from garrett on planet forest and he says do you
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:26.800]  believe martial law is justified for specific situations well we're being based it into it just
[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:32.480]  it's kind of a soft martial law yeah the frog in the pot um but yeah meteorite hits a nuclear power
[02:48:32.480 --> 02:48:39.840]  plant melts down um tornado tears up you know 20 square miles of stuff it's martial law when they
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:44.400]  set up checkpoints want to see your papers and and you can probably justify it for that to stop
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:49.120]  looting the problem is is they permanently do it now all over the country like let me just see your
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:53.040]  papers let me let me just put you in a database let me just treat you like you're bad that is
[02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:57.040]  martial law always when they're spying on us without lawrence that's martial law right but
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:02.800]  it's not a civil emergency because a meteorite hit new york city it's a martial law because criminal
[02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:07.440]  banks took over and are using the national security state to replace the checks and balances
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:11.360]  of the government but they're doing it so slowly that the sheep don't understand the people that
[02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:14.800]  watch the mainstream media well the sheep literally have swiss cheese holes in their
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:19.760]  cerebral cortex i mean the poisons in their food no but they've cut they cut americans brains open

[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:24.320]  down the smart people and in the next phase they're going to use the horde of dumb people
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:31.360]  to help take us out and then they're going to kill them they go oh i like money he's talking like

[02:55:48.080 --> 02:55:51.280]  about everybody's like hey there's a canal you can use to swim in we thought of that
[02:55:51.840 --> 02:55:55.840]  we just want to get photos and video it's not like we want to sneak in to stare at all the
[02:55:55.840 --> 02:56:01.360]  old rotting devil worshiping men yeah you know and and then expand with food all over his face
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:09.840]  you're the coward absolutely and yeah i mean drones are an idea but see that would be

[03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:09.120]  oh hello there you have been served me well sir
[03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:18.640]  uh you know the largest religion in england now is jedi yeah i know like some internet
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:23.040]  partition went around years ago and everyone signed it and it was a big thing around here
[03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:30.080]  a few years ago um but anyway about this build-a-burg with the uh council with the
[03:01:30.080 --> 03:01:35.600]  local council making a fest a faff around about all this festival do you think they're actually
[03:01:35.600 --> 03:01:41.840]  intentionally trying to cause trouble as in um causing issues with everyone going to be there
[03:01:41.840 --> 03:01:46.960]  do you think that's part of the plan as well and if you consider the willich thing as well that
[03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:51.200]  just seems a bit too close to comfort for this build-a-burg so it seems like they're almost
[03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:57.600]  trying to set the scene up sure sure here's the deal here's the deal they don't want attention
[03:01:57.600 --> 03:02:03.120]  on this but they also love to control everything so those two things are conflicting i don't think
[03:02:03.120 --> 03:02:07.600]  they're doing this on purpose trying to make it blow up in their face politically but you've got
[03:02:07.600 --> 03:02:13.120]  me showing up david i members of ukip they're going to do whatever they can to stop parking
[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:19.280]  stop anybody getting into it um but uh you know we'll have there'll be volunteers out there from
[03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:23.520]  that are shuttling people back and forth they're not going to stop anybody everybody's just got
[03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:32.000]  to converge on this hotel as citizen press and twitter and facebook uh and and and and expose
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:37.920]  the globalist and shoot your own youtube videos and show the police you know acting like you've
[03:02:37.920 --> 03:02:41.680]  done something wrong walking down the street excuse me may i put you in a database and i go
[03:02:41.680 --> 03:02:46.240]  can i put you in a database you know in your extremist database i'm here to cover these
[03:02:46.240 --> 03:02:51.280]  criminals that i'm paying for for tax money for you to surround and act like we're planning
[03:02:51.280 --> 03:02:56.400]  something and and they're not gonna be able to stop everybody and then and i can't wait for the
[03:02:56.400 --> 03:03:02.400]  cops when i get there to come up and say excuse me license information i'll go you know full well
[03:03:02.400 --> 03:03:08.000]  i'm alex jones and then i'm here no needless to say i need to see the id and i'll have it all in
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:13.040]  video so this is all about you dominating and as soon as i do this it'll be the continuum of
[03:03:13.040 --> 03:03:16.960]  domination just like tsa sticking the hands down the pants uh you know maybe that's the new
[03:03:16.960 --> 03:03:22.000]  submission you know not not not tipping the hat but you know you get to do a proctology exam on
[03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:26.480]  me and i'm just going to sit there and illustrate how out of control they are and again if they
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:31.200]  would have just played it safe had private security up front kept people out it wouldn't
[03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:37.600]  have been a big event but now they'll have such a need to demonize protesters that they'll probably
[03:03:37.600 --> 03:03:44.560]  provocateur something but they don't do it in a vacuum we'll expose it i mean everybody knows the
[03:03:44.560 --> 03:03:48.320]  fbi went and executed this witness to the government bombing everybody knows they killed
[03:03:48.320 --> 03:03:53.040]  these fbi agents that were witnesses i mean they're just killing everybody in public it's
[03:03:53.040 --> 03:03:57.600]  not working anymore and so they'll just keep doing what they're doing this is how the soviet union
[03:03:57.600 --> 03:04:03.920]  fell so i mean they're going to continue waddling around you know with psychological and psychic
[03:04:03.920 --> 03:04:10.880]  snot dripping out of their noses speaking of snot dripping out of the noses god bless you sir hope

[03:08:32.800 --> 03:08:40.480]  from having any ammo the power to track is the power to ban the power to tax is the power to
[03:08:40.480 --> 03:08:45.680]  destroy that's exactly what they're doing with obamacare and selective taxation more and more i
[03:08:45.680 --> 03:08:52.080]  realize it is the patriotic duty of americans to not pay as many taxes as you can fight every
[03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:57.280]  ticket everything because none of it is designed to ever pay for the government it's all designed
[03:08:57.280 --> 03:09:00.960]  to bankrupt the country there's no amount of tickets you can write cops no amount of
[03:09:00.960 --> 03:09:06.080]  revenue that'll ever pay for any of it you notice as the revenue goes up everything implodes because
[03:09:06.080 --> 03:09:18.560]  it's all siphoned out of the country oh man that's a bummer i'm gonna be out of town in england
[03:09:18.560 --> 03:09:22.240]  from somebody who i really likes coming to town and wants to hang out
[03:09:24.480 --> 03:09:32.560]  anyways oh all working no playmates jack insane let's go to your phone calls you've been holding
[03:09:32.560 --> 03:09:40.080]  long enough mark in missouri you're on the air go ahead sir yeah hi mike you're on the air i'm
[03:09:40.080 --> 03:09:46.560]  sorry mike okay well that's okay thanks a lot for having me alex i just want to thank god for opening
[03:09:46.560 --> 03:09:51.280]  my eyes the first thing i would like to say you don't want to thank fluoride for all it's done
[03:09:51.280 --> 03:10:01.840]  for you no but um i recently woke up and i can understand the frustration that you have uh with
[03:10:01.840 --> 03:10:08.400]  sheeple you know just when you wake up it's kind of hard when you have people around you who are
[03:10:08.400 --> 03:10:16.960]  still asleep it's like a it's kind of frustrating it drives you crazy and i just had a question
[03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:22.320]  i mean with my eyes open i'm seeing everything progressing i'm seeing everything taking form
[03:10:22.320 --> 03:10:28.480]  taking shape i've just started reading the bible thank god and i'm seeing all this laid on the
[03:10:28.480 --> 03:10:34.480]  table when do you think that actual collapse will happen well son you're not gonna have to worry
[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:38.800]  about that because they're coming out with an anti-stress vaccine that evidence shows they
[03:10:38.800 --> 03:10:43.680]  put in some of the h1n1 as a test that actually eats the area of the brain that makes you have
[03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:49.600]  concern you're not going to feel any more pain son very soon how's that sound no no i'm not
[03:10:49.600 --> 03:10:54.240]  even being sarcastic i'm trying to just point out we're under chemical biological attack i don't
[03:10:54.240 --> 03:11:00.000]  know the hour of the day of this madness i almost wish they just accelerated because then we could
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:07.680]  really try to do something they're just creepily creeping along slicing us all up and and packaging
[03:11:07.680 --> 03:11:15.360]  all the evil things they do as if it's the best thing since you know mother's milk uh and it's
[03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:20.320]  just a general madness and what it is is evil corrupt people always make excuses for what
[03:11:20.320 --> 03:11:25.840]  they're doing or claim there's some machiavellian injustifies the means and that's not the case
[03:11:25.840 --> 03:11:36.640]  and i just cannot believe the fantastic phantasm of a system i am just flabbergasted and flummoxed
[03:11:37.520 --> 03:11:46.800]  by the fiery frustration of the frivolous frivolity frothing forth and i just want to
[03:11:46.800 --> 03:11:50.800]  try to get people to wake up and get out of their coma that's all i'm really trying to do i don't
[03:11:50.800 --> 03:11:55.120]  have all the answers i don't know what to do i just know economic factors may take place
[03:11:55.120 --> 03:12:00.080]  and whatever happens to you what kind of factors may take some spring out of the easter bunny step
[03:12:00.080 --> 03:12:05.120]  this year economic factors may take some spring out of the easter bunny step this year economic
[03:12:05.120 --> 03:12:10.240]  factors may take some spring out of the easter bunny step this year economic factors may take
[03:12:10.240 --> 03:12:16.480]  some spring out of the easter bunny step this year so there's your answer sir
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:23.120]  i'm not gonna be sarcastic you're a very touching caller and um and and you know i don't know what
[03:12:23.120 --> 03:12:25.620]  And I don't know, what do you think about what's happening?
[03:12:25.620 --> 03:12:31.460]  I mean, here's the deal, either things get crazy corrupt and people wake up and say no
[03:12:31.460 --> 03:12:35.980]  as an organic awakening at a spiritual level, and this has happened a lot in history and
[03:12:35.980 --> 03:12:41.420]  the system knows that, or they screw up everybody's compass so bad that we just kind of accept
[03:12:41.420 --> 03:12:42.420]  the craziness.
[03:12:42.420 --> 03:12:47.940]  And at the point we've reached in history, in the decadence, if it goes any further without
[03:12:47.940 --> 03:12:56.340]  being reversed, it will fall into night on Bald Mountain where every evil is released.
[03:12:56.340 --> 03:12:58.540]  I mean, what do you think?
[03:12:58.540 --> 03:13:03.700]  I personally think, because I was considered a person, I was supposed to be incarcerated
[03:13:03.700 --> 03:13:08.380]  somewhere, I was supposed to be trapped in some ghetto somewhere, but I managed to get
[03:13:08.380 --> 03:13:09.380]  out of that.
[03:13:09.380 --> 03:13:14.300]  I actually walked around with anger, but didn't even know why until I found out about my heritage.
[03:13:14.300 --> 03:13:19.700]  I didn't know anything about my culture because of what I was taught at school, and my mom
[03:13:19.700 --> 03:13:21.980]  never really gave me the information.
[03:13:21.980 --> 03:13:25.020]  But the spiritual awakening has happened-
[03:13:25.020 --> 03:13:29.540]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, sir, the Justice Department says saying mother, father, male
[03:13:29.540 --> 03:13:32.660]  or female is a hate crime.
[03:13:32.660 --> 03:13:35.900]  We don't wanna get shut down by the FCC, Bill O'Reilly's already been talking bad about
[03:13:35.900 --> 03:13:36.900]  us.
[03:13:36.900 --> 03:13:39.100]  And I'm not joking, the article's on infolwars.com.
[03:13:39.100 --> 03:13:41.780]  Justice Department says use of husband and wife is considered hate speech.
[03:13:41.780 --> 03:13:47.460]  Well, when you said mother, that's hateful as well.
[03:13:47.460 --> 03:13:50.820]  Okay, so do you wanna apologize for that right now?
[03:13:50.820 --> 03:13:57.740]  I will not, and I will not participate in the psycho games, the psychology 101 basic.
[03:13:57.740 --> 03:14:00.780]  You don't even have to have a college degree to understand it.
[03:14:00.780 --> 03:14:06.740]  Once you see through that, all the psych warfare, then you get down to the meat and bones of
[03:14:06.740 --> 03:14:11.540]  it, which is devil, God, there's a war.
[03:14:11.540 --> 03:14:12.540]  So-
[03:14:12.540 --> 03:14:13.540]  I mean-
[03:14:13.540 --> 03:14:17.420]  My gosh, this is so extreme right now.
[03:14:17.420 --> 03:14:18.420]  I was-
[03:14:18.420 --> 03:14:19.920]  Sir, what is wrong?
[03:14:19.920 --> 03:14:25.460]  What is wrong with the Justice Department threatening to arrest pro-lifers if they don't
[03:14:25.460 --> 03:14:26.460]  tell them their prayers?
[03:14:26.460 --> 03:14:32.300]  I mean, the government is supposed to know your prayers.
[03:14:32.300 --> 03:14:33.300]  I don't agree.
[03:14:33.300 --> 03:14:34.300]  I don't concur.
[03:14:34.300 --> 03:14:35.300]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:14:35.300 --> 03:14:46.740]  I was a bad parent, let's see, but I didn't know any better until I woke up.
[03:14:46.740 --> 03:14:47.740]  Good job.
[03:14:47.740 --> 03:14:50.260]  And I changed everything in my life.
[03:14:50.260 --> 03:14:51.740]  I changed everything.
[03:14:51.740 --> 03:14:58.300]  Now, I expect everybody to change with me, but now I'm coming to the conclusion and the
[03:14:58.300 --> 03:15:02.300]  understanding that everybody won't change.
[03:15:02.300 --> 03:15:08.180]  I've just come to understanding that since I progressed, it doesn't mean necessarily
[03:15:08.180 --> 03:15:13.560]  that everybody around me will, but I can only lead by example, but sometimes it drives you
[03:15:13.560 --> 03:15:20.860]  crazy because you'll see that one plus one equals two, but to them it's four, five, six,
[03:15:20.860 --> 03:15:29.220]  maybe two, maybe three, and that is the realistic, the real reality of what we're living in.
[03:15:29.220 --> 03:15:36.860]  And I truly, truly think this is basically a war against evil and good.
[03:15:36.860 --> 03:15:43.880]  I agree with you, and then evil will call good bad, and it's amazing what they've done
[03:15:43.880 --> 03:15:44.880]  to us.
[03:15:44.880 --> 03:15:46.820]  God bless you, Mike, and I'm sorry I was being sarcastic.
[03:15:46.820 --> 03:15:53.540]  I do that sometimes when I'm particularly not even so much exhausted.
[03:15:53.540 --> 03:15:59.160]  I think it is exhaustion because I get in here and I read like 100 different articles
[03:15:59.160 --> 03:16:02.700]  and when I'm at home and I get here and there's stacks of all this news and I'm just like,
[03:16:02.700 --> 03:16:03.700]  what?
[03:16:03.700 --> 03:16:07.540]  I mean, it's like, how much worse does it have to get before it gets better?
[03:16:07.540 --> 03:16:12.340]  And I think it comes down to the fact that, thank God, you were being led astray by corruption
[03:16:12.340 --> 03:16:16.220]  and all the brainwashing, but then you still had enough spirit and soul and intellect in
[03:16:16.220 --> 03:16:17.220]  you to get out of it.
[03:16:17.220 --> 03:16:21.520]  And it's like if there's any little peak of light, we can find our way out of this thing.
[03:16:21.520 --> 03:16:28.940]  And so that's why it's important for all of us that are out there to wake up others, and
[03:16:28.940 --> 03:16:31.220]  it doesn't mean we've got all the answers or we're perfect either.
[03:16:31.220 --> 03:16:34.560]  But man, we know we're going in the wrong direction.
[03:16:34.560 --> 03:16:37.100]  And that's the bottom line there.
[03:16:37.100 --> 03:16:38.100]  Great point.
[03:16:38.100 --> 03:16:40.140]  Steven in Arizona, you're on the air.
[03:16:40.140 --> 03:16:41.860]  Yes, Alex Jones.
[03:16:41.860 --> 03:16:44.860]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:16:44.860 --> 03:16:45.860]  Good.
[03:16:45.860 --> 03:16:46.860]  Alex.
[03:16:46.860 --> 03:16:47.860]  Yes.
[03:16:47.860 --> 03:16:53.700]  Can I tell you something?
[03:16:53.700 --> 03:16:59.060]  I'm concerned about, you know how you said the Justice Department was targeting conservative
[03:16:59.060 --> 03:17:00.060]  groups?
[03:17:00.060 --> 03:17:01.060]  Yes.
[03:17:01.060 --> 03:17:06.620]  Guess who else is being targeted by the Justice Department, Sheriff Joe Arpaio?
[03:17:06.620 --> 03:17:12.100]  Oh, I know, they're trying to put him in jail because he enforces the law in his area.
[03:17:12.100 --> 03:17:17.060]  I don't think Joe's perfect, but I mean, I think he's a little bit of a goofball, but
[03:17:17.060 --> 03:17:22.260]  I mean, sometimes that's good compared to, yes, the gun running Justice Department is
[03:17:22.260 --> 03:17:27.380]  going up to Sheriff Arpaio because he arrests the illegals when they commit crimes.
[03:17:27.380 --> 03:17:31.580]  And everywhere else, the illegals are basically let go or slap them arrest because they are
[03:17:31.580 --> 03:17:32.580]  illegal.
[03:17:32.580 --> 03:17:34.300]  Well, then why don't I just stop complying with everything?
[03:17:34.300 --> 03:17:38.500]  See, only the criminals in the government, the UN, and the illegals, everybody that's
[03:17:38.500 --> 03:17:42.180]  a law breaker can do whatever they want, basically.
[03:17:42.180 --> 03:17:45.580]  And then anybody that actually tries to follow the law, we're all penalized.
[03:17:45.580 --> 03:17:55.580]  Now, when there's tyranny, rebellion is absolutely what is needed, it is duty.
[03:17:55.580 --> 03:17:57.980]  When the law is tyranny, rebellion is duty.
[03:17:57.980 --> 03:18:01.640]  And I'm rebelling by resisting and speaking out, but go ahead and talk about Arpaio.
[03:18:01.640 --> 03:18:02.900]  You're calling from Arizona.
[03:18:02.900 --> 03:18:05.140]  You're saying you will be at Bilderberg, I see that on the screen?
[03:18:05.140 --> 03:18:09.300]  Yes, I will be at Bilderberg, I'll try to get there.
[03:18:09.300 --> 03:18:10.300]  Good job.
[03:18:10.300 --> 03:18:14.020]  I love you, Alex, you're my friend.
[03:18:14.020 --> 03:18:16.060]  You're my friend as well.
[03:18:16.060 --> 03:18:19.380]  Let's drink some fluoride together.
[03:18:19.380 --> 03:18:20.380]  No way.
[03:18:20.380 --> 03:18:26.820]  I kind of appreciate your call, I keep doing this fluoride thing, I keep overdoing it.
[03:18:26.820 --> 03:18:40.700]  What happens is, I'm just coming to grips with the fact that Obama actually cares about
[03:18:40.700 --> 03:18:41.700]  me.
[03:18:41.700 --> 03:18:44.740]  Oh, we have Henry Kissinger back?
[03:18:44.740 --> 03:18:49.980]  I'm your new band leader, Henry Kissinger.
[03:18:49.980 --> 03:18:50.980]  What do you want to hear?
[03:18:50.980 --> 03:18:53.380]  No, do not squeeze, only tickle.
[03:18:53.380 --> 03:18:55.780]  Oh, and let me read this here.
[03:18:55.780 --> 03:18:59.580]  Obama to sign international gun control treaty on June 3rd.
[03:18:59.580 --> 03:19:03.860]  By the way, that's a rip off of a Joe Rogan, but he does on Schwarzenegger.
[03:19:03.860 --> 03:19:06.140]  Ah, no, yeah.
[03:19:06.140 --> 03:19:12.380]  Continuing on June 3rd, President Barack Obama will sign the UN Arms Treaty, ATT.
[03:19:12.380 --> 03:19:19.020]  The ATT passed the UN General Assembly to 153 to 4 vote April 2nd.
[03:19:19.020 --> 03:19:23.620]  The treaty is ostensibly aimed at putting an end to gun trafficking across international
[03:19:23.620 --> 03:19:25.260]  boundaries.
[03:19:25.260 --> 03:19:29.500]  And both Breitbart News and the NRA have argued that it will eventually require an international
[03:19:29.500 --> 03:19:31.920]  gun registry in order to be enforceable.
[03:19:31.920 --> 03:19:36.740]  The ATT also provides, and it goes through Obama making the announcement that he's planning
[03:19:36.740 --> 03:19:37.740]  to sign that.
[03:19:37.740 --> 03:19:38.980]  So, there you go.
[03:19:38.980 --> 03:19:41.020]  Congress says they won't ratify it.
[03:19:41.020 --> 03:19:45.060]  They failed in the Senate, but it's like, who needs a stinking Senate?
[03:19:45.060 --> 03:19:46.460]  I mean, who does?
[03:19:46.460 --> 03:19:51.060]  All right, listen, Bilderberg, next time you hear from me on the radio, I would have either
[03:19:51.060 --> 03:19:55.380]  made it on the airplane to go to England or I wouldn't have, but regardless, people are
[03:19:55.380 --> 03:19:56.780]  gonna be there.
[03:19:56.780 --> 03:19:58.700]  I'm going unless they stop me.
[03:19:58.700 --> 03:20:03.700]  Bilderberg is covered at infoawards.com.
