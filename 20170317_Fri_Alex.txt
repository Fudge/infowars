[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  Is the U.S. involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling,
[00:09.000 --> 00:15.080]  anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[00:15.080 --> 00:17.480]  To Turkey?
[00:17.480 --> 00:21.600]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[00:21.600 --> 00:25.280]  How is it that this organization is so well funded, so organized?
[00:25.280 --> 00:30.160]  The Islamic state-linked militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya, seizing new
[00:30.160 --> 00:32.680]  economically vital areas of the country.
[00:32.680 --> 00:38.520]  The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel Hakim Balhaj, and of course he
[00:38.520 --> 00:40.840]  was armed to the teeth by NATO.
[00:40.840 --> 00:45.200]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:45.200 --> 00:49.720]  The Russians say they're negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military exercises.
[00:49.720 --> 00:54.680]  Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up, creating an ominous alliance against the United
[00:54.680 --> 00:55.680]  States.
[00:55.680 --> 00:56.680]  The Maxine...
[00:56.680 --> 00:57.680]  The Maxine...
[00:57.680 --> 00:58.680]  Benjamin Netanyahu...
[00:58.680 --> 00:59.680]  Maxine Waters says that...
[00:59.680 --> 01:00.680]  Putin hit...
[01:00.680 --> 01:03.480] ...the U.S. government is negotiating with Iran.
[01:03.480 --> 01:08.160]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks
[01:08.160 --> 01:09.160]  on Iran.
[01:09.160 --> 01:13.920]  We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order.
[01:13.920 --> 01:20.320]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and created an important part in events now.
[01:20.320 --> 01:24.680]  The Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of an international monetary fund aid package
[01:24.680 --> 01:29.600]  where we had broker the deal to transition power in Ukraine.
[01:29.600 --> 01:33.800]  Vladimir Putin is on the move.
[01:33.800 --> 01:39.400]  Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the
[01:39.400 --> 01:44.720]  opportunities presented by this new and involving world order.
[01:44.720 --> 02:00.200]  Here we are on Friday, March 17, 2017, I'm your host Alex Jones, I'll tell you about
[02:00.200 --> 02:05.000]  some of the special guests that are coming up a little bit later in the broadcast.
[02:05.000 --> 02:10.720]  The big news, obviously, Tillerson, that's the Secretary of State, folks, doesn't rule
[02:10.720 --> 02:13.440]  out preemptive strike on North Korea.
[02:13.440 --> 02:19.280]  And that's our headline today as we kick off the broadcast that the United States is closer
[02:19.280 --> 02:25.520]  to war with North Korea since the ceasefire was set at the end of the Korean War more
[02:25.520 --> 02:28.960]  than 50-plus years ago.
[02:28.960 --> 02:31.520]  Tillerson doesn't rule out preemptive strikes on North Korea.
[02:31.520 --> 02:39.440]  They fired scores of missiles this year right over the coastline of Japan and are openly
[02:39.440 --> 02:46.520]  threatening to use nuclear weapons on Tokyo and Seoul, South Korea, two of the most populous
[02:46.520 --> 02:48.040]  cities in the world.
[02:48.040 --> 02:51.560]  They're both in the top 10.
[02:51.560 --> 02:53.760]  Some of the leftist media is criticizing Tillerson.
[02:53.760 --> 02:57.360]  What is he supposed to do?
[02:57.360 --> 03:00.920]  When they're threatening to attack everybody, saying, well, we may have preemptive strike
[03:00.920 --> 03:06.360]  to you if we see nuclear weapons via satellite or surveillance aircraft being loaded onto
[03:06.360 --> 03:08.520]  those missiles, we're going to have to hit you.
[03:08.520 --> 03:14.280]  And at that point, they've got to decapitate the government in North Korea in Ponyongyang
[03:14.280 --> 03:22.680]  or however you pronounce it, and Kim Jong-un, little satanic third-generation communist bloodsucker.
[03:22.680 --> 03:28.360]  So again, the whole world on the edge of destruction because of centralized out-of-control communist
[03:28.360 --> 03:34.840]  dictatorships run by completely insane weaklings with everyone worshiping them because that's
[03:34.840 --> 03:38.360]  what people worship in a state-run system is weakness.
[03:38.360 --> 03:43.000]  Tillerson, preemptive military action against North Korea, an option.
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.360]  U.S. strategic patience on North Korea is over, and China needs to be cold right now.
[03:49.360 --> 03:51.960]  You were given the Panama Canal, you were given all the technology, you were given all
[03:51.960 --> 03:52.960]  this power.
[03:52.960 --> 03:57.480]  We let you send your unlimited populations over here to have their babies for free and
[03:57.480 --> 03:58.480]  become citizens.
[03:58.480 --> 04:02.200]  We don't even criticize you when you have mobile execution vans now.
[04:02.200 --> 04:04.600]  Hell, you even work with our media to help censor the American people.
[04:04.600 --> 04:06.360]  Hell, you're buying up Hollywood.
[04:06.360 --> 04:10.800]  You control North Korea, and Kim Jong-un needs to fall down and hit his head.
[04:10.800 --> 04:15.680]  That regime needs to fall, and you just stop using it as something to menace Japan and
[04:15.680 --> 04:17.200]  South Korea as your set piece.
[04:17.200 --> 04:19.040]  But China doesn't care, see?
[04:19.040 --> 04:21.600]  They're taking over the South China Sea, 90-plus percent of it.
[04:21.600 --> 04:23.800]  Historically, they had about a third of it.
[04:23.800 --> 04:28.640]  They're taking islands that have belonged to Japan and that have undisputedly belonged
[04:28.640 --> 04:34.520]  to the Philippines for hundreds and hundreds of years, and they're just taking them.
[04:34.520 --> 04:39.640]  These people live on, kicking them off and moving in or building artificial ones.
[04:39.640 --> 04:41.280]  So these are the big issues we're talking about.
[04:41.280 --> 04:43.600]  Why is all hell breaking loose now?
[04:43.600 --> 04:47.200]  It was already breaking loose during the election.
[04:47.200 --> 04:52.920]  It's all coming to a head now, and Trump is handling it exactly like most top tacticians
[04:52.920 --> 04:57.920]  and historians say he should be with strength, but controlled strength.
[04:57.920 --> 04:58.920]  We'll be back.

[08:13.360 --> 08:17.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:17.040 --> 08:22.400]  The Secretary of State says military action in the first strike is on the table against
[08:22.400 --> 08:29.400]  the belligerent, spoiled, rotten, coward and weakling Kim Jong-un, who has been threatening
[08:29.400 --> 08:39.680]  to nuke Japan, Tokyo, and nuke South Korea's capital, Seoul, to threatening open mass
[08:39.680 --> 08:45.400]  murder, the killing of tens of millions of innocent people, if everyone doesn't submit
[08:45.400 --> 08:54.320]  to him and give him more money and more food and technology transfers, that he will start
[08:54.320 --> 08:58.720]  World War III, because China will undoubtedly try to come in unless somehow they can be
[08:58.720 --> 08:59.720]  reasoned with.
[08:59.720 --> 09:01.400]  But see, they're all delusional.
[09:01.400 --> 09:08.320]  They've had power, the Communist, since 1947 in Communist China, and then of course you
[09:08.320 --> 09:14.060]  see the Korean War in the 50s there on the peninsula, and Kim Jong-un and his father
[09:14.060 --> 09:19.560]  and his father are just delusional psychopaths, or were delusional psychopaths, who believe
[09:19.560 --> 09:20.560]  they're God.
[09:20.560 --> 09:25.680]  They can't produce automobiles, they have limited electricity in only two cities, but
[09:25.680 --> 09:30.800]  they've got over 100,000 pieces of artillery aimed at the South, and they've got missiles
[09:30.800 --> 09:36.400]  given to them by Communist China that can hit Japan and hit areas of Russia, you name
[09:36.400 --> 09:41.680]  it, and now they're threatening to attack Japan and South Korea.
[09:41.680 --> 09:45.560]  And our media is saying, is Tillerson being too tough, saying military options on the
[09:45.560 --> 09:46.560]  table?
[09:46.560 --> 09:50.320]  When someone's saying, I have nuclear weapons and I'm going, got the quotes here, he broadcast
[09:50.320 --> 09:57.640]  it two days ago, Kim Jong-un, to annihilate you and unleash hell and death in New Cube,
[09:57.640 --> 10:05.400]  you then got to ask yourself, why on earth did Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton in the
[10:05.400 --> 10:12.160]  1990s through ABB allow the transfer of nuclear reactors bi-partisimally, but they haunch
[10:12.160 --> 10:19.160]  showed it, to North Korea so they could then create the fissile material for atomic bombs.
[10:19.160 --> 10:21.160]  And why did they transfer to China?
[10:21.160 --> 10:26.680]  The booster technology, the separation technology, the guidance technology, the warhead miniaturization
[10:26.680 --> 10:40.000]  technology, the multiple reentry device technology, from launch to reentry to guidance to counter
[10:40.000 --> 10:49.440]  systems so that missiles can't shoot down your missile, all of it transferred and given
[10:49.440 --> 10:51.960]  to them.
[10:51.960 --> 10:55.640]  That's the globalist, that's the new world order.
[10:55.640 --> 10:58.880]  That's Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.
[10:58.880 --> 11:06.200]  On record, they gave our basic MX missile technology that wasn't even developed to the late 70s
[11:06.200 --> 11:16.280]  and early 80s, gave them 15 years later, 16 years later, those advanced ICBM technologies.
[11:16.280 --> 11:22.160]  Just remember that.
[11:22.160 --> 11:33.440]  Just let that sink in and the very same people have now announced in Europe that if you criticized
[11:33.440 --> 11:37.760]  Islam, you'll be arrested and they started flagging people five years ago with Facebook,
[11:37.760 --> 11:43.000]  Twitter and Google, even mildly criticized Islam and said it's incompatible with our
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.520]  open free societies that they would restrict you, block you, not let you surf, not let
[11:48.520 --> 11:50.520]  you share.
[11:50.520 --> 11:55.200]  Then three years ago, they started finding people in Germany, in Sweden, in Denmark and
[11:55.200 --> 11:56.200]  in France.
[11:56.200 --> 12:03.840]  Then a year ago, they started coming and arresting you at your home.
[12:03.840 --> 12:08.520]  The leader in the French presidential election, Le Pen, was charged with a felony last year
[12:08.520 --> 12:12.720]  of criticizing Islam, it's illegal in France.
[12:12.720 --> 12:16.880]  She said it's as big a threat as we face in World War II to our sovereignty, totally true,
[12:16.880 --> 12:17.880]  completely true.
[12:17.880 --> 12:22.200]  The Nazis let the French have their French culture, the Nazis were bad, you could say
[12:22.200 --> 12:26.240]  Islam is even greater threat because it won't let you have your original culture.
[12:26.240 --> 12:31.480]  The Nazis saw French culture as pretty much Germanic and said, sure, keep your culture,
[12:31.480 --> 12:36.360]  that will steal your artwork and your wine.
[12:36.360 --> 12:38.920]  So the Germans and the French are pretty related.
[12:38.920 --> 12:43.960]  The point is, that's a totally true statement, they've lifted her immunity, she's a member
[12:43.960 --> 12:50.680]  of the EU parliament and they're now prosecuted.
[12:50.680 --> 12:58.200]  So what's the new news, Google to target criticism of Islam in new censorship purge, they announced
[12:58.200 --> 13:01.880]  yesterday they're going to censor anything that claims fake news, anything that's critical,
[13:01.880 --> 13:04.040]  anything that's hurtful, anything that they don't think's pertinent.
[13:04.040 --> 13:10.440]  Oh, it's not pertinent, your opinion or UV, not even something that they see as anti-establishment.
[13:10.440 --> 13:16.920]  This is a desperation move, website that describes Islam as intolerant, listed as example of
[13:16.920 --> 13:19.440]  upsetting or offensive.
[13:19.440 --> 13:25.280]  So if something upsets you, millions pouring across the borders, the murders, the rapes,
[13:25.280 --> 13:28.280]  the imams saying your women belong to us, you're weak, we're going to conquer you, the
[13:28.280 --> 13:33.720]  fact that they've bought off our leadership, don't show photos of them saying, but head
[13:33.720 --> 13:39.320]  those who insult Islam, oh yeah, in England, they send the police to your house if you
[13:39.320 --> 13:43.200]  go to an Islamic event outdoors where they're having a demonstration and show them saying
[13:43.200 --> 13:47.560]  we're going to take over and kill you, we're going to enslave you, you're bad for showing
[13:47.560 --> 13:49.680]  them saying that.
[13:49.680 --> 13:55.640]  So Google now, what started five years ago in Germany, I've told people a thousand times
[13:55.640 --> 13:59.680]  or more every week, almost every day, I say everything you see in Europe will be brought
[13:59.680 --> 14:06.320]  here next, this is a global rollout, infowars.com, Google to target criticism of Islam in new
[14:06.320 --> 14:11.600]  censorship purge, going to get more of that, and that ties into this, judge considers ordering
[14:11.600 --> 14:18.560]  President Trump to double 50,000 refugees inflow the United States, citing the UN folks,
[14:18.560 --> 14:23.800]  it's the UN refugee program that already dictated what we would take, we would just accept them
[14:23.800 --> 14:29.200]  and they're quote vetting that Syrians, that really weren't even Syrians, people coming
[14:29.200 --> 14:35.840]  out of areas of Palestine, the West Bank, people coming out of Libya that's a failed
[14:35.840 --> 14:41.800]  state, Sudan a failed state, of course the big ones Somalia totally failed, road warrior
[14:41.800 --> 14:47.680]  state, and now inverting reality, the judges aren't just the executives or the legislative
[14:47.680 --> 14:54.880]  or the judicial, they're just God and say you will, I have the statement of the judge,
[14:54.880 --> 14:59.160]  you're going to let more in Mr. President, not only is the President under law the authorization
[14:59.160 --> 15:06.600]  to block these people, now the judge says oh no, you're going to have a quota just like
[15:06.600 --> 15:16.080]  the EU and the UN Google this, EU threatens France, Germany, the Netherlands, just search
[15:16.080 --> 15:24.920]  EU threatens member states with fines for not increasing the migrants, 5 million the
[15:24.920 --> 15:31.080]  last 4 years at least, and that's not enough, the UN over and over again is threatening
[15:31.080 --> 15:39.440]  giant fines, in fact search this, EU and UN, EU threatens fines on UK for not letting in
[15:39.440 --> 15:43.880]  more refugees, EU threatens member states with fines over failure to accept refugees,
[15:43.880 --> 15:48.200]  boom, zero hedge and then it links through to a bunch of mainstream news articles, yahoo
[15:48.200 --> 15:54.880]  news, associated press, it's all right there, you see and we are now under the exact same
[15:54.880 --> 16:00.400]  program, under Obama just 3 months ago, he accelerated the number and remember out of
[16:00.400 --> 16:05.360]  Latin America it was all the Islamists and others coming in Latin America, Central America,
[16:05.360 --> 16:10.880]  they were down there, the UN running the refugee program telling us who to bring in, that's
[16:10.880 --> 16:17.560]  UN control, it isn't UN soldiers we're going to face, it's just UN regulation and control,
[16:17.560 --> 16:24.080]  so here is judge considers ordering President Trump to double 50,000 refugees, a demand
[16:24.080 --> 16:28.040]  by the judge that the federal government air bus in and extra 50,000 immigrants including
[16:28.040 --> 16:32.600]  many adherents of Islam Tria law, which says they all live with her, our law into American
[16:32.600 --> 16:36.720]  neighborhoods would be an unusual intervention in the government roles normally left to the
[16:36.720 --> 16:41.920]  elected president in Congress, that's a nice way of saying it at Breitbart, and it just
[16:41.920 --> 16:49.720]  goes on and on and on and the judges are now issuing executive orders, I didn't know they
[16:49.720 --> 16:56.080]  were the executive branch but it's a total lawless rebellion, the VA says we're not
[16:56.080 --> 17:00.200]  hanging up pictures of the president or the VA head, Congressman goes there with the proper
[17:00.200 --> 17:05.520]  size picture, hangs it up, they take it down and just say hey we run this country, you
[17:05.520 --> 17:11.640]  understand, sit down and shut up, we want to give ICBM technology to the Chai comms,
[17:11.640 --> 17:15.680]  we're giving it to them, you want to give atomic weapon production facilities to North
[17:15.680 --> 17:21.660]  Korea, we're doing it, want to open up Europe's borders bringing 5 million, 80% military
[17:21.660 --> 17:27.360]  aged men, they're allowed to rape, kill, murder whoever they want, we're doing it, and we're
[17:27.360 --> 17:30.160]  going to teach your five year old, they're not really a boy, they're a girl, we're going
[17:30.160 --> 17:33.120]  to teach your girl they're really a boy, and by the way the atherazine, all the other
[17:33.120 --> 17:37.280]  chemicals of water in every major study in mammals, amphibians you name it, shows it
[17:37.280 --> 17:45.080]  creates asexualization, your kid gets confused, wonders why they're a beta, then the school
[17:45.080 --> 17:49.400]  gets involved sexually with your kids and tells them go to this special class and they
[17:49.400 --> 17:55.520]  induct them into the new 100 genders, it was 50 genders just a year ago, then they say
[17:55.520 --> 17:59.840]  you're against people that are a different gender, or people that identify as being a
[17:59.840 --> 18:04.280]  dog or a baby or a 50 year old man, says they're a 6 year old kid, so they want to play with
[18:04.280 --> 18:09.400]  your daughter, this is mental illness to bring down the society, and they admit it and there's
[18:09.400 --> 18:14.960]  countless white papers, doesn't mean I hate somebody, there's always been a feminine
[18:14.960 --> 18:19.680]  men and stuff like that in history, the statistics I have numbers here today, the number of children
[18:19.680 --> 18:25.200]  wanting to become opposite sex doubling each year in Sweden, say doctors, within only 15
[18:25.200 --> 18:30.240]  years the majority would have switched sexes, and then you notice though they can't procreate
[18:30.240 --> 18:38.080]  mission completed, that's an exponential growth curve, your kids don't learn how to be successful,
[18:38.080 --> 18:46.000]  they learn how to die, how to not have children, meanwhile they bring an absolute lawless groups
[18:46.000 --> 18:54.120]  that openly believe and their imams have told them are here to conquer, judges inventing
[18:54.120 --> 18:57.840]  new reasons to obstruct Donald Trump's popular immigration reforms that are lawful, turkey
[18:57.840 --> 19:02.680]  threatens to send 15,000 refugees per month into Europe to quote, blow its mind as part
[19:02.680 --> 19:08.840]  of an announcement by their foreign secretary to the EU and by Ergun, we covered this yesterday,
[19:08.840 --> 19:13.320]  there's new reports today, new statements, new arrogance, saying quote, we are launching
[19:13.320 --> 19:19.040]  our holy war now and we'll capture Europe.
[19:19.040 --> 19:23.000]  Just on Monday I said all these political rallies are holding in major cities, saying
[19:23.000 --> 19:29.000]  vote for people back in Turkey, that's just mobilizing their political forces inside your
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.840]  countries and now Ergun admits it and says we weren't just trying to rally, you are weak,
[19:34.840 --> 19:39.400]  you will bow down politically, they know, they know the cuckled broke back Germans and
[19:39.400 --> 19:45.120]  French and others, won't just bend over themselves, they'll bend over their families, they'll
[19:45.120 --> 19:49.720]  throw people out of their homes, it's happening in Italy, can we show you the video of the
[19:49.720 --> 19:55.760]  80 something year old man in his little hotel being thrown out crying for the North African
[19:55.760 --> 20:04.680]  refugees, two men have throat slit in Paris, attacker yells a la Akbar, but the government
[20:04.680 --> 20:09.200]  says it's not Islamic, it's like the hatchet attack, there's just rule wasn't, a la Akbar,
[20:09.200 --> 20:15.280]  a la Akbar, a la Akbar, a la Akbar.
[20:15.280 --> 20:21.720]  Man held after his father and brother found with their throat slit in Paris, meanwhile
[20:21.720 --> 20:26.440]  the feds still under a level of control that the justice department are saying, they're
[20:26.440 --> 20:32.320]  trying to clean house there, they try to block Montana's controversial law, a bill advancing
[20:32.320 --> 20:38.640]  in Montana, not yet a law that says you can't have foreign government laws over federal
[20:38.640 --> 20:42.960]  state or local laws, that's just common sense, it bans the application of foreign laws in
[20:42.960 --> 20:49.560]  Montana, so that's all coming up, I'm going to go back into that more, but don't worry
[20:49.560 --> 20:53.560]  even the Miami Herald now sounds like info wars and criticizes communism, which is unheard
[20:53.560 --> 20:58.960]  of nowadays, Venezuela has a bread shortage, the government has decided bakers are the
[20:58.960 --> 21:05.680]  problem and is arresting them in mass, just like any other communist country, giant lines,
[21:05.680 --> 21:14.200]  no food, starvation, but lots of people with badges, but no real rule of law, a government
[21:14.200 --> 21:21.800]  of conquest, not of renaissance, just like North Korea, and that brings us to the next
[21:21.800 --> 21:27.520]  big story after I cover this, I'm getting back into North Korea, Google to target criticism
[21:27.520 --> 21:31.360]  of Islam in new censorship purge, when I read this article from zero head, she was a great
[21:31.360 --> 21:36.640]  publication just does boil up boil nouns of big breaking news, they just took articles
[21:36.640 --> 21:41.880]  that are in the major New York newspapers and the Washington Post, where they put it
[21:41.880 --> 21:44.960]  out like it's a great idea in the Washington Post and New York Times and actually show
[21:44.960 --> 21:51.360]  the bill, New York Assemblyman unveils bill to suppress non government approved free
[21:51.360 --> 21:57.560]  speech, now I read that and I thought it can't be that bad, and I actually read the
[21:57.560 --> 22:04.520]  bill, everything is banned, but what government says and special Democrat boards, I guess
[22:04.520 --> 22:10.400]  in Democrat cities will then use government money to sue you saying it's a hate speech
[22:10.400 --> 22:16.200]  or improper speech to shut you down, that's been the new thing, suing folks for defamation
[22:16.200 --> 22:21.120]  for simply covering bigger larger stories, and then having handpicked juries and kangaroo
[22:21.120 --> 22:26.160]  courts annihilate free speech, that's the new announcement in Europe and here, and they're
[22:26.160 --> 22:32.200]  announcing giant 50 plus million dollar euro fines, if you have one thing that you says
[22:32.200 --> 22:36.400]  you shouldn't have in your search engine to make Google and Facebook and everyone comply
[22:36.400 --> 22:41.320]  with the tyranny, just like China, communist China is telling Facebook, Google, Twitter,
[22:41.320 --> 22:46.760]  censor better and we'll let you back in, prove with your own people, China involved in our
[22:46.760 --> 22:50.320]  domestic operations and so that's why it's all rolling out, that's why they don't care
[22:50.320 --> 22:54.080]  Trump's in, the corporations and the media don't care, it's why they came out and lied
[22:54.080 --> 22:59.200]  and said, and bullied all these agencies to say there's no proof of wiretaps against
[22:59.200 --> 23:02.480]  Trump because we have all these secret treaties with England that they spy on us, we spy on
[23:02.480 --> 23:07.120]  them, it's been declassified, they admitted the New York Times that Trump was quote being
[23:07.120 --> 23:13.840]  wiretapped, but that's not the proper name, it's surveilled or intercepted, and now Trump
[23:13.840 --> 23:18.320]  comes out and they go, look he's backing off, he's using the scientific term now, they play
[23:18.320 --> 23:25.160]  lawyer games folks, they admitted they had transcripts of Flynn and others, intercepted,
[23:25.160 --> 23:33.240]  but that's okay, in a bill aimed at securing a right to be forgotten, sounds like a nice
[23:33.240 --> 23:38.440]  way to get yourself off the web, but see the actual bill isn't a way to get BS about you
[23:38.440 --> 23:43.160]  off the web, which just gets buried nobody believes all the garbage anyways, it's like
[23:43.160 --> 23:48.280]  10 women online saying I was married to them and had kids and all this crazy stuff, people
[23:48.280 --> 23:54.920]  are like, wow what is this, it's craziness, but people now know a decade later that it's
[23:54.920 --> 24:00.760]  just baloney, imagine being a public figure folks, New York Assemblyman unveils bill that
[24:00.760 --> 24:05.040]  suppress non-government approved pre-speech, in a bill aimed at securing a right to be
[24:05.040 --> 24:13.400]  forgotten introduced by Tillman David I. Werpen, a Senate bill 4561 by State Senator
[24:13.400 --> 24:19.080]  Tony Avila, liberal New York politician would require people to remove inaccurate, irrelevant
[24:19.080 --> 24:25.560]  or inadequate or excessive statements about others, excessive statements, wow, within
[24:25.560 --> 24:30.040]  30 days of request from an individual, so I already see the social justice warriors
[24:30.040 --> 24:33.840]  when they go beat somebody up or threaten somebody or run screaming at you, they then
[24:33.840 --> 24:38.720]  say you have no right to be on your camera, happens to our crew all the time, happens
[24:38.720 --> 24:43.040]  to us in Austin in New York, you name it, you're like you're in a public place in my
[24:43.040 --> 24:48.000]  face, you've come to a rally, I'm here covering it, no I have a right, they go file almost
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.600]  daily at YouTube and Facebook, we see the file come in, we have to respond and say as
[24:53.600 --> 24:59.240]  you can see, YouTube, we're at a downtown rally of the SJWs and they're in our face
[24:59.240 --> 25:07.480]  threatening violence on us, but that's just that one section, they say take me off your
[25:07.480 --> 25:15.800]  news site, you don't, well now you're going to jail, all search engines and online speakers
[25:15.800 --> 25:20.960]  shall remove content about such individuals and links or indexes to any of the same that
[25:20.960 --> 25:26.280]  is inaccurate, irrelevant, inadequate or excessive, oh and of course they define this, just you
[25:26.280 --> 25:31.160]  complain it happens, and without replacing such removed content with a disclaimer, take
[25:31.160 --> 25:36.640]  down notice, inaccurate, irrelevant, inadequate or excessive shall mean content, which after
[25:36.640 --> 25:41.920]  significant lapse in time with its first publication is no longer materials of the current public
[25:41.920 --> 25:45.960]  debate or discourse, so they want to tell news archives aren't allowed now, literally
[25:45.960 --> 25:50.360]  that's what this says, you couldn't have a stronger ban on free speech, especially when
[25:50.360 --> 25:55.640]  considered in light of the financial, reputational and or demonstrable harm that the information
[25:55.640 --> 26:00.160]  is causing, this is also banning rating sites, which they've been trying to do, so banning
[26:00.160 --> 26:04.680]  you voting in the free market of ideas of what you thought was better food, better clothing,
[26:04.680 --> 26:10.560]  better shelter, better service, better doctors, no, is causing the requesters profession,
[26:10.560 --> 26:15.000]  finance, reputation or others interest, and they just claim it, no judge, no jury, this
[26:15.000 --> 26:19.520]  is all in the TPP but see it got killed, and see normally this is international treaties
[26:19.520 --> 26:23.640]  or national laws, this is happening locally where the democrats wherever they're at are
[26:23.640 --> 26:29.360]  just banning guns, banning speech, all their normal tyranny, with the exception of content
[26:29.360 --> 26:34.280]  related to convicted felons, legal matters relating to violence, that's other laws they
[26:34.280 --> 26:37.840]  have on the place that the left uses, or a matter that is of significant current public
[26:37.840 --> 26:42.160]  interest as to switch ever the requesters role with regard to the matter is central
[26:42.160 --> 26:46.280]  and substantial, failure to comply it would make the search engines of speakers liable
[26:46.280 --> 26:50.560]  for at least statutory damages, $250 a day plus attorneys fees, and then if you don't
[26:50.560 --> 26:56.960]  do those, there's all this criminal stuff, the Washington Post under the bill, newspapers,
[26:56.960 --> 27:03.720]  scholarly works, copies of books on Google and Amazon, it would all be banned, so there
[27:03.720 --> 27:09.280]  you go folks, they have to shut down speech because they're being destroyed, they're being
[27:09.280 --> 27:14.120]  exposed, Google to target criticism of Islam in new censorship purge, I'm going to get
[27:14.120 --> 27:18.160]  to this when we come back, get into North Korea, get into the latest clips we have and
[27:18.160 --> 27:23.920]  more Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State, talking about military options being on the table
[27:23.920 --> 27:30.360]  but before I go any further, we fund ourselves 70% or so with direct sales of high quality

[29:03.080 --> 29:08.160]  I lost another 30 or so and gained a lot of muscle and I'm still husky, but man, I've
[29:08.160 --> 29:14.880]  got 10% the belly fat I had and I'm a lot healthier and really owe it to these fine

[29:42.760 --> 29:47.000]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side with some of the biggest World
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.640]  War three news ever seen.
[29:50.640 --> 29:54.360]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:54.360 --> 30:01.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.720 --> 30:04.840]  You've heard of lab grown beef and a petri dish.
[30:04.840 --> 30:09.280]  You've heard of chick oids that are kept secure, force fed and have their beaks removed.
[30:09.280 --> 30:13.200]  Well, now get ready for finger licking lab grown chicken.
[30:13.200 --> 30:17.680]  That's right, Memphis meats is one of a cadre of startups racing to create meat that doesn't
[30:17.680 --> 30:19.240]  involve killing animals.
[30:19.240 --> 30:23.960]  The firm's approach to what it calls clean meat is to culture animal cells in a lab,
[30:23.960 --> 30:27.320]  feed them nutrients until they grow into pieces large enough to cook and eat.
[30:27.320 --> 30:30.720]  You've probably seen where companies like this have grown beef in petri dishes.
[30:30.720 --> 30:32.480]  Well now it's going to be chicken strips.
[30:32.480 --> 30:36.560]  And I know the question on everybody's mind is, does the lab grown chicken taste like
[30:36.560 --> 30:37.560]  chicken?
[30:37.560 --> 30:41.520]  In the Wall Street Journal, it was reported spongier than a whole chicken breast.
[30:41.520 --> 30:44.920]  But they nearly nailed the flavor of the traditional variety.
[30:44.920 --> 30:49.200]  This is all part of the globalist plan to remove you from the natural world and place
[30:49.200 --> 30:55.160]  you into an artificially created VR induced world where they control everything you see,
[30:55.160 --> 30:57.440]  smell, taste, think and touch.

[31:17.840 --> 31:20.660]  disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[31:20.660 --> 31:23.920]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone

[32:22.640 --> 32:29.200]  When I was a boy it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie, gobs
[32:29.200 --> 32:37.000]  and school, morality had a future and beef was for supper, revelation, dawn of global
[32:37.000 --> 32:38.000]  government.
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.640]  We're the solution, Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that.
[32:41.640 --> 32:47.320]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin, theatrical
[32:47.320 --> 32:53.120]  screenings on demand, DVDs now available, want to shed some tears over the red, white
[32:53.120 --> 33:19.320]  and blue, Americans need to see this film, Revelation the movie dot info, let's fix it.
[33:19.320 --> 33:34.760]  Allying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, it's Alex Jones, just like witches
[33:34.760 --> 33:45.320]  that black masses, evil minds that plot destruction, Trump was supposed to meet with Merkel an
[33:45.320 --> 33:49.720]  hour ago, never happened, so we're going to have that obviously when that comes up, Trump
[33:49.720 --> 33:53.200]  set with the press conference also in the middle of the next hour, so we'll also be
[33:53.200 --> 33:57.800]  going to that.
[33:57.800 --> 34:01.960]  Let me just recap what I just covered earlier before I get into the situation with North
[34:01.960 --> 34:05.880]  Korea and the fact that the Secretary of State has said that all options are on the table
[34:05.880 --> 34:11.720]  including a first strike after North Korea threatened a strike on Tokyo in Japan, the
[34:11.720 --> 34:17.480]  most popular city in Japan, and Seoul, the most popular city in South Korea on the Korean
[34:17.480 --> 34:25.320]  peninsula, bordering the madman lunatic spoiled rotten caricature of out of touch tyranny,
[34:25.320 --> 34:32.040]  like a SJW entitled little mass murderer who had his brother murdered a few weeks ago with
[34:32.040 --> 34:34.560]  nerve gas.
[34:34.560 --> 34:40.440]  What an uncool jerk, are you guys concerned changing to click images, North Korea at night
[34:40.440 --> 34:46.040]  from satellite, satellite photos of North Korea at night, two little lights, South Korea
[34:46.040 --> 34:51.640]  is all lit up, South Korea probably has the highest industrialization in the world, super
[34:51.640 --> 34:59.000]  wealthy on average, super free, and just look at communism, if you're a TV viewer, lights
[34:59.000 --> 35:06.040]  out, lights out in the super max, lights out, worship government, like they do in Venezuela
[35:06.040 --> 35:10.420]  now, how's that working out for you there, there's old Japan, look at all the lights
[35:10.420 --> 35:21.120]  on in Japan, oh, but they're worshiping communism in the other country, sorry, sawing, no electricity,
[35:21.120 --> 35:27.200]  like if you blow it up with just one little dot of the main command center, a seven story
[35:27.200 --> 35:32.760]  pleasure palace, and they kidnap Japanese film stars that he wants to have sex with
[35:32.760 --> 35:37.880]  his dad wants to, and his dad has $5,000 bottles of wine, I mean it is just the ultimate
[35:37.880 --> 35:46.000]  satanism, total and complete selfishness, but our government gave them the reactors
[35:46.000 --> 35:52.280]  in the 90s, and gave the other psychos to the north, the Chinese commies, the missiles
[35:52.280 --> 35:58.320]  to deliver them and to hit every major city in the United States, thank you Bill Clinton,
[35:58.320 --> 36:06.200]  thank you Hillary, I'm sorry I said there were two spots of light, you see hundreds
[36:06.200 --> 36:10.560]  in South Korea, I'm sorry there's one, two, three, four, five, six, you notice most of
[36:10.560 --> 36:16.000]  them are right on the border, where they have little border exchanges and sell raw material,
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.480]  but before I get into that, look at this, McDouble is the cheapest and most nutritious
[36:21.480 --> 36:25.760]  food in human history, the London Telegraphs reporting, that's the press release put out
[36:25.760 --> 36:35.320]  by McDonald's, that's right, it's the cheapest and most nutritious food in human history,
[36:35.320 --> 36:43.840]  looks like Al Gore saying invented the internet, I mean it's a whopper folks, Burger King pun
[36:43.840 --> 36:49.080]  intended, I know there's not a grocer looking hamburger I've ever seen, but you know what,
[36:49.080 --> 36:52.680]  guess who their press secretary is, guess who the head of communications is, you wonder
[36:52.680 --> 36:57.960]  where he went, the longest running, they had quite a few in the Obama administration, but
[36:57.960 --> 37:05.880]  the longest running press secretary in the Obama administration, Mr. Gibbs, and oh he's
[37:05.880 --> 37:09.880]  the one obviously sending the tweet out about little hands and now Trump's just come back,
[37:09.880 --> 37:15.440]  oh but it was an accident, oh oh yeah sure, I don't believe anything out of a known liar
[37:15.440 --> 37:20.080]  that says oh we lie to the public about drones and about Obamacare and thank God they're
[37:20.080 --> 37:34.960]  so dumb and MSNBC laughs with him, that's okay, don't criticize them because New York
[37:34.960 --> 37:41.360]  Assemblyman unveils bill to suppress non-government approved free speech, Google to target criticism
[37:41.360 --> 37:47.680]  of Islam in new censorship purge in the United States, anything upsetting or offensive to
[37:47.680 --> 37:51.400]  Islam will be banned, see they're bringing something incompatible, the most radical forms
[37:51.400 --> 37:55.960]  of orthodox Wahhabism, where I'm upset a woman doesn't have a hood overhead, so the first
[37:55.960 --> 37:59.680]  step is the mayor of Cologne, a big trendy lady going ladies don't wear short skirts
[37:59.680 --> 38:04.920]  and by the way we can't have Oktoberfest on the streets, the Muslims get mad, gotta go
[38:04.920 --> 38:11.400]  in the beer hall, do you believe they put up with that, that's in the news, do not drink
[38:11.400 --> 38:15.360]  beer on the street, the Muslims get mad, how about you get in my face and hit me, I'm
[38:15.360 --> 38:18.840]  gonna fight back but no, the Germans have been bought, roll over, pee on themselves,
[38:18.840 --> 38:22.480]  literally, I'm not kidding, actually teacher in the United States for being raped, crap
[38:22.480 --> 38:27.600]  on yourself, so I'm not kidding, it's about total submission, they can make you submit
[38:27.600 --> 38:34.000]  to Muslims, outsiders, you'll submit to anybody, and I was the guy 15 years ago, we hear all
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.440]  this talk about, they're gonna make us go under Sharia, they bought off the CIA people,
[38:37.440 --> 38:41.720]  Islam's gonna take over, I'm like oh ridiculous, sure there's a lot of bad areas with Islam,
[38:41.720 --> 38:45.640]  it's out of control, we don't need to bomb those areas and stir them up, but we were
[38:45.640 --> 38:50.280]  actually bombing them, I was completely right, to put the bad ones in charge and to open
[38:50.280 --> 38:55.440]  up Turkey, oh and Turkey's in the news saying we're colonizing you, holy war, we've activated
[38:55.440 --> 39:02.280]  our political groups, we've got millions of Turks per European country, millions, and
[39:02.280 --> 39:07.480]  we're ready to burn everything down, submit, and Europe is actually announcing capitulation
[39:07.480 --> 39:17.320]  to Islamic domination and terror, unbelievable, yeah there's Yahoo, AFP, but that's not even
[39:17.320 --> 39:22.160]  strong enough, Turkey threatens to send Europe 50,000 refugees a month to dominate them,
[39:22.160 --> 39:27.240]  what they said is, this is now a holy war, we're activating our forces, submit, that's
[39:27.240 --> 39:34.040]  what the foreign minister said, but that's okay, Robert Gibbs tells us that the McDouble,
[39:34.040 --> 39:39.360]  this is the best comedy ever, is the cheapest and most nutritious food in human history,
[39:39.360 --> 39:44.760]  if that ain't fake news, I don't know what is, oh but see, I've been judged by Google
[39:44.760 --> 39:52.000]  and by a Harvard list, they're now circulating, that I'm fake, everything you've heard me
[39:52.000 --> 39:59.000]  say for 39 minutes is currently happening, most of it's from their own mouths, we're
[39:59.000 --> 40:05.160]  the opposite of fake, and they know it, and that's why they're scared, was Obama Trump
[40:05.160 --> 40:09.320]  insider Gibbs behind McDonald's anti-Trump tweet, he is the chief communications officer,
[40:09.320 --> 40:13.440]  well we know this, he's the one thing behind telling us that McDouble is the cheapest and
[40:13.440 --> 40:21.760]  most nutritious food in human history, I can't say that enough, oh, hey, do you hear the
[40:21.760 --> 40:30.320]  most nutritious and inexpensive food, it's both, in history, is the McDouble, describing
[40:30.320 --> 40:36.920]  the McDonald's double cheese burger as the cheapest, most nutritious and bountiful food
[40:36.920 --> 40:42.480]  that has ever clogged a colon, I'm sorry I didn't say that, describing the McDonald's,
[40:42.480 --> 40:50.200]  their food will not rot under glass, everything else does, describing, describing Kim Jong
[40:50.200 --> 40:55.760]  Un as the most dashing, handsome man, they say if it's cloudy it becomes sunny when he's
[40:55.760 --> 41:01.280]  out and birds sing and flowers begin to germinate, it's as if he has the very life force, Kim
[41:01.280 --> 41:07.840]  Jong Un once took on 17 different men at one time and beat them all up, those are real
[41:07.840 --> 41:13.680]  stories they tell about him, and his father, see it's just as ridiculous, just as ridiculous
[41:13.680 --> 41:17.600]  about North Korea, North Korea has the highest production and highest standard of living and
[41:17.600 --> 41:23.840]  highest education in the world, official North Korean news agency, actually say that, oh
[41:23.840 --> 41:28.600]  they also say here you can keep your doctor under Obamacare, it's free, if you have your
[41:28.600 --> 41:32.760]  business you didn't build it, two plus two doesn't necessarily equal four, those are
[41:32.760 --> 41:37.040]  all real statements they made, who's the fake news, they're trying to break your will and
[41:37.040 --> 41:41.720]  condition you to accept it, make a double, here let's read the London Telegraph article,
[41:41.720 --> 41:45.200]  we ought to have articles every day about McDonald's tweets because they're just the
[41:45.200 --> 41:51.080]  biggest load of horsemener, horsemener obviously is more nutritious in my opinion, the public
[41:51.080 --> 41:57.320]  say fake news, he claims horsemener is more nutritious, I bet it is, the plants, McDouble
[41:57.320 --> 42:02.240]  is the cheapest I'm reading and most nutritious food in human history, here let me read the
[42:02.240 --> 42:06.560]  British accent I'll be more authoritative, McDouble is the cheapest and most nutritious
[42:06.560 --> 42:12.200]  food in human history, describing the McDonald's double cheeseburger as the cheapest, most
[42:12.200 --> 42:16.560]  nutritious and multiple food that has ever existed in human history, close quote, might
[42:16.560 --> 42:21.880]  seem fanciful, no it might seem like an outrageous giant colossal biggest line in history, but
[42:21.880 --> 42:28.440]  I'm sorry, might seem beyond fanciful, but according to the author of Freakonomics it's
[42:28.440 --> 42:35.600]  not as absurd as suggestion as it appears, that's right, that's it's actually true, the
[42:35.600 --> 42:45.740]  McDonald's is the best on earth, it's wonderful, sorry, there you go, now let's get to something
[42:45.740 --> 42:51.960]  even more ridiculous because I've told this story probably a hundred times in 22 years
[42:51.960 --> 43:00.240]  on air because it happened about a year, it happened about a year, let me just reset there
[43:00.240 --> 43:06.600]  because this is such a big deal, this is so ultramassive and it just illustrates everything
[43:06.600 --> 43:13.840]  we're dealing with, okay, so I was about 20 years old and I was staying in a small apartment
[43:13.840 --> 43:18.040]  working and going to so-called community college, it was totally worthless, see I'm digressing
[43:18.040 --> 43:23.080]  I shouldn't even tell that part of the story, I have this tendency to over tell stories
[43:23.080 --> 43:26.120]  and to tell you every little detail, I mean I shouldn't tell you what color the drapes
[43:26.120 --> 43:29.800]  were in my parents' house or where they had the safe in their bedroom or whatever but
[43:29.800 --> 43:38.480]  I tend to digress off, so let me just restart, when I was in college I lived in an apartment
[43:38.480 --> 43:43.040]  so I didn't keep my firearms in my apartment, I kept my parents' house and my parents had
[43:43.040 --> 43:46.600]  a well-known newspaper slash magazine editor, he's worked at both places, there's been
[43:46.600 --> 43:52.160]  a friend of theirs since I was a little kid and so I go through their living room into
[43:52.160 --> 43:59.360]  their bedroom and I come out with a rifle and a.357 magnum in a case, can't even see
[43:59.360 --> 44:05.600]  through the 7 magnum, and I'm walking out to go, dear honey, and he's all the way through
[44:05.600 --> 44:14.480]  the living room in the den slash dining room and he goes, ooh, and I hear this and he goes,
[44:14.480 --> 44:18.280]  is that a gun?
[44:18.280 --> 44:23.920]  And I went yes, he's like scrambling back at his wife, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay,
[44:23.920 --> 44:27.360]  and my dad goes, hey, come on, Alex come in here show him, he's like no, no, no, and he's
[44:27.360 --> 44:31.840]  like listen, relax, you've known Alex all your life, he's a good guy, I'm a doctor,
[44:31.840 --> 44:35.680]  you're a newspaper editor, stop, stop, oh stop, I'm leaving, you're doing this, I'm
[44:35.680 --> 44:39.440]  like walking over the rifle, we're like look, it's not loaded, everything's okay, oh what's
[44:39.440 --> 44:45.040]  in there, I'm gonna leave, I'm gonna leave, my dad's like go if you want to, because he's
[44:45.040 --> 44:50.360]  a big liberal friend of his that he'd known since my mom worked with him in a major newspaper,
[44:50.360 --> 44:57.480]  so these people have been around since I was born, okay, been on camping trips with them,
[44:57.480 --> 45:02.360]  all over the country, I mean I've known them well, and they're a little bit more informed
[45:02.360 --> 45:06.320]  now today, I mean I haven't seen them in probably six, seven years, but it's crazy, but this
[45:06.320 --> 45:12.800]  is the domesticated mindset, so I'm walking out and my dad goes no, come back with a 357,
[45:12.800 --> 45:18.200]  he unzips it in the black case, soft case says look, look, it's not even loaded, see,
[45:18.200 --> 45:21.600]  it's no big deal, a car's more dangerous than this, and he's freaking out, well I'm not
[45:21.600 --> 45:26.320]  sure it's panicking, he's red-faced, but we're leaving, it's fine, hey good seeing you, I
[45:26.320 --> 45:29.920]  leave, they were gonna go out to dinner and stuff that night, he got so freaked out with
[45:29.920 --> 45:35.080]  his wife, he left, and my parents really weren't ever friends with him again, so at that point
[45:35.080 --> 45:42.040]  they'd known him 20 years, I was 20 years old then, now why do I tell you the story,
[45:42.040 --> 45:46.560]  because this is what we're dealing with, Nancy Pelosi is in a new press conference, it doesn't
[45:46.560 --> 45:51.080]  even know where she is, okay, she thinks George W. Bush is president, that was in one a few
[45:51.080 --> 45:57.360]  weeks ago, there's one even worse, Maxine Waters again thinks Russia invaded Korea,
[45:57.360 --> 46:02.920]  the new one she's obviously has dementia, she's out of her mind, giggling like an insane person,
[46:02.920 --> 46:07.640]  this is who is in control of our country, and the reason I raise that is liberals are domesticated
[46:07.640 --> 46:15.240]  people, most of them were abused as children, they're scared, they have no competency, they're
[46:15.240 --> 46:22.160]  not confident, and that's why they're so afraid of veterans and tough guys and competent folks
[46:22.160 --> 46:26.040]  and just hard working class, middle class people, because to them it's scary to see
[46:26.040 --> 46:30.360]  somebody aggressive and competent, I just love being around veterans and special forces
[46:30.360 --> 46:33.720]  people and stuff, because they're funny, they're smart, they get stuff done, they got jokes,
[46:33.720 --> 46:40.400]  they got things to do, they're having a good time, it's the complete opposite of the people
[46:40.400 --> 46:47.040]  that are friends with Juan Williams, and that's where I'm going next with this, very fake news,
[46:47.040 --> 46:58.280]  Juan Williams slaps CNN reporter claiming Sean Hannity pulled gun on him after argument,
[46:58.280 --> 47:04.040]  again very fake news, Juan Williams slams CNN report claiming Sean Hannity pulled a gun
[47:04.040 --> 47:09.640]  on him after an argument, and then Juan Williams after this breaks on CNN everywhere goes,
[47:09.640 --> 47:15.760]  no, he just showed me his gun, and he turned the laser on, and they called that pulling
[47:15.760 --> 47:22.000]  a gun on him, think about that, that's how domesticated they are, that a guy that's
[47:22.000 --> 47:27.000]  had a concealed carry in New York for decades, really hard to get, he's got a concealed carry
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.680]  in five states, Juan is scared of guns, he's trying to decondition him, like I do when
[47:32.680 --> 47:37.880]  I had time taking Hollywood people out with Mike Judge several times and others to get
[47:37.880 --> 47:45.600]  them shooting 223s, M4s, we had all these liberal women wanting guns after they did it,
[47:45.600 --> 47:50.240]  we got them to come into the real world, but two, a program left is saying here, don't
[47:50.240 --> 47:55.200]  be scared, let me show you my Glock, let me show you the laser sight, let me show you
[47:55.200 --> 48:02.520]  it's unloaded, only the state, only Kim Jong Un, only Hitler, only Mao, only Pol Pot can
[48:02.520 --> 48:07.400]  have a gun, in their world that's another caste, another class, it's scary, they see
[48:07.400 --> 48:11.640]  military with guns, cops with guns, it's not as scary, now once they retire they can't
[48:11.640 --> 48:19.560]  have guns in their world view, so Kennedy says again it's total fake news, totally insane,
[48:19.560 --> 48:24.960]  totally made up, and Williams goes no, he just said let me show you my gun in his office
[48:24.960 --> 48:30.160]  so you're not so scared, turned it on and said look it's unloaded, and that's how domesticated
[48:30.160 --> 48:35.840]  these people are, and now it's this big national story everywhere that Sean Hannity pulled
[48:35.840 --> 48:39.920]  a gun and threatened, it goes throw it, didn't just pull a gun, but threatened Juan Williams
[48:39.920 --> 48:46.200]  when literally, I am 40, 50 feet coming out of their bedroom through their house at like
[48:46.200 --> 48:52.440]  two dens, a little den, kitchen, dining room, living room, they're out on the edge of the
[48:52.440 --> 48:58.520]  dining room, in the main living room, I'm like 45 feet, and he sees a rifle and goes
[48:58.520 --> 49:06.440]  oh, I was a mass shooter or something, that's how conditioned they are, now here's a similar
[49:06.440 --> 49:13.240]  gun to what, firearm to what Sean Hannity had, and this is just a little Glock 43, 9mm,
[49:13.240 --> 49:17.880]  this is what I carry, oh and look, for the news I'm not going to show you all the numbers
[49:17.880 --> 49:26.080]  on it, but here's my concealed carry card, see that, Sean Hannity has the same thing,
[49:26.080 --> 49:33.640]  this is what I, now where on my person, everywhere I go, it's legal and lawful, and all he did
[49:33.640 --> 49:38.760]  was, and Juan Williams said yes, it's all exaggerated, all, basically a lie by his liberal colleagues,
[49:38.760 --> 49:51.280]  all he did was, say look, see that, showed him that it wasn't loaded, and said look,
[49:51.280 --> 50:01.320]  it's no big deal, look, there's a laser on it, see that, it's no big deal, and it's
[50:01.320 --> 50:05.560]  so easy, and you can drive tax with these one, you ought to go shoot with me, he literally
[50:05.560 --> 50:09.120]  was trying to be programming, and they don't want that, they want to keep people scared,
[50:09.120 --> 50:14.800]  we've seen all the videos, if I could just do a professional one on it, for the news,
[50:14.800 --> 50:18.480]  where I, when I say a professional one, one where I get all the clips together and really
[50:18.480 --> 50:24.480]  beg my point, where it shows people going out, and being scared to shoot, even low caliber
[50:24.480 --> 50:28.560]  firearms left us going, I won't even touch that, that's so disgusting, oh, it's so evil,
[50:28.560 --> 50:31.880]  oh, it's so dangerous, oh, I'm having a panic attack, this is their attitude, this is how
[50:31.880 --> 50:38.760]  they act, so imagine, you go, hey Juan Williams, you know, it's really no big deal, it's really
[50:38.760 --> 50:44.680]  no big deal, look, there's no bullets, that a laser sight, you hit right what you aim
[50:44.680 --> 50:50.840]  at, it's no big deal, doesn't worry about, just a harmless plastic explosive, Mr. Grover,
[50:50.840 --> 50:56.320]  all right folks, we'll be back, stay with us, this is the N4, we'll cover North Korea
[50:56.320 --> 51:01.320]  straight ahead.
[51:01.320 --> 51:05.200]  Many books have been written regarding the law of attraction, but what if all these books
[51:05.200 --> 51:09.000]  are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this
[51:09.000 --> 51:13.880]  law in our lives, the new book, it's time to align the most powerful self help book
[51:13.880 --> 51:18.600]  ever written by Alan Laudinger takes a look at how the law of attraction really works
[51:18.600 --> 51:23.160]  and how it is being suppressed in our lives, learn how to overcome this manipulation and
[51:23.160 --> 51:27.560]  how to experience alignment with the creative power of the universe, get the new book, it's
[51:27.560 --> 51:56.560]  time to align available at Amazon.com.
[51:56.560 --> 52:04.480]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[52:04.480 --> 52:08.880]  food and boil water, if your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking
[52:08.880 --> 52:13.520]  over an open fire, then there's a much better way, the Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass
[52:13.520 --> 52:18.120]  burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel, the
[52:18.120 --> 52:22.280]  Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable, for the
[52:22.280 --> 52:26.920]  finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to

[54:22.440 --> 54:26.760]  I'm getting to North Korea right now, Rex Tillerson, but first, Allie, who is a great
[54:26.760 --> 54:31.960]  asset and does a great job as a producer and researcher here on the show, she is originally
[54:31.960 --> 54:37.200]  from Mexico here legally, doing a wonderful job, and don't have a lot of chance to be
[54:37.200 --> 54:41.080]  around guns there, it's pretty much illegal for the citizens in Mexico, there's a revolution
[54:41.080 --> 54:44.520]  down there, more and more citizens are demanding guns, and then those areas, crime rates are
[54:44.520 --> 54:47.920]  dropping, just like it happens here in the United States, but during the break she was
[54:47.920 --> 54:52.400]  like, I was exactly the same, totally scared of firearms, just like Juan Williams was until
[54:52.400 --> 54:56.560]  he got shown one by Sean Hannity, then he told colleagues, oh yeah, he showed me one,
[54:56.560 --> 55:02.000]  showed me the red dot, they went, he pulled that on you, why, he pulled that thing on
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.480]  you, you are so absolutely horrible, this is the fake news, and Juan said no, he said
[55:07.480 --> 55:11.480]  let me just show you the gun, don't be scared of it, Nico was just telling me don't point
[55:11.480 --> 55:18.400]  lasers at cameras and their chips, but I can't help it, looks so cool, we'll see how it messes
[55:18.400 --> 55:24.080]  it up, but there you go folks, my legal lawful firearm, and here it is protecting me, and
[55:24.080 --> 55:28.680]  it's of course unloaded as well, but again, I'm a slave, I'm a citizen, I'm not supposed
[55:28.680 --> 55:31.640]  to have this according to the leftist and the globalists, because they want to have
[55:31.640 --> 55:37.760]  the monopoly of power via the state, so Alia, tell us your story.
[55:37.760 --> 55:45.040]  So yeah, like you said in Mexico, we are not used to like having guns in our houses or
[55:45.040 --> 55:50.240]  people carrying guns, the only times we do see them are, you know, during maybe a shootout
[55:50.240 --> 55:55.360]  or something, but it's not that common, so when I was in Savannah, studying college first
[55:55.360 --> 56:00.600]  time, this guy came up to me, and he actually had something underneath his arm, and we were
[56:00.600 --> 56:04.040]  talking for a while, and then finally I was like what do you have there, and he showed
[56:04.040 --> 56:09.120]  it to me, and it was a gun, and I was like taking it back, I was like oh my goodness,
[56:09.120 --> 56:14.120]  what, I don't know what to do at this moment, I've never seen a gun, I've never held one,
[56:14.120 --> 56:18.320]  so he kind of gave it to me, I didn't even know what to do, put it on top of my hand,
[56:18.320 --> 56:19.320]  just nervous.
[56:19.320 --> 56:22.000]  Well I told the story earlier about a major newspaper editor that was in Friends of My
[56:22.000 --> 56:27.520]  Parents as I was born, and he literally saw me in college getting a rifle out of a safe
[56:27.520 --> 56:31.280]  in their bedroom, you know, to go use it, because I kept my guns, I was going to just
[56:31.280 --> 56:34.840]  tune in at their house, I was living with my parents, make sure that's clear, and he
[56:34.840 --> 56:38.880]  saw it, just totally freaked out and panicked, and when my dad tried to reason with him,
[56:38.880 --> 56:40.040]  he just totally panicked.
[56:40.040 --> 56:43.440]  With you, it's reasonable, you'd seen Hollywood movies, weren't aware of it, you were telling
[56:43.440 --> 56:45.880]  me earlier that once you got around guns, what happened?
[56:45.880 --> 56:50.120]  Yes, actually, here in Austin, finally when I started working here in Enforced, and I
[56:50.120 --> 56:54.400]  got a little more information about guns, and started knowing more about guns, I got
[56:54.400 --> 57:01.280]  more comfortable, so finally I went to Shooting Range, tried, I think it was a Ruger, and
[57:01.280 --> 57:07.120]  so fun, I had a blast, I felt so much more confident after that, and I noticed that it's
[57:07.120 --> 57:17.880]  only you, knowing how to handle a gun, knowing the safety features, and then you'll start
[57:17.880 --> 57:20.640]  feeling better, because then about guns, I mean.
[57:20.640 --> 57:25.520]  Exactly, because it's just another appliance, cars kill 10, 20, 30 times what guns do, most
[57:25.520 --> 57:29.400]  guns are used to stop crime, and we're good people, we need to learn how to use them and
[57:29.400 --> 57:33.560]  have them, so that bad people understand we're not soft targets, and Ali, I kind of made
[57:33.560 --> 57:35.520]  Ali go on there, she's a little nervous, great job, Ali.
[57:35.520 --> 57:36.520]  Thank you.
[57:36.520 --> 57:39.480]  Awesome, it was a great job with our research and guest.
[57:39.480 --> 57:42.240]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back and get to the Rex Hillison
[57:42.240 --> 57:45.440]  thing, I'm not holding off on it, I just really want to break this down and talk about it,
[57:45.440 --> 57:50.840]  the situation North Korea is unprecedented with North Korea threatening to nuke an attack,
[57:50.840 --> 57:54.400]  where again, only the state has the guns and the nukes, and is threatening their peaceful
[57:54.400 --> 58:00.400]  neighbors, and the US military and the secretariat state are saying, the president says, loves
[58:00.400 --> 58:04.720]  her off, we may first strike you for threatening nuclear weapons, we can't wait, let you load
[58:04.720 --> 58:08.040]  one of those on a missile, we may have to go ahead and hit you, and then if China comes
[58:08.040 --> 58:12.640]  in on the side, we have another conventional war, like we saw in the Korean War that was
[58:12.640 --> 58:17.920]  never stopped, wasn't even armistice, it was a ceasefire, we guys put me the Wikipedia
[58:17.920 --> 58:23.200]  on the ceasefire in the history, it gets a little foggy on the exact date of that, but
[58:23.200 --> 58:26.960]  I know we lost a lot of Americans obviously in that situation, standing up against the
[58:26.960 --> 58:30.840]  communist thugs, but they were already on the march before Trump got in, they are just
[58:30.840 --> 58:34.800]  really flexing their muscles all over the South China Sea, Africa you name it, the communist
[58:34.800 --> 58:39.360]  Chinese are on the march, I'm Alex Jones, hour number two coming up, don't forget 30%

[1:00:13.920 --> 1:00:21.800]  wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones, remember the CIA whistleblower that came out last week
[1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:30.800]  on RT and said oh he talked to his colleagues, he's a former section chief over analysis
[1:00:30.800 --> 1:00:35.480]  and he talked to his colleagues and they said oh we were ordered to target Trump during
[1:00:35.480 --> 1:00:38.880]  and after the election and he says of course the president is under surveillance but that's
[1:00:38.880 --> 1:00:44.320]  well known, they censored that on Facebook, wouldn't let us post it, deleted it when we
[1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:51.960]  did post it, calling it spam and fake news and then Gizmodo this week celebrated it
[1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:59.360]  and said that's right, it's fake, that's right, major international TV with a decorated high
[1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:07.160]  level CIA officer who then went on to be high level state department, comes on TV via Skype
[1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:10.920]  and tells what anybody that studied this stuff already knows but he has a lot of credibility
[1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:16.000]  and they just go that's insane, by the way you can't show that to anybody, Alex that's
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:22.200]  more spam, it's more spam, so he's going to be joining us, I need to get Quentin Carter
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:26.280]  in here because we've got some new developments that it's been in for a week and I haven't
[1:01:26.280 --> 1:01:31.440]  announced it yet because we're so busy covering the news that you never get to really exciting
[1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:35.480]  things that are happening here at info wars, so we've got Quentin to pop in at the bottom
[1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:39.560]  of the hour and then I tend to also open the phones up and take your calls, I already
[1:01:39.560 --> 1:01:44.040]  got into this some but I want to hit it next segment so we have enough time to really roll
[1:01:44.040 --> 1:01:48.080]  that's what's happening in North Korea, Tillerson doesn't rule out preemptive strike on North
[1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:52.440]  Korea and I want to walk through the scenario and the different scenarios that could take
[1:01:52.440 --> 1:01:57.520]  place there preemptive military action is North Korea on the table, so before we go
[1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:04.120]  any further with that huge news, we also have Lee Ann McAdoo and Owen Schreuer hosting the
[1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:10.480]  fourth hour today, before I go any further, it just shows culturally how domesticated
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:15.520]  the media is that Juan Williams told some liberal colleagues at CNN, he works at Fox,
[1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:21.720]  formerly NPR, Sean Hannity pulled out a gun in his office and showed it to me and showed
[1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:25.200]  me the laser and pointed it around and they turned that into he pulled a gun on him and
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:30.360]  threatened it and I already mentioned this a couple of times but this is just insane
[1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:34.480]  and it just shows the next level of the disconnect so again last hour if you missed it you should
[1:02:34.480 --> 1:02:39.440]  go back to the archive, I broke down a story of where my dad had a friend of the family
[1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:43.200]  over who was a liberal and never been around guns and just freaked out when he saw me come
[1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:48.680]  over to my parents house to get one of my firearms out to take it hunting but again
[1:02:48.680 --> 1:02:55.720]  it just boggles the mind that Sean Hannity had an unloaded firearm with a license showed
[1:02:55.720 --> 1:03:00.720]  it to him and it turned into another giant fake news line, very fake news, Juan Williams
[1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:07.440]  slam CNN report claiming Sean Hannity pulled a gun close quote on him after an argument
[1:03:07.440 --> 1:03:16.040]  and the real story was they were talking about guns and arguing about it and he said and
[1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:19.080]  Hannity came out and broke this down and won so that's what happened and showed him
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:23.640]  how it was unloaded, it was no big deal and now why couldn't a citizen have it, he was
[1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:28.360]  trying to sell one on going shooting with him and I've done this so much you want to
[1:03:28.360 --> 1:03:33.160]  win the culture war, can't help it it's so much fun to shoot these cameras I know it's
[1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:36.360]  not good for the chips but I can't help it, if we're going to win the culture war we've
[1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:41.800]  got to do this, okay I'm going to stop right now ladies and gentlemen, when we come back
[1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:50.800]  I will discipline myself and I will get into all of that news for you but separately I
[1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:55.280]  barely plugged last hour the products we need to find our operation they're great products
[1:03:55.280 --> 1:03:59.600]  if you don't use X2, if you don't use supermail or superfilm or vitality, if you don't do

[1:09:16.120 --> 1:09:18.120]  we are in a launch mode
[1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:22.120]  do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation

[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:32.120]  we have a soviet submarine launch detection
[1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:34.120]  i wish i didn't know about any of this
[1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:36.120]  i wish i was like everybody else
[1:09:36.120 --> 1:09:38.120]  change them
[1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:44.120]  the only winning goal is not to play
[1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:54.120]  ladies and gentlemen every major military historical analyst out there agrees the last four years
[1:09:54.120 --> 1:10:00.120]  that the world has entered the most dangerous period in human existence
[1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:03.120]  we have the Atlantean power
[1:10:03.120 --> 1:10:06.120]  whether the legend of Atlantis was true or not
[1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:12.120]  we have the Atlantean power now to destroy ourselves many times over
[1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:16.120]  that is an incontrovertible fact
[1:10:16.120 --> 1:10:21.120]  and we have communist china that is unbelievably oppressive
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:27.120]  and unbelievably murderous
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:33.120]  arming north korea with medium range and long range intercontinental ballistic missiles
[1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:37.120]  and we have bill clinton and hillary clinton
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:48.120]  and laurel and hughes in 1995, 96 and 97 illegally transferring the technology to communist china
[1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:52.120]  previously china would have to come up off our shore
[1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:58.120]  and try to fire some type of primitive medium range nuke at us
[1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:04.120]  or try to get bombers flying over the north pole to hit say new york city good luck doing that
[1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:09.120]  but now they have it
[1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:12.120]  and they've put their operatives in all the major tech companies
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:20.120]  and they have got chips that are manufactured with military that have kill switches in our
[1:11:20.120 --> 1:11:25.120]  latest military equipment we have been completely sabotaged and overrun
[1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:28.120]  and by the way all that's admitted
[1:11:28.120 --> 1:11:32.120]  what's crazy is that sounds wild it's true
[1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:34.120]  there have been scandals for 15 years
[1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:36.120]  i remember seeing in the news
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:42.120]  hundreds of times where they find backdoors in defense chips made in communist china
[1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:48.120]  or they get communist chinese technicians in even our firms and they add stuff in
[1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:51.120]  search engine that
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:55.120]  communist china put backdoors on us defense chips
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:12:01.120]  remember they call me fake news because we've got such a memory and we're accurate
[1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:04.120]  of course how would you not forget that i mean that's important
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:07.120]  or the kim jong-un's third generation dictator so now
[1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:12.120]  in the last month he's had more missile tests firing missiles just right off the coast of japan
[1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:16.120]  and then saying i will annihilate you i will nuke you
[1:12:16.120 --> 1:12:21.120]  with someone that looks like a cartoon character of a little potbellied crazy man
[1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:26.120]  with everyone worshipping him threatening to destroy south korea
[1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:30.120]  one of the most advanced high tech countries in the world
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:33.120]  with different planets
[1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:39.120]  millions starving every few years in north korea total enslavement
[1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:42.120]  collapsing worse than venezuela
[1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:46.120]  and the answer is threatened to nuke us threatened to attack us
[1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:51.120]  and now china has moved into the south china sea taking over 90% of it
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:57.120]  they are declaring
[1:12:57.120 --> 1:13:03.120]  that they have the waters all the way down to the philippines
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:05.120]  think about that
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:10.120]  and china is belligerently kicking philippinos off their own islands
[1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:17.120]  that people have been on for thousands of years they're not just building new ones
[1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:22.120]  in fact there's one good thing cnn did we've played that graphic where the lady is standing on the big
[1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:28.120]  and it shows the official china map it's over 90% and it's hundreds of miles away from china
[1:13:28.120 --> 1:13:33.120]  in areas they've never even claimed folks shooting way out in the south china sea
[1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:38.120]  the most busy area in the world and now they're using north korean dictator kim jong un
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:45.120]  who never worked a day in his life to declare that he
[1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:51.120]  will annihilate south korea annihilate japan annihilate anybody that gets in his way
[1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:59.120]  and nancy polosi is so arrogant
[1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:02.120]  she doesn't know who the president is in press conferences
[1:14:02.120 --> 1:14:08.120]  and maxi waters again thinks that russia invaded korea doesn't know what north and south is
[1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:13.120]  has no idea what's even going on on this planet
[1:14:13.120 --> 1:14:17.120]  no connection to reality
[1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:27.120]  she just says that putin runs trump and now don't forget john mccain said two days ago that
[1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:32.120]  rand paul is use a agent of putin
[1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:37.120]  oh and that's a correction i saw the article i played the clip yesterday
[1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:42.120]  and i conflated two things not intentionally because it's the exact same rhetoric
[1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:46.120]  mccain has a bunch of trees he wants ram through to have the u.s. totally invade
[1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:50.120]  ukraine all the way into kramya and kick rush out military force
[1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:55.120]  and he wants more heavy weapons sent any aircraft missiles you name it there's already a proxy war
[1:14:55.120 --> 1:15:01.120]  so then he's up there about another treaty and that's montanegro where he says russia's
[1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:07.120]  attack where there's no evidence of that just zero there and it's saying he wants u.s. forces there
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:11.120]  that's in the Balkans but but also nearby this is an encirclement of russia which is
[1:15:11.120 --> 1:15:15.120]  seriously warlike and russia's not threatening to nuke anybody russia's not grabbing the south china sea
[1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:19.120]  if russia was grabbing the south china sea and by the way they have some claim to it
[1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:23.120]  there's some russia that sticks out in that area and russia has some islands around there
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:30.120]  going back and russia goes all the way to asia folks far east asia but they're not claiming that
[1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:35.120]  people ask putin about hey would you want you know areas of alaska back that you sold
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:39.120]  for 50 million or whatever it was he says no we got too much land to deal with now
[1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:46.120]  is it russia like eight times the size of the u.s. i'm going from memory russia's problem is
[1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:52.120]  it's so big yeah let's pull back on that look at the size of that the globalist want it
[1:15:52.120 --> 1:15:57.120]  they're trying to use islamicist on one side of the trend he's on the other to bring it down
[1:15:57.120 --> 1:16:03.120]  don't lionize on some love affair with russia i have to know what's going on historically
[1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:09.120]  i have to know that our own stinking globalist government in 1917 financed the takedown of
[1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:13.120]  Moscow and the bolshevik revolution and then the same leftist thing we see here today was
[1:16:13.120 --> 1:16:17.120]  done to them you want to know where we're going look at what happened in russia banning the
[1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:22.120]  family slave labor hate speech laws everything you see now little commas are running around
[1:16:22.120 --> 1:16:28.120]  in black uniforms
[1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:34.120]  so if russia was suddenly declaring it wanted a bunch of islands out there because they border
[1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:40.120]  that area i'd say hey watch out russia that's open sea lanes for everybody you know china's
[1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:46.120]  saying you can't come in most of south china sea now and ships have to go through areas
[1:16:46.120 --> 1:16:52.120]  that are rocky shoals and sandbars and and so a lot of big ships are just ignoring them
[1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:56.120]  and having to be escorted by japanese u.s. and south korean ships that's really what's
[1:16:56.120 --> 1:17:01.120]  been going on the last year and the communist chinese will pull up they'll board your boat
[1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:07.120]  they'll steal the navy's research vessels remember that they're acting like north korea and because
[1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:12.120]  they're delusional hell they're buying up hollywood they're controlling the u.s. they're putting
[1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:19.120]  spy chips in our equipment they're doing whatever they want and then rex callison comes out and
[1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:23.120]  says listen we don't want war but you just can't keep calling for it and you've got atomic
[1:17:23.120 --> 1:17:27.120]  weapons and missiles to deliver them and we see movements towards that we're going to hit
[1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:31.120]  you first and they've got the special forces on the border they've got the bombers ready
[1:17:31.120 --> 1:17:36.120]  they've got the cruise missiles ready to vaporize every major military emplacement it's going
[1:17:36.120 --> 1:17:44.120]  to be i'd say they're going to hit the north korean line yeah let me from a military history
[1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:49.120]  tell you how this will go if it kicks off and go three different ways and they're each
[1:17:49.120 --> 1:17:56.120]  really drawn out so let me just try to crystallize them as best i can they start loading what
[1:17:56.120 --> 1:18:01.120]  appears to be an atomic payload they've got sensors in space that can scan and tell them
[1:18:01.120 --> 1:18:09.120]  they start loading a radioactive payload onto one of those missiles and the phone calls
[1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:13.120]  going to go to president trump who's got the media and everybody attacking him constantly
[1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:17.120]  about you know he wasn't spied on or all this made up crap or you know he's not getting the
[1:18:17.120 --> 1:18:21.120]  economy going all these other lies or whatever he didn't release his tax returns while we're
[1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:26.120]  busy dealing with that and our sellout globalist left us that have sold us out to kindness
[1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:30.120]  china and think they're going to defeat this country trump can get the call today tomorrow
[1:18:30.120 --> 1:18:38.120]  next month whenever skip this break is too important and they could say mr. president
[1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:45.120]  we've got the scans they're loading they're going to go nuclear six missiles six medium
[1:18:45.120 --> 1:18:52.120]  range rockets with atomic payloads they probably have hydrogen bombs now maybe it's a maybe
[1:18:52.120 --> 1:19:03.120]  it's a hydrogen bomb and president makes the decision they've already had the meetings
[1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:10.120]  and all right go ahead and launch and then it'll be five minutes till the cruise missiles
[1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:15.120]  hit them and it'll be about fifteen minutes till secondary hydrogen bombs get dropped on
[1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:21.120]  them and they're going to hit the entire line between south and north korea where they've
[1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:25.120]  got those hundred thousand artillery pieces and where they've got their troops because
[1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:31.120]  the word is north korea's only got about ten nukes and so the entire front of north korea
[1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:38.120]  is going to probably get hit with depending on the size of the bombs or nuclear weapons
[1:19:38.120 --> 1:19:44.120]  they use it could be hundreds of nuclear weapons will be used small nuclear weapons to wipe
[1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:48.120]  out the tunnels the bases to neutralize them and then if troops pour across they're going
[1:19:48.120 --> 1:19:52.120]  to hit them with larger weapons that's how it escalates and then they'll start dropping
[1:19:52.120 --> 1:19:58.120]  the five hundred megaton bombs on it'll destroy the whole country and so right now there's
[1:19:58.120 --> 1:20:03.120]  over a thousand nuclear weapons just on a group of ships pointed at north korea of course
[1:20:03.120 --> 1:20:08.120]  you know where the rest are really pointed right now most of the missiles aren't aimed
[1:20:08.120 --> 1:20:13.120]  at Russia they've been swung around for years and they're aimed right at china that's the
[1:20:13.120 --> 1:20:18.120]  pivot they're aimed right at china right now space space weapons you name it and I'm not
[1:20:18.120 --> 1:20:23.120]  saying any secrets here I've reverse engineered it plus I have all the sources over the years
[1:20:23.120 --> 1:20:34.120]  1879 they had over 100 drones continually orbiting the earth with d u sabo rounds or basically
[1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:39.120]  meteor guns now they're not atomic they're not nuclear they're not hydrogen bombs or atomic
[1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:49.120]  bombs they are sabos of a classified nature that go into orbit at 15,000 miles an hour
[1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:55.120]  with a rocket booster and accelerates up to 40,000 miles an hour when they hit their target
[1:20:55.120 --> 1:21:01.120]  you can be 10 miles under a mountain you're dead no holes deep enough and again you got
[1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:06.120]  to be under a mountain because that's cool you go a mile under at sea level it's 150 degrees
[1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:12.120]  so you're under a mountain you're not safe nobody's safe and that was 1979 that's the
[1:21:12.120 --> 1:21:15.120]  superiority of the United States ladies and gentlemen and that's what they've got and they've
[1:21:15.120 --> 1:21:20.120]  got advanced stuff up there huge weapons platforms Japanese amateur astronomers are always showing
[1:21:20.120 --> 1:21:24.120]  them they're just basically big floating bases not like those tinker toys they put up international
[1:21:24.120 --> 1:21:31.120]  space station they've got military bases that are basically big big platforms with particle
[1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:40.120]  beams light pebble tiny pebble projectors that also basically shoot hundreds of thousands
[1:21:40.120 --> 1:21:45.120]  of BBs every few seconds out because in space they don't slow down at missiles when they're
[1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:49.120]  coming up so they got these BB guns up there that's what they are they're BB guns basically
[1:21:49.120 --> 1:21:56.120]  and they're just just imagine hundreds of BB guns aiming at the missiles that are going
[1:21:56.120 --> 1:22:01.120]  to come out of Russia come out of China and so they're going to take those out they're
[1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:05.120]  going to fire cruise missiles in and of course here's the news flash I'm just going to go
[1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:11.120]  and tell you because I know history and I've studied it if North Korea moves China has already
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:15.120]  been given the call that if you move anything or anything looks like it's warming up on a pad
[1:22:15.120 --> 1:22:22.120]  or any submarines pop up in the Pacific Ocean in the Gulf of Mexico or in the Atlantic Ocean
[1:22:22.120 --> 1:22:25.120]  we're going to have total commitment at that point space-based weapons are going to kill
[1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:31.120]  your entire city centers population because they're not going to play games in China they're
[1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:36.120]  going to kill everybody so just understand that China the communist leaders made jokes
[1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:39.120]  about how we have too many people go ahead and hit us you're going to get hit like you
[1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:45.120]  want every military target every city every factory you're going to have 10,000 weapons
[1:22:45.120 --> 1:22:49.120]  dropped on you and by the way it's going to be a nuclear winter but I mean look leftist
[1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:53.120]  want to worship China they want to worship North Korea they want to worship Venezuela
[1:22:53.120 --> 1:23:00.120]  they want nuclear war they're going to get it because here's why we're not going to sit
[1:23:00.120 --> 1:23:04.120]  here while you launch missiles first and you catch us with your pants down because you're
[1:23:04.120 --> 1:23:10.120]  a bunch of crazy commies understand that Curtis LeMay wanted to hit China and Russia a long
[1:23:10.120 --> 1:23:14.120]  time ago and got vetoed on it and people like Bertrand Russell is the big liberals calling
[1:23:14.120 --> 1:23:18.120]  for it one in one world government those plans got killed because they were immoral we're dealing
[1:23:18.120 --> 1:23:22.120]  with people that are running around taking over land threatening to attack us and saying
[1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:26.120]  they're going to nuke us and China's behind it because they're a bunch of belligerent crazy
[1:23:26.120 --> 1:23:36.120]  commies now that's one way it can go North Korea could basically who's under Chinese control
[1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:43.120]  could actually fold and announce a deal to work with the South like East Germany did
[1:23:43.120 --> 1:23:48.120]  to merge with it and that horrible family dynasty can be removed and those entire sickening groups
[1:23:48.120 --> 1:23:52.120]  of oppressive generals could all be told they can leave to abstinence it wherever they like
[1:23:52.120 --> 1:23:56.120]  and take their skull and loot so there's not to be a nuclear war just let them leave and
[1:23:56.120 --> 1:24:01.120]  then send in international aid and stabilize the country of those poor victims China can
[1:24:01.120 --> 1:24:09.120]  back off now and China can recuse itself from what it's been doing and understand that you
[1:24:09.120 --> 1:24:12.120]  might be able to fight over the South China Sea you're not going to get to start a nuclear
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:19.120]  war and not get hit first so the United States is massively more advanced than China and
[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:24.120]  China needs to understand that traders inside our government gave you nicks and that shows
[1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:28.120]  how crazy this whole thing is and I know that China's been testing anti-satellite weapons
[1:24:28.120 --> 1:24:32.120]  and particle beams and missiles and they've already blown up some of our satellites so I
[1:24:32.120 --> 1:24:35.120]  understand China's got some of its own weapons and they got some smart people it's just
[1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:41.120]  understand this that China has no idea what's going to get rolled out against you or how huge
[1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:47.120]  the secret space program is and all the stuff that's been going on for a long time so just
[1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:52.120]  look the United States and Europe basically invented everything and everybody over there
[1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:55.120]  needs to understand globalist may have captured Europe they may have made a deal with China
[1:24:55.120 --> 1:25:02.120]  to try to capture the United States that deals broken that deals over look at Kim Jong-un
[1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:08.120]  in that photo the arrogance the fake confidence what is it about WIMPs that sit there and act
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:13.120]  like and look at the brainwashed slaves behind him who think he's God they literally think
[1:25:13.120 --> 1:25:17.120]  he's a rock star it's like folks think movie stars are cool just because they're in movies
[1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:21.120]  and he loves money's music that's great but you know just this worship for no reason look
[1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:26.120]  at the cult like crying like Democrats when they found out Hillary lost just look at how
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:33.120]  they worshiped Hillary another slug this is slavery this is pathetic this is mindlessness
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:41.120]  you don't find any birds any lizards anything in North Korea everything's been eaten this
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:48.120]  is the worship of the state this is what we've become well Merkel's finally showed up the
[1:25:48.120 --> 1:25:52.120]  press conference is about to happen Merkel goes to Washington no handshake with Trump
[1:25:52.120 --> 1:25:58.120]  they were in there covering it getting ready for it I said it's take 1220 Eastern I guess
[1:25:58.120 --> 1:26:03.120]  that'd be 1120 but now it's I don't know that ever happened look at drudgerport.com it's also
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:07.120]  up on infowars.com but let's get back to the really important news here that's just the
[1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:12.120]  German trader that opened them up to the whole UN plan to colonize Europe with Muslims and
[1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:16.120]  now Turkey says we're in a holy war we have a group that will burn down everything inside
[1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:20.120]  your cities if you don't submit and Merkel's literally saying yes submit to Turkey see she's
[1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:29.120]  allied with the Muslims folks what a pathetic scumbag but right now let's go ahead and go
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:37.120]  to the Secretary of State here he is in the face of North Korea's grave and escalating global threat it
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:44.120]  is important for me to consult with our friends and chart a path that secures the peace let me be
[1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:52.120]  very clear the policy of strategic patience has ended we're exploring a new range of diplomatic
[1:26:52.120 --> 1:27:00.120]  security and economic measures all options are on the table North Korea must understand that the
[1:27:00.120 --> 1:27:06.120]  only path to a secure economically prosperous future is to abandon its development of nuclear
[1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:12.120]  weapons ballistic missiles and other weapons of mass destruction now let's let's go a little bit
[1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:18.120]  further here though so we can have North Korea try to launch missiles or load them with weapons
[1:27:18.120 --> 1:27:21.120]  and we have to hit them they're saying we're going to kill you we're going to attack you I'm
[1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:24.120]  going to load this gun and point it at you and kill you you start loading the gun and pointing it
[1:27:24.120 --> 1:27:28.120]  at me I have to strike back right because you're you're you're striking me first you've announced
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:31.120]  you're doing it you've said you're coming to burn down my house I see you pulling up with
[1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:38.120]  torches in your hand you crossed my threshold under common law I can shoot you understand so
[1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:43.120]  you've shown yourself to be monsters you've done this China horrible communist monsters
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:51.120]  enslaving their people very very sad situation and now they want the South's kind of sea and
[1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:54.120]  they want Africa and they want everything else the deals they made with the globalist are all
[1:27:54.120 --> 1:27:57.120]  being broken that's one reason globalism is broken because none of the parties involved
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:02.120]  followed it Europe ignored the deals with Russia we ignored those deals the Chinese broke their
[1:28:02.120 --> 1:28:09.120]  deals with us I mean Russia really didn't break their deals until the last five six years when
[1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:13.120]  the West started breaking deals they had with them I'm not even again praising Russia I don't
[1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:19.120]  have any stake in Russia other than I don't have nuclear war with Russia I'd like to visit Russia
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:23.120]  someday I'd like to visit Africa I haven't been to either place I've been to Europe it's awesome
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:28.120]  been to Central America it's awesome into Mexico been to Canada I just you know I don't want to
[1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:33.120]  have nuclear war I mean call me a Russian agent like McCain says but the other thing is
[1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:39.120]  Korea and their dictator could decide to just transfer power but they can't do it they could
[1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:43.120]  step down or China could get them in line and have them stop making the threats and doing
[1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:50.120]  all this but it's coming to a head because China wants to use North Korea as a set piece to
[1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:56.120]  somehow bully us into submission and it's not working with Donald Trump just like it's not
[1:28:56.120 --> 1:29:06.120]  working with Vladimir Putin who they keep trying to bully into submission not happening
[1:29:06.120 --> 1:29:11.120]  the global is trying to bully Russia into giving up sovereignty not happening United States not
[1:29:11.120 --> 1:29:16.120]  happening because we have President Trump oh here it is a press conference ongoing
[1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:20.120]  Trump doesn't shake hands with Merkel during photo op look at ready to have their press
[1:29:20.120 --> 1:29:25.120]  conference that's up on drudgereport.com and infowars.com as well as our backup site
[1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:29.120]  presidentplanet.com President Trump did not extend his hand to shake German Chancellor
[1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:33.120]  Merkel's Friday Oval Office photo op a courtesy usually extends to foreign leaders
[1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:39.120]  there's no one else well she is literally an Islamist agent so I mean he really shouldn't
[1:29:39.120 --> 1:29:44.120]  do that right we'll be back on the other side we'll open up the phones into a ton of other
[1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:49.120]  news I haven't hit yet but this North Korea South China Sea China situation is the big issue
[1:29:49.120 --> 1:29:57.120]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:07.120]  you've heard of lab grown beef and a petri dish you've heard of chick oids that are kept
[1:30:07.120 --> 1:30:12.120]  secure force fed and have their beaks removed well now get ready for finger licking lab grown
[1:30:12.120 --> 1:30:17.120]  chicken that's right Memphis meats is one of a cadre of startups racing to create meat
[1:30:17.120 --> 1:30:22.120]  that doesn't involve killing animals the firm's approach to what it calls clean meat is to
[1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:26.120]  culture animal cells in a lab feed them nutrients until they grow into pieces large enough to
[1:30:26.120 --> 1:30:30.120]  cook and eat you've probably seen where companies like this have grown beef in petri dishes
[1:30:30.120 --> 1:30:34.120]  well now it's going to be chicken strips and I know the question on everybody's mind is
[1:30:34.120 --> 1:30:38.120]  does the lab grown chicken taste like chicken according to the Wall Street Journal it was
[1:30:38.120 --> 1:30:43.120]  reported spongier than a whole chicken breast but they nearly nailed the flavor of the
[1:30:43.120 --> 1:30:48.120]  traditional variety this is all part of the globalist plan to remove you from the natural
[1:30:48.120 --> 1:30:53.120]  world and place you into an artificially created VR induced world where they control

[1:35:00.120 --> 1:35:08.120]  agent or photos of your kids but oh the top secret one leave it in the car well I'm sure
[1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:16.120]  it's a she's a good female agent though wonder who she voted for I'm just just just ask questions
[1:35:16.120 --> 1:35:20.120]  I'm probably a wonderful person who is in dereliction of duty or maybe she didn't leave
[1:35:20.120 --> 1:35:26.120]  it in the car maybe she was in the car I'm confused the agent also told investigators
[1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:30.120]  that while nothing about the White House or foreign leaders is stored on the laptop the
[1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:33.120]  information on there could compromise national security reported that there really is the
[1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:37.120]  thief also took sensitive documents in the agent's access card oh to the level of the
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:41.120]  agent's access was immediately clear a police officer involves that the investigation was
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:46.120]  a very big deal to the Secret Service while the president hasn't been back to trump tower
[1:35:46.120 --> 1:35:52.120]  since his inauguration Melania and baron who bow bow says he wants to kidnap and put into
[1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:57.120]  court are still living there until he finishes school this year reported TMZ earlier in the
[1:35:57.120 --> 1:36:01.120]  week with the MIT admitted there was setting up new security detail with cherry picked
[1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:06.120]  officers after spending months struggling to guard the tower adequately yeah and the VA
[1:36:06.120 --> 1:36:12.120]  won't even hire hang his picture up as the economy roars back as he gives massive amounts
[1:36:12.120 --> 1:36:18.120]  of money to intercity groups for actual college and jobs and factories and 300 plus billion
[1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:27.120]  dollars announced everything from Hasbro to Samsung to Chrysler to Fiat to Ford to carrier
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:33.120]  to soft bank to I mean I just going for hours here three plus trillion in the stock market
[1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:37.120]  Federal Reserve being ordered to move massive loans to small businesses just flood them
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:45.120]  with money no he needs to be killed according to them yes he's so horrible I worry about
[1:36:45.120 --> 1:36:48.120]  Trump so much it was almost like good when he did something wrong like oh he's not perfect
[1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:54.120]  I won't feel as bad if something happens because he was halfway supporting the Paul Ryan plan
[1:36:54.120 --> 1:36:58.120]  which he is now falling apart and Rand Paul's is going to the top that's great I mean it's
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:04.120]  just crazy how good he is and then to see the lies it hurts me and I'm not actually glad
[1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:08.120]  you know he's done some things that aren't perfect it's just like almost you're expecting
[1:37:08.120 --> 1:37:17.120]  something bad you're expecting like him to compromise or something he just doesn't do it
[1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:21.120]  and then doesn't shake Merkel's hand that's even better I want to play a few minutes just
[1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:27.120]  from the start of their so-called press conference more of a sit down talk that a Merkel is just
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:35.120]  such a monster absolute monster so again there's an ongoing a talk going on we've backed it
[1:37:35.120 --> 1:37:39.120]  up to the start of where Trump was speaking and then I'm going to come back and hit the
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:45.120]  other really big news that ties into all of this they're openly announcing in Europe and
[1:37:45.120 --> 1:37:50.120]  the US now that not just government but Google will ban you or arrest you if you criticize
[1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:56.120]  Muslims in any way they are God no more First Amendment and I know for a fact in the Justice
[1:37:56.120 --> 1:38:00.120]  Department they're trying to cook up lawsuits told you about this months ago against the
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:05.120]  independent press try to shut that down and ban everything is fake news and then just get
[1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:09.120]  big telecoms to capitulate like Europe just banning things wholesale because what they're
[1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:15.120]  doing is so outrageous Merkel's brought almost three million people 80% of military
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:19.120]  men most of them with fake passports in from failed states and they're just raping murdering
[1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:24.120]  crapping in the pool just running around just it's insane asylum level and if a German
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:30.120]  colonizers that they're arrested total insane asylum here's some of the ongoing talk they're
[1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:38.120]  having people chancellor thank you very much such a great honor to get to know you to be
[1:38:38.120 --> 1:38:45.120]  with you I want to thank all of the business leaders who have joined us to discuss a subject
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:53.120]  that's very important to me training our workforce for the 21st century especially with respect
[1:38:53.120 --> 1:38:59.120]  to manufacturing jobs we're working every day to bring back jobs to our country and thousands
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:03.120]  and thousands are already coming back you're seeing it you're reading about in the papers
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:08.120]  every single day we want to make sure that we have the workforce hundreds of thousands
[1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:14.120]  of jobs we need to ensure these jobs are being filled by American workers Germany the United
[1:39:14.120 --> 1:39:20.120]  States have incredible opportunity to deepen our partnership as we continue to develop
[1:39:20.120 --> 1:39:27.120]  a strong workforce in both of our countries both Germany the United States are pioneering
[1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:33.120]  job training programs here in the United States companies have created revolutionary high-tech
[1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:40.120]  and online courses and of course for decades Germany has been a model for highly successful
[1:39:40.120 --> 1:39:46.120]  apprenticeship let's come back a little bit and see what old murky says whenever he's done
[1:39:46.120 --> 1:39:50.120]  talking but just Trump always trying to get jobs always trying to promote things always
[1:39:50.120 --> 1:39:55.120]  trying to just cut out the big banks and the big brokerage firms and monopolies that try
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:39:58.120]  to choose the winners he's like hey you big banks you get rich in fact they're getting
[1:39:58.120 --> 1:40:02.120]  even richer under his prosperity they're still trying to destroy him because they don't want
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:06.120]  that they want to dictate total control and I know you know that but we've got to get
[1:40:06.120 --> 1:40:11.120]  that word out to these dumb down people sure enough it's all over the web in comments I
[1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:17.120]  showed a few yesterday the day before they're just all over the news in newspaper comment
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:22.120]  sections going why does Alex Jones think blacks aren't humans why does Alex Jones think that
[1:40:22.120 --> 1:40:28.120]  whites are superior because Alec Baldwin to more than 10 million viewers that's what the
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:36.120]  ratings are out that's a big audience told a bunch of suggestible dumb people that I told
[1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:41.120]  Donald Trump that blacks aren't human that was Alec Baldwin that was not the president and
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:45.120]  I did not say that and I know our audience goes yeah tell us something we don't know Alex is
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:52.120]  that a joke no people believe it that's why I'm angry at Alec Baldwin I wouldn't read
[1:40:52.120 --> 1:41:02.120]  something like that I wouldn't get up on air if they paid me all that money and say lies
[1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:09.120]  about Alec Baldwin I would not say you know Alec Baldwin is a serial rapist if it wasn't
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:14.120]  true hey Alex this is Nico popping in on air we were just given a clip by Kit with a New
[1:41:14.120 --> 1:41:20.120]  York Times writer insinuating that we are the progenitors of the wiretapping story and
[1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:28.120]  that Trump picked it up from us whoa whoa we have the New York Times January 20th on
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:33.120]  inauguration when they said wiretap in the headline and that's where Trump got that from
[1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:40.120]  plus it's admitted wow next level I just they bragged during the they bragged when he was
[1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:44.120]  president-elect that they were surveilling him yeah flashback New York Times admits wiretaps
[1:41:44.120 --> 1:41:49.120]  used against Trump but on Salazar has screenshots I would scroll down yeah yeah let's put that
[1:41:49.120 --> 1:41:54.120]  full screen for folks in in HD for TV viewers radio listeners there is wiretap data use an
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:59.120]  inquiry of Trump AIDS and then they use these games and go well you know he's told GSGQ in
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:05.120]  England is where the main hubs go through for the US and England so we always use foreigners
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:09.120]  to tap Americans and then we tap the foreigners then we share the data that's how we get around
[1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:14.120]  the so-called law of spying on our own people that was in Congress 10 years ago I told you
[1:42:14.120 --> 1:42:19.120]  20 years ago not just what I thought was going on boy I'd be king of the world if I could
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:25.120]  magically know they admit it they accidentally leaked in the 90s during a debate on C-span
[1:42:25.120 --> 1:42:31.120]  about the smart pebble and a bunch of other terms for the super high powered small uranium
[1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:37.120]  rounds that they fire out like a machine gun at missiles you know they're coming up into
[1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:42.120]  space and then preparing to go go go back into the atmosphere and hit their target well you
[1:42:42.120 --> 1:42:46.120]  just sit there with those and they don't slow down in the atmosphere they just accelerate
[1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:52.120]  out and then take out their target you fire a large one it doesn't lose any of its force
[1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:59.120]  and can you know cut through miles of rock but small ones cut through missiles and warheads
[1:42:59.120 --> 1:43:04.120]  again that wasn't my opinion that's a fact because that got leaked and I talked to the
[1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:08.120]  former head of Star Wars about a Dr. Bob um before he died obviously but now I'm told
[1:43:08.120 --> 1:43:14.120]  I guess it's on you know the New York Times and everywhere else that we are to blame
[1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:21.120]  and that he gets it from us and again they act like we're the most discredited thing in
[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:25.120]  the world they lie about what we say and do then they connect it to Trump to try to hurt him
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:30.120]  and that's why we're now the number one target drudge had always been the number one target
[1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:34.120]  of them wanting to try to shut him down with the federal elections commission whatever now
[1:43:34.120 --> 1:43:39.120]  they admit and I know for a fact top democratic operatives in DC are working right now on
[1:43:39.120 --> 1:43:44.120]  systems to try to shut us down and if they're successful with us in the coming months they
[1:43:44.120 --> 1:43:51.120]  will try to shut everybody else down across the country so understand that they can try
[1:43:51.120 --> 1:44:01.120]  to declare us fake news everywhere come after us politically and if they're successful in
[1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:09.120]  shutting us down I mean they were asking for criminal charges the last month of Obama's
[1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:12.120]  office because they thought they could arrest me somehow that would scare everybody else
[1:44:12.120 --> 1:44:16.120]  to roll over and go okay we'll stop criticizing you you're delusional they're all they're going
[1:44:16.120 --> 1:44:21.120]  to do is make me a mega superstar which I don't even want because this is getting dangerous
[1:44:21.120 --> 1:44:26.120]  but I have a duty and I've got to go to the end and not back off but I guess they've got
[1:44:26.120 --> 1:44:31.120]  a CNN clip with Anderson Cooper now that I don't even watch their channels I guess this
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:37.120]  was last night with them saying that he got the wiretap story from me when I just showed
[1:44:37.120 --> 1:44:42.120]  you if you're a TV viewer of the January 20th cover of the New York Times and it was all
[1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:47.120]  over the news then but again they're like oh Trump's really in trouble the top story today
[1:44:47.120 --> 1:44:51.120]  isn't that North Korea is threatening to nuke and that we're having to you know deal with
[1:44:51.120 --> 1:45:01.120]  them it's that Trump has apologized to England no they just said look okay we don't call
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:06.120]  it wiretap it's intercepts so they're playing games with semantics everybody knows everything
[1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:15.120]  spied on sheen the movie snowton they're not denying that sheen see I thought that the
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:20.120]  big data dump would be more successful and it was still big just a week or so ago a week
[1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:26.120]  and a half ago vault seven thousands and thousands of pages of admissions of how they're sabotaging
[1:45:26.120 --> 1:45:31.120]  our own infrastructure blaming on Russia how they've got kill switches and most the appliances
[1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:37.120]  cracking and listening and watching us and how they're surveilling all this garbage oh
[1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:44.120]  no it's crazy no one listens to the president elect when he was president elect folks under
[1:45:44.120 --> 1:45:51.120]  law they listened to all his calls the foreign governments and it's just media hoaxing and
[1:45:51.120 --> 1:45:56.120]  then getting even republican leadership to get scared and then then they come in to the
[1:45:56.120 --> 1:46:00.120]  attorney general and they go sir we're compromising the entire spy grid where you know the DEA
[1:46:00.120 --> 1:46:04.120]  spy grid all of it we have to come out and say the president wasn't being listened to
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:09.120]  and sessions through the president under the bus I love senator sessions he's done a great
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:14.120]  job but man I tell you he's really really getting intimidated the only guy not getting
[1:46:14.120 --> 1:46:20.120]  intimidated out there's Donald Trump who else isn't intimidated me drugs isn't intimidated
[1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:25.120]  and believe me this is not some boys club that I want to be only a few people the country
[1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:35.120]  needs to grow testicles I've got like 30 articles I personally looked up a few weeks ago when
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:43.120]  this latest fiasco got launched and I pulled up the Washington Post New York Times LA Times
[1:46:43.120 --> 1:46:48.120]  Associated Press CNN going oh Trump's been caught we've got the intercepts we've got the
[1:46:48.120 --> 1:46:53.120]  surveillance we've got the wiretaps using the improper term yeah we got the transcripts
[1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:58.120]  of bunch of Trump people talking to the Russians and talking about all this illegal stuff too
[1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:02.120]  months later they don't release it they go we never said we had that you're insane you
[1:47:02.120 --> 1:47:07.120]  have no memory that never happened boom show them the New York Times again and then Trump's
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:11.120]  people finally get it they go oh you don't call it wiretap they haven't had that since
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:17.120]  the 80s yeah it's intercepts it's it's the old terms of wiretapper you go put a recorder
[1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:22.120]  hooked on to the copper wire that no that's not what this is wiretap data that's the New
[1:47:22.120 --> 1:47:29.120]  York Times putting that out but see they don't want us to have a show they don't want drugs
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:34.120]  to have a platform because they don't want us to do one thing it's called a memory it's
[1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:43.120]  called show you the facts show you the money that's why they hate me and that's why we are
[1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:50.120]  now an enemy number uno here is the known CIA officer and one of the richest men in
[1:47:50.120 --> 1:47:56.120]  America the aired one of the largest fortunes in the world Anderson Cooper waging war against
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:48:03.120]  America the president the nationalist movement and myself and my family here he is has heard
[1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:08.120]  what do you make of the White House citing your article as part of just just back up
[1:48:08.120 --> 1:48:13.120]  they teach these guys this look of confidence and they they knew Q score testing to look
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:20.120]  confident can you imagine looking like more of a you know what eating grand just to look
[1:48:20.120 --> 1:48:25.120]  on that New York Times guy who's clearly an operative just look at the arrogance and he's
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:29.120]  just because they think is there in some agency that you they've arrived and just look at him
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:36.120]  just I mean I can't even do that smug face because it's kind of feminine it's okay I'm
[1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:41.120]  you'll Brenner and I'm playing the part of Pharaoh in the new film coming out by Cecil B.
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:45.120]  DeMille it's the biggest budget in history it's called the 10 Commandments starring
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:52.120]  Charles and Aston I'm you'll Brenner and whatever you do don't smoke I'm you'll Brenner
[1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:58.120]  and whatever you do don't be a traitor to the country well who is this ding dong so let's
[1:48:58.120 --> 1:49:03.120]  go another arrogant I could look out the little beard to these little little all these weirdos
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:08.120]  that they dug up to come on and like pansy around with Anderson Cooper here it is has
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:14.120]  heard what do you make of the White House citing your article as part of the evidence I mean
[1:49:14.120 --> 1:49:19.120]  it's it's it's getting bizarre at this point oh it's getting bizarre back it up again oh
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:23.120]  let's use peer pressure it's it's I mean the president might get impeached over this
[1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:29.120]  Bloomberg said I mean it's getting bizarre I mean the president claims he was wiretapped
[1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:34.120]  when there was literally hundreds of front page papers saying it I mean he's so crazy
[1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:41.120]  I mean it's all over I mean here back to him it's getting bizarre at this point because
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:46.120]  we've said it very clearly and I said on your show that that's not what the story said anybody
[1:49:46.120 --> 1:49:51.120]  can read the story and see that's not what it said it possible this we have the cover
[1:49:51.120 --> 1:49:57.120]  of the newspaper put back on screen for TV viewers New York Times January twenty two thousand
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:50:02.120]  something and we have today before the day after we have it all you have the intercepts
[1:50:02.120 --> 1:50:08.120]  you recorded it all you recorded Tom Tower but you're hoping you're the viewers of CNN
[1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:12.120]  are the types that don't go look this up but they're scared like what do they start looking
[1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:16.120]  it up what do they find Alex Jones exploding shut him down shut him up if we don't take
[1:50:16.120 --> 1:50:20.120]  down the lead elephant if we don't get Jones and fast this is the top of the Democratic
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:26.120]  Party right now confirmed we have moles are meeting on how to take us down right now you're
[1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:30.120]  going to see probably moving the next few weeks because they just don't know what to
[1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:34.120]  do because I will show you the New York Times let's get the break might be here soon so
[1:50:34.120 --> 1:50:40.120]  it doesn't matter seriously this is it let's let's start at the beginning and I'm not going
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:44.120]  to interrupt I'm sorry let's go back to Anderson Cooper and this New York Times guy sitting
[1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:50.120]  there trying to look like licks Luther acting tough here it is what do you make of the White
[1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:56.120]  House citing your article as part of the evidence I mean it's it's it's getting bizarre at this
[1:50:56.120 --> 1:51:01.120]  point because we've said it very clearly and I said on your show that that's not what the
[1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:06.120]  story said anybody can read the story and see that's not what it said and so there's this
[1:51:06.120 --> 1:51:11.120]  bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wire
[1:51:11.120 --> 1:51:18.120]  tap which I can't handle it pause again back it up you know what we've done this I don't want
[1:51:18.120 --> 1:51:22.120]  to send a Don Salazar article or Paul Watson article I want the crew I'll do it myself
[1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:26.120]  we've got a great crew but I want to show like 30 40 articles I've already done it before
[1:51:26.120 --> 1:51:30.120]  with a Washington Post in New York Times where they said we have intercepts we have transcripts
[1:51:30.120 --> 1:51:37.120]  we know they had Russian contacts there were headlines like cloakroom bug to catch Russians
[1:51:37.120 --> 1:51:42.120]  just last year I mean it was full on they were on the news saying we need the Justice Department
[1:51:42.120 --> 1:51:47.120]  to investigate Trump and to surveil him this is six months ago about his Russian connections
[1:51:47.120 --> 1:51:53.120]  and then they did it and now these agencies are all covering their ass lying up the chain of
[1:51:53.120 --> 1:52:01.120]  command saying something that all of us heard him say thousands of times so that's our job
[1:52:01.120 --> 1:52:04.120]  here at info wars is to get the clips and I'm giving the listeners the listeners to go
[1:52:04.120 --> 1:52:07.120]  find these two and put them we need to you met because we're overwhelmed here but there's
[1:52:07.120 --> 1:52:13.120]  so much of it just search Democrats Congress call for investigation into Russia ties call
[1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:19.120]  for surveillance headlines went back months ago intercepts and surveillance you know caught
[1:52:19.120 --> 1:52:26.120]  Trump contacts the headline wiretaps caught Trump I mean it's you just showed the headline
[1:52:26.120 --> 1:52:33.120]  and he's saying it's bizarre in the circular reasoning that I say it and then Trump says
[1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:39.120]  it and then he had yeah I say you wrote an article with wiretap in the headline Jack you
[1:52:39.120 --> 1:52:46.120]  bet I did here's the now they've changed it intercepted Russian communications oh it's
[1:52:46.120 --> 1:52:52.120]  not a wiretap it's intercepted communications part of inquiry into Trump associates print
[1:52:52.120 --> 1:52:59.120]  them all oh that's January 19th with Matthew Rosenberg and Michael Schmidt and Adam Goldman
[1:52:59.120 --> 1:53:08.120]  and Matt Appuzo appellusable and you talk to me like I'm one of your zombie look at that
[1:53:08.120 --> 1:53:13.120]  look on that slime bags face man that arrogance person would you have that go over for drinks
[1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:17.120]  or to play golf would you go shooting with that jackass I take one look at somebody that's
[1:53:17.120 --> 1:53:23.120]  got that type of SH you know what eating grin and I don't walk I run and then look at Cooper
[1:53:23.120 --> 1:53:30.120]  another fake another fraud another scumbag liar I am school I'm not afraid of you guys
[1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:35.120]  just get that straight I'm gonna defeat you the American people are gonna defeat you God
[1:53:35.120 --> 1:53:45.120]  is gonna defeat you oh please God this rose over us I guess they're a little bit better
[1:53:45.120 --> 1:53:48.120]  than Kim Jong-un they love us to live under something like that that's what they want
[1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:52.120]  folks they're getting rid of whiteboards all over the country somebody might write something
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:58.120]  that hurts somebody's feelings they're ending language except for our ruling class a turd
[1:53:58.120 --> 1:54:07.120]  basket Matthew Rosenberg yeah yeah let's show both these articles intercepts show Trump
[1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:18.120]  with the Russians wiretaps show Trump's people the Russians written by you and you still
[1:54:18.120 --> 1:54:22.120]  force fetus because I'm wearing a tie I've got a shaved head I act like I'm really cool
[1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:28.120]  I flop around acting tough all day in New York look at that let's go back to him hurt us
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:33.120]  and see that's not what it said and so this this bizarre circular thing happening where
[1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:39.120]  the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped which developed on the kind of fringe right wing
[1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:46.120]  media and then we show the actual friends whites after his tweet storm info wars then
[1:54:46.120 --> 1:54:52.120]  started saying well look it was the New York Times who reported it citing our story boss
[1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:56.120]  finally says something true yes we do a lot of the thinking around here I'm actually I'm
[1:54:56.120 --> 1:55:01.120]  pretty scared but frankly I'm pretty scared right now because I'm not scared of what they'll
[1:55:01.120 --> 1:55:07.120]  do to me I'm scared of the fact that they might win if the other outlets out there don't get
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:12.120]  better memories because yes national review put it out they were forced to retract it
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:16.120]  because it wasn't true because it was so damning and national review is run by the CIA that's
[1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:21.120]  declassified so they pull it we're already covering it the web it already found it but
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:25.120]  we were already covering it months before that these headlines said this when they were
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:30.120]  starting to deny it so yes you're right you're right you're right half the time info wars
[1:55:30.120 --> 1:55:35.120]  is getting more intel out to help the president and save the republic and all other libertarian
[1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:40.120]  conservative media combined and then drudge takes our articles and takes it the next level
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:44.120]  and dominates and it wasn't for drudge and it wasn't for info wars people like this would
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:50.120]  be winning right now and all I care about is not letting scum like Matthew Rosenberg
[1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:56.120]  and Anderson Cooper to rule us let's finish the piece and then after his tweet storm info
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:55:59.120]  wars then sort of saying well look it was the New York Times who reported it citing our
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:05.120]  story misreading our story and now if you stop me I can teach a college course on this seat
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:08.120]  that's one problem with his tweeting his tweeting is great but it's always got a link to even
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:13.120]  maybe something he writes on his own presidential page so you can say this is a true look right
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:19.120]  here is my proof because Trump has a memory he's smart reportedly one like an elephant
[1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:24.120]  basically photograph even at 70 and he remembers them all saying he was being wiretapped and
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:27.120]  being watched in the New York Times he reads it every day he reads the New York Times in
[1:56:27.120 --> 1:56:31.120]  the morning you know the cover so he tweets hey there were some buying on me blah blah
[1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:35.120]  blah that's illegal when they started to say he was a russian agent had proof he's like
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:40.120]  why are you spying on me do you have you have warrants for that then it came out they had
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:44.120]  warrants for Roger Stone and people but not for Trump and then they hope they can spin
[1:56:44.120 --> 1:56:53.120]  golly you in this whole con game to sit here and hoax everybody and say oh Trump puts it
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:57:00.120]  out and then we run behind him and then try to prove what he said no we covered your article
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:09.120]  at the national inauguration on the 20th dude I held it up on TV and radio I covered it twice I
[1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:16.120]  was there I have a brain I remember scumbag Trump remembers I'm gonna play the rest of

[1:59:17.120 --> 1:59:22.120]  superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that everyone knew that
[1:59:22.120 --> 1:59:26.120]  you used all the parts of the animal you use the meat for sustenance the fat for cooking
[1:59:26.120 --> 1:59:31.120]  but you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and
[1:59:31.120 --> 1:59:36.120]  Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body this is the engine of the
[1:59:36.120 --> 1:59:41.120]  life essence I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying
[1:59:41.120 --> 1:59:45.120]  to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it I know
[1:59:45.120 --> 1:59:49.120]  you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself and for
[1:59:49.120 --> 2:00:14.120]  life.com today you're listening to the Alex Jones show resistance to tyrants is obedience
[2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:19.120]  to God it's Alex Jones
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:57.120]  the blitz is on and it didn't take long for the deep state to put its full weight into
[2:00:57.120 --> 2:01:03.120]  the counter offensive needed to attempt to offset the damage to public trust after WikiLeaks
[2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:10.120]  exposed catastrophic levels of the CIA's cyber warfare arsenal as the Hill wrote at
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:17.120]  issue is the CIA's purported strategy of keeping a database of stolen malware produced by other
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:24.120]  countries including Russia with umbridge and related projects the CIA cannot only increase
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:29.120]  its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:35.120]  fingerprints of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from yet it's a full
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:41.120]  effort press to expose Russian hacking involvement not the CIA we're here to announce a major
[2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:47.120]  law enforcement action related to one of the largest dated breaches in US history today
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:53.120]  we are announcing the indictment of four individuals responsible for the 2014 hack into the network
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:02:01.120]  of email provider yahoo the theft of information about at least 500 million yahoo accounts and
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:07.120]  the use of that information to obtain the contents of accounts of at yahoo and other
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:13.120]  email providers the defendants include two officers of the Russian federal security service
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:19.120]  and intelligence and law enforcement agency of the Russian Federation and two criminal
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:25.120]  hackers with whom they conspired to accomplish these intrusions meanwhile Roger Stone now
[2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:31.120]  being regarded as a central character connected to the WikiLeaks exposure of the CIA is being
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:39.120]  targeted with respect to Roger Stone you know we have a US person affiliated with the campaign
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:45.120]  who has now said publicly that he had communications I think first he said would Julian Assange
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:53.120]  and then he said after that with the intermediary to Mr. Assange or WikiLeaks and has now acknowledged
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:59.120]  having communication with Goosa for two which the intelligence community views as a essentially
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:05.120]  a Russian cutout and obviously these two platforms were used to publish documents damaging to
[2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:09.120]  Secretary Clinton and helpful to Donald Trump so I'll tell you that concerns me a great deal
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:17.120]  you know I am responding and pointing out the problems with the headline Trump associate
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:25.120]  was in touch with the Russian hacker that's a false narrative by contact excuse me was
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:31.120]  was after the hacking demonstrates that I could not have colluded we were trying to get
[2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:35.120]  Goosa for 2.0 on and WikiLeaks everybody the media does that too they I mean they just think
[2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:41.120]  the public's done they said the New York Times that they were surveilling Trump with wiretaps
[2:03:41.120 --> 2:03:45.120]  on January 20th we talked about we did a whole show on it we showed it and then now they're
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:49.120]  saying that never happened it's insane he's crazy there were no wiretaps the president
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:57.120]  my car was t-boned by a car coming out of nowhere the windshield so darkly tinted
[2:03:57.120 --> 2:04:03.120]  you could see not see who was inside the car it was starting the airbags went off and
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:11.120]  they came in at the passenger door where I was seated and then the driver threw it in reverse
[2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:19.120]  even though he had sustained some damage and took off propaganda espionage blackmail
[2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:28.120]  subversion the 21st century versions of these are fake news hacking
[2:04:28.120 --> 2:04:36.120]  Compromat and political capture the Russians have been at this for a long time last month
[2:04:36.120 --> 2:04:41.120]  at the Munich security conference Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov didn't mince words about
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:47.120]  his country's intentions when he looked forward to the creation of a post-west world order
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:54.120]  Mr. White House's very statement is fake news on its face as Mr. Lavrov's explanation of a
[2:04:54.120 --> 2:05:01.120]  post-west world order is far more complex and diplomatic than what was presented by Mr. White House
[2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:08.120]  This is Mary Weaver reporting for infowars.com the official McDonald's Twitter account tweeted out
[2:05:08.120 --> 2:05:14.120]  an anti-Trump tweet which caused a huge stir on Twitter which some speculate may not have been
[2:05:14.120 --> 2:05:20.120]  an accident at all the tweet said you are actually a disgusting excuse of a president
[2:05:20.120 --> 2:05:27.120]  and we would love to have Barack Obama back also you have tiny hands now McDonald's claims
[2:05:27.120 --> 2:05:32.120]  that it was the result of a hacker but some have pointed the finger at Robert Gibbs Obama's
[2:05:32.120 --> 2:05:38.120]  former press secretary who now works as the global chief officer for McDonald's well there's
[2:05:38.120 --> 2:05:43.120]  no proof that it was Robert Gibbs however I would say that Robert Gibbs is a perfect fit
[2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:48.120]  for McDonald's given that his job was to make Obama look good well I'm sure they'll have
[2:05:48.120 --> 2:05:55.120]  no problem making the McDonald's McChicken fake nuggets look good as well for more awesome reports

[2:07:59.120 --> 2:08:14.120]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[2:08:21.120 --> 2:08:26.120]  all right folks we are very very honored in the next 20 minutes we're going to be joined by Larry C. Johnson
[2:08:26.120 --> 2:08:33.120]  of noquarterusa.net look over his award-winning distinguished career at the CIA it would take
[2:08:33.120 --> 2:08:38.120]  too long so I won't do it and he also headed up as deputy director in the U.S. State Department's
[2:08:38.120 --> 2:08:45.120]  office of counterterrorism crisis management and so much more he also ran intelligence
[2:08:45.120 --> 2:08:51.120]  operations into Kuwait and that whole situation I don't have time to go over it all obviously
[2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:57.120]  participate in the investigation the terrorist bombing of Pan Am 103 and I saw him on an RT
[2:08:57.120 --> 2:09:02.120]  piece we're all Russian agents after all that now including Rand Paul just two days ago he's a Russian
[2:09:02.120 --> 2:09:08.120]  agent because he doesn't want to send NATO in to Montenegro and Ukraine and hopefully have a war
[2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:15.120]  with Russia just a crazy time to be alive folks but this article on our Facebook got 4,000 shares
[2:09:15.120 --> 2:09:21.120]  in 20 minutes and was deleted they then subsequently deleted more than a hundred articles in the next
[2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:27.120]  week and a half I mean this is just unprecedented they said they're fake so he's an admitted
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:34.120]  senior scholar national TV written books I mean the guy's well-known super credible was a
[2:09:34.120 --> 2:09:42.120]  intelligence section chief on analysis over a whole sector for the CIA and you know got medals
[2:09:42.120 --> 2:09:47.120]  for it and but that's fake news folks remember if you don't believe Rand Paul's a Russian agent
[2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:52.120]  he said you work for Vladimir Putin insane McCain you are so that's the new level I love how
[2:09:52.120 --> 2:10:00.120]  Trump just ruined the whole Russian gas market by bringing coal back on boy I tell you Trump's not
[2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:04.120]  stand-up for America yes he is he's standing up for our interest not against anybody but for our
[2:10:04.120 --> 2:10:10.120]  interest that's why you see a roaring economy but I'll stop babbling about that it's just so surreal
[2:10:10.120 --> 2:10:15.120]  if Anderson Cooper last night say Trump got his idea that the New York Times said they were
[2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:21.120]  surveilling them for me no we can put it on screen and go to our guest Mr. Rosen wrote not one
[2:10:21.120 --> 2:10:26.120]  but two articles January 19th and 20th saying they intercepted these are words they wiretapped
[2:10:26.120 --> 2:10:31.120]  the Trump's communications but they did it by people they were contacting so now they're saying
[2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:35.120]  the president has all this egg on his face is crazy I want to play because it's so censored
[2:10:35.120 --> 2:10:42.120]  just a one-minute clip from the larger 10-minute interview of Larry C. Johnson on RT that they
[2:10:42.120 --> 2:10:51.120]  do not want you to see here it is for John Brennan as CIA were intimately involved in
[2:10:51.120 --> 2:10:58.120]  trying to derail the candidacy of Donald Trump that there was some collusion overseas with
[2:10:58.120 --> 2:11:06.120]  Europe with Britain's own GHCQ that information that was gathered from GHCQ was actually passed
[2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:13.120]  to John Brennan and it was disseminated within the US government this dissemination was illegal
[2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:21.120]  Donald Trump is in essence correct that the intelligence agencies and some in the law enforcement
[2:11:21.120 --> 2:11:30.120]  community on the side of the FBI were in fact illegally trying to access monitor his communications
[2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:36.120]  with his aides and with other people all of this with an end to trying to destroy this credit
[2:11:36.120 --> 2:11:42.120]  his presidency I don't think there will be any doubt of that I think it's worth noting that the
[2:11:42.120 --> 2:11:48.120]  head of the National Security Agency and Admiral Rogers made a journey to Trump Tower
[2:11:48.120 --> 2:11:56.120]  shortly after Trump had won and in the immediate aftermath of his visit the C and Jim Clapper
[2:11:56.120 --> 2:12:03.120]  and others in the intelligence community called for his him to be fired now why did Rogers go
[2:12:03.120 --> 2:12:10.120]  to Trump Tower my understanding is let's call it it was to cover himself because he was aware
[2:12:10.120 --> 2:12:17.120]  that the NSA had been the authorities had been misused and abused with respect to Donald Trump
[2:12:17.120 --> 2:12:24.120]  so I think Trump's decision to go out this morning and tweak this was fully intended to send a notice
[2:12:24.120 --> 2:12:31.120]  and send word that I don't think he's doing this without evidence he does have evidence I think it was
[2:12:31.120 --> 2:12:36.120]  just an artfully expressed in the tweet all right now notice Trump then comes out a week later
[2:12:36.120 --> 2:12:41.120]  and says look they call it I called it wiretap it just means intercept listening to exactly what Larry
[2:12:41.120 --> 2:12:47.120]  C. Johnson's saying but I've had all the whistleblowers Thomas Drake on Benny the former head of technical NSA
[2:12:47.120 --> 2:12:52.120]  of course it's all surveilled they're just using the public's ignorance of this to a lot of people
[2:12:52.120 --> 2:12:57.120]  but now they're coming out saying Larry C. Johnson's wrong Judge DePaulitano is wrong to picked up on it
[2:12:57.120 --> 2:13:03.120]  when I wasn't in the CIA and I've not been it but I'd read the news for 20 something years this is admitted
[2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:09.120]  everything a president elect does on the phone to foreign leaders is being recorded so wow to have CNN
[2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:15.120]  come out and say we're crazy they never said wiretap when they did but as our guest said that's in artful
[2:13:15.120 --> 2:13:20.120]  the proper term I guess is intercept let's talk to Larry C. Johnson now so he's got at least 15 minutes
[2:13:20.120 --> 2:13:26.120]  at the bottom of the hour to really have the floor and break down this whole controversy thank you for coming on
[2:13:26.120 --> 2:13:32.120]  Mr. Johnson hi Alex are you good good so you've heard my breakdown of this I mean how accurate is that from your
[2:13:32.120 --> 2:13:40.120]  educated standpoint well yeah it's the essence of the story we've got a we've got a lot of things going on here
[2:13:40.120 --> 2:13:47.120]  I guess the real fundamental thing that all to alarm all Americans regardless of their political party their
[2:13:47.120 --> 2:13:55.120]  political affiliation is what has been going on with former leaders of the Central Intelligence Agency
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:14:03.120]  and that and in the director of National Intelligence Agency's office is direct interference in the domestic
[2:14:03.120 --> 2:14:10.120]  politics if we're going to talk about Russian meddling in US politics that needs to be acknowledged that these
[2:14:10.120 --> 2:14:17.120]  intelligence agencies are the principles at the top were involved with meddling now do I have first-hand knowledge
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:24.120]  that John Brennan was doing this no I do not I have been told though by someone who is in a position to know
[2:14:24.120 --> 2:14:31.120]  who's still within the intelligence community that absolutely that's what was going on that Brennan and that
[2:14:31.120 --> 2:14:39.120]  there are shenanigans going on between the GHCQ and US intelligence how does that work you've got your
[2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:47.120]  your listeners should understand that it is illegal without some warrant for any of the intelligence or law
[2:14:47.120 --> 2:14:55.120]  enforcement agencies to collect on American citizens it is not illegal for the British to their version of NSA
[2:14:55.120 --> 2:15:01.120]  to collect on American citizens because we're foreigners as far as they're concerned and we're a legitimate target
[2:15:01.120 --> 2:15:09.120]  similarly United States can really collect on any British citizen because they're not Americans they don't have
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:16.120]  the constitutional protection we all spy on each other then yeah I mean and you know if anybody's so naive to
[2:15:16.120 --> 2:15:23.120]  think that the Brits aren't spying on Americans and Americans aren't spying on Brits well you know I hate to burst
[2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:31.120]  your bubble but the reality is that's what spy agencies do they collect and gather intelligence on other entities
[2:15:31.120 --> 2:15:37.120]  that's one of their purposes remember the scandal just four years ago where the CIA was spying on Republicans and
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:42.120]  Democrats in the Senate the Intelligence Committee heads right when that was you know John Brennan again
[2:15:42.120 --> 2:15:48.120]  I had his fingerprints all over that because they they didn't want the information about the torture report to come
[2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:55.120]  out and Brennan initially denied that that was going on and then later had to admit that it was had in fact
[2:15:55.120 --> 2:16:03.120]  happened so it's not you know we're not raising these allegations without precedent and you know my concern here
[2:16:03.120 --> 2:16:12.120]  is that involving intelligence agencies in domestic politics takes us down a very very dangerous road
[2:16:12.120 --> 2:16:20.120]  exactly I mean we have laws since 1947 the CIA is like the MI6 it's outside the country the FBI is within but we all know
[2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:26.120]  that I mean I think the CIA is probably even more involved in the FBI domestically with just the numbers of actual people
[2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:32.120]  because it's covert by nature you can't help it yet the people that are in the CIA tend to be involved politically
[2:16:32.120 --> 2:16:38.120]  just because they're own political views but then separately you had all the Russian agents in humet during the Cold War
[2:16:38.120 --> 2:16:44.120]  were crawling all over the place and then you had to have CIA domestically so so I mean isn't it a big lie to claim
[2:16:44.120 --> 2:16:52.120]  we don't have supposedly foreign projected intelligence agencies operating domestically well they they're not supposed to
[2:16:52.120 --> 2:17:00.120]  and there are rules that have been set up but again this goes back to the question of leadership at both the head of
[2:17:00.120 --> 2:17:07.120]  the director of national intelligence under the Obama administration Jim Clapper you had someone who went and lied under oath
[2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:13.120]  before Congress when you lie under oath before Congress there should be some sanction there was no sanction
[2:17:13.120 --> 2:17:20.120]  he was not punished he finished out his tour tenure with getting awards at the end and a pat on the back
[2:17:20.120 --> 2:17:28.120]  and he's probably out with some nice fat consulting agreement right now similarly John Brennan got caught
[2:17:28.120 --> 2:17:33.120]  lying about what they were doing spying on the Senate again was there any sanction
[2:17:33.120 --> 2:17:41.120]  so when you when when the people who are in the trenches look at their leaders and see the leaders getting by with lying
[2:17:41.120 --> 2:17:46.120]  and then you send some message that okay it's okay for us to do it too
[2:17:46.120 --> 2:17:52.120]  let me boil that down then it's simple these are known liars who've been caught lying who've been caught spying on the Senate
[2:17:52.120 --> 2:17:58.120]  and their bosses in the intelligence committee that's undebatable the president reads in the newspaper that he's been spied on
[2:17:58.120 --> 2:18:05.120]  by intelligence agencies in the New York Times it's all over the news we've got the intercepts we caught you know Michael Flynn
[2:18:05.120 --> 2:18:11.120]  right and then it turns out they didn't really catch him doing anything Trump turns it around and says that's illegal
[2:18:11.120 --> 2:18:15.120]  then they say we never did that I mean talk about gaslighting
[2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:23.120]  well right and there was the article I think it appeared on March 1st and then New York Times
[2:18:23.120 --> 2:18:28.120]  now this is just over about two weeks ago and here's what it says
[2:18:28.120 --> 2:18:37.120]  American allies including the British and Dutch had provided information describing meetings in European cities
[2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:45.120]  between Russian officials and others close to Russia's president Putin and associates of President-elect Trump
[2:18:45.120 --> 2:18:53.120]  okay let me translate that for your listeners there's only two types of information those countries are going to have
[2:18:53.120 --> 2:18:59.120]  either they've got human intelligence they had a spy who was there who was part of the meeting and could report on it
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:07.120]  or they had an intercept a wiretap if you will but you know wiretaps it goes back to the days when all communication went over a
[2:19:07.120 --> 2:19:14.120]  phone wire it's really more correct to call this electronic surveillance
[2:19:14.120 --> 2:19:22.120]  what do you just make of CNN with Anderson Cooper who won't tell people he was an intern CIA and then got out of it yet right
[2:19:22.120 --> 2:19:29.120]  and now he's up here telling us that you know nobody's spying on Trump and trying to sell us a preposterous line
[2:19:29.120 --> 2:19:34.120]  when even someone that's not politically informed about what's happening you know with the NSA or surveillance
[2:19:34.120 --> 2:19:39.120]  knows they were all over the news bragging we have the intercepts of Trump and his people talking to the Russians
[2:19:39.120 --> 2:19:43.120]  and then now a month and a half later they want us to forget and then they're saying you're wrong
[2:19:43.120 --> 2:19:53.120]  Trump's wrong speak to that and then and then why do you think your interview because it's not just here other places YouTube
[2:19:53.120 --> 2:19:59.120]  Google it's being blocked everywhere being delisted they really didn't like you speaking out
[2:19:59.120 --> 2:20:07.120]  well I'm used to being censored look I got fired as a Fox News Analyst they didn't renew my contract because I went on
[2:20:07.120 --> 2:20:13.120]  to be in Combs in November of 2002 and said that going in Iraq would be a diversion in the war on terror
[2:20:13.120 --> 2:20:19.120]  and I was told later that Roger Ailes directed that I was not to be allowed back on air because they didn't want that point of view
[2:20:19.120 --> 2:20:22.120]  by the way you were the deputy head of counterterrorism so you'd know
[2:20:22.120 --> 2:20:28.120]  well I was the deputy director and I had a real long title so I was not really the number two guy
[2:20:28.120 --> 2:20:33.120]  the point is you're an expert on it and you're really being honest and by the way Donald Trump agreed with you back then
[2:20:33.120 --> 2:20:41.120]  you know that's the that's the fact what's look what's going on here is the media has invested itself in a particular narrative
[2:20:41.120 --> 2:20:47.120]  and they're not going to give it up and they won't they won't allow anybody to come on and actually have a debate about it
[2:20:47.120 --> 2:20:52.120]  and talk about it in substance I remember seeing you on Fox I mean I used to really make great points that actually agreed with
[2:20:52.120 --> 2:20:58.120]  but again because you didn't totally tell the line we're taking out the wrong Muslims if they're the non radicals
[2:20:58.120 --> 2:21:03.120]  we wouldn't be Saudi Arabia or somebody we wouldn't be taking out you know Saddam right
[2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:10.120]  now I look this we've yet to come to grips with the reality that when we remove Saddam who's saying we essentially let a fuse
[2:21:10.120 --> 2:21:17.120]  on a giant bomb that's blown up in our face and that's where this this spread of ISIS and Al Qaeda that is taking place
[2:21:17.120 --> 2:21:20.120]  and you warned of that back in the times I remember seeing the news articles
[2:21:20.120 --> 2:21:29.120]  yeah so you know it's it's it's really not that complicated but we get other things going on but and so now that I have the audacity to suggest
[2:21:29.120 --> 2:21:36.120]  that Russia may actually be a victim in some of these activities and that we on the United States side are doing things
[2:21:36.120 --> 2:21:42.120]  that when viewed from a Russian perspective would alarm them I mean let me just give you a very simple example
[2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:50.120]  two weeks ago and then earlier this week you get reports in the US news media about a Russian spy ship off our east coast
[2:21:50.120 --> 2:21:55.120]  and the news media reports it breathlessly as a look at what those dastardly Russians are doing
[2:21:55.120 --> 2:22:03.120]  yet nobody in the media is reporting that the US military is conducting military exercises two weeks ago
[2:22:03.120 --> 2:22:10.120]  we were conducting a naval exercise in the Black Sea that was simulating a war with Russia
[2:22:10.120 --> 2:22:19.120]  now if if Russia was conducting military exercises off our shores simulating an attack on us
[2:22:19.120 --> 2:22:20.120]  because of say Houston
[2:22:20.120 --> 2:22:27.120]  yeah or had troops in Mexico and Canada right now we have troops in Poland two weeks ago we had troops in Romania
[2:22:27.120 --> 2:22:32.120]  they were carrying out military exercises so my only point I'm not to excuse the Russians
[2:22:32.120 --> 2:22:37.120]  but I'm simply saying let's recognize there's a context for this they're not reacting in a vacuum
[2:22:37.120 --> 2:22:44.120]  and by the simple fact that I bring that up I've been accused as being a propagandist a puppet of Putin
[2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:52.120]  a Russian stooge and well since you raised that did you see the clip where McCain says like four times he repeats it
[2:22:52.120 --> 2:23:00.120]  he says you are an agent of Putin violating was it rule 19 the Senate but just crazy no one could ever claim that
[2:23:00.120 --> 2:23:06.120]  Rand Paul's a Russian agent because he doesn't want to start a war with Russia while China is in the South China Sea
[2:23:06.120 --> 2:23:10.120]  North Korea is fighting to nuke people we may have to have a war any day
[2:23:10.120 --> 2:23:13.120]  I mean this is one of the most dangerous times ever I want to see if you agree
[2:23:13.120 --> 2:23:19.120]  Rex Tillerson says military options on the table and then meanwhile we're worried about Russia that's not expanding
[2:23:19.120 --> 2:23:24.120]  well and Senator Paul made an excellent I mean he made a substantive argument later
[2:23:24.120 --> 2:23:29.120]  I think the following down morning Joe on MSNBC where he laid out the fact
[2:23:29.120 --> 2:23:37.120]  Montenegro is such a poor country they're so weak militarily they add nothing to NATO and they're not going to be able to pay their full weight
[2:23:37.120 --> 2:23:43.120]  so why in the world would we want to bring them into NATO because there's nothing to be gained from a strategic
[2:23:43.120 --> 2:23:45.120]  unless you want to use it as a trigger for another crisis
[2:23:45.120 --> 2:23:48.120]  unless you want to use it as a trigger for another crisis
[2:23:48.120 --> 2:23:53.120]  no and that's exactly right this is you know what most Americans fail to understand
[2:23:53.120 --> 2:24:00.120]  we take great pride in our you know the greatest generation who fought World War II and everything that we endured
[2:24:00.120 --> 2:24:08.120]  and our great sacrifices you know we lost the total number of soldier sailors, airmen, Marines that died in World War II
[2:24:08.120 --> 2:24:13.120]  in both the Pacific and European theater there are 470,000
[2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:21.120]  the Russians at the Battle of Stalingrad one battle over a six month period lost one million soldiers
[2:24:21.120 --> 2:24:28.120]  my point in this is they're a lot more sensitive to threats on their border than we are
[2:24:28.120 --> 2:24:34.120]  and they view the military activity such as the ones we're conducting as provocative
[2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:41.120]  and the last time they had that kind of military activity on their borders was in May of 1941
[2:24:41.120 --> 2:24:43.120]  it was Operation Barbarossa
[2:24:43.120 --> 2:24:44.120]  it was made by the Nazis
[2:24:44.120 --> 2:24:46.120]  this Operation Barbarossa was about to kick off
[2:24:46.120 --> 2:24:53.120]  yeah so I'm just, it's not to apologize for Putin you know Putin's a bad guy and does some bad things
[2:24:53.120 --> 2:24:56.120]  but hello he's not the only one in the world
[2:24:56.120 --> 2:25:00.120]  well sure but wouldn't you agree that China is probably right now ten times the threat that Russia is
[2:25:00.120 --> 2:25:02.120]  they're just running wild
[2:25:02.120 --> 2:25:07.120]  yeah no there's a, China is a much more organized threat to the United States
[2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:09.120]  particularly on the economic side
[2:25:09.120 --> 2:25:11.120]  I mean I could take you through case after case
[2:25:11.120 --> 2:25:12.120]  if you have time let's do it
[2:25:12.120 --> 2:25:15.120]  you probably got a ghost if you stay a little bit after the break in a few minutes
[2:25:15.120 --> 2:25:19.120]  please do but just getting back to this New York Times writer
[2:25:19.120 --> 2:25:23.120]  I want to play a short clip where he claims Trump got the idea from me
[2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:24.120]  that there was wiretapping
[2:25:24.120 --> 2:25:26.120]  no it was in the New York Times
[2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:30.120]  I mean I've never seen such attempts at just bazaar
[2:25:30.120 --> 2:25:32.120]  you know the sun isn't in the sky at noon
[2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:34.120]  I don't know as a CIA guy what you'd call this
[2:25:34.120 --> 2:25:37.120]  but it's just like the worst gaslighting I've ever seen
[2:25:37.120 --> 2:25:38.120]  let's play this clip
[2:25:38.120 --> 2:25:39.120]  that's heard
[2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:44.120]  what do you make of the White House citing your article as part of the evidence
[2:25:44.120 --> 2:25:47.120]  I mean it's getting bizarre at this point
[2:25:47.120 --> 2:25:49.120]  because we've said it very clearly
[2:25:49.120 --> 2:25:52.120]  and I said on your show that that's not what the story said
[2:25:52.120 --> 2:25:55.120]  anybody can read the story and see that's not what it said
[2:25:55.120 --> 2:25:58.120]  and so there's this bizarre circular thing happening
[2:25:58.120 --> 2:26:01.120]  where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped
[2:26:01.120 --> 2:26:05.120]  which developed on the kind of fringe right wing media
[2:26:05.120 --> 2:26:07.120]  there it is there's the there it is fringe wire
[2:26:07.120 --> 2:26:09.120]  and then he wrote an article the day before
[2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:12.120]  and after his tweet storm info wars then started saying
[2:26:12.120 --> 2:26:14.120]  well look it was the New York Times who reported it
[2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:16.120]  citing our story misreading our story
[2:26:16.120 --> 2:26:19.120]  and now a few weeks later the White House and the president
[2:26:19.120 --> 2:26:22.120]  are citing info wars
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:25.120]  so they've got one kind of bizarre right wing fringe theory
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:27.120]  to defend another bizarre right wing fringe theory
[2:26:27.120 --> 2:26:29.120]  both of which there's no evidence to support
[2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:31.120]  and just to be clear there is
[2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:34.120]  and correct me if I'm wrong there's absolutely nothing whatsoever
[2:26:34.120 --> 2:26:37.120]  in your reporting in the New York Times that indicates President Obama
[2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:42.120]  wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of then candidate Trump correct
[2:26:42.120 --> 2:26:46.120]  nothing I mean if we knew that that is a fantastic story
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:50.120]  that's a fantastic story it was all over CNN everywhere
[2:26:50.120 --> 2:26:52.120]  we have the intercepts we've caught General Flynn
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:26:54.120]  he better resign we have the transcript
[2:26:54.120 --> 2:26:56.120]  then they wouldn't release it because there was nothing there
[2:26:56.120 --> 2:26:59.120]  he was lining up a phone call we're showing you the articles
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:02.120]  of your radio listener intercept Russian communications
[2:27:02.120 --> 2:27:05.120]  part of inquiry into Trump Matthew Rosenberg
[2:27:05.120 --> 2:27:08.120]  and phone calls from Trump Tower being intercepted
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:13.120]  man that guy what would you call Mr. Rosenberg politically
[2:27:13.120 --> 2:27:15.120]  I mean what is he doing there
[2:27:15.120 --> 2:27:18.120]  a disinformation specialist
[2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:22.120]  look he faults he faults Donald Trump for being able to read
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:26.120]  I mean your your listeners and those who are watching
[2:27:26.120 --> 2:27:28.120]  if you simply the headline simply states
[2:27:28.120 --> 2:27:33.120]  wiretapped data used an inquiry of Trump AIDS
[2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:36.120]  it wasn't Donald Trump didn't write that headline
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:39.120]  Alex Jones didn't write that headline
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:42.120]  that was written by this guy and then the guy who writes it
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:47.120]  has the audacity to claim well there's somebody else's
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:53.120]  I mean you know we are living in such a surreal dangerous time
[2:27:53.120 --> 2:27:57.120]  it is it's literally the world that you know we read about as children
[2:27:57.120 --> 2:28:01.120]  in Alice in Wonderland that was a fictional world
[2:28:01.120 --> 2:28:04.120]  we're now seeing it in real time
[2:28:04.120 --> 2:28:09.120]  where that were objective facts are suddenly dismissed as being
[2:28:09.120 --> 2:28:12.120]  you know right wing conspiracy theories
[2:28:12.120 --> 2:28:16.120]  and it's just you know to me it's alarming
[2:28:16.120 --> 2:28:19.120]  because it really threatens the foundation of our republic
[2:28:19.120 --> 2:28:22.120]  it does can you elaborate on that again
[2:28:22.120 --> 2:28:25.120]  no quarter USA.net Larry C. Johnson
[2:28:25.120 --> 2:28:29.120]  on why you're saying we're in such a dangerous place for our republic
[2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:33.120]  this is supposed to be a nation of laws
[2:28:33.120 --> 2:28:37.120]  and look let's I can't just blame it on Obama
[2:28:37.120 --> 2:28:42.120]  because it actually it goes back it goes back really to to the foundations
[2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:46.120]  let's say with with Bill Clinton is really where we started seeing the warm turn
[2:28:46.120 --> 2:28:49.120]  but it continued on through George W. Bush
[2:28:49.120 --> 2:28:55.120]  and you know when when you essentially lie a country into a war in Iraq
[2:28:55.120 --> 2:28:58.120]  and you know you raise that and all of a sudden you become
[2:28:58.120 --> 2:29:01.120]  you're either a leftist nut or you know whatever
[2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:04.120]  you lose your moral high ground and then the sky's the limit
[2:29:04.120 --> 2:29:08.120]  yeah well there's there's no right now we have
[2:29:08.120 --> 2:29:12.120]  you know I fully support destroying ISIS
[2:29:12.120 --> 2:29:16.120]  however what's not being debated in this country is the fact that
[2:29:16.120 --> 2:29:19.120]  under Obama and now under President Trump
[2:29:19.120 --> 2:29:23.120]  we've put US troops in a foreign country
[2:29:23.120 --> 2:29:27.120]  without a declaration of war Larry C. Johnson you'd only said you'd come on
[2:29:27.120 --> 2:29:31.120]  half an hour can you do a few more minutes and finish up on the geopolitical provokes
[2:29:31.120 --> 2:29:34.120]  sure I can do that we'll be right back well we gotta get this gone more often
[2:29:34.120 --> 2:29:37.120]  I remember seeing him on Fox for so long read a lot of his writings
[2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:40.120]  and then there's these great guys you don't see anymore because they're censoring him
[2:29:40.120 --> 2:29:43.120]  and then when he does an interview they block it on Facebook
[2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:47.120]  and then Gizmodo writes an article going yeah ban it good
[2:29:47.120 --> 2:29:50.120]  that's Univision saying ban American press
[2:29:50.120 --> 2:29:54.120]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:54.120 --> 2:29:58.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:30:25.120 --> 2:30:27.120]  large enough to cook and eat
[2:30:27.120 --> 2:30:30.120]  you've probably seen where companies like this have grown beef in Petri dishes
[2:30:30.120 --> 2:30:32.120]  well now it's gonna be chicken strips
[2:30:32.120 --> 2:30:34.120]  and I know the question on everybody's mind is
[2:30:34.120 --> 2:30:37.120]  does the lap grown chicken taste like chicken
[2:30:37.120 --> 2:30:41.120]  according to the Wall Street Journal it was reported spongier than a whole chicken breast
[2:30:41.120 --> 2:30:44.120]  but they nearly nailed the flavor of the traditional variety
[2:30:44.120 --> 2:30:48.120]  this is all part of the globalist plan to remove you from the natural world
[2:30:48.120 --> 2:30:52.120]  and place you into an artificially created VR induced world
[2:30:52.120 --> 2:30:57.120]  where they control everything you see, smell, taste, think, and touch
[2:30:57.120 --> 2:31:22.120]  Rob Dew reporting for infowars.com and infowars nightly news
[2:31:28.120 --> 2:31:31.120]  yeah I've actually have just run out of my superfemale
[2:31:31.120 --> 2:31:35.120]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again
[2:31:35.120 --> 2:31:37.120]  hitting the gym once again
[2:31:37.120 --> 2:31:40.120]  very exciting, feeling great, looking good
[2:31:40.120 --> 2:31:43.120]  and I know my hair's luxurious once again
[2:31:43.120 --> 2:31:46.120]  so obviously the superfemale is amazing I love it

[2:33:24.120 --> 2:33:38.120]  music plays
[2:33:38.120 --> 2:33:41.120]  folks, I know Donald Trump's not perfect but he has the elites
[2:33:41.120 --> 2:33:44.120]  and the big centralized corporations really pissed
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:47.120]  he's already gotten 3 plus trillion dollars in the stock market from confidence
[2:33:47.120 --> 2:33:51.120]  he's deploying the central banks to get small business loans accelerated
[2:33:51.120 --> 2:33:56.120]  I don't want to go over all the things that have happened but 300 billion plus in announced new construction
[2:33:56.120 --> 2:34:00.120]  and foreign companies coming back, American companies coming back
[2:34:00.120 --> 2:34:04.120]  because they've set it up to make jobs here cost prohibitive
[2:34:04.120 --> 2:34:05.120]  that's globalism
[2:34:05.120 --> 2:34:07.120]  they sold us out to China folks
[2:34:07.120 --> 2:34:09.120]  that's the globalist plan
[2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:11.120]  with select interest
[2:34:11.120 --> 2:34:16.120]  they got developed under, you can argue under folks like Nixon
[2:34:16.120 --> 2:34:18.120]  but I'm going to go back to my guests in just a moment
[2:34:18.120 --> 2:34:23.120]  the point is, is that I'm behind Trump because he's got the elites so upset
[2:34:23.120 --> 2:34:26.120]  but certainly what he's doing is so complex and so big
[2:34:26.120 --> 2:34:27.120]  and there's such a mutiny
[2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:31.120]  they won't even hang up his signs, his picture at the VA
[2:34:31.120 --> 2:34:34.120]  and when a congressman comes and puts it up they take it down
[2:34:34.120 --> 2:34:36.120]  there's mutiny in these agencies
[2:34:36.120 --> 2:34:39.120]  these judges are violating the law, a 5 year old could read it
[2:34:39.120 --> 2:34:42.120]  and just ignoring him and ordering him to bring in more refugees
[2:34:42.120 --> 2:34:44.120]  like they're the executive branch
[2:34:44.120 --> 2:34:46.120]  totally unvetted from failed states
[2:34:46.120 --> 2:34:49.120]  this is true of the sanity, to realize they're setting a precedent
[2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:51.120]  where Google just announced today, it's on infowars.com
[2:34:51.120 --> 2:34:53.120]  their official press release
[2:34:53.120 --> 2:34:55.120]  criticize Islam in any way

[2:34:57.120 --> 2:35:00.120]  just like on Facebook, they flagged it as spam and fake news

[2:35:12.120 --> 2:35:16.120]  we have in the Trump Pence 2020
[2:35:16.120 --> 2:35:18.120]  keeping America great shirts
[2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:20.120]  just to exercise the First Amendment
[2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:24.120]  throw it in the face of the trendies that want to restrict our free speech
[2:35:24.120 --> 2:35:26.120]  give some b-roll of Leigh Ann and Millie Weaver
[2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:28.120]  we're on the shirts yesterday
[2:35:28.120 --> 2:35:30.120]  we've got a promo, I actually shot the shirts
[2:35:30.120 --> 2:35:32.120]  but when you get these
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:34.120]  it is so important
[2:35:34.120 --> 2:35:36.120]  to go out and to wear them
[2:35:36.120 --> 2:35:38.120]  and to exercise your First Amendment
[2:35:38.120 --> 2:35:40.120]  because if they can chill
[2:35:40.120 --> 2:35:42.120]  our First Amendment, they're going to win
[2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:44.120]  on every single front, they're great looking

[2:35:52.120 --> 2:35:54.120]  they had Angelina Jolie at the UN two days ago say
[2:35:54.120 --> 2:35:56.120]  we can't have nationalism
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:35:58.120]  masquerading as patriotism
[2:35:58.120 --> 2:36:00.120]  patriotism is the support of your country
[2:36:00.120 --> 2:36:02.120]  that's foreign by the people
[2:36:02.120 --> 2:36:05.120]  and America's not perfect but it's been the best example of that so far
[2:36:05.120 --> 2:36:06.120]  but we're losing it
[2:36:06.120 --> 2:36:09.120]  this is our guess said, we're in a very dangerous moment
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:11.120]  when the corruption has gone on for decades
[2:36:11.120 --> 2:36:13.120]  gotten worse and worse, the media has gone along
[2:36:13.120 --> 2:36:15.120]  with it, an arrogance sets in
[2:36:15.120 --> 2:36:17.120]  and they decide they can do anything they want
[2:36:17.120 --> 2:36:19.120]  whenever they want
[2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:21.120]  we're selling the shirts for $9.95
[2:36:21.120 --> 2:36:23.120]  it's like $5 on them

[2:36:25.120 --> 2:36:27.120]  but more importantly
[2:36:27.120 --> 2:36:29.120]  it's about you spreading the word
[2:36:29.120 --> 2:36:31.120]  and meeting like-minded people
[2:36:31.120 --> 2:36:33.120]  and openly letting folks know that they're intimidated
[2:36:33.120 --> 2:36:35.120]  because you're not intimidated hopefully
[2:36:35.120 --> 2:36:37.120]  that it's okay to stand up for your belief in

[2:36:49.120 --> 2:36:51.120]  we're under, I'm not just saying this
[2:36:51.120 --> 2:36:53.120]  I don't normally do this, we're under a lot of censorship
[2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:55.120]  a lot of attack, it's not just them every day
[2:36:55.120 --> 2:36:57.120]  on every major news channel attacking us
[2:36:57.120 --> 2:36:59.120]  and saying lies about us and having you know
[2:36:59.120 --> 2:37:01.120]  Saturday Night Live Shea
[2:37:01.120 --> 2:37:03.120]  I'm Donald Trump, Alec Baldwin playing the part
[2:37:03.120 --> 2:37:05.120]  and saying Alex doesn't believe, Alex Jones
[2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:07.120]  doesn't believe blacks are humans
[2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:09.120]  and now it's all over the web, I hate black people
[2:37:09.120 --> 2:37:11.120]  there's no clip of me saying that
[2:37:11.120 --> 2:37:13.120]  I'm like praising Trump
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:15.120]  for $25 billion for the black colleges
[2:37:15.120 --> 2:37:17.120]  when Obama gave $4 billion
[2:37:17.120 --> 2:37:19.120]  he's trying to bring people together, it's just
[2:37:19.120 --> 2:37:21.120]  they've weaponized everything
[2:37:21.120 --> 2:37:23.120]  where they've already lost the people's attention
[2:37:23.120 --> 2:37:25.120]  so they've just quadrupled
[2:37:25.120 --> 2:37:27.120]  down to say we never said
[2:37:27.120 --> 2:37:29.120]  intercepts or wiretaps of surveillance
[2:37:29.120 --> 2:37:31.120]  when it was in hundreds of newspapers
[2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:33.120]  and we've shown you those, we've shown you three articles
[2:37:33.120 --> 2:37:35.120]  today have you just tuned in or a listener
[2:37:35.120 --> 2:37:37.120]  we read the headlines
[2:37:37.120 --> 2:37:39.120]  by the writer on CNN
[2:37:39.120 --> 2:37:41.120]  saying we're liars
[2:37:41.120 --> 2:37:43.120]  that Trump's wrong, that I'm wrong
[2:37:43.120 --> 2:37:45.120]  that they've attacked Larry C. Johnson on the news
[2:37:45.120 --> 2:37:47.120]  saying he's full of crap
[2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:49.120]  so no we're not, we're reading the New York Times
[2:37:49.120 --> 2:37:51.120]  we have memories
[2:37:51.120 --> 2:37:53.120]  so we've got him for another 12 minutes
[2:37:53.120 --> 2:37:55.120]  and I appreciate him joining us, no quarter
[2:37:55.120 --> 2:37:57.120]  USA.net, a lot of amazing information
[2:37:57.120 --> 2:37:59.120]  there, again highly decorated
[2:37:59.120 --> 2:38:01.120]  former member of the CIA, counter-terrorism
[2:38:01.120 --> 2:38:03.120]  or Fox News Analyst, you name it
[2:38:03.120 --> 2:38:05.120]  breaking all this down
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:07.120]  so please continue
[2:38:07.120 --> 2:38:09.120]  with just the waterfront
[2:38:09.120 --> 2:38:11.120]  of what's going on with ISIS, what you see happening
[2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:13.120]  where you see globalism right now
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:15.120]  well what's happened
[2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:17.120]  over the last five weeks
[2:38:17.120 --> 2:38:19.120]  is that
[2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:21.120]  President Trump has lifted
[2:38:21.120 --> 2:38:23.120]  what we're called restricted
[2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:25.120]  air spaces, I think the
[2:38:25.120 --> 2:38:27.120]  military acronym for it is RAS
[2:38:27.120 --> 2:38:29.120]  previously
[2:38:29.120 --> 2:38:31.120]  Obama had imposed
[2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:33.120]  restrictions in certain areas
[2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:35.120]  that no action could be taken
[2:38:35.120 --> 2:38:37.120]  unless he gave approval for a strike
[2:38:37.120 --> 2:38:39.120]  so if we had a drone
[2:38:39.120 --> 2:38:41.120]  operating there
[2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:43.120]  and they observed a convoy
[2:38:43.120 --> 2:38:45.120]  a military convoy of ISIS fighters
[2:38:45.120 --> 2:38:47.120]  or oil convoy
[2:38:47.120 --> 2:38:49.120]  taking oil from an ISIS controlled
[2:38:49.120 --> 2:38:51.120]  oil field
[2:38:51.120 --> 2:38:53.120]  and it was in a restricted area
[2:38:53.120 --> 2:38:55.120]  permission to strike that target
[2:38:55.120 --> 2:38:57.120]  had to go up the chain of command
[2:38:57.120 --> 2:38:59.120]  and made its way to the White House
[2:38:59.120 --> 2:39:01.120]  and literally Barack Obama had to say
[2:39:01.120 --> 2:39:03.120]  yes or no
[2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:05.120]  well practically what happens
[2:39:05.120 --> 2:39:07.120]  is that means you'll never hit one of those targets
[2:39:07.120 --> 2:39:09.120]  but because by the time you jump through all those
[2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:11.120]  hoops the convoy has
[2:39:11.120 --> 2:39:13.120]  long gone
[2:39:13.120 --> 2:39:15.120]  Donald Trump lifted that
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:17.120]  the attacks on those convoys
[2:39:17.120 --> 2:39:19.120]  have been underway over the last five weeks
[2:39:19.120 --> 2:39:21.120]  and there have been significant successes
[2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:23.120]  which are not being reported in the media
[2:39:23.120 --> 2:39:25.120]  the other thing that's going on
[2:39:25.120 --> 2:39:27.120]  that's really fascinating
[2:39:27.120 --> 2:39:29.120]  is that there is regular communication
[2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:31.120]  between the Russian military
[2:39:31.120 --> 2:39:33.120]  and the U.S.
[2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:35.120]  Central Command
[2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:37.120]  in exchanging information
[2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:39.120]  over airspace and troop movements
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:41.120]  why so that we don't have
[2:39:41.120 --> 2:39:43.120]  Russian forces
[2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:45.120]  firing at U.S. forces
[2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:47.120]  and I had Colonel Shaffer on
[2:39:47.120 --> 2:39:49.120]  just two days ago and he said that wasn't being reported
[2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:51.120]  but that is going on
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:53.120]  so recording with the Russians to take out
[2:39:53.120 --> 2:39:55.120]  al-Qaeda and ISIS
[2:39:55.120 --> 2:39:57.120]  I know Assad half way doesn't like it
[2:39:57.120 --> 2:39:59.120]  because he's worried we might not leave
[2:39:59.120 --> 2:40:01.120]  but the truth is, is it Trump fulfilling his promise
[2:40:01.120 --> 2:40:03.120]  to not actually help the quote moderate rebels
[2:40:03.120 --> 2:40:05.120]  who are really al-Nusra al-Qaeda
[2:40:05.120 --> 2:40:07.120]  he's hitting them all, isn't he?
[2:40:07.120 --> 2:40:09.120]  U.S. intelligence community
[2:40:09.120 --> 2:40:11.120]  has known for
[2:40:11.120 --> 2:40:13.120]  at least four years
[2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:15.120]  that the
[2:40:15.120 --> 2:40:17.120]  fighters that were actually fighting in Syria
[2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:19.120]  were not these
[2:40:19.120 --> 2:40:21.120]  non-sectarian
[2:40:21.120 --> 2:40:23.120]  secular
[2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:25.120]  Jeffersonian Democrat types
[2:40:25.120 --> 2:40:27.120]  the ones who were actually out there fighting
[2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:29.120]  and killing and causing mayhem
[2:40:29.120 --> 2:40:31.120]  were the radical Islamists
[2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:33.120]  like al-Nusra, like al-Qaeda, like ISIS
[2:40:33.120 --> 2:40:35.120]  so that's been known
[2:40:35.120 --> 2:40:37.120]  in the intelligence community for at least
[2:40:37.120 --> 2:40:39.120]  four years
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:41.120]  and maybe even a little longer than that
[2:40:41.120 --> 2:40:43.120]  so yet what was criminal in this
[2:40:43.120 --> 2:40:45.120]  is that the United States
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:47.120]  government continued through the CIA
[2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:49.120]  to supply weapons
[2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:51.120]  that were winding up in the hands
[2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:53.120]  of some of these radical Islamists
[2:40:53.120 --> 2:40:55.120]  now why were we doing that?
[2:40:55.120 --> 2:40:57.120]  Well, the desire to get rid of Bashar al-Assad
[2:40:57.120 --> 2:40:59.120]  came
[2:40:59.120 --> 2:41:01.120]  because Saudi Arabia is terrified
[2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:03.120]  of Iran's
[2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:05.120]  rise to power in the Middle East
[2:41:05.120 --> 2:41:07.120]  So it's a Sunni Shiite Civil War
[2:41:07.120 --> 2:41:09.120]  that we've decided with the Wahhabist on
[2:41:09.120 --> 2:41:11.120]  expanding on that, we have former high-level CIA
[2:41:11.120 --> 2:41:13.120]  analysts
[2:41:13.120 --> 2:41:15.120]  in State Department, counter-terrorism
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:17.120]  gentlemen joining us here
[2:41:17.120 --> 2:41:19.120]  to ask you this then, what about
[2:41:19.120 --> 2:41:21.120]  Google banning criticizing Islam?
[2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:23.120]  What about Europe where they won't report the rapes?
[2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:25.120]  I mean, because I used to hear the right wingers
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:27.120]  I'm more of a libertarian, but there's a secret alliance
[2:41:27.120 --> 2:41:29.120]  and Brennan's a Wahhabist
[2:41:29.120 --> 2:41:31.120]  and they're going to have a caliphate
[2:41:31.120 --> 2:41:33.120]  and we're going to have to capitulate to them
[2:41:33.120 --> 2:41:35.120]  and I'm like, okay, nutballs, okay
[2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:37.120]  I don't like radical Islam or orthodox Islam
[2:41:37.120 --> 2:41:39.120]  I get it, but come on, they're actually
[2:41:39.120 --> 2:41:41.120]  right, it's happening
[2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:43.120]  at colleges, the left is teaching it
[2:41:43.120 --> 2:41:45.120]  when about the thousands are putting hijabs on
[2:41:45.120 --> 2:41:47.120]  they're shutting down our free speech
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:49.120]  I mean, it is just the craziest crap
[2:41:49.120 --> 2:41:51.120]  I've ever seen, what's going on there?
[2:41:51.120 --> 2:41:53.120]  I guess one of the saddest things
[2:41:53.120 --> 2:41:55.120]  Alex, over the last really 16 years
[2:41:55.120 --> 2:41:57.120]  since the attacks on 9-11
[2:41:57.120 --> 2:41:59.120]  is that the American public by and large
[2:41:59.120 --> 2:42:01.120]  have not become better informed about
[2:42:01.120 --> 2:42:03.120]  really the nature of the threat
[2:42:03.120 --> 2:42:05.120]  that arises from within Islam
[2:42:05.120 --> 2:42:07.120]  most do not understand the split
[2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:09.120]  between the Sunnis and the Shiites
[2:42:09.120 --> 2:42:11.120]  You know, I still hear today
[2:42:11.120 --> 2:42:13.120]  widely commented
[2:42:13.120 --> 2:42:15.120]  over and over by both Republicans and Democrats
[2:42:15.120 --> 2:42:17.120]  that Iran is the greatest
[2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:19.120]  state sponsor of terror
[2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:21.120]  well, that's simply not true
[2:42:21.120 --> 2:42:23.120]  that was true 20 years ago
[2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:25.120]  but when you look at all the terrorist attacks
[2:42:25.120 --> 2:42:27.120]  that have taken place in the last 15 years
[2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:29.120]  most of them
[2:42:29.120 --> 2:42:31.120]  I mean, 96% of them
[2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:33.120]  are linked to radical Sunnis
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:35.120]  they're opposed to Iran
[2:42:35.120 --> 2:42:37.120]  so is Iran a bad actor?
[2:42:37.120 --> 2:42:39.120]  yeah, Iran's got its problems
[2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:41.120]  I'm not arguing that there's some innocent here
[2:42:41.120 --> 2:42:43.120]  but it doesn't do us any good
[2:42:43.120 --> 2:42:45.120]  in our public discussion
[2:42:45.120 --> 2:42:47.120]  to misinform and actually deceive
[2:42:47.120 --> 2:42:49.120]  the American public
[2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:51.120]  about the true nature of the threat
[2:42:51.120 --> 2:42:53.120]  because candidly
[2:42:53.120 --> 2:42:55.120]  we'll find it much more easy to negotiate with Iran
[2:42:55.120 --> 2:42:57.120]  where women can drive cars
[2:42:57.120 --> 2:42:59.120]  and women can serve in the legislature
[2:42:59.120 --> 2:43:01.120]  and it will with the Saudis
[2:43:01.120 --> 2:43:03.120]  who still live in a 13th century society
[2:43:05.120 --> 2:43:07.120]  but we can't have that discussion
[2:43:07.120 --> 2:43:09.120]  because the Saudis have more oil
[2:43:09.120 --> 2:43:11.120]  than the Iranians at least right now
[2:43:11.120 --> 2:43:13.120]  that affects American interests
[2:43:13.120 --> 2:43:15.120]  but I use that as an example
[2:43:15.120 --> 2:43:17.120]  of the kind of
[2:43:17.120 --> 2:43:19.120]  in the 5-6 minutes we have left
[2:43:19.120 --> 2:43:21.120]  I want to pivot over to the east
[2:43:21.120 --> 2:43:23.120]  and North Korea
[2:43:23.120 --> 2:43:25.120]  this crazy little goblin creature
[2:43:25.120 --> 2:43:27.120]  a third generation dictator
[2:43:27.120 --> 2:43:29.120]  threatening to nuke Japan
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:31.120]  threatening to nuke South Korea and Seoul
[2:43:31.120 --> 2:43:33.120]  and obviously China is manipulating that
[2:43:33.120 --> 2:43:35.120]  from your research, how much control does China have
[2:43:35.120 --> 2:43:37.120]  but I see them so belligerent in the South China Sea
[2:43:37.120 --> 2:43:39.120]  grabbing all these islands
[2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:41.120]  making threats, will nuke America, will kill you
[2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:43.120]  I'm not a guy that wants war
[2:43:43.120 --> 2:43:45.120]  but I mean China
[2:43:45.120 --> 2:43:47.120]  from my research really has never talked like this
[2:43:47.120 --> 2:43:49.120]  and I just wonder
[2:43:49.120 --> 2:43:51.120]  we gave them everything, the Panama Canal
[2:43:51.120 --> 2:43:53.120]  our jobs, they're buying Hollywood
[2:43:53.120 --> 2:43:55.120]  I'm into the communist generals completely delusional
[2:43:55.120 --> 2:43:57.120]  because I think Rex Tillerson and Trump
[2:43:57.120 --> 2:43:59.120]  are going to stand up to him
[2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:01.120]  and now we have Rex Tillerson saying
[2:44:01.120 --> 2:44:03.120]  okay you're threatening us, you're pointing a gun at us
[2:44:03.120 --> 2:44:05.120]  first strike is now on the table
[2:44:05.120 --> 2:44:07.120]  as you said it is, it just seems like an unprecedented escalation
[2:44:07.120 --> 2:44:09.120]  and we never ended the
[2:44:09.120 --> 2:44:11.120]  the war of course as you know
[2:44:11.120 --> 2:44:13.120]  with North Korea, it's just a ceasefire
[2:44:13.120 --> 2:44:15.120]  well you know and we raised this earlier
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:17.120]  let me give you an example
[2:44:17.120 --> 2:44:19.120]  of one simple thing
[2:44:19.120 --> 2:44:21.120]  that the Chinese government has been actively involved with
[2:44:21.120 --> 2:44:23.120]  in the United States
[2:44:23.120 --> 2:44:25.120]  at luxury automobile dealerships
[2:44:25.120 --> 2:44:27.120]  there's something called a straw
[2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:29.120]  buyers program
[2:44:29.120 --> 2:44:31.120]  or a straw leasers program
[2:44:31.120 --> 2:44:33.120]  so what happens is
[2:44:33.120 --> 2:44:35.120]  to stay at home moms
[2:44:35.120 --> 2:44:37.120]  retired people, students
[2:44:37.120 --> 2:44:39.120]  they'll find something in Craigslist
[2:44:39.120 --> 2:44:41.120]  inviting them to come out
[2:44:41.120 --> 2:44:43.120]  to get paid $200 to $1000
[2:44:43.120 --> 2:44:45.120]  to go out and buy an automobile
[2:44:45.120 --> 2:44:47.120]  and or lease an automobile
[2:44:47.120 --> 2:44:49.120]  and they do it in their name
[2:44:49.120 --> 2:44:51.120]  but what happens is they're given a check
[2:44:51.120 --> 2:44:53.120]  a cashier's check
[2:44:53.120 --> 2:44:55.120]  and that cashier's check then goes
[2:44:55.120 --> 2:44:57.120]  to the dealer
[2:44:57.120 --> 2:44:59.120]  and the car comes out of the dealership
[2:44:59.120 --> 2:45:01.120]  they drive it down the road
[2:45:01.120 --> 2:45:03.120]  those cars are being sold
[2:45:03.120 --> 2:45:05.120]  in China
[2:45:05.120 --> 2:45:07.120]  so you know you're talking
[2:45:07.120 --> 2:45:09.120]  all the prominent luxury brands
[2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:11.120]  like Mercedes
[2:45:11.120 --> 2:45:13.120]  and Lexus
[2:45:13.120 --> 2:45:15.120]  and BMW
[2:45:15.120 --> 2:45:17.120]  so you've got all of these going to China
[2:45:17.120 --> 2:45:19.120]  well that's being done with the full knowledge of the Chinese government
[2:45:19.120 --> 2:45:21.120]  and in fact
[2:45:21.120 --> 2:45:23.120]  you're saying they're actually stealing the cars
[2:45:23.120 --> 2:45:25.120]  yeah they're illegally exporting
[2:45:25.120 --> 2:45:27.120]  them to China
[2:45:27.120 --> 2:45:29.120]  but they're doing it with the full knowledge
[2:45:29.120 --> 2:45:31.120]  of the Chinese government
[2:45:31.120 --> 2:45:33.120]  and once they're in China
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:35.120]  then they're being sold
[2:45:35.120 --> 2:45:37.120]  below the price that the other
[2:45:37.120 --> 2:45:39.120]  you know the regular
[2:45:39.120 --> 2:45:41.120]  China just ruthlessly undercuts everything like Ross Perot said
[2:45:41.120 --> 2:45:43.120]  their own people don't get empowered by it
[2:45:43.120 --> 2:45:45.120]  the whole world is sucked down by it
[2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:47.120]  well yeah so they're
[2:45:47.120 --> 2:45:49.120]  the Chinese are very
[2:45:49.120 --> 2:45:51.120]  they're genuinely an organized
[2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:53.120]  criminal enterprise
[2:45:53.120 --> 2:45:55.120]  they're doing it across the board
[2:45:55.120 --> 2:45:57.120]  I know of commodities
[2:45:57.120 --> 2:45:59.120]  states through other countries
[2:45:59.120 --> 2:46:01.120]  oh I mean I don't want to bash China but it's true
[2:46:01.120 --> 2:46:03.120]  the biggest mass murders in history of the communist
[2:46:03.120 --> 2:46:05.120]  they're the ones that reason all the rhinos and stuff are going extinct
[2:46:05.120 --> 2:46:07.120]  they just they won't stop
[2:46:07.120 --> 2:46:09.120]  and by the way of course they've invaded
[2:46:09.120 --> 2:46:11.120]  they have an surplus of 50 million men
[2:46:11.120 --> 2:46:13.120]  because of the one child policy
[2:46:13.120 --> 2:46:15.120]  so they're openly saying go to China
[2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:17.120]  so I've talked to special ops that are all over
[2:46:17.120 --> 2:46:19.120]  Africa they just say there's Chinese troops everywhere
[2:46:19.120 --> 2:46:21.120]  with their African families just it's incredible
[2:46:21.120 --> 2:46:23.120]  so yeah
[2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:25.120]  but with recognizing that China
[2:46:25.120 --> 2:46:27.120]  is a threat
[2:46:27.120 --> 2:46:29.120]  again I think one way to deal with that would be
[2:46:29.120 --> 2:46:31.120]  for us to work with Russia
[2:46:31.120 --> 2:46:33.120]  and trying to isolate China look there's nothing
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:35.120]  to be gained and by the way that's what
[2:46:35.120 --> 2:46:37.120]  General Flynn and the Pentagon want to do
[2:46:37.120 --> 2:46:39.120]  they're not Russian agents it makes sense
[2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:41.120]  China's the big threat Russia isn't
[2:46:41.120 --> 2:46:43.120]  we can Russia wants us to come in and get their natural
[2:46:43.120 --> 2:46:45.120]  resources and develop them why don't
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:47.120]  we do that with Russia
[2:46:47.120 --> 2:46:49.120]  why are there neocons in the leftist why do they
[2:46:49.120 --> 2:46:51.120]  hate Russia so much
[2:46:51.120 --> 2:46:53.120]  well actually I think
[2:46:53.120 --> 2:46:55.120]  one reason driving it
[2:46:55.120 --> 2:46:57.120]  is Russia's anti-homosexual
[2:46:57.120 --> 2:46:59.120]  policy I think
[2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:01.120]  I think that has actually played a major influence
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:03.120]  absolutely I know Hollywood hates anything question
[2:47:03.120 --> 2:47:05.120]  yeah
[2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:07.120]  so it is
[2:47:07.120 --> 2:47:09.120]  I don't think a war with Russia
[2:47:09.120 --> 2:47:11.120]  or with China is in anyone's
[2:47:11.120 --> 2:47:13.120]  interest those kinds of things
[2:47:13.120 --> 2:47:15.120]  have got to be avoided we should not
[2:47:15.120 --> 2:47:17.120]  kid ourselves and those such
[2:47:17.120 --> 2:47:19.120]  that you can have a limited war
[2:47:19.120 --> 2:47:21.120]  well think about that nuclear war with Russia
[2:47:21.120 --> 2:47:23.120]  and the canes pushing because
[2:47:23.120 --> 2:47:25.120]  we won't let western foundations
[2:47:25.120 --> 2:47:27.120]  in that'll teach five-year-olds how to be
[2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:29.120]  gay I mean here's an article right here
[2:47:29.120 --> 2:47:31.120]  number of children wanting to become opposite sex
[2:47:31.120 --> 2:47:33.120]  doubling each year in Sweden
[2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:35.120]  this is being done on purpose declassified
[2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:37.120]  as a population reduction
[2:47:37.120 --> 2:47:39.120]  family destroying mechanism
[2:47:39.120 --> 2:47:41.120]  they've already been through 80 years of communism
[2:47:41.120 --> 2:47:43.120]  thank god Russia's rejecting it
[2:47:43.120 --> 2:47:45.120]  I wonder if the Chinese
[2:47:45.120 --> 2:47:47.120]  are ultimately behind this because
[2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:49.120]  if they get the West to stop reproducing
[2:47:49.120 --> 2:47:51.120]  the Chinese will just outpace us in that regard
[2:47:51.120 --> 2:47:53.120]  and they don't have to fire a shot
[2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:55.120]  well we know the robber barons and the
[2:47:55.120 --> 2:47:57.120]  globalists made deals 40 years ago with
[2:47:57.120 --> 2:47:59.120]  the Chinese we know the CIA bad elements
[2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:01.120]  of it help now get in 1949
[2:48:01.120 --> 2:48:03.120]  and I think there's been a major
[2:48:03.120 --> 2:48:05.120]  long-term alliance
[2:48:05.120 --> 2:48:07.120]  I mean I remember back when I was a little kid
[2:48:07.120 --> 2:48:09.120]  listen to family and people that had been
[2:48:09.120 --> 2:48:11.120]  in the CIA they'd be like oh you watch
[2:48:11.120 --> 2:48:13.120]  we got an alliance with China we're gonna take over all the cheap
[2:48:13.120 --> 2:48:15.120]  goods I remember sitting there thinking we're gonna get double
[2:48:15.120 --> 2:48:17.120]  crossed by that like age four
[2:48:17.120 --> 2:48:19.120]  so there's just I think America bought
[2:48:19.120 --> 2:48:21.120]  into this thing with China
[2:48:21.120 --> 2:48:23.120]  that we'd be military they'd be
[2:48:23.120 --> 2:48:25.120]  products and together we take over
[2:48:25.120 --> 2:48:27.120]  no we're being double crossed
[2:48:27.120 --> 2:48:29.120]  now look I think Alex ultimately
[2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:31.120]  there's a way that reasonable
[2:48:31.120 --> 2:48:33.120]  people can talk we know there's gonna
[2:48:33.120 --> 2:48:35.120]  be differences but what
[2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:37.120]  really alarms me is that if you take
[2:48:37.120 --> 2:48:39.120]  a different point of view if you dare to suggest
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:41.120]  that there might be a way to talk to
[2:48:41.120 --> 2:48:43.120]  Russia all of a sudden you know
[2:48:43.120 --> 2:48:45.120]  you're called a right-wing nut
[2:48:45.120 --> 2:48:47.120]  instead of listening to the substance of your argument
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:49.120]  no worse than that you're called a Russian
[2:48:49.120 --> 2:48:51.120]  agent I mean I mean
[2:48:51.120 --> 2:48:53.120]  he said that that was so crazy
[2:48:53.120 --> 2:48:55.120]  that Senator Paul works
[2:48:55.120 --> 2:48:57.120]  for Putin
[2:48:57.120 --> 2:48:59.120]  right well I remember Adam Schiff the Democrat
[2:48:59.120 --> 2:49:01.120]  leader on the House Intelligence
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:03.120]  Committee called Tucker Carlson
[2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:05.120]  that accused him of carrying water for the Kremlin
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:07.120]  that's right I forgot that well in the
[2:49:07.120 --> 2:49:09.120]  time we have I'm just really appreciate your work
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:11.120]  if you didn't know articles
[2:49:11.120 --> 2:49:13.120]  have been written about it it's confirmed we have the screenshots
[2:49:13.120 --> 2:49:15.120]  where they banned your article
[2:49:15.120 --> 2:49:17.120]  and said it was fake news and spam
[2:49:17.120 --> 2:49:19.120]  other other interesting tidbits you'd like
[2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:21.120]  to impart to the audience because believe me
[2:49:21.120 --> 2:49:23.120]  this interview is going to go viral
[2:49:23.120 --> 2:49:25.120]  well you know ultimately it's the American people
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:27.120]  that are out there in the heartland
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:29.120]  they understand when they're being lied
[2:49:29.120 --> 2:49:31.120]  to they understand
[2:49:31.120 --> 2:49:33.120]  when they're not being told the truth
[2:49:33.120 --> 2:49:35.120]  and I think if we just come together over this
[2:49:35.120 --> 2:49:37.120]  and begin putting pressure on these institutions
[2:49:37.120 --> 2:49:39.120]  that they can eventually come around but
[2:49:39.120 --> 2:49:41.120]  ultimately our representatives
[2:49:41.120 --> 2:49:43.120]  have to hold these people accountable
[2:49:43.120 --> 2:49:45.120]  well I've got your
[2:49:45.120 --> 2:49:47.120]  well I've got your bio here
[2:49:47.120 --> 2:49:49.120]  and it breaks down the fact that you were
[2:49:49.120 --> 2:49:51.120]  over a whole region the chief analyst
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:53.120]  and also one of the top people in counterterrorism
[2:49:53.120 --> 2:49:55.120]  at the State Department so I think you can
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:49:57.120]  look forward just in the last
[2:49:57.120 --> 2:49:59.120]  two minutes look forward Larry C. Johnson
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:01.120]  of noquarterUSA.net
[2:50:01.120 --> 2:50:03.120]  into different lines
[2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:05.120]  of geopolitical developments
[2:50:05.120 --> 2:50:07.120]  I'm not a rocket scientist I can see what's going on
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:09.120]  most analysts say we're in the most dangerous time in our lives
[2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:11.120]  our elites
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:13.120]  most of the Democrats I got to say don't even know
[2:50:13.120 --> 2:50:15.120]  what planet they're on the old republicans don't either
[2:50:15.120 --> 2:50:17.120]  I don't say that arrogantly I mean
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:19.120]  Pelosi and Waters and people
[2:50:19.120 --> 2:50:21.120]  and so does McCain seem unstable
[2:50:21.120 --> 2:50:23.120]  and don't even have basic geography
[2:50:23.120 --> 2:50:25.120]  understanding anymore
[2:50:25.120 --> 2:50:27.120]  and so where do you see this going
[2:50:27.120 --> 2:50:29.120]  what do we do to stop it because
[2:50:29.120 --> 2:50:31.120]  good things are happening nationalism
[2:50:31.120 --> 2:50:33.120]  is expanding people are waking up
[2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:35.120]  people are saying we got to have countries to have our own rights
[2:50:35.120 --> 2:50:37.120]  so what's most positive
[2:50:37.120 --> 2:50:39.120]  versus most negative what do you see coming in the future
[2:50:39.120 --> 2:50:41.120]  on the positive outcome
[2:50:41.120 --> 2:50:43.120]  versus negative outcome with open talk
[2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:45.120]  of world war three
[2:50:45.120 --> 2:50:47.120]  well the positive side is that
[2:50:47.120 --> 2:50:49.120]  the internet is still not under government
[2:50:49.120 --> 2:50:51.120]  control but there's still
[2:50:51.120 --> 2:50:53.120]  information outlets out there that people
[2:50:53.120 --> 2:50:55.120]  do not have to rely upon
[2:50:55.120 --> 2:50:57.120]  the big three networks
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:50:59.120]  or the cable news channels in order to
[2:50:59.120 --> 2:51:01.120]  get their information they can go outside
[2:51:01.120 --> 2:51:03.120]  of that they can go to the source
[2:51:03.120 --> 2:51:05.120]  they can do research I mean
[2:51:05.120 --> 2:51:07.120]  I wish I would have had when I was at
[2:51:07.120 --> 2:51:09.120]  CIA the kind of
[2:51:09.120 --> 2:51:11.120]  investigative power I have now
[2:51:11.120 --> 2:51:13.120]  just standing at my computer at my home
[2:51:13.120 --> 2:51:15.120]  and so there is
[2:51:15.120 --> 2:51:17.120]  there's great power in that information
[2:51:17.120 --> 2:51:19.120]  and to network not just domestically
[2:51:19.120 --> 2:51:21.120]  but internationally because
[2:51:21.120 --> 2:51:23.120]  we're not just talking about here in the United States
[2:51:23.120 --> 2:51:25.120]  there are other people around the world
[2:51:25.120 --> 2:51:27.120]  who don't want to see a war like this
[2:51:27.120 --> 2:51:29.120]  either unfold
[2:51:29.120 --> 2:51:31.120]  and sure you just said something very powerful
[2:51:31.120 --> 2:51:33.120]  I'm sitting there been on air four
[2:51:33.120 --> 2:51:35.120]  five years it's 1997
[2:51:35.120 --> 2:51:37.120]  and I'm talking to an old guy from
[2:51:37.120 --> 2:51:39.120]  Air Force Intelligence who was the deputy
[2:51:39.120 --> 2:51:41.120]  fire chief a friend of mine he goes you need a website Alex
[2:51:41.120 --> 2:51:43.120]  yeah I had like a yahoo news
[2:51:43.120 --> 2:51:45.120]  gripped him for a few years she goes it is called
[2:51:45.120 --> 2:51:47.120]  info war because what you do is an info war
[2:51:47.120 --> 2:51:49.120]  information war go let's go look and see
[2:51:49.120 --> 2:51:51.120]  if the URL is available we look it's there
[2:51:51.120 --> 2:51:53.120]  and I go yeah I've heard of info war and he goes
[2:51:53.120 --> 2:51:55.120]  here you know here's a couple of magazine
[2:51:55.120 --> 2:51:57.120]  articles on info war and he'd been involved
[2:51:57.120 --> 2:51:59.120]  in a bunch of clandestine stuff he was a good
[2:51:59.120 --> 2:52:01.120]  patriot Vic Vreeland and so we launch it
[2:52:01.120 --> 2:52:03.120]  why wouldn't the government even think of
[2:52:03.120 --> 2:52:05.120]  something like that but what you're saying about
[2:52:05.120 --> 2:52:07.120]  with computers with the databases with the
[2:52:07.120 --> 2:52:09.120]  research with human intelligence interfacing
[2:52:09.120 --> 2:52:11.120]  with computers what anybody in the world
[2:52:11.120 --> 2:52:13.120]  can do aware of this stuff can do it more
[2:52:13.120 --> 2:52:15.120]  investigative journalism more research
[2:52:15.120 --> 2:52:17.120]  more action than you could
[2:52:17.120 --> 2:52:19.120]  when you were in the CIA because back then they
[2:52:19.120 --> 2:52:21.120]  were only kind of feeding you intel they wanted
[2:52:21.120 --> 2:52:23.120]  you to have or you had to get your own and kind
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:25.120]  of sussed us out the average person
[2:52:25.120 --> 2:52:27.120]  when they're involved and
[2:52:27.120 --> 2:52:29.120]  and informed and taking action is so
[2:52:29.120 --> 2:52:31.120]  powerful and then I you can criticize
[2:52:31.120 --> 2:52:33.120]  agencies as bad leadership but
[2:52:33.120 --> 2:52:35.120]  the biggest group resisting globalism that
[2:52:35.120 --> 2:52:37.120]  I think helped put Trump in office was
[2:52:37.120 --> 2:52:39.120]  good groups in the intelligence agencies was
[2:52:39.120 --> 2:52:41.120]  the veterans and was corporate moles
[2:52:41.120 --> 2:52:43.120]  and I know a lot of them and they're
[2:52:43.120 --> 2:52:45.120]  ready if the if the globalist puts much
[2:52:45.120 --> 2:52:47.120]  harder they've taken their restraint
[2:52:47.120 --> 2:52:49.120]  as weakness it's not it's more
[2:52:49.120 --> 2:52:51.120]  really wanting to fix things peaceful because
[2:52:51.120 --> 2:52:53.120]  the world's such a powder kick so can you speak
[2:52:53.120 --> 2:52:55.120]  to what you just said briefly by Alex
[2:52:55.120 --> 2:52:57.120]  what we're seeing as well as
[2:52:57.120 --> 2:52:59.120]  on another positive thing is I'm seeing
[2:52:59.120 --> 2:53:01.120]  this it does cross some ideological
[2:53:01.120 --> 2:53:03.120]  divides I myself tend to be
[2:53:03.120 --> 2:53:05.120]  you know like a libertarian
[2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:07.120]  conservative but
[2:53:07.120 --> 2:53:09.120]  I'm sharing views and
[2:53:09.120 --> 2:53:11.120]  and and and the issues
[2:53:11.120 --> 2:53:13.120]  with people like professor Stephen Cohen
[2:53:13.120 --> 2:53:15.120]  of Columbia University who's always
[2:53:15.120 --> 2:53:17.120]  been to you know accused by someone
[2:53:17.120 --> 2:53:19.120]  the right has been a doper
[2:53:19.120 --> 2:53:21.120]  the communists with Daniel Ellsberg
[2:53:21.120 --> 2:53:23.120]  the veterans intelligence
[2:53:23.120 --> 2:53:25.120]  professionals for sanity
[2:53:25.120 --> 2:53:27.120]  a variety of analysts some include
[2:53:27.120 --> 2:53:29.120]  whistleblowers from the NSA
[2:53:29.120 --> 2:53:31.120]  like Bill Benny and Thomas Drake
[2:53:31.120 --> 2:53:33.120]  and Kurt Beebe and Ed Loomis
[2:53:33.120 --> 2:53:35.120]  and so we cover a
[2:53:35.120 --> 2:53:37.120]  really quite a spectrum on the
[2:53:37.120 --> 2:53:39.120]  if you look at all those lists
[2:53:39.120 --> 2:53:41.120]  those were all game changers helped bring down
[2:53:41.120 --> 2:53:43.120]  the Soviet Union masterminds like
[2:53:43.120 --> 2:53:45.120]  Bill Benny and Drake and others
[2:53:45.120 --> 2:53:47.120]  then getting demonized as doops
[2:53:47.120 --> 2:53:49.120]  by Russia when they helped crush the
[2:53:49.120 --> 2:53:51.120]  communists right so it's a
[2:53:51.120 --> 2:53:53.120]  recognition that this is not a traditional
[2:53:53.120 --> 2:53:55.120]  right-left issue right or wrong
[2:53:55.120 --> 2:53:57.120]  this goes back to the more fundamental
[2:53:57.120 --> 2:53:59.120]  issue that look we're a republic
[2:53:59.120 --> 2:54:01.120]  the government should have some
[2:54:01.120 --> 2:54:03.120]  limits on what it can do to an individual
[2:54:03.120 --> 2:54:05.120]  the government should have no power to
[2:54:05.120 --> 2:54:07.120]  invade your privacy and come into your home
[2:54:07.120 --> 2:54:09.120]  without a warrant without having a good
[2:54:09.120 --> 2:54:11.120]  reason and right now as it's
[2:54:11.120 --> 2:54:13.120]  been uncovered in the last several weeks with
[2:54:13.120 --> 2:54:15.120]  the latest WikiLeaks
[2:54:15.120 --> 2:54:17.120]  revelations we're seeing
[2:54:17.120 --> 2:54:19.120]  that in fact the CIA does
[2:54:19.120 --> 2:54:21.120]  have that power and that power
[2:54:21.120 --> 2:54:23.120]  has probably been used
[2:54:23.120 --> 2:54:25.120]  sure well I don't know if they're going to
[2:54:25.120 --> 2:54:27.120]  be successful bullying Trump's people into
[2:54:27.120 --> 2:54:29.120]  apologizing for the sky being blue but Larry
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:31.120]  see Johnson no quarter USA.net
[2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:33.120]  please come back soon a lot of really
[2:54:33.120 --> 2:54:35.120]  informative information thank you so much
[2:54:35.120 --> 2:54:37.120]  thank you Alex appreciate it
[2:54:37.120 --> 2:54:39.120]  if you look at the geopolitical
[2:54:39.120 --> 2:54:41.120]  angles for this country the best thing to do
[2:54:41.120 --> 2:54:43.120]  is to have a deal with Russia they want
[2:54:43.120 --> 2:54:45.120]  our corporations and people to come
[2:54:45.120 --> 2:54:47.120]  in they have more resources than any other
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:49.120]  continent we need to go
[2:54:49.120 --> 2:54:51.120]  into Russia they're
[2:54:51.120 --> 2:54:53.120]  nationalistic they're right-wing now
[2:54:53.120 --> 2:54:55.120]  they're becoming more Christian
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:54:57.120]  imagine after 80 years of communism
[2:54:57.120 --> 2:54:59.120]  wouldn't you be hungry for that like a man in the desert
[2:54:59.120 --> 2:55:01.120]  for three days without water and it's
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:03.120]  real folks and that's why the globalists are so pissed
[2:55:03.120 --> 2:55:05.120]  is what they've done to Russia
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:07.120]  they now want to do to us but they but the big giant
[2:55:07.120 --> 2:55:09.120]  squid that's the new order
[2:55:09.120 --> 2:55:11.120]  it lost control of Russia does that mean
[2:55:11.120 --> 2:55:13.120]  Putin didn't a strong man has to fight all these
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:15.120]  mafias and crack heads and of course
[2:55:15.120 --> 2:55:17.120]  but he's not out to poison kids with
[2:55:17.120 --> 2:55:19.120]  fluoride
[2:55:19.120 --> 2:55:21.120]  or teach seven-year-olds how to give a blow job
[2:55:21.120 --> 2:55:23.120]  and I'm sorry to talk like that that's what the liberals want to do
[2:55:23.120 --> 2:55:25.120]  they want to sexualize your kids there are
[2:55:25.120 --> 2:55:27.120]  a bunch of pedophiles I mean
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:29.120]  that's what it is folks and and it's disgusting
[2:55:31.120 --> 2:55:33.120]  and we're facing and battling a pedophile army
[2:55:33.120 --> 2:55:35.120]  I mean that's the bottom line I met with
[2:55:35.120 --> 2:55:37.120]  all sorts of people
[2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:39.120]  this high level as you get I mean
[2:55:39.120 --> 2:55:41.120]  this is a total rebellion right now
[2:55:41.120 --> 2:55:43.120]  there's a rebellion against Trump in America
[2:55:43.120 --> 2:55:45.120]  in the store other republics so people inside
[2:55:45.120 --> 2:55:47.120]  the government just we're done
[2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:49.120]  being intimidated by all the mid-level people that are traders
[2:55:49.120 --> 2:55:51.120]  telling us we can't stand up
[2:55:51.120 --> 2:55:53.120]  and I'm just going to tell you right now they hit the threat
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:55.120]  people know that you better have your internet
[2:55:55.120 --> 2:55:57.120]  kill switch ready because
[2:55:57.120 --> 2:55:59.120]  people keep pushing everything's going to get released
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:01.120]  no matter how damaging it is just like North Korea
[2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:03.120]  you want to sit there
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:05.120]  and you want to threaten to nuke everybody
[2:56:05.120 --> 2:56:07.120]  and you're going to load the missiles up with everything
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:09.120]  they're going to be blown up on the tarmac
[2:56:09.120 --> 2:56:11.120]  and if you start moving again we're going to nuke you
[2:56:11.120 --> 2:56:13.120]  and we're not asking for this you know what
[2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:15.120]  at a certain point
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:17.120]  China is right in checks
[2:56:17.120 --> 2:56:19.120]  they can't cash
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:21.120]  because we've put up with their crap so long
[2:56:21.120 --> 2:56:23.120]  put up with them killing 100
[2:56:23.120 --> 2:56:25.120]  million of their own people it's disgusting
[2:56:25.120 --> 2:56:27.120]  because the Rockefeller foundation
[2:56:27.120 --> 2:56:29.120]  the Cardigans and others
[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:31.120]  wanted communism in China
[2:56:31.120 --> 2:56:33.120]  they were scared to death of it being free market
[2:56:33.120 --> 2:56:35.120]  and having a good system
[2:56:35.120 --> 2:56:37.120]  with the great hard work in Chinese people so instead it's a bunch of commies
[2:56:37.120 --> 2:56:39.120]  running them as slaves
[2:56:39.120 --> 2:56:41.120]  and they've deployed them to be aggressively nationalistic
[2:56:41.120 --> 2:56:43.120]  it's anybody else
[2:56:43.120 --> 2:56:45.120]  and to screw everybody else and not buy anything America
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:47.120]  and just rob everything
[2:56:47.120 --> 2:56:49.120]  and they have run us into the ground
[2:56:49.120 --> 2:56:51.120]  and turned us into slaves
[2:56:51.120 --> 2:56:53.120]  and they're buying up our media and it's the Chinese
[2:56:53.120 --> 2:56:55.120]  are up are you know what
[2:56:55.120 --> 2:56:57.120]  they are all over us
[2:56:57.120 --> 2:56:59.120]  and it's time to stop acting like a bunch of chumps
[2:56:59.120 --> 2:57:01.120]  oh don't be racist
[2:57:01.120 --> 2:57:03.120]  10,000 Chinese women
[2:57:03.120 --> 2:57:05.120]  come a week CNN to have their babies for free
[2:57:05.120 --> 2:57:07.120]  outpacing all Mexicans
[2:57:07.120 --> 2:57:09.120]  that come to the country
[2:57:09.120 --> 2:57:11.120]  I love Mexicans
[2:57:11.120 --> 2:57:13.120]  but when everything's collapsing I don't want to be Guadalajara
[2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:15.120]  and pay for everything
[2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:17.120]  nothing against Chinese people
[2:57:17.120 --> 2:57:19.120]  but man stand up yourself
[2:57:19.120 --> 2:57:21.120]  you know over there and all the tyranny

[2:57:23.120 --> 2:57:25.120]  I'm done
[2:57:25.120 --> 2:57:27.120]  I mean I've got a little bit of money and it's hard to pay the bills
[2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:29.120]  I can't imagine what it's like for the general public
[2:57:29.120 --> 2:57:31.120]  this country's falling apart
[2:57:33.120 --> 2:57:35.120]  anyways

[2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:47.120]  you don't just think that's only happening right
[2:57:47.120 --> 2:57:49.120]  I'm not going to get into it
[2:57:49.120 --> 2:57:51.120]  I'm not going to give it any attention

[2:59:37.120 --> 2:59:39.120]  or of the highest quality lab standard
[2:59:39.120 --> 2:59:41.120]  that means it's clean
[2:59:41.120 --> 2:59:43.120]  that means it's pure
[2:59:43.120 --> 2:59:45.120]  and rest secured you're finding the tip of the spear
[2:59:45.120 --> 2:59:47.120]  in the M4sLive.com
[2:59:47.120 --> 2:59:49.120]  and vitamin mineral fusion
[2:59:49.120 --> 2:59:51.120]  take action now before we sell out
[2:59:51.120 --> 3:00:15.120]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:00:15.120 --> 3:00:17.120]  from the front lines
[3:00:17.120 --> 3:00:23.120]  of the information war it's Alex Jones
[3:00:23.120 --> 3:00:25.120]  it's imperative
[3:00:25.120 --> 3:00:27.120]  Lee and Mac are coming in to take over the fourth hour
[3:00:27.120 --> 3:00:29.120]  they're all wound up ready to go
[3:00:29.120 --> 3:00:31.120]  that you know as a listener
[3:00:31.120 --> 3:00:33.120]  you've seen the enemy attack us
[3:00:33.120 --> 3:00:37.120]  every day the lies intensifying
[3:00:37.120 --> 3:00:39.120]  you've seen the economic warfare
[3:00:39.120 --> 3:00:41.120]  you've seen them trying to destroy Donald Trump
[3:00:41.120 --> 3:00:43.120]  his family and his companies
[3:00:43.120 --> 3:00:45.120]  he lost the word is
[3:00:45.120 --> 3:00:47.120]  a hero
[3:00:47.120 --> 3:00:49.120]  going up against the most evil people
[3:00:49.120 --> 3:00:51.120]  conferring with the top experts
[3:00:51.120 --> 3:00:53.120]  going with what's best for America
[3:00:53.120 --> 3:00:55.120]  and best for humanity
[3:00:55.120 --> 3:00:57.120]  isn't executing perfectly who could
[3:00:57.120 --> 3:00:59.120]  I saw a video today
[3:00:59.120 --> 3:01:01.120]  maybe you guys in short notice can pull it up
[3:01:01.120 --> 3:01:03.120]  like mudslide somewhere in South America
[3:01:03.120 --> 3:01:05.120]  and the woman is like falling around
[3:01:05.120 --> 3:01:07.120]  these boards and all these wrecked houses
[3:01:07.120 --> 3:01:09.120]  and struggling trying to get out
[3:01:09.120 --> 3:01:11.120]  and everybody's cheering for it
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:13.120]  that's what it's like for Trump
[3:01:13.120 --> 3:01:15.120]  he's like on a mudslide
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:17.120]  all these boards in this log jam trying to
[3:01:17.120 --> 3:01:19.120]  get the country balanced while all these enemies
[3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:21.120]  hit him from every sickening angle
[3:01:23.120 --> 3:01:25.120]  now he's doing it in a suit with a great looking wife
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:27.120]  and you know great family
[3:01:27.120 --> 3:01:29.120]  smart wife great family Christian family
[3:01:29.120 --> 3:01:31.120]  but I mean this is what America's like right now
[3:01:31.120 --> 3:01:33.120]  we are just trying to get out of this thing
[3:01:33.120 --> 3:01:35.120]  we're getting hit by all these people
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:37.120]  that are cowards
[3:01:37.120 --> 3:01:39.120]  most folks don't even get power out of this system
[3:01:39.120 --> 3:01:41.120]  they just tune into the power
[3:01:41.120 --> 3:01:43.120]  like some bandwagon group
[3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:45.120]  that you know
[3:01:45.120 --> 3:01:47.120]  they say they sell like 10 times more shirts
[3:01:47.120 --> 3:01:49.120]  once a team's going to go to the Superbowl or whatever
[3:01:49.120 --> 3:01:51.120]  all these bandwagoners
[3:01:51.120 --> 3:01:53.120]  want to be associated with a winning team
[3:01:53.120 --> 3:01:55.120]  who cares about a winning team
[3:01:55.120 --> 3:01:57.120]  how does that affect you unless you own stock
[3:01:57.120 --> 3:01:59.120]  in it or whatever
[3:01:59.120 --> 3:02:01.120]  unless your family plays on the team
[3:02:01.120 --> 3:02:03.120]  this is real folks
[3:02:05.120 --> 3:02:07.120]  and I spend less than I used to because I'm so busy
[3:02:07.120 --> 3:02:09.120]  good 4 or 5 hours a day
[3:02:09.120 --> 3:02:11.120]  reading news clips
[3:02:11.120 --> 3:02:13.120]  I used to be like 10 hours a day
[3:02:13.120 --> 3:02:15.120]  I spend more time with my kids now
[3:02:15.120 --> 3:02:17.120]  they just got to have me
[3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:19.120]  and I already know too much quite frankly
[3:02:19.120 --> 3:02:21.120]  I mean it's just
[3:02:21.120 --> 3:02:23.120]  it's too upsetting
[3:02:23.120 --> 3:02:25.120]  because I know this is real
[3:02:25.120 --> 3:02:27.120]  I know this fight's real
[3:02:27.120 --> 3:02:29.120]  I know we're real
[3:02:29.120 --> 3:02:31.120]  I know what it means if we lose
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:35.120]  I look at Kim Jong Un
[3:02:35.120 --> 3:02:37.120]  all these scumbags running around threatening everybody
[3:02:37.120 --> 3:02:39.120]  other person in other communist government
[3:02:39.120 --> 3:02:41.120]  with the left worshiping them
[3:02:41.120 --> 3:02:43.120]  and all their crap
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:45.120]  and all the trendies
[3:02:45.120 --> 3:02:47.120]  who are raised in an open free country
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:49.120]  and have no respect for it
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:51.120]  no appreciation
[3:02:51.120 --> 3:02:53.120]  and want to pull down everything strong and honorable
[3:02:53.120 --> 3:02:55.120]  because
[3:02:55.120 --> 3:02:57.120]  they're just miserable people
[3:02:59.120 --> 3:03:01.120]  but make no mistake
[3:03:01.120 --> 3:03:03.120]  the main fight for
[3:03:03.120 --> 3:03:05.120]  this republic
[3:03:05.120 --> 3:03:07.120]  is happening now
[3:03:09.120 --> 3:03:11.120]  and every actuary, every analysis
[3:03:11.120 --> 3:03:13.120]  has been done
[3:03:13.120 --> 3:03:15.120]  and what Hillary Clinton wants
[3:03:15.120 --> 3:03:17.120]  and what John McCain wants
[3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:19.120]  and what all these cowards
[3:03:19.120 --> 3:03:21.120]  at CNN and MSNBC
[3:03:21.120 --> 3:03:23.120]  and all these want to be tough guys
[3:03:23.120 --> 3:03:25.120]  what
[3:03:25.120 --> 3:03:27.120]  is to see everybody collapse
[3:03:27.120 --> 3:03:29.120]  and be poor so they can secure their dominance over us
[3:03:29.120 --> 3:03:31.120]  because there's such cowardly pieces of crap
[3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:33.120]  but I like George Washington
[3:03:33.120 --> 3:03:35.120]  that
[3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:37.120]  led a ragtag force to the first victory against the British Empire
[3:03:39.120 --> 3:03:41.120]  one of the first and only
[3:03:43.120 --> 3:03:45.120]  and then went on to be president
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:47.120]  and build the nation
[3:03:47.120 --> 3:03:49.120]  and then leave and wanted to make him the king
[3:03:53.120 --> 3:03:55.120]  but it's fitting that America on its deathbed
[3:03:55.120 --> 3:03:57.120]  2016
[3:03:57.120 --> 3:03:59.120]  that's America on its deathbed
[3:03:59.120 --> 3:04:01.120]  and we're going to describe it that year
[3:04:01.120 --> 3:04:03.120]  like we were in cardiac arrest or heart wasn't beating
[3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:05.120]  and Donald Trump in the liberty movement were the defibrillators
[3:04:05.120 --> 3:04:07.120]  it's going to be brutal and going to feel good
[3:04:07.120 --> 3:04:09.120]  might not even get them on perfectly right
[3:04:09.120 --> 3:04:11.120]  but we're trying to get them in there
[3:04:11.120 --> 3:04:13.120]  and get the country going and ignite
[3:04:13.120 --> 3:04:15.120]  the heart and to chop the crime in the black neighborhoods
[3:04:15.120 --> 3:04:17.120]  so folks aren't killing themselves
[3:04:17.120 --> 3:04:19.120]  and that's racist and try to get jobs
[3:04:19.120 --> 3:04:21.120]  and to pour people across the country
[3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:23.120]  and try to cut off these globalist programs
[3:04:23.120 --> 3:04:25.120]  that have shut us down
[3:04:25.120 --> 3:04:27.120]  and I see all these crappy people attacking Trump
[3:04:27.120 --> 3:04:29.120]  and us and everybody
[3:04:29.120 --> 3:04:31.120]  I don't even hate them anymore
[3:04:31.120 --> 3:04:33.120]  I think what type of scumbag like Bow Wow
[3:04:33.120 --> 3:04:35.120]  says how dare you not like me saying
[3:04:35.120 --> 3:04:37.120]  I'm going to kill you or my uncle
[3:04:37.120 --> 3:04:39.120]  I'm going to kidnap and put your wife in sex slavery
[3:04:39.120 --> 3:04:41.120]  it's like who the hell are these people
[3:04:41.120 --> 3:04:43.120]  what's their problem
[3:04:43.120 --> 3:04:45.120]  I just know this they're not going to beat us
[3:04:45.120 --> 3:04:47.120]  so let's pray to God to lead God into reckless and take action
[3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:49.120]  because we're already starting to turn the planet around
[3:04:49.120 --> 3:04:51.120]  but the enemy's going to fight back
[3:04:51.120 --> 3:04:53.120]  just know this the fight's just begun
[3:04:53.120 --> 3:04:55.120]  and we need your prayers and support now
[3:04:55.120 --> 3:04:57.120]  and more than ever
[3:04:57.120 --> 3:04:59.120]  because we are the resistance to the global tyranny
[3:04:59.120 --> 3:05:01.120]  you are the resistance
[3:05:01.120 --> 3:05:05.120]  this is Millie Weaver reporting for Infowars.com
[3:05:05.120 --> 3:05:07.120]  the official McDonald's Twitter account
[3:05:07.120 --> 3:05:09.120]  tweeted out an anti-Trump tweet
[3:05:09.120 --> 3:05:11.120]  which caused a huge stir on Twitter
[3:05:11.120 --> 3:05:13.120]  which some speculate
[3:05:13.120 --> 3:05:15.120]  may not have been an accident at all
[3:05:15.120 --> 3:05:17.120]  the tweet said
[3:05:17.120 --> 3:05:19.120]  you are actually a disgusting excuse
[3:05:19.120 --> 3:05:21.120]  of a president
[3:05:21.120 --> 3:05:23.120]  and we would love to have Barack Obama back
[3:05:23.120 --> 3:05:25.120]  also you have tiny hands
[3:05:25.120 --> 3:05:27.120]  now McDonald's claims
[3:05:27.120 --> 3:05:29.120]  that it was the result of a hacker
[3:05:29.120 --> 3:05:31.120]  but some have pointed the finger at Robert Gibbs
[3:05:31.120 --> 3:05:33.120]  Obama's former press secretary
[3:05:33.120 --> 3:05:35.120]  who now works as the global chief officer
[3:05:35.120 --> 3:05:37.120]  for McDonald's
[3:05:37.120 --> 3:05:39.120]  well there's no proof that it was Robert Gibbs
[3:05:39.120 --> 3:05:41.120]  however I would say
[3:05:41.120 --> 3:05:43.120]  that Robert Gibbs is a perfect fit
[3:05:43.120 --> 3:05:45.120]  for McDonald's
[3:05:45.120 --> 3:05:47.120]  given that his job was to make Obama look good
[3:05:47.120 --> 3:05:49.120]  well I'm sure he'll have no problem
[3:05:49.120 --> 3:05:51.120]  making the McDonald's
[3:05:51.120 --> 3:05:53.120]  chicken fake nuggets
[3:05:53.120 --> 3:05:55.120]  look good as well
[3:05:55.120 --> 3:06:21.120]  here was the mighty nation
[3:06:21.120 --> 3:06:25.120]  I think it ain't gonna sit well down my way at all
[3:06:25.120 --> 3:06:27.120]  do you ever wonder what happened to America
[3:06:27.120 --> 3:06:29.120]  they lost
[3:06:29.120 --> 3:06:31.120]  we won
[3:06:31.120 --> 3:06:33.120]  wanna see what drums up against
[3:06:33.120 --> 3:06:35.120]  it's time to ride boys
[3:06:35.120 --> 3:06:37.120]  when I was a boy
[3:06:37.120 --> 3:06:39.120]  it was okay to be proud of the flag
[3:06:39.120 --> 3:06:41.120]  heritage, mom and apple pie
[3:06:41.120 --> 3:06:43.120]  and beef

[3:08:33.120 --> 3:08:35.120]  look at the Irish here, I got a little bit of Irish in me
[3:08:35.120 --> 3:08:37.120]  and a lot of the folks around here
[3:08:37.120 --> 3:08:39.120]  have quite a bit like Derek Green
[3:08:39.120 --> 3:08:41.120]  we should probably hear from him today
[3:08:41.120 --> 3:08:43.120]  but I probably should have warned some green
[3:08:43.120 --> 3:08:45.120]  I think I probably will tonight
[3:08:45.120 --> 3:08:47.120]  and have some corned beef and stuff like that
[3:08:47.120 --> 3:08:49.120]  over at the house and some beer
[3:08:49.120 --> 3:08:51.120]  some Guinness but seriously
[3:08:51.120 --> 3:08:53.120]  you can't have nationalism, you can't have culture
[3:08:53.120 --> 3:08:55.120]  and so I guess that's why one of our reporters is out there
[3:08:55.120 --> 3:08:57.120]  some news agencies are saying
[3:08:57.120 --> 3:08:59.120]  they're afraid because it's white nationalist
[3:08:59.120 --> 3:09:01.120]  that's right, this is all part of the culture wars
[3:09:01.120 --> 3:09:03.120]  going on, so
[3:09:03.120 --> 3:09:05.120]  I say BS to all that
[3:09:05.120 --> 3:09:07.120]  the globalists just want to ban everything
[3:09:07.120 --> 3:09:09.120]  white boards are being banned because you can
[3:09:09.120 --> 3:09:11.120]  write on them and ban the books
[3:09:11.120 --> 3:09:13.120]  this is the authoritarianism
[3:09:13.120 --> 3:09:15.120]  we're facing what the good news is
[3:09:15.120 --> 3:09:17.120]  they're losing on every front
[3:09:17.120 --> 3:09:19.120]  so back to Owen Schreuer and Leanne McHugh
[3:09:19.120 --> 3:09:21.120]  with the main studio
[3:09:21.120 --> 3:09:23.120]  you know, thank you Alex
[3:09:23.120 --> 3:09:25.120]  and happy saint patrick's day to you Alex
[3:09:25.120 --> 3:09:27.120]  all over the United States, I know the saint patrick's day
[3:09:27.120 --> 3:09:29.120]  parades are going on, everyone's having a good time
[3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:31.120]  but you know, it's funny that he mentions that
[3:09:31.120 --> 3:09:33.120]  right there about how the
[3:09:33.120 --> 3:09:35.120]  you've got liberal media, liberal people on social media
[3:09:35.120 --> 3:09:37.120]  complaining about saint patrick's day
[3:09:37.120 --> 3:09:39.120]  being white nationalism
[3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:41.120]  I think I just realized something
[3:09:41.120 --> 3:09:43.120]  so the whole goal of the new world
[3:09:43.120 --> 3:09:45.120]  order in the United States has been
[3:09:45.120 --> 3:09:47.120]  or at least as far, because you know how they like
[3:09:47.120 --> 3:09:49.120]  to divide based on identity
[3:09:49.120 --> 3:09:51.120]  so they tried to indoctrinate
[3:09:51.120 --> 3:09:53.120]  the black youth into the gang
[3:09:53.120 --> 3:09:55.120]  culture with people like Snoop Dogg
[3:09:55.120 --> 3:09:57.120]  with people like Lil Bow Wow Sham Moss
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:09:59.120]  so now it looks like what they're trying
[3:09:59.120 --> 3:10:01.120]  to do with white people
[3:10:01.120 --> 3:10:03.120]  is indoctrinate them into this guilt trip
[3:10:03.120 --> 3:10:05.120]  where no matter what you do
[3:10:05.120 --> 3:10:07.120]  no matter what culture it is you're celebrating
[3:10:07.120 --> 3:10:09.120]  if there's anything to do with
[3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:11.120]  white or European relations
[3:10:11.120 --> 3:10:13.120]  it's racist, it's white nationalist
[3:10:13.120 --> 3:10:15.120]  and you can't have it
[3:10:15.120 --> 3:10:17.120]  you're not allowed to have your culture, your history
[3:10:17.120 --> 3:10:19.120]  you can't have your black eyed peas on saint patrick's day
[3:10:19.120 --> 3:10:21.120]  or new year's eve for good luck
[3:10:21.120 --> 3:10:23.120]  just look like this
[3:10:23.120 --> 3:10:25.120]  just look like our old friend here
[3:10:25.120 --> 3:10:27.120]  so that you don't offend anyone
[3:10:27.120 --> 3:10:29.120]  this is how the globalist would like to have us anyway
[3:10:29.120 --> 3:10:31.120]  and alex was actually very serious
[3:10:31.120 --> 3:10:33.120]  when he left the studio before we started talking about saint patrick's day
[3:10:33.120 --> 3:10:35.120]  about everything that's going on with north korea
[3:10:35.120 --> 3:10:37.120]  and actually this is in the korean herald
[3:10:37.120 --> 3:10:39.120]  I don't know if you guys have this back there
[3:10:39.120 --> 3:10:41.120]  if you can pull up the dockham
[3:10:41.120 --> 3:10:43.120]  or you can just pull this up
[3:10:43.120 --> 3:10:45.120]  this is from the korean herald
[3:10:45.120 --> 3:10:47.120]  us says strategic patience
[3:10:47.120 --> 3:10:49.120]  on north korea is over
[3:10:49.120 --> 3:10:51.120]  from tillerson if you guys want to let me know when that's ready
[3:10:51.120 --> 3:10:53.120]  we can just roll that again
[3:10:53.120 --> 3:10:55.120]  okay so we're going to play that clip
[3:10:55.120 --> 3:10:57.120]  but basically it's interesting to see
[3:10:57.120 --> 3:10:59.120]  how trump
[3:10:59.120 --> 3:11:01.120]  is handling north korea differently than obama
[3:11:01.120 --> 3:11:03.120]  obama is like a bowl of soft serve ice cream
[3:11:03.120 --> 3:11:05.120]  you can just mash him right down
[3:11:05.120 --> 3:11:07.120]  north korea
[3:11:07.120 --> 3:11:09.120]  has been saying
[3:11:09.120 --> 3:11:11.120]  threatening things to the united states for a long time now
[3:11:11.120 --> 3:11:13.120]  it pretty much goes unanswered
[3:11:13.120 --> 3:11:15.120]  and now that they're saying things
[3:11:15.120 --> 3:11:17.120]  all of a sudden the joint annual drill
[3:11:17.120 --> 3:11:19.120]  with south korea is an annual thing
[3:11:19.120 --> 3:11:21.120]  so that wasn't necessarily
[3:11:21.120 --> 3:11:23.120]  in a response to
[3:11:23.120 --> 3:11:25.120]  kim jong-un saying that he's going to
[3:11:25.120 --> 3:11:27.120]  mercilessly attack the united states and other rhetoric
[3:11:27.120 --> 3:11:29.120]  but they also held drills
[3:11:29.120 --> 3:11:31.120]  in a jungle in hawaii
[3:11:31.120 --> 3:11:33.120]  for the first time in a long time maybe even decades
[3:11:33.120 --> 3:11:35.120]  so they're getting the army ready
[3:11:35.120 --> 3:11:37.120]  again for jungle
[3:11:37.120 --> 3:11:39.120]  preparedness war style
[3:11:39.120 --> 3:11:41.120]  let's go to this clip from rex tillerson
[3:11:41.120 --> 3:11:43.120]  in the face of north korea's
[3:11:43.120 --> 3:11:45.120]  grave and escalating global threat
[3:11:45.120 --> 3:11:47.120]  it is important for me to consult with our friends
[3:11:47.120 --> 3:11:49.120]  and chart a path
[3:11:49.120 --> 3:11:51.120]  that secures the peace
[3:11:51.120 --> 3:11:53.120]  let me be very clear
[3:11:53.120 --> 3:11:55.120]  the policy of strategic patience
[3:11:55.120 --> 3:11:57.120]  has ended
[3:11:57.120 --> 3:11:59.120]  we're exploring a new range of diplomatic
[3:11:59.120 --> 3:12:01.120]  security
[3:12:01.120 --> 3:12:03.120]  and economic measures
[3:12:03.120 --> 3:12:05.120]  all options are on the table
[3:12:05.120 --> 3:12:07.120]  north korea must understand
[3:12:07.120 --> 3:12:09.120]  that the only path to a secure
[3:12:09.120 --> 3:12:11.120]  economically prosperous future
[3:12:11.120 --> 3:12:13.120]  is to abandon its development
[3:12:13.120 --> 3:12:15.120]  of nuclear weapons
[3:12:15.120 --> 3:12:17.120]  ballistic missiles
[3:12:17.120 --> 3:12:19.120]  and other weapons of mass destruction
[3:12:19.120 --> 3:12:21.120]  it's just so incredible
[3:12:21.120 --> 3:12:23.120]  unprecedented times we're living in
[3:12:23.120 --> 3:12:25.120]  and i think it's important for everyone to sort of pay attention
[3:12:25.120 --> 3:12:27.120]  to what is happening right now
[3:12:27.120 --> 3:12:29.120]  with north korea
[3:12:29.120 --> 3:12:31.120]  and just where we're at and how they didn't
[3:12:31.120 --> 3:12:33.120]  abide by the nuclear agreement
[3:12:33.120 --> 3:12:35.120]  so you can kind of flashback it was bill clinton
[3:12:35.120 --> 3:12:37.120]  who actually gave
[3:12:37.120 --> 3:12:39.120]  north korea their nuclear technology
[3:12:39.120 --> 3:12:41.120]  and he
[3:12:41.120 --> 3:12:43.120]  and the chinese too
[3:12:43.120 --> 3:12:45.120]  there's video with bill clinton talking
[3:12:45.120 --> 3:12:47.120]  about this deal
[3:12:47.120 --> 3:12:49.120]  is going to make america safer
[3:12:49.120 --> 3:12:51.120]  it's going to be a good deal
[3:12:51.120 --> 3:12:53.120]  it'll stop them from being able to acquire
[3:12:53.120 --> 3:12:55.120]  nuclear weapons
[3:12:55.120 --> 3:12:57.120]  we'll be able to go in and investigate
[3:12:57.120 --> 3:12:59.120]  and it's almost verbatim
[3:12:59.120 --> 3:13:01.120]  the exact rhetoric that obama
[3:13:01.120 --> 3:13:03.120]  used when he herald
[3:13:03.120 --> 3:13:05.120]  the good deal with iran
[3:13:05.120 --> 3:13:07.120]  the same thing is going to keep us safe
[3:13:07.120 --> 3:13:09.120]  it'll stop them from acquiring nuclear weapons
[3:13:09.120 --> 3:13:11.120]  they'll allow us to come in
[3:13:11.120 --> 3:13:13.120]  and inspect the technology
[3:13:13.120 --> 3:13:15.120]  so we're basically going to see history repeat itself
[3:13:15.120 --> 3:13:17.120]  with what's going on with north korea
[3:13:17.120 --> 3:13:19.120]  you don't give people nuclear technology
[3:13:19.120 --> 3:13:21.120]  that
[3:13:21.120 --> 3:13:23.120]  raise their children on
[3:13:23.120 --> 3:13:25.120]  death to america and things like that
[3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:27.120]  so basically what we're seeing going on now with north korea
[3:13:27.120 --> 3:13:29.120]  and kind of ramping up
[3:13:29.120 --> 3:13:31.120]  for all options
[3:13:31.120 --> 3:13:33.120]  on the table here we might be seeing this even in the future
[3:13:33.120 --> 3:13:35.120]  with iran
[3:13:35.120 --> 3:13:37.120]  well and it's funny too because
[3:13:37.120 --> 3:13:39.120]  just over a year ago
[3:13:39.120 --> 3:13:41.120]  where the leader of iran
[3:13:41.120 --> 3:13:43.120]  said that iran is going to have a new
[3:13:43.120 --> 3:13:45.120]  designation in the new world order
[3:13:45.120 --> 3:13:47.120]  this was right before the deal
[3:13:47.120 --> 3:13:49.120]  that barack obama made with
[3:13:49.120 --> 3:13:51.120]  iran that sent them cash
[3:13:51.120 --> 3:13:53.120]  cash
[3:13:53.120 --> 3:13:55.120]  sent to iran
[3:13:55.120 --> 3:13:57.120]  so it's interesting in 12 years is iran going to be the new north korea
[3:13:57.120 --> 3:13:59.120]  maybe not necessarily on a social
[3:13:59.120 --> 3:14:01.120]  political paradigm but as far as
[3:14:01.120 --> 3:14:03.120]  the global threat is concerned
[3:14:03.120 --> 3:14:05.120]  with its nuclear arsenal so that's an interesting history
[3:14:05.120 --> 3:14:07.120]  that you mentioned there
[3:14:07.120 --> 3:14:09.120]  and it's also worth mentioning that let's keep in mind
[3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:11.120]  the clintons also
[3:14:11.120 --> 3:14:13.120]  let the chinese get our nuclear secrets
[3:14:13.120 --> 3:14:15.120]  they let north korea get our nuclear
[3:14:15.120 --> 3:14:17.120]  secrets now the united states
[3:14:17.120 --> 3:14:19.120]  20% of our uranium to russia
[3:14:19.120 --> 3:14:21.120]  but trump is the compromise president
[3:14:21.120 --> 3:14:23.120]  somehow but keep in mind so now
[3:14:23.120 --> 3:14:25.120]  you've got the united states
[3:14:25.120 --> 3:14:27.120]  having joint military drills with south korea
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:29.120]  in south korea this is an annual
[3:14:29.120 --> 3:14:31.120]  thing kim jong-un
[3:14:31.120 --> 3:14:33.120]  freaks out and says we're going to respond
[3:14:33.120 --> 3:14:35.120]  with a merciless attack on the united states of america
[3:14:35.120 --> 3:14:37.120]  don't try to tough guy
[3:14:37.120 --> 3:14:39.120]  donald trump and rex tillerson is my suggestion
[3:14:39.120 --> 3:14:41.120]  or just keep doing it and see what happens
[3:14:41.120 --> 3:14:43.120]  i think maybe your reign of power might finally be over
[3:14:43.120 --> 3:14:45.120]  but then china
[3:14:45.120 --> 3:14:47.120]  says that it wants to work
[3:14:47.120 --> 3:14:49.120]  with the united states and russia
[3:14:49.120 --> 3:14:51.120]  and south korea to bring
[3:14:51.120 --> 3:14:53.120]  to bring peace to that region
[3:14:53.120 --> 3:14:55.120]  and to try to
[3:14:55.120 --> 3:14:57.120]  stymie north korea's nuclear threats
[3:14:57.120 --> 3:14:59.120]  but guess what china said though
[3:14:59.120 --> 3:15:01.120]  china said the only
[3:15:01.120 --> 3:15:03.120]  thing the only proposal they made
[3:15:03.120 --> 3:15:05.120]  was stop doing joint drills
[3:15:05.120 --> 3:15:07.120]  with south korea well wait a second
[3:15:07.120 --> 3:15:09.120]  is china north korea's mouth
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:11.120]  piece now i thought you said you wanted
[3:15:11.120 --> 3:15:13.120]  to work with america work with russia
[3:15:13.120 --> 3:15:15.120]  to tone down north korea how about
[3:15:15.120 --> 3:15:17.120]  all the oppression going on in north korea
[3:15:17.120 --> 3:15:19.120]  i guess that doesn't bother china considering they're doing similar things
[3:15:19.120 --> 3:15:21.120]  so who is china
[3:15:21.120 --> 3:15:23.120]  to say i want to work
[3:15:23.120 --> 3:15:25.120]  with you to get
[3:15:25.120 --> 3:15:27.120]  peace in this region to stop north korea
[3:15:27.120 --> 3:15:29.120]  from threatening their nuclear capabilities
[3:15:29.120 --> 3:15:31.120]  on the rest of the world
[3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:33.120]  but however though the only proposal
[3:15:33.120 --> 3:15:35.120]  that we're going to make is that you
[3:15:35.120 --> 3:15:37.120]  have to stop doing drills with south korea
[3:15:37.120 --> 3:15:39.120]  who north korea is threatening
[3:15:39.120 --> 3:15:41.120]  on a daily basis right so it sounds
[3:15:41.120 --> 3:15:43.120]  to me like china and north korea
[3:15:43.120 --> 3:15:45.120]  there might be
[3:15:45.120 --> 3:15:47.120]  an unhealthy relationship there for the united states
[3:15:47.120 --> 3:15:49.120]  right well they've always
[3:15:49.120 --> 3:15:51.120]  kind of collude with each other somewhat
[3:15:51.120 --> 3:15:53.120]  but i mean just think about
[3:15:53.120 --> 3:15:55.120]  that with north korea this was a
[3:15:55.120 --> 3:15:57.120]  the dictator who told
[3:15:57.120 --> 3:15:59.120]  his people they should feel lucky
[3:15:59.120 --> 3:16:01.120]  and that to prepare for eating
[3:16:01.120 --> 3:16:03.120]  grass you're gonna have a season
[3:16:03.120 --> 3:16:05.120]  of having to eat grass people you know
[3:16:05.120 --> 3:16:07.120]  we're gonna have to go to war with the usa
[3:16:07.120 --> 3:16:09.120]  i mean my goodness i can't imagine
[3:16:09.120 --> 3:16:11.120]  it's sort of similar to what's going on in venezuela
[3:16:11.120 --> 3:16:13.120]  but well well that's what
[3:16:13.120 --> 3:16:15.120]  you get from communism you just take a look
[3:16:15.120 --> 3:16:17.120]  at venezuela but
[3:16:17.120 --> 3:16:19.120]  you think about
[3:16:19.120 --> 3:16:21.120]  the liberals you think about the democrats
[3:16:21.120 --> 3:16:23.120]  you think about the virtue signaling on
[3:16:23.120 --> 3:16:25.120]  the left which has turned into nothing more
[3:16:25.120 --> 3:16:27.120]  than a group of anti-trumpers
[3:16:27.120 --> 3:16:29.120]  why do they ignore the oppression
[3:16:29.120 --> 3:16:31.120]  in north korea i never hear
[3:16:31.120 --> 3:16:33.120]  hardly anybody talk about the oppression
[3:16:33.120 --> 3:16:35.120]  in north korea i mean we've got
[3:16:35.120 --> 3:16:37.120]  pundits that go on cnn
[3:16:37.120 --> 3:16:39.120]  on a nightly basis and
[3:16:39.120 --> 3:16:41.120]  bitch and moan about racial inequality
[3:16:41.120 --> 3:16:43.120]  in this country who are
[3:16:43.120 --> 3:16:45.120]  pro-globalism
[3:16:45.120 --> 3:16:47.120]  but ignore the oppression in north korea
[3:16:47.120 --> 3:16:49.120]  so now you basically this is okay
[3:16:49.120 --> 3:16:51.120]  this is just my summation of what's going on in north korea
[3:16:51.120 --> 3:16:53.120]  kim jong-un
[3:16:53.120 --> 3:16:55.120]  is basically holding
[3:16:55.120 --> 3:16:57.120]  all of the people
[3:16:57.120 --> 3:16:59.120]  in north korea hostage
[3:16:59.120 --> 3:17:01.120]  and saying i'm in control
[3:17:01.120 --> 3:17:03.120]  here don't mess up my power
[3:17:03.120 --> 3:17:05.120]  structure or i'm just going to blow it all up
[3:17:05.120 --> 3:17:07.120]  you want that blood on your hands
[3:17:07.120 --> 3:17:09.120]  to try to stop my authoritarian regime
[3:17:09.120 --> 3:17:11.120]  and the united states is finally saying
[3:17:11.120 --> 3:17:13.120]  you know what we're not
[3:17:13.120 --> 3:17:15.120]  a bowl of soft serve ice cream like barack obama
[3:17:15.120 --> 3:17:17.120]  you're not going to have this rhetoric go
[3:17:17.120 --> 3:17:19.120]  unnoticed and you're certainly not going to threaten
[3:17:19.120 --> 3:17:21.120]  our allies in the region like japan
[3:17:21.120 --> 3:17:23.120]  who is now
[3:17:23.120 --> 3:17:25.120]  holding drills
[3:17:25.120 --> 3:17:27.120]  for bombs sirens
[3:17:27.120 --> 3:17:29.120]  blare in japan fearing north korea
[3:17:29.120 --> 3:17:31.120]  holds first missile drill look at these children
[3:17:31.120 --> 3:17:33.120]  so this is what you've got going on
[3:17:33.120 --> 3:17:35.120]  and i've got the left
[3:17:35.120 --> 3:17:37.120]  and democrats
[3:17:37.120 --> 3:17:39.120]  every day
[3:17:39.120 --> 3:17:41.120]  spouting off about trump being a russian
[3:17:41.120 --> 3:17:43.120]  agent spouting off about trump
[3:17:43.120 --> 3:17:45.120]  being a racist spouting off about
[3:17:45.120 --> 3:17:47.120]  all of this ridiculous nonsense
[3:17:47.120 --> 3:17:49.120]  have you forgotten your calling
[3:17:49.120 --> 3:17:51.120]  card liberals
[3:17:51.120 --> 3:17:53.120]  the peaceniks on the left
[3:17:53.120 --> 3:17:55.120]  where are you now you're nowhere just like the aclu
[3:17:55.120 --> 3:17:57.120]  the aclu has completely
[3:17:57.120 --> 3:17:59.120]  abandoned its goal
[3:17:59.120 --> 3:18:01.120]  of protecting the civil civil liberties of americans
[3:18:01.120 --> 3:18:03.120]  now it's nothing more than an antitrump
[3:18:03.120 --> 3:18:05.120]  wing so it's just amazing
[3:18:05.120 --> 3:18:07.120]  how it seems
[3:18:07.120 --> 3:18:09.120]  on the left from every
[3:18:09.120 --> 3:18:11.120]  side no matter what it's all being sucked
[3:18:11.120 --> 3:18:13.120]  into the vacuum of antitrump
[3:18:13.120 --> 3:18:15.120]  and they ignore all of the
[3:18:15.120 --> 3:18:17.120]  issues around the planet that they've been trying to point out
[3:18:17.120 --> 3:18:19.120]  for the last decades
[3:18:19.120 --> 3:18:21.120]  right and then of course ignoring what's going on
[3:18:21.120 --> 3:18:23.120]  say in europe because they are
[3:18:23.120 --> 3:18:25.120]  really trying to push the whole open borders
[3:18:25.120 --> 3:18:27.120]  agenda here and just
[3:18:27.120 --> 3:18:29.120]  everyone's a refugee everyone is a legal
[3:18:29.120 --> 3:18:31.120]  immigrant
[3:18:31.120 --> 3:18:33.120]  meanwhile we've got turkey threatening
[3:18:33.120 --> 3:18:35.120]  to send europe 15,000
[3:18:35.120 --> 3:18:37.120]  refugees a month so it's basically do what we
[3:18:37.120 --> 3:18:39.120]  say play by our rules
[3:18:39.120 --> 3:18:41.120]  don't speak poorly of us
[3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:43.120]  we're going to just send all these people your way
[3:18:43.120 --> 3:18:45.120]  so now that's the new strategic diplomacy
[3:18:45.120 --> 3:18:47.120]  well we're just going to send you some refugees
[3:18:47.120 --> 3:18:49.120]  and maybe there'll be some extremists
[3:18:49.120 --> 3:18:51.120]  thrown in with them as well
[3:18:51.120 --> 3:18:53.120]  and I love how this story is pitched
[3:18:53.120 --> 3:18:55.120]  ok so the same people
[3:18:55.120 --> 3:18:57.120]  can you pull that headline up again
[3:18:57.120 --> 3:18:59.120]  the same people run this headline
[3:18:59.120 --> 3:19:01.120]  turkey threatens to send europe
[3:19:01.120 --> 3:19:03.120]  15,000 refugees a month ok
[3:19:03.120 --> 3:19:05.120]  look at this headline turkey threatens
[3:19:05.120 --> 3:19:07.120]  threatens
[3:19:07.120 --> 3:19:09.120]  let's just look at the rhetoric here
[3:19:09.120 --> 3:19:11.120]  ok so you're insinuating
[3:19:11.120 --> 3:19:13.120]  that 15,000 refugees
[3:19:13.120 --> 3:19:15.120]  going into europe
[3:19:15.120 --> 3:19:17.120]  is a threat
[3:19:17.120 --> 3:19:19.120]  but when donald trump
[3:19:19.120 --> 3:19:21.120]  issues a travel ban
[3:19:21.120 --> 3:19:23.120]  to protect this country from
[3:19:23.120 --> 3:19:25.120]  unvetted refugees he's racist
[3:19:25.120 --> 3:19:27.120]  so wait a second are these
[3:19:27.120 --> 3:19:29.120]  refugees a threat
[3:19:29.120 --> 3:19:31.120]  or are you just
[3:19:31.120 --> 3:19:33.120]  spouting off whatever you can to make a headline
[3:19:33.120 --> 3:19:35.120]  get clicks because you can't run
[3:19:35.120 --> 3:19:37.120]  those headlines simultaneously
[3:19:37.120 --> 3:19:39.120]  which I would love to see you do
[3:19:39.120 --> 3:19:41.120]  because you do it all the time
[3:19:41.120 --> 3:19:43.120]  is it are all of these refugees
[3:19:43.120 --> 3:19:45.120]  a threat to national security
[3:19:45.120 --> 3:19:47.120]  or is trump a racist because he thinks these
[3:19:47.120 --> 3:19:49.120]  refugees are a threat to national security
[3:19:49.120 --> 3:19:51.120]  the headline that you ran
[3:19:51.120 --> 3:20:11.120]  we'll be right back
[3:20:21.120 --> 3:20:23.120]  we'll be right back
[3:20:51.120 --> 3:20:53.120]  because if it's worth doing right
[3:20:53.120 --> 3:20:55.120]  it's only right to do it with bailey

[3:25:45.120 --> 3:25:47.120]  got some markup off but
[3:25:47.120 --> 3:25:49.120]  you'll get another 50% off
[3:25:49.120 --> 3:25:51.120]  if you sign up for the newsletter so I think
[3:25:51.120 --> 3:25:53.120]  that brings the occupower down to like 15
[3:25:53.120 --> 3:25:55.120]  bucks
[3:25:55.120 --> 3:25:57.120]  I mean folks that's a joke
[3:25:57.120 --> 3:25:59.120]  that's a joke we sell you the best products
[3:25:59.120 --> 3:26:01.120]  at infowarstore.com and we sell you at a
[3:26:01.120 --> 3:26:03.120]  better price than you're going to find it anywhere
[3:26:03.120 --> 3:26:05.120]  else in the world
[3:26:05.120 --> 3:26:07.120]  so Donald Trump
[3:26:07.120 --> 3:26:09.120]  had a press conference today with Angela Merkel
[3:26:09.120 --> 3:26:11.120]  the big story of course was
[3:26:11.120 --> 3:26:13.120]  that well first it got delayed
[3:26:13.120 --> 3:26:15.120]  reminiscent of Hillary Clinton campaigns getting
[3:26:15.120 --> 3:26:17.120]  delayed but then
[3:26:17.120 --> 3:26:19.120]  allegedly Donald Trump rejected
[3:26:19.120 --> 3:26:21.120]  a handshake opportunity
[3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:23.120]  apparently Merkel said should we do a handshake
[3:26:23.120 --> 3:26:25.120]  for the cameras and Trump basically
[3:26:25.120 --> 3:26:27.120]  just completely ignored her
[3:26:27.120 --> 3:26:29.120]  it wasn't even a no or anything he just kind of
[3:26:29.120 --> 3:26:31.120]  just gave her the cold shoulder there it is right there
[3:26:31.120 --> 3:26:33.120]  apparently right here she said should we do a handshake
[3:26:33.120 --> 3:26:35.120]  and he's just like uh right here do you
[3:26:35.120 --> 3:26:37.120]  do a handshake no
[3:26:37.120 --> 3:26:39.120]  I'm okay with that I'm alright
[3:26:39.120 --> 3:26:41.120]  I thought one of the
[3:26:41.120 --> 3:26:43.120]  funnier moments of course was when he talked about
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:45.120]  being
[3:26:45.120 --> 3:26:47.120]  spied upon and surveilled by the former
[3:26:47.120 --> 3:26:49.120]  administration he said well I think
[3:26:49.120 --> 3:26:51.120]  you know both of us can say we at least
[3:26:51.120 --> 3:26:53.120]  have something in common
[3:26:53.120 --> 3:26:55.120]  so yeah just kind of hitting people again that
[3:26:55.120 --> 3:26:57.120]  look say what you want
[3:26:57.120 --> 3:26:59.120]  about the words that I used I chose to make
[3:26:59.120 --> 3:27:01.120]  that tweet
[3:27:01.120 --> 3:27:03.120]  regardless we were surveilled by the
[3:27:03.120 --> 3:27:05.120]  former administration and you know
[3:27:05.120 --> 3:27:07.120]  Angela Merkel just kind of had to go
[3:27:07.120 --> 3:27:09.120]  because she said
[3:27:09.120 --> 3:27:11.120]  after all that came out initially
[3:27:11.120 --> 3:27:13.120]  she was upset about it but then she forgave
[3:27:13.120 --> 3:27:15.120]  she forgave Obama because of course
[3:27:15.120 --> 3:27:17.120]  you got to save face so
[3:27:17.120 --> 3:27:19.120]  she didn't want to rile it up and let her country
[3:27:19.120 --> 3:27:21.120]  know that they're also massively being spied on
[3:27:21.120 --> 3:27:23.120]  as well and I'm telling you there's this
[3:27:23.120 --> 3:27:25.120]  weird thing happening right now
[3:27:25.120 --> 3:27:27.120]  where
[3:27:27.120 --> 3:27:29.120]  it's like watching the wwe it's just the only
[3:27:29.120 --> 3:27:31.120]  analogy I can use
[3:27:31.120 --> 3:27:33.120]  you know it's fake okay you know they've already
[3:27:33.120 --> 3:27:35.120]  got it all figured out so you're just up there enjoying
[3:27:35.120 --> 3:27:37.120]  it you know laughing going along it's here for
[3:27:37.120 --> 3:27:39.120]  entertainment
[3:27:39.120 --> 3:27:41.120]  the same paradigm happening right now
[3:27:41.120 --> 3:27:43.120]  when these liberal journalists
[3:27:43.120 --> 3:27:45.120]  get up and they ask a question
[3:27:45.120 --> 3:27:47.120]  that's just total nonsense about how he made
[3:27:47.120 --> 3:27:49.120]  up wiretapping claims or how he's a Russian
[3:27:49.120 --> 3:27:51.120]  agent they just keep
[3:27:51.120 --> 3:27:53.120]  keep parroting these same talking points
[3:27:53.120 --> 3:27:55.120]  how about the New York Times
[3:27:55.120 --> 3:27:57.120]  author the journalist who
[3:27:57.120 --> 3:27:59.120]  wrote the story about the wiretapping
[3:27:59.120 --> 3:28:01.120]  is blaming info wars
[3:28:01.120 --> 3:28:03.120]  or pushing the wiretapping narrative
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:05.120]  when he was the one that wrote the
[3:28:05.120 --> 3:28:07.120]  story
[3:28:07.120 --> 3:28:09.120]  that's what I'm saying so they're sitting
[3:28:09.120 --> 3:28:11.120]  here in their own little
[3:28:11.120 --> 3:28:13.120]  world like they're in the wwe
[3:28:13.120 --> 3:28:15.120]  pretending for everyone
[3:28:15.120 --> 3:28:17.120]  and everybody on the outside is just laughing
[3:28:17.120 --> 3:28:19.120]  everybody on the outside is just like ha ha
[3:28:19.120 --> 3:28:21.120]  you're fake like they don't even take it seriously anymore
[3:28:21.120 --> 3:28:23.120]  Sean Spicer was spicy
[3:28:23.120 --> 3:28:25.120]  all day yesterday he was just
[3:28:25.120 --> 3:28:27.120]  ripping them he was hitting punchlines left and
[3:28:27.120 --> 3:28:29.120]  right Donald Trump when they bring up the
[3:28:29.120 --> 3:28:31.120]  wiretapping claims he makes the joke he's like well
[3:28:31.120 --> 3:28:33.120]  I guess Merkel and I finally have something
[3:28:33.120 --> 3:28:35.120]  in common we both get wiretapped by Obama
[3:28:35.120 --> 3:28:37.120]  yeah so it's really just yeah it's really
[3:28:37.120 --> 3:28:39.120]  just funny to see them just flopping around
[3:28:39.120 --> 3:28:41.120]  just flailing themselves all over each other
[3:28:41.120 --> 3:28:43.120]  with these false narratives to try to bring
[3:28:43.120 --> 3:28:45.120]  Trump down I think it's really failing miserably
[3:28:45.120 --> 3:28:47.120]  and they only have their platforms that's
[3:28:47.120 --> 3:28:49.120]  it they don't have the hearts and minds of America anymore
[3:28:49.120 --> 3:28:51.120]  and it'll be interesting
[3:28:51.120 --> 3:28:53.120]  to see how far this goes
[3:28:53.120 --> 3:28:55.120]  in the entertainment industry because
[3:28:55.120 --> 3:28:57.120]  look the only reason
[3:28:57.120 --> 3:28:59.120]  by people like sham moss
[3:28:59.120 --> 3:29:01.120]  and poop dog and Madonna
[3:29:01.120 --> 3:29:03.120]  are saying anything negative about Trump
[3:29:03.120 --> 3:29:05.120]  is because they all have new albums coming out folks
[3:29:05.120 --> 3:29:07.120]  okay that's it
[3:29:07.120 --> 3:29:09.120]  they need a little publicity
[3:29:09.120 --> 3:29:11.120]  and they want to get on the radio and the liberals
[3:29:11.120 --> 3:29:13.120]  in charge of that media say hey
[3:29:13.120 --> 3:29:15.120]  maybe we have room for you maybe you don't but you make a tweet
[3:29:15.120 --> 3:29:17.120]  about Donald Trump being bad
[3:29:17.120 --> 3:29:19.120]  I think we can find a slot for you
[3:29:19.120 --> 3:29:21.120]  magically they all say something bad about Trump and guess what
[3:29:21.120 --> 3:29:23.120]  their new albums will somehow make the radio
[3:29:23.120 --> 3:29:25.120]  even though their songs probably suck
[3:29:25.120 --> 3:29:27.120]  instead of doing it the way Joy Vila did it
[3:29:27.120 --> 3:29:29.120]  which is saying hey look let's all come together
[3:29:29.120 --> 3:29:31.120]  and unite and we've actually got a guest on the other side
[3:29:31.120 --> 3:29:33.120]  Kaya Jones
[3:29:33.120 --> 3:29:35.120]  a friend of Joy Vila she's speaking out
[3:29:35.120 --> 3:29:37.120]  and saying it's time for conservatives to
[3:29:37.120 --> 3:29:39.120]  be proud of the fact that we
[3:29:39.120 --> 3:29:41.120]  were MAGA voted in Trump
[3:29:41.120 --> 3:29:43.120]  so musician Kaya Jones joins us
[3:29:43.120 --> 3:29:45.120]  on the other side stick around Owen Shroyer, Leigh Ann McAdoo
[3:29:45.120 --> 3:29:47.120]  Alex Jones show fourth hour
[3:29:47.120 --> 3:30:01.120]  on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:30:17.120 --> 3:30:19.120]  the firm's approach to what it calls clean meat
[3:30:19.120 --> 3:30:21.120]  is to culture animal cells in a lab
[3:30:21.120 --> 3:30:23.120]  feed them nutrients until they grow into pieces
[3:30:23.120 --> 3:30:25.120]  large enough to cook and eat
[3:30:25.120 --> 3:30:27.120]  you've probably seen where companies like this have grown beef
[3:30:27.120 --> 3:30:29.120]  in petri dishes
[3:30:29.120 --> 3:30:31.120]  well now it's going to be chicken strips
[3:30:31.120 --> 3:30:33.120]  and I know the question on everybody's mind is
[3:30:33.120 --> 3:30:35.120]  does the lab grown chicken
[3:30:35.120 --> 3:30:37.120]  taste like chicken
[3:30:37.120 --> 3:30:39.120]  according to the Wall Street Journal it was reported
[3:30:39.120 --> 3:30:41.120]  spongier than a whole chicken breast
[3:30:41.120 --> 3:30:43.120]  but they nearly nailed the flavor
[3:30:43.120 --> 3:30:45.120]  of the traditional variety
[3:30:45.120 --> 3:30:47.120]  all part of the globalist plan to
[3:30:47.120 --> 3:30:49.120]  remove you from the natural world
[3:30:49.120 --> 3:30:51.120]  and place you into an artificially created
[3:30:51.120 --> 3:30:53.120]  VR induced world where they control
[3:30:53.120 --> 3:30:55.120]  everything you see smell

[3:32:25.120 --> 3:32:27.120]  having to actually build civilization
[3:32:27.120 --> 3:32:29.120]  that are our superior ancestors
[3:32:29.120 --> 3:32:31.120]  and we need to do everything we can to recapture them
[3:32:31.120 --> 3:32:33.120]  everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal
[3:32:33.120 --> 3:32:35.120]  you used the meat for sustenance
[3:32:35.120 --> 3:32:37.120]  the fat for cooking
[3:32:37.120 --> 3:32:39.120]  but you used the bones for strength
[3:32:39.120 --> 3:32:41.120]  from the outside structure full of minerals
[3:32:41.120 --> 3:32:43.120]  and key cofactors to the marrow
[3:32:43.120 --> 3:32:45.120]  that produces the blood for the body
[3:32:45.120 --> 3:32:47.120]  this is the engine of the life essence
[3:32:47.120 --> 3:32:49.120]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were
[3:32:49.120 --> 3:32:51.120]  but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that
[3:32:51.120 --> 3:32:53.120]  essence that made us what we were
[3:32:53.120 --> 3:32:55.120]  and this is a big part of it
[3:32:55.120 --> 3:32:57.120]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman
[3:32:57.120 --> 3:32:59.120]  ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[3:32:59.120 --> 3:33:23.120]  the globalist great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity they end up on top
[3:33:23.120 --> 3:33:29.120]  the alex jones show
[3:33:29.120 --> 3:33:31.120]  oh and shroyer leon macadoo
[3:33:31.120 --> 3:33:33.120]  and we are about to be joined by kaya jones
[3:33:33.120 --> 3:33:35.120]  somebody I'm sure you would recognize
[3:33:35.120 --> 3:33:37.120]  from a group back in the day
[3:33:37.120 --> 3:33:39.120]  called the pussy cat dolls
[3:33:39.120 --> 3:33:41.120]  well she dropped the pussy cat dolls
[3:33:41.120 --> 3:33:43.120]  and she decided to never wear a pussy hat
[3:33:43.120 --> 3:33:45.120]  and now she joins leon macadoo and i leon
[3:33:45.120 --> 3:33:47.120]  you know I was excited to talk to kaya today
[3:33:47.120 --> 3:33:49.120]  very very excited
[3:33:49.120 --> 3:33:51.120]  we had to actually co-host the show today
[3:33:51.120 --> 3:33:53.120]  just a little background
[3:33:53.120 --> 3:33:55.120]  kaya jones is an edm artist
[3:33:55.120 --> 3:33:57.120]  she said she was inspired by joy via
[3:33:57.120 --> 3:33:59.120]  to come out of the closet
[3:33:59.120 --> 3:34:01.120]  as a trump supporter
[3:34:01.120 --> 3:34:03.120]  so she now is speaking out for those who can't
[3:34:03.120 --> 3:34:05.120]  people who really have been
[3:34:05.120 --> 3:34:07.120]  afraid to wear their their clothes
[3:34:07.120 --> 3:34:09.120]  clothing in support of donald trump
[3:34:09.120 --> 3:34:11.120]  because you know they might be afraid they're going to get knocked out
[3:34:11.120 --> 3:34:13.120]  or punched or get their hat
[3:34:13.120 --> 3:34:15.120]  taken off or something so of course joy via
[3:34:15.120 --> 3:34:17.120]  really made a
[3:34:17.120 --> 3:34:19.120]  just a bold statement there at the grammy
[3:34:19.120 --> 3:34:21.120]  so kaya served
[3:34:21.120 --> 3:34:23.120]  as the keynote speaker at the march

[3:34:41.120 --> 3:34:43.120]  kind of stepping out and
[3:34:43.120 --> 3:34:45.120]  you know stepping out of the entertainment industry
[3:34:45.120 --> 3:34:47.120]  to kind of keep your voice boxed in there
[3:34:47.120 --> 3:34:49.120]  yeah it's it's been kind
[3:34:49.120 --> 3:34:51.120]  of caging almost imprisoned if you will
[3:34:51.120 --> 3:34:53.120]  hmm now you mentioned that
[3:34:53.120 --> 3:34:55.120]  you know after
[3:34:55.120 --> 3:34:57.120]  your friend which you're you're seen there with
[3:34:57.120 --> 3:34:59.120]  her where she's wearing the dress
[3:34:59.120 --> 3:35:01.120]  she made this bold
[3:35:01.120 --> 3:35:03.120]  statement really and you said you know what
[3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:05.120]  now i'm proud to show off my my donald
[3:35:05.120 --> 3:35:07.120]  trump t-shirt you were never able to wear
[3:35:07.120 --> 3:35:09.120]  before yeah it didn't you know
[3:35:09.120 --> 3:35:11.120]  it wasn't something that was prepared
[3:35:11.120 --> 3:35:13.120]  joy and i go way back we've
[3:35:13.120 --> 3:35:15.120]  been friends for a very long time
[3:35:15.120 --> 3:35:17.120]  and i'm actually really good friends
[3:35:17.120 --> 3:35:19.120]  with andre sariana the designer of the dress
[3:35:19.120 --> 3:35:21.120]  he's actually
[3:35:21.120 --> 3:35:23.120]  did my 2014 grant me dress
[3:35:23.120 --> 3:35:25.120]  so we all have been friends
[3:35:25.120 --> 3:35:27.120]  for a good amount of time and i didn't
[3:35:27.120 --> 3:35:29.120]  know she was gonna wear that no one did we actually
[3:35:29.120 --> 3:35:31.120]  have the same makeup artist the makeup artist
[3:35:31.120 --> 3:35:33.120]  didn't know what she was gonna wear but i knew
[3:35:33.120 --> 3:35:35.120]  then it was gonna be something interesting
[3:35:35.120 --> 3:35:37.120]  um because
[3:35:37.120 --> 3:35:39.120]  i asked her i said what's joy wearing and she goes
[3:35:39.120 --> 3:35:41.120]  i don't know i don't know and i thought
[3:35:41.120 --> 3:35:43.120]  interesting so
[3:35:43.120 --> 3:35:45.120]  when we saw each other i immediately
[3:35:45.120 --> 3:35:47.120]  embraced her i just whispered in her ear you're so
[3:35:47.120 --> 3:35:49.120]  brave and thank you
[3:35:49.120 --> 3:35:51.120]  um and then we were kind of just together for the
[3:35:51.120 --> 3:35:53.120]  rest of the night and saw the insanity that it
[3:35:53.120 --> 3:35:55.120]  caused and it really did
[3:35:55.120 --> 3:35:57.120]  open up the floodgates for me and i mean
[3:35:57.120 --> 3:35:59.120]  so many other americans but for me
[3:35:59.120 --> 3:36:01.120]  we had been friends a long time
[3:36:01.120 --> 3:36:03.120]  same with andre soriano and none of us had
[3:36:03.120 --> 3:36:05.120]  discussed who we voted for
[3:36:05.120 --> 3:36:07.120]  not one conversation ever on
[3:36:07.120 --> 3:36:09.120]  we voted for trump and i think a lot of
[3:36:09.120 --> 3:36:11.120]  that is because the narrative is so
[3:36:11.120 --> 3:36:13.120]  not in a
[3:36:13.120 --> 3:36:15.120]  positive light
[3:36:15.120 --> 3:36:17.120]  and you know i bought this beautiful
[3:36:17.120 --> 3:36:19.120]  shirt to support trump last year when i
[3:36:19.120 --> 3:36:21.120]  was visiting nasa headquarters
[3:36:21.120 --> 3:36:23.120]  in washington and um
[3:36:23.120 --> 3:36:25.120]  i wasn't able to wear it and she said
[3:36:25.120 --> 3:36:27.120]  will you do something for me can you can you
[3:36:27.120 --> 3:36:29.120]  come out and support and i said i'll do it in a
[3:36:29.120 --> 3:36:31.120]  second because it is she needed
[3:36:31.120 --> 3:36:33.120]  then someone to support
[3:36:33.120 --> 3:36:35.120]  and show that she's not alone in hollywood
[3:36:35.120 --> 3:36:37.120]  um and unfortunately
[3:36:37.120 --> 3:36:39.120]  everyone thinks that she is because
[3:36:39.120 --> 3:36:41.120]  you know not a lot of people have come out
[3:36:41.120 --> 3:36:43.120]  there's very few that have come out but
[3:36:43.120 --> 3:36:45.120]  we're we're here there's a lot of us so
[3:36:45.120 --> 3:36:47.120]  when did you
[3:36:47.120 --> 3:36:49.120]  first decide that you were going to vote
[3:36:49.120 --> 3:36:51.120]  for donald trump or when did you first decide
[3:36:51.120 --> 3:36:53.120]  to support donald trump and then just
[3:36:53.120 --> 3:36:55.120]  to follow up on what you just said is that
[3:36:55.120 --> 3:36:57.120]  typical to not talk about who you voted is that
[3:36:57.120 --> 3:36:59.120]  just standard just nobody really talks about it
[3:36:59.120 --> 3:37:01.120]  or because of the polarized environment around
[3:37:01.120 --> 3:37:03.120]  this election is that why no one was talking
[3:37:03.120 --> 3:37:05.120]  about it right um you know those are both
[3:37:05.120 --> 3:37:07.120]  really good questions i mean the biggest
[3:37:07.120 --> 3:37:09.120]  thing is yes
[3:37:09.120 --> 3:37:11.120]  uh we don't talk about
[3:37:11.120 --> 3:37:13.120]  our political views everyone kind
[3:37:13.120 --> 3:37:15.120]  of just stays mum to the word a lot of
[3:37:15.120 --> 3:37:17.120]  the reasons i even left the pussycat dolls
[3:37:17.120 --> 3:37:19.120]  and you know it it came out
[3:37:19.120 --> 3:37:21.120]  in this flood of now being able to speak my
[3:37:21.120 --> 3:37:23.120]  truth and be honest with who i
[3:37:23.120 --> 3:37:25.120]  am and that i'm a conservative you know at the
[3:37:25.120 --> 3:37:27.120]  time i thought being 19
[3:37:27.120 --> 3:37:29.120]  2021 like there must be something wrong
[3:37:29.120 --> 3:37:31.120]  with me why i'm not okay with certain things
[3:37:31.120 --> 3:37:33.120]  that were going on and
[3:37:33.120 --> 3:37:35.120]  you know i had no one really to go no you're
[3:37:35.120 --> 3:37:37.120]  just a conservative girl you know
[3:37:37.120 --> 3:37:39.120]  you love jesus you you're
[3:37:39.120 --> 3:37:41.120]  just not into certain things and
[3:37:41.120 --> 3:37:43.120]  i just didn't understand that and so in
[3:37:43.120 --> 3:37:45.120]  this process it opened up
[3:37:45.120 --> 3:37:47.120]  really me understanding that
[3:37:47.120 --> 3:37:49.120]  i'm a conservative and there is a name for this
[3:37:49.120 --> 3:37:51.120]  and this is what this is and um
[3:37:51.120 --> 3:37:53.120]  yeah no one really shares it's
[3:37:53.120 --> 3:37:55.120]  not something that people
[3:37:55.120 --> 3:37:57.120]  openly share i think
[3:37:57.120 --> 3:37:59.120]  of fear for me i knew when i was
[3:37:59.120 --> 3:38:01.120]  going to vote for trump
[3:38:01.120 --> 3:38:03.120]  we'll go a little bit further back than that
[3:38:03.120 --> 3:38:05.120]  i started doing a lot of work
[3:38:05.120 --> 3:38:07.120]  for the lgbt community
[3:38:07.120 --> 3:38:09.120]  when i went over to iraq in
[3:38:09.120 --> 3:38:11.120]  2010 and did 20 shows in 10
[3:38:11.120 --> 3:38:13.120]  days for our military in support i met a
[3:38:13.120 --> 3:38:15.120]  lot of soldiers that were gay
[3:38:15.120 --> 3:38:17.120]  um or lesbians and um
[3:38:17.120 --> 3:38:19.120]  they weren't able to speak their truth during
[3:38:19.120 --> 3:38:21.120]  prop 8 this was in that time
[3:38:21.120 --> 3:38:23.120]  so i felt that it was important
[3:38:23.120 --> 3:38:25.120]  to come home and support
[3:38:25.120 --> 3:38:27.120]  um our lgbt community that was
[3:38:27.120 --> 3:38:29.120]  dying and you know fighting for my
[3:38:29.120 --> 3:38:31.120]  freedom and there wasn't more of a voice
[3:38:31.120 --> 3:38:33.120]  that propelled me into now speaking
[3:38:33.120 --> 3:38:35.120]  a lot for the lgbt community
[3:38:35.120 --> 3:38:37.120]  and i think in them not
[3:38:37.120 --> 3:38:39.120]  understanding what trump was about
[3:38:39.120 --> 3:38:41.120]  and always being pushed a narrative that
[3:38:41.120 --> 3:38:43.120]  wasn't the truth of what
[3:38:43.120 --> 3:38:45.120]  was going on it forced me
[3:38:45.120 --> 3:38:47.120]  to kind of feel shunned by the
[3:38:47.120 --> 3:38:49.120]  community that i was the closest to the most
[3:38:49.120 --> 3:38:51.120]  in this process of actually voting
[3:38:51.120 --> 3:38:53.120]  for trump and one of the main reasons i did
[3:38:53.120 --> 3:38:55.120]  vote for trump um he spoke about our
[3:38:55.120 --> 3:38:57.120]  land out that was a big deal for
[3:38:57.120 --> 3:38:59.120]  me being a you
[3:38:59.120 --> 3:39:01.120]  know a person that speaks out in the lgbt
[3:39:01.120 --> 3:39:03.120]  community and hearing
[3:39:03.120 --> 3:39:05.120]  him actually take a stance about what happened
[3:39:05.120 --> 3:39:07.120]  to americans that night and
[3:39:07.120 --> 3:39:09.120]  to an attack on our lgbt
[3:39:09.120 --> 3:39:11.120]  community um
[3:39:11.120 --> 3:39:13.120]  that for me was one
[3:39:13.120 --> 3:39:15.120]  of the biggest reasons i voted for him
[3:39:15.120 --> 3:39:17.120]  also because he wasn't part
[3:39:17.120 --> 3:39:19.120]  of this whole collective of people
[3:39:19.120 --> 3:39:21.120]  that were going to tell you what to do
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:23.120]  and what to think and they were part of the establishment
[3:39:23.120 --> 3:39:25.120]  he didn't need the money
[3:39:25.120 --> 3:39:27.120]  he wanted to do it for you know
[3:39:27.120 --> 3:39:29.120]  the love of country and i understand
[3:39:29.120 --> 3:39:31.120]  that so much so
[3:39:31.120 --> 3:39:33.120]  that to me spoke
[3:39:33.120 --> 3:39:35.120]  volumes and i've always respected him
[3:39:35.120 --> 3:39:37.120]  as a businessman i knew he was going to win
[3:39:37.120 --> 3:39:39.120]  that's what's so funny is i actually told people
[3:39:39.120 --> 3:39:41.120]  two years like literally when it started
[3:39:41.120 --> 3:39:43.120]  when he announced i said he was going to win
[3:39:43.120 --> 3:39:45.120]  and everybody i knew was like no he's not going
[3:39:45.120 --> 3:39:47.120]  to win there's no way he's going to win
[3:39:47.120 --> 3:39:49.120]  i said okay you'll see
[3:39:49.120 --> 3:39:51.120]  and i wasn't able to share my piece because
[3:39:51.120 --> 3:39:53.120]  every time i tried i was shut up
[3:39:53.120 --> 3:39:55.120]  like immediately like
[3:39:55.120 --> 3:39:57.120]  oh he's this and he's that
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:39:59.120]  and hillary and it was just
[3:39:59.120 --> 3:40:01.120]  there was no discussion there wasn't
[3:40:01.120 --> 3:40:03.120]  this isn't a you know a debate
[3:40:03.120 --> 3:40:05.120]  this was um i hate
[3:40:05.120 --> 3:40:07.120]  you because you're voting for this person
[3:40:07.120 --> 3:40:09.120]  and that was something i had never
[3:40:09.120 --> 3:40:11.120]  encountered
[3:40:11.120 --> 3:40:13.120]  and you know that's funny that you talk
[3:40:13.120 --> 3:40:15.120]  about that trying to have a discussion
[3:40:15.120 --> 3:40:17.120]  about why you're voting trump
[3:40:17.120 --> 3:40:19.120]  or why you believe in these policies
[3:40:19.120 --> 3:40:21.120]  like you said you can't really hold that discussion
[3:40:21.120 --> 3:40:23.120]  and i had the same experience i don't know
[3:40:23.120 --> 3:40:25.120]  about julien but i would always end the argument
[3:40:25.120 --> 3:40:27.120]  which is like okay you'll see like you're
[3:40:27.120 --> 3:40:29.120]  not going to listen to me you're not going to let me tell
[3:40:29.120 --> 3:40:31.120]  you what's happening so just fine just go ahead
[3:40:31.120 --> 3:40:33.120]  and you'll see and well they saw
[3:40:33.120 --> 3:40:35.120]  they did well it's pretty amazing
[3:40:35.120 --> 3:40:37.120]  if you even just open up dialogue with
[3:40:37.120 --> 3:40:39.120]  people and then give them the facts
[3:40:39.120 --> 3:40:41.120]  if they're willing to listen i've had a lot
[3:40:41.120 --> 3:40:43.120]  of people change their mind and go wow i didn't
[3:40:43.120 --> 3:40:45.120]  even realize that because the media told
[3:40:45.120 --> 3:40:47.120]  me differently oh yeah i mean
[3:40:47.120 --> 3:40:49.120]  a lot of my
[3:40:49.120 --> 3:40:51.120]  really close friends it was interesting
[3:40:51.120 --> 3:40:53.120]  um some from the lgbt community
[3:40:53.120 --> 3:40:55.120]  would call me and say
[3:40:55.120 --> 3:40:57.120]  i'm voting for trump
[3:40:57.120 --> 3:40:59.120]  they almost like they knew i was
[3:40:59.120 --> 3:41:01.120]  but i hadn't confirmed or denied
[3:41:01.120 --> 3:41:03.120]  anything with them so they were
[3:41:03.120 --> 3:41:05.120]  reaching out already trying to say i'm voting
[3:41:05.120 --> 3:41:07.120]  for trump and this was my truth
[3:41:07.120 --> 3:41:09.120]  and i feel like you would understand
[3:41:09.120 --> 3:41:11.120]  and um and that was interesting that
[3:41:11.120 --> 3:41:13.120]  there was this like secrecy and privacy
[3:41:13.120 --> 3:41:15.120]  in it and you know that's how i knew
[3:41:15.120 --> 3:41:17.120]  he was going to win i mean from the moment
[3:41:17.120 --> 3:41:19.120]  that the polls started
[3:41:19.120 --> 3:41:21.120]  just in a collective of talking to people
[3:41:21.120 --> 3:41:23.120]  about the candidates you already
[3:41:23.120 --> 3:41:25.120]  had a good idea of who's going to win so i thought
[3:41:25.120 --> 3:41:27.120]  it really interesting that the news outlets
[3:41:27.120 --> 3:41:29.120]  were forcing the narrative
[3:41:29.120 --> 3:41:31.120]  that this was who was going to win
[3:41:31.120 --> 3:41:33.120]  and they were so sure
[3:41:33.120 --> 3:41:35.120]  um but the general population
[3:41:35.120 --> 3:41:37.120]  didn't have signs on their lawn this year
[3:41:37.120 --> 3:41:39.120]  they didn't have stickers on their car this year
[3:41:39.120 --> 3:41:41.120]  this should have said
[3:41:41.120 --> 3:41:43.120]  right away something very different
[3:41:43.120 --> 3:41:45.120]  is occurring and that anyone
[3:41:45.120 --> 3:41:47.120]  that didn't post anything anyone that you
[3:41:47.120 --> 3:41:49.120]  know as much as people want to say oh they don't know
[3:41:49.120 --> 3:41:51.120]  what i who i voted for what my views are
[3:41:51.120 --> 3:41:53.120]  they do if you never posted
[3:41:53.120 --> 3:41:55.120]  or wrote anything about or even
[3:41:55.120 --> 3:41:57.120]  responded to any of the comments about
[3:41:57.120 --> 3:41:59.120]  the other candidate it was pretty obvious
[3:41:59.120 --> 3:42:01.120]  who you're going to vote for yeah like if you
[3:42:01.120 --> 3:42:03.120]  didn't tweet trump as a racist you
[3:42:03.120 --> 3:42:05.120]  probably that's right
[3:42:05.120 --> 3:42:07.120]  and that's another thing that's really unfortunate
[3:42:07.120 --> 3:42:09.120]  is that you know
[3:42:09.120 --> 3:42:11.120]  you lost get over
[3:42:11.120 --> 3:42:13.120]  it moving on he is our
[3:42:13.120 --> 3:42:15.120]  president and the reality
[3:42:15.120 --> 3:42:17.120]  of it is is that the mocking
[3:42:17.120 --> 3:42:19.120]  of our first lady the things that are going
[3:42:19.120 --> 3:42:21.120]  on is
[3:42:21.120 --> 3:42:23.120]  just kind of crude and no coot
[3:42:23.120 --> 3:42:25.120]  or class and our country is not
[3:42:25.120 --> 3:42:27.120]  that that is not what america
[3:42:27.120 --> 3:42:29.120]  is about we are a civilized nation
[3:42:29.120 --> 3:42:31.120]  so this anarchy of
[3:42:31.120 --> 3:42:33.120]  angst and anger
[3:42:33.120 --> 3:42:35.120]  when they've been in power for eight years
[3:42:35.120 --> 3:42:37.120]  and now it's time to
[3:42:37.120 --> 3:42:39.120]  shift the pendulum which is what politics
[3:42:39.120 --> 3:42:41.120]  is it doesn't move a lot in
[3:42:41.120 --> 3:42:43.120]  a vast amount of time it swings a little bit
[3:42:43.120 --> 3:42:45.120]  here swings a little bit there
[3:42:45.120 --> 3:42:47.120]  we somehow over time find a center
[3:42:47.120 --> 3:42:49.120]  and so I just find it
[3:42:49.120 --> 3:42:51.120]  appalling that you know you didn't
[3:42:51.120 --> 3:42:53.120]  think he would accept you know
[3:42:53.120 --> 3:42:55.120]  the results we accepted
[3:42:55.120 --> 3:42:57.120]  them because we won and now
[3:42:57.120 --> 3:42:59.120]  you're belittling
[3:42:59.120 --> 3:43:01.120]  and being mean and
[3:43:01.120 --> 3:43:03.120]  rude to anyone that loves country
[3:43:03.120 --> 3:43:05.120]  the millions of americans that have already died
[3:43:05.120 --> 3:43:07.120]  for our nation you know going to
[3:43:07.120 --> 3:43:09.120]  iraq i almost want to say every artist
[3:43:09.120 --> 3:43:11.120]  should just do that philanthropy work
[3:43:11.120 --> 3:43:13.120]  go to iraq go to
[3:43:13.120 --> 3:43:15.120]  some bases go visit our military
[3:43:15.120 --> 3:43:17.120]  see what these people really do
[3:43:17.120 --> 3:43:19.120]  and the reality is that our country is not
[3:43:19.120 --> 3:43:21.120]  free there's a lot of blood
[3:43:21.120 --> 3:43:23.120]  and bones on our
[3:43:23.120 --> 3:43:25.120]  flag of people that have died
[3:43:25.120 --> 3:43:27.120]  to protect our nation to give us these
[3:43:27.120 --> 3:43:29.120]  freedoms of being able to be
[3:43:29.120 --> 3:43:31.120]  a lesbian or a gay man
[3:43:31.120 --> 3:43:33.120]  holding each other's hand walking down the street
[3:43:33.120 --> 3:43:35.120]  there are things that have happened that have
[3:43:35.120 --> 3:43:37.120]  allowed us to have this freedom
[3:43:37.120 --> 3:43:39.120]  and so to attack it
[3:43:39.120 --> 3:43:41.120]  and
[3:43:41.120 --> 3:43:43.120]  undermine the
[3:43:43.120 --> 3:43:45.120]  the amount of strength that
[3:43:45.120 --> 3:43:47.120]  is behind this nation and the
[3:43:47.120 --> 3:43:49.120]  amount of incredible minds that has helped
[3:43:49.120 --> 3:43:51.120]  built this nation it's just
[3:43:51.120 --> 3:43:53.120]  really hurtful you don't necessarily
[3:43:53.120 --> 3:43:55.120]  have to love the man in power but you do
[3:43:55.120 --> 3:43:57.120]  have to love that you're part of a really
[3:43:57.120 --> 3:43:59.120]  incredible country there
[3:43:59.120 --> 3:44:01.120]  is nowhere in this world that is like
[3:44:01.120 --> 3:44:03.120]  america and i've been to all
[3:44:03.120 --> 3:44:05.120]  of them
[3:44:05.120 --> 3:44:07.120]  i can assure you maybe
[3:44:07.120 --> 3:44:09.120]  others need to go and see what's out there
[3:44:09.120 --> 3:44:11.120]  when they think they're imprisoned
[3:44:11.120 --> 3:44:13.120]  you know in india it is
[3:44:13.120 --> 3:44:15.120]  an offense to be gay
[3:44:15.120 --> 3:44:17.120]  these are serious things
[3:44:17.120 --> 3:44:19.120]  that you know when you're throwing around
[3:44:19.120 --> 3:44:21.120]  religion and
[3:44:21.120 --> 3:44:23.120]  your ideology of what you think is going on
[3:44:23.120 --> 3:44:25.120]  you really need to pay attention on what's going on
[3:44:25.120 --> 3:44:27.120]  and accepting money from
[3:44:27.120 --> 3:44:29.120]  you know a candidate accepting money from
[3:44:29.120 --> 3:44:31.120]  countries that are okay with Shreya law
[3:44:31.120 --> 3:44:33.120]  that are okay with women being possessions
[3:44:33.120 --> 3:44:35.120]  that are okay with nine year old brides
[3:44:35.120 --> 3:44:37.120]  that are okay with persecution
[3:44:37.120 --> 3:44:39.120]  of gays to me
[3:44:39.120 --> 3:44:41.120]  is an abomination
[3:44:41.120 --> 3:44:43.120]  on the world to judge
[3:44:43.120 --> 3:44:45.120]  that's God's that's God's job
[3:44:45.120 --> 3:44:47.120]  that's not our job as human beings we don't have
[3:44:47.120 --> 3:44:49.120]  the authority or the right to do this
[3:44:49.120 --> 3:44:51.120]  so there's this
[3:44:51.120 --> 3:44:53.120]  angst within me going you know
[3:44:53.120 --> 3:44:55.120]  what what is really going on here when
[3:44:55.120 --> 3:44:57.120]  you know you have snoop dog and
[3:44:57.120 --> 3:44:59.120]  bow and all these people saying really hurtful
[3:44:59.120 --> 3:45:01.120]  offensive things and understanding that this is a bigger
[3:45:01.120 --> 3:45:03.120]  deal than what you think
[3:45:03.120 --> 3:45:05.120]  Donald Trump might be because he was on the apprentice
[3:45:05.120 --> 3:45:07.120]  or what you think he might be
[3:45:07.120 --> 3:45:09.120]  because he doesn't fit your mold
[3:45:09.120 --> 3:45:11.120]  this is our president this is our commander in chief
[3:45:11.120 --> 3:45:13.120]  now and we need to unite
[3:45:13.120 --> 3:45:15.120]  as Americans we need to unite
[3:45:15.120 --> 3:45:17.120]  as a culture
[3:45:17.120 --> 3:45:19.120]  and understand that there are people that want to harm
[3:45:19.120 --> 3:45:21.120]  us
[3:45:21.120 --> 3:45:23.120]  and what we believe I have friends that are Muslim
[3:45:23.120 --> 3:45:25.120]  that are scared of radical Muslims
[3:45:25.120 --> 3:45:27.120]  like this is not
[3:45:27.120 --> 3:45:29.120]  just a one-sided narrative
[3:45:29.120 --> 3:45:31.120]  and so it's really
[3:45:31.120 --> 3:45:33.120]  disgusting that we're not able to talk
[3:45:33.120 --> 3:45:35.120]  we're not able to communicate with each other
[3:45:35.120 --> 3:45:37.120]  because there's so much anger
[3:45:37.120 --> 3:45:39.120]  and I do believe that's generational hate
[3:45:39.120 --> 3:45:41.120]  generational pain
[3:45:41.120 --> 3:45:43.120]  and we need to work
[3:45:43.120 --> 3:45:45.120]  past and through that
[3:45:45.120 --> 3:45:47.120]  that's generational that's not
[3:45:47.120 --> 3:45:49.120]  in the here and the now
[3:45:49.120 --> 3:45:51.120]  let's try and forgive
[3:45:51.120 --> 3:45:53.120]  and forget and not
[3:45:53.120 --> 3:45:55.120]  forget in the narrative of what has happened
[3:45:55.120 --> 3:45:57.120]  the down
[3:45:57.120 --> 3:45:59.120]  is what has happened but in
[3:45:59.120 --> 3:46:01.120]  a way that says
[3:46:01.120 --> 3:46:03.120]  I'm Native American
[3:46:03.120 --> 3:46:05.120]  my father is a full Native American born raised
[3:46:05.120 --> 3:46:07.120]  on a reservation in Dallas, Texas
[3:46:07.120 --> 3:46:09.120]  does that mean that I hate all white people
[3:46:09.120 --> 3:46:11.120]  come on this is
[3:46:11.120 --> 3:46:13.120]  lunacy we are all
[3:46:13.120 --> 3:46:15.120]  out of many
[3:46:15.120 --> 3:46:17.120]  out of many one people
[3:46:17.120 --> 3:46:19.120]  so we should all
[3:46:19.120 --> 3:46:21.120]  unite somehow we should all
[3:46:21.120 --> 3:46:23.120]  understand that for the greater good of our country
[3:46:23.120 --> 3:46:25.120]  what we're sending out a message
[3:46:25.120 --> 3:46:27.120]  is that we're not united and we're easily
[3:46:27.120 --> 3:46:29.120]  divided and that's easy to infiltrate
[3:46:29.120 --> 3:46:31.120]  right and I think a lot of young
[3:46:31.120 --> 3:46:33.120]  people will start seeing
[3:46:33.120 --> 3:46:35.120]  that there we have a lot more
[3:46:35.120 --> 3:46:37.120]  in common when artists like yourself
[3:46:37.120 --> 3:46:39.120]  and entertainers do step outside
[3:46:39.120 --> 3:46:41.120]  of that box and say look the left
[3:46:41.120 --> 3:46:43.120]  can't claim that they have
[3:46:43.120 --> 3:46:45.120]  all the cool kids on their side and you're so you're only
[3:46:45.120 --> 3:46:47.120]  cool if you believe this
[3:46:47.120 --> 3:46:49.120]  certain way and that it's it's they've really
[3:46:49.120 --> 3:46:51.120]  sort of owned the fact
[3:46:51.120 --> 3:46:53.120]  that you know the cool kids are on this side
[3:46:53.120 --> 3:46:55.120]  of the team and I really appreciate
[3:46:55.120 --> 3:46:57.120]  you know you speaking out that's that's
[3:46:57.120 --> 3:46:59.120]  well and I appreciate you guys for having me
[3:46:59.120 --> 3:47:01.120]  you know I think the most
[3:47:01.120 --> 3:47:03.120]  important thing is the amount of letters
[3:47:03.120 --> 3:47:05.120]  I've received and I feel like viewers really need
[3:47:05.120 --> 3:47:07.120]  to understand I've received letters
[3:47:07.120 --> 3:47:09.120]  from 1314
[3:47:09.120 --> 3:47:11.120]  15 year olds that are gay
[3:47:11.120 --> 3:47:13.120]  that are conservative saying thank you
[3:47:13.120 --> 3:47:15.120]  this is something
[3:47:15.120 --> 3:47:17.120]  that isn't just about being a cool kid
[3:47:17.120 --> 3:47:19.120]  and by the way it is cool to not want
[3:47:19.120 --> 3:47:21.120]  to do drugs it is cool to
[3:47:21.120 --> 3:47:23.120]  care about unit core God
[3:47:23.120 --> 3:47:25.120]  and country it is cool
[3:47:25.120 --> 3:47:27.120]  to not always follow suit
[3:47:27.120 --> 3:47:29.120]  with what's going on around you that
[3:47:29.120 --> 3:47:31.120]  is cool and
[3:47:31.120 --> 3:47:33.120]  there are a lot of kids that don't
[3:47:33.120 --> 3:47:35.120]  have a messenger right now
[3:47:35.120 --> 3:47:37.120]  because all they're hearing over a loud
[3:47:37.120 --> 3:47:39.120]  microphone is this establishment
[3:47:39.120 --> 3:47:41.120]  is negative they're racist
[3:47:41.120 --> 3:47:43.120]  they're this they're that
[3:47:43.120 --> 3:47:45.120]  and there are a lot of children that are raised
[3:47:45.120 --> 3:47:47.120]  in conservative homes I was
[3:47:47.120 --> 3:47:49.120]  I didn't realize that I was a conservative
[3:47:49.120 --> 3:47:51.120]  and there was nothing wrong with me that I wasn't
[3:47:51.120 --> 3:47:53.120]  okay with what was going on behind the scenes
[3:47:53.120 --> 3:47:55.120]  of the dolls that's really the root of it
[3:47:55.120 --> 3:47:57.120]  it wasn't because I wanted to be number
[3:47:57.120 --> 3:47:59.120]  one or be more famous than the rest
[3:47:59.120 --> 3:48:01.120]  it was I wasn't okay with this collective
[3:48:01.120 --> 3:48:03.120]  this isn't what I signed up for
[3:48:03.120 --> 3:48:05.120]  I'm not going to sell my integrity
[3:48:05.120 --> 3:48:07.120]  or my soul for fame or
[3:48:07.120 --> 3:48:09.120]  for money
[3:48:09.120 --> 3:48:11.120]  as no one else should and so
[3:48:11.120 --> 3:48:13.120]  you know I never
[3:48:13.120 --> 3:48:15.120]  get aggressive but when I saw what
[3:48:15.120 --> 3:48:17.120]  Bow Wow texted I literally said someone
[3:48:17.120 --> 3:48:19.120]  slap him up his damn head because
[3:48:19.120 --> 3:48:21.120]  it's so ridiculous
[3:48:21.120 --> 3:48:23.120]  now that he would say something so
[3:48:23.120 --> 3:48:25.120]  uncouth about a woman
[3:48:25.120 --> 3:48:27.120]  human trafficking is a big problem
[3:48:27.120 --> 3:48:29.120]  right prostitution is a big
[3:48:29.120 --> 3:48:31.120]  problem
[3:48:31.120 --> 3:48:33.120]  to make
[3:48:33.120 --> 3:48:35.120]  a connotation like you know
[3:48:35.120 --> 3:48:37.120]  someone's a hoe and a pimp and this and that
[3:48:37.120 --> 3:48:39.120]  and you think it's funny or cool about our first lady
[3:48:39.120 --> 3:48:41.120]  that was said about Michelle Obama
[3:48:41.120 --> 3:48:43.120]  are you joking I would
[3:48:43.120 --> 3:48:45.120]  be everywhere
[3:48:45.120 --> 3:48:47.120]  and everyone would say shame on you
[3:48:47.120 --> 3:48:49.120]  but for some reason because she's Slovenian
[3:48:51.120 --> 3:48:53.120]  you know and white and Mr. Trump's wife
[3:48:53.120 --> 3:48:55.120]  somehow that feels like
[3:48:55.120 --> 3:48:57.120]  it's okay but at what point
[3:48:57.120 --> 3:48:59.120]  is racism racism and
[3:48:59.120 --> 3:49:01.120]  being discriminative
[3:49:01.120 --> 3:49:03.120]  toward women in a whole
[3:49:05.120 --> 3:49:07.120]  it's disgusting
[3:49:07.120 --> 3:49:09.120]  those kinds of messages are
[3:49:09.120 --> 3:49:11.120]  teaching kids that it's okay
[3:49:11.120 --> 3:49:13.120]  to bully and abuse
[3:49:13.120 --> 3:49:15.120]  and be uncouth and be rude
[3:49:15.120 --> 3:49:17.120]  to an elder or someone
[3:49:17.120 --> 3:49:19.120]  in a higher position
[3:49:19.120 --> 3:49:21.120]  respect your elders
[3:49:21.120 --> 3:49:23.120]  respect people that have earned those four stars
[3:49:23.120 --> 3:49:25.120]  that have earned the right
[3:49:25.120 --> 3:49:27.120]  of running the government and by the way he
[3:49:27.120 --> 3:49:29.120]  earned the right he played the game and he
[3:49:29.120 --> 3:49:31.120]  played it better than anyone else everyone was
[3:49:31.120 --> 3:49:33.120]  worried about popular votes and he
[3:49:33.120 --> 3:49:35.120]  understood that hey I can hit way more
[3:49:35.120 --> 3:49:37.120]  states and
[3:49:37.120 --> 3:49:39.120]  go with you know with the college
[3:49:39.120 --> 3:49:41.120]  with the collective I can go
[3:49:41.120 --> 3:49:43.120]  and grab that and that's smart
[3:49:43.120 --> 3:49:45.120]  to me that's not oh he
[3:49:45.120 --> 3:49:47.120]  was unfair he was the smarter of the two
[3:49:47.120 --> 3:49:49.120]  candidates I mean I would have thought maybe
[3:49:49.120 --> 3:49:51.120]  she would have how could she not have known
[3:49:51.120 --> 3:49:53.120]  that how could she not have known that
[3:49:53.120 --> 3:49:55.120]  her husband was a president I mean you have to
[3:49:55.120 --> 3:49:57.120]  know kind of the stream of how you can catch
[3:49:57.120 --> 3:49:59.120]  these votes and it was focused on
[3:49:59.120 --> 3:50:01.120]  bigger populated areas but not
[3:50:01.120 --> 3:50:03.120]  as many states and everyone's so confused
[3:50:03.120 --> 3:50:05.120]  well the truth is Kaya they
[3:50:05.120 --> 3:50:07.120]  they thought that they were going to rig this
[3:50:07.120 --> 3:50:09.120]  thing they thought they had it stolen they
[3:50:09.120 --> 3:50:11.120]  thought they were going to cheat and they thought
[3:50:11.120 --> 3:50:13.120]  they had the votes they thought they had the
[3:50:13.120 --> 3:50:15.120]  illegals and they lost they didn't get the
[3:50:15.120 --> 3:50:17.120]  numbers it was a complete landslide for
[3:50:17.120 --> 3:50:19.120]  Trump we're joined by Kaya Jones formerly
[3:50:19.120 --> 3:50:21.120]  of the pussycat dolls now I want to get to
[3:50:21.120 --> 3:50:23.120]  this on the other side we're about to take a
[3:50:23.120 --> 3:50:25.120]  break here and by the way I think that we
[3:50:25.120 --> 3:50:27.120]  probably should have maybe slapped a pair
[3:50:27.120 --> 3:50:29.120]  of handcuffs on a Bow Wow not just across
[3:50:29.120 --> 3:50:31.120]  the side of the head but I get the feeling
[3:50:31.120 --> 3:50:33.120]  that there may be some politics involved
[3:50:33.120 --> 3:50:35.120]  here but behind the scenes people like
[3:50:35.120 --> 3:50:37.120]  Snoop Dogg people like Bow Wow people
[3:50:37.120 --> 3:50:39.120]  like Madonna these are all people Lady
[3:50:39.120 --> 3:50:41.120]  they're all people with albums that are set
[3:50:41.120 --> 3:50:43.120]  for release all the sudden they make a
[3:50:43.120 --> 3:50:45.120]  negative comment about Donald Trump and
[3:50:45.120 --> 3:50:47.120]  they get publicity across the board I
[3:50:47.120 --> 3:50:49.120]  think there might be something more to
[3:50:49.120 --> 3:50:51.120]  that we're going to get the answer from
[3:50:51.120 --> 3:50:53.120]  Kaya Jones on the other side Leanne

[3:52:11.120 --> 3:52:13.120]  as Americans we are largely sheltered

[3:52:15.120 --> 3:52:17.120]  of the world just having enough food
[3:52:17.120 --> 3:52:19.120]  is a huge problem for some of us
[3:52:19.120 --> 3:52:21.120]  there is the nagging thought that we may not
[3:52:21.120 --> 3:52:23.120]  always have it so good so we
[3:52:23.120 --> 3:52:25.120]  keep some food on hand just in case

[3:54:13.120 --> 3:54:15.120]  Owen Shroyer, Leigh Ann McAdoo were joined by
[3:54:15.120 --> 3:54:17.120]  Kaya Jones, formerly of the Pussycat Dolls
[3:54:17.120 --> 3:54:19.120]  now solo EDM artist doing her own stuff
[3:54:19.120 --> 3:54:21.120]  you can check her out on YouTube
[3:54:21.120 --> 3:54:23.120]  you have actually worked with Snoop Dogg
[3:54:23.120 --> 3:54:25.120]  in the past many people probably forget that
[3:54:25.120 --> 3:54:27.120]  you can choose to comment on that or not
[3:54:27.120 --> 3:54:29.120]  but let's go back to my question before the break
[3:54:29.120 --> 3:54:31.120]  how much of Snoop Dogg Bow Wow Madonna
[3:54:31.120 --> 3:54:33.120]  Lady Gaga coming out
[3:54:33.120 --> 3:54:35.120]  and making these antitrump remarks
[3:54:35.120 --> 3:54:37.120]  how much of that is personal political
[3:54:37.120 --> 3:54:39.120]  slash how much of it is personal business
[3:54:39.120 --> 3:54:41.120]  I just need attention to try to sell albums
[3:54:41.120 --> 3:54:43.120]  well um you know
[3:54:43.120 --> 3:54:45.120]  this is the thing I do believe that there's
[3:54:45.120 --> 3:54:47.120]  a good amount of it that is
[3:54:47.120 --> 3:54:49.120]  solely focused on getting attention
[3:54:49.120 --> 3:54:51.120]  um and we know that
[3:54:51.120 --> 3:54:53.120]  President Trump has
[3:54:53.120 --> 3:54:55.120]  has a lot of uh you know
[3:54:55.120 --> 3:54:57.120]  placement in the news every single
[3:54:57.120 --> 3:54:59.120]  day I don't think there is any news article
[3:54:59.120 --> 3:55:01.120]  that doesn't include him um
[3:55:01.120 --> 3:55:03.120]  I say he's the most popular human in the history of the world
[3:55:03.120 --> 3:55:05.120]  at least as far as
[3:55:05.120 --> 3:55:07.120]  and he has the most powerful position as well
[3:55:07.120 --> 3:55:09.120]  um but everyone needs to lay off of it
[3:55:09.120 --> 3:55:11.120]  because he actually has to do a job
[3:55:11.120 --> 3:55:13.120]  and you know I
[3:55:13.120 --> 3:55:15.120]  I don't really love Kasek but I will
[3:55:15.120 --> 3:55:17.120]  say that his analogy is
[3:55:17.120 --> 3:55:19.120]  spot on you know
[3:55:19.120 --> 3:55:21.120]  um am I going to not agree with my
[3:55:21.120 --> 3:55:23.120]  pilot or go against my pilot
[3:55:23.120 --> 3:55:25.120]  if I'm on a plane like
[3:55:25.120 --> 3:55:27.120]  he's kind of the pilot of this
[3:55:27.120 --> 3:55:29.120]  country right now like nothing's going to change
[3:55:29.120 --> 3:55:31.120]  he's not going to be impeached
[3:55:31.120 --> 3:55:33.120]  by the way you have to hold
[3:55:33.120 --> 3:55:35.120]  the House the Senate one and all three
[3:55:35.120 --> 3:55:37.120]  are not with you guys so you can impeach
[3:55:37.120 --> 3:55:39.120]  him um I know
[3:55:39.120 --> 3:55:41.120]  you want to think that you can and it sounds really good
[3:55:41.120 --> 3:55:43.120]  to keep pushing that narrative
[3:55:43.120 --> 3:55:45.120]  but that's false that's not true
[3:55:45.120 --> 3:55:47.120]  and you're not educating viewers
[3:55:47.120 --> 3:55:49.120]  viewers need to understand like
[3:55:49.120 --> 3:55:51.120]  this is what's going on now take what you want
[3:55:51.120 --> 3:55:53.120]  from it and make it your own
[3:55:53.120 --> 3:55:55.120]  instead of being forced a narrative
[3:55:55.120 --> 3:55:57.120]  that this is who he is this is what he's about
[3:55:57.120 --> 3:55:59.120]  this is what's going on and this is the reality
[3:55:59.120 --> 3:56:01.120]  we can impeach him no we really can't
[3:56:01.120 --> 3:56:03.120]  so that's incredible
[3:56:03.120 --> 3:56:05.120]  well we could as republicans but no
[3:56:05.120 --> 3:56:07.120]  democratic liberals no you can't
[3:56:07.120 --> 3:56:09.120]  um you would have to have
[3:56:09.120 --> 3:56:11.120]  some control
[3:56:11.120 --> 3:56:13.120]  in you know the three positions you don't hold
[3:56:13.120 --> 3:56:15.120]  one you don't hold two you don't hold three
[3:56:15.120 --> 3:56:17.120]  so pretty much it's you know
[3:56:17.120 --> 3:56:19.120]  one of the two positions sorry not three but
[3:56:19.120 --> 3:56:21.120]  but my question is do you think they're
[3:56:21.120 --> 3:56:23.120]  buying what they're selling or do you think they're
[3:56:23.120 --> 3:56:25.120]  strictly doing it because they want attention
[3:56:25.120 --> 3:56:27.120]  no no no I think I think I think that
[3:56:27.120 --> 3:56:29.120]  they do want attention I do think they're buying
[3:56:29.120 --> 3:56:31.120]  what they're selling okay okay you know
[3:56:31.120 --> 3:56:33.120]  for me I won't even repeat her name
[3:56:33.120 --> 3:56:35.120]  I kid you not I own every album
[3:56:35.120 --> 3:56:37.120]  of hers went to every concert I will
[3:56:37.120 --> 3:56:39.120]  never buy a single thing from Madonna
[3:56:39.120 --> 3:56:41.120]  go ahead and say Madonna
[3:56:41.120 --> 3:56:43.120]  I don't know
[3:56:43.120 --> 3:56:45.120]  I was a fan of Madonna too I see her too
[3:56:45.120 --> 3:56:47.120]  I know I was a fan of Madonna
[3:56:47.120 --> 3:56:49.120]  I saw Madonna's concerts and she's gone
[3:56:49.120 --> 3:56:51.120]  completely crazy and she's desperate
[3:56:51.120 --> 3:56:53.120]  no well it might not even be her there's plenty
[3:56:53.120 --> 3:56:55.120]  of them but when you're talking
[3:56:55.120 --> 3:56:57.120]  about um our White House I mean
[3:56:57.120 --> 3:56:59.120]  by the way that's the people's house
[3:56:59.120 --> 3:57:01.120]  are you forgetting that that doesn't belong to
[3:57:01.120 --> 3:57:03.120]  Donald Trump that belongs to the people that belongs
[3:57:03.120 --> 3:57:05.120]  to everything that these incredible
[3:57:05.120 --> 3:57:07.120]  men and women have
[3:57:07.120 --> 3:57:09.120]  built through our nation and through the years
[3:57:09.120 --> 3:57:11.120]  our constitution
[3:57:11.120 --> 3:57:13.120]  our values
[3:57:13.120 --> 3:57:15.120]  it was lunacy to hear
[3:57:15.120 --> 3:57:17.120]  that come out of her mouth
[3:57:17.120 --> 3:57:19.120]  and think that that was you know I guess
[3:57:19.120 --> 3:57:21.120]  you can't buy class so that just shows
[3:57:21.120 --> 3:57:23.120]  there right there as much
[3:57:23.120 --> 3:57:25.120]  as you want to marry a British guy
[3:57:25.120 --> 3:57:27.120]  and you've made hundreds of millions of dollars
[3:57:27.120 --> 3:57:29.120]  you can't buy class you're still
[3:57:29.120 --> 3:57:31.120]  a trashy girl from Michigan and so
[3:57:31.120 --> 3:57:33.120]  bottom line is is that
[3:57:33.120 --> 3:57:35.120]  you gotta be aware of what's
[3:57:35.120 --> 3:57:37.120]  going on in our country there are millions
[3:57:37.120 --> 3:57:39.120]  of Americans right now that are hungry
[3:57:39.120 --> 3:57:41.120]  and that are broke there are
[3:57:41.120 --> 3:57:43.120]  millions of American soldiers that have fought
[3:57:43.120 --> 3:57:45.120]  for our nation that can't get proper health care
[3:57:45.120 --> 3:57:47.120]  through the VA and
[3:57:47.120 --> 3:57:49.120]  also living on the street
[3:57:49.120 --> 3:57:51.120]  I mean at what point are we gonna
[3:57:51.120 --> 3:57:53.120]  say human trafficking is an issue for
[3:57:53.120 --> 3:57:55.120]  our country our veterans
[3:57:55.120 --> 3:57:57.120]  not being taken care of correctly is an issue
[3:57:57.120 --> 3:57:59.120]  for our country our men and women
[3:57:59.120 --> 3:58:01.120]  blue collar men and women are not
[3:58:01.120 --> 3:58:03.120]  able to obtain jobs
[3:58:03.120 --> 3:58:05.120]  we've gone everywhere else in the world
[3:58:05.120 --> 3:58:07.120]  and it's hurting us now
[3:58:07.120 --> 3:58:09.120]  this is what the what everyone doesn't
[3:58:09.120 --> 3:58:11.120]  understand is the world actually likes Trump
[3:58:11.120 --> 3:58:13.120]  because everywhere we go they go
[3:58:13.120 --> 3:58:15.120]  oh you guys are the world police and he's now
