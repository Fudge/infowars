[00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:09.197]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.197 --> 00:00:10.759]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:11.680]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.525]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.525 --> 00:00:20.570]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:29.373]  Well, we're into our number two simulcasting the syndicated radio transmission at PrisonPlanet.tv and Living Color.
[00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:40.747]  Joining us from Minnesota, he's about to travel down to Mexico to do some surfing, is former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, of course a star of films like
[00:00:41.247 --> 00:00:45.150]  The Running Man, Predator, and many other films.
[00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.453]  He's hosted a MSNBC national television show.
[00:00:49.453 --> 00:00:51.794]  He's hosted NFL football.
[00:00:51.794 --> 00:00:53.956]  There's not much this guy hadn't done.
[00:00:53.956 --> 00:00:55.537]  And now he's got a huge show.
[00:00:55.537 --> 00:00:58.079]  They're saying it's going to be their big push in the winter.
[00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.640]  Their big number one promoted show.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.361]  And I'm seeing that now in the media.
[00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:05.683]  Uh, that's Conspiracy Theory, created by Jesse Ventura.
[00:01:05.683 --> 00:01:06.784]  I'm a consultant on it.
[00:01:06.784 --> 00:01:07.865]  I'm in some of the episodes.
[00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:10.306]  I'm very honored to be involved in it.
[00:01:10.306 --> 00:01:13.889]  And to give you the inside scoop, he starts the media blitz tomorrow.
[00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:17.651]  To give you the inside scoop, is Jesse Ventura with us for the next hour.
[00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:22.074]  We may twist his arm a little bit in the next hour to take some phone calls, but we'll see.
[00:01:22.074 --> 00:01:24.135]  Governor, it is good to have you here with us.
[00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:28.297]  Hi Alex, great to be here again.
[00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:30.499]  I guess I should call you Huggy Bear.
[00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:35.652]  And I'll explain that for a moment.
[00:01:35.652 --> 00:01:38.093]  Alex has been good enough.
[00:01:38.093 --> 00:01:42.295]  He appears in a couple of the episodes of Conspiracy Theory that we did.
[00:01:42.295 --> 00:01:52.519]  And so, because he's the only really reoccurring character we've ever had in the first initial bite, we went back to the old Starsky and Hutch show.
[00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:54.480]  And y'all remember Huggy Bear, don't you?
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.262]  The guy that always brought the information to Starsky and Hutch?
[00:01:58.262 --> 00:01:58.482]  Yes.
[00:01:58.482 --> 00:02:00.402]  Well, that's you now, Alex.
[00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:01.563]  So you are Huggy Bear.
[00:02:02.853 --> 00:02:06.195]  Well, I'm honored to be your huggy bear.
[00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:08.617]  You've not been able to talk about the show till now.
[00:02:08.617 --> 00:02:10.238]  They've unleashed you.
[00:02:10.238 --> 00:02:24.267]  You barely talked about it on Larry King Live last week, but now you've been given the green light to give people a foretaste or an idea of what's going to be in the seven episodes.
[00:02:24.267 --> 00:02:25.728]  And so we're all ears, Governor.
[00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:27.129]  I mean, tell us about some of the episodes.
[00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:40.519]  Well, first of all, when I went on Larry, it was because, you know, it was election night and Larry truly wanted my opinion on the latest off-year elections, which I'll do this right now.
[00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.241]  To me, why do we even have off-year elections?
[00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:46.103]  It's hard enough to get people out there to vote.
[00:02:46.103 --> 00:02:48.105]  I have them all on here.
[00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:53.109]  They do that so that they get a small voter turnout because it's easier to control small numbers.
[00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:55.970]  And so that's why that happens, pretty much.
[00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:12.374]  But that being said, that's why I was on Larry was mainly for the election stuff, not so much a promotion of the show, because I'll be going back on Larry later on the end of the month, right when it gets to the debut date, which of course is December the 2nd on the True Channel.
[00:03:13.654 --> 00:03:15.796]  I don't want to stop you.
[00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:26.065]  I want you to have free flow and go over as much as you can tell us about the episodes because I've consulted some but I still only have a few pieces of the overall puzzle
[00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:49.445]  And I know that you've stated that you believe this is fair and from our perspective, probably the first television show ever that's actually from people who questions perspective.
[00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:53.529]  That doesn't mean that you or I or anybody buys all of what's being said out there.
[00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:56.051]  So I want to talk about that when we come back in just a minute.
[00:03:56.051 --> 00:04:03.859]  But in the one minute we've got, what is your take on Republicans sweeping all over the country and Obama's plunging approval rating?
[00:04:04.463 --> 00:04:08.506]  Well, I don't think it's so much Republicans sweeping.
[00:04:08.506 --> 00:04:15.510]  As you know, they lost that congressional race up in that heavily Republican district in New York that hadn't got Democrats.
[00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.231]  Yeah, but the Democrats threw that.
[00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:17.911]  They threw that.
[00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:19.932]  I mean, they had their... Well, maybe so.
[00:04:19.932 --> 00:04:22.714]  Well, to me, the elections are truly irrelevant.
[00:04:22.714 --> 00:04:28.698]  And as far as Obama's ratings falling, that's a natural occurrence.
[00:04:28.698 --> 00:04:33.701]  You know, I don't want to throw water on the fire or anything for those people, you know, for whatever reason.
[00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:38.082]  I, at one time, had 72% approval ratings.
[00:04:38.082 --> 00:04:44.043]  Well, certainly by the time you get out of office, mine actually dipped below 50 later.
[00:04:44.043 --> 00:04:45.724]  No, no, you're right!
[00:04:45.724 --> 00:04:55.946]  When you have to make hard decisions, when you make those hard decisions, some people aren't going to like it, and a lot of people are one-issue people.
[00:04:55.946 --> 00:04:57.807]  Jesse, we got a break.
[00:04:57.807 --> 00:04:58.367]  We got a break.
[00:04:58.367 --> 00:04:58.867]  Stay right there.
[00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:02.551]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:06.175]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:10.760]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.367]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[00:05:16.627 --> 00:05:21.411]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:05:21.411 --> 00:05:25.034]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:05:25.034 --> 00:05:29.838]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:05:29.838 --> 00:05:36.424]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:05:36.424 --> 00:05:38.366]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:05:38.846 --> 00:05:42.049]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:46.554]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:48.776]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:05:48.776 --> 00:05:49.077]  877-327-0365.
[00:05:49.077 --> 00:05:49.777]  Don't wait, call today!
[00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:02.897]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:06:02.897 --> 00:06:08.222]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:06:08.222 --> 00:06:10.283]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:06:10.283 --> 00:06:15.287]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:06:15.287 --> 00:06:16.188]  How much do you want?
[00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:17.569]  When do you want it?
[00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:19.471]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:20.531]  When will you need it?
[00:06:20.531 --> 00:06:22.733]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:06:22.733 --> 00:06:24.074]  Will there be any food?
[00:06:24.074 --> 00:06:25.616]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:30.880]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.463]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:06:34.463 --> 00:06:37.926]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:06:38.266 --> 00:06:39.507]  How much will you need?
[00:06:39.507 --> 00:06:40.407]  We don't know.
[00:06:40.407 --> 00:06:41.488]  How much do you want?
[00:06:41.488 --> 00:06:42.429]  All you can get.
[00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:43.529]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:46.571]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:06:46.571 --> 00:06:48.352]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:48.352 --> 00:06:49.273]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:58.843 --> 00:07:04.150]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.676]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:07:08.676 --> 00:07:10.959]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:12.581]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:13.623]  There is a solution.
[00:07:13.843 --> 00:07:22.272]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:07:22.272 --> 00:07:29.720]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:10.131]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:11.711]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:13.271]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:17.452]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.452 --> 00:08:22.453]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.453 --> 00:08:29.174]  Well, surf's up, ladies and gentlemen, and here comes Jesse Ventura into the Info War.
[00:08:29.174 --> 00:08:32.675]  Coming up in early December, the launch of his long-awaited
[00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:53.469]  television show conspiracy theory on true tv here to tell us dates and times and inside details first on this radio show when jesse called me back friday evening and said okay i'll do your show first i was extremely honored and so governor i really do appreciate uh you coming here first to talk about it i know the media blitz starts
[00:08:53.749 --> 00:08:54.089]  I'm back!
[00:09:10.535 --> 00:09:13.758]  Yeah, that's true, Alex, but it's gonna happen, you know.
[00:09:13.758 --> 00:09:17.742]  The honeymoon wears off, the hard decisions have to be made.
[00:09:17.742 --> 00:09:23.669]  People many times disagree with those tough decisions, and your approval rating starts to fall.
[00:09:23.669 --> 00:09:26.872]  The positive for me, the way I always looked at it, was like this.
[00:09:26.872 --> 00:09:30.476]  I was in a three-way race, not a two-way race.
[00:09:31.276 --> 00:09:32.578]  I won with only 37%.
[00:09:32.578 --> 00:09:40.887]  So even if my approval say fell all the way to 45, that was still 8 points higher than what I won with.
[00:09:40.887 --> 00:09:42.989]  He had to have been lower than 39.
[00:09:53.473 --> 00:09:55.415]  Yeah, some approval ratings had him at 25.
[00:09:55.415 --> 00:09:56.296]  I mean, there's so many polls.
[00:09:56.296 --> 00:09:59.499]  Well, I would guess he would tie with the hardcore Republicans.
[00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:05.025]  In the end, I can't see him even getting over 30% approval rating.
[00:10:05.025 --> 00:10:07.948]  That's just a political gift from his party.
[00:10:09.128 --> 00:10:09.608]  Exactly.
[00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:16.334]  I know that the overall Congress, both parties, had an 11% when he left office, and it's now going back down that direction again.
[00:10:16.334 --> 00:10:24.680]  My point is, Obama's approval rating has broken records, according to the major pollsters, for falling the fastest in the first year of a new administration.
[00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:28.465]  And now he's losing his base.
[00:10:28.465 --> 00:10:34.273]  CBS News last night reported he is putting in 40,000 more troops in Afghanistan.
[00:10:34.273 --> 00:10:37.458]  And Jesse, I know you've researched this and are well-read on this subject.
[00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:39.441]  Let's talk about this right now and then get into the show.
[00:10:40.402 --> 00:10:53.106]  There's 12 times the opium, 12 times coming out of Afghanistan, of what was coming out 8 years ago, and even the BBC admits our troops are guarding the opium so, quote, the Taliban doesn't get it.
[00:10:53.106 --> 00:10:57.227]  No, that's so the banks can launder $500 billion in smack every year.
[00:10:57.227 --> 00:10:58.948]  Governor Ventura, your take on this war?
[00:10:58.948 --> 00:11:03.729]  Well, to me, welcome in my lifetime now.
[00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:05.109]  How wonderful it is.
[00:11:05.109 --> 00:11:06.710]  Welcome to another Vietnam.
[00:11:09.264 --> 00:11:10.605]  It's that simple.
[00:11:10.605 --> 00:11:12.426]  It's going to accomplish nothing.
[00:11:12.426 --> 00:11:18.369]  Guys are going to die over there on a constant basis as they have in Iraq.
[00:11:18.369 --> 00:11:21.231]  And, you know, welcome to another Vietnam.
[00:11:21.231 --> 00:11:26.714]  When this is all over and done with, I do it right now, Alex.
[00:11:26.714 --> 00:11:34.198]  I sit back and go, how is Jesse Ventura benefiting from these two wars?
[00:11:34.198 --> 00:11:35.479]  And I can't think of a thing.
[00:11:36.315 --> 00:11:42.919]  And yet, we've got people out there protesting whether people should be able to go see a doctor or not.
[00:11:42.919 --> 00:11:50.364]  If we wouldn't have fought these two wars, we'd have plenty of money for healthcare, wouldn't we?
[00:11:50.364 --> 00:11:52.045]  Absolutely!
[00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:59.850]  And my point is, wars are the most destructive thing mankind can do.
[00:12:00.663 --> 00:12:04.266]  And when he engages in them, it has no benefit.
[00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:14.976]  It's like Herman Goering said, the best thing a farmer can get out of a war is to be able to come back on the same farm he left before the war started.
[00:12:14.976 --> 00:12:16.637]  That's the best outcome.
[00:12:16.637 --> 00:12:17.998]  The very best.
[00:12:17.998 --> 00:12:20.881]  There will be nothing more than that.
[00:12:20.881 --> 00:12:24.724]  And when is this country going to wake up?
[00:12:24.724 --> 00:12:26.826]  You know, I sit back and I'm appalled.
[00:12:28.428 --> 00:12:32.492]  I can't say I'm speechless because I'm bitching about it right now.
[00:12:32.492 --> 00:12:41.299]  But I cannot believe that people aren't protesting these wars and now we're sending more troops in to accomplish what?
[00:12:41.299 --> 00:12:48.646]  The Russians couldn't win there and we're so stupid and our ego is so powerful that we think we can?
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:13:09.148]  They can't win the state of objective to bring democracy and freedom to Afghanistan, but if the objective is to destabilize the region and have bases to menace Iran and China, and if the state of objective, you know, the real objective is to launder drug proceeds, then it's mission accomplished.
[00:13:09.148 --> 00:13:10.569]  They just need to sit there.
[00:13:10.569 --> 00:13:15.091]  Well, if that's indeed what it is, Alex, then you will be, you're absolutely correct.
[00:13:15.091 --> 00:13:16.292]  It's mission accomplished.
[00:13:16.292 --> 00:13:18.133]  If that's what they're accomplishing out of this,
[00:13:18.873 --> 00:13:34.666]  I can't prove that that's what they are or aren't doing at this time, but certainly from a base perspective of Jesse Ventura, American citizen, I don't understand how I benefit by these wars one bit or any of the rest of us benefit by them one bit.
[00:13:35.166 --> 00:13:37.507]  Okay, here's an example, then we'll get into the TV show.
[00:13:37.507 --> 00:13:37.967]  Sure.
[00:13:37.967 --> 00:13:43.588]  I know you've been busy with, you know, producing the television show and flying all over the country, and we'll talk about that.
[00:13:43.588 --> 00:13:44.948]  You are really working hard on this.
[00:13:44.948 --> 00:13:47.729]  A lot of work, a lot of time, a lot of energy, a lot of money.
[00:13:47.729 --> 00:13:51.169]  Harder than I wanted.
[00:13:51.169 --> 00:13:59.191]  But at the same time, it came out two weeks ago, New York Times, that Mohammed Karzai's brother is the head opium kingpin in Afghanistan.
[00:14:00.049 --> 00:14:10.616]  And that he is a CIA operative on CIA payroll, and that basically so is Mohammed Karzai, and that our troops are guarding his poppy fields.
[00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:17.360]  And I was driving down the road a few months ago and heard BBC report the same thing before the New York Times did, and I already knew that!
[00:14:18.303 --> 00:14:26.826]  But to hear them report that, oh, we guard the opium because if we don't guard it, another Taliban group will get it and then they'll get too much power.
[00:14:26.826 --> 00:14:27.926]  That's what they're telling the troops.
[00:14:27.926 --> 00:14:29.667]  We guard the opium to win the war.
[00:14:29.667 --> 00:14:31.588]  You know the CIA got caught with opium in
[00:14:33.306 --> 00:14:35.107]  In Southeast Asia and Vietnam.
[00:14:35.107 --> 00:14:37.507]  We're now in Colombia putting bases in.
[00:14:37.507 --> 00:14:49.810]  Anywhere there's drugs, our troops are there to eradicate the other guy's drugs and protect the drug kingpins that launder their money through US and European banks.
[00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:59.473]  And add to that the fact that that's how the CIA gets their revenue so that they can then do operations that they can keep away from Congress.
[00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:11.758]  Because if they have to do operations that require them to get money from our tax money, then they have to be forward enough to let Congress know what they're doing with the money.
[00:15:11.758 --> 00:15:27.269]  But if they're getting money via illegal drugs, and making all sorts of money out of that end of the world, they then don't have to declare any of that to Congress, and that's when they can do these dirty jobs that the American public will never know about.
[00:15:28.058 --> 00:15:31.619]  Governor Jesse Ventura, that is the nail on the head.
[00:15:31.619 --> 00:15:32.299]  Absolutely.
[00:15:32.299 --> 00:15:34.219]  I hadn't even thought to make that point.
[00:15:34.219 --> 00:15:44.221]  All those tens of billions in unaccountable money that these private... That's how they run their operations so that they don't have to be accountable to the Congress.
[00:15:44.221 --> 00:15:44.781]  Absolutely.
[00:15:44.781 --> 00:15:55.363]  In fact, in 96, that came out on C-SPAN with the CIA Inspector General testifying that the CIA brought in the crack cocaine epidemic.
[00:15:58.536 --> 00:16:00.657]  Well, that I don't know.
[00:16:00.657 --> 00:16:02.258]  Do you know about that, Alex?
[00:16:02.258 --> 00:16:02.818]  I don't.
[00:16:02.818 --> 00:16:06.160]  I can only speak to what I know about.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.362]  And, you know, you're better well read on it than I am.
[00:16:10.515 --> 00:16:12.998]  Well no, I mean, you know as much or more than I do.
[00:16:12.998 --> 00:16:16.481]  You just brought up the key point that they're funding their black operations with this.
[00:16:16.481 --> 00:16:20.165]  Oh yeah, no, I've felt that and known that for a long, long time.
[00:16:20.165 --> 00:16:22.567]  That that's the simple way to do it.
[00:16:22.567 --> 00:16:24.650]  That's how you keep it out of the public eye.
[00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:31.637]  That's how you can get money to do political assassinations like in the old days when they used to attempt to kill Castro.
[00:16:32.648 --> 00:16:33.848]  Okay, I'm going to shut up.
[00:16:33.848 --> 00:16:41.871]  If they do that, if they get money from Congress, then they have to submit reports and it has to be far more above board.
[00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:52.934]  But if they get the money from somewhere else, which can be dirty drug money, well then they can spend it on any operations they want to do and they don't have to be accountable to the American public or the Congress for it.
[00:16:54.045 --> 00:16:54.585]  Absolutely.
[00:16:54.585 --> 00:16:58.268]  Governor, we've got you here to talk about the TV show, so I'm going to stop getting off on other issues.
[00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:05.973]  I apologize, but it's always interesting to hear your truthful perspective, because you're absolutely right on those issues.
[00:17:05.973 --> 00:17:08.094]  Where to start with the TV show?
[00:17:08.094 --> 00:17:15.019]  I mean, I've seen the one promo clip where you went out to harp, and they threatened to arrest you, and then suddenly the equipment went dead.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.804]  Let's go through the seven episodes and give people an idea of what's coming up.
[00:17:19.804 --> 00:17:22.807]  Well, hopefully I can remember them all.
[00:17:22.807 --> 00:17:30.435]  I'll tell you, it was so hectic shooting them that sometimes I had to jump from one episode to another episode.
[00:17:31.136 --> 00:17:32.318]  What's your favorite episode?
[00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:33.639]  I would say my favorite one would be 9-11.
[00:17:49.326 --> 00:18:01.815]  Because I think 9-11 was the original one that I took to the two TV people to sell them on the show, and so it was personal to me because of my investigation of it so far.
[00:18:01.815 --> 00:18:07.459]  So I would have to say that that one is the most satisfying, although they all are, pretty much.
[00:18:07.459 --> 00:18:09.341]  And I'll put it to you this way.
[00:18:09.341 --> 00:18:12.123]  The way that I'm going to explain it is quite simple, Alex.
[00:18:12.683 --> 00:18:19.748]  People can choose to believe the conspiracies or not, all seven of these, and they're all fairly modern day.
[00:18:19.748 --> 00:18:29.375]  The one thing True Channel wanted to do, we don't go back to Kennedy, we don't go back, they wanted to keep this first series within the last decade, pretty much.
[00:18:29.375 --> 00:18:37.661]  And you can choose to believe them or you can choose not to believe them, but I'll guarantee you this, if you watch the show, you're going to get scared.
[00:18:39.879 --> 00:18:48.621]  Even if they're not true, there is still the element that they may be, they might be, and they could be.
[00:18:48.621 --> 00:18:50.442]  And maybe they are.
[00:18:50.442 --> 00:18:53.543]  And that should be enough to wake people up and scare them.
[00:18:53.543 --> 00:18:58.124]  This is the first show that I've ever done in my career where I got scared.
[00:18:58.124 --> 00:18:59.484]  And I don't get scared easy.
[00:19:01.178 --> 00:19:08.766]  I remember a few weeks ago, I ran into you and we were checking in at the hotel and you walked up and you were shaking your head and you said, Alex.
[00:19:08.766 --> 00:19:12.730]  You were there with your son Tyrell, who's working on the show as well, doing a great job.
[00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:17.355]  You walked up and you said, Alex, when I go to bed at night, my head's spinning with all this information.
[00:19:17.355 --> 00:19:18.756]  This stuff is scary.
[00:19:18.756 --> 00:19:19.077]  Oh yeah.
[00:19:19.838 --> 00:19:29.769]  No, we went into some places that you think is only fantasy land, but it could very well be reality land.
[00:19:29.769 --> 00:19:34.694]  It's stuff that people don't even think about, don't deal with in their daily lives.
[00:19:34.694 --> 00:19:36.316]  That's one of the main things is people
[00:19:36.896 --> 00:19:57.945]  People out there have to earn a living, they have to make a living for their families, so they haven't got time to go delving into the underhanded stuff that government might be doing, and it's interesting, Alex, that we started this show with the concept that we were going to show both sides of the conspiracy, and then allow the viewer to make a choice at the end of which one he or she would choose to believe.
[00:19:57.945 --> 00:19:58.626]  Hold it there!
[00:19:58.626 --> 00:19:59.206]  Gotta break up!

[00:21:07.929 --> 00:21:09.550]  You should use Startpage instead.

[00:21:59.344 --> 00:22:06.008]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:06.008 --> 00:22:14.132]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:19.715]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:22:20.035 --> 00:22:22.297]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:22:22.297 --> 00:22:27.401]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:27.401 --> 00:22:32.605]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:32.605 --> 00:22:36.968]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:36.968 --> 00:22:38.049]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:22:58.795 --> 00:23:05.760]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[00:24:08.128 --> 00:24:08.474]  No matter!
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.721]  All right, going back to Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:23.541]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:25.162]  He'll be with us a little bit into the next hour.
[00:24:25.162 --> 00:24:34.545]  We're going to open the phones up specifically only for Governor Jesse Ventura at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:34.545 --> 00:24:36.905]  Quick question or comment for the governor coming up.
[00:24:36.905 --> 00:24:40.486]  Okay, you got cut off again by the satellite making us go to break.
[00:24:40.486 --> 00:24:45.708]  Start over, start over governor with the point that you were making about the TV show.
[00:24:46.588 --> 00:24:54.574]  Initially, Alex, we started off to do the show with the concept that both sides of the conspiracy would be told, if there were two sides.
[00:24:54.574 --> 00:24:57.797]  Many times there may be multiple sides.
[00:24:57.797 --> 00:25:00.959]  But the two major sides, and then we'd let the viewer decide.
[00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:12.689]  Well, then the show had to go through a metamorphosis, if you will, or an evolution, whatever you want to call it, because when one side does not cooperate one bit, it is pretty hard to tell their story.
[00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:16.271]  And that was the case of the United States government.
[00:25:16.271 --> 00:25:25.417]  I did an interview the other day, a print interview, and the person asked me, and I said, well, you know, the government hasn't cooperated at all.
[00:25:25.417 --> 00:25:28.379]  And they said, this includes when Obama's taken over.
[00:25:28.379 --> 00:25:29.700]  I said, there's been no difference.
[00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:42.351]  I said it hasn't made one bit of difference, because we started the show, George Bush was still the president, and the show's been in the works, and I've been working on it for a year now, basically, or better.
[00:25:42.351 --> 00:25:45.652]  And the government cooperated nothing.
[00:25:45.652 --> 00:25:46.492]  Zero.
[00:25:46.492 --> 00:25:47.412]  Zilch.
[00:25:47.412 --> 00:25:50.692]  We could not even get a spokesperson out for the government.
[00:25:50.692 --> 00:25:59.594]  Well, we do get a few former government people who are now no longer working for the government, who had courage enough to come out and talk to us and offer their opinions.
[00:26:00.234 --> 00:26:04.477]  But no one under the government would cooperate with this show at all.
[00:26:04.477 --> 00:26:18.808]  So then the show became simply more of the other side of the conspiracy being told, and now the viewer gets to see an alternative to what the government has pumped out in many occasions on the different conspiracies that they're involved with.
[00:26:19.188 --> 00:26:28.255]  And by the way, we've got Governor Jesse Ventura with us talking about the new TV show that's coming up in December and January called Conspiracy Theory on TruTV.
[00:26:28.255 --> 00:26:30.677]  Again, Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[00:26:30.677 --> 00:26:33.179]  How much can you tell us about the 9-11 episode?
[00:26:33.179 --> 00:26:39.143]  Because I know that more and more as you went out and tried to talk to them, no one would.
[00:26:39.143 --> 00:26:42.166]  And Jesse Ventura, Navy SEAL, Governor,
[00:26:42.887 --> 00:26:46.450]  In many ways, Michael Moore probably got more cooperation than I got.
[00:27:01.755 --> 00:27:02.835]  Well, let folks in a little bit.
[00:27:02.835 --> 00:27:03.715]  I got none.
[00:27:03.715 --> 00:27:05.116]  I got none.
[00:27:05.116 --> 00:27:10.057]  When it came to 9-11, no one from the government would talk to the show.
[00:27:10.057 --> 00:27:13.958]  No one from the 9-11 Commission would talk.
[00:27:13.958 --> 00:27:17.479]  No one representing any type of government agency would talk.
[00:27:17.479 --> 00:27:25.041]  You know, I don't want to wreck the show by saying what we did and where we did it and do all that because I want people to watch the show.
[00:27:25.041 --> 00:27:28.982]  The show came about like this.
[00:27:28.982 --> 00:27:30.422]  A victim came to me.
[00:27:31.579 --> 00:27:39.023]  And a victim pleaded with me, a victim who lost her daughter and her potential grandchild.
[00:27:39.023 --> 00:27:45.266]  Her daughter was pregnant and she died the day, the infamous day of 9-11.
[00:27:45.266 --> 00:27:54.832]  And her mom, you know, came to me feeling that I was the person with this show who could bring to light the fact that we need a real investigation of 9-11.
[00:27:56.238 --> 00:27:56.678]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:28:17.597 --> 00:28:18.157]  Unbelievable!
[00:28:34.349 --> 00:28:37.590]  Again, I don't want to give away too much, but... Well, I want people to watch.
[00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.410]  That's why I'm just going to talk.
[00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:48.712]  I'm not going to give specifics of the show, Alex, because I want everyone to enjoy the show, and I won't narrate it before it goes on the air.
[00:28:48.712 --> 00:28:49.692]  No, no, no.
[00:28:49.692 --> 00:28:55.293]  You're giving us a lot here, and I know a lot of the inside baseball, and obviously I'm sworn to secrecy.
[00:28:55.293 --> 00:29:01.374]  I'm just telling folks, I'm surprised you're able to get this on air, Jesse, because... Well, Alex, it ain't on yet.
[00:29:05.912 --> 00:29:11.455]  I made a gentleman's bet at the start of this show that it would never see air.
[00:29:11.455 --> 00:29:20.661]  I felt we would complete them all, but I felt strongly that at some point in time someone wouldn't allow it, and so far it's full steam ahead.
[00:29:20.661 --> 00:29:31.027]  Now, we do have to wait until December 2nd because that's the airing again of the first show, which is, you know, that's a couple weeks away yet, three weeks away.
[00:29:31.027 --> 00:29:33.349]  In fact, I remember in October,
[00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:44.866]  You were in my car, we were driving around in the hill country, and you said, Alex, we're going to find out if this airs, because I'm going to do this from my perspective and be fair, we're going to see what happens.
[00:29:44.866 --> 00:29:50.069]  And you've put incredible work into it, and now you've just upped the bar again, saying we'll see.
[00:29:50.069 --> 00:29:54.011]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.011 --> 00:29:56.673]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:03.502]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:30:03.502 --> 00:30:06.364]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:30:06.364 --> 00:30:07.644]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:30:07.644 --> 00:30:08.465]  It's very real.
[00:30:08.465 --> 00:30:10.706]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:30:10.706 --> 00:30:12.347]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:30:12.347 --> 00:30:16.829]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:30:59.158 --> 00:31:03.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.620]  Number one.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:08.062]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.062 --> 00:31:08.922]  Number two.
[00:31:08.922 --> 00:31:13.804]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:13.804 --> 00:31:14.544]  It's true.
[00:31:14.544 --> 00:31:19.106]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:19.406 --> 00:31:20.247]  Number 3.
[00:31:20.247 --> 00:31:23.830]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:27.754]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:27.754 --> 00:31:28.534]  Number 4.
[00:31:28.534 --> 00:31:31.297]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.297 --> 00:31:34.980]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:35.781]  Number 5.
[00:31:35.781 --> 00:31:39.925]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:39.925 --> 00:31:44.689]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:49.134]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:33:12.451 --> 00:33:24.484]  Well, former Minnesota governor, former MSNBC host, former top wrestler, Hollywood movie star, author, best-selling author, multiple times over, and surfer,
[00:33:25.623 --> 00:33:27.106]  Jesse Ventura joins us.
[00:33:27.106 --> 00:33:28.228]  The surf is up.
[00:33:28.228 --> 00:33:28.669]  He is here.
[00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:30.212]  Okay, let's go through this then.
[00:33:30.212 --> 00:33:31.755]  Wait a minute, Alex.
[00:33:31.755 --> 00:33:35.342]  How's the surf since that storm has hit Alabama down there?
[00:33:36.098 --> 00:33:36.838]  You know what?
[00:33:36.838 --> 00:33:42.882]  I hear that there is a huge surf down at the Gulf right now, and every time I go down there, there's surfers everywhere.
[00:33:42.882 --> 00:33:45.703]  Well, I should be down there right now, doggonit.
[00:33:45.703 --> 00:33:57.930]  Why don't you just jump on an airplane, fly... Listen, you can fly to Corpus Christi in two hours from Minnesota, and three and a half, four hours from now, you could be on the beach in 12-foot swells.
[00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:03.193]  Well, I'll tell you, that's very tempting, but unfortunately, I've got too much publicity to do.
[00:34:04.503 --> 00:34:07.345]  Unfortunately, you're here on air with us, but we're all happy, Governor.
[00:34:07.345 --> 00:34:11.028]  Well, it'd be tomorrow anyway, and so I got publicity all day tomorrow.
[00:34:11.028 --> 00:34:16.332]  Today, I couldn't get there in time, so it'd have to be tomorrow, but oh well, we'll pass on it this time.
[00:34:16.332 --> 00:34:20.736]  I'm certain there'll be more storms, especially after learning about HAARP.
[00:34:20.736 --> 00:34:21.896]  Absolutely.
[00:34:21.896 --> 00:34:34.166]  You know, I had the director of HAARP on one time, and he admitted, oh, we turned the atmosphere on fire with it at night, and he starts laughing, and then somebody on the line cut the line off, and my producer saw this, and during the break,
[00:34:34.901 --> 00:34:45.145]  Well, what's interesting, and of course for those that don't know what HAARP is, HAARP is way up in Alaska, and that's one of the shows.
[00:34:45.145 --> 00:34:47.526]  We go up to visit it and photograph it.
[00:34:54.563 --> 00:35:02.469]  And it's a group of about 180 radio antennas that all shoot 50,000 watts of energy up into the biosphere.
[00:35:02.469 --> 00:35:09.515]  I should say of low frequency sounds up into the biosphere, which does cause a heating.
[00:35:09.515 --> 00:35:12.978]  Now Alex, let me ask you this.
[00:35:12.978 --> 00:35:15.500]  Could that possibly contribute to global warming?
[00:35:16.966 --> 00:35:17.686]  Absolutely!
[00:35:17.686 --> 00:35:26.508]  In fact, the scientists we've interviewed... This could be much more contributor of global warming than us driving our cars around.
[00:35:26.508 --> 00:35:36.011]  Well, as you know, Secretary of Defense Cohen in 97 admitted to the Army Times they did have weather weapons then, and I've interviewed the former father of weather weapons, Ben Livingston,
[00:35:36.778 --> 00:35:39.920]  And clearly, I believe this is a false flag attack.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:47.386]  We have had a lot of strange weather, and that naturally occurs, but there's been a lot of... Well, that's gonna be, that's the opening show, Alex.
[00:35:47.386 --> 00:35:53.370]  The opening show, December 2nd, is on HAARP, and I think people are gonna find it a very interesting show.
[00:35:53.370 --> 00:36:05.039]  I went all the way up to Alaska, and went to this location, and we jumped into a helicopter, and bear this in mind, this thing could knock airplanes out of the air.
[00:36:07.726 --> 00:36:13.007]  And, uh, it's a very interesting thing going on up there.
[00:36:13.007 --> 00:36:19.929]  It's, the government, it falls under, let me put it this way, it falls under the military, the Air Force.
[00:36:19.929 --> 00:36:27.191]  And yet, it is given the distinction of being an unclassified research center, yet I was not allowed in.
[00:36:27.191 --> 00:36:33.273]  Now, bear in mind, I used to have a top-secret security clearance with the United States government.
[00:36:33.979 --> 00:36:49.224]  During my six years as a member of Underwater Demolition Team 12 and Seal Team 1, I was also a mayor and a governor, and yet I was not allowed to go into this supposed unclassified research center.
[00:36:49.224 --> 00:36:53.065]  If it's unclassified, anybody should be able to go in there.
[00:36:55.273 --> 00:36:56.494]  Well, that's a good point.
[00:36:56.494 --> 00:37:03.041]  Jesse, on this specific subject, we can get into more detail because this has been released to the media.
[00:37:03.041 --> 00:37:05.464]  I want to play this clip and then ask you about it.
[00:37:05.464 --> 00:37:10.309]  This is a one-minute clip of Governor Jesse Ventura being stopped at the gates.
[00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:13.773]  He's about to just, I guess, bull his way on in there.
[00:37:13.773 --> 00:37:15.275]  And suddenly,
[00:37:16.266 --> 00:37:17.666]  The equipment goes dead.
[00:37:17.666 --> 00:37:18.947]  And I talked to the crew.
[00:37:18.947 --> 00:37:21.667]  This really happened.
[00:37:21.667 --> 00:37:26.009]  So they were using some type of electronic warfare jamming system.
[00:37:26.009 --> 00:37:27.229]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:27.229 --> 00:37:29.069]  We really need to go through the Air Force.
[00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:30.370]  Well, we did.
[00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.730]  We got stonewalled.
[00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.531]  And this is strictly a research facility.
[00:37:34.531 --> 00:37:38.592]  Clearly, there's something going on here that they don't want people to know about.
[00:37:38.912 --> 00:37:41.314]  There's a lot of cool science that we do with this facility.
[00:37:41.314 --> 00:37:41.894]  Come on, man.
[00:37:41.894 --> 00:37:43.216]  I'm a Navy SEAL.
[00:37:43.216 --> 00:37:51.042]  The military don't do things unless it has a military purpose, and a military purpose is destruction and waging war.
[00:37:51.042 --> 00:37:52.623]  It's a stalemate.
[00:37:52.623 --> 00:37:54.224]  Or is it?
[00:37:54.224 --> 00:37:57.767]  Back up a little bit from the gate so when people come through, they don't feel intimidated.
[00:37:58.168 --> 00:38:02.271]  When I get denied something, I do the opposite of getting intimidated.
[00:38:02.271 --> 00:38:03.272]  I get angry.
[00:38:03.272 --> 00:38:08.236]  Jesse is about to walk right on through, when suddenly... Hold on a second, guys.
[00:38:08.236 --> 00:38:08.837]  I got a problem.
[00:38:08.837 --> 00:38:11.679]  I've got camera interference.
[00:38:11.679 --> 00:38:17.044]  The camera equipment begins to go haywire.
[00:38:17.044 --> 00:38:21.227]  Something is interfering with the audio and video.
[00:38:21.227 --> 00:38:22.888]  This is more than unclassified.
[00:38:22.888 --> 00:38:23.529]  That's bullshit.
[00:38:26.997 --> 00:38:29.298]  Alright, now that was, that aired on CNN.
[00:38:29.298 --> 00:38:32.659]  The potty language was cut out.
[00:38:32.659 --> 00:38:35.060]  But I don't blame the governor under that bizarre stress.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:39.862]  So, tell us what you can about the Harp episode, because this is amazing.
[00:38:39.862 --> 00:38:55.047]  Well, you know, we were denied access, as I said, and you know, even though the security clearances I've had in my life and holding the position of governor, I guess, Alex, the only way I guess I can get in there is to run and get re-elected to something again.
[00:38:55.894 --> 00:39:05.318]  You know, then maybe I would be high enough in the government that they would let me in and see what they're doing there, but that aside, uh, and then we did have some problem.
[00:39:05.318 --> 00:39:10.280]  Now, it made it seem, I don't know what caused our cameras to go bad.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:16.583]  I do, I am not going to specifically sit here and say that they jammed them, that they did something to them.
[00:39:16.583 --> 00:39:23.406]  I will simply state that our audio and our visual did have some problems while we were outside the gate.
[00:39:23.967 --> 00:39:28.239]  Who or what was responsible, we never were sure of.
[00:39:28.239 --> 00:39:30.786]  We never were sure or positively found out.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:44.629]  But to be specific, and correct me if I'm wrong, because I was just talking to some of the crew while we were shooting separately back in Los Angeles, they said that multiple cameras and audio and on the digital recordings, it was even distorting.
[00:39:44.629 --> 00:39:51.773]  I mean, this wasn't just one rig to have separate malfunctions, the same malfunctions.
[00:39:51.773 --> 00:39:54.735]  You're talking about one in a billion, one in a trillion?
[00:39:54.735 --> 00:39:55.736]  I mean, this is bizarre.
[00:39:56.116 --> 00:39:56.617]  I don't know.
[00:39:56.617 --> 00:39:58.138]  I don't know.
[00:39:58.138 --> 00:40:07.307]  But all I can say is that we did run into complications, and what caused them or why, we were never able to ascertain.
[00:40:07.307 --> 00:40:15.814]  And then later on, all the equipment later worked fine, and we never had any more problem with it the rest of the shoot.
[00:40:15.814 --> 00:40:19.538]  Well, I want to say, clearly on the record, that
[00:40:20.222 --> 00:40:24.263]  From the scientists we've interviewed, HAARP is designed to be a weapon.
[00:40:24.263 --> 00:40:25.844]  It can heat the atmosphere.
[00:40:25.844 --> 00:40:34.587]  It can direct those huge rivers of vapor, of condensation, of water, as weapons.
[00:40:34.587 --> 00:40:40.809]  And the Chinese brag, the Russians brag, you can hire their government-funded companies to control the weather for you.
[00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:43.970]  Let's remember something, too, Alex.
[00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:53.917]  There were treaties signed back in the 1970s that governments would not use weather or nature for war.
[00:40:53.917 --> 00:40:57.679]  And we were one of the people that signed these treaties.
[00:40:57.679 --> 00:41:00.741]  And I think that's an important issue right here.
[00:41:00.741 --> 00:41:11.188]  If we sign treaties that we won't use things, won't use nature to commit war, and then we might very well be violating the very treaties we've signed.
[00:41:12.509 --> 00:41:21.184]  Well that's a great point and you made the point to me privately that, well Alex, why are we signing treaties for weather weapons if they don't exist?
[00:41:21.184 --> 00:41:22.165]  That's true also.
[00:41:24.045 --> 00:41:42.606]  So, you know, and I think people are also going to enjoy, there's another part of Harp that we haven't mentioned today that will be the most terrifying of anything we've talked about, and I'm going to leave that up in the air, because Harp is going to be, to my knowledge, the first episode December 2nd, again,
[00:41:43.366 --> 00:41:45.548]  I know what it is, but I'm going to keep my mouth shut.
[00:42:05.467 --> 00:42:07.128]  Well, I did a gentleman's bet with my crew and cast, basically.
[00:42:07.128 --> 00:42:11.889]  I said, I bet you, no money involved, just a gentleman's bet, that we will complete all of these, we will do all seven episodes,
[00:42:35.556 --> 00:42:42.958]  Uh, and we'll finish the ball, but I said I still don't believe they will see the light of day that they will be aired.
[00:42:42.958 --> 00:42:49.999]  And so far I'm losing the gentleman's bet, but there's still about three weeks to go and I hope that I do lose it.
[00:42:49.999 --> 00:42:58.221]  I do not want, and I'm a competitive person, I do not like to lose anything, but I'm hoping that I lose this bet.
[00:42:58.221 --> 00:42:59.641]  I don't want to win this bet.
[00:43:01.508 --> 00:43:08.054]  Well, I hope that you do lose the bet as well, because I've been involved in a few TV productions.
[00:43:08.054 --> 00:43:09.415]  One of them... This way, Alex.
[00:43:09.415 --> 00:43:18.283]  If it doesn't see the light of day, this show, that we've completed, then I need to come back on your show and we need to ask why.
[00:43:18.283 --> 00:43:24.628]  We need to, at that point, start addressing, I believe, the First Amendment.
[00:43:24.628 --> 00:43:25.289]  I agree with you.
[00:43:26.144 --> 00:43:31.446]  Well, I don't see how they're going to air something that's more than fair from our perspective.
[00:43:31.446 --> 00:43:38.508]  And from what I've seen, and I know you're an honorable person, this is an extremely fair leaning towards our perspective.
[00:43:38.508 --> 00:43:43.469]  Because as you said, you couldn't get the other side to come out and debate.
[00:43:43.469 --> 00:43:44.990]  There's nothing but stonewalling.
[00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:46.972]  There isn't even a debate, Alex.
[00:43:46.972 --> 00:43:50.075]  We couldn't even get them to come out and make a comment.
[00:43:50.075 --> 00:43:53.599]  The government wouldn't talk to us, plain and simple.
[00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:55.381]  They wouldn't talk on HAARP.
[00:43:55.381 --> 00:43:57.503]  They wouldn't talk on 9-11.
[00:43:57.503 --> 00:44:06.233]  They wouldn't talk on anything that involved the government and their involvement in any type of conspiracy or whatever the conspiracy is.
[00:44:06.913 --> 00:44:11.577]  You cannot get anyone from government to participate or talk in any manner.
[00:44:11.577 --> 00:44:13.018]  It's that simple.
[00:44:13.018 --> 00:44:16.041]  And people need to understand that's the scary thing.
[00:44:16.041 --> 00:44:24.328]  Overwhelmingly scary thing about doing this whole show is the fact that government doesn't have to cooperate.
[00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:27.251]  They act like we work for them.
[00:44:27.251 --> 00:44:30.994]  And I believe they've forgotten something and we've forgotten something.
[00:44:30.994 --> 00:44:31.915]  They work for us.
[00:44:32.695 --> 00:44:34.716]  That's the way it's supposed to be.
[00:44:34.716 --> 00:44:38.138]  But in this country, I believe those roles have switched now.
[00:44:38.138 --> 00:44:44.902]  And the government views us working for them, rather than the way it's supposed to be.
[00:44:44.902 --> 00:44:52.807]  Well, that's just an incredible point, that things really are backwards now, in this nation, in this country.
[00:44:52.807 --> 00:44:59.391]  And if they do allow this to go on television, which it looks like it's going to happen, is that that the system is so arrogant?
[00:45:00.174 --> 00:45:02.659]  That they don't even care if we know the truth now?
[00:45:02.659 --> 00:45:14.038]  I'm seeing George Soros and Al Gore and Ban Ki-moon of the UN openly say we're going under world government, openly saying it's a new world order, openly stating it's about population reduction.
[00:45:14.987 --> 00:45:23.330]  One child policy, LA Times reports there's going to be a tax on owning a dog or cat because they eat meat, which has a carbon footprint.
[00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:26.211]  You've got the global warming episode, we're going to talk about that.
[00:45:26.211 --> 00:45:40.116]  I mean, they're really coming out in the open, so is it that they don't have total control of the media, and so you're getting through the chink in the armor, or is it they're so arrogant now, they don't care if Governor Ventura goes out and tells you how screwed you are?
[00:45:40.116 --> 00:45:43.978]  They might even sit back and, you know, roast some marshmallows and laugh at us.
[00:45:44.358 --> 00:45:45.659]  I don't know, Alex.
[00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:51.383]  I'm not in contact with any of these quote-unquote people, so I have no idea.
[00:45:51.383 --> 00:45:59.189]  Oh, by the way, yeah, global warming is the last one that I list to you of the, uh, we do a, is global warming a conspiracy?
[00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:04.933]  Yeah, we were both here trying to remember all seven episodes, and finally it came to me, so I thought I'd shout it out.
[00:46:04.933 --> 00:46:12.379]  Well, you got it right there, because that was the seventh one that I, like I said, when I shot these things, they were not in sequence, always.
[00:46:13.099 --> 00:46:15.440]  And so it can get pretty confusing.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:21.644]  It was a lot like governing, where you go from one meeting, one hour, to a completely different meeting the next hour.
[00:46:21.644 --> 00:46:26.166]  No, no, I know it makes your head spin, especially when you're really into the minutia.
[00:46:26.166 --> 00:46:32.449]  Let's get into 2012, then we'll get into secret societies, Manchurian candidate, big brother in global warming.
[00:46:32.449 --> 00:46:35.511]  2012, obviously, three days from now,
[00:46:36.485 --> 00:46:44.494]  On Friday, the huge movie is coming out where Woody Harrelson kind of plays the conspiracy theory type.
[00:46:44.494 --> 00:46:46.697]  I know Harrelson, so we're trying to get him on the show.
[00:46:46.697 --> 00:46:48.198]  In fact, that may happen.
[00:46:48.198 --> 00:46:54.906]  But what's your whole take on the real 2012 and the serious, in-depth research you did?
[00:46:54.906 --> 00:46:57.169]  And then separately in the show, I know you get into
[00:46:58.007 --> 00:47:04.230]  Well, it is, and let me just put it this way, and again, I'm not going to go in and make it so people won't watch by telling everything that happens, but
[00:47:21.498 --> 00:47:26.101]  Uh, it goes far beyond, let me say this, the Mayan calendar.
[00:47:26.101 --> 00:47:36.048]  Now, the Mayans were very intelligent people way ahead of their time when it came to understanding the planets and the solar system and the heavens.
[00:47:36.048 --> 00:47:38.809]  They truly were, because I've learned this.
[00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:44.233]  Even with all of our modern technology today, the Mayans are right on.
[00:47:44.233 --> 00:47:47.215]  Our technology, for the most part, cannot prove them wrong.
[00:47:48.835 --> 00:47:50.577]  Under most things.
[00:47:50.577 --> 00:47:59.425]  So here you had a culture that took place many many many years ago that was very very bright when it came to space.
[00:47:59.425 --> 00:48:04.609]  And this 2012 show goes beyond the Mayan calendar.
[00:48:04.609 --> 00:48:10.835]  It goes to some things that we know are actually real and completely backed up by NASA.
[00:48:11.415 --> 00:48:21.299]  And that's where I'll leave it, right there, because I want people intrigued, I want them to watch the show, and the show will be on long before 2012 arrives.
[00:48:21.299 --> 00:48:25.361]  Are you, knowing what you now know, doing the deep research, are you concerned about 2012?
[00:48:25.361 --> 00:48:33.785]  I'm concerned, yeah, I'm concerned over things that I have learned, yes, I'm very concerned over them.
[00:48:34.691 --> 00:48:48.366]  And later on when the show is all air, Alex, and I don't have to try to intrigue a listening audience anymore, I'll be glad to come back on the show and openly talk about what concerns me after it airs.
[00:48:49.253 --> 00:48:49.774]  Absolutely.
[00:48:49.774 --> 00:48:50.995]  That'd be a great radio interview.
[00:48:50.995 --> 00:48:53.517]  And also talk about how much hit the cutting room floor.
[00:48:53.517 --> 00:48:55.278]  You guys have done a ton of work.
[00:48:55.278 --> 00:48:57.160]  I mean, they've been working your butt off.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:57.921]  Oh, week to week.
[00:48:57.921 --> 00:49:00.083]  Yeah, I've been here.
[00:49:00.083 --> 00:49:02.505]  You know how it works in the country, Alex?
[00:49:02.505 --> 00:49:07.009]  When you try to retire and quit, that's when your agent finds your jobs.
[00:49:08.517 --> 00:49:13.179]  But when you're looking for the jobs for 20 years, they can't find you anything.
[00:49:13.179 --> 00:49:18.260]  No, I've been to LA so many times I can't remember since summer.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.761]  I've been to Anchorage, Alaska.
[00:49:19.761 --> 00:49:21.241]  I've been to San Francisco.
[00:49:21.241 --> 00:49:27.363]  I've been to Oklahoma City, Kansas City, New York multiple, multiple times.
[00:49:27.363 --> 00:49:31.025]  And I've lost track of a few of the other places that I've been to.
[00:49:31.025 --> 00:49:35.286]  But the most unique was the thing going up to Anchorage to learn about harp.
[00:49:36.844 --> 00:49:37.985]  Absolutely.
[00:49:37.985 --> 00:49:40.047]  And again, I'm Huggy Bear.
[00:49:40.047 --> 00:49:46.352]  Let me interject, Alex, of which I, up until about four months ago, I didn't even know what H.A.R.P.
[00:49:46.352 --> 00:49:48.794]  was.
[00:49:48.794 --> 00:49:50.135]  Didn't even know what it was.
[00:49:50.135 --> 00:49:51.616]  This has been quite a journey for you.
[00:49:51.616 --> 00:49:55.419]  I know your son began to really get you into this five, six years ago.
[00:49:55.419 --> 00:49:59.762]  And obviously I gave you some films and that helped you along your journey.
[00:49:59.762 --> 00:50:04.066]  And then you described it to me at the hotel that now it's like the top of your head's blown off.
[00:50:04.066 --> 00:50:05.647]  The whole world's opening up and
[00:50:06.407 --> 00:50:08.368]  It's quite a journey, isn't it, Governor?
[00:50:08.368 --> 00:50:14.710]  Well, it sure is, and the exciting thing that I'll tell people when people say to me, why do I like to study this?
[00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:16.410]  Why do I like to look at it?
[00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:20.431]  Because these are things that very well could be real.
[00:50:20.431 --> 00:50:29.334]  And when you read a writer like, say, Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn, they're marvelous books, but they're simply figments of their imagination.
[00:50:30.242 --> 00:50:34.765]  They're carrying you through on their imaginary trip.
[00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:48.273]  I would rather look into and read about real history and hopefully get educated on it so that we're not stupid enough to allow ourselves to repeat it, which over and over I see it happening.
[00:50:48.273 --> 00:50:53.857]  Our stupidity is just unbelievable how we can be duped over and over again.
[00:50:53.857 --> 00:50:54.497]  Absolutely.
[00:50:54.497 --> 00:50:58.499]  I mean, really, a conspiracy theorist is someone with an alternative history view.
[00:50:58.499 --> 00:50:59.160]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:59.787 --> 00:51:08.935]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[00:51:08.935 --> 00:51:12.318]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[00:51:12.318 --> 00:51:18.184]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[00:51:18.184 --> 00:51:22.968]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[00:51:22.968 --> 00:51:25.310]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:25.991]  I'm good.
[00:51:42.105 --> 00:51:44.646]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:52:05.525 --> 00:52:07.507]  This message is for you.
[00:52:07.507 --> 00:52:11.231]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:52:11.231 --> 00:52:16.395]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water.
[00:52:16.395 --> 00:52:20.239]  Remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal water.
[00:52:20.239 --> 00:52:26.405]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.

[00:53:16.356 --> 00:53:21.099]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[00:53:21.099 --> 00:53:25.041]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[00:53:25.041 --> 00:53:29.163]  AirAndAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[00:53:29.403 --> 00:53:29.943]  I think so.
[00:54:00.401 --> 00:54:04.364]  Big Jesse Ventura is our guest!
[00:54:28.321 --> 00:54:35.784]  Governor, one more time for people tuning in and getting this exclusive first look at the TV show that, believe me, is going to be powerful, folks.
[00:54:35.784 --> 00:54:41.926]  Tell them when the seven episodes are going to air, how they tune in, how they watch it.
[00:54:41.926 --> 00:54:45.928]  Well, it'll be on the True Network, which used to be Court Television.
[00:54:45.928 --> 00:54:51.690]  It's located, if you've got the satellite, I think it's right in between TBS and TNT.
[00:54:52.902 --> 00:54:57.804]  It's the station in between if you're on the direct dish satellite or whatever it is.
[00:54:57.804 --> 00:54:59.545]  But, you know, check wherever.
[00:54:59.545 --> 00:55:03.787]  And anyway, the first show will air Wednesday, December 2nd.
[00:55:03.787 --> 00:55:07.749]  And it'll be 10 o'clock Eastern, 9 o'clock Central.
[00:55:07.749 --> 00:55:09.090]  And it's a one-hour show.
[00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:11.011]  We're doing seven conspiracies.
[00:55:11.011 --> 00:55:13.572]  And naturally, I'd like to say this.
[00:55:13.572 --> 00:55:17.794]  Can we get completely into the conspiracies and everything about them?
[00:55:17.794 --> 00:55:18.754]  Absolutely not.
[00:55:18.754 --> 00:55:20.195]  You can never do that in an hour.
[00:55:20.988 --> 00:55:32.096]  So we focus on just certain portions of the conspiracy, which I think people will find it, especially your listening audience, Alex, are going to find it very interesting.
[00:55:32.096 --> 00:55:39.161]  And so it's going to be airing every Wednesday in December and January, or are they going to skip one on Christmas?
[00:55:39.161 --> 00:55:40.683]  I have no idea.
[00:55:40.683 --> 00:55:46.247]  I'll be gone surfing at that time and I'll leave all of you up here to take the repercussions from it.
[00:55:49.286 --> 00:55:52.987]  What are you going to do if I come parachuting in when you're out there surfing?
[00:55:52.987 --> 00:56:02.070]  Well, then I'll know everything hit the fan up here, because I know that if you're not doing your daily radio show, then the United States don't exist anymore.
[00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:04.351]  Now, is my bunker ready next to your bungalow?
[00:56:04.351 --> 00:56:07.472]  I don't know.
[00:56:07.472 --> 00:56:18.616]  You know, I'll tell you that my neighbor Fernando, he had to dig a 40-foot well down there and it took him six months, but it would have taken him a year had there been good waves.
[00:56:20.683 --> 00:56:22.784]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:56:22.784 --> 00:56:27.265]  Okay, we're going to come back and take phone calls, but right now, let's get into the global warming episode.
[00:56:27.265 --> 00:56:27.686]  Okay.
[00:56:27.686 --> 00:56:29.866]  I mean, just give us a little taste of that.
[00:56:29.866 --> 00:56:34.988]  Well, the big thing on global warming to me is this cap-and-trade legislation.
[00:56:34.988 --> 00:56:37.849]  It's nothing but bait-and-switch.
[00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:43.031]  It's a legislation that's designed to make money, not solve the problem.
[00:56:43.031 --> 00:56:45.872]  And if global warming is indeed a problem,
[00:56:46.352 --> 00:56:53.099]  Then why is the solution simply money-making that does nothing to address the actual problem?
[00:56:53.099 --> 00:56:59.485]  And that's the key of what we try to expose, and this is the cap-and-trade legislation for what it is.
[00:56:59.485 --> 00:57:10.195]  And the fact that there are 30,000 people with PhDs and science degrees that simply are not buying into global warming, and it doesn't seem to be that they get any type of
[00:57:11.343 --> 00:57:14.066]  Their opinion is not being aired at all.
[00:57:14.066 --> 00:57:14.466]  That's right.
[00:57:14.466 --> 00:57:16.568]  It's a very one-sided opinion.
[00:57:16.568 --> 00:57:28.579]  Well, yeah, when Al Gore says, all scientists agree it's man-made, and then you find out that actually the majority say it's driven by the sun and by nuclei from space causing cloud condensation.
[00:57:28.579 --> 00:57:33.524]  I mean, I'm not going to give away who you interview in the film, but this is going to be a powerful death blow.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:38.281]  One more nail in the coffin against the Greenies that want to tax us.
[00:57:38.281 --> 00:57:42.483]  I mean, it's come out that Al Gore has made over a billion bucks so far off this.
[00:57:42.483 --> 00:57:47.785]  I mean, he owns a cap-and-trade company that you've got to buy carbon credits from.
[00:57:47.785 --> 00:57:49.306]  I mean, how obvious is this?
[00:57:49.306 --> 00:57:52.748]  Well, again, it comes down to the legislature.
[00:57:52.748 --> 00:57:58.270]  I'm not a scientist, Alex, so I'm not gonna beat my head against the wall on whether it's real or not.
[00:57:59.045 --> 00:58:06.990]  But a good way to look at things is always view something not from what someone says, but from what someone does.
[00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:14.375]  And the cap-and-trade legislation is fraudulent because you can have a company that's supposedly polluting.
[00:58:14.375 --> 00:58:16.456]  They don't have to change at all.
[00:58:16.456 --> 00:58:27.143]  They can simply pay money and buy other people's and trade so that until they get under, and they'll still pollute the same, but then they'll be able to say that they're not.
[00:58:27.783 --> 00:58:29.625]  Well, that right away is fraudulent.
[00:58:29.625 --> 00:58:33.388]  And if that's fraudulent, then what else is fraudulent?
[00:58:33.388 --> 00:58:34.769]  I tell you, that's a key point.
[00:58:34.769 --> 00:58:37.871]  Take the weakest part of their argument, break their neck right there.
[00:58:37.871 --> 00:58:39.052]  That's why we love you, Governor.
[00:58:39.052 --> 00:58:41.714]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.714 --> 00:58:44.316]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:49.639 --> 00:58:57.389]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:58:57.389 --> 00:59:03.476]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.

[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:12.706]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:59:12.706 --> 00:59:16.770]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:22.095]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:59:22.395 --> 00:59:24.475]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:59:24.475 --> 00:59:26.216]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:59:26.216 --> 00:59:28.756]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:59:28.756 --> 00:59:33.477]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:59:33.477 --> 00:59:37.178]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.

[00:59:42.199 --> 00:59:44.320]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:59:52.688 --> 00:59:55.090]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.090 --> 01:00:04.537]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.537 --> 01:00:05.838]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.838 --> 01:00:07.599]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.599 --> 01:00:09.360]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.942]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.942 --> 01:00:12.503]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.503 --> 01:00:16.686]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.686 --> 01:00:20.749]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.987 --> 01:00:30.611]  All right, in this five minutes we're going to get into Secret Society's Manchurian Candidate and Big Brother.
[01:00:30.611 --> 01:00:37.014]  The three episodes we haven't given you a little teaser on.
[01:00:37.014 --> 01:00:41.116]  It premieres December 2nd, True TV.
[01:00:41.116 --> 01:00:48.099]  Tell everybody about it, folks, because I think this is going to be the, not just fairest, but leaning towards our view of any television show ever on mainstream TV.
[01:00:48.099 --> 01:00:51.521]  I think this is a bellwether because the establishment's beginning to realize that
[01:00:52.495 --> 01:00:54.196]  Well, I guess let's go Manchurian Candidate.
[01:00:54.196 --> 01:00:57.358]  This one is going to be a very, this one is a very terrifying show.
[01:01:17.303 --> 01:01:20.165]  We all know that MKUltra was real.
[01:01:20.165 --> 01:01:21.847]  The documents state so.
[01:01:21.847 --> 01:01:39.420]  So there's no gray area there that the government was in the business back in the 50s, 60s, and 70s of attempting to control people's minds and attempting to manipulate them and to use them to their advantage both militarily and whatever.
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:45.184]  Well, all indications are that those programs have been re-ramped up again and they're back on a high level again.
[01:01:46.341 --> 01:01:54.285]  And that being said, that's what the Manchurian candidate deals with, of course, and that we've all heard the story.
[01:01:54.285 --> 01:02:02.269]  One of the interesting things I'll say is that the guy who shot John Lennon fits it perfectly, Mark David Chapman.
[01:02:02.269 --> 01:02:08.232]  Because contrary to popular belief, Chapman was no Beatles fanatic.
[01:02:08.232 --> 01:02:13.515]  If you go back in his history, in fact, his favorite artist was Todd Rundgren, who's hardly a Beatle.
[01:02:14.597 --> 01:02:20.182]  And when he shot Lennon, he had three ways to escape immediately.
[01:02:20.182 --> 01:02:24.766]  Central Park, down into the subways, and then just get lost with everybody.
[01:02:24.766 --> 01:02:30.151]  Instead, he stepped back into shadows and started reading the book, The Catcher in the Rye.
[01:02:30.151 --> 01:02:32.733]  Which is a classic mind control.
[01:02:32.733 --> 01:02:38.157]  When they torture them under the drugs in one of the systems, they then become obsessed with the trigger word.
[01:02:38.157 --> 01:02:41.981]  When McVeigh got pulled over, he said, get the chip out of me, and was foaming at the mouth.
[01:02:42.583 --> 01:02:50.750]  And then the most famous mind control scientist ever, Jolion West, was his doctor with him every day until the day he was executed.
[01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:58.317]  And I'll tell you this, Governor, studying the Fort Hood shooting, I can't say it was a mind control, but it has every earmark.
[01:02:58.317 --> 01:02:59.858]  He's a psychiatrist.
[01:02:59.858 --> 01:03:09.427]  The FBI and CIA were- Well, I'll tell you, it's funny you should say that, Alex, because amazingly, when it first happened, scarily, that's the first thing that popped into my head.
[01:03:10.547 --> 01:03:19.692]  Unbelievable that you say that, because that's the exact first thing that popped into my head when I first heard about the Fort Hood shootings.
[01:03:19.692 --> 01:03:25.215]  And when I started then reading about the whole situation, how the guy never had it in his background.
[01:03:27.088 --> 01:03:35.430]  And then now the CIA and FBI are watching him and he has this fake history that suddenly began and then commanders and people said bust him and they wouldn't do it.
[01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:36.330]  Same thing with 9-11.
[01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:38.230]  Then he's a psychiatrist.
[01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:40.290]  He has that whole history.
[01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:43.391]  Once you've studied mind control, he just fits.
[01:03:43.391 --> 01:03:45.091]  Every piece fits.
[01:03:45.091 --> 01:03:46.512]  And I wouldn't say this last week.
[01:03:46.512 --> 01:03:48.192]  I mean, I knew that was going on Thursday.
[01:03:48.192 --> 01:03:53.633]  But now, more and more of the pieces are coming out and man, the hair on the back of my neck just stands up.
[01:03:54.867 --> 01:03:56.469]  Anyway, enough Manchurian.
[01:03:56.469 --> 01:03:58.131]  What are the last two shows?
[01:03:58.131 --> 01:03:58.571]  Big Brother watching.
[01:04:16.947 --> 01:04:18.068]  What about it?
[01:04:18.068 --> 01:04:19.969]  Well, no, just how folks can get it.
[01:04:19.969 --> 01:04:20.729]  It's been a best-seller.
[01:04:20.729 --> 01:04:21.590]  Oh, no, I don't know.
[01:04:21.590 --> 01:04:25.272]  It's still in the bookstores, and I guess you can get it over the internet.
[01:04:25.272 --> 01:04:29.694]  I've been so involved in this thing, I haven't even thought about the book for months.
[01:04:29.694 --> 01:04:32.115]  Well, I just wanted to plug your book, because it's a good book.
[01:04:32.115 --> 01:04:32.996]  Oh, thank you.
[01:04:32.996 --> 01:04:34.177]  And it's still out there.
[01:04:34.177 --> 01:04:38.279]  I was actually in the Minneapolis airport the other day, and I saw copies there for sale.
[01:04:38.279 --> 01:04:42.941]  So, it's a book that's got a lot of my heart and soul in it.
[01:04:42.941 --> 01:04:45.903]  I wrote it on my trips to Mexico and all that.
[01:04:46.603 --> 01:04:52.669]  And it includes my wife, and it tells you about my years in office, and it'll give you a great insight into how I think.
[01:04:52.669 --> 01:04:53.329]  Absolutely.
[01:04:53.329 --> 01:04:58.534]  Okay, the two final episodes, briefly, and your phone calls for Governor Jesse Ventura, giving us the exclusive.
[01:04:58.534 --> 01:04:59.435]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.894 --> 01:05:04.918]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:04.918 --> 01:05:08.142]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:08.142 --> 01:05:12.947]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:05:12.947 --> 01:05:19.353]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:19.353 --> 01:05:21.596]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:05:22.116 --> 01:05:23.597]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:05:23.597 --> 01:05:24.878]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:24.878 --> 01:05:27.119]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:41.007 --> 01:05:45.391]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:05:45.391 --> 01:05:48.293]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:05:48.293 --> 01:05:57.421]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:05:59.483 --> 01:06:08.629]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:06:08.629 --> 01:06:12.011]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:17.874]  Instead, use vitamin C-D in OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:06:17.874 --> 01:06:22.657]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:06:22.657 --> 01:06:24.999]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:06:25.179 --> 01:06:25.479]  Thank you.
[01:06:44.090 --> 01:06:47.816]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[01:06:47.816 --> 01:06:50.019]  That's O-X-Y, Silver.net.

[01:06:55.007 --> 01:06:56.529]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:06:56.529 --> 01:06:57.010]  Do it now.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.101]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:07:03.101 --> 01:07:08.423]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:07:08.423 --> 01:07:10.464]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:07:10.464 --> 01:07:15.466]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:07:15.466 --> 01:07:16.647]  How much do you want?
[01:07:16.647 --> 01:07:17.787]  When do you want it?
[01:07:17.787 --> 01:07:19.668]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:20.728]  When will you need it?
[01:07:20.728 --> 01:07:22.929]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:07:22.929 --> 01:07:24.270]  Will there be any food?
[01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:25.811]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:07:25.811 --> 01:07:26.851]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:07:27.011 --> 01:07:28.333]  And you can't feed yourself?
[01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:31.056]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:07:31.056 --> 01:07:34.661]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:07:34.661 --> 01:07:38.486]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:07:38.486 --> 01:07:39.707]  How much will you need?
[01:07:39.707 --> 01:07:40.608]  We don't know.
[01:07:40.608 --> 01:07:41.710]  How much do you want?
[01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:42.651]  All you can get.
[01:07:42.651 --> 01:07:43.452]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:07:43.712 --> 01:07:46.773]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:07:46.773 --> 01:07:48.873]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:48.873 --> 01:07:54.315]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:54.315 --> 01:07:57.116]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:57.116 --> 01:08:08.619]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.619 --> 01:08:11.600]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.132 --> 01:08:27.357]  Governor Jesse Ventura, he's worn a lot of hats, but now he is fighting the New World Order.
[01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:34.011]  And I don't want to put words in his mouth, but, Governor, I think it's safe to say, I mean, you now know there's a world government, there is an elite.
[01:08:34.011 --> 01:08:36.492]  The question is, how evil are they?
[01:08:36.492 --> 01:08:37.673]  Are they monolithic?
[01:08:37.673 --> 01:08:38.713]  What is their main goal?
[01:08:38.713 --> 01:08:48.677]  I mean, is it fair to say that you're now officially, uh, not their label of conspiracy terrorist, but, I mean, you question JFK, you question 9-11, you question HAARP.
[01:08:48.677 --> 01:08:51.358]  You're not buying the Kool-Aid they're selling.
[01:08:51.358 --> 01:08:52.058]  Is that fair to say?
[01:08:52.538 --> 01:08:54.619]  Well, let me put it this way.
[01:08:54.619 --> 01:08:59.540]  Irregardless of anything, it sure is interesting stuff.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:06.102]  And, you know, we do a show on the Bilderbergs and I do understand that they're real.
[01:09:06.102 --> 01:09:11.563]  I guess the thing that upsets me the most was I made it to governor and they never invited me.
[01:09:13.323 --> 01:09:21.990]  And I guess maybe I gotta run for office again then so I get invited to this thing to find out what the hell goes on inside there.
[01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:29.335]  Well, they would have invited you if you would have gone along with the CIA when they sent you down at the governor's office two weeks into office.
[01:09:29.335 --> 01:09:31.637]  But I mean, you're not selling people out.
[01:09:31.637 --> 01:09:34.459]  You're a swashbuckling, you know, loose cannon for freedom.
[01:09:36.693 --> 01:09:38.594]  Well, I mean, what is your view on the New World Order then?
[01:09:38.594 --> 01:09:41.874]  Because I know you're anti-establishment and... Well, let me put it to you this way.
[01:09:41.874 --> 01:09:45.636]  Then I also look at it from a different perspective, Alex.
[01:09:45.636 --> 01:09:47.736]  I believe in evolution.
[01:09:47.736 --> 01:09:49.677]  The science of evolution.
[01:09:49.677 --> 01:09:53.918]  And maybe this is evolution.
[01:09:53.918 --> 01:10:00.980]  You know, when you look at it, that we will evolve and that maybe it won't fully be here in our lifetimes, but a hundred years from now,
[01:10:01.801 --> 01:10:08.667]  Because of the fact with technology the way it is, the world gets smaller and smaller and smaller.
[01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:17.334]  And I guess, let me, just for the sake of argument, state that there would be one good thing if there was a one world government.
[01:10:17.334 --> 01:10:18.275]  You know what that would be?
[01:10:18.275 --> 01:10:20.797]  There couldn't be wars then, could there?
[01:10:23.379 --> 01:10:26.642]  But see, Governor, that is the... No, I mean, I mean, literally.
[01:10:26.642 --> 01:10:30.546]  If... then you wouldn't have one country fighting another country.
[01:10:30.546 --> 01:10:32.028]  No, but that's not their plan.
[01:10:32.028 --> 01:10:33.650]  Oh, I understand that, Alex.
[01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:36.192]  Don't... don't for a minute think I'm naive.
[01:10:36.192 --> 01:10:43.320]  But I am saying that there is the chance that this could be almost an evolutionary thing, that we will evolve to the point
[01:10:43.901 --> 01:10:49.994]  Where there may well be a one world government and there may be no way around it.
[01:10:49.994 --> 01:10:54.062]  Then the important thing, Alex, is what will that government be?
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:15.316]  Well, that's the issue here, is that they always pitch it that we were hunter-gatherers, we were agrarian, we formed villages, then city-states, then nations, then empires, and the next phase is Star Trek, that we've been implanted with psychologically, the image of the global galactic empire, and we're always fighting green aliens, you know, and the Klingons, so we've got to do this.
[01:11:15.316 --> 01:11:22.262]  The issue is, they built this world government in stealth, and denied that it existed.
[01:11:22.982 --> 01:11:43.954]  Until it was too late to really stop it, and now they're coming out going, yeah, we're going to tax everything you do, we're not going to let you have more than one kid, and yeah, we want to carry out eugenics on you, and we're going to carbon tax you, and Ban Ki-moon writes editorials saying the carbon tax is for the New World Order, and it's for a bunch of corrupt CEOs and bankers to play emperor.
[01:11:43.954 --> 01:11:52.339]  And so, if the people of the world ever wanted to create a world government, and it was democratic and under the republic system, then that would be one thing.
[01:11:52.919 --> 01:11:58.422]  But this thing was created by a corrupt group of criminals, and it's a world tyranny.
[01:11:58.422 --> 01:12:09.447]  That's why every ounce of my body and being, just like Thomas Jefferson said, I swear eternal resistance to all forms of tyranny over the minds of men.
[01:12:09.447 --> 01:12:13.329]  And Jesse, I know you, I mean, don't you swear?
[01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:15.990]  Alex, I wholeheartedly agree with you.
[01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:19.352]  I'm not going to dispute anything you've said.
[01:12:19.352 --> 01:12:20.392]  I won't.
[01:12:20.392 --> 01:12:21.253]  But the point is,
[01:12:22.372 --> 01:12:23.372]  And you're correct.
[01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:26.113]  If it was so good, why would they do it in secret?
[01:12:26.113 --> 01:12:29.654]  And that's a very, very valid point to make.
[01:12:29.654 --> 01:12:42.618]  But the point we have to make, if it's inevitable that we're going to come under one world rule, then we, the people, have to ensure that we're players in the game, that we have dogs in the fight.
[01:12:42.618 --> 01:12:45.118]  But I don't want to be under the Communist Chinese.
[01:12:45.118 --> 01:12:47.879]  Alex is making sure we got a dog in the fight.
[01:12:47.879 --> 01:12:49.259]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:12:49.259 --> 01:12:51.620]  But instead, so we never have a dog in the fight,
[01:12:52.392 --> 01:12:55.595]  They just say there isn't a world government, meet your world government.
[01:12:55.595 --> 01:13:01.199]  I mean, they're still saying world government doesn't exist, so that we can never demand representation.
[01:13:01.199 --> 01:13:05.643]  Well, what's interesting was I was out at that new Denver airport.
[01:13:05.643 --> 01:13:05.903]  Right?
[01:13:05.903 --> 01:13:07.344]  The new one in Denver?
[01:13:07.344 --> 01:13:07.824]  Yes.
[01:13:07.824 --> 01:13:16.271]  And on the plaque that they have out there, on the bottom of it, it says the New World Airport Commission.
[01:13:16.271 --> 01:13:16.892]  And there isn't one.
[01:13:18.886 --> 01:13:22.307]  Nothing, nothing of that name is in existence.
[01:13:22.307 --> 01:13:24.048]  And there's murals of Nazis.
[01:13:24.048 --> 01:13:28.490]  How would they put that on the dedication plaque at that big Denver airport?
[01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:29.731]  The New World.
[01:13:29.731 --> 01:13:37.454]  Not the Colorado Airport Commission, not the Denver Airport Commission, but the New World Airport Commission.
[01:13:37.454 --> 01:13:41.115]  And they have paintings of Nazis killing children above it.
[01:13:41.115 --> 01:13:43.777]  Also, they're not Nazis.
[01:13:43.777 --> 01:13:44.777]  I disprove that.
[01:13:46.383 --> 01:13:49.224]  Right, but they are not Nazis.
[01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:53.366]  You know how I disproved that, Alex?
[01:13:53.366 --> 01:13:55.087]  The guy's carrying an AK-47.
[01:13:55.087 --> 01:13:56.728]  I saw it right away.
[01:13:56.728 --> 01:13:58.229]  I said, this can't be a Nazi.
[01:13:58.229 --> 01:14:00.150]  The Nazis didn't have that weapon.
[01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:00.870]  Well, I noticed it.
[01:14:07.658 --> 01:14:09.559]  Hey Jesse, I want to take some calls in time.
[01:14:09.559 --> 01:14:11.600]  Yes, let's do some calls.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.702]  But a plug right here in the middle of this conversation.
[01:14:14.702 --> 01:14:25.649]  I'm going to mail you, I've forgotten to mail you, Fall of the Republic, because this details from the Globalist's own statements that they are setting up a tyrannical world government, that they engineered the banking crisis by
[01:14:26.369 --> 01:14:33.791]  And Alex, let me shamelessly add in, please watch my television show because if we get such an overwhelming audience response, it'll force them to buy it up for another deal.
[01:14:58.625 --> 01:15:02.252]  And then, like the X-Files, I get the spinoff like the lone gunman.
[01:15:07.159 --> 01:15:20.322]  Look, this show is important, and I want everybody to tell their friends and family and neighbors, True TV, December 2nd, airing every Wednesday, absolutely important, because this show is definitely from our perspective.
[01:15:20.322 --> 01:15:23.123]  Okay, I want to go to some calls, but we got to finish up with the last point.
[01:15:23.123 --> 01:15:26.324]  We just hit Manchurian Candidate, Secret Societies.
[01:15:26.324 --> 01:15:27.264]  What about Big Brother?
[01:15:28.945 --> 01:15:31.967]  Well, Big Brother is just simply that.
[01:15:31.967 --> 01:15:34.270]  It's Big Brother, are they watching over you?
[01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:45.180]  And I think in our show, you're going to hear clearly that they are, and that clearly it's going to come from a place where the government is able to do it and work around the Constitution.
[01:15:51.041 --> 01:16:05.052]  We have found that out and we will air that on the show to where you will clearly see how the government has looped the Constitution in which establishing Big Brother on you.
[01:16:05.052 --> 01:16:07.954]  Can we say the different federal groups you talk to or just leave that alone?
[01:16:08.584 --> 01:16:11.585]  Uh, I don't think I talked to any federal groups again.
[01:16:11.585 --> 01:16:13.846]  There was no cooperation from the government at all.
[01:16:13.846 --> 01:16:15.287]  Well, you talked to their minions, though.
[01:16:15.287 --> 01:16:20.189]  You talked to their Gestapo, their, their, their, their ground pounders, their citizen spies.
[01:16:20.189 --> 01:16:22.710]  Well, yes, we did do that.
[01:16:22.710 --> 01:16:23.950]  We'll just leave it there.
[01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:24.791]  We'll just leave it there.
[01:16:24.791 --> 01:16:26.852]  Yeah, just leave it at that.
[01:16:26.852 --> 01:16:31.053]  Well, it's a very exciting, uh... Too many of them are right down in your country, Alex.
[01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:32.274]  I don't want you getting in trouble.
[01:16:33.743 --> 01:16:36.345]  Believe me, we know what InfraGard is up to.
[01:16:36.345 --> 01:16:42.150]  Oklahoma's too close to Austin.
[01:16:42.150 --> 01:16:45.292]  Okay, folks, Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[01:16:45.292 --> 01:16:55.800]  Best-selling author, wrestler, movie star, governor, football, National Football League, NFL commentator, surfer.
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.562]  Jesse, what is there you haven't done?
[01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:04.231]  I don't know, but I've got a few years to figure it out yet, Alex.
[01:17:04.231 --> 01:17:10.653]  You never stop going, because in the words of the late, great Warren Zavon, I'll sleep when I'm dead.
[01:17:16.744 --> 01:17:17.665]  Well, for a number of reasons, Alex.
[01:17:17.665 --> 01:17:19.547]  Your participation in the show was exceptional and we appreciated it.
[01:17:40.266 --> 01:17:41.727]  You know, you flew out to L.A.
[01:17:41.727 --> 01:17:45.948]  a couple times and all that to participate, and so why not?
[01:17:45.948 --> 01:17:51.111]  I reward the people that reward me, and so that's a reason for it.
[01:17:51.111 --> 01:17:56.913]  Plus, you have the listening audience, the base market that this show is designed for.
[01:17:56.913 --> 01:18:04.916]  I would be crazy not to come on your show with my show, because, you know, I'm not going to lie, we're out for success on this show.
[01:18:04.916 --> 01:18:06.937]  I hope this show is hugely successful.
[01:18:07.157 --> 01:18:09.678]  Yeah, but I know the TV shows you turn down.
[01:18:09.678 --> 01:18:16.182]  I mean, I don't know if you want to say it, but you're turning down something with 30 million viewers coming up in a few weeks because you want to be out of the country.
[01:18:16.182 --> 01:18:23.186]  I'm just really honored you came because I know you're turning down a bunch of really huge media interviews, but doing our shows, we appreciate it.
[01:18:23.186 --> 01:18:24.346]  Well, no problem.
[01:18:24.346 --> 01:18:31.710]  And like I said, you know, you're a wealth of information, Alex, that we can always rely upon.
[01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:36.373]  And, you know, so doing your show is just simply the left hand washing the right hand.
[01:18:37.341 --> 01:18:40.484]  Well, folks, we're going to post this interview up at InfoWars.com.
[01:18:40.484 --> 01:18:42.686]  Over 200,000 people a day get the free podcast.
[01:18:42.686 --> 01:18:43.967]  Get it, share it with everybody.
[01:18:43.967 --> 01:18:54.996]  We're going to post a YouTube video of it, share it with everyone, because if this show can be a big success, the system may start letting more of this on the air as the Internet culture takes over the mainstream media.
[01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:57.018]  We can beat the globalists.
[01:18:57.018 --> 01:19:01.842]  If they can't beat us, they're going to try to join us, and we can slow down this whole system.
[01:19:02.382 --> 01:19:03.702]  That's what Tweety Bird always said.
[01:19:03.702 --> 01:19:05.883]  If you can't beat them, join them.
[01:19:05.883 --> 01:19:08.923]  Well, if we can beat them, they're going to have to back off.
[01:19:08.923 --> 01:19:12.104]  And believing we can expose these people is half the battle.
[01:19:12.104 --> 01:19:13.484]  Believing you can win.
[01:19:13.484 --> 01:19:14.044]  Or as G.I.
[01:19:14.044 --> 01:19:15.565]  Joe says, knowing is half the battle.
[01:19:15.565 --> 01:19:17.525]  I believe taking action is half the battle.
[01:19:17.525 --> 01:19:18.865]  Resistance is victory.
[01:19:18.865 --> 01:19:20.946]  Matt in Illinois, you're on the air with Jesse Ventura.
[01:19:20.946 --> 01:19:22.366]  Go ahead, Matt.
[01:19:22.366 --> 01:19:24.006]  Hello, Mr. Ventura.
[01:19:24.006 --> 01:19:25.547]  How are you doing?
[01:19:25.547 --> 01:19:25.967]  Pretty good.
[01:19:27.219 --> 01:19:27.559]  I don't have a TV.
[01:19:40.146 --> 01:19:56.136]  If there's any plans to put it on the web or somehow that I'll be able to watch it without having to... I don't know at this time, but then again, I'm not a good web person to talk to, but I certainly will inquire to find out what the options are about doing it over the web or whatever.
[01:19:56.136 --> 01:19:56.716]  I don't know.
[01:19:56.716 --> 01:19:59.758]  But at this time, the only thing I know is we're going to be...
[01:20:08.191 --> 01:20:08.611]  I think so.
[01:20:33.168 --> 01:20:33.729]  We're good.
[01:20:53.687 --> 01:20:56.588]  Gold.
[01:20:56.588 --> 01:21:02.170]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:02.170 --> 01:21:08.452]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:08.452 --> 01:21:12.634]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:14.574]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:14.574 --> 01:21:17.015]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:17.015 --> 01:21:18.916]  The stage is being set for the reemergence
[01:21:18.956 --> 01:21:19.497]  We're good to go.
[01:21:39.876 --> 01:21:45.823]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[01:21:45.823 --> 01:21:48.386]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.386 --> 01:21:54.914]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[01:21:54.914 --> 01:21:55.935]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.718 --> 01:22:04.745]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:22:04.745 --> 01:22:07.990]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:09.393]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:22:10.306 --> 01:22:12.768]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:22:12.768 --> 01:22:19.171]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:19.171 --> 01:22:24.714]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:22:24.714 --> 01:22:34.340]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:36.802]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:22:36.802 --> 01:22:38.404]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:22:38.404 --> 01:22:40.846]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:22:40.846 --> 01:22:42.968]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:22:42.968 --> 01:22:48.133]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:23:59.853 --> 01:24:02.935]  Or if you're on the no-fly list, you won't be able to buy a gun.
[01:24:02.935 --> 01:24:08.220]  So you're not convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor or a parking ticket, Governor, but then you lose your rights.
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:12.963]  Isn't that 180 degrees the opposite from our republic form of government?
[01:24:12.963 --> 01:24:19.929]  I would like to think so, and you know, as I said earlier, Alex, it's just the case of, you know, the big brother.
[01:24:19.929 --> 01:24:24.993]  And in this case, it was dealing with the Bilderbergs that we have this particular guy we were going to interview.
[01:24:25.653 --> 01:24:31.876]  He was coming from a foreign country to here, and he was on the no-fly list over there.
[01:24:31.876 --> 01:24:45.502]  And to my knowledge, he's not a terrorist, so, you know, it's interesting how they'll disrupt people's lives by putting him on this no-fly list if he's simply out of, say, a different political persuasion or whatever it might be.
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:52.006]  Well, Governor, you've got to get to a meeting in downtown Minneapolis, so we've only got four more minutes left with you.
[01:24:52.006 --> 01:24:53.827]  Let's take two final calls quickly.
[01:24:53.827 --> 01:24:56.150]  Gary in Washington, then Mark in Minnesota.
[01:24:56.150 --> 01:24:57.611]  Gary, you're on the air with Jesse Ventura.
[01:24:57.611 --> 01:25:00.174]  It's an honor to be here with you.
[01:25:00.174 --> 01:25:05.979]  I have a very important piece of information for the Governor, and I have a big question for both of you.
[01:25:05.979 --> 01:25:07.641]  First piece of information.
[01:25:07.641 --> 01:25:09.102]  Shake maps.
[01:25:09.102 --> 01:25:09.823]  Shake maps.
[01:25:10.675 --> 01:25:11.656]  It's a product of U.S.
[01:25:11.656 --> 01:25:14.297]  Geological Survey Earthquake Hazards Program.
[01:25:14.297 --> 01:25:28.886]  If you look at the shake map in Sichuan, when the earthquake happened with a rainbow over China on May 20th, 2008, the shake map is the exact same shape as the HAARP weapon.
[01:25:28.886 --> 01:25:32.349]  That's point number one, and then we'll get to point number two.
[01:25:32.349 --> 01:25:33.549]  Okay, what's your final point?
[01:25:33.549 --> 01:25:34.670]  Because we've got to go here in a minute.
[01:25:35.521 --> 01:25:38.024]  Okay, so check out the ShakeMap's final point.
[01:25:38.024 --> 01:25:41.228]  There's too much fragmentation on the info war.
[01:25:41.228 --> 01:25:46.774]  Prison Planet, Birthers, Oath Keepers, 9-11 Truth, Audit the Fed, LP, Gun Owners, Skywatch.
[01:25:46.774 --> 01:25:48.256]  I would recommend both of you
[01:25:48.849 --> 01:25:54.114]  Join and help create a constitutional defense fund.
[01:25:54.114 --> 01:25:55.615]  Sir, we can't do it all.
[01:25:55.615 --> 01:25:56.335]  Hold on a minute.
[01:25:56.335 --> 01:26:00.859]  People act like Jesse Ventura or Alex Jones or Ron Paul have magical powers.
[01:26:00.859 --> 01:26:04.082]  We put our pants on one leg at a time, too.
[01:26:04.082 --> 01:26:05.563]  Freedom is fractured.
[01:26:05.563 --> 01:26:09.867]  It's good that we're not all unified because that makes us hard to stop.
[01:26:09.867 --> 01:26:10.908]  Governor, your comment on that?
[01:26:12.349 --> 01:26:14.410]  The thing is too is that how do you do it?
[01:26:14.410 --> 01:26:24.797]  It's like when I was the third party candidate in Minnesota, I tried to bring all the third parties together so we could consolidate and become a force against the other two parties.
[01:26:24.797 --> 01:26:27.899]  I got news for you, it's like herding cats.
[01:26:27.899 --> 01:26:34.583]  And I couldn't even bring them together on an issue that we all agreed upon and that was campaign finance.
[01:26:34.583 --> 01:26:36.785]  None of us, none of us took dirty money.
[01:26:37.802 --> 01:26:43.945]  And it just fractured like nothing and so I just threw my hands up in the air and I said it may be impossible.
[01:26:43.945 --> 01:26:50.387]  I think Alex makes a great point that they can't stop us all if we're all coming at them from different directions.
[01:26:50.387 --> 01:26:52.048]  Yeah, it's a spirit of liberty.
[01:26:52.048 --> 01:26:54.329]  Shrink government, bring accountability.
[01:26:54.329 --> 01:26:58.811]  Final call for Governor Jesse Ventura from his home state, Minnesota.
[01:26:58.811 --> 01:26:59.651]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:26:59.651 --> 01:27:00.031]  Go ahead.
[01:27:00.031 --> 01:27:02.052]  Hi, can you hear me?
[01:27:02.052 --> 01:27:02.552]  Yes, I can.
[01:27:02.552 --> 01:27:02.973]  Go ahead.
[01:27:02.973 --> 01:27:03.533]  Hi, Mark.
[01:27:03.533 --> 01:27:03.673]  Hi.
[01:27:04.261 --> 01:27:05.742]  Hi, I brought it for you, Jesse.
[01:27:05.742 --> 01:27:07.284]  I appreciate both your guys' work.
[01:27:07.284 --> 01:27:10.006]  And quickly, I have a couple questions.
[01:27:10.006 --> 01:27:11.808]  I can't wait for your show to come out.
[01:27:11.808 --> 01:27:13.589]  I look forward to watching that.
[01:27:13.589 --> 01:27:16.052]  And I'll tell people about it, my friends and whatnot.
[01:27:16.052 --> 01:27:17.353]  A couple ideas for the show.
[01:27:17.353 --> 01:27:26.421]  Maybe you could look into the patent issue where people, individuals developing free energy and anti-gravity technology that
[01:27:27.185 --> 01:27:30.246]  The government then deems it a national security risk.
[01:27:30.246 --> 01:27:31.927]  You know, Jesse, that's a great idea.
[01:27:31.927 --> 01:27:35.668]  If it gets picked up for another season, is look at Cold Fusion.
[01:27:35.668 --> 01:27:38.929]  We'll take that into consideration, but we've got to get picked up first.
[01:27:38.929 --> 01:27:40.810]  We only did seven for right now.
[01:27:40.810 --> 01:27:45.031]  Yeah, we've got to cross that bridge before we... We have to come to that bridge before we cross it.
[01:27:45.031 --> 01:27:46.832]  Anything else, Mark?
[01:27:46.832 --> 01:27:47.432]  Yeah, one last thing.
[01:27:47.432 --> 01:27:54.475]  I just saw an article in the WorldNet Daily about data centers being set up by the NSA and Homeland Security Department.
[01:27:55.163 --> 01:27:56.164]  And I'm very concerned about that.
[01:27:56.164 --> 01:28:00.125]  They collect all our information, all communications, and store it.
[01:28:00.125 --> 01:28:03.427]  And this is another incremental loss of liberty.
[01:28:03.427 --> 01:28:12.751]  Watch my show on his big brother watching and all that, and you'll learn how they get away with it, how they loop the Constitution to do it.
[01:28:12.751 --> 01:28:13.892]  Thank you so much, Mark.
[01:28:13.892 --> 01:28:15.352]  Okay, we've got a minute and a half left.
[01:28:15.352 --> 01:28:18.334]  Governor, I'm going to say bye to you when we go to break, so just hold one moment.
[01:28:18.334 --> 01:28:20.875]  But I wanted to say in closing, it's been great working with you.
[01:28:21.375 --> 01:28:22.456]  I hope the show airs.
[01:28:22.456 --> 01:28:23.776]  Looks like it is.
[01:28:23.776 --> 01:28:24.836]  They've started promoting it.
[01:28:24.836 --> 01:28:26.177]  They're unleashing you to promote it.
[01:28:26.177 --> 01:28:27.317]  So I think that's the green light.
[01:28:27.317 --> 01:28:32.720]  But as you said, we won't believe it airs until we see it go on December 2nd on TruTV.
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:33.960]  So spread the word.
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:38.502]  But did you ever think, because I know all about this stuff and I still can't believe it.
[01:28:38.502 --> 01:28:39.843]  I'm still flabbergasted.
[01:28:39.843 --> 01:28:42.624]  I am psychologically speechless a lot of times.
[01:28:42.624 --> 01:28:43.084]  I can still
[01:28:43.764 --> 01:28:46.626]  Babble some words out, but it's hard to articulate.
[01:28:46.626 --> 01:28:49.008]  The NSA says they're taking over the whole internet.
[01:28:49.008 --> 01:28:52.790]  They may shut it down during crises like bird flu or swine flu.
[01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:56.373]  The NSA is going to intercept all internet traffic.
[01:28:56.373 --> 01:29:05.199]  They're building NSA centers in San Antonio and New York and Florida and Minnesota and California and just admitting they're reading everything we're doing.
[01:29:05.199 --> 01:29:12.203]  So they go from we're not spying on Al-Qaeda to we are spying on Al-Qaeda to we're spying on you and we don't need no stinking warrants.
[01:29:12.203 --> 01:29:13.404]  Did you ever think that would happen?
[01:29:14.424 --> 01:29:21.566]  Well, it will happen because, yeah, I can believe it happening, Alex, because of apathetic people out there.
[01:29:21.566 --> 01:29:24.367]  People cannot be apathetic any longer.
[01:29:24.367 --> 01:29:26.907]  You can't sit on your hands anymore.
[01:29:26.907 --> 01:29:33.469]  You can't sit back and have government tell you they're going to protect you, but in lieu of that protection, you're going to give up your freedoms.
[01:29:33.969 --> 01:29:39.975]  You are better off to be in danger from terrorists than you are to lose your freedoms.
[01:29:39.975 --> 01:29:46.221]  Don't let them take your freedoms and always remember dissension is the greatest form of patriotism.
[01:29:46.221 --> 01:29:48.403]  Governor Jesse Ventura, amazing having you on.
[01:29:48.403 --> 01:29:50.504]  That's a great way to end it.
[01:29:50.504 --> 01:29:51.465]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.465 --> 01:29:54.428]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.428 --> 01:29:57.131]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.721 --> 01:30:06.706]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:30:06.706 --> 01:30:07.967]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:30:07.967 --> 01:30:08.788]  It's very real.
[01:30:08.788 --> 01:30:11.029]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:30:11.029 --> 01:30:12.691]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:31:59.286 --> 01:32:04.613]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:32:04.613 --> 01:32:09.139]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:32:09.139 --> 01:32:11.402]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:32:11.402 --> 01:32:13.024]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:32:13.024 --> 01:32:14.066]  There is a solution.

[01:33:13.436 --> 01:33:19.079]  Well, Judge Napolitano is our guest today, and I'm very, very excited to have him on.
[01:33:19.079 --> 01:33:23.542]  This is an abbreviated visit, but we're going to get him back on for a full 30 minutes or maybe even an hour.
[01:33:25.026 --> 01:33:26.868]  And he's, of course, from Newark, New Jersey.
[01:33:26.868 --> 01:33:32.273]  He's a tenured Superior Court judge in New Jersey and now an analyst on Fox News Channel.
[01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:40.000]  He has an extremely popular syndicated radio show and has Freedom Watch from Fox News Studios, which is an internet television show.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.703]  And he also is the guest host for Glenn Beck.
[01:33:42.703 --> 01:33:43.924]  I wish he was!
[01:33:45.426 --> 01:33:49.308]  The person doing that show because he is the real bonafide.
[01:33:49.308 --> 01:34:02.236]  He wrote an editorial last week pointing out that the Republican health care plan was almost as bad as the Democrats and he is a constitutionalist right up there with Ron Paul.
[01:34:02.236 --> 01:34:04.697]  And so he's somebody I actually agree with on like 98% of stuff
[01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:08.735]  Instead of Glenn Beck, 90%.
[01:34:08.735 --> 01:34:10.756]  Because that 10% is a big area.
[01:34:10.756 --> 01:34:24.742]  And so, here for about 15 minutes to talk about healthcare, the big government takeover of healthcare, extrajudicial, these boards decide what to do, and to talk about the cap and trade, which I believe has a good chance of passing the Senate.
[01:34:24.742 --> 01:34:27.763]  Both of these are now in orbit, like ICBM,
[01:34:28.656 --> 01:34:36.640]  Space stations about to drop nukes on our Republic and Judge Andrew Napolitano is there fighting it valiantly.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.281]  Judge, it's great to have you with us.
[01:34:38.281 --> 01:34:39.221]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:34:39.221 --> 01:34:42.062]  It's good to be on with you.
[01:34:42.062 --> 01:34:43.623]  There's so much happening.
[01:34:43.623 --> 01:34:52.087]  What's more important, cap and trade and the total micromanagement of our life by special interests with Al Gore set to make the money or the government takeover of health care?
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:55.961]  Oh boy, that's really a pick-your-poison, Alex.
[01:34:55.961 --> 01:34:59.803]  It's all part of the same big government mentality.
[01:34:59.803 --> 01:35:15.508]  Your kind comments about the piece I wrote was really from a monologue that I gave while filling in for Glenn Beck, which I'm also doing later today at 5 o'clock Eastern, by the way, on Fox News Channel, in which I argued that we don't have a two-party system in this country.
[01:35:15.508 --> 01:35:20.530]  We have a one party, one political party called the Big Government Party, the Republican branch,
[01:35:21.230 --> 01:35:33.158]  The Democratic branch likes war and deficits and assaulting our civil liberties, and the Democratic branch likes wealth transfers and taxes and assaulting our commercial liberties.
[01:35:33.158 --> 01:35:34.980]  But the mindset is the same.
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:49.850]  The heck with the Constitution, the heck with the Bill of Rights, the heck with inalienable rights, the heck with even the laws that we write, we know what's better for you than what you know is good for yourself and we will tell you how to obey or else.
[01:35:50.490 --> 01:35:53.813]  Cap and trade is one manifestation of that.
[01:35:53.813 --> 01:35:57.837]  Obamacare is another manifestation of it.
[01:35:57.837 --> 01:36:15.272]  I was curious last week when I saw that even the Republicans, even so-called conservative Republicans, not Ron Paul, but many in the Republican leadership in the House, introduced Obamacare Lite, which basically presumes a federal
[01:36:15.512 --> 01:36:16.032]  I think so.
[01:36:35.879 --> 01:36:50.813]  They would basically go to the state of New Jersey and say, we'll repave the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike if you put caps on the limits that juries can award injuries against doctors and medical malpractice lawsuits.
[01:36:50.813 --> 01:36:56.018]  If you and I went to a state and said, I'll give you money if you change our laws, we'd be arrested for bribery.
[01:36:56.018 --> 01:37:01.003]  So this was all the same mindset of we in Washington
[01:37:04.706 --> 01:37:14.833]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is our guest today.
[01:37:14.833 --> 01:37:20.998]  Judge, what you're talking about and reading over the legislation, it's like Groundhog Day but on a bigger scale.
[01:37:20.998 --> 01:37:25.121]  It's Chicago or New York, big city, crime boss,
[01:37:26.414 --> 01:37:28.995]  A machine doling everything out.
[01:37:28.995 --> 01:37:31.697]  It's like with the takeover of General Motors.
[01:37:31.697 --> 01:37:45.084]  It even came out in congressional investigations, as you know, because you covered it, that people that gave money to Obama cronies or to the Democratic Party, they got to keep their dealership and got to keep their client list.
[01:37:45.084 --> 01:37:47.365]  But if you didn't, if you'd ever gone against them,
[01:37:48.152 --> 01:37:57.014]  Or hadn't paid the protection money, you lost your dealership, even though some of the dealerships were over 80 years old and made millions of dollars a year.
[01:37:57.014 --> 01:38:04.975]  And so now you have this Tenth Amendment destroying federal power coming in with these unelected panels.
[01:38:04.975 --> 01:38:09.076]  And it just goes on and on and on and on.
[01:38:09.076 --> 01:38:11.016]  And I fear it can pass the Senate.
[01:38:11.016 --> 01:38:14.177]  I'm hearing some of the Republican leadership saying, oh no, it won't.
[01:38:14.177 --> 01:38:16.517]  They said it wouldn't pass the House in the last two weeks.
[01:38:17.054 --> 01:38:21.778]  Well, they did say it wouldn't pass the House, and it did pass by a two-vote margin.
[01:38:21.778 --> 01:38:28.363]  And, you know, you really can't tell with politicians, because the leadership will bribe them.
[01:38:28.363 --> 01:38:35.248]  Remember the first time TARP, the so-called Troubled Asset Relief Program, went through the House, it was defeated.
[01:38:35.248 --> 01:38:46.477]  I remember, I was on the Fox Business Network at the moment, fist in air, just emoting joy, shouting, the beast is dead.
[01:38:47.157 --> 01:38:56.929]  But I was naive because the leadership came back and bribed by, you know, we'll build a courthouse in your district, your friend wants to become a federal judge, he's got it, just vote for us on TARP.
[01:38:56.929 --> 01:38:59.512]  And eventually people changed their vote.
[01:38:59.512 --> 01:39:03.377]  I fear that the same thing will happen with respect to Obamacare, the government.
[01:39:04.137 --> 01:39:16.394]  The executive branch, the leadership in both parties, in both houses, will bribe those who are wavering and give them something else that they want in order to secure their vote.
[01:39:16.394 --> 01:39:20.239]  But you also raise a very important issue about the delegation
[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:25.265]  of federal power to non-elected groups.
[01:39:25.265 --> 01:39:30.750]  This is what FDR did, and FDR is the model for President Barack Obama.
[01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:41.901]  FDR had over 500 groups throughout the country appointed by local politicians who decided what prices and wages were.
[01:39:41.901 --> 01:39:44.204]  There's a famous case in my home state of New Jersey
[01:39:44.964 --> 01:39:59.194]  Where an Eastern European immigrant opened up a dry cleaning shop and the local wage and price group declared that you would charge 40 cents to clean and press a man's suit.
[01:39:59.194 --> 01:40:00.275]  This guy charged 35 cents.
[01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:08.059]  Literally a nickel cheaper than what the unelected local board said he could charge.
[01:40:08.059 --> 01:40:23.306]  He was arrested by the FBI, he was indicted by a grand jury, he was put on trial in federal court in Newark, and he served a three-month prison term in a federal prison for charging five cents less than what the local board allowed him to.
[01:40:23.306 --> 01:40:25.167]  Now, transform that
[01:40:26.076 --> 01:40:28.597]  It's a modern day practice of medicine.
[01:40:28.597 --> 01:40:36.299]  You will have a board of bureaucrats, not even physicians, bureaucrats that will be between you and your physician.
[01:40:36.299 --> 01:40:38.540]  You will lose your privacy.
[01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:54.464]  You will lose the freedom of choice because the bureaucratic board will give your physician a list of diagnostic tools that she or he can use to address your ailment and then a list of procedures and medicines that she or he can prescribe.
[01:40:54.724 --> 01:40:56.605]  And that's all in there.
[01:40:56.605 --> 01:41:02.088]  And that's why they're saying they're going to get all these hundreds of billions out of Medicare and Medicaid by reducing the care.
[01:41:02.088 --> 01:41:06.870]  Tom Daschle wrote a book admitting if you're old, you don't deserve it, you don't need it.
[01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:16.455]  People are really about to find out who these eugenicists are, who these control freaks are that inhabit the Democratic Party and to some extent the Republican Party.
[01:41:16.455 --> 01:41:24.379]  In the five minutes we've got left with Judge Andrew Napolitano joining us today in a very busy schedule, I want to shift gears now.
[01:41:25.416 --> 01:41:27.056]  Uh, to war.
[01:41:27.056 --> 01:41:33.638]  You talk about the Republicans want endless war, and the Democrats want to nanny-state you together, uh, to death.
[01:41:33.638 --> 01:41:34.918]  But look at Obama!
[01:41:34.918 --> 01:41:37.319]  He's increased troops before in Afghanistan.
[01:41:37.319 --> 01:41:41.740]  He's now saying he's gonna send 40,000 more in, that we're never going to leave.
[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:45.901]  There's over 300,000 international and Afghan troops there now.
[01:41:45.901 --> 01:41:50.142]  Uh, I see absolutely no difference between the parties, just different rhetoric.
[01:41:51.521 --> 01:41:53.682]  I must reluctantly agree with you.
[01:41:53.682 --> 01:42:05.445]  I say reluctantly, not because I don't like to agree with you, I do, but because I was naively expecting that we would not see this kind of build-up under him that we saw under George W. Bush.
[01:42:05.445 --> 01:42:07.646]  But think about it, war is the health of the state.
[01:42:08.286 --> 01:42:20.591]  When we fight a war, people will look the other way when our taxes are raised and when the government takes away their freedom because they accept the illusion that by fighting the war, the government is somehow keeping them safe.
[01:42:20.591 --> 01:42:26.134]  Presidents love war because it lets them escape the confines of the Constitution.
[01:42:26.514 --> 01:42:28.935]  It lets them become a little bit of a prince.
[01:42:28.935 --> 01:42:38.221]  It even causes judges sometimes, if the president does something under the guise of war-making, to look the other way and defer to the executive branch.
[01:42:38.221 --> 01:42:42.143]  Fortunately, the Supreme Court did not do that under Bush years, under the Bush years.
[01:42:42.663 --> 01:42:57.649]  And every single time his war-making powers were challenged in the courts and made its way to the Supreme Court of the United States, he was zero and six before a Supreme Court that was appointed largely by Republicans.
[01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:58.829]  Judge, were you surprised?
[01:42:58.829 --> 01:43:04.191]  I don't want to rely on the Supreme Court to save us because they're life-senior and you don't know which way they're going to go.
[01:43:15.335 --> 01:43:31.442]  Were you surprised that Obama flip-flopped so strongly and went from being anti-patriot act to zealously defending it, wanting to expand it, and complete warrantless wiretapping, complete secret arrest, complete... I mean, he's going further than Bush on the police state.
[01:43:31.442 --> 01:43:32.482]  I didn't think that was possible.
[01:43:32.802 --> 01:43:37.184]  I didn't think it was possible either, and I was absolutely crushed when I heard it.
[01:43:37.184 --> 01:43:49.029]  He obviously was not my candidate of choice, but I took a little bit of internal intellectual solace in the fact that at least we were getting a president who would respect the Constitution.
[01:43:49.029 --> 01:43:50.890]  How wrong I was!
[01:43:50.890 --> 01:43:55.792]  His disrespect for the Constitution may not be couched in as harsh
[01:43:56.232 --> 01:43:56.773]  Exactly.
[01:43:56.773 --> 01:44:00.295]  I've talked to a lot of lawyers and judges, and I wanted to briefly see if you agree.
[01:44:21.053 --> 01:44:38.105]  Even though a lot of conservatives didn't like Obama, true paleo-conservatives, libertarian types like Ron Paul and yourself, because he is a constitutional lawyer and practiced it for 10 years as a professor, people expected that Obama would try to, at least on the surface, restore some of the Bill of Rights.
[01:44:38.105 --> 01:44:41.067]  But instead, you know, he's saying, Constitution?
[01:44:41.067 --> 01:44:42.408]  It's just a GD piece of paper.
[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:48.165]  I, too, expected that he would show more respect for the Constitution.
[01:44:48.165 --> 01:44:52.410]  I read some of the lectures he gave at the University of Chicago Law School.
[01:44:52.410 --> 01:45:00.499]  I could have given some of those lectures myself when I taught Constitutional Law at Seton Hall Law School in Newark and at Delaware Law School in Wilmington, Delaware.
[01:45:01.339 --> 01:45:22.565]  But, you know, something happens when you don the mantle of power, and that something is a disdain for the restraint on your power, a disdain for the natural law, a respect that we have natural rights beyond which no government can go, a disdain for the Constitution itself, a disdain for our inalienable rights, same as natural rights and a disdain for the Bill of Rights.
[01:45:22.565 --> 01:45:25.906]  They just simply don't care.
[01:45:25.906 --> 01:45:26.766]  They will steal from
[01:45:26.786 --> 01:45:27.086]  We're good.
[01:45:44.165 --> 01:45:44.745]  Well said.
[01:45:44.745 --> 01:45:45.446]  Final question.
[01:45:45.446 --> 01:45:47.587]  I'm going to let you go because I know you've got to fill in.
[01:45:47.587 --> 01:45:48.787]  Guest host for Glenn Beck tonight.
[01:45:48.787 --> 01:45:54.350]  Congratulations on your huge success as your star rises because you're the bonafide constitutionalist.
[01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:57.971]  We really, really appreciate you, Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[01:45:57.971 --> 01:45:58.932]  But in closing,
[01:46:00.425 --> 01:46:07.568]  I would like to get you to comment, A, on just how special George Washington and Andrew Jackson were.
[01:46:07.568 --> 01:46:10.009]  They got all this power and then did give it up.
[01:46:10.009 --> 01:46:12.911]  They wanted George Washington to be a king.
[01:46:12.911 --> 01:46:24.376]  These were amazing founding fathers we had, and what would they think of what's happening today where NOAA Satellite Information Service, the federal government, admits the coldest
[01:46:25.226 --> 01:46:32.529]  Winner so far in the last 50 years, the third coldest in the last hundred.
[01:46:32.529 --> 01:46:40.072]  Meanwhile, they're openly announcing that they're going to list carbon dioxide as a toxic waste and tax it when humans exhale it.
[01:46:40.072 --> 01:46:49.095]  Can you end with speaking about our founders compared to the material we've got in Washington today and what they would think of taxing what plants breathe?
[01:46:50.252 --> 01:46:54.617]  The founders tried to do two things with the Constitution.
[01:46:54.617 --> 01:47:04.746]  One was to create a federal government strong enough to protect us from invasion and to do national type things like run a post office and make sure that there's trade between the states.
[01:47:04.746 --> 01:47:09.291]  The other was to restrain the federal government so that it wouldn't interfere with our personal liberties.
[01:47:09.691 --> 01:47:25.645]  They specifically gave us a constitution that kept the federal government away from any type of relationship with individuals because they knew that the greatest threat to freedom comes not from your enemy on the outside who you can see and look at.
[01:47:26.246 --> 01:47:33.189]  But from the smiling face of the government on the inside, who claims that it's going to take care of you.
[01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:39.291]  And presidents like George Washington, whose closest advisor, Alexander Hamilton, wanted him to be king.
[01:47:39.291 --> 01:47:50.436]  And Andrew Jackson, who basically said to the Supreme Court, you know, they've gone ahead and made their federal bank, let them find the money and put them on the deposits in the federal bank.
[01:47:50.436 --> 01:47:55.778]  These were people who understood that there were natural limits on what government can do
[01:47:56.318 --> 01:48:02.042]  And written limits on what the federal government can do, and they stuck to those limits.
[01:48:02.042 --> 01:48:19.714]  The present government and its predecessors, you know, from Lincoln to Wilson to FDR to George W. Bush to Barack Obama, have so distorted out of proportion what the federal government is to do that the founders would not recognize it at all and would probably want to take up arms against it.
[01:48:20.635 --> 01:48:22.497]  What are you covering tonight and then we'll let you go.
[01:48:22.497 --> 01:48:26.740]  I hope you're going to be covering the health care and cap-and-trade because... That's exactly what we're talking about.
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:28.101]  We're talking about health care.
[01:48:28.101 --> 01:48:31.064]  We're talking about the state of the economy.
[01:48:31.064 --> 01:48:46.036]  We're talking about the government subpoenaing media entities wanting to know who earns how much money because they have to decide whose income taxes to audit next.
[01:48:46.036 --> 01:48:46.677]  You're kidding!
[01:48:46.677 --> 01:48:47.117]  Wait a minute.
[01:48:47.117 --> 01:48:47.678]  They're not just
[01:48:48.456 --> 01:48:58.139]  The federal government is subpoenaing media people to- They're subpoenaing media companies to find out who earns what and what their social security numbers are.
[01:48:58.139 --> 01:49:03.821]  This is getting so bad, so quickly, far worse than any of us imagined.
[01:49:03.821 --> 01:49:08.582]  And the present president hasn't even celebrated his first year in office yet.
[01:49:08.582 --> 01:49:09.763]  Well, since you brought that up-
[01:49:10.683 --> 01:49:13.345]  Since you brought that up, let me just ask you now.
[01:49:13.345 --> 01:49:18.429]  Senator Lamar Alexander has gone to the floor and talked about he's confirmed there's an enemies list.
[01:49:18.429 --> 01:49:23.612]  He warned him and said, look, I worked for Nixon, don't do this.
[01:49:23.612 --> 01:49:26.394]  It's been reported I am on the enemies list.
[01:49:26.394 --> 01:49:27.235]  I'm going from memory.
[01:49:27.235 --> 01:49:28.596]  I think you are too.
[01:49:28.596 --> 01:49:29.276]  But what is it?
[01:49:29.276 --> 01:49:31.298]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:49:31.298 --> 01:49:35.221]  It is scary to know that there's a real enemies list.
[01:49:35.221 --> 01:49:38.403]  And this is I mean, is this not illegal, Judge?
[01:49:39.426 --> 01:49:48.377]  Well, it's illegal for the President to compile a list of people who disagree with him on the basis of their political opinions and their outspoken words.
[01:49:48.377 --> 01:49:56.347]  That was specifically written into the privacy law in 1974, enacted and signed into law by President Ford shortly after
[01:49:57.107 --> 01:49:58.508]  President Nixon resigned.
[01:49:58.508 --> 01:50:03.371]  These are restraints that are expressly enacted to restrain the President.
[01:50:03.371 --> 01:50:13.156]  But this White House, just like it doesn't respect freedom of contract, just like it doesn't respect freedom of speech, just like it doesn't respect privacy, doesn't respect this either.
[01:50:14.269 --> 01:50:19.691]  Well, I tell you, it's scary, and everybody should pray for the people that are on that list, myself included.
[01:50:19.691 --> 01:50:24.813]  Judge, what's the best website for people to visit to find out about all things Judge Napolitano?
[01:50:24.813 --> 01:50:36.598]  Well, they can go to FoxNews.com, where my Freedom Watch appears, as do my monologues when I fill in for Glenn, as do many of my op-eds.
[01:50:36.598 --> 01:50:40.060]  And, Alex, I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed being on with you.
[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:43.361]  I hope we get to do this a lot more in the future.
[01:50:44.082 --> 01:50:44.723]  Absolutely.
[01:50:44.723 --> 01:50:45.904]  Thank you, Judge.
[01:50:45.904 --> 01:50:46.384]  Take care.
[01:50:46.384 --> 01:50:47.925]  Have a great weekend coming up.
[01:50:47.925 --> 01:50:49.186]  You as well.
[01:50:49.186 --> 01:50:50.367]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:50.367 --> 01:50:53.610]  It's Wednesday, but I'm already thinking about the weekend because I'm going deer hunting.
[01:50:53.610 --> 01:50:54.791]  All right.
[01:50:54.791 --> 01:50:57.033]  Yeah, you go get your hamburger out of the drive-thru window.
[01:50:57.033 --> 01:50:57.693]  That's okay.
[01:50:57.693 --> 01:50:58.614]  I'm able to go hunting.
[01:51:00.191 --> 01:51:03.714]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[01:51:03.714 --> 01:51:05.715]  Now, going green can save money.
[01:51:05.715 --> 01:51:11.279]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[01:51:11.279 --> 01:51:19.305]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[01:51:19.305 --> 01:51:28.612]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives.
[01:51:28.892 --> 01:51:32.094]  Increasing capacity and maintaining cell integrity.

[01:52:00.007 --> 01:52:01.328]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.328 --> 01:52:06.911]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:06.911 --> 01:52:11.934]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:11.934 --> 01:52:17.498]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:17.498 --> 01:52:22.181]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:22.711 --> 01:52:29.835]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:29.835 --> 01:52:30.956]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:30.956 --> 01:52:37.640]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:40.822]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:40.822 --> 01:52:43.984]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:47.626 --> 01:52:51.852]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:51.852 --> 01:52:56.678]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:56.678 --> 01:52:59.081]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:00.279 --> 01:53:11.186]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[01:53:11.186 --> 01:53:15.369]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[01:53:15.369 --> 01:53:17.510]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:22.974]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:23.134 --> 01:53:33.156]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[01:53:33.156 --> 01:53:39.657]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[01:53:39.657 --> 01:53:42.998]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[01:53:42.998 --> 01:53:45.059]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[01:53:45.059 --> 01:53:46.919]  It simply needs some help so it has
[01:53:47.119 --> 01:53:49.920]  Riders on the storm Riders on the storm Into this house we're born
[01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:32.316]  Coming up, we've got the clip of George Soros, Obama puppet master, calls for carbon taxes and New World Order on PBS.
[01:54:32.316 --> 01:54:36.559]  That is coming up later in the broadcast today.
[01:54:36.559 --> 01:54:41.181]  General Stubblebine's joining us, along with his medical doctor wife, Dr. Rayma Labo.
[01:54:41.181 --> 01:54:43.242]  Gonna be extremely informative.
[01:54:46.574 --> 01:54:54.298]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is anti-war, anti-Patriot Act, anti-New World Order, anti-carbon tax.
[01:54:54.298 --> 01:54:58.240]  He's almost as good as Ron Paul on the issues.
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:03.243]  And Fox uses him like you use a little cayenne pepper and chili.
[01:55:03.243 --> 01:55:05.824]  They just throw a little bit of it in there.
[01:55:05.824 --> 01:55:08.786]  And I like the fact that he's on more and more.
[01:55:08.786 --> 01:55:12.288]  And I've talked to him off-air, talked to him privately, read his columns for years.
[01:55:12.288 --> 01:55:12.968]  He's a good guy.
[01:55:15.302 --> 01:55:22.448]  I don't like coming out and attacking Beck, because I know he's fooled a lot of people and it turns folks off, but I have to tell the truth.
[01:55:22.448 --> 01:55:28.273]  And if Beck will stop stabbing us in the back and stop going sideways on issues, I'll support him.
[01:55:30.242 --> 01:55:43.648]  The issue here is the owner, Rupert Murdoch, admits that he's supporting the global carbon tax and is invested in it and has all of his movies and dramas and non-Fox News shows promoting it.
[01:55:43.648 --> 01:55:47.609]  In fact, call Paul Watson, because I couldn't find it this morning.
[01:55:47.609 --> 01:55:50.991]  He wrote an article about it two years ago.
[01:55:50.991 --> 01:55:56.313]  It has the Rupert Murdoch bragging, look at how I'm propagandizing, I'm proud of myself.
[01:55:57.213 --> 01:56:03.614]  It's the montage of Fox TV programs that Fox put out, where they're promoting the global techs.
[01:56:03.614 --> 01:56:08.696]  You see, you won't hear Napolitano or these guys talk about that.
[01:56:08.696 --> 01:56:18.838]  Look, I'm not stupid, and I'm not gonna get into any details, but I could certainly go, if I played my cards right, go join Team Fox, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:18.838 --> 01:56:23.179]  I wasn't ever offered a job by them, but I was offered jobs by people affiliated with them, years ago.
[01:56:25.453 --> 01:56:27.674]  I told him, no way, okay?
[01:56:27.674 --> 01:56:29.855]  I'm going to fight the New World Order.
[01:56:29.855 --> 01:56:40.819]  But I think we should recognize that Fox is beginning to be forced, because the audience has gone there, to speak out against world government.
[01:56:40.819 --> 01:56:49.302]  Because all these years, Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage and all these guys said there's no New World Order, Glenn Beck said there was no New World Order.
[01:56:49.302 --> 01:56:54.004]  Now, it's openly being announced we're in a world government by the people that are pro-world government.
[01:56:55.692 --> 01:56:58.554]  And so they look pretty stupid.
[01:56:58.554 --> 01:57:08.261]  And so they've got to bring somebody along, like Andrew Napolitano, who's been good the entire time, to not just keep their audience, but grow.
[01:57:08.261 --> 01:57:14.146]  Fox is growing their audience, while CNN, CNBC, all the rest of them are imploding.
[01:57:14.146 --> 01:57:16.708]  And that's because Fox isn't stupid.
[01:57:16.708 --> 01:57:21.151]  They are going anti-New World Order, at least to a certain degree.
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:29.165]  Well, we're going all the way anti-New World Order, and we always have, and that's who we are.
[01:57:29.165 --> 01:57:32.168]  But I get emails going, well, why are you having Judge Andrew Napolitano on?
[01:57:32.168 --> 01:57:33.689]  He's on with Fox.
[01:57:33.689 --> 01:57:36.032]  He's telling the truth when he's on Fox.
[01:57:36.032 --> 01:57:45.481]  We need to support people inside the mainstream media that are getting the truth out, while understanding the larger picture.
[01:57:45.481 --> 01:57:47.863]  Before we go to break and come back with Governor Jesse Ventura,
[01:57:49.426 --> 01:58:05.642]  I just want to finish making the point, we must take over the system, we must get the power, and then re-establish our constitutional republic as many people have said, like G. Edward Griffin, who's in this film, Fall of the Republic.
[01:58:06.272 --> 01:58:07.494]  He makes those points.
[01:58:07.494 --> 01:58:16.264]  Fall of the Republic shatters the left-right paradigm, shows you how both sides are controlled, and shows people who the globalist are and what their master plan is.
[01:58:16.264 --> 01:58:20.068]  Get Fall of the Republic at Infowars.com.
[01:58:20.068 --> 01:58:24.213]  Get it, make copies, give it to everyone you know, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:58:49.878 --> 01:58:59.003]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:58:59.003 --> 01:59:02.385]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:59:02.385 --> 01:59:08.248]  Instead, use Vitamin C-D and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:59:08.248 --> 01:59:13.031]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:59:13.031 --> 01:59:15.372]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:59:15.652 --> 01:59:24.838]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:59:24.838 --> 01:59:30.382]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.

[02:00:17.515 --> 02:00:24.117]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.117 --> 02:00:28.038]  Welcome to the halfway point of the four-hour transmission.
[02:00:28.038 --> 02:00:28.898]  We're here live
[02:00:29.847 --> 02:00:51.945]  noon to 4 p.m eastern 11 a.m to 3 p.m central standard time 9 a.m to 1 p.m pacific 10 to 2 mountain thank you for joining us continuing with your phone calls g edward griffin on the globalist master plan to take over the planet
[02:00:52.975 --> 02:01:01.942]  He's been fighting for 45 years, best-selling author, researcher, filmmaker, Gilbert Griffin, joining us after this quick break.
[02:01:01.942 --> 02:01:05.284]  Let's go ahead now and go to Gabe in New York.
[02:01:05.284 --> 02:01:06.525]  Gabe, you're on the air.
[02:01:06.525 --> 02:01:08.627]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[02:01:08.627 --> 02:01:11.429]  I have a couple quick points I want to push forth.
[02:01:11.429 --> 02:01:15.832]  Yesterday, you discussed the carbon taxation, and I got to tell you, I'm affected by that now.
[02:01:16.457 --> 02:01:23.863]  I got asthma, and they just got rid of the generic companies, so now I'm stuck instead of paying $25 for my medication, I gotta pay $60.
[02:01:23.863 --> 02:01:28.828]  And it's all for the environment, the eugenicists, they love us so much.
[02:01:28.828 --> 02:01:36.514]  They also love my grandmother, who they gave DS, a fertility drug, which had serious birth defects.
[02:01:36.514 --> 02:01:40.818]  And I also found some other interesting information, I wanted to run by you.
[02:01:41.465 --> 02:01:45.966]  I found an interesting New World Order quote on a German propaganda archives.
[02:01:45.966 --> 02:01:50.327]  They talk about, it's, uh, listen, the, uh, secret of Japan's strength.
[02:01:50.327 --> 02:01:52.988]  That's, you can find it.
[02:01:52.988 --> 02:01:55.749]  And, um, what else we got here?
[02:01:55.749 --> 02:01:59.790]  Oh yeah, I have, uh, photos.
[02:01:59.790 --> 02:02:04.771]  I have some photos I'd like to issue you because during the Memorial Day weekend,
[02:02:07.816 --> 02:02:15.323]  I had military troops on the boardwalk with .30 caliber machine guns.
[02:02:15.323 --> 02:02:18.526]  Amazing!
[02:02:18.526 --> 02:02:21.548]  How do I send those to you?
[02:02:21.548 --> 02:02:25.672]  The best email, cca to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[02:02:25.672 --> 02:02:27.334]  Aaron with two A's.
[02:02:27.334 --> 02:02:29.515]  Send them to ShowTips.com.
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:35.301]  at Infowars.com and write a short blurb describing what you saw.
[02:02:35.301 --> 02:02:43.282]  But no, the Homeland Security's announced they're going to put 379,000 troops on the streets of America.
[02:02:43.282 --> 02:02:54.925]  And when Aaron and crew were in Louisiana doing interviews for the new film last week, they ran into City Year with camouflage on their faces.
[02:02:54.925 --> 02:02:56.845]  No, you cannot make this stuff up.
[02:02:58.456 --> 02:03:00.078]  And we're just drowning in evidence.
[02:03:00.078 --> 02:03:07.182]  We've got so much evidence coming in, piling up of the slow incremental paramilitary takeover of the country that I don't even know where to start.
[02:03:07.182 --> 02:03:08.883]  It's just mind-blowing.
[02:03:08.883 --> 02:03:11.605]  What were the troops with their machine guns doing?
[02:03:11.605 --> 02:03:14.687]  You're not exaggerating on any of this information at all.
[02:03:14.687 --> 02:03:23.193]  I could throw out a million points here, but all my rich banking cousin does is tell me to get a life, and I'm delusional to even question this stuff.
[02:03:24.597 --> 02:03:26.880]  His wife works for Pfizer.
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:28.903]  I mean, these people are disgusting.
[02:03:28.903 --> 02:03:30.586]  You want to know what the New World Order is?
[02:03:30.586 --> 02:03:32.569]  Come visit my family for a weekend.
[02:03:32.569 --> 02:03:33.630]  You can go find out.
[02:03:33.630 --> 02:03:38.137]  Because these people have the same psychology that you have discussed with J. Edward Griffin.
[02:03:38.137 --> 02:03:39.439]  They're the same type of people.
[02:03:40.290 --> 02:03:41.191]  Disgusting.
[02:03:41.191 --> 02:03:44.396]  And I don't look at the population, for example.
[02:03:44.396 --> 02:03:47.180]  The Yankees, World Series, the Yankees fan won.
[02:03:47.180 --> 02:03:49.723]  What I see these people doing, they're cheering in the streets.
[02:03:49.723 --> 02:03:52.968]  They care more about the fact that they have Philly fans out there.
[02:03:52.968 --> 02:03:54.970]  They're willing to go out and fight in the streets.
[02:03:54.970 --> 02:03:57.274]  I have video footage where fans are fighting each other.
[02:03:57.774 --> 02:04:07.137]  They have more passion to fight each other over a baseball game than Goldman Sachs robbing the country for 23.7 trillion dollars in broad daylight.
[02:04:07.137 --> 02:04:12.399]  I guess we gotta start telling these fans that Goldman Sachs are a bunch of Phillies or Red Sox fans.
[02:04:12.399 --> 02:04:14.900]  And maybe these Yankee fans will start waking up.
[02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:15.760]  That's a good idea.
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:20.122]  Tell New Yorkers that Goldman Sachs is the Red Sox and Goldman Sachs will all be arrested next week.
[02:04:22.498 --> 02:04:28.961]  No, I mean, that's a great point you make, that people will go out and riot and kill each other over a football or baseball or basketball game.
[02:04:28.961 --> 02:04:32.403]  Or, you know, when the Bulls used to win in Chicago, you know, they'd burn half the town.
[02:04:32.403 --> 02:04:36.385]  Oh, but so what if foreign banks are openly killing the dollar and destroying our children's future?
[02:04:36.385 --> 02:04:39.106]  That's wonderful.
[02:04:39.106 --> 02:04:40.727]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.
[02:04:40.727 --> 02:04:43.068]  Now, that was a good call, Gabe, in New York.
[02:04:43.068 --> 02:04:49.271]  That's the kind of rants I want on the comment line that we're going to start playing more and more clips of here on the show.
[02:04:50.418 --> 02:04:50.698]  5-1-2-6-4-6-4-4-4-4.
[02:04:50.698 --> 02:04:52.159]  Thank you so much, caller.
[02:04:52.159 --> 02:04:56.020]  We'll be right back with Jim McGriffin on the other side of this quick break.
[02:04:56.020 --> 02:04:59.861]  We're gonna go live at PrisonPlanet.tv, so start your engines!
[02:04:59.861 --> 02:05:03.262]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:03.262 --> 02:05:06.884]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:06.884 --> 02:05:11.445]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:11.445 --> 02:05:17.047]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:17.327 --> 02:05:22.110]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.110 --> 02:05:25.733]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:25.733 --> 02:05:30.556]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:30.556 --> 02:05:37.120]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:39.062]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:39.542 --> 02:05:42.746]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:42.746 --> 02:05:47.250]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:47.250 --> 02:05:49.413]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:49.413 --> 02:05:49.473]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:49.473 --> 02:05:50.474]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:03.543]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:03.543 --> 02:06:08.888]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:08.888 --> 02:06:10.930]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:10.930 --> 02:06:15.935]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:15.935 --> 02:06:16.856]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.096 --> 02:06:18.237]  When do you want it?
[02:06:18.237 --> 02:06:20.118]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.118 --> 02:06:21.179]  When will you need it?
[02:06:21.179 --> 02:06:23.400]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:24.721]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:24.721 --> 02:06:26.262]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:26.262 --> 02:06:31.526]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:31.526 --> 02:06:35.108]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.108 --> 02:06:38.591]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:38.931 --> 02:06:40.152]  How much will you need?
[02:06:40.152 --> 02:06:41.053]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.053 --> 02:06:42.154]  How much do you want?
[02:06:42.154 --> 02:06:43.094]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.094 --> 02:06:44.175]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:44.175 --> 02:06:47.238]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:47.238 --> 02:06:49.439]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:49.439 --> 02:06:50.440]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:04.847]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:04.847 --> 02:07:09.393]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:09.393 --> 02:07:11.656]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:11.656 --> 02:07:13.278]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:13.278 --> 02:07:14.320]  There is a solution.
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:22.965]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:07:22.965 --> 02:07:30.429]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:07:30.429 --> 02:07:36.472]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[02:07:36.472 --> 02:07:42.055]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:07:42.475 --> 02:07:46.616]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[02:07:46.616 --> 02:07:54.097]  Go to E-N-E-R-F-O-O-D dot com, or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[02:07:54.097 --> 02:08:01.499]  Click on their banner at Infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[02:08:01.499 --> 02:08:07.040]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:24.531 --> 02:08:27.593]  He's going to be with us until about 45 after in the next hour.
[02:08:27.593 --> 02:08:31.795]  We're going to have wide open phones next hour for G. Edward Griffin.
[02:08:31.795 --> 02:08:35.477]  He's a writer and documentary film producer with many successful titles to his credit.
[02:08:36.184 --> 02:08:37.745]  He's listed in Who's Who in America.
[02:08:37.745 --> 02:08:43.729]  He's well-known because of his talent for researching difficult topics and presenting them in clear terms that all can understand.
[02:08:43.729 --> 02:08:53.314]  He has dealt with such diverse subjects as archaeology and ancient earth history, the Federal Reserve System, international banking, terrorism, internal subversion, the history of taxation, U.S.
[02:08:53.314 --> 02:08:58.337]  foreign policy, science and politics, cancer therapy, the Supreme Court, and the United Nations.
[02:08:58.337 --> 02:09:03.881]  He's best known for his works include The Creature from Jekyll Island, World Without Cancer,
[02:09:04.665 --> 02:09:16.089]  The Open Gates of Troy, No Place to Hide, The Capitalist Conspiracy, More Deadly Than War, The Grand Design, The Great Prison Break, and The Fearful Master.
[02:09:16.089 --> 02:09:19.090]  He's had a long, long, long media history.
[02:09:19.090 --> 02:09:22.272]  What is it, 45 years fighting the New World Order, G.E.B.
[02:09:22.272 --> 02:09:23.312]  Griffin?
[02:09:23.312 --> 02:09:29.234]  Well, Alex, I think I really was in full armor and on my horse about 1960.
[02:09:29.234 --> 02:09:29.694]  Definitely 1960.
[02:09:34.702 --> 02:09:37.145]  So we're talking about 49 years.
[02:09:37.145 --> 02:09:39.027]  Yeah.
[02:09:39.027 --> 02:09:40.169]  Well, you've certainly done well.
[02:09:40.169 --> 02:09:42.432]  You're a living icon.
[02:09:42.432 --> 02:09:45.515]  And certainly... You know, you're like good wine, though.
[02:09:45.515 --> 02:09:46.276]  You've aged well.
[02:09:46.276 --> 02:09:49.440]  You just get sharper and even better.
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:49.841]  Thank you.
[02:09:49.841 --> 02:09:50.621]  I love that.
[02:09:50.621 --> 02:09:51.603]  An icon.
[02:09:51.603 --> 02:09:52.324]  Well, okay.
[02:09:52.324 --> 02:09:53.265]  I have to be something.
[02:09:53.265 --> 02:09:54.146]  Might as well be an icon.
[02:09:55.550 --> 02:10:05.890]  Let me just put a plug in here right now, because you are a big part of Fall of the Republic, and I want to unveil to listeners the new cover, the first couple of runs we did with the Obama on the cover.
[02:10:07.017 --> 02:10:11.339]  I started thinking, you know, I don't want to make this just about Obama, even though he's their front man.
[02:10:11.339 --> 02:10:16.722]  And so we have the Statue of Liberty plunging down to its destruction, with Obama down here at the podium.
[02:10:16.722 --> 02:10:21.625]  Fall of the Republic, Collector's Edition, now available at Infowars.com.
[02:10:21.625 --> 02:10:24.546]  When you order it, this is the cover and the film you'll be getting.
[02:10:24.546 --> 02:10:30.789]  And I gotta say, this latest print, we even did a better res, higher quality ENCODE.
[02:10:30.789 --> 02:10:35.312]  Most people won't notice it, but this is just the most beautiful ENCODE we've ever done on a film.
[02:10:36.072 --> 02:10:37.274]  It just looks like dynamite.
[02:10:37.274 --> 02:10:43.779]  The information is power-packed, and G. Edward Griffin is a big contributor to Fall of the Republic, so I hope folks will get it today.
[02:10:43.779 --> 02:10:45.861]  Okay, going back to G. Edward Griffin.
[02:10:45.861 --> 02:10:56.131]  G. Edward, I've got so many questions, so many things I want to go over with you today, but the first thing I want to ask you is, 49 years fighting this, publishing best-selling books, really
[02:10:57.297 --> 02:11:11.796]  The name over the last half century You're the person that people point at and say he's he's the icon even if some of the old-timers were still alive You would still be bigger than they are and I'm not saying that for ego.
[02:11:11.796 --> 02:11:13.378]  I'm pointing out you have been a
[02:11:14.299 --> 02:11:33.798]  A prime mover, a central force against the globalists, and with a long view of history, if we wouldn't have had you and others 50 years ago fighting and planting seeds and getting laughed at, we wouldn't be having this giant awakening that's blooming today that is really threatening the globalists, and they admit in their own documents, as you know, that they could lose control.
[02:11:33.798 --> 02:11:38.583]  That's why they're trying to bum-rush us right now and bring in the entire program and accelerate it.
[02:11:38.983 --> 02:11:45.948]  So people need to understand, it's not going to be an instant victory, and we'll talk about your long view of history and how we can beat these people coming up.
[02:11:45.948 --> 02:11:55.054]  But first, what is it like to see them openly announcing the world government, openly announcing the carbon tax, openly announcing it's going to be the IMF as the world rulers?
[02:11:55.054 --> 02:11:59.117]  We will pay our taxes to private bankers, to Al Gore.
[02:11:59.117 --> 02:12:04.681]  Everything you wrote about 20, 30, 40 years ago, because you were reading their own documents, to now see it
[02:12:05.504 --> 02:12:06.766]  It's actually taking place.
[02:12:06.766 --> 02:12:11.551]  The republic is falling, the dollar is falling, world government is rising.
[02:12:11.551 --> 02:12:22.944]  Break that down, get into the healthcare takeover, the collectivists, the carbon tax, what we're witnessing, and with your long view of history, how you think this fight is going to unfold.
[02:12:22.944 --> 02:12:23.725]  G. Edward Griffin.
[02:12:24.850 --> 02:12:30.294]  Well, that's quite an interesting perspective wrapped up in a question there.
[02:12:30.294 --> 02:12:32.435]  I have to answer your question with a single word.
[02:12:32.435 --> 02:12:34.096]  It feels eerie.
[02:12:34.096 --> 02:12:36.498]  It's like having a bad nightmare.
[02:12:36.498 --> 02:12:39.520]  You wake up and you say, oh, that was just a nightmare.
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:41.081]  Oh, come on, get it out of your mind.
[02:12:41.081 --> 02:12:42.081]  It's just a nightmare.
[02:12:42.081 --> 02:12:42.802]  Repeat after me.
[02:12:42.802 --> 02:12:44.002]  It's just a nightmare.
[02:12:44.002 --> 02:12:51.347]  And then all of a sudden, the events of the nightmare start to unfold before your eyes and you go back and you say, oh, no, it's not a nightmare.
[02:12:51.347 --> 02:12:52.228]  This is reality.
[02:12:52.768 --> 02:12:55.191]  And it's that kind of an eerie feeling.
[02:12:55.191 --> 02:13:01.037]  You could probably write a good movie around that theme, a nightmare that becomes reality.
[02:13:01.037 --> 02:13:03.099]  But that's really how I feel about it.
[02:13:03.099 --> 02:13:09.965]  You know, when you read the documents of the elitists of the world and you know exactly what they plan and how they think,
[02:13:10.742 --> 02:13:26.898]  It is sort of an academic experience in the beginning because you're still living in a system of a lot of freedom and quite a bit of security and prosperity, and so what you're saying, even though you know it's true, has this unreal-like quality.
[02:13:27.999 --> 02:13:29.020]  Am I right?
[02:13:29.020 --> 02:13:31.021]  Are they really going to pull that off?
[02:13:31.021 --> 02:13:33.582]  And then you look around and say, yep, yep, they're moving on it.
[02:13:33.582 --> 02:13:35.843]  So then you go back and you get serious again.
[02:13:35.843 --> 02:13:42.366]  But there's a long period in the beginning, Alex, when I have to tell you it just didn't seem quite real, even though I knew it was.
[02:13:42.366 --> 02:13:53.571]  So here we are, all these years later, and now, of course, there's no question that these scenarios that we put together, not our scenarios, it was their scenario, actually, that it was quite real.
[02:13:53.571 --> 02:13:55.212]  And we're living through it now.
[02:13:55.892 --> 02:14:17.505]  And it's kind of like, I use another analogy, it's like you're drifting along in a small rowboat or a canoe and the water is kind of quiet and calm and the birds are singing, it's a beautiful sunny day and the water is very calm and you're moving and enjoying watching the fish jump and all that sort of thing.
[02:14:17.505 --> 02:14:24.049]  But you know, you know because you've looked at the map, you know that you're in a river that's headed toward a huge
[02:14:24.935 --> 02:14:26.357]  Waterfall.
[02:14:26.357 --> 02:14:31.603]  And you have a pretty good idea that it's down there maybe a couple of days away.
[02:14:31.603 --> 02:14:36.009]  So you're not worried about it now but you know you've got to get out of that stream of water pretty soon.
[02:14:36.804 --> 02:14:44.730]  And so you're drifting along and everything is fine, but the closer you get to that waterfall, the more rapidly water seems to move.
[02:14:44.730 --> 02:14:53.577]  And now here we find ourselves with this little rowboat moving quite rapidly, and you can hear the sound, the roar of the water.
[02:14:53.577 --> 02:14:55.598]  You can't see it yet, but you can hear it.
[02:14:55.598 --> 02:14:57.980]  So that's another way of looking at it.
[02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:00.342]  I'm trying to give you the emotional experience that I have.
[02:15:01.042 --> 02:15:03.583]  It's a very unnerving thing.
[02:15:03.583 --> 02:15:16.668]  Well that's, I mean, that is a perfect way to describe it and we've now rounded the bend and we see the mist and steam rising up from Niagara and I believe we can now actually see the waterfall.
[02:15:16.668 --> 02:15:19.169]  I mean, they're openly announcing world government.
[02:15:19.169 --> 02:15:24.272]  They're openly announcing carbon taxes, micromanaging our lives, one-child policies.
[02:15:26.002 --> 02:15:33.691]  Times of London comes out and says billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation, secret meetings.
[02:15:33.691 --> 02:15:42.601]  We know that this is a hellish system and just like people could hear the waterfall in 1917 Russia or they could hear the waterfall in 1935 Germany,
[02:15:45.036 --> 02:15:48.680]  As bad as it already is, we know it's going to get a lot, lot worse.
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:53.624]  And as you said, as we near the fall, the water gets faster and faster and faster.
[02:15:53.624 --> 02:16:07.377]  And the globalists were denying, they were blaring on loudspeakers from the woods on the sides of the river for decades that there is no waterfall, everything's fine, go to sleep in the rowboat, relax, drink a beer, watch a ball game.
[02:16:07.797 --> 02:16:23.507]  And now, as we see the waterfall, and see broken ships at the bottom from history, and tyranny passed, and mass murder passed, and we see all the ghosts of those killed by tyranny, they're now saying, oh, it is a waterfall, but you're only safe by going over the edge.
[02:16:23.507 --> 02:16:25.368]  Global government is the solution.
[02:16:25.368 --> 02:16:26.549]  G. Edward Griffin.
[02:16:27.205 --> 02:16:29.486]  Well, I think you said it so well, as usual, Alex.
[02:16:29.486 --> 02:16:34.109]  Yeah, they're saying, look, if you stay where you are, you're going to be dashed against a rock.
[02:16:34.109 --> 02:16:36.391]  So therefore, go over the waterfall.
[02:16:36.391 --> 02:16:37.151]  Come with us.
[02:16:37.151 --> 02:16:38.652]  We will lead you over the waterfall.
[02:16:38.652 --> 02:16:40.713]  There's a nice big lake down there.
[02:16:40.713 --> 02:16:42.895]  It'll be all calm again.
[02:16:42.895 --> 02:16:43.075]  You know,
[02:16:44.119 --> 02:16:55.966]  The beginning of the video that you produced, that magnificent video, The Fall of the Republic, you've got a speech by Obama in which he's talking about the need for change.
[02:16:55.966 --> 02:17:01.930]  It's kind of his campaign rhetoric, but re-wrapped up in post-presidential events.
[02:17:02.890 --> 02:17:04.811]  Yes, we had no choice.
[02:17:04.811 --> 02:17:08.432]  We can't look back, he was saying.
[02:17:08.432 --> 02:17:09.513]  We can't ignore it.
[02:17:09.513 --> 02:17:11.213]  We can't pretend like it's not there.
[02:17:11.213 --> 02:17:13.654]  We must deal with it in all of those latitudes.
[02:17:13.654 --> 02:17:15.895]  And he's right in that sense.
[02:17:15.895 --> 02:17:19.936]  But then he says, we cannot continue what we were doing.
[02:17:19.936 --> 02:17:27.699]  But to any informed observer, that's the biggest laugh of all, because that is exactly what the present administration is doing.
[02:17:29.906 --> 02:17:30.466]  No, it's not.
[02:17:30.466 --> 02:17:31.487]  And on both sides of us are the Republic.
[02:17:31.487 --> 02:17:32.687]  Beautiful fields, forests.
[02:17:32.687 --> 02:17:35.489]  You know, we could build our civilization back if we had the engine of liberty.
[02:17:56.937 --> 02:18:01.861]  But instead they're saying, oh no, don't get out of the boat, just keep going over the waterfall.
[02:18:01.861 --> 02:18:04.082]  Everything is going to be fine.
[02:18:04.082 --> 02:18:05.624]  But we know it's not going to be fine.
[02:18:05.624 --> 02:18:09.687]  We know that's a thousand foot drop down to those rocks below.
[02:18:09.687 --> 02:18:14.811]  We know that hundreds of other civilizations have gone over these falls, haven't they?
[02:18:14.811 --> 02:18:15.931]  Oh yes, they have.
[02:18:15.931 --> 02:18:21.716]  And I guess it's time to abandon the analogy, because actually the people who are
[02:18:22.287 --> 02:18:22.527]  I'm
[02:18:40.951 --> 02:18:41.992]  Because they're sharks!
[02:18:41.992 --> 02:18:44.533]  The banks, in their own documents, want vertical integration.
[02:18:44.533 --> 02:18:49.857]  As Maury Strong said, they want to wreck the economy, so we all go on collectivist welfare, so they can call the shots on everything.
[02:19:03.687 --> 02:19:04.547]  Exactly.
[02:19:04.547 --> 02:19:09.529]  They're power freaks and that's how they get their jollies and that's it.
[02:19:09.529 --> 02:19:12.110]  They're the only trick they know.
[02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:13.511]  They're collectivists.
[02:19:13.511 --> 02:19:22.114]  They believe in that ideology of collectivism with all powerful government at the top and people serving the state at the bottom.
[02:19:22.114 --> 02:19:31.978]  And that's just fine with them because they know that they're in the structure either at the top or far enough toward the top to have a very comfortable life.
[02:19:32.538 --> 02:19:35.202]  Well, the rest of us are servants.
[02:19:35.202 --> 02:19:37.024]  So it's as simple as that.
[02:19:37.024 --> 02:19:42.491]  And the trouble is with most Americans, they can't imagine that there are people out there with that kind of a vision.
[02:19:42.491 --> 02:19:43.833]  Because it's not their vision.
[02:19:43.833 --> 02:19:47.037]  They think there is no one that actually wants to rule the world.
[02:19:47.037 --> 02:19:47.878]  But they're so wrong.
[02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:51.523]  History shows that elites always want to rule the world.
[02:19:51.523 --> 02:19:52.584]  They always dominate.
[02:19:52.584 --> 02:19:53.686]  They always enslave.
[02:19:53.686 --> 02:19:59.653]  But somehow this psychological idea got implanted that corruption doesn't exist in government.
[02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:10.484]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[02:20:10.484 --> 02:20:15.549]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[02:20:15.549 --> 02:20:20.233]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[02:20:20.233 --> 02:20:24.317]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[02:20:24.417 --> 02:20:28.778]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[02:20:28.778 --> 02:20:33.339]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[02:20:33.339 --> 02:20:35.419]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[02:20:35.419 --> 02:20:37.579]  I can't say enough about this book.
[02:20:37.579 --> 02:20:39.500]  Blessings to you and your family.
[02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:45.201]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[02:20:45.201 --> 02:20:48.621]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[02:20:48.621 --> 02:20:51.322]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[02:20:52.203 --> 02:20:56.214]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[02:21:00.074 --> 02:21:02.255]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:21:02.255 --> 02:21:03.095]  Spy on me?
[02:21:03.095 --> 02:21:03.435]  Yeah.
[02:21:03.435 --> 02:21:08.477]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:21:08.477 --> 02:21:10.097]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:21:10.097 --> 02:21:10.837]  Startpage?
[02:21:10.837 --> 02:21:11.258]  Yeah.
[02:21:11.258 --> 02:21:12.358]  Startpage.com.
[02:21:12.358 --> 02:21:15.319]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:21:15.319 --> 02:21:19.200]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:22.061]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[02:21:22.341 --> 02:21:24.962]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:21:24.962 --> 02:21:26.543]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:21:26.543 --> 02:21:26.843]  Right!
[02:21:26.843 --> 02:21:30.145]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[02:21:30.145 --> 02:21:30.726]  Hello, folks.
[02:21:30.726 --> 02:21:32.086]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:21:32.086 --> 02:21:35.928]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[02:21:35.928 --> 02:21:39.710]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[02:21:39.710 --> 02:21:44.873]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[02:21:44.873 --> 02:21:47.795]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the Big Brother habit.
[02:21:48.256 --> 02:21:50.020]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[02:21:50.020 --> 02:21:54.311]  Try StartPage.com for 7 days and start protecting your privacy.
[02:21:54.311 --> 02:21:55.513]  That's StartPage.com
[02:21:59.890 --> 02:22:06.577]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:06.577 --> 02:22:14.686]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:14.686 --> 02:22:20.272]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[02:22:20.592 --> 02:22:22.853]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[02:22:22.853 --> 02:22:27.934]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:27.934 --> 02:22:33.155]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:33.155 --> 02:22:37.517]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:37.517 --> 02:22:38.597]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:38.597 --> 02:22:42.618]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:43.098 --> 02:22:48.000]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.982]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:50.982 --> 02:22:52.762]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:52.762 --> 02:22:53.002]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:59.389 --> 02:23:01.150]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[02:23:01.150 --> 02:23:02.651]  Say no to toxic overload.
[02:23:02.651 --> 02:23:03.992]  Say no to chemicals.
[02:23:03.992 --> 02:23:05.933]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[02:23:05.933 --> 02:23:14.638]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[02:23:14.718 --> 02:23:20.140]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[02:23:20.140 --> 02:23:21.941]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[02:23:21.941 --> 02:23:29.423]  Liquid zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[02:23:29.423 --> 02:23:33.605]  Liquid zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[02:23:33.605 --> 02:23:36.106]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.
[02:23:36.366 --> 02:23:36.746]  I think so.
[02:24:05.567 --> 02:24:32.500]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
[02:24:34.492 --> 02:24:36.290]  But I am still alive
[02:24:37.521 --> 02:24:39.622]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest.
[02:24:39.622 --> 02:24:41.442]  Short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:24:41.442 --> 02:24:43.483]  We're going to break down what's happening currently.
[02:24:43.483 --> 02:25:01.187]  But G. Edward, in this brief five-minute segment, can you give people an overview of, say, Norman Dodd and the Reese Committee, the Church Committee, Carol Quigley, documents from the elite, similar to more modern ones like Ecoscience, written by the White House Science Czar, where they admit planetary government.
[02:25:01.187 --> 02:25:07.189]  And then now, Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General two weeks ago, editorial in the New York Times titled, We Can Do It,
[02:25:07.987 --> 02:25:11.129]  Yeah, I think it's important to get as close to the roots of this as possible.
[02:25:11.129 --> 02:25:16.112]  Of course, you can go back practically to Adam and Eve if you want to, but you don't need to go that far.
[02:25:16.112 --> 02:25:16.772]  One of the most eye-opening
[02:25:31.070 --> 02:25:39.113]  A document that I discovered early in my research, Alex, was the testimony of a fellow by the name of Norman Dodd.
[02:25:39.113 --> 02:25:45.456]  Norman Dodd, this was the 1940s, right after the end of World War II.
[02:25:45.456 --> 02:25:53.679]  There was a lot of concern among a lot of Americans, and particularly some newspaper editors.
[02:25:53.679 --> 02:25:58.821]  The Hearst newspaper chain in particular was very concerned in writing editorials about
[02:26:01.571 --> 02:26:11.940]  Tax-exempt foundations in America, obviously promoting what was in those days blatant communist propaganda.
[02:26:11.940 --> 02:26:21.589]  I found that hard to believe when I read those editorials, but I went to the documents themselves from the tax-exempt foundations, and lo and behold, they were right.
[02:26:21.589 --> 02:26:25.332]  They were publishing essays written by, guess who?
[02:26:25.332 --> 02:26:26.193]  Joseph Stalin.
[02:26:27.531 --> 02:26:28.612]  We're good to go.
[02:26:44.526 --> 02:26:50.489]  And it was just amazing, because it was hard for me to believe that would happen, but there it was in the historical record.
[02:26:50.489 --> 02:27:03.414]  And so the Hearst papers and others, a lot of newspapers around the country, were writing editorials exposing this, and of course that triggered a lot of alarm on the part of the American people, and they wanted their government
[02:27:04.054 --> 02:27:08.636]  People in those days, like today, still thought that their government, you know, represented them.
[02:27:08.636 --> 02:27:22.242]  And so they wanted their government to investigate this, not realizing that already, even in those days, our own government was being heavily influenced by tax-exempt foundations and the financial interests that supported them.
[02:27:22.242 --> 02:27:30.906]  But anyway, the idea was that they wanted an investigation of these tax-exempt foundations to see if they were, in fact, un-American, is the word they used.
[02:27:31.446 --> 02:27:42.433]  That they were advocating systems that required the destruction of the American way of life, and using a process that was not constitutional.
[02:27:42.433 --> 02:27:51.179]  I mean, the American system is designed to be changed if necessary, and if it's the will of the people, but there's a constitutional path for that change.
[02:27:51.179 --> 02:27:57.803]  And so they were concerned about groups such as the Communist Party in those days, pursuing an unconstitutional path.
[02:27:58.223 --> 02:28:01.946]  Through a violent revolution, and that sort of thing.
[02:28:01.946 --> 02:28:12.294]  So, there was a committee established in Congress, headed by Congressman Carol Reese, and I've forgotten the exact title of the committee.
[02:28:12.294 --> 02:28:20.240]  It's a long title, but they just referred to it as the Reese Committee, and its purpose was to investigate tax-exempt foundations.
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:21.841]  Well, that's just background.
[02:28:21.841 --> 02:28:26.765]  They hired a fellow by the name of Norman Dodd to be their chief investigator.
[02:28:27.805 --> 02:28:35.736]  And Norman Dodd came from banking circles, actually.
[02:28:35.736 --> 02:28:38.860]  He had worked for some of the largest banks of New York.
[02:28:38.860 --> 02:28:43.886]  He knew how the power structure worked and all of that, and he was not very happy with it, as a matter of fact.
[02:28:43.886 --> 02:28:44.948]  He had left banking.
[02:28:45.951 --> 02:28:51.894]  And, well, we won't go through his career, but eventually they did select him to be the Chief Investigator.
[02:28:51.894 --> 02:29:10.403]  So, now we finally get to the Norman Dodd testimony, which I ran across, oh, I guess in the middle 1960s, when I was researching a lot of the government documents put out by the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee.
[02:29:10.908 --> 02:29:23.079]  And one of those obscure documents, and believe me, I had stacks of these things that probably, if they were all put on top of each other, would probably go eight feet to the ceiling of the house here.
[02:29:23.079 --> 02:29:28.124]  And one of those obscure documents I ran across, the testimony of Norman Dodd.
[02:29:28.424 --> 02:29:30.285]  Stay there, we'll be right back!
[02:29:30.285 --> 02:29:32.925]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:32.925 --> 02:29:34.966]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:59.810 --> 02:31:04.352]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.352 --> 02:31:05.252]  Number one.
[02:31:05.252 --> 02:31:08.693]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:08.693 --> 02:31:09.533]  Number two.
[02:31:09.533 --> 02:31:14.435]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.435 --> 02:31:15.175]  It's true.
[02:31:15.175 --> 02:31:19.717]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.037 --> 02:31:20.878]  Number 3.
[02:31:20.878 --> 02:31:24.461]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.461 --> 02:31:28.385]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.385 --> 02:31:29.165]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.165 --> 02:31:31.928]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:31.928 --> 02:31:35.611]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:35.611 --> 02:31:36.412]  Number 5.
[02:31:36.412 --> 02:31:40.556]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:40.556 --> 02:31:45.320]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:33:07.932 --> 02:33:13.920]  I want to tell you about a couple of our sponsors, and we're going right back to G. Edward Griffin.
[02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:16.564]  He's really an archaeologist.
[02:33:16.564 --> 02:33:25.696]  Going back into the Congressional record, going into the Foundation's own records, and showing you the embryonic development of what has grown into this monster today.
[02:33:26.266 --> 02:33:27.466]  That's coming up in one moment.
[02:33:27.466 --> 02:33:30.187]  I want to tell you about EcuadorCentral.com.
[02:33:30.187 --> 02:33:31.428]  You know the country Ecuador?
[02:33:31.428 --> 02:33:33.349]  EcuadorCentral.com.
[02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:36.770]  It's your duty to know every option you have to protect you and your family.
[02:33:36.770 --> 02:33:41.512]  Whether you're looking for a rental property, a new start, or you just want to know your options.
[02:33:41.512 --> 02:33:43.652]  I urge you to go to EcuadorCentral.com.
[02:33:43.652 --> 02:33:45.273]  The website is great.
[02:33:45.273 --> 02:33:49.214]  I will give you all the information you want to know before you go.
[02:33:49.214 --> 02:33:51.235]  They will give it to you at EcuadorCentral.com.
[02:33:51.235 --> 02:33:53.156]  Go there and see what folks are doing.
[02:33:53.775 --> 02:33:59.300]  Whether you are interested in real estate investment, travel, or just want to see pictures and videos, go to EcuadorCentral.com.
[02:33:59.300 --> 02:34:02.683]  That's EcuadorCentral.com.
[02:34:02.683 --> 02:34:04.625]  Also, MySolarBackup.com.
[02:34:04.625 --> 02:34:06.387]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[02:34:06.387 --> 02:34:08.168]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[02:34:08.168 --> 02:34:10.010]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid.
[02:34:10.808 --> 02:34:12.530]  And here's a good way to do just that.
[02:34:12.530 --> 02:34:16.734]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[02:34:16.734 --> 02:34:25.162]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of the power source 800-watt generator and a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[02:34:25.162 --> 02:34:27.525]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas.
[02:34:27.525 --> 02:34:31.609]  But in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[02:34:31.609 --> 02:34:33.691]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[02:34:34.031 --> 02:34:36.794]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move now.
[02:34:36.794 --> 02:34:38.255]  Go to MySolarBackup.com.
[02:34:38.255 --> 02:34:39.896]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:34:39.896 --> 02:34:44.380]  Or give them a call toll-free at 877-327-0365.
[02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:46.602]  MySolarBackup.com.
[02:34:46.602 --> 02:34:52.928]  Okay, G. Edward, you're getting into the Reese Committee, reading the testimony of Norman Dodd, this high-powered investigator hired by Congress.
[02:34:53.528 --> 02:35:01.175]  You have the actual foundation documents that we know of as the Carnegie Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, later the Ford Foundation.
[02:35:01.175 --> 02:35:09.082]  They're now quite public about all this, and I want you to go through the testimony first and then into modern times, but here's a microcosm example.
[02:35:09.082 --> 02:35:11.384]  Eco-barons lead the way.
[02:35:11.384 --> 02:35:13.526]  Times of London today.
[02:35:13.526 --> 02:35:16.529]  And it says the global rich are going green as never before.
[02:35:17.139 --> 02:35:28.225]  The first Sunday Times Green Rich List shows that enthusiasm among the world's wealthiest for investments in areas as diverse as electric cars, solar power, and geothermal energy is unaffected by recession.
[02:35:28.225 --> 02:35:32.487]  So they always say, oh, it's about better cars and things that sound reasonable.
[02:35:32.487 --> 02:35:38.451]  But when you actually read the minutes of these meetings that have been covered by the media, it's population control.
[02:35:38.451 --> 02:35:39.931]  How do we shut off the resources?
[02:35:39.931 --> 02:35:42.333]  How do we destroy the industrial society?
[02:35:42.333 --> 02:35:44.214]  How do we bring back a neo-feudal
[02:35:44.754 --> 02:35:47.197]  ...type of serfdom to control everyone.
[02:35:47.197 --> 02:35:48.838]  And here's another Times of London.
[02:35:48.838 --> 02:35:51.501]  Billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation.
[02:35:51.501 --> 02:35:58.368]  America's rich people, richest people, meet to discuss ways of tackling disastrous environmental, social, and industrial threats.
[02:35:58.368 --> 02:36:05.695]  And at the end of the article, it says the Rockefeller Foundation put it on at Rockefeller University.
[02:36:05.695 --> 02:36:08.358]  It was secret, but they told the Times some of what happened.
[02:36:09.019 --> 02:36:10.661]  And they said, why all the secrecy?
[02:36:10.661 --> 02:36:21.294]  They wanted to speak rich to rich without worrying anything they could and said would end up in the newspapers, painting them as an alternative world government, he said.
[02:36:21.294 --> 02:36:23.457]  Because this meeting went on a week before Bilderberg this year.
[02:36:24.204 --> 02:36:39.857]  Now, you then see the Rockefeller Foundation as the nexus of the directorship, and you're the expert on this, I'm just telling the listeners about it, of all the new carbon tax laws, where they decide who can have a business, where they decide what gets developed, what governments fund.
[02:36:39.857 --> 02:36:48.064]  This is the private banking cartel, through government power, in a tyrannical fashion, taking complete control over society.
[02:36:48.064 --> 02:36:48.745]  Please continue.
[02:36:49.773 --> 02:37:08.842]  Yes, well, boy, there's so much on that and it all, as you said earlier, it goes back to the earliest beginnings of which I'm aware where they actually talked about these strategies was when the tax-exempt foundations amassed tremendous amounts of financial firepower.
[02:37:09.335 --> 02:37:17.260]  We're talking about, as you mentioned, the Carnegie Endowment Fund for International Peace, the Rockefeller Foundation Fund, the Ford Foundation.
[02:37:17.260 --> 02:37:27.746]  People cannot imagine the tremendous amount of money that these tax-exempt foundations have in their bank accounts and invested in producing
[02:37:28.737 --> 02:37:30.519]  You know, constant flow of money.
[02:37:30.519 --> 02:37:36.424]  And they use it, the general impression is that they use it for philanthropic purposes.
[02:37:36.424 --> 02:37:56.381]  But now we're talking about Norman Dodd, who started to investigate these organizations and found out that under the name of, or the cover of, philanthropy, they were actually doing social engineering, and they were doing a government change, and that they were trying to change the actual, the characteristic of the American society.
[02:37:57.140 --> 02:37:59.622]  And it was quite astounding.
[02:37:59.622 --> 02:38:07.406]  And when I read this testimony, I just found it almost, almost impossible to believe.
[02:38:07.406 --> 02:38:12.049]  And so I was traveling in those days back to Virginia.
[02:38:12.984 --> 02:38:19.268]  And we had hired a television crew and we were putting together a little documentary on some topic.
[02:38:19.268 --> 02:38:20.870]  It wasn't this at all.
[02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:23.531]  I've even forgotten the topic at the present time.
[02:38:23.531 --> 02:38:29.796]  But I do know that we had a weekend where we had no appointments and no interviews.
[02:38:29.796 --> 02:38:36.581]  And so I decided to see if I could locate Norman Dodd because I knew the last reference I had, they said he lived in
[02:38:37.461 --> 02:38:37.541]  It's
[02:38:58.248 --> 02:39:00.110]  Was the investigator for the Reese Committee.
[02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:04.434]  He said, yes, that is I. And I said, well, how wonderful.
[02:39:04.434 --> 02:39:05.275]  I'm here.
[02:39:05.275 --> 02:39:08.318]  I have a camera crew and I'm interested in your testimony.
[02:39:08.318 --> 02:39:10.420]  Would you like to speak for our cameras?
[02:39:10.420 --> 02:39:12.602]  He said, well, of course, young man, of course.
[02:39:12.602 --> 02:39:13.924]  It was many years ago.
[02:39:13.924 --> 02:39:20.971]  And so we got him over to where we were staying and I actually captured his whole story on videotape.
[02:39:21.671 --> 02:39:28.515]  And it was a good thing because by that time he was advanced in years and he was not very well at all.
[02:39:28.515 --> 02:39:32.177]  And it wasn't, I think it was less than a year later that he passed away.
[02:39:32.177 --> 02:39:40.662]  So we were fortunate enough to get his testimony again this time spoken to our cameras and I had a chance to question him.
[02:39:40.662 --> 02:39:44.444]  So I became very, very personally familiar with his story.
[02:39:44.444 --> 02:39:48.567]  And I might say that if anybody is interested in this, they can find
[02:39:49.580 --> 02:40:02.648]  The complete description of what he said, and you can find even a reference to the film, the documentary film which we produced based on his testimony, which is called The Hidden Agenda.
[02:40:02.648 --> 02:40:04.930]  And you can find all of that on our website.
[02:40:04.930 --> 02:40:11.954]  In fact, since we're talking about documents, I think a good reference point would be to come to the Freedom Force website.
[02:40:11.954 --> 02:40:14.516]  That's freedomforceinternational.org.
[02:40:16.113 --> 02:40:23.279]  And when you get there to the landing page, you'll see across the top a subsection called The Issues.
[02:40:23.279 --> 02:40:37.210]  And if you'll just navigate to The Issues, at the bottom of that page you'll see a series of essays and references which include almost all of the documents that we're talking about, Alex, including the Norman Dodd testimony.
[02:40:37.782 --> 02:40:45.148]  Absolutely, and people can also Google Norman Dodd, and the video is out on the web, and it's all the key info is there at the Freedom Force website.
[02:40:45.148 --> 02:40:48.991]  We'll give that all out before you leave us again as well.
[02:40:48.991 --> 02:40:56.617]  We also have Carol Quigley, and I want to speak some about that and then get into what's currently happening as we come down to the end game.
[02:40:56.617 --> 02:41:04.823]  And suddenly they go from denying their plans that they were building behind the curtains, now they're launching this warmock, this juggernaut against us, so they've unveiled it.
[02:41:05.559 --> 02:41:13.715]  And they are pushing it and telling everybody how great it is and how wonderful it is and how fantastic it is.
[02:41:13.715 --> 02:41:16.400]  So let's discuss
[02:41:18.342 --> 02:41:18.762]  I don't
[02:41:40.334 --> 02:41:44.719]  Yeah, it's really looking at the wrong place if you're asking why are they super rich.
[02:42:02.930 --> 02:42:03.250]  All right.
[02:42:18.101 --> 02:42:29.697]  And so power-mad people, these control freaks, the predator class, in different ways of saying the same thing, they will gravitate toward any mechanism of power.
[02:42:29.697 --> 02:42:31.640]  Well, that's government, isn't it?
[02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:33.523]  If you can control the levers of
[02:42:33.983 --> 02:42:38.825]  Governmental power, you can really control the population and you can have all the money.
[02:42:38.825 --> 02:42:41.805]  So it's kind of a merger.
[02:42:41.805 --> 02:42:46.867]  And they can pretend to be collectivists on the left or collectivists on the right.
[02:42:46.867 --> 02:42:48.507]  It makes no difference.
[02:42:48.507 --> 02:42:53.429]  Right and left wings are merely two wings of the same ugly bird, which is collectivism.
[02:42:54.069 --> 02:42:59.233]  And like any wings on a bird, they'll flap against each other in order to fly.
[02:42:59.233 --> 02:43:04.817]  You need both wings to fly, so this is the appearance of conflict.
[02:43:04.817 --> 02:43:15.325]  So that, politically speaking, all the dum-dums down at the bottom of this mechanism think that they're, you know, participating in their own political destiny.
[02:43:15.945 --> 02:43:21.170]  Because they can go to the polls and they can vote the rascals out and vote Republican this time.
[02:43:21.170 --> 02:43:22.251]  Oh, we don't like that.
[02:43:22.251 --> 02:43:24.753]  We'll go vote Democrat the next time.
[02:43:24.753 --> 02:43:29.057]  And the two wings beat against each other and the bird flies.
[02:43:29.057 --> 02:43:33.341]  And so that's true not only in our country, but it's true around the world.
[02:43:33.341 --> 02:43:41.148]  And it's true through much of modern history that the conflict, that the big major conflicts of the world, of which we're familiar, World War I,
[02:43:41.909 --> 02:43:45.470]  Okay, we had our customary phone drop, so we're going to get G. Edward Griffin back on.
[02:43:45.470 --> 02:43:46.731]  In fact, let's just have Genesis do it.
[02:43:46.731 --> 02:43:50.072]  Give Genesis his phone number, and we'll just go with the Genesis phone system.
[02:44:11.989 --> 02:44:19.998]  And while we're getting him back on the line, I'll just point out that he is in the film Fall of the Republic.
[02:44:28.709 --> 02:44:30.992]  Follow the Republic, America's last stand.
[02:44:30.992 --> 02:44:32.554]  Make the choice liberty or tyranny.
[02:44:32.554 --> 02:44:36.780]  Follow the Republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the U.S.
[02:44:36.780 --> 02:44:38.162]  economy by design.
[02:44:38.162 --> 02:44:43.569]  Leaders are now declaring that world government has arrived and that the dollar will be replaced with a new global currency.
[02:44:44.406 --> 02:44:48.630]  President Obama has brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[02:44:48.630 --> 02:44:53.994]  Constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council, thus becoming the first U.S.
[02:44:53.994 --> 02:44:56.056]  President to chair the world body.
[02:44:56.056 --> 02:45:03.742]  A sign of a dictatorship is in its final stages of completion, and laws protecting basic human rights are now being abolished worldwide.
[02:45:03.742 --> 02:45:07.145]  An iron curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet.
[02:45:07.145 --> 02:45:09.667]  A worldwide regime controlled by an unelected corporate elite
[02:45:10.493 --> 02:45:17.580]  Uh, is implementing a planetary carbon tax system that will dominate all human activity and establish a system of neo-feudal slavery.
[02:45:17.580 --> 02:45:21.183]  The image makers have carefully packaged Obama as the world's savior.
[02:45:21.183 --> 02:45:26.828]  He is the Trojan horse manufactured to pacify the people just long enough for the globalists to complete their master plan.
[02:45:27.328 --> 02:45:32.872]  The film reveals the architecture of the New World Order and what the power elite have in store for humanity.
[02:45:32.872 --> 02:45:39.597]  More importantly, it communicates how we the people can retake our government, turn the criminal tide, and bring the tyrants to justice.
[02:45:39.597 --> 02:45:43.700]  Fall of the Republic, available on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:45:43.700 --> 02:45:47.983]  Okay, going back to G. Edward Griffin, our line dropped to you.
[02:45:47.983 --> 02:45:49.644]  Continue where you left off, sir.
[02:45:50.044 --> 02:45:51.764]  Yeah, I don't know what happened.
[02:45:51.764 --> 02:45:53.445]  All of a sudden I was talking to a dead phone.
[02:45:53.445 --> 02:46:05.567]  But anyway, it was probably the universe speaking to me because I realized I was digressing from your initial question, which is why do these people always gravitate toward government?
[02:46:05.567 --> 02:46:10.468]  And the word that was used was the super-rich or the very rich.
[02:46:10.468 --> 02:46:13.969]  Well, actually, you know, in the beginning of this country, America
[02:46:14.629 --> 02:46:19.412]  Surpassed the rest of the world through a very simple principle.
[02:46:19.412 --> 02:46:22.114]  It's called free enterprise competition.
[02:46:22.114 --> 02:46:25.616]  And under those conditions, people compete.
[02:46:25.616 --> 02:46:30.539]  They produce the best product and service they possibly can at the lowest possible price.
[02:46:30.539 --> 02:46:35.602]  And this leads to great systems of efficiency and productivity.
[02:46:35.602 --> 02:46:39.024]  And that, in my view, is what made America so great.
[02:46:39.024 --> 02:46:42.046]  Because we came from a virtual wilderness.
[02:46:42.766 --> 02:46:48.891]  Uh, Europe was already far ahead of us, but we bypassed Europe because of free enterprise competition.
[02:46:48.891 --> 02:47:03.744]  Well, then about toward the end of the 1800s, um, these very wealthy people, uh, who had become the captains of industry, as I like to call them, you know, the Rockefellers and the Carnegies and so forth, had already reached great, um,
[02:47:04.584 --> 02:47:10.950]  Uh, fortunes, acquired great fortunes, and decided that competition was no longer in their best interest.
[02:47:10.950 --> 02:47:14.392]  And they began to look for ways to eliminate competition.
[02:47:14.392 --> 02:47:17.935]  In fact, John D. Rockefeller said it best.
[02:47:17.935 --> 02:47:20.357]  He's quoted by all of his biographers.
[02:47:20.357 --> 02:47:22.999]  He said, competition is a sin.
[02:47:22.999 --> 02:47:29.525]  Well, of course it's a sin if you're at the top of the pyramid and you don't want anybody competing with you because you're already in first place.
[02:47:29.525 --> 02:47:31.847]  Then you say competition is a sin.
[02:47:32.547 --> 02:47:42.490]  And from that period of history, about the 1880s on, there was a rather substantial and rapid change in the way Americans did business.
[02:47:42.490 --> 02:48:01.176]  Instead of free enterprise competition, they began to coalesce into cartels and form monopolies, and to go into partnership with government to pass laws, always in the name of protecting the people, but laws which in reality eliminated competition.
[02:48:01.676 --> 02:48:02.037]  Thank you.
[02:48:09.326 --> 02:48:13.108]  And so we saw a change in the way people became rich.
[02:48:13.108 --> 02:48:17.509]  It used to be they became rich by competing and by producing goods and services.
[02:48:17.509 --> 02:48:34.136]  And then by the 1900s, they became rich by not competing and instead using their prowess and their expertise to buy politicians, to create laws that would eliminate their competition and give them unfair advantage.
[02:48:34.136 --> 02:48:34.657]  And so that's how...
[02:48:35.757 --> 02:48:45.446]  That's how we see the big bankers publicly funding fascism and communism, now declassified that Hitler and Mussolini were MI5 and were basically set up.
[02:48:45.446 --> 02:48:59.140]  I mean, this is the sophistication of the Milner Group and this British model, this imperial model of hiding your true government behind front men, and so elites can come in and
[02:48:59.804 --> 02:49:06.410]  Have the government give them the power to issue currency and credit and buy up the planet, but still some people don't want to sell.
[02:49:06.410 --> 02:49:14.558]  So now you pass big environmental laws, which the Rockefellers admit they founded, which they also founded the worldwide acceptance of eugenics.
[02:49:15.158 --> 02:49:19.121]  Over a hundred years ago, as you know, the rock stars were scientists.
[02:49:19.121 --> 02:49:37.712]  And these elites were smart, they financed most of the scientists, and they said, come up with systems of social control to divide and conquer people, to dumb them down, to take over government, to centralize control, to take over education, to render the public weak and impotent against us.
[02:49:37.712 --> 02:49:42.475]  As Bertrand Russell said, through social engineering that the elite finance, in his own words,
[02:49:43.296 --> 02:49:47.641]  A rebellion by the lower classes, or the proles, as he called it.
[02:49:47.641 --> 02:49:55.251]  He was using communist terminology, though he worked for the big money banks and was MI6 himself, and OSS before that, Nobel Prize winner.
[02:49:55.251 --> 02:49:57.655]  He said, a rebellion by the proles.
[02:49:58.355 --> 02:50:12.872]  We'll be as unthinkable as a rebellion of sheep against the practice of eating mutton or sheep is what mutton means for those that don't know so they're saying we're blind dumb sheep that sheep don't rebel against their owner when they're getting slaughtered do they G Edward?
[02:50:13.252 --> 02:50:39.012]  Well, no, and cattle don't, and a lot of all those domesticated animals don't, and now we're back to Norman Dodd, because what he discovered when he was talking with the heads of these tax-exempt foundations is that they were laying a master plan which had as its goal how to make the population of America docile, like cattle and sheep, and how to get them to accept all of these things without complaint.
[02:50:40.812 --> 02:50:42.193]  Stay there.
[02:50:42.193 --> 02:50:52.135]  We're going to talk about that strategy on the other side, then bring it forward to current times and then the future with G. Edward Griffin.
[02:50:52.135 --> 02:50:53.056]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:53.056 --> 02:51:00.458]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:00.458 --> 02:51:02.418]  This is an emergency alert.
[02:51:02.418 --> 02:51:04.839]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[02:51:05.911 --> 02:51:19.359]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert urging you to go to FluScam.com and learn the secrets behind the current flu, who's behind it, the labs it came from, and the vaccine poisons.
[02:51:19.359 --> 02:51:30.946]  Learn why Barack Obama's ScienceR recommends vaccinations to sterilize people to reduce populations, and why OxySilver is making vaccinations and toxic antibiotics unnecessary.
[02:51:31.738 --> 02:51:34.839]  OxySilver is far safer than colloidal silvers.
[02:51:34.839 --> 02:51:42.701]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting you and your family, it has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.

[02:52:01.616 --> 02:52:05.646]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:05.646 --> 02:52:08.914]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:08.914 --> 02:52:10.317]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:11.007 --> 02:52:14.049]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.049 --> 02:52:20.092]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.092 --> 02:52:25.634]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:25.634 --> 02:52:35.259]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:35.379 --> 02:52:37.720]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:37.720 --> 02:52:39.300]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:39.300 --> 02:52:41.761]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:41.761 --> 02:52:43.902]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:43.902 --> 02:52:49.044]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.044 --> 02:52:58.148]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:00.513 --> 02:53:03.817]  Each day, one in four Americans visits a fast food restaurant.
[02:53:03.817 --> 02:53:06.439]  60% of all Americans are either overweight or obese.
[02:53:06.439 --> 02:53:08.622]  Fast food can bring fast lives to a screeching halt.
[02:53:10.026 --> 02:53:11.827]  Fast food is toxic food.
[02:53:11.827 --> 02:53:15.369]  One of the benefits of colon cleansing is to detoxify from fast food.
[02:53:15.369 --> 02:53:20.392]  Since 1985, thousands of Americans have chosen MediCleanse, the original colon cleanse.
[02:53:20.392 --> 02:53:29.638]  MediCleanse is a high-fiber colon cleansing product made from a carefully balanced combination of pure and natural ingredients, ground flaxseed, whole psyllium husks, and food-grade benign clay.

[02:54:00.387 --> 02:54:03.590]  Federal Agents, we are armed!
[02:54:21.688 --> 02:54:27.974]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest with us for about 45 minutes into the next hour.
[02:54:46.844 --> 02:54:48.946]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[02:54:48.946 --> 02:54:51.768]  Okay, G. Edward, you've got to the point of domestication.
[02:54:51.768 --> 02:55:11.745]  And literally, we have hundreds of textbooks, thousands of white papers, congressional reports, the foundations themselves, scientific dictatorship, global government, to carry out a global police state, that's their quotes, to force one-child policy, sterilization, eugenics, mainstream news reporting, the elite are obsessed with this.
[02:55:13.254 --> 02:55:15.056]  These are very, very greedy people.
[02:55:15.056 --> 02:55:16.959]  They want the life extension technologies.
[02:55:16.959 --> 02:55:19.181]  They want the cancer cures for themselves.
[02:55:19.181 --> 02:55:20.883]  They want total control.
[02:55:20.883 --> 02:55:21.664]  They want it now.
[02:55:21.664 --> 02:55:28.172]  So now Al Gore admits his new movies about how it's a religion, how the environment's a religion.
[02:55:28.172 --> 02:55:30.434]  They always plan to have the UN religion.
[02:55:30.434 --> 02:55:31.836]  It's all now happening.
[02:55:31.836 --> 02:55:32.457]  Please continue.
[02:55:33.098 --> 02:55:39.060]  Well, yes, and just before the break we were talking about the strategy, the fact that this is not an accident.
[02:55:39.060 --> 02:55:40.941]  This is not new.
[02:55:40.941 --> 02:55:49.004]  The foundation for this was laid in strategic form well at the turn of the last century, but we were talking about Norman Dodd.
[02:55:49.004 --> 02:55:54.105]  I keep coming back to him because I think there's so much to be learned from his testimony.
[02:55:54.105 --> 02:55:59.027]  And basically when he went in, he talked to the head of the Ford Foundation.
[02:55:59.027 --> 02:56:01.688]  There's a guy by the name of Gaither, I think was his name.
[02:56:02.288 --> 02:56:09.911]  And he said, Mr. Gaither, I would like very much to know what you folks are doing here.
[02:56:09.911 --> 02:56:16.053]  And he said, without any hesitation, Gaither said, well, Mr. Dodd, I can tell you exactly what we're doing here.
[02:56:16.053 --> 02:56:28.518]  He said, we are putting our resources to work so as to change the United States of America so it can be comfortably merged with the Soviet Union.
[02:56:28.518 --> 02:56:29.899]  Those were his exact words.
[02:56:30.539 --> 02:56:33.781]  And Dodd said he almost fell off of his chair when he heard that.
[02:56:33.781 --> 02:56:35.662]  And he said it wasn't just the Soviet Union.
[02:56:35.662 --> 02:56:36.442]  It wasn't that.
[02:56:36.442 --> 02:56:37.963]  It was communism that they wanted.
[02:56:37.963 --> 02:56:47.929]  But the fact was, if you could merge the United States with the Soviet Union, which was at the opposite end, the people thought, of the political spectrum, well, you could merge it with any nation.
[02:56:47.929 --> 02:56:59.375]  And that was the real goal, because they were trying to set up a merger process in which the United States would be merged with the Soviet Union, Red China, France, England, Germany, you know.
[02:56:59.875 --> 02:57:01.096]  The world.
[02:57:01.096 --> 02:57:04.377]  And he said, well, how can you do that?
[02:57:04.377 --> 02:57:12.502]  And he got the answer when he visited the offices of the Carnegie Endowment Fund for International Peace.
[02:57:12.502 --> 02:57:18.025]  He said, you can take a look at our minute books and you can see what we do here.
[02:57:18.025 --> 02:57:21.967]  And the answer came, here's the answer, the strategy that I'm finally building to.
[02:57:22.467 --> 02:57:31.511]  They said the American people will never surrender their affinity to their legal system, their customs, their traditions.
[02:57:31.511 --> 02:57:32.351]  You know, none of that.
[02:57:32.351 --> 02:57:41.475]  The people in America are different and they'll never give up any of that unless, unless they're frightened into it.
[02:57:41.475 --> 02:57:44.896]  If they thought that it was necessary in order to survive.
[02:57:45.623 --> 02:57:51.487]  Then they will give up everything because survival is the most basic instinct of all human beings.
[02:57:51.487 --> 02:58:05.435]  And so therefore, if you're going to change life in the United States so it can be comfortably merged with the Soviet Union and any other totalitarian system in the world, you must make the United States a totalitarian system.
[02:58:05.435 --> 02:58:10.958]  And the way to do that is to scare the people by getting them embroiled into wars.
[02:58:10.958 --> 02:58:12.399]  And this is the amazing part.
[02:58:13.626 --> 02:58:28.298]  The Carnegie Endowment Fund for Peace then plotted to get the United States into World War I and to prolong it, and they said, if you can get the American people into war and be afraid of their survival, they will accept a totalitarian government.
[02:58:28.758 --> 02:58:30.080]  So let's be clear.
[02:58:30.080 --> 02:58:38.932]  It is on record, in the congressional record, the foundations admit they started World War I and World War II to get the UN and the world government.
[02:58:38.932 --> 02:58:40.674]  They are the warmongers.
[02:58:40.674 --> 02:58:45.661]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:46.401 --> 02:58:50.404]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:50.404 --> 02:58:58.130]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:58:58.130 --> 02:59:06.896]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks and we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:59:07.176 --> 02:59:13.460]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:59:13.460 --> 02:59:17.523]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:59:17.523 --> 02:59:22.886]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:59:23.146 --> 02:59:25.226]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:59:25.226 --> 02:59:26.967]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:59:26.967 --> 02:59:29.507]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:59:29.507 --> 02:59:34.228]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:59:34.228 --> 02:59:37.929]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:59:37.929 --> 02:59:41.050]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:59:41.050 --> 02:59:42.950]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:59:42.950 --> 02:59:45.071]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:59:53.357 --> 02:59:55.738]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:55.738 --> 03:00:04.783]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:04.783 --> 03:00:06.103]  Big Brother.
[03:00:06.103 --> 03:00:07.864]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:07.864 --> 03:00:09.625]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:09.625 --> 03:00:11.206]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.206 --> 03:00:12.166]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:12.166 --> 03:00:16.949]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:16.949 --> 03:00:21.011]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.291 --> 03:00:24.832]  Good morning Alex, how are you doing today?
[03:00:24.832 --> 03:00:26.192]  Pretty good, my friend.
[03:00:52.935 --> 03:00:59.137]  I want to talk about stuff that's going on with the internet, as well as the flu.
[03:00:59.137 --> 03:01:02.977]  The hundreds of different ways they're announcing they're going to tax, regulate, and shut it down?
[03:01:02.977 --> 03:01:04.158]  It's official, yes.
[03:01:04.158 --> 03:01:08.019]  The secret copyright treaty now leaked?
[03:01:08.019 --> 03:01:21.822]  You can take this for what it's worth, but from internal sources, from one person that was a former employee at Fort Detrick Bioweapons Laboratory in Maryland, that then went to the CDC as well.
[03:01:22.652 --> 03:01:30.237]  As someone who was very high-ranking military that, from what I understand, got direct info from Northern Command.
[03:01:30.237 --> 03:01:31.357]  This was back in April.
[03:01:31.357 --> 03:01:45.846]  They both said that when the original swine flu was talked about by the mainstream media, that they said that they were coming and that this was the endgame right there.
[03:01:45.846 --> 03:01:49.508]  That this was a bioengineered weapon.
[03:01:49.508 --> 03:01:51.509]  Dr. A. Truot, who you've heard of,
[03:01:52.698 --> 03:02:03.463]  He has a paper that he wrote where he, one of the interesting things he cites is that this, that that virus was engineered using the PROMIS software.
[03:02:03.463 --> 03:02:13.628]  That, which is the same stuff that Michael Ricconi-Shuto, who was a former CIA scientist, built a backdoor for in the 80s.
[03:02:13.628 --> 03:02:18.811]  Well PROMIS software is to track financial operations and stocks and bond trading.
[03:02:19.335 --> 03:02:23.100]  What do you mean it was used to write the virus?
[03:02:23.100 --> 03:02:31.430]  It's, uh, it's, well, it was originally, it was, okay, later, when it was originally developed, it didn't have those capabilities that I'm talking about, but later,
[03:02:32.502 --> 03:02:47.430]  Artificial intelligence capabilities were added to it by GE Aerospace and have since been greatly expanded by a place called the System Architectures Laboratory at George Mason University under Alexander Levis.
[03:02:47.430 --> 03:02:58.335]  This is cited directly from the guy who was the Chief Scientist for P-TECH, Dr. Hussein Ibrahim, who Indira Singh mentions in her
[03:02:59.122 --> 03:03:01.243]  In her testimony regarding this.
[03:03:01.243 --> 03:03:10.285]  And basically the software is used to analyze, it's run on supercomputers and they use it to analyze the genetic sequencing using something called reverse genetics.
[03:03:10.285 --> 03:03:17.487]  Well I know that's what IBM and the Human Genome are doing at the Eugenics Headquarters, Cold Springs Harbor.
[03:03:17.487 --> 03:03:23.548]  And this can be backed up by research if you just, you can independently verify this.
[03:03:23.548 --> 03:03:27.309]  Well do this, write us an article because I think I recognize your voice, you've written some good
[03:03:28.210 --> 03:03:30.232]  Info at the Prison Planet Forum.
[03:03:30.232 --> 03:03:31.793]  Why don't you write it all up?
[03:03:31.793 --> 03:03:33.775]  Send it to writers at InfoWars.com.
[03:03:33.775 --> 03:03:38.019]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:38.019 --> 03:03:53.273]  I know that a few months ago there was that Israeli spy who they said was threatening the White House and they were gassing his car and no one knew how for hours he could take the tear gas and then they grabbed him and it did turn out that he reportedly called into radio shows
[03:03:54.033 --> 03:04:05.341]  And had warned everybody that there was going to be a bioweapon release in the flu vaccine and I've tried to look over that and it's not completely substantiated, but very interesting and we are trying to look into it.
[03:04:05.341 --> 03:04:10.565]  There's just so much happening, but thank you so much for reminding me of that report.
[03:04:10.565 --> 03:04:11.365]  We put links to it.
[03:04:11.365 --> 03:04:21.673]  Kurt Nimmo wrote a story two days ago with a hyperlink at the bottom to some of the sites that are reporting that and Kurt said, you know, we can't prove this, but this is what people are saying and ask other researchers to
[03:04:23.723 --> 03:04:28.555]  Look into that for themselves, but there's no doubt the globalists are moving on every front.
[03:04:28.555 --> 03:04:29.538]  There is no doubt
[03:04:30.313 --> 03:04:33.094]  That we are in a very, very serious time right now.
[03:04:33.094 --> 03:04:36.475]  We're going to go to break and come back with Congressman Ron Paul.
[03:04:36.475 --> 03:04:45.979]  We're going to start simulcasting the radio show live on the internet via television at PrisonPlanet.tv as we fight the construction of the prison planet.
[03:04:45.979 --> 03:04:55.923]  We'll talk to Ron Paul about his speaking tour, about the impending death of the dollar, about the flu, Afghanistan, the Republicans' big win in New Jersey and Virginia.
[03:04:55.923 --> 03:04:59.544]  We'll talk about a whole bunch of issues, Obama's Cybersecurity Act as well.
[03:05:01.508 --> 03:05:05.529]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:05:05.529 --> 03:05:08.770]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:05:08.770 --> 03:05:13.551]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:05:13.551 --> 03:05:19.953]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:05:19.953 --> 03:05:22.194]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:05:22.734 --> 03:05:23.034]  Tim Geithner?
[03:05:23.034 --> 03:05:23.554]  Bernanke?
[03:05:23.554 --> 03:05:24.075]  They're arsonists!
[03:05:24.075 --> 03:05:24.875]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:05:24.875 --> 03:05:26.996]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:05:41.641 --> 03:05:43.782]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:05:43.782 --> 03:05:48.903]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:05:48.903 --> 03:05:58.025]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:00.046 --> 03:06:09.192]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:06:09.192 --> 03:06:12.574]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:06:12.574 --> 03:06:18.437]  Instead, use vitamin C-D and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[03:06:18.437 --> 03:06:23.220]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:06:23.220 --> 03:06:25.562]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:06:25.842 --> 03:06:26.202]  I'm good.
[03:06:42.489 --> 03:06:42.689]  Thank you.
[03:07:00.714 --> 03:07:03.715]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:07:03.715 --> 03:07:09.057]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:07:09.057 --> 03:07:11.098]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:07:11.098 --> 03:07:16.099]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:07:16.099 --> 03:07:17.280]  How much do you want?
[03:07:17.280 --> 03:07:18.400]  When do you want it?
[03:07:18.400 --> 03:07:20.281]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:07:20.281 --> 03:07:21.361]  When will you need it?
[03:07:21.361 --> 03:07:23.562]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:07:23.562 --> 03:07:24.903]  Will there be any food?
[03:07:24.903 --> 03:07:26.203]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:07:26.423 --> 03:07:31.689]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:07:31.689 --> 03:07:35.273]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:07:35.273 --> 03:07:39.098]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:07:39.098 --> 03:07:40.339]  How much will you need?
[03:07:40.339 --> 03:07:41.240]  We don't know.
[03:07:41.240 --> 03:07:42.342]  How much do you want?
[03:07:42.342 --> 03:07:43.283]  All you can get.
[03:07:43.283 --> 03:07:44.084]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:07:44.344 --> 03:07:47.406]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:07:47.406 --> 03:07:54.932]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:07:54.932 --> 03:07:56.093]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:56.093 --> 03:08:08.582]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:17.401 --> 03:08:18.842]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:08:18.842 --> 03:08:20.503]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:08:20.503 --> 03:08:26.027]  We're also simulcasting the radio show live right now on Living Color at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:26.027 --> 03:08:39.556]  It is Thursday, the fifth day of November 2009, and for the next 20 minutes or so, Congressman Ron Paul joins us from Capitol Hill, and there is a lot to talk about today.
[03:08:39.556 --> 03:08:42.118]  First off, out of the gates, you obviously got
[03:08:43.379 --> 03:08:48.384]  290 plus sponsors to begin the audit of the private secret of Federal Reserve.
[03:08:48.384 --> 03:08:53.990]  You've talked this week about some maneuvers by some of the committee chairmen to gut the bill.
[03:08:53.990 --> 03:08:58.975]  Can you give us an update on where your legislation is going, Congressman?
[03:08:58.975 --> 03:09:05.102]  Well, actually right now we have 309 and that's 130 some Democrats as well as all the Republicans.
[03:09:05.896 --> 03:09:19.289]  And at one time, Mel Watt had indicated to me that he would get a provision put in the bill by Barney Frank, which would be a very, very limited version of an audit, which would be a distraction, if nothing else.
[03:09:19.289 --> 03:09:25.556]  Even though the little bit he was doing, it was okay, it was just so small, it was canceling out most of what I wanted to do.
[03:09:26.417 --> 03:09:28.858]  But his provision didn't get put into the bill.
[03:09:28.858 --> 03:09:31.579]  We're now in the middle of doing the bill.
[03:09:31.579 --> 03:09:37.021]  I thought there was even a chance today that I would get to offer my amendment, which is 1207, to the bill.
[03:09:37.021 --> 03:09:49.605]  But it was just announced a few minutes ago that Barney Frank said that, well, the controversial type of amendments won't be done until after the Labor Day or the Veterans Day break, which is next week.
[03:09:49.605 --> 03:09:52.186]  So it won't be this week, and it won't be next week, but the following week.
[03:09:53.346 --> 03:09:58.950]  I suspect they're just lining up their ducks and there'll probably be lots of attempts to water things down.
[03:09:58.950 --> 03:09:59.990]  But I don't know.
[03:09:59.990 --> 03:10:02.051]  We'll have to wait and see.
[03:10:02.051 --> 03:10:02.972]  We're in the middle of it.
[03:10:02.972 --> 03:10:09.496]  We're coming close to at least a initial climax of the bill on what the banking committee will do.
[03:10:09.496 --> 03:10:12.557]  And it has to survive there.
[03:10:12.557 --> 03:10:17.140]  It has to come out there pretty whole or things won't look so good for us.
[03:10:17.140 --> 03:10:18.941]  But I'm cautiously optimistic about it.
[03:10:19.466 --> 03:10:21.306]  But the momentum's clearly shifted.
[03:10:21.306 --> 03:10:24.067]  Twenty-something years ago, you might get two or three co-sponsors.
[03:10:24.067 --> 03:10:27.888]  Now you have over 300, a giant House majority.
[03:10:27.888 --> 03:10:32.089]  So the momentum is shifting against the secretive organization.
[03:10:32.089 --> 03:10:39.831]  Yeah, and if we can get a clean vote, I can't imagine very many wanting to be on record to vote against this.
[03:10:39.831 --> 03:10:47.133]  It just is going to give them a lot of grief, especially... Congressman?
[03:10:52.922 --> 03:10:55.843]  Okay.
[03:10:55.843 --> 03:10:57.284]  Phone system glitch.
[03:10:57.284 --> 03:11:06.827]  We will get Congressman Ron Paul back on with us in just a moment.
[03:11:06.827 --> 03:11:11.409]  Tell ya, we got gremlins in our phone system, or the Congressman does.
[03:11:11.409 --> 03:11:20.172]  I got a whole host of important questions that I want to ask the Congressman here today.
[03:11:20.172 --> 03:11:21.333]  And we're gonna be going over those
[03:11:22.182 --> 03:11:46.256]  Here in just a moment with him, like the death of the dollar, the flu situation, Afghanistan, the big Republican wins in New Jersey, and Virginia, and a lot more.
[03:11:46.256 --> 03:11:46.776]  All right.
[03:11:48.391 --> 03:11:58.739]  And of course we will post this archived up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:11:58.739 --> 03:12:00.620]  Okay, Congressman, got you back quickly.
[03:12:00.620 --> 03:12:06.345]  Thank you.
[03:12:06.345 --> 03:12:13.070]  That is a phone system situation happening, obviously, on their end.
[03:12:13.070 --> 03:12:16.953]  So we will try to get Congressman Ron Paul back on
[03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:22.361]  Right now.
[03:12:22.361 --> 03:12:32.363]  In the meantime, we do have Joe Rogan joining us later in studio today, and Lawrence J. Kotlikoff.
[03:12:32.363 --> 03:12:47.966]  He, of course, is a Boston University professor of economics to discuss the McClatchy newspaper article that he was quoted in that we have been discussing.
[03:12:50.302 --> 03:12:54.145]  Al Goldman Sachs secretly bet on the U.S.
[03:12:54.145 --> 03:12:55.065]  housing crash.
[03:12:55.065 --> 03:12:56.786]  Okay, maybe three's the charm.
[03:12:56.786 --> 03:12:58.007]  Congressman, do we have you?
[03:12:58.007 --> 03:12:58.567]  I'm back.
[03:12:58.567 --> 03:13:00.669]  I don't know what happened.
[03:13:00.669 --> 03:13:03.671]  Gremlins in the House switchboard.
[03:13:03.671 --> 03:13:05.612]  Okay, you were finishing up with the Fed.
[03:13:05.612 --> 03:13:13.417]  On monetary policy, Congressman, you've long talked about the central banks using the dollar to prop up the empire.
[03:13:13.417 --> 03:13:16.078]  Now the G20's discussing abandoning the dollar.
[03:13:18.002 --> 03:13:25.685]  What is happening from your research perspective with the dollar right now, and what will happen if the dollar is fully abandoned?
[03:13:25.685 --> 03:13:27.366]  I don't think anybody knows right now.
[03:13:27.366 --> 03:13:35.670]  If they just let it go and the dollar's rejected, then it'll be... people will have to resort to sound money, and they'd have to resort to commodity money.
[03:13:36.388 --> 03:13:44.140]  But, as you say, the G20 or the IMF and the world leaders, so to speak, are going to try to replace it.
[03:13:44.140 --> 03:13:48.306]  I think the market has replaced the dollar reserve standard.
[03:13:48.306 --> 03:13:49.247]  They've gotten rid of that.
[03:13:49.247 --> 03:13:50.690]  I don't think they can rebuild on that.
[03:13:51.437 --> 03:13:56.418]  So they are rushing around trying to figure out what they'll replace it with.
[03:13:56.418 --> 03:13:59.699]  I think what they'll try to do is come up with a basket of currencies.
[03:13:59.699 --> 03:14:04.540]  They even might be tempted to put a little bit of gold in there, but it's not going to suffice.
[03:14:04.540 --> 03:14:12.962]  If they don't have even a little bit of gold, even if they come up with another worldwide fiat standard, I don't think it's going to convey trust.
[03:14:12.962 --> 03:14:14.322]  I think they're behind.
[03:14:14.322 --> 03:14:18.343]  They're between the rock and the hard place, and it's not going to be easy for them to push something on us.
[03:14:19.023 --> 03:14:19.624]  Absolutely.
[03:14:19.624 --> 03:14:22.446]  So just to be clear, you agree with the big economic headlines we've seen the last month.
[03:14:39.682 --> 03:14:43.025]  That the dollar as the world reserve currency has been abandoned.
[03:14:43.025 --> 03:14:50.230]  China, India, the European Union, the Arabs are now buying more foreign currencies than they are the dollar.
[03:14:50.230 --> 03:14:58.956]  They still hold an overall majority of dollars at around 62 to 63 percent, but they are now abandoning the dollar as reserve currency.
[03:14:58.956 --> 03:14:59.977]  A, do you agree with that?
[03:14:59.977 --> 03:15:02.599]  B, what will this do to our economy?
[03:15:03.402 --> 03:15:04.603]  It's going to hurt the economy.
[03:15:04.603 --> 03:15:08.925]  I wouldn't say it's abandoned, but it's less important all the time.
[03:15:08.925 --> 03:15:14.008]  I mean, the fact that they can still have 60% reserves means it's still there.
[03:15:14.008 --> 03:15:19.631]  But the market, I look at the market signals, and I think the thing that happened this week was very, very significant.
[03:15:20.291 --> 03:15:25.475]  That is when the IMF announced that they're going to dump 200 tons of gold on the market.
[03:15:25.475 --> 03:15:34.062]  Well, you know, ordinarily, a person would think, and they were hoping, well, a lot of that gold out there, that's going to drive down the price of gold and make all the fiat currencies look better.
[03:15:34.062 --> 03:15:35.263]  But what happened?
[03:15:35.263 --> 03:15:38.926]  A bank from Asia, India, buys the whole lot.
[03:15:39.406 --> 03:15:46.693]  Which sent a signal, I think, to the world markets that, in essence, gold has been re-monetized.
[03:15:46.693 --> 03:15:52.838]  It never gets demonetized, but it has less importance as money when all the countries reject it.
[03:15:52.838 --> 03:16:00.705]  But I think this is a major, major signal that the dollar's getting closer on its last legs and gold is getting more important.
[03:16:00.705 --> 03:16:02.547]  And as the Chinese buy less and less,
[03:16:02.927 --> 03:16:10.611]  They have already started buying gold and they don't want to buy too much too fast and, you know, shoot the price up, you know, too quickly.
[03:16:10.611 --> 03:16:11.852]  I think that's coming.
[03:16:11.852 --> 03:16:15.794]  I think the gold price is destined to go a lot higher and the dollar is going to go a lot lower.
[03:16:15.794 --> 03:16:19.576]  And they cannot dethrone gold.
[03:16:19.576 --> 03:16:22.678]  They can disrupt and play these games for a long, long time.
[03:16:23.318 --> 03:16:31.965]  But in many ways this is very, very good because it tells us that the governments no longer can get away with just printing money to finance their schemes.
[03:16:31.965 --> 03:16:36.868]  It's their schemes that are so damaging to us, whether it's the welfare or the warfare.
[03:16:36.868 --> 03:16:39.350]  It all hurts the people because they have to pay the bills.
[03:16:39.350 --> 03:16:46.776]  So some of these things are good signals, although it means that we have to be concerned about the chaos that might erupt.
[03:16:46.776 --> 03:16:47.436]  Absolutely.
[03:16:49.113 --> 03:16:55.357]  Congressman, the private central banks, as you know, are financing the Copenhagen Treaty.
[03:16:55.357 --> 03:17:01.822]  I have the treaty here in front of me, all 200 pages of the Framework Convention on Climate Change.
[03:17:01.822 --> 03:17:13.270]  It states, as Ban Ki-moon wrote last week in the New York Times, that this is global governance and that select groups of private interest
[03:17:14.053 --> 03:17:18.556]  ...are going to be able to decide who can have a factory, who can have a business.
[03:17:18.556 --> 03:17:21.237]  They can decide who's going to get the carbon credits.
[03:17:21.237 --> 03:17:25.800]  This scheme was designed by Ken Lay, as Congress has reported.
[03:17:25.800 --> 03:17:33.584]  The Senate committee has now approved the climate bill, as Reuters reports.
[03:17:33.584 --> 03:17:42.869]  If our economy, under globalization and NAFTA and GATT, is already sputtering, what's going to happen if we allow the very same central banks to create this new derivative system?
[03:17:43.672 --> 03:17:52.714]  Well, if it works, it'll work for a short while, and companies like Goldman Sachs and a few others will rip us off, and they'll, you know, get even more wealth.
[03:17:52.714 --> 03:17:54.495]  But it cannot help the economy.
[03:17:54.495 --> 03:17:55.955]  It has to hurt the economy.
[03:17:55.955 --> 03:18:00.496]  And it can't possibly help the environment, because they're totally off track on that.
[03:18:00.496 --> 03:18:07.558]  It might turn out to be one of the biggest hoaxes of all history, this whole global warming terrorism that they've been using.
[03:18:07.558 --> 03:18:09.758]  So, we'll have to just wait and see.
[03:18:09.758 --> 03:18:10.899]  But it cannot be helpful.
[03:18:10.899 --> 03:18:11.879]  It's going to hurt everybody.
[03:18:13.294 --> 03:18:16.915]  What's the inside baseball word in Congress?
[03:18:16.915 --> 03:18:32.559]  Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer say they're going to be able to pass it this year or next year, but more and more evidence on the ground shows that we're going to be able to beat the House and Senate version of the climate bill that is meant to tie into the Copenhagen UN takeover.
[03:18:33.280 --> 03:18:38.022]  I think there is a chance, and I think these elections might send a signal.
[03:18:38.022 --> 03:18:51.947]  I think the continual presence of the Tea Party movement and the people speaking out might wake them up finally, you know, and say, hey, maybe we are doing too much too fast, and they might back off.
[03:18:51.947 --> 03:18:56.548]  Right now, they're not absolutely positive they have the votes on this medical bill.
[03:18:56.548 --> 03:18:59.329]  We'll know shortly whether the House will see if they have the votes.
[03:18:59.329 --> 03:19:01.290]  They think the House can do it faster than the Senate.
[03:19:01.670 --> 03:19:04.872]  They're going to try to do that on Saturday of this week.
[03:19:04.872 --> 03:19:08.333]  But they have a few problems.
[03:19:08.333 --> 03:19:13.956]  It's not automatic, and thank goodness for radio talk shows and the internet for us to get this information out.
[03:19:13.956 --> 03:19:15.117]  That's what's rallying the troops.
[03:19:15.117 --> 03:19:17.198]  It certainly is in the mainstream media.
[03:19:17.198 --> 03:19:20.879]  Speaking of the internet, we're talking to Congressman Ron Paul.
[03:19:20.879 --> 03:19:23.421]  We now have the Cybersecurity Act.
[03:19:23.421 --> 03:19:27.863]  Three days ago, finally, the national security blocked.
[03:19:29.730 --> 03:19:48.577]  Copyright treaty has now leaked and it says open taxing, open regulation of the web, ICANN being handed over to the UN, total control, guilty until proven innocent, copyright rules, shutting down websites, ISPs, and really UN control over the internet.
[03:19:48.577 --> 03:19:50.198]  Where do you stand on that, Congressman?
[03:19:51.149 --> 03:20:03.936]  Well, it's very frightening, and I think that if they're successful, let's just hope that internet is too big and too complex for them ever to have controls, but they're making... This is not a drill.
[03:20:03.936 --> 03:20:05.877]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[03:20:07.875 --> 03:20:08.455]  I don't know.
[03:20:26.561 --> 03:20:26.961]  We're good to go!
[03:20:55.780 --> 03:20:56.741]  Hide your guns!
[03:20:56.741 --> 03:20:58.023]  HideYourGuns.com right now!
[03:21:11.420 --> 03:21:14.001]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:14.001 --> 03:21:20.382]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:20.382 --> 03:21:25.564]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:25.564 --> 03:21:35.566]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:35.686 --> 03:21:38.031]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:38.031 --> 03:21:39.614]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:39.614 --> 03:21:42.098]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.098 --> 03:21:44.222]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:44.222 --> 03:21:45.745]  And right now in Washington, D.C.
[03:21:46.448 --> 03:21:49.351]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:49.351 --> 03:22:00.341]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:22:00.341 --> 03:22:05.926]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[03:22:06.667 --> 03:22:11.610]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[03:22:11.610 --> 03:22:15.692]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[03:22:15.692 --> 03:22:17.013]  Let's put this another way.
[03:22:17.013 --> 03:22:22.376]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[03:22:22.376 --> 03:22:25.278]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[03:22:25.278 --> 03:22:27.940]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[03:22:27.940 --> 03:22:29.661]  You can possess it in your hand.
[03:22:29.661 --> 03:22:30.921]  You can take it with you.
[03:22:30.921 --> 03:22:32.402]  Gold is real money.
[03:22:32.402 --> 03:22:33.463]  Gold is honest money.
[03:22:33.743 --> 03:22:36.465]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.
[03:22:36.465 --> 03:22:43.590]  To find out how you can protect your savings and roll over your IRA funds into precious metal accounts, call me at 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[03:22:43.590 --> 03:22:44.511]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[03:22:44.511 --> 03:22:45.431]  800-686-2237, extension 134.
[03:23:01.513 --> 03:23:03.253]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[03:23:03.253 --> 03:23:07.054]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[03:23:07.054 --> 03:23:11.896]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[03:23:11.896 --> 03:23:17.577]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[03:23:17.577 --> 03:23:20.038]  Patriotfood.com.
[03:23:20.038 --> 03:23:25.159]  135 pounds of long-lasting dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[03:23:25.159 --> 03:23:29.880]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[03:23:30.902 --> 03:23:36.786]  And SurvivalistSeeds.com, where I just released my best offer ever.
[03:23:36.786 --> 03:23:41.308]  7,000 heirloom vegetable seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[03:23:41.308 --> 03:23:47.692]  That's over 4 pounds of seed, and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[03:23:47.692 --> 03:23:52.015]  And now, you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[03:23:52.015 --> 03:23:56.357]  PatriotFood.com and SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[03:23:56.357 --> 03:23:58.879]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[03:24:00.657 --> 03:24:06.460]  It's about the time we're going to have all these flu shots coming in and not have the flu shot that maybe is much more important.
[03:24:06.460 --> 03:24:09.181]  The point being, why should they be in charge?
[03:24:09.181 --> 03:24:16.224]  And why should we turn over our health care to these clowns who are trying to distribute, you know, a vaccine?
[03:24:16.224 --> 03:24:20.186]  So either way, it's a point that we shouldn't be doing it.
[03:24:20.186 --> 03:24:25.969]  On top of that, all over the country, schools are injecting children even when their parents say don't do it.
[03:24:25.969 --> 03:24:28.110]  And the schools are saying, oops, it's an accident.
[03:24:28.110 --> 03:24:29.491]  Clearly, that's premeditated.
[03:24:30.452 --> 03:24:37.603]  But shifting gears now, we saw Republican wins in New Jersey and Virginia.
[03:24:37.603 --> 03:24:42.692]  The president's approval rating when he was first elected up in the 80s, now down in the low 40s.
[03:24:43.880 --> 03:24:49.948]  But Republicans still, by and large, have low approval ratings, unless they're like yourself, who's actually a constitutionalist.
[03:24:49.948 --> 03:24:54.153]  We know that in 2010, there's going to be a huge backlash.
[03:24:54.153 --> 03:25:02.604]  Republicans will take back a lot of seats, but if they don't deliver on smaller government and fiscal sound constitutional policies,
[03:25:04.205 --> 03:25:15.673]  Then we're going to have a real crisis on our hands, and if we wait to get politically active until 2011 into 2012, so much of this globalization would have already been expanded and submitted.
[03:25:15.673 --> 03:25:21.037]  I know that this is still off in the future, but LA Times, New York Times, everybody's talking.
[03:25:21.037 --> 03:25:22.038]  I get calls every day.
[03:25:22.879 --> 03:25:26.480]  Saying, when is Ron Paul going to announce for 2012?
[03:25:26.480 --> 03:25:40.204]  Because if you announce early, you can build the coalition, you can get an even more elevated position in the media, you can speak for the people that don't want war, that don't want big government, that don't want banker bailouts.
[03:25:40.204 --> 03:25:49.067]  If you wait to announce until 2011, after your congressional win coming up, but I guess I'm being presumptive.
[03:25:49.067 --> 03:25:51.088]  I mean, you're not even saying you're going to announce in 2011.
[03:25:53.391 --> 03:25:56.694]  No, I'm still thinking a lot about that right now.
[03:25:56.694 --> 03:26:03.681]  It just doesn't seem like the best thing to do, even long term or even on a short term basis.
[03:26:03.681 --> 03:26:12.068]  So I'm not, I'm just, I'm decided about the whole thing, you know, so I'm not about to say that I'm planning to do one thing or another.
[03:26:12.068 --> 03:26:14.010]  Congressman?
[03:26:14.010 --> 03:26:19.135]  I think you make some good points, but I think time is still, it's still a little bit early to start talking about it.
[03:26:21.311 --> 03:26:40.779]  But so much is happening, and if you step up even further, and no one's saying that you haven't done more than anybody else, and start building the coalition now, I'd really, unless there's massive election fraud, I see no way that you could lose the Republican primary.
[03:26:40.779 --> 03:26:48.542]  I mean, how can we allow a rhino, someone who's not really a constitutionalist, like another McCain, another Mitt Romney,
[03:26:49.122 --> 03:26:53.004]  To lead conservatives and libertarians down another rat hole.
[03:26:53.004 --> 03:26:55.765]  I mean, you are the man for the job.
[03:26:55.765 --> 03:26:58.086]  And I don't pretend to understand your political strategy.
[03:26:58.086 --> 03:27:02.208]  I know you're much more intelligent and wise than I am and have more experience.
[03:27:02.208 --> 03:27:06.310]  It just makes perfect sense for at least sometime in the next six to eight months
[03:27:06.990 --> 03:27:10.392]  To announce, but you're saying you're not even sure at this time.
[03:27:10.392 --> 03:27:19.116]  I mean, even if you didn't win, you would have huge fundraising, you'd be able to buy ads, you'd be all over the media, you'll be the only candidate that will inject real issues.
[03:27:19.116 --> 03:27:20.516]  I mean, you're the only man for the job.
[03:27:20.516 --> 03:27:26.179]  I mean, fate and responsibility and destiny says that you are the man for the job.
[03:27:26.819 --> 03:27:33.422]  Alex, you have to realize you're not the average Republican primary voter.
[03:27:33.422 --> 03:27:37.985]  You're a little bit more optimistic about what we might be able to do.
[03:27:37.985 --> 03:27:42.347]  We still have a lot to contend with when you get involved in partisan politics.
[03:27:42.347 --> 03:27:46.529]  You followed that stuff that was going on over in Nevada, how they really handle us.
[03:27:46.909 --> 03:27:49.651]  I think we'll do better if we ever did it again.
[03:27:49.651 --> 03:27:54.314]  But, you know, they just close down the shop if they think you're going to win.
[03:27:54.314 --> 03:27:57.316]  So you have a lot of obstacles to overcome.
[03:27:57.316 --> 03:28:10.084]  But the most important thing, and this is what you've emphasized as well, politics are very important, but also is getting these issues out and talking about the philosophy and why we need it and get the people energized.
[03:28:10.084 --> 03:28:11.165]  And that should be ongoing.
[03:28:11.165 --> 03:28:14.487]  Of course, that's why we keep Campaign for Liberty moving in that direction, because
[03:28:14.847 --> 03:28:18.208]  People have to understand things like the Federal Reserve.
[03:28:18.208 --> 03:28:22.389]  Just think, a couple years ago, not too many people even talked about the Federal Reserve.
[03:28:22.389 --> 03:28:26.570]  And now, they can do national polling on the Federal Reserve to get opinion.
[03:28:26.570 --> 03:28:28.911]  So, in that sense, I think we're making progress.
[03:28:28.911 --> 03:28:29.531]  Exactly.
[03:28:29.531 --> 03:28:36.612]  We've gone from almost no one knowing it's a private cartel to over 75% wanting an audit or for it to be abolished.
[03:28:36.612 --> 03:28:42.254]  It's only a win-win for you to run because it will elevate you, it will have you in the debates, and
[03:28:43.014 --> 03:28:47.577]  I don't see any way you won't run unless you've got medical problems, and you're in great shape.
[03:28:47.577 --> 03:28:55.842]  You look like you're 60, Congressman, and I'm just begging you for millions of other people to kick off the campaign sooner rather than later.
[03:28:55.842 --> 03:29:00.524]  I want to commend you for, you know, helping to get your son to run for the Senate.
[03:29:00.524 --> 03:29:03.446]  People need to get behind him right now, and as you said,
[03:29:04.126 --> 03:29:09.708]  The biggest movement now in the universities isn't the burnout fake left or the burnout fake right.
[03:29:09.708 --> 03:29:16.989]  It is the libertarian, free market, non-collectivist movement that you have helped to grow and energize.
[03:29:16.989 --> 03:29:23.891]  And you are the omnibudsman of liberty, the leading light for freedom worldwide, as even the Czech president has said.
[03:29:23.891 --> 03:29:26.112]  And I just want to salute you and thank you.
[03:29:26.112 --> 03:29:28.032]  In closing, we got 30 seconds.
[03:29:28.032 --> 03:29:30.713]  Are they going to be able to ram through the government takeover of healthcare?
[03:29:31.680 --> 03:29:36.784]  Oh, they're going to get it through the House, but whether the whole thing gets through, I think they'll get part of it, but not the whole thing.
[03:29:36.784 --> 03:29:40.006]  So, uh, we'll wait and see.
[03:29:40.006 --> 03:29:42.929]  And we've adapted in this country to incrementalism.
[03:29:42.929 --> 03:29:44.430]  We never socialize all at once.
[03:29:44.430 --> 03:29:48.533]  We just take it by pieces and think that we've really resisted something.
[03:29:48.533 --> 03:29:51.235]  So unfortunately, it's going to get worse rather than better.
[03:29:51.235 --> 03:29:52.516]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.516 --> 03:29:55.038]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.038 --> 03:29:57.740]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.353 --> 03:30:04.455]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:30:04.455 --> 03:30:07.317]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[03:30:11.659 --> 03:30:13.320]  And it's available right now to you.

[03:32:05.208 --> 03:32:09.734]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:32:09.734 --> 03:32:12.017]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:32:12.017 --> 03:32:13.639]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:32:13.639 --> 03:32:14.661]  There is a solution.
[03:32:14.881 --> 03:32:23.328]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:33:06.079 --> 03:33:22.986]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:22.986 --> 03:33:33.130]  We just got a chance to hear Congressman Ron Paul on with us, though the Capitol switchboard cut him off twice.
[03:33:33.130 --> 03:33:34.951]  I've heard him on other radio shows when that happens.
[03:33:36.792 --> 03:33:40.274]  We must have somebody in that office.
[03:33:40.274 --> 03:33:46.838]  A trained guerrilla or something somewhere in the Capitol building that's running the switchboard.
[03:33:46.838 --> 03:33:58.705]  I could get more conspiratorial and say that they were knocking him off air with us, but that's probably not the case.
[03:33:58.705 --> 03:34:00.746]  Let's go ahead and take some phone calls right now.
[03:34:00.746 --> 03:34:02.007]  We got this economist coming up.
[03:34:02.007 --> 03:34:04.208]  I got a bunch of other news I want to hit as well.
[03:34:04.208 --> 03:34:05.329]  Plus, there's a video clip
[03:34:06.517 --> 03:34:08.478]  Of Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:34:08.478 --> 03:34:16.584]  on television talking about what vaccines are doing to people.
[03:34:16.584 --> 03:34:18.726]  And you've got all these Hollywood stars coming out.
[03:34:18.726 --> 03:34:22.809]  You've got even people like Bill Maher coming out against vaccines.
[03:34:22.809 --> 03:34:27.892]  You've got the founder of Smashing Pumpkins coming out against vaccines.
[03:34:27.892 --> 03:34:30.714]  You've got all these politicians coming out against vaccines.
[03:34:30.714 --> 03:34:33.316]  It shows how the media and the vaccine cult
[03:34:34.013 --> 03:34:43.242]  He's telling us we're kooks, telling us we're liars, saying there's no mercury, saying it can't brain damage you, we're mentally ill, and that's only discrediting them.
[03:34:43.242 --> 03:34:50.409]  And the momentum has clearly not just shifted against the vaccine pushers, but has fully shifted against them.
[03:34:50.409 --> 03:34:51.310]  It's a rout now.
[03:34:52.190 --> 03:34:59.919]  And that's why you have this attempted hype with a non-pandemic flu strain, a flu strain that's very weak compared to the regular seasonal flu.
[03:34:59.919 --> 03:35:03.743]  That's why you have this incredible hype, is an attempt of them to say, you don't want shots?
[03:35:03.743 --> 03:35:10.551]  You want to break the precedent and the mind control that you've got to take the Gardasil shot and all these other vaccines and hepatitis shot?
[03:35:11.517 --> 03:35:12.998]  Oh yeah, we're going to scare you.
[03:35:12.998 --> 03:35:13.998]  We're going to hype it.
[03:35:13.998 --> 03:35:18.120]  We're going to stage artificial scarcity of the vaccine and say we don't have enough of it.
[03:35:18.120 --> 03:35:23.742]  And stage events where we tell people to come down and get the free shot and then we don't have any of it to show people panicking.
[03:35:23.742 --> 03:35:29.404]  We're going to throw everything we've got at you to try to manipulate you and it's not working.
[03:35:29.404 --> 03:35:32.186]  Again, the globalists are in trouble on every front.
[03:35:32.186 --> 03:35:37.808]  75 plus percent of Americans in Gallup polls want it abolished or audited.
[03:35:37.808 --> 03:35:40.329]  Over 90 percent of Americans want to get rid of NAFTA and GATT.
[03:35:41.374 --> 03:35:44.435]  Obama had to lie and say he was going to get rid of it to get elected.
[03:35:44.435 --> 03:35:46.997]  Now he says, I never said that.
[03:35:46.997 --> 03:35:50.158]  We have that in fall of the republic.
[03:35:50.158 --> 03:35:51.319]  A lot of good things are happening.
[03:35:51.319 --> 03:35:55.941]  We're going to go to your phone calls, but let's go ahead and play this Robert Kennedy clip right now.
[03:35:55.941 --> 03:35:56.341]  Here it is.
[03:36:03.700 --> 03:36:07.722]  The generator, what happened was the vaccine schedule was increased.
[03:36:07.722 --> 03:36:24.391]  We went up from receiving about 10 vaccines in our generation to these kids received 24 vaccines and they all had this thimerosal and this mercury and nobody bothered to do an analysis of what the cumulative impact of all that mercury was doing to kids.
[03:36:24.391 --> 03:36:29.154]  As it turns out, we are injecting our children with 400 times the amount of mercury
[03:36:29.574 --> 03:36:32.235]  That FDA or EPA consider safe.
[03:36:32.235 --> 03:36:38.376]  A child on his first day that he's born is injected with a hepatitis B shot.
[03:36:38.376 --> 03:36:44.358]  Under EPA guidelines, he would have to be 275 pounds to safely absorb that shot.
[03:36:44.358 --> 03:36:47.599]  And yet we're just constantly pumping our kids with these vaccines.
[03:36:47.599 --> 03:36:48.599]  Where's the federal government on this?
[03:36:48.599 --> 03:36:49.419]  What happened was that in 1988,
[03:36:54.734 --> 03:36:58.036]  One in every 2,500 American children had autism.
[03:36:58.036 --> 03:37:02.158]  Today, one in every 166 children have autism.
[03:37:02.158 --> 03:37:11.603]  And plus, one in six children have other kinds of learning disorders, other kinds of neurological disorders, speech delay, language disorders, ADD, hyperactivity.
[03:37:11.983 --> 03:37:17.287]  That all seem to be connected, that are all connected, the science shows are all connected to autism.
[03:37:17.287 --> 03:37:26.775]  You know, Bobby, what we've always found, you and I could debate a thousand different issues, whether it's Terry Shiva or the environment, I think would agree on the environment.
[03:37:26.775 --> 03:37:30.919]  But in this case, you've got the federal government coming and saying, well, there's no really, there's no good science.
[03:37:30.919 --> 03:37:34.161]  And of course, in politics, science always gets diluted.
[03:37:34.161 --> 03:37:36.163]  Why hasn't the federal government stepped up?
[03:37:37.342 --> 03:37:57.332]  And worked more, because listen, Bobby, I can't prove it tonight, you can't prove it, but intuitively, you look at the spike, you look at what happened with the Marisol, there is no doubt in my mind, maybe it's two years from now, maybe it's five years from now, maybe it's ten years from now, we're gonna find out that the Marisol causes, in my opinion, autism.
[03:37:57.332 --> 03:37:57.992]  You know what?
[03:37:57.992 --> 03:38:02.414]  The science is out there today, for anybody who bothers to read it, and I have read it,
[03:38:02.874 --> 03:38:10.000]  Actually, on my website this week, robertfkennedyjr.com, I'm publishing an article that goes through all of the science.
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:21.248]  But the science is clear, and what happens is, I read the science at first, and there's literally hundreds and hundreds of studies that connect thimerosal to these disastrous neurological disorders.
[03:38:22.003 --> 03:38:31.129]  Then I went, I talked to the scientists, then I went and I talked to the federal bureaucrats who are defending thimerosal, and I said, what are you relying on?
[03:38:31.129 --> 03:38:39.055]  And I looked at the science they're relying on, and I can tell you, Joe, it is so weak, and you and I have seen, you know, legal practice with junk science, and we know
[03:38:39.515 --> 03:38:42.198]  You know what these phony scientists are who create this stuff.
[03:38:42.198 --> 03:38:43.400]  It happens in big tobacco.
[03:38:43.400 --> 03:38:44.781]  It happens in big oil.
[03:38:44.781 --> 03:38:46.343]  It's happening in global warming.
[03:38:46.343 --> 03:38:50.208]  And now it's happening in a way that's impacting our kids' lives.
[03:38:50.208 --> 03:38:52.190]  This is classic tobacco science.
[03:38:52.190 --> 03:38:53.391]  It is junk science.
[03:38:53.391 --> 03:38:56.815]  And I was looking at these reports and saying, this is the best.
[03:38:56.815 --> 03:38:57.977]  This is what you're relying on.
[03:38:58.377 --> 03:39:02.799]  They know it's fraudulent, and now we have the transcripts... Explain it to me, Bobby, okay?
[03:39:02.799 --> 03:39:05.520]  I mean, explain it to me if that's the case.
[03:39:05.520 --> 03:39:08.541]  You and I both know about politics, obviously.
[03:39:08.541 --> 03:39:10.642]  Politicians like to get re-elected.
[03:39:10.642 --> 03:39:19.745]  Why are they sitting back and letting... If our children are being poisoned, if the science is there, why are they sitting back and letting our children be poisoned?
[03:39:19.745 --> 03:39:27.448]  Because the same regulatory bureaucrats that green-lighted Flint-Marisol originally
[03:39:28.038 --> 03:39:28.658]  Absolutely.
[03:39:28.658 --> 03:39:29.279]  What is Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:39:29.279 --> 03:39:29.619]  talking about?
[03:39:29.619 --> 03:39:31.619]  In 2000, and it's happened several other times, Congressman
[03:39:58.476 --> 03:40:03.037]  Use congressional power to force CDC to release secret documents to them.
[03:40:03.037 --> 03:40:09.699]  And then several congressmen who have brain-damaged children and grandchildren released it.
[03:40:09.699 --> 03:40:10.699]  Even though they weren't supposed to.
[03:40:10.699 --> 03:40:11.599]  This was classified.
[03:40:11.599 --> 03:40:17.220]  And it was the heads of the CDC and the scientists saying, I wouldn't give it to my grandchildren or my kids.
[03:40:17.220 --> 03:40:19.401]  We've brain-damaged millions.
[03:40:19.401 --> 03:40:21.841]  And they say, well, we gotta continue it.
[03:40:21.841 --> 03:40:24.262]  We can't admit
[03:40:25.658 --> 03:40:29.241]  That we know this does this or we'll all go to prison.
[03:40:29.241 --> 03:40:37.907]  Now, they then, when that all came out in 2002, the documents were from 2000, but it took two years for it to come out.
[03:40:37.907 --> 03:40:42.910]  It was even on ABC Nightly News.
[03:40:42.910 --> 03:40:47.693]  Since then, they've lied and said the mercury was taken out.
[03:40:47.693 --> 03:40:48.594]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:40:49.315 --> 03:41:01.968]  Under federal regulations, vaccine makers are supposed to, they don't always do this, make a small amount of non-mercury vaccines.
[03:41:01.968 --> 03:41:03.069]  So that's all that happens.
[03:41:03.069 --> 03:41:05.351]  Yes, are there vaccines without mercury?
[03:41:05.351 --> 03:41:11.717]  Can the news hold up an insert of a vaccine that might be 1% of that type of vaccine that's out there?
[03:41:11.717 --> 03:41:13.179]  It's even less than that in the studies I've seen.
[03:41:13.846 --> 03:41:23.933]  Can you, if you're Andrea Merkel of Germany, or Gordon Brown of England, or Barack Obama and his daughters of USA, can you get one that doesn't have mercury?
[03:41:23.933 --> 03:41:24.953]  Yes.
[03:41:24.953 --> 03:41:26.975]  Can you go to an office and order it?
[03:41:26.975 --> 03:41:31.838]  If you know what to ask for, they can order it, you can come back a week later and be shot up with it.
[03:41:31.838 --> 03:41:33.899]  It's still got the cancer viruses.
[03:41:33.899 --> 03:41:35.520]  It's still got the RNA.
[03:41:35.520 --> 03:41:39.803]  It's still got the aluminum.
[03:41:39.803 --> 03:41:41.184]  It's still all these foreign...
[03:41:42.020 --> 03:41:49.086]  Because it's not just the viruses they're breeding up on caterpillar eggs and baby retinas and dog kidneys or monkey kidneys.
[03:41:49.086 --> 03:41:52.049]  That's the main things they use.
[03:41:52.049 --> 03:42:02.157]  Even most of the vaccine you hear about that's grown on eggs, the original virus for the original sample, the seed stock, is grown in tissue.
[03:42:02.157 --> 03:42:06.381]  And then it's brought over and put in eggs, but it's growing the same thing.
[03:42:07.714 --> 03:42:19.941]  You know, I mean, if I grow squash plants in a greenhouse, and then take those plant seeds out of the greenhouse, and go plant them out in the field, or up against a fence row next year, it's the same squash.
[03:42:19.941 --> 03:42:20.601]  You understand that?
[03:42:20.601 --> 03:42:23.423]  It's the same watermelons.
[03:42:23.423 --> 03:42:24.803]  It's the same blueberries.
[03:42:24.803 --> 03:42:26.104]  It's the same thing.
[03:42:26.104 --> 03:42:27.665]  It's just they're children.
[03:42:27.665 --> 03:42:31.507]  But the exact same genetics.
[03:42:31.507 --> 03:42:32.848]  And they know this!
[03:42:32.848 --> 03:42:34.289]  They know this!
[03:42:34.289 --> 03:42:36.330]  They know this!
[03:42:36.330 --> 03:42:36.430]  And
[03:42:38.843 --> 03:42:41.164]  Everyone is waking up now.
[03:42:41.164 --> 03:42:47.788]  Literally, the vast majority, over 70% in US polls, think it's bad and don't want it.
[03:42:47.788 --> 03:42:57.814]  But the media goes out and interviews 20, 30, 40, 50 people till they find the one person that will say they like it, and they put them on the news.
[03:42:57.814 --> 03:43:03.017]  That's who they put on the news.
[03:43:03.017 --> 03:43:04.038]  That's who they push.
[03:43:07.268 --> 03:43:09.029]  And let me give you the news flash.
[03:43:09.029 --> 03:43:24.780]  Four years ago, the Associated Press told the truth and reported, and the article said we don't know why, that all the major vaccine makers for hepatitis, for flu, for MMR, increased mercury.
[03:43:24.780 --> 03:43:33.986]  They didn't just put it back in, they increased it, not one-fold, not double, not triple, not quadruple,
[03:43:34.713 --> 03:43:38.674]  Five times what the mercury was before.
[03:43:38.674 --> 03:43:49.178]  So before, it was 400 times the safe level of mercury in a average one-year round of shots for a five-year-old.
[03:43:49.178 --> 03:43:50.858]  400 times for their body weight.
[03:43:50.858 --> 03:43:52.779]  It's not quite as bad with an adult.
[03:43:52.779 --> 03:43:56.380]  Just like a big guy can drink more beer and not get drunk.
[03:43:56.380 --> 03:43:59.701]  But for a child, imagine a newborn baby given three shots at birth.
[03:43:59.701 --> 03:44:01.621]  Then six months later, five more shots.
[03:44:01.621 --> 03:44:03.062]  Then when they're 18 months, more shots.
[03:44:04.531 --> 03:44:08.354]  So, I see these fake studies by the media, and they're always deceptive.
[03:44:08.354 --> 03:44:09.895]  Five minutes, you can prove they're a lie.
[03:44:09.895 --> 03:44:16.640]  But when study shows, kids are still getting autism, even though mercury's out of the shots.
[03:44:16.640 --> 03:44:20.403]  But then you go read the study, the study was done with regular vaccines.
[03:44:20.403 --> 03:44:27.408]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, they lie, and they lie, and they lie, and they lie, and they lie, and they lie.
[03:44:28.638 --> 03:44:42.826]  But the good news here is, on the Federal Reserve, or on vaccines, or on the war, or on warrantless wiretapping, or the police state, in every poll, the majority, way over 70%, are against all this.
[03:44:42.826 --> 03:44:43.567]  We're the people.
[03:44:43.567 --> 03:44:47.149]  This is our country.
[03:44:47.149 --> 03:44:48.690]  You can't make us do all this.
[03:44:48.690 --> 03:44:52.392]  So the good news is, the momentum is shifting.
[03:44:52.392 --> 03:44:57.735]  So the establishment is firing everything they've got at us in an attempt to make us capitulate.
[03:44:59.338 --> 03:45:01.199]  And it's not going to work.
[03:45:01.199 --> 03:45:02.519]  The police aren't bad.
[03:45:02.519 --> 03:45:04.280]  Most of the FBI people aren't bad.
[03:45:04.280 --> 03:45:07.421]  Most of them are investigating bank robberies and kidnappings.
[03:45:07.421 --> 03:45:09.422]  It's that higher-up group that are bad.
[03:45:09.422 --> 03:45:10.842]  Most people in banking aren't bad.
[03:45:10.842 --> 03:45:12.203]  They're just giving you a home loan.
[03:45:12.203 --> 03:45:15.364]  It's the big bankers up at the top.
[03:45:15.364 --> 03:45:17.045]  Most people in Congress aren't bad.
[03:45:17.045 --> 03:45:21.646]  They're just corrupt and whores and competitive, so they sell out to be in power.
[03:45:21.646 --> 03:45:25.768]  We have to get the message out about how bad this is if we continue along this line.
[03:45:25.768 --> 03:45:26.128]  Now listen.
[03:45:27.256 --> 03:45:30.679]  I'm going to come back in the next segment, the segment after that, and get through this bank of callers.
[03:45:30.679 --> 03:45:33.381]  Have your questions and comments ready.
[03:45:33.381 --> 03:45:37.204]  Woody, Malcolm, Raul, Eric, Derek, and Hawaiian others.
[03:45:37.204 --> 03:45:44.670]  But I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up, and tomorrow I'm going to fish the clip out and play it.
[03:45:44.670 --> 03:45:47.333]  Ron Paul said they tried to kill gold, it didn't work.
[03:45:47.333 --> 03:45:49.855]  And that's what mainstream news is reporting.
[03:45:49.855 --> 03:45:55.199]  They put hundreds of billions of dollars, in fact I have the Reuters article in my stack.
[03:45:55.199 --> 03:45:56.220]  Ted didn't fill a cent on it.
[03:45:56.906 --> 03:45:58.327]  Hundreds of billions of dollars.
[03:45:58.327 --> 03:45:59.888]  What was it, a $200 billion buy?
[03:45:59.888 --> 03:46:06.412]  They dumped this gold on the market, leveraged its trillions, thinking it would drive it down from above $1,000.
[03:46:06.412 --> 03:46:07.953]  Instead, it shot up to $1,099.
[03:46:07.953 --> 03:46:15.477]  And you heard it from Ron Paul, who's an economist, not just a medical doctor, saying they're going to lose the war on gold.
[03:46:15.477 --> 03:46:17.819]  He believes it's only going to go up.
[03:46:17.819 --> 03:46:18.239]  I don't know.
[03:46:19.344 --> 03:46:28.071]  But all the smart money is on it going up, and at least as the dollar plunges and G20 meets to do it fully, they can't kill gold because it's real.
[03:46:28.071 --> 03:46:34.696]  They may be able to drive it down for a while, doesn't look like that, but it will always beach ball back up like pushing a beach ball to the bottom of the pool.
[03:46:34.696 --> 03:46:40.761]  Ted, take us out to break with what Ron Paul was saying earlier about gold.
[03:46:41.603 --> 03:46:43.424]  And then today's gold offer.
[03:46:43.424 --> 03:46:44.924]  Ted Anderson of Minus Resources.
[03:46:44.924 --> 03:46:47.365]  Well, Alex, they've been playing those tricks.
[03:46:47.365 --> 03:46:50.566]  I mean, going all the way back to the middle 1980s.
[03:46:50.566 --> 03:46:59.909]  And we went to our market peak in 1980, where gold hit $800 an ounce, silver hit $50 an ounce, and then it started backing off down into 1982.
[03:47:01.710 --> 03:47:12.580]  The central banks of the world, unitedly, had tried to suppress the market price of gold and keep it below $400 an ounce for the longest time.
[03:47:12.580 --> 03:47:15.322]  Anybody that wants to have information on that can find it.
[03:47:15.322 --> 03:47:16.804]  It's not like it's hidden.
[03:47:16.804 --> 03:47:20.567]  You can go right over to g-a-t-a, or gata.org.
[03:47:20.567 --> 03:47:21.468]  That's g-a-t-a.org.
[03:47:24.370 --> 03:47:25.071]  We're good to go.
[03:47:37.282 --> 03:47:40.383]  And I'm able to buy in those dips.
[03:47:40.383 --> 03:47:44.465]  Usually, most of the time, that is occurring here in the New York market.
[03:47:44.465 --> 03:47:56.049]  And the reason why it's happening is because the Federal Reserve System has such a heavy interest in seeing the United States dollar stay strong and gold stay suppressed.
[03:47:56.049 --> 03:47:59.771]  See, it's the game of the fiat currency makers
[03:48:00.231 --> 03:48:06.913]  Is to try to keep you out of anything that it stands in the way of their profit-making machine.
[03:48:06.913 --> 03:48:22.459]  And I have to say that it is one insidious profit-making machine because they have legal tender laws pointing at them that allows them to create the currency of the nation and they lend it to us and we have to service interest on that debt.
[03:48:23.999 --> 03:48:25.862]  Now you have to realize what that means.
[03:48:25.862 --> 03:48:32.370]  I mean, what has our country been doing here for the last, at least 30 years, is deficit spending.
[03:48:32.370 --> 03:48:37.277]  So, where does deficit spending, who does it help and who does it hurt?
[03:48:38.038 --> 03:48:57.940]  Well, the United States people have to go into debt to get the currency, and you can see that the United States government has done nothing but deficit spending and put the taxpayers on the hook for even more and more and more of their hard-earned wages, and that money eventually filters right back up to this elite banking system.
[03:48:59.329 --> 03:49:01.191]  And they have control of the world.
[03:49:01.191 --> 03:49:07.496]  I mean, when Bill Clinton was in office, he would be telling you that this is going to happen in the economy and that and so on and so forth.
[03:49:07.496 --> 03:49:11.140]  It was one of the few surpluses that we ever ran.
[03:49:11.140 --> 03:49:15.744]  But back then, the United States people were going so far into debt that the government didn't have to.
[03:49:16.624 --> 03:49:30.294]  You know, there just has never been a time since 1913 that the United States of America has been able to enjoy prosperity without having the equivalent increase in the debt.
[03:49:30.294 --> 03:49:36.119]  And so it just puts people on the hook, you know, to such an extreme, it's ridiculous.
[03:49:36.119 --> 03:49:43.284]  And we have the very parasites that have engineered this, not getting in trouble, but getting even more power now.
[03:49:44.345 --> 03:49:46.226]  They're getting the bailout money, Alex.
[03:49:46.226 --> 03:49:50.009]  We're having to even go further into this to give them the bailout money.
[03:49:50.009 --> 03:49:51.250]  Which isn't bailout money.
[03:49:51.250 --> 03:49:55.914]  They're using that to not loan and buy up real assets and they're bragging about it.
[03:49:55.914 --> 03:50:00.999]  It's come out in McClatchy newspapers that Goldman Sachs secretly bet on the U.S.
[03:50:00.999 --> 03:50:03.421]  housing crash to bring down their competitors.
[03:50:03.421 --> 03:50:04.822]  I mean, this is a criminal group.
[03:50:04.822 --> 03:50:10.046]  Ted, tell folks that you still have gold that you bought in the 920 market as it's up
[03:50:13.309 --> 03:50:15.051]  Let me say it this way, Alex.
[03:50:15.051 --> 03:50:17.533]  Hold on just a second.
[03:50:17.533 --> 03:50:20.716]  I was getting the numbers wrong there because I end up talking so fast.
[03:50:20.716 --> 03:50:22.357]  I need to get that number right.
[03:50:22.357 --> 03:50:27.322]  You still have gold at the $1,020 level of when you bought into the market with it now up at $1,090.
[03:50:27.322 --> 03:50:30.404]  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[03:50:30.404 --> 03:50:31.986]  That's the way to say it truthfully.
[03:50:32.646 --> 03:50:35.108]  I have Franks currently right now at $238.
[03:50:35.108 --> 03:50:37.229]  I have British Sovereigns at $293.
[03:50:37.229 --> 03:50:41.051]  I have Walking Liberty Halves right now at $8.69.
[03:50:41.051 --> 03:50:45.914]  And I'm also carrying the Lakota Nation Rounds at $22.30.
[03:50:45.914 --> 03:50:48.636]  Alright, stay there Ted.
[03:50:48.636 --> 03:50:52.198]  Because I was just thinking back to two weeks ago when it was at nine something again.
[03:50:53.381 --> 03:50:58.105]  1,020 is now a super low that Ted bought it, and it's up at 1,090.
[03:50:58.105 --> 03:51:02.368]  I mean, just getting my mind wrapped around... Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[03:51:02.368 --> 03:51:06.010]  Alex and I have talked about food security for your family for years.
[03:51:06.010 --> 03:51:14.436]  Now we're into the holiday season, the happy time of year when friends and family come together and food is always the expression of our shared love and caring.
[03:51:14.436 --> 03:51:15.877]  Here's an exciting announcement.
[03:51:15.877 --> 03:51:17.198]  From now until December 15th,
[03:51:17.458 --> 03:51:17.818]  I think so.
[03:51:34.155 --> 03:51:40.841]  In addition to the overall 10% savings, the Holiday Special is made up of the new prepared meals that taste great.
[03:51:40.841 --> 03:51:46.206]  It also comes with a free 7-day responder for you to give to someone less fortunate or as a gift.
[03:51:46.206 --> 03:51:47.927]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:51:47.927 --> 03:51:48.448]  That's 800-409-5633.
[03:51:48.448 --> 03:51:51.931]  We here at eFoodsDirect wish you peace, security and plenty this holiday season.
[03:52:02.148 --> 03:52:06.175]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:06.175 --> 03:52:09.421]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:09.421 --> 03:52:10.844]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:11.542 --> 03:52:14.203]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:14.203 --> 03:52:20.607]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:20.607 --> 03:52:26.149]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.149 --> 03:52:28.971]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:52:28.971 --> 03:52:35.774]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:35.894 --> 03:52:38.256]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:38.256 --> 03:52:39.837]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:39.837 --> 03:52:42.298]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:42.298 --> 03:52:44.419]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:44.419 --> 03:52:49.563]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:49.563 --> 03:52:54.586]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:52:54.586 --> 03:52:58.688]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:00.885 --> 03:53:02.806]  We all need to prepare ourselves.
[03:53:02.806 --> 03:53:07.970]  You might have the food, water, gold, and silver, but ask yourself, are you truly prepared?
[03:53:07.970 --> 03:53:10.811]  That's why you need to visit MaineMilitary.com.
[03:53:10.811 --> 03:53:13.333]  MaineMilitary.com carries everything you need.

[03:53:27.000 --> 03:53:29.361]  Are your local stores sold out of ammunition?

[03:53:45.828 --> 03:53:49.151]  That's Maine, like the state, Military.com.
[03:53:49.151 --> 03:53:49.851]  Or call them at 1-877-608-0179.
[03:53:49.851 --> 03:53:50.091]  That's 1-877-608-0179.
[03:54:15.075 --> 03:54:20.201]  You heard Ron Paul earlier say that he believes gold's only going to continue to explode upward.
[03:54:20.201 --> 03:54:24.746]  The IMF sells billions and billions in gold, trying to drive it down like they've done the last few years.
[03:54:24.746 --> 03:54:27.088]  It explodes.
[03:54:27.088 --> 03:54:28.430]  And I believe Ron Paul's right.
[03:54:28.430 --> 03:54:29.331]  They are failing.
[03:54:29.331 --> 03:54:32.735]  Well, they admit they're failing to drive it down.
[03:54:33.873 --> 03:54:36.254]  Ted, again, tell people the offer you've got.
[03:54:36.254 --> 03:54:39.515]  So you've almost run out of gold you bought at the $1,020 level.
[03:54:39.515 --> 03:54:41.915]  That sounds high, but it's actually low.
[03:54:41.915 --> 03:54:47.937]  And it's up at $1,090 right now, pushed up to $1,099 yesterday.
[03:54:47.937 --> 03:54:54.199]  Fire out the number for folks that want to call and talk to the brokers and order some silver and gold coins at great prices.
[03:54:54.199 --> 03:54:54.999]  Yeah, the number is 1-800-686-2237.
[03:54:59.266 --> 03:55:05.289]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237, and Ron Paul's exactly right.
[03:55:05.289 --> 03:55:08.470]  They create these little opportunities for me to buy gold low.
[03:55:08.470 --> 03:55:15.133]  They sell their gold, they try to suppress it, they try to keep people away from gold, but they are losing in that battle.
[03:55:15.133 --> 03:55:21.216]  And the reason is because the world wants to get away from the dollar, so every time they start selling, the rest of the world starts buying.
[03:55:21.937 --> 03:55:25.181]  Because they want to get rid of their dollars and grab up the gold.
[03:55:25.181 --> 03:55:27.564]  This has always worked in the past for them.
[03:55:27.564 --> 03:55:28.825]  It's not working now.
[03:55:28.825 --> 03:55:32.189]  Folks, the globalists are obsessed with gold and silver.
[03:55:32.189 --> 03:55:33.251]  You need to get involved.
[03:55:33.251 --> 03:55:33.291]  800-686-2237.
[03:55:37.215 --> 03:55:37.775]  800-686-2237.
[03:55:37.775 --> 03:55:44.539]  I believe people are insane if they don't take advantage of this offer.
[03:55:44.539 --> 03:55:45.419]  Is anything perfect?
[03:55:45.419 --> 03:55:52.162]  No, but it's as close as a silver bullet as you're gonna get is silver and gold.
[03:55:52.162 --> 03:55:53.202]  800-686-2237.
[03:55:53.202 --> 03:55:53.903]  One more time.
[03:55:53.903 --> 03:55:54.223]  800-686-2237.
[03:55:54.223 --> 03:56:00.005]  And the brokers can hold those deals until midnight again, Ted?
[03:56:00.005 --> 03:56:01.006]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:56:01.006 --> 03:56:05.528]  I'm real happy that the market's allowing me to do that, so you bet we'll hold it right through midnight.
[03:56:06.536 --> 03:56:09.017]  Thank you, Ted Anderson.
[03:56:09.017 --> 03:56:12.217]  Alright, let's go ahead now and go to Woody in Illinois.
[03:56:12.217 --> 03:56:13.258]  Woody, thanks for holding.
[03:56:13.258 --> 03:56:13.618]  Go ahead.
[03:56:13.618 --> 03:56:15.858]  Hey Alex, how you doing today?
[03:56:15.858 --> 03:56:29.881]  I just wanted to compliment you on your program to enlighten the general public on the plans of the global elitist to exterminate our population.
[03:56:29.881 --> 03:56:32.982]  I've been doing my own research and I'd like everybody to look up HR 8791.
[03:56:37.069 --> 03:56:39.350]  It's a house appropriations bill.
[03:56:39.350 --> 03:56:40.191]  It's on YouTube.
[03:56:40.191 --> 03:56:40.811]  You can pull it up.
[03:56:40.811 --> 03:56:43.432]  You can see the representative from Pennsylvania talk about it.
[03:56:43.432 --> 03:56:48.815]  And just about every other word out of his mouth as he's reading this bill is the word classified.
[03:56:48.815 --> 03:56:53.057]  And it's Homeland Security Funding Appropriations Bill.
[03:56:53.057 --> 03:56:56.379]  And it's designed in the event of some type of attack.
[03:56:56.379 --> 03:56:57.880]  Alright, let me stop you.
[03:56:57.880 --> 03:56:58.540]  Let me stop you.
[03:56:59.321 --> 03:57:06.898]  There are real executive orders, Presidential Decision Directive 51, John Warner Defense Authorization Act, but what The Onion did is...
[03:57:07.856 --> 03:57:16.879]  They, right after that broke last year, and real congressmen went to the floor and said basically what the Onion video says.
[03:57:16.879 --> 03:57:19.060]  The Onion newspaper puts out fake news.
[03:57:19.060 --> 03:57:23.841]  They almost copied it word for word and put the Onion on it to discredit it.
[03:57:23.841 --> 03:57:25.442]  So that's not real.
[03:57:25.442 --> 03:57:28.923]  But, in the Obama deception, we have the real clips.
[03:57:29.683 --> 03:57:29.923]  Yes, I do.
[03:57:29.923 --> 03:57:29.983]  Yes.
[03:57:55.228 --> 03:58:16.134]  Here we have John Warner Defense Authorization Act, PDD 51 for martial law, the president to become a dictator, all these real congressmen, Senator Inhofe, all these real people, Congressman Domenici coming out about it, talking about real things.
[03:58:16.134 --> 03:58:19.035]  And then all anyone talks about is the onion with it's fake.
[03:58:20.814 --> 03:58:22.596]  And that's what COINTELPRO does.
[03:58:22.596 --> 03:58:26.859]  I'm not saying the onions COINTELPRO, but they might as well get a paycheck from the government.
[03:58:26.859 --> 03:58:36.386]  Because now, anytime you talk about martial law legislation that's public, no one will look at it, they'll pull the onion up, throw it right in your face.
[03:58:36.386 --> 03:58:42.411]  That's how Black Ops works.

[03:58:50.475 --> 03:58:59.620]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:58:59.620 --> 03:59:03.002]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:59:03.002 --> 03:59:08.865]  Instead, use Vitamin C-D and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife, for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[03:59:08.865 --> 03:59:13.648]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:59:13.648 --> 03:59:15.989]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:59:16.169 --> 03:59:16.589]  Thank you.
