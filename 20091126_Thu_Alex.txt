[00:00.000 --> 00:10.860]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:10.860 --> 00:18.420]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.420 --> 00:23.980]  Texas Alex Jones well we're into our number two
[00:23.980 --> 00:27.820]  simulcasting the syndicated radio transmission at prisonplanet.tv and
[00:27.820 --> 00:34.120]  living color joining us from Minnesota he's about to travel down to Mexico do
[00:34.120 --> 00:40.120]  some surfing is former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura of course a star of
[00:40.120 --> 00:46.880]  films like The Running Man Predator and many other films he's hosted a MSNBC
[00:46.880 --> 00:52.720]  national television show he's hosted NFL football there's not much this guy
[00:52.720 --> 00:56.800]  hadn't done and now he's got a huge show they're saying it's gonna be their big
[00:56.800 --> 01:00.680]  push in the winter their big number one promoted show and I'm seeing that now in
[01:00.680 --> 01:06.460]  the media that's conspiracy theory created by Jesse Ventura I'm a consultant
[01:06.460 --> 01:10.500]  on it I'm in some of the episodes I'm very honored to be involved in it and to
[01:10.500 --> 01:14.460]  give you the inside scoop he starts the media blitz tomorrow to give you the
[01:14.460 --> 01:18.520]  inside scoop is Jesse Ventura with us for the next hour we may twist his arm a
[01:18.520 --> 01:22.720]  little bit in the next hour to take some phone calls but we'll see governor it is
[01:22.720 --> 01:29.680]  good to have you here with us are you gonna I guess I guess I should call
[01:29.680 --> 01:36.720]  you a huggy bear and I'll explain that for a moment now Alex has been good
[01:36.720 --> 01:41.840]  enough he he appears in a couple of the episodes of conspiracy theory that we
[01:41.840 --> 01:47.600]  did and so because he's the only really reoccurring character we've ever had in
[01:47.600 --> 01:52.920]  the first initial bite we went back to the old Starsky and Hutch show and y'all
[01:52.920 --> 01:56.480]  remember huggy bear don't you the guy that always brought the information to
[01:56.480 --> 02:02.960]  Starsky and Hutch yes that's you now Alex you're so you're our huggy bear well
[02:02.960 --> 02:07.960]  I'm honored to be your huggy bear you've not been able to talk about the show
[02:07.960 --> 02:12.680]  till now they've unleashed you you barely talked about it on Larry King live
[02:12.680 --> 02:17.320]  last week but now you've been given the green light to to give people a
[02:17.320 --> 02:24.680]  foretaste or a idea of what's going to be in the seven episodes and so we're
[02:24.680 --> 02:28.360]  all ears governor I mean tell us about some of the episodes well first of all
[02:28.360 --> 02:32.800]  when I went on Larry it was because you know it was election night and Larry
[02:32.800 --> 02:39.120]  truly wanted my opinion on the latest off-year elections which I'll do this
[02:39.120 --> 02:43.960]  right now to me why do they even have off-year elections it's hard enough to
[02:43.960 --> 02:49.240]  get people out there to vote I have them all on here they do that so that they
[02:49.240 --> 02:54.160]  get a small voter turnout because it's easier to control small numbers and so
[02:54.160 --> 02:58.960]  that's why that happens pretty much but that being said that's why it was on
[02:58.960 --> 03:03.240]  Larry was mainly for the election stuff not so much a promotion of the show
[03:03.240 --> 03:08.280]  because I'll be going back on Larry later on the end of the month right when
[03:08.280 --> 03:11.760]  it gets to the debut date which of course is December the second on the
[03:11.760 --> 03:18.600]  2 channel at 10 Eastern 9 central and so I'll be going back on Larry then and at
[03:18.600 --> 03:23.160]  that point in time it'll be a promo for the show so I just did Larry where they
[03:23.160 --> 03:28.920]  promoted a little bit but it was mostly on voting but governor hold on you're
[03:28.920 --> 03:32.040]  about to go to break and I want I don't want to stop you I want you to have free
[03:32.040 --> 03:35.840]  flow and go over as much as you can tell us about the episodes because I've
[03:35.840 --> 03:40.240]  consulted some but I still only have a few pieces of the overall puzzle and I
[03:40.240 --> 03:44.080]  know that you've stated that you believe this is fair and from our perspective
[03:44.080 --> 03:48.800]  probably the first television show ever that's actually from people who questions
[03:48.800 --> 03:52.880]  perspective that doesn't mean that you or I or anybody buys all of what's being
[03:52.880 --> 03:56.160]  said out there so I want to talk about that and come back in just a minute but
[03:56.160 --> 04:01.200]  in the one minute we've got what is your take on Republicans sweeping all over
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.680]  the country and Obama's plunging approval rating well I don't think it's so
[04:05.680 --> 04:11.280]  much Republican sweeping yeah as you know they lost that that congressional
[04:11.280 --> 04:14.800]  race up in that heavily Republican district in New York that haven't gone
[04:14.800 --> 04:18.360]  Democrat yeah but the Democrats through that they through that I mean they had
[04:18.360 --> 04:23.160]  their well maybe so well to me that the elections are truly irrelevant and as far
[04:23.160 --> 04:29.320]  as Obama's ratings falling that's a natural occurrence you know I don't want
[04:29.320 --> 04:32.920]  to throw water on the fire or anything for those people though you know for
[04:32.920 --> 04:39.240]  whatever reason but I at one time at 72 percent approval ratings will certainly
[04:39.240 --> 04:44.840]  by the time you get out of office might actually get below 50 later no you're
[04:44.840 --> 04:50.680]  right when you have to make hard decisions when you make those hard
[04:50.680 --> 04:55.240]  decisions some people aren't gonna like it then a lot of people are wanting to
[04:55.240 --> 04:59.640]  shoot people Jesse we got a break we got a break stay right there have you ever
[04:59.640 --> 05:03.840]  wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power if so this is going to

[05:10.840 --> 05:14.280]  emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you
[05:14.280 --> 05:18.880]  need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no
[05:18.880 --> 05:22.920]  fumes and produces electricity for free it's like having an electric power plant

[08:17.720 --> 08:24.880]  live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well surfs up ladies and gentlemen and here
[08:24.880 --> 08:31.240]  comes Jesse Ventura into the info war coming up in early December the launch
[08:31.240 --> 08:37.680]  of his long-awaited television show conspiracy theory on true TV here to
[08:37.680 --> 08:42.320]  tell us dates and times and inside the tales first on this radio show when
[08:42.320 --> 08:46.520]  Jesse called me back Friday evening and said okay I'll do your show first I was
[08:46.520 --> 08:50.960]  extremely honored and so governor I really do appreciate you coming here
[08:50.960 --> 08:55.400]  first to talk about it I know the media blitz starts later today and tomorrow
[08:55.400 --> 08:59.520]  but we but we were finishing up when you got cut off by that break you were
[08:59.520 --> 09:03.040]  talking about you're not surprised Obama's approval ratings dropped yours
[09:03.040 --> 09:07.880]  went from the mid 70s to the high 40s and but but but that was four years
[09:07.880 --> 09:13.840]  later my issue yeah that's true Alex but it's gonna happen you know that the
[09:13.840 --> 09:18.600]  honeymoon wears off the heart decisions have to be made people many times
[09:18.600 --> 09:23.720]  disagree with those tough decisions and your approval rating starts to fall the
[09:23.720 --> 09:28.520]  positive for me the way I always looked at it was like this I was in a three-way
[09:28.520 --> 09:36.400]  race not a two-way race I won with only 37% so even if my approval saved fell
[09:36.400 --> 09:42.560]  all the way to 45 that was still eight points higher than what I won with sure
[09:42.560 --> 09:51.320]  and George W. Bush's went from 92 to 39 but again that took seven he had been
[09:51.320 --> 09:56.080]  lower than 39 yeah some approval ratings had him at 25 I mean there's so many
[09:56.080 --> 10:01.720]  polls Jesse would sell at the hardcore Republicans I in the end I can't see him
[10:01.720 --> 10:07.080]  even getting over 30% approval rate well I know Congress just a political gift
[10:07.080 --> 10:12.020]  from his party exactly I know that the overall Congress both parties had an
[10:12.020 --> 10:16.440]  11% when he left office and it's now going back down that direction again my
[10:16.440 --> 10:20.400]  point is Obama's approval rating has broken records according to the major
[10:20.400 --> 10:24.880]  pollsters for falling the fastest in the first year of a new administration and
[10:24.880 --> 10:31.360]  and now he's losing his base he the CBS News last night reported he is putting
[10:31.360 --> 10:36.200]  in 40,000 more troops in Afghanistan and Jesse I know you've researched this and
[10:36.200 --> 10:39.080]  are well read on this subject let's talk about this right now and then get into
[10:39.080 --> 10:45.080]  the show there's 12 times the opium 12 times coming out of Afghanistan of what
[10:45.080 --> 10:49.560]  was coming out eight years ago and even the BBC admits our troops are guarding
[10:49.560 --> 10:54.560]  the opium so quote the Taliban doesn't get it no that's so the banks can
[10:54.560 --> 10:58.880]  launder 500 billion in smack every year Governor Ventura your take on this war
[10:58.880 --> 11:11.120]  I well to me welcome welcome to another Vietnam it's that simple it's going to
[11:11.120 --> 11:16.600]  accomplish nothing guys are gonna die over there on a constant basis as they
[11:16.600 --> 11:22.080]  have in Iraq and you know welcome to another Vietnam when they when this is
[11:22.080 --> 11:28.920]  all over and done with I will I I do it right now Alex I sit back and go how is
[11:28.920 --> 11:35.080]  this how is Jesse Ventura benefiting from these two wars and I can't think of
[11:35.080 --> 11:40.280]  a thing and yet we've got people out there protesting whether people should
[11:40.280 --> 11:45.720]  be able to go see a doctor or not if we wouldn't have got these two wars we
[11:45.720 --> 11:52.800]  have plenty of money for healthcare wouldn't we absolutely and and my point
[11:52.800 --> 12:01.000]  is why you know the most destructive thing mankind can do and when he
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.240]  engages in them it has no benefit it's like Herman Goring said the best thing
[12:07.240 --> 12:12.280]  a farmer can get out of a war is to be able to come back on the same farm you
[12:12.280 --> 12:18.280]  left before the war started that's the best outcome the very best there will
[12:18.280 --> 12:25.240]  be nothing more than that and when is this country gonna wake up you know I
[12:25.240 --> 12:30.880]  sit back and I'm I can't say I'm speechless because I'm I'm bitching
[12:30.880 --> 12:35.720]  about it right now but I cannot believe that people aren't protesting these
[12:35.720 --> 12:42.360]  wars and now we're sending more troops in to accomplish what the Russians couldn't
[12:42.360 --> 12:49.880]  win there and we're so stupid and our ego is so powerful that we think we can
[12:49.880 --> 12:55.520]  well they can't win the state of objective to bring democracy and freedom
[12:55.520 --> 13:00.560]  to Afghanistan but of the objective is to destabilize the region and have bases
[13:00.560 --> 13:04.880]  to menace Iran and China and at the state of objective you know the real
[13:04.880 --> 13:09.440]  objective is to launder drug proceeds then it's mission accomplished they just
[13:09.440 --> 13:13.960]  need to sit there if that's indeed what it is Alex then you will be you're
[13:13.960 --> 13:17.000]  absolutely correct it's mission accomplished if that's what they're
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.600]  accomplishing out of this I can't prove that that's what they aren't doing at
[13:21.600 --> 13:27.280]  this time but certainly from a base perspective of Jesse Ventura American
[13:27.280 --> 13:32.720]  citizen I don't understand how I benefit by these wars one bit or any of the
[13:32.720 --> 13:36.640]  rest of us benefit by them one bit okay here's an example then we'll get into the
[13:36.640 --> 13:40.960]  TV show I know you've been busy with you know producing the television show and
[13:40.960 --> 13:44.280]  flying all over the country and we'll talk about that you were really working
[13:44.280 --> 13:47.880]  hard on this a lot of work a lot of time a lot of energy a lot of money but I
[13:47.880 --> 13:54.640]  wanted but at the same time it came out two weeks ago New York Times that
[13:54.640 --> 14:00.280]  Muhammad Karzai's brother is the head opium king pen in Afghanistan and that
[14:00.280 --> 14:06.120]  he is a CIA operative on CIA payroll and that basically so is Muhammad Karzai
[14:06.120 --> 14:11.480]  and that our troops are guarding his poppy fields and I was driving down the
[14:11.480 --> 14:14.520]  road a few months ago and heard BBC report the same thing before the New
[14:14.520 --> 14:21.480]  York Times did and I already knew that but to hear them report that oh we guard
[14:21.480 --> 14:25.320]  the opium because if we don't guard it another Taliban group will get it and
[14:25.320 --> 14:28.400]  they'll get too much power that's what they're telling the troops we guard the
[14:28.400 --> 14:33.640]  opium to win the war you know the CIA got caught with opium in South
[14:33.640 --> 14:37.880]  East Asia and Vietnam we're now in Columbia putting bases in anywhere
[14:37.880 --> 14:43.120]  there's drugs our troops are there to eradicate the other guys drugs and
[14:43.120 --> 14:48.560]  protect the drug kingpins that launder their money through you through US and
[14:48.560 --> 14:53.920]  European banks and add to that the fact that that's how the CIA gets their
[14:53.920 --> 14:58.840]  revenue so that they can then do operations that they can keep away from
[14:58.840 --> 15:04.200]  Congress because if they have to do operations that require them to get
[15:04.200 --> 15:09.520]  money from our tax money then they have to be forward enough to let Congress
[15:09.520 --> 15:14.680]  know what they're doing with the money but if they're getting money via illegal
[15:14.680 --> 15:19.960]  drugs and making all sorts of money out of that end of the world they then
[15:19.960 --> 15:23.800]  don't have to declare any of that to Congress and that's when they can do
[15:23.800 --> 15:28.360]  these dirty jobs that the American public will never know about Governor
[15:28.360 --> 15:32.840]  Jesse Ventura that is the nail on the head absolutely I hadn't even thought
[15:32.840 --> 15:37.800]  to make that point all those tens of billions in unaccountable money that
[15:37.800 --> 15:41.120]  these private interest on their operations so that they don't have to be
[15:41.120 --> 15:47.600]  accountable to the Congress absolutely in fact in 96 that came out on C-span
[15:47.600 --> 15:54.080]  with the CIA Inspector General testifying that the CIA brought in the crack
[15:54.080 --> 15:57.400]  cocaine epidemic
[15:58.400 --> 16:03.200]  well that I don't know that you know about that Alex I don't I can only
[16:03.200 --> 16:09.120]  speak to what I know about and you know you know you better run on it than I
[16:09.120 --> 16:13.400]  have well no I mean I mean you know as much or more than I do you just brought
[16:13.400 --> 16:16.400]  up the key point that they're funding their black operations with this oh
[16:16.400 --> 16:21.480]  yeah no I I felt that know that for a long long time but that's that's the
[16:21.480 --> 16:24.960]  simple way to do it that's how you keep it out of the public eye that's how
[16:24.960 --> 16:29.280]  that's how you can get money to do political assassinations like in the
[16:29.280 --> 16:34.080]  old days when they used to get to kill Castro okay I'm gonna shut up if they
[16:34.080 --> 16:39.560]  do that if they get money from Congress then they have to submit reports and it
[16:39.560 --> 16:43.840]  has to be far more about board but if they get the money from somewhere else
[16:43.840 --> 16:48.520]  which can be dirty drug money well then they can spend it on any operations they
[16:48.520 --> 16:52.040]  want to do and they don't have to be accountable to the American public or
[16:52.040 --> 16:55.840]  the Congress for it absolutely governor we've got you here to talk about the
[16:55.840 --> 16:59.480]  TV show but I'm gonna stop getting off in other issues I apologize but it's
[16:59.480 --> 17:02.800]  always interesting to hear your your truthful perspective because you're
[17:02.800 --> 17:08.400]  absolutely right on those issues where to start with the TV show I mean I've
[17:08.400 --> 17:12.680]  seen the one promo clip where you went out to harp and they and they threatened
[17:12.680 --> 17:16.880]  to arrest you and then suddenly the equipment went dead let's go through
[17:16.880 --> 17:21.560]  the seven episodes and give people an idea what's coming up well hopefully I
[17:21.560 --> 17:26.600]  can remember them all I'll tell you we got it was so hectic shooting them that
[17:26.600 --> 17:32.800]  sometimes I had to jump from one episode to another episode and that plays
[17:32.800 --> 17:36.680]  games with your mind because you're focused in on one thing and then you
[17:36.680 --> 17:40.240]  know the next half a day you might be doing something for a completely
[17:40.240 --> 17:44.160]  different let me ask this what's your favorite show what's your favorite episode
[17:44.160 --> 17:51.040]  um I would say my favorite one would be 9-11 because I think 9-11 was the
[17:51.040 --> 17:57.160]  original one that I took to the two TV people to sell them on the show and so
[17:57.160 --> 18:02.280]  it was personal to me because of my investigation of it so far so I would
[18:02.280 --> 18:07.040]  have to say that that one is the most satisfying although they all are pretty
[18:07.040 --> 18:11.120]  much and I'll put it to you this way the way that I'm going to explain it is
[18:11.120 --> 18:16.080]  quite simple Alex people can choose to believe the conspiracies are not all
[18:16.080 --> 18:20.960]  seven of these and they're all fairly modern day the one thing to channel
[18:20.960 --> 18:25.080]  wanted to do we don't go back to Kennedy we don't go back they wanted to keep
[18:25.080 --> 18:31.800]  this first series within the last decade pretty much and you can choose to
[18:31.800 --> 18:35.360]  believe them or you can choose not to believe them but I'll guarantee you this
[18:35.360 --> 18:38.600]  if you watch the show you're going to get scared
[18:38.600 --> 18:44.640]  oh even if even if they're not true there is still the element that they may
[18:44.640 --> 18:51.320]  be they might be and they could be and maybe they are and that should be enough
[18:51.320 --> 18:55.920]  to wake people up and scare them this is the first show that I've ever done in
[18:55.920 --> 19:01.880]  my career where I got scared and I don't get scared easy I remember a few
[19:01.880 --> 19:06.640]  weeks ago I ran into we were checking at the hotel and you walked up and you were
[19:06.640 --> 19:10.800]  shaking your head you said Alex you were there with your son Tyrell is working
[19:10.800 --> 19:14.680]  on the show as well doing a great job you walked up and you said Alex when I
[19:14.680 --> 19:17.880]  go to bed at night my head spinning with all this information this stuff is
[19:17.880 --> 19:24.160]  scary oh yeah no we went into some places that you know you think is only
[19:24.160 --> 19:31.120]  fantasy land but it could very well be reality land and it's stuff that people
[19:31.120 --> 19:35.080]  don't even think about don't deal with in their daily lives you know that's one
[19:35.080 --> 19:38.840]  of the main things is people people out there have to earn a living they have to
[19:38.840 --> 19:42.680]  make a living for their family so they haven't got time to go delving into the
[19:42.680 --> 19:47.600]  underhanded stuff that government might be doing and it's interesting Alex that
[19:47.600 --> 19:51.880]  we started to show with the concept that we were going to show both sides of the
[19:51.880 --> 19:56.320]  conspiracy and then a while the viewer to make a choice at the end of which one
[19:56.320 --> 20:00.600]  he or she would choose to believe hold it there got a break up from the company

[24:18.160 --> 24:22.280]  all right going back to Governor Jesse Ventura this is a short segment long
[24:22.280 --> 24:25.440]  segment coming up it'll be with us a little bit into the next hour we're
[24:25.440 --> 24:34.320]  hoping the phones up specifically only for governor Jesse Ventura at 1-800-259-9231
[24:34.320 --> 24:37.840]  quick question or comment for the governor coming up okay you got cut off
[24:37.840 --> 24:42.160]  again by the satellite I'm making this go to break start over start over governor
[24:42.160 --> 24:47.680]  with the point that you were making about the TV show well initially Alex we
[24:47.680 --> 24:51.640]  started off to do the show with the concept that both sides of the
[24:51.640 --> 24:55.520]  conspiracy would be told if there were two sides many times there may be
[24:55.520 --> 25:00.760]  multiple sides but the two major sides and then we'd let the viewer decide
[25:00.760 --> 25:04.200]  well then the show had to go through a metamorphosis if you will or an
[25:04.200 --> 25:09.240]  evolution whatever you want to call it because when one side does not cooperate
[25:09.240 --> 25:14.880]  one bit it is pretty hard to tell their story and that was the case of the
[25:14.880 --> 25:19.600]  United States government I did an interview the other day a print
[25:19.600 --> 25:23.920]  interview and then the person asked me and I said well you know the government
[25:23.920 --> 25:28.400]  hasn't cooperated at all and they said this includes when Obama's taken over I
[25:28.400 --> 25:32.560]  said there's been no difference I said it hasn't made one bit of difference
[25:32.560 --> 25:36.800]  because we started the show George Bush was still the president and the show's
[25:36.800 --> 25:40.040]  been in the looks and I've been working on it for a year now basically or
[25:40.040 --> 25:48.320]  better and the government cooperated nothing zero silk we could not even get
[25:48.320 --> 25:52.960]  a spokesperson out for the government well we do get a few former government
[25:52.960 --> 25:57.200]  people who are now no longer working for the government who had courage enough
[25:57.200 --> 26:01.600]  to come out and talk to us and offer their opinions but no one under the
[26:01.600 --> 26:05.600]  government would cooperate with the show at all so then the show became
[26:05.600 --> 26:11.200]  simply more of the other side of the conspiracy being told and now the viewer
[26:11.200 --> 26:15.200]  gets to see an alternative to what the government has pumped out in many
[26:15.200 --> 26:19.680]  occasions on the different conspiracies that they're involved with and by the way
[26:19.680 --> 26:24.120]  we've got governor Jesse Ventura's with us talking about the new TV show that's
[26:24.120 --> 26:28.400]  coming up in December and January called conspiracy theory on true TV again
[26:28.400 --> 26:33.080]  Jesse Ventura is our guest how much can you tell us about the 9-11 episode
[26:33.080 --> 26:37.760]  because I know that more and more as you went out and tried to talk to them no
[26:37.760 --> 26:45.160]  one would and Jesse Ventura Navy Seal governor you know fighter is a lot more
[26:45.160 --> 26:49.120]  intimidating and a lot more effective than when Michael Moore and I'm not
[26:49.120 --> 26:54.000]  against Michael Moore kind of ninnies around I mean this is some dynamic
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.360]  confrontations in many ways Michael Moore probably got more cooperation than
[26:59.360 --> 27:08.960]  I got none I got none when it came to 9-11 no one from the government would
[27:08.960 --> 27:14.320]  talk to the show no one from the 9-11 Commission would talk no one
[27:14.320 --> 27:19.280]  representing any type of government agency would talk you know I don't want
[27:19.280 --> 27:23.120]  to wreck the show by saying what we did and where we did it and do all that
[27:23.120 --> 27:29.600]  because I want people to watch the show the show came about like this a victim
[27:29.600 --> 27:36.800]  came to me and a victim pleaded with me a victim who lost her daughter and her
[27:36.800 --> 27:42.960]  potential grandchild her daughter was pregnant and she died the day the
[27:42.960 --> 27:50.080]  infamous day of 9-11 and her mom you know came to me feeling that I was the
[27:50.080 --> 27:53.680]  person with this show who could bring to light the fact that we need a real
[27:53.680 --> 27:59.920]  investigation of 9-11 and not the one that they did and so it's a natural
[27:59.920 --> 28:04.720]  progression then when when it's brought to me the next person I want to talk to
[28:04.720 --> 28:09.680]  is someone who is there someone who actually went through 9-11 which we
[28:09.680 --> 28:14.120]  were able to do also at the show and then from there the progression goes to
[28:14.120 --> 28:19.600]  someone who was there during the cleanup you know the almost 300 days that it
[28:19.600 --> 28:24.000]  took to clean up the mess and what went on there did an investigation to crew
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.960]  there we have but the person who identified and saw the black boxes
[28:28.960 --> 28:34.600]  which of course the government tells us were not found unbelievable again I
[28:34.600 --> 28:38.400]  don't want to give away too much but I want people to watch that's why I'm just
[28:38.400 --> 28:42.200]  going to talk I'm not going to give specifics of the show Alex because I
[28:42.200 --> 28:47.440]  want everyone to enjoy the show and I should and I won't narrate it before it
[28:47.440 --> 28:51.960]  goes on the air no no no that's I mean you're giving us a lot here and I know a
[28:51.960 --> 28:55.560]  lot of the inside baseball and obviously I'm sworn to secrecy I'm just
[28:55.560 --> 29:00.680]  telling folks I'm surprised you're able to get this on air Jesse because Alex
[29:00.680 --> 29:08.640]  it ain't on yet I've got I made a gentleman's bed at the start of this
[29:08.640 --> 29:14.360]  show that it would never see air I see I thought we would complete them all but I
[29:14.360 --> 29:19.440]  felt strongly that at some point in time someone wouldn't allow it and so far it's
[29:19.440 --> 29:25.040]  full steam ahead now we do have to wait till December 2nd because that's the
[29:25.040 --> 29:29.960]  airing again of the first show which is you know that's a couple weeks away yet
[29:29.960 --> 29:35.360]  three weeks away in fact I remember in October you were in my car we were

[32:57.760 --> 33:18.880]  Well former Minnesota governor, former MSNBC host, former top wrestler, Hollywood
[33:18.880 --> 33:25.960]  movie star, author, best-selling author, multiple times over, and surfer, Jesse
[33:25.960 --> 33:30.160]  Ventura joins us the surf is up he is here okay let's go through this then
[33:30.160 --> 33:36.760]  Alex, how's the surf since that storm has hit Alabama down there? You know what I
[33:36.760 --> 33:41.280]  hear that there is a huge surf down at the gulf right now and every time I go
[33:41.280 --> 33:47.120]  down there there's surfers everywhere. Why don't you just jump on an airplane
[33:47.120 --> 33:53.920]  fly listen you can fly to Corpus Christi in two hours from Minnesota and three
[33:53.920 --> 34:00.480]  and a half four hours from now you could be on the beach in 12-foot swells but
[34:00.480 --> 34:05.680]  unfortunately I got too much publicity to do. Unfortunately you're here on air
[34:05.680 --> 34:09.400]  with us but we're all happy governor. Well it'd be tomorrow anyway and so I got
[34:09.400 --> 34:12.760]  publicity all day tomorrow today you couldn't I couldn't get there in time
[34:12.760 --> 34:16.840]  so it'd have to be tomorrow but oh well we'll pass on it this time I'm certain
[34:16.840 --> 34:22.080]  there'll be more storms especially after learning about harp. Absolutely you know I
[34:22.080 --> 34:25.720]  had the director of harp on one time and he admitted oh we turn the
[34:25.720 --> 34:30.080]  atmosphere on fire with it at night and starts laughing and then somebody on the
[34:30.080 --> 34:35.720]  line cut the line off and my producer saw this and during the break a Air Force
[34:35.720 --> 34:39.560]  officer came on and said you can't talk about that anymore so the military was
[34:39.560 --> 34:46.200]  bossing the civilian scientific head of harp around. Well what's interesting and
[34:46.200 --> 34:50.120]  of course for those that don't know what harp is harp is way up in Alaska and
[34:50.120 --> 34:55.480]  that's one of the shows we go up to visit and photograph it and it's a group
[34:55.480 --> 35:01.600]  of about 180 radio antennas that all shoot 50,000 watts of energy up into the
[35:01.600 --> 35:06.840]  biosphere. I should say low frequency sounds up into the
[35:06.840 --> 35:13.320]  biosphere which does cause a heating. Now Alex let me ask you this, could that
[35:13.320 --> 35:18.880]  possibly contribute to global warming? Absolutely in fact the scientists we've
[35:18.880 --> 35:23.280]  interviewed. This could be much more contributing to global warming than us
[35:23.280 --> 35:29.560]  driving our cars around. Well as you know Secretary of Defense Cohen in 97
[35:29.560 --> 35:33.280]  admitted to the Army Times they did have weather weapons then and I've
[35:33.280 --> 35:37.720]  interviewed the former father of weather weapons Ben Livingston and clearly I
[35:37.720 --> 35:42.440]  believe this is a false flag attack. We have had a lot of strange weather and
[35:42.440 --> 35:45.880]  that naturally occurs but there's been a lot of. That's going to be that's the
[35:45.880 --> 35:50.720]  opening show Alex. The opening show December 2nd is on harp and I think
[35:50.720 --> 35:55.960]  people are going to find it a very interesting show. I went all the way up
[35:55.960 --> 36:02.200]  to Alaska and went to this location and we jumped into a helicopter and bear this
[36:02.200 --> 36:09.480]  in mind this thing can knock airplanes out of the air and it's a very
[36:09.480 --> 36:15.520]  interesting thing going on up there. It's the government it falls under let me put
[36:15.520 --> 36:21.080]  it this way it falls under the military the Air Force and yet it is given the
[36:21.080 --> 36:26.440]  distinction of being an unclassified research center yet I was not allowed in.
[36:26.440 --> 36:32.080]  Now bear in mind I used to have a top-secret security clearance with the
[36:32.080 --> 36:36.200]  United States government during my six years as a member of underwater
[36:36.200 --> 36:42.840]  demolition team 12 and SEAL team one. I was also a mayor and a governor and yet
[36:42.840 --> 36:48.680]  I was not allowed to go into this supposed unclassified research center.
[36:48.680 --> 36:55.760]  If it's unclassified anybody should be able to go in there. Well that's a good
[36:55.760 --> 37:01.600]  point Jesse on this specific subject we can get into more detail because this
[37:01.600 --> 37:05.360]  has been released to the media I want to play this clip and then ask you about
[37:05.360 --> 37:09.080]  this is a one-minute clip of Governor Jesse Ventura being stopped at the
[37:09.080 --> 37:16.320]  gates he's about to just I guess bull his way on in there and suddenly the
[37:16.320 --> 37:21.920]  equipment goes dead and I talked to the crew this really happened so they were
[37:21.920 --> 37:26.880]  using some type of electronic warfare jamming system here it is ladies and
[37:26.880 --> 37:31.800]  gentlemen really need to go through the Air Force. Well we did we got Stonewall and
[37:31.800 --> 37:36.800]  this is strictly a research facility clearly there's something going on here
[37:36.800 --> 37:40.520]  that they don't want people to know about. There's a lot of cool science that we do
[37:40.520 --> 37:45.640]  with this specific. Come on man I'm a Navy SEAL. The military don't do things unless
[37:45.640 --> 37:49.440]  it has a military purpose and the military purpose is destruction and
[37:49.440 --> 38:04.320]  wage and war. It's a stalemate or is it? Back up a little bit from the days when people come through getting intimidated. When I did denied something I do the opposite of getting intimidated. I get angry. Jesse is about to walk
[38:04.320 --> 38:17.440]  right on through when suddenly the camera equipment begins to go haywire something
[38:17.440 --> 38:22.960]  is interfering with the audio and video. This is more than unclassified that's
[38:22.960 --> 38:30.240]  bullshit. All right now that was that aired on CNN we the potty language was
[38:30.240 --> 38:35.800]  cut out but I don't blame the governor under that bizarre stress so tell us
[38:35.800 --> 38:40.640]  what you can about the harp episode because this is amazing. Well you know
[38:40.640 --> 38:45.840]  we were denied access as I said and you know even though the security
[38:45.840 --> 38:50.160]  clearances I've had in my life and holding the position of governor I guess
[38:50.160 --> 38:54.240]  Alex the only way I guess I can get in there is to run and get reelected to
[38:54.240 --> 38:58.560]  something again you know then maybe I would be high enough in the government
[38:58.560 --> 39:03.120]  that they would let me in and see what they're doing there but that aside and
[39:03.120 --> 39:08.760]  then we did have some problem now it made it seem I don't know what caused our
[39:08.760 --> 39:13.880]  cameras to go bad I do I am not going to specifically sit here and say that they
[39:13.880 --> 39:19.080]  jammed them that they did something to them I will simply state that our audio
[39:19.080 --> 39:24.400]  and our visual did have some problems while we were outside the gate who
[39:24.400 --> 39:30.240]  or what was responsible we never were sure we never were sure or positively
[39:30.240 --> 39:33.760]  found out but to be specific and correct me if I'm wrong because I was just
[39:33.760 --> 39:36.920]  talking to some of the crew while we were shooting separately back in Los
[39:36.920 --> 39:43.000]  Angeles they said that multiple cameras and audio and on the digital recordings
[39:43.000 --> 39:49.000]  it was even distorting I mean this wasn't just one one rig to have separate
[39:49.000 --> 39:54.000]  malfunctions the same malfunctions you're talking about one in a billion one
[39:54.000 --> 39:58.920]  in a trillion I mean this is bizarre I don't know I don't know but all I can
[39:58.920 --> 40:04.360]  say is that we did run into complications and what caused them or why we
[40:04.360 --> 40:09.200]  were never able to ascertain but you know and then when we were and then later
[40:09.200 --> 40:14.080]  on all the equipment later we're fine and we never had any more problem with
[40:14.080 --> 40:20.480]  at the rest of the shoot well I want to say clearly on the record that from the
[40:20.480 --> 40:25.080]  scientists we've interviewed harp is designed to be a weapon it can heat the
[40:25.080 --> 40:32.400]  atmosphere it can direct those huge rivers of vapor of condensation of water
[40:32.400 --> 40:37.200]  as weapons and the Chinese brag the Russians brag you can hire their
[40:37.200 --> 40:42.280]  government-funded companies to control the weather for you this is let's
[40:42.280 --> 40:47.240]  remember something to Alex there were treaties signed back in the 1970s that
[40:47.240 --> 40:54.200]  governments would not use weapon would not use weather or nature for war and we
[40:54.200 --> 40:58.560]  were one of the people that signed these treaties and I think that's an
[40:58.560 --> 41:04.400]  important issue right here if we sign treaties that we won't use things won't
[41:04.400 --> 41:09.880]  use nature to commit war and and then we might very well be violating the very
[41:09.880 --> 41:14.520]  treaties we've signed well that's a great point and you made the point to me
[41:14.520 --> 41:19.320]  privately that well Alex why are we signing treaties for weather weapons if
[41:19.320 --> 41:27.320]  they don't exist that's true also so you know and I think people are also going
[41:27.320 --> 41:31.840]  to enjoy there's another part of heart that we haven't mentioned today that
[41:31.840 --> 41:36.160]  will be the most terrifying of anything we've talked about and I'm gonna leave
[41:36.160 --> 41:40.560]  that up in the air because harp is going to be to my knowledge the first
[41:40.560 --> 41:45.920]  episode December 2nd again our shamelessly promoted 10 o'clock Eastern
[41:45.920 --> 41:50.760]  9 o'clock Central on the truth channel harp will be the first episode to my
[41:50.760 --> 41:55.040]  knowledge if they change it then I don't know about it and there's something in
[41:55.040 --> 41:59.840]  harp beyond what we've even talked about Alex that is more terrifying than
[41:59.840 --> 42:03.960]  what we have talked about and I know what it is but I'm gonna keep my mouth
[42:03.960 --> 42:07.560]  shut it this is coming up you know finishing up before we get into the
[42:07.560 --> 42:12.200]  other episodes during the break we were talking you you're saying you made the
[42:12.200 --> 42:16.200]  bet with your crew and I remember you telling me privately in the car you said
[42:16.200 --> 42:21.080]  we'll see if it's gonna air I don't think it will but but we'll see I'm gonna
[42:21.080 --> 42:27.480]  try well I did a gentleman's bet with my crew in task basically I said I I bet
[42:27.480 --> 42:32.440]  you no money involved just a gentleman's bet that we will complete all of these
[42:32.440 --> 42:38.560]  we will do all seven episodes and and we'll finish them all but I said I
[42:38.560 --> 42:42.520]  still don't believe they will see the light of day that they will be aired and
[42:42.520 --> 42:47.360]  so far I'm losing the gentleman's bet but there's still about three weeks to go
[42:47.360 --> 42:53.360]  and I hope that I do lose it I do not want and I'm a competitive person I do
[42:53.360 --> 42:59.080]  not like to lose anything but I'm hoping that I lose this bet I don't want to win
[42:59.080 --> 43:04.560]  this bet well I hope that you do lose the bet as well because I've been
[43:04.560 --> 43:10.800]  involved in a few TV productions one of them this way Alex if it doesn't see the
[43:10.800 --> 43:15.640]  light of day the show that we've completed then I need then I need to come
[43:15.640 --> 43:21.040]  back on your show and we need to ask why we need to at that point start
[43:21.040 --> 43:27.560]  addressing I believe the First Amendment I agree with you well I I don't see how
[43:27.560 --> 43:31.680]  they're gonna air something that's more than fair from our perspective and for
[43:31.680 --> 43:35.560]  one I've seen and I know you're an honorable person this is a extremely
[43:35.560 --> 43:40.320]  fair leaning towards our perspective because as you said you couldn't get
[43:40.320 --> 43:45.240]  the other side to come out and debate there's nothing but stonewalling it
[43:45.240 --> 43:49.240]  isn't even a debate Alex we couldn't even get them to come out and make a
[43:49.240 --> 43:54.280]  comment the government wouldn't talk to us plain and simple they wouldn't talk
[43:54.280 --> 43:59.320]  on harp they wouldn't talk on 9-11 they wouldn't talk on anything that
[43:59.320 --> 44:04.560]  involves the government and and their involvement in any type of conspiracy or
[44:04.560 --> 44:09.320]  whatever the conspiracy is you cannot get anyone from government to
[44:09.320 --> 44:13.840]  participate or talk in any manner it's that simple and people need to
[44:13.840 --> 44:19.120]  understand that's the scary thing overwhelmingly scary thing about doing
[44:19.120 --> 44:23.200]  this whole show is the fact that government doesn't happen to have to
[44:23.200 --> 44:28.920]  operate they act like we work for them and I believe they've forgotten something
[44:28.920 --> 44:34.040]  and we've forgotten something they work for us that's the way it's supposed to
[44:34.040 --> 44:38.280]  be but in this country I believe those goals have switched now and the
[44:38.280 --> 44:44.080]  government views us working for them rather than the way it's supposed to be
[44:44.080 --> 44:49.760]  well that's just an incredible point that things really are backwards now in
[44:49.760 --> 44:55.440]  this nation in this country and if they do allow this to go on television which
[44:55.440 --> 45:00.280]  it looks like it's going to happen is that the system is so arrogant that
[45:00.280 --> 45:04.160]  they don't even care if we know the truth now I'm seeing George Soros and Al
[45:04.160 --> 45:09.400]  Gore and Ban Ki-moon of the UN openly say we're going under world government
[45:09.400 --> 45:13.480]  openly saying it's a new world order openly stating it's about population
[45:13.480 --> 45:18.960]  reduction one-child policy LA Times reports is going to be a tax on owning a
[45:18.960 --> 45:23.640]  dog or cat because they eat meat which has a carbon footprint you've got the
[45:23.640 --> 45:26.960]  global warming episode we're going to talk about that I mean they're really
[45:26.960 --> 45:30.480]  coming out in the open so is it that they don't have total control of the
[45:30.480 --> 45:34.560]  media and this and so you're getting through the chink in the armor or is it
[45:34.560 --> 45:38.720]  they're so arrogant now they don't care if Governor Ventura goes out and tells
[45:38.720 --> 45:42.640]  you how screwed you are they might even sit back and you know roast some March
[45:42.640 --> 45:50.280]  mellows and laugh at us I don't know Alex I I'm not in contact with any of these quote-unquote people so I
[45:50.280 --> 45:54.520]  have no idea by the way our global warming is the is the last one that
[45:54.520 --> 45:59.800]  that I list to you of the we do a is global warming at conspiracy that we
[45:59.800 --> 46:03.360]  were both here trying to remember all seven episodes and finally came to me so
[46:03.360 --> 46:07.240]  I thought I'd shout it out well you got it right there because that was the
[46:07.240 --> 46:11.080]  seventh one that I like I said when I shot these things they were not in
[46:11.080 --> 46:16.080]  sequence always and so it can get pretty confusing it was a lot like
[46:16.080 --> 46:20.520]  governing where you go from one meeting one hour to a completely different
[46:20.520 --> 46:23.720]  meeting the next hour no no I know it makes your head spin especially when
[46:23.720 --> 46:28.240]  you're really into the minutiae let's get into 2012 then we'll get into
[46:28.240 --> 46:32.720]  secret societies Manchurian candidate big brother and global warming 2012
[46:32.720 --> 46:40.480]  obviously three days from now on Friday the huge movie is coming out where
[46:40.480 --> 46:44.720]  Woody Harrelson kind of plays the conspiracy theory type I'm I know
[46:44.720 --> 46:48.280]  Harrelson so we're trying to get him on the show in fact that may happen but
[46:48.280 --> 46:54.160]  what's your whole take on the real 2012 and the serious in-depth research you
[46:54.160 --> 46:58.880]  did and then separately in the show I know you get into without saying too much
[46:58.880 --> 47:03.440]  whether it's real or not the elite think it's real and they are getting ready I
[47:03.440 --> 47:07.120]  mean to me I think that in fact I wish I was in that episode I've been told I'm
[47:07.120 --> 47:13.000]  not to me that's going to be one of the hottest episodes well it is and let me
[47:13.000 --> 47:17.320]  just put it this way and again I'm not going to go in and make it so people
[47:17.320 --> 47:23.680]  won't watch by telling everything that happens but it goes far beyond let me
[47:23.680 --> 47:29.080]  say this the Mayan calendar now the Mayans were very intelligent people way
[47:29.080 --> 47:34.000]  ahead of their time when it came to understanding the planets of the solar
[47:34.000 --> 47:39.400]  system in the heavens they truly were because I've learned this even with all
[47:39.400 --> 47:45.320]  of our modern technology today the Mayans are right on our technology for
[47:45.320 --> 47:51.560]  the most part cannot prove them wrong under most things so here you had a
[47:51.560 --> 47:57.040]  culture that took place many many many years ago that was very very bright when
[47:57.040 --> 48:05.200]  it came to space and just 2012 show goes beyond the Mayan calendar it goes to
[48:05.200 --> 48:11.000]  some things that we know are actually real and completely backed up by NASA and
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.440]  that's where I'll leave it right there because I want people intrigued I want
[48:15.440 --> 48:21.640]  them to watch the show and the show will be on long before 2012 arrives are you
[48:21.640 --> 48:25.480]  knowing what you now know doing the deep research are you concerned about 2012
[48:25.480 --> 48:32.480]  I'm concerned yeah I'm concerned over things that I have learned yes I'm
[48:32.480 --> 48:37.480]  very concerned over them and I'll end when later on when the show is all
[48:37.480 --> 48:42.880]  here Alex will and I don't have to try to intrigue a listening audience anymore
[48:42.880 --> 48:47.600]  I'll be glad to come back on the show and openly talk about what concerns me
[48:47.600 --> 48:51.520]  after it airs absolutely that'd be a great radio interview and also talk
[48:51.520 --> 48:55.320]  about how much hit the cutting room floor you guys have done a ton of work I
[48:55.320 --> 49:00.840]  mean they've been working your butt off yeah I've been here here I'm trying you
[49:00.840 --> 49:05.240]  know how it works in the country Alex when you try to retire and quit that's
[49:05.240 --> 49:10.320]  when your agent finds your jobs when you but when you're looking for the jobs
[49:10.320 --> 49:16.240]  for 20 years they can't find you anything no I've been to LA so many times I
[49:16.240 --> 49:20.320]  can't remember since summer I've been to Anchorage Alaska I've been to San
[49:20.320 --> 49:26.200]  Francisco I've been to Oklahoma City Kansas City New York multiple multiple
[49:26.200 --> 49:31.120]  times and I've lost track a few a few of the other places that I've been to but
[49:31.120 --> 49:36.120]  the most unique was the thing going up to Anchorage to learn about harp
[49:36.120 --> 49:42.680]  absolutely and again I'm a huggy bear let me interject Alex of which I up until
[49:42.680 --> 49:49.560]  about four months ago I didn't even know what harp was didn't even know what it
[49:49.560 --> 49:53.080]  was this has been quite a journey for you I know your son began to really get
[49:53.080 --> 49:57.680]  you into this five six years ago and obviously I gave you some films and
[49:57.680 --> 50:01.000]  that helped you along your journey and then you described it to me at the
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.600]  hotel that now it's like the top of your heads blown off the whole world's
[50:04.600 --> 50:09.520]  opening up and it's quite a journey isn't it governor well it sure is and
[50:09.520 --> 50:14.000]  the exciting thing that I'll tell people when people say to me why do I like to
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.800]  study this why do I like to look at it because these are things that very well
[50:18.800 --> 50:24.800]  can be real and when you read a writer like say Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn
[50:24.800 --> 50:29.440]  they're marvelous books but they're simply figments of their imagination
[50:29.440 --> 50:35.040]  they're carrying food carrying you through on their imaginary trip I would
[50:35.040 --> 50:40.480]  rather look into and read about real history and hopefully get educated on it
[50:40.480 --> 50:44.880]  so that we don't that we're not stupid enough to allow ourselves to repeat it
[50:44.880 --> 50:49.440]  which over and over I see it happening we were our stupidity is just
[50:49.440 --> 50:54.920]  unbelievable how we can be do over and over again absolutely I mean really a
[50:54.920 --> 50:58.800]  conspiracy theorist is someone with an alternative history view we'll be right

[54:25.240 --> 54:30.640]  Ventura is our guest governor one more time for people tuning in and getting
[54:30.640 --> 54:34.600]  this exclusive first look at the TV show that believe me is going to be
[54:34.600 --> 54:39.280]  powerful folks tell them when the seven episodes are going to air how they tune
[54:39.280 --> 54:44.960]  in how they watch it well it'll be on the true network which used to be court
[54:44.960 --> 54:49.880]  television it's located if you got the satellite I think it's right in between
[54:49.880 --> 54:55.280]  TBS and TMT it's the station in between if you're on the if you're on the
[54:55.280 --> 54:59.600]  direct dish satellite or whatever it is but you know check the whatever in
[54:59.600 --> 55:04.480]  any way the first show will air Wednesday December 2nd and it'll be 10
[55:04.480 --> 55:09.920]  o'clock Eastern 9 o'clock Central and it's a one-hour show we're doing seven
[55:09.920 --> 55:15.680]  conspiracies and naturally I'd like to say this can we get completely into the
[55:15.680 --> 55:19.760]  conspiracies and everything about them absolutely not you can never do that in
[55:19.760 --> 55:26.080]  an hour so we focus on just certain portions of the conspiracy which I
[55:26.080 --> 55:29.880]  think people will find it especially your your listening audience Alex are
[55:29.880 --> 55:34.240]  going to find it very interesting and so it's going to be airing every every
[55:34.240 --> 55:39.040]  Wednesday in December and January or are they going to skip one on Christmas I
[55:39.040 --> 55:44.200]  have no idea I'll be gone surfing at that time and I'll leave all of you up
[55:44.200 --> 55:50.240]  here to take the repercussions from it what are you going to do if I come
[55:50.240 --> 55:54.120]  parachuting in when you're out there surfing well and I'll know everything
[55:54.120 --> 55:57.880]  hit the fan up here because I know that if you're not doing your daily radio
[55:57.880 --> 56:03.600]  show then the United States don't exist anymore now is my bunker ready next to
[56:03.600 --> 56:13.840]  your bungalow I don't know my neighbor Fernando he had to dig a 40 foot well
[56:13.840 --> 56:17.640]  down there and it took him six months but it would have taken him a year had
[56:17.640 --> 56:24.040]  been good waves absolutely absolutely okay we're going to come back and take
[56:24.040 --> 56:28.360]  phone calls but right now let's get into the global warming episode okay I mean
[56:28.360 --> 56:32.360]  just give us a little taste of that well the big thing on global warming to me is
[56:32.360 --> 56:38.320]  this cap and trade legislation it's nothing but bait and switch it's a
[56:38.320 --> 56:43.640]  legislation that's designed to make money not solve the problem and if if
[56:43.640 --> 56:49.040]  global warming is indeed a problem then why is the solution simply money making
[56:49.040 --> 56:54.080]  that that does nothing to address the actual problem and that's the key of
[56:54.080 --> 56:58.880]  what we try to expose and this is the cap and trade legislation for what it is
[56:58.880 --> 57:04.920]  and the fact that there are 30,000 people with PhDs and science degrees that
[57:04.920 --> 57:08.840]  simply are not buying into global warming and it doesn't seem to be that
[57:08.840 --> 57:14.200]  they get any type of thought their opinion is not being aired at all that's
[57:14.200 --> 57:19.200]  right very one-sided opinion well yeah when Al Gore says all scientists agree
[57:19.200 --> 57:23.760]  it's man-made and then you find out that actually the majority say it's driven
[57:23.760 --> 57:28.760]  by the Sun and by nuclei from space causing cloud condensation I mean I'm
[57:28.760 --> 57:31.920]  not going to give away who you interview in the film but this is going to be a
[57:31.920 --> 57:37.760]  powerful death blow one more nail in the coffin against the greenies that want
[57:37.760 --> 57:41.920]  to taxes I mean it's come out that Al Gore is made over a billion bucks so far
[57:41.920 --> 57:47.160]  off this I mean he owns a cap and trade company that you've got to buy carbon
[57:47.160 --> 57:51.240]  credits from I mean how obvious is this well again it comes down to the
[57:51.240 --> 57:55.600]  legislative whether I'm not I'm not a scientist Alex so I'm not going to beat
[57:55.600 --> 58:00.480]  my head against the wall on whether it's real or not but a good way to look at
[58:00.480 --> 58:05.160]  things is always view something not from what someone says but from what
[58:05.160 --> 58:11.080]  someone does and the cap and trade legislation is fraudulent because you
[58:11.080 --> 58:15.560]  can have a company that's that's supposedly polluting they don't have to
[58:15.560 --> 58:21.720]  change at all they can simply pay money and buy other people's and trade so that
[58:21.720 --> 58:25.840]  tell they get under and they'll still pollute the same but then they'll be
[58:25.840 --> 58:30.360]  able to say that they're not well that right away is fraudulent and if that's
[58:30.360 --> 58:35.040]  fraudulent then what else is fraudulent I tell you that's a key point take the
[58:35.040 --> 58:38.240]  weakest part of their argument break their neck right there that's why we
[58:38.240 --> 58:45.080]  love you governor stay with thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit

[59:43.680 --> 59:46.680]  what you do dot net
[59:46.680 --> 59:59.680]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:00:03.680 --> 1:00:11.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:11.480 --> 1:00:19.000]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:25.720]  Alex Jones all right in this five minutes we're gonna get into secret
[1:00:25.720 --> 1:00:32.840]  society's Manchurian candidate and big brother the three episodes we haven't
[1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:41.240]  given you a little teaser on it premieres December 2nd true TV tell
[1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:43.800]  everybody about it folks because I think this is going to be the not just
[1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:47.720]  Ferris but leaning towards our view of any television show ever on mainstream
[1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:50.720]  TV I think this is a bellwether because the establishments beginning to
[1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:56.360]  realize that they become obsolete by never discussing this information so
[1:00:56.360 --> 1:01:00.280]  television's losing ratings and the internet's exploding governor Jesse
[1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:05.440]  Ventura getting into Manchurian candidates secret societies big brother
[1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:11.400]  what do you want to talk about first well I guess let's go Manchurian candidate
[1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:17.920]  this one is going to be a very this one is a very terrifying show we all know
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:24.280]  that MK ultra was real the document states so so there's no gray area there
[1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:29.840]  that the government was in the business back in the 50s 60s and 70s of
[1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:34.920]  attempting to control people's minds and then and attempting to manipulate them
[1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:39.880]  and to use them to their advantage both militarily and whatever well all
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:44.040]  indications are that those programs have been re-ramped up again and they're back
[1:01:44.040 --> 1:01:49.600]  on a high level again and that being said that's what the Manchurian
[1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:54.560]  candidate deals with of course and that we've all heard the story one of the
[1:01:54.560 --> 1:01:59.320]  interesting things I'll say is that the guy who shot John Lennon fits it
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:05.800]  perfectly Mark David Chapman because contrary to popular belief Chapman was
[1:02:05.800 --> 1:02:11.200]  no Beatles fanatic if you go back in his history in fact his favorite artist was
[1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:18.280]  Todd Rungren who's hardly a Beatle and when he shot Lennon he could he had three
[1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:23.120]  ways to escape immediately Central Park down into the subways and then just get
[1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:27.840]  lost with everybody instead he stepped back in the shadows and started
[1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:32.840]  reading the book to catch her in the ride which is a classic mind control when
[1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:36.760]  they torture them under the drugs and in one of the systems they then become
[1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:40.320]  obsessed with the trigger word when McVeigh got pulled over he said get the
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:43.680]  chip out of me and was foaming at the mouth and then the most famous mind
[1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:48.760]  control scientist ever Jolly and West was his doctor with him every day until
[1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:53.760]  the day he was executed and I'll tell you this governor studying the Fort Hood
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:58.480]  shooting I can't say it was a mind control but it has every earmark he's a
[1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:03.320]  psychiatrist the FBI and CIA were funny you should say that Alex because
[1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:06.240]  amazingly when I when it first happened
[1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:11.400]  scarily that's the first thing that popped into my head unbelievable that
[1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:15.960]  you say that because that's the exact first thing that popped into my head when
[1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:20.760]  I when I first heard about the Fort Hood shootings and when I started then
[1:03:20.760 --> 1:03:26.400]  reading about the whole situation how the guy never had it in his background and
[1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:30.880]  then now the CIA and FBI are watching him and he has this fake history that
[1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:34.720]  suddenly began and then commanders and people said bust him and they wouldn't
[1:03:34.720 --> 1:03:40.160]  do it same thing with 9-11 then he's a psychiatrist he has that whole history
[1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:45.560]  once you've studied mind control he just fits every piece fits and I wouldn't
[1:03:45.560 --> 1:03:49.560]  say this last week I mean I knew that was going on Thursday but now more and
[1:03:49.560 --> 1:03:53.160]  more of the pieces are coming out and man the hair on the back of my neck just
[1:03:53.160 --> 1:04:01.200]  stands up okay we got to go to break we're gonna come back and briefly get
[1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:08.760]  into into secret societies and big brother watching big brother so we'll
[1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:13.160]  talk about that but governor in the 45 seconds we've got tell us about your
[1:04:13.160 --> 1:04:18.600]  book don't start the revolution without me what about it well know just how
[1:04:18.600 --> 1:04:21.960]  folks can get it it's it's been a best-selling I don't know they're still
[1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:26.400]  in the bookstores I guess you get it over the internet I've been so involved in
[1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:30.240]  this thing I haven't even thought about the books for months well I just wanted
[1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:34.080]  to plug your book because it's a good book thank you and it's still out there
[1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:37.320]  I was actually in the Minneapolis Airport the other day and I saw copies

[1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:09.080]  center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex
[1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:13.480]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:08:13.480 --> 1:08:26.680]  Governor Jesse Ventura he has worn a lot of hats but now he is fighting the new
[1:08:26.680 --> 1:08:30.200]  world order and I don't want to put words in his mouth but governor I think
[1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:33.280]  it's safe to say I mean you now know there's a world government there is an
[1:08:33.280 --> 1:08:38.320]  elite the question is how evil are they are they monolithic what is their main
[1:08:38.320 --> 1:08:42.960]  goal I mean is it's fair to say that you're now officially you're not they're
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:47.320]  labeled a conspiracy theorist but I mean you question JFK you question 9-11 you
[1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:51.840]  question harp but you're not buying the Kool-Aid they're selling is that fair to
[1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:57.440]  say well let me put it this way irregardless of anything it sure is
[1:08:57.440 --> 1:09:03.400]  interesting stuff and you know we we do what we do a show on the build of birds
[1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:07.800]  and I I do understand that they're real I guess the thing that upsets me the
[1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:15.000]  most was I made it to governor and they never invited me and I would and I I
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:19.360]  guess maybe I got a run for office again then so I get invited to this thing to
[1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:23.280]  find out what the hell goes on inside there well they would have invited you
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:26.680]  if you would have gone along with the CIA when they set you down at the
[1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:30.920]  governor's office in the office but I mean you're not selling people out
[1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:37.080]  you're a swashbuckling you know loose cannon for freedom but well I mean what
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:40.400]  is your view on the new world order then because I know your anti-establishment
[1:09:40.400 --> 1:09:44.480]  and let me put it this way then I also look at it from a different perspective
[1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:51.240]  out Alex I believe in evolution the science of evolution and maybe this is
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:57.480]  evolution you know when you look at it that we will evolve and that maybe it
[1:09:57.480 --> 1:10:02.640]  won't fully be here in our lifetimes but a hundred years from now because of the
[1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:07.960]  fact with technology the way it is the world gets smaller and smaller and
[1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:14.080]  smaller and I guess let me just for the sake of argument state that there would
[1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:17.840]  be one good thing if there was a one-world government you know what that
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:24.120]  would be there that there couldn't be wars then put there but see governor
[1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:29.480]  that is I mean I mean literally if you wouldn't have one country fighting
[1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:33.800]  another country no but that's not their plan I understand that Alex don't
[1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:39.120]  don't for a minute think I'm naive but I am saying that there is the chance that
[1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:43.240]  this could be almost an evolutionary thing that we will evolve to the point
[1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:48.720]  where there may well be a one-world government and there may be no way
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:53.080]  around it well Jesse then the important thing Alex is what will that
[1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:58.320]  government be well that's the issue here is that they always pitch it that we
[1:10:58.320 --> 1:11:02.960]  were hunter-gatherers we were agrarian we formed villages and city states the
[1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:07.520]  nations that empires and the next phase is Star Trek that we've been implanted
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:11.520]  with psychologically the image of the global galactic empire and we're always
[1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:15.840]  fighting green aliens you know the Klingon so we've got to do this the issue
[1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:23.320]  is they built this world government in stealth and denied that it existed until
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:27.200]  it was too late to really stop it and now they're coming out going yeah we're
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:29.880]  going to tax everything you do we're not going to let you have more than one
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:33.920]  kid and yeah we want to carry out eugenics on you and we're going to
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:38.440]  carbon tax you and ban chi moon writes editorials saying the carbon taxes for
[1:11:38.440 --> 1:11:42.720]  the new world order and it's for a bunch of corrupt CEOs and bankers to play
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:47.680]  emperor and so if the people of the world ever wanted to create a world
[1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:51.560]  government and it was democratic and under the republic system then that
[1:11:51.560 --> 1:11:56.080]  would be one thing but but this thing was created by a corrupt group of
[1:11:56.080 --> 1:12:00.640]  criminals and it's a world tyranny that's why every ounce of my body and
[1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:07.760]  being just like Thomas Jefferson said I I swear eternal resistance to all forms
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:12.920]  of tyranny over the minds of men and and you Jesse I know you I mean don't you
[1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:17.320]  swear I Alex I wholeheartedly agree with you I'm not going to dispute anything
[1:12:17.320 --> 1:12:24.600]  you've said I won't but the point is and you're correct if it was so good why
[1:12:24.600 --> 1:12:29.800]  would they do it in secret and that's a very very valid point to make but the
[1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:33.680]  point we have to make if it's inevitable that we're going to come under one
[1:12:33.680 --> 1:12:38.800]  world rule then we the people have to ensure that we're we have that we're
[1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:43.920]  players in the game that we have dogs in the fight but I don't want to be under
[1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:48.680]  the communist Chinese is making sure we got a dog in the fight no no I hear you
[1:12:48.680 --> 1:12:53.320]  but instead so we never have a dog in the fight they just say there isn't a
[1:12:53.320 --> 1:12:56.520]  world government meet your world government I mean they're still saying
[1:12:56.520 --> 1:13:00.960]  world government doesn't exist so that we can never demand representation
[1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:06.440]  interesting was I was out at that new Denver Airport right the new one in
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:12.160]  Denver yes and on and on the plaque that that they have out there on the bottom
[1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:19.240]  of it says the new world Airport Commission and there isn't one nothing
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:24.940]  of that name is in existence and there's murals of Nazis put that on the
[1:13:24.940 --> 1:13:30.040]  dedication plaque at the debt that big Denver Airport the new world not the
[1:13:30.040 --> 1:13:35.080]  Colorado Airport Commission not the Denver Airport Commission but the new
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:40.000]  world the Airport Commission and they have paintings of Nazis killing children
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:47.800]  above they're not Nazis I just prove that well there's people in fascist style
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:53.640]  uniforms they are not Nazis you know how I just prove that Alex how the guys
[1:13:53.640 --> 1:13:58.680]  carrying an AK-47 I saw it right away I said this can't be a Nazi the Nazis
[1:13:58.680 --> 1:14:01.920]  didn't have that weapon yeah but I don't think the artist knows that the
[1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:09.240]  collision is an Eastern block weapon hey Jesse I want to take some calls in
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:13.560]  time is let's take some calls but but a plug right here in the middle of this
[1:14:13.560 --> 1:14:17.200]  conversation I'm gonna mail you I've forgotten to mail you fall of the
[1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:21.760]  Republic because this details from the globalist own statements that they are
[1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:24.800]  setting up a tyrannical world government that they engineered the
[1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:29.560]  banking Christ by the crisis by design and that they are setting up a citizen
[1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:33.280]  spy force police state system so I hope all the listeners will get a copy of
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:37.800]  fall of the Republic at info wars calm the online video bookstore and support
[1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:41.560]  what we're doing here but also show it to everyone you know because this film
[1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:46.960]  exposes the wider agenda and Alex let me shamelessly add in please watch my
[1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:52.200]  television show because if we get such an overwhelming audience response it'll
[1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:56.920]  force them to buy it up for another deal and we'll be able to get that much
[1:14:56.920 --> 1:15:01.800]  farther into it then and then like the X files I get the spin-off like the lone
[1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:07.320]  gunman there you go okay now we're getting into real inside baseball look
[1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:10.600]  this show is important and I want everybody to tell their friends and
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:15.920]  family and neighbors true TV December 2nd airing every Wednesday absolutely
[1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:20.600]  important because this this show is definitely from our perspective okay I
[1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:23.440]  want to go to some calls but we got to finish up with the last point we just
[1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:27.680]  hit Manchurian candidate secret societies what about big brother you
[1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:33.080]  talked it well go ahead brothers is just simply that is big brother are they
[1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:38.000]  watching over you and I think in our show you're gonna hear clearly that they
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:43.520]  are and that clearly it's gonna come from a place where the government is a
[1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:49.080]  I'll just put this the government is able to do it and work around the
[1:15:49.080 --> 1:15:54.640]  Constitution we have found that out and we will air that on the show to where
[1:15:54.640 --> 1:15:59.800]  you will clearly see how the government has looped the Constitution in which
[1:15:59.800 --> 1:16:06.720]  establishing big brother on you can we say the different federal groups you
[1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:10.880]  talked to or just leave that alone I don't think I talked to any federal
[1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:14.400]  groups again there was no cooperation from the government well you talked to
[1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:17.720]  their minions though you talked to their Gestapo there their their their
[1:16:17.720 --> 1:16:23.440]  ground pounders their citizen spies well yes we did do that we'll just leave it
[1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:27.480]  there we'll just leave it there yeah just leave it at that well it's a very
[1:16:27.480 --> 1:16:34.000]  exciting right down in your country Alex I don't want to get in trouble believe

[1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:26.760]  12 minutes or so with governor Jesse Ventura giving you the inside scoop
[1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:31.000]  Jesse why did you give this show first the inside scoop I was very honored when
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:33.840]  you called me and said you were going to give us the exclusive one for a number
[1:17:33.840 --> 1:17:38.160]  of reasons Alex your participation in the show was exceptional and we
[1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:43.280]  appreciated it you know you flew out to LA a couple times and all that to
[1:17:43.280 --> 1:17:49.840]  participate and so why not I reward the people that reward me and and so that
[1:17:49.840 --> 1:17:55.200]  that's a reason for it plus you have the listening audience the base market that
[1:17:55.200 --> 1:18:00.440]  this show is designed for I would be crazy not to come on your show with my
[1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:04.880]  show because you know I'm not gonna lie we're out for success on this show I
[1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:09.800]  hope this shows it hugely success but I know the TV shows you turn down I mean
[1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:12.520]  I don't know if you want to say it but you're you're turning down something with
[1:18:12.520 --> 1:18:15.840]  30 million viewers coming up in a few weeks because you want to be out of the
[1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:18.520]  country I'm just really honored you can because I know you're turning down a
[1:18:18.520 --> 1:18:22.840]  bunch of really huge media interviews but but doing our shows we appreciate it
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:28.480]  well no problem and like I said that you know you're you're a wealth of
[1:18:28.480 --> 1:18:33.720]  information Alex that we can always rely upon and you know so doing your show
[1:18:33.720 --> 1:18:38.200]  is just simply the left hand washing the right hand well folks we're gonna post
[1:18:38.200 --> 1:18:42.000]  this interview up at info wars.com over 200,000 people a day get the free
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:45.520]  podcast get it share with everybody we're gonna post a YouTube video of it
[1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:49.800]  share it with everyone because if this show can be a big success the system may
[1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:53.840]  start letting more of this on the air as the internet culture takes over the
[1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:58.640]  mainstream media we can beat the globalist if they can't beat us they're
[1:18:58.640 --> 1:19:02.680]  going to try to join us and we could slow down this whole system that's what
[1:19:02.680 --> 1:19:06.760]  Tweety Bird always said if you can't beat them join them well well well if we

[1:24:00.600 --> 1:24:04.640]  no-fly list you won't be able to buy a gun so you're not convicted of a felony
[1:24:04.640 --> 1:24:07.680]  or a misdemeanor or a parking ticket governor but then you lose your rights
[1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:12.960]  isn't that 180 degrees the opposite from our republic form of government I
[1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:17.880]  would like to think so and and you know as I said earlier Alex it's just the
[1:24:17.880 --> 1:24:21.920]  case of you know the big brother and in this case it was dealing with the
[1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:25.760]  Bilderbergs that we have this particular guy we were going to interview and he
[1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:30.360]  was coming from a foreign country to here and he was on the no-fly list over
[1:24:30.360 --> 1:24:36.040]  there and to my knowledge he's not a terrorist so you know it's interesting
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:40.320]  how they'll disrupt people's lives by putting them on this no-fly list if
[1:24:40.320 --> 1:24:45.080]  you simply out of a say a different political persuasion or whatever it
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:49.480]  might be well governor you've got to get to a meeting in downtown Minneapolis so
[1:24:49.480 --> 1:24:53.200]  we've only got four more minutes left with you let's take two final calls
[1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:56.960]  quickly Gary in Washington than mark in Minnesota Gary or on the air with
[1:24:56.960 --> 1:25:01.640]  Jesse Ventura better to be here with you I have a very important piece of
[1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:06.080]  information for the governor and I have a big question for both of you first
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:12.240]  piece of information shake maps shake maps is a product of US Geological
[1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:17.240]  Survey earthquake hazards program if you look at the shape shake map in say
[1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:21.560]  Schwann when the earthquake happened with a rainbow over China on May 20th
[1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:29.280]  2008 the shake map is the exact same shape as the harp weapon that's point
[1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:33.240]  number one and then that we'll get the point number two okay what's your final
[1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:37.320]  point is we got to go here in a minute okay so check out the shake maps final
[1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:42.320]  point there's too much fragmentation on the info war present planet birthers
[1:25:42.320 --> 1:25:47.600]  oathkeepers 9-11 truth odd at the Fed LP gun owners skywatch I would recommend
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:53.720]  both of you join and help create a constitutional defense fund Alex and
[1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:58.040]  sir we can't do it all hold on a minute and people act like Jesse Ventura Alex
[1:25:58.040 --> 1:26:02.760]  Jones or Ron Paul have magical powers we put our let our pants on one leg at a
[1:26:02.760 --> 1:26:08.120]  time to freedom is fractured it's good that we're not all unified because that
[1:26:08.120 --> 1:26:12.320]  makes us hard to stop governor your comment on that well and the other thing
[1:26:12.320 --> 1:26:16.800]  is to is that how do you do it it's like when I was the third party candidate
[1:26:16.800 --> 1:26:21.120]  Minnesota I tried to bring all the third parties together so we could
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:25.720]  consolidate become a force against the other two parties I got news for you
[1:26:25.720 --> 1:26:30.840]  it's like hurting cats in fighting and I couldn't even bring them together on an
[1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:35.600]  issue that we all agreed upon and that was campaign finance none of us none of
[1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:41.160]  us took dirty money and it just fractured like nothing and so I just threw my
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:45.160]  hands up in the air and I said it may be impossible the galaxy makes a great
[1:26:45.160 --> 1:26:49.240]  point that they can't stop us all if we're all coming at them from different
[1:26:49.240 --> 1:26:53.600]  directions yeah it's a spirit of liberty shrink government bring
[1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:57.920]  accountability final call for governor Jesse Ventura from his home state
[1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:02.640]  Minnesota mark you're on the air go ahead hi you can hear me yes I can go
[1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:07.040]  ahead hi mark hi hi I bought it for you Jesse I appreciate both you guys's work
[1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:11.440]  and quickly a couple questions about I can't wait for your show to come out on
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:15.080]  I look forward to watching that and I'll tell people about it my friends and
[1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:20.680]  whatnot couple ideas for the show maybe you could look into the patent issue or
[1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:25.520]  people with individuals developing free energy and then a anti gravity
[1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:30.320]  technology that the government then beams it a national security risk you
[1:27:30.320 --> 1:27:33.720]  know Jesse that's a great idea if it gets picked up for another season is
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:38.080]  look at cold fusion we will take that under consideration but we got to get
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:41.880]  picked up first we only did seven for right now yeah we got across that bridge
[1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:45.480]  before we we have to come to that bridge before we cross it anything else
[1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:50.720]  mark yeah one last thing I just saw an article in the world that daily about
[1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:54.480]  that data centers being set up by that of saying homeland security department
[1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:57.960]  and I'm very concerned about that they collect all our information all
[1:27:57.960 --> 1:28:03.560]  communications and storage and this is another incremental loss of liberty watch
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:09.240]  my show on his big brother watching and all that and you'll learn how they get
[1:28:09.240 --> 1:28:13.400]  away with it and how they loop the Constitution to do it thank you so much
[1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:16.520]  mark okay we got a minute and a half left governor I'm gonna say bye to you
[1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:19.240]  when we go to break so just hold one moment but I wanted to say in closing
[1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:23.840]  it's been great working with you I hope the show airs looks like it is they
[1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:26.760]  started promoting it they're unleashing you to promote it so I think that's the
[1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:30.680]  green light but as you said we won't believe it airs until we see it go on
[1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:35.680]  December 2nd on true TV so spread the word but did you ever think because I
[1:28:35.680 --> 1:28:39.640]  know all about this stuff and I still can't believe it I'm still flabbergasted
[1:28:39.640 --> 1:28:44.520]  I am psychologically speechless a lot of times I could still babble some words
[1:28:44.520 --> 1:28:48.480]  out but it's hard to articulate the NSA says they're taking over the whole
[1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:52.840]  internet they may shut it down during crises like bird flu or swine flu the
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:28:57.760]  NSA is going to intercept all internet traffic they're building NSA centers in
[1:28:57.760 --> 1:29:02.520]  San Antonio and New York and Florida and Minnesota and California and just
[1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:06.320]  admitting they're reading everything we're doing so they go from we're not
[1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:10.840]  spying on al-Qaeda to we are spying on al-Qaeda to we're spying on you and we
[1:29:10.840 --> 1:29:15.000]  don't need no stinking warrants did you ever think that would happen well it
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:20.120]  will happen because yeah I can believe it happening Alex because of apathetic
[1:29:20.120 --> 1:29:25.160]  people out there people have to not be apathetic any longer you can't sit on
[1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:29.600]  your hands anymore you can't sit back and have government tell you they're
[1:29:29.600 --> 1:29:32.720]  going to protect you but in lieu of that protection you're going to give up
[1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:38.120]  your freedoms you are better off to be in danger from terrorists than you are

[1:33:09.400 --> 1:33:18.880]  well judge Napolitano is our guest today and I'm very very excited to have him
[1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:21.960]  on this is an abbreviated visit but we're gonna get him back on for a full
[1:33:21.960 --> 1:33:26.800]  30 minutes or maybe even an hour and he's of course from Newark New Jersey
[1:33:26.800 --> 1:33:31.080]  he's a tenured Superior Court judge in New Jersey and now an analyst on Fox
[1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:36.000]  News channel he has an extremely popular syndicated radio show and has
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:40.120]  Freedom Watch from Fox News Studios which is an internet television show and he
[1:33:40.120 --> 1:33:46.560]  also is the guest host for Glenn Beck I wish he was the the person doing that
[1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:51.160]  show because he is the real bona fide he wrote an editorial last week pointing
[1:33:51.160 --> 1:33:56.560]  out that the Republican health care plan was almost as bad as the Democrats and
[1:33:56.560 --> 1:34:03.040]  he is a constitutionalist right up there with Ron Paul and so he's somebody I
[1:34:03.040 --> 1:34:09.120]  actually agree with on like 98% of stuff instead of Glenn Beck 90% because that
[1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:14.520]  10% is a big area and so here for about 15 minutes to talk about health care the
[1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:18.920]  big government takeover of health care extra judicial these boards decide what
[1:34:18.920 --> 1:34:23.800]  to do and to talk about the cap and trade which I believe has a good chance of
[1:34:23.800 --> 1:34:29.400]  passing the Senate both of these are now in orbit like ICBM space stations
[1:34:29.400 --> 1:34:34.800]  about to drop nukes on our Republic and Judge Andrew Napolitano is there
[1:34:34.800 --> 1:34:39.160]  fighting it valiantly judge it's great to have you with us well thank you Alex
[1:34:39.160 --> 1:34:44.440]  it's good to be home with you there's so much happening what's more important
[1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:48.240]  cap and trade and the total micromanagement of our life by special
[1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:51.720]  interest with Al Gore set to make the money or the government takeover of
[1:34:51.720 --> 1:34:56.200]  health care oh boy that's that's really a pick your poison Alex it's all it's all
[1:34:56.200 --> 1:35:01.320]  part of the same big government mentality your kind comments about the
[1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:05.600]  piece I wrote was really from the monologue that I gave while filling in
[1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:09.720]  for Glenn Beck which I'm also doing later today at 5 o'clock Eastern by the way
[1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:15.000]  on Fox News channel in which I argued that we don't have a two-party system in
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:18.440]  this country we have a one-party one political party called the big
[1:35:18.440 --> 1:35:25.120]  government party the Republican branch likes war and deficits and assaulting
[1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:30.480]  our civil liberties and the Democratic branch likes wealth transfers and taxes
[1:35:30.480 --> 1:35:35.680]  and assaulting our commercial liberties but the mindset is the same with the
[1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:39.400]  heck with the Constitution the heck with the Bill of Rights the heck with
[1:35:39.400 --> 1:35:43.640]  inalienable rights the heck with even the laws that we write we know what's
[1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:48.200]  better for you than what you know is good for yourself and we will tell you
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:54.040]  how to obey or else cap and trade is one manifestation of that
[1:35:54.040 --> 1:36:01.240]  Obamacare is another manifestation of it I was furious last week when I saw that
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:06.680]  even the Republicans even so-called conservative Republicans not Ron Paul
[1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:12.320]  but many in the Republican leadership in the House introduced Obamacare life
[1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:17.880]  which basically presumes a federal role in health care of which there is none
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:23.600]  under the Constitution tells insurance carriers you can't refuse to cover
[1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:27.440]  people because of pre-existing entries that's a very nice thing but there's no
[1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:31.800]  power for the Congress to mandate it that's got to come about by the by the
[1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:36.080]  free market bribes the states to change their court system so they would
[1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:40.000]  basically go to the state of New Jersey and say we'll repave the garden state
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:45.160]  Parkway and the New Jersey turnpike if you put caps on the limits that juries
[1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:51.120]  can award injuries against doctors and medical malpractice lawsuits if you and
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:54.640]  I went to a state and said I'll give you money if you change our laws we'd be
[1:36:54.640 --> 1:37:01.600]  arrested for bribery so this was all the same mindset of we in Washington can
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:08.600]  micromanage the private free choices of individuals back home and I condemned it
[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:16.040]  and I do so again today judge Andrew Napolitano is our guest today judge what
[1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:19.640]  you're talking about and reading over the legislation it's like Groundhog Day
[1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:27.200]  but on a bigger scale it's Chicago or New York big city crime boss a machine
[1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:32.120]  doling everything out it's like with the takeover of General Motors it even
[1:37:32.120 --> 1:37:35.960]  came out in congressional investigations as you know because you covered it that
[1:37:35.960 --> 1:37:41.960]  people that gave money to Obama cronies or to the Democratic Party they got to
[1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:46.120]  keep their dealership and got to keep their client list but if you didn't if
[1:37:46.120 --> 1:37:50.680]  you'd ever gone against them or hadn't paid the protection money you lost your
[1:37:50.680 --> 1:37:54.680]  dealership even though some of the dealerships were over 80 years old and
[1:37:54.680 --> 1:37:58.840]  made millions of dollars a year and so now you have this 10th Amendment
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:05.800]  destroying federal power coming in with these unelected panels and it just goes
[1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:11.920]  on and on and on and on and I fear it can pass the Senate I'm hearing some of
[1:38:11.920 --> 1:38:15.320]  the Republican leadership saying oh no it won't they said it wouldn't pass the
[1:38:15.320 --> 1:38:19.080]  House in the last two weeks well they did say it wouldn't pass the House and it
[1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:24.320]  did pass by by a two-vote margin and you know you really can't tell what
[1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:28.760]  politicians because they'll they'll the leadership will bribe them remember the
[1:38:28.760 --> 1:38:34.040]  first time tarp the so-called troubled asset relief program went through the
[1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:39.320]  house it was defeated I remember I was on the Fox Business Network at the moment
[1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:47.520]  to fist in air just emoting joy shouting the beast is dead but I was
[1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:52.200]  naive because the leadership came back and brought by you know we'll build a
[1:38:52.200 --> 1:38:55.040]  courthouse in your district your friend wants to become a federal judge he's
[1:38:55.040 --> 1:38:59.200]  got it just vote for us on tarp eventually people change their vote I
[1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:02.840]  fear that the same thing will happen with respect to Obamacare the
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:07.320]  government the executive branch the leadership in both parties in both
[1:39:07.320 --> 1:39:13.720]  houses will bribe those who are wavering and give them something else that they
[1:39:13.720 --> 1:39:18.680]  want in order to secure their vote but you also raise a very important issue
[1:39:18.680 --> 1:39:26.640]  about the delegation of federal power to non-elected groups this is what FDR did
[1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:34.680]  and FDR is the model for President Barack Obama FDR had over 500 groups
[1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:40.360]  throughout the country appointed by local politicians who decided what prices
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:45.360]  and wages were there's a famous case in my home state of New Jersey where an
[1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:51.720]  Eastern European immigrant opened up a dry cleaning shop and the local wage and
[1:39:51.720 --> 1:39:57.360]  price group declared that you would charge 40 cents to clean and press a
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:05.120]  man's suit this guy charged 35 cents literally a nickel cheaper than what
[1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:10.680]  the unelected local board said he could charge he was arrested by the FBI he was
[1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:15.640]  indicted by a grand jury he was put on trial in federal court in Newark and he
[1:40:15.640 --> 1:40:20.520]  served a three-month prison term in a federal prison for charging five cents
[1:40:20.520 --> 1:40:26.880]  less than what the local board allowed him to now transform that into modern day
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:32.200]  practice of medicine you will have a board of bureaucrats not even physicians
[1:40:32.200 --> 1:40:37.480]  bureaucrats that will be between you and your physician you will lose your
[1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:42.280]  privacy you will lose the freedom of choice because the bureaucratic board
[1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:47.880]  will give your physician a list of diagnostic tools that she or he can use
[1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:53.360]  to address your ailment and then a list of procedures and medicines that she or
[1:40:53.360 --> 1:40:57.760]  he can prescribe and that's all in there and that's why they're saying they're
[1:40:57.760 --> 1:41:00.840]  gonna get all these hundreds of billions out of Medicare and Medicaid by
[1:41:00.840 --> 1:41:05.280]  reducing the care Tom Daschle wrote a book admitting if you're old you don't
[1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:09.880]  deserve it you don't need it people are really about to find out who these
[1:41:09.880 --> 1:41:14.800]  eugenicists are who these control freaks are that inhabit the Democratic Party and
[1:41:14.800 --> 1:41:18.280]  to some extent the Republican Party in the five minutes we've got left with
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:23.560]  Judge Andrew Napolitano joining us today in a very busy schedule I want to
[1:41:23.560 --> 1:41:29.760]  shift gears now to war you talk about the Republicans won endless war and the
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:35.080]  Democrats won a nanny state you together to death but look at Obama he's
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:39.440]  increased troops before in Afghanistan he's now saying he's gonna send 40,000
[1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:44.040]  more in that we're never going to leave there's over 300,000 international and
[1:41:44.040 --> 1:41:48.480]  Afghan troops there now I see absolutely no difference between the
[1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:54.120]  parties just different rhetoric I must reluctantly agree with you I say
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:59.840]  reluctantly not because I don't like to agree with you I I do but because I was
[1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:04.040]  naively expecting that we would not see this kind of buildup under him that we
[1:42:04.040 --> 1:42:07.600]  saw under George W. Bush but think about it war is the health of the state
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:12.040]  when when we fight a war people will look the other way when their taxes are
[1:42:12.040 --> 1:42:15.560]  raised and when the government takes away their freedom because they accept
[1:42:15.560 --> 1:42:19.600]  the illusion that by fighting the war the government is somehow keeping them
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:25.320]  safe presidents love war because it lets them escape the confines of the
[1:42:25.320 --> 1:42:29.680]  Constitution it lets them become a little bit of a prince it even causes
[1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:34.320]  judges sometimes if the president does something under the guise of war making
[1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:38.840]  to look the other way and defer to the executive branch fortunately the
[1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:42.680]  Supreme Court did not do that under Bush years under the Bush years that
[1:42:42.680 --> 1:42:48.560]  every single time his war making powers were challenged in the courts and made
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:53.960]  its way to the Supreme Court the United States he was zero and six before a
[1:42:53.960 --> 1:42:58.160]  Supreme Court that was appointed largely by Republicans judge were you
[1:42:58.160 --> 1:43:02.960]  surprised rely on the Supreme Court to save us because their life sure and you
[1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:06.720]  don't know which way they're gonna go and because it takes too long for the
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:10.920]  issue to get to them and too much harm can happen between time the time
[1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:14.760]  presidents wage war and the time their war powers are challenged in the courts
[1:43:14.760 --> 1:43:19.160]  were you surprised that Obama flip-flops so strongly and went from being
[1:43:19.160 --> 1:43:24.000]  anti-patriot act to zealously defending it wanting to expand it and complete
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:28.680]  warrantless wiretapping complete secret arrest complete I mean I mean he's
[1:43:28.680 --> 1:43:32.160]  going further than Bush on the police state I didn't think that was possible
[1:43:32.160 --> 1:43:36.560]  I didn't think it was possible either and I was absolutely crushed when I heard
[1:43:36.560 --> 1:43:41.320]  it he obviously was not my candidate of choice but I took a little bit of
[1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:46.520]  internal intellectual solace in the fact that at least we were getting a
[1:43:46.520 --> 1:43:51.400]  president who would respect the Constitution how wrong I was his
[1:43:51.400 --> 1:43:57.360]  disrespect for the Constitution may not be couched in as harsh and obvious and
[1:43:57.360 --> 1:44:03.200]  over terms as in the Bush years but it's just as bad just as destructive and
[1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:09.360]  just as willing to overlook specific restraints written in the Constitution to
[1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:13.840]  restrain the president as were many of his predecessors well I've talked to a
[1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:18.120]  lot of what will accept it exactly I've talked to a lot of lawyers and judges
[1:44:18.120 --> 1:44:22.160]  and I wanted to briefly see if you agree even though a lot of conservatives
[1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:25.600]  didn't like Obama true paleo conservatives libertarian types like
[1:44:25.600 --> 1:44:29.840]  Ron Paul and yourself because he is a constitutional lawyer and practice it
[1:44:29.840 --> 1:44:35.000]  for ten years as a professor people expected that Obama would try to at
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:39.840]  least on the surface restore some of the Bill of Rights but instead you know he's
[1:44:39.840 --> 1:44:46.400]  saying Constitution it's just a gd piece of paper I I too expected that he would
[1:44:46.400 --> 1:44:50.280]  show more respect for the Constitution I read some of the lectures he gave at the
[1:44:50.280 --> 1:44:54.080]  University of Chicago Law School I could have given some of those lectures
[1:44:54.080 --> 1:44:58.360]  myself when I taught constitutional law at Seton Hall Law School in Newark and
[1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:03.040]  Delaware Law School in Wilmington Delaware but you know something happens
[1:45:03.040 --> 1:45:08.200]  when you don the mantle of power and that's something is a disdain for the
[1:45:08.200 --> 1:45:12.680]  restraint on your power a disdain for the natural law our respect that we have
[1:45:12.680 --> 1:45:16.480]  natural rights beyond which no government can go a disdain for the
[1:45:16.480 --> 1:45:20.560]  Constitution itself and disdain for our inalienable rights same as natural
[1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:26.000]  rights and a disdain for the Bill of Rights they just simply don't care they
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  will steal from the rich to give to the poor to create a class of people
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:36.400]  dependent upon them who will continue to vote them in office so they can continue
[1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:40.280]  to be taken care of cradle to grave by a federal government that doesn't have one
[1:45:40.280 --> 1:45:45.520]  iota of constitutional authority to do all of this well said final question I'm
[1:45:45.520 --> 1:45:48.480]  gonna let you go because I know you've got to fill in guest hose for Glenn Beck
[1:45:48.480 --> 1:45:52.320]  tonight congratulations on your huge success as your star rises because
[1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:56.000]  you're the bonafide constitutionalist we really really appreciate you judge
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:03.720]  Andrew Napolitano but in closing I would like to get you to comment a on
[1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:08.400]  just how special George Washington and Andrew Jackson were they got all this
[1:46:08.400 --> 1:46:11.960]  power and then did give it up they wanted George Washington to be a king
[1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:15.960]  you know these were amazing founding fathers we had and what would they think
[1:46:15.960 --> 1:46:21.280]  of what's happening today where no satellite information service the
[1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:28.680]  federal government admits the coldest winner so far in the last 50 years the
[1:46:28.680 --> 1:46:33.600]  the the the third coldest in the last hundred meanwhile they're openly
[1:46:33.600 --> 1:46:37.280]  announcing there that they're gonna list carbon dioxide as a toxic waste and
[1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:41.520]  tax it when humans exhale it can you can you end with speaking about our
[1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:46.040]  founders compared to the material we've gotten Washington today and what they
[1:46:46.040 --> 1:46:52.400]  would think of taxing what plants breathe the founders tried to do two
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:57.280]  things with the Constitution one was to create a federal government strong
[1:46:57.280 --> 1:47:01.160]  enough to protect us from invasion and to do national type things like run a
[1:47:01.160 --> 1:47:05.240]  post office and make sure that there is trade between the states the other was
[1:47:05.240 --> 1:47:08.400]  to restrain the federal government so that it wouldn't interfere with our
[1:47:08.400 --> 1:47:13.040]  personal liberties they specifically gave us a Constitution that kept the
[1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:17.760]  federal government away from any type of relationship with individuals because
[1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:23.040]  they knew that the greatest threat to freedom comes not from your enemy on
[1:47:23.040 --> 1:47:28.040]  the outside who you can see and look at but from the smiling face of the
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:32.840]  government on the inside who cleans but it's going to take care of you and
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:37.520]  presidents like George Washington whose closest advisor Alexander Hamilton
[1:47:37.520 --> 1:47:41.760]  wanted him to be king and Andrew Jackson who basically said to the
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:46.280]  Supreme Court you know they've gone ahead and made their their federal bank
[1:47:46.280 --> 1:47:50.560]  let them find the money and put them on the deposits in the federal bank these
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:55.360]  were people who understood that there were natural limits on what government
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:59.920]  can do and written limits on what the federal government can do and they stuck
[1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:05.400]  to those limits the present government and its predecessors you know from
[1:48:05.400 --> 1:48:11.640]  Lincoln to Wilson to FDR to George W Bush to Barack Obama has so distorted out
[1:48:11.640 --> 1:48:15.480]  of proportion what the federal government is to do that the founders would
[1:48:15.480 --> 1:48:19.800]  would not recognize it at all and would probably want to take up arms against it
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:23.040]  what are you covering tonight and then we'll let you go I hope you're gonna be
[1:48:23.040 --> 1:48:26.680]  covering the health care and cap and trade because what we're talking about
[1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:30.400]  we're talking about health care we're talking about the the state of the
[1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:35.760]  economy we're talking about the government subpoenaing media entities
[1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:42.680]  wanting to know who earns how much money because they have to decide whose
[1:48:42.680 --> 1:48:48.560]  income taxes to audit next you're kidding wait a minute they're not just the
[1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:53.400]  federal government is subpoenaing media people to their subpoenaing media
[1:48:53.400 --> 1:48:57.760]  companies to find out who earns what and what their social security numbers are
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:04.040]  this is getting so bad so quickly far worse than any of us imagined and the
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:09.240]  president hasn't even celebrated his first year in office yet since you brought
[1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:12.720]  that up about tonight since you brought that up let me just ask you now
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:16.640]  senator Lamar Alexander has gone to the floor and talked about he's confirmed
[1:49:16.640 --> 1:49:21.640]  there's an enemy's list he warned him and said look I worked for Nixon don't do
[1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:27.240]  this it's been reported I am on the enemy's list I'm going from memory I
[1:49:27.240 --> 1:49:33.680]  think you are too but what is it I mean this is crazy it is scary to to know
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:38.280]  that there's a real enemies list and this is I mean is this not illegal judge
[1:49:38.280 --> 1:49:44.200]  well it's illegal for the president to to compile a list of people who disagree
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:47.560]  with them on the basis of their political opinions and their outspoken
[1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:53.600]  words that was specifically written into the privacy law in 1974 enacted and
[1:49:53.600 --> 1:49:58.200]  signed into law by president Ford shortly after president Nixon resigned
[1:49:58.200 --> 1:50:03.680]  these are restraints is expressly enacted to restrain the president but this
[1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:07.560]  White House just like it doesn't respect freedom of contract just like it
[1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:11.800]  doesn't respect freedom of speech just like it doesn't respect privacy doesn't
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:16.800]  respect this either well I tell you it's scary and everybody should pray for the
[1:50:16.800 --> 1:50:21.120]  people that are on that list myself included judge what's the best website

[1:54:23.320 --> 1:54:34.360]  master falls for carbon taxes and New World Order on PBS that is coming up
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:38.800]  later in the broadcast today General Stubblebinds joining us along with this
[1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:45.080]  medical doctor wife Dr. Ray Malabo going to be extremely informative
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:51.760]  judge Andrew Napolitano is anti-war anti-patriot act anti-New World Order
[1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:59.880]  anti-carbon tax he's almost as good as Ron Paul on the issues and Fox uses him
[1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:04.920]  like you use a little cayenne pepper and chili they just throw a little bit of it
[1:55:04.920 --> 1:55:09.440]  in there and I like the fact that he's on more and more and I've talked to him
[1:55:09.440 --> 1:55:15.560]  off air talk to him privately read his columns for years he's a good guy I don't
[1:55:15.560 --> 1:55:19.000]  like coming out and attacking Beck because I know he's fooled a lot of people
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:23.440]  and it turns folks off but I have to tell the truth and if Beck will stop
[1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:30.320]  stabbing us in the back and stop going sideways on issues I'll supporting the
[1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:36.000]  issue here is the owner Rupert Murdoch admits that he's supporting the global
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:40.720]  carbon tax and is invested in it and has all of his movies and dramas and
[1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:46.880]  non-fox news shows promoting it we've that call Paul Watson because I couldn't
[1:55:46.880 --> 1:55:51.680]  find it this morning he wrote an article about it two years ago it it it has the
[1:55:51.680 --> 1:55:56.360]  Rupert Murdoch bragging look at how I'm propagandizing I'm proud of myself
[1:55:56.360 --> 1:56:01.960]  it's the montage of Fox TV programs that Fox put out where they're promoting the
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:07.040]  global tax you see you you you won't hear Napolitano or these guys talk about
[1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:12.160]  that look I'm not stupid and I'm not gonna get into details but I could
[1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:18.320]  certainly go if I played my cards right go join team Fox ladies and gentlemen I
[1:56:18.320 --> 1:56:22.480]  wasn't ever offered a job by them but I was offered job by people affiliated with
[1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:30.080]  them years ago I told him no way okay I'm gonna fight the new world order but I
[1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:36.440]  think we should recognize that Fox is beginning to be forced because the
[1:56:36.440 --> 1:56:41.280]  audience has gone there to speak out against world government because all
[1:56:41.280 --> 1:56:45.960]  these years Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage and all these guys said there's
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:50.560]  no new world order Glenn Beck said there was no new world order now it's openly
[1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:53.320]  being announced toward a world government by the people that are pro
[1:56:53.320 --> 1:56:59.680]  world government and so they look pretty stupid and so they've got to bring
[1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:06.360]  somebody along like Andrew Napolitano who's been good the entire time to not
[1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:10.840]  just keep their audience but grow Fox is growing their audience while CNN
[1:57:10.840 --> 1:57:16.800]  CNBC all the rest of them are imploding and that's because Fox isn't stupid they
[1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:24.880]  are going anti-new world order at least to a certain degree well we're going all
[1:57:24.880 --> 1:57:29.320]  the way anti-new world order and we always have and that's who we are but I
[1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:32.440]  get emails going well why are you having Judge Andrew Napolitano on he's on
[1:57:32.440 --> 1:57:37.240]  with Fox he's telling the truth when he's on Fox we need to support people

[2:02:41.080 --> 2:02:49.160]  streets of America and when Aaron and crew were in Louisiana doing interviews
[2:02:49.160 --> 2:02:54.360]  for the new film last week they ran into City Year with camouflage on their
[2:02:54.360 --> 2:02:59.720]  faces no you cannot make this stuff up and and and we're just drowning in
[2:02:59.720 --> 2:03:03.400]  evidence we've got so much evidence coming in piling up of the slow
[2:03:03.400 --> 2:03:06.840]  incremental paramilitary takeover of the country that I don't even know where to
[2:03:06.840 --> 2:03:10.720]  start it's just mind-blowing what were the troops with their machine guns

[2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:41.880]  you had worked with in the same type of people discussing and I look at the
[2:03:41.880 --> 2:03:47.640]  population for example the Yankees World Series the Yankees fan one where I see
[2:03:47.640 --> 2:03:50.920]  these people doing their chairing in the streets they care more about the fact
[2:03:50.920 --> 2:03:54.360]  that they have Philly fans out there they're willing to go out and fight in
[2:03:54.360 --> 2:03:58.120]  the streets I have video footage where fans are fighting each other they have
[2:03:58.120 --> 2:04:02.480]  more passion to fight each other over a baseball game than Goldman Sachs robbing
[2:04:02.480 --> 2:04:07.840]  the country for 23.7 trillion dollars in broad daylight I guess we're gonna start
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:11.420]  telling these are fans of that Goldman Sachs or bunch of Phillies or our Red
[2:04:11.420 --> 2:04:15.480]  Sox fans and maybe these Yankee fans will start waking up that's a good idea
[2:04:15.480 --> 2:04:19.240]  tell New Yorkers that Goldman Sachs is the Red Sox and Goldman Sachs will all
[2:04:19.240 --> 2:04:25.080]  be arrested next week no I mean that's a great point you make that people will go
[2:04:25.080 --> 2:04:28.320]  out and riot and kill each other over a football or baseball or basketball game
[2:04:28.320 --> 2:04:31.840]  or you know when the Bulls used to win in Chicago they'd burn half the town
[2:04:31.840 --> 2:04:35.160]  oh but so what if foreign banks are openly killing the dollar and destroying
[2:04:35.160 --> 2:04:40.160]  our children's future that's wonderful all right ladies and gentlemen we'll be

[2:10:11.760 --> 2:10:15.840]  Statue of Liberty plunging down to its destruction with Obama down here at

[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:48.280]  Griffin G. Edward I've got so many questions so many things I want to go
[2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:53.560]  over with you today but the first thing I want to ask you is 49 years fighting
[2:10:53.560 --> 2:11:00.200]  this publishing best-selling books really the name over the last half
[2:11:00.200 --> 2:11:05.360]  century you know you're the person that people point out and say he's he's the
[2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:09.600]  icon even if some of the old-timers were still alive you would still be bigger
[2:11:09.600 --> 2:11:13.920]  than they are and I'm not saying that for ego I'm pointing out you have been a a
[2:11:13.920 --> 2:11:18.160]  prime mover a central force against the globalist and with the long view of
[2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:22.600]  history if we wouldn't have had you and others 50 years ago fighting and
[2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:26.240]  planting seeds and getting laughed at we wouldn't be having this giant
[2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:30.720]  awakening that's blooming today that is really threatening the globalist and
[2:11:30.720 --> 2:11:33.640]  they admit in their own documents that you know that they could lose control
[2:11:33.640 --> 2:11:37.240]  that's why they're trying to bum rush us right now and bring in the entire
[2:11:37.240 --> 2:11:40.520]  program and accelerate it so people need to understand it's not going to be an
[2:11:40.520 --> 2:11:43.760]  instant victory and we'll talk about your long view of history and how we
[2:11:43.760 --> 2:11:48.680]  can beat these people coming up but first what is it like to see them openly
[2:11:48.680 --> 2:11:51.740]  announcing the world government openly announcing the carbon tax openly
[2:11:51.740 --> 2:11:56.200]  announcing it's going to be the IMF as the world rulers we will pay our taxes
[2:11:56.200 --> 2:12:01.880]  to private bankers to Al Gore everything you wrote about 20 30 40 years ago
[2:12:01.880 --> 2:12:06.320]  because you're reading their own documents to now see it actually taking
[2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:10.320]  place the republic is falling the dollar is falling world government is
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:15.480]  rising break that down get into the health care takeover the collectivist the
[2:12:15.480 --> 2:12:20.200]  carbon tax what we're witnessing and with your long view of history how you
[2:12:20.200 --> 2:12:26.240]  think this fight is going to unfold G. Edward Griffin well that's quite quite
[2:12:26.240 --> 2:12:31.040]  an interesting perspective wrapped up in a question there I have to answer your
[2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:36.040]  question with a single word it feels eerie it's like having a bad nightmare
[2:12:36.040 --> 2:12:39.440]  and you wake up and you say oh that was just a nightmare
[2:12:39.440 --> 2:12:42.920]  oh come on get it out of your mind it's just a nightmare repeat after me it's
[2:12:42.920 --> 2:12:46.960]  just a nightmare and then all of a sudden the events in the nightmare start to
[2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:51.440]  unfold before your eyes and you go back you say oh no it's not a nightmare this
[2:12:51.440 --> 2:12:56.200]  is reality and it is that kind of an eerie feeling you could probably write
[2:12:56.200 --> 2:13:01.160]  a good good movie around that theme of a nightmare that becomes reality but
[2:13:01.160 --> 2:13:04.360]  that's really how I feel about it you know when you when you read the
[2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:08.760]  documents of the the elitists of the world and you know exactly what they
[2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:13.920]  plan and how they think it is sort of an academic experience in the beginning
[2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:18.760]  because you're still living in a system of a lot of freedom and and quite a bit
[2:13:18.760 --> 2:13:23.880]  of security and prosperity and so what you're saying even though you know it's
[2:13:23.880 --> 2:13:29.400]  true has this unreal like quality thinking well am I right are they really
[2:13:29.400 --> 2:13:33.160]  going to pull that off and then you look around and say yep yep they're moving on
[2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:37.080]  it so then you go back and you get serious again but there's a long period
[2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:40.760]  in the beginning Alex when I have to tell you it just didn't seem quite real
[2:13:40.760 --> 2:13:45.320]  even though I knew it was so here we are all these years later and now of course
[2:13:45.320 --> 2:13:49.840]  there's no question that these scenarios that we put together not our
[2:13:49.840 --> 2:13:54.440]  scenarios it was their scenario actually that it was quite real and we're we're
[2:13:54.440 --> 2:14:00.080]  living through it now and it's it's kind of like I use another analogy it's like
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:06.240]  you're drifting along in a in a small row boat or a canoe and the water is kind
[2:14:06.240 --> 2:14:10.760]  of quiet and calm and the birds are singing it's a beautiful sunny day in
[2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:16.080]  that and there's the water is very calm and you're moving and enjoying watching
[2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:19.480]  the fish jump and all that sort of thing but you know you know because you've
[2:14:19.480 --> 2:14:24.360]  looked at the map you know that you're in a river that's headed toward a huge
[2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:30.720]  waterfall and you have a pretty good idea that it's down there maybe a couple
[2:14:30.720 --> 2:14:33.920]  of days away so you know you're not worried about it now but you know you've
[2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:38.040]  got to get out of that stream of water pretty soon and so you're drifting
[2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:42.200]  along and everything is fine but the closer you get to that waterfall the
[2:14:42.200 --> 2:14:47.080]  more rapid the water seems to move and now did we find ourselves with this
[2:14:47.080 --> 2:14:52.600]  little row boat moving quite rapidly and you can hear the sound the roar of the
[2:14:52.600 --> 2:14:57.000]  water you can't see it yet but you could hear it so that it is that's another
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:00.280]  way of looking at it I'm trying to give you the emotional experience that I have
[2:15:00.280 --> 2:15:05.240]  it's a it's a very unnerving thing well that's I mean that is a perfect way to
[2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:10.880]  describe it and we've now rounded the band and we see the mist and steam rising
[2:15:10.880 --> 2:15:16.800]  up from Niagara and I believe we can now actually see the waterfall I mean
[2:15:16.800 --> 2:15:20.280]  they're openly announcing world government they're openly announcing
[2:15:20.280 --> 2:15:26.960]  carbon taxes micromanaging our lives one child policies times of London comes
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:33.760]  out and says billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation secret meetings we
[2:15:33.760 --> 2:15:38.240]  know that this is a hellish system and just like people could hear the water
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:45.560]  fall in 1917 Russia or they could hear the waterfall in 1935 Germany as bad as
[2:15:45.560 --> 2:15:49.580]  it already is we know it's going to get a lot lot worse and as you said as we
[2:15:49.580 --> 2:15:54.800]  near the fall the water gets faster and faster and faster and the globalist
[2:15:54.800 --> 2:15:59.040]  were denying they were blaring on loudspeakers from the woods on the sides
[2:15:59.040 --> 2:16:03.320]  of the river for decades that there is no waterfall everything's fine go to
[2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:08.960]  sleep in the rowboat relax drink a beer watch a ball game and now as we see the
[2:16:08.960 --> 2:16:13.440]  waterfall and see broken ships at the bottom from history and and and tyranny
[2:16:13.440 --> 2:16:17.800]  past and mass murder past and we see all the ghosts of those killed by tyranny
[2:16:17.800 --> 2:16:22.720]  they're now saying oh it is a waterfall but you're only safe by going over the
[2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:25.600]  edge global government is the solution
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:29.800]  G. Edward Griffin well I think you said it so well as usual Alex yeah they're
[2:16:29.800 --> 2:16:34.240]  saying look if you stay where you are you're gonna be dashed against a rock so
[2:16:34.240 --> 2:16:38.080]  therefore go over the waterfall come with us we will lead you over the
[2:16:38.080 --> 2:16:43.080]  waterfall there's a nice big lake down there it'll be all calm again you know
[2:16:43.080 --> 2:16:48.720]  it the beginning of the video that you produce that magnificent video the
[2:16:48.720 --> 2:16:53.880]  fall of the republic you've got a speech by Obama in which he's talking about
[2:16:53.880 --> 2:16:58.720]  the need for change is kind of his campaign rhetoric but we're wrapped up
[2:16:58.720 --> 2:17:06.360]  in post presidential events that yes we we had no choice so we had to we can't
[2:17:06.360 --> 2:17:10.720]  look back I he was saying we we can't ignore it we can't pretend like it's
[2:17:10.720 --> 2:17:14.720]  not there we must deal with in all of those pletitudes and he's right in in
[2:17:14.720 --> 2:17:20.640]  that sense but then he says we cannot continue what we were doing but to any
[2:17:20.640 --> 2:17:25.760]  informed observer that's the biggest laugh of all because that is exactly what
[2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:30.080]  the present administration is doing they are continuing what they were doing
[2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:34.520]  except they're accelerating it somewhat so there's no change in direction it's
[2:17:34.520 --> 2:17:37.880]  always headed toward that waterfall and yes you're quite right they're saying
[2:17:37.880 --> 2:17:42.320]  you got to go over the waterfall because you can't stay where you are well that's
[2:17:42.320 --> 2:17:48.680]  not much of a choice is it no it's not and on both sides of us are the republic
[2:17:48.680 --> 2:17:54.560]  beautiful fields forest you know we could build our civilization back if we
[2:17:54.560 --> 2:17:58.880]  had the engine of liberty but instead they're saying oh no don't get out of
[2:17:58.880 --> 2:18:03.120]  the boat just just keep going over the waterfall everything is going to be fine
[2:18:03.120 --> 2:18:08.000]  but we know it's not going to be fine we know that's a thousand foot drop down
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:12.320]  to those rocks below we know that hundreds of other civilizations have
[2:18:12.320 --> 2:18:17.480]  gone over these falls haven't they oh yes they have and I guess it's time to
[2:18:17.480 --> 2:18:23.240]  abandon the analogy it because actually what the people who are calling the
[2:18:23.240 --> 2:18:29.120]  shots today they don't like the rowboat were in that rowboat provides way too
[2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:34.960]  much stability for people in them and they really want that rowboat destroyed
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:40.600]  that they want the people in the water they want the people clamoring for life
[2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:45.480]  rings or you know lifesavers that that the government would throw out to them
[2:18:45.480 --> 2:18:50.120]  because they want the people out of those boats and into the water and that's the
[2:18:50.120 --> 2:18:54.400]  reality because they're sharks the banks in their own documents want vertical
[2:18:54.400 --> 2:18:58.780]  integration as Maury Strong said they want to wreck the economy so we all go
[2:18:58.780 --> 2:19:04.120]  on collective as welfare so they can make call the shots on everything exactly
[2:19:04.120 --> 2:19:09.320]  their power freaks and that's how they get their jollies and that that's it
[2:19:09.320 --> 2:19:14.320]  it's the only trick they know they're collectivists they believe in that
[2:19:14.320 --> 2:19:19.400]  ideology of collectivism with all powerful government at the top and people
[2:19:19.400 --> 2:19:23.960]  the serving the state at the bottom and that's just fine with them because they
[2:19:23.960 --> 2:19:28.800]  they know that they're in the structure either at the top or far enough toward
[2:19:28.800 --> 2:19:34.640]  the top to to have a very comfortable life while the rest of us are servants
[2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:39.000]  so it's as simple as that and the trouble is with most Americans they can't
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:42.960]  imagine that there are people out there with that kind of a vision because it's
[2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:46.320]  not their vision they think there is no one that actually wants to rule the
[2:19:46.320 --> 2:19:51.240]  world but they're so wrong history shows that elites always want to rule the
[2:19:51.240 --> 2:19:55.640]  world they always dominate they always enslave but somehow the psychological
[2:19:55.640 --> 2:19:59.840]  idea got implanted that corruption doesn't exist in government

[2:24:41.880 --> 2:24:44.920]  gonna break down what's happening currently but G. Edward in this brief
[2:24:44.920 --> 2:24:48.560]  five-minute segment can you give people an overview of say Norman Dodd and the
[2:24:48.560 --> 2:24:53.880]  Reese committee the church committee Carol Quigley if the documents from the
[2:24:53.880 --> 2:24:57.960]  elite similar to more modern ones like eco science written by the White House
[2:24:57.960 --> 2:25:02.480]  Science are where they admit planetary government and then now Ban Ki-moon
[2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:06.640]  secretary general two weeks ago editorial in the New York Times titled we
[2:25:06.640 --> 2:25:12.040]  can do it saying global government is here and it's gonna be funded by carbon
[2:25:12.040 --> 2:25:16.360]  taxes we'll talk about that coming up but a few founding documents for people
[2:25:16.360 --> 2:25:20.520]  that want to do research yeah I think it's important to get this close to the
[2:25:20.520 --> 2:25:24.280]  roots of this is possible of course you can didn't go back practically to Adam
[2:25:24.280 --> 2:25:28.960]  and Eve if you want to but you don't need to go that far the one of the most
[2:25:28.960 --> 2:25:35.320]  eye-opening documents that I discovered early in my research Alex was the
[2:25:35.320 --> 2:25:40.960]  testimony of a fellow by the name of Norman Dodd Norman Dodd oh this was the
[2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:49.640]  1940s right after the end of World War two there was a lot of concern among a
[2:25:49.640 --> 2:25:54.400]  lot of Americans and particularly some newspaper editors the Hearst newspaper
[2:25:54.400 --> 2:26:01.760]  chain in particular was very concerned in writing editorials about the the tax
[2:26:01.760 --> 2:26:08.400]  exempt foundations in America obviously promoting what was in those days blatant
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:14.120]  communist propaganda I found that hard to believe when I read those
[2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:19.080]  editorials but I went to the documents themselves from the tax exempt
[2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:23.560]  foundations and lo and behold they were right that they were publishing essays
[2:26:23.560 --> 2:26:29.920]  written by a guess who Joseph Stalin praising the glories of communism and
[2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:36.120]  socialism and how the end of capitalism was the only way for the world to go and
[2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:40.560]  so forth this was stuff being distributed by some of the largest most
[2:26:40.560 --> 2:26:45.440]  prestigious American tax exempt foundations and it was just amazing
[2:26:45.440 --> 2:26:48.960]  because I got hard it was hard for me to believe that would happen but there was
[2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:53.240]  in the historical record and so the Hearst papers and others a lot of
[2:26:53.240 --> 2:26:57.360]  newspapers around the country were writing editorials exposing this and
[2:26:57.360 --> 2:27:01.800]  of course that triggered a lot of alarm on the part of the American people and
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:06.080]  they wanted their government people in those days like today still thought that
[2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:10.120]  their government you know represented them and so they wanted their government
[2:27:10.120 --> 2:27:15.400]  to investigate this not realizing that already even in those days our own
[2:27:15.400 --> 2:27:19.760]  government was being heavily influenced by tax exempt foundations and the
[2:27:19.760 --> 2:27:23.840]  financial interests that supported them but anyway the idea was that they wanted
[2:27:23.840 --> 2:27:28.800]  an investigation of these tax exempt foundations to see if they were in fact
[2:27:28.800 --> 2:27:33.200]  un-American is the word they used that they were advocating systems that
[2:27:33.200 --> 2:27:38.560]  required the destruction of the American way of life and a process using a
[2:27:38.560 --> 2:27:44.400]  process that was not constitutional I mean the American system is designed to
[2:27:44.400 --> 2:27:47.880]  be changed if necessary and if it's the will of the people but there's a
[2:27:47.880 --> 2:27:53.000]  constitutional path for that change and so they were concerned about groups
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:57.680]  such as the Communist Party in those days pursuing an unconstitutional path
[2:27:57.680 --> 2:28:03.440]  through the violent revolution and that sort of thing so there was a committee
[2:28:03.440 --> 2:28:10.360]  established in Congress headed by Congressman Carol Reese and I've forgotten
[2:28:10.360 --> 2:28:14.000]  the exact title of the committee that it's a long title but they just referred
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  to it as the Reese committee and its purpose was to investigate tax exempt
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:23.200]  foundations well that's just background what they hired a fellow by the name of
[2:28:23.200 --> 2:28:31.040]  Norman Dodd to be their chief investigator and Norman Dodd was he came
[2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:37.840]  from banking circles actually he had worked for some of the largest banks
[2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:41.440]  of New York he knew how the power structure worked and all of that and
[2:28:41.440 --> 2:28:47.880]  he was not very happy with it as a matter of fact it left banking and well we
[2:28:47.880 --> 2:28:50.920]  won't go through his career but eventually they did select him to be the
[2:28:50.920 --> 2:28:55.960]  chief investigator so now we finally get to the Norman Dodd testimony which I
[2:28:55.960 --> 2:29:02.840]  ran across oh I guess in the middle 1960s when I was researching a lot of the
[2:29:02.840 --> 2:29:07.240]  government documents put out by the House Committee on American activities
[2:29:07.240 --> 2:29:12.000]  and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and one of those obscure
[2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:17.480]  documents and believe me I had I had stacks of these things that probably if
[2:29:17.480 --> 2:29:21.200]  they were all put on top of each other would probably go eight feet to the
[2:29:21.200 --> 2:29:25.760]  ceiling of the house here and one of those obscure documents I ran across the
[2:29:25.760 --> 2:29:31.600]  testimony of Norman Dodd and it's almost knocked my socks off he was
[2:29:31.600 --> 2:29:36.080]  basically saying that when he investigated these tax exempt foundations he
[2:29:36.080 --> 2:29:42.840]  found out that there was nestled inside of them literally a cabal of people very
[2:29:42.840 --> 2:29:48.280]  powerful wealthy people who are trying to destroy America stay there we'll be

[2:31:02.920 --> 2:31:07.280]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[2:31:07.280 --> 2:31:11.440]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[2:31:11.440 --> 2:31:15.480]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[2:31:15.480 --> 2:31:19.360]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[2:31:19.360 --> 2:31:23.640]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:31:23.640 --> 2:31:27.800]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[2:31:27.800 --> 2:31:32.120]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[2:31:32.120 --> 2:31:35.800]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[2:31:35.800 --> 2:31:40.000]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[2:34:45.960 --> 2:34:49.560]  okay gee Edward you're getting into the Reese committee reading of the
[2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:52.400]  testimony of Norman Dodd this high-powered investigator hired by
[2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:56.880]  Congress you have the actual foundation documents that we know of as the
[2:34:56.880 --> 2:35:00.680]  Carnegie Foundation the Rockefeller Foundation later the Ford Foundation
[2:35:00.680 --> 2:35:03.840]  they're now quite public about all this and I want you to go through the
[2:35:03.840 --> 2:35:08.240]  testimony first and then into modern times but here's a microcosm example
[2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:14.960]  eco barons lead the way times of London today and it says the global rich are
[2:35:14.960 --> 2:35:19.960]  going green as never before the first Sunday Times green rich list shows that
[2:35:19.960 --> 2:35:23.520]  enthusiasm among the world's wealthiest for investments in areas as diverse as
[2:35:23.520 --> 2:35:27.320]  electric cars solar power and geothermal energy is unaffected by
[2:35:27.320 --> 2:35:31.560]  recession so they always say oh it's about better cars and you know things
[2:35:31.560 --> 2:35:34.800]  that sound reasonable but when you actually read the minutes of these
[2:35:34.800 --> 2:35:38.720]  meetings that have been covered by the media its population control how do we
[2:35:38.720 --> 2:35:42.840]  shut off the resources how do we destroy the industrial society how do we bring
[2:35:42.840 --> 2:35:47.640]  back a neo feudal type of serfdom to control everyone and here's another
[2:35:47.640 --> 2:35:52.200]  times of London billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation America's rich
[2:35:52.200 --> 2:35:56.040]  people richest people make to discuss ways of tackling disastrous
[2:35:56.040 --> 2:35:59.160]  environmental social and industrial threats and at the end of the article
[2:35:59.160 --> 2:36:05.880]  it says the Rockefeller Foundation put it on at Rockefeller University it was
[2:36:05.880 --> 2:36:09.960]  secret but they told the Times some of what happened and they said why all the
[2:36:09.960 --> 2:36:14.680]  secrecy they wanted to speak rich to rich without worrying anything they could
[2:36:14.680 --> 2:36:19.680]  and said would end up in the newspapers painting them as an alternative world
[2:36:19.680 --> 2:36:23.240]  government he said because this meeting went on a week before Bilderberg this
[2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:27.840]  year now you then see the Rockefeller Foundation as the nexus or the
[2:36:27.840 --> 2:36:30.720]  directorship and you're the expert on this I'm just telling the listeners about
[2:36:30.720 --> 2:36:36.200]  it of all the new carbon tax laws where they decide who can have a business where
[2:36:36.200 --> 2:36:40.680]  they decide what gets developed what governments find this is the private
[2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:46.120]  banking cartel through government power in a tyrannical fashion taking complete
[2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:51.920]  control over society please continue yes well boy there's so much on that and
[2:36:51.920 --> 2:36:57.400]  it all as you said earlier it goes back to the earliest beginnings of which I
[2:36:57.400 --> 2:37:02.760]  aware where they actually talked about these strategies was when the tax exempt
[2:37:02.760 --> 2:37:09.560]  foundations have amassed tremendous amounts of financial firepower they were
[2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:13.200]  talking about as you mentioned the Carnegie endowment fund for international
[2:37:13.200 --> 2:37:19.000]  peace Rockefeller Foundation fund the Ford Foundation people cannot imagine the
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:25.160]  tremendous amount of money that these tax exempt foundations have in their bank
[2:37:25.160 --> 2:37:31.400]  accounts and invested in producing in a constant flow of money and they they use
[2:37:31.400 --> 2:37:36.560]  it the general impression is that they use it for philanthropic purposes but
[2:37:36.560 --> 2:37:42.120]  now we're talking about Norman Dodd who started to investigate these organizations
[2:37:42.120 --> 2:37:46.920]  and found out that under the name of or the cover of philanthropy they were
[2:37:46.920 --> 2:37:51.680]  actually doing social engineering and they were doing a government change and
[2:37:51.680 --> 2:37:55.760]  that they were trying to change the actual the characteristic of the American
[2:37:55.760 --> 2:38:03.640]  society and it was quite astounding and when I read this testimony I just found
[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:10.440]  it almost almost impossible to believe and so I was traveling in those days
[2:38:10.440 --> 2:38:15.920]  back to Virginia and we had a hired a television crew and we were putting
[2:38:15.920 --> 2:38:21.200]  together a little documentary on some topic it wasn't this at all I've even
[2:38:21.200 --> 2:38:25.800]  forgotten the topic at the present time but I do know that we had a weekend
[2:38:25.800 --> 2:38:31.200]  where we had no appointments and no interviews and so I decided to see if I
[2:38:31.200 --> 2:38:36.040]  could locate Norman Dodd because I knew the last reference I had they said he
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:41.640]  lived in Virginia someplace and so I just opened up the telephone director
[2:38:41.640 --> 2:38:45.320]  and started to look through to see if I could find how many Norman Dodds there
[2:38:45.320 --> 2:38:51.280]  were there were only about three and so I decided to call the first one on the
[2:38:51.280 --> 2:38:56.840]  list it was him it was almost incredible good luck I said mr. Dodd are you the
[2:38:56.840 --> 2:39:01.240]  same one who was the investigator for the recent committee said yes that's that
[2:39:01.240 --> 2:39:06.800]  is I and I said well how wonderful I'm here I have a camera crew and I'm
[2:39:06.800 --> 2:39:10.720]  interested in your testimony would you like to speak for our cameras he said
[2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:16.760]  of course young man of course many years ago and so we got him over to where we
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:22.480]  were staying and I actually captured his whole story on videotape and it was a
[2:39:22.480 --> 2:39:27.160]  good thing because by that time he was advanced in years and he was not very
[2:39:27.160 --> 2:39:31.280]  well at all and it wasn't I think it was less than a year later that he passed
[2:39:31.280 --> 2:39:37.960]  away so we were fortunate enough to get his testimony again this time spoken to
[2:39:37.960 --> 2:39:42.200]  our cameras and I had a chance to question him so I became very very
[2:39:42.200 --> 2:39:46.960]  personally familiar with this story and I might say that if anybody is interested
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:52.800]  in this you can find them the complete description of what he said and you can
[2:39:52.800 --> 2:39:57.560]  find even a reference to the to the film the documentary film which we produced
[2:39:57.560 --> 2:40:03.560]  based on his testimony which is called the hidden agenda and you can find all
[2:40:03.560 --> 2:40:07.760]  of that on our website in fact it's been for talking about documents I think a
[2:40:07.760 --> 2:40:12.080]  good reference point would be to come to the Freedom Force website that's
[2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:18.680]  freedomforceinternational.org and when you get there to the landing page you'll
[2:40:18.680 --> 2:40:24.080]  see across the top a subsection called the issues and if you'll just navigate
[2:40:24.080 --> 2:40:30.120]  to the issues and at the bottom of that page you'll see a series of essays and
[2:40:30.120 --> 2:40:34.560]  references which include almost all of the documents that we're talking about
[2:40:34.560 --> 2:40:39.120]  Alex including the Norman Dodd testimony absolutely and people can also
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:43.320]  Google Norman Dodd and the video is out on the web but it's all the key info is
[2:40:43.320 --> 2:40:46.800]  there at the Freedom Force website we'll give that all out before you leave us
[2:40:46.800 --> 2:40:52.760]  again as well we also have Carol Quigley and I want to speak some about that and
[2:40:52.760 --> 2:40:56.280]  then get into what's currently happening as we come down to the end game and
[2:40:56.280 --> 2:40:59.760]  suddenly they go from denying their plans that they were building behind the
[2:40:59.760 --> 2:41:03.920]  curtains now they're launching this warmock this juggernaut against it so
[2:41:03.920 --> 2:41:10.160]  they've unveiled it and they are pushing it and telling everybody how great it
[2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:18.560]  is and how wonderful it is and how fantastic it is so let's discuss terms
[2:41:18.560 --> 2:41:22.440]  here because we start talking about a communist conspiracy people think it's
[2:41:22.440 --> 2:41:26.320]  a bunch of guys in black uniforms running around in Russia a hundred years
[2:41:26.320 --> 2:41:30.840]  ago can you explain to people why the ultra-rich always fund wealth
[2:41:30.840 --> 2:41:35.920]  transferring programs and always bill it and paint it and package it as if it's a
[2:41:35.920 --> 2:41:42.000]  revolution of the people and why ultra-rich make their wealth and keep
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:46.320]  their wealth and expand their wealth through monopolies through collectivist
[2:41:46.320 --> 2:41:50.400]  governments in all their forms because people go communism why are the rich
[2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:54.600]  funding it you know why do the rich love communist China so much explain that to
[2:41:54.600 --> 2:42:00.360]  people yeah it's it's really looking at the wrong place if you're asking why are
[2:42:00.360 --> 2:42:06.840]  they super rich our collectivists or gravitate into government it's they're
[2:42:06.840 --> 2:42:11.840]  ready the rich aspect of their characteristics is not the main thing
[2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:17.200]  is their power mad people and money is one of the most important levers of
[2:42:17.200 --> 2:42:22.920]  power and so power mad people these control freaks of the the predator
[2:42:22.920 --> 2:42:27.120]  class in different ways of saying the same thing they they will gravitate
[2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:32.040]  toward any mechanism of power well that's government isn't it if you can
[2:42:32.040 --> 2:42:37.200]  control the levers of governmental power you can really control the population
[2:42:37.200 --> 2:42:42.280]  and you can have all the money so it's it's kind of a it's a merger and they
[2:42:42.280 --> 2:42:46.920]  can pretend to be collectivists on the left or collectivists on the right it
[2:42:46.920 --> 2:42:52.000]  makes no difference right and left wings are merely two wings of the same ugly
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:57.520]  bird which is collectivism and like any wings on a bird they'll flap against
[2:42:57.520 --> 2:43:02.720]  each other in order to fly you need both wings to fly and so this is the
[2:43:02.720 --> 2:43:07.680]  appearance of conflict so that politically speaking all the dumb
[2:43:07.680 --> 2:43:12.160]  dumps down at the bottom at the bottom of this of mechanism think that they're
[2:43:12.160 --> 2:43:16.640]  you know participating in their own political destiny because they can go
[2:43:16.640 --> 2:43:20.800]  to the polls and they can vote the rascals out and vote Republican this
[2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:25.120]  time well we don't like that we'll go vote Democrat the next time and the two
[2:43:25.120 --> 2:43:30.640]  wings beat against each other and the bird flies and so that's true not only
[2:43:30.640 --> 2:43:34.680]  in our country but it's true around the world and it's true through much of
[2:43:34.680 --> 2:43:39.600]  modern history that the conflict that the big major conflicts of the world of
[2:43:39.600 --> 2:43:44.440]  which were familiar World War one World War two and the conflict that's goes
[2:43:44.440 --> 2:43:49.280]  goes on today which I would call World War three it's now going on is it is a
[2:43:49.280 --> 2:43:55.840]  conflict to a large extent between two branches of world collectivism
[2:44:00.480 --> 2:44:05.760]  okay we had our customary phone drop so we're going to get G. Ebergriffen back
[2:44:05.760 --> 2:44:09.520]  on effect let's just have Genesis do it give give Genesis his phone number and
[2:44:09.520 --> 2:44:14.880]  we'll just go with the Genesis phone system and test that out that way again
[2:44:14.880 --> 2:44:21.600]  G. Ebergriffen is our guest today and while we're getting G. Ebergriffen back
[2:44:21.600 --> 2:44:26.960]  on the line again I'll just point out that he is in the film fall of the
[2:44:26.960 --> 2:44:32.040]  Republic follow the Republic America's last stand make the choice liberty or
[2:44:32.040 --> 2:44:36.440]  tyranny follow the Republic documents on offshore corporate cartel is bankrupt in
[2:44:36.440 --> 2:44:40.560]  the U. S. economy by design leaders are now declaring that world government has
[2:44:40.560 --> 2:44:43.680]  arrived and that the dollar will be replaced with a new global currency
[2:44:43.680 --> 2:44:48.560]  president Obama has brazenly violated article one section nine of the U. S.
[2:44:48.560 --> 2:44:52.120]  Constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security
[2:44:52.120 --> 2:44:55.600]  Council that's becoming the first U. S. president to chair the world body a
[2:44:55.600 --> 2:44:59.320]  sign of a dictatorship is in its final stages of completion and laws
[2:44:59.320 --> 2:45:04.000]  protecting basic human rights are now being abolished worldwide and iron
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:07.520]  curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet a worldwide
[2:45:07.520 --> 2:45:11.640]  regime controlled by an unelected corporate elite is implementing a
[2:45:11.640 --> 2:45:14.720]  planetary carbon tax system that will dominate all human activity and
[2:45:14.720 --> 2:45:18.840]  establish a system of neo feudal slavery the image makers of carefully
[2:45:18.840 --> 2:45:22.760]  packaged Obama is the world's savior is the Trojan horse manufactured to
[2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:26.480]  pass by the people just long enough for the globalist to complete their master
[2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:30.720]  plan the film reveals the architecture of the New World Order and what the power
[2:45:30.720 --> 2:45:35.240]  elite have in store for humanity more importantly it communicates how we the
[2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:38.760]  people can retake our government turn the criminal tide and bring the tyrants
[2:45:38.760 --> 2:45:44.600]  to justice fall the republic available on DVD at info wars.com okay going back
[2:45:44.600 --> 2:45:50.200]  to G. Edward Griffin our line drop to you continue where you left off sir yeah
[2:45:50.200 --> 2:45:53.560]  I'm I don't know what happened all of a sudden I was talking to a dead phone but
[2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:57.520]  anyway it was probably the universe speaking to me because I realized I was
[2:45:57.520 --> 2:46:03.440]  digressing from your initial question which is why do these people always you
[2:46:03.440 --> 2:46:08.760]  know gravitate toward government and that the word that was used was the
[2:46:08.760 --> 2:46:12.600]  super rich or the very rich well actually you know in the beginning of this
[2:46:12.600 --> 2:46:19.360]  country America surpassed the rest of the world through a very simple principle
[2:46:19.360 --> 2:46:24.440]  it's called free enterprise competition and under those conditions that people
[2:46:24.440 --> 2:46:28.600]  compete they they produce the best product and service they possibly can at
[2:46:28.600 --> 2:46:34.240]  the lowest possible price and this leads to great systems of efficiency and
[2:46:34.240 --> 2:46:39.440]  productivity and that's in my view is what made America so great because we
[2:46:39.440 --> 2:46:45.280]  came from a virtual wilderness Europe was already far ahead of us but we
[2:46:45.280 --> 2:46:49.920]  bypassed Europe because of free enterprise competition well then about
[2:46:49.920 --> 2:46:57.160]  that toward the end of the 1800s these very wealthy people who had become the
[2:46:57.160 --> 2:47:00.680]  captains of industry as they like to call them you know the Rockefellers and
[2:47:00.680 --> 2:47:05.760]  the Carnegie's and so forth had already reached great fortunes acquired
[2:47:05.760 --> 2:47:09.960]  great fortunes and decided that competition was no longer in their best
[2:47:09.960 --> 2:47:14.720]  interest and they began to look for ways to eliminate competition in fact
[2:47:14.720 --> 2:47:20.640]  John D Rockefeller said it best he's quoted by all of his biographers he said
[2:47:20.640 --> 2:47:25.040]  competition is a sin well of course it's a sin if you're at the top of the
[2:47:25.040 --> 2:47:28.040]  pyramid and you don't want anybody competing with you because you're
[2:47:28.040 --> 2:47:32.880]  already in first place then you then you say competition is a sin and from
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:38.920]  that period of history about the 1880s on there was a rather substantial and
[2:47:38.920 --> 2:47:43.720]  rapid change in the way Americans did business instead of free enterprise
[2:47:43.720 --> 2:47:51.840]  competition they began to coalesce into cartels and form monopolies and to go
[2:47:51.840 --> 2:47:57.000]  into partnership with government to pass laws always in the name of protecting
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:02.840]  the people but laws which in reality eliminated competition and was able to
[2:48:02.840 --> 2:48:07.680]  throw competitive advantage in the direction of those with political
[2:48:07.680 --> 2:48:13.600]  influence and so we saw a change in the way people became rich it used to be
[2:48:13.600 --> 2:48:17.760]  they became rich by competing and by producing goods and services and then
[2:48:17.760 --> 2:48:24.120]  by the 1900s they became rich by not competing and instead using their
[2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:30.840]  prowess and their expertise to buy politicians to create laws that would
[2:48:30.840 --> 2:48:34.760]  eliminate their competition and give them unfair advantage and so that and
[2:48:34.760 --> 2:48:39.720]  that's how that's how we see the big bankers publicly funding fascism and
[2:48:39.720 --> 2:48:43.880]  communism now declassified that Hitler and Mussolini were mi5 and we're
[2:48:43.880 --> 2:48:48.000]  basically set up I mean this is the sophistication of the Milner group and
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:53.600]  this British model this imperial model of hiding your your your true
[2:48:53.600 --> 2:49:00.560]  government behind frontmen and so elites can come in and have the government
[2:49:00.560 --> 2:49:04.240]  give them the power to issue currency and credit and buy up the planet but
[2:49:04.240 --> 2:49:08.440]  still some people don't want to sell so now you pass big environmental laws
[2:49:08.440 --> 2:49:12.720]  which the Rockefellers admit they founded which they also founded the
[2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:17.440]  worldwide acceptance of eugenics over a hundred years ago as you know the rock
[2:49:17.440 --> 2:49:21.400]  stars were scientists and these elites were smart they finance most the
[2:49:21.400 --> 2:49:26.160]  scientists and they said come up with systems of social control to divide and
[2:49:26.160 --> 2:49:30.360]  conquer people to dumb them down to take over government to centralize
[2:49:30.360 --> 2:49:37.200]  control to take over education to render the public weak and impotent against us
[2:49:37.200 --> 2:49:41.760]  as Bertrand Russell said through social engineering that the elite finance in
[2:49:41.760 --> 2:49:47.720]  his own words a rebellion by the lower classes or the proles as he called us
[2:49:47.720 --> 2:49:50.640]  using communist terminology though he worked for the big money bank so was
[2:49:50.640 --> 2:49:57.040]  mi6 himself and OSS before that Nobel Prize winner he said a rebellion by the
[2:49:57.040 --> 2:50:03.000]  proles will be as unthinkable as a rebellion of sheep against the practice
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  of eating mutton or sheep is what mutton means for those that don't know so
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:10.840]  they're saying we're blind dumb sheep that sheep don't rebel against their
[2:50:10.840 --> 2:50:14.400]  owner when they're getting slaughtered do they gee Edward well no and cattle
[2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:18.400]  don't and a lot of all those domesticated animals don't and now we're
[2:50:18.400 --> 2:50:22.120]  back to Norman Dodd because what he discovered when he was talking with the
[2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:26.640]  heads of these tax extend foundations is that they were laying a master plan
[2:50:26.640 --> 2:50:33.840]  which was had as its goal how to make the population of America docile like
[2:50:33.840 --> 2:50:38.360]  cattle and sheep and how to get them to accept all of these things without
[2:50:38.360 --> 2:50:42.320]  complaining and without complaining and the strategy they came up with was
[2:50:42.320 --> 2:50:46.240]  absolutely brilliant stay there we're gonna talk about that strategy on the
[2:50:46.240 --> 2:50:50.720]  other side then bring it forward to current times and then the future with

[2:54:54.840 --> 2:54:58.920]  white papers congressional reports the foundations themselves scientific
[2:54:58.920 --> 2:55:03.160]  dictatorship global government to carry out a global police state that's

[2:55:28.280 --> 2:55:32.520]  always plan to have the u.n. religion it's all now happening please continue
[2:55:32.520 --> 2:55:36.560]  well yes and just before the break we were talking about the strategy the
[2:55:36.560 --> 2:55:42.160]  fact that this is not an accident this is not new this is the foundation for
[2:55:42.160 --> 2:55:47.600]  this was laid in strategic form well at the turn of the last century but we were
[2:55:47.600 --> 2:55:51.240]  talking about norman dot i keep coming back to him because i think there's so
[2:55:51.240 --> 2:55:55.920]  much to be learned from his testimony and and basically when he went and he
[2:55:55.920 --> 2:56:00.120]  talked to the head of the ford foundation the kind of the name of
[2:56:00.120 --> 2:56:07.280]  gator i think was his name and he said mr. gator i would like very much to
[2:56:07.280 --> 2:56:12.440]  know what you folks are doing here and he said without any hesitation gator said
[2:56:12.440 --> 2:56:17.480]  well mr. dodd i can tell you exactly what we're doing here he said that we
[2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:23.960]  are putting our resources to work so as to change the united states of america
[2:56:23.960 --> 2:56:29.360]  so it can be comfortably merged with the soviet union those were his exact
[2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:33.840]  words and and dodd said he almost fell off of his chair when he heard that and
[2:56:33.840 --> 2:56:37.560]  he said it wasn't just the soviet union it wasn't that it was communism that they
[2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:41.760]  wanted but the fact was if you could merge the united states with the soviet
[2:56:41.760 --> 2:56:45.480]  union which was at the opposite end the people thought of the political
[2:56:45.480 --> 2:56:48.920]  spectrum while you could merge it with any nation and that was the real goal
[2:56:48.920 --> 2:56:53.320]  because they were trying to set up a merger process which the united states
[2:56:53.320 --> 2:56:59.360]  would be merged with the soviet union red china france england germany you know
[2:56:59.360 --> 2:57:06.080]  the world and then he said well how can you do that and he got the answer of when
[2:57:06.080 --> 2:57:11.800]  he visited the offices of the Carnegie endowment fund for international peace
[2:57:11.800 --> 2:57:17.560]  he said then you can take a look at our minute books and you can see what we do
[2:57:17.560 --> 2:57:21.080]  here and the answer came that here's here's the answer the strategy that i'm
[2:57:21.080 --> 2:57:25.600]  finally building to they said the american people will never surrender their
[2:57:25.600 --> 2:57:31.960]  affinity to their legal system their customs their traditions you know none
[2:57:31.960 --> 2:57:35.720]  of that the people are in america are different and they'll never give up any
[2:57:35.720 --> 2:57:42.440]  of that unless unless they're frightened into it if they thought that it was
[2:57:42.440 --> 2:57:47.200]  necessary in order to survive then they will give up everything because
[2:57:47.200 --> 2:57:52.640]  survival is the most basic instinct of all human beings and so therefore if
[2:57:52.640 --> 2:57:56.600]  you're going to change life in the united states so it can be comfortably
[2:57:56.600 --> 2:58:01.400]  merged with the soviet union and any other totalitarian system in the world
[2:58:01.400 --> 2:58:06.080]  you must make the united states a totalitarian system and the way to do
[2:58:06.080 --> 2:58:11.440]  that is to scare the people by getting them embroiled into wars and this is
[2:58:11.440 --> 2:58:16.320]  the amazing part then the Carnegie endowment fund for peace then plotted
[2:58:16.320 --> 2:58:21.120]  to get the united states into world war one and to prolong it and they said if
[2:58:21.120 --> 2:58:25.600]  you can get the american people into war and be a afraid of their survival they
[2:58:25.600 --> 2:58:31.680]  will accept a totalitarian government so let's be clear it is on record in the
[2:58:31.680 --> 2:58:35.560]  congressional record the foundations admit they started world war one and
[2:58:35.560 --> 2:58:40.000]  world war two to get the un and the world government they are the warmongers

[3:01:02.080 --> 3:01:08.120]  and shut it down it's official yes the secret copyright treaty now leaked you
[3:01:08.120 --> 3:01:12.800]  can take this for what it's worth but from internal sources from one person
[3:01:12.800 --> 3:01:18.480]  that was a former employee at the fort detrick bio weapons laboratory in
[3:01:18.480 --> 3:01:24.760]  maryland that would then went to the cdc as well as someone who was very high
[3:01:24.760 --> 3:01:29.600]  ranking military that what i understand got direct info from northern command
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:35.360]  this was back in april they both said that when when the original swine flu
[3:01:35.360 --> 3:01:41.280]  in it was talked about by the mainstream media that they said that that was they
[3:01:41.280 --> 3:01:45.240]  were coming and they were you know that was that this was the end game right
[3:01:45.240 --> 3:01:51.360]  there that this is a bio bio engineered weapon dr. a true odd who you've heard
[3:01:51.360 --> 3:01:57.280]  of he has a paper that he wrote where he one of the interesting things he cites
[3:01:57.280 --> 3:02:02.040]  is that this that that virus was engineered using the promise software
[3:02:02.040 --> 3:02:07.400]  that which is the same stuff that michael rickon a chuteau who was a
[3:02:07.400 --> 3:02:14.720]  former cia scientist built a backdoor for in the 80s with promise software is
[3:02:14.720 --> 3:02:20.320]  to track financial operations and stocks and bond trading what do you mean it
[3:02:20.320 --> 3:02:26.960]  was used to write the virus it's a it's well it was originally it was okay
[3:02:26.960 --> 3:02:30.480]  later when it was originally developed it didn't have those capabilities I'm
[3:02:30.480 --> 3:02:34.960]  talking about but later artificial intelligence capabilities were added to
[3:02:34.960 --> 3:02:41.400]  it by g aero space and have since been greatly expanded by a place called a
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:45.520]  system architectures laboratory at george mason university with under
[3:02:45.520 --> 3:02:52.320]  alexander levis this is this is a cited directly from the guy who was the the
[3:02:52.320 --> 3:02:58.040]  chief scientist for p-tech doctor who st. ibrahim who in dearer singh mentions
[3:02:58.040 --> 3:03:03.080]  in her in her testimony regarding this and basically the software is used to
[3:03:03.080 --> 3:03:07.200]  analyze it's run on supercomputers and they use it to analyze the genetic
[3:03:07.200 --> 3:03:11.240]  sequencing using something called reverse genetics well I know that's what
[3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:15.720]  IBM and the human genome are doing at the eugenics headquarters coal springs
[3:03:15.720 --> 3:03:21.800]  harbor and they this can be backed up by research if you if you just you can
[3:03:21.800 --> 3:03:25.800]  independently verify this will do this write us an article because I think I
[3:03:25.800 --> 3:03:30.080]  recognize your voice you've written some good info at the prison planet forum

[3:03:33.800 --> 3:03:39.680]  appreciate I appreciate your call I know that a few months ago there was that
[3:03:39.680 --> 3:03:42.760]  israeli spy who they said was threatening the winehouse and they
[3:03:42.760 --> 3:03:48.080]  were were gassing his car and no one knew how for hours he could take the
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:52.000]  tear gas and then they grabbed him and it did turn out that he reportedly called
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:56.040]  into radio shows and had warned everybody that there was going to be a
[3:03:56.040 --> 3:04:00.360]  bio weapon release in the flu vaccine and I've tried to look over that and it's
[3:04:00.360 --> 3:04:04.920]  not completely substantiated but very interesting and we are trying to look
[3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:09.040]  into it there's just so much happening but thank you so much for reminding me
[3:04:09.040 --> 3:04:12.920]  of that report we put links to it curtain Emma wrote a story two days ago
[3:04:12.920 --> 3:04:16.600]  with a hyperlink at the bottom to some of the sites that are reporting that and
[3:04:16.600 --> 3:04:19.920]  Kurt said you know we can't prove this but this is what people are saying and
[3:04:19.920 --> 3:04:26.960]  ask other researchers to look into that for themselves but there's no doubt the
[3:04:26.960 --> 3:04:31.440]  globalists are moving on every front there is no doubt that we are in a very
[3:04:31.440 --> 3:04:34.800]  very serious time right now we're going to go to break and come back with
[3:04:34.800 --> 3:04:39.800]  congressman Ron Paul we're gonna start sample casting the radio show live on

[3:05:16.200 --> 3:05:20.400]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[3:05:20.400 --> 3:05:25.640]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the

[3:08:06.560 --> 3:08:10.240]  there's a war on for your mind
[3:08:16.960 --> 3:08:20.780]  we are live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us we're also
[3:08:20.780 --> 3:08:25.240]  simulcast in the radio show live right now in living color at prison planet dot
[3:08:25.240 --> 3:08:31.320]  tv it is Thursday the fifth day of November 2009 and for the next 20
[3:08:31.320 --> 3:08:35.880]  minutes or so congressman Ron Paul joins us from Capitol Hill and there is a
[3:08:35.880 --> 3:08:43.880]  lot to talk about today first off out of the gates you obviously got 290 plus
[3:08:43.880 --> 3:08:48.520]  sponsors to begin the audit of the private secretive Federal Reserve you've
[3:08:48.520 --> 3:08:52.800]  talked this week about some maneuvers by some of the committee chairman to gut
[3:08:52.800 --> 3:08:57.760]  the bill can you give us an update on where your legislation is going
[3:08:57.760 --> 3:09:02.400]  congressman well actually right now we have 309 and that's a hundred and 30
[3:09:02.400 --> 3:09:07.680]  some Democrats as well as all the Republicans and at one time Mel Watt
[3:09:07.680 --> 3:09:11.480]  had indicated to me that he would get a provision put in the bill by Barney
[3:09:11.480 --> 3:09:17.040]  Frank which would be a very very limited version of an audit which would be a
[3:09:17.040 --> 3:09:22.040]  distraction if nothing else even though the little bit we was doing it was okay
[3:09:22.040 --> 3:09:27.000]  it was just so so small it was canceling out most of what I wanted to do but his
[3:09:27.000 --> 3:09:30.760]  provision didn't get put into the bill we are now in the middle of doing the
[3:09:30.760 --> 3:09:34.240]  bill I thought there was even a chance today that I would get to offer my
[3:09:34.240 --> 3:09:38.880]  amendment which is 1207 to the bill but it was just announced a few minutes ago
[3:09:38.880 --> 3:09:44.600]  that Barney Frank said that well the controversial type of amendments won't
[3:09:44.600 --> 3:09:49.520]  be done until after the Labor Day or the Veterans Day break which is next week
[3:09:49.520 --> 3:09:52.720]  so won't be this week and it won't be next week but the following week I
[3:09:52.720 --> 3:09:57.200]  suspect they're just lining up their ducks and they'll probably be lots of
[3:09:57.200 --> 3:10:01.440]  attempts to water things down but I don't know but we'll have to wait and see
[3:10:01.440 --> 3:10:06.680]  so we're in the middle of it we're coming close to at least a initial
[3:10:06.680 --> 3:10:12.240]  climax of the bill on what the banking committee will do and it has to survive
[3:10:12.240 --> 3:10:16.280]  there and has to come out there pretty whole or things won't look so good for
[3:10:16.280 --> 3:10:21.560]  us but I'm constantly optimistic about it but the momentum's clearly shifted 20
[3:10:21.560 --> 3:10:25.320]  something years ago you might get two or three co-sponsors now you have over
[3:10:25.320 --> 3:10:31.040]  300 a giant house majority so so the momentum is shifting against the secret
[3:10:31.040 --> 3:10:36.440]  of organization yeah and if we can get clean vote I can't imagine very many
[3:10:36.440 --> 3:10:41.720]  wanting to be on record to vote against this it just it's just as going to give
[3:10:41.720 --> 3:10:46.080]  them a lot of grief especially
[3:10:46.080 --> 3:10:49.080]  congressman
[3:10:49.080 --> 3:11:01.120]  okay phone system glitch we will get congressman ron paul back on with us in
[3:11:01.120 --> 3:11:03.680]  just a moment
[3:11:05.960 --> 3:11:11.640]  tell you we got gremlins in our phone system or the congressman does I got a
[3:11:11.640 --> 3:11:18.720]  whole host of important questions that I want to ask the congressman here today
[3:11:18.720 --> 3:11:26.880]  and we're going to be going over those here in just a moment with him like the
[3:11:26.880 --> 3:11:31.920]  death of the dollar the flu situation Afghanistan the big republican wins in
[3:11:31.920 --> 3:11:50.040]  New Jersey and Virginia and a lot more all right and of course we will post this
[3:11:50.040 --> 3:11:59.640]  archive up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com okay congressman
[3:11:59.640 --> 3:12:08.040]  got you back quickly thank you congressman that is a phone system
[3:12:08.040 --> 3:12:14.600]  situation happening obviously on their end so we will try to get congressman
[3:12:14.600 --> 3:12:26.560]  ron paul back on right now in the meantime we do have Joe Rogan joining us
[3:12:26.560 --> 3:12:34.240]  later in studio today and lorence jay kotlakov he of course is a boss university
[3:12:34.240 --> 3:12:42.600]  professor of economics to discuss the mclatchy newspaper article that he was
[3:12:42.600 --> 3:12:52.960]  quoted in that we have been discussing how goldman sacks secretly bet on the
[3:12:52.960 --> 3:12:58.040]  u.s. housing crash okay maybe threes the charm congressman do we have you I'm
[3:12:58.040 --> 3:13:04.160]  back I don't know what happened gremlins in the house switchboard okay we were
[3:13:04.160 --> 3:13:08.680]  finishing up with the fed on monetary policy congressman you've long talked
[3:13:08.680 --> 3:13:14.240]  about the central banks using the dollar to prop up the empire now the g20s
[3:13:14.240 --> 3:13:19.920]  discussing abandoning the dollar what is happening from your research
[3:13:19.920 --> 3:13:24.120]  perspective with the dollar right now and what will happen if the dollar is
[3:13:24.120 --> 3:13:28.560]  fully abandoned I don't think anybody knows right now if they just let it go
[3:13:28.560 --> 3:13:33.360]  and the dollars rejected and it'll be people will have to resort to sound
[3:13:33.360 --> 3:13:38.480]  money and they'd have to resort to commodity money but as you say the g20 or
[3:13:38.480 --> 3:13:44.160]  the IMF and the world leaders so to speak are going to try to replace it I
[3:13:44.160 --> 3:13:48.640]  think the market has has replaced the dollar reserve standard they've gotten
[3:13:48.640 --> 3:13:53.320]  rid of that I don't think they can rebuild on that so they are rushing around
[3:13:53.320 --> 3:13:56.760]  trying to figure out what they what they'll replace it with I think what
[3:13:56.760 --> 3:14:00.960]  they'll try to do is come up with a basket of currencies they even might be
[3:14:00.960 --> 3:14:04.560]  tempted to put a little bit of gold in there but it's not going to suffice if
[3:14:04.560 --> 3:14:08.400]  they don't have even a little bit of gold even if they come up with another
[3:14:08.400 --> 3:14:12.960]  worldwide fiat standard I don't think it's going to convey trust I think I
[3:14:12.960 --> 3:14:16.240]  think they're behind they're between the rock and the hard place and it's not
[3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:20.320]  going to be easy for them to push something on us but one thing for sure I
[3:14:20.320 --> 3:14:23.480]  think there's gonna be a lot of chaos and I think there's going to be a lot
[3:14:23.480 --> 3:14:29.000]  more economic problems and more poverty and more you know depression in the
[3:14:29.000 --> 3:14:36.920]  world just because of this absolutely so just to be clear you agree with the big
[3:14:36.920 --> 3:14:41.000]  economic headlines we've seen the last month that the dollar as the World
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:45.880]  Reserve currency has been abandoned China India the European Union the Arabs
[3:14:45.880 --> 3:14:50.840]  are now buying more foreign currencies than they are the dollar they still hold
[3:14:50.840 --> 3:14:56.520]  an overall majority of dollars at around 62 to 63% but they are now
[3:14:56.520 --> 3:15:01.160]  abandoning the dollar as reserve currency a do you agree with that be what
[3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:05.200]  will this do to our economy what's gonna hurt the economy I wouldn't say it's
[3:15:05.200 --> 3:15:09.880]  abandoned but it's it's less important all the time I mean the fact that they
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:14.920]  can still have 60% reserves means it's still still there but the market I
[3:15:14.920 --> 3:15:18.400]  look at the market signals and I think the thing that happened this week was
[3:15:18.400 --> 3:15:22.600]  very very significant that is when the IMF announces that they're going to dump
[3:15:22.600 --> 3:15:27.720]  200 tons of gold on the market well you know ordinarily a person was thinking
[3:15:27.720 --> 3:15:31.240]  they were hoping well a lot of gold out there that's going to drive down the
[3:15:31.240 --> 3:15:34.880]  price of gold and make all the fiat currencies look better but what happened
[3:15:34.880 --> 3:15:41.640]  a bank from Asia India buys the whole lot which sent a signal I think to the
[3:15:41.640 --> 3:15:47.160]  world markets that in essence gold has been re-monetized they it never gets
[3:15:47.160 --> 3:15:51.600]  demonetized but it has less importance as money when that all the country's
[3:15:51.600 --> 3:15:56.920]  rejected but I think this is a major major signal that the dollar is getting
[3:15:56.920 --> 3:16:01.200]  closer it's on its last legs and gold is getting more important and as the
[3:16:01.200 --> 3:16:05.960]  Chinese buy less and less they they have already started buying gold and they
[3:16:05.960 --> 3:16:09.920]  don't want to buy too much too fast and you know shoot the price up you know
[3:16:09.920 --> 3:16:13.480]  too quickly I think that's coming I think the gold price is destined to go a
[3:16:13.480 --> 3:16:18.800]  lot higher than the dollar is going to go a lot lower and they cannot be thrown
[3:16:18.800 --> 3:16:23.840]  gold they can disrupt and play these games for a long long time but in many
[3:16:23.840 --> 3:16:28.520]  ways this is very very good because it tells us that the governments no longer
[3:16:28.520 --> 3:16:32.520]  can get away with just printing money to finance their schemes as their schemes
[3:16:32.520 --> 3:16:37.360]  that are so damaging to us whether it's the welfare or the warfare it all hurts
[3:16:37.360 --> 3:16:41.360]  the people because they have to pay the bill so some of these things are good
[3:16:41.360 --> 3:16:44.680]  signals although it means that we have to be concerned about the chaos that
[3:16:44.680 --> 3:16:52.320]  might erupt absolutely congressman the private central banks as you know are
[3:16:52.320 --> 3:16:58.440]  financing the Copenhagen Treaty I have the treaty here in front of me all 200
[3:16:58.440 --> 3:17:03.560]  pages of the Framework Convention on Climate Change it states as Ban Ki
[3:17:03.560 --> 3:17:08.680]  Moon wrote last week of the New York Times that this is global governance and
[3:17:08.680 --> 3:17:15.720]  that select groups of private interest are going to be able to decide who can
[3:17:15.720 --> 3:17:20.000]  have a factory who can have a business they can decide who's going to get the
[3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:25.880]  carbon credits this scheme was designed by Ken Lay as Congress has reported the
[3:17:25.880 --> 3:17:32.840]  Senate committee has now approved the climate bill as Reuters reports
[3:17:32.840 --> 3:17:37.600]  if our economy under globalization and after and get is already sputtering
[3:17:37.600 --> 3:17:41.720]  what's going to happen if we allow the very same central banks to create this
[3:17:41.720 --> 3:17:45.920]  new derivative system well if it works it's work for a short while and
[3:17:45.920 --> 3:17:50.560]  companies like Goldman Sachs and a few others will rip us off and they'll you
[3:17:50.560 --> 3:17:55.280]  know get even more wealth but it cannot help the economy it has to hurt the
[3:17:55.280 --> 3:17:58.680]  economy and it can't possibly help the environment because they're totally off
[3:17:58.680 --> 3:18:02.920]  track on that it's a it might turn out to be one of the biggest hoaxes of all
[3:18:02.920 --> 3:18:07.680]  history this whole global warming terrorism that they've been using so
[3:18:07.680 --> 3:18:11.400]  but we'll have to just wait and see but it cannot be helpful it's going to hurt
[3:18:11.400 --> 3:18:17.960]  everybody what's the inside baseball word in Congress Diane Feinstein and
[3:18:17.960 --> 3:18:21.960]  Barbara Boxer say they're going to be able to pass it this year next year but
[3:18:21.960 --> 3:18:25.040]  more and more evidence on the ground shows that we're going to be able to
[3:18:25.040 --> 3:18:30.920]  beat the House and Senate version of the climate bill that is meant to tie in to
[3:18:30.920 --> 3:18:35.080]  the Copenhagen UN takeover I think there is a chance and I think these
[3:18:35.080 --> 3:18:41.800]  elections I might send the signal I think the continual presence of the tea
[3:18:41.800 --> 3:18:46.960]  party movement and the people speaking out might wake them up finally you know
[3:18:46.960 --> 3:18:52.040]  and say hey maybe we are doing too much too fast and they might back off right
[3:18:52.040 --> 3:18:55.680]  now they're not absolutely positive they have the votes from this medical bill
[3:18:55.680 --> 3:18:59.600]  will know shortly whether the House will see if they have the votes they think
[3:18:59.600 --> 3:19:02.720]  the House can do it faster than the Senate they're going to try to do that on
[3:19:02.720 --> 3:19:09.400]  Saturday of this week but there they have two problems it's not automatic and
[3:19:09.400 --> 3:19:13.160]  thank goodness for radio talk shows and the Internet for us to get this
[3:19:13.160 --> 3:19:16.280]  information out that's what's rallying the troops certainly isn't the mainstream
[3:19:16.280 --> 3:19:21.160]  media speaking of the Internet we're talking to Congressman Ron Paul we now
[3:19:21.160 --> 3:19:29.000]  have the cyber security act three days ago finally the national security blocked
[3:19:29.000 --> 3:19:35.200]  copyright treaty has now leaked and it says open taxing open regulation of the
[3:19:35.200 --> 3:19:41.680]  web I can being handed over to the UN total control guilty until proven innocent
[3:19:41.680 --> 3:19:47.880]  copyright rules shutting down websites ISPs and really UN control over the
[3:19:47.880 --> 3:19:52.200]  Internet where do you stand on that congressman well it's very frightening
[3:19:52.200 --> 3:19:57.200]  and I think that if they're successful this just hope that Internet is too big
[3:19:57.200 --> 3:20:03.320]  and too complex for them ever to have controls but they're making this is not
[3:20:03.320 --> 3:20:09.040]  a drill repeat this is not a drill gun cells are on a staggering pace gun prices

[3:24:06.200 --> 3:24:10.440]  the point being sure why should they be in charge and why should we turn over
[3:24:10.440 --> 3:24:15.360]  our health care to these clowns who are trying to distribute you know a
[3:24:15.360 --> 3:24:19.680]  vaccine so either way it's bad congressman boy that we shouldn't be doing it
[3:24:19.680 --> 3:24:24.120]  on top of that all over the country schools are injecting children even
[3:24:24.120 --> 3:24:27.120]  when their parents say don't do it in this in the schools are saying oops it's
[3:24:27.120 --> 3:24:33.120]  an accident clearly that's premeditated but shifting gears now we saw
[3:24:33.120 --> 3:24:40.080]  Republican wins in New Jersey and Virginia the president's approval
[3:24:40.080 --> 3:24:44.000]  rating when he was first elected up in the 80s now down the low 40s but
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:47.120]  Republicans still by and large have low approval ratings unless they're like
[3:24:47.120 --> 3:24:52.080]  yourself who's actually a constitutionalist we know that in 2010
[3:24:52.080 --> 3:24:56.240]  there's gonna be a huge backlash Republicans will take back a lot of
[3:24:56.240 --> 3:25:01.080]  seats but if they don't deliver on smaller government and in fiscal sound
[3:25:01.080 --> 3:25:06.720]  constitutional policies then we're gonna have a real crisis on our hands and if
[3:25:06.720 --> 3:25:11.920]  we wait to get politically active until 2011 into 2012 so much of this
[3:25:11.920 --> 3:25:16.200]  globalization would have already been expanded and submitted I know that this
[3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:21.040]  is still off in the future but LA Times New York Times everybody's talking I
[3:25:21.040 --> 3:25:26.760]  get calls every day saying when is Ron Paul going to announce for 2012 because
[3:25:26.760 --> 3:25:31.600]  if you announce early you can build the coalition you can get an even more
[3:25:31.600 --> 3:25:36.920]  elevated position in the media you can speak for the people that don't want
[3:25:36.920 --> 3:25:40.640]  war that don't want big government that don't want banker bailouts if you wait
[3:25:40.640 --> 3:25:47.040]  to announce until 2011 after your congressional win coming up but I guess
[3:25:47.040 --> 3:25:51.000]  I'm being presumptive I mean you're not even saying you're gonna announce it
[3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:57.960]  2011 no I'm still thinking a lot about that right now it just doesn't seem like
[3:25:57.960 --> 3:26:04.440]  the best thing to do even long-term or even on a short-term basis so I'm not
[3:26:04.440 --> 3:26:08.720]  that I'm not just I'm decided about the whole thing you know so I'm not about to
[3:26:08.720 --> 3:26:14.520]  say that I'm planning to do one thing or another congressman I think you make
[3:26:14.520 --> 3:26:17.880]  some good points but I think time is still it's still a little bit early to
[3:26:17.880 --> 3:26:25.800]  start talking about it but so much is happening and if you step up even
[3:26:25.800 --> 3:26:29.520]  further and no one's saying that you haven't done more than anybody else and
[3:26:29.520 --> 3:26:35.880]  start building the coalition now I'd really unless there's massive election
[3:26:35.880 --> 3:26:41.760]  fraud I see no way that you could lose the Republican primary I mean how can we
[3:26:41.760 --> 3:26:47.000]  allow a rhino someone who's not really a constitutionalist like another McCain
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:26:51.980]  another Mitt Romney to lead conservatives and libertarians down another
[3:26:51.980 --> 3:26:57.000]  rat hole I mean you are the man for the job and I don't pretend to understand
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:27:00.520]  your political strategy I know you're much more intelligent and wise than I am
[3:27:00.520 --> 3:27:05.200]  and have more experience it just makes perfect sense for at least sometime in
[3:27:05.200 --> 3:27:09.960]  the next six to eight months to announce but you're saying you're not even sure at
[3:27:09.960 --> 3:27:13.720]  this time I mean even if you didn't win you would have huge fundraising you'd be
[3:27:13.720 --> 3:27:17.320]  able to buy ads you'd be all over the media you'll be the only candidate that
[3:27:17.320 --> 3:27:21.520]  will inject real issues I mean you're the only man for the job I mean fate and
[3:27:21.520 --> 3:27:27.480]  and responsibility and destiny says that you are the man for the job you have
[3:27:27.480 --> 3:27:33.080]  to realize you're not the average Republican or you're a little bit
[3:27:33.080 --> 3:27:38.400]  you're a little bit more optimistic about what we might be able to we still
[3:27:38.400 --> 3:27:42.280]  have a lot of contend with when you get involved in partisan politics and you
[3:27:42.280 --> 3:27:46.320]  you followed that stuff that was going on over in Nevada how they really handle
[3:27:46.320 --> 3:27:51.920]  us I think we'll do better if we ever did it again but you know they just
[3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:55.440]  closed down shop if they think you're going to win so you have a lot of
[3:27:55.440 --> 3:27:59.040]  obstacles to overcome but the most important thing and this is what you've
[3:27:59.040 --> 3:28:03.520]  emphasized as well politics are very important but also is getting those
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:08.160]  issues out and talking about the philosophy and why we need it and get
[3:28:08.160 --> 3:28:12.000]  the people energized and that should be ongoing of course that's why we keep
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:15.640]  campaign for liberty moving in that direction because people have to
[3:28:15.640 --> 3:28:19.280]  understand things like the Federal Reserve just think a couple years ago
[3:28:19.280 --> 3:28:23.840]  not too many people even talked about the Federal Reserve and now they can do
[3:28:23.840 --> 3:28:27.840]  national polling on the Federal Reserve to get opinion so in that sense I think
[3:28:27.840 --> 3:28:31.640]  we're making progress exactly we've gone from almost no one knowing it's a
[3:28:31.640 --> 3:28:36.640]  private cartel to over 75% wanting an audit or for it to be abolished it's
[3:28:36.640 --> 3:28:40.920]  only a win-win for you to run because it will elevate you it will have you in
[3:28:40.920 --> 3:28:46.120]  the debates and I don't see any way you won't run unless you've got medical
[3:28:46.120 --> 3:28:49.880]  problems and you're in great shape you look like you're 60 congressmen and I'm
[3:28:49.880 --> 3:28:55.000]  just begging you for millions of other people to kick off the campaign sooner
[3:28:55.000 --> 3:28:59.480]  rather than later I want to commend you for you know helping to get your son to
[3:28:59.480 --> 3:29:03.400]  run for the Senate people need to get behind him right now and as you said
[3:29:03.400 --> 3:29:07.200]  the biggest movement now on the universities isn't the burnout fake
[3:29:07.200 --> 3:29:12.600]  laugh for the burnout fake right it is the libertarian free market non
[3:29:12.600 --> 3:29:17.160]  collectivist movement that you have helped to grow and energize and you
[3:29:17.160 --> 3:29:21.840]  are the omnibudsman of liberty the leading light for freedom worldwide as
[3:29:21.840 --> 3:29:25.800]  even the Czech president has said and I just want to salute you and thank you
[3:29:25.800 --> 3:29:29.520]  in closing we got 30 seconds are they going to be able to ram through the
[3:29:29.520 --> 3:29:32.800]  government takeover of health care oh they're going to get it through the
[3:29:32.800 --> 3:29:35.960]  house but whether the whole thing gets through I think it'll get part of it but
[3:29:35.960 --> 3:29:41.480]  not the whole thing so we'll wait and see and we we've adapted in this
[3:29:41.480 --> 3:29:45.080]  country to incrementalism we never socialize all at once we just take it
[3:29:45.080 --> 3:29:49.560]  by pieces and think that we've really resisted something so unfortunately it's
[3:29:49.560 --> 3:29:55.600]  gonna get worse rather than we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones

[3:33:11.160 --> 3:33:26.400]  you just got a chance to hear congressman Ron Paul on with us though
[3:33:26.400 --> 3:33:34.000]  the capital switchboard cut him off twice I've heard him on other radio
[3:33:34.000 --> 3:33:40.520]  shows when that happens you must have somebody in that office the train
[3:33:40.520 --> 3:33:43.800]  gorilla or something somewhere in the in the capital building that's running
[3:33:43.800 --> 3:33:50.200]  the switchboard I could get more conspiratorial and say that they were
[3:33:50.200 --> 3:33:54.880]  knocking him off air with us but that's probably not the case
[3:33:57.840 --> 3:34:01.600]  let's go ahead and take some phone calls right now we got this economist
[3:34:01.600 --> 3:34:04.880]  coming up I got a bunch of other news I want to hit as well plus there's a video
[3:34:04.880 --> 3:34:15.600]  clip of Robert Kennedy Jr. on television talking about what vaccines are doing to
[3:34:15.600 --> 3:34:19.040]  people and you've got all these Hollywood stars coming out you've got
[3:34:19.040 --> 3:34:24.520]  even people like Bill Maher coming out against vaccines you've got the the
[3:34:24.520 --> 3:34:28.440]  founder of smashing pumpkins coming out against vaccines you've got all these
[3:34:28.440 --> 3:34:32.840]  politicians coming out against vaccines it shows how the media and the vaccine
[3:34:32.840 --> 3:34:36.920]  cult keeps telling us we're cooks telling us we're liars saying there's no
[3:34:36.920 --> 3:34:41.560]  mercury saying it can't brain damage you we're mentally ill and that's only
[3:34:41.560 --> 3:34:46.360]  discrediting them and the momentum has clearly not just shifted against the
[3:34:46.360 --> 3:34:52.440]  vaccine pushers but has fully shifted against them it's a route now and that's
[3:34:52.440 --> 3:34:56.800]  why that you have this attempted hype with a non-pandemic flu strain a flu
[3:34:56.800 --> 3:35:00.520]  strain that's very weak compared to the regular seasonal flu that's why you have
[3:35:00.520 --> 3:35:03.840]  this incredible hype is an attempt of them to say you don't want shots you
[3:35:03.840 --> 3:35:07.280]  want to break the the precedent and the mind control that you've got to take the
[3:35:07.280 --> 3:35:11.800]  Gardasil shot and all these other vaccines and hepatitis shot oh yeah
[3:35:11.800 --> 3:35:15.800]  we're gonna scare you we're gonna hype it we're gonna stage artificial scarcity
[3:35:15.800 --> 3:35:19.160]  of the vaccine and say we don't have enough of it and stage events where we
[3:35:19.160 --> 3:35:22.160]  tell people come down and get the free shot and then we don't have any of it to
[3:35:22.160 --> 3:35:25.800]  show people panicking we're gonna throw everything we've got at you to try to
[3:35:25.800 --> 3:35:31.080]  manipulate you and it's not working again the global the globalists are in
[3:35:31.080 --> 3:35:35.040]  trouble on every front 75 plus percent of Americans and Gallup polls wanted
[3:35:35.040 --> 3:35:39.960]  abolished or audited over 90 percent of Americans want to get rid of naphtha and
[3:35:39.960 --> 3:35:44.880]  cat Obama had to lie and save is gonna get rid of it to get elected now he says
[3:35:44.880 --> 3:35:50.800]  I never said that we have that and follow the Republic a lot of good things
[3:35:50.800 --> 3:35:52.960]  are happening we're gonna go to your phone calls but let's go ahead and play
[3:35:52.960 --> 3:35:58.280]  this Robert Kennedy clip right now here it is
[3:36:02.800 --> 3:36:08.040]  the generate what happened was the vaccine schedule was increased we went
[3:36:08.040 --> 3:36:13.360]  up from receiving about 10 vaccines in our generation to these kids receive
[3:36:13.360 --> 3:36:18.680]  24 vaccines and they all had this time aerosol in this mercury and nobody
[3:36:18.680 --> 3:36:22.800]  bothered to do an out analysis of what the cumulative impact of all that
[3:36:22.800 --> 3:36:27.080]  mercury was doing to kids as it turns out we are injecting our children with
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:33.000]  400 times the amount of mercury that FDA or EPA consider safe a child on his
[3:36:33.000 --> 3:36:38.920]  first day that he's born is injected with a hepatitis B shot under EPA
[3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:44.040]  guidelines he would be have to have to be 275 pounds to safely absorb that shot
[3:36:44.040 --> 3:36:48.560]  and yet we're just constantly pumping our kids with these vaccines with what
[3:36:48.560 --> 3:36:56.800]  happened what happened was that in 1988 one in every 2,500 American children
[3:36:56.800 --> 3:37:02.880]  had autism today one in every hundred and 66 children have autism and plus one
[3:37:02.880 --> 3:37:06.640]  in six children have other kinds of learning disorders other kinds of
[3:37:06.640 --> 3:37:10.520]  neurological disorders speech delay language disorders ADD
[3:37:10.520 --> 3:37:14.680]  hyperactivity that all seem to be connected that are all connected the
[3:37:14.680 --> 3:37:19.040]  science shows are all connected to autism you know Bobby we've always you
[3:37:19.040 --> 3:37:22.160]  and I could could debate a thousand different issues whether it's Terry
[3:37:22.160 --> 3:37:27.120]  Shiva or the environment I think would agree on the environment but in this
[3:37:27.120 --> 3:37:29.600]  case you've got the federal government coming in saying well there's no really
[3:37:29.600 --> 3:37:33.680]  there's no good science and of course in politics science always gets diluted
[3:37:33.680 --> 3:37:38.960]  why hasn't the federal government stepped up and it worked more because
[3:37:38.960 --> 3:37:44.160]  listen Bobby I can't prove it tonight you can't prove it but intuitively you
[3:37:44.160 --> 3:37:47.680]  look at the spike you look at what happened with the Marisol there is no
[3:37:47.680 --> 3:37:51.400]  doubt in my mind maybe it's two years from now maybe it's five years from now
[3:37:51.400 --> 3:37:56.320]  maybe it's 10 years from now we're gonna find out that the Marisol causes in my
[3:37:56.320 --> 3:38:00.440]  opinion autism you know what the science is out there today for anybody who
[3:38:00.440 --> 3:38:04.640]  bothers to read it and I I have read it actually on my website this week Robert
[3:38:04.640 --> 3:38:09.040]  F. Kennedy junior comm I'm publishing an article that goes through all of the
[3:38:09.040 --> 3:38:13.920]  science but the science is clear and what happens is I read the science at
[3:38:13.920 --> 3:38:16.920]  first and there's literally hundreds and hundreds of studies that connect
[3:38:16.920 --> 3:38:22.080]  from Marisol to you know to these disastrous neurological disorders then
[3:38:22.080 --> 3:38:26.240]  I went I talked to the scientists then I went and I talked to the federal
[3:38:26.240 --> 3:38:30.560]  bureaucrats who are defending time aerosol and I said what are you relying on
[3:38:30.560 --> 3:38:34.600]  and I looked at the science they're relying on and I can tell you Joe it is
[3:38:34.600 --> 3:38:38.800]  so weak and you and I have seen you know legal practice with junk science and we
[3:38:38.800 --> 3:38:42.760]  know you know what these phony scientists are who create a big tobacco
[3:38:42.760 --> 3:38:46.760]  right it happens in the oil and this is happening in global warming and now it's
[3:38:46.760 --> 3:38:51.680]  happening in a way that's impacting our kids live this is classic tobacco
[3:38:51.680 --> 3:38:55.680]  science it is junk science and I was looking at these reports and saying this
[3:38:55.680 --> 3:39:00.360]  is the best this is what you rely on they know it's fraudulent and now we have
[3:39:00.360 --> 3:39:04.200]  the transcript explain it to me Bobby okay I mean explain it to me if that's
[3:39:04.200 --> 3:39:09.120]  the case I mean you you and I both know about politics obviously politicians
[3:39:09.120 --> 3:39:13.320]  like to get reelected why are they sitting back and life if our children
[3:39:13.320 --> 3:39:17.160]  are being poisoned if the science is there why are they sitting back and
[3:39:17.160 --> 3:39:23.520]  letting our children be poisoned because the the the the same regulatory
[3:39:23.520 --> 3:39:28.720]  bureaucrats that green-lighted on flight Marisol originally are now trying to
[3:39:28.720 --> 3:39:32.640]  cover their tracks the CYA operation and they're working with the pharmaceutical
[3:39:32.640 --> 3:39:36.720]  industry and we now have the transcripts of this secret meeting that they did in
[3:39:36.720 --> 3:39:41.520]  Simpson with Georgia in the year 2000 and then it's the most horrifying thing
[3:39:41.520 --> 3:39:45.040]  that you can read Joe there's scientists there from the government who are
[3:39:45.040 --> 3:39:49.200]  saying who are reading the reports and saying we get this is undeniable there's
[3:39:49.200 --> 3:39:54.920]  no absolutely what is Robert Kennedy Jr. talking about in 2000 and it's happened
[3:39:54.920 --> 3:40:00.720]  several other times congressmen use congressional power to force CDC to
[3:40:00.720 --> 3:40:04.600]  release secret documents to them and then several congressmen who have brain
[3:40:04.600 --> 3:40:10.240]  damaged children and grandchildren released it even though they weren't
[3:40:10.240 --> 3:40:13.640]  supposed to this was classified and it was the heads of the CDC and the
[3:40:13.640 --> 3:40:17.680]  scientists saying I wouldn't give it to my grandchildren or my kids we've brain
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:25.760]  damaged millions and they say well we got to continue it we can't admit that
[3:40:25.760 --> 3:40:31.840]  we know this does this or we'll all go to prison now they then when that all
[3:40:31.840 --> 3:40:37.200]  came out in 2002 the documents were from 2000 but it took two years for it to
[3:40:37.200 --> 3:40:41.280]  come out it was even on ABC nightly news
[3:40:42.040 --> 3:40:48.560]  since then they've lied and said the mercury was taken out ladies and gentlemen
[3:40:48.560 --> 3:40:53.800]  under federal regulations vaccine makers are supposed to they don't always do
[3:40:53.800 --> 3:41:03.240]  this make a small amount of non-mercury vaccines so that's all that happens yes
[3:41:03.240 --> 3:41:08.600]  are there vaccines without mercury can the news hold up an insert of a vaccine
[3:41:08.600 --> 3:41:12.000]  that might be one percent of that type of vaccine that's out there it's even
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:16.400]  less than that the studies I've seen can you if you're Andrea Merkel of Germany
[3:41:16.400 --> 3:41:22.440]  or Gordon Brown of England or Barack Obama and his daughters of USA can you
[3:41:22.440 --> 3:41:27.000]  get one that doesn't have mercury yes can you go to an office and order it if
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:30.360]  you know what to ask for they can order it you can come back a week later and be
[3:41:30.360 --> 3:41:35.520]  shot up with it it's still got the cancer viruses it still got the RNA it's
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:42.880]  still got the aluminum it's still all these foreign because it's not just the
[3:41:42.880 --> 3:41:46.560]  viruses they're breeding up on caterpillar eggs and baby retinas and
[3:41:46.560 --> 3:41:52.560]  dog kidneys or monkey kidneys that's the main things they use even most of
[3:41:52.560 --> 3:41:56.200]  vaccine you hear about that's grown on eggs the original virus for the
[3:41:56.200 --> 3:42:03.480]  original sample the seed stock is grown in tissue and then it's brought over and
[3:42:03.480 --> 3:42:08.960]  put in eggs but it's growing the same thing you know I mean if I grow squash
[3:42:08.960 --> 3:42:12.800]  plants in a greenhouse and then take those plant seeds out of the greenhouse
[3:42:12.800 --> 3:42:17.320]  and go plant them out in the field or up against a fence row next year it's the
[3:42:17.320 --> 3:42:23.920]  same squash you understand that it's the same watermelons it's the same
[3:42:23.920 --> 3:42:28.280]  blueberries it's it's the same thing it's just their children but the exact
[3:42:28.280 --> 3:42:39.320]  same genetics and they know this they know this they know this and everyone
[3:42:39.320 --> 3:42:44.480]  is waking up now literally the vast majority over 70% in US polls think
[3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:50.960]  it's bad and don't want it but the media goes out and interviews 20 30 40 50
[3:42:50.960 --> 3:42:54.520]  people till they find the one person that will say they like it and they put
[3:42:54.520 --> 3:43:07.520]  them on the news that's who they put on the news that's who they push and let
[3:43:07.520 --> 3:43:11.360]  me give you the news flash four years ago the Associated Press told the truth
[3:43:11.360 --> 3:43:16.680]  and reported and that the article said we don't know why that all the major
[3:43:16.680 --> 3:43:25.720]  vaccine makers for hepatitis for flu for MMR increased mercury they didn't just
[3:43:25.720 --> 3:43:33.280]  put it back in they increased it not one-fold not double not triple not
[3:43:33.280 --> 3:43:41.680]  quadruple five times what the mercury was before so before it was 400 times the
[3:43:41.680 --> 3:43:48.000]  safe level of mercury in a average one year round of shots for a five-year-old
[3:43:48.000 --> 3:43:53.240]  400 times for their body weight not quite as bad with an adult just like a big
[3:43:53.240 --> 3:43:57.920]  guy can drink more beer and not get drunk but for a child imagine a newborn
[3:43:57.920 --> 3:44:01.800]  baby given three shots at birth then six months later five more shots then when
[3:44:01.800 --> 3:44:07.320]  they're 18 months more shots so I see these fake studies by the media and
[3:44:07.320 --> 3:44:10.440]  they're always deceptive five minutes you can prove they're alive going study
[3:44:10.440 --> 3:44:16.720]  shows kids are still getting autism even though mercury's out of the shots but
[3:44:16.720 --> 3:44:20.560]  then you go read the study the study was done with regular vaccines I mean
[3:44:20.560 --> 3:44:26.040]  ladies and gentlemen they lie and they lie and they lie and they lie and they
[3:44:26.040 --> 3:44:32.320]  lie and they lie but the good news here is on the Federal Reserve or on vaccines
[3:44:32.320 --> 3:44:36.120]  or on the war or on warrantless wiretapping or the police state in
[3:44:36.120 --> 3:44:43.640]  every pole the majority way over 70% are against all this we're the people this
[3:44:43.640 --> 3:44:51.240]  is our country you can't make us do all this so the good news is the momentum
[3:44:51.240 --> 3:44:55.840]  shifting so the establishment is firing everything they've got at us in an
[3:44:55.840 --> 3:45:02.160]  attempt to make us capitulate and it's not gonna work the police aren't bad
[3:45:02.160 --> 3:45:06.160]  most the FBI people aren't bad most of them are investigating bank robberies
[3:45:06.160 --> 3:45:10.000]  and kidnappings it's that higher-up groups that are bad most people in
[3:45:10.000 --> 3:45:13.160]  banking aren't bad they're just giving you a home loan it's the big bankers up
[3:45:13.160 --> 3:45:18.040]  at the top most people in Congress aren't bad they're just corrupt and
[3:45:18.040 --> 3:45:22.320]  whores and competitive so they sell out to be in power we have to get the
[3:45:22.320 --> 3:45:27.360]  message out about how bad this is if we continue along this line now listen I'm
[3:45:27.360 --> 3:45:29.960]  gonna come back in the next segment the segment after that and get through this
[3:45:29.960 --> 3:45:35.580]  bank of collars have your questions and comments ready Woody Malcolm Raul Eric
[3:45:35.580 --> 3:45:39.840]  Derek and Hawaiian others but I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up and tomorrow I'm
[3:45:39.840 --> 3:45:46.800]  gonna fish the clip out and play it Ron Paul said they tried to kill gold it
[3:45:46.800 --> 3:45:51.320]  didn't work and that's what mainstream news is reporting they put hundreds of
[3:45:51.320 --> 3:45:55.640]  billions of dollars I think I have the Reuters article in my stack Ted can fill
[3:45:55.640 --> 3:45:59.400]  a sin on it hundreds of billions of dollars with a 200 billion dollar buy
[3:45:59.400 --> 3:46:04.040]  they dump this gold on the market leveraged its trillions thinking it
[3:46:04.040 --> 3:46:10.320]  would drive it down from above a thousand instead it's shot up to 1099 you
[3:46:10.320 --> 3:46:12.920]  heard it from Ron Paul who's an economist I'm just a medical doctor
[3:46:12.920 --> 3:46:17.040]  saying they're gonna lose the war on gold he believes it's only gonna go up I
[3:46:17.040 --> 3:46:22.840]  don't know but all the smart money is on it going up and at least as the dollar
[3:46:22.840 --> 3:46:27.600]  plunges and G20 meets to do it fully they can't kill gold because it's real
[3:46:27.600 --> 3:46:30.960]  they may be able to drive it down for a while doesn't look like that but it will
[3:46:30.960 --> 3:46:34.800]  always beach ball back up like pushing a beach ball the bottom of the pool Ted
[3:46:34.800 --> 3:46:42.320]  take us out to break with what Ron Paul was saying earlier about gold and then
[3:46:42.320 --> 3:46:46.400]  today's gold offer Ted Anderson of minus resources well Alex they've been playing
[3:46:46.400 --> 3:46:51.080]  those tricks I mean going all the way back to the middle 1980s and we went to
[3:46:51.080 --> 3:46:58.160]  our market peak in 1980 where gold hit $800 an ounce silver hit $50 an ounce
[3:46:58.160 --> 3:47:03.880]  and then it started backing off down into 1982 the central banks of the world
[3:47:03.880 --> 3:47:09.320]  unitedly had tried to suppress the market price of gold and keep it below
[3:47:09.320 --> 3:47:14.400]  $400 an ounce for the longest time anybody that wants to have information on
[3:47:14.400 --> 3:47:19.320]  that can find it it's not like it's hidden you can go right over to gata or
[3:47:19.320 --> 3:47:27.240]  gata dot org that's gata dot org now the latest thing is that I mean they do
[3:47:27.240 --> 3:47:32.520]  postings up there for just you know just recently as well and honestly I mean
[3:47:32.520 --> 3:47:37.440]  that's what I mean when I say well that when the gold prices drop down and I'm
[3:47:37.440 --> 3:47:43.200]  able to buy and in those dips usually most of the time that is occurring here
[3:47:43.200 --> 3:47:47.520]  in the New York market and the reason why it's happening is because the Federal
[3:47:47.520 --> 3:47:52.160]  Reserve system has such a heavy interest in seeing the United States dollar
[3:47:52.160 --> 3:47:58.560]  stays strong and gold stays suppressed see it's it's the game of the fiat
[3:47:58.560 --> 3:48:03.080]  currency makers is to try to keep you out of anything that it stands in the way
[3:48:03.080 --> 3:48:08.720]  of of their profit-making machine and I and I have to say that it is one
[3:48:08.720 --> 3:48:14.720]  insidious profit-making machine because they have legal tender laws pointing at
[3:48:14.720 --> 3:48:19.800]  them that allows them to create the currency of the nation and they lend it
[3:48:19.800 --> 3:48:25.080]  to us and we have to serve us interest on that debt now you have to realize what
[3:48:25.080 --> 3:48:28.640]  that means I mean what has our country been doing here for the last at least
[3:48:28.640 --> 3:48:36.120]  30 years is deficit spending so what it where does deficit spending who does it
[3:48:36.120 --> 3:48:41.040]  help and who does it hurt well the United States people have to go into debt to
[3:48:41.040 --> 3:48:45.080]  get the currency and you can see that the United States government has done
[3:48:45.080 --> 3:48:50.560]  nothing but deficit spending and put the taxpayers on on the hook for even more
[3:48:50.560 --> 3:48:55.560]  and more and more of their hard-earned wages and that money eventually filters
[3:48:55.560 --> 3:49:00.800]  right back up to this elite banking system and they have control of the
[3:49:00.800 --> 3:49:05.040]  world I mean when Bill Clinton was in office he would be telling you that this
[3:49:05.040 --> 3:49:07.920]  is going to happen in the economy and that and so on and so forth it was one
[3:49:07.920 --> 3:49:13.080]  of the few surpluses that we ever ran but back then the United States people
[3:49:13.080 --> 3:49:16.920]  were going so far into debt that the government didn't have to you know there
[3:49:16.920 --> 3:49:22.920]  just has never been a time since 1913 that the United States of America has
[3:49:22.920 --> 3:49:29.220]  been able to enjoy prosperity without having the equivalent increase in the
[3:49:29.220 --> 3:49:34.680]  debt and it's so it just puts people on the hook you know just to such an
[3:49:34.680 --> 3:49:38.640]  extreme it's ridiculous and we have the very parasites that have engineered
[3:49:38.640 --> 3:49:44.960]  this not getting in trouble but getting even more power now they're getting the
[3:49:44.960 --> 3:49:48.600]  bailout money Alex we're having to even go further into this to give them the
[3:49:48.600 --> 3:49:53.880]  bailout money which isn't bailout money they're using that to not loan and buy
[3:49:53.880 --> 3:49:56.880]  up real assets and they're bragging about it it's come out of McClatchy
[3:49:56.880 --> 3:50:02.120]  newspapers the Goldman Sachs secretly bet on the US housing crash to bring down
[3:50:02.120 --> 3:50:06.360]  their competitors I mean this is a criminal group Ted tell folks do you
[3:50:06.360 --> 3:50:13.840]  still have gold that you bought the 920 market as it's up in let me say it
[3:50:13.840 --> 3:50:18.400]  this way Alex yes excuse me Ted hold on a second I was getting the numbers wrong
[3:50:18.400 --> 3:50:22.680]  there because I end up talking so fast you get that number right you still have
[3:50:22.680 --> 3:50:27.200]  gold at the 1020 level of when you bought into the market with it now up at
[3:50:27.200 --> 3:50:31.960]  1090 yeah that's exactly what is that's that's that's the way to say it truthfully
[3:50:31.960 --> 3:50:38.720]  I have Frank's currently right now at 238 I've British sovereigns at 293 I have
[3:50:38.720 --> 3:50:43.520]  walking Liberty haves right now at $8.69 and I'm also carrying the
[3:50:43.520 --> 3:50:50.120]  Lakota Nation rounds at $22.30 stay there Ted because I was just thinking
[3:50:50.120 --> 3:50:55.440]  back to two weeks ago when it was at 9 something again 1020 is now a super low
[3:50:55.440 --> 3:51:00.600]  that had bought it and it's up at 1090 I mean just get my mind wrapped around

[3:54:14.320 --> 3:54:18.520]  you heard Ron Paul earlier say that he believes gold's only gonna continue to
[3:54:18.520 --> 3:54:23.360]  explode upward the IMF sells billions and billions in gold trying to drive it
[3:54:23.360 --> 3:54:27.960]  down like they've done the last few years it explodes and I believe Ron Paul's
[3:54:27.960 --> 3:54:34.040]  right they are failing well they admit they're failing to drive it down Ted
[3:54:34.040 --> 3:54:37.600]  again tell people the offer you've got so you've almost run out of gold you
[3:54:37.600 --> 3:54:42.240]  bought at the 1,020 level that sounds high but it's actually low and it's up
[3:54:42.240 --> 3:54:49.040]  at 1,090 right now pushed up to 199 1,099 yesterday fire out the number for
[3:54:49.040 --> 3:54:52.680]  folks that want to call and talk to the brokers and order some silver and gold
[3:54:52.680 --> 3:55:02.760]  coins at great prices yeah the numbers 1-800-686-2237 again it's 1-800-686-2237
[3:55:02.760 --> 3:55:07.320]  and Ron Paul is exactly right they create these little opportunities for me to
[3:55:07.320 --> 3:55:11.360]  buy gold law they sell their gold they try to suppress it they're trying to keep
[3:55:11.360 --> 3:55:15.920]  people away from gold but they are losing in that battle and the reason is
[3:55:15.920 --> 3:55:19.120]  because the world wants to get away from the dollar so every time they start
[3:55:19.120 --> 3:55:23.000]  selling the rest of the world starts buying and because they want to get
[3:55:23.000 --> 3:55:26.960]  rid of their dollars and grab up the gold this is always worked in the past for
[3:55:26.960 --> 3:55:31.460]  them it's not working now folks the globalist are obsessed with gold and
[3:55:31.460 --> 3:55:41.240]  silver you need to get involved 800-686-2237-800-686-2237 I believe
[3:55:41.240 --> 3:55:44.920]  people are insane if they don't take advantage of this offer is anything
[3:55:44.920 --> 3:55:48.800]  perfect no but it's as close as a silver bullet as you're gonna get is silver
[3:55:48.800 --> 3:55:58.320]  and gold 800-686-2237 one more time 800-686-2237 and the brokers can hold

[3:56:30.240 --> 3:56:36.120]  doing my own research and I'd like everybody to look up HR you know 8791
[3:56:36.120 --> 3:56:41.160]  it's a house appropriations bill it's on YouTube you can pull up you can see
[3:56:41.160 --> 3:56:44.880]  the representative from Pennsylvania talk about it and just about every other
[3:56:44.880 --> 3:56:49.880]  word out of his mouth as he's reading his bill is the word classified and it's
[3:56:49.880 --> 3:56:54.680]  homeland security funding appropriations bill and it's designed in the event of
[3:56:54.680 --> 3:56:59.880]  some type of attack all right let me stop you let me stop you there are real
[3:56:59.880 --> 3:57:04.440]  executive orders presidential decision directive 51 John Warner defense
[3:57:04.440 --> 3:57:09.680]  authorization act but what the onion did is they right after that broke last
[3:57:09.680 --> 3:57:15.960]  year and real congressman went to the floor and said basically what the onion
[3:57:15.960 --> 3:57:20.600]  video says the onion newspaper puts out fake news they almost copied it word for
[3:57:20.600 --> 3:57:26.080]  word and put the onion on it to discredit it so that's not real but in the
[3:57:26.080 --> 3:57:32.640]  Obama deception we have the real clips of them talking about that so I get these
[3:57:32.640 --> 3:57:38.320]  calls every week down and people put flu executive order on it again to fool
[3:57:38.320 --> 3:57:42.920]  people look at the lower right hand corner there's an onion there do you
[3:57:42.920 --> 3:57:47.920]  know about the onion newspaper yes so saying you're not bad Woody they just
[3:57:47.920 --> 3:57:52.280]  fooled you this is the type of diabolical crap they do and I appreciate
[3:57:52.280 --> 3:57:59.120]  your call here we have John Warner defense authorization act PDD 51 for
[3:57:59.120 --> 3:58:04.480]  martial law the president to become a dictator all these real congressman

[3:58:10.200 --> 3:58:18.480]  it talking about real things and then all anyone talks about is the onion with
[3:58:18.480 --> 3:58:23.880]  its fake and that's what Cohen tell pro does I'm not saying the onions go and
[3:58:23.880 --> 3:58:27.000]  tell pro but they might as well get a paycheck from the government because
[3:58:27.000 --> 3:58:31.880]  now anytime you talk about martial law legislation that's public no one will
[3:58:31.880 --> 3:58:36.720]  look at it they'll pull the onion up throw it right in your face that's how
