[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.240 --> 00:23.360]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome to the Alex
[00:23.360 --> 00:29.560]  Jones show I'm David Knight your host today we have a jam-packed show on this 1st of July
[00:29.560 --> 00:35.920]  2014 you know we're coming up to the 4th of July this weekend and I just saw a story on
[00:35.920 --> 00:42.120]  the BBC internet billionaire Nick Hanauer warns of a coming revolution that's right it wasn't
[00:42.120 --> 00:48.960]  just 1776 it's going to be coming again the question is will it be a peaceful or a violent
[00:48.960 --> 00:55.360]  revolution will it be a revolution that results in more individual freedom or in an authoritarian
[00:55.360 --> 01:00.520]  police state now he had some interesting things to say we're going to talk about that he says
[01:00.520 --> 01:06.280]  that if they don't fix some of the problems the pitchforks are going to come out they certainly
[01:06.280 --> 01:10.920]  are I don't necessarily agree with his solution but we're going to talk about that and of course
[01:10.920 --> 01:16.240]  we're going to also have in this edition today we're going to be talking to author Peter van
[01:16.240 --> 01:20.920]  Buren now he's not only an author of a couple of books he was somebody who worked at the State
[01:20.920 --> 01:26.640]  Department for a couple of decades and so we want to talk to him about his book which is the
[01:26.640 --> 01:35.080]  ghost of Tom Joe the story of the 99% you may remember that name Tom Joe that's the main
[01:35.080 --> 01:39.040]  character from the grapes of wrath if you remember the movie that was a character that was played
[01:39.040 --> 01:47.120]  by Henry Fonda and so he kind of brings that into a more contemporary setting instead of it
[01:47.120 --> 01:54.640]  being set in the depression it's set in middle America going into the from the 1950s to the
[01:54.640 --> 02:01.400]  current day instead of the rust so the dust bowl we've got the rust belt that he's talking about
[02:01.400 --> 02:06.880]  so that's going to be an interesting interview because he spent a lot of time in Iraq and it
[02:06.880 --> 02:13.560]  was just Sunday that the New York Times specifically James Ryzen started talking about how black
[02:13.560 --> 02:19.480]  water guards in the embassy there in Iraq were essentially doing whatever they wished and even
[02:19.480 --> 02:24.960]  threatening State Department investigators threatening to kill them saying this is a rock
[02:24.960 --> 02:34.720]  I can kill you if I want to and no one could or would do anything about it we're in Iraq that was
[02:34.720 --> 02:41.440]  what the black water people there told the State Department investigators and shortly after that
[02:41.440 --> 02:49.880]  we had that massacre of 17 civilians including a nine-year-old boy and a public square they're
[02:49.880 --> 02:57.040]  now being investigated for murder but it I want to talk to him about what happened and what what
[02:57.040 --> 03:00.960]  he saw there in Iraq so that's going to be a very interesting interview we got Paul Joseph Watson
[03:00.960 --> 03:06.640]  joining us at the bottom of this hour he's going to be talking about the new revelation from the
[03:06.640 --> 03:10.480]  mainstream media we've been telling you about it for a long time but I guess you can believe it
[03:10.480 --> 03:16.640]  now because Charlie Rose says so it's kind of like the old get smart series and always says
[03:16.640 --> 03:21.400]  would you believe is not that we're lying that's what he was doing when he was doing it is that
[03:21.400 --> 03:28.600]  people won't believe us unless it's coming from CBS or PBS or NBC or some other mainstream media
[03:28.600 --> 03:35.560]  well now they're openly talking about how they're using LED lights to monitor people yeah it's no
[03:35.560 --> 03:41.640]  longer a tenfoil hat issue and it never was we knew the technology was there just as we knew that
[03:41.640 --> 03:47.200]  people were looking at you through your laptops people laughed at Alex Jones for a long time about
[03:47.200 --> 03:52.160]  saying that they were spying on us now it's common knowledge and many people are just pushing back
[03:52.160 --> 03:56.640]  and saying so what we're going to talk about the implications of that with Paul Joseph Watson he
[03:56.640 --> 04:03.520]  has a story up he also has a story up about how people get used to living in slavery that's an
[04:03.520 --> 04:08.040]  amazing story so we're going to go over that article from Paul Joseph Watson we have another
[04:08.040 --> 04:13.400]  story here police arrest a paraplegic man for considering himself to be a pedestrian and
[04:13.400 --> 04:20.680]  it's not just that they arrested him they threw him out of his wheelchair face on the ground when
[04:20.680 --> 04:26.560]  he refused to stand up say the problem is he's in a wheelchair as he explained to them because he
[04:26.560 --> 04:32.240]  is paralyzed from the chest down and so that's what we see happening here we've also got some
[04:32.240 --> 04:37.920]  updates on this tea party defeat in Mississippi we now have a Mississippi Democrat Party officials
[04:37.920 --> 04:43.480]  who are admitting that the Cochrane team wanted help in stealing the election stay with us we're
[04:43.480 --> 04:48.320]  going to be right back we're going to have reports from Alex Jones on agenda 21 as well so stay

[08:18.400 --> 08:24.480]  show i'm david night your host on this july first two thousand fourteen now tomorrow is
[08:24.480 --> 08:28.320]  july the second and you know one of the ways that you might want to celebrate the fourth
[08:28.320 --> 08:33.960]  of july weekend is go check out a new movie from dinesh to susan he's been a guest on
[08:33.960 --> 08:38.160]  the alex jones show talking about this movie talking about how he's being persecuted by
[08:38.160 --> 08:44.960]  the obama administration because you know they do come after anyone who they don't like
[08:44.960 --> 08:51.280]  think about the espionage act of nineteen seventeen for ninety two years it was used
[08:51.280 --> 08:56.720]  three times from presidents woodrow wilson all the way up to obama then within five
[08:56.720 --> 09:01.880]  years he's used it six times mostly against journalists i was just talking before the
[09:01.880 --> 09:07.000]  break about that story that was broken by the new york times sunday by james ryzen talking
[09:07.000 --> 09:12.800]  about how blackwater felt that they were free to threaten any state department investigators
[09:12.800 --> 09:17.680]  said i can kill you and there's nothing that anyone could or would do about it because
[09:17.680 --> 09:23.320]  this is iraq this is the attitude of blackwater and that was just a couple of weeks before
[09:23.320 --> 09:28.480]  the massacre of seventeen civilians we're gonna be talking to peter van buren a state
[09:28.480 --> 09:34.600]  department official who worked for them for a couple of decades and he was there shortly
[09:34.600 --> 09:38.960]  before that time so i want to get his feeling on what's going on in iraq right now what
[09:38.960 --> 09:44.960]  was it like to be in that kind of a work environment uh... they're at the embassy in bagdad and
[09:44.960 --> 09:49.480]  of course when he started writing about the failed policies of the state department they
[09:49.480 --> 09:55.040]  attacked him just like they did the next to susan they came after him initially because
[09:55.040 --> 10:00.800]  he'd linked to something that was put up at wiki leaks he didn't leak information he
[10:00.800 --> 10:06.360]  linked to it and many people believe that that was a trial balloon for what they would
[10:06.360 --> 10:12.760]  later to do later due to journalist barrett braring so this is uh... an important trend
[10:12.760 --> 10:16.600]  that we see of course they're coming after the next to susan they will find anything
[10:16.600 --> 10:22.740]  that they can come after somebody about whether it's using the irs or the fec uh... or whether
[10:22.740 --> 10:27.120]  not they're going to uh... claim that it's national security coming after someone but
[10:27.120 --> 10:32.120]  the next to susan's movie is coming out tomorrow and there's an article by drum coursey another
[10:32.120 --> 10:37.120]  frequent guest here uh... valox is on the radio show saying that the left is coming
[10:37.120 --> 10:41.680]  out screaming against his movie before it comes out they want to uh... give it a lot
[10:41.680 --> 10:45.800]  of attention because his previous movie was the second most popular political documentary
[10:45.800 --> 10:51.280]  of all time earning thirty three million dollars so they want to shoot this down before it
[10:51.280 --> 10:55.320]  comes out as course he says the political left is coming out screaming and with guns
[10:55.320 --> 11:02.480]  blazing in an attempt to dampen the audience for the highly anticipated film america this
[11:02.480 --> 11:08.920]  is what one of the guys said this guy's name is a romero he writes for the day romano sorry
[11:08.920 --> 11:15.960]  he writes for the daily beast and he said uh... the susan is a conservative provocateur and
[11:15.960 --> 11:21.040]  romano said that he lacked the space to dispute every specious point that the susan makes
[11:21.040 --> 11:26.160]  in america or to highlight every bit of nonsensical sophistry he employs in order to mask the
[11:26.160 --> 11:30.440]  emptiness of his so-called reasoning well there you go you know he says he's just throwing
[11:30.440 --> 11:36.480]  factoids against the wall but he doesn't have the time to address those factoids so he just
[11:36.480 --> 11:43.760]  doesn't have the space to refute it so he just calls him uh... names just says his arguments
[11:43.760 --> 11:48.080]  are just specious and i don't i don't have room to refute them he doesn't even try to
[11:48.080 --> 11:55.080]  address them he calls them factoids instead of facts it's the language that they use they
[11:55.080 --> 12:00.600]  always come at you with the language i thought there was an interesting link on dredge today
[12:00.600 --> 12:05.240]  the language of despotism this came out of the hoover institute and one of the things
[12:05.240 --> 12:09.880]  this article says they go back they say it's not just orwell in nineteen eighty four they
[12:09.880 --> 12:14.840]  said uh... there was a a greek writer who said uh... that words have to change their
[12:14.840 --> 12:20.440]  ordinary meaning and to take that which was now given them in order to control people
[12:20.440 --> 12:25.240]  orwell went on to say politics in the english language he said political speech and writing
[12:25.240 --> 12:30.040]  are largely the defense of the indefensible and they give a couple of examples in this
[12:30.040 --> 12:35.080]  article they talk about how we've had the term affirmative action uh... that's been
[12:35.080 --> 12:41.040]  replaced with race sensitive admissions and he says but affirmative action was itself
[12:41.040 --> 12:45.880]  a euphemism for racial quotas in the use of college admissions until they were struck
[12:45.880 --> 12:52.800]  down by the supreme court case in nineteen seventy eight baki to salvage racial discrimination
[12:52.800 --> 12:57.240]  which any process gives race and advantage necessarily requires baki legitimized yet
[12:57.240 --> 13:03.400]  another euphemism diversity after a compelling state interest that had justified taking race
[13:03.400 --> 13:09.400]  into account in the university admissions so they use those terms and we now here's
[13:09.400 --> 13:11.200]  a question for you
[13:11.200 --> 13:14.040]  uh... one more example he's got here before i get that
[13:14.040 --> 13:18.040]  in two thousand nine of course or thirteen people killed at fort hood
[13:18.040 --> 13:19.960]  by a muslim army major
[13:19.960 --> 13:24.660]  and that's still classified as quote workplace violence
[13:24.660 --> 13:26.480]  workplace violence
[13:26.480 --> 13:28.080]  here's a pop quiz
[13:28.080 --> 13:31.440]  what other term do you hear in the news every day
[13:31.440 --> 13:34.080]  that is propaganda
[13:34.080 --> 13:35.480]  time's up
[13:35.480 --> 13:37.560]  undocumented immigrants
[13:37.560 --> 13:41.320]  undocumented immigrants see that illegal aliens are not illegal
[13:41.320 --> 13:43.840]  and they're not from another country
[13:43.840 --> 13:47.720]  immigrants they're now living here and they just don't have their documentation yet but
[13:47.720 --> 13:48.600]  of course
[13:48.600 --> 13:52.720]  the city of new york and other places are going to offer them
[13:52.720 --> 13:57.520]  five million dollars to defend them to provide documentation for them everything
[13:57.520 --> 14:01.240]  from library cards to every other form of idea and i'm sure they'll
[14:01.240 --> 14:04.720]  find a way to get them in as voters because
[14:04.720 --> 14:08.600]  this is one of the things that this collapse of the border is about
[14:08.600 --> 14:11.440]  is a massive gerrymandering
[14:11.440 --> 14:15.640]  on steroids because you know always with gerrymandering they've made a fine
[14:15.640 --> 14:17.520]  art of going into
[14:17.520 --> 14:22.280]  uh... estate and creating the districts where they go in and look at the
[14:22.280 --> 14:25.040]  demographics on the computer
[14:25.040 --> 14:28.760]  voter by voter i remember when i lived in north carolina they had uh... one
[14:28.760 --> 14:29.840]  district that was
[14:29.840 --> 14:33.200]  jumping across the street back and forth to try to get uh...
[14:33.200 --> 14:36.160]  the political party that they wanted i think at that time it was a democrats
[14:36.160 --> 14:38.440]  course both of the political parties do that
[14:38.440 --> 14:42.200]  now instead of using computers to pick which voters you want in which
[14:42.200 --> 14:46.760]  districts they're just going to import the four voters into the areas that they
[14:46.760 --> 14:48.680]  want you know bring them into
[14:48.680 --> 14:51.640]  california bring them into new york
[14:51.640 --> 14:53.880]  and uh... we've got a
[14:53.880 --> 14:57.600]  clip from one of the places in california guys can you cue this up we
[14:57.600 --> 14:59.760]  have a uh... mayor
[14:59.760 --> 15:03.480]  in california and he's talking about how
[15:03.480 --> 15:06.880]  the immigrants are going to be brought in
[15:06.880 --> 15:12.720]  about a hundred and forty every seventy two hours from texas
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.200]  and the people are not very happy about it at this town meeting can you guys
[15:17.200 --> 15:19.440]  play that
[15:19.440 --> 15:23.640]  what we have told that most of these immigrants are families these are
[15:23.640 --> 15:27.760]  mothers and young children or fathers and young children the mayor tried to
[15:27.760 --> 15:32.480]  reassure constituents their safety is not in jeopardy but his words did little
[15:32.480 --> 15:34.760]  to suit a heated crowd
[15:34.760 --> 15:36.440]  i'd like to know sir
[15:36.440 --> 15:40.840]  do we have a plan and i'd like to know what that plan is in the event
[15:40.840 --> 15:43.600]  that these people are starting to be dumped over now
[15:43.600 --> 15:48.840]  i'm sorry i don't feel our officials and i apologize everybody are being really honest
[15:48.840 --> 15:52.600]  federal immigration officials say the immigrants processed in myrietta are
[15:52.600 --> 15:54.760]  unlikely to stay in the area
[15:54.760 --> 15:57.740]  what will happen is once they're processed by the board of patrol
[15:57.740 --> 16:01.360]  they will be released to ice agents who will make sure they get to their uh...
[16:01.360 --> 16:02.520]  destination
[16:02.520 --> 16:04.840]  and or uh... transportation hubs
[16:04.840 --> 16:08.680]  mary at his mayor says this first group of a hundred and forty people maybe the
[16:08.680 --> 16:09.920]  tip of the iceberg
[16:09.920 --> 16:13.720]  he says it's possible that every seventy two hours another group of about a
[16:13.720 --> 16:16.720]  hundred and forty undocumented immigrants will be coming here for
[16:16.720 --> 16:19.280]  processing at this facility
[16:19.280 --> 16:22.840]  that's right they don't feel like they're being told the truth well
[16:22.840 --> 16:24.360]  guess what they did we
[16:24.360 --> 16:28.480]  we have a story up on info wars from uh... don salazar's been picked up by the
[16:28.480 --> 16:31.640]  drug report two more swine flu cases confirmed
[16:31.640 --> 16:33.840]  among minor detainees
[16:33.840 --> 16:36.840]  and uh... this is something that broke over the weekend we had two additional
[16:36.840 --> 16:39.740]  cases of swine flu virus were confirmed
[16:39.740 --> 16:42.920]  amongst the central american illegal immigrant minors
[16:42.920 --> 16:46.120]  this is information came to us from the president of the uh... local
[16:46.120 --> 16:50.040]  border patrol union he said both cases involving juveniles were confirmed on
[16:50.040 --> 16:50.880]  friday
[16:50.880 --> 16:53.280]  by medical personnel located at the facility
[16:53.280 --> 16:55.720]  he also said about a hundred and twenty people
[16:55.720 --> 16:58.440]  have been isolated due to exposure with the
[16:58.440 --> 17:02.440]  with the afflicted juveniles and then on sunday he said two more children
[17:02.440 --> 17:05.840]  at the border patrol station in brownsville were also isolated although
[17:05.840 --> 17:07.480]  they have not confirmed
[17:07.480 --> 17:11.280]  that those are h one n one swine flu viruses yet
[17:11.280 --> 17:13.400]  this is his comment this is what the
[17:13.400 --> 17:17.840]  guy who is talking to us at the north of the national border patrol council
[17:17.840 --> 17:20.240]  uh... said it is contagious
[17:20.240 --> 17:23.520]  and we're transporting people to different parts of the state
[17:23.520 --> 17:27.560]  and two different parts of the country and you hear people in california say
[17:27.560 --> 17:31.040]  what's going on they're sending a hundred and forty people about every seventy
[17:31.040 --> 17:32.880]  two hours you heard the mayor say
[17:32.880 --> 17:38.240]  and then ice is going to transport them farther into the country and that was
[17:38.240 --> 17:39.720]  his point he said
[17:39.720 --> 17:43.800]  these minors are being kept in overcrowded facilities ridden with poor
[17:43.800 --> 17:48.480]  hygiene this is the ideal condition for a viral outbreak
[17:48.480 --> 17:51.600]  that was just yesterday i talk to dr stanley mon teeth on the show and he
[17:51.600 --> 17:52.880]  was talking about how
[17:52.880 --> 17:55.480]  when hiv was first discovered
[17:55.480 --> 18:00.080]  that it was treated not as a contagious disease people were not told how to
[18:00.080 --> 18:04.360]  avoid exposure to it we didn't do anything the cdc would not do anything to
[18:04.360 --> 18:07.380]  stop exposure to it or to help people to stop exposure to it
[18:07.380 --> 18:10.160]  no it was treated as a political issue
[18:10.160 --> 18:12.200]  and so now we have not just
[18:12.200 --> 18:13.960]  hiv because
[18:13.960 --> 18:17.200]  it was also they said there's increasing worries about immigrants hailing from
[18:17.200 --> 18:22.120]  on her from honduras that could be affected with hiv it's not just hiv
[18:22.120 --> 18:23.680]  it's a whole slew
[18:23.680 --> 18:26.680]  of diseases that have been identified
[18:26.680 --> 18:28.960]  but of course as we also reported
[18:28.960 --> 18:33.480]  the cdc has no interest in this these border officials
[18:33.480 --> 18:38.600]  a border patrol union has contacted the cdc asked them for help they said
[18:38.600 --> 18:39.960]  not our job
[18:39.960 --> 18:41.920]  not their job
[18:41.920 --> 18:44.720]  now one of the things behind this of course is we would like to get people
[18:44.720 --> 18:46.880]  to understand is that this is about
[18:46.880 --> 18:50.480]  making nafta a fact as patreus said
[18:50.480 --> 18:53.640]  this is something that was passed twenty years ago they passed nafta
[18:53.640 --> 18:57.640]  the laws have been on the books now they're making it an established fact it
[18:57.640 --> 19:00.440]  was the law de jour now is becoming
[19:00.440 --> 19:03.840]  de facto they're making an accomplished fact one of the things that he said in
[19:03.840 --> 19:06.800]  that speech we said what comes after america well that's simple
[19:06.800 --> 19:10.600]  north america he means north american union and he made it very clear that was
[19:10.600 --> 19:12.040]  what he meant
[19:12.040 --> 19:14.840]  he was talking about how the demographics and all these other
[19:14.840 --> 19:16.960]  countries are falling
[19:16.960 --> 19:20.520]  and europe even in china and other places in asia and yet
[19:20.520 --> 19:22.960]  in north america they're increasing
[19:22.960 --> 19:26.720]  it's like really really are they really increasing u.s. news and world report says
[19:26.720 --> 19:28.080]  today that america's
[19:28.080 --> 19:33.080]  evolving look census shows that white deaths are outpacing births
[19:33.080 --> 19:38.160]  okay not happening they're bringing people and for that demographic increase
[19:38.160 --> 19:40.760]  and yet in the same speech he talks about how they're going to have to get
[19:40.760 --> 19:41.640]  along with
[19:41.640 --> 19:44.920]  fewer people working they're not looking at that for the long term they're not
[19:44.920 --> 19:45.840]  bringing them in

[24:23.760 --> 24:28.280]  now learned from charlie rose who of course we can now trust him even though
[24:28.280 --> 24:33.240]  alex has been telling you this for a very long time that your led lights can
[24:33.240 --> 24:40.160]  be used to track you to spy on you even to determine if you've got firearms how
[24:40.160 --> 24:45.280]  about that no paranoia there because that's charlie rose and we can believe
[24:45.280 --> 24:51.840]  anything he has to say also an amazing article about a guy who lived in a
[24:51.840 --> 24:57.520]  prison and lived as a slave in north korea and how he can't get his head
[24:57.520 --> 25:02.200]  around being free it kind of liked his slavery so we're going to talk about that
[25:02.200 --> 25:06.120]  with paul joseph watson alex jones also has a special report coming up in the
[25:06.120 --> 25:10.560]  second hour on agenda twenty one you won't want to miss that special report
[25:10.560 --> 25:14.560]  and we're going to be talking to peter van buren somebody who for twenty three
[25:14.560 --> 25:19.720]  years worked for the state department he was talking after he'd left the state
[25:19.720 --> 25:24.320]  department about how ineffective things were in iraq so we want to talk to him
[25:24.320 --> 25:29.240]  and get his take as someone who's been there who's been fairly high up in the
[25:29.240 --> 25:33.600]  state department get his take on what is going on now in iraq and also what we
[25:33.600 --> 25:38.680]  just learned on sunday about how black water was threatening state department
[25:38.680 --> 25:42.280]  investigators threatening to kill them saying there's nothing you can or will
[25:42.280 --> 25:46.200]  do about this because we're in iraq we can do whatever we wish and that was
[25:46.200 --> 25:50.880]  just a couple of weeks before they had the now infamous massacre of seventeen
[25:50.880 --> 25:56.280]  civilians and public area there in iraq including a nine-year-old yesterday we
[25:56.280 --> 26:03.760]  had a supreme court decision about the hobby lobby about the mandate and it was
[26:03.760 --> 26:12.400]  a clash of can the government force us to violate our religious convictions and
[26:12.400 --> 26:17.200]  of course the left was saying well this is a corporation because this family
[26:17.200 --> 26:22.000]  business decided to incorporate now they no longer have any religious freedom the
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.960]  supreme court said no actually they do and the supreme court I believe made the
[26:26.960 --> 26:32.840]  right decision now of course we had in the dissent we had some female justices
[26:32.840 --> 26:39.840]  were very angry about this the justice Jen Ginsburg said well we're going to
[26:39.840 --> 26:44.120]  have a situation now we're just anyone any corporation or anyone can assert
[26:44.120 --> 26:49.040]  they have religious objections it's like yeah yeah that's what the first
[26:49.040 --> 26:53.920]  amendment is about she thought that was just too radical of an idea she actually
[26:53.920 --> 26:58.760]  used that I that word she said it was too radical we saw that supreme court
[26:58.760 --> 27:06.080]  justice Kagan said that you can't do this Congress gave an entitlement they
[27:06.080 --> 27:12.520]  made a law well the first amendment says Congress shall make no law abridging
[27:12.520 --> 27:18.560]  the free exercise of religion the exercise of religion these are not just
[27:18.560 --> 27:23.600]  convictions that we hold quietly in the closet and of course there's been a lot
[27:23.600 --> 27:29.160]  of reactions to this and a lot of hate calling for Hobby Lobby to be boycotted
[27:29.160 --> 27:33.800]  many people calling for violence calling for it to be burned down of course
[27:33.800 --> 27:37.960]  doesn't look like the government's worried about that they would be all
[27:37.960 --> 27:41.480]  over it if somebody was talking about burning down the White House but you
[27:41.480 --> 27:44.720]  can talk about burning down people's private property and their businesses and
[27:44.720 --> 27:49.280]  evidently that's not a problem this I thought was interesting along the same
[27:49.280 --> 27:54.920]  line we see that in Canada small town city council has canceled an event at a
[27:54.920 --> 27:58.320]  city-owned facility last month after learning that the event was going to be
[27:58.320 --> 28:03.440]  sponsored in part by Chick-fil-A this is a town about 85,000 people it was going
[28:03.440 --> 28:07.960]  to be a an event that was going to be leased out to a Georgia based leadership
[28:07.960 --> 28:12.040]  organization there in Nanaimo British Columbia I believe is the way it's
[28:12.040 --> 28:17.680]  pronounced and this is what the city council person said he said any events
[28:17.680 --> 28:20.680]  that are associated with organizations or people that promote or have a
[28:20.680 --> 28:27.800]  history of divisiveness homophobia or expressions of hate hate I didn't know
[28:27.800 --> 28:31.840]  that Chick-fil-A was about hate will not be permitted by the city and then he went
[28:31.840 --> 28:36.400]  on to say to compare them to organized crime he said I think that Chick-fil-A's
[28:36.400 --> 28:41.440]  beliefs are almost to a criminal point of view this day and age yes they nearly
[28:41.440 --> 28:46.200]  have criminalized any dissent with the state religion and when he compares it
[28:46.200 --> 28:50.400]  to organized crime we need to realize that if we don't stand for due process
[28:50.400 --> 28:55.200]  for even the worst people even somebody you don't like then you're going to lose
[28:55.200 --> 28:59.640]  it for yourself the Rico statutes were initially created because they couldn't
[28:59.640 --> 29:03.000]  get convictions against organized crime and it wasn't too long before they were
[29:03.000 --> 29:09.000]  using it against abortion protesters this is the kind of slippery slope we
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.160]  see and now it's gotten to the point where they feel like they can go in and
[29:12.160 --> 29:16.320]  confiscate the assets of people we just had a case where a couple who was
[29:16.320 --> 29:22.560]  accused of stealing medical devices took out a loan on their home and the
[29:22.560 --> 29:26.200]  government came in and confiscated their funds from that loan that they'd gotten
[29:26.200 --> 29:29.880]  out to defend themselves so now they're left defenseless and they justified it
[29:29.880 --> 29:34.560]  in the same way that they justified attacking organized crime and taking
[29:34.560 --> 29:38.600]  away their due process we have to stand for that even for the worst in society
[29:38.600 --> 29:42.920]  or we wind up with this kind of political correctness and tyranny we'll be right
[29:42.920 --> 29:49.960]  back with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK stay with us we're on the march the

[31:27.800 --> 31:31.840]  that is found in water supplies worldwide. Remove pesticides, herbicides,
[31:31.840 --> 31:37.160]  chloramines, hydrofluorosilic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate. It is
[31:37.160 --> 31:40.640]  intense and coffee it's in water it's in breads and toothpaste. It is our
[31:40.640 --> 31:44.280]  responsibility to protect our families. The establishment is not going to do it.

[32:32.880 --> 32:38.680]  had have been life-changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure

[35:38.960 --> 35:44.720]  good to be back it's good to have you on here you had a interesting article here
[35:44.720 --> 35:48.400]  and it was very interesting to hear what they had to say of course Alex has been
[35:48.400 --> 35:51.880]  talking about this info wars has been talking about this for a long time but
[35:51.880 --> 35:56.920]  now we see that the mainstream media doesn't want to ignore this anymore do
[35:56.920 --> 36:02.680]  they about the LED lights yeah this is basically a product placement by CBS
[36:02.680 --> 36:06.000]  News talking about these new smart LED lights which are being rolled out in
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.200]  major cities across the US Las Vegas last year also New York's rolling them out
[36:11.200 --> 36:17.040]  basically they touted the environmental benefits of saving energy saving money
[36:17.040 --> 36:22.600]  with these new LED lights they kind of gave some token credence to the
[36:22.600 --> 36:28.560]  privacy concerns while skirting around them and basically the CBS anchor says
[36:28.560 --> 36:33.240]  that these new smart streetlights which as he said we reported years ago through
[36:33.240 --> 36:37.080]  IntelliStreets which is a different company introducing them will have the
[36:37.080 --> 36:41.240]  ability eventually to track everything we do all the time because what they
[36:41.240 --> 36:46.880]  don't tell you in the CBS News report is the fact that they can record and store
[36:46.880 --> 36:52.320]  actual conversations you're walking down the street the streetlight picks up
[36:52.320 --> 36:56.760]  your conversation stores it no doubt in an NSA database that's what they didn't
[36:56.760 --> 37:00.400]  tell you in the CBS report it was basically a product placement for these
[37:00.400 --> 37:04.840]  new spying systems masquerading as lights let's play a little bit of that
[37:04.840 --> 37:08.120]  report here it's a little bit too long for us to play the entire part of it
[37:08.120 --> 37:11.440]  let's play a little bit of that report from CBS this morning
[37:11.440 --> 37:16.040]  you find yourself in terminal B at Newark Airport look up those aren't just new
[37:16.040 --> 37:20.520]  lights they're smart lights a sophisticated array of LED fixtures with
[37:20.520 --> 37:25.560]  built-in sensors and cameras connected over a wireless network they monitor
[37:25.560 --> 37:30.400]  security the flow of foot traffic Newark's primarily interested in energy
[37:30.400 --> 37:34.000]  savings you Martin is president of sensitive yeah it's all about saving
[37:34.000 --> 37:38.120]  value company that developed the smart lights at Newark and this parking garage
[37:38.120 --> 37:46.240]  in San Jose so these lights they sense that we're walking yeah there's a motion
[37:46.240 --> 37:51.480]  sensor in each individual light what does this do as far as energy this week
[37:51.480 --> 37:58.560]  we saved about 3,500 over 182 thousand dollars a year in energy saved just from
[37:58.560 --> 38:03.960]  this across the globe cities are phasing out old energy wasting incandescent
[38:03.960 --> 38:09.240]  sodium bulbs and replacing that's good yeah it's not about saving energy you
[38:09.240 --> 38:14.920]  can save energy if you've just got an LED bulb but they're talking about watching
[38:14.920 --> 38:19.120]  you about tracking you and they even show in that report they talk about how
[38:19.120 --> 38:23.160]  they're using it for security in a private corporation's parking lot and
[38:23.160 --> 38:26.640]  they say this is tracking you everywhere you go and as you just pointed out Paul
[38:26.640 --> 38:31.240]  they're recording it so I don't think if you're if you're tracking people you've
[38:31.240 --> 38:34.960]  got all these other devices there and you're recording stuff that I guess
[38:34.960 --> 38:38.200]  really kind of hurt your energy savings a little bit doesn't it but it's really
[38:38.200 --> 38:42.400]  not about energy savings no it's I mean in the report they also talk about
[38:42.400 --> 38:46.720]  license plate tracking so it has very little to do with energy savings and
[38:46.720 --> 38:50.680]  everything to do with surveillance and you know we ask commonly what is the
[38:50.680 --> 38:54.200]  ultimate goal of surveillance it's not about the surveillance itself it's about
[38:54.200 --> 38:59.040]  cultivating the fear amongst the general public that everything they do is under
[38:59.040 --> 39:02.520]  ubiquitous surveillance yeah so it goes back to what we've talked about before
[39:02.520 --> 39:07.360]  which is the panopticon effect you know what Foucault talked about in discipline
[39:07.360 --> 39:11.280]  and punish which is that those who believe they are being watched will do
[39:11.280 --> 39:17.200]  what is wanted of them obedient compliance without even realizing that
[39:17.200 --> 39:21.120]  they're being controlled and that's that's the whole idea it's about creating
[39:21.120 --> 39:26.400]  this compulsion to obedience it's about institutions institutionalizing the
[39:26.400 --> 39:30.120]  whole idea of you know don't stick your neck out don't talk about politics don't
[39:30.120 --> 39:34.280]  exercise your freedoms don't deviate from the received wisdom of the
[39:34.280 --> 39:38.440]  establishment because big brother is always watching that's the ultimate goal
[39:38.440 --> 39:43.680]  of surveillance as we've explained many times and the real freedom is to say I
[39:43.680 --> 39:48.400]  don't care I don't care if you're watching me I'm going to do it anyway and
[39:48.400 --> 39:52.720]  that's that the attitude that people need to adopt they're they constantly are
[39:52.720 --> 39:56.920]  talking about Orwell in this piece they throw it out several times and I thought
[39:56.920 --> 40:01.960]  it was interesting that at the very end where this reporter says to the guy that
[40:01.960 --> 40:06.960]  the people heard there at the beginning this is kind of Orwellian isn't it and
[40:06.960 --> 40:10.960]  he comes back and immediately says well wouldn't you want to protect your
[40:10.960 --> 40:16.400]  children if this could determine that somebody had a gun on them near a school
[40:16.400 --> 40:19.680]  so as you're pointing out they're looking at license plates they're
[40:19.680 --> 40:23.240]  connecting it to a database they bragged about how this was going to be a
[40:23.240 --> 40:28.160]  global system and then at the very end he's talking about scanning to see if
[40:28.160 --> 40:31.920]  somebody's got a gun on them and of course it's all about the children isn't
[40:31.920 --> 40:35.240]  it Paul they always do that whether it's destroying our borders or destroying
[40:35.240 --> 40:40.200]  our rights it's all about children it's always the beard it sounds rather Orwellian
[40:40.200 --> 40:46.880]  here's at least the parents of kids at a school feel better if they knew that
[40:46.880 --> 40:52.160]  there was a analytic that looks for objects that could be guns on people
[40:52.160 --> 40:55.560]  that were coming into the school yeah there you go wouldn't that be a good
[40:55.560 --> 40:59.760]  thing wouldn't that be a good thing so it's always for the kids isn't it just
[40:59.760 --> 41:04.280]  like you know DHS attaching RFID tags to children because they really care about
[41:04.280 --> 41:07.760]  the kids oh yeah but it's not about we know what it's about because we've
[41:07.760 --> 41:11.320]  seen the history we've seen the pattern we've seen where it's going there have
[41:11.320 --> 41:17.680]  been studies for example Stanford University 1975 study which illustrated
[41:17.680 --> 41:22.080]  that participants will side with the establishment position on political
[41:22.080 --> 41:26.280]  arguments like legalizing marijuana if they think their responses are going to
[41:26.280 --> 41:31.440]  be seen by authorities there are other studies which show that people writers
[41:31.440 --> 41:37.800]  are more reluctant to talk about political subjects 25% because they
[41:37.800 --> 41:41.320]  fear that it will be picked up in their emails in their phone conversations with
[41:41.320 --> 41:45.360]  their friends so a quarter of Americans at least that are subjected to this
[41:45.360 --> 41:50.120]  panopticon effect where you self-censor you self-regulate not only your free
[41:50.120 --> 41:54.440]  speech but your behavior and the exercise of your freedoms which of course
[41:54.440 --> 41:58.520]  only benefits the establishment only benefits the state which is one of the
[41:58.520 --> 42:02.520]  major reasons why they're rolling out this huge surveillance network that's
[42:02.520 --> 42:06.840]  right you have to get over that hump you have to get to the point where you say
[42:06.840 --> 42:11.920]  I'm going to speak out about this anyway whatever the consequences and then at
[42:11.920 --> 42:16.280]  that point you're in you're in and now you're free to say whatever you want to
[42:16.280 --> 42:20.800]  to criticize this to speak up for your freedoms talking about that panopticon
[42:20.800 --> 42:23.880]  effect and people self-censoring themselves and being afraid to say
[42:23.880 --> 42:27.720]  what they are take it one step further with this other article Paul can a
[42:27.720 --> 42:31.880]  slave ever truly understand freedom this is about the guy who escaped North
[42:31.880 --> 42:37.840]  Korean death camp and now wants to return yeah this is a documentary I watched
[42:37.840 --> 42:42.160]  a couple of nights ago called camp 14 total control zone and courage everybody
[42:42.160 --> 42:47.440]  to watch it it's basically about a North Korean who was born inside a North
[42:47.440 --> 42:52.480]  Korean death camp he witnessed all kinds of horrors he was brutally tortured
[42:52.480 --> 42:56.880]  punished even witnessed the public execution of his mother and his brother
[42:56.880 --> 43:02.080]  because he had he had no innate family you know he couldn't embrace the even
[43:02.080 --> 43:06.000]  the concept of family he said that he had no emotion whatsoever when he was
[43:06.000 --> 43:11.040]  watching the execution of his mother and his brother so when he risked his life
[43:11.040 --> 43:17.320]  to escape many years later when he was 23 remember he was born in the camp they
[43:17.320 --> 43:21.480]  basically conducted an interview with him he defected to South Korea and he
[43:21.480 --> 43:26.360]  said that he missed the life in the camp and that he wanted to return to this
[43:26.360 --> 43:32.120]  North Korean death camp this torture camp because he felt pure he had a lack of
[43:32.120 --> 43:37.400]  concern he didn't have to worry about free will so again as I point out in the
[43:37.400 --> 43:42.120]  article it speaks to this idea of you know statism in its most undiluted
[43:42.120 --> 43:47.320]  expression which is the ability to induce this potent form of Stockholm
[43:47.320 --> 43:53.800]  syndrome where the slave has the need to express free will or even think about
[43:53.800 --> 43:58.440]  free will completely eliminated so even though he's being tortured every day
[43:58.440 --> 44:02.920]  he's witnessing all these horrors he moves to South Korea relative freedom in
[44:02.920 --> 44:07.800]  comparison and yet he wants to return to the death camp which is why I asked in
[44:07.800 --> 44:11.640]  the headline you know can a slave ever truly understand freedom because if
[44:11.640 --> 44:15.840]  you're born into it then what does freedom represent to you so I made the
[44:15.840 --> 44:20.080]  the comparison you know we've got billions of people who are content to
[44:20.080 --> 44:24.640]  remain imprisoned in their own self-imposed jail cells again going back
[44:24.640 --> 44:28.760]  to the fear of stepping outside their comfort zones in terms of surveillance
[44:28.760 --> 44:34.680]  so you can draw a parallel between this North Korean prison inmate who wants to
[44:34.680 --> 44:40.400]  return to the labor camp and billions of people today who are content to remain
[44:40.400 --> 44:45.080]  in their own self-imprisoned delusion and never you know peek outside Pandora's
[44:45.080 --> 44:48.840]  box you know I hear people talk all the time about the trade-off between
[44:48.840 --> 44:52.320]  liberty and security in the mainstream media and the government want us to
[44:52.320 --> 44:57.040]  believe that there is some kind of a trade-off but when you trade off your
[44:57.040 --> 45:01.600]  liberty people without liberty are slaves and so to the degree that you
[45:01.600 --> 45:07.800]  trade off your human dignity and your human freedom you become more of a
[45:07.800 --> 45:12.000]  slave by that amount and when you trade all of it off you're essentially have
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.800]  all of your security you live in a maximum security that's a prison and so
[45:16.800 --> 45:20.160]  that's what this guy wants he really wants his security he wants to get back
[45:20.160 --> 45:27.200]  into a maximum security prison in North Korea and many people want that today in
[45:27.200 --> 45:30.720]  America I used to I said this yesterday used to hear all the time people say as
[45:30.720 --> 45:34.720]  just kind of a joke a figure of speech hey it's a free country and it you know
[45:34.720 --> 45:37.800]  it's hey can I do this as a free country do whatever you don't hear people say
[45:37.800 --> 45:41.280]  that anymore people don't think of America as being a free country and it
[45:41.280 --> 45:44.440]  isn't a free country because one of the other things you saw here all the time
[45:44.440 --> 45:47.680]  was hey there ought to be a law or you know you're making a federal case out
[45:47.680 --> 45:50.080]  of it they've made a federal case out of everything and they made a law
[45:50.080 --> 45:53.720]  essentially about everything but the other thing Paul that I think that this
[45:53.720 --> 45:59.480]  brings out is the danger you said that he had absolutely no concept of family
[45:59.480 --> 46:04.680]  he didn't react to the fact that he saw members of his family executed that has
[46:04.680 --> 46:09.880]  been the dream of tyrants forever it was formalized and Plato's Republic they
[46:09.880 --> 46:13.480]  wanted to make sure that people didn't know who their parents were so that
[46:13.480 --> 46:17.360]  their only family the only thing that they had any connection to was the state
[46:17.360 --> 46:21.680]  no matter how badly it treated them and that's what this guy has he's he's
[46:21.680 --> 46:26.320]  evidence of how well that works and I feel like that's the danger when we see
[46:26.320 --> 46:31.280]  this massive influx of young people and of course part of that is a beard to say
[46:31.280 --> 46:35.960]  that it's all about the youth coming across the border because Obama does
[46:35.960 --> 46:42.240]  classify children as people up to the age of 31 and his documents there but you
[46:42.240 --> 46:45.960]  know that is a danger when we see there are a massive number of children that
[46:45.960 --> 46:50.040]  are coming in and I think that that connection that they have losing that
[46:50.040 --> 46:53.720]  connection to their family to that degree coming into a different culture
[46:53.720 --> 46:58.200]  where we can't reach them to get them to understand the American traditions of
[46:58.200 --> 47:02.000]  liberty because of language barrier as easily or as soon I think that's a very
[47:02.000 --> 47:07.960]  dangerous part of this explosion of immigration at the border exactly I
[47:07.960 --> 47:12.880]  mean also tying into this in terms of enslavement and surveillance is the
[47:12.880 --> 47:17.040]  the Facebook issue which if the audience didn't hear about this Facebook
[47:17.040 --> 47:23.440]  basically conducted a secret experiment back in 2012 with 700 users they
[47:23.440 --> 47:27.440]  displayed either positive or negative stories on their Facebook news feed
[47:27.440 --> 47:31.440]  engaged the response and of course they found that quote the results show
[47:31.440 --> 47:35.440]  emotional contagion people who saw negative posts were more likely to
[47:35.440 --> 47:40.000]  respond with their own negative posts so you know I made a video yesterday
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.400]  asking the question why does Facebook have a team of scientists conducting
[47:44.400 --> 47:48.480]  secret experiments to manipulate emotions and actually turns out that they
[47:48.480 --> 47:52.720]  changed the terms of agreement after this experiment was conducted to try and
[47:52.720 --> 47:58.120]  make it more ethical and I made the connection between the fact that we know
[47:58.120 --> 48:01.760]  authorities in the UK the US are preparing for these riots for this
[48:01.760 --> 48:06.080]  domestic disorder you know building fake towns buying riot control gear we've
[48:06.080 --> 48:11.080]  also got top economists predicting civil unrest as a result of this soaring
[48:11.080 --> 48:16.520]  food inflation and wealth inequality so I made the connection between you know
[48:16.520 --> 48:21.560]  they're aware that social revolutions the Arab Spring etc were founded on
[48:21.560 --> 48:26.560]  social media and they're very nervous about being able to sway and control
[48:26.560 --> 48:32.800]  social media in terms of gauging dissatisfaction amongst the public so in
[48:32.800 --> 48:37.880]  tying it to the fear of riots the fear of domestic disorder it actually turns
[48:37.880 --> 48:42.200]  out today that a clear connection has emerged between this Facebook study and
[48:42.200 --> 48:46.720]  the concept of authorities preparing for civil unrest because one of the
[48:46.720 --> 48:51.680]  individuals who conducted the Facebook study Jeffrey T. Hancock from Cornell
[48:51.680 --> 48:56.160]  University he was the same individual who received funding from the Department of
[48:56.160 --> 49:01.120]  Defense the Pentagon for a study called Cornell modeling discourse and social
[49:01.120 --> 49:06.440]  dynamics in authoritarian regimes and this is what we talked about last month
[49:06.440 --> 49:11.160]  this is the Minerva Institute which hit the headlines for its involvement in
[49:11.160 --> 49:16.320]  another DOD program which funds universities to study dynamics and
[49:16.320 --> 49:20.800]  risk to predict large-scale civil unrest around the world so this Facebook
[49:20.800 --> 49:26.280]  secret study to manipulate people's emotions was in part created contrived
[49:26.280 --> 49:30.320]  by one of the same individuals who's working with the Pentagon with the DOD
[49:30.320 --> 49:35.200]  to try and model predict and prepare for mass civil unrest so now we have a clear
[49:35.200 --> 49:40.720]  connection between the two yeah it's not just a format out there that lets you
[49:40.720 --> 49:45.040]  express yourself they're very interested and not only monitoring what
[49:45.040 --> 49:48.520]  people are doing we see all the time that they're coming after people for
[49:48.520 --> 49:53.200]  things that were said on Facebook so we know that law enforcement at all levels
[49:53.200 --> 49:58.200]  is monitoring Facebook fairly closely but the teens who are using it the adults
[49:58.200 --> 50:01.680]  are using it I think they kind of look at this Paul is like some kind of a
[50:01.680 --> 50:06.400]  reality TV show and I think it's interesting to remember that the very
[50:06.400 --> 50:12.000]  first reality TV show I think was a big brother that ought to be telling but
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.320]  they look at this and say well yeah I guess I can become a celebrity like the
[50:15.320 --> 50:19.640]  people that run big brother if I just expose my life and put all this stuff
[50:19.640 --> 50:25.560]  out there but as you pointed out they're using things to manipulate people
[50:25.560 --> 50:27.880]  they're finding a way that they can manipulate people there was in the
[50:27.880 --> 50:31.640]  New York Times article about this there was a tweet from a privacy activist
[50:31.640 --> 50:35.840]  Lauren Weinstein she says I wonder if Facebook killed anyone with their
[50:35.840 --> 50:40.360]  emotional manipulation stunt at their scale and with depressed people out
[50:40.360 --> 50:44.000]  there it's possible that is possible so we're gonna be right back we're gonna
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.560]  talk to Paul Joseph Watson maybe talking to him about what's happening with this
[50:48.560 --> 50:53.640]  and also about perhaps what's going on with the Snowden leaks that was pulled
[50:53.640 --> 50:57.320]  back at the last minute by Glenn Greenwald we'll be right back with Paul Joseph

[54:09.280 --> 54:15.360]  there's a man going around taking names welcome back to the Alex Jones show
[54:15.360 --> 54:19.960]  I'm David Knight here in Austin and in the UK we're joined by Paul Joseph Watson
[54:19.960 --> 54:25.080]  and we were just talking before the break about this Facebook experiment as
[54:25.080 --> 54:28.520]  some people pointed out academic protocols generally call for getting
[54:28.520 --> 54:32.240]  people's consent before psychological research is conducted on them that's the
[54:32.240 --> 54:36.560]  way the New York Times put it other people said doing psychological testing
[54:36.560 --> 54:40.880]  on people crosses the line and of course that's what they were doing they were
[54:40.880 --> 54:45.640]  doing psychological testing trying to change people's moods from being
[54:45.640 --> 54:50.640]  positive to being negative or make them depressed and of course they found that
[54:50.640 --> 54:55.040]  they were able to do that see Facebook is not just about monitoring you it's
[54:55.040 --> 55:00.720]  also about controlling you just like the media they're not trying to get people
[55:00.720 --> 55:05.640]  in this big experiment to purchase a particular product they're trying to make
[55:05.640 --> 55:09.880]  them depressed or make them happy and they were successful in doing that
[55:09.880 --> 55:14.560]  weren't they Paul? They were the results show that they could manipulate people's
[55:14.560 --> 55:17.920]  moods because the people who saw negative posts then posted their own
[55:17.920 --> 55:22.640]  negative items and again it's been linked to this same individual who's
[55:22.640 --> 55:28.640]  helping the Pentagon prepare for large-scale civil unrest around the
[55:28.640 --> 55:33.120]  world so obviously it indicates that they're preparing to use Facebook and
[55:33.120 --> 55:37.200]  other social media to gauge dissatisfaction amongst the public in the
[55:37.200 --> 55:41.520]  hope that they can then manipulate it in order to achieve their own ends which
[55:41.520 --> 55:45.760]  is obviously to keep people pacified in terms of civil in times of civil unrest
[55:45.760 --> 55:51.280]  or emergency. Yeah the Minerva project yes and I also find it very alarming that
[55:51.280 --> 55:57.120]  we see that the conditions that were laid down back in the 80s and back in
[55:57.120 --> 56:03.320]  1984 by Oliver North and Rex 84 as well as Operation Garden plot we see that
[56:03.320 --> 56:06.240]  those conditions that they were laying down like a massive collapse of the
[56:06.240 --> 56:11.600]  border a massive economic collapse we see them creating those situations right
[56:11.600 --> 56:15.960]  now as you've been pointing out for a number of years we see in their
[56:15.960 --> 56:20.240]  purchases that they're militarizing the police but they're also accumulating
[56:20.240 --> 56:24.760]  vast amounts of ammunition and military vehicles in every way they're
[56:24.760 --> 56:30.840]  monitoring and preparing and even initiating a massive economic collapse.
[56:30.840 --> 56:34.880]  Exactly that they're preparing for civil unrest whether it arrives or not
[56:34.880 --> 56:39.200]  remains to be seen but they're gearing up for it also if you remember back in I
[56:39.200 --> 56:43.800]  think it was 2007 quite a while ago now we got a number of pastors who
[56:43.800 --> 56:47.960]  approached us and said that they were part of a FEMA program which was based
[56:47.960 --> 56:53.760]  around pacifying populations in the event of emergencies or civil unrest they
[56:53.760 --> 56:57.960]  actually were training the pastors to go out and tell their congregation to
[56:57.960 --> 57:03.960]  quote obey government in these times of chaos or disorder so these programs as
[57:03.960 --> 57:08.120]  he said they go back decades and again with garden plot and what came out from
[57:08.120 --> 57:13.080]  Oliver North immigration a crisis and influx of immigrants from across the
[57:13.080 --> 57:18.520]  border was one of the examples they gave in which they may be forced to use
[57:18.520 --> 57:23.160]  internment camps to keep people in prison so we've had a we've had a history
[57:23.160 --> 57:28.520]  of these programs being revealed and now we've got them gaming social media to
[57:28.520 --> 57:32.600]  try and influence people's emotions and the shocking thing is that there is a
[57:32.600 --> 57:36.280]  connection to these preparations for civil unrest and we're gonna have an
[57:36.280 --> 57:40.040]  article on info wars dot com about this very shortly and of course we keep
[57:40.040 --> 57:43.320]  hearing from them that it's not a crisis it's an opportunity we hear that
[57:43.320 --> 57:48.160]  not only from Pelosi but we hear it from high-ranking leaders within the GOP in
[57:48.160 --> 57:52.200]  the short time that we've got I thought it was interesting and I want to get your
[57:52.200 --> 57:57.360]  take on this Glenn Greenwald was going to release a large list of people that
[57:57.360 --> 58:00.600]  the NSA had been spying on that they came across and these Snowden
[58:00.600 --> 58:05.160]  documents he was going to release that at midnight last night and he backed off
[58:05.160 --> 58:09.040]  saying that he's been given some new information from the government that he
[58:09.040 --> 58:13.000]  has to consider about that we're almost out of time but I'd like to get your
[58:13.000 --> 58:16.320]  take on that briefly if you can hang around to the next segment there Paul
[58:16.320 --> 58:20.040]  sure okay great we're gonna be right back with Paul Joseph Watson from the
[58:20.040 --> 58:24.640]  UK and David Knight here in Austin on the Alex Jones radio show and Alex is
[58:24.640 --> 58:28.360]  gonna be joining us at the bottom of the hour with a report on agenda 21 you

[58:48.400 --> 58:53.800]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[58:53.800 --> 58:57.360]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[58:57.360 --> 59:01.360]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[59:01.360 --> 59:05.560]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[59:05.560 --> 59:09.440]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[59:09.440 --> 59:13.560]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[59:13.560 --> 59:17.360]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[59:17.360 --> 59:20.720]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[59:20.720 --> 59:24.440]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to
[59:24.440 --> 59:28.800]  start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[59:28.800 --> 59:32.640]  cannot escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild

[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:25.960]  Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight here in
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.040]  Austin I'm your host today but I'm joined at the moment with Paul Joseph Watson
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:34.480]  from the UK we've been talking about his articles up on InfoWars.com one of
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.640]  them is CBS News and Charlie Rose essentially bragging to the public now
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.480]  about how wonderful these smart streetlights are that they can track
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.760]  everything we do all the time but don't worry it's all about saving energy but
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:52.280]  they keep throwing in these references to Orwell talking about a isn't this
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.280]  Orwellian they mentioned that several times in it they talk about how they've
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.960]  got a global network they talk about how they're going to be able to use it to
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.400]  protect the children at school because they're also going to be able to not
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:06.360]  just track your moment your movements not just read your license plate but
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:10.680]  they're going to be able to determine if somebody's got a gun on them that's
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.560]  what these streetlights are capable of and as Paul mentioned they've already
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:18.160]  it's already come out that these streetlights are capable of recording
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:25.080]  and storing phone conversations it really is a panopticon isn't it Paul well
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:30.480]  precisely and of course the interest in all this was you know rejuvenated last
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.600]  year by the Snowden revelations as you mentioned before the break now Greenwald
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:39.360]  is saying that he had this big revelation coming whereby we would learn
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:44.320]  exactly what organizations and individuals the NSA was spying on
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:48.880]  directly now he's delayed it after announcing that it would be released at
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.080]  midnight last night because he says the the United States government suddenly
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:56.240]  began making new last-minute claims which we intend to investigate before
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:01.560]  publishing which is surprising because if you read his book the same thing
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:05.440]  happened on numerous occasions right before a new Snowden revelation was
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.920]  due to be released the US government tried to put pressure on not only Greenwald
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:15.640]  but also the Guardian newspaper not to release that story so you know he defied
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.520]  them then he refused to listen to anything they had to say but now he's
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:23.400]  apparently listened to their concerns and has delayed the story there's also
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.800]  another aspect to it which is that and this is on infowars.com today the
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:32.680]  leak whistleblower website krypton.org has announced that they're going to
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:38.880]  release all the Snowden documents later this month quote in order to avert a war
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.400]  so of course whereas Greenwald has been doling them out one by one slowly which
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.680]  is probably the best method to keep it in the news krypton has announced that
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:53.440]  they're set to release all the Snowden documents in one huge data dump so that
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.560]  will satisfy some of the people who have called for that but also will kind of
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.120]  derail it being in the news constantly by Greenwald's preferred method of
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.920]  doling them out well and of course you know you can look at that any number of
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.240]  ways I mean I personally I want to see them all come out I think we're
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.680]  perfectly capable of having a crowdsourced investigation and I think a
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.600]  lot of people have been uncomfortable with the way they've been doled out to
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:21.520]  keep it in the news is to promote his book or whatever and so I welcome the
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.960]  fact that they will come out I'm kind of concerned about the krypton I hope that
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:29.120]  they're not going to get shut down by talking about this earlier but I think
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:33.880]  the danger of putting these I mean there you can say you can make a
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:37.440]  case on either side of this you can say that it keeps it in the news but the
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:41.320]  other thing that you could say is that perhaps it by pulling it out one piece
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:45.560]  at a time maybe it's getting people too accustomed to it maybe if it was a giant
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.920]  shock all at once so hopefully there's a lot of stuff here that's going to shock
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:55.560]  people I was looking forward to this this leak because I thought that finally
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.120]  some of these people who may be surprised that they are being watched
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:03.400]  might get galvanized to take action rather than set on the sidelines what
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:06.480]  you're just talking about before the panoptagon effect of trying to
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.600]  intimidate people to not say anything hey if you know that your name's on the
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:15.920]  list go for it well precisely and it would be fascinating to find out who is
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:20.360]  on that list but I mean I hope I hope I'd be doesn't point if we're not on it
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.260]  when you I mean in some fashion I would hope that we were on it whether they
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:28.720]  were just monitoring our content or you know Alex individually or whoever I would
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.840]  hope that we were on it because it is it's a kind of badge of honor like you
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.120]  said once you get past the point of fear it's like I don't care if you're
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.880]  watching me you know that's right if you're over the target and you then you're
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.640]  taking flight and that's that's all well and good but yeah if they if they dump
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.840]  the whole document there are going to be a thousand different writers and
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:49.400]  researchers me included are going to be digging into it for new stories so it's
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.720]  an information war isn't it Paul it's an information war and once you get past
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.560]  your first battle it's like a real war you're in it at that point thank you so

[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:32.480]  total number of US forces going back to Iraq now remember at first he wasn't
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:37.880]  going to send anybody and it was going to be 300 then it became 500 now we've
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:42.720]  confirmed it's 800 Paul Joseph Watson who I was just talking to in the UK has
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:46.840]  been sent communications from many people in the military saying that they're
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:52.800]  training and their entire units are going in February of next year so this
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:58.600]  is a re-escalation of the war in Iraq we're going to have joining us in the
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:03.480]  third hour Peter Van Buren he was a US diplomat for 23 years he spent time in
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:08.640]  Iraq as part of the effort to quote-unquote reconstitute Iraq or to
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:13.600]  reconstruct it as somebody from the south who knows that history when I hear
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:19.360]  the words reconstruction I grabbed for my gun because I know what they did there
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:25.640]  but they're going to reconstruct a an area that they've already destroyed we're
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:30.240]  gonna talk to him about what he saw in Iraq we're gonna talk to him about the
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:34.320]  embassy there in Iraq this massive presence there as well as the
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:39.120]  revelations that came out from the New York Times on Sunday about the attitude
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:44.720]  of Blackwater threatening State Department investigators saying if you
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:49.760]  bother me I will kill you and there's nothing anyone could or would do about
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:54.560]  it because this is a rock that's what Blackwater was telling State Department
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.840]  investigators so we're going to talk to Peter Van Buren about that we're also
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:04.840]  gonna talk to him about his book ghost of Tom Joe the story of the 99% and of
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:09.540]  course today in the news on BBC we have an internet billionaire Nick Hanauer who
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:14.080]  warns of a coming revolution he's made a lot of money off of the internet and he
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:18.420]  has a warning for his fellow gazillionaires he says if we don't do
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:22.720]  something to fix the glaring inequities in this economy the pitchforks are going
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:28.040]  to be coming for us he says do you think the US is special is it different
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:33.120]  you're wrong no nation is immune just ask the Russian czars or the French
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.160]  aristocracy and so we're gonna be talking to Peter Van Buren about the ghost of
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:41.200]  Tom Jode he takes the story of course Tom Jode is the character if you remember
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:45.280]  from the grapes of wrath it was the central character the character played
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:49.360]  by Henry Fonda in the movie he kind of updates that from the Great Depression
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:55.040]  to the 1950s and on so instead of the dust bowl we've got the rust belt and he
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:02.240]  updates that idea now this billionaire here the Nick Hanauer who was speaking
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.240]  in the BBC he thinks this can all be saved by creating a new minimum wage I
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.400]  don't think that you can mandate wealth out of the central government I think
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.120]  that what we ought to mandate is freedom and dignity maybe we ought to
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.320]  mandate the Bill of Rights if we do that sort of thing that's what's going to
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:24.240]  turn it around it's people having control of their life if they have
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:28.800]  control and freedom in their life if everything is not owned by just a
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:33.480]  handful of people if we stop this consolidation somehow and I think the
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.360]  way to do it is to not allow the government to become the instrument of
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:43.560]  these corporations they always use the government to shut down competition so I
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.720]  think the key thing is to establish individual rights certainly isn't going
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:53.160]  to help I don't think to raise minimum wages because that just gets eaten up by
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:58.800]  inflation now of course there's breaking news on the immigration front as well we
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.560]  see that a sheriff has said that we come across decomposed bodies of immigrants
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:08.480]  quite often as reported by CBS News isn't it interesting that there's been so
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:14.520]  much said about the three teenagers in Israel who were killed and yet people are
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:19.320]  not talking about the admissions of this sheriff and others who's saying after
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:23.560]  they found this 11-year-old Guatemalan boy the sheriff says down here finding a
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.360]  decomposed body well we come across them quite often and that's the sheriff
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:33.560]  Eddie Guerra see the person who is creating these types of circumstances
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:37.800]  of course is Barack Obama as a Border Patrol agents who have talked to us have
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:42.400]  said nothing has changed in those countries recently what has changed is
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:47.000]  the way the immigrants are being handled and the messages that's being sent to
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.840]  them so we've got some reports we had reporters down there at the border and
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:57.960]  we've got a report from John bound about the real problem terrorists we have the
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.440]  people at the TSA coming down and everybody what about our open borders
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:06.840]  here's John bounds report these cities just above the US Mexico border don't
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:12.680]  receive any federal funding the law-abiding land-owning residents of
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:18.800]  towns such as falferious Texas are overrun by a tsunami of illegals as a
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.800]  result of what's called the funnel effect the militarization of the border
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:29.000]  which includes checkpoints barriers and security technology diverts the human
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.120]  smuggling operations into treacherous searing and rugged terrain that delivers
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.800]  many illegal aliens to their deaths and ranch owners in Texas border volunteer
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.160]  founders Mike and Linda vickers contending with the outcome what they
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.200]  are about to tell you may cause alarm because America isn't simply being
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:52.240]  invaded by countries south of its border it is increasingly being invaded by
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:56.120]  countries from all over the world can you speak about your organization and
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.760]  explain where some of your volunteers come from and who they are they actually
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:06.000]  we even have a lot of out-of-staters Nebraska Massachusetts North Carolina
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.960]  Oklahoma many from Florida part of our mission is to enforce or help assist
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:19.360]  border patrol and other law enforcement entities out here we will post out on
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:26.840]  these heavily trafficked areas and report specific numbers to border patrol
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:33.440]  specific locations and they have learned that we're a big help we're like
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:39.800]  extra eyes and ears out here we also a big part of our mission is awareness and
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:46.240]  we do many speaking engagements to let people know exactly what's going on out
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:52.320]  here and what we're seeing despite what others say in high political offices
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:57.800]  that the border is safe these border towns are safe it is not our ranch
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:04.960]  gate is 69 miles north of the bridge in Hidalgo that goes into Rio Nosa Mexico
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:10.240]  little over a day's walk well actually most of these people don't walk 69 miles
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:16.280]  they all pay a criminal organization mainly the cartels big money to be
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:20.040]  brought up here and let out south of this border patrol checkpoint four and a
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:25.760]  half miles south of our ranch on us highway 281 so they're all contributing
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:29.240]  to organized crime by paying large sums of money to be brought in here and to
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:34.280]  give you an example the Chinese are paying 50,000 the Indians are paying 10
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:39.600]  to 20,000 all the Central Americans the average is about 7,000 so when the
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:47.640]  Mexicans especially southern Mexico are paying 3,000 so it's a huge huge money
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:52.960]  event for the cartels probably even more lucrative than the drug business what
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:58.520]  percentage are you seeing from places other than south and central America the
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:03.000]  border patrol and homeland security categorize the people that are not from
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.760]  Mexico as other than Mexicans and prior to last night they were it was running
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:16.480]  about 73% of the people apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley or OTMs other
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:22.280]  than Mexican a lot of Central Americans but really from all over the the world
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:31.200]  and we were informed last night that that number has escalated to 80% so and
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:36.040]  this is this is a fact so most of the people that we encounter here larger
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.520]  percentage of them are people from other other countries other than Mexico and
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:44.480]  we're not told about the special interest aliens we have had Somalians
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:52.160]  here once they got on that special alien list they won't tell us that anymore
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:17:00.000]  but there have been some Somalians India Sri Lanka Nepal Chinese you name it
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.160]  we've had it here we've also found evidence that people from these
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:11.400]  special interest countries in particular Pakistan and Afghanistan Iran are
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:16.000]  coming through our property dream one of our Texas border volunteer operations
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:22.520]  last year we had a group of 10 we spotted we followed them informed the
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.840]  border patrol where they were going to come out on the highway border patrol
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:31.920]  were not able to respond fast enough they got they climbed the fence and loaded
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:37.600]  up and and left and we're not caught but as one of them was climbing over the
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:45.640]  fence he dropped a package and that package was an Urdu dictionary Urdu is
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:53.720]  a language spoken in Pakistan and Afghanistan and in that translation
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:59.280]  book Urdu in English there were a lot of phrases circled and outlined do you
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:06.320]  speak Spanish do you speak English you must pay in dollars so we know that
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:10.200]  special interest countries in particular countries like Pakistan or
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:14.760]  Afghanistan that are not particularly friendly with our country are slipping
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:22.520]  through here under the disguise of and under the all this other activity that's
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.320]  going on where these families are giving up and and the border patrol
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:30.360]  resources are being compromised so it's easier for them to slip through this
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:35.840]  private property and that's just one example and more recently within the
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:41.320]  past two weeks some Iranian money was found in a bailout vehicle so we know
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:45.120]  they're coming in here besides that Iranian money being found in a bailout
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:51.960]  vehicle up here for Syrians which is not you know public news yet but for
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:56.760]  Syrians were apprehended on the Rio Grande River a couple days ago we're
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:02.800]  never divulged the special interest aliens but I think it's time America gets
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:07.560]  alarmed they are they've already come through here it's us as the humanitarian
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:13.200]  crisis and it's an OTM crisis it just take out the factor of the women and
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:17.160]  children it's an other than Mexican crisis right now or you know being
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:23.000]  invaded by third world country people and in those third world country people
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.080]  are the special interest aliens and our board borders are poor we don't have

[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:21.840]  special report on agenda 21 you won't want to miss that yesterday we had a
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:28.160]  landmark Supreme Court decision we had a test of government mandates to buy
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:32.600]  things versus our First Amendment rights about the free exercise of religion
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:39.280]  and surprisingly the Supreme Court came down on the side of the Constitution but
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:44.360]  just narrowly a five to four decision and some of the justices on the the
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:49.560]  senting side were very angry about that Ginsburg wrote anyone can assert their
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:54.920]  religious objections this is just too radical yeah freedom is a radical idea
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:25:00.120]  so it's individual individual liberty and it's not just about holding beliefs
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:07.000]  it's about the free exercise of beliefs Kagan wrote Congress gave this as an
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.800]  entitlement this is a law well the First Amendment says you shall make no law
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:17.960]  abridging freedom of speech or the free exercise of religion now we have some
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:22.360]  quotes from Hillary Clinton she said that she thought that this was very
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:27.200]  disturbing deeply disturbing she got very animated when she was asked about
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:32.600]  this they say that she delivered a fiery and impassioned reply calling it
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:36.960]  deeply disturbing along among other things I want to focus on what Nancy
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:44.040]  Pelosi said though she had I think the most interesting take on this she said
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:51.080]  that this is a gross violation of workers religious rights ooh their
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:57.480]  religious rights let's think about that for a moment is this really about the
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:01.600]  exercise or religion we had a lot of people come back and and say that that
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:06.360]  was shameless they said are you on some kind of medication religious rights
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:11.400]  violation you'll see a lot of these collected on twitchy.com where they're
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:16.600]  laughing about what she says she also tweeted out that the SCOTUS that's the
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:20.440]  Supreme Court took an outrageous step against women's rights setting a
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:24.200]  dangerous precedent that permits corporations to choose which laws to
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:29.040]  obey to which somebody said oh you mean like your president and how he only
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:33.520]  obeys the laws that suit him so they're pointing out that hypocrisy they're
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:39.200]  pointing out that this is this isn't about religious rights of women but it
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.280]  really is it really is because see from Nancy Pelosi standpoint from the
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:48.840]  feminist standpoint it really is a religion you have to understand that
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:54.560]  abortion to them is like a sacrament listen to what the National Abortion
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.200]  Rights Action League said about this decision
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:03.600]  Elisa Hogue president of now all pro-choice America condemned the ruling I am
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:08.120]  saddened and disappointed and actually quite disturbed it is a rough day in our
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:12.840]  country when five male justices rule that discrimination against women is not
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:17.980]  discrimination at all 99% of women use birth control at some point in our
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:22.080]  lifetime and the justices showed that they're out of touch when they support
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:26.040]  bosses who want to reach beyond the boardroom into our bedrooms it's not
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:32.360]  what this country stands for okay you heard her say that 99% of women use
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:38.720]  contraceptives we also know that 85% of companies provided that kind of
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:45.080]  coverage before the Obama mandates now boardrooms are not reaching into the
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:49.040]  bedrooms of people to stop them from doing anything that they want the
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:54.840]  coercion is the other way around Ron Paul had this to say this is up on the
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:58.360]  article that we have on info wars.com he said I think the most profoundly
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:02.400]  confusing argument has been the argument that not being able to get free birth
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.120]  control is discriminating against women this to me is utterly amazing if
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:10.800]  somebody wants something and they wish to have something they demand something
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:15.000]  they say they have a right to it that's absolutely wrong that's why we have this
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.120]  runaway welfare state that's what Ron Paul said about it he's exactly right
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:23.720]  they're not denying them the right to take this what they're saying is that
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:28.080]  they have religious convictions and they cannot be compelled to violate those
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:32.480]  and quite frankly I think if they hadn't got I believe that Chief Justice
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:37.880]  Roberts was blackmailed we now know everybody knows that the government is
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.760]  watching everything that everybody is doing everyone believes that now we've
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:45.560]  been telling you that at info wars.com for a very long time but now it's common
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:49.440]  knowledge who do you think they're going to be watching most closely well it's
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:53.640]  going to be the chief justices of the Supreme Court or the Supreme Court
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:58.320]  justices people in power congressman I think that's what's behind this nine to
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:03.000]  nothing decision this last week that said that they have to have a search warrant
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.840]  in order to search people's phones I think the Supreme Court has been a
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:10.760]  victim of this kind of blackmail how else could Chief Justice Roberts write
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:15.920]  both the dissenting and the majority opinion on this do a very quick 180 saying
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:21.320]  that this is not an unconstitutional mandate is simply a tax no it is an
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:25.840]  unconstitutional mandate I'm very glad that Hobby Lobby and this other small
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:30.640]  company stood up for their rights put their lives and their property on the
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:34.600]  line that's what the founders of this country did to get their rights we need
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:39.520]  more people like them who will take this to the mat we're gonna be right back

[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:20.480]  my friends thank you for joining us today here on the radio slash television
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:25.280]  transmission we're gonna be going back to David at night in the radio studio
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:34.000]  here in just a few minutes but I wanted to spend some time breaking down what's
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:41.520]  transpired since UN agenda 21 was globally ratified by the United Nations
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:48.480]  back in 1992 to be international law whether nations want to adopt the law
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:55.040]  or not as far as the UN sees it and the eugenicist globalist that control it they
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:59.400]  are going to enforce it by hooker by crook. In the past people like Napoleon
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:03.960]  Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler in Europe tried to take over by force but the
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:09.600]  corporatist learned that what can't be done with force can be done by stealth so
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:15.200]  I wanted to go back into the archives here in a few minutes and play some clips
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:22.840]  here for the radio and TV audience today excerpts from my 1997 film that I
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:27.240]  produced with my cousin who's been working here off and on since Buckley
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:31.800]  Hammond who ran camera with me and I just mentioned that fact because he's
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:35.000]  recently come back to work with us after being gone for about 11 years we're
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.280]  very excited to have him here but when I'm shot and directed and produced this
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:49.480]  film back in 1997 almost no one was aware was in a 21 almost no one was aware
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:55.480]  of Cloward and Piven and the plan to bring in neo feudalism in the UN's own
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:59.440]  words and we cover that in the film in-game with Dr. Michael Kaufman whose
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:06.960]  maps in Congress off the UN document showed half the country off limits to
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:12.720]  human activity completely then the rest of it only under partial human use and
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:18.760]  again that's down to the mile land controlled by the establishment so it's
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:23.560]  a form of artificial scarcity not just here in the US but worldwide to shut
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:28.720]  down your competition in business real estate industry where only you were
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:33.040]  allowed to operate and and and no one else is a form of corporate or
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:37.320]  diplomatic immunity from taxes regulations you name it and I know I
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:40.920]  hammer this almost every week it's because it's so key it's how the world
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:45.160]  really works and the globalists are quite public about that but I wanted to
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:50.280]  just look at a quick web search under environmental tyranny and it's in a 21
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:56.360]  that Rob do did today and just go over some of the recent history of what's
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:05.120]  been unfolding first off I want to look at the New York Times they are pretty
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:09.720]  much the establishment talking point propaganda center for the rest of the
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:16.480]  dinosaur media and for the last few years in 2012 they have been running
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:23.240]  around saying that there is no agenda 21 there is no move to control human
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:30.320]  activity there is no move to use zoning as a form of feudalism to bring in a new
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:34.600]  dark age of control even though that's in the biological diversity assessment
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:42.680]  1996 and part of a gender 21 to 1992 but but here it is activist fight green
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:48.760]  projects seeing you in plot and they're like oh it's so terrible these projects
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:53.040]  we have to basically federalize every town in the country by getting cities to
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:58.880]  adopt these regulations to circumvent the states and go under UN treaty oh my
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:04.760]  gosh it's insane it doesn't exist none of it is happening so I thought I would
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:09.040]  just show you here if your TV viewer or direct you your radio listener even
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:12.920]  Wikipedia everybody knows Wikipedia is not totally accurate when it gets
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:17.000]  vandalized but usually it's very accurate you go to the bibliography on
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:24.520]  agenda 21 on Wikipedia and you can see the bibliography to all the government
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:30.680]  documents and the official UN website where it's on record and this is the
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:36.720]  so-called voluntary implemented action plan of the United Nations but that's
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:41.320]  not really true because through adjoining treaties in UNESCO it is brought
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:48.880]  into law but the point is it does exist despite what the New York Times says and
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:54.240]  it shows the New York Times has lost a lot of power because famously they did a
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:57.040]  review of the film New World Order that came out about a year after Bilderberg
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:02.080]  2008 where Obama and Hillary were meeting in secret we got video of this
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:07.640]  they said that I was there imagining they were meeting having a full-on
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:13.400]  hallucination at the Marriott in Chantilly Virginia even though now it's
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:17.640]  totally admitted to have happened remember the New York Times said none of
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:22.840]  that even went on pay no attention to the man behind the curtain move along
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:29.840]  move along these aren't the droids you're you're looking for but again the
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:35.040]  good news is people are seeing the manifestation of agenda 21 so I don't
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:42.960]  know 14 15 16 17 years after I produced my first film I thought that we would
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:45.840]  just go over some more of the things it's doing let's look at this article
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:51.600]  right here CBS News Bloomberg announces winner of micro apartment design
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.400]  competition and you've got these big real estate owners like Bloomberg and
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:00.840]  others tapping in San Francisco and Austin Texas not just New York where oh
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:05.720]  you pay double or triple per square foot what you would have paid for a 2,000
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:09.960]  square foot apartment or a thousand square foot apartment or we got a big
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:18.680]  family of 3,000 you know foot condo you now pay effectively ladies and gentlemen
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:23.680]  double or even triple for a 250 square foot and now they're making them smaller
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:29.160]  they're building one in Austin that will house over 5,000 people where it's 200
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:32.720]  square feet despite all the studies showing it's like elephants in tiny
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:41.000]  cages not good for you so this is all in 21 to have higher taxes and to take
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.880]  more of your money and then to get you to accept less as if it's cool and I get
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:49.880]  the consumerism can be out of control but these are elites who want red
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:56.560]  carpets and an Air Force one and 15 houses and the five wives and six kids
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:02.280]  like Ted Turner but you're not supposed to have air conditioning or ever be able
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:06.920]  to have a car as Obama famously told Africans earlier this year in fact we'll
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:11.080]  play that clip now ultimately if you think about all the youth that everybody's
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:15.280]  mentioned here in Africa if everybody's raising living standards to the point
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:19.120]  where everybody's got a car and everybody's got air conditioning everybody's
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:25.440]  got a big house well the planet will boil over all right so Bloomberg announces
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:28.760]  winter of micro apartments design competition this is just a few years
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:33.360]  ago now it's going on everywhere and this is how they sell is the newest coolest
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:38.280]  thing hey pay double or triple and live in a coffin house for rent your very
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:44.480]  young is in 21 shoebox apartment again this is being reported across the board
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:49.120]  here's another headline micro apartments could be hazardous to your mental
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:54.840]  health and then it breaks down the studies showing that it's not good for
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:41:00.840]  you to basically live in a jail cell so the elites can control and run your
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:05.360]  life here's another one living in a box the desperate workers forced to live in
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:10.960]  a tiny coffin apartments of Tokyo which still costs up to 400 pounds a month or
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:16.720]  about $700 again it's about charging you to live in a coffin
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:25.280]  house more it's not about cutting back on on on spoilage or living large it's
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:31.280]  about poor people learning to live even more poor and there's more breakdowns
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:36.360]  here in Austin with the development where they are setting up short-term
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:42.200]  rentals controlled in a complex that the city is going to run and basically own
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:47.280]  just very scary to have government like the communist Chinese getting into the
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:52.400]  business of these coffin like facilities moving right along here's another
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:58.200]  example of what a gentleman one means Western land takeover former BLM chief
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:03.720]  state lawmakers clash as millions of acres are taken out of use case in point
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:08.320]  the Bundy Ranch where you had 35 families now only one because they use
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:12.800]  the regulations and fees to raise it to bankrupt you like Obama said you can
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:17.120]  build a coal power plant we're going to raise the taxes to bankrupt you you can
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:20.560]  have ranches we're just going to raise the prices till it bankrupts you and we
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:25.520]  wonder why beef prices have doubled so continuing here here's another article
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:30.960]  along that line BLM eyes 90,000 acres of Texas land they only you know have half
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:35.840]  the West and hundreds of millions acres now they want even more of ranchers land
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:42.440]  that they have the title to sticker shock a steak house beef prices highest in
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:51.520]  27 years so these are just examples of what living under this system is like
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:56.520]  now in conclusion before we go to these clips from my first film America
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:01.920]  destroyed by design let's go to some more of these articles here's fortune
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:09.080]  June 21 in global conspiracy or climate savior and they kind of you know make a
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.800]  joke out of it because again all the different establishment publications
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:18.360]  don't want us mobilizing against this corporate stealth takeover of society
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:24.320]  that that's in all the documents in public so again here's that move under
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:30.240]  June 21 to abolish the suburbs Obama will he abolish them June 21
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:35.720]  conspiracy to wipe out freedoms of all US citizens and it gets into the idea of
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:40.400]  urban sprawl being horrible the problem is we're already laid out to live like
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:44.400]  that we don't want to go into the central cities where everything costs so much
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:49.280]  this will only hurt the poorest people that much more this is the model of
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:54.440]  social engineering here's another headline June 21 GOP candidate vows to
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:44:00.000]  stop UN plan it's very popular to expose this and to run on a prosperity ticket
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.440]  that's why the system doesn't want us talking about it here's another one
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:12.120]  ask wire saying that it's a con game to try to say that this program is even
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:16.320]  going on remember how they would try to deny that the UN even basically was
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:19.440]  trying to set up a world government or they try to say there was no NSA spying
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:24.160]  or there were no lies about WMD's in Iraq I mean the people know that no this
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:29.640]  is going on and denying that it exists doesn't work anymore in fact under a
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:33.480]  gender 21 they've tried to ban all over the world children learning how to be
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:38.120]  farmers under their parents and doing their chores here's a headline EPA moles
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:42.360]  tougher dust standards agency moles particulate matter standards that would
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:48.480]  shut down every hay barn in the country that's out of the courier press here's
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:54.360]  another one Arizona loses the EPA on farm dust they're moving ahead to shut it
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:59.560]  down okay can't have dust Obama team wants children banned from doing farm
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:06.960]  chores you see this is what's going on under the Department of Labor saying
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.800]  that your children can't even carry out the trash or get the eggs out of the
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:14.600]  chicken coop this is the total control this is why they're banning lemonade
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:19.120]  stands and Forbes magazine has to ask why is there a war on lemonade stands all
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:21.960]  over the United States it's why they're banning farmers markets and Amish
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:25.720]  selling milk and other rating organic food stores and our whole foods and her
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:30.200]  mom and pops because they want you in their system they want you at Walmart
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:35.160]  they want you at Target they want you only buying their tainted GMO additive
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:40.200]  ridden social engineering garbage and that's why real liberals real
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:46.920]  conservatives real pro people pro prosperity humans need to be aware of
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:51.800]  what's going on and absolutely say no to this agenda because it is a eugenics
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:57.840]  anti-human neo feudalistic fascist program that is on record and only your
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:03.400]  ignorance only my ignorance and and my inaction and your inaction can allow
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:06.680]  this to continue let's go to a few excerpts of where I tried to warn people
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:11.800]  at the Grand Canyon and more and where we show the actual documents in the
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:18.560]  warn of the UN treaties back in 1997 and then we'll come back on the other side
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:24.200]  in the radio studio to get David Knight's take on this stay with us we're
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:32.280]  here at the model United Nations day January 16th 1998 we went in and
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:37.280]  discussed a lot of people a lot of issues and saw the youth being educated
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:41.560]  being trained in the ways of world governance and the growth of the world
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:45.760]  government control apparatus and I see y'all are wearing little worlds there do
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:50.520]  y'all care about the world yeah y'all are good people aren't you yeah y'all
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:54.160]  think the United Nations is helping mm-hmm yeah I think it's a great great
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:58.680]  way to like make world peace a great way to make world peace because through
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:03.600]  global governance we can knock out all the all the troublemakers yes is that
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:09.520]  what y'all been talking about yeah yeah well that's great I hope y'all have an
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:16.960]  enjoyable time okay thanks a lot thank you to think about the United Nations
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:21.040]  I think it's kind of fun no it is really cool it decides a whole lot of world
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:28.960]  issues world peace it's a very exciting nifty model United Nations just one
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:33.160]  more than many committees helpless young people yielding themselves to the
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:40.400]  elites hands I could tell them about the people that really control it but they
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:46.360]  never understand it it's this petty taste of power that gets them to believe
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.560]  that they're really doing something good when they're really working for
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:56.440]  something bad I'm standing here in northern Arizona overlooking the
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:02.320]  beautiful Grand Canyon one of America's most beautiful treasures and it's very
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:06.040]  distressing to me and other patriots and people that truly do care about the
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:11.200]  environment in America that Bill Clinton with his executive order January 19th
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:19.320]  1996 number 12,986 began the precedent to sign over our national treasures to
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:23.480]  international control yes this is a international biosphere and World
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:30.240]  Heritage Site and guess who controls those the United Nations the United
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:34.120]  Nations is nothing more than a front group for international banks based in
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:38.760]  Europe and in America they care nothing about the environment they care about
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:44.080]  using it as an excuse to tell you how you can use the environment to get you
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:50.160]  used to listening to what they say and what you can do and what you can use I'm
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:54.400]  sure y'all have all heard they're planning to restrict cars to the Grand
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:58.400]  Canyon and bring buses in quite soon well I'm here during peak season at the
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:02.920]  end of the summer and I don't see any problem with Americans coming to the
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:09.360]  Grand Canyon they're paying exorbitant prices of $20 a car wake up and
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:16.640]  understand that large corporations think in a long-term game they understand
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:20.120]  that if they can restrict use to this place and get international control in
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:23.880]  here then 10 20 years down the road they could start construction and building
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:29.640]  which they're already doing by the way so we are for real conservation but we
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:34.080]  are against organized crime clicks that call themselves international bankers
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:37.800]  and elite corporations coming in and buying off your politicians like Bill
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:41.960]  Clinton who is an incredible trader to this country who then signs over
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:49.640]  promptly our rights to use and to maintain our natural wonders there's a
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:54.440]  lot of money in controlling these places a lot of people come and visit them just
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:59.600]  cut through their lies and it's sterling simple exactly what's happening now
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:03.440]  let's go talk to some park rangers and other individuals perhaps some of the
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:08.080]  tourists here and see if they've even heard of this terrible crime that's
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:14.880]  being committed against the American people this giant land grab ladies and
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:19.840]  gentlemen I'm conducting a scientific experiment I want to ask y'all if you
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:25.080]  all know about executive order signed January 19th 1996 by President Bill
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:31.440]  Clinton number 12,986 which designated this is a world heritage site under
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:36.120]  UNESCO a corporation of the United Nations none of you heard about this in
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:40.920]  the mainstream media none of you heard about it nobody's heard about this have
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:44.760]  you well they had they they they took down the signs in most parks because there
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:48.520]  was a furor about three days after they put up the United Nations signs no one's
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:54.720]  heard about it huh well see that's how fascism breeds the environmentalist
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:58.140]  movement is now nothing but an arm of corrupt international banks and
[01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:02.920]  corporations they're using it as a excuse for land grabs all over the entire
[01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:07.720]  world remember this and check it out executive order call the interior
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:14.680]  department call Bruce Babbitt executive order 12,986 it's important the modern
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:22.120]  Bureau is a propaganda keep this from you no sooner had I turned away that some
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:26.200]  of the crowd began to laugh and call me a kook I guess they won't take the time
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:31.600]  to check out the executive order 12,986 I guess they don't believe it unless
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:36.800]  they hear it from Peter Jennings his mouth at the Grand Canyon Main Visitor
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:40.400]  Center we talked to some of the people at the front desk and they politely said
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:43.820]  yes we've heard about the UN but we're not quite sure what's going on there was
[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:48.400]  some rigmarole some protest about the UN signs so they have been moved in some
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:52.380]  of the national parks and then later we got a little visit from the head
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:54.880]  hot shows who were quite rude and fortunately they wouldn't let us take
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:52:00.280]  our cameras behind closed doors where I was threatened with arrest is there
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:04.080]  anybody that I can who will just tell me the same thing you did but just where I
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:12.120]  can have a mic on and things well you heard me just asking to just politely
[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:14.920]  talk to public affairs officer we were sitting down for about 10 minutes with
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:18.640]  our cameras off and barely got a shot of her that's all we had to freeze it we
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:22.880]  only got about a half a second of her she was very rude and drug me the back
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:26.640]  and threatened to arrest me for dare to ask questions was I some type of terrorist
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:30.800]  and you should have seen the monster they had in the back with us this is all
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:38.360]  part of America flat out corruption you own and control these public lands not
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:42.000]  the federal government and not their international lackey friends controlled
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:48.400]  by foreign corrupt banks end of story we've now reached the north entrance of
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:52.360]  Yellowstone National Park here in Montana and let's just read with the
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:57.200]  important inscription at the front of this old gate reads for the benefit and
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:04.640]  the enjoyment of the people created by an act of Congress March 1st 1872 we
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:07.560]  dropped by the main visitor center and they sent us over to the main
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:11.080]  administration building we simply wanted to ask what's going on with the
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:16.120]  United Nations in our parks hey how you doing I saw someone look just like you
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:19.680]  we're all over the country an independent film and we're just we
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:22.360]  might talk to Bruce Pavits office and we were just wanted to ask questions
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:27.920]  about the biosphere designation you're filming and do you have a filming
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:35.680]  permit oh there's a permit yes I'm here making my own documentary I just want
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:40.240]  to reiterate the fact that everyone was very polite at most of the parks but
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:45.920]  once you would get to a park and get to the main upper level areas they were all
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:50.040]  very rude they would tell you turn the camera off we would then they took us
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:55.320]  to the back and again threatened us with fines for having a camera in the park
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:57.360]  and I said well see cameras everywhere and they said well you're a
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:01.600]  professional aren't you and I said well not really I guess I am and then what
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:04.800]  kind of weirdos are you got me back in the office called more of them back
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:08.720]  there I got threatened to be arrested at two places and you just saw how polite
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:12.840]  I was and then they thought that I had a bug hidden on me or something and wouldn't
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:16.760]  even hardly talk to me back there they'd all been advised about dangerous people
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:21.320]  asking questions that acted like a military encampment it was very very
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:26.320]  strange someone had prepared them despite the administration not being very
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:31.040]  helpful we did locate the UN signs both the international biosphere and the
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:34.400]  World Heritage Site y'all are the owners I mean we bought into this whole federal
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.800]  government type deal and now they're telling us that we can't even use what
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:43.720]  we supposedly are well I don't know I'd rather turn this over to United Nations
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:48.080]  they got a plaque down at the main central office they're probably easier
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:55.960]  just not to think about it it's not a conspiracy theory there's a bronze
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:55:00.760]  plaque right up there ma'am you see that right there they talk about a Hollywood
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:06.720]  movie rather than the bronze plaque in the executive order that is what's wrong
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:11.280]  with America ladies and gentlemen people have been taught bread from a foot
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:14.880]  tall absolutely not to care while they're being raided by the government
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:19.200]  which is controlled by corrupt corporations when I say that I mean the
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:23.400]  top 20 but people think as rich as a joke in this country they think a nice
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:27.200]  house a nice car is wealthy and that's why it's so easy for the establishment to
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:31.000]  manipulate people you notice the well-informed people would talk to us
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.320]  and and knew of the executive orders only if only a few and they're probably
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:37.360]  the people who've actually done well economically because they were able to
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:42.360]  stiffen the lies but the rest of America seems to love being kind it's like they
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:45.720]  get into being lied to and they get an incredible thrill out of the whole thing
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:49.640]  that is painful to me that's why I'll continue to make these documentaries I
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:53.440]  will continue to rant and rave on the radio about factual information and if
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:57.240]  people don't have the the the inner strength to rise up to a threat far
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:01.280]  or domestic and stand up for US sovereignty then I feel really really
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:05.600]  sorry for them because that's where we are in America today we are under siege
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:09.760]  we're losing our property rights as we speak
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:18.640]  alright and that report is up on YouTube it's agenda 21 equals death I hope
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:24.680]  you enjoy that flashback to 1998 that was Alex Jones's first documentary
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:30.120]  America destroyed by design 16 years ago he's talking about agenda 21 and how
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:35.160]  they're gonna roll this out this is all about a very very tiny number of
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:40.440]  elites controlling everything going back to a kind of feudal feudal system
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:45.280]  where we're the serfs and they own everything that's what we're talking
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:49.680]  about when we talk about the 1% although it's a much smaller number than the 1%
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:54.800]  we're gonna be joined in the next hour by Peter Van Buren he has a book the
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:57:00.720]  ghosts of Tom Joad a story of the 99% it's essentially a reimagining of the
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:05.160]  grapes of wrath where instead of the Great Depression the setting is mid 20th century
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:10.120]  America instead of the dust bowl it's the rust belt and instead of the rapid
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:14.360]  collapse of the Great Depression it's going to be about the continual decline
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:20.880]  of America that we see as we fall into this control by the very few now we're
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:24.560]  also going to talk to him about the re-escalation of Iraq because the other
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:27.840]  thing about Peter Van Buren was for 23 years he worked for the State Department
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:33.960]  as part of that job he was in Iraq he also wrote another book we meant well
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:38.640]  how we lost the hearts and minds of the people in Iraq so we're gonna talk to
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:46.680]  him as we see Iraq collapsing back into a revolution as we see Obama saying that
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:50.320]  first he's not gonna send any troops in then it's going to be 300 troops 500
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:54.960]  troops and now on Info Wars today we have an article saying that it's going
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:59.080]  to be 800 troops although we learned a few days ago from an article by Paul
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:03.360]  Joseph Watson that many people in the military have been told that they are
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:07.640]  training for redeployment to Iraq that their entire organization is going to be
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:13.040]  sent over there so it's going to be much more than 800 troops this is doubling
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:17.800]  every couple of days so we're gonna talk to him about Iraq we're going to talk
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:21.680]  to him about the ghost of Tom Jones and of course that's a central character in
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:26.360]  The Grapes of Wrath I think it was number 12 on the AFI list of top 100
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:30.480]  heroes stay with us we're gonna be right back
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:48.160]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network

[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:57.240]  this year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water
[01:58:57.240 --> 01:59:01.200]  contaminate what are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking

[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:37.920]  is a man who had 23 years experience at the State Department and he wrote a book
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:44.400]  about the failed efforts in Iraq how we lost the hearts and minds of Iraq was a
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:49.040]  subtitle of it we met well was the the main title of that book he's now written
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:54.320]  another book about the difference between the 99% and the 1% essentially
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:58.920]  going back to the idea of the grapes of wrath but putting it in a different
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:03.320]  setting as though the Dust Bowl the Rust Belt he calls it the ghost of Tom
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:08.040]  Jones and of course that was a central character the Henry Fonda character if you
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:13.760]  saw the movie and he's talking about the rapid not the rapid collapse like the
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:18.440]  Great Depression but the continual decline of America into a kind of a
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:23.960]  world where even a smaller number than the 1% are controlling everything we
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:27.880]  know that that's we see the massive consolidation not only in banks or
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:32.560]  insurance companies and communication companies we see that everywhere there's
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:36.600]  an article up on info wars dot com right now profiteering on the banker desk
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:42.480]  regulator says the public has no right to details JP Morgan could potentially
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:48.160]  hold upwards of $179 billion of life insurance on their employees and of
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:52.880]  course it's been kind of an ongoing puzzle as to how many these bankers who
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:57.520]  are making so much money just keep jumping out of buildings as if the
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:01.700]  Great Depression had already hit and they say on this story here that as of
[02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:08.560]  December the 31st 2013 JP Morgan held 17.9 billion in bank owned life
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:13.840]  insurance assets I think it's 17 billion maybe not 179 a dark corner of the
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:17.120]  insurance market that allows banks to take out life insurance policies on
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:22.680]  their workers and secretly pocket the death benefits and receive generous
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:28.160]  tax perks subsidized by US taxpayers there you go now if you had a murder
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:31.720]  mystery and it is a mystery how these guys how many of them are committing
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:36.360]  suicide if you had a murder mystery and somebody had a $18 billion insurance
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:41.080]  policy on them you might consider them to be one of the prime suspects but of
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:45.160]  course that would be a conspiracy theory what is not a conspiracy theory is
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:50.640]  the continually doubling of the number of people that are going to be sent back
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:55.160]  to Iraq it started out as zero and as 300 500 now today we have a story up on
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:03:00.480]  info wars.com that 800 are now going to be sent back to Iraq according to the
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:04.640]  State Department and Obama administration the Pentagon but of course
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:10.080]  we've had word that a lot of soldiers are being told that their entire unit is
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:12.840]  being trained to go back to Iraq and to be deployed there so we're going to be
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:18.200]  talking to Peter Van Buren as somebody who spent time in Iraq we want to ask
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:22.040]  him what's going on there get his take on it as somebody who's spent a great
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:27.560]  deal of time there trying to essentially create a democracy in the
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:31.640]  ruins of what the American government had done to that country also want to
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:37.640]  talk to him about this story that came out on Sunday showing that black water
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:43.880]  had just before the just a couple of weeks before this massacre in 2007
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:49.320]  where 17 civilians including a 9-year-old were shot and killed a State
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:53.720]  Department investigator was threatened by black waters top manager there and
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:57.640]  told that he could kill the government's chief investigator and quote no one
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:03.160]  could or would do anything about it as we were in Iraq and according this
[02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:06.720]  article by James Ryzen American Embassy officials in Baghdad sided with
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:10.080]  blackwater rather than the State Department investigators as a dispute
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:14.760]  over the probe escalated in August 2007 the officials told the investigators
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:18.200]  that they had disrupted the embassy's relationship with a security contractor
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:23.760]  and ordered them to leave the country and Gene C. Richter when the
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:27.040]  investigators wrote in a memo to the State Department that James Ryzen got a
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:32.920]  hold of and said blackwater contractors saw themselves as above the law now this
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:39.280]  is the same James Ryzen who is now a problem for the Obama administration
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:43.360]  because the government is trying to imprison him for not giving up his
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:47.760]  sources and he says he's got two choices he can give up everything he believes in
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:51.960]  or he can go to jail will the Obama administration send him to jail or will
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:55.960]  they back down we're gonna ask James Ryzen about Iraq and about how they came
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:05:01.200]  after him when he wrote the book stay with us from the water table to our
[02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:06.120]  soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:10.160]  and every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been
[02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:13.800]  shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:18.320]  outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:22.040]  chemicals within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the
[02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:25.880]  United States well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to
[02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:29.600]  numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million Americans live
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:33.280]  with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to research these statistics
[02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:37.840]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat

[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:41.400]  Peter Van Buren I'd like to talk to you about your experience in Iraq because
[02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:47.920]  we see that all coming back we see ISIS coming in you wrote a book previously we
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:52.520]  met well and how you lost even though you tried you lost the hearts and minds of
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:56.640]  the people in Iraq after that country was destroyed by our invasion what's
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:00.080]  your take on what's going on there now somebody who's been there who's been in
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:04.400]  the embassy there in Baghdad somebody who worked for the State Department for a
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:08.560]  couple of decades Alex it's good to be back I think that if we were to
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:12.860]  republish the book today I would probably change the title to I told you so
[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:20.960]  yeah and I take no pleasure in being right in this case when I left
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:27.040]  Iraq in 2010 it was obvious to me that the United States had failed over nine
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:33.280]  years of occupation to address the most fundamental issues that had pulled Iraq
[02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:39.400]  apart after our invasion among those issues the most primary of them was to
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:44.660]  resolve in some way the broad differences between the ethnic groups the
[02:10:44.660 --> 02:10:50.360]  religious groups the tribal groups in Iraq and we'll use the terms Sunni Shia
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:54.760]  and Kurd here in a broad way because I know many of your informed listeners
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:59.640]  understand that within each of those groups there are subgroups and many
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:04.800]  folks who who identify with the Sunni block are actually expressing tribal
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:08.280]  connections more than religious connections and so on but for simplicity
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:14.360]  stake what we'll stick with those three terms Iraq was never a nation prior to
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:20.080]  World War one it was created artificially by the British after the war as they
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:24.040]  took apart the the Turkish Ottoman Empire and the British sort of said well
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:28.280]  let's draw a line here let's draw a line there and and hope it all works out
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:34.400]  they actually group together people that did not get along did not like each
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:40.600]  other did not see themselves as all part of the the same country in this case
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:46.680]  the Sunni group covered a number of borders mostly overflowing between
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:53.080]  what's now called Syria and Iraq the Kurds imagine themselves and independent
[02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:58.080]  people but their homeland if you will crisscross borders with Turkey with
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:03.640]  Iraq with Iran and some other places in the neighborhood the Shias saw
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:08.920]  themselves as a group that crossed the Iraqi border into Iran but none of this
[02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:13.800]  matter none of this matter lines were going to be drawn and off we went after
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:19.320]  periods of relative stability instability Saddam Hussein took power and in
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:23.880]  that in his sense using what clearly were terrible techniques of repression
[02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:30.080]  kept a lid on all this basically brought the groups together enough that they
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:34.840]  held as a nation-state when somebody got out of line he used a lot of force to
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:39.640]  bring them back into line it was imperfect it was horrible but it worked
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:45.040]  in the Middle East to maintain what diplomats call a balance of power an
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:50.880]  uneasy set of relationships that's the history lesson now let's take a look at
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:59.520]  where we are today the Iraq of today is chaos the United States tipped over the
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:05.720]  anthill in 2003 when we did away with Saddam we not only took out one bad guy
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:11.120]  we actually destroyed civil society in Iraq I saw this myself there was no
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:15.560]  electricity nobody was picking up the garbage there were no water people
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:19.360]  couldn't even send their kids to school because the United States threw the
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:23.360]  teachers out of work claiming that they were members of Saddam's political
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:28.040]  party and couldn't be trusted anymore well it's one thing to kick over an
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:33.680]  anthill it's one thing to break stuff that's relatively easy it's another
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:37.560]  thing to try to put something back together and when the United States failed
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:45.160]  to do that and then simply left in 2011 we set the stage for the chaos we're
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:51.440]  seeing in Iraq played out on our TV screens and on the internet today you
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:55.440]  know what you were there about what time because I was looking at this article
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:59.080]  that came out on Sunday from James Risen on the New York Times talking about
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:03.880]  what was going on with black water back in 2007 what time frame were you there I
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:11.200]  was actually in Iraq between 2007 and 2009 excuse me in 2010 but I saw black
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:15.360]  water or whatever name they were going on at that time they change names an
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:20.480]  awful lot the same way you know if you're kiting checks or rotting credit
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:24.240]  card companies or running away from an ex-spouse you know you got to keep on
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:28.280]  the move and change names that's right and I forget what what they were named
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:33.560]  we'll call the John Smith during the time I was there but you know the thing
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:39.600]  about James Risen's article is how personal surprising it is in terms of
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:45.160]  detail as your listeners certainly know the State Department investigators
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:48.880]  who went out to look into what black water was doing were threatened with
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:53.640]  murder their lives were threatened if they continued the investigation and
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:59.940]  while those details are shocking and almost terrifying given how much
[02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:04.040]  money over a billion dollars of taxpayer money was spent to support black
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:09.280]  water the broader strokes of the article were familiar to anyone who had served
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:14.800]  in Iraq we saw these guys I was lucky enough to be embedded with the US
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:20.960]  military and as such my security was dependent on soldiers who were
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:25.960]  professionals who understood what they needed to do in order to protect
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:30.400]  themselves to protect me to do their jobs and I was very lucky whenever I
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:35.080]  visited the embassy or worked with people from the embassy we saw black water
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:40.060]  and as I said in my book we meant well these guys were basically a frat house
[02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:44.520]  with guns that's a great way of describing you're talking about these
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:49.320]  different tribes are the Kurds the Shunis the seaites Shiites and and a lot
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:53.640]  of people who have a biblical background they might recognize them as like the
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:59.040]  Meads the Persians the Babylonians I think that these borders these boundaries
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:02.760]  that were set up by the British Empire when they went in there separating these
[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:06.360]  different groups into different territories and not really setting the
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:10.800]  boundaries as to where the tribes live but then putting some tribes collecting
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:14.720]  them together into Iraq or to Iran or putting part of them into both of those
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:19.160]  countries or into Turkey when the case of the Kurds I think that was deliberate
[02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:23.200]  to kind of divide and conquer these people so it's not really surprising but
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:26.440]  you know we put this other tribe in there this mercenary tribe called
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:30.520]  blackwater which she was just like you said like a you know frat house with
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:35.560]  guns and a bull in a china shop and the attitude that they had given a billion
[02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:39.280]  dollars that they could they could kill anybody that they want and right after
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:44.000]  this incident there with the investigators they in fact did kill
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:47.360]  whoever they wanted I mean they're talking about in terms of details here
[02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:51.800]  they're saying that American personnel were these blackwater personnel were
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:55.520]  known for their swagger their recklessness running cars off the road
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:59.920]  shooting wildly in the streets even killing civilians I mean that's the kind
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:02.480]  of stuff these guys were doing that's why I guess the State Department
[02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:06.080]  investigators were there and they got told that well he will kill you if we
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:12.720]  wish let me give you some examples of blackwater swagger that I saw or or
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:18.960]  experienced firsthand blackwater guy that's the soldiers would work out in
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:22.480]  the gym constantly that was pretty much one of the few things you had to do in
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:27.960]  in your spare time and even though they worked out all the time and ate the same
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:33.440]  food as the blackwater people they got strong but they didn't get crazy the
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:38.400]  blackwater guys were roided out it was obvious to anyone who would ever hung
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:43.160]  around a gym that the difference between the guys who pumped iron honestly and
[02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:47.240]  clean and the guys who were taking steroids the blackwater folks were
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:53.120]  popping veins they they were screaming they were running amok it was obvious
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:58.480]  that they were eating steroids like like candy the other thing the blackwater
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:03.200]  people did is they were legendary for the parties that they held these were
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:08.960]  Roman orgies which is an insult to Romans practically the thing is you had to be
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:14.960]  either a very connected embassy mail to get invited to these things meaning you
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:20.160]  were one of the people who helped oversee the blackwater contracts or you had to
[02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:26.440]  be any type of female whatsoever and the stories that came out of these parties
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:33.240]  were incredible people dancing naked on the bars rifles being fired off people
[02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:37.560]  passed out drunk ambulance is being called to to haul off people with
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:42.360]  alcohol poisoning story after story after story and the next morning the
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:48.000]  blackwater guys would be out there all hung over armed to the teeth the soldiers
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.200]  that I work with constantly made fun of them both both for their hair gel and the
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:57.680]  gold chains they wore out into the field yeah this clip is this picture
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:00.400]  there's on the New York Times article I mean one of those guys it looked like
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:06.960]  Pierce Brosnan you know the guy that's really funny except on steroids yes but
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:11.600]  the other thing the soldiers would often talk about and it wouldn't be with as
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:16.240]  much laughter is how little discipline the blackwater guys had they would
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:21.680]  exercise no none of what we called weapons discipline the idea would be
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:25.720]  that when you get a whole bunch of people armed with automatic weapons one of
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:30.160]  things you want to do is make sure you don't shoot each other and so without
[02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:34.560]  making a bad joke about some of those parties accidental discharges were
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:38.760]  really a critical question you didn't want to accidentally shoot somebody you
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:43.560]  didn't want to accidentally point your gun at a friendly you wanted to make
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:47.800]  sure that you were not a danger to others the blackwater guys exercised
[02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:52.280]  none of that discipline they know no real gun control we're gonna be right
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:57.160]  back after the break we're gonna talk to you a little bit James about ISIS so we
[02:19:57.160 --> 02:20:00.200]  had some comments yesterday Rand Paul was on Hannity I want to get your take on

[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:16.080]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and I am talking to Peter
[02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:20.520]  Van Buren a longtime State Department diplomat he wrote a book on his
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:25.320]  experience he said we meant well how we lost though the hearts and minds of the
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:30.680]  people of Iraq and as Peter was saying earlier he would retitle it I told you
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:35.240]  so one of the things that we've been telling people is that the funding of
[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:41.680]  rebels in Syria by the US government was going to have destabilizing to put it
[02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:46.760]  mildly affects Rand Paul was just on Hannity last night and he talks about
[02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:51.880]  this I wanted to get Peter's take on this sorry Peter to call you James
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:56.160]  Ryzen we've been talking about this James Ryzen revelation about Blackwater
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:59.840]  and how they threatened even State Department officials there so much I've
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:04.120]  called you James James twice here but it's Peter Van Buren and we're going to
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:09.280]  talk to him after this segment about the new book that he has ghosts of Tom Joe
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:13.680]  the story of the 99% I'm anxious to get to that but I want to finish up on a
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:17.680]  rock since you had so much experience there and I wanted to get your take on
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:21.280]  this clip from the Sean Hannity show last night with Rand Paul let's play
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:25.720]  that clip there's a lot of reasons why you know these radical Sunni groups that
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:29.600]  are associated with Al Qaeda this ISIS group why they've become stronger but
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:33.040]  one of the reasons they're stronger is that we have been allied with them in
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:37.320]  Syria we've been funding Islamic rebels who kill Christians we've been funding
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:41.680]  Islamic rebels to fight against Iranian proxies in Syria but now we're on the
[02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:45.080]  other side of the world we would be siding with the Iranian guard if we were
[02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:50.040]  actually put troops in it be fighting I'm not saying that at all and Hannity
[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:55.400]  then tries to spend this back into a shell game as Kurt Nemo puts it in his
[02:25:55.400 --> 02:25:58.560]  article who even better that clip he says blaming that Obama and the
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:03.880]  Democrats are the ones who really created this situation what's your take
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:09.240]  on this on our involvement with ISIS well I'm clear it's clear to me that the
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:14.160]  United States foreign policy is based on a completely failed theory and I think
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:19.360]  Rand Paul get gets at this the United States and as a diplomat for 24 years I
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:24.040]  saw this firsthand the United States has this fantasy image that the world is a
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:28.920]  series of chessboards and the chessboard my labeled Syria and there's one next to
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:33.320]  it and labeled Iraq and another one labeled Iran and so forth and that we
[02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:37.400]  can make moves on one of those boards with which somehow don't affect what
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:42.640]  happens on the other chessboards no of course in reality this world is
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:47.000]  extremely complicated and particularly when you get into the Middle East as we
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:52.040]  talked about earlier in the hour the borders in the United in the Middle East
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:58.560]  are artificial they do not represent where the actual tribal religious lines
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:05.400]  of of unity actually lie the United States has found itself through a series
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:13.120]  of short-term thinking funding rebels in Syria who are now fighting against the
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:19.040]  government that the United States is supporting in Iraq which itself is
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:28.200]  supported by Iran who the United States is opposing for its nuclear program and
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:35.360]  in fact the 800 American troops and counting along with their helicopters
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:39.880]  and drones and aircraft are in a position where we're going to be in a
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:45.040]  supporting role to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard supporting the Shia
[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:50.440]  Maliki government in Iraq let me get your reaction to what Wesley Clark said
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:53.840]  years ago you said there was a plan to go after one country after the other
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:58.080]  talked about Libya Syria then go into Iran and that sort of thing do you
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:01.280]  believe that's the case do you believe that it's the cases as we've been told
[02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:07.200]  by some in the intelligence and military community that Benghazi was an
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:11.800]  effort to supply these rebels so that we could overthrow these governments so
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:17.160]  that we could maintain a constant state of chaos and war in that area in order
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:20.840]  to control it there's a number of things tangled up in there first of all
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:28.000]  general Clark is absolutely correct there was a plan in 2003 to topple
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:33.320]  country after country in the Middle East Iraq was supposed to be the first one
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:38.560]  it was supposed to be quick and the troops were supposed to then turn west
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:46.120]  into Syria meet up with the Israelis in Lebanon and basically in a matter of
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:52.640]  months maybe a little longer create a Middle Eastern quick fix the Iranians
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:58.040]  were expected to basically sue for peace cut a deal they had found they would
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:01.040]  have found themselves at that time with the American army on their western
[02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:05.000]  border in Iraq and the American army on their eastern border in Afghanistan
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:10.240]  that was 2003 and that was the plan unfortunately it unraveled pretty
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:15.840]  quickly in Libya when the United States interceded there we basically repeated
[02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:21.160]  the same mistakes as Iraq we tackled and toppled a strong man Qaddafi in that
[02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:27.760]  case without any plan to replace him many people believe that what was happening
[02:29:27.760 --> 02:29:33.840]  in Benghazi was an attempt by the United States to gather up as many weapons
[02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:39.360]  from Libya as possible particularly shoulder-fired anti-aircraft weapons
[02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:41.520]  hang on we're gonna have to pick this up on the other side of the break we got a
[02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:45.480]  hard break coming up we're talking to Peter van Buren we're gonna be talking
[02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:49.080]  to him about his diplomatic experience in Iraq as well as his new book stay

[02:34:55.520 --> 02:35:01.440]  the re-escalation of Iraq and we've been talking to Peter Van Buren a man who is
[02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:05.360]  a 24-year veteran of the State Department. He spent a year in Iraq. He wrote a
[02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:08.480]  book on it when he came back how I helped lose the battle for the hearts and
[02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:13.280]  minds of the Iraqi people. The title was We Met Well and his website is
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:17.400]  wemetwell.com. We were talking just before the break and I want to get back
[02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:23.080]  to that about Rand Paul's comments last night on Sean Hannity saying that one
[02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:27.440]  of the reasons that ISIS is stronger is that we've been allied with them in
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:31.600]  Syria and we've been funding Islamic rebels but before I do Peter let me

[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:36.760]  World Order and we look at the lyrics we came in just in the first segment when
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:41.440]  you came in with us we're playing Bruce Springsteen's song about the ghost of
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:46.400]  Tom Joed that's the title of your book The Ghost of Tom Joed a story of the
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:51.640]  99% and in that he says welcome to the New World Order families sleeping in
[02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:56.080]  their cars in the Southwest no home no job no peace no rest. I want to get to
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:37:00.080]  that but you were just starting to talk about what had happened in Libya and of
[02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:03.200]  course we've been told by Steve Pachinick and others that in their opinion
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:07.200]  what was happening was something of an international warfare between the CIA one
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:11.880]  group trying to stop the other group from arming terrorists that they were
[02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:16.760]  going to use as surrogates. What's your take on what happened in Libya? A lot of
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:22.280]  people believe that the American facility in Benghazi and we do need to stop
[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:27.800]  calling it a consulate it was not a State Department consulate it was a US
[02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:32.960]  government facility that appeared to be staffed primarily by CIA and so-called
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:38.560]  ex-military contractors if you will and many people believe that one of their
[02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:43.280]  most important jobs there was gathering up weapons off the Libyan battlefield
[02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:49.840]  primarily shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles and transshipping those to Syria.
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:55.440]  It's important if you're the United States and you're trying to supply weapons
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:38:01.160]  to bad guys that your fingerprints are not obviously on them and so there's no
[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:05.480]  easier way to do that than to pick up weapons in one part of the Middle East
[02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:09.880]  put them on a third-country ship and send them off to another part of the
[02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:15.280]  Middle East and it's very possible that was what was going on in Benghazi but
[02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:18.800]  regardless it's critical to understand that the United States has been
[02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:24.200]  supporting the Sunni rebels insurgents gangsters thugs whatever word you want
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:31.280]  to apply in Syria as have our purported allies in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The
[02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:36.840]  fact that these thugs have decided now to stick with their more deeply felt
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:41.680]  allegiances to their brothers in Iraq instead of fighting America's proxy war
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:49.120]  in Syria should surprise absolutely no one. That's right and and it's the same
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:54.160]  people that are essentially pushing these endless wars I believe that are the
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:58.360]  one percent or the one percent tell us now I want to move on to your your new
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:04.040]  book the ghosts of Tom Joe the story of the 99% tell us about that book tell us
[02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:10.480]  what you're talking about there. Ghosts of Tom Joe is a look at the last 50
[02:39:10.480 --> 02:39:18.520]  years of American life it starts out in right after World War two when people
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:22.040]  were able to come home from the wars to have jobs waiting for them when there
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:27.600]  were union jobs factory jobs jobs for white-collar people there were jobs for
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:32.520]  everyone and it was possible by working hard to support your family better
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:38.880]  yourself maybe look forward to a better life for your kids than you had. That
[02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:46.920]  life in America stood for 30 some years until the middle of the 1970s when some
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:51.960]  political decisions and some insights from America's corporate leaders that
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:56.400]  basically they could make as much money or more making things overseas as they
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:40:04.080]  could here in the United States changed the way our life works up until 1973 the
[02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:10.120]  growth curves of the rich and the middle class rose about the same percentages
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:15.360]  about 6% for each the rich obviously got richer but the middle class also saw
[02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:20.680]  their wealth and their wages rise we went over the top of that hill in the
[02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:26.240]  mid 1970s and since then the amount of money and with it the amount of control
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:32.600]  that a very small number of Americans the 1% have has gone skyrocketing while
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:37.600]  the amount of money and wealth and thus power the middle class has has fallen
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:43.360]  dramatically the ghosts of Tom Joe tells that story with some detail but more in
[02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:47.960]  the sense of a human scale there's plenty of great books about economics out
[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:52.200]  there with lots of math in them my book doesn't have any numbers it doesn't have
[02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:58.720]  any math or any formulas in it it's about people it's about us it's about the
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:04.920]  lives we lead the country that we had and the hopes that that Dave we might
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:09.640]  become better people than what we are now I think that was what was so powerful
[02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:15.160]  about the grapes of wrath and I'm reminded of of course that was a
[02:41:15.160 --> 02:41:19.400]  Steinbeck I'm reminded of Hemingway's the Sun also rises were a character there
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:24.440]  was asked how did he go bankrupt and he said well basically two ways first
[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:30.000]  gradually then suddenly I think we've been going gradually bankrupt in this
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:34.240]  country and now there's a sense from I think everybody in terms of every
[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:38.280]  metric that we see that this is happening suddenly this is starting to
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:41.560]  accelerate we're starting to hit the knee of the curve we're starting to go
[02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:46.320]  exponential there's a real dread from people as to what's around the corner
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:51.160]  we've seen what happens with the rust belt but do we have a kind of dust bowl
[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:55.600]  depression in our future and I think a lot of this you're talking about you
[02:41:55.600 --> 02:42:00.960]  know how wealth has come to be consolidated in the hands of a very very
[02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:05.160]  few people as we see the consolidation of corporations we also see the
[02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:08.880]  consolidation of governments don't we and things like NAFTA now we have these
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:12.760]  secret trade agreements the Trans-Pacific Partnership the transatlantic
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:17.840]  partnership being negotiated where these large multinational corporations are
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:22.960]  essentially going to be given sovereign power on the level of former sovereign
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:30.280]  states what ghosts of Tom Jode says is that these things are not by accident
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:36.760]  these aren't the magic of the free markets these aren't what we've come to
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:44.040]  call capitalism doing what it does no what we're seeing is the result of very
[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:49.320]  conscious decisions by a very few people in Washington in some corporate
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:56.480]  executive suites to try to take it all whereas there always were rich people and
[02:42:56.480 --> 02:43:01.120]  there always were poor people for a lot of years in in the United States there
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:05.440]  was always enough for people in the middle class and there was always the
[02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:09.320]  promise of maybe a little bit more particularly if you were willing to work
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:15.000]  hard that has been taken away from us we've recreated instead of the middle
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:18.880]  class something your listeners and everyone out there already knows and
[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:24.000]  that's this thing we call the working poor yes about two-thirds of the people
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:29.560]  who receive food stamps or food benefits are working people these aren't welfare
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:33.680]  queens as the expression goes these aren't people laying on their couch
[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:37.040]  because they're they're too lazy to work or to go they don't want to work they
[02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:41.200]  just want to live off the government that isn't the case these are working
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:46.120]  people one out of every five children in the United States is in a food insecure
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:52.080]  situation this is us that we're talking about and we've been placed here by a
[02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:57.400]  small group of people who wants it all look the CEO of Walmart if you took his
[02:43:57.400 --> 02:44:04.600]  yearly salary and divided into say a 50 hour work week makes over $4,000 an
[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:10.360]  hour oh people there in in your listening area if they work at Walmart are
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:14.720]  hoping to pull down seven or eight dollars an hour and that's based on the
[02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:20.320]  20 maybe 30 hours a week they can squeeze out of it lazy people I don't
[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:25.000]  think so most of the working people that I know are trying to hold down to maybe
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:29.520]  three jobs hoping to put together enough money to take care of themselves and
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:33.800]  their family all that money's going someplace and it's going I'm afraid
[02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:39.760]  straight up you know you're talking about how how jobs moved out of this
[02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:44.080]  country were exported to China and elsewhere those were manufacturing jobs
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:49.160]  essentially at the beginning now what we're looking at is a future where even
[02:44:49.160 --> 02:44:54.640]  service jobs and we were told that well we need to move them offshore because
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:57.840]  we've got unions that have become too powerful these people are getting paid
[02:44:57.840 --> 02:45:01.600]  way more than they should be and maybe that was true to some degree that they
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:05.280]  were that the salaries had been negotiated up to a level that maybe
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:10.360]  wasn't sustainable whatever now we're seeing that service jobs are going to
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:16.840]  be very quickly replaced by automation by robotics we're looking at within just
[02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:21.400]  a few years I believe we're going to see the entire transportation industry that
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:25.240]  that entire service industry disappear you know there's all these fights going
[02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:33.320]  on with taxi drivers and taxi unions with Uber and yet the Uber CEO has said
[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:37.720]  that he wants to see a situation in the future and he's he is paying drivers at
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:42.280]  the moment to take people around in competition to the taxi drivers but he
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:46.800]  wants to see a future where the dude in the car goes away because that dude in
[02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:50.120]  the cars what's making your ride expensive and then he goes on to say
[02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:56.440]  that he envisions a situation where we need to get over the idea that cars are
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:00.440]  hardware that are privately owned we need to see these vehicles as part of
[02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:04.840]  the community no they're actually going to be vehicles that he owns he's going
[02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:09.240]  to be the one who is Uber everything right this this is a good example of
[02:46:09.240 --> 02:46:13.040]  consolidation I think because we're going to see taxi drivers as well as
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:17.600]  truck drivers as well as delivery people that's all going to go away with
[02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:22.920]  these computer driven cars that's coming in the future but tomorrow and right
[02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:26.520]  around the corner you're going to see even greater losses in minimum wage
[02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:30.440]  jobs the majority of people who work for minimum wage or less than minimum wage
[02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:35.160]  are in the food service industry and those jobs are being replaced as we
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:40.040]  speak by touch screens by tablets by other ways of ordering food that don't
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:45.520]  involve human beings the pattern here should be pretty obvious and for the
[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:49.240]  folks who say well you know we couldn't have we couldn't have paid people more
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:55.680]  in those damn unions ruined all this for us you know after 30 years of union
[02:46:55.680 --> 02:46:59.760]  jobs disappearing and people going on food stamps and finding the missiles
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:05.680]  unemployed I just got to ask how'd that work out for us yeah exactly yeah and I
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:09.360]  guess really part of the reason that this war has worked initially is that
[02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:13.920]  when you go to a place like China and people see an increase in their standard
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:18.320]  of living even though their standard of living is still abysmally poor many
[02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:21.720]  people in China we're seeing their standard of living going up by 20 30 40
[02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:27.400]  percent and that made them feel somewhat happy about that another they felt they
[02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:31.120]  were making progress let's put it that way although you do have people committing
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:34.800]  suicide now in these factories sewing notes into clothing saying you know help
[02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:39.120]  us I mean you know there's that side of it but there is also a side of some of
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:41.840]  these people they believe that they're making economic progress however in
[02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:45.400]  America we see just the opposite and we're going to be seeing that all
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:48.400]  throughout Western countries we're going to be seeing just the opposite we're
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:52.240]  going to be seeing people whose standards of living are being dropped by 20
[02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:56.760]  percent 30 percent 40 percent maybe disappearing all together as their jobs
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:48:02.000]  disappear and I think that this we've thought of this transportation
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:05.920]  industry thing is being maybe 10 years out 20 years out now they're talking
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:09.200]  about Google is talking about it being three to five years out they were
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:12.640]  saying at the beginning of the year they had solved essentially they believe the
[02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:15.920]  technical issues and we can talk about that you know the blue screen of death
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:20.800]  if your computer crashes but you know they think that they have solved the
[02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:24.840]  technical issues so the beginning of the year they said what was remaining were
[02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:29.560]  legal issues and about April we saw the European Union as well as California
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:33.760]  saying that starting in just the next few months they're going to allow these
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:37.760]  self-driving cars to be operated without somebody at the wheel ready to take the
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:42.280]  wheel so they're moving the legal issues out of the way and they're ready to start
[02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:47.120]  rolling this out quite literally the patterns are very very clear for anyone
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:52.240]  who wants to take a look at them you know it's funny because when I tried to
[02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:56.560]  sell this book Ghosts of Tom Joe to the publishers in New York City which is
[02:48:56.560 --> 02:49:00.720]  where most of the book publishing industry is located I couldn't get a
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:04.320]  foot in the door what do you mean there's poor people in America what do you
[02:49:04.320 --> 02:49:09.160]  mean that there's people somewhere in between New York and LA who are forced
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:13.320]  to work two or three jobs just to just a whole life together what are you talking
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:16.400]  about we don't see that we don't know anything about that the very first
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:21.680]  publisher I approached outside of New York a group of people in Indiana
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:27.280]  Indiana said we want this book we've been waiting for someone to come along and
[02:49:27.280 --> 02:49:32.280]  tell these stories and I find the very same thing happens now when I speak to
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:37.800]  people around the country I have to kind of check myself and when I'm in the
[02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:41.880]  when I'm on the East Coast I'm in Boston or New York talking about this I find
[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:48.480]  that I have to stop and explain some of these terms and when I speak outside of
[02:49:48.480 --> 02:49:53.440]  these big cities I find that I have to instead say do you know that people in
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:59.280]  New York don't know who you are yeah and don't know how you live and don't care
[02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:04.120]  and probably really really don't care politicians will will show up in our
[02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:08.360]  small towns once every four years promise new jobs promise job training
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:12.680]  promise to fix things up wash their hands in in Purell and then get out of
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:16.360]  town before something sticks to them or we see some politician like Hillary
[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:21.840]  Clinton for example talking about the 99% when she has a half a billion dollars
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:25.400]  given to her foundation by Goldman Sachs they're holding fundraisers in Goldman
[02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:29.360]  Sachs offices she's getting a quarter of a million dollars for a speech at a
[02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:32.600]  university and the students are saying what's going on what's wrong with this

[02:54:07.400 --> 02:54:11.080]  to the Alex Jones show I've just been talking to Peter Van Buren the author of
[02:54:11.080 --> 02:54:16.200]  a new book ghosts of Tom Joe the story of the 99% and just before we went to the
[02:54:16.200 --> 02:54:21.080]  break I was talking about that phony champion of the 99% Hillary Clinton
[02:54:21.080 --> 02:54:27.960]  Peter you used to work for her at the State Department didn't you work under
[02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:32.760]  her will say yeah I worked at a fairly low level at the State Department and
[02:54:32.760 --> 02:54:36.280]  for most of my career had little contact with the Secretary of State's office
[02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:41.160]  however once I wrote my whistle-blowing book we meant well about the war in
[02:54:41.160 --> 02:54:49.000]  Iraq it was Mrs. Clinton staff that ran the campaign to push me out of the State
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:54.720]  Department in particular one of her deputies slash henchmen is a name that
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:57.560]  many of your listeners either are familiar with or should be familiar with
[02:54:57.560 --> 02:55:05.360]  Pat Kennedy Pat Kennedy's name was on the 2007 report from Iraq exonerating
[02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:11.920]  blackwater from any misdealings Pat Kennedy was the lead person explaining
[02:55:11.920 --> 02:55:17.840]  why Hillary Clinton was not guilty of anything over the Benghazi disaster and
[02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:22.600]  Pat Kennedy was the person who signed off on all of the attempts to persecute
[02:55:22.600 --> 02:55:27.320]  and prosecute me at the Department of State he's a bureaucrat he's a person
[02:55:27.320 --> 02:55:32.480]  that doesn't appear in public very often but as the Hillary campaign cranks up
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:38.880]  in the documentaries triumph of Hillary's will are released keep an eye
[02:55:38.880 --> 02:55:42.800]  out for that name you're surprised where it pops up yeah I'll just refer
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:45.560]  people to that James Ryzen story that we were talking about from the New York
[02:55:45.560 --> 02:55:48.440]  Times on Sunday about blackwater and what we were talking about in the first
[02:55:48.440 --> 02:55:52.080]  part of the interview people can check out his credentials and his credibility
[02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:57.000]  by learning what really went on with blackwater in Iraq is that's coming out
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:01.960]  now Peter tell us a little bit about your book now you said it starts in the
[02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:06.360]  1950s and goes forward it's a fictional account that really is kind of a more of
[02:56:06.360 --> 02:56:10.960]  a it's not a an economics text it's not a political text you're not going through
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:14.720]  metrics you're really going through the kind of visceral experience that people
[02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:19.560]  are going through as America is as I said before approaching bankruptcy first
[02:56:19.560 --> 02:56:24.600]  gradually and then we're afraid maybe now suddenly does it go further into the
[02:56:24.600 --> 02:56:28.600]  future from where we are is it coming up to the present it takes us right up till
[02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:35.080]  till today and it is based on we it's fiction in the sense that I've put this
[02:56:35.080 --> 02:56:39.760]  story all in in one family to make it easier to read and a little more
[02:56:39.760 --> 02:56:44.240]  comfortable of a story because economics at the end of the day is not
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:49.320]  about numbers it's about people and just like my book about Iraq that I lived
[02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:54.360]  by this story itself touches my my own life and I'm sure the lives of many
[02:56:54.360 --> 02:57:00.520]  others I grew up in the Rust Belt in Ohio I saw firsthand the loss of jobs the
[02:57:00.520 --> 02:57:06.560]  factory closings I was able to leave that area and get a job with the State
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:11.640]  Department but when I came back as a 54 year old out of work at the State
[02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:16.480]  Department I went back into the minimum wage economy and saw firsthand how this
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:20.360]  is all working now I spoke with an endless number of people who were in the
[02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:24.760]  same situation and then went back to the Midwest and spent most of the summer
[02:57:24.760 --> 02:57:30.040]  traveling there talking with folks spent some time living out of my car and came
[02:57:30.040 --> 02:57:36.480]  to understand what was happening to our own selves our our own people Americans
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:42.200]  who were abandoned by their government who were left aside by a very few
[02:57:42.200 --> 02:57:47.560]  hyper wealthy people who saw them not as human beings but essentially the same
[02:57:47.560 --> 02:57:53.920]  way that people would look at animals or cattle or farm animals a quantity that
[02:57:53.920 --> 02:57:57.440]  needed to be kept fed for what they were going to do and then when they were no
