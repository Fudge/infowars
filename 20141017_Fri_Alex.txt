[00:00.000 --> 00:13.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.120 --> 00:21.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.880 --> 00:31.360]  we've got Nigerians flying in vomiting to death on board aircraft the controlled
[00:31.360 --> 00:34.680]  corporate media instantly announces there's nothing to see here move along
[00:34.680 --> 00:41.600]  as the CDC secretly tells New York City to get ready for Ebola outbreaks just
[00:41.600 --> 00:48.120]  about 15 minutes ago news radio 590 a.m. one of our local affiliates did report
[00:48.120 --> 00:51.160]  and the story's gonna go up on info wars.com in a few minutes we're calling
[00:51.160 --> 00:55.440]  the health department that someone has been quarantined in Travis County where
[00:55.440 --> 01:01.160]  the city of Austin Texas resides or is based there it is on screen Austin
[01:01.160 --> 01:06.520]  officials monitoring Travis County resident that was on flight 1143 with
[01:06.520 --> 01:11.920]  one of the Ebola victims and now they're monitoring a top epidemiologist in Dallas
[01:11.920 --> 01:16.640]  who worked with the Ebola victims who may have Ebola meanwhile look at this head
[01:16.640 --> 01:21.400]  line of the Associated Press we've been telling this for a few weeks Africa
[01:21.400 --> 01:29.200]  stems of Bola via border closings not allowing aircraft in in quote luck
[01:29.200 --> 01:34.360]  South American countries Caribbean countries Asian countries Middle Eastern
[01:34.360 --> 01:38.240]  countries European countries have all been sealing their borders in the last
[01:38.240 --> 01:43.680]  two months but not the United States because there's a war on common sense
[01:43.680 --> 01:49.120]  and they've got to let it start spreading first America is now a giant
[01:49.120 --> 01:55.920]  toilet and Ebola is squatting over it spraying out the virus with enjoyment
[01:55.920 --> 02:01.560]  and this is all part of the total disdain in fact there's even an article
[02:01.560 --> 02:10.400]  out today out of the Guardian also the Wall Street Journal who do they think
[02:10.400 --> 02:17.480]  they are the administration's Ebola evasions reveals its disdain for the
[02:17.480 --> 02:25.160]  American people yes it's all about disdain and a war on reality a war on
[02:25.160 --> 02:32.080]  common sense I want to explain something they don't have one they don't have to
[02:32.080 --> 02:39.200]  they have three articles in the White House run media matters this week and
[02:39.200 --> 02:45.680]  they have everything from the Washington Post and CBS News again this week so
[02:45.680 --> 02:50.160]  many hit pieces I don't even keep track of them basically saying I'm a fear
[02:50.160 --> 02:54.320]  monger I'm evil I'm bad when all I'm doing is pointing out default common
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.040]  sense remember two months ago I keep harping on this because it shows their
[02:59.040 --> 03:03.480]  complicity this could only happen here because the dinosaur media says
[03:03.480 --> 03:09.120]  everyone's crazy or quote deranged right-wing conspiracy theory Obama
[03:09.120 --> 03:12.760]  intentionally wants to infect the nation with Ebola Alex Jones says yes
[03:12.760 --> 03:19.800]  that's what I'm saying because when you leave the flights open and you bring
[03:19.800 --> 03:23.720]  Ebola patients here and then you don't quarantine people immediately you want
[03:23.720 --> 03:30.880]  it to get out of hand so you can then have a big power grab and they've had
[03:30.880 --> 03:35.520]  governors and senators and even the Speaker of the House say shut down the
[03:35.520 --> 03:41.720]  flights and it hasn't happened because you could never send the message that
[03:41.720 --> 03:45.160]  had like Michael Savage said last week when he was on that having a border might
[03:45.160 --> 03:54.480]  do something good so that's what's happening and in this bizarro world I
[03:54.480 --> 03:58.400]  wasn't being sarcastic a few weeks ago I said you watch when this spreads
[03:58.400 --> 04:04.240]  everywhere I will get the blame and now it's happening
[04:04.240 --> 04:10.360]  imagine how they've overturned reality how they've inverted common sense it's
[04:10.360 --> 04:17.640]  satanic that's really all satanic means is upside down doesn't make sense isn't
[04:17.640 --> 04:26.560]  productive isn't wholesome isn't prosperous isn't honorable isn't fun the
[04:26.560 --> 04:31.560]  media and the culture sells you know evil like it's fun no it's not fun not
[04:31.560 --> 04:37.360]  real evil the church is harp all day about you know sex or the wrong kind of
[04:37.360 --> 04:41.400]  music or something like that while meanwhile they you know endorse killing
[04:41.400 --> 04:46.800]  a million Iraqis aborting 50 million babies in essay spying government

[08:27.160 --> 08:36.440]  17th day of October 2014 edition and this upcoming Halloween may have some
[08:36.440 --> 08:44.760]  ghoulish horror characters that aren't fiction ladies and gentlemen if the
[08:44.760 --> 08:52.200]  allowed spread of Ebola continues in the United States and if the West African
[08:52.200 --> 08:59.560]  flights continue with over 150 people a day pouring in with visas issued to them
[08:59.560 --> 09:09.440]  out of countries that are literally collapsing in fact the news is so
[09:09.440 --> 09:12.560]  important today that I have canceled some of the gas cleared the decks for
[09:12.560 --> 09:16.960]  three hours on this Friday edition we're going to have reporters Anthony
[09:16.960 --> 09:22.880]  Gutiarty and Paul Joseph Watson whose extended to stay from London here in the
[09:22.880 --> 09:29.880]  United States are going to be in Dallas reporting we now have breaking from news
[09:29.880 --> 09:35.520]  radio 590 a.m. we'll link this up on info wars dot com UT student being
[09:35.520 --> 09:39.640]  monitored for Ebola virus and someone else who was on the flight with the
[09:39.640 --> 09:44.280]  nurse who had it is now being quarantined in Austin Texas so we'll
[09:44.280 --> 09:48.720]  integrate both those articles together and post them up on prison planet dot
[09:48.720 --> 09:57.000]  com and info wars dot com I did some of the math this morning with the different
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.720]  aircraft flights and how many people are in the hospital and what we know
[10:01.720 --> 10:08.680]  probably about a thousand people came in close contact with one of the two
[10:08.680 --> 10:15.520]  Ebola patients well it's now the three Ebola patients excuse me the dead one of
[10:15.520 --> 10:23.280]  the two nurses as a conservative number thousand let's say 50 get it spread it for
[10:23.280 --> 10:31.360]  21 days now that'll be a thousand or so that have it and then they spread it for
[10:31.360 --> 10:37.600]  21 days and it's tens of thousands and at that point Katie bar the door with our
[10:37.600 --> 10:40.880]  compromise immune systems from all the vaccines that lower your immune system on
[10:40.880 --> 10:45.760]  record the winner all the other super viruses and super bacteria and MRSA
[10:45.760 --> 10:50.600]  that's just ravaging everyone I know everyone I know has family members that
[10:50.600 --> 10:54.000]  were totally healthy who go into have minor surgeries and are dead in a hammer
[10:54.000 --> 11:01.360]  a month later so long before the Ebola outbreak I said back in January when I
[11:01.360 --> 11:06.240]  had multiple family members die from flesh-eating bacteria in their lungs
[11:06.240 --> 11:10.680]  basically I don't want to go into details but I was there at the hospital and
[11:10.680 --> 11:16.120]  witnessed what they were sucking out of their lungs there was lung tissue get
[11:16.120 --> 11:19.680]  ready because my gut but also intellectually looking at the news
[11:19.680 --> 11:25.560]  every day whoo this is going to be one hell of a winner and if you think going
[11:25.560 --> 11:28.560]  out and getting a flu shot it's going to protect you I got a bridge I'm ready to
[11:28.560 --> 11:33.960]  sell you right now on Pluto now here's the AP not Alex Jones and I only say
[11:33.960 --> 11:39.840]  this because two months ago CBS News the Washington Post
[11:39.840 --> 11:48.120]  Geraldo Rivera Fox News you name it they did it came out in the tact info wars
[11:48.120 --> 11:54.240]  calm Alex Jones by name Matt drudge by name drudge report calm because we dare
[11:54.240 --> 11:58.680]  link to the CDC's own papers from two years ago saying it may be going airborne
[11:58.680 --> 12:02.960]  we dared linked epidemiologists and articles in Europe saying they believe
[12:02.960 --> 12:06.040]  it would come here in mass we didn't shut the borders and shut down flights and
[12:06.040 --> 12:11.480]  their answer was we were racist pieces of garbage do we get any apologies no we
[12:11.480 --> 12:16.760]  don't and it's not about me being right I didn't want to have a bowler here I
[12:16.760 --> 12:22.240]  have three children okay that's why I was concerned if you've got the biggest
[12:22.240 --> 12:28.120]  outbreak ever spreading all over Africa the UN has says between 400 to 1.4 to 5
[12:28.120 --> 12:33.000]  million people will get it or die the computer model show that whole spectrum
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.320]  they're gonna want to come here everybody else won't let them come here
[12:37.320 --> 12:42.560]  it's not hard to figure out what's gonna happen and I just want to point out
[12:42.560 --> 12:47.880]  there's a new meme going and John bound pointed this out earlier that people are
[12:47.880 --> 12:52.440]  calling for Obama's arrest the CDC's arrest and so you guys aren't gonna get
[12:52.440 --> 12:57.200]  away with it this time creating a crisis exacerbating it now Joe Biggs
[12:57.200 --> 13:00.880]  filed this report yesterday with Josh Owens they went out to UT talked to 30
[13:00.880 --> 13:08.480]  people 17 of them 17 of them wanted to bring a bowl of patients here from
[13:08.480 --> 13:13.520]  Africa and they want to house them in their house the video the article is up
[13:13.520 --> 13:18.200]  on info wars.com students sign petition to bring Ebola into US students also
[13:18.200 --> 13:25.160]  agree to host Ebola patients entering the US Paul Watson's article liberal sign
[13:25.160 --> 13:28.640]  petition to bring Ebola patients in the US and house them students show
[13:28.640 --> 13:33.640]  enthusiastic support for the Ebola Equality Act of 2014 here is the
[13:33.640 --> 13:39.920]  devastating report with Joe Biggs and Josh Owens on Joe Biggs with info wars.com
[13:39.920 --> 13:44.560]  at the University of Texas Austin now came out here to the campus today I
[13:44.560 --> 13:51.880]  wanted to ask people if they would sign my Ebola Equality Act of 2014 now what
[13:51.880 --> 13:56.560]  the states is that we are going to allow symptomatic non symptomatic Ebola
[13:56.560 --> 14:00.560]  patients to come in from West Africa into our country and then give them the
[14:00.560 --> 14:04.160]  the free reign to move around and do whatever they want we leave our borders
[14:04.160 --> 14:08.480]  wide open we let everybody come in and get taken care of you know we we don't
[14:08.480 --> 14:10.320]  like to take care of the veterans or anything like that that's just
[14:10.320 --> 14:14.120]  ridiculous let's let's bring these Ebola patients in and you know there's not
[14:14.120 --> 14:19.000]  gonna be an outbreak because Obama says there's not or Ebola and then the CDC
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.240]  director says there's zero chance that this is gonna get out of control so you
[14:24.240 --> 14:27.400]  know what let's see how many people actually agree with these puppets with
[14:27.400 --> 14:32.240]  these global elitists who actually think that nothing is gonna happen let's see
[14:32.240 --> 14:38.240]  how many people are I don't want to say dumb but willing to actually sign this
[14:38.240 --> 14:42.880]  and allow Ebola to come into our country let's go check it out well this is the
[14:42.880 --> 14:47.080]  Ebola Equality Act what it's gonna do is allow us to fly in patients with Ebola
[14:47.080 --> 14:50.400]  so what this does is we're gonna allow them just to get on the plane symptomatic
[14:50.400 --> 14:54.880]  or not fly on over it'll be commercial airline you know CDC says you're not
[14:54.880 --> 14:57.560]  gonna get it it's not airborne so you're fine you know a lot of people out
[14:57.560 --> 15:00.360]  here being raised is saying that we should just like shut down flights and
[15:00.360 --> 15:04.120]  not allow people to come in here to our country with Ebola I mean that's pretty
[15:04.120 --> 15:08.960]  ridiculous right we have better medical facilities don't we can you believe all
[15:08.960 --> 15:12.080]  these people that say we should just stop flights from West Africa and I think
[15:12.080 --> 15:16.920]  it's insane I mean it like I get their concerns and everything but I mean the CDC
[15:16.920 --> 15:19.920]  knows exactly what they're doing right right and I also think it might be a
[15:19.920 --> 15:23.240]  racialized hold on I don't want to touch that yet I gotta sanitize my hands
[15:23.240 --> 15:27.920]  and there can never be too careful you know I don't know where anybody's been
[15:27.920 --> 15:31.560]  around here all right thanks and we can get them some football tickets baseball
[15:31.560 --> 15:37.560]  tickets hang out there's still people they deserve to be taken care of that's
[15:37.560 --> 15:41.040]  what Obamacare is for we're gonna leave the southern borders open to if they
[15:41.040 --> 15:44.800]  want to you know take a flight to you know Costa Rica and then travel up to
[15:44.800 --> 15:47.640]  Mexico and come in they can come in that way there's no one watching anyways
[15:47.640 --> 15:51.560]  President Obama says you'll be fine so there's nothing to worry about no I'm
[15:51.560 --> 15:55.760]  a nurse I'm a study nurse and that's I'm like yeah bring people with Ebola over
[15:55.760 --> 16:01.120]  here why does it seem shocking I think I'll pass thank you don't want to bring
[16:01.120 --> 16:05.800]  Ebola to the country our president does come on the CDC says it's fine people
[16:05.800 --> 16:10.360]  with Ebola deserve to live come on look we're gonna bring them into the country
[16:10.360 --> 16:13.800]  fly them over get them healthcare come on excuse me do you want to help save
[16:13.800 --> 16:21.400]  lives in West Africa no one cares we're bunch of racist oh and if you initial
[16:21.400 --> 16:25.320]  here that's just agreeing that you'll you know take one of the patients in and
[16:25.320 --> 16:29.680]  help them out all right okay there we go you're gonna initial well hold that
[16:29.680 --> 16:34.800]  real quick Nick can never be too careful whether some bowl of stuff going

[16:39.040 --> 16:42.920]  a host do we like not initially yeah if you don't want to let an Ebola patient
[16:42.920 --> 16:47.680]  live with you then just don't initial there's a lot of people who do though but
[16:47.680 --> 16:51.000]  I mean then again if you don't want to die I mean that's safe to say yeah and
[16:51.000 --> 16:54.600]  just make sure you guys wear a mask and stuff no one else has gotten with all
[16:54.600 --> 16:58.960]  the equipment on right oh never mind those nurses did it's who knows maybe
[16:58.960 --> 17:03.840]  our government is crazy so this is how people come over here to be cured or yeah
[17:03.840 --> 17:07.360]  to bring them into our country so they can live a normal life I don't want
[17:07.360 --> 17:11.280]  any more people to die of Ebola do you there's lots of people dying bleeding out
[17:11.280 --> 17:16.200]  of their eyes and ears and mouth and it's horrible but I mean we'll bring them

[17:22.720 --> 17:25.040]  their family to be administered will hospital receive the best treatment in
[17:25.040 --> 17:28.320]  the world we've got Obamacare that takes care of everything that's free so come
[17:28.320 --> 17:33.160]  on help save some lives the more Ebola patients we bring into America the
[17:33.160 --> 17:39.120]  better don't you guys agree receive medical care and reunite with their
[17:39.120 --> 17:42.560]  families if they have some you know like what Thomas it would be able to come
[17:42.560 --> 17:46.120]  here yeah let's bring him in Obama says it's fine the CD says the CDC says it's
[17:46.120 --> 17:53.520]  fine oh you think so I'm sorry oh hold on I gotta put my hand sanitizer on
[17:53.520 --> 17:58.640]  there I don't know where you guys been either can never be too careful all right
[17:58.640 --> 18:01.680]  good and I don't have a bowl of them all right well let's take care of the ones
[18:01.680 --> 18:06.040]  who do and bring them here and let them have fun open up the borders all right
[18:06.040 --> 18:09.840]  thanks guys have a good Ebola day the ones who survived got blood
[18:09.840 --> 18:13.200]  transfusions though but the ones who keep getting these experimental drugs die
[18:13.200 --> 18:17.520]  but you know President Obama and CDC knows best it's not like they've ever
[18:17.520 --> 18:22.000]  intentionally done stuff to harm us like push vaccines or anything cool make
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.800]  sure you get your flu shot too you know I think it's racist all these Republicans
[18:25.800 --> 18:27.920]  all these people are saying that we should shut down flights from West Africa
[18:27.920 --> 18:31.600]  not let them come in well you think that's pretty ridiculous now it's like I
[18:31.600 --> 18:37.200]  saw this news where they rejected a kid from college because he's from over
[18:37.200 --> 18:42.640]  there and he might have Ebola and it's like he's smart and he's studying why
[18:42.640 --> 18:46.120]  you're gonna stop them from that that's retarded let's let them all over here
[18:46.120 --> 18:49.280]  right yeah oh and if you want if you initial here then that's saying that
[18:49.280 --> 18:52.480]  you'll host in a bowl of patient you'll let them come over and hang out you take
[18:52.480 --> 18:59.720]  care of and read them stories you know oh cool thanks we'll get a hold of you
[18:59.720 --> 19:05.920]  guys and we bring the Ebola patients in as you can see I just spoke to about 30
[19:05.920 --> 19:11.120]  people and the most disturbing part of this is that of 30 people I was able to
[19:11.120 --> 19:16.640]  get 17 signatures an entire full clipboard in less than an hour these
[19:16.640 --> 19:22.320]  are the youth that are supposed to be going to college and taking on positions
[19:22.320 --> 19:28.320]  to help further our country and this just blows my mind and I'll check this
[19:28.320 --> 19:34.440]  out one two three four five six seven eight nine ten ten eleven people eleven
[19:34.440 --> 19:38.880]  people out of 17 initial at the end we're only remembering the beginning I
[19:38.880 --> 19:43.040]  said if you initial at the end you allow a symptomatic Ebola patient to come live
[19:43.040 --> 19:49.160]  at your home eleven people said yes to that you know some people came by and
[19:49.160 --> 19:52.720]  looked at me said are you crazy our government's out of their mind some
[19:52.720 --> 19:54.960]  people just laughed when I was sitting out there saying hey let's bring a
[19:54.960 --> 20:00.440]  bowl into the country come on don't be racist you know but there's still 17
[20:00.440 --> 20:03.440]  people who are one day are gonna become doctors because some of the people who
[20:03.440 --> 20:08.240]  signed this said they were a nursing school some were gonna be doctors these
[20:08.240 --> 20:12.840]  this is why the CDC is messed up as it is we have a bunch of people on there we
[20:12.840 --> 20:16.520]  have no idea what they're doing and they're putting American lives at risk
[20:16.520 --> 20:24.960]  this is mind-blowing that video in an article by Paul Joseph Watson is up on
[20:24.960 --> 20:30.200]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com right now the video is perfect to wake
[20:30.200 --> 20:35.880]  people up and we also last year did a piece with Leanne we're nine out of ten
[20:35.880 --> 20:40.440]  she talked like 30 people and three of them did not want to ban dihydrogen
[20:40.440 --> 20:45.360]  monoxide which of course is the scientific name of water they said for
[20:45.360 --> 20:49.520]  the earth for Obama we want to ban dihydrogen monoxide you know arrest
[20:49.520 --> 20:55.160]  whoever has it and people go oh yeah I'm from Cornell I'm a I'm a chemistry
[20:55.160 --> 21:02.760]  you know PhD or whatever or I've got a doctorate in chemistry and I agree and
[21:02.760 --> 21:07.160]  they were just sitting there hitting on Leanne not knowing what planet they're
[21:07.160 --> 21:14.400]  on and that's why America is so pathetic now because it's not just the general
[21:14.400 --> 21:18.600]  public but government and corporations are filled with people like this as
[21:18.600 --> 21:24.560]  well just a little less stupid a little less dumb a little less self-centered
[21:24.560 --> 21:27.680]  when it comes to not knowing any information they'll usually have some
[21:27.680 --> 21:31.480]  scam or angle they play over and over again on sheep they're a little bit
[21:31.480 --> 21:37.800]  stupider than them who wants to promote a society like this we showed everyone
[21:37.800 --> 21:47.680]  they talked to 30 people 17 shined to bring masses of Ebola patients into the
[21:47.680 --> 21:52.280]  US and to bring them to sports stadiums and to bring them to live with
[21:52.280 --> 21:57.920]  families and stay at their homes people like yeah it's racist we need to bring
[21:57.920 --> 22:02.920]  them in you could tell these trendies they stick your hand in a blender stick
[22:02.920 --> 22:05.760]  your hand in a garbage disposal your racist and a lot of one run over I'm
[22:05.760 --> 22:11.440]  not joking and go I stick their arm in it just to prove it's their religion just
[22:11.440 --> 22:15.040]  like Michael Savage said last week he's totally right that it is a religion to
[22:15.040 --> 22:18.480]  keep the border open a religion to bring in the third world populations and they
[22:18.480 --> 22:23.160]  can do nothing to ever say we shouldn't have cholera which we now have
[22:23.160 --> 22:28.160]  exploding in the US compared to previous numbers we now have exploding bizarre
[22:28.160 --> 22:34.160]  liver flukes and flesh-eating bacteria and all sorts of weird parasites out of
[22:34.160 --> 22:37.400]  South America and Africa
[22:39.480 --> 22:43.440]  it's kind of like boa constrictors getting dumped out in Florida and they're
[22:43.440 --> 22:48.000]  now killing most of the wildlife and taking over you it's the same thing with
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.800]  diseases ladies and gentlemen we don't want to bring all these diseases in this
[22:53.800 --> 23:00.600]  is a real issue they always go oh that's the classic thing racists always say no
[23:00.600 --> 23:06.440]  I don't care if you were German Irish or Chinese coming in here 110 years ago to
[23:06.440 --> 23:09.880]  Ellis Island you sat out there for months to make sure you didn't have a
[23:09.880 --> 23:13.840]  communicable disease and then when you were cleared you were let in and if you
[23:13.840 --> 23:20.600]  had something that passed you were let in but if you had leprosy which used to
[23:20.600 --> 23:24.840]  just be the scourge of the world leprosy used to just be all over Europe all over
[23:24.840 --> 23:29.120]  the place people would be down on the street corner begging and you'd throw
[23:29.120 --> 23:33.240]  coins at them just a hundred something years ago in Europe in London they'd be
[23:33.240 --> 23:39.600]  wearing bags over their heads in black and gloves with their fingers and noses
[23:39.600 --> 23:43.480]  rotting off and they would still they rounded them up and shipped them to
[23:43.480 --> 23:48.040]  leper colonies out on Caribbean islands in places people say well that's a mean
[23:48.040 --> 23:51.520]  that's not nice well at a certain point you get tired of your kids getting
[23:51.520 --> 23:58.560]  cholera or your kids getting leprosy or your kids getting smallpox or your
[23:58.560 --> 24:09.480]  children getting a Ebola drudge put out the tweet self quarantine and that's
[24:09.480 --> 24:16.640]  exactly what I intend to do when Ebola cases start getting up into the 10,000 or
[24:16.640 --> 24:26.320]  so in the US if it gets up to that I will self quarantine my children and I
[24:26.320 --> 24:30.520]  will have to work with my family with who wants to lock themselves basically in
[24:30.520 --> 24:35.920]  the house with them around the property and then I'm just going to stay here at
[24:35.920 --> 24:41.760]  the office I guess I've already had to think about that just can't believe how
[24:41.760 --> 24:47.480]  screwed up this is because if you get Ebola it's gonna kill you 70% of the
[24:47.480 --> 24:51.560]  time and that's with top medical care once things degenerate and break down
[24:51.560 --> 24:57.800]  one patient had rooms stacked to the ceiling of bloody bandages and feces
[24:57.800 --> 25:05.600]  that was reported out of Dallas one patient did that because the virus just
[25:05.600 --> 25:10.440]  keeps replicating and replicating and just displaces upwards of 10% of your
[25:10.440 --> 25:16.600]  body fluids and you just melt upwards of 10% of your fluids just become the
[25:16.600 --> 25:22.320]  virus it just breeds and breeds and breeds until you pop like a giant blood
[25:22.320 --> 25:30.000]  filled vomit filled feces filled zit and I don't mean to be gross here I just
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.880]  want you to know that they're doing this on purpose and then and they're gonna
[25:34.880 --> 25:40.080]  have made for TV movies about how what a hero Obama is and the heroes the nurses
[25:40.080 --> 25:44.760]  are and how once it spread Obamacare in the feds the army stopped it but they
[25:44.760 --> 25:50.360]  let it get going to begin with the flights are still open from Africa the
[25:50.360 --> 25:58.400]  border still wide open here's AP Africa stems Ebola via border closings and
[25:58.400 --> 26:03.640]  luck member who told you to shut down the border crossings and to shut down
[26:03.640 --> 26:07.320]  flies from West Africa two months ago I am no rocket scientist that is the
[26:07.320 --> 26:14.560]  default what you do federal law common sense age-old if a country had a
[26:14.560 --> 26:22.640]  outbreak of the black plague what did you do you did not let their ships dock
[26:22.640 --> 26:28.440]  in your port if a ship had anyone with signs of plague on it they had to fly a
[26:28.440 --> 26:34.520]  white flag with a black spot on it and if you tried to land in any port you got
[26:34.520 --> 26:39.760]  sunk and if you got caught coming in with plague and lying about it they would
[26:39.760 --> 26:48.080]  take every one of you in and then they would hang your butt or force you back
[26:48.080 --> 26:51.880]  on the ship train the guns on it this is in naval history that's why I've read
[26:51.880 --> 26:55.000]  so many books on naval history and they would make you go out in the harbor and
[26:55.000 --> 27:02.200]  then start opening up on you because Europe saw about a third of their people
[27:02.200 --> 27:05.600]  die from it so they were a little bit concerned about it you might be too you
[27:05.600 --> 27:11.200]  have a third to half depending on what country died from bubonic plague and by
[27:11.200 --> 27:15.800]  the way bubonic plague is nothing compared to Ebola because you've got to
[27:15.800 --> 27:19.160]  touch it to get it and then not everybody you end up getting killed by
[27:19.160 --> 27:24.840]  if you've got good nutrition sometimes you can fight it off Ebola it's just
[27:24.840 --> 27:30.360]  unbelievable and this is their October surprise I predict Obama will sign
[27:30.360 --> 27:33.440]  executive orders on the power plants will sign executive orders on open
[27:33.440 --> 27:36.560]  borders will sign executive order he's already said he will in the middle of
[27:36.560 --> 27:42.080]  this crisis and they'll probably they already had MSNBC with an article two
[27:42.080 --> 27:46.480]  weeks ago saying the second amendment is the reason Ebola is breaking out and I
[27:46.480 --> 27:49.480]  read the article and couldn't even understand their argument I mean even
[27:49.480 --> 27:52.080]  though it was a bologna argument I couldn't even understand what they were
[27:52.080 --> 27:57.520]  saying that's how mentally ill these people are and committed to wrecking the
[27:57.520 --> 28:01.800]  country committed to bringing in global government committed to driving down the
[28:01.800 --> 28:07.120]  wages committed to clowered and piven to blow the engine of the economy and
[28:07.120 --> 28:12.000]  they're doing an excellent job Obama's job is to bring the country down that
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.440]  isn't rhetoric that's their real policy that's their real gold and if you don't
[28:17.440 --> 28:24.560]  realize that you're insane people are concerned out there and and quite
[28:24.560 --> 28:31.920]  frankly that's good because enough massive concern about this enough phone
[28:31.920 --> 28:37.560]  calls to talk radio and the mainstream media and to Congress and to Obama
[28:37.560 --> 28:41.560]  they've got Boehner coming out two days ago and saying recall stop the flights
[28:41.560 --> 28:45.480]  control the border when he wasn't saying that a week ago now two days ago he is
[28:45.480 --> 28:49.720]  you got gentle three weeks ago doing the right thing a little bit of trepidation
[28:49.720 --> 28:55.520]  Rick Perry said a little bit under pressure you've got Senator Ted Cruz
[28:55.520 --> 29:00.920]  saying block all the flights but this should have been done two months ago it
[29:00.920 --> 29:05.560]  may be too late now and they're going to go on the news and they are going on the
[29:05.560 --> 29:10.520]  news saying you better take the flu shot or if you've got flu symptoms you're
[29:10.520 --> 29:14.000]  gonna be quarantined so see that's where this goes they let it get out of hand
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.040]  then they start quarantining a bunch of innocent people who are already sick and
[29:18.040 --> 29:23.680]  sticking them in Ebola camps to breed it well I got a little newsflash for you
[29:23.680 --> 29:29.520]  I'm not going to your Obama Ebola camp and the army is not gonna be able to
[29:29.520 --> 29:33.200]  enforce it and here's another issue that's why they let it get out of hand I
[29:33.200 --> 29:37.160]  told you they want to pull a civil war they want to pull a collapse set nukes
[29:37.160 --> 29:40.720]  off we got missing nukes biological outbreaks I've been saying for a couple
[29:40.720 --> 29:44.480]  years biological outbreaks one of the main cards they've got and this thing is
[29:44.480 --> 29:48.640]  staged any way you slice it this is what it's like to live under these criminals
[29:48.640 --> 29:53.360]  we're on the match stay weather the empires on the open phones Alex Jones
[29:53.360 --> 29:58.280]  and the GCN radio they are on the run so they're overturning the whole chessboard
[29:59.560 --> 30:04.960]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[30:04.960 --> 30:08.480]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[30:08.480 --> 30:12.520]  outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[30:12.520 --> 30:16.720]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[30:16.720 --> 30:20.560]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[30:20.560 --> 30:24.720]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[30:24.720 --> 30:28.480]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[30:28.480 --> 30:31.880]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[30:31.880 --> 30:35.560]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to

[33:56.240 --> 34:08.480]  empire of deceit telling the truth is treason it's not a big deal to know you
[34:08.480 --> 34:12.480]  should halt flights it's not smart to know you should send Ebola patients to
[34:12.480 --> 34:15.520]  level four government facilities they've built and spent hundreds of
[34:15.520 --> 34:24.320]  billions on in the last 30 years it's not rocket science but the army went in
[34:24.320 --> 34:29.560]  on the east coast in fact pull that clip up please in 1989 when Ebola went
[34:29.560 --> 34:40.440]  airborne pbs reported and cleaned it up the cdc doesn't even do that fema

[36:46.040 --> 36:51.240]  our houses and read to them and take them to sporting events one student and
[36:51.240 --> 37:00.640]  then it looks like you know 12 more UT workers said are you kidding but the
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.320]  students were like yeah man it's racist bring them in because you could tell them
[37:05.320 --> 37:11.000]  anything turn your guns in or your racist okay I'll turn my guns in open the
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.400]  borders up your racist support Obamacare well it has death panels was written by

[37:18.840 --> 37:22.840]  them on poor people and it's horrible and it's terrible and it's it's rationing
[37:22.840 --> 37:27.160]  here shut up racist see you don't have to be an intellectual you don't have to
[37:27.160 --> 37:29.680]  be smart
[37:31.800 --> 37:37.240]  all you've got to do is just act official and act like you're holy and
[37:37.240 --> 37:42.160]  you're good because you know how to say racist that's what this country has turned
[37:42.160 --> 37:46.200]  into that's what we've become that's what we've degenerated to let's go ahead
[37:46.200 --> 37:54.040]  and play this clip from Nova in 1990 one year after this happens in 1989 Ebola
[37:54.040 --> 37:59.920]  made its way to the US residents of this Washington DC suburb had no idea that
[37:59.920 --> 38:05.440]  one of the world's deadliest viruses had emerged in their midst
[38:09.200 --> 38:15.400]  in a primate quarantine unit in rest in Virginia monkeys in one of the holding
[38:15.400 --> 38:22.200]  rooms suddenly began to die secretly a military team entered the quarantine
[38:22.200 --> 38:27.720]  unit and killed all 60 monkeys in the infected room
[38:35.600 --> 38:42.040]  the crisis heightened as monkeys began to die in a different room it appeared
[38:42.040 --> 38:47.560]  that the virus was moving through the ventilating system in response the
[38:47.560 --> 38:54.720]  military killed all 400 monkeys ending the outbreak this new strain of Ebola
[38:54.720 --> 38:58.960]  had shown the potential to spread through the air had it been lethal in
[38:58.960 --> 39:06.480]  humans it could have been catastrophic but Stacy Keach narrating and that's
[39:06.480 --> 39:10.280]  why and by the way they are selling out as I predicted they would especially the
[39:10.280 --> 39:17.080]  fake blood splattered Ebola t-shirts that have now come in we'll show folks a
[39:17.080 --> 39:20.760]  document cam shot of that radio listeners couldn't go to m4store.com and
[39:20.760 --> 39:26.120]  where these proudly it's the word Ebola with the Obama symbol of the rising
[39:26.120 --> 39:31.800]  son of death and evil rising over the planet earth and it has fake blood
[39:31.800 --> 39:38.720]  splatters on it and on the back it says Ebola so on the back it says Ebola and
[39:38.720 --> 39:44.640]  on the front it says Ebola and that one is showing out very quickly the other
[39:44.640 --> 39:50.800]  one will sell out as well but not at the same rate and it's in the maiden 1776
[39:50.800 --> 39:56.680]  comm area made in America we have all the Molan lobby men and women's shirts and
[39:56.680 --> 40:02.360]  all of the belt buckles have sold out except the George Washington ones I
[40:02.360 --> 40:05.280]  would have thought I designed all these that the George Washington ones would be
[40:05.280 --> 40:09.400]  the most popular they haven't sold out in six months but the Molan lobby belt
[40:09.400 --> 40:18.920]  buckles have sold out so that's info wars store.com
[40:18.920 --> 40:25.880]  maiden 1776.com we did get in a few thousand bottles more of the silver

[40:33.040 --> 40:38.400]  it and it is about 80% sold out so I really shouldn't even plug it it'll
[40:38.400 --> 40:44.120]  probably sell out in the next hour or two info wars life.com a lot of other
[40:44.120 --> 40:46.880]  folks have doubled or tripled their prices of colloidal silver it's selling
[40:46.880 --> 40:52.240]  out everywhere we are holding the price we are holding the price though it's
[40:52.240 --> 40:57.760]  costing us more to manufacture now we have a large amount in transit it's being
[40:57.760 --> 41:03.000]  manufactured right now at a major US laboratory and it's should be here in
[41:03.000 --> 41:09.480]  two weeks but we have this in stock now info wars life silver bullet 30 parts
[41:09.480 --> 41:17.240]  per million colloidal silver and we have the survival shield supernation iodine
[41:17.240 --> 41:21.960]  from a deep earth crystal source the strongest purest form out there not from
[41:21.960 --> 41:27.240]  Pacific seaweed we have the original survival shield as well that's a lot
[41:27.240 --> 41:31.600]  weaker more palatable for children you will at least everybody I know will
[41:31.600 --> 41:35.200]  detox within two weeks on this and you will feel you will feel it and then
[41:35.200 --> 41:37.720]  after that it's like a fog clears for me and everybody else I know that's taking
[41:37.720 --> 41:41.640]  it it's it's I mean this is not a game there's a reason they keep lowering the
[41:41.640 --> 41:45.000]  allowance of iodine that's even the type that didn't even that good an iodine
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.920]  the reason they don't want you knowing about it literally but the elites are
[41:47.920 --> 41:54.520]  obsessed with it we had one of the biggest makers of women's well they
[41:54.520 --> 42:02.520]  also make everybody's products but one of the most famous product producers
[42:02.520 --> 42:07.840]  very well known contact where we get it from and then contact us wanting to
[42:07.840 --> 42:14.680]  buy us out but for haircare products our source and our contract for the source
[42:14.680 --> 42:20.320]  and then we said well no we don't want to do that and so they just kind of
[42:20.320 --> 42:23.560]  disappeared I'm sure they're trying to find another source of it but this is a
[42:23.560 --> 42:29.120]  big deal is what I'm getting at it's a big deal because nobody's gone out and
[42:29.120 --> 42:33.000]  done this and this is the type of stuff we're researching really revolutionary
[42:33.000 --> 42:39.720]  type products so survival shield nascent iodine x2 and original survival shield

[43:22.080 --> 43:24.640]  spot somebody was just telling me yesterday how amazing it's been for
[43:24.640 --> 43:27.240]  him who I think stopped around the board I can't see the wind of the lights are
[43:27.240 --> 43:30.320]  so bright do you want to talk about what it's done for you yeah absolutely this

[44:22.080 --> 44:25.320]  man that's weird I didn't know that group that had famous Hollywood stars you
[44:25.320 --> 44:29.120]  can look it up like six seven years ago talk about how how'd you get so skinny

[45:07.240 --> 45:10.080]  to medical doctors that have done autopsies on people and they say it's
[45:10.080 --> 45:14.280]  unbelievable I mean our guts are just clogged up from this unnatural diet and
[45:14.280 --> 45:18.920]  oxygen put it this way there's nothing like it and I'm gonna stop talking about

[45:56.600 --> 46:03.680]  up about 6 a.m. it's just that the elites all know about this kind of stuff
[46:03.680 --> 46:09.680]  it's so revolutionary all right I'm done talking about it M4slife.com now

[46:24.600 --> 46:27.680]  battling the Ebola outbreak that have killed more than 4,500 people in West
[46:27.680 --> 46:31.680]  Africa have managed a limited spread on the continent to five countries and two
[46:31.680 --> 46:35.680]  of them appear to have snuffed out the disease and it says the country's
[46:35.680 --> 46:39.720]  bordering the areas have completely closed their borders and not don't want
[46:39.720 --> 46:44.720]  flights in because that's common sense though countries run by African
[46:44.720 --> 46:51.840]  dictators do common sense type stuff and they did things in Sierra Leone and
[46:51.840 --> 46:56.320]  others that have now stopped the expansion of the spread in those
[46:56.320 --> 47:01.320]  countries they just said you know what nobody come out of your house for three
[47:01.320 --> 47:06.200]  days go get whatever you need today starting this weekend Saturday Sunday

[47:43.640 --> 47:51.240]  pouring across pouring across and just one of them could cause a chain reaction
[47:51.240 --> 47:56.400]  of Ebola and hey maybe you want your little kid to get it and bleed out a
[47:56.400 --> 48:02.040]  horrible death screaming and begging I know this I've had enough and I guarantee

[48:38.600 --> 48:42.040]  North American Union not allowing a domestic response but a North American
[48:42.040 --> 48:48.880]  Union response they said they would use plagues terrorism and drugs in the
[48:48.880 --> 48:52.640]  BAMP Canada documents from 2007 they're in my film in-game blueprint for
[48:52.640 --> 49:01.840]  global enslavement they use the crisis to bring in the control 800 259 92 31

[49:09.760 --> 49:17.280]  really gonna be in the hot zone in the jails at the hospitals having to
[49:17.280 --> 49:21.680]  respond to people that have got to be quarantined they're gonna you get the
[49:21.680 --> 49:27.600]  short end of the stick you get the shortest straw shortest straw shortest
[49:27.600 --> 49:33.680]  straw has been pulled for you and now Obama wants to send the National Guard
[49:33.680 --> 49:38.960]  totally untrained into Liberia most of their places to quote help contain it
[49:38.960 --> 49:43.320]  and I understand the military they have teams that are trained for this and then
[49:43.320 --> 49:47.120]  we've got inept bureaucracies at every other level but no you shield the
[49:47.120 --> 49:52.120]  borders you quarantine the people that have it like they've done and we stay
[49:52.120 --> 49:56.440]  out of it but see there's hundreds of billions of dollars to be made fighting
[49:56.440 --> 50:00.560]  this for select corporations that'll get the contracts for all the medicine and
[50:00.560 --> 50:03.720]  all the garbage because they're not giving him blood transfusions from Ebola
[50:03.720 --> 50:08.800]  survivors are taking that making a serum no they're giving them experimental
[50:08.800 --> 50:13.640]  drugs and vaccines so they can say oh it's safe and effective and then lie and
[50:13.640 --> 50:17.080]  roll it out here hey let me ask you that America are you gonna take the vaccine
[50:17.080 --> 50:25.200]  800 259 92 31 and we'll also talk about I want to hear from callers not just the
[50:25.200 --> 50:28.200]  Ebola and your take on that and where all this is going and how do we hold these
[50:28.200 --> 50:31.120]  criminals accountable and can make a big enough stink out of this to let the
[50:31.120 --> 50:34.120]  establishment know they're gonna end up getting in trouble so they might back off
[50:34.120 --> 50:38.880]  on letting this spread and why are they so arrogant I live they're gonna get

[54:21.800 --> 54:26.600]  Joe Biggs down at UT yesterday liberal sign petition to bring Ebola patients
[54:26.600 --> 54:30.800]  into the US and house them students show enthusiastic support for the Ebola
[54:30.800 --> 54:37.160]  Equality Act of 2014 yeah they say you're homophobic if you don't go out and
[54:37.160 --> 54:41.800]  try to catch HIV by the way I'm not joking in San Francisco New York for 20
[54:41.800 --> 54:47.000]  years they're called bug chasers gift givers gift receivers and I'm just
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.600]  waiting for the new trend to prove you're not racist because it is sexually
[54:51.600 --> 54:56.800]  transmitted it lives in the testicles for 70 days not just 21 like in the rest
[54:56.800 --> 55:02.440]  of the body so prove you're not racist I think Rachel Maddow and others should
[55:02.440 --> 55:09.160]  go to Africa and she should marry an Ebola victim and you know she should
[55:09.160 --> 55:13.320]  contract Ebola I mean to prove that we should leave the border open I mean
[55:13.320 --> 55:18.000]  come on you want my kids to get it Rachel and in a raldo Rivera I mean I'm
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.800]  bad that drudge is bad that we said we should control the flights and the
[55:21.800 --> 55:28.040]  border so come on her all though marry a woman who has Ebola right now prove
[55:28.040 --> 55:33.480]  you're not racist and prove you're not homophobic go out and you know being
[55:33.480 --> 55:40.440]  inject yourself with HIV I'm not joking come on you want me to have Ebola you
[55:40.440 --> 55:46.640]  want me to have AIDS you go get it not even kidding with you absurdist nuts
[55:46.640 --> 55:52.040]  come on her all though come back on the show and defend yourself or say you're
[55:52.040 --> 55:54.200]  wrong
[55:58.320 --> 56:02.280]  let's go to will in Ohio will thanks for calling in on this Friday edition I
[56:02.280 --> 56:06.800]  guess I'm a little extreme do you pledge to to find the nearest Ebola person
[56:06.800 --> 56:10.280]  and suck their blood
[56:10.280 --> 56:16.680]  yeah you got a little phone problem there talk about your phone okay how's
[56:16.680 --> 56:20.480]  that go ahead sir okay I was at the doctor's one and we had a little
[56:20.480 --> 56:24.320]  conversation about that Ebola business first of all you know there's only four
[56:24.320 --> 56:28.280]  hospitals in this country that can handle that level of infectious viruses
[56:28.280 --> 56:31.840]  well I think the answer is let people fly in by the hundreds of day from
[56:31.840 --> 56:35.200]  countries that have it and let Nigerians die on the plane vomiting
[56:35.200 --> 56:37.880]  everywhere yesterday and everything's fine I think that's the answer don't you
[56:37.880 --> 56:41.720]  but you know according to that nurse that we've got talking about that nurse
[56:41.720 --> 56:45.120]  you know supposedly touched her face with that contaminated glove you know
[56:45.120 --> 56:49.360]  and he and he said not what happened he said they didn't have any hazmat suits
[56:49.360 --> 56:54.000]  for him so they just put them in like a containment gown and they and they taped
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.200]  it to their deck with with surgical tape yes and when that stuff comes off it
[56:58.200 --> 57:02.480]  takes skin with it if you got the littlest pimple scratch cut you you're
[57:02.480 --> 57:07.280]  wide open brother why are you racist why I don't know I guess I just raised that
[57:07.280 --> 57:11.520]  away do you want to apologize to Rachel Maddow and Heralda Rivera and Al
[57:11.520 --> 57:16.040]  Sharpton and pledge that you will try to contract Ebola to prove you're not racist
[57:16.040 --> 57:20.120]  well first I want to see them go down there marry someone I give them the
[57:20.120 --> 57:23.840]  Hollywood Suite there in Vegas give it to them all expenses paid for a week then
[57:23.840 --> 57:27.200]  we'll talk about it well they're all for being able to marry however you want so
[57:27.200 --> 57:32.400]  how about the entire staff MSNBC and Heraldo get together and all marry one
[57:32.400 --> 57:38.360]  Ebola patient share it they could even shoot a video and sell tickets on
[57:38.360 --> 57:42.400]  pay-per-view well I want to see it on YouTube I can't afford no ticket I'm
[57:42.400 --> 57:47.080]  joking I'm not they'll probably actually come up with that but it said as far as
[57:47.080 --> 57:50.040]  containing it down there you said you ain't gonna contain it down there they
[57:50.040 --> 57:56.640]  reuse their needles and stuff down there well well sir you just need we need to
[57:56.640 --> 57:59.720]  bring the Ebola patients here to prove we're not racist that's what the UT
[57:59.720 --> 58:04.000]  students actually say and I agree with them of course you know that they'll be
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.040]  the first ones that if you actually brought someone with Ebola they would
[58:07.040 --> 58:13.440]  run screaming the other direction no Alex I think we got problems you think we
[58:13.440 --> 58:17.200]  got problems maybe a little bit I think we do well the mayor of Houston's not
[58:17.200 --> 58:20.760]  worried about that she wants to arrest and ensuing preachers that criticize
[58:20.760 --> 58:26.120]  homosexuality because she's a fascist dirtbag witch how's that sound
[58:26.120 --> 58:30.160]  tail in Sanford Florida where they have this room I preach against homosexuality
[58:30.160 --> 58:33.360]  for years they got me on tape well they'll be better arrest you buddy this
[58:33.360 --> 58:36.960]  ain't America and you keep your mouth shut races well they ride back second

[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:27.360]  Alex Jones well we're into our number two Bola spreading nicely across the
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:33.040]  United States the border still really wide open and they're issuing visas as
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:38.360]  fast as they can to anyone vomiting at US embassies to come here the AP
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:44.160]  reports Africa Stem Zabola via border closings that's how they stop it
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:50.000]  spreading to other countries but that's not how we do it here now we're taking
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.720]  your phone calls we'll go to the latest breaking news in the next segment but
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.720]  let's go to faith in California faith you're on the air thanks for holding
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:06.760]  hey I just I had a new idea for a new t-shirt I have a new idea that that
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.680]  buddy Holly didn't really die on that plane crash that Waylon Jennings you know
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.520]  got off the plane so he was checker whatever actually he got a facelift
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.200]  and is now Rachel Maddow I'm sorry go ahead
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:26.000]  I was thinking we should do a takeoff and have it say Ebola care with blood
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.320]  spatters a big pill that says Ebola that's a great idea I think I think I've
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.200]  actually seen some posters like that it shows like Obama in a mask and it says
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:41.200]  Ebola care or obola care that's a fabulous idea yeah yeah maybe an airplane
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:47.640]  you know going across you know the on the back of the t-shirt or something
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:51.640]  what you know this is you know Ebola care let me ask you a question did you
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:57.080]  hear that audio or see the video we played earlier of UT students 17 out of
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.800]  30 wanting to bring people the Bola to the US and wanting to bring them to
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:07.560]  their homes yeah I did yeah yeah I think they should take them to I think we
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:14.040]  should hold them to it that's a documented signature well you know
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.200]  they're not actually gonna do that they all just want free handouts and stuff
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.520]  and they've shown in statistics fake environmentalists are six times more
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:27.400]  likely in a Canada Canadian University study to steal and lie she's all about
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.120]  how they're good it's like people that spread stuff on Facebook and Twitter
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:35.200]  about give to a cause they're something like 10 times more likely not to
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:40.400]  actually give you understand and liberals on average are many times more
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.720]  likely not to give than conservatives and I mean real conservatives not
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:48.360]  fake ones but that's okay because you know they want us all to die they just
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.720]  think it won't affect them maybe when some of them die from Ebola it won't be
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:57.960]  so funny anymore huh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah I think they've got a real problem
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:02.680]  on their hands but I don't think they really know what they're doing no I
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.160]  don't think they know what they're doing either great to hear from you ma'am
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.960]  another extremist calling in her older over will probably call her racist
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.600]  Haley in Washington because she doesn't want to Bola doesn't want to die a
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.040]  horrible death of vomit and blood spewing everywhere
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:19.960]  total racism I don't want my kids to get it and die I'm racist I'm just telling
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.000]  me here in Texas with the Ebola spreading I'm just a bad person Haley in
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.200]  Washington you're on the air with a racist go ahead hi Alex this is Haley
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:34.200]  thanks for taking my call I want to hear your thoughts on the new Bola czar
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.520]  that was nominated last night and yeah I see that well Obama will save us now
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.800]  with a new czar after letting it spread and turning off the default procedures
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:45.960]  don't not let it spread he's now gonna have a big Ebola czar to save us and I
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:49.280]  just think it's a total gimmick and disgusting and shows how staged all this
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:54.600]  is well the way I see it is this you know if you do a hire a secretary and
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:58.440]  she's not doing her job you don't hire another secretary keep the other
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:02.480]  secretary on and then keep paying her and then hire a new one sure sure but
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:07.720]  don't worry about that because this new Ebola czar has no health care
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:12.720]  management no health care background so Obama is now batting a thousand when it
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.320]  comes to doing the worst thing he could so isn't that great he hard somebody to
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.200]  run this that literally knows nothing about it that makes sense well yeah I
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:25.360]  looked him up and that he's just another Harvard Law review guy and with the one
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.800]  that signed off on the support for the loan for Selindra which is now a do
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:35.120]  folks corporation and his wife is an environmental activist and special
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:38.200]  assistant to the second yeah they want to reduce world population yeah it works
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:43.720]  for Holdren or John P. Holdren mr. mr. kill everybody and of course he he
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:51.360]  also worked for Al Gore so you're absolutely right anything else I'd like
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:54.520]  to hear your thoughts maybe on just the Bill and Melinda Gates and their
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.360]  involvement have been doing a lot of research on them stay there I'm gonna

[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.640]  death education you mean I go and I put a shoelace around my neck when I'm sad

[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:56.360]  wars.com and prisonplanet.com and even the Wall Street Journal has come
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.520]  out and said the administration is incredibly arrogant with its Ebola
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:07.520]  evasions and reveals its disdain for the American people we're gonna keep the
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.920]  border open we're gonna let the people fly in even though the AP reports Africa
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.920]  stems Ebola via border closings there's countries that right by countries that
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:21.800]  have hundreds of thousands of Ebola cases as it spreads and they have no
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:27.840]  cases because they've locked the border down but we can't do that here and we're
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:34.120]  one of the only countries let's the Ebola people fly over here it is just
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:40.160]  unbelievable and liberals so-called liberals at UT 17 of 30 people we
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.000]  talked to basically all the students older folks that were clearly
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.600]  professors or adjuncts or instructors said no way but the the trend he's all
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:53.320]  it I bring it here it's racist not to I want to have them in my house of course
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.480]  there's no way they'd actually do it they're all about the fantasy that
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.720]  they're trending the fact it's gonna raise us
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:07.800]  they just want to say raise us you're a white male that's inherently raises look
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:13.200]  that statue of a victory over Japan with a sailor kissing the nurse she's in his
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.400]  arms collapsing in his arms it's it's rape no that's what a woman does when
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:26.840]  they want you to take them is they fall into your arms you mind control feminist
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.320]  of course they know that they know that they've had plenty of women fall into
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:37.480]  their arms they just don't they just want women and men fighting with each other
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:42.480]  it's mind control screwing with our heads and again I go back to this the
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:50.760]  mayor the lesbian mayor of Houston is is in is trying to indict so she's suing
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:55.280]  and subpoenaing a bunch of preachers that criticize homosexuality or or or
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.680]  criticize a same-sex bathrooms again they just want to make us all go to the
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:05.160]  same bathrooms and mess with our heads it's not about a quality it's about
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:11.680]  dominating us and quite frankly I don't get into the whole lesbian gay thing I
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.880]  don't that's I'm not here the average person out there that's you know gay or
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:19.840]  whatever is a nice person I don't hate him at whatever the thing is is that the
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:22.720]  political people are a bunch of anti-gun
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:26.760]  kleptocratic fascists that call themselves leftists that want to arrest
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:36.040]  preachers in America in Houston for their sermons it's called the first
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:41.520]  amendment I don't like the Klan speech like I said yesterday but you know what
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.600]  I'll defend it to the end I don't like match on La Raza the Hispanic
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:49.080]  Ku Klux Klan speech but you know what I'll defend it to the end because if they
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:55.000]  lose their rights I lose mine got it comprende you got that grand cyclops
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.960]  to the Klan people out there grand dragons whatever the names are at this
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:05.880]  week on time some Klan guy was in my face in a rally goes here's my card and
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:10.840]  it said like Cyclopsian ruler imagine like it's like a comic book like a kid
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:15.440]  dressing up and saying I am destruct or from the planet X or whatever I am
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:23.440]  supreme Cyclops Cyclopsian ruler see I have a right to laugh at you in Europe
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:27.640]  they're now arresting people if they say oh Muslims feel like you made fun of
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:32.280]  them or you drew a picture of Muhammad we don't like we're gonna arrest you no
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:39.360]  no no no no no no renaissance you want to draw a picture of Muhammad that's
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:44.600]  you're right even if it's offensive to people even if I don't agree with it you
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.640]  want to draw a picture of a Jesus it's offensive that's your issue but don't
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:53.600]  use government taxpayer money to pay for a crucifix in a glass of urine don't
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:58.560]  pay $300,000 for that people say oh why are you for censorship in the arts no
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.720]  I'm not don't it's like the Texas Art Commission three four years ago machete
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:10.040]  came out I was given the script by Hispanic gentleman high up in the
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:13.440]  production that said this is total race war garbage is being funded by the
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:18.920]  White House that's now come out they you know he's gonna watch a TV network all
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:22.480]  about race baiting and he did that I told you everything and Robert Rodriguez
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.400]  came out and said no Alex Jones doesn't have the script he's a liar now this is
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.640]  in the movie well they cut a bunch out of movie but everything that they did
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:33.800]  put in there was the script word for word and I pointed out what is it getting
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.440]  tax exemption for when a pro-gun film was denied and a film about Waco was
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:42.680]  denied tax exemption I said give all films tax exemption don't have a
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:47.880]  political board over it give machete a tax exemption but you give libertarian
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:58.080]  and conservative films that as well and Rodriguez went into a conniption fit and
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:02.240]  I'm not gonna get it all the stuff behind the scenes and then it defunded
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:08.240]  they defunded the entire program pretty much over it but that was something
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:11.800]  Rick Perry already wanted to do so I got blamed for it in the film community in
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:18.640]  Texas that I Alex Jones killed film incentives no I didn't they killed it
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.320]  by making it discriminatory you got that because if they can start making
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:27.440]  leftist and race war films and la reconquista films tax exempt but a pro
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:33.120]  gun film isn't a major film will come to the state or a film about Waco and so
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.240]  they make it in in in in Baton Rouge and they get the business that's
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.340]  discriminatory just like in the lives of others it's based on true story the
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:44.560]  communists in eastern Germany were over all the films all the books all the
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.440]  theater all the starlets had to have sex with the guys on the on the film
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:52.760]  board I don't want to live in a country like that where you guys control
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:56.280]  everything with tax exemption for your people just like they've got the IRS
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:01.400]  killing after pro-life conservatives libertarians there is a fascist war on
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:07.040]  anything but socialist communist kleptocrats social engineering fascist
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:12.600]  speech now I've gone off on a jag I said we're taking your phone calls this lady
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.200]  called in and I got going on other subjects we're gonna go back to Haley
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:20.760]  in Washington than Shane Austin Aaron Ray and others but here's the article
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:26.920]  she was mentioning CBS News Obama's new Ebola czar does not have medical
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.880]  health care background no but he worked for eugenicist Al Gore and Bella
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:35.200]  Melinda Gates and his wife worked in all of it in population control measures so
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:40.320]  of course we've got a John P. Holder and Acolyte running things and see that's
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:44.320]  the it's all about throwing it in our face they'll have lots of made for TV
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:47.760]  movies are announcing about how Obama's a hero because it's all about these
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.440]  narcissists being heroes even when they're not did everything they could to
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:54.560]  spread the Ebola as the borders are wide open she was bringing up the below
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:57.880]  Melinda Gates Foundation and what they're and how they're involved with the
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:02.200]  the vaccine in Monsanto and that's a big question for listeners are you going to
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:05.560]  take the Ebola vaccine even though it won't protect you probably gonna spread
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:09.840]  it that's gonna be rolling out December January so Haley go ahead and make your
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:13.880]  point about below Melinda Gates you wanted to get into oh great thanks Alex
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.800]  yeah I I wanted to see what your thoughts were about it kind of using the
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:23.960]  World Health Health Organization as kind of a measuring stick to you know see
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:27.920]  what's going on with Ebola and and I was just researching that and you know most
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.040]  people don't realize that I'm sure you do but don't realize that the World
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:36.680]  Health Organization is funded primarily by the Gates and you know they they
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:41.240]  pretty much just use their money so that you know they can kick out globalist
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.200]  decision-making for well-people anthropists yeah they've taken over
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.600]  basically the Rockefeller Foundation and Carnegie Endowment as the tip of the
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:52.560]  spear they're the main funders of gun control they're the main funders of
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:56.360]  open borders they're the main funders of forced inoculation they're the main
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:01.760]  funders of vaccines engineered into the food of forcing kids to eat GMO they're
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:05.400]  the ones that wrote the curriculum for what the kids eat under Michelle Obama
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:11.040]  they run our lives they're the ones taken over the public schools just every
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.960]  time you get to the bottom of the rabbit hole there is his army intelligence
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:19.920]  dad who ran Planned Parenthood and was on the secret boards that's come out of
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:24.600]  the eugenics groups and so Bill Gates was set up given the IBM contracts as a
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:31.600]  front IBM his entire trust when Thomas Watson died was to carry out eugenics
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:36.400]  and the dream of Adolf Alois Hitler and that's all public best-selling books
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:40.480]  have been written on it IBM in the Holocaust and they run everything and
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:43.720]  that's just the way it is so roll your sleeves up take your shots how's that
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:48.800]  sound well I just want to make one more point particularly for people that live
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:54.280]  in Washington State and my my sister's fiance works at Harborview Medical and
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:58.760]  that's the largest hospital in Washington State and she just informed me
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:02.960]  that most people aren't supposed to know this but they had military officials
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:07.520]  coming in this last week preparing for quarantine for Ebola of course and you
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.680]  know so if you don't think that it's coming you know coming here that it's
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:15.600]  just on the border states or you know in Nebraska or or Dallas it's not and
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:21.920]  let's be clear let's be clear a month after England and others stopped
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:24.960]  flights out of Western Africa they let somebody in who had it and it's now
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:31.200]  spreading they did it period they let it spread what do you say to that oh I'm
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:35.520]  not surprised I think we should just give them all Costco cards I think we
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:39.760]  should like like people at UT said give them all free tickets the UT game let
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:43.760]  me go Vamo everybody's kids and just we should all just like put they should

[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:33.680]  Obama defending his stance on not instituting a travel ban they keep
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:39.440]  saying it lets medical workers go and help they're on military CDC and UN
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:46.440]  flights that's just not true they're issuing visas to people folks are coming
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:50.880]  in the main hub is Nigeria they come in out of other Ebola affected countries
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:56.480]  they get on and start projectile vomiting everywhere they clearly wanted to
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:03.000]  spread folks if they didn't engineer it and soup it up as it appears to be last
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.480]  longer in the body can spread further has a higher kill rate then they bear
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:12.640]  minimum let it come in look you didn't think the socialist and the globalist
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:16.960]  we're gonna just get control of the country and not fully wreck it you you
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:20.560]  just think Obama's gonna leave office without totally wrecking the country
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:26.120]  first and they think the controlled media will protect them to the point
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:29.480]  you've heard the big White House reporters when the mics they think are
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:33.640]  off going man we're screwed this is really bad it's spreading but when they
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:36.360]  ask the questions oh gracious leader that you were saving us you're so
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:40.160]  perfect because if you don't ask questions like that you don't get let
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:45.520]  me in do we all have a suicide pact with these crazy people run in the
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:48.680]  government and I'm gonna explain something it's a bunch of corporate
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:53.080]  special interest that will make trillions off a full bore worldwide Ebola
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:57.480]  pandemic that they will medicalize that they'll create the vaccines for that
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:02.160]  they'll get the countries into debt they create wars they fund al-qaeda they
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:06.640]  they they promote diseases because they get power out of the global crisis
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:11.760]  management system they've built that's why they don't want locals to ever be
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:16.120]  prepared to do anything that's why they block locals in Katrina and block local
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.640]  police and others because they want to come in screw everything up and then
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:24.480]  get even more funding so they can quote do a better job next time problem
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:30.360]  reaction solution here is Obama defending his stance on not instituting a
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:35.040]  travel ban here it is I don't have a philosophical objection necessarily to a
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:40.280]  travel ban if that is the thing that is gonna keep the American people safe the
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:45.840]  problem is is that in all the discussions I've had thus far with experts in
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:52.240]  the field experts in infectious disease oh really is that a travel ban is less
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:57.000]  effective than the measures that we are currently instituting if we institute a
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:03.040]  travel ban instead of the protocols that we put in place now history shows
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:10.760]  that there is a likelihood of increased avoidance people do not readily
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:14.760]  disclose their information they may engage in something called broken trap
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:19.000]  essentially breaking up their trip so that they can hide the fact that they
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.560]  have been to one of these they're already doing that there's a disease in place and
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:30.480]  as a result we may end up getting less information about who has the disease
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:34.680]  they're less likely to get treated properly screen properly quarantine
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:39.960]  properly and as a consequence we could end up having more cases rather than less
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:48.160]  okay that's from NBC News how did we get the current Ebola outbreak hmm let me
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:52.440]  think back because Lyra chief you know he just told me that he's trying to keep
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:59.000]  me safe and trying to keep you safe they told us that there wasn't any threat of
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:07.480]  it coming here and then a man from Liberia who knew he had it flew here and
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:11.720]  ran around for weeks vomiting on everyone but that's okay because Jesse
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:18.840]  Jackson said it we were racist why not we're bad we deserve it and then they
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:22.960]  didn't quarantine his family and let his kid go to school and then two nurses
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:26.360]  got it which they said were impossible you had to be vomited on into an open
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:31.160]  wound and now the nurses was flying around everywhere and now you've got
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:35.480]  people flying out of Africa vomiting and dying on the plane and dead people
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:39.440]  being found in Houston from that just came in from West Africa everything's
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:43.640]  fine though I think they're trying to get Ebola I think it's really clear now
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:46.800]  it really just clicked they don't want it to just get started spreading they
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:53.240]  wanted to spread real bad before we know so folks don't start self-quarantining
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:58.120]  and making the right procedures because they know the states will take
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:01.720]  matters in their own hands and stop it they wanted to get so bad it's
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:06.680]  unstoppable that's it total commitment to spread Ebola as bad as possible and
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:10.640]  to just be handing out the visas like hotcakes to anybody that wants to come
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:14.400]  here you know oh you're bleeding and vomiting get on the plane you want to
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:18.720]  vomit on everybody on the plane vomiting so bad the person died flying into
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:27.160]  New York oh my gosh this is I've flown a JFK so many times they they rob your
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:32.280]  bags there I've had the airport screening people rob me twice very nice
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:36.840]  people in a troubling report that has surfaced amidst growing fears of an
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:42.400]  Ebola outbreak in the US a man has died following a vomiting fit because you die
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:48.120]  usually I never heard of that before in route to New York City on a commercial
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:54.240]  flight originating from Nigeria the CDC is yet to go on record confirming or
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:59.240]  denying whether or not the man may have been infected with Ebola the New York
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:03.240]  Post reports a plane from Nigeria landed at JFK Airport last night with a male
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:08.600]  passenger aboard who died during the flight after a vomit fit oh well whatever
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:14.000]  he's got it's we've shared me to spread it or your racist and CDC officials
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.640]  conducted a cursory exam before announcing there was no Ebola a cursory
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:23.560]  it's an exam and turning the corpse over to the Port Authority cops to remove
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:27.400]  yeah how'd you like that job of course that's the same airport for two weeks
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:30.440]  they're refusing to clean the planes because they say there's so much vomit
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:36.160]  and blood on them oh it's here that they're bringing all of men but they
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:38.600]  always said it would be the Muslim extremists would go get infected and
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:42.840]  come in they don't need to our government will take someone with Ebola and
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:46.200]  bring them in to treat them or they'll take somebody who has it and take them
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:49.400]  and put them in a regular hospital
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:54.200]  and all the major independent experts are saying send them a special government
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:57.880]  facilities that are already there quarantine them that was default look
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:03.560]  it's a default folks so I want to hurry through your calls now I've talked
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:07.080]  enough and I've gone too long I want to take a bunch of them now Austin Aaron
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:13.720]  Ray racist that means they didn't want Ebola Shane just have your question your
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:18.480]  comment ready right now Austin in Michigan you're on the year go ahead
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:24.240]  sir hey how's it going Alex well I mean I'm kind of ashamed of myself I don't
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:28.720]  want Ebola to kill me and my family so I'm racist and I'm kind of upset that
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:35.040]  Rachel Maddow and and CBS News and the White House and all these other
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.000]  organizations media matters that they control that's when I say the White
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.720]  House you know have said that I and others are bad that really shakes me up
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:45.360]  to be but that they are my authority they are my God because they're known
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:49.280]  liars and I'm really shook up right now that that that you know socially they've
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:53.240]  said this about me I'm gonna I'm gonna run out right now and bring an Ebola
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:57.640]  patient back to my house just to prove to her Aldo Rivera that I'm not racist go
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:03.200]  ahead well talk about I don't know if you've ever heard of you ever read the
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:09.360]  book the cure for all diseases I know I haven't read that um it's a book by an
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:15.960]  independent research scientist our name is uh it's held over a gear Clark okay
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:18.680]  well tell me what they're claiming because I don't think there's a quote
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:23.080]  cure a hundred percent of the time for anything well well it has to do with
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:28.040]  you ever you ever hear of bioregiation oh they're claiming they have like a
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:33.760]  Raymond Rife machine or something no everything here in it's a frequency you
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:37.680]  know the life frequency in no I know and that's that's that's right machines
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:41.960]  there is some real evidence that there are different frequency treatments and
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:45.120]  we know bad frequencies out of cell phones are given as cancer but then
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:47.320]  there's so many quacks I don't know the book you're talking about someone's
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:51.080]  saying they're a quack there are so many quacks out there selling BS machines I
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:55.640]  mean I've been offered let's not exaggerate machines are like $10,000
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:00.560]  they cost about $1,000 to make I've been offered $5,000 per machine to sell
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:04.360]  them and I won't because I've gone and looked into what they are and it's not
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:10.320]  real but I think the claim that you know frequencies can heal everything isn't
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:14.000]  true I appreciate your call but if you know you can fire radiation through a
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.920]  tumor and kill it it just might kill everything else around it so that so the
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:23.000]  answer is are there other good forms of frequencies that that can resonate at a
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.920]  certain level to kill viruses and things well yes sunlight kills viruses but how
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:33.080]  do you get sunlight into every area of the body so of course frequencies can
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:38.160]  do things but it should be studied mainline and deployed the Queen of
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:41.720]  England it comes out gets frequency treatments but she goes to real
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:45.280]  government facilities very secretive stuff Queen mother lived to a hundred
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:48.560]  and something she would get it they take her blood out and put it through ozone
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:56.300]  machines and stuff Prince Philip gets it so yes I'm saying it's like alternative
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:59.520]  energy there's a lot of real alternative energy but most of stuff out
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:05.120]  there is a scam so I don't promote it because it's such a minefield so that's
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:09.200]  Royal Raymond Rife stuff you're talking about sir let's talk to Aaron and his
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:12.920]  research was real overall it got a little bit far out there towards the end
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:18.680]  Aaron in Ohio you're on the air hey Alex thanks for taking my call thank you
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:23.880]  brother I think I know what's going on with this and I think it's a false flag
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:29.600]  we know that however I think what they're trying to do is is the linchpin of
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:34.240]  this whole new order takeover is they have to have us convinced to take these
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:38.200]  vaccines so I think oh yeah that's it that's it bringing medical tyranny
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:41.840]  forced inoculations grandstanding and they've got to get it going enough to
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:45.600]  scare the daylights out of people and they're saying take your flu shot we
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:48.680]  won't quarantine you what does that mean well if you're sick we'll quarantine
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:52.120]  you see the threat we'll lock you up with a bowl of patients if you don't do
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:56.720]  this it's pure terrorism we're being terrorized go ahead see they have to
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:00.560]  you if they have to though because we're getting to the point now we're 40% of
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:05.360]  the populace now is get is around roughly that number is not vaccinating
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:09.080]  their children anymore the walls of that tyranny is starting to fall down we
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:14.280]  have whistleblowers we have lawsuits against Bill Gates in India and things
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:17.840]  like that over over his polio stuff giving people polio by the hundreds of
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:21.920]  thousands you're right and so what's happening is just like rededare would
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:26.080]  blow up an oil well fire with a with a bigger explosion they need a big giant
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:30.360]  explosion I mean the globalist would launch a nuclear war before they were
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:33.640]  ever removed from power that's why you've got to culturally identify them and
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:38.520]  reject them and just literally shun them that's the way to defeat them not
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:43.000]  militarily not in some coup or something or counter coup we've got to
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.960]  overthrow their system intellectually by recognizing it that's why they want to
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:52.160]  dumb us down and you're absolutely correct that it's all about well that's
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:56.160]  why they had NBC News attacked Kurt Nemo last week Kurt was pointing out in an
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:59.560]  article that they are preparing a vaccine by the end of the year and they're
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:02.640]  going to try to roll it out and that's on record so they came out and said oh
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:06.760]  Kurt claims with no evidence and M4 claims that it's about a vaccine when
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:11.840]  there is no vaccine well his article shed in December and January when it
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:16.920]  comes out when the stuff starts peaking so they play these games go ahead there
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:20.480]  is there's a story going around and I don't know how legitimate it is but it's
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:25.360]  been going around you know Facebook and things like that about a nurse from one
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:29.160]  of those countries over there who was saying that it was a warning to
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:34.800]  Americans that there really is no Ebola virus the Ebola virus is actually in the
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:38.440]  vaccines that the Red Cross has been giving to the people in Africa for 40
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:42.920]  years now now that was actually in the biggest paper in Liberia with top
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:48.120]  virologist saying and who were working on getting on and I with all the secret
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:50.840]  testing in Africa killing people before why wouldn't it if they've done it
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:54.760]  before they've put steroids in vaccines if they've been caught doing this of
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:59.440]  course and Bill and Melinda Gates are involved in that as well and that's what
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:08.160]  the CIA agent steel said former CIA agent officer case officer said two
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:11.920]  weeks before all this happened he said there's going to be a false flag let's
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:15.360]  queue up that one minute clip if you can there's going to be a false flag using
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:23.480]  an Ebola biological simulant hitting America and so absolutely if the
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:28.400]  government's been caught in thousands of declassified tests many of which were
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:35.160]  lethal against black kids white kids poor people native Americans military people
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:42.000]  the GIs wives why would we ever trust this group now why would we take or do
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.800]  anything they said that's what I'm saying if we had a government with a
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:48.000]  history of good vaccines that could be trusted or they said hey there's a risk
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.680]  but here it is and we think it's a cost-benefit analysis I'd be like yeah
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:56.320]  Ebola vaccine but no they're bringing it in there they're letting it spread you
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:00.800]  can't trust them Gardasil shots kill a bunch of people that took it the HPV
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:04.800]  shot they still get it it's banned in India and Japan
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:11.080]  oh let's go to that clip with mr. steel we'll have another false flag in fact
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:15.800]  that the false flag I'm hearing about is a simulated Ebola attack in which they
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:20.680]  actually use biochemical weapons that dissipate but then they pretended it's
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:26.300]  Ebola and that it has been brought here by Saudi martyrs okay so no we have not
[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:31.520]  reached the end of the false flag line however what we have reached is I did my
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:34.600]  first graduate thesis on predicting revolution and there's a difference
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:39.640]  between preconditions of revolution and precipitants and I have posted a graphic
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:43.400]  on preconditions of revolution that exists in the USA today now a
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:48.040]  precipitant is like the Tunisian fruit seller my preferred precipitant is a
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:52.240]  soccer mom that tortures herself on the steps of Capitol Hill and it appears on
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:57.160]  YouTube but the bottom line is the next false flag could lead to a general
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:05.920]  strike across this country Robert David steel not an armchair CIA asset agent
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:11.400]  operative but some of the ran operations in hot zones in combat zones and that's
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:16.920]  he comes highly recommended from the US Army now that was two weeks for all this
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:21.920]  started we're gonna go to break come back and go to Aaron Ray racist Shane
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:28.440]  and others fact Shane's up first when we come back toll free number to join us
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:35.840]  is 800 259 92 31 before I go any further though let me just go ahead and take my
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:41.760]  daily dose right now of silver bullets still available now for a limited time
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:50.240]  it is selling out colloidal silver and info wars life.com and again I normally
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:55.720]  only take this once I'm already not feeling well super male vitality always
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:58.960]  good to boost natural function because they give us all the estrogen
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:05.040]  mimicers try to block our vitality fluoride shield this is real thick and

[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:30.680]  know how how long is this gonna go on for people realize that there's power in
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:35.440]  numbers and everybody just needs to opt out now and I think that would definitely
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:40.720]  put a hurt on them and by opt out what just stop showing up to work and stuff
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:45.560]  and maybe they'll seal the border exactly I mean not only work just just stop
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:50.440]  going stop anything any supporting no that's it I totally agree we need to
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:54.000]  have Watson right the article right now use historical examples they had
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.280]  strikes a few months ago in countries bordering Sierra Leone and others they
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:02.280]  wanted their border shut we should call for a national strike we don't have time
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:08.160]  to wait a national strike starting next Monday running through Wednesday of an
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:13.440]  all non-essential people obviously media and police and firefighters and things
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:18.440]  covering things after still go in but all non-essential people should go on
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:23.520]  strike Monday through next Wednesday and then called Congress and go on
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:27.640]  Facebook and Twitter and everywhere when you're on strike and talk about why
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:34.720]  you're on strike let's do it right now info wars.com calls for a strike in the
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:39.480]  United States running Monday through next Wednesday until they stop the
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:45.800]  flights and until they start I mean look I was just watching the news earlier
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:49.240]  Fox News during a break and they were admitting that police departments all
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:52.120]  over the country are just filled with the legals that have committed all sorts of
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:57.000]  heinous crimes and the feds won't come get them so the headline was police
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:03.600]  departments to stop holding criminal immigrants and undocumented criminals
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:09.040]  for rape murder they are now above the law it is now happening feds won't get
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:15.320]  them locals won't hold them this is the takedown of the country sir go ahead
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:20.480]  oh that was pretty much my my only point I just don't realize how people don't
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:24.880]  see what's going on it's gonna be too late before people realize it and I mean
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:28.640]  I think that's the only chance everybody gets together in numbers and then
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:31.720]  show them that that's it that's it we're gonna put out a White House petition
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:35.560]  right now get get Kurt to do that just a basic statement of they've been
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:39.200]  derelict in their duty like all their countries blocking their borders AP
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:43.520]  admits that other African countries block their borders and stop flights and
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:47.800]  it stopped it in its tracks that that our administration is aiding and abetting
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:52.840]  Ebola to create a crisis and a political distraction and then we're
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:57.520]  calling on all Americans to strike on Monday Tuesday Wednesday especially
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:00.840]  school teachers medical workers you name it because you're the ones that are
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:04.120]  gonna get hit hardest by this and it's gonna collapse the medical system and
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:07.680]  the school system and then the police departments and the oh my god it's the
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:13.880]  EMS it is just gonna be nightmarish and now we've got to have a strike now to
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:17.920]  bring attention to this to point out what's going on because the feds are on
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:23.840]  strike leaving us wide open that is a great idea in fact that's what steel
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:28.200]  said about a month ago he said a national strike for the next false flag
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:31.800]  he believes will be Ebola and now we're living it right now that's it we need to
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:36.400]  call for a national strike everyone should join us right now call for a
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:39.640]  national strike next week

[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:23.960]  alex jones
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:38.120]  we're launching this national strike because the borders been left wide open
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:41.720]  the default of stopping the flights the other nations have done has been
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:46.920]  ignored the AP reports that african countries bordering the the Ebola
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:52.360]  stricken nations have been able to stop the spread of Ebola and stopped it
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:56.160]  coming in cold in its tracks because they did this the default under federal law
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:01:02.640]  and the CDC policy is to stop the flights months ago they're allowing it to
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:06.360]  spread they're taking people to hospitals that aren't level 4 bio
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:14.160]  containment violating policy again and law and so only a national strike will
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:23.760]  bring the attention we need to force the hand of the establishment to force the
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:27.640]  hand so that they know they're going to get the blame for it spreading as it
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:30.880]  begins to spread so the hopefully they shut down the flights and start
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:35.480]  quarantining the people properly before it gets out of control and a national
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:39.600]  strike is the way to do it plus in other african countries they had basically
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:45.080]  government spot imposed strikes telling people for three days to stay indoors to
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:50.520]  stop the spread and it did stop the spread massively so it's also good
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:54.440]  practice to get ready if this gets out of control it's also a practice self
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:58.040]  quarantine and then with the telephone and the internet we can contact
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:06.360]  Congress contact the White House contact media with news of the strike and if by
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:09.960]  Wednesday night Obama had to stop the flights and shut down the southern border
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:15.720]  which they can do when you've got the head of Southcom saying there are people
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:18.440]  with Ebola clearly that are going to go to South America and they will pour
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:21.840]  across and it'll be the biggest crisis ever they've got a bolster that border
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:27.280]  now instead he's got it on stand down so Paul just ran in and said what's in the
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:32.720]  article by Paul Watson Alex Jones that's it that's the article so we need to give
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:36.880]  him the audio this right now snip it give it to him that's the article and we
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:39.960]  need to show the general saying it we need to show the expert saying this
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:43.040]  should have been done to stop the spread the other countries that did it and just
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:47.680]  make the claim show the fact and show the common sense and then instead of just
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:51.200]  bitching and complaining like I've been doing it Obama and people we need to call
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:56.200]  for a national strike Monday Tuesday and Wednesday and if the feds are still
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:02.680]  derelict in their duty if the feds are still purely involved in criminal
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:07.400]  neglect keyword and I've had medical doctors on agreeing that's what it is
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:11.680]  if they're still involved in criminal neglect allowing this to spread well
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:15.440]  then it's all on record what they've done and we go into day four and five all
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:20.960]  next week a national strike if they haven't responded by Wednesday now if
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:23.600]  this starts getting traction and there's already a lot of people out there
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:29.200]  upset and angry as well it's not just us he'll say okay I have a board or a group
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:33.640]  looking at the flights so he'll shut the flights down once it's spreading
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:37.640]  uncontrollably but they're not sure yet so that's why the president the
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:42.800]  proviso today when he spoke said well I'm not intellectually you know you know
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:49.400]  I'm not as a liberal an open board or border adherent against doing this well
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:51.720]  of course that's why he's against it because they can't ever have the idea
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:55.280]  that closing a border or controlling your sovereignty or airspace or stopping a
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:58.680]  disease might be a good idea you never try to find out why everybody's getting

[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:14.560]  two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and
[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:19.000]  most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:23.240]  their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the United States well
[02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:27.120]  over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and
[02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:30.320]  don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're

[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:20.360]  front line report if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:26.400]  well the White House is chapter Ebola czar and a White House press conference
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:30.640]  that just happened in the last hour we have the video at an article going up on
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:38.800]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com as we ride this Ebola storm that's been
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:43.640]  born into the world thrown into the United States as our borders are left
[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:47.960]  wide open as the aircraft are allowed to pour in with people that have it
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:55.800]  obviously as we witness the premeditated takedown of this country and forced
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:09:02.960]  inoculation you can just see the script CBS News reported hours ago that they
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:09.280]  admit that the new Ebola czar has no experience anything medical period and
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:15.760]  now the White House press secretary throwing it in your face says they're
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:21.040]  not looking for an Ebola expert exactly you don't want an Ebola expert to deal
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:25.320]  with a bowl outbreak kind of like if you're trying to hire a new NFL coach
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:31.560]  say for the Seattle Seahawks or the New England Patriots you don't even want to
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:38.200]  hire somebody that has sports history you want to hire maybe an Eskimo who's
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:45.600]  never even played a sport or maybe a little old lady from Japan who paints
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:52.440]  teacups make sense if you want to have an armorer to work on your guns don't
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:56.400]  hire someone who's ever shot a gun or has any metallurgy training or any firearms
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:07.840]  training hire a Tibetan monk who's never seen a firearm ever use one and
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:12.320]  again it's all about being perfectly absurd perfectly evil perfectly over
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:17.520]  the top let's go ahead and go to this bombshell clip the full video is on
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:21.360]  info wars.com it is live now kid Daniel's just got it up very quickly good
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:27.120]  job kid with an article he wrote in like 20 minutes so here is the clip what
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:34.840]  does Ron Klain know about Ebola well the thing that's let's talk about let me
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:40.120]  restate why this person why the president believes it was important to
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:44.400]  add this person to his team the president again wanted somebody who could
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:48.920]  serve in a coordinating function to manage the implementation of our whole
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:58.080]  of government approach to this Ebola situation and so I guess to more directly
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:02.400]  address your question what we were looking for is not an Ebola expert but
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:07.200]  rather an implementation expert and that's exactly what Ron Klain is he is
[02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:11.160]  somebody who has extensive experience in the federal government somebody that
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:15.440]  has extensive management experience oh yeah when it comes to the private sector
[02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:18.880]  oh yes you'll recall that when he served here at the White House he was
[02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:22.600]  responsible for working in the vice president's office at a time that that
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:27.600]  office was responsible for implementing the recovery act now we've talked a lot
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:33.120]  about the carbon taxes yeah this guy's worked for the Clintons and is the
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:36.800]  right-hand man of Al Gore and what he's gonna oversee is the hundreds of
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:43.200]  billions of dollars that are handed out to insiders in the response and there's
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:47.520]  not going to be hundreds of billions made unless a lot of sick people and the
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:50.800]  way they're acting now I'm pretty sure they engineered it and they've got a
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:54.720]  cure for themselves and they'll pass it on to the public with something else in
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:57.920]  the vaccine a little little something extra for you which will make people
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:01.520]  sick which they'll then get everybody trained to go well it did kill a bunch
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:05.920]  people make them sick but would you rather die of Ebola you know it's all
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:12.560]  about just flaunting it breaking your will so it's all about and until you
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:16.960]  understand their evil logic until you understand their twisted ways they
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:20.680]  operate none of this makes sense but I've read their books I mean I read
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:24.560]  their writings I understand them they're very public about how they do this it's
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:28.880]  all a sick joke and there's one common denominator they hate you and your
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:34.920]  family and love seeing you poor and pathetic they enjoy poverty they enjoy
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:40.640]  destitution they enjoy betrayal they enjoy lying and hurting people and
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:44.880]  they're gonna do a lot of it because they're not retail psychopaths that just
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:48.280]  grab some woman off the street and have their way with them they grab whole
[02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:53.000]  societies and they they just just enjoy their work and when they walk around
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:57.160]  on airports and see the mutated kids and see you know go in a restaurant half the
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:00.160]  kids look like they're dying or a third of them are showing autistic spectrum and
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:03.280]  people can hardly talk everybody's screwed up and they're on elevators
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:06.720]  looking at people that can't talk see I'm all freaked out I'm all really
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:10.680]  upset and start crying when I'm in a doctor's office and I see you know three
[02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:14.120]  autistic kids in there and you know I could take my kids to the movies and
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:16.960]  like a third of the movie theater is autistic or whatever and just you can
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:22.720]  see the kids all totally sick and you see babies they look real sick and I'll
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:25.640]  say to the woman I'll say you be getting like a baby a lot of vaccines they'll go
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:29.520]  yes wine I'll go need to look into those I see a really healthy baby I go you
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:33.120]  don't take vaccines this morning I did that and the woman said no I I don't by
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:37.200]  the way I appreciate your work so I just see a little bit but see what these
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:40.480]  people they see all the victims and they're just walking around a power trip
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:43.800]  they're disdain they're like Satan they're hatred for humanity they're
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:49.240]  hatred of gods or hatred of life 54 million dead babies in America they know
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:53.560]  it's a bloody sacrifice and they're just roaring with demonic power just
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:14:01.360]  just incinerating demonic will just full power just selling you on their
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:07.560]  abominations and having their way eat the GMO drink the glyphosate get the
[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:11.880]  breast cancer take the shots prepare to die horrible it's
[02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:18.600]  appreciating deaths oh they love you Ray in California Ray you're on the air go

[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:31.240]  on the show before yeah from she's married to Major General Stubblebine yeah
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:37.080]  right so she claims from she's getting this information from United States
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:45.240]  Department of Defense documents concerning studies on weaponized Ebola
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:50.080]  the cure for Ebola she claims is the actual cure for Ebola is then a silver
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:56.480]  and she discusses this at her YouTube channel listen I'll start sir here's
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:58.960]  I'm gonna one of you listen to the show we probably had 20 of these calls I
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:04.560]  appreciate your call there are Department of Defense studies
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:09.040]  topically and internally guys I meant to wait till break but I can't do it kind
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:13.040]  of glass of water thanks I'm you get my own water but I just forgot to get it
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:19.080]  now I need I'm a thrust drive I've been eating during the break some peppers
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:26.840]  no I wouldn't say anything is a dead ringer cure there's a cure to not
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:31.280]  drowning that's oxygen there's a cure to not get the scurvy that's vitamin C so
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:36.560]  so you can't say you must have iodine or you'll get a deficiency and die you
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:40.920]  must have vitamin C you must have oxygen there's vitamin C and other things and
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:47.840]  the stuff that's in DNA force CoQ 10 bio PQQ does it super boost immune systems
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:54.480]  yes does colloidal silver kill viruses in a petri dish does the Department of
[02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:58.760]  Defense have research documents that have shown that it is certainly a
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:02.880]  promising treatment yes our blood transfusions promising treatments for
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:06.200]  people that have had a bowl and survived absolutely and they're not doing that
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:11.360]  they're giving drugs and vaccines so I know they've gone after folks trying to
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:15.600]  promote colloidal silver as a cure we don't say it's a cure because I don't
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:20.960]  believe it's a dead ringer cure I think it's that word because then you know I
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:26.080]  couldn't get rid of a chest cold that it killed three members of my family this
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:29.800]  winter my dad had had it for two months I had it for a month and a half I went
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:32.720]  over to this house every day and made him drink basically three bottles of
[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:36.720]  colloidal silver I drank to way over what you should do probably not good for
[02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:40.720]  you at that level but I did it because it was better than what I had in my lungs
[02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:45.440]  antibiotics hadn't worked I was off antibiotics two rounds had failed it
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:50.280]  knocked it out killed it praise God that's my own personal experience and so
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:54.080]  yes there are runs on it everywhere we still have a little bit left that came
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:57.080]  in it'll be a couple more weeks till we get more in after that of the 30 parts
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:17:01.640]  per million which it's all technically nano silver was that small silver bullet
[02:17:01.640 --> 02:17:05.120]  so I'm aware of all that stuff that's going on I've been talking to Dr. Group
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:11.560]  has been talking to them it's just that I it's not that I'm even afraid of the
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:17.440]  FDA it's that I legitimately don't think in my view and for the medical doctors
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:21.320]  I've talked to that you can say it's a cure I mean my god if somebody's got
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:25.480]  some colloidal silver and they can track Ebola I mean it probably helps but
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:30.440]  can you say it's gonna knock it out it all depends on the person but yeah
[02:17:30.440 --> 02:17:34.400]  staying away from people that have it sunshine getting your guts cleaned out
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:40.520]  having or not having deficiencies of things what I'm doing is beyond Tangy
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:45.920]  tangerine from four was health.com survival shield silver bullet I've
[02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:50.720]  taken silver bullet twice today and I got a cabinet full of colloidal silver and
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:54.600]  I think ours is one of the best out there but I don't know I've got like five
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:18:01.440]  brands in my house literally I had a bad feeling I never acted like this when I
[02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:06.440]  had three family members die earlier this year and I went and I just and silver
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:09.280]  knocked it out for me I thought man I said on air I said I think this winner
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:15.280]  is gonna be hellish with all the MRSA and all the rest of it and I said you know
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:20.080]  I'm stocking up on this separately myself I've got a whole cabinet full of five
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:23.720]  different brands whole bottom shelf is my brand and then the other shelves are
[02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:28.400]  full of other stuff because you know I got family getting sick or dying again I

[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:54.200]  days to do the test they said to do the property test hours to the preliminary
[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:58.440]  they said don't worry people dying in pools of vomit everything's fine and
[02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:01.360]  they're finding people dead and pools of vomit in Houston out of Nigeria
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:09.480]  everything's fine do you believe that for a second no absolutely not Alex is

[02:33:13.640 --> 02:33:19.240]  well it sounds like the perfect script for a horror movie a virus with no
[02:33:19.240 --> 02:33:25.680]  vaccine and no cure kills thousands of people by being people died in 1996 and
[02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:31.920]  1997 the most the entire population of the world
[02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:37.520]  about 1% of us survived reports of blue cases along the border but officials are
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:41.720]  seeing the art connected surely there's very real and very convincing data that
[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:46.000]  the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race and I actually think the
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:50.760]  world will be much better when there's only 10 or 20% of us left dr. Eric
[02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:55.560]  Bianca but most frightening was the fact that in a crowd of over 1,000
[02:33:55.560 --> 02:34:02.200]  prominent scientists local newspapers reported that 95% of those in attendance
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:08.600]  gave Bianca sustained standing ovations every time he stole the virtues of
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:13.800]  mass culling microbes and man's destruction and went on to laud the
[02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:19.400]  virtues of Ebola because it would kill 90% of the world population quickly the
[02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:23.520]  World Health Organization said on Tuesday the Ebola death toll jumped by
[02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:29.560]  almost 200 in a single day to at least 2,296 and is likely to be higher than
[02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:34.520]  that the head of the US Centers for Disease Control confirmed Tuesday that
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:39.040]  West Africa is in desperate situation but that there is still hope that the
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:44.480]  autoprack can be reigned in a top German virologist has caused shockwaves by
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:49.880]  asserting that it's too late to halt the spread of the Ebola virus in other
[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:55.400]  ways the CDC is receiving reports of a possible flu outbreak in San Francisco if
[02:34:55.400 --> 02:35:00.520]  the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on December 27 1996 that
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:04.840]  makes us know that it was released in Philadelphia probably on December 13
[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:10.880]  1996 and we'll see sequentially after that year in San Francisco New Orleans
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:21.440]  Rio de Janeiro Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:29.360]  Bangkok, Peking some trip you're taking sir is this all in one week? Business. One of the
[02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:33.760]  two Americans infected with the Ebola virus has arrived in Atlanta from
[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:38.560]  Africa for treatment. The Massachusetts doctor arrived at the Nebraska Medical
[02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:43.680]  Center just before dawn this morning to be treated for Ebola and right now his or
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:48.160]  her blood sample is on its way to the Centers for Disease Control. The new
[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:54.560]  ability to wage war is born from the blood of the victims. There you see also
[02:35:54.560 --> 02:36:02.800]  invisible to the naked eye. It doesn't even have an odor. This Ebola outbreak is
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:07.840]  unprecedented and has become the deadliest on record. Ebola is now an
[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:14.680]  epidemic. You start to get a sense of the rapid escalation now we're seeing of
[02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:20.240]  the virus. Imagine a virus, the most terrifying virus you can and then imagine
[02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:25.320]  that you and you alone at the cure. Without specific drugs or a vaccine for
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:30.120]  Ebola the only thing doctors can do for those suffering from this disease is
[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:35.600]  treat their symptoms. Ebola is not spread through the air like the flu. One
[02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:41.360]  will not likely catch the virus just by nearing someone who has it. In 1989
[02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:46.920]  Ebola made its way to the US. This new strain of Ebola had shown the potential
[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:52.720]  to spread through the air. There are no calling this a true pandemic. Five years on.
[02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:58.260]  Still no cure. No cure. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has given 31
[02:36:58.260 --> 02:37:03.120]  million pounds to help battle the Ebola epidemic in Africa. It is hoped it will
[02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:07.080]  also speed up the development of drugs and vaccines as Ebola has killed more
[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:13.120]  than half of its 4,300 victims. First we've got population. Now if we do a
[02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:18.360]  really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, we could lower that by
[02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:23.040]  perhaps 10 or 15 percent. A preventative vaccine for the Ebola virus could be
[02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:27.080]  available as early as next year as British pharma company GlaxoSmith
[02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:33.120]  Klein. So you want to balance the need to get a potentially effective vaccine to
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:37.360]  the people who need it in a way that you can get some meaningful information as
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:42.920]  to a whether it does work or not and whether it does harm. A confidential
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:46.160]  GlaxoSmith Klein document recently linked to the press exposed that within a
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:51.280]  two-year period a total of 36 infants died after receiving the six-in-one
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:58.360]  vaccine of infrex hexa. UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmith Klein will plead guilty
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:03.320]  and pay a record-breaking three billion US dollars to settle the largest case of
[02:38:03.320 --> 02:38:10.240]  healthcare fraud in US history. The vaccine uses a modified chimpanzee
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:15.240]  common cold virus to carry a single Ebola protein. We're ready to move on to the
[02:38:15.240 --> 02:38:21.680]  next phase. It doesn't work like we predicted. With one exception. We can't
[02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:28.160]  dawdle on this one. We have to move with force and make sure that we are
[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:32.600]  catching this as best we can. Nearly two and a half thousand people have died.
[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:37.800]  Thousands more have been infected. Now four thousand. National call for action. President of
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:42.280]  Armour announced America's plan. Which will see 3,000 US troops head to the
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:48.240]  region. 3,000 US military personnel. Compare that to Iraq. There are 1,600 US military
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:52.040]  troops in Iraq right now. We're talking about 3,000 troops. The true goal of this
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:57.600]  project is power. Complete total hegemonic domination. At the request of the
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:01.040]  Liberian government we're gonna establish a military command center in
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:06.520]  Liberia under the pretext of humanitarian aid and dominate and occupy
[02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:11.920]  Africa through Africa. The security firm HaloCorp announced it will conduct a
[02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:17.200]  zombie apocalypse training exercise. Alpha Raji will join about 40 other
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:20.640]  ghoulish friends in the third world village where they'll bring on the
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:25.640]  apocalypse. Strategic operations has strengthened some 600,000 military and
[02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:30.040]  law enforcement numbers using this technique. We got down to a science if
[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:34.600]  you will. If there is such a thing it's an art. It's a government made virus.
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:41.360]  Designed, manufactured to put us out of our misery. They euthanized us. Probably one
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:46.480]  of these numbers is gonna have to get pretty near to zero. That's back from
[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:51.120]  high school algebra. But let's let's take a look. Attention, due to the
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:55.800]  extremity of the Simeon flu crisis, all regular government functions have been
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:40:03.920]  suspended. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:13.800]  That promo is about a month old. A little more than a month old. You can call it a
[02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:22.920]  promo. Here's the headline. AP Africa stems Ebola via border crossings and it
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:25.760]  goes on to say all the countries bordering the nations that have Ebola
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:30.240]  have stopped it and there's no cases for months because they allow no flights
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:34.200]  and no one's allowed to come in. And if they catch you trying to come across you
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:42.160]  know what the army does? They shoot you. And no one dare try because even if you
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:46.880]  sneak across sometimes most of the time you're gonna get killed. That's why you
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:52.160]  have borders is when there's an outbreak in one country you seal the border like
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:58.720]  firewalls in a ship or in a building. These are all blueprints how to stop this
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:04.920]  and they turned them off. But our ship had firewalls. Obama ordered them torn
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:13.840]  out. Our ship had floodwalls. It had bulkheads. They came with blowtorches and
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:20.080]  cut them out. And they wouldn't be doing something this crazy if they weren't
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:23.160]  planning to spread it on purpose.
[02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:28.160]  See if we're watching and can catch them doing a false flag like bringing in
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:32.280]  Al Qaeda or something. Well they'll just do something like bring in Ebola and do
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:35.960]  it in plain view like we're so stupid and then pose the saviors in the response
[02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:43.160]  to it. So we don't have long. I'd give it a week. It may already be too late. If we
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:48.040]  can have a national strike, if all the media gets involved nobody else has
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:51.160]  picked up on this that I've seen, if they pick up on our idea to have a
[02:41:51.160 --> 02:42:00.080]  national strike over Ebola that our guest James David Steele, the CIA, retired
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:06.520]  CIA, field operative. If we go with what he said, he said I think Ebola is going to
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:09.600]  be staged. It's going to be released. There can be a national strike over this
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:13.880]  false flag. And then he didn't want to talk about his prediction when he was on
[02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:18.760]  with us last week. He didn't want to get into it too much. He will be on Sunday.
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:22.920]  I'll be live Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. I wasn't here that day last week. I was dealing
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:27.560]  with my sick grandmother and other things. That's another thing is that you
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:31.440]  know how family stuff, there'll be no family problems for like 10, 15 years.
[02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:35.360]  And then, oh uncle dies, grandma is sick and has gone to nursing home and has
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:41.480]  medical problems and this family crisis pops up and this family member has this
[02:42:41.480 --> 02:42:49.440]  issue. It has been a very eventful last 12 months. I am ready for this cycle to
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:53.400]  end. We've never had more success reaching people, never had more success in
[02:42:53.400 --> 02:43:04.360]  the news operation, but I want success in turning the tide. I get so exhausted
[02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:11.800]  sometimes by the third hour. I kind of barrel through it being angry and
[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:20.720]  sarcastic the first two hours, but I just can't believe how bad our government
[02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:24.920]  is. I just can't believe how evil they are. They are just the worst. They are so
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:33.680]  evil. They have such twisted ways of thinking and doing things. It's the
[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:38.440]  slow-motion trainwreck I don't like. I'm going to have to watch them spread Ebola
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:42.280]  and watch them grandstand and watch them take our rights and watch them make
[02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:49.360]  money off of it with the Al Gore scammer they've got running it. Don't they
[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:53.520]  ever get brought to justice? No, they'll probably just arrest more Tea Party
[02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:57.320]  people and set up more folks for crooked toenails or not following their taxes
[02:43:57.320 --> 02:44:01.800]  right. They'll probably, you know, arrest some more pro-lifers or something. I
[02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:09.080]  don't know. Meanwhile, you got the University of Texas students 17 out of
[02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:13.320]  30 want to bring Ebola patients here and house them in their homes. Just mental
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:19.920]  midgets. Pray. Just helpless little idiots. Arrested development. Just
[02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:23.920]  pathetic. Watch TV their whole lives. Never been challenged. Never even been in a
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:32.800]  fight. Never ever had to work a job. They all just get government funding. Just
[02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:39.680]  shuffling around. Just empty. And then we try to protect them from the globalist
[02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:45.120]  takeover and they don't want to be protected. Instead they serve the enemy
[02:44:45.120 --> 02:44:49.720]  and want our guns and our kids and want to arrest pastors in Houston for their
[02:44:49.720 --> 02:44:58.200]  speech. I mean, what a freak show. What a freak show. What a freak show.
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:05.400]  James and Texas, thanks for holding your own the year. Yes, Alex. Can you hear me?
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:11.040]  I can hear you, brother. Go ahead. Hey, man, I'm down here about 30 miles west of
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:17.560]  our nation's ground zero. The cleaning guys. The guys that's been running
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:22.280]  around cleaning up this Ebola mess. About six months ago, I was working with
[02:45:22.280 --> 02:45:27.000]  them and I kind of quit when, you know, I found out that Ebola was getting big
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.560]  from me talking about it in other countries because I knew that it would
[02:45:29.560 --> 02:45:34.720]  be the guys cleaning it up. Well, sorry to prove you're not racist and run to
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:39.480]  the scene and eat the vomit. The vomit of an Ebola victim is the only thing as
[02:45:39.480 --> 02:45:44.640]  holy as Obama himself. You didn't know that? Sorry. Go ahead. And I'll tell you
[02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:50.320]  from the hours and days of training I've had to get the load of crap. They're
[02:45:50.320 --> 02:45:57.120]  lying to us and the people are eating it up. Well, some of them are. I mean, we
[02:45:57.120 --> 02:46:00.720]  know the UT students that literally can hardly talk are, you know, they're
[02:46:00.720 --> 02:46:04.960]  paying $400,000 of a worthless education, but they can watch Bevo. That's
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:09.720]  okay because Bevo's there. But if you expand on that, the polls show people
[02:46:09.720 --> 02:46:16.840]  hate the CDC and hate Obama, but they don't care. He hates us even more. So you
[02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:20.520]  quit doing, I guess you work for an environmental cleanup group and you
[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:28.080]  foresaw Ebola coming? Yeah, I mean. Why do you think they had them clean up
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:35.680]  Ebola vomit and Ebola droppings? Why do you think they had them clean that up
[02:46:35.680 --> 02:46:46.320]  without has meant gear on? But imagine it's on the news that the guys at the
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:51.200]  hospital and they're there, they know it's Ebola vomit. I mean,
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:56.120]  Ebola vomit, excuse me. They know it's Ebola vomit and they're there just
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:47:02.160]  without any gear on cleaning it. I mean, what's wrong with people? It blows my
[02:47:02.160 --> 02:47:07.800]  mind. But since Obama's got all his specialists that know better than the
[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:11.880]  hundreds that you talk to, why don't he start a show and just take him into the
[02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:15.160]  White House? Take the government facility he can house him in? No, I agree. We
[02:47:15.160 --> 02:47:20.040]  should have a petition that they house at least the dirty diapers and Ebola
[02:47:20.040 --> 02:47:26.080]  victims in the in the Oval Office. How many signatures do we need out? Well,
[02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:29.680]  here's the deal. People say, well, Obama doesn't act on it. It doesn't matter. It
[02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:33.400]  draws attention that there's a petition up there. So I think we should have a
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:39.320]  petition to store the medical waste of the Ebola victims there at the White
[02:47:39.320 --> 02:47:43.640]  House since you can't get it, Obama said. I appreciate your call. It's like that
[02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:47.640]  Conrad the Constitution episode where they fall down the giant toilet
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:51.240]  following the Affordable Care Act. They find it all comes out at the White
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:57.200]  House. I haven't looked at that in a while. What's the latest Conrad
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:03.080]  Constitution? Starring Alex Jones and Ron Paul. Anthony in Florida, you're on the
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:12.560]  air. Go ahead. Hello. Hey, how you doing? I'm doing pretty good. Listen, I
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:18.880]  have I got a comment. Another reason why I think this so-called war against this
[02:48:18.880 --> 02:48:24.880]  is ISIS is the fact that why would a terrorist organization name themselves
[02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:30.800]  for an Egyptian goddess? Well, look, sir, it's all was thought up in a PR boardroom
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:35.200]  probably in Hollywood or New York as a way to see American people who can
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:43.240]  hardly talk to go ISIS. I mean, it's on record. It was created by the West and
[02:48:43.240 --> 02:48:47.680]  funded and armed and then they go and then now NATO is fighter bombing the
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:52.840]  Kurds that are fighting them. So NATO is giving air support to Al Qaeda. That's
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:57.600]  Obama's operation. The thing is, ISIS is going to go in there and
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:00.880]  slaughter them people and then the Turks can just sit across the border and go
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:08.120]  You know what I'm saying? That's right. And it's only Gwitty Woodpecker. I like it.
[02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:14.440]  FX series Archer removes ISIS spy agency name from upcoming season. See that
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:18.200]  is spy agency name to ISIS. They're all just thrown in our face. I talked to
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:22.800]  people involved in X-Men and lone gunmen on record and the CIA came to them and
[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:27.240]  said, we think you should put an episode with a government flies hijacked jets in
[02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:32.160]  the World Trade Center to blame it on Afghanistan invade using a terror drill
[02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:37.680]  to make Norat stand down claiming there's hijackers on board. That's why
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:41.760]  they had an episode six months before 9-11 of just that happening. It's all
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:45.800]  about flaunting it. That's why the CIA declassified that indeed they harassed
[02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:52.760]  and tried to destroy Gary Webb for his CIA drug dealing story. They released it
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:57.520]  just to say, hey, we'll do this to anybody we don't like. They publicly said
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:08.080]  it's all true. Yeah, they came out a month ago and they said you bet and the
[02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:11.200]  Hollywood movie came out. They basically admit they kill him and that's just the
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:20.800]  way it is. Yeah, we're gonna abort more babies too and then we're gonna have you
[02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:23.840]  drink glyphosate and we're gonna put it in all your food and let's you grow big
[02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:28.520]  old giant tumors and then if you go up to the cash register and they go such
[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:32.640]  give money for breast cancer research you go well no no actually I'd like to
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:36.320]  give money though to preventing it if we could get the glyphosates out some of
[02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:38.560]  the things that are shown to actually grow the tumors.

[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:57.920]  thanks for calling. Hi Alex, how are you? Good. You have scared the heck out of me
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:01.440]  for the past two years about these globalists and how they wanted to take
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:06.080]  down America. So I came up with an idea but this idea won't work unless you help
[02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:10.480]  us with it. Basically what I'm looking for is to try and find out who these
[02:56:10.480 --> 02:56:14.400]  people are. In other words, if you had a website, put up their names, their
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:18.320]  addresses, and phone numbers on it, believe me America within six months
[02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:22.880]  will take it back again. This will help these people on the run because we'll be
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:26.160]  pestering them so dark on much. I totally agree with you but people have to realize
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:29.760]  the power they have, not the power that I have. I mean all of us together. The
[02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:33.560]  article just went live on infowars.com. We're going to tweet it at real Alex
[02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:39.000]  Jones. Please retweet it folks. It's hashtag stop Ebola strike. National
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:43.720]  strike to force Obama to block West Africa flights. Administration committing
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:48.480]  criminal neglect by failing to secure America against outbreak. And we also
[02:56:48.480 --> 02:56:52.400]  need to add in there and secure our border and prepare for the massive
[02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:57.840]  influx that General Kelly has warned about. We're going to keep beefing up
[02:56:57.840 --> 02:57:02.840]  this article but this is it. We've got to push for the national strike next
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:06.840]  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Even if a few percentage points of people don't go
[02:57:06.840 --> 02:57:10.480]  into work and then spend that time on the Internet and calling Congress and
[02:57:10.480 --> 02:57:15.360]  others, it will have a huge effect. So get other media to cover this. We need to
[02:57:15.360 --> 02:57:20.440]  stop the Ebola. We need to secure the border and stop the flights and point
[02:57:20.440 --> 02:57:23.760]  out the American people started demonstrating against this. Anything else
[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:27.520]  Tim? No, that was it. I was just wondering whether we can get that
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:33.760]  website going with their names on it. Say your idea again. Basically what I'm
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:38.720]  looking for is a website that you might start with the names, addresses and
[02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:42.880]  phone numbers of these people. America will get rid of them themselves just by
[02:57:42.880 --> 02:57:46.640]  pestering the heck out of them in six months. Well we should point out and
[02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:49.240]  create a master list of the top globalists that are behind all this.
[02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:53.200]  So people just understand who needs to be investigated, who needs to be
[02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:57.440]  watched legally and lawfully. I agree with you. Let's talk to Roger in
[02:57:57.440 --> 02:58:02.840]  Connecticut. One minute to break. Go ahead Roger. Hi Mr. Jones. Thank you for
[02:58:02.840 --> 02:58:07.520]  you know and God bless you and your family and for all the good work that
[02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:12.840]  you've done over the years. I want to talk about precautions real quick.
[02:58:12.840 --> 02:58:17.680]  I did order the oxy powder. I've been taking it for the past seven days and
[02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:24.240]  it's amazing. So with that said, I feel like I have more energy in my new system
[02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:30.840]  and also as other precautions, I'm a distributor for FOIA Research and what
[02:58:30.840 --> 02:58:35.680]  I've discovered about transfer factors. I know there are more about this when we

[02:58:54.720 --> 02:58:58.520]  more and more toxic each and every day. But it's not just the air outside that's
[02:58:58.520 --> 02:59:02.680]  toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations
[02:59:02.680 --> 02:59:06.720]  of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time
[02:59:06.720 --> 02:59:11.200]  inside using toxic chemicals within their homes. There are more than 42 million
[02:59:11.200 --> 02:59:15.320]  smokers in the United States. Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew
[02:59:15.320 --> 02:59:18.920]  linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million
[02:59:18.920 --> 02:59:22.080]  Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well. When I began to
[02:59:22.080 --> 02:59:26.160]  research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my
[02:59:26.160 --> 02:59:30.320]  lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but
[02:59:30.320 --> 02:59:34.400]  we can fight back against. Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and

[03:00:26.720 --> 03:00:32.160]  We're gonna be beefing it up. Hashtag stop Ebola strike. National strike before
[03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:35.680]  so moment of lock West African flights. Starts Monday, goes through next
[03:00:35.680 --> 03:00:38.800]  Wednesday. They haven't acted. It goes right through Friday. I don't know if it's
[03:00:38.800 --> 03:00:43.280]  gonna be successful. That's up to you. Roger you're getting into fluoride. Go
[03:00:43.280 --> 03:00:51.320]  ahead. Yeah, so I'm talking about transfer factors and when I used to work
[03:00:51.320 --> 03:00:56.160]  as a distributor for four life research, I learned that these transfer factors
[03:00:56.160 --> 03:00:59.720]  which are panning, you can find them in the physician desk reference in the
[03:00:59.720 --> 03:01:06.160]  first page of the supplements and they're proven to elevate your your
[03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:13.160]  defenses by 487%. And every time I will go to the doctor's office and bring up
[03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:17.800]  this conversation about it, they would just toss me aside or rush me out right
[03:01:17.800 --> 03:01:21.720]  away. And that's when I started noticing that this, this gotta be something
[03:01:21.720 --> 03:01:26.120]  important about these transfer factors and I've been taking them for three years.
[03:01:26.120 --> 03:01:34.680]  And also, I mean, that's the kind of stuff. Transfer factor transfer factors
[03:01:34.680 --> 03:01:38.800]  have come from the colostrum of the milk of a cow. Yes, from the egg yolk of the
[03:01:38.800 --> 03:01:41.240]  chicken. Now this stuff is well known in
[03:01:41.240 --> 03:01:45.840]  documented that they use it in Russia. The Russian Health Ministry actually
[03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:51.200]  mandated by law that every clinic, anyone that steps foot in clinics out there
[03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:55.600]  needs to take these transfer factors because there's a lot of sicknesses and
[03:01:55.600 --> 03:01:59.760]  diseases inside clinics and hospitals. No, I was aware of that. I was aware of that.
[03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:03.000]  Great point. We'll look into that transfer factors. Thank you so much for that
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:07.600]  tip. Great info, Roger. John in California, you're on the air.
[03:02:07.600 --> 03:02:12.360]  I stepped in my call. Former Lieutenant Commander Navy here, also a nursing
[03:02:12.360 --> 03:02:17.600]  supervisor at Folsom, a big maximum security prison in California. Oh yeah.
[03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:23.800]  Just got word that we're to start training in preparation of a bowl of
[03:02:23.800 --> 03:02:30.760]  patient potential. We've been referred to the CDC sites, treatment modalities,
[03:02:30.760 --> 03:02:36.760]  protective clothing. My point is they wouldn't be doing this if they didn't
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:41.600]  think there was a chance that the ship's gonna hit the proverbial fan. Other than
[03:02:41.600 --> 03:02:47.920]  that, your strike is a great idea. A lot of us medical types listen to you for
[03:02:47.920 --> 03:02:52.280]  crying out loud. Let's let all the medical people in your audience know that
[03:02:52.280 --> 03:02:57.560]  we need to honor this strike because we're gonna be on the front line when
[03:02:57.560 --> 03:03:03.440]  this gets out of control and we need to stand firm. We need the nursing unions,
[03:03:03.440 --> 03:03:08.200]  the police unions, the EMT unions. I mean, you guys, the prison people, it's gonna
[03:03:08.200 --> 03:03:12.280]  be living hell if we don't contain this. I mean, you guys are just really gonna
[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:16.000]  be the highest level of infected. Look how it's nurses right now. So I mean,
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:19.400]  that's why we're doing this strike and I know we're organizing it quick. I should
[03:03:19.400 --> 03:03:22.160]  have done it earlier. I don't know why nobody else is doing it, but thank you
[03:03:22.160 --> 03:03:25.960]  for helping us. We're gonna just try to get people organized as best we can.
[03:03:25.960 --> 03:03:31.800]  Let's get rid of this politically correct Obama policy. It's crazy. It's
[03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:38.400]  insane. And I'm a psychiatric nurse. It's insane. What do you think's going on?
[03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:43.320]  Because it really is insane. Why would they hire an Ebola czar who has no
[03:03:43.320 --> 03:03:49.760]  medical history? No medical training? Well, that's a good question, but I
[03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:54.600]  think it's probably because they have no medical training and they'll get
[03:03:54.600 --> 03:03:59.920]  spoon fed whatever propaganda the administration wants to put out. No, I
[03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:03.160]  totally agree with you. You know, I want to keep taking phone calls here, but I've
[03:04:03.160 --> 03:04:06.560]  got to go shoot something for the news. I want to talk to John and Ohio says
[03:04:06.560 --> 03:04:10.960]  their director of infectious disease airborne. We've got Ron. We've got Scott.
[03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:16.120]  We got a lot of calls. I want to go to David Knight want to come sitting here
[03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:21.880]  for for 30 minutes and maybe take some of these calls because I've got to go,
[03:04:21.880 --> 03:04:25.680]  but I want to keep taking these calls. Listen, caller from Folsom prison.
[03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:31.560]  Thank you for calling. I'm stuck in Folsom prison and time keeps dragging on,
[03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:37.640]  but that train keeps coming and that's what tortures me. I think I just butchered
[03:04:37.640 --> 03:04:41.200]  Johnny Cash's song. We're gonna see if David Knight wants to come in. We can have
[03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:47.320]  a long intro and get to a few more of your calls. 800-25-99231. I'm gonna go

[03:04:51.080 --> 03:04:54.920]  to beef it up. I got the nightly news. I need to shoot. So I'll see you back this

[03:06:59.240 --> 03:07:03.600]  Gold. It's like nothing else on earth. From the Romans through the Renaissance,
[03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:08.520]  from the industrial age to the space age, gold has weathered the test of time. For
[03:07:08.520 --> 03:07:12.960]  6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth. According to
[03:07:12.960 --> 03:07:17.320]  the World Gold Council in the US Mint, demand is at an all-time high. The stage
[03:07:17.320 --> 03:07:21.480]  is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a
[03:07:21.480 --> 03:07:26.640]  fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day. Midas Resources is proud to

[03:08:00.560 --> 03:08:09.160]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.160 --> 03:08:21.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and Alex had to take care
[03:08:21.560 --> 03:08:24.760]  of some business and previous commitments so I wanted to take your phone
[03:08:24.760 --> 03:08:29.240]  calls here. We just had someone that I would very much like to talk to that
[03:08:29.240 --> 03:08:32.920]  hung up John in Ohio. John if you want to call back we're gonna try to take
[03:08:32.920 --> 03:08:37.440]  calls through the end of this segment so we've got about another 12 minutes or
[03:08:37.440 --> 03:08:40.120]  so so we might be able to get to if you want to call back but let's go right now
[03:08:40.120 --> 03:08:55.800]  to Ron in Canada. Ron? Hi there. Hey how you doing? Good, how are you good? I'm gonna ask you a question about geopolitics. Sure. I just wanted you to explain it because I heard that they're
[03:08:55.800 --> 03:09:02.760]  using it to create World War 3. You want me to explain geopolitics? Right. Let's say how
[03:09:02.760 --> 03:09:09.880]  much time we got here. Well you know what we see is a revival of the Cold War and
[03:09:09.880 --> 03:09:14.080]  there's absolutely no reason for it. We were the aggressors in that area I think
[03:09:14.080 --> 03:09:16.760]  that's probably what you're talking about when you talk about World War 3. Of
[03:09:16.760 --> 03:09:22.560]  course we've also seen the plan to take down multiple Middle Eastern countries.
[03:09:22.560 --> 03:09:26.400]  Syria was on the map. Iran is on the map. General Wesley Clark had mentioned
[03:09:26.400 --> 03:09:30.480]  that. He gave us the list. We see this list being walked down sequentially. It's
[03:09:30.480 --> 03:09:34.400]  that type of thing of course but it's also a consolidation of power but
[03:09:34.400 --> 03:09:37.960]  there's different power groups. I mean it's a very, I mean just just listen to
[03:09:37.960 --> 03:09:41.640]  the program you'll get it but I can't give you a breakdown on the whole topic
[03:09:41.640 --> 03:09:47.120]  here in just a couple of minutes. Did you have a question? Yes. Is Obama using geopolitics?
[03:09:47.120 --> 03:09:53.600]  Do you think? Well yeah I mean that's absolutely the strategy. I mean if you
[03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:56.360]  look at the techniques that have been going back to and this is both parties.
[03:09:56.360 --> 03:10:01.680]  I mean we've had Henry Kissinger that was essentially running Richard Nixon and
[03:10:01.680 --> 03:10:06.680]  then we had the big new Presentee come in with Jimmy Carter. I mean there's
[03:10:06.680 --> 03:10:10.520]  essentially these guys have created organizations like the CFR. They work
[03:10:10.520 --> 03:10:13.280]  through Bilderberg. They work through all these different globalist organizations
[03:10:13.280 --> 03:10:17.360]  and so yeah they use that. They can call it any number of different labels.
[03:10:17.360 --> 03:10:21.320]  Well also they just want to mention the International Monetary Fund also has
[03:10:21.320 --> 03:10:25.320]  certain policies in place as well right? That's right. That's right. Well listen I
[03:10:25.320 --> 03:10:28.120]  want to move on because I want to get some of these comments on Ebola. That's
[03:10:28.120 --> 03:10:31.520]  really what we wanted to talk to about the people today that are hanging. They've
[03:10:31.520 --> 03:10:34.800]  got a lot of, we got a lot of people who wanted to call in about Ebola. Thanks for
[03:10:34.800 --> 03:10:40.880]  calling Ron. Let's go to Nick in Connecticut. Nick go ahead. Hi. How are you doing Dave?
[03:10:40.880 --> 03:10:44.600]  I'm fine. Thanks for calling. I didn't want to talk about Ebola. I just wanted to
[03:10:44.600 --> 03:10:50.120]  mention something real quick on Silver. There's a guy, he ran a blog for
[03:10:50.120 --> 03:10:55.840]  15 years named Harvey Orgen. Google just removed his blog and said it was
[03:10:55.840 --> 03:11:02.320]  because of a court order. Now about a month ago he was on a Altenews website
[03:11:02.320 --> 03:11:08.000]  called USA Watchdog where he said what Harvey Orgen does is he specializes in
[03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:12.960]  looking at the physical amounts worldwide of like how much silver and gold
[03:11:12.960 --> 03:11:17.560]  like the physical amount of it or you know is and how it's traded and he said
[03:11:17.560 --> 03:11:23.440]  the Shanghai Express in mid to late November this year coming up is gonna
[03:11:23.440 --> 03:11:28.520]  run out of physical silver. So that's where China gets most of its silver
[03:11:28.520 --> 03:11:32.960]  right now physically which they use in the industry and all that. It's from the
[03:11:32.960 --> 03:11:36.920]  Shanghai Express. Shanghai exchange. So when that runs out the only place they
[03:11:36.920 --> 03:11:42.960]  can go to get physical is in the COMEX and if you know anything about the
[03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:45.920]  COMEX you know they don't have anything. Well I understand. I mean I've been
[03:11:45.920 --> 03:11:49.160]  looking at this myself too for a long time. We look at things that are precious
[03:11:49.160 --> 03:11:52.280]  metals or things that actually in the Constitution were supposed to be our
[03:11:52.280 --> 03:11:55.560]  money silver and gold. That was how the dollar was defined. It wasn't in a fiat
[03:11:55.560 --> 03:12:00.720]  currency. Nevertheless they can use these fiat currencies to suppress markets. So
[03:12:00.720 --> 03:12:04.280]  even though the supply is shrinking that doesn't mean that they can't rig the
[03:12:04.280 --> 03:12:08.080]  market and they've done that in the past with both silver and with gold. So it's
[03:12:08.080 --> 03:12:11.200]  difficult to predict that based on just looking at quantities that are
[03:12:11.200 --> 03:12:16.240]  extant out there. But of course if people are concerned about it what's going on
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:19.480]  with Ebola people might start hoarding all types of things. They might even hoard
[03:12:19.480 --> 03:12:23.360]  them for health purposes because silver has some connections with
[03:12:23.360 --> 03:12:27.920]  disinfectant. It's been a very reliable disinfectant for a very long time.
[03:12:27.920 --> 03:12:32.080]  Let's move on to Andrew and Illinois. Thank you Nick. Andrew and Illinois. Go
[03:12:32.080 --> 03:12:39.520]  ahead. I was watching your show and I noticed that Ebola is surfacing as
[03:12:39.520 --> 03:12:44.920]  lasting longer than a leash over the day. She revealed that in Minnesota
[03:12:44.920 --> 03:12:49.920]  epidemiologists came forward that it can survive for several days on a hard dry
[03:12:49.920 --> 03:12:53.800]  surface. Yeah I'm seeing different information about that. As a matter of
[03:12:53.800 --> 03:12:57.160]  fact one of the stories that was linked on Drudge to the weekly standard they
[03:12:57.160 --> 03:13:03.080]  were talking about a much much longer period of time that it could survive on
[03:13:03.080 --> 03:13:06.440]  surfaces. They said the reason they're washing stuff down with chlorine and I
[03:13:06.440 --> 03:13:11.560]  can't remember the amount of time they said but it was quite a long time. I had
[03:13:11.560 --> 03:13:16.040]  seen in the past that it was only they said hours or days. That was the official
[03:13:16.040 --> 03:13:20.800]  word before from the CDC. They said it got shorter if it was exposed to sunlight.
[03:13:20.800 --> 03:13:24.440]  Now with this article and I haven't checked that source they were saying it
[03:13:24.440 --> 03:13:27.720]  was much longer than that. I thought it was also interesting in that article they
[03:13:27.720 --> 03:13:32.240]  mentioned that scientists that were working with this most recent outbreak
[03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:38.680]  had over this last six months identified 100 different strains or
[03:13:38.680 --> 03:13:42.720]  mutants mutations within that Ebola virus. So I thought that was pretty
[03:13:42.720 --> 03:13:45.920]  amazing. I don't know if that's typical or not maybe if we've got somebody who's
[03:13:45.920 --> 03:13:50.360]  a medical person, epidemiologist they could speak to that but I thought that
[03:13:50.360 --> 03:13:55.200]  was an amazing piece of information as well. Thank you. Let's go to Scott in
[03:13:55.200 --> 03:14:00.240]  Nebraska Scott. Okay I got three questions or statements here and what if
[03:14:00.240 --> 03:14:04.200]  what you know Ebola gets into the water supply if it has to go through the water
[03:14:04.200 --> 03:14:10.360]  systems to get purified out and if if this is just payback with CIA that
[03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:15.440]  actually used Ebola to reduce the populations in Africa is this something
[03:14:15.440 --> 03:14:22.760]  Obama's letting in because it's kind of a re what you call it to payback and the
[03:14:22.760 --> 03:14:27.880]  other one is a kind of friend of a friend and ended up in a park. He was M.K.
[03:14:27.880 --> 03:14:32.920]  Altra said that they told him to go shoot up a school, ended up in a park woke up
[03:14:32.920 --> 03:14:38.040]  and they had all the magazines loaded for his 9 millimeter. Well you know in
[03:14:38.040 --> 03:14:42.400]  terms of putting it in the water supply we know that they already do dump toxic
[03:14:42.400 --> 03:14:48.400]  substances into the water supply. Fluoride is a class 4 toxic substance you
[03:14:48.400 --> 03:14:53.240]  can see that we've we've actually gone to the Austin City water supply here in
[03:14:53.240 --> 03:14:56.680]  Austin and taken pictures of it. You can see the corroded pipes you can see the
[03:14:56.680 --> 03:15:00.960]  class 4 right there as as high as it goes. We put that in there because of
[03:15:00.960 --> 03:15:04.040]  course that helps the companies that generate that toxic waste they don't
[03:15:04.040 --> 03:15:07.600]  have to pay a lot of money to dispose of it they can just dump it into our water
[03:15:07.600 --> 03:15:11.120]  and you know what even if you think that fluoride is something that's good for
[03:15:11.120 --> 03:15:15.880]  you if you think that it's medicine that everybody ought to take when would you
[03:15:15.880 --> 03:15:20.440]  ever just dump medicine into the water supply you can't control the dosage so
[03:15:20.440 --> 03:15:22.960]  people are going to get undermedicated they're going to get overmedicated you
[03:15:22.960 --> 03:15:27.120]  don't have the same kind of dosage for a child that you have for an adult so it
[03:15:27.120 --> 03:15:32.120]  makes absolutely no sense to add that to the water supply. In terms of you know
[03:15:32.120 --> 03:15:36.440]  what's going on in Africa I think it's very interesting and noteworthy that the
[03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:42.040]  U.S. military didn't even have an AFRICOM an Africa specialty command they
[03:15:42.040 --> 03:15:46.720]  didn't even have that until 2007. I think it's also interesting to note that
[03:15:46.720 --> 03:15:51.640]  Bilderberg in 2013 amongst their biggest topics that they said they were going to
[03:15:51.640 --> 03:15:55.880]  be talking about big data that came out before the Snowden break and then the
[03:15:55.880 --> 03:15:59.600]  other one was Africa you know they'd like to get those resources in Africa but
[03:15:59.600 --> 03:16:04.320]  they don't want to look like their neocolonial colonialists so you know
[03:16:04.320 --> 03:16:08.440]  that's another interesting data point right there let's go to Tom in Connecticut
[03:16:08.440 --> 03:16:16.120]  Tom. Good day David. Pleasure talking to you. I was going to talk about Ebola one
[03:16:16.120 --> 03:16:21.080]  of the I know that government a government won't allow something to
[03:16:21.080 --> 03:16:25.160]  happen unless they feel at the high level at the highest levels that they
[03:16:25.160 --> 03:16:30.480]  can manage it and it's my belief and I've talked to some people who are still
[03:16:30.480 --> 03:16:34.400]  like still associated with that are connected with the government they've
[03:16:34.400 --> 03:16:39.560]  they've said that the the Ebola coming here is essentially a almost like a
[03:16:39.560 --> 03:16:45.000]  pesticide and the pesticides being applied to the past and those tests are
[03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:52.120]  us. Absolutely. It's their belief that they have an immunity to it either through
[03:16:52.120 --> 03:16:56.560]  vaccinations or whatever and that they're not worried about the Ebola coming
[03:16:56.560 --> 03:17:01.800]  here they basically want to get rid of us and this is one of the reasons why
[03:17:01.800 --> 03:17:05.480]  they may be just testing it with Ebola kind of a weak strain but they're
[03:17:05.480 --> 03:17:10.840]  trying to test it with us but that's that was one of the comments that I talked
[03:17:10.840 --> 03:17:17.160]  to some of my friends about and they they really feel that this is this is
[03:17:17.160 --> 03:17:22.640]  staged in the sense of they know it they know that I mean the people that have
[03:17:22.640 --> 03:17:27.280]  the cavalier attitude about Ebola coming here you know just by watching
[03:17:27.280 --> 03:17:31.520]  their behavior it just seems like they're not concerned about catching it
[03:17:31.520 --> 03:17:36.320]  and so I'm gonna have a report tonight on the nightly news about the Gaia
[03:17:36.320 --> 03:17:40.040]  theory and of course this is something came from a British scientist Lovelock
[03:17:40.040 --> 03:17:45.040]  and in that they openly say that the human population is an infection on
[03:17:45.040 --> 03:17:49.080]  Mother Earth they see Mother Earth as a living organism it's kind of a pagan
[03:17:49.080 --> 03:17:52.960]  view they even name it after the theory after a pagan god but there are a lot of
[03:17:52.960 --> 03:17:56.960]  people of all different stripes that want to see population reduction there
[03:17:56.960 --> 03:18:00.840]  are some individuals who bought into this silly theory there's also a lot of
[03:18:00.840 --> 03:18:05.520]  people in very high places who have made it very clear that that's exactly what
[03:18:05.520 --> 03:18:09.600]  they would want they see the human population as a virus and they see
[03:18:09.600 --> 03:18:13.800]  Ebola in many cases as the cure they even talk about the humans being a
[03:18:13.800 --> 03:18:18.640]  cancer on the on the planet and they say you know what we do with cancer you
[03:18:18.640 --> 03:18:23.040]  know so there's a lot of mentality out there amongst the general population
[03:18:23.040 --> 03:18:26.560]  people who have been sold this idea by some of the elites and then there are a
[03:18:26.560 --> 03:18:30.200]  lot of people in very powerful positions who would like to see population
[03:18:30.200 --> 03:18:34.160]  reduction for a variety of reasons and so they pursued a variety of strategies
[03:18:34.160 --> 03:18:39.200]  to do this you've got agenda 21 to control people you've got birth control
[03:18:39.200 --> 03:18:44.080]  where they want to basically take the population down gradually over a period
[03:18:44.080 --> 03:18:46.800]  of time by sterilizing people and then there's other people who just want to go
[03:18:46.800 --> 03:18:50.720]  out and wipe out the population so there's a lot of different people along
[03:18:50.720 --> 03:18:54.360]  that spectrum I would not discount something like that from ever happening
[03:18:54.360 --> 03:18:58.040]  we've had people as we pointed out the scientists here at the University of
[03:18:58.040 --> 03:19:01.320]  Texas bragged about that got a standing ovation from the other scientists there
[03:19:01.320 --> 03:19:06.000]  so there are a lot of people who have the capability to do that that would like
[03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:10.080]  to do that same thing let's move along I want to go to Dave in Massachusetts go
[03:19:10.080 --> 03:19:19.080]  ahead Dave hi David thanks for taking my call this is regarding Ebola first I
[03:19:19.080 --> 03:19:25.440]  want to start with the topic of vampirism and the globalists they seem to
[03:19:25.440 --> 03:19:32.280]  be in a sense a group of vampires they feed on life and they feed on our work
[03:19:32.280 --> 03:19:39.160]  our positivity and they try and turn it into negative energy so with that I'm
[03:19:39.160 --> 03:19:47.160]  gonna go to mainstream media or sources I should say I think we're out of time
[03:19:47.160 --> 03:19:51.640]  sorry sorry the people that we couldn't get to that's it for today join us
[03:19:51.640 --> 03:19:55.760]  tonight the nightly news at 7 central 8 p.m. Eastern and of course the radio
[03:19:55.760 --> 03:20:11.320]  show will be back tomorrow at 11 central join us then
