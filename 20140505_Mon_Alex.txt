[00:14.640 --> 00:41.760]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen I don't know
[00:41.760 --> 00:49.600]  where to begin on this fifth day of May 2014 live worldwide broadcast I don't know where to start
[00:49.600 --> 00:55.560]  there is so much news so much to break down so much unfolding as we see the conversion of our
[00:55.560 --> 01:04.600]  society from a somewhat free system to a totally authoritarian oppressive unfair unjust fraudulent
[01:04.600 --> 01:14.680]  system as in the days of Noah so will it be in the days of the coming of the Antichrist to paraphrase
[01:14.680 --> 01:18.980]  a quote out of the Bible and I was saying that because I saw a story from the blaze up on
[01:18.980 --> 01:25.520]  drudgereport.com are the end times upon us author says unrestrained immorality mirrors
[01:25.520 --> 01:31.640]  pandemic godlessness seen in the Bible and I thought instead of looking at all the news
[01:31.640 --> 01:36.600]  that's unfolding and we will the White House correspondence dinner Obama's latest sickening
[01:36.600 --> 01:43.960]  jokes about Rand Paul and the Bundy's Ron Paul exclusive interview up on info wars.com common
[01:43.960 --> 01:51.040]  core is really the last straw getting into the fact that it's a deliberate plan to dumb down our
[01:51.040 --> 01:55.600]  youth that's what Ron Paul is pointing out I know you know that and I know that but the general
[01:55.600 --> 02:03.960]  public is just not realizing this is a premeditated program also Patriot group protest Cinco de
[02:03.960 --> 02:10.600]  Mayo ban on American flag t-shirts all over the country public schools so you can't have an
[02:10.600 --> 02:17.120]  American flag t-shirt that's up on info wars.com CIA and FBI worked with fascists in Ukraine as
[02:17.120 --> 02:24.240]  war in Europe unfolds I mean you've got massacres 30 40 people being killed today mainly by the
[02:24.240 --> 02:30.960]  pro-Ukrain government forces again I'm not endorsing the Russians but they didn't start this the
[02:30.960 --> 02:35.960]  most those areas that are in eastern Ukraine were part of Russia historically again Ron Paul's
[02:35.960 --> 02:41.400]  article exclusive interview former congressman slams deliberate plan to create dumb down obedient
[02:41.400 --> 02:49.840]  population Obama supporters say not liking Mexican food is racist I'm not kidding students say
[02:49.840 --> 02:56.840]  it's illegal to wear an American flag shirt on Cinco de Mayo like this is all a free speech
[02:56.840 --> 03:04.600]  issue and we actually have that video as well coming up in the next segment I think I'm gonna
[03:04.600 --> 03:11.320]  get into the whole first amendment issue and and really project forward to the future and ask
[03:11.320 --> 03:18.000]  what type of Balkanized country is this where you can't have an American flag t-shirt period in
[03:18.000 --> 03:25.760]  many areas I just don't think of de Mayo and how effective the establishment has been at creating
[03:25.760 --> 03:34.280]  division in this country Israel wants to give Mount Zion and the tomb of David to the Vatican
[03:34.280 --> 03:39.880]  that's a Michael Schneider article up on info wars.com Ron Paul is another article up on info
[03:39.880 --> 03:48.400]  wars.com why we are no longer number one and I've been so busy just trying to put out fires
[03:48.400 --> 03:58.920]  around here and complete a bunch of projects that I haven't even even had time to slow down and
[03:58.920 --> 04:05.200]  just pull back from everything and say where are we as a civilization where are we going what
[04:05.200 --> 04:16.560]  is your gut tell you is going to happen my gut tells me war depression massive change and that's
[04:16.560 --> 04:22.040]  what all the British Ministry of Defense documents say the Pentagon documents say that's what the
[04:22.040 --> 04:26.200]  Pentagon futures say as a foregone conclusion but the globalist of creative society where they
[04:26.200 --> 04:31.120]  want that to happen and then there's this attitude of okay let it all collapse but when it all
[04:31.120 --> 04:37.000]  collapses people aren't going to really think that there's this decadent attitude of just let
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.720]  the devil take it but once the devil takes it you're not going to like it so I think I should
[04:41.720 --> 04:46.360]  open the phones up today for first-time callers and ask what do you think the next year the next
[04:46.360 --> 04:51.640]  decade the next 50 years holds looking out in the future give us your futurist perspective I

[08:45.920 --> 08:53.200]  much for joining us on this monday the fifth day of may 2014 edition here's what's going
[08:53.200 --> 08:59.280]  to happen i want to talk about the big picture not just the i don't know 35 plus people killed
[08:59.280 --> 09:06.720]  in one day this weekend in ukraine mainly by pro western pro eu pro george soros forces
[09:07.600 --> 09:13.280]  more helicopters shut shot down obviously by russian forces the civil war that is starting
[09:13.280 --> 09:19.920]  over there by design obviously when you talk about the stock market decline how it bounces up and
[09:19.920 --> 09:26.000]  down but overall is declining when you add in devaluation of the currency and all the other
[09:26.000 --> 09:34.080]  cooked numbers on unemployment inflation you name it we've got the evolution towards tyranny
[09:34.080 --> 09:40.160]  in the public schools where children in their own free reading time or at the library are not allowed
[09:40.160 --> 09:50.160]  to read the bible but can read the satanic bible clear backpacks distributed to franklin regional
[09:50.160 --> 09:55.920]  students because you're all criminals we have to know what you have in your bag criminal until
[09:55.920 --> 10:01.360]  proven slave not guilty until proven innocent not innocent until proven guilty as it previously was
[10:01.360 --> 10:05.440]  first it's innocent until proven guilty then guilty until proven innocent now guilty until
[10:05.440 --> 10:11.280]  proven slave guilty until property of the state guilty until dominated by tyranny
[10:12.320 --> 10:17.760]  florida teacher banned bible from free reading time in class and then it ties into articles
[10:17.760 --> 10:23.440]  like this one too big to audit large partnerships escape ira scrutiny gao reports that's because
[10:23.440 --> 10:29.760]  the last 20 years in phases they've gotten rid of almost all of the irs investigators for billionaires
[10:29.760 --> 10:37.600]  and multinationals because the billionaires and multinationals lobbied to have enforcement against
[10:37.600 --> 10:43.040]  them shut off and people say well alex i thought the irs is criminal it is criminal it's a collection
[10:43.040 --> 10:50.000]  agency for the private fellow reserve but if you had fair enforcement of the of the fraudulent tax
[10:50.000 --> 10:55.120]  then the elite wouldn't always be lobbying for higher taxes because they're exempt from them
[10:55.120 --> 11:00.000]  and they get your money in corporate welfare and government contracts and no bid contracts that's
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.920]  why all the big billionaires except for the coke brothers and a few others that's why their demon
[11:05.920 --> 11:11.360]  eyes and attacked i'm not saying they're angels either they just don't lobby for that they do
[11:11.360 --> 11:16.640]  lobby for their other interest that's why all the major billionaires except for maybe
[11:16.640 --> 11:26.480]  peter thiel who's bilderberg and mark cuban who's a billionaire more liberal but at least
[11:26.480 --> 11:32.560]  more libertarian liberal and just a handful of others there's there's hardly no one out there
[11:32.560 --> 11:39.680]  who isn't a multi-billionaire who doesn't lobby for higher taxes because if they don't the globalists
[11:39.680 --> 11:45.840]  come after them and try to shut them down because warren buffett and david Rockefeller and all of
[11:45.840 --> 11:52.000]  them and Henry Kissinger and the big british and dutch royal companies their their wealth is a state
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.160]  secret the british and dutch royalty their cousins and i don't mean to digress off into this i got
[11:56.160 --> 12:00.960]  stacks of news it's just too big to audit large partnerships escape iris scrutiny gao report
[12:03.120 --> 12:07.040]  confirms and it goes on to break it all down cns news
[12:09.440 --> 12:14.480]  this is the issue that we're talking about ladies and gentlemen there's some good news on the free
[12:14.480 --> 12:19.600]  speech front high court ruling favors prayer at council meetings the supreme court said monday
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.160]  that prayers that open the town council meetings do not violate the constitution if they routinely
[12:25.200 --> 12:29.120]  even if they routinely stress christianity well you know why because it's an elected council
[12:29.760 --> 12:34.880]  and they reflect the will of the people the court said five four decisions the content of prayers
[12:34.880 --> 12:39.600]  is not significant as long as officials make a good faith effort and inclusion that's right you
[12:39.600 --> 12:44.720]  can't say no muslims are allowed here or no atheist an atheist can come forward their three-minute
[12:44.720 --> 12:49.920]  communication and they can say i hate god or don't believe in god or blah blah blah and a muslim can
[12:49.920 --> 12:56.480]  come forward and say i believe that you know allah is god and mohammed is his prophet and christian
[12:56.480 --> 13:00.880]  can come forward and say i believe in jesus christ the son of god or you can walk forward and say i
[13:00.880 --> 13:06.480]  like milk for three minutes and talk about how a big frosty delicious ice cold cup of milk is
[13:06.480 --> 13:11.600]  so good at midnight with the cookies but not good for your waistline you can walk up there and talk

[13:15.200 --> 13:22.320]  want under free speech and folks separation of church and state under thomas jefferson who i agree
[13:22.320 --> 13:27.360]  with says the state cannot make an official religion that's the first amendment they've turned
[13:27.360 --> 13:37.200]  that into the state runs religion and controls what you can say and what you can do now what you
[13:37.200 --> 13:43.440]  don't want is a public school officially saying you've got to recite the bible and and and recite it
[13:43.440 --> 13:48.720]  as if you know saying you accept it but that's not happening under common core all over the country
[13:48.720 --> 13:56.400]  they are making children recite the quran and making them pray to allah and bow to allah
[13:57.280 --> 14:02.240]  and this is just done as a litmus test to see can we do anything we want with these
[14:02.240 --> 14:06.720]  kids and will the parents accept it force the nocculations abortions without parental consent
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.640]  print you know taking down the american flag on on the week of synco demia because it's offensive
[14:12.640 --> 14:18.880]  uh illegals pulling it down from flag bulls all over the country uh this is all meant to test you
[14:18.880 --> 14:24.480]  and see what they can get you to go along with now that said the first thing i want to get to
[14:24.480 --> 14:31.760]  is a report out of cbs news it's up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[14:31.760 --> 14:43.840]  com and here is the headline students say it's illegal to wear an american flag on
[14:43.840 --> 14:49.040]  synco demia in response tea party groups plan to protest and and you know what i want my reporters
[14:49.040 --> 14:52.480]  today we were back they're having a meeting about what should the reporters go out and do

[14:57.280 --> 15:02.240]  they want to go i think i'm gonna just tell them to go out i want to don salazar and kit daniels and
[15:02.240 --> 15:09.440]  curtain emo to go out today and report on different synco demia events and my issue is if there was a
[15:10.480 --> 15:16.240]  mayflower day let's say hypothetically and only white people were allowed at it
[15:17.120 --> 15:22.880]  and and and if they called it the race if there was a mayflower day called the race in english
[15:22.880 --> 15:28.720]  i would send my crew out right now if the cougars clan ever comes to austin texas we've done this
[15:28.720 --> 15:33.760]  literally more than 15 times i don't know it's more than 15 but next time the clan comes we
[15:33.760 --> 15:39.120]  will send our reporters out to show what they're doing and to show they have the first limit right
[15:39.120 --> 15:43.440]  to do what they do but that they are just a total joke and then we'll also show their leaders and
[15:43.440 --> 15:48.080]  point out that usually they're feds meant to create racial division same thing i want my
[15:48.080 --> 15:53.920]  reporters to go out to synco demia and ask people about what do you think of mecha and la raza
[15:55.920 --> 16:04.080]  mecha says uh you in their creed in spanish that it is for the supremacy of the god race
[16:05.200 --> 16:14.160]  and it translates to the holy god race of uh chicanos look it up now la raza their creed is
[16:14.160 --> 16:19.680]  for those in the race everything for those outside the race nothing that is the official
[16:19.680 --> 16:28.320]  sponsored by the fortune 500 miller beer for gm bank of america wells fargo for those in the
[16:28.320 --> 16:32.480]  race everything for those outside the race nothing i'm gonna say that again for those in
[16:32.480 --> 16:38.400]  the race everything for those outside the race nothing so i want sergeant biggs staff sergeant

[16:43.280 --> 16:49.920]  go out and say what do you think of the official la raza that's the biggest hispanic group in the
[16:49.920 --> 16:56.160]  country next to lulac and lulac's pretty much the same and and and say why does the system want
[16:56.160 --> 17:02.560]  to make hispanics totally racial and anti black or white and just call it out and say do you know
[17:02.560 --> 17:07.680]  the ford foundation i've done this myself probably 10 times over the years the ford foundation for
[17:07.680 --> 17:14.400]  50 years has been funding this liberation theology so that americans don't basically merge together
[17:14.400 --> 17:19.120]  under american culture a bill of rights constitution declaration of independence we've now gotten to
[17:19.120 --> 17:26.400]  the point where the american flag is so offensive in phoenix and so offensive in san francisco
[17:26.400 --> 17:32.000]  and so offensive in garland texas that illegals have gone and pulled down american flags from
[17:32.000 --> 17:38.560]  gas stations and from post offices and from federal buildings and no one stops them
[17:40.800 --> 17:45.280]  the american flag is so offensive and look i know the american flag has been made to symbolize
[17:45.280 --> 17:49.520]  global empire and corruption but but then he can also symbolize second amendment private property
[17:49.520 --> 17:53.520]  rights the good things about it that made america great america's never been perfect but compared
[17:53.520 --> 17:58.720]  to other countries folks go visit them a lot less freedom now we've become unfree on all the major
[17:58.720 --> 18:06.080]  economic religious uh you name it indexes we used to be number one we're way down the list
[18:06.080 --> 18:12.720]  number 2030 you name it 40 60 you know education you name it highest in cancer highest in obesity
[18:12.720 --> 18:19.040]  highest in low iqs we've reversed our position as number one in the 1950s and 40s and 30s and
[18:19.040 --> 18:24.560]  before that americas really were exceptional we really were exceptionally evil and exceptionally
[18:24.560 --> 18:29.120]  good we were very exceptional people i don't care what color you were we came her through adversity
[18:29.120 --> 18:36.560]  this was a swashbuckling freebooting wild nation and when humans are faced adversity
[18:36.560 --> 18:43.280]  that makes men prosperity makes monsters our prosperity though made us monsters so now we're
[18:43.280 --> 18:50.240]  going into a decadent cycle and we're going to come back and play the clips of the again most
[18:50.240 --> 18:55.680]  Hispanics i know are not anti-america anti-white anti-black this is something being force fed
[18:56.880 --> 19:02.000]  by the prostitute collaborative media with the globalist this is something being sold because
[19:02.000 --> 19:08.560]  they want us all divided or the globalists cannot get what they want through wells fargo again
[19:10.720 --> 19:17.920]  orders american flags removed from inside their branches that's mainstream news folks i mean this
[19:17.920 --> 19:23.440]  is this is the total override where they say american culture is not allowed because vestigially
[19:23.440 --> 19:29.360]  what it stands for but every other thing every other culture can and then it's not even hispanic
[19:29.360 --> 19:36.800]  culture hispanic culture is pro family pro right to self-defense pro realm um male role models it's

[24:55.360 --> 25:01.440]  kids have got to take all the shots when there is no law imagine living in a country where our
[25:01.440 --> 25:08.560]  government with nato overthrows an elected government installs it and obama came out last
[25:08.560 --> 25:14.320]  friday and called it a duly elected government in fact will you guys find that clip it was over
[25:14.320 --> 25:20.880]  the weekend i forgot about it i saw the clip in paul watson's report duly elected regardless let's
[25:20.880 --> 25:26.960]  say you hate russians hate putin you believe they're the devil the antichrist that government in
[25:26.960 --> 25:36.640]  ukraine is not elected that's the level of crazy town obama calls coup government in Kiev duly

[25:44.960 --> 25:51.520]  the country games basically beat up kids that wear american flags and if you follow what happened in
[25:51.520 --> 25:58.960]  san francisco in other areas it was hispanic kids that wanted to have the american flag by the way
[25:58.960 --> 26:07.760]  hispanics in almost every state under the age of about 10 last time i saw the numbers are the majority
[26:09.120 --> 26:14.400]  why don't you just want to inherit the second amendment and private property
[26:14.400 --> 26:20.960]  well you do actually most hispanics do so they wear the american flag and then the folks that
[26:20.960 --> 26:26.000]  have got the mexico tattoos all over them and the mexican license plates and the mexican
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.720]  stickers everywhere that they're very nationalistic and it's like a football team and they're like
[26:30.720 --> 26:36.320]  listen you're not gonna wear that american flag so it becomes almost a gang issue that if you
[26:36.320 --> 26:42.000]  want to identify as an american see i used to really get annoyed by the american flag because
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.840]  i knew what it really symbolized but i knew now it symbolized kind of fascism but then i understood
[26:45.840 --> 26:52.080]  instead of not having the american flag i'm going to take the american flag back i'm going to use it
[26:52.080 --> 26:57.440]  to promote the ideas of liberty that it was originally formed for and never truly achieved
[26:57.440 --> 27:02.000]  but at least tried better than the other country it has other than say switzerland
[27:02.800 --> 27:07.280]  and so we're retaking the american flag we're using the american flag for what it was meant to
[27:07.280 --> 27:13.440]  be used for but if we will allow the globalists and the ford foundation and the carneghi endowment
[27:13.440 --> 27:18.720]  and the different globalist think tanks they're not left-wing they call themselves left-wing
[27:18.720 --> 27:24.320]  that's cover these fascist think tanks if we'll let them ban the bible ban the american flag
[27:25.120 --> 27:29.360]  judges say i don't want to hear about the constitution in my courtroom this is a revolution
[27:29.360 --> 27:34.480]  against our rights hey i'm gonna tell you something right now if mexico had a better
[27:34.480 --> 27:40.000]  constitution and bill of rights if mexico had better private property rules if mexico was a
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.520]  freer country i would live in mexico it's not that i don't want brown people around me
[27:45.520 --> 27:53.200]  it's that i don't want people from a collapsed third world country coming here brainwash that
[27:53.200 --> 27:58.240]  america belongs to them and they deserve welfare and for their race everything those outside the
[27:58.240 --> 28:07.280]  race nothing if this racism catches on they've done studies where it's 11 to 1 pro socialist
[28:07.280 --> 28:13.440]  rhetoric on spanish television and print media here in the u.s i mean it's anti gun it's anti
[28:13.440 --> 28:22.000]  family it's anti father it's anti hispanic culture that is spanish culture
[28:24.800 --> 28:30.560]  it is absolutely to destroy hispanics and everybody else along with them just like the
[28:30.560 --> 28:35.840]  garden still shots like i want one of our reporters to go out with the article that all girls 11
[28:35.840 --> 28:41.760]  years old in mexico are to be forced they actually have a tyrannical law in mexico not here they lie
[28:41.760 --> 28:47.440]  and say it's the law here rick berry did in mexico they have a law in place for three years to give
[28:47.440 --> 28:52.000]  every girl in mexico a garden still shot i want maybe jacari jackson to ask that question or don
[28:52.000 --> 28:59.280]  salazar hey why doesn't metcha those that say and and la raza for those inside the race everything
[28:59.280 --> 29:12.240]  for those outside the race nothing why don't they this is very important why don't they lobby
[29:12.240 --> 29:16.720]  against giving the garden still shot which sterilizes and destroys the ovaries and causes
[29:16.720 --> 29:20.640]  autoimmune disorders and we knew eight years ago when it got approved that was what it was being
[29:20.640 --> 29:26.080]  approved for it had to have governmental involvement for waivers just to get approved
[29:26.080 --> 29:30.880]  because it was so deadly i mean i thought you're for your race because i'm in the human race that's
[29:30.880 --> 29:37.120]  what i'm for that's why i don't want you sterilized but see the folks telling you about race all day
[29:37.120 --> 29:40.960]  they're not going to tell you that you're being aborted you're being sterilized see so i want to
[29:40.960 --> 29:46.080]  ask those questions see for those inside the race everything for those outside the race nothing
[29:46.640 --> 29:52.560]  but see i see it as the human race not as the hispanic race we're on the march the empires on

[34:52.400 --> 34:59.840]  and we have video of it and became national news and it's in my film uh battle for the republic
[34:59.840 --> 35:07.600]  an extra short film i made it's on the film in game dvd where we show the shirts that say the plan of
[35:07.600 --> 35:14.240]  san diego that is to kill all gringos or all whites according to skin color not even surname
[35:14.800 --> 35:20.800]  above the age of 16 the german government actually financed that during world war one the attacks
[35:20.800 --> 35:26.480]  were launched in south texas uh you can look that up yourself actually the attacks were
[35:26.480 --> 35:33.120]  launched in the big bend area uh and other areas uh on the texas border and you're like that the
[35:33.120 --> 35:40.000]  germans are white well the germans actually ran mexico for a while the austrian-hungarian empire
[35:40.000 --> 35:46.320]  and they sent over one of their princes to run it and show uh there's an exception for germans
[35:46.320 --> 35:51.680]  the railroads in mexico got built by germans the beer that's what dosekis was a german brewer
[35:51.680 --> 35:55.200]  that came there and made it and that's why it's a german beer basically german lager
[35:56.240 --> 36:01.120]  tastes pretty good too but the whole point is is that there's a major german influence
[36:01.120 --> 36:07.840]  in mexico that is exempted from all of the kill the white people stuff um that's why you'll see a
[36:07.840 --> 36:14.080]  lot of people from mexico with german first names like adal for alos or things like that
[36:14.880 --> 36:21.440]  see i happen to know about the cultures i've studied it and again i'm sitting here watching
[36:21.440 --> 36:28.960]  all over the country this is just some small town where you can't wear an american flag
[36:28.960 --> 36:36.480]  because people think it's so offensive so mark dice went out and uh your frequent contributor
[36:36.480 --> 36:44.240]  to infoworks.com mark dice media critic went out and asked obama supporters if is not liking
[36:44.240 --> 36:49.920]  mexican food racist and i've told the story probably 20 times since last year when i was at
[36:49.920 --> 36:54.400]  martin springs and saw two hispanics and a white guy who were obviously stoned out of their minds
[36:54.400 --> 36:58.960]  and you can tell when somebody's been smoking a bunch of weed laughing and giggling and wrestling
[36:58.960 --> 37:04.640]  around in the water and i'm laying on the grass like 15 feet away and you're like man i want some
[37:04.640 --> 37:09.200]  chinese food let's go up with that and they go and the one hispanic and white guy to the other
[37:09.200 --> 37:18.160]  hispanic goes shh that's racist so for the general public just talking is now racist
[37:18.160 --> 37:25.200]  knowledge is racist having an opinion is racist discriminating and saying i don't
[37:25.200 --> 37:29.840]  like the tsa grabbing my testicles that's a discrimination discriminating that you like
[37:29.840 --> 37:39.040]  this brand of hotdog rather than this other brand now all forms of discrimination or
[37:39.040 --> 37:45.040]  being discerning is now bad you do what the media says as it changes day to day you'll be
[37:45.040 --> 37:50.000]  politically correct you'll be safe but if you do anything
[37:53.840 --> 37:58.880]  including knowing how to read a book it's like idiocracy look with you know this guy can read
[37:58.880 --> 38:04.320]  aha we can't trust him it's weird to be informed it's bad to be informed
[38:06.640 --> 38:12.240]  and this is the plan bring in predominantly latin american population that has a beef with
[38:12.240 --> 38:18.480]  our government that's done a lot of bad stuff in latin america blame that on the american people
[38:18.480 --> 38:26.720]  make every source of evil be anglo in nature the anglos then respond by being guilty and and self

[39:55.440 --> 40:02.480]  like walmart encourages their employees to have pay so low they duly qualify to go on welfare
[40:03.040 --> 40:08.640]  and obama said last year he said hey go on obama care get your hours cut from 40 down to 30

[40:22.240 --> 40:29.440]  is the domestication so china is meant to deindustrialize our country with wages and and conditions
[40:29.440 --> 40:37.680]  that we can't compete with mexico brings in a population that we can't compete with because of
[40:37.680 --> 40:44.080]  the government kickbacks the government systems and we can't compete because our power plants are
[40:44.080 --> 40:50.400]  being shut down now there it is biz pack review media advises people to work less to get obama

[41:18.400 --> 41:24.480]  very very soon that's why the government's setting up currency controls domestic controls where you
[41:24.480 --> 41:28.800]  can't get out of the country with your money even after tax or where they can claw it back out of
[41:28.800 --> 41:35.200]  luxembourg the bahamas or switzerland not money you took that didn't have taxes on it the money you
[41:35.200 --> 41:45.200]  pay tax on they're saying we own all that money new article just went up on info wars dot com
[41:45.200 --> 41:50.160]  patriot group protesting of the mile ban on american flag t-shirts first of all an organization
[41:50.160 --> 41:57.200]  characterized as racist that's right folks showing up black people hispanic white you name it with
[41:57.200 --> 42:06.560]  american flags is racist according to nbc that just broke and i want my reporters to go and i told him

[42:11.440 --> 42:17.280]  ask people maybe buy a bunch of little ones at the five and nine store or ever go out and ask people

[42:30.560 --> 42:35.920]  and again again folks i'd like to have single demyel be a holiday i'd like to feel like i was
[42:35.920 --> 42:39.760]  welcome at a lot of these things and i'm not saying there aren't some of these single demyel events
[42:39.760 --> 42:45.360]  that you're welcome at but let me tell you it's a racial cultural event that is now decidedly
[42:45.360 --> 42:52.720]  not about overthrowing spain or mexico getting independence it's now about hating gringos and
[42:52.720 --> 42:58.080]  let's just be honest about that get it out on the table because it's not racist for me to point out
[42:58.080 --> 43:02.720]  that that's going on we're grabbing that video right now that just went live at info wars dot
[43:02.720 --> 43:09.920]  com that we just tweeted at real alex jones so here is mark dice's report i want to play this
[43:09.920 --> 43:15.920]  from the start but but there's a juicy part where people say it's racist that joe biden doesn't like
[43:15.920 --> 43:21.520]  mexican food and i'll tell you what's what what it is that joe biden doesn't like mexican food
[43:21.520 --> 43:28.240]  there's nothing wrong with him he's a yankee and folks up north didn't grope around a lot of spices
[43:28.240 --> 43:35.760]  so it tastes bad to him and i love yankees great people i love people from california too as long
[43:35.760 --> 43:40.240]  as they don't want my guns i love people from mexico as long as you don't want to force inoculate me
[43:41.200 --> 43:45.200]  and make me take my kids take gardens those shots so they get sterilized as long as you
[43:45.200 --> 43:49.280]  don't want me to drink fluoride listen i want you to have guns i don't care if you're black white
[43:49.280 --> 43:55.600]  hispanic who you are i want you to have guns and private property and raise your family and be free
[43:55.600 --> 44:01.440]  and be red-blooded and be manly and be feminine and and all the traditional role models that are
[44:01.440 --> 44:08.080]  under attack scientifically we're being overwritten with this false culture but if you don't like
[44:09.600 --> 44:14.400]  me because i'm white i have no guilt and i'm not going to kiss your butt and it's not some weird
[44:14.400 --> 44:19.520]  economic advantage i'm not in a gang where i want to be part of the white gang or i want to be part
[44:19.520 --> 44:24.960]  of the country club gang or i want to be i mean imagine wanting to be with the government gang
[44:24.960 --> 44:29.760]  because they give you tax exemptions and some some handouts and the government tells you
[44:29.760 --> 44:36.640]  you're hispanic you're you are the god race you are the you know the that's that's mecha
[44:38.400 --> 44:42.800]  if you quote it from spanish especially the divine god race we have the former mayor gust
[44:42.800 --> 44:49.040]  garcia somewhere around here actually doing a city proclamation the hispanics are the supreme race
[44:49.040 --> 44:56.480]  you think i'm joking i think it's on youtube and again i don't even get into the subject till i see
[44:56.480 --> 45:01.680]  stuff like this and then you got met mecha but then you got la raza for those in the race everything
[45:01.680 --> 45:06.320]  for those outside the race nothing this is outrageous so here's mark dice's report it's up on
[45:06.320 --> 45:11.600]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot com what do you think about these republicans their racist
[45:11.600 --> 45:16.400]  statements john bainer said that he doesn't like mexican food should we tolerate such bigotry no
[45:16.400 --> 45:21.440]  no do you think maybe we should push i mean he should be pushed out of congress for such racist
[45:21.440 --> 45:27.120]  statements well i think people in his district should consider voting for somebody else have
[45:27.120 --> 45:30.400]  you heard these racist comments from john bainer that he doesn't like mexican food
[45:31.040 --> 45:36.880]  no i haven't should we tolerate something like that in today's society such bigotry in the congress
[45:36.880 --> 45:40.640]  i wouldn't say so i think we should tolerate that bigotry or do you think maybe he should
[45:40.640 --> 45:46.880]  resign from office for making such racist comment comments oh i think he should resign he should
[45:46.880 --> 45:53.200]  resign yeah it's enough for him enough of him not liking mexican we like to try new yeah we need
[45:53.200 --> 45:59.120]  a speaker who likes mexican food right yeah sometimes we need to change do you support obama's
[45:59.120 --> 46:03.600]  calling for john bainer to step down over his racist comments about not liking mexican food
[46:04.320 --> 46:09.200]  made on sicko de maio of all days i don't i don't that kind of racism be tolerated today i don't i
[46:09.200 --> 46:13.360]  don't i don't really think so i don't i don't think that kind of racist he should definitely step
[46:13.360 --> 46:17.920]  down what what is he talking about not liking mexican food that's an obvious thing you know we
[46:17.920 --> 46:21.120]  can't have a speaker the house that doesn't eat mexican food he's obviously a racist he should get
[46:21.120 --> 46:24.640]  out of there anyway we should get out we should support obama's decision especially when everybody
[46:24.640 --> 46:31.120]  likes it so i mean so you would agree with obama that that's a coded racist term on sicko de maio
[46:31.120 --> 46:37.680]  nonetheless anybody that still thinks racist man turned to dark ages still yeah you're not eating
[46:37.680 --> 46:43.840]  mexican food in the middle order period man you are a racist you're yeah your taste buds are racist
[46:43.840 --> 46:48.160]  they'll make races no matter what man if you're if you're part of back in the ages you're gonna make
[46:48.160 --> 46:52.560]  racist comments no matter what on sicko de maio saying he doesn't eat any mexican food of all
[46:52.560 --> 46:57.040]  the days what an insult to the mexican people for obama's decision to have bainer step down or
[46:57.040 --> 47:02.320]  maybe be be you know punished for for making racist comments about not eating mexican food on
[47:02.320 --> 47:09.200]  sicko de maio i think that a stand should he should take a stand and he should take it swiftly so
[47:10.080 --> 47:17.280]  um as soon as just get bainer out get that racist just get it get the person out and then make an
[47:17.280 --> 47:22.800]  example of it and then that way he's at least taking a step towards eliminating those comments
[47:22.800 --> 47:28.400]  in the future from people that may feel like like they want to say something like that the full video
[47:28.400 --> 47:33.440]  is up on info wars.com and i usually watch these clips beforehand i hadn't watched the clips i was
[47:33.440 --> 47:38.640]  told it was uh biden that had said that but it was bainer i remember hearing something about that
[47:38.640 --> 47:44.400]  from biden maybe he responded to it the point is obviously most people i know from up north come down
[47:44.400 --> 47:51.920]  here and they say i'll eat anywhere just not mexican food in fact we had a black guy from up north
[47:51.920 --> 47:55.840]  down here who it was a big liberal and he didn't want to eat mexican food and it's because people
[47:55.840 --> 48:04.560]  from up north are scared of hot things it has nothing to do with the fact that mexicans are
[48:04.560 --> 48:09.840]  the ones cooking it in fact pretty much all i eat is mexican food that's where i got my beautiful
[48:09.840 --> 48:16.720]  figure as that means i'm racist is all i want is mexican food and i think the senior readers are
[48:16.720 --> 48:23.360]  very pretty i mean again it's about being obsessed about do you not like mexican food well meanwhile
[48:23.360 --> 48:28.720]  the banks are tax exempt and running narcotics publicly and laundering the money and owning
[48:28.720 --> 48:35.200]  the aircraft bloomberg ap all this is going on and we've got people with straight faces going yeah
[48:35.200 --> 48:38.400]  get the speaker of the house out because he doesn't like that
[48:42.000 --> 48:47.840]  i mean literally i've now noticed when you're around trendies they're so dumb down that if you
[48:47.840 --> 48:54.240]  just say hey let's go get mexican food they think the word mexican people will look at you chinese
[48:54.240 --> 49:00.240]  huh mexican huh white huh everyone's looking for the fabled boogie man because these are
[49:00.240 --> 49:04.400]  uncomfortable people brought up in front of television that don't have social skills black
[49:04.400 --> 49:08.720]  white i don't care what color they are while everything's being robbed where a whole world's
[49:08.720 --> 49:16.800]  being screwed over by tyrants we are now totally obsessed with all this race garbage just like the
[49:16.800 --> 49:24.960]  globalists can play catholic off against orthodox in ukraine the globalists will look for a difference
[49:24.960 --> 49:30.960]  and they will use that difference as a way to come in and screw everybody who loses the russian
[49:30.960 --> 49:38.240]  ukranians or the western ukranians from this crisis they all lose who gains nato george
[49:38.240 --> 49:44.320]  soros from the billions in bailout money the globalist and putin will win his approval

[49:51.760 --> 49:56.320]  out of real racism being stirred up in the name of fighting it the government that'll play the
[49:56.320 --> 50:02.480]  part of the referee and i know you know this but i want to ask a question for first time

[54:48.320 --> 54:53.520]  blame the second amendment killing thousands of people but none of the race groups like
[54:53.520 --> 54:59.680]  mecha or la raza say a word because they're openly run by the cia and the ford foundation
[55:01.040 --> 55:06.240]  this is divide and conquer imagine i keep repeating this a world where two plus two equals five is
[55:06.240 --> 55:13.360]  taught to children that's directly from 1984 imagine someone coming back from the 1960s that
[55:13.360 --> 55:21.040]  had its own evils then but that have been replaced with even more insidious twisted mind bending
[55:21.040 --> 55:27.200]  evils the old evils you could face and they were open and people recognize them now it's all hidden
[55:27.200 --> 55:34.480]  and couched and spin and propaganda and brainwashing coming up the next hour we'll play that clip

[55:57.040 --> 56:05.120]  again the reality is so sensational that i can't even come up with words to describe how insane
[56:05.120 --> 56:10.000]  that is just like the other video how dare people want to go out with american flags
[56:10.000 --> 56:15.840]  since the illegals say you shouldn't have them isn't that racist it's so violent we don't know
[56:15.840 --> 56:23.520]  said there might be violence but we're sure it's an evil white person nine times out of ten i say
[56:23.520 --> 56:29.440]  nine times out of ten i can't think of a case where a jewish center has swastikas painted on it
[56:29.440 --> 56:34.320]  where it wasn't somebody that works there doing it i can't think of a case where a black church got
[56:34.320 --> 56:38.880]  burned down that it wasn't the church members doing it i can't think of a case where a black
[56:38.880 --> 56:46.800]  uh member of a sorority didn't scratch the swastika on their own face now i can't
[56:46.800 --> 56:52.080]  think of real cases where crazy white supremacists go and shoot up jewish centers and then in every
[56:52.080 --> 56:58.080]  case buford furrow and the latest one turns out their fbi informants the last two jewish centers
[56:58.080 --> 57:04.160]  the one out in california and then the one uh that just happened a few weeks ago what was it in

[1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:48.880]  of noah and that's an important question ladies and gentlemen i want to ask you that
[1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:54.480]  where is this society going where is this culture going
[1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:02.560]  we're going to be going to your phone calls right now then i'm going to get into an article
[1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:12.720]  up on info wars dot com titled ron paul common core is really the last straw and it is a big
[1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:18.400]  article it is a detailed article and it's very hardcore the things that ron paul has to say
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:23.120]  how there's a conspiracy to dumb down our children how it's a criminal takeover and
[1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:28.400]  how common core really is the last straw and now he's striking back with his home school curriculum
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:34.720]  that i should add we have a link to uh in the story with an affiliate program we're doing
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:40.320]  with ron paul that helps fund our operation and it's free the curriculum's free through the
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:46.480]  certain grades the first grades and then you pay for the later curriculum if you choose so links
[1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:52.800]  to that free curriculum are at info wars dot com in this article we were given the link
[1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:58.800]  for the free curriculum show that we could promote this for folks and you can see the
[1:01:58.800 --> 1:02:02.320]  curriculum up at the top it's not just reading writing an arithmetic though that's the
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:11.920]  that's the core of it but liberty versus coercion and western history number one
[1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:18.560]  one how to defend the freedom philosophy what it takes for success in college how to start a home
[1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:26.480]  business uh that's the type of thing that they're teaching people in this real stuff that kids need
[1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:33.200]  real americana that the system is desperate your children not learn they want them to go take common
[1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:38.560]  core that's so confusing they lose the desire to learn and never get it instead of making learning
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:42.880]  exciting like you're supposed to in western civilization they make it as boring as they can
[1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:49.200]  to literally sabotage the culture and that's on record so you can go to info wars dot com
[1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:55.600]  in that article ron paul common core is really the last straw where dr paul breaks it all down
[1:02:55.600 --> 1:03:04.720]  it's an exclusive to info wars dot com and by the way we're so neurotic here about not airing stuff
[1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:09.760]  if people don't know it was taped that i need to reach out to ron paul it's all just in the
[1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:13.520]  communication of the great reporters you get an interview with somebody you say we're doing
[1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:19.520]  a print interview but we also want to record it to put on the radio and and and then that wasn't
[1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:25.200]  relayed so now i'm not letting the audio be heard until i can ask ron paul if he wants it to air
[1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:30.000]  you're like well why does it matter you tape it well that wasn't clear to default you say hey
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:33.760]  want to do a radio and print interview with you and then that's what you do but you don't
[1:03:33.760 --> 1:03:37.120]  you know we're going to do a print and then when it gets up you know by the way we're going to
[1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:41.280]  tape this and then ron paul's like uh the point is it's a very powerful interview i've heard it
[1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:45.360]  and so we'll see about getting that out but it's just frustrating to have something and
[1:03:45.360 --> 1:03:50.000]  then not be able to put it out but uh hell i can call ron paul up at home but i'm not going to do
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:55.040]  it and ask him uh it's just that uh it's it's constant training around here which is good
[1:03:55.760 --> 1:04:01.920]  just the defaults of the way the media works the rules in the media how it unfolds uh but it's a
[1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:07.680]  good article by kit daniels it's an excellent article and it's up on info wars store dot com
[1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:12.720]  as well you can link through and find the links to the ron paul curriculum but the link to find
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:19.680]  the free areas of the curriculum is up at info wars dot com in the article ron paul common core
[1:04:19.680 --> 1:04:24.000]  is really the last straw we're going to go to break we're going to come back go directly to
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:30.400]  erin john lewis james christian and others about what do you see the future of the world being
[1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:37.040]  just a general question and then also how insane is political correctness that la raza can mean the
[1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:44.000]  race and on cico de maio it's people waving mexican flags and and folks get very upset
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:48.560]  of an american flags i mean wells fargo it's in the news today's taking their flags down
[1:04:49.440 --> 1:04:55.440]  so should we lower all american flags and burn them and urinate on them to show we're not racist
[1:04:55.440 --> 1:05:00.880]  should we wipe our butts with american flag to prove we're not bad

[1:08:51.280 --> 1:09:00.640]  your gut level feeling all we know is how to obsess over race obsess over differences in the name of
[1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:07.760]  fighting racism i mean now we've got white players saying i didn't you know sterling didn't want to
[1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:12.400]  pay me because i was white obviously sterling hated everybody a total elitist that's what i've
[1:09:12.400 --> 1:09:22.000]  been saying the whole time just a total total out of control moron but what are we doing as a culture
[1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:29.920]  obsessing over what one old rich man said while we're all being cheated by the globalist and all
[1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:34.880]  the irs is directed to not go after rich people but to target blue collar folks they know we're
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:42.080]  scared and can't fight back los angeles clippers guard jj riddick says that owner donald sterling
[1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:46.880]  was hesitant to sign him last summer because he's white speaking to us today riddick went into
[1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:52.720]  detail about how his four-year twenty seven million dollar sign and trade deal almost fell apart
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:58.560]  despite being initially agreed upon i've been told both ways one that he didn't want to pay me
[1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:03.200]  because i was white and he didn't want to pay me because i was a bench player
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:14.880]  i mean who cares man who cares what one old racist guy is doing secretly record it oh but
[1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:19.920]  it's horrible what he said it's horrible to inject black people with syphilis nobody
[1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:26.400]  cares about that the same government that did all of that the same globalist the same criminal hydra
[1:10:26.400 --> 1:10:32.560]  group specter whatever you want to call it the same criminal group in our government and other
[1:10:32.560 --> 1:10:37.520]  major governments the globalist they write books how they run everything literally is reducing
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:43.280]  world population forcibly targeting the smartest people trying to create a hellish system and using
[1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:47.840]  entertainment to distract everyone and now people don't care about their economic rights they don't
[1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:52.080]  care about their bill of rights they don't care about their real rights they care about obsessing
[1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:57.920]  about race all day and i'm sick of it actually most people in polls are sick of it too but the media
[1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:05.280]  just keeps force feeding it but that's why obama at the correspondence dinner over the weekend had
[1:11:05.280 --> 1:11:10.320]  to make the joke that wow msnbc is here tonight this is the biggest audience you know you know
[1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:18.720]  they've had no while i mean they know that they have 500 000 viewers on their top show ladies and
[1:11:18.720 --> 1:11:23.360]  gentlemen we don't i'm not delivered to work in a limo i'm not on a power trip
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:29.840]  maybe i should be on one because people pay attention to that msnbc
[1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:37.520]  their biggest show doesn't have a third of the listeners of this radio show that's very conservative
[1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:43.840]  we get tens of millions of youtube views a week conservatively
[1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:53.520]  that's just youtube and then we're on thousands of other platforms boxy roku and we're in the top
[1:11:53.520 --> 1:12:01.040]  five to top ten usually number one on all the online tv services that are now in smart tvs
[1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:04.720]  internet hooked up televisions
[1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:14.320]  that's why they're coming in wanting to censor the internet now that's why they want to get rid
[1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:18.400]  of the old internet and force you onto their new internet too that the FCC controls with fairness
[1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:28.240]  doctrine because they cannot compete all we've got to do is realize we are the dominant group now
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:33.920]  libertarian ideas and start acting like it now that's when you talk about news we have the big
[1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:39.840]  audiences where we're being beaten is entertainment you've got people that are informed and this
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:44.720]  broadcast is extremely popular and is reaching the world when you talk about the average person
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:49.280]  out there they only watch sports entertainment and they don't even know what planet they're on
[1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:54.560]  and they could care less who ran paul is or who alex jones is or who ron paul is or who matt
[1:12:54.560 --> 1:13:00.160]  drudge is or who joseph ferry is they could they don't know anything about it and that's why i've
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:06.320]  told my crew and myself this we've got to start culture jamming and going to movie premieres
[1:13:06.320 --> 1:13:13.680]  we've got to start trying to get big celebrities on we've got to start uh covering entertainment
[1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:20.080]  and then putting our news into it as a way to get the general public upwards of 80 that don't
[1:13:20.080 --> 1:13:27.120]  even know the new world order exists they're the ones the casual viewer is who msnbc is targeting
[1:13:27.120 --> 1:13:34.560]  the casual viewer who may watch tv once a month and hears alex jones is deeply racist and was
[1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:39.120]  behind the boss in bombing for anyone informed that's like saying alex jones is from mars and
[1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:47.520]  has green skin and drinks blood it's ridiculous but to people that are casual viewers of just
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:55.200]  headlines that's why pt barnum said just spell my name right because for the general public
[1:13:55.200 --> 1:14:03.280]  all they care about is that your name is out there ed schultz has come out and said we have a clip of
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:10.640]  that that not raising minimum wage is racist yeah and not passing obama care is racist as well right
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:18.640]  by cutting working class folks time from 40 to below 30 hours that's that's very racist if you
[1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:23.840]  don't i mean it's just so ridiculous i want to play jacari jackson's report on the doj so we don't
[1:14:23.840 --> 1:14:30.320]  forget that they're targeting gun shops and gun dealers and gun manufacturers in a racketeering
[1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:35.360]  operation that i'm going right to your calls erin john lewis james christian and others but
[1:14:35.360 --> 1:14:42.080]  here is jacari jackson's report from last friday's info wars nightly news you miss every night 30
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:50.000]  minutes of reporting like this hardcore with jacari jackson leon macadoo staff sergeant joe
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:57.120]  biggs darin mcmarine david night and the all the rest of the great crew doing a fabulous job here's
[1:14:57.120 --> 1:15:04.000]  jacari's report there is often talk that only military and police should have guns that if there
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:10.560]  is an incident a man in uniform will swoop in and save you and there are plenty of good people in
[1:15:10.560 --> 1:15:17.280]  those positions but we can't ignore the blatant abuses of power that do occur such as an off-duty
[1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:22.800]  nypd member who got drunk and shot a man six times to anyone who'd point out that the man was
[1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:28.080]  off the clock at the time of the shooting i'd be quick to point out that he shot a man six times
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:32.960]  on the other side of the country a man fleeing from police was shot in the back fell down a
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:37.920]  staircase and died reports are that the man had previously been menacing with a pair of scissors
[1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:43.600]  but was unarmed when he was killed from behind moving now to texas a sheriff responding to a
[1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:49.040]  burglary killed the dog of the victim who called him apparently pepper spray wasn't a good enough
[1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:55.120]  option to keep the dog at bay and earlier this year albuquerque police killed a homeless man for
[1:15:55.120 --> 1:16:19.120]  the heinous crime of camping
[1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:33.840]  let's contrast that with responsible citizens handling firearms while they're reversing
[1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:39.280]  the lady's holding onto her purse though chasing them all the way to the middle that's when a
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:45.360]  perfect stranger intervenes you can see him there in the pt cruiser at the top of the screen and
[1:16:45.360 --> 1:16:49.440]  that good Samaritan came out and drew his weapon and scared them and then that's when he pulled
[1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:55.520]  them off the car someone snapped this picture of the man holding the two suspects at bay a few
[1:16:55.520 --> 1:17:03.600]  minutes later police arrived she heard the suspect say this he said that crazy has a gun and that's
[1:17:03.600 --> 1:17:11.200]  when i was finally down on the sidewalk and i shot it into the dirt into the grass area and and
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:18.000]  to let him know you know i've got a gun and i know how to use it with all of this in mind the
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:23.200]  department of justice is continuing their attack on the second amendment by limiting banking options
[1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:29.120]  for gun stores this in addition to the doj running guns into the hands of mexican drug cartels with
[1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:36.240]  operation fast and furious so to the good samaritans and constitutional police alike be aware
[1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:41.360]  that if the doj continues these actions virtually unchecked you may find your right to bear arms
[1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:48.080]  infringed in a way that you wouldn't expect you can find more reports at info wars dot com one thing
[1:17:48.080 --> 1:17:53.040]  that i think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive
[1:17:53.040 --> 1:17:58.400]  about this it's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a monday and then only do it every monday we
[1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:03.920]  need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns
[1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:11.280]  in a vastly different way so that's what they're doing everything they do is social engineering
[1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:16.240]  when they say your kids belong to them and two plus two equals five i keep harping on that
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:24.080]  because in 1984 written by an actual mi6 before that os s propagandist george orwell admitted
[1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:28.480]  that he put a lot of classified stuff before he died and he died one year after the book came out
[1:18:28.480 --> 1:18:35.760]  in 1948 out in 1949 to jarwell said that he put a lot of classified things in the book
[1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:42.080]  that he wouldn't have been able to put out because he worked in propaganda the character of winston
[1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:50.320]  smith is eric blair aka george arwell his pen name and you have to understand that the ability to
[1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:56.720]  say two plus two equals four is freedom and they know that so we must battle them and the fact that
[1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:01.520]  they say it's a conspiracy theory literally that you're allowed to have free will and say two plus
[1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:07.440]  two equals four you have to say whatever they want you to say and not be able to make any judgments
[1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:14.560]  that is racism having any opinion i like chocolate ice cream over vanilla i'm racist well how is it
[1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:21.280]  racist doesn't matter you're racist this is what they replace our liberty with and our reality is
[1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:28.000]  being a bunch of obsessed neurotic twits while all of our freedoms being destroyed while the global
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:34.480]  has set up a total tyranny and a global kill grid on synco de mayo you better not wear an american
[1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:39.280]  flag while i'm sending my reporters out the ones that want to do it with american flags like superman

[1:24:27.120 --> 1:24:33.200]  the socialist in europe this is how they control people they bring in outside groups the government
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:40.560]  then represents the outside groups as their client creating more division and then attaching to the
[1:24:40.560 --> 1:24:47.360]  outside group a political agenda of more control and and that if that group goes along with that

[1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:08.240]  hello how you doing i'm fine go ahead all right well i think the best way or the future would be
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:14.000]  to re-engineer your life every individual person to basically start from the beginning of you know
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:21.920]  what do we need and then stop using all the stuff that destroys our bodies and move accordingly in
[1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:29.200]  that direction i think that's it you fundamentally change the way you live your life anything the
[1:25:29.200 --> 1:25:34.880]  globalists are pushing you're against it and separately what what what does your gut tell you
[1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:43.200]  about the future of humanity oh i'm a combat that i've you know seen some stuff and i uh
[1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:49.760]  i just have a really bad feeling on how things are kind of going right now i see a buildup of force
[1:25:50.960 --> 1:25:59.760]  um i i think that some bad stuff might be might come down the pipeline i hope not i hope that we
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:05.840]  can head it off by getting involved in our local communities i mean that's probably the only way
[1:26:05.840 --> 1:26:11.280]  that we're going to be able to do anything is by people getting involved and now here we got our
[1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:18.320]  mazula mayor is involved with the mayor's against illegal guns he's part of uh michael bloomberg's
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:27.120]  high speed low drag system of uh uh the illegal gun program the myack or whatever

[1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:36.640]  i just want to say this i want to say it very calmly so as i get lost and the rest of my babble
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:46.400]  we see the military force the paramilitary force being built against us we see the manuals the
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:53.280]  memos it is for the american people this system is being built to destroy all basic freedoms and
[1:26:53.280 --> 1:27:00.480]  prosperity to make us dependent and the globalists will use the crises they've helped exacerbate
[1:27:00.480 --> 1:27:06.880]  or that they've created and then pose the saviors and use that to get even more power that's the
[1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:12.000]  thing people now see all this stuff unfolding they go well you know we're in a bad situation they
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:17.360]  have to do that they engineered it on record things get worse under the new world order
[1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:26.640]  they are the fount or the source of most of the problems
[1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:32.960]  and a lot of top professors are saying that and economists that the governing class
[1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:38.080]  lives off crisis and lives off destabilization because they don't make anything they don't
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:43.600]  lead by being superior they lead by cheating and playing games and rigging things
[1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:49.440]  they've even got senators admitting this now and they're going to keep cheating till we're all
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:57.760]  bankrupt folks they go or we go it's us or them john and ohio you're on the air go ahead
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:05.840]  hi alec long time listener thanks for calling yeah you know i would say i think it's through
[1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:11.440]  our kids you know my kids come home from school time with the rhetoric that they teach them in
[1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:18.400]  school about race and homosexuality and stuff like that you can't even get a fight in the school to
[1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:24.800]  defend yourself today without both kids being suspended no no i have seen it at swim team
[1:28:25.440 --> 1:28:30.400]  where a boy beats up one of my daughters who's two years older and if the daughter fights back
[1:28:31.360 --> 1:28:34.880]  she gets in trouble it's not the swim team's even bad they're following the quote rules
[1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:43.040]  fighting back is the ultimate sin go ahead yeah i i agree and it drives me crazy so i try to i try
[1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:49.360]  to teach my kids you know at home to counteract all the crap they hear in the school system
[1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:58.400]  it's amazing how they also demonize parents in the school system now and i feel sorry folks are
[1:28:58.400 --> 1:29:01.040]  working too hard they got to put your kids in public school most of the time because people
[1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:06.400]  pay property tax or they pay it through their rent the owner so they jack up your rent because
[1:29:06.400 --> 1:29:11.280]  the property tax so many people go i don't care about property tax i don't pay it everyone pays
[1:29:11.280 --> 1:29:20.800]  property tax folks you pay it through the rent cost and they force us through that tax to be so
[1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:27.520]  poor we have to put them in their system it's a diabolical plan anything else so john uh no thank

[1:34:54.960 --> 1:35:01.040]  free market stuff that ron paul teaches liberty versus coercion and western history how to defend
[1:35:01.040 --> 1:35:07.760]  the freedom philosophy what it takes for success in college how to start a home business from dr
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:13.680]  ron paul who put himself through college and all the rest of it and from a guy who volunteered
[1:35:13.680 --> 1:35:19.520]  three days a week to give free health care at hospitals that's the kind of stuff ron paul did
[1:35:19.520 --> 1:35:25.760]  that's what doctors used to do uh my dad's grandfather was a doctor and did about half
[1:35:25.760 --> 1:35:36.160]  of his health care free and that's what was taught was that you went and gave health care for free
[1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:41.120]  poor people just didn't pay and then if you needed like a prosthesis or something special
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:45.600]  the local churches collected the money well no the local churches are busy being glitter bugs
[1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:51.760]  right now trying to build a bigger facility and to tell you to worship government they're too busy

[1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:26.320]  evil the globalists are and that you're fighting for your life do not thank me for fighting for my
[1:40:26.320 --> 1:40:33.680]  life I am fighting for my life whether you don't know it yet or not the globalist are pure evil
[1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:40.000]  we are fighting for our lives ladies and gentlemen and I know the system is all encompassing and
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:45.680]  it is tied into every level of society and it's overwhelming but just knowing it's there
[1:40:45.680 --> 1:40:51.920]  admitting it's there it's empowering to say I'm not perfect but I'm going to do every little thing
[1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:57.120]  I can to be human and to be honorable and to treat people like I want to be treated and to
[1:40:57.120 --> 1:41:03.200]  follow the golden rule but also to stand up against evil when it rears its head
[1:41:03.200 --> 1:41:11.040]  and just say God I'm weak you know that you made me you know I have the depths of evil in me but
[1:41:11.040 --> 1:41:17.200]  also the heights of of creativity and everything you you made me to be and if it's your will that
[1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:23.200]  I'm going to survive this that's your will but all I want to be is a vessel to be thrown against the
[1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:33.840]  enemy I turn myself over to you completely that's all I can do I'm small and I'm weak but I'm strong

[1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:02.480]  and you're not going to find this in most these churches ladies and gentlemen there are some
[1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:08.480]  good ones out there in fact I've met a preacher repeatedly that's friends along one of my friends
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:13.040]  who is definitely the real deal and I want to start trying to go to his church I don't want to
[1:42:13.040 --> 1:42:19.760]  announce the church then make it like a scene but the whole point is is that this is real ladies
[1:42:19.760 --> 1:42:26.080]  and gentlemen when you realize that we are in Mordor this is not a game that's why it's it's
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:32.240]  just stop thanking me now I mean I don't even have the skill to update info wars and make it look
[1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:36.160]  like a modern good website I don't have the skill to even launch my nightly new show I don't even
[1:42:36.160 --> 1:42:42.480]  have the skill to do all things I want I literally literally cannot stand myself and I'm not saying
[1:42:42.480 --> 1:42:47.440]  this to make you feel sorry for me I'm I got to be honest with you I cannot stand how I sound on the
[1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:53.360]  air I cannot stand this radio show all I want to do is defeat the new old order and I'm weak and
[1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:58.400]  can't do it and I know there are those of you out there that feel like this as well I mean you just
[1:42:58.400 --> 1:43:05.680]  yeah it's overwhelming I know I need R&R I know I need to have a good time so that I'm relaxed
[1:43:06.480 --> 1:43:11.200]  but at the same time I can't even do that anymore and I just
[1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:17.440]  I need to take a sabbatical I really realize that I need to like
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:21.920]  literally go camping for a month or something and just turn off everything and get away from
[1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:28.080]  everything because I'm not even stressed out at this point it's just the evil is so obvious and
[1:43:28.080 --> 1:43:33.360]  so ridiculous I don't want to fight with the military I don't want to fight with the police
[1:43:33.360 --> 1:43:38.720]  I don't want to fight with the new world order but the new world order at the top is pure evil
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:43.040]  all their minions aren't even really evil that's what's so sick about it they're
[1:43:43.040 --> 1:43:47.280]  forgiven they don't know what they do it's like Christ is on the cross forgive them father they
[1:43:47.280 --> 1:43:52.480]  know not what they do now that I have deeper knowledge of things the public is so stupid and
[1:43:52.480 --> 1:44:04.640]  so pathetic and so dumb I mean how do you teach these people basics the whole government should be
[1:44:04.640 --> 1:44:10.720]  overthrown today that they teach kids two plus two equals five I know I just they teach kids
[1:44:10.720 --> 1:44:19.120]  two plus two equals five they teach our children two plus two equals five I mean these people
[1:44:19.120 --> 1:44:35.040]  are the abomination desolation I mean they are anathema they are absolute garbage
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  and then I realize this is going to get 10 times worse the bottom is falling out of the civilization
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:48.880]  and now I know it's all going to collapse nobody's going to stop that
[1:44:52.160 --> 1:44:56.800]  and I can't even keep my personal world going straight I'm not judging anybody
[1:44:58.960 --> 1:45:07.120]  there's a spirit of delusion a spirit of narcissistic evil
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:16.400]  and you can see it this civilization is rotten is corrupt and is weak and it's going to go down
[1:45:17.440 --> 1:45:22.480]  and the globalists intend to write it all the way down by design and grease the skids of writing
[1:45:22.480 --> 1:45:28.240]  it down and they're going to take in a greater evil on the other side of it and my god that's the
[1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:35.360]  answer we've got to have a crash landing that a good society comes out of not a technocracy
[1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:42.960]  that makes hell look tame I'm not demonizing the new world order it is a demon
[1:45:48.320 --> 1:45:54.240]  our civilization is broken by design and is going straight into the arms of pure evil
[1:45:54.240 --> 1:45:57.680]  I'm going to stop repeating the same thing over and over again go to your calls I apologize
[1:45:57.680 --> 1:46:03.360]  Lewis in Florida where do you see the world going thank you for holding and what are you
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:09.920]  yes or go ahead hey how you doing I love what you're doing Alex um I see the world
[1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:16.640]  becoming a better place in the near future I mean we can defeat this new world order
[1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:23.760]  in the bible it's and we the people are all one with God we all came from the same place
[1:46:24.720 --> 1:46:31.440]  so if we all get together it's not a it's a fact we will defeat the new world order
[1:46:31.440 --> 1:46:38.560]  yeah if we just stop complying and recognize the new world order it will fall just recognizing evil
[1:46:39.280 --> 1:46:47.040]  will bring it down but we have to recognize it yes we have to recognize it and we have we
[1:46:47.040 --> 1:46:54.560]  we have the tools already for us to defeat them I mean the social media I mean that that reaches
[1:46:54.560 --> 1:47:01.680]  millions of people all around the world if if we spread the news and expose these tyrants
[1:47:01.680 --> 1:47:05.520]  we will win we have it right there in our faces and we don't even see it
[1:47:08.080 --> 1:47:12.800]  well the globalists use scientific manipulation of people called bloodedly and if we just become
[1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:18.240]  aware of their manipulation then it doesn't have the power over us anymore and it really is
[1:47:18.240 --> 1:47:23.520]  psychological slavery I agree that I think we're going to come out of this better on the other side
[1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:28.400]  the question is how bad is it going to get before it gets better what does your gut tell you the
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:37.520]  time frame is Lewis I mean we first we we need to get obama out of office that's first of all
[1:47:37.520 --> 1:47:45.760]  um and it looks like he's doing whatever he could just to stay in um well at least even if he leaves
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:53.840]  even if he leaves the bureaucracy is there now oh I mean if he leaves he's still got ties with um
[1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:59.920]  Hillary Clinton and Clinton you know I mean why why do we even why are we even still seeing these
[1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:05.280]  clinton why are they around well exactly and it's bigger than that they're just front people as well
[1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:09.680]  and Boehner won't even get rid of the obama care and republican congress people say oh
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:14.560]  it's here to stay we've got to beat the tea party it's here to stay because the banks want it the
[1:48:14.560 --> 1:48:21.760]  globalists want it the big ultra rich pigs that are tax exempt want it and the day people figure
[1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:26.400]  out why they want us fighting over race and stuff is because they're robbing all of us is the beginning
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:32.560]  of the end of these people and the day we stop letting them have our money and our labor through
[1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:38.560]  these fake taxes is the day their blood supply is cut off I appreciate your call Lewis great points

[1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:20.960]  Jim Keith who wrote black helicopters over America man I read both of his books in the mid 90s and
[1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:27.040]  thought they were kooky and like eight years later I realized they killed him because that guy knew

[1:55:06.400 --> 1:55:13.920]  to james in texas you're on the air good afternoon alex i was just going to bring up a i really
[1:55:13.920 --> 1:55:19.440]  think that the gross distortion of history is a big problem here in america you can go see
[1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:25.120]  emperor master million the german aristocrat who ran mexico at the driscoll hotel on six
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:31.840]  street right now so you have a misrepresentation of our history i think as far as you know where i
[1:55:31.840 --> 1:55:38.000]  see the future going the stuff that you talk about over the past 10 years you know has made it's
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:43.600]  not so much telling what people to think it's helping people understand how to think i mean
[1:55:43.600 --> 1:55:50.560]  you know there's a whole group of you know analysts quadrated types that you've created
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:56.000]  you know out of out of info or who really have an accurate you know discerning picture of what
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:00.880]  reality well i i mean i do want to say and i'll say this to be arrogant it's actually incredible
[1:56:01.600 --> 1:56:07.040]  that my radio broadcast and what we've done when it just comes to the analysis i've given
[1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:12.160]  historically mainly because i go off the global stone documents and can see their master plan
[1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:21.440]  and is about 99 percent accurate and the picture is so horrible people don't have the will to admit
[1:56:21.440 --> 1:56:27.200]  it to themselves but they're setting up a global tyranny to dumb down humanity scientifically
[1:56:27.200 --> 1:56:32.480]  incrementally attack us because we can't stop a slow motion attack they believe they believe we
[1:56:32.480 --> 1:56:39.040]  will evolve to accept being destroyed that we will evolve to our new mission laying down and dying
[1:56:39.040 --> 1:56:44.640]  to give them the future they are they are artificially programming us to lay down and die
[1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:51.680]  and tearing humanity apart at the same time while they do it i mean it is so satanic is it the only
[1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:58.080]  word to describe it is satanic go ahead i completely agree with you without question i mean i've lived
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:04.880]  in sex with my whole life um you can't you can't really go anywhere anymore without being constantly
[1:57:04.880 --> 1:57:12.560]  bombarded by you know satanic imagery they do they do live satanic ritual on television all the time i
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:17.280]  mean but but if you don't know what you're seeing how are you ever going to know like how could you
[1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:23.360]  even know that that's what's going on like i said you know the future is not you know is bleak in my
[1:57:23.360 --> 1:57:29.360]  opinion uh if you know listening to Alex Jones influence word.com you can't help but see that
[1:57:29.360 --> 1:57:35.920]  truth but there is there is hope in the fact that you know liberty and truth and freedom are popular
[1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:42.000]  ideas and and you you you can't force you know you can't force these kinds of things on people they
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:46.640]  have to discover it for themselves so it's really the leadership factor in your community your
[1:57:46.640 --> 1:57:52.480]  neighbors your church you know that your children you know they interact with the school and it has
[1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:58.480]  to be done on well yeah i mean take all the big pop people they all do actual satanic rituals on
[1:57:58.480 --> 1:58:02.880]  television and then laugh at you and say that's not what we're doing when you bring it up and
[1:58:02.880 --> 1:58:10.000]  they believe they're invoking power when they do this i mean it's it's crazy we're living on a weird
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:18.960]  planet in space with all this weird stuff going on reality is so fantastical it's a lot bigger than
[1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:26.720]  one old racist at the clippers i mean who cares we're in the middle of deep space with all this
[1:58:26.720 --> 1:58:36.880]  wondrous stuff going on around us and we're worried about some potbellied old man we're going to come

[2:01:25.520 --> 2:01:31.040]  the whole race thing it's just uh distraction all that uh where the world's going to that point um
[2:01:31.040 --> 2:01:35.040]  i don't think this big their new world order ain't going to work out what we're seeing right now is
[2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:39.440]  with uh liberty moment our movement in america is just exploding you guys are going to win you
[2:01:39.440 --> 2:01:44.960]  almost got ron paul in 2012 you guys are going to do it uh and then in europe nidalefrozen you
[2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:49.120]  kept they're going to get rid of the u and once they get rid of the u there's some hot water they
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:53.680]  have to go like bam they got what i was about to say though the u starting a war with russia as the
[2:01:53.680 --> 2:01:58.800]  distraction to allow them to not collapse i mean they will start a war before they let the new world
[2:01:58.800 --> 2:02:04.080]  order collapse yeah that that's that's what they need to do they gotta they gotta take the spotlight
[2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:09.520]  off them they gotta start that big moment but it's just so hard now because you know a nuclear war
[2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:15.040]  everyone no one wants to have a nuclear war except for these people so i i just i can't see it happening
[2:02:17.280 --> 2:02:23.040]  we're gonna win it all right james good to hear from you from canada uh interesting points ryan
[2:02:23.040 --> 2:02:29.120]  you're on the air from st lewis go ahead hey alex my comment's gonna lead into my observation but
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:34.960]  i just wanted to say that i woke up whenever i found out that the uh vietnam you know the gulf
[2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:40.080]  aton can never happen and then that just led to everything else and then i hear about you know
[2:02:40.080 --> 2:02:46.480]  jimmy sevill and then the addendum for him was he was actually a pedophile and you know i i can
[2:02:46.480 --> 2:02:51.600]  handle that as a smart thinking individual but where i think the future's going is i mean you
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:56.880]  have david ike on sometimes and we all know what he says so i mean i think you didn't add it but i
[2:02:56.880 --> 2:03:01.200]  think we're at it for some interesting times in the next 15 years like the veils going to be lifted
[2:03:03.520 --> 2:03:08.240]  well i think the veils already lifted to a great extent if people are willing to open their eyes up
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:14.720]  but i think you're absolutely right but like you know you can say we're we live on a planet in
[2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:21.200]  outer space and i mean that fact needs to be considered above all else i mean they you know i
[2:03:21.200 --> 2:03:27.920]  well i mean i mentioned that to just to just talk about how fantastical everything is and how
[2:03:27.920 --> 2:03:34.960]  incredible it is and how just the experiences that we take as no big deal are so rare and
[2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:41.280]  wonderful i mean i was in the colorado river saturday uh being drug around behind a boat
[2:03:42.320 --> 2:03:48.160]  you know body surfing hanging on to the back of the boat and the water was like 65 degrees is so
[2:03:48.160 --> 2:03:54.000]  refreshing and it was so sunny and beautiful and the trees were all psychedelic and i had
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:04:00.880]  just such a magic experience with my children that one consciousness that one event would be worth
[2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:07.200]  the equivalent of a lifetime that that one experience was so deep and refreshing and real
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:14.240]  and people all over the place just take it for granted to walk outside at night and see the moon
[2:04:14.240 --> 2:04:20.720]  and the stars and to see life and just everything is so enriching and rewarding and then meanwhile
[2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:25.520]  the globalists want to put themselves in front of us like they're the universe they're the world
[2:04:25.520 --> 2:04:30.720]  they're the future they want to make themselves reality and dominate our reality they want to
[2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:36.560]  destroy our free will these people are a joke but the fact that they're so stunted that they
[2:04:36.560 --> 2:04:41.920]  rule us is the bigger joke sorry closing comment no i just i agree with you that everything is
[2:04:41.920 --> 2:04:46.240]  beautiful and it's a wonder sign to be alive but i mean do you think people man the truth of david
[2:04:46.240 --> 2:04:53.680]  i you know is even half right who knows how deep the rabbit hole goes man i just i know the people
[2:04:53.680 --> 2:05:02.560]  running things want to hurt innocence and want to stunt humanity alex jones here with a very

[2:10:01.360 --> 2:10:08.560]  now six abortion clinics left in texas people just are really waking up to those and saying no
[2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:12.880]  so abortion clinics are shutting down all over the place as abortion becomes more and more unpopular
[2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:17.280]  in every poll especially with young people it's over 70 against it now those numbers are reversed
[2:10:17.280 --> 2:10:24.880]  since 1973 with roe v wade it shows that despite the mainstream propaganda and brainwashing the
[2:10:24.880 --> 2:10:31.760]  truth continues to come from behind the question is how do we save our civilization from just the
[2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:39.760]  overall dumbing down of our society and our civilization now porter standsbury of standsbury
[2:10:39.760 --> 2:10:46.000]  research dot com is a hard guy to get on the air he's one of my favorite guests to get on he's very
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:52.720]  busy and i remember reading some of his financial newsletters back in 2007 and and really i mean
[2:10:52.720 --> 2:10:56.960]  it all came true what he said in the housing market uh what he said we're going with a whole
[2:10:56.960 --> 2:11:04.400]  bunch of things and they've been able to paper over some of his latest predictions with unlimited
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:09.280]  quantitative easing but in the real world even with cooked numbers we have zero point one percent
[2:11:09.280 --> 2:11:14.640]  growth unemployment's incredibly bad but they cook the numbers there by uh kicking people off full
[2:11:14.640 --> 2:11:20.240]  time work to part time so they got two jobs so they say oh look jobs are increasing everybody knows
[2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:25.760]  for most people the economy's in the crapper but it's a selective economy now it's so scientifically
[2:11:25.760 --> 2:11:31.760]  rigged that certain divisions are doing well while others aren't much of this country looks like a
[2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:37.520]  third world bomb zone or something so i wanted to get porter standsbury on about the top stories
[2:11:37.520 --> 2:11:43.040]  he's working on the cutting edge breaking financial news and investments that he's looking into and then
[2:11:43.600 --> 2:11:49.200]  i'm gonna get him to talk about an at one time event coming up uh at uh the end of this month
[2:11:49.200 --> 2:11:59.680]  one day event in dallas t poon pickens is going to be uh speaking at that event uh and so much more
[2:12:00.400 --> 2:12:04.720]  and again t boon folks is uh i don't know a lot of tell you how much it is to even get him to speak
[2:12:04.720 --> 2:12:10.240]  but you got porter standsbury myself cactus rotor bill murphy van simons i'm going up there just to
[2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:16.960]  speak for free because i want to you know be part of the standsbury research society uh and all the
[2:12:16.960 --> 2:12:20.240]  benefits that come with that because they've invited me to other events that i couldn't go to
[2:12:20.240 --> 2:12:23.920]  you know in other countries and things but this is dallas so i said i'd come to the next one
[2:12:23.920 --> 2:12:30.320]  i'm going to be there alex jones dallas dot com they sold out of the main level of the ballroom
[2:12:30.960 --> 2:12:36.800]  but they were able to open up the area right above it uh and so uh again they've got limited
[2:12:36.800 --> 2:12:43.120]  tickets 25 off the price uh that was already there and it looks expensive but you can go
[2:12:43.120 --> 2:12:49.920]  here you know somebody like glenn beck speaking and pay more but that's to pay for all the speakers
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:54.800]  to give you inside cutting edge info from my perspective on the economy and more i look
[2:12:54.800 --> 2:13:00.960]  forward to meeting t boon pickens the billionaire uh from texas and more but i again alex jones
[2:13:00.960 --> 2:13:07.440]  dallas dot com that's not the reason porter's here porter's here because i want to get his
[2:13:07.440 --> 2:13:12.000]  take on a whole host of issues but i would imagine this will sell out the first round did
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:17.680]  did they added some limited tickets so alex jones dallas dot com is how you go and find the direct
[2:13:17.680 --> 2:13:25.200]  link to find that 25 percent off alex jones dallas uh okay uh let's go to porter standsbury the founder
[2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:30.080]  of standsbury and associates investment researchers i can't wait to hear what you have to say because
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:34.320]  this is kind of a cliffhanger you always drop big news on his porter what do you want to talk about
[2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:39.280]  out of the gates well i i want to get the things uh financially to help benefit people because as
[2:13:39.280 --> 2:13:45.280]  you know that's that's what i really do we research um uh investment ideas for folks we do
[2:13:45.280 --> 2:13:50.320]  so on an independent basis so we're not bankers or brokers we just sell information and of course
[2:13:50.320 --> 2:13:53.600]  we only make money if people were doing our newsletters which means we got to put out the right
[2:13:53.600 --> 2:13:58.240]  information and we're closing in quite a bit but i have an item that i thought was right up your
[2:13:58.240 --> 2:14:01.760]  alley and i don't know if your team has found this or not yet if you already talked about it
[2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:06.080]  that we can move on right away but i thought it really interesting that you know the new fat
[2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:10.720]  calol is going to take effect july 1st in fact as i'm sure you know and your readers
[2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:14.720]  and your listeners already all know is about closing down any ability for americans to have
[2:14:14.720 --> 2:14:19.920]  offshore banking accounts yes has nothing to do of course with tax evasion whatsoever
[2:14:19.920 --> 2:14:25.120]  because these are all these are all accounts that are are disclosed it's all about the record
[2:14:25.120 --> 2:14:31.120]  keeping that that is required and the and the requirement that these banks withhold taxes
[2:14:31.120 --> 2:14:35.760]  from any transaction and there's just no way that they can do they can meet these requirements
[2:14:35.760 --> 2:14:40.400]  so if the government knows that of course so what it's doing is it's forcing a lot of investment
[2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:48.400]  dollars back into us banks the same time this just came out today finra which is the the
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:54.480]  securities regulatory body that that's owned and managed by the industry itself the finra is not
[2:14:54.480 --> 2:15:02.400]  a government organization but it is a government like organization so finra just a positive new
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:09.600]  rule that's going to require every single securities dealer in america to open up every single private
[2:15:09.600 --> 2:15:19.280]  account to finra's own computers and finra claims that they want access to your account in real time
[2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:24.560]  so that they can monitor whether or not your broker is providing the right advice for you
[2:15:25.200 --> 2:15:31.600]  but the reality is this is now impossible for americans to conduct investments with any privacy
[2:15:31.600 --> 2:15:37.280]  whatsoever because they can't use an offshore broker and now finra is going to have constant
[2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:42.080]  monitoring in real time at every single investment account in the country and then they'll leave
[2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:47.280]  golden sacks on all the big boys alone and harass just like the banking bill was meant to shut down
[2:15:47.280 --> 2:15:54.640]  credit unions and small banks this is a total monopoly setup taking place uh where they can
[2:15:54.640 --> 2:16:00.400]  also nickel and diamond harass investment advisors that are out there this is a total
[2:16:00.400 --> 2:16:06.640]  consolidation meanwhile cns news reports today too big to audit large partnerships escape ira
[2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:11.680]  scrutiny the big billionaires and the globalists are literally above the law this is all being
[2:16:11.680 --> 2:16:16.400]  written to hammer the middle class but think about what this will do i mean one of the core
[2:16:17.680 --> 2:16:24.960]  one of the core foundations of a free market is that the the buyers in the market don't know for
[2:16:24.960 --> 2:16:30.320]  certain who all of the owners are of another security and the sec for example doesn't make
[2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:35.120]  people disclose that they own a particular stock until their interest in that company rises above
[2:16:35.120 --> 2:16:40.320]  a threshold usually about five percent and so that allows investors who are smart and savvy
[2:16:40.320 --> 2:16:45.280]  to go ahead and take an interest in a business without having their work or their idea stolen
[2:16:45.280 --> 2:16:50.720]  by other investors immediately you see what i'm saying so you know alex uh if you happen to have
[2:16:50.720 --> 2:16:54.960]  a good reputation like bootpickins about oil and gas and you want your bootpickins and you you want
[2:16:54.960 --> 2:16:59.600]  your um your your investors and yourself to take a position in the stock you shouldn't have to tell
[2:16:59.600 --> 2:17:02.960]  everybody about it in advance because that's going to make it impossible for you to build a position
[2:17:02.960 --> 2:17:09.200]  in that business or in that oil so this is an nsh hub now directly into private investment to be fed
[2:17:09.200 --> 2:17:15.120]  to select interest exactly so what are the chances right that those spenra computers end up getting bug
[2:17:15.120 --> 2:17:19.280]  or monitored by the nsa and what are the chances of course and i don't have any proof of this but
[2:17:19.280 --> 2:17:24.560]  what are the chances of that information that is surely being used in a lot of ways against people
[2:17:25.440 --> 2:17:32.080]  and and even something as simple as um knowing for example how many individual investors own
[2:17:32.080 --> 2:17:37.200]  certain securities could be very very valuable um so they want this data to be able to rig the
[2:17:37.200 --> 2:17:44.400]  markets even more and truly kill the free market exactly that i can't think of any other reason why
[2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:51.280]  someone would invest so much time uh and so much effort into trying to monitor every brokerage
[2:17:51.280 --> 2:17:56.800]  account in the united states in real time that's an enormous technical challenge and of course the
[2:17:56.800 --> 2:18:02.240]  only people with the authority to do it would be spenra and the fbc so just and you know this is
[2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:08.960]  this this idea was proposed today so it's brand new as far as i know and uh if you if you're right
[2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:18.480]  about the way the world is going then nothing will stop it porter can we go to standsbury research
[2:18:18.480 --> 2:18:24.640]  where do we find uh a news article about this because this is the first i've heard of this uh
[2:18:24.640 --> 2:18:28.480]  you you know i don't know that we have written about it yet because it literally just happened
[2:18:28.480 --> 2:18:32.960]  this morning so i would just recommend if you want to learn more you just go to google and google
[2:18:32.960 --> 2:18:40.400]  fennra f i n r a fennra and computer monitoring and i'm sure that the article will pop up fennra
[2:18:40.400 --> 2:18:45.360]  fn r a computer monitoring we're going to skip this network right this is so important i mean
[2:18:45.360 --> 2:18:50.560]  that's what i see is just a general analyst who looks at the whole world and and then connects
[2:18:50.560 --> 2:18:56.960]  the dots everything is having the the ultra high frequency trading systems put into it everything's
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:02.880]  being mashed all the corporations are dialing in and google and the nsa admit they can now predict
[2:19:02.880 --> 2:19:10.320]  the future but then only the insiders are able to have that intel completely rigging the entire
[2:19:10.320 --> 2:19:17.680]  system for themselves and trying to pull up the ladder so none of us can ever uh excel this is
[2:19:17.680 --> 2:19:22.400]  a new dark age we're talking about porter yeah and the other the other big trend i wanted to give
[2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:27.760]  people is that you know i have a lot of hard data to support alex's jones's idea about the death of
[2:19:27.760 --> 2:19:32.640]  the middle class in fact one of the main investment themes of my newsletter for the last three years
[2:19:32.640 --> 2:19:38.720]  has been that the death of the middle class and so uh for example uh one of our latest recommendations
[2:19:38.720 --> 2:19:45.840]  was rent a center and there's a huge growth in rent to own business because people's credit is so
[2:19:45.840 --> 2:19:52.000]  shot you know 39 percent of americans have lowest ranked subprime credit so they can't buy any kind
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:56.640]  of capital good anymore and they're in the rent to own industry instead of building out more at
[2:19:56.640 --> 2:20:03.920]  rent to own stores is now just putting financing kiosks inside other furniture retailers so that
[2:20:03.920 --> 2:20:10.000]  there isn't the stigma anymore of having to rent furniture so what happens is you go to uh to buy
[2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:14.800]  furniture and the furniture source is a star you don't qualify for a loan but you can rent to own
[2:20:14.800 --> 2:20:20.320]  and you can do that in our store and that that is driving tremendous new volumes of business to
[2:20:20.320 --> 2:20:26.560]  to rent a center actually which is a pioneer in that in that market that's uh that's one example
[2:20:26.560 --> 2:20:31.120]  of the death of the middle class that uh i found shocking the other time i found shocking when i
[2:20:31.120 --> 2:20:38.080]  looked at the numbers alex guess how many of the loans that general motors makes to retail car buyers
[2:20:38.080 --> 2:20:47.280]  are subprime amazing keep going here and oh by the way i did type in finra rule finra rule change
[2:20:47.280 --> 2:20:53.360]  the limits self-trading approved they admit that they're going to place an algorithm uh on to the
[2:20:53.360 --> 2:20:59.200]  trading desk of everyone basically anybody that trades stocks anything and it's going to surveil
[2:20:59.200 --> 2:21:04.560]  everything you do and the algorithm is going to say if you're doing something wrong or insider
[2:21:04.560 --> 2:21:11.280]  trading or naked shorts basically this outlaws normal activity but it's not even outlawing
[2:21:11.280 --> 2:21:16.400]  it's regulatorily saying it's it's it can't happen but then letting the insiders engage
[2:21:16.400 --> 2:21:21.360]  in every crime imaginable like derivatives marketing and the rest of it this this this is
[2:21:21.360 --> 2:21:28.320]  incredible well the you know the stated purpose of the finra rule and in my opinion most likely
[2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:34.000]  has nothing to do whatsoever with the real purpose of the new finra monitoring and the real purpose
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:38.880]  is that um this is the most valuable information that could exist in the world you don't you don't
[2:21:38.880 --> 2:21:43.280]  even need to be a high frequency trader if you know what everyone owns what everyone's trading
[2:21:43.280 --> 2:21:48.560]  you can get in front of them immediately so just think about how it's likely to be abused but this
[2:21:48.560 --> 2:21:55.440]  is real time total control of the trading desk before they even file stuff this is literally
[2:21:55.440 --> 2:22:00.960]  like someone in your investment firm standing over your shoulder yeah and it's not just in my firm
[2:22:00.960 --> 2:22:06.640]  it's in every literally it would be in every single retail account so there wouldn't be an
[2:22:06.640 --> 2:22:11.920]  account anywhere that wasn't being monitored in real time by finra this is this is absolutely
[2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:16.160]  the most orwellian thing that i have ever seen in finance and i thought i'd seen it all but this
[2:22:16.160 --> 2:22:21.600]  is a whole different level well that's the issue here porter is that everything has been lined up
[2:22:21.600 --> 2:22:27.760]  beta tested prepared now it's all going into overdrive and it says here the government will
[2:22:27.760 --> 2:22:34.160]  monitor you in real time for unethical policies or procedures and that with originating with an
[2:22:34.160 --> 2:22:39.760]  algorithm on your trading desk and it's everything you just said while you were talking i read this
[2:22:39.760 --> 2:22:45.120]  memo most of it it's four pages long i am completely blown away right now i mean this is
[2:22:45.120 --> 2:22:52.560]  live time hidden in plain view nsa systems controlled by jp morgan and uh goldman sacks
[2:22:52.560 --> 2:22:57.680]  who have their arms and all of this through the federal reserve giving the private federal reserve
[2:22:57.680 --> 2:23:04.240]  total surveillance of everything i mean this is the end of the market listen listen i want to be
[2:23:04.240 --> 2:23:10.480]  clear uh with the story that i have seen so far this is a finra rule and finra is a uh a privately
[2:23:10.480 --> 2:23:16.240]  controlled regulatory body that's that's run by the securities industry but it definitely has very
[2:23:16.240 --> 2:23:20.640]  close ties of course to the other regulators you mentioned no but what i'm saying is is the nsa
[2:23:21.200 --> 2:23:26.080]  this is how it works this is on record i know jalex i know this no no no i mean i know you know
[2:23:26.080 --> 2:23:35.520]  but let me explain you've got the big universities uh the military google uh facebook twitter microsoft
[2:23:35.520 --> 2:23:40.400]  and a handful of others that have full access to basically everything because they in tune
[2:23:40.400 --> 2:23:46.480]  dump everything they get into it and the regulators all have these master heads up displays where they
[2:23:46.480 --> 2:23:52.400]  can get into your bank account live time everything everything is now online and this is going to force
[2:23:52.400 --> 2:23:57.920]  the individual investment firms into that database for full access i mean do you disagree with that
[2:23:57.920 --> 2:24:06.640]  statement i i i can't prove any of those things that you said but this is very very disturbing to
[2:24:06.640 --> 2:24:13.760]  me and i feel like it is incredibly suspicious there is no regulatory need for real-time monitoring
[2:24:13.760 --> 2:24:19.920]  of accounts the the idea that finra can prevent financial crimes by monitoring your account in
[2:24:19.920 --> 2:24:26.720]  real time is not sensible so the uh so there must be another reason for it and i know the value of
[2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:31.120]  that information that they're trying to collect look this is a hundred light years ahead of nixon
[2:24:31.120 --> 2:24:36.560]  having people's income tax returns i mean we see them using all this this they're going to leak this
[2:24:36.560 --> 2:24:41.120]  to the media they're going to claim insider trading politically on everybody this is a
[2:24:41.120 --> 2:24:46.320]  rain of bloody terror in fact i found a money beat article in the wall street journal that just came
[2:24:46.320 --> 2:24:52.000]  out get ready for regulators to peer into your portfolio right and i know that's what that's
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:57.440]  what we're talking about it's uh i'm telling you alex i i'm i have never seen any kind of
[2:24:57.440 --> 2:25:02.800]  violation of privacy of this magnitude never suggested before this is really really really
[2:25:02.800 --> 2:25:09.040]  truly scary well it's beyond the nsa because you know the government illegally spying on your data
[2:25:09.040 --> 2:25:13.440]  who it's a big felony and then meanwhile you have these governmentally empowered private
[2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:18.560]  consortiums that's why i said federal reserves same deal masquerading is government that aren't
[2:25:18.560 --> 2:25:26.160]  right and then they say we're going to literally live time watch everything you're doing this is
[2:25:26.160 --> 2:25:33.440]  outrageous so uh this is all part of course of a much larger strategy is the paradigm that i've
[2:25:33.440 --> 2:25:37.520]  heard you've been espousing it i have some reservations about that as you know i think people
[2:25:37.520 --> 2:25:41.200]  are sort of just all acting in their own best interest but certainly we're not moving in the
[2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:46.160]  right direction and i'd love to give you a stat about that we're talking about the destruction
[2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:51.920]  of the middle class and how the the growth of rent the own furniture is storing again and doing it
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:57.200]  in a new way that it's like the payday loans all of it where people are captured in the system
[2:25:57.200 --> 2:26:02.000]  can never get out of it never getting out of it right but how about this so the world the economy
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:05.920]  is supposed to be doing great and the government saved general motors and now general motor sales
[2:26:05.920 --> 2:26:10.880]  are booming and everything is going to be great right alex except for do you know what percentage
[2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:17.680]  of general motors cars that are sold uh that are financed what percentage of those finances are subprime
[2:26:21.040 --> 2:26:26.640]  any idea i have no idea well what do you think a reasonable number might be i mean if you're
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:35.600]  going to just guess maybe 10 15 of car loans be subprime maybe 25 it's 90 alex well that's what
[2:26:35.600 --> 2:26:39.440]  i was going to say they're absolutely wrecking people over the calls everywhere and it's a
[2:26:39.440 --> 2:26:45.600]  debt paradigm they'll that will collapse how many so how many of general motors sales right because
[2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:50.400]  almost everyone that buys a new car finances it so how much of those sales are just being
[2:26:50.400 --> 2:26:55.280]  manufactured by these ridiculously low interest rates and by giving credit to people who are not
[2:26:55.280 --> 2:27:02.480]  credit worthy and wait a minute didn't we just do this in the housing market so we have an we have
[2:27:02.480 --> 2:27:06.160]  a government that had a vested interest and the success of a private business which was general
[2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:11.040]  motors and then and the reason why is because of the union so the government can't allow the union
[2:27:11.040 --> 2:27:17.680]  to fail ergo it can't allow general motors to fail so we spent 50 billion dollars of taxpayer money
[2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:24.240]  to bail out general motors losing about 15 billion along the way meanwhile the unions took no haircut
[2:27:24.240 --> 2:27:28.080]  what's and they're creating a new bubble that people can't pay and then they'll lose their
[2:27:28.080 --> 2:27:32.480]  credit being wrecked over the calls so right so the so just to be clear the bondholders lost
[2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:37.920]  90 cents on the dollar and the unions lost nothing on the dollar and they didn't have a single penny
[2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:44.960]  of their pension fund discounted for the failure of their company okay meanwhile the only way that
[2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:49.760]  general motors is able to generate the revenue they have today is by giving people cars who have no
[2:27:49.760 --> 2:27:53.920]  credit and then that is and what do you think is going to happen well you know what's going to
[2:27:53.920 --> 2:27:57.440]  happen these people are not going to be able to pay these loans the cars are going to get reposed
[2:27:57.440 --> 2:28:03.360]  sooner or later and the whole thing is going to evolve into another bubble and if you want to see
[2:28:03.360 --> 2:28:08.800]  evidence of this happening just look at how many consumer finance companies those that is companies
[2:28:08.800 --> 2:28:15.040]  that finance the purchase of automobiles specifically have gone public in the last six months all these
[2:28:15.040 --> 2:28:20.560]  companies failed and at 08 and 09 they got bought for pennies on the dollar by private equity firms
[2:28:20.560 --> 2:28:26.320]  they've now come back all by giving credit to people who don't deserve it and not now they're
[2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:33.280]  all selling out to the public meanwhile the default rate on on loan securities on debt
[2:28:33.280 --> 2:28:37.520]  securities that are backed with automobiles the default rates are beginning to creep up
[2:28:37.520 --> 2:28:42.080]  and the value these curies is getting to fall and right before the whole house of cars collapses
[2:28:42.080 --> 2:28:46.480]  you've got wall street selling these firms back to the public and you've got general motors
[2:28:46.480 --> 2:28:51.600]  rushing cars out the door with phony paper as fast as they can so let's be clear just like the housing
[2:28:51.600 --> 2:28:57.920]  bubble they're not just giving people loans that they'll never be able to pay back they are selling
[2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:03.360]  these loans as derivatives do we have any idea how many times they're selling them over and over
[2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:09.760]  again that's exactly what's happened so if you look at the entire asset that credit market the only
[2:29:09.760 --> 2:29:16.160]  two areas of growth in the last five years are student loans and automobiles so student loans
[2:29:16.160 --> 2:29:20.640]  are all owned by the government so there's no point even discussing and obama cares targeting young
[2:29:20.640 --> 2:29:24.160]  people as well stay there i think i know where you're going with this but one of the top experts

[2:36:41.920 --> 2:36:45.600]  like porter's tansbury porter talk more about the event than i want to pick your brain some more
[2:36:46.480 --> 2:36:51.520]  well a couple of great things are going to go on at the event one thing i can i can assure you
[2:36:51.520 --> 2:36:56.160]  is that if you have an interest in investing in the oil and gas for the thoughts that's going on
[2:36:56.160 --> 2:37:01.360]  in the united states you're going to get more great information and absolutely the latest
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:07.280]  information at this event because not many people know more about shale oil and gas and
[2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:14.160]  ultra deep ultra deep offshore oil and gas and boon picket and cacti schroeder and also our
[2:37:14.160 --> 2:37:19.440]  resource analyst not by the alley will be there so the thing that i would like you to that i want
[2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:26.400]  to sort of tease your audience about is there are multi-billion dollar investments going on right
[2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:31.520]  now in these ultra deep wells in the Gulf and if you remember the micondo well that's going out of
[2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:36.800]  control a lot of people see see that only as a disaster and it certainly was but it was also
[2:37:36.800 --> 2:37:42.960]  an uncontrolled well that was spewing 60 000 barrels of oil a day and that's that's one of the
[2:37:42.960 --> 2:37:47.280]  largest uncontrolled wells in the history of oil and gas industry in america to give you a
[2:37:47.280 --> 2:37:53.440]  comparison the famous well spindle top was only uncontrolled at 100 000 barrels a day so this
[2:37:53.440 --> 2:38:00.000]  was a massive well this was a this was a breakthrough gusher and the ability of the industry to find
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:05.440]  new giant wells like this and those ultra deep locations is really growing thanks to things
[2:38:05.440 --> 2:38:10.880]  like 4d seismic and of course just yes the unbelievable things we can do now with horizontal
[2:38:10.880 --> 2:38:17.840]  drilling so we can go 10 000 feet down uh underwater and then and then another five miles
[2:38:17.840 --> 2:38:22.880]  underground from there to find these unbelievable wells and and there's a there's a couple of
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:28.080]  really neat securities that i want to share with people that cover broad areas of the deep water
[2:38:28.080 --> 2:38:32.880]  spectrum a couple of really interesting royalty trusts so you don't have any of the capital
[2:38:32.880 --> 2:38:37.680]  risks of funding these buildouts but if they find rules you can have a very large income stream
[2:38:37.680 --> 2:38:45.280]  so a royalty trust review and then sort of a picks and troubles analysis of who's good where all the
[2:38:45.280 --> 2:38:50.000]  money on the development is going to get spent again taking away some of the the risk of for the
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:54.720]  investors but giving them ways to participate in the huge investments that are being made let me
[2:38:54.720 --> 2:38:59.680]  ask you this why did you invite me to speak and you said i can speak about whatever i want i want
[2:38:59.680 --> 2:39:05.600]  to talk about the future of media the singularities that were headed towards and the fact that this
[2:39:05.600 --> 2:39:11.120]  will be the most volatile time in history we've ever seen will only get more volatile i want to
[2:39:11.120 --> 2:39:17.200]  talk about the fact that the only prosperous society and safe society is a moral society
[2:39:17.200 --> 2:39:21.120]  and that's why i believe all the important people they're going to be there better get
[2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:27.440]  aggressive politically or lose everything and not just uh aggressive politically in the classical
[2:39:27.440 --> 2:39:34.320]  sense funding libertarian causes we better get super militant like the criminal socialist or it's
[2:39:34.320 --> 2:39:38.000]  over uh and they keep that you know i mean does that sound like a good topic porter
[2:39:39.840 --> 2:39:46.080]  well i think that uh i invited you to shake up my audience you know the the 500 or so people
[2:39:46.080 --> 2:39:51.680]  that have registered through my business to be there are are are all almost exclusively high
[2:39:51.680 --> 2:39:57.040]  net worth investors that are coming to to get information on making more money and i think
[2:39:57.040 --> 2:40:03.280]  that they need to hear a message from you uh that the whole system that undergirds their
[2:40:03.280 --> 2:40:08.560]  ability to to continue to build wealth is being threatened and i hope that you can help them
[2:40:08.560 --> 2:40:13.920]  discover new ways of getting involved you know some see that's crazy you're so smart you didn't
[2:40:13.920 --> 2:40:18.320]  even need to tell me what to come to speak about you knew what i would do see i wish i was smart
[2:40:18.320 --> 2:40:23.440]  like that porter i'm not kissing your butt you always amaze me how you just always get the
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:29.440]  combination of what something really is without being told well i you alex you're probably the
[2:40:29.440 --> 2:40:34.160]  leading guy in the world to give that speech so i was very very happy when we invited you
[2:40:34.160 --> 2:40:38.000]  and you graciously agreed i wonder what t-bone pickings is gonna think here in it you know
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:42.720]  you're gonna be really surprised i've had a couple nice conversations with t-bone and uh he is
[2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:47.440]  definitely uh far more libertarian than he realizes you know i think he sees himself as a republican
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:53.200]  like a lot of people do but he really is very leery of uh further growth in government and
[2:40:53.200 --> 2:40:58.000]  he said some things that i think you're gonna find shocking about the real purpose of the iraq war
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:03.760]  something that he really knew as a mover and shaker and republican serval wow all right well
[2:41:03.760 --> 2:41:09.120]  it's going to be hoity toity it's a very important uh information now now are you going to dole out
[2:41:09.120 --> 2:41:14.000]  any of these speeches on your radio show or on the porter standsbury website uh standsbury
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:21.200]  research dot com or uh what's going to happen with that well uh we we do have uh we have sponsors
[2:41:21.200 --> 2:41:26.880]  we have uh subscribers of mine who have paid a thousand dollars uh to be able to get access to
[2:41:26.880 --> 2:41:32.720]  these presentations online and so some of the speeches will be uh final cast on the website
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:37.360]  um but for but otherwise uh this is uh really only for the privilege use of this audience
[2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:41.840]  well that's what the free market's all about i tell you i'm honored to be at this event
[2:41:41.840 --> 2:41:46.240]  and i hope folks will come to it and support liberty because if people don't start voting
[2:41:46.240 --> 2:41:52.000]  with their dollars like they need to survive we're going to lose everything because this is really
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:57.600]  a death battle we can now clearly see porter the system is trying to take down everything
[2:41:57.600 --> 2:42:03.120]  with one fell swoop right now so much evil is happening that i can't even keep my eye on it
[2:42:03.120 --> 2:42:07.440]  all this is a bombshell you dropped on us uh about get ready for regulators to peer into your
[2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:12.720]  portfolio it's the arrogance of it are they doing that because they know there's awakening happening
[2:42:12.720 --> 2:42:19.120]  or why are they moving so fast and you said you also have some positive news yeah you know um
[2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:25.920]  alex the the motivation of regulators is very simple they want more power and if you follow
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:30.400]  what they do and how they do it it's all about aggregating more power in our society i mean
[2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:35.760]  it's very simple and you know you you've detailed the the intricacies and the webs of how they go
[2:42:35.760 --> 2:42:41.440]  about doing it but it's all for power it's just that simple and the good news i think uh that's
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:46.240]  going on our economy really does focus on oil and gas and i don't mean to to be the dead horse
[2:42:46.240 --> 2:42:50.240]  but i but no this is the new renaissance it's just like the discovery of oil caused our our
[2:42:50.240 --> 2:42:55.520]  second industrial revolution if we're able to get this super huge amounts of oil it's going to really
[2:42:55.520 --> 2:43:02.480]  help us i don't i really think even now people don't understand how transformative this has been
[2:43:02.480 --> 2:43:08.320]  not just the united states but globally so if you look for example at the amount of propane
[2:43:08.320 --> 2:43:13.680]  that the us is able to export we've almost quintupled the amount of propane we're exporting
[2:43:13.680 --> 2:43:18.960]  and the only limit to that really is infrastructure we don't have enough export ports yet so we're
[2:43:18.960 --> 2:43:23.600]  and we're of course as you i'm sure you're aware of we're building massive new natural gas export
[2:43:23.600 --> 2:43:27.040]  facilities they're going to be coming online in 2015 and that's why they want to have a
[2:43:27.040 --> 2:43:32.160]  software with russia to cut off their pipelines and then the globalist through the us can resupply
[2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:37.680]  europe well listen i don't know all the different reasons but i can tell you this um
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:44.720]  um that uh the the willingness and ability of us to become a exporter of energy could be an
[2:43:44.720 --> 2:43:51.440]  enormous change politically in the world it will allow us to stop military backing of so many regimes
[2:43:51.440 --> 2:43:56.160]  around the world where we've we've we've where we've been told it's necessary for uh energy uh
[2:43:56.160 --> 2:44:00.560]  reasons but that's of the elite or moral here's the issue they're putting no and i know they're
[2:44:00.560 --> 2:44:06.800]  they're not i understand all that but but alex the fact is if if america begins to export uh
[2:44:06.800 --> 2:44:11.840]  500 billion or so of energy every year which i think is a reasonable target for for say 2017
[2:44:11.840 --> 2:44:18.000]  2018 it is going to improve the the competitive standing of america in the world so it's key
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:23.280]  to promote the oil and gas renaissance i totally agree with you and i know a lot of elites want that
[2:44:23.280 --> 2:44:28.880]  the problem is obama and the cloward and piven crowd as you know are killing the uh the pipeline
[2:44:28.880 --> 2:44:33.920]  out of canada keystone listen that that there's lots of reasons for those things but let me just
[2:44:33.920 --> 2:44:38.880]  let me just argue back about one point when it comes to this okay because for the last 15 years
[2:44:38.880 --> 2:44:44.960]  i had to live with the nonsense crap about peak oil being shoved down my throat by all the elite
[2:44:44.960 --> 2:44:51.360]  total crap it was the elites who used that live war in iraq the elites who used that nonsense
[2:44:51.360 --> 2:44:57.280]  justified solar energy which is a load of crap and it was the elite who gave all of our tax dollars
[2:44:57.280 --> 2:45:03.280]  to people like warren buffett the bill to literally build windmills are you crazy alex this is not
[2:45:03.280 --> 2:45:10.640]  not green mark we this is an amsterdam we don't need windmill this is sparta it's a load of crap
[2:45:10.640 --> 2:45:15.440]  and so listen i there is some good news in america today which is that real americans like the
[2:45:15.440 --> 2:45:21.920]  independent oil man of texas have said oh no we're not out of oil far from it and america by the way
[2:45:21.920 --> 2:45:28.160]  america is is on the verge of being the leading producer of oil in the world in fact texas alone
[2:45:28.160 --> 2:45:35.280]  is now producing two million barrels of oil crude oil not gas oil every day alex and that is more
[2:45:35.280 --> 2:45:40.320]  oil production than any country in the world separate saudi arabia and that's just texas hey
[2:45:40.320 --> 2:45:46.400]  old texas so listen we we we the people are going to own this oil because it's all small
[2:45:46.400 --> 2:45:52.640]  independent folks it's not the exxon i know i love it i love it small guys and i at my show
[2:45:52.640 --> 2:45:57.120]  you're going to see a presentation about the leading new independent producers i don't want to
[2:45:57.120 --> 2:46:01.680]  stay the name of the stock but this is a company that today is only worth a billion dollars alex
[2:46:01.680 --> 2:46:05.920]  and i will bet you i'll bet you a thousand dollars we'll give it to your charity that this
[2:46:05.920 --> 2:46:11.200]  business will be worth 25 billion dollars wow over the next 10 years let me just stop you i'm not
[2:46:11.200 --> 2:46:16.320]  poo-pooing what you're saying and it's another example of the free market even though obama's
[2:46:16.320 --> 2:46:21.680]  been trying to block it while claiming he's for domestic oil exploration and obviously i'm in
[2:46:21.680 --> 2:46:26.240]  everything he's done everything he can to stop it but guess what it's more money for the interior
[2:46:26.240 --> 2:46:31.760]  department it's more money for him which is exactly why he's changed this tune i was about to say
[2:46:31.760 --> 2:46:37.040]  but they want obama care to stall the economy cloward and piven so it's kind of schizophrenic
[2:46:37.040 --> 2:46:42.080]  government wants more power and wants this oil money and some of his constituent government people
[2:46:42.080 --> 2:46:46.080]  do actually want to help the economy because they're not evil uh you know they're i mean
[2:46:46.080 --> 2:46:49.920]  even corrupt people don't want to ruin everything only the very top wants to do that because they
[2:46:49.920 --> 2:46:56.160]  hate america so much so how do we then that's what i want to learn how do we make sure we're able
[2:46:56.160 --> 2:47:02.080]  to get this oil and natural gas and become massive net exporters and and supercharge the economy how
[2:47:02.080 --> 2:47:07.120]  do we beat the schizophrenia of the democrats and some republicans that want to ruin the economy to
[2:47:07.120 --> 2:47:12.320]  control us versus those that actually want to have a country well i get you know that's a very
[2:47:12.320 --> 2:47:17.040]  complicated answer but i can tell you this no one in the world knows more about the answer to that
[2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:22.000]  question than boo and pikens and you're not going to hear him speak anywhere else about that topic
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:26.240]  but except for on our show and if you want alex you can come out and ask him the question yourself
[2:47:27.840 --> 2:47:32.160]  sounds good no i want to ask that question how do we stop the people trying to strangle
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:39.280]  in its crib the second oil renaissance uh that can take this country to the next level here you
[2:47:39.280 --> 2:47:43.920]  know what here's a simple thing think about right how many more oil trade disasters are we
[2:47:43.920 --> 2:47:48.560]  going to have to have before obama gets off his butt and lets people build safe pipelines
[2:47:48.560 --> 2:47:54.560]  oh i know they won't let us have anything and they've got all these well-meaning liberals
[2:47:54.560 --> 2:47:59.520]  that try to stop the pipelines and and there is some bad fracking that goes on but that's usually
[2:47:59.520 --> 2:48:03.760]  you know in in areas i mean most areas it's very clean but but forget fracking we can go to the
[2:48:03.760 --> 2:48:08.960]  super deep levels clearly it's an agenda to shut down our energy needs look at the coal power plants
[2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:14.400]  how they're shutting those off why does obama want to shut american power off i don't know but i
[2:48:14.400 --> 2:48:18.560]  actually think that coal is one of the most interesting um i guess what you could make right
[2:48:18.560 --> 2:48:23.520]  now it's been completely left for dead people are forgetting it still makes up half of our base power
[2:48:23.520 --> 2:48:26.640]  and there are really neat securities out there again i'm going to refer you to this idea of
[2:48:26.640 --> 2:48:31.760]  these royalties trusted out there there are there are ways that you can buy a royalty on huge amounts
[2:48:31.760 --> 2:48:36.000]  of coal where you're not responsible for any of the production costs but if america keeps using
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:42.320]  coal you're going to make a lot of money well i mean we've got to keep using coal it's it's it's
[2:48:42.320 --> 2:48:47.040]  keeps the lights on not just us but it's going to power the chinese economy as well for a very
[2:48:47.040 --> 2:48:53.200]  very long time into the future people people out there are just sort of there's no area of the
[2:48:53.200 --> 2:48:57.920]  economy that most people know less about the energy and these these fools who think that
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:02.000]  by plugging in their cars that they're doing something to save the environment it's just
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:07.120]  absolutely idiotic so yeah so you'd rather you'd rather uh you'd rather rely on coal which is
[2:49:07.120 --> 2:49:12.000]  what's producing that energy you're putting in your car right you'd rather have a coal power plant
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:17.040]  that right that we have to mine the coal you have to ship it by train a thousand miles or
[2:49:17.040 --> 2:49:22.160]  more so a huge power plant that puts out massive amounts of pollution right then you've got to
[2:49:22.160 --> 2:49:26.080]  build an electric grid where you're going to lose probably 80 percent of the power in the
[2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:31.440]  transmission so you can put it in your dump car i see people downtown with those cars and i want to
[2:49:31.440 --> 2:49:36.320]  send my reporters out and the vaults and those i see a few of them and i go you know they've
[2:49:36.320 --> 2:49:41.840]  done the equations and i have the news article where this takes more energy and more co2 than oil
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:48.160]  and they go and they go no it doesn't no it doesn't racist i mean they're just so stupid right i don't
[2:49:48.160 --> 2:49:54.560]  want to drive a prius because i'm racist against japanese people i i i get i get all the same
[2:49:54.560 --> 2:49:58.800]  nonsense all the time out this is so silly and people who think that you know we could power
[2:49:58.800 --> 2:50:04.560]  the world with lily pads and and bunny rabbits and that drives me straight up the wall and what
[2:50:04.560 --> 2:50:09.120]  they what really drives me up the wall is that they want to spend my tax dollars on this nonsense
[2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:12.960]  it just it's absolutely insane but you know what it is worse than other places
[2:50:13.920 --> 2:50:18.240]  look what has happened to the industrial production of germany thanks to their massive
[2:50:18.240 --> 2:50:23.120]  investments look at spain they literally blew the engine of spain they're they're literally
[2:50:23.120 --> 2:50:29.600]  destroying their economies by by uh subsidizing ridiculous investments in solar power plants
[2:50:29.600 --> 2:50:33.280]  hey alice did you know what you'll find in the middle of every solar power plant in the united
[2:50:33.280 --> 2:50:40.720]  states natural gas the natural gas pipeline natural gas generator it's it's just such nonsense the
[2:50:40.720 --> 2:50:46.000]  only power actually getting produced at all those plants is made by natural gas natural gas is amazing
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:51.600]  do one more segment i'll go into overdrive and go to charles uh am am kathy lisa rich i'll get to

[2:54:35.280 --> 2:54:43.520]  our guest here in the final segment I agree with you that innovation the globalists all admit this
[2:54:43.520 --> 2:54:48.080]  we should all be working two three days a week you should be a society based on what do you bring
[2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:53.920]  to the table not how big of an insider are you and so it's the crony capitalist versus the real
[2:54:53.920 --> 2:54:59.360]  capitalist with the crony capitalist scapegoating the real free marketers and the real renaissance men
[2:54:59.360 --> 2:55:05.360]  and women out there we have to tell our story as Ron Paul has said that collectivism creates a living
[2:55:05.360 --> 2:55:10.880]  you know what hole versus free market that creates a heaven the problem is a free market
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:15.840]  creates a heaven then your kids become spoiled their kids become demons con artists come in and
[2:55:15.840 --> 2:55:21.840]  take over how do you stop the lottery effect or 95% of people that win lotteries and statistics
[2:55:21.840 --> 2:55:27.680]  end up in jail dead or broken two years how do you stop stop it when you have a free market
[2:55:27.680 --> 2:55:33.120]  it makes so much money everyone turns into spoiled rotten demons and then attacks whoever's producing
[2:55:33.120 --> 2:55:40.080]  and is in an immoral scumbag how do you stop the delusional nature of you know the classic thing
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:45.600]  of the spoiled wives or the rich husband or the spoiled kids I mean how do you stop that because
[2:55:45.600 --> 2:55:51.920]  that is a paradox Porter Stansbury you're exactly right I see it all the time and I would say that
[2:55:51.920 --> 2:55:57.120]  our country came up with a great solution to that when shortly after we were founded and that was
[2:55:57.120 --> 2:56:02.400]  our our constitution and our bill of rights and that the the real way to put a stop to that cycle
[2:56:02.400 --> 2:56:08.880]  of depravity is to make it clear to people that they cannot use the government as a tool for
[2:56:08.880 --> 2:56:13.200]  appropriation they can't do it you're not you're not you're not gonna be allowed to vote yourself
[2:56:13.200 --> 2:56:17.840]  somebody else's wallet and you know Alex I know you don't have to travel very much because your
[2:56:17.840 --> 2:56:22.160]  show but I would urge you if you ever get the opportunity to go to Singapore because in the
[2:56:22.160 --> 2:56:26.400]  last fifth year Singapore went from being one of the poorest places on earth to being literally
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:32.080]  the richest uh Singapore on a per capita basis it's far wealthier than America and when you when
[2:56:32.080 --> 2:56:36.640]  you are in Singapore everyone tells you the same thing which is really simple it's a it's a it's a
[2:56:36.640 --> 2:56:43.360]  whole national slogan nothing is free in Singapore and they're proud of that there is no welfare
[2:56:43.360 --> 2:56:47.680]  there is very little regulation nothing is free and like Switzerland they got money coming out
[2:56:47.680 --> 2:56:53.760]  their ears and like which one they got money coming out their ears so how how can we spread
[2:56:53.760 --> 2:56:59.360]  the idea that folks who are living at the expense of their neighbors aren't Americans and they don't
[2:56:59.360 --> 2:57:04.160]  deserve our respect or our sympathy their leeches on our society and they must be stopped well look
[2:57:04.160 --> 2:57:08.400]  everybody knows like in Japan they have those monkeys that live in the woods and everybody's been
[2:57:08.400 --> 2:57:12.480]  feeding them so now they're all obese and have diabetes and are lazy and beat each other up all
[2:57:12.480 --> 2:57:18.880]  day I mean it's made the monkeys totally immoral I saw a TV show on it I mean it's a fact domestication
[2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:23.120]  ruins creatures yeah I don't have to go to Japan to see that I live in Baltimore
[2:57:25.760 --> 2:57:31.280]  well our society is crumbling and what do we do now that we're in a democracy on a republic
[2:57:31.280 --> 2:57:37.120]  and 51% can literally vote to make me their slave what's going to happen well I can tell you what's
[2:57:37.120 --> 2:57:41.760]  going to happen that those systems are going to continue to increase in power and in wealth
[2:57:42.320 --> 2:57:48.800]  until they collapse and you know I mean Alex in the city of Baltimore I'd say 75% of the
[2:57:48.800 --> 2:57:54.720]  residents in the city are the are the underclass and they they have no desire to work they haven't
[2:57:54.720 --> 2:58:00.080]  worked in generations they're completely dependent upon the handouts and the largesse of the producers
[2:58:00.080 --> 2:58:04.000]  and guess what that that cohort of that population continues to grow and to have
[2:58:04.000 --> 2:58:08.160]  big families that they can't afford and then what do the workers do well eventually like
[2:58:08.160 --> 2:58:12.240]  this already happened in Detroit the workers leave so the whole I mean you want to see the
[2:58:12.240 --> 2:58:20.320]  future of America since the time in Detroit America's future Detroit Porter stands very
[2:58:20.320 --> 2:58:24.160]  look forward I feel like I know you all these years interviewing you look forward to seeing

[3:00:52.720 --> 3:00:58.320]  plague world war three comes along i mean one quarter year died in a plague then uh the anti
[3:00:58.320 --> 3:01:03.280]  question it's a ten nation the earth rules for the 48 months is three and a half years kills one
[3:01:03.280 --> 3:01:08.800]  third of the earth and then uh he is eliminated and then you get to live the uh thousand years by
[3:01:08.800 --> 3:01:14.640]  the scripture all the medical technology comes forward and uh we uh get to live for a thousand
[3:01:14.640 --> 3:01:18.800]  years because that's the only reason why they haven't started world war three yet the uh one more
[3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:22.800]  government the global leaders they want to have the advanced technologies you know this is what i
[3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:28.800]  gotta say even if you don't believe in god in the bible what it really says what genesis really
[3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:34.240]  says what azekiel really says what daniel really says what revelations really says
[3:01:35.440 --> 3:01:40.960]  is all coming true like a science fiction movie and there's no way those people could just be
[3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:47.440]  making all this up uh and it's bizarre i mean it really is a riddle wrapped in an enigma
[3:01:48.560 --> 3:01:55.200]  that the un is setting up a system they call ten kingdoms with sub regions and each regions into
[3:01:55.200 --> 3:02:01.360]  ten regions we have ten femur regions and they even i mean they follow the bible that's the
[3:02:01.360 --> 3:02:08.080]  weird thing is the elite are following the bible judiciously and they believe in the devil and
[3:02:08.080 --> 3:02:15.680]  worship him they believe the devil's going to win and again i've studied them they believe in lucifer
[3:02:15.680 --> 3:02:21.120]  they believe lucifer is the good guy and jesus is the bad guy they're rosa crucians what do you think
[3:02:21.120 --> 3:02:28.480]  of that well the oldest religion in the world is the worship of molok they come from before bablon
[3:02:28.480 --> 3:02:33.520]  and that's uh you know the elitists of the earth are really into molok right to the uh to the
[3:02:33.520 --> 3:02:38.640]  ninth degree so that's where we're really headed at is they're trying to fought the molok religion
[3:02:38.640 --> 3:02:44.000]  right into our religion by getting rid of god and all and uh at one point it will the friction will
[3:02:44.000 --> 3:02:51.440]  go kaboom and uh god will win because good always wins out over evil unfortunately evil is 49.9 percent
[3:02:51.440 --> 3:02:56.240]  of of the world and good is 50.1 percent that's why good always wins over but evil's got its foot
[3:02:56.240 --> 3:03:04.800]  in the door and it's coming in we need to stop it yep very powerful call i just can't believe it
[3:03:04.800 --> 3:03:11.840]  all it's all happening i just i just can't believe it i mean i just marvel we're living in the times
[3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:18.560]  that john wrote about anyway you slice it even if it isn't real we know john was a real guys in the
[3:03:18.560 --> 3:03:23.280]  roman histories and the jewish histories we know jesus was a real guy but i mean even if you don't
[3:03:23.280 --> 3:03:27.680]  believe the whole story of the bible i'm just just for argument's sake the elite are using it like
[3:03:27.680 --> 3:03:38.560]  an instruction manual you know 1984 isn't supposed to be an instruction manual that's what i say to
[3:03:38.560 --> 3:03:45.200]  hillary clinton we're gonna go to break this is a short segment i don't give everybody their do

[3:09:16.400 --> 3:09:22.080]  point things got so bad the 47 percent called mit romney to apologize
[3:09:29.040 --> 3:09:30.320]  msmbc is here
[3:09:34.000 --> 3:09:37.920]  they're a little overwhelmed they've never seen an audience this big before
[3:09:37.920 --> 3:09:53.360]  but look everybody is trying to keep up with this incredibly fast changing media landscape
[3:09:54.320 --> 3:10:01.200]  for example i got a lot of grief on cable news for promoting obama care to young people on between
[3:10:01.200 --> 3:10:07.200]  two firms but that's what young people like to watch and to be fair i am not the first person
[3:10:07.200 --> 3:10:18.800]  on television between two potted plants you know we'll play more of it after we go to your phone
[3:10:18.800 --> 3:10:23.680]  calls i want to get to your phone calls but here is more of mark dies the videos up on info
[3:10:23.680 --> 3:10:28.560]  wars dot com i'm going right to adam kathy lisa and mark here in just a moment but here is mark
[3:10:28.560 --> 3:10:38.960]  dies on synco de mayo and then we will continue with your calls straight ahead what do you think
[3:10:38.960 --> 3:10:43.600]  about these republicans their racist statements john bainer said he doesn't like mexican food should
[3:10:43.600 --> 3:10:49.360]  we tolerate such bigotry no do you think maybe we should push i mean he should be pushed out of
[3:10:49.360 --> 3:10:55.120]  congress for such racist statements well i think people in his district should consider voting for
[3:10:55.120 --> 3:10:59.680]  somebody else have you heard these racist comments from john bainer that he doesn't like mexican food
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:06.560]  no we tolerate something like that in today's society such bigotry in the congress i wouldn't
[3:11:06.560 --> 3:11:11.120]  say so i think we should tolerate that bigotry or do you think maybe he should resign from office for
[3:11:11.120 --> 3:11:17.520]  making such racist comment comments i think he should resign he should resign yeah it's enough
[3:11:17.520 --> 3:11:23.760]  for him enough of him not liking mexican we like to try new yeah we need a speaker who likes
[3:11:23.760 --> 3:11:29.200]  mexican food right yeah sometimes we need to change do you support obama's calling for john
[3:11:29.200 --> 3:11:34.720]  bainer to step down over his racist comments about not liking mexican food made on synco de mayo
[3:11:34.720 --> 3:11:39.200]  of all days i don't i don't that kind of racism be tolerated today i don't i don't i don't really
[3:11:39.200 --> 3:11:43.600]  think so no i don't i don't think that kind of races he should definitely step down what is he
[3:11:43.600 --> 3:11:47.840]  talking about not liking mexican food that's an obvious thing you know we can't have a speaker
[3:11:47.840 --> 3:11:50.720]  the house that doesn't need mexican food he's obviously a racist he should get out of there
[3:11:50.720 --> 3:11:55.760]  anyway we should support obama's decision especially when everybody likes it so i mean
[3:11:55.760 --> 3:12:01.760]  so you would agree with obama that that's a coded racist term on synco de mayo nonetheless anybody
[3:12:01.760 --> 3:12:08.160]  that still thinks races man during the dark ages still yeah you're not eating mexican food and
[3:12:08.160 --> 3:12:13.840]  in the new world order period man you are a racist yeah your taste buds are racist they'll make races
[3:12:13.840 --> 3:12:18.080]  no matter what man if you're if you're part back in the ages you're gonna make racist comments
[3:12:18.080 --> 3:12:22.960]  no matter what on synco de mayo saying he doesn't eat mexican food of all the days what an insult
[3:12:22.960 --> 3:12:28.320]  to the mexican people for obama's decision to have bainer step down or maybe be be you know punished
[3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:34.400]  for for making racist comments about not eating mexican food on synco de mayo i think that a
[3:12:34.400 --> 3:12:41.840]  stand should he should take a stand and he should take it swiftly so um as soon as just get bainer
[3:12:41.840 --> 3:12:48.000]  out get that racist just get it get the person out and then make an example of it and then that
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:53.840]  way he's at least taking a step towards eliminating those comments in the future from people that may
[3:12:54.640 --> 3:12:59.120]  feel like like they want to say something like that and then go out for tacos after we throw
[3:12:59.120 --> 3:13:06.080]  john bainer out that's what i would do yeah carnea sada yeah okay a lot of the democrats are calling
[3:13:06.080 --> 3:13:11.760]  for john bainer to to resign over his racist comments about mexican food not liking mexican
[3:13:11.760 --> 3:13:16.080]  food do you think that that's the right thing to do is have him just step down should we really
[3:13:16.080 --> 3:13:21.840]  be tolerating such bigotry today probably not probably not so he should step down yeah did you
[3:13:21.840 --> 3:13:26.960]  hear about john bainer's racist comments about not liking mexican food a lot of the democrats are
[3:13:26.960 --> 3:13:33.280]  calling for him to resign for his racist statements do you think that we should tolerate that that
[3:13:33.280 --> 3:13:36.800]  shouldn't be not tolerance but i really haven't heard about it so do you think it's the right thing
[3:13:36.800 --> 3:13:41.440]  to have him step down over those that those racist comments they should he should yeah he should step
[3:13:41.440 --> 3:13:48.080]  down for not liking that we agree hey alabama thank you what do you think about john bainer
[3:13:48.080 --> 3:13:53.120]  saying his racist comments that he doesn't like eating mexican food i didn't see that so he tolerates
[3:13:53.120 --> 3:13:59.680]  such bigotry in the congress not eating mexican food is not racist yeah that's that's incredible
[3:13:59.680 --> 3:14:03.760]  in today's society for him to say such a thing like that i mean that's absurd can you believe that
[3:14:03.760 --> 3:14:07.680]  no i think it's absurd i think so you think that he should be maybe thrown out of office then and
[3:14:07.680 --> 3:14:12.240]  no of course not but you just said it was absurd absurd just think that it's racist to not like
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:17.200]  mexican food that's absurd well that's i don't like italian food but i don't hate italians
[3:14:17.840 --> 3:14:21.600]  you can think that kind of thing but in in the new world order you're not allowed to say
[3:14:21.600 --> 3:14:26.720]  those things try lateral commission and all that stuff yeah that's an absurd world that is or this
[3:14:26.720 --> 3:14:43.600]  we're trying does the term public servant sound like an anachronism to you something from a bygone
[3:14:43.600 --> 3:14:49.280]  error where people believe that the government worked for them when they paid the salaries they
[3:14:49.280 --> 3:14:54.960]  believe they were the masters well the mindset among most people in government today appears to be
[3:14:54.960 --> 3:15:01.840]  that they are the masters we are the slaves and many of the slaves have that same attitude
[3:15:01.840 --> 3:15:06.560]  take the story out of louisiana a mother's concern when her asthmatic son turns red
[3:15:06.560 --> 3:15:12.000]  complaints of chest pains so she calls for an ambulance now the ms personnel don't show much
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:16.240]  concern for his medical condition in fact even though he's pointing to his chest according to
[3:15:16.240 --> 3:15:20.640]  the mother they say well he's pointing to his stomach so he's not having any chest issues or
[3:15:20.640 --> 3:15:26.560]  asthma conditions and then they start to ask why he's not in school when they find out that he's
[3:15:26.560 --> 3:15:32.080]  homeschooled they begin an inspection of the house taken back by this she confronts these
[3:15:32.080 --> 3:15:38.400]  ems personnel they say well we're agents of the state so she calls a supervisor and complaints
[3:15:38.400 --> 3:15:45.920]  and he says they're agents of the state now that's in louisiana in north carolina a sheriff
[3:15:45.920 --> 3:15:52.560]  is talking about the immense powers that he has over your life as part of his election campaign
[3:15:52.560 --> 3:15:57.680]  an article from louis rockwell's blog that's on info wars sheriff ed brown the delusional
[3:15:57.680 --> 3:16:03.360]  dictator of onslaught county north carolina he writes on his election flyer the vast majority
[3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:08.720]  of our duties and functions are performed with only our conscience watching and directing us
[3:16:08.720 --> 3:16:14.000]  and that's a big part of the problem we see over and over again that violent confrontations with
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:21.360]  the public unjustifiable violence and brutality against the public is rarely if ever disciplined
[3:16:21.360 --> 3:16:26.480]  against the officers who commit these offenses they're protected by the police department
[3:16:26.480 --> 3:16:32.720]  or by the unions rarely does anything ever happen to them so they get this message loud and clear
[3:16:32.720 --> 3:16:37.760]  this is the rest of his flyer those in the law enforcement profession have complete power over
[3:16:37.760 --> 3:16:44.960]  you your life your family your loved ones your rights your freedom your future everything precious
[3:16:44.960 --> 3:16:53.120]  to life from the very word of a law enforcement officer all those precious things of life hang
[3:16:53.840 --> 3:16:59.440]  we've seen over and over again that attitude not only from law enforcement but from every
[3:16:59.440 --> 3:17:05.840]  government agency that they have complete power over you your life your family everything
[3:17:05.840 --> 3:17:11.440]  hangs by a thread hangs by their discretion that they're not accountable to anyone were those
[3:17:11.440 --> 3:17:18.160]  remarks out of context were they misconstrued actually sheriff brown supporters have essentially
[3:17:18.160 --> 3:17:23.360]  doubled down on his remarks here's what one person wrote to a newspaper officers can ask
[3:17:23.360 --> 3:17:28.320]  you to get out of their car they can handcuff you to protect themselves they have a lot of power
[3:17:28.320 --> 3:17:34.160]  over your life if you're in a dangerous situation your life is in their hands no actually he got
[3:17:34.160 --> 3:17:41.040]  that wrong if your life is in their hands you're in a dangerous situation this sheriff is up for
[3:17:41.040 --> 3:17:47.360]  reelection this Tuesday and look at what he did at a forum where he's debating his opponent he
[3:17:47.360 --> 3:17:52.640]  actually accused his political opponent of being involved in bombing threats that were carried out
[3:17:52.640 --> 3:17:58.400]  by an 18 year old the way that he made these threats was with a threatening phone call which was
[3:17:58.400 --> 3:18:10.640]  recorded you hear brown on the phone with his longtime friend and challenger haunts miller
[3:18:10.640 --> 3:18:18.000]  when somebody makes false allegations without corroboration uh that to me is a loss of integrity
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:22.640]  and integrity once lost can never be gained back that's right he makes these vague threats and he
[3:18:22.640 --> 3:18:27.360]  says well i don't know what to make of this i'm just don't have to call in the media and let them
[3:18:27.360 --> 3:18:33.760]  decide whether this is true or not a threat trying to get the guy to back off i find there is absolutely
[3:18:33.760 --> 3:18:39.840]  no credible evidence to support such an allegation against haunts miller or his campaign but of course
[3:18:39.840 --> 3:18:44.800]  the district attorney says it is totally unprofessional and it's not the first unprofessional thing
[3:18:44.800 --> 3:18:51.120]  this guy has done this now borders on the ridiculous the same north carolina sheriff
[3:18:51.120 --> 3:18:57.760]  brown of onslaught county used a wire hanger as a dividing rod to search for a buried body
[3:18:58.560 --> 3:19:03.520]  now this is being reported by the sbi the state bureau of investigation north carolina
[3:19:03.520 --> 3:19:08.240]  and what he did was he took this dividing rod and he walked back and forth over the area so much
[3:19:08.240 --> 3:19:14.800]  that he erased any footprints hampering the investigation so the question is though who is
[3:19:14.800 --> 3:19:24.640]  dumber this sheriff or the people who will vote for him all right we're skipping this network
[3:19:24.640 --> 3:19:29.360]  breaking on right to your calls we had some tricaster computer breakups earlier that's
[3:19:29.360 --> 3:19:33.920]  why we went to rebroadcast for a while and that happened sometimes with live radio and
[3:19:33.920 --> 3:19:37.840]  everybody understands that's why i've had you sitting on a whole great job uh with the crew in
[3:19:37.840 --> 3:19:43.680]  there but i'm glad we got to some of those reports that the guys have been filing i mean you sit there
[3:19:43.680 --> 3:19:48.800]  and you see the way the sheriff acts it's government on a power trip believing they're infallible it's
[3:19:48.800 --> 3:19:55.680]  like tsa workers repeatedly have declared themselves god started trying to rape women in one case
[3:19:55.680 --> 3:20:01.440]  another case at lax the guy strips down naked and starts running around screaming i'm god i mean
[3:20:01.440 --> 3:20:06.960]  these are people who couldn't get a job at mcdonald's and now they're bossing people around all day
[3:20:06.960 --> 3:20:15.680]  only a mental midget would want a job dominating good people all day and so that's what we're getting
[3:20:15.680 --> 3:20:21.600]  as the bureaucracy looks for the type of people that will become oppressors
[3:20:23.440 --> 3:20:30.000]  is people that are so mentally stunted it never gets old to boss people around for no reason and
[3:20:30.000 --> 3:20:35.600]  to bug their eyes out at you and to start fights all right adam kathy lisa and mark and that's it
[3:20:35.600 --> 3:20:40.320]  for the transmission thanks for holding adam you're on the air go ahead hey alex can you hear me
[3:20:40.320 --> 3:20:45.920]  i'm good sir yes thanks for calling all right yeah so um you you ask like what do we think is
[3:20:45.920 --> 3:20:50.400]  going to happen you know as time progresses and as you said like you know a lot happens more in
[3:20:50.400 --> 3:20:54.560]  a month than you know 10 years or decades and stuff like that um i think you're right there's
[3:20:54.560 --> 3:20:59.040]  going to be stage there attacks they're going to blame the liberty movement um and you know
[3:20:59.040 --> 3:21:03.520]  martial laws are going to happen and maybe you know world wars will start um when that happens
[3:21:03.520 --> 3:21:08.160]  we don't know what to do but we can be sure that what happened you know like you said the bible
[3:21:08.160 --> 3:21:14.240]  is right you know revelation is true um and what what is being said but i wanted to tell you uh that
[3:21:15.040 --> 3:21:19.920]  one thing that the new world order has lied to people about is that you have another enemy
[3:21:19.920 --> 3:21:25.200]  and then they point to that enemy as a muslims um and what most christians don't know and i i know
[3:21:25.200 --> 3:21:29.920]  you're a believing man you seem like a you know a man serving god's purpose and i can make sure it's
[3:21:29.920 --> 3:21:35.200]  the same god for going back to abraham exactly no definitely and and one thing i want to show you
[3:21:35.200 --> 3:21:39.920]  like one verse in the Quran that it says you know uh and you will find the rest the nearest of them
[3:21:39.920 --> 3:21:45.520]  in affection to the believers those who say we are christians that is because among them are priests
[3:21:45.520 --> 3:21:50.880]  and monks and believers because they are not arrogant so you know i i i see you as a brother
[3:21:50.880 --> 3:21:56.160]  in that struggle um muslims also believe the return of jesus christ as well uh we believe in the
[3:21:56.160 --> 3:22:01.600]  anti christ uh we believe that you know jesus healed uh blind and the lepers and he walked on
[3:22:01.600 --> 3:22:05.680]  water all through god's will this is the divinity that we'd like to disagree with and and that's
[3:22:05.680 --> 3:22:10.800]  fine but after right now what we have to understand is that there are 1.6 billion muslims there are
[3:22:10.800 --> 3:22:16.000]  2.3 or so you know billion christian in the world that's 4 to 5 billion people you know that you have
[3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:20.640]  against the globalists that know what's coming or maybe they're just a little bit distracted
[3:22:20.640 --> 3:22:24.640]  but the truth is that you know we are all you know brothers and sisters of adam
[3:22:24.640 --> 3:22:30.640]  and that we are all you know uh we are our ancestors as well as we are you know our offspring
[3:22:30.640 --> 3:22:36.800]  um well there's no doubt that they're trying to radicalize christianity to just be you know a
[3:22:36.800 --> 3:22:41.040]  globalist tool and they're trying to radicalize and and and fund some of the some of the groups
[3:22:41.600 --> 3:22:47.360]  in islam those jihadis are not muslim by the way like obviously those guys do not follow
[3:22:47.360 --> 3:22:51.760]  what i was about to say i mean i mean the pentagon and wezzly clark's talked about this and we have
[3:22:51.760 --> 3:22:56.240]  the penac documents the plan is to have christians and muslims kill each other they call it the
[3:22:56.240 --> 3:23:02.080]  class of civilizations while the globalists sit on top doing it and look at how obama is turning
[3:23:02.080 --> 3:23:07.760]  the jihadis loose everywhere why not give them another peace prize it just shows it's chaos just
[3:23:07.760 --> 3:23:12.160]  like you're playing one group off against another great points i appreciate your call one more thing
[3:23:12.160 --> 3:23:17.120]  the one more thing to uh to say to your viewers um 30 percent of these ways that came from west
[3:23:17.120 --> 3:23:22.000]  africa here at the united states were muslim and so they're muslims fighting the revolutionary war
[3:23:22.000 --> 3:23:27.120]  so you know god bless america god bless you and god bless us all you mean well i think we all should
[3:23:27.120 --> 3:23:30.800]  work together towards the basic liberty and freedom and bill of rights and constitution
[3:23:30.800 --> 3:23:35.760]  and that the globalists do want to divide us but then they come in with a false system and say no
[3:23:35.760 --> 3:23:41.200]  everyone should give up their culture and merge into the globalist system they have a false equality
[3:23:41.200 --> 3:23:46.880]  equality means that we all get to have freedom it doesn't mean that we all have to agree with
[3:23:46.880 --> 3:23:54.000]  each other and i was against the iraq war i'm against it all uh and i understand what you're
[3:23:54.000 --> 3:24:00.320]  saying and and it's essential that we don't allow this class of civilizations but then if i say
[3:24:00.320 --> 3:24:05.600]  these radical is you know islamic fundamentalists they're being globalist directed are really bad
[3:24:05.600 --> 3:24:10.320]  people i see some muslims on info wars dot com saying oh you're attacking islam blah blah you know
[3:24:10.320 --> 3:24:17.200]  look i'm not attacking the western ukranians that are really over through the government
[3:24:17.200 --> 3:24:23.440]  are stirring all this up because they're christians it has nothing to do with it they're being manipulated
[3:24:23.440 --> 3:24:30.640]  as well the globalists will use surface differences and that's the thing there's always a third party
[3:24:30.640 --> 3:24:36.640]  it's not just muslim against christian or catholic against protestant or catholic against orthodox or
[3:24:36.640 --> 3:24:41.680]  whatever or atheist against christian or mexican against anglo or anglo against black or whatever
[3:24:42.480 --> 3:24:46.320]  it's all on the surface to get us fighting with each other i know everybody knows this
[3:24:46.960 --> 3:24:51.920]  while the globalists rob everything that's all i'm saying there are real differences there are
[3:24:51.920 --> 3:24:57.840]  issues there but the point is the globalists only bring it up to create a fight cathy in texas you're
[3:24:57.840 --> 3:25:06.160]  on the air thanks for holding you're absolutely correct alex absolutely correct can you hear
[3:25:06.160 --> 3:25:12.800]  me yes ma'am i can what's on your mind thanks for calling oh well to adam i would like to say
[3:25:12.800 --> 3:25:20.240]  i buy my raw milk from a muslim i'm not a bit afraid and i wanted to remind you alex that
[3:25:20.240 --> 3:25:28.800]  every time the evil ones try to drum up demons uh it plants this christians feet on the ground
[3:25:28.800 --> 3:25:37.200]  and she falls to her knees and prays at my charter uh it tells me that uh jesus christ our lord our
[3:25:37.200 --> 3:25:45.520]  savior is very alive and well where do you think well thank you where do you think the future of
[3:25:45.520 --> 3:25:52.080]  the world's going what's your gut tell you um i'm hoping my grandson won't ever have to die
[3:25:52.080 --> 3:25:59.840]  he'll live through the tribulation and straight on through the thousand years i hear you god bless
[3:25:59.840 --> 3:26:03.040]  you you have the biggest why in the bible and i don't want to get into sectarian fighting
[3:26:03.600 --> 3:26:06.640]  it's just the whole bible people have to go through stuff they don't get teleported out
[3:26:06.640 --> 3:26:14.720]  until they've already gone through a lot of it and clearly in the bible the devil wages war against
[3:26:14.720 --> 3:26:22.640]  the saints and all this persecution goes on and then at the end god rises up the dead in christ
[3:26:23.280 --> 3:26:28.720]  and that's what it says it doesn't say before it's like this total cop out hey this is too scary
[3:26:29.280 --> 3:26:34.640]  i mean the pre-tribulation stuff rapture is only about 180 years old no one ever taught that
[3:26:35.360 --> 3:26:43.280]  it's totally made up but they've made it like a a a a a sacrament of the protestant faith
[3:26:43.280 --> 3:26:47.440]  faith that that you're not a protestant if you don't push that and believe it
[3:26:49.200 --> 3:26:54.160]  and look all i know is you talk about a great deception coming upon people no who's going
[3:26:54.160 --> 3:26:58.160]  to fight the evil if everybody thinks oh that's fine you know we're going to get teleported out
[3:26:58.160 --> 3:27:03.920]  of this i said that doesn't make sense to me you're not going to go out and confront evil
[3:27:03.920 --> 3:27:10.800]  but god's going to take you out of it a lot of people in nazi germany thought he was the antichrist
[3:27:10.800 --> 3:27:16.400]  it was the end of the world so they rolled over to him didn't go too well they teach that it's a
[3:27:16.400 --> 3:27:20.640]  demonic what the founding fathers did fighting tyranny because you were supposed to just submit
[3:27:20.640 --> 3:27:25.280]  to it since the will of god that sounds like hinduism or something that you're supposed to
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:30.400]  be born in squalor and it's your life and you're supposed to have nothing because you're in a lower
[3:27:30.400 --> 3:27:37.120]  caste god helps those that help themselves i know that you do the right thing you go up against
[3:27:37.120 --> 3:27:42.160]  an enemy bigger than you time and time again with courage god will do things for you and give you
[3:27:42.160 --> 3:27:47.120]  providence but it doesn't happen until you make the connection like electricity you got to reach
[3:27:47.120 --> 3:27:51.920]  out to god then god will reach out the rest of the way i've experienced that you've got to make
[3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:57.200]  you don't just magically think something you go out and you do it that's the secret folks they
[3:27:57.200 --> 3:28:01.600]  got books about the secret where you imagine something and it happens no you have to do it
[3:28:01.600 --> 3:28:08.320]  and it has to be good as well let's talk to lisa in vermont lisa you're on the air go ahead thanks
