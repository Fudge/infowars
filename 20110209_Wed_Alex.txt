[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:31.360]  Texas Alex Jones well I've decided today to have wide open and telephones also
[00:31.360 --> 00:35.000]  later in the third hour I'm gonna make some calls to Homeland Security see
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.920]  something say something we've called multiple numbers that they put out
[00:38.920 --> 00:44.680]  publicly and the voicemail doesn't even declare that it is Homeland Security and
[00:44.680 --> 00:50.260]  if the terror threat is so imminent that we could all basically be killed by
[00:50.260 --> 00:54.280]  evil terrorists hiding under our beds if we don't give off all of our freedoms
[00:54.280 --> 00:59.600]  up to the bankers then why aren't they answering their phones and if the
[00:59.600 --> 01:05.160]  Homeland Security numbers don't work I will move on to the FBI and I will a
[01:05.160 --> 01:10.480]  declare to them if they're not answering their phones and I will be go on and
[01:10.480 --> 01:15.960]  cover issues of real evidence of corporate and government sponsored
[01:15.960 --> 01:20.640]  terrorism you see something you say something we all need to stand up and
[01:20.640 --> 01:24.680]  talk about Operation Northwoods the official US government plan to stage
[01:24.680 --> 01:34.440]  9-11 style attacks we all need to expose that they lied about WMDs to get us
[01:34.440 --> 01:39.880]  into the war which itself was a false flag attack it was a psychological
[01:39.880 --> 01:44.720]  false flag attack oh my gosh Saddam can nuke England in 45 minutes he may be
[01:44.720 --> 01:49.360]  able to nuke the US he's got nukes he's got all this stuff we know we sold him
[01:49.360 --> 01:53.520]  to him you know we sold we got the receipts for the Kim and bio weapons
[01:53.520 --> 02:00.720]  on and on and on so we need to continue to point this out and engage government
[02:00.720 --> 02:06.760]  and not be afraid of these federal agents and basically accept the false
[02:06.760 --> 02:11.400]  Hollywood image that there are these invincible men in black and that we're
[02:11.400 --> 02:16.240]  somehow all guilty of something and we've all done something wrong and so oh
[02:16.240 --> 02:22.000]  my gosh it's so scary to call the FBI it's so scary to call Homeland Security
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.840]  you know I've noticed just scanning over comments on Info Wars and Prison
[02:25.840 --> 02:33.720]  Planet since I called Homeland Security on Sunday and the phone number picked up
[02:33.720 --> 02:37.360]  that went to a computer voicemail a number we'd called months before a
[02:37.360 --> 02:40.960]  number that's publicly listed on the Homeland Security website and it just
[02:40.960 --> 02:45.120]  went to a robot answering system not even declaring that it was Homeland
[02:45.120 --> 02:50.400]  Security and I noticed that people couldn't believe it was real because they
[02:50.400 --> 02:54.360]  can't believe that someone would actually call the government it's kind of
[02:54.360 --> 02:58.320]  like when I shot video Marines training for gun confiscation and for the arrest
[02:58.320 --> 03:05.000]  of Americans with foreign troops in Oakland California in 99 most people
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.800]  who were kind of mainline TV heads who were uninformed thought it was fake
[03:10.800 --> 03:16.720]  video the Coronado landing hovercraft landing warrior fighting vehicles a
[03:16.720 --> 03:20.880]  thousand plus Marines hundreds and hundreds of foreign troops they thought
[03:20.880 --> 03:27.400]  it was fake I mean I still get emails saying I'm lying about cross species
[03:27.400 --> 03:32.680]  monkeys with jellyfish or goats with spiders doesn't matter there's hundreds
[03:32.680 --> 03:40.280]  of mainstream news articles I'm a liar I still get calls saying Gardasil has
[03:40.280 --> 03:44.400]  never killed anybody that vaccine when it's admittedly killed close to a hundred
[03:44.400 --> 03:50.000]  people on record and maimed thousands and it's admitted it's done that there's
[03:50.000 --> 03:55.160]  just so much denial I've had people in public come up to me and say I heard you
[03:55.160 --> 03:59.280]  say that schools are watching kids over their government-issued laptops I don't
[03:59.280 --> 04:04.880]  believe that they'd never do that and I'm like but it's CNN it's Reuters it's
[04:04.880 --> 04:09.520]  Philadelphia Daily News I mean it's it's it's everywhere and they just go no it's
[04:09.520 --> 04:15.560]  not no it's not you know you didn't call Homeland Security you didn't call the
[04:15.560 --> 04:19.000]  White House we're gonna call the White House to today you didn't call the

[04:28.480 --> 04:33.480]  could call the White House that you could call Congress that you could do
[04:33.480 --> 04:38.040]  something so many people can't believe this show because they don't believe in
[04:38.040 --> 04:43.320]  themselves I mean it's amazing I had George Norrie on one of many you know
[04:43.320 --> 04:46.520]  high-powered guests we interview and people they're all over the web saying
[04:46.520 --> 04:50.120]  that what George Norrie wasn't on people say Willie Nelson hasn't been on
[04:50.120 --> 04:54.900]  Charlie Sheen just even turn it's all fake the calls are all fake we screen the
[04:54.900 --> 04:58.000]  calls when we don't I mean it's just all lies I'll get into all the news when we

[07:02.600 --> 07:06.960]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[07:06.960 --> 07:11.320]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[07:11.320 --> 07:15.600]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:15.600 --> 07:19.960]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:19.960 --> 07:24.000]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.600]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:28.600 --> 07:32.720]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:32.720 --> 07:36.680]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:36.680 --> 07:40.520]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:40.520 --> 07:43.240]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[07:43.240 --> 07:49.240]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[08:07.800 --> 08:15.240]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the
[08:15.240 --> 08:29.040]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it is the ninth
[08:29.040 --> 08:35.360]  day of February 2011 on this live at Wednesday edition we are going to have
[08:35.360 --> 08:39.880]  open phones throughout the broadcast today you're welcome to call in about
[08:39.880 --> 08:44.680]  government carbon tax systems trying to shut down and successfully shutting
[08:44.680 --> 08:49.080]  down existing power plants blocking the firing up of new ones that have been
[08:49.080 --> 08:53.440]  completed in places like Corpus Christi Texas the White House responding to us
[08:53.440 --> 08:57.400]  last Friday I talked about it some Sunday but not really since then but
[08:57.400 --> 09:03.200]  that shows the power of the alternative media that they're now having to respond
[09:03.200 --> 09:08.920]  obviously the situation in Egypt what's happening with the economy but more
[09:08.920 --> 09:14.640]  importantly all the good news that's happening the World Health Organization
[09:14.640 --> 09:22.720]  is probing swine flu narcolepsy concerns and it goes on to report that
[09:22.720 --> 09:30.760]  multiple countries are reporting that people are having increased seizures
[09:30.760 --> 09:34.720]  Guillain-Barre and of course in narcolepsy which is another neurological
[09:34.720 --> 09:39.120]  disorder where you just pass out you be driving your car you could be sitting
[09:39.120 --> 09:45.000]  there on the sidewalk waiting for a bus and you just pass out for a few minutes
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.800]  and this is being reported all over the world 12 countries have reported
[09:49.800 --> 09:54.140]  suspected cases of narcolepsy linked to swine flu jabs the World Health
[09:54.140 --> 09:58.360]  Organization said on Tuesday as its scientists said the findings warranted
[09:58.360 --> 10:06.400]  more investigation more whitewashing that is and there's just so much evidence
[10:06.400 --> 10:14.280]  of this and we warned about it before the 2009 2010 hysteria going through that
[10:14.280 --> 10:19.360]  winter at the end of 09 the beginning of 010 because we're not rocket
[10:19.360 --> 10:23.880]  scientists here but we happen to follow vaccines and we happen to read the
[10:23.880 --> 10:30.360]  inserts that says it's been linked to Guillain-Barre narcolepsy and the onset
[10:30.360 --> 10:36.520]  of seizures and other neurological disorders I mean gee if I buy a box of
[10:36.520 --> 10:41.800]  cereal and it says it has wheat in it I'm not smart when I say this cereal has
[10:41.800 --> 10:49.040]  wheat in it I mean it's that's what's so frustrating is that the media runs
[10:49.040 --> 10:52.880]  around with these hoaxes saying Dr. Wakefield's been discredited he's been
[10:52.880 --> 10:57.120]  discredited and he stands up says no I haven't you lied and said I made this up
[10:57.120 --> 11:01.720]  here's another British medical team prestigious that found the exact same
[11:01.720 --> 11:06.600]  thing before I did he just didn't know until now that someone previous to him
[11:06.600 --> 11:09.680]  had discovered it of course what I said before that came out a few weeks ago I
[11:09.680 --> 11:13.440]  said I've read about this in medical reports before Wakefield discovered it
[11:13.440 --> 11:21.520]  in the late 90s Wakefield is just well-spoken and prestigious and got Jenny
[11:21.520 --> 11:24.760]  McCarthy involved in others so they looked at him as kind of the figure head
[11:24.760 --> 11:30.480]  to attack but they run these hoaxes and I expect for them to run another hoax now
[11:30.480 --> 11:35.200]  saying it's a hoax no connection to narcolepsy no connection to Guillain-Barre
[11:35.200 --> 11:42.320]  really I can go down to the Walgreens and say can I have a vaccine flu vaccine
[11:42.320 --> 11:47.360]  shot oh but before I do that can I have a little insert oh no no not the fact
[11:47.360 --> 11:51.040]  sheet you try to give me that you've printed up or the federal government's
[11:51.040 --> 11:54.600]  put out for you to issue that's got a bunch of propaganda I want the little
[11:54.600 --> 11:59.520]  white paper you unfold with the 20-something paragraphs on it that's
[11:59.520 --> 12:03.200]  got the whole molecular breakdown I want that of course you can read those
[12:03.200 --> 12:10.000]  online as well I mean it's like these drug ads I was watching some drug ad
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.760]  online last night I was watching ABC news clip on their website and it was like a
[12:14.760 --> 12:21.280]  minute ad for this drug and and the drug is for eczema and it said now this
[12:21.280 --> 12:24.680]  turns off your immune system and may cause you to get cancer because your
[12:24.680 --> 12:27.680]  immune system is what defeats cancer and when it stops working that's when you
[12:27.680 --> 12:32.640]  get the cancer we're all getting cancer routinely that's a fact that's why it's
[12:32.640 --> 12:35.960]  so dangerous they're pushing for universal cancer screening for cancer
[12:35.960 --> 12:42.960]  cells and now the a lot of scientists have reported that that millions of
[12:42.960 --> 12:46.240]  people are gonna end up being diagnosed with cancer don't really have it they're
[12:46.240 --> 12:51.720]  gonna be put on chemo which itself might beat the cancer for a while but then
[12:51.720 --> 12:57.120]  causes all these other cancers particularly leukemias in the blood but
[12:57.120 --> 13:00.120]  but I already know all of this the medical doctors have interviewed have
[13:00.120 --> 13:04.800]  taught me this the the research has taught me this but to sit there and watch
[13:04.800 --> 13:12.400]  a drug ad and it says yeah you got eczema you got psoriasis you know you've
[13:12.400 --> 13:17.840]  got flaking skin this thing in nine weeks you know we see a massive increase
[13:17.840 --> 13:23.480]  in in in the people reducing their eczema and it showed people on airplanes
[13:23.480 --> 13:28.080]  smiling and made no sense boy there and then it went through all the problems
[13:28.080 --> 13:32.720]  oh this may cause you to have a heart attack this may cause you to get cancer
[13:32.720 --> 13:36.040]  because it turns off your immune system if you've had vaccines lately don't take
[13:36.040 --> 13:42.360]  it you know if you've got you also need to be tested for tuberculosis yeah but
[13:42.360 --> 13:45.640]  because if it turns off your immune system and that tuberculosis will start
[13:45.640 --> 13:50.760]  growing I mean this is crazy and it's exactly what pharmacist Ben Fuchs was
[13:50.760 --> 13:54.720]  talking about us last Friday that most of these drugs turn off the immune system
[13:54.720 --> 14:00.600]  they turn off the immune system and there are so many other dangerous
[14:00.600 --> 14:05.760]  ramifications associated with that it's like the studies that have linked
[14:05.760 --> 14:10.800]  frequent use of antibiotics to cancer well of course I mean if this stuff is
[14:10.800 --> 14:15.880]  powerful enough to kill bacteria in your body and sure you've got a gunshot wound
[14:15.880 --> 14:18.880]  and puss is coming out of it two weeks later and they said they're going to cut
[14:18.880 --> 14:23.520]  your leg off boom it's wonderful take it because it's worth the risk but these
[14:23.520 --> 14:28.040]  people just every time their child gets a cold boom they're at the doctor pumping
[14:28.040 --> 14:31.520]  it into them I mean most the kids I know in this country they're friends with my
[14:31.520 --> 14:37.520]  children they're on antibiotics every month it's just constant and it goes on
[14:37.520 --> 14:43.920]  and on and on one of my daughters for about two weeks you know got her lips
[14:43.920 --> 14:46.920]  got chapped and she got a little bit of eczema my wife said I'm gonna go ahead
[14:46.920 --> 14:50.360]  and take her to the doctor because we couldn't get rid of it because we want
[14:50.360 --> 14:53.640]  you know we couldn't make her wash it five or six times a day and just put
[14:53.640 --> 14:57.960]  some topical steroids on it which is what I was saying and so they give us
[14:57.960 --> 15:02.300]  this big bottle of antibiotics they didn't swab it to see what it was they
[15:02.300 --> 15:06.600]  just said you know take these antibiotics and I said honey you know what I'm
[15:06.600 --> 15:11.520]  gonna do I'm gonna obnoxiously ten times a day just over this weekend because I'm
[15:11.520 --> 15:16.680]  home now I'm gonna obnoxiously clean it it's a little bit spot and this is a few
[15:16.680 --> 15:21.400]  months ago because of the dry weather and I said I'm gonna put corticotypic
[15:21.400 --> 15:27.200]  cortisone on it okay and we're not gonna let her run around in the cold all this
[15:27.200 --> 15:31.360]  weekend like she likes to do and she's licking her lips boom two days later
[15:31.360 --> 15:36.640]  gone now they they just said you know here's the pink bottle of whatever type
[15:36.640 --> 15:41.520]  of liquid antibiotic it was just just oh we're not gonna swab it we don't even
[15:41.520 --> 15:45.400]  know what it is it's probably just some eczema dry skin but there might be some
[15:45.400 --> 15:51.880]  bacteria in there here just take this just assault her entire gut where the
[15:51.880 --> 15:56.560]  where the real flora is get rid of her natural buffers get rid of it all here's
[15:56.560 --> 16:01.440]  this here's this bottle just just just just take it and the truth is it didn't
[16:01.440 --> 16:05.000]  go away for a few weeks because I was only doing it in the morning and at night
[16:05.000 --> 16:12.120]  cleaning her face and applying a cream that weekend just every two hours boom
[16:12.120 --> 16:20.840]  button on but side issue I said I would get into all of this news we've got some
[16:20.840 --> 16:28.520]  really good news today some wonderful news obviously a it's coming out in AFP
[16:28.520 --> 16:34.920]  Reuters you name it that they're having to now basically investigate go ahead
[16:34.920 --> 16:37.600]  read the insert you'd have your investigation of course I've had the
[16:37.600 --> 16:43.120]  former head of the EU Health Commission on who did expose with their panel of

[24:22.640 --> 24:27.120]  Organization probes swine flu narcolepsy concerns 12 countries in Europe
[24:27.120 --> 24:33.040]  reporting it and on top of it also Australia's reporting deaths several
[24:33.040 --> 24:37.720]  other nations are as well again we're proven a hundred percent right we
[24:37.720 --> 24:42.400]  predicted all of this we're not rocket scientists it was all on the insert the
[24:42.400 --> 24:46.080]  devil is in the details they leave little provisos there to cover their
[24:46.080 --> 24:50.760]  hind ends because these vaccine makers are given immunity as long as they put
[24:50.760 --> 24:57.600]  it on the label hey you want to buy this poison go ahead continuing Calgary
[24:57.600 --> 25:02.760]  removing fluoride from water supply CBC Calgary City Council has voted 10 to 3
[25:02.760 --> 25:07.480]  in favor of removing fluoride from the city's drinking water Calgary City
[25:07.480 --> 25:10.800]  Council has voted 10 to 3 in favor of removing fluoride again from the water
[25:10.800 --> 25:19.560]  to members of council mayor knee-heed and Brian Pincott were out of town but it
[25:19.560 --> 25:25.680]  doesn't matter because it was the 10 to 3 vote and it continues there the
[25:25.680 --> 25:29.800]  council also rejected the idea of referring the matter to an expert panel
[25:29.800 --> 25:36.720]  yes of people paid off by the chemical industry since 1989 53% of Calgarings
[25:36.720 --> 25:40.400]  voted in favor of adding the fluoride back when they were brainwashed two years
[25:40.400 --> 25:44.960]  later it was added they're talking about at least banning it until there can be a
[25:44.960 --> 25:53.800]  plebiscite or a Greek style vote put to the city so the fight is certainly on
[25:53.800 --> 26:01.960]  there but you know under a democracy in 51% in Calgary or in New York or in
[26:01.960 --> 26:09.200]  Austin Texas vote to put a poison in the water it happens not in the Republic a
[26:09.200 --> 26:13.400]  democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner in a
[26:13.400 --> 26:18.600]  democracy 51% can vote to take the property the other 49 or to the extreme
[26:18.600 --> 26:23.600]  to put you in gas chambers if they wanted firing squads or to make you walk
[26:23.600 --> 26:28.160]  the plank whatever they want to put you in the end of a Saturn rocket and shoot
[26:28.160 --> 26:33.080]  you off the moon against your will in a democracy in a republic there's
[26:33.080 --> 26:38.160]  absolute rights of the individual that the mob or the corrupt government cannot
[26:38.160 --> 26:43.040]  take away that's the difference what have you given us mr. Franklin when they
[26:43.040 --> 26:47.160]  came out after the Declaration of Independence and he said a Republic
[26:47.160 --> 26:52.480]  madam if you can keep it and there were similar statements years later when
[26:52.480 --> 26:59.000]  they officially got the Constitution and Bill of Rights in place so that is
[26:59.000 --> 27:07.040]  certainly good news but the media is up in Canada is trying to spin it and this
[27:07.040 --> 27:11.440]  is a more fair article on Canada comm it says vote to rid city water fluoride
[27:11.440 --> 27:18.360]  passes but then the next article out of the Toronto Sun has a very grave
[27:18.360 --> 27:23.680]  statement it says Calgary could lose fluoride and it goes on to talk about
[27:23.680 --> 27:31.600]  all the poor children the poor poor children it's just terrible and of course
[27:31.600 --> 27:39.280]  as I mentioned earlier after 50 plus years that's what the San Diego paper
[27:39.280 --> 27:46.480]  reported of the federal government lobbying San Diego to put one part per
[27:46.480 --> 27:51.560]  million in the water they passed it finally last year and now because of
[27:51.560 --> 27:54.880]  scientific evidence brought in testimony by scientists and to the
[27:54.880 --> 27:58.840]  environmental board they're saying whoa whoa and their own technicians and
[27:58.840 --> 28:04.600]  engineers and toxicologist at the water treatment facility are saying see
[28:04.600 --> 28:09.080]  because the tide has turned so they're saying let's do an investigation here
[28:09.080 --> 28:13.640]  let's not go ahead and do this you realize the victories we're having and
[28:13.640 --> 28:17.720]  we can do the same thing on health care they're set to start stripping funding
[28:17.720 --> 28:23.640]  next week the Senate's already passed the shootdown of if you do $600 of total
[28:23.640 --> 28:27.920]  business a year selling beanie babies or pocket knives or whatever the case may be
[28:27.920 --> 28:33.240]  on eBay that you've now got to do a filing specifying each individual sale
[28:33.240 --> 28:38.120]  making us surveil ourselves guilty until proven innocent paying our taxes to the
[28:38.120 --> 28:44.120]  private Federal Reserve now here's the next piece of super good news but the
[28:44.120 --> 28:50.960]  globalist will respond to this you can be absolutely assured to try to
[28:50.960 --> 28:54.600]  discredit those of us out there that want to keep the Bill of Rights and
[28:54.600 --> 29:00.560]  Constitution you can be absolutely a hundred percent assured they are going
[29:00.560 --> 29:05.280]  to stage something some bombings they foil and they and watch they would have
[29:05.280 --> 29:09.480]  used the Patriot Act or sneak and peek or warrantless wiretapping to do it and
[29:09.480 --> 29:17.000]  they'll say see we stopped Habib Ahmed from doing this and we did it with a
[29:17.000 --> 29:23.360]  Patriot Act but it's now about to be rescinded watch look for that look for
[29:23.360 --> 29:28.600]  me you can you know what they're gonna do here's the good news ladies and

[34:50.840 --> 34:55.920]  freedom and that only comes through a dedication to liberty and a dedication to
[34:55.920 --> 35:03.720]  goodness that doesn't mean I'm on some moral high horse but the greatest moral
[35:03.720 --> 35:09.160]  factor is courage and that's something we're lacking but America that is the
[35:09.160 --> 35:14.080]  sleeping giant is awakening despite all the efforts of the social engineers and
[35:14.080 --> 35:21.160]  that is very very exciting now I just covered how all over the world and I've
[35:21.160 --> 35:24.960]  got other reports in Europe they're removing fluoride the people are going
[35:24.960 --> 35:29.160]  taking over their city councils they're going over and over again every week with
[35:29.160 --> 35:33.600]  scientists and doctors and citizens reading facts and the city council first
[35:33.600 --> 35:40.200]  laughs and then a year later they repeal it same thing in Austin months ago
[35:40.200 --> 35:44.160]  they were laughing about people not wanting the TSA sticking their hands
[35:44.160 --> 35:47.640]  down their pants at the Berkshire International Airport or the naked
[35:47.640 --> 35:52.360]  body scanners going in that's what's happened now the city transportation
[35:52.360 --> 35:56.920]  board has recommended that the scanners not be put in there there's groups
[35:56.920 --> 36:02.480]  forming I hear them running radio ads in Austin against it pointing out it's a
[36:02.480 --> 36:08.520]  police state it's incredible and and I could see my influence in this town on
[36:08.520 --> 36:12.480]  air for 16 years and I could see it in other cities and I could see your
[36:12.480 --> 36:17.080]  influence and those that have heard the call and have stood up and been leaders
[36:17.080 --> 36:21.280]  it's beautiful they're beginning to believe in themselves and in God's
[36:21.280 --> 36:24.920]  promise that if you stand up and do the right thing and tell the truth and go
[36:24.920 --> 36:30.240]  through the storm we will get delivered from the hands of our enemies like
[36:30.240 --> 36:38.600]  Daniel in that lion's den so all over the world it's coming out that the
[36:38.600 --> 36:41.960]  vaccines are killing people they're trying to spin it and claim of all the
[36:41.960 --> 36:44.960]  thousands of different studies and reports that it's all discredited because
[36:44.960 --> 36:49.240]  they say Wakefield's discredited with one study now his studies being
[36:49.240 --> 36:56.000]  duplicated from Japan to Italy from Germany to Canada their hoax is falling
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.440]  the polls show it the people are waking up the people are waking up and are
[37:01.440 --> 37:06.160]  becoming pro-second amendment all the polls show that total shift happening
[37:06.160 --> 37:09.840]  the people are waking up and becoming anti-abortion they're becoming pro-life
[37:09.840 --> 37:14.440]  it's happening and that's why the globalists try to pour on the cynicism
[37:14.440 --> 37:18.760]  the fake moralizing the bullying of the First Amendment it's why they're
[37:18.760 --> 37:22.680]  trying to announce internet kill switches and controls over talk radio
[37:22.680 --> 37:26.400]  because they're scared and they should be the globalists have committed a lot of
[37:26.400 --> 37:30.760]  crimes they've robbed this country up one side and down the other but people
[37:30.760 --> 37:39.800]  are finally responding and then of course I got into the fluoride situation
[37:39.800 --> 37:45.480]  I got into the vaccines being exposed and now this super important exciting
[37:45.480 --> 37:49.840]  news will go to your phone calls Patriot Act extension fails procedural vote
[37:49.840 --> 37:54.000]  expected to return a plan that would have seen the House representatives
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.920]  extend controversial provisions of the Patriot Act with little debate failed
[37:57.920 --> 38:02.680]  Tuesday night a group of Republicans joined a majority of Democrats in
[38:02.680 --> 38:11.480]  voting no the House voted 277 a beefy majority to 148 that is beefy that is
[38:11.480 --> 38:16.400]  getting close to supermajority the House voted 277 to 148 for the Patriot Act
[38:16.400 --> 38:23.360]  extension 23 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass it I
[38:23.360 --> 38:27.880]  guess I saw that wrong and and wanting the things to be more positive they are
[38:27.880 --> 38:36.360]  that they 277 voted to the 148 for no that's correct the House voted 277 to
[38:36.360 --> 38:44.040]  148 for the Patriot Act extension 23 votes short no so I am right most of them
[38:44.040 --> 38:48.120]  did actually vote for it but at least there's a 148 who are moral and one
[38:48.120 --> 38:58.920]  person who's in the right against a mob is in the wrong is a majority of one but
[38:58.920 --> 39:03.120]  it appears the bill was controversial enough to convince some two dozen tea
[39:03.120 --> 39:06.920]  party-backed Republican freshmen and that's a real sign that they're real
[39:06.920 --> 39:11.800]  that those are good people that they're not neocon police state warmonger
[39:11.800 --> 39:16.280]  tyranny pushers this is positive but it appears the bill was controversial
[39:16.280 --> 39:20.920]  enough to convince some two dozen tea party-backed Republican freshmen to join
[39:20.920 --> 39:24.240]  a majority of Democrats in voting against it the Hill reported the measure
[39:24.240 --> 39:27.480]  is now expected to return to the House floor for a regular vote that will
[39:27.480 --> 39:32.080]  require a simple majority to pass we've got to push we've got to do
[39:32.080 --> 39:38.520]  everything we can to pressure them to not fully extend it and of course I
[39:38.520 --> 39:42.520]  wrote the original analysis of the Patriot Act that won the project
[39:42.520 --> 39:48.800]  censored award in 2003 and a lot of lawyers read my analysis and actually
[39:48.800 --> 39:52.040]  hailed it they hadn't taken the time to read the hundreds of pages and look at
[39:52.040 --> 39:57.000]  the US code it listed but it basically got rid of about five of the ten of the
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.560]  bill of rights completely if they're able to implement it which they have to a
[40:00.560 --> 40:03.280]  certain extent it's one thing to pass something something to actually implement
[40:03.280 --> 40:07.440]  it and another two of the amendments it's seriously damaged and Patriot Act to
[40:07.440 --> 40:13.720]  would have gotten rid of everything but they didn't get that so we've had 800
[40:13.720 --> 40:18.480]  plus cities moved to block the Patriot Act locally and instruct the police and
[40:18.480 --> 40:21.400]  sheriff's deputies to follow the Constitution that's all it is as a
[40:21.400 --> 40:28.920]  pledge to the Constitution five states voted to override the Patriot Act a
[40:28.920 --> 40:33.320]  good states rights movement just like they're moving to block the unconstitutional
[40:33.320 --> 40:40.440]  government-run health care so a serious victory they may still pass it but this
[40:40.440 --> 40:43.800]  is the biggest challenge yet I mean what was the Patriot Act passed in the
[40:43.800 --> 40:56.320]  Senate 98 yeas one nay and one abstention in fact check me on that guys
[40:56.320 --> 41:03.200]  October 27th 2001 Patriot Act Senate vote tally Patriot Act Senate vote tally
[41:03.200 --> 41:07.320]  2001 that should pull it up it's it but but I know but I gotta test my memory
[41:07.320 --> 41:17.920]  here 98 yeas one no one nay and one abstention one you know I'm not gonna
[41:17.920 --> 41:23.680]  vote on it and you watch when they try to pass it in the Senate you're gonna see
[41:23.680 --> 41:29.000]  much larger numbers say no which shows we're repudiating it we're saying no to
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.040]  it it's a fraud it's a lie but if they're unable to ram it back through look
[41:33.040 --> 41:39.060]  for stage terror as a way to say see we told you so you didn't give us the
[41:39.060 --> 41:42.440]  police state so you caused this to happen it's your rights that caused this
[41:42.440 --> 41:46.000]  to happen well like Jesse Ventura says I'd rather face the danger than be a
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.080]  slave but I want to play a short video clip of Ron Paul on the House floor
[41:50.080 --> 41:54.360]  yesterday ahead of this being defeated and in the middle of the speech he gets
[41:54.360 --> 42:00.000]  the heart of the matter a point I've made at nauseam and that is that if
[42:00.000 --> 42:06.520]  government can sell the precept the idea that government must keep you safe
[42:06.520 --> 42:14.920]  from everything well government can't and and remember two weeks ago the state
[42:14.920 --> 42:22.640]  of Texas the county of Travis County settled for $48,000 and change I know
[42:22.640 --> 42:25.240]  I talk about this a lot but it's so incredible and I see these type of cases
[42:25.240 --> 42:28.240]  all the time now I know you do as well the woman was out with a group of bike
[42:28.240 --> 42:33.400]  riders in Travis County on a little two-lane country lane and you'll run
[42:33.400 --> 42:36.520]  into these gaggles of bike riders and they just they'll take over whole lanes
[42:36.520 --> 42:39.560]  sometimes you can't even get around them it's very dangerous dangerous for them
[42:39.560 --> 42:42.200]  dangerous for everybody else and I like bike riders it's just they think they
[42:42.200 --> 42:45.680]  own the road many of them it's like a cult they'll cut in front of you and get
[42:45.680 --> 42:49.040]  real aggressive and they're getting killed all the time I mean it's it's
[42:49.040 --> 42:53.400]  it's it's almost like bike riding rage or something hate to see them behind the
[42:53.400 --> 42:57.840]  wheel of their car but I don't know the particulars of this lady other than the
[42:57.840 --> 43:01.360]  fact that her filing said she was on the shoulder with a group of bike riders and
[43:01.360 --> 43:06.320]  hit a crack in the ground on the shoulder well of course those shoulders are
[43:06.320 --> 43:11.280]  rotten I mean we don't have money to hardly build roads in this country and
[43:11.280 --> 43:16.920]  so so she flipped off and broke her jaw and that's the taxpayers fault folks
[43:16.920 --> 43:21.840]  when you get on a bicycle you might get hurt when you go on a jet ski if
[43:21.840 --> 43:27.440]  somebody's on a jet ski and flies off and hurts themselves because they hit a
[43:27.440 --> 43:33.840]  wave will that will say it like Travis here in Austin will Travis County have
[43:33.840 --> 43:38.640]  to pay because they should have controlled the the waves out there you
[43:38.640 --> 43:46.560]  know that the person ran into this is a joke and so Ron Paul talks about the
[43:46.560 --> 43:50.800]  fact we have child abuse we have family violence do we put a camera in every
[43:50.800 --> 43:54.960]  home to ensure that this doesn't happen sure it might help somebody but at the
[43:54.960 --> 44:00.320]  cost of all of our freedoms and then in that vacuum of having no true privacy
[44:00.320 --> 44:04.560]  or freedom tyranny always fills it and corrupt individuals and government
[44:04.560 --> 44:09.080]  always use that to enslave and take people's money and take people's
[44:09.080 --> 44:13.760]  property and shut down their competition that's what tyranny's all about and then
[44:13.760 --> 44:18.160]  the old East Germany it's a historical film it's accurate to the letter they
[44:18.160 --> 44:25.520]  report it's the lives of others about a playwright in East Germany in the mid
[44:25.520 --> 44:30.960]  1980s and one of his other playwright friends has been banned from being able
[44:30.960 --> 44:35.600]  to put out plays because it wasn't communist enough and there's the minister
[44:35.600 --> 44:40.440]  of arts who demands to have sex with all the starlets if they want to sure you
[44:40.440 --> 44:45.000]  want to be able to be in East German TV or East German theater you've got to
[44:45.000 --> 44:49.880]  have sex with the commas arts I mean that's how this works and they decide
[44:49.880 --> 44:55.320]  what art you can have they decide what you can do that's why I'm against
[44:55.320 --> 45:01.400]  government incentives for art I'm all for just complete tax rebates but
[45:01.400 --> 45:09.440]  government can't have any control that was my issue with the film machete was
[45:09.440 --> 45:13.480]  that they were blocking films about Waco and things from getting funds because
[45:13.480 --> 45:16.680]  the government didn't want that made and not giving them you know millions of
[45:16.680 --> 45:21.040]  dollars of tax incentives but machete was clearly a la rica on quista la raza
[45:21.040 --> 45:26.880]  la invasora invasion takeover film Rodriguez is known to be into that
[45:26.880 --> 45:30.960]  stuff I got the internal script he went in the newspaper and said I was a liar
[45:30.960 --> 45:33.560]  that I didn't have a script and the movie came out and I have the exact
[45:33.560 --> 45:39.120]  script word for word I knew it was a script I got it from his people and then
[45:39.120 --> 45:45.240]  I separately got it from a Hollywood agent that sent it to me I had it in
[45:45.240 --> 45:50.440]  duplicate and I just said look we need to have the funding pulled if the state
[45:50.440 --> 45:55.400]  doesn't say we will no longer block funds to other people see you cannot have
[45:55.400 --> 46:00.000]  an incentive with government deciding because that gives them all the power
[46:00.000 --> 46:05.440]  and all the control but Ron Paul goes on to talk about liberty versus tyranny in
[46:05.440 --> 46:09.400]  his speech against the Patriot Act and you know the Houston police chief what
[46:09.400 --> 46:13.360]  four years ago you could just type into the search engine huge of police chief
[46:13.360 --> 46:18.640]  wants cameras and homes and he said yeah this will stop crime we want cameras and
[46:18.640 --> 46:23.440]  homes I remember three years ago and now it's over 20,000 homes when you have a
[46:23.440 --> 46:25.840]  newborn baby now in England they said we're going to put a camera in your
[46:25.840 --> 46:29.280]  house the first month and watch you feeding them bathing them and if we see
[46:29.280 --> 46:34.920]  any mistakes putting the diaper on giving them a bath feeding them any
[46:34.920 --> 46:47.320]  problems we're going to take your kid guilty until proven innocent here's
[46:47.320 --> 46:54.320]  another victory inexcusable delay on TSA bothers body scanner safety reports the
[46:54.320 --> 46:57.160]  transportation security administration has told members of Congress that more
[46:57.160 --> 47:03.680]  than 15 million passengers see full body scans at airports without any
[47:03.680 --> 47:06.880]  malfunctions that put travelers at risk of an excessive radiation dose
[47:06.880 --> 47:12.040]  despite the reassurance however the TSA is yet to release radiation inspection
[47:12.040 --> 47:16.000]  reports and they also haven't released the foyer to Bob Barr's group for its
[47:16.000 --> 47:19.840]  x-ray equipment two months after lawmakers called for them to make
[47:19.840 --> 47:25.840]  public following USA today's request she and what happens is TSA workers are
[47:25.840 --> 47:31.920]  saying hey I'm concerned I'm concerned about radiation and they say you're
[47:31.920 --> 47:37.120]  concerned you're fired you don't have a right under the federal government for
[47:37.120 --> 47:40.840]  job safety I thought they cared so much about our safety and it turns out they
[47:40.840 --> 47:44.920]  lied about the radiation one device gives you 20 times the other system they're
[47:44.920 --> 47:49.600]  selling 50 times conservatively New York Times admits the radiation they first
[47:49.600 --> 47:53.920]  said I mean ladies and gentlemen have you looked at the photos from the tests
[47:53.920 --> 47:59.320]  that they the TSA has released where in the in the images of the scans you can
[47:59.320 --> 48:04.800]  see the bones and people's fingers that's the equivalent of a dental x-ray it
[48:04.800 --> 48:10.880]  is shooting through their hand sure it's not shooting through the chest and the
[48:10.880 --> 48:14.200]  clothing but it's going to shoot through and you know an inch of clothing a
[48:14.200 --> 48:17.600]  couple layers of clothing it's going to shoot through your flesh and they
[48:17.600 --> 48:23.720]  admit it's the type of radiation that vibrates DNA and and causes it to
[48:23.720 --> 48:27.920]  break down it's very very dangerous and they're saying that they're going to
[48:27.920 --> 48:32.200]  make people do this and there are revolts everywhere and you know our
[48:32.200 --> 48:35.680]  revolt against the TSA's body scanners have been going on for over a year I had
[48:35.680 --> 48:40.440]  a contest a year ago for videos exposing it and you notice it didn't
[48:40.440 --> 48:44.560]  immediately stop them but then we started beating the drum four months
[48:44.560 --> 48:46.880]  ago again and it became one of the biggest stories in the world for a
[48:46.880 --> 48:50.600]  month and that didn't beat them completely but more and more it began
[48:50.600 --> 48:55.480]  almost like your arm wrestling if you don't when your arm wrestling if you
[48:55.480 --> 48:59.520]  don't push and put everything you've got into it you know you're not going to
[48:59.520 --> 49:03.800]  win I'm just saying gut up think about your family and put every bit of force
[49:03.800 --> 49:07.680]  you've got into it you know they've actually done university studies where
[49:07.680 --> 49:11.960]  you know if a woman thinks her child's going to be hurt she can beat a big man
[49:11.960 --> 49:16.960]  you know at arm wrestling because she's the one that's challenged she's the one
[49:16.960 --> 49:22.560]  that's defending you know the confirmed reports by police for over 60 years of a
[49:22.560 --> 49:27.360]  woman's baby will be trapped under a car and the woman will go insane and power
[49:27.360 --> 49:31.800]  squat the car off and police are like we just saw the incredible Hulk the brain
[49:31.800 --> 49:37.400]  has an automatic governor in it talk about jet skis they've got a Kawasaki
[49:37.400 --> 49:42.720]  turbo jet ski I was reading about that'll go 70 miles an hour and it gives
[49:42.720 --> 49:47.600]  you 14% of the power that the engine actually has and they do that because
[49:47.600 --> 49:51.800]  they want the torque to pull up upwards of three skiers out with a jet ski but
[49:51.800 --> 49:54.760]  they can't give you the full power or the thing I go 150 miles an hour and
[49:54.760 --> 50:02.360]  kill people it's the same thing you're like a Kawasaki turbo jet ski you have
[50:02.360 --> 50:06.960]  only got about 14% of the power and they've done hypnosis with Olympic
[50:06.960 --> 50:10.960]  weightlifters that if they can really get somebody hypnotized but it's not
[50:10.960 --> 50:15.880]  legal to do you know the regulations you know in the Olympics but some of them
[50:15.880 --> 50:19.680]  secretly still try to go back and get hypnotized and they train themselves to
[50:19.680 --> 50:23.520]  be able to become hypnotized to get past that governor and that's how they
[50:23.520 --> 50:27.000]  just keep breaking breaking breaking breaking records it's the same thing of
[50:27.000 --> 50:30.880]  a woman her kids squealing mommy mommy mommy and the woman just goes into pure
[50:30.880 --> 50:36.720]  blackout just goes yeah just lifts the car up well it's the same thing in the
[50:36.720 --> 50:39.840]  fight against tyranny you got to want it you got to commit you got to think
[50:39.840 --> 50:43.360]  about victory and form that in your mind and then put it into actions I

[54:13.320 --> 54:18.480]  greater chance of beating Obama than Sarah Palin does in 2012 he is in many
[54:18.480 --> 54:24.880]  scientific polls including the latest brass music number one in other brass
[54:24.880 --> 54:29.200]  music polls he's number two under Mitt Romney you know she doesn't have a
[54:29.200 --> 54:34.840]  perfect voting record but just politically she is anti-New World Order
[54:34.840 --> 54:40.000]  Michelle Bachman would be a great running mate with Ron Paul I hope when
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.000]  he runs and you can better believe he's gonna run that he gets somebody really
[54:44.000 --> 54:48.360]  strong that's kind of got that electric pizzazz and it's gonna be the the
[54:48.360 --> 54:54.400]  election of women with Hillary probably running with Palin obviously running and
[54:54.400 --> 55:01.200]  just in political strategy Bachman is a good choice I'm just telling you right
[55:01.200 --> 55:07.000]  now she's not as good as Ron Paul by a country mile but she's she's she's she's
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  pretty darn good and Ron Paul would certainly continue to educate her but
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.880]  very very exciting let's go ahead and go to this Ron Paul clip on the Patriot
[55:14.880 --> 55:18.240]  Act that was voted down procedurally yesterday they're gonna try to pass it
[55:18.240 --> 55:25.080]  again here it is gentlemen permission mr. Speaker I'm pleased at this time to
[55:25.080 --> 55:32.080]  recognize the distinguished gentleman from Texas mr. Ron Paul for three
[55:32.080 --> 55:34.240]  minutes
[55:34.240 --> 55:40.320]  general from Texas I thank the gentleman I ask unanimous consent to revise
[55:40.320 --> 55:46.440]  and extend my remarks mr. Speaker I rise in opposition to this bill I was
[55:46.440 --> 55:51.840]  opposed to the Patriot Act in 2001 and do not believe now that it's a good idea
[55:51.840 --> 55:57.320]  to extend it you know the fourth amendment is rather clear it says that we
[55:57.320 --> 56:01.680]  should be secure in our papers our persons our homes and our effects and
[56:01.680 --> 56:07.520]  that if warrants are to be issued we have to do it with probable cause and
[56:07.520 --> 56:13.920]  describe in particular the places the people and the things that we're gonna
[56:13.920 --> 56:18.520]  look at and I think what has happened though over the years has been that we
[56:18.520 --> 56:24.000]  have diluted the fourth amendment it was greatly diluted in 2001 but it started
[56:24.000 --> 56:30.280]  a lot earlier than that when the FISA law was originally written in 1978 that
[56:30.280 --> 56:34.160]  really introduced the notion that the fourth amendment was relative and not
[56:34.160 --> 56:38.880]  absolute look at the TSA late later on it was further weakened in 98 and then
[56:38.880 --> 56:46.280]  of course in 2001 I think our reaction to the horrors of 9-11 we can
[56:46.280 --> 56:50.800]  understand the concern and the fear that was developed but I think the reaction
[56:50.800 --> 56:54.880]  took us in the wrong direction because the assumption was made of course that
[56:54.880 --> 56:59.960]  we weren't spending enough money on surveillance and even though then our
[56:59.960 --> 57:03.640]  intelligence agency has received 40 billion dollars they didn't give us the
[57:03.640 --> 57:08.880]  right information so now we're spending 80 billion dollars but it also looks like
[57:08.880 --> 57:14.160]  the the conclusion was in the American people had too much privacy and if we
[57:14.160 --> 57:17.280]  undermine America people's privacy somehow or another we're going to be
[57:17.280 --> 57:22.320]  safer I think another thing that has come up lately has been that the purpose
[57:22.320 --> 57:26.120]  of government is to make us perfectly safe now it is good to be safe but
[57:26.120 --> 57:30.800]  governments can't make us safe I question whether or not we have been made
[57:30.800 --> 57:36.800]  safer by the Patriot Act but let's say a law makes us somewhat safer is that a
[57:36.800 --> 57:41.160]  justification for the government to do anything they want for instance if you
[57:41.160 --> 57:46.240]  want to be perfectly safe from child abuse and wife beating the government
[57:46.240 --> 57:51.520]  could put a camera in every one of our houses in our bedrooms and maybe there
[57:51.520 --> 57:56.400]  would be somebody made safer this way but what would you be giving up so perfect
[57:56.400 --> 58:00.400]  safety is not the purpose of government what we want from government is to
[58:00.400 --> 58:06.160]  enforce the law and to protect protect our liberties this to me has been
[58:06.160 --> 58:11.560]  especially since 9-eleven a classical example of sacrificing liberty for
[58:11.560 --> 58:15.560]  safety and security now I didn't invent those terms they've been around a long
[58:15.560 --> 58:19.960]  time and it's easily justified and I can understand it because I was here in
[58:19.960 --> 58:25.040]  2001 when this came up and people become frightened the American people want
[58:25.040 --> 58:28.520]  something done all right but I think we're gonna come back now and start going
[58:28.520 --> 58:32.320]  your calls and a lot of other important news but the government's supposed to be
[58:32.320 --> 58:35.960]  the guarantor of liberty not the enemy of it this government is completely
[58:35.960 --> 58:40.760]  backwards from its original mission
[58:43.440 --> 58:50.080]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[58:50.080 --> 58:54.560]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over it
[58:54.560 --> 58:59.520]  ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not
[58:59.520 --> 59:03.800]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for
[59:03.800 --> 59:07.520]  the rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the
[59:07.520 --> 59:11.840]  news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition
[59:11.840 --> 59:15.520]  to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should consider a
[59:15.520 --> 59:20.240]  food savings account from e-foods direct they both make fabulous investments food
[59:20.240 --> 59:23.840]  is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any

[59:28.400 --> 59:32.600]  can't eat paper stocks or metals Alex has been urging you to invest in

[1:00:00.280 --> 1:00:12.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:00:12.520 --> 1:00:20.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex
[1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:22.960]  Jones
[1:00:28.200 --> 1:00:33.240]  okay I will address the V for victory campaign coming up at the bottom of the
[1:00:33.240 --> 1:00:38.040]  hour it has been one of the most wildly successful operations we've ever
[1:00:38.040 --> 1:00:42.920]  launched together and it's finally starting to hit news around the country
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:47.880]  newspapers and TV and that's exactly what we needed it's having a giant effect
[1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:52.760]  and it's a symbol against the tyranny and that we know what the TSA's national
[1:00:52.760 --> 1:01:00.000]  rollout and takeover of society is wrong very very successful ABC news has now
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:06.760]  covered it in Washington DC that's up on prison planet calm I've got a lot of
[1:01:06.760 --> 1:01:11.600]  other news dealing with Mansfield here in Texas Arabic program on hold teaching
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:15.000]  the kids Arabic I'll give you my view on that of course that broke in the last
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:19.840]  few days I haven't really commented on it yet but I'm going to also I want to
[1:01:19.840 --> 1:01:23.320]  obviously get into more of the positive news that we've been reporting on but
[1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:29.160]  also some scary news Obamacare advocate on NPR says make refuse nicks wear gold
[1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:33.600]  stickers like yellow stars the Jews had to wear so that's coming up but right
[1:01:33.600 --> 1:01:39.560]  now let's go ahead and take some of your phone calls let's talk to Dan in
[1:01:39.560 --> 1:01:45.440]  Kentucky Dan you're on the air hey thanks for taking my call I've got some
[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:52.280]  good ideas for you I've got an ironclad contingency plan for any kind of
[1:01:52.280 --> 1:01:57.680]  attempted government censorship by internet to or fairness doctrine tyranny
[1:01:57.680 --> 1:02:04.760]  okay you could utilize your computer program or allies to create a downloadable
[1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:11.920]  person-to-person broadcast program like Aries or Napster each program see no I
[1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:15.240]  know there are a lot of great ways to do that and actually I sent Kurt an
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:19.680]  article a few days ago that I read that gave like a whole bunch of ways to get
[1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:23.560]  around censorship and I totally agree with you but but see they want to just
[1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:28.000]  take over the main web and then make us kind of operate under the floorboards
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:33.080]  instead of being able to virally spread information on the web and so yes we
[1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:36.840]  need to develop alternatives but in a two-dimensional three-dimensional model
[1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:45.320]  also fight to keep the web open and free exactly I have another idea also think
[1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:54.080]  about maybe how you can mobilize people individually let me see here by creating
[1:02:54.080 --> 1:03:01.400]  maybe a social network for info soldiers we're doing it through awesome so people
[1:03:01.400 --> 1:03:07.400]  could get together coffee shops and mobilize and stuff like that also one
[1:03:07.400 --> 1:03:17.600]  more thing about the Federal Reserve of possible another way to fight down I've
[1:03:17.600 --> 1:03:22.880]  watched a video called America freedom to fashion from freedom to fascism yes
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:30.640]  about the Federal Reserve history Aaron Russo yeah and it explains how they
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:35.600]  operate and how they came about and positive what if we could do a class
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:39.760]  action lawsuit against the better reserve for illegal tax well that is
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:44.200]  happening there are suits on the Federal Reserve for bailouts they've done for
[1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:47.760]  manipulating gold and silver prices and it is happening but more suits are
[1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:52.440]  better you know we have all these frivolous suits and then the system
[1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:56.600]  tries to use those as examples to then crack down on our real free speech but
[1:03:56.600 --> 1:04:01.320]  that's our one way to have a redress of grievances is those lawsuits and I
[1:04:01.320 --> 1:04:05.240]  totally agree with you awesome man I guess I guess you're headed the game
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:10.000]  then no no no are you calling in and talking about solutions is what it's
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:14.840]  all about we need to restate them talk about them debate them but you know one
[1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:18.320]  way to get around government censorship are these banner campaigns you go
[1:04:18.320 --> 1:04:21.920]  around town hanging stuff up on light poles and depending on your local laws
[1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:28.520]  and where they hang up stuff about you know dog grooming or what's going on
[1:04:28.520 --> 1:04:33.320]  with the local bake sale means you're right people are doing that to hang up
[1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:39.040]  you know website addresses simple messages the V campaign that has a huge
[1:04:39.040 --> 1:04:44.040]  effect and people start talking and but it has an effect on you too of going out
[1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:46.920]  and getting involved and I want to salute all those that have been doing it
[1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:50.360]  you've had a massive effect let's intensify it I'm gonna come back with
[1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:57.360]  Tim Steve Dave Chris and others pull for number to join us 800-259-92 31
[1:04:57.360 --> 1:05:03.000]  pull the right back this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:07.440]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[1:05:07.440 --> 1:05:11.480]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:05:11.480 --> 1:05:15.400]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:05:15.400 --> 1:05:19.400]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:05:19.400 --> 1:05:23.960]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:05:23.960 --> 1:05:27.960]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:31.760]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:05:31.760 --> 1:05:35.400]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:39.720]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:42.880]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[1:05:42.880 --> 1:05:46.560]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:31.600]  pro big brother arrogant piece of unjournalistic trash I've ever seen

[1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:17.160]  libertarians oh no none of that is scary historically and I mean the reporters
[1:09:17.160 --> 1:09:21.800]  this is an example of what journalism isn't and it's coming up at the bottom
[1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:25.560]  of the hour let's go to a bunch of your calls and and try to be quick folks I
[1:09:25.560 --> 1:09:27.920]  want to get to the next person want all of you to have a chance to be on air
[1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:33.040]  Tim in Michigan you're on the air hey Alex how you doing buddy good what's up
[1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:38.560]  hey first off I don't know if you've seen this I'm like I got two things I
[1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:43.920]  want to talk about one is the Carter cell and the other one is fluoride for
[1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:51.680]  one there was an actual TV interview with some doctor on the medical aid
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:58.760]  team Fox for friends the title of it is Gardasil for guys shot his FDA approved
[1:09:58.760 --> 1:10:03.640]  for boys ages from 9 to 26 yeah then they run a hoax and say your boy must
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:08.280]  take it to be in school when there's no law it just made up and yet now to
[1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:13.000]  protect your son from cervical cancer of course your son has no cervix and the
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:17.360]  vaccine itself admits on the insert it doesn't protect you not proven to
[1:10:17.360 --> 1:10:21.440]  protect you and it's killed a bunch of people but it's a live virus they
[1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:26.240]  inject into you yes it isn't that nice yeah yeah well they actually the act
[1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:35.520]  doctor actually said that this stuff is 90% safe and and that 90% huh wow then
[1:10:35.520 --> 1:10:40.920]  he said that it would be sexist not to just give it to just give it to girls
[1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:45.120]  and that his girl patients who are complaining that if we have to take it
[1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:49.040]  why don't the guys yeah see no no that no I didn't see the particular piece but
[1:10:49.040 --> 1:10:54.360]  that's the three-year hoax launched by Rick Perry he said it's mandatory to take
[1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:58.440]  what he does he made it recommended by the health department to recommend it to
[1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:04.400]  school kids and cervical cancer kills less than 3,000 people a year most of
[1:11:04.400 --> 1:11:09.880]  it is not associated with the papillomavirus there are hundreds of
[1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:15.280]  strains the the Gardasil covers what six strains and it's not even proven to
[1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:19.000]  protect you and then it causes horrible autoimmune responses but you notice you
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:22.920]  know he said oh it's pretty safe you know sometimes it's like Russian roulette I
[1:11:22.920 --> 1:11:28.520]  mean I guess 90% would mean you have a chamber a revolver with 10 rounds you're
[1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:31.280]  like it's pretty safe go ahead put it to your head and pull the trigger and go
[1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:37.320]  ahead and do it again but I mean just just search the term Gardasil deaths for
[1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:41.200]  anybody that wants to see it what was the other point on fluoride the luscious
[1:11:41.200 --> 1:11:47.400]  fluoride by being taken out of the water supply in Calgary Canada okay well
[1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:58.480]  thing I have some information here that in 1990 40 left Dennis brought a case
[1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:03.120]  against the American dental association contending that the association
[1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:07.720]  purposely shielded the public from data they link fluoride to genetic defects
[1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:12.480]  cancer and other yeah that's right but they quietly capitulated the American
[1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:18.320]  dental Association six years ago and said children under six years of age should
[1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:22.120]  not brush with Florida toothpaste and now there's the government saying okay
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:26.440]  get it out of the pesticides okay get it out of the water I mean they are
[1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:30.900]  capitulating to the facts keep pushing folks appreciate the call good points
[1:12:30.900 --> 1:12:37.240]  Tim Steven Florida you're on the air yeah good afternoon a couple things first
[1:12:37.240 --> 1:12:42.480]  of all as far as the provisions of the Patriot Act not being passed I'm a
[1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:46.960]  little glad about that but like us don't want to be vigilant I actually called my
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:51.440]  senators and representatives here in Florida and you know it just galls me
[1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:56.480]  with that issue that you know here the Republicans come out for it and yet all
[1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:00.400]  these neocons who have this work that we gotta you know annihilate the wag heads
[1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:04.920]  and turn Iran into a parking lot mentality can't see through the smoke
[1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:09.720]  screen there and that there's no difference between both parties and I
[1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:15.720]  know you use that offensive term to illustrate the the the racism towards
[1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:20.960]  Arabs but let's let's let's try not to use words like that only because it
[1:13:20.960 --> 1:13:24.680]  becomes a distraction from the overall information but but yes there's this
[1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:30.400]  religion of hating Arabs and Muslims but then we turns out the Ford Foundation
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:34.840]  and the and the education systems in this country the Department of Education
[1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:40.280]  for decades have sent tens of millions of dollars a year of textbooks with
[1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:46.280]  radical you know madrasa type messages about killing American infidels they
[1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:51.080]  bring in the radical Muslims they force it to be taught in schools they want us
[1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:54.960]  fighting with each other I mean if the government really thought Arabs were the
[1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:59.760]  absolute devil of the world why are they wide open you know immigration of this
[1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:05.360]  country I mean again why are they and I'm not a fan of hazy mubarak but why are
[1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:09.120]  they trying to put the Muslim Brotherhood in because the Muslim Brotherhood
[1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:13.360]  wants to basically have war with Israel they want a pretext to kick off World
[1:14:13.360 --> 1:14:20.160]  War three and we've had strategist and and and political scientist on for years
[1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:23.800]  saying this was coming and Brzezinski's written multiple books and he's the big
[1:14:23.800 --> 1:14:28.400]  architect right now over Obama's foreign policy saying they would do this so
[1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:33.920]  it's very important Steve go ahead yeah think I would say about that forget
[1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:36.680]  some other point real quick is when I say rag has been putting that in
[1:14:36.680 --> 1:14:41.120]  quotations as quoting what they say I understand but but in this politically
[1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:44.760]  correct world there's two schools of thought use those terms to break the
[1:14:44.760 --> 1:14:48.320]  power of them and to let the system know we'll engage whenever first amendment
[1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:53.920]  we want instead of obsessing and and getting fetishes over words instead of
[1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:57.000]  what's actually happening to people you know you'll see Arab groups get mad
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:00.600]  about that term but not mad about a million dead Iraqis you'll see black
[1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:05.320]  folks not mad about 51% of their kids getting aborted half the black people
[1:15:05.320 --> 1:15:08.840]  not existing but if they hear the n-word they go into convulsions of anger I
[1:15:08.840 --> 1:15:13.960]  understand why dr. Laura used that term it's because she understood not tend to
[1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:18.200]  agree with her that that that that it's silly to give it so much almost
[1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:22.600]  religious power break the power of it and defend the first amendment you know I
[1:15:22.600 --> 1:15:26.120]  don't get upset when you know people call in or on websites you know call me
[1:15:26.120 --> 1:15:30.040]  cracker and things like that I have respect for myself I know who I am and
[1:15:30.040 --> 1:15:35.520]  and but but at the same time I just don't go into those waters because I'm
[1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:39.520]  just covering the issues but I appreciate your call interesting point Steve but
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:43.760]  I think you know she didn't deserve to be boycotted but that's people's business
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:51.360]  that they wanted to you know for using that word and and and again if black
[1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:54.600]  folks are so much against that word and I understand why they are then they
[1:15:54.600 --> 1:15:58.520]  should really boycott the rappers and people that are using it so much then
[1:15:58.520 --> 1:16:01.720]  the rappers some of them have the point the hip-hop people well hey I'm taking
[1:16:01.720 --> 1:16:05.560]  that name back I'm taking it away I'm using it and and that's almost like my
[1:16:05.560 --> 1:16:09.320]  psychology but it's just all a bunch of the political correctness even get into
[1:16:09.320 --> 1:16:12.800]  it so I just ignore the whole matter let's go ahead and talk to Dave and
[1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:20.400]  Hawaii Aloha Dave hey how you doing Alex good sir what's on your mind today
[1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:25.280]  yeah well I've been a longtime fan of the show and I've also been a fan of Alan
[1:16:25.280 --> 1:16:29.520]  Watt just because he's always so thorough and seems like he's well
[1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:34.440]  documented in what he says and everything and but lately I've heard him say
[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:38.480]  something several times on other shows and there's also audio of it on the
[1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:46.280]  web where he said something that's just so provably false that just makes me
[1:16:46.280 --> 1:16:50.760]  question everything else that he said yeah well let me be clear we have we have
[1:16:50.760 --> 1:16:56.360]  Alan on every few months I respect him the info I've seen put out is super
[1:16:56.360 --> 1:17:01.280]  accurate I probably don't agree with you know his religious beliefs or whatever
[1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:04.480]  they are I mean from from what I've seen he tends to just stay away from all of
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:09.880]  that but that's his business but I want to be clear we have guessed on that I
[1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:13.720]  don't 100% agree with I mean people sometimes are like well why'd you have
[1:17:13.720 --> 1:17:17.480]  that person on you disagree with well I have them on so you can hear from them
[1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:22.720]  you know I don't agree with a lot of what the zeitgeist guy says but I've had
[1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:26.880]  him on the show before because it's an interesting discussion but I you know I
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:29.960]  can't get caught up I mean I don't even have time to watch Clint Beck but maybe
[1:17:29.960 --> 1:17:33.640]  once every two weeks I don't have time to listen to limp limbaugh I mean I am
[1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:37.720]  working I am researching I'm making films and so I can't really be my
[1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:41.360]  brother's keeper I mean I mean so what did he say that you think so patently
[1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:47.320]  false since you brought it up yeah he said that the he said that all of the
[1:17:47.320 --> 1:17:54.520]  Beatles songs were written by Theodore Adorno which was a 60-year-old German
[1:17:54.520 --> 1:18:01.040]  philosophy professor and he also said that he Theodore Adorno owned the rights
[1:18:01.040 --> 1:18:06.720]  to the Beatles songs until he died and then that was when they got sold to
[1:18:06.720 --> 1:18:12.680]  Michael Jackson and he just gives no source for that and I mean hold on hold
[1:18:12.680 --> 1:18:16.040]  on he couldn't have written all I didn't hear Alan say this and it just it
[1:18:16.040 --> 1:18:20.520]  seems I mean next time he's on I'll ask him about it but Theodore Adorno died in
[1:18:20.520 --> 1:18:26.320]  1969 and the Beatles kept writing songs right into the 70s so I don't I mean I
[1:18:26.320 --> 1:18:32.400]  mean he says they wrote all the songs yeah he said he wrote them all and he
[1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:37.720]  said that he also owned the rights to them and though that's just provably
[1:18:37.720 --> 1:18:44.280]  false and let me tell you where I think he got the idea for that and he did say
[1:18:44.280 --> 1:18:49.120]  that it's on the web you can look so I'm not saying you're bad for calling in
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:53.560]  with this but I got so so many huge things going on good things bad things
[1:18:53.560 --> 1:18:57.840]  ugly things so many big giant you know you know huge issues that are happening
[1:18:57.840 --> 1:19:01.600]  but yeah I'll bring it up to him next time he's on but I mean I I quite
[1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:05.920]  frankly like some of the Beatles music but I don't even have time to listen to
[1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:12.240]  music I like unless I'm in the car you know in between research I just don't I
[1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:17.360]  mean constantly I get emails and calls about you know there's a big flap on
[1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:21.960]  the internet going why'd you censor some lady so I made a call and checked and it
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:25.720]  wasn't censored it was on my website some woman called in about weather
[1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:28.720]  modifications so I took the time to look up the document she brought up and it
[1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:33.120]  was a rehashed public stuff about owning the weather 2025 and it wasn't about
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:37.180]  pole shifts and there's all this Alex is covering up pole shifts he censored her
[1:19:37.180 --> 1:19:40.720]  and then people found the clip on the web and said no he didn't censor so they
[1:19:40.720 --> 1:19:45.440]  go that was a fake thing he morphed her voice to claim he didn't censor it's
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:49.800]  just it's all I mean it's just why do we spend all our time talking about
[1:19:49.800 --> 1:19:53.920]  different personalities that fight the New World Order if you're better than
[1:19:53.920 --> 1:19:57.680]  Alan Watt and me I say go out and do your own show please I know there are
[1:19:57.680 --> 1:20:01.680]  people out there more eloquent than I am step up to the plate is it really

[1:24:03.800 --> 1:24:11.160]  don't worry this show is documented Alex Jones on the GCN radio network the
[1:24:11.160 --> 1:24:15.360]  Patriot Act in a procedural vote was defeated yesterday the reauthorization
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:18.640]  of the un-American police state legislation they think they've got the
[1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:28.120]  votes to pass it the full vote or in a another procedural move but this is a
[1:24:28.120 --> 1:24:33.200]  victory and I was correct there are 98 US senators that voted in favor of the
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:41.800]  original USA Patriot Act in October of 2001 and senator Landry of Louisiana did
[1:24:41.800 --> 1:24:46.720]  not vote and she abstained and senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin was the only
[1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:50.240]  senator who voted against the Patriot Act and that's a good thing that Russ
[1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:57.520]  Feingold did there you go look I'm not mad at the last caller it's just I don't
[1:24:57.520 --> 1:25:00.720]  have time for this folks that's why other people with radio shows and
[1:25:00.720 --> 1:25:05.200]  filmmakers are not successful because all they do is just fight with each other
[1:25:05.200 --> 1:25:08.920]  constantly and freak out over everything I'm just here to get messages out
[1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:15.120]  information and you can decide what to do with it okay I mean Calgary's voted
[1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:19.480]  out fluoride San Diego looks like they may do it the Patriot acts in trouble
[1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:23.920]  there's big investigations in Europe over the vaccines causing brain damage I
[1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:29.560]  mean I we've they're putting an emergency alert takeover systems all this
[1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:33.960]  stuff is happening and I'm here to talk about it and to get people into the
[1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:37.200]  exercise of standing up and getting involved for whatever your views are
[1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:43.360]  just stop letting the globalist program you let's go ahead and talk to Chris in
[1:25:43.360 --> 1:25:46.840]  California Chris you're on the air
[1:25:48.840 --> 1:25:53.880]  okay we're gonna stop industry and stop the quibbling between government and
[1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:58.520]  economy because that's what it is it's causing a climate change like the
[1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:03.600]  Nobel thesis is proved and that's causing the asteroid and the post shift
[1:26:03.600 --> 1:26:07.360]  ma'am you call us a lot on the voicemail here and I just I don't believe in
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:10.880]  asteroids coming to get us I don't sometimes this happens sometimes we take
[1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:14.800]  calls and it's 100% gold info and I'm just I'm just honest I don't screen
[1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:18.440]  calls but if I don't like what's going on somebody calls every day I mean ma'am
[1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:22.280]  have you gotten the message here I don't believe that that comment coming
[1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:25.920]  between the earth and the moon on the 15th of March is gonna kill us all there's
[1:26:25.920 --> 1:26:30.280]  gonna be a pole shift okay okay and I'm not covering up a pole shift all right
[1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:36.840]  and and and I'll be the discredited one when there's no pole shift on March 15
[1:26:36.840 --> 1:26:42.760]  the Ides of March I'll everyone who said we were all gonna die will be yes they
[1:26:42.760 --> 1:26:49.120]  were wrong hail them Alex was right he's this info okay we're gonna all be here
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:52.920]  unless we die in car wrecks today or get struck by lightning or die of cancer or
[1:26:52.920 --> 1:26:58.800]  whatever and and everybody's calling me saying talk about pole shift so I went
[1:26:58.800 --> 1:27:03.280]  and did research and saw some Fox News hype about it saying the poles were
[1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:07.280]  moving and then I actually went to the original recordings by the federal
[1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:11.600]  government and private scientific outfits and it turns out they're moving
[1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:17.680]  all the time it's you know a lot of times I don't take a lot of calls I
[1:27:17.680 --> 1:27:21.400]  have guests on and cover news because but you know what I think this is all
[1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:25.840]  educational to begin with just to just to hear it and and so there I just
[1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:29.040]  censored the lady who calls here 15 times a day sometimes a hundred times a
[1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:33.520]  day no I don't believe in man-made climate change I mean what a simple
[1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:39.200]  weird statement to say we need to get the government and industry to stop
[1:27:39.200 --> 1:27:44.760]  fighting they're causing climate change just the Easter Bunny is causing fruit
[1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:48.880]  looks to fall out of the sky I mean that has as much sense and then to go on to
[1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:53.320]  that's what's causing the asteroid what what government and industry not
[1:27:53.320 --> 1:27:57.680]  getting together is causing an asteroid I'm not gonna listen to it I'm not gonna
[1:27:57.680 --> 1:28:06.760]  listen to it do you understand I don't want nonsense I'm tired of it man oh let's

[1:32:01.280 --> 1:32:05.040]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[1:32:05.040 --> 1:32:08.840]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:32:08.840 --> 1:32:13.360]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[1:32:13.360 --> 1:32:17.560]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[1:32:17.560 --> 1:32:22.200]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[1:32:22.200 --> 1:32:26.160]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[1:32:26.160 --> 1:32:30.320]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[1:32:30.320 --> 1:32:34.280]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:38.440]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:20.280]  no one's gonna take me you know it's funny we just had that caller play
[1:33:20.280 --> 1:33:24.000]  clips of Tony Montana when he's been thrown out of Cuba and gets off the
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:29.200]  boat and they're about to throw him into a immigration detention center and he
[1:33:29.200 --> 1:33:35.080]  says listen I eat squid 10 times a day I was a slave I was thrown in prison
[1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:38.760]  they've got spies on every street corner watching you telling you what to
[1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:43.120]  think what to say what to wear what to do are you a communist I'm not a
[1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:48.560]  communist I want to be an American leave me alone it's one of my favorite
[1:33:48.560 --> 1:33:54.920]  movies tell you Oliver Stone is just just amazing actually did years of
[1:33:54.920 --> 1:33:58.440]  research before he made that it's a composite of some true stories that's a
[1:33:58.440 --> 1:34:04.680]  little inside baseball on that but that is exactly what it is I mean this is
[1:34:04.680 --> 1:34:10.200]  archetypal tyranny right out of 1984 at the shopping markets and at the Walmart's
[1:34:10.200 --> 1:34:16.400]  it's now 9,000 locations that they're going in with big telescreens you know
[1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:21.280]  telling you to be paranoid as if the enemy is in America and who's around you
[1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:26.680]  other Americans grazing at Walmart and then she's at the Super Bowl injecting
[1:34:26.680 --> 1:34:29.800]  herself and they got the EAS takeover system and they're saying we're gonna
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:34.600]  break in on your online video games with terror alerts we're going to break in
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:39.080]  on your cell phone with terror alerts we're gonna start not just having EAS
[1:34:39.080 --> 1:34:43.480]  tasked every few days on radio but there's gonna be Obama announcements and
[1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:47.440]  then I was on man count today and he said well for nuclear attack and I said
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:53.440]  no no the system was in place in the 50s for that and it was voluntary now it's
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:57.960]  mandatory and the stations have to spend all this money paying for it that's
[1:34:57.960 --> 1:35:02.000]  passed on to you the consumer and now they're saying they're gonna start
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.560]  breaking in with messages they've announced they're gonna try to phase in
[1:35:04.560 --> 1:35:09.120]  digital license plates that you get with your tags that you have to plug in to
[1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:14.160]  the you know a tail light hookup so you have to go pay to have it installed many
[1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:18.280]  cars aren't aren't set up for it and then it's a digital LCD screen that'll
[1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:23.480]  have most wanted images that pop up in between having your tag numbers and
[1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:28.120]  advertisements for the state to make money license plates with homeland
[1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:33.480]  security flashing messages billboards doing it you you're there with your kids
[1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:36.400]  at Walmart you try to keep them away from TV you try to keep them away from
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:42.360]  brainwashing and there's a big brother woman up on the TV now you're about to
[1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:48.960]  see the ultimate illustration of what bad journalism is I'm gonna analyze this
[1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:53.880]  I'm gonna play the clip and stop it and start it and break it down here for you
[1:35:53.880 --> 1:36:03.080]  right now this this is unbelievable but when you talk about Tony Montana what's
[1:36:03.080 --> 1:36:08.080]  funny is I constantly when I think of the police state think about him saying
[1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:12.560]  you want a chivano on every corner that's a spy or rat you want him telling
[1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:16.360]  you what to eat what to wear what to do you see the move by the UN first they
[1:36:16.360 --> 1:36:19.200]  set the president to ban smoking all over the world through local ordinances
[1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:23.400]  sounds reasonable what type of light bulb you can have what type of toilet now
[1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:29.280]  it's too much salt too much fat now they're deciding with federal zoning
[1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:34.600]  what can happen in your house under UN agenda 21 this is a planned society run
[1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:41.520]  by a bunch of crooks that have robbed us blind and are making you at the Super Bowl
[1:36:41.520 --> 1:36:46.800]  watch her with announcements paid forward taxpayer money making you this is
[1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:51.320]  worse than the terror alerts they're just red alert all the time and it's right
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:57.600]  out of 1984 now the V campaign they have literally and I'm really worried about it
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:03.240]  at a certain level because I'm spending probably an hour every day trying to
[1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:07.960]  watch them all Phil is spending what three hours a day Phil and there is the
[1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:12.440]  point man on all the flyers that come in all the videos of people posting the
[1:37:12.440 --> 1:37:18.440]  V for victory symbol it's incredible and of course the V for victory originally
[1:37:18.440 --> 1:37:24.960]  comes from the 12 and 1300s the British long bowman the Welsh long bowman when
[1:37:24.960 --> 1:37:30.680]  the Norman and others would invade the Anglo-Saxons had long bows that were at
[1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:36.280]  you know before guns were invented it but extremely powerful and they could
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:41.000]  shoot people at you know 300 yards away and with incredible accuracy to shoot
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:48.480]  right through armor and so whenever they would capture the Anglo-Saxon troops
[1:37:48.480 --> 1:37:54.000]  mainly Welsh bowman that's where my folks on the English shot are from no
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  Jones I'm apart Welsh they were the best bowman in Europe and they were and and
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.840]  their bows were seen as the most well-designed the most powerful they were
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:06.800]  feared and so when they would capture them they would cut off their index and
[1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:11.840]  their middle finger slice them off and so for hundreds of years with groups
[1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:19.240]  fighting that became a kind of a military insult or a come and get it come
[1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:23.280]  and take it thing come and take it here's my fingers I got them and I'm gonna
[1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:27.640]  use them and then that's why the British because I actually did the research on it
[1:38:27.640 --> 1:38:31.200]  after we launched it I thought it originated with the French resistance
[1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:34.920]  and saying you know V for victory so there were just posters put up at night
[1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:38.520]  and the Nazis would get mad because you know there's a V is saying resist the
[1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:43.080]  occupation with RV it's got info wars calm under it the original poster we put
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:46.480]  out it's got to be thousands of variants you put out many of them better than
[1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:49.880]  what we hastily put together and I thought it was excellent you know what
[1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:53.720]  we put together we did like in 30 minutes one night when Watson had the idea I
[1:38:53.720 --> 1:39:00.680]  said we're launching the the answer to 1984 is 1776 contest it's a $10,000
[1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:07.640]  contest $7,000 for first place 2000 for second 1000 for third place and the
[1:39:07.640 --> 1:39:11.280]  announcements coming up in fact when do we launch the contest I've got to look
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:15.560]  at contest rules I guess in a few weeks that the that contest closes and I
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:20.000]  called Watson so upset about all the police state developments one night about
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:24.640]  five o'clock here about 10 o'clock his time in England and I said we got to do
[1:39:24.640 --> 1:39:30.160]  something Watson I said man I sure hope people you know make videos of their
[1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:36.120]  activism the answer to 1984 is 1776 is a contest wide open whatever you want to
[1:39:36.120 --> 1:39:40.520]  do whether it's a fiction piece you do or a protest in an airport or hanging
[1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:44.680]  banners up it's about getting in the streets about letting others know that
[1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:48.840]  there's a national solidarity against the tyranny that's not all just left
[1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:52.200]  right paradigm that we the people can come together for the Bill and rights
[1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:57.840]  and Constitution and Watson said I said we need some kind of symbol though
[1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:01.920]  people like symbols but he goes why not the V for victory I he said I was just
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:06.240]  reading a history book about the French resistance was his parents had moved to
[1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:10.920]  France and he was over there visiting him at Christmas and I said that's it
[1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:13.640]  boom I went to Phil I said Phil you ready to stay here another hour he said
[1:40:13.640 --> 1:40:18.920]  absolutely I said let's make a V and so we will launched it wrote the little in
[1:40:18.920 --> 1:40:22.080]  fact we guys print me one off the little message at the bottom about the new
[1:40:22.080 --> 1:40:25.200]  owners taking over the banks are looting us there's a police state our
[1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:29.240]  Constitution's under attack this symbol will get your town talking and get
[1:40:29.240 --> 1:40:32.280]  people visiting the site learning what's happening and so people understand
[1:40:32.280 --> 1:40:37.760]  that there is a underground resistance because media and the system is very very
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:43.600]  scared of this because it's been used all over the world and they normally
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:47.400]  respond like with the Obama Joker poster with threatening people the rest
[1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:51.320]  even if it's hung in legal areas how dare you show Obama as the Joker that
[1:40:51.320 --> 1:40:58.080]  defiles our dear great leader derpher and we're here to make fun of derpher we're
[1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:03.320]  here to pull down that godlike big brother system that they sell us so that
[1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:06.880]  people realize we have strength and they're just men like us they put their
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:11.640]  pants on one leg at a time they brush their teeth every morning you know we
[1:41:11.640 --> 1:41:17.120]  can defeat them and Watson said Alex why don't you do a V and so we did about an
[1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:22.000]  hour research found you know a simple V symbol that you see right behind me
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:27.400]  you're watching on TV and we launched it now it's been the most successful from
[1:41:27.400 --> 1:41:32.360]  what we can gather of videos produced numbers of people posting the V of buzz
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:37.600]  of some newspapers covering it of massive emails I'm getting of just you
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:43.400]  know incredible response on the web but with the Obama Joker the media did
[1:41:43.400 --> 1:41:46.960]  exactly what we wanted they started threatening people and threatening to
[1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:51.080]  arrest whoever was posting these even in legal areas and then the police refused
[1:41:51.080 --> 1:41:54.400]  to press charges on one guy because they pointed out wall you they can hang up a
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:41:58.800]  dog grooming sign that's why I keep using that example the police said they
[1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:08.960]  can hang up a sign about a swap meat or a bake sale or a garage sale and the
[1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:12.960]  cops said you know first amendment because in some towns there wasn't an
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:15.960]  ordinance against putting them up on power poles and they were like we're
[1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:20.120]  looking for them we want to arrest them papers in Texas and TV you know was
[1:42:20.120 --> 1:42:24.000]  saying this and in Florida they're like we're gonna arrest whoever did this and
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:27.960]  then a bunch of people saw it on the news and they ran out and put them up
[1:42:27.960 --> 1:42:31.400]  everywhere and the cops were like we're gonna find them and then later they said
[1:42:31.400 --> 1:42:36.120]  well you know people made fun of George Bush they put him up as the Joker why
[1:42:36.120 --> 1:42:41.920]  can't you do this and the cops said in multiple locales they up by Dallas in a
[1:42:41.920 --> 1:42:45.600]  town they said you know in the news and we played those clips here they said look
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:50.840]  do you want us to go arrest people that put up a garage sale sign on a power
[1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:54.800]  pole because you know this can really really be a problem here we don't want
[1:42:54.800 --> 1:42:58.400]  to selectively enforce this even in towns where they have the ordinance now
[1:42:58.400 --> 1:43:05.120]  we have said we also had the the flyer operation with the flu that was in scores
[1:43:05.120 --> 1:43:08.360]  of newspapers and TV channels I had him calling me every day going are you the
[1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:12.480]  one putting up these signs saying the flu shot can kill you or cause Guillaume
[1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:19.000]  beret but this is back in 2009 before it came out and is admitted it did do this
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:22.520]  see we were proven right and they had newscast about how evil we were but then
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:30.160]  that educated people so all of that is happening now the only thing that we
[1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:37.360]  haven't had happen is TV coverage and TV demonizing and that's what we're
[1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:41.600]  really looking for it's not enough to just and it's fine it's the first step
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:46.080]  in the right direction to make flyers post them on the web on Facebook on my
[1:43:46.080 --> 1:43:50.880]  space on YouTube to make you your own YouTube video about the V for victory
[1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:55.120]  campaign to get others that's all great but that's the first step the real step
[1:43:55.120 --> 1:43:59.320]  is like the guy at the Super Bowl who hung up hundreds of them all around the
[1:43:59.320 --> 1:44:04.200]  Super Bowl I talked to people that went to Super Bowl who saw him and we got
[1:44:04.200 --> 1:44:08.640]  reports that people saw his video that got thousands thousands of views you
[1:44:08.640 --> 1:44:14.040]  know the one problem here is we post probably 10 15 new videos a day and we
[1:44:14.040 --> 1:44:17.480]  just posted one it would get you know 10 20 30 thousand views because we're
[1:44:17.480 --> 1:44:20.960]  posting five 10 15 videos only get two or three thousand views of peace but
[1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:24.480]  that's still great politicians fly all over the country powerful ones just to
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:27.760]  speak to a thousand people you're putting up a YouTube video and reaching
[1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:31.160]  three thousand people but all the people around the Super Bowl then we got
[1:44:31.160 --> 1:44:35.240]  reports others saw that video and went down and put even more up not just the
[1:44:35.240 --> 1:44:39.600]  one guy and his friends so again I salute you for causing that chain
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:43.440]  reaction that's how liberty can defeat these people and yeah I'm risking my
[1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:47.680]  life be at the tip of the spear of this but I'm not gonna fight for freedom at
[1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:54.160]  10% or 20% or 90% I'm gonna go 110% I'm gonna go beyond what I believe I can do
[1:44:54.160 --> 1:44:58.440]  does it mean I'm perfect no but my heart's right and I'm going the right
[1:44:58.440 --> 1:45:04.520]  direction and we resonate together we understand that we are kindreds soulmates
[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:07.800]  when it comes to that we're part of a brotherhood a sisterhood of liberty and
[1:45:07.800 --> 1:45:12.520]  freedom that is literally eternal and I salute all of you I love you in fact I
[1:45:12.520 --> 1:45:16.720]  wanted to take time after they just thank you all of you it's it's it's it's
[1:45:16.720 --> 1:45:22.960]  been so wonderful what we've done now this newscast is the most deceptive
[1:45:22.960 --> 1:45:28.400]  piece of embarrassing trash that I've ever seen I mean this is worse than
[1:45:28.400 --> 1:45:32.480]  local news saying Mercury's good for baby's brains this is worse than MSNBC
[1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:35.800]  saying lead toys are good for kids and you never saw those clips just search
[1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:37.920]  them and you'll they'll come up I'm not gonna play them again I've played them
[1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:41.840]  more than a hundred times old-time listeners go yeah please don't play it
[1:45:41.840 --> 1:45:46.440]  again we we know but new listeners won't believe it just just search it about
[1:45:46.440 --> 1:45:50.400]  mercury good for children newscast mercury good for children MSNBC says
[1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:58.360]  lead toys good for kids and it'll come up but this is the most arrogant
[1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:05.360]  hubris filled deceptive thing it's a minute and a half long ABC news out of
[1:46:05.360 --> 1:46:11.400]  DC a they say we're leftist when we're all about getting outside the left track
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:16.920]  paradigm and the ADL says we're hardcore right-wingers but they're saying
[1:46:16.920 --> 1:46:22.280]  we're leftist whatever label they want and then they go on and make fun of us
[1:46:22.280 --> 1:46:25.640]  and claim we've got stuff about stormtroopers on the websites no we've
[1:46:25.640 --> 1:46:30.800]  got the history of the French resistance going up against the Nazis with the V so
[1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:35.000]  they spin that like we say Nazi stormtroopers are invading well I've
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:37.880]  got to play it and stop it because literally every 10 seconds is a
[1:46:37.880 --> 1:46:43.760]  deception and the reporter waves it off you know he just laughing at it it's so
[1:46:43.760 --> 1:46:47.520]  and they're like it's so reasonable that they're putting telescreens in you
[1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:50.480]  know they're not saying don't trust your neighbor and spy on people yeah they
[1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:54.720]  are they're introducing this idea they're terrorist everywhere and watch
[1:46:54.720 --> 1:46:58.400]  everyone and people are at Walmart's repeatedly seeing a guy on a cell phone
[1:46:58.400 --> 1:47:01.960]  and calling the police saying it's a gun people are being shot and killed
[1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:06.560]  watering their yard because they got a metal sprayer on the end and in San
[1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:11.440]  Francisco I mean it's just la la every day they're they're shutting down
[1:47:11.440 --> 1:47:17.400]  highways there's a cardboard box blows out of the back of a truck and people
[1:47:17.400 --> 1:47:22.000]  are cardboard box I mean it's just all about this culture of limbing fear
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:25.920]  mongers and they train you to report on al-qaeda and next it's reporting legal
[1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:29.440]  guns we have the internal homeland security reports it's all about the
[1:47:29.440 --> 1:47:35.040]  American people just like the TSA is but they make this big joke about it you
[1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:39.280]  got the EAS takeover system a radio and TV the internet kill switch but none of
[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:43.280]  that's in context it's just a notice just like the White House didn't say
[1:47:43.280 --> 1:47:46.800]  they said well there was this unreputable source last week that said we
[1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:49.640]  might be causing the blackouts and that's ridiculous but they didn't say
[1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:54.720]  who the source was it's us just like the V campaign is us they don't even let you
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:48:01.200]  have the source they don't even have the respect for you to do that and I don't
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:03.360]  want to be interrupted this is too important I'm skipping this network
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:10.200]  break station should carry this because it's a network break so let's start
[1:48:10.200 --> 1:48:13.920]  playing this clip out of DC where they don't show you the website where they
[1:48:13.920 --> 1:48:17.920]  don't show you where the V campaign came from they lie and say we're leftist it
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:22.440]  is and they tell you how good it is and reasonable to you know see something
[1:48:22.440 --> 1:48:26.720]  say something as if we don't know you know we see a guy with a gun in the
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:29.760]  parking lot or we see somebody stealing something like we don't need to say
[1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:33.480]  something again it's this condescending and getting us used to the government
[1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:38.040]  forcing its way into our face every day bombarding us with propaganda this is
[1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:43.640]  1984 even even the Washington Post says this is 1984 but they say oh we're just
[1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:48.160]  cooks look at these nuts they say tell us screens telling you to spy on people
[1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:53.000]  is weird it's not spying let's start going to the clip today about a homeland
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:57.560]  security campaign called if you see something say something critics call it
[1:48:57.560 --> 1:49:01.800]  big brother is watching 13 news reporter Dave Cassidy is live on Capitol Hill
[1:49:01.800 --> 1:49:06.040]  Forest this morning with more info and Dave the government says it's not asking
[1:49:06.040 --> 1:49:11.920]  Americans to spy on each other that's right but some groups on the left of
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:16.000]  saddle of Vanessa really don't like this one they say okay stop right there
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:20.720]  backing up a few seconds groups on the left now not only is that obviously a
[1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:24.120]  lie what everything we're about is not being left or right but the mainline
[1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:27.720]  media mainly is saying we're right wings we don't like Obama so they know
[1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:31.080]  that's not true and they do and he's reading off my website he you know he's
[1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:34.560]  reading from it but they're not letting you know the source that's the telltale
[1:49:34.560 --> 1:49:38.360]  sign of deception just like the winehouse said there's people saying we
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:41.160]  caused the blackouts their liars but they don't let you read what was actually
[1:49:41.160 --> 1:49:46.960]  said same thing there so two lies there we're not leftist and they don't let you
[1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:52.120]  know the source they don't let you know the source so you can decide for yourself
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:56.360]  continue on the for victory program because they don't want America to
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:50:01.480]  become a police state the National Football League signed on to see

[1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:11.440]  interrupting and and I'll continue to interrupt but I want to just start from
[1:50:11.440 --> 1:50:14.840]  the beginning here in a moment but yeah they didn't just sign on to see something
[1:50:14.840 --> 1:50:18.640]  say something oh that's so reasonable as he's about to say no they had TSA
[1:50:18.640 --> 1:50:22.640]  running the checkpoints and running the private security and police security and
[1:50:22.640 --> 1:50:26.360]  the National Guard was there groping people doing pat downs source

[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:44.760]  no just oh they just wanted some security instead of you see something say
[1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:52.400]  something it's so reasonable to have telescreens at Walmart continue with the
[1:50:52.400 --> 1:50:56.880]  piece questions today about a homeland security campaign called if you see
[1:50:56.880 --> 1:51:01.440]  something say something critics call it big brother is watching 13 news reporter

[1:51:04.840 --> 1:51:11.160]  Dave the government says it's not asking Americans to spy on each other that's
[1:51:11.160 --> 1:51:15.680]  right but some groups on the left of salad Vanessa really don't like this
[1:51:15.680 --> 1:51:20.680]  one they say they're starting their own V for victory program stop there one
[1:51:20.680 --> 1:51:25.440]  America to become a okay I apologize I said there were only three lies in the
[1:51:25.440 --> 1:51:29.200]  first 20 seconds there was another lie she says she repeats it the homeland
[1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:36.400]  security says they are not asking you to spy but they are asking you to spy
[1:51:36.400 --> 1:51:40.720]  that that's what it is spying is being a little creep who who creeps around and
[1:51:40.720 --> 1:51:43.200]  lets everybody know we're watching the government's letting you know we're
[1:51:43.200 --> 1:51:46.320]  watching we're getting other citizens to watch you know you're being watched
[1:51:46.320 --> 1:51:51.880]  chilling effect you better shut up and we've got the public reports my
[1:51:51.880 --> 1:51:56.800]  homeland security where they say is somebody talking about politically
[1:51:56.800 --> 1:52:01.000]  controversial things that's a quote so so they're saying we're watching you
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:05.160]  politically but she says this is not spying they are not doing it please
[1:52:05.160 --> 1:52:10.040]  continue please state the National Football League signed on to see
[1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:14.440]  something say something just in time for last Sunday Super Bowl asking fans
[1:52:14.440 --> 1:52:18.320]  there to keep their eyes open and tell somebody if they saw something
[1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:24.640]  threatening stop right there has joined in to what the psychology here is always
[1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:29.360]  showing cheering like oh they asked him to join in spying and then oh they cut
[1:52:29.360 --> 1:52:32.520]  to the happy party everyone's when you're watching a basketball game or
[1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:36.880]  football game when there's a great play or a basket three-pointer made it right
[1:52:36.880 --> 1:52:41.880]  before the buzzer they just cut to troops always and that's a Pavlovian thing
[1:52:41.880 --> 1:52:45.000]  where they ding the bell then give the dog food pretty soon they ding the bell
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:49.800]  the dog salivates even when there's no food it's like you like that basket you
[1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:55.960]  like that excitement military military it saves you it's good it's it's wonderful
[1:52:55.960 --> 1:53:00.600]  right out of North Korea right out of 1984 fiction where everything good is
[1:53:00.600 --> 1:53:03.720]  associated with the state we're not saying military themselves are bad the
[1:53:03.720 --> 1:53:08.440]  point is you know the telltale of a wicked society is government worship
[1:53:08.440 --> 1:53:12.240]  military worship billboards of the military everywhere big brothers face
[1:53:12.240 --> 1:53:18.200]  everywhere again it's it's it's selling young people to go join the military by
[1:53:18.200 --> 1:53:22.560]  seeing it and it's bombarding you with military pageantry which they have in
[1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:26.560]  China and Nazi Germany had it they all have it these are the trappings of
[1:53:26.560 --> 1:53:32.240]  corruption so just every millisecond this was a weaponized newscast every bit
[1:53:32.240 --> 1:53:36.440]  of this was crafted purely and the body language the laughing and the giggling
[1:53:36.440 --> 1:53:41.240]  and if you want to believe that any way to sound oh let's continue it's coming
[1:53:41.240 --> 1:53:46.280]  up more than 800 stores playing video messages at checkout counters urging
[1:53:46.280 --> 1:53:50.840]  shoppers to report any suspicious activity the government says homeland
[1:53:50.840 --> 1:53:56.080]  security begins with hometown security and each of us can play a part of it
[1:53:56.080 --> 1:54:02.680]  pause again up again he says Walmart at 800 locations yeah it's it's 9000 total
[1:54:02.680 --> 1:54:10.640]  and not Walmart 846 and then 8000 plus other locations Mall of America you name
[1:54:10.640 --> 1:54:17.800]  it but notice there that well I forgot that lie back it up 15 seconds it's just
[1:54:17.800 --> 1:54:21.360]  all lies and I do this sometimes because I want to show you the lies it just
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:25.600]  everything is a lie everything is a deception back that video up for me
[1:54:25.600 --> 1:54:30.160]  please because I want to we're playing it off the ABC players that's why it's
[1:54:30.160 --> 1:54:36.040]  kind of skip you a little bit but here it is again we see an unattended bag for
[1:54:36.040 --> 1:54:40.680]  instance in a public place but critics say this really amounts to a big brother
[1:54:40.680 --> 1:54:46.560]  campaign of spying on people and the critics websites are full of references
[1:54:46.560 --> 1:54:53.840]  to Nazi stormtroopers and government slave masters back to you harm strong
[1:54:53.840 --> 1:54:59.240]  words there Dave this campaign started after 911 right right it was kind of a
[1:54:59.240 --> 1:55:04.360]  common sense response in New York I pause again this campaign a telescreens
[1:55:04.360 --> 1:55:08.480]  and being fresh at the Super Bowl and to get on planes having their hands down
[1:55:08.480 --> 1:55:12.920]  your pants it's like well this started on 911 see something say something see
[1:55:12.920 --> 1:55:17.000]  they're using symbolism they're saying see something say something that that
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:24.320]  sounds reasonable and then to that archetypal semantical symbol they attach total
[1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:29.680]  tyranny troops at checkpoints DHS at checkpoints hands down pants telescreens
[1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:35.240]  spy on your neighbors spy on political activity and they're like look they just
[1:55:35.240 --> 1:55:40.120]  started it after 911 it's just if you see something say something it's
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:45.880]  completely reasonable and let's go ahead and finish the clip 40 said to his
[1:55:45.880 --> 1:55:49.840]  passengers look if you see it on the tenant in her bag or something else
[1:55:49.840 --> 1:55:54.000]  suspicious tell somebody and then the federal heard about it and through some
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:58.640]  money at it and now they're taking it national to many people will just see my
[1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:01.880]  common sense but to others it looks like something more sinister
[1:56:01.880 --> 1:56:08.160]  so Vanessa see something say something we're watching thanks Dave oh see see
[1:56:08.160 --> 1:56:13.160]  that was all teleprompter'd see something say something we're watching you
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:20.240]  big brother is watching in 1984 because it was based off Stalin and Hitler Orwell
[1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:26.200]  said it was an amalgamation of those societies of big posters everywhere with
[1:56:26.200 --> 1:56:30.920]  big brother pointing saying big brother is watching and you heard her she feels
[1:56:30.920 --> 1:56:35.920]  like she's part of the power structure just like that San Francisco rental car
[1:56:35.920 --> 1:56:39.840]  lady I watched her with about 10 people in front of me renting cars our plane
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:43.200]  was an hour and a half late it was like midnight I'm just wanting to get my car
[1:56:43.200 --> 1:56:48.880]  I've got a drive you know to a nearby city it was actually two hours away I
[1:56:48.880 --> 1:56:53.120]  just want to get some sleep you know it's midnight California time to my time
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:56.960]  and she shared just interrogating where are you going all your mom how's she
[1:56:56.960 --> 1:57:00.720]  doing got anything with you what's going on and I got up there and I said look I
[1:57:00.720 --> 1:57:04.560]  know this is Homeland Security Patriot Act compliant stuff I don't want to
[1:57:04.560 --> 1:57:07.960]  answer your questions and she was you know you know this young blonde on a
[1:57:07.960 --> 1:57:12.480]  power trip like she's 007 she goes really you don't oh and I said okay I'll
[1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:17.440]  tell you I'm doing national TV show and then she kind of didn't like that one
[1:57:17.440 --> 1:57:21.200]  and then looked and said oh I've got your real address not the one you think
[1:57:21.200 --> 1:57:27.120]  people haven't and then double charged me she showed me it's all about these
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:32.800]  little people grasping for power wanting the power and that's like that woman at
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:38.480]  the end of the clip she says oh she says it real sexy oh see something say
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:45.320]  something and she adds we're watching we're watching you and oh the government
[1:57:45.320 --> 1:57:48.200]  making you buy health care that's not indentured servitude slavery the
[1:57:48.200 --> 1:57:51.240]  government will come to your house with guns if you don't pay your property
[1:57:51.240 --> 1:57:54.400]  taxes and you don't leave your house they will come with guns and steal it and
[1:57:54.400 --> 1:57:59.400]  if you resist they'll kill you I mean indentured serves paid about 20% of
[1:57:59.400 --> 1:58:04.760]  their earnings in feudal Europe the average American pays around 60% some
[1:58:04.760 --> 1:58:11.560]  form of taxes I don't know I pay 40% more than slaves in Europe did there's a
[1:58:11.560 --> 1:58:16.120]  total control grid going into place look V for victory good victory for whoever's

[2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:52.960]  them down and say okay you got questions for me I got questions for you and they'll
[2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:56.000]  sit there and kind of joke about stuff when I tell them what's happening and I
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:00.560]  go you know this isn't you know this country in going the right direction you

[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:16.960]  history of it but it's that dag blasted comment board and the comments on the
[2:03:16.960 --> 2:03:22.040]  stories they can show up with subpoenas for records and it's not fun it's
[2:03:22.040 --> 2:03:30.080]  happened twice other time they showed up asking for stuff another time the ATF
[2:03:30.080 --> 2:03:37.520]  came by investigating the firebombing of the governor's mansion but you know I'm
[2:03:37.520 --> 2:03:41.920]  a guy in the right I mean I really do my best to follow all the laws even if
[2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:46.000]  they're unconstitutional because I've got to have a very clean nose I'm gonna
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:49.800]  have an extremely clean nose and everything I do because I'm under total
[2:03:49.800 --> 2:03:57.680]  surveillance and you know I haven't eaten anything since about 6 30 last night
[2:03:57.680 --> 2:04:02.120]  I had some carrots and some rice and I hope that lunch gets here because I need
[2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:06.120]  my energy to call the Department of Homeland Security you know it was like
[2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:11.680]  a burden to confront Carl Rove Sunday and I didn't really fully confront him I
[2:04:11.680 --> 2:04:14.960]  just said I'm not eating next to the equivalent of Hitler that guy's a war
[2:04:14.960 --> 2:04:18.080]  criminal we're leaving we were sitting right next to him so I mean I guess
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:23.960]  that's a protest in a way I I should have gotten his face but yeah I've gotten
[2:04:23.960 --> 2:04:27.040]  in so many people's faces and I'm really just sick of looking at him I mean I

[2:07:59.320 --> 2:08:08.920]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[2:08:16.840 --> 2:08:22.920]  I'm going to call the White House live on air I'm gonna call the Department of
[2:08:22.920 --> 2:08:31.200]  Homeland Security live on air I called Sunday the Dallas FBI and I brought up
[2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:37.600]  Anwar all a locky and other top terrorists at the Pentagon months after
[2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:42.040]  9-11 why isn't that being investigated CIA aircraft crashes full of cocaine
[2:08:42.040 --> 2:08:49.320]  they're not investigating that two trillion back in 2001 now it's over four
[2:08:49.320 --> 2:08:52.240]  trillion congressional hearings missing but they're not investigating it
[2:08:52.240 --> 2:08:58.840]  so I'm gonna be calling them all live on air and also report that that we got to
[2:08:58.840 --> 2:09:02.560]  see something say something flyer you know that's got the guy in the airport
[2:09:02.560 --> 2:09:05.800]  looking at people and you're not sure if he's supposedly the terrorist or he's
[2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:09.280]  looking at the terrorists all about this paranoia you know trust no one but
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:15.240]  your government trust no one big brother and big brothers watching I also want to
[2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:20.360]  tell them that this Homeland Security number we called a few months ago that's
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:26.520]  on see something something flyers now is not being answered and Bob Barr's
[2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:32.040]  lawsuit has not been answered or his foyer request before a lawsuit has not
[2:09:32.040 --> 2:09:35.120]  been answered and they're supposed to respond to that that we should probably
[2:09:35.120 --> 2:09:43.600]  get Bob Barr's organization or Bob Bar himself to pop back in on the show this
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:47.000]  week to see where that foyer went because what a week or two ago that the
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:53.040]  deadline passed and we had the the director of Liberty Guard on the show
[2:09:53.040 --> 2:09:56.720]  we've also had Bob Bar on the founder of it so we're gonna be talking about all
[2:09:56.720 --> 2:10:00.440]  of that but I'll be honest with you this radio show does need your prayers
[2:10:00.440 --> 2:10:09.400]  because our profile is shooting up like a rocket and at a fleshly level I am not
[2:10:09.400 --> 2:10:13.960]  pleased by I'm not stupid and I understand the dangers of engaging
[2:10:13.960 --> 2:10:17.720]  these crooks and the dangers of really exposing what they're doing and it's by
[2:10:17.720 --> 2:10:22.680]  the grace of God I'm still above ground and not pushing daisies it's by the
[2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:26.080]  grace of God I haven't been set up they've certainly tried it's by the
[2:10:26.080 --> 2:10:31.920]  grace of God and I my flesh you know my my own human desires are I want to
[2:10:31.920 --> 2:10:36.480]  travel I want to oil paint I want to stay at home and play with my children I
[2:10:36.480 --> 2:10:41.120]  want to you know go on trips with my wife I want to take my son and my
[2:10:41.120 --> 2:10:45.120]  daughter's fishing and I don't get a chance to do a lot of that because I'm
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:51.640]  completely focused on this mission and every day I have this passionate deep
[2:10:51.640 --> 2:10:56.000]  desire to quit and to just walk away from all of this they're having to manage
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:00.640]  people and deal with things and and I'm not complaining you know you know the
[2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:10.640]  rigors of life out there as well but when I routinely get called by huge
[2:11:10.640 --> 2:11:13.600]  Hollywood stars who want to talk to me but don't want to go on air when I
[2:11:13.600 --> 2:11:17.560]  routinely get called by you know some of the biggest rock band leaders in the
[2:11:17.560 --> 2:11:21.640]  world when I get calls from powerful politicians that want to talk off record
[2:11:21.640 --> 2:11:27.360]  it isn't like an ego thing of wow I'm I'm really big wow I'm able to push
[2:11:27.360 --> 2:11:32.960]  stories out nationwide wow it's more of man I am at the front end of this thing
[2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:39.960]  tip of the spear hitting the bar bar and it isn't even fear that I have of being
[2:11:39.960 --> 2:11:50.040]  killed or in prison it's not fear it is remorse it is almost like I'm
[2:11:50.040 --> 2:11:57.440]  nostalgic for the life I could have had but the globalist took all of the
[2:11:57.440 --> 2:12:01.440]  liberties we could have had in the future I mean they're putting a system in
[2:12:01.440 --> 2:12:05.160]  that's destroying our future and and and and and and so they've got to be
[2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:11.960]  responded to but this is not fun or a game I have gallows humor I try to have
[2:12:11.960 --> 2:12:19.280]  a stiff upper lip and you know put my chin up but I don't even like being this
[2:12:19.280 --> 2:12:25.880]  leader I don't see myself is that great I don't enjoy going and speaking to big
[2:12:25.880 --> 2:12:29.400]  crowds of people though folks will remark I'm about as good as it gets at
[2:12:29.400 --> 2:12:32.320]  public speaking because I speak from the heart and people connect with that
[2:12:32.320 --> 2:12:38.400]  it's electric I like shaking their hands and I like seeing them but I don't
[2:12:38.400 --> 2:12:41.680]  like how they're looking at me like I've got all the answers because I know how
[2:12:41.680 --> 2:12:47.960]  weak I am I know how human I am I I know somebody's got to call Homeland
[2:12:47.960 --> 2:12:52.600]  Security and call them out you think it's fun doing that I know why so many
[2:12:52.600 --> 2:12:56.920]  listeners that see me in the last few times I've done this they hear these
[2:12:56.920 --> 2:13:01.000]  calls and and they they say on YouTube everywhere these aren't real I mean you
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:05.160]  can hear me dialing the public numbers you can hear the tones anybody who knows
[2:13:05.160 --> 2:13:08.080]  worked in telephone systems knows I mean though we're dialing the numbers
[2:13:08.080 --> 2:13:12.160]  we're we're calling them but people can't believe that someone has courage they
[2:13:12.160 --> 2:13:15.920]  can't believe someone is real because they don't believe in themselves and so
[2:13:15.920 --> 2:13:20.160]  that's my job to show you what you can do because you can surpass everything
[2:13:20.160 --> 2:13:26.800]  I've done and until the last few years I haven't really seen other talk show
[2:13:26.800 --> 2:13:33.240]  host I haven't really seen other leaders stand up who really are starting to get
[2:13:33.240 --> 2:13:39.160]  it but my understanding my paradigm analysis my full spectrum analysis is
[2:13:39.160 --> 2:13:45.800]  now being adopted across the board even by my detractors and I love it it is a
[2:13:45.800 --> 2:13:50.320]  pleasure to be attacked because they haven't grown enough spiritually to not
[2:13:50.320 --> 2:13:52.880]  be jealous and envious and they're not even conscious of it and they're
[2:13:52.880 --> 2:13:57.920]  projecting their own shortcomings on to me and sometimes I do deserve it but it
[2:13:57.920 --> 2:14:02.240]  is so fulfilling that at least they steal everything we do they steal my
[2:14:02.240 --> 2:14:07.080]  understanding my discernment good good caught me on the head when you come to
[2:14:07.080 --> 2:14:12.440]  the well to drink but drink so you don't die in the desert I mean it's
[2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:17.360]  wonderful it's and I've realized that God does this he takes a tax and turns
[2:14:17.360 --> 2:14:26.360]  them into something good I feel bad for my wife who has to know you know all
[2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:31.280]  these lies are pure disinformation from the mainstream media the think tanks the
[2:14:31.280 --> 2:14:35.920]  ADL the Southern Poverty Law Center the Cointel Pro and I feel sorry for my
[2:14:35.920 --> 2:14:40.560]  children as they grow up that I may not be there to be with them and that they'll
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:45.080]  have to hear further lies because I have become a symbol of resistance not a
[2:14:45.080 --> 2:14:49.840]  perfect symbol but a symbol because I'm real and they will attempt and are
[2:14:49.840 --> 2:14:55.280]  attempting to pull that symbol down and that's why it's important that you be
[2:14:55.280 --> 2:14:58.520]  leaders in your own right because they can pull down a leader they can pull
[2:14:58.520 --> 2:15:04.160]  down a symbol an image if it's a person but an idea is unstoppable ideas are
[2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:15.640]  bulletproof I'm flesh and blood we're all gonna die but I realize that we're
[2:15:15.640 --> 2:15:20.120]  gonna win this thing I could see I could see that we can come out of this
[2:15:20.120 --> 2:15:26.240]  storm if we believe in each other if we ask God for guidance you know I am I
[2:15:26.240 --> 2:15:32.800]  ask callers to pray on Monday for Ramah govern so that he doesn't have a
[2:15:32.800 --> 2:15:36.720]  relapse of his lymphatic cancer he's gonna get the results back let's call
[2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:42.080]  him see what the results were I asked folks to pray for me and I pray for you
[2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:47.960]  every night and I pray for my enemies I pray that my enemies have their eyes
[2:15:47.960 --> 2:15:54.440]  opened because I don't want them to live their life and serve the dark side and
[2:15:54.440 --> 2:15:58.200]  not have a chance to experience with those of us that love God and love
[2:15:58.200 --> 2:16:03.240]  liberty and have discernment have have had a chance to experience I I love
[2:16:03.240 --> 2:16:10.240]  humanity I am an enemy of those that are coldly calculating and evil and who
[2:16:10.240 --> 2:16:14.280]  use the knowledge of how humanity really operates against humanity it is a
[2:16:14.280 --> 2:16:23.880]  great crime but at the same time I don't hate them maybe a decade ago I had
[2:16:23.880 --> 2:16:27.600]  some hate but when you see me get angry and yelling scream it's frustration it's
[2:16:27.600 --> 2:16:36.120]  desperation it's also energy and and and and and and my soul swelling with the
[2:16:36.120 --> 2:16:41.760]  desire to have people have their chains unleashed including my chains the
[2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:48.320]  changes of the flesh you know on Monday also said let's pray for Charlie Sheen
[2:16:48.320 --> 2:16:53.240]  I know Charlie really well I'm one of his only really good private friends he
[2:16:53.240 --> 2:16:59.800]  doesn't have many people that are really his friends and Charlie didn't hear me
[2:16:59.800 --> 2:17:04.160]  save for folks to pray but but he's called me we've talked quite a bit in
[2:17:04.160 --> 2:17:13.480]  the last few days and he's at home and he's he told me that about 95% of what's
[2:17:13.480 --> 2:17:21.280]  in the news was just complete lies but he said you know basically he has relapsed
[2:17:21.280 --> 2:17:24.720]  a little bit into behaviors he had a decade ago and people say well then
[2:17:24.720 --> 2:17:30.080]  why are you his friend well I mean I've got sin I'm not perfect I have all those
[2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:38.360]  same desires and he's a good person he's somebody who's gone almost a decade
[2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:43.160]  without drinking and without you know doing other bad things things that are
[2:17:43.160 --> 2:17:53.600]  destructive when they're when they're using excess certainly drugs and I mean
[2:17:53.600 --> 2:17:58.480]  think about Charlie Sheen growing up in Hollywood royalty 14 years old being in
[2:17:58.480 --> 2:18:04.440]  big movies 16 being in Red Dawn and everything he's gone through and and
[2:18:04.440 --> 2:18:13.120]  and living in that armpit of Los Angeles around all that evil and that's all he
[2:18:13.120 --> 2:18:16.720]  knows he's got a good family Martin Sheen's a really nice guy his mother's
[2:18:16.720 --> 2:18:19.760]  wonderful his brother's great the rest of his family are really good people
[2:18:19.760 --> 2:18:23.040]  they're not even what you'd think of as a mainline liberal they're against
[2:18:23.040 --> 2:18:27.280]  vaccines they're they're awake to the New World Order I don't even know why I'm
[2:18:27.280 --> 2:18:29.840]  talking about Charlie Sheen you know with all these scandals going on I
[2:18:29.840 --> 2:18:33.560]  haven't talked about it in the last few months but but you know talking to him
[2:18:33.560 --> 2:18:39.280]  you know he needs real friends and and and Charlie needs your prayers because
[2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:48.320]  he's really trying right now you know to slow down and it's just really important
[2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:53.520]  that we reach out to people and then we reach out to ourselves and that we all
[2:18:53.520 --> 2:18:59.400]  help each other and that we not be so judgmental because Charlie has a good
[2:18:59.400 --> 2:19:03.400]  heart you know Charlie will obsess on certain things like anybody else who
[2:19:03.400 --> 2:19:08.200]  he's either all into fight in the New World Order or he's all into collecting
[2:19:08.200 --> 2:19:15.120]  watches or then he's all into astronomy or he's all into beautiful women and who
[2:19:15.120 --> 2:19:18.720]  can blame somebody for that desire
[2:19:21.840 --> 2:19:29.080]  you know I guess what I'm trying to say is that we are a fallen society and and
[2:19:29.080 --> 2:19:35.280]  all of us have done things that are destructive to ourselves and others and
[2:19:35.280 --> 2:19:43.400]  the difference is somebody like Charlie Sheen has a heart that is a mile wide
[2:19:43.400 --> 2:19:48.920]  and a mile deep and somebody like Carl Rove has a heart that isn't even one
[2:19:48.920 --> 2:19:54.360]  inch deep and he's somebody who really does care and he's somebody that
[2:19:54.360 --> 2:19:58.280]  everybody just expects to be bad so even when he's good they say he's bad so
[2:19:58.280 --> 2:20:03.360]  why not be bad but right back this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you

[2:24:16.640 --> 2:24:24.080]  government people billionaires that have called me or come and visited me over
[2:24:24.080 --> 2:24:28.000]  the years almost all of them want to be private they just want to say I support
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:31.840]  what you're doing and that's great but I always say to them well I'm not gonna
[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:36.000]  pressure you to come on air but we need solidarity here and they just say oh you
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:40.360]  know I did I don't want to be targeted well then you give into the overall
[2:24:40.360 --> 2:24:45.960]  takeover by doing that but Willie Nelson doesn't have fear I could call him up
[2:24:45.960 --> 2:24:49.360]  right now I'm probably get him on the show tomorrow but he got a lot of death
[2:24:49.360 --> 2:24:51.680]  threats and things so I didn't want to put him in that position he's come on
[2:24:51.680 --> 2:24:56.960]  three or four times he's talked about 9-11 being an inside job and then when
[2:24:56.960 --> 2:24:59.960]  it got raised on Larry King live last year he went ahead and said it again
[2:24:59.960 --> 2:25:05.120]  incredible courage Jesse Ventura saw the facts of it being an inside job tells
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:09.840]  the truth and Charlie Sheen Charlie Sheen and I know him personally he's a
[2:25:09.840 --> 2:25:15.280]  smart guy he's he's he's interesting he's informed but he has his wild side
[2:25:15.280 --> 2:25:19.200]  and you know that's why I'm saying pray for Charlie because he's trying to
[2:25:19.200 --> 2:25:24.040]  trying to get cleaned up again and he's told me and I know he didn't lie to me
[2:25:24.040 --> 2:25:28.200]  almost all of its made up I was talking to him last night and I'm not gonna get
[2:25:28.200 --> 2:25:31.320]  into really what he told me but he was just like I was like why don't you say
[2:25:31.320 --> 2:25:34.280]  then it's not true he goes all then and that just gives it more attention but
[2:25:34.280 --> 2:25:37.280]  he's like not with this woman not with that woman that woman was never at my
[2:25:37.280 --> 2:25:42.760]  house they just lies he's it's incredible because he tells me the truth
[2:25:42.760 --> 2:25:46.240]  and I've seen lies about him in the media before and it's just most of us
[2:25:46.240 --> 2:25:53.960]  not even true but he told me some of it is and and it's just incredible it's
[2:25:53.960 --> 2:26:00.800]  incredible to to watch something like that happen but pray for America pray
[2:26:00.800 --> 2:26:04.680]  for the world pray for everybody to not be weak in their flesh and pray for
[2:26:04.680 --> 2:26:08.000]  Charlie he's got a lot of courage he's got a big heart and I care about him
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:14.280]  okay and I think it's helping I mean I think I know it is I'm gonna call
[2:26:14.280 --> 2:26:16.920]  Homeland Security a minute you remember in the first hour I talked about how
[2:26:16.920 --> 2:26:20.680]  they're removing the fluoride and Calgary they're getting ready to talk about
[2:26:20.680 --> 2:26:24.480]  removing it in San Diego or they just started to try to put it in now they're
[2:26:24.480 --> 2:26:28.240]  trying to block it the vaccines it's coming out with big investigations
[2:26:28.240 --> 2:26:32.240]  causing brain disorders big investigations by even the UN's World
[2:26:32.240 --> 2:26:36.600]  Health Organization talk about Satan investigating BLZ Bob all of that's
[2:26:36.600 --> 2:26:43.280]  going on and the house voted down the extension of the Patriot Act yesterday
[2:26:43.280 --> 2:26:46.480]  now they think they have the votes in another maneuver they're gonna do but I
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:53.080]  said watch the fear mongering is gonna go stratospheric then during the break
[2:26:53.080 --> 2:26:56.000]  before last they brought this article in and I hadn't read it yet but I read it
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:00.400]  during the break here's ABC news I've also got Reuters reporting the same
[2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:06.080]  thing this just came out in the last hour I was not aware of it but I knew it
[2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:10.280]  was gonna happen it's cause and effect jump in front of a freight train going
[2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:14.000]  60 miles an hour it's probably gonna kill you you expose the globalist for
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:17.280]  using the Patriot Act to take over our liberties if it looks like they're not
[2:27:17.280 --> 2:27:19.600]  gonna get it through they're gonna scream bloody murder this is their take
[2:27:19.600 --> 2:27:26.400]  over they've got to keep this in place and what did she say I told you getting
[2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:29.840]  rid of the terror alert system is because they're just always gonna be on
[2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:35.960]  the highest alert now ABC news terror threat most heightened since 9-11
[2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:40.560]  Napolitano says Homeland Security officials call homegrown radicalism a
[2:27:40.560 --> 2:27:46.000]  game changer oh there's a game changer Al Qaeda's gone from sophisticated
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:50.280]  stand-downs of norad men in caves running a tax t-boning all their targets
[2:27:50.280 --> 2:27:57.040]  perfectly to magically now it's people recruited into Islam in prisons set up
[2:27:57.040 --> 2:28:01.960]  and run by the FBI where there's no real Muslim handlers it's the FBI going on
[2:28:01.960 --> 2:28:07.000]  and finding miscreant criminals to hype them up to build fake bombs and go
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:12.440]  carry it out the threat of terrorism is its most heightened states is 9-11
[2:28:12.440 --> 2:28:16.680]  attacks nearly a decade ago US Homeland Security Jan Napolitano said today the
[2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:20.000]  terrorist threat facing our country has evolved significantly in the last ten
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:25.240]  years and continues to evolve so that in some ways the threat facing us is that
[2:28:25.240 --> 2:28:29.920]  it's most heightened since those attacks she said before the House Homeland
[2:28:29.920 --> 2:28:35.120]  Security Committee and this just happened the last hour and a half and it
[2:28:35.120 --> 2:28:39.720]  continues here so she's saying that we are on the verge of attacks it's the
[2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:44.960]  biggest threat ever boom they vote down the Patriot Act yesterday boom she's
[2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:50.800]  testify and saying this threat is incredible we have got to get on this
[2:28:50.800 --> 2:28:59.400]  right now we have got to get involved right now we are in so much trouble the
[2:28:59.400 --> 2:29:04.960]  terrorist are hiding everywhere and she goes on with her quotes one of the most
[2:29:04.960 --> 2:29:08.160]  striking elements of today's threat picture is that the plots to attack
[2:29:08.160 --> 2:29:11.640]  American increasingly involve American residency as always told you they
[2:29:11.640 --> 2:29:14.720]  shift from the foreign al-Qaeda in the caves because then they wanted to go
[2:29:14.720 --> 2:29:17.320]  attack and invade country so they claim that's where it was coming from and
[2:29:17.320 --> 2:29:23.520]  staged it now they're finding low-grade morons to create an artificial
[2:29:23.520 --> 2:29:28.520]  synthetic threat here and she says so it's Americans and a home grown and
[2:29:28.520 --> 2:29:32.880]  they're everywhere right as the sea something say something tele screens
[2:29:32.880 --> 2:29:40.200]  roll out oh magically now Janet Napolitano is there to save us oh we need
[2:29:40.200 --> 2:29:44.320]  the Patriot Act there's domestic groups white al-Qaeda they're everywhere
[2:29:44.320 --> 2:29:48.360]  they're gonna get us you see the media roll out now of the domestic control
[2:29:48.360 --> 2:29:51.920]  group we're gonna call the government live on air coming up we're on the
[2:29:51.920 --> 2:29:59.880]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[2:30:15.560 --> 2:30:20.080]  this influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[2:30:20.080 --> 2:30:25.360]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[2:30:25.360 --> 2:30:29.920]  attention fall the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[2:30:29.920 --> 2:30:34.600]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[2:30:38.280 --> 2:30:41.800]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the

[2:35:03.280 --> 2:35:10.160]  did this on Sunday live and report real evidence of terrorism now I'm also calling
[2:35:10.160 --> 2:35:16.120]  the White House first because Friday they wrote a story saying that we were
[2:35:16.120 --> 2:35:21.720]  liars basically dealing with the blackouts and I also want to respond to
[2:35:21.720 --> 2:35:27.040]  that but the definition of terrorism the use of violence and threats to
[2:35:27.040 --> 2:35:31.080]  intimidate or courage especially for political purposes what is the IRS do
[2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:34.160]  they threaten to take your bank account your house there's not really any due
[2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:39.320]  process what do police do all over the country when you film them legally in
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:42.520]  public places they arrest you now the courts keep throwing it out but the cops
[2:35:42.520 --> 2:35:45.560]  don't care they say you can beat the rap you can't beat the ride you're not

[2:35:49.480 --> 2:35:55.640]  handcuffs in Oakland last year they confiscated three cell phones but they
[2:35:55.640 --> 2:35:59.320]  didn't confiscate somebody in a train who'd stopped right across from the
[2:35:59.320 --> 2:36:03.280]  other train and videotaped it and that's how they got they lied and said he was
[2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:07.040]  out of handcuffs he attacked him turned out it was all lies they started

[2:41:35.200 --> 2:41:42.800]  he the communications director that guy's we put that article back up on
[2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:46.960]  screen I'm forgetting his title
[2:41:49.600 --> 2:41:55.880]  what he's the calm the White House here live on air ladies and gentlemen the
[2:41:55.880 --> 2:42:00.360]  little proletariat slave I wonder if they're listening to us right now while

[2:42:04.680 --> 2:42:11.800]  don't know how long we can let this go on I can pull up the blackout story
[2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:14.200]  myself
[2:42:14.200 --> 2:42:25.800]  we're gonna see if they come to the phone here there it is yeah Dan Pfeiffer and
[2:42:25.800 --> 2:42:29.720]  what's his position it's at the bottom you can't believe everything you read
[2:42:29.720 --> 2:42:35.760]  and then you scroll down there to the bottom with that report that is a tissue
[2:42:35.760 --> 2:42:40.040]  yeah the communications director so I was right so he's the communications
[2:42:40.040 --> 2:42:44.400]  director and he wrote this piece and I want to be able to talk to him or
[2:42:44.400 --> 2:42:47.680]  somebody else up there I mean you'd think the average person will say well
[2:42:47.680 --> 2:42:50.960]  you just can't call the White House and talk to you know somebody in in a
[2:42:50.960 --> 2:42:55.200]  position of power well I sure can they're writing news articles about us that
[2:42:55.200 --> 2:43:01.800]  aren't true so I I sure do have a right to call them I guess they're busy there
[2:43:01.800 --> 2:43:05.680]  in the background going to see who they can find or I'm probably gonna be put
[2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:11.840]  the voicemail jaren let's officially start trying to get a hold of them
[2:43:11.840 --> 2:43:15.400]  through channels and see if they'll come on and respond to press reports that
[2:43:15.400 --> 2:43:21.200]  I'm on the White House enemies list and on top of that they're writing these
[2:43:21.200 --> 2:43:27.440]  disinformation pieces about us I think that's important alright folks I'm not
[2:43:27.440 --> 2:43:34.280]  gonna let this go on too much longer here live on air what do you want to bet
[2:43:34.280 --> 2:43:39.880]  she doesn't come back for a while anybody want to place place a imaginary
[2:43:39.880 --> 2:43:49.800]  wager all right that's enough let's go ahead and hang up there we got to get
[2:43:49.800 --> 2:43:56.480]  moving on here let's go ahead and see the luck we have when we call the next
[2:43:56.480 --> 2:43:59.120]  phone number now now the reason I'm gonna call the Department of Homeland
[2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:06.080]  Security is that I called the see something say something 877 number a
[2:44:06.080 --> 2:44:10.360]  few months ago and they did answer and I and I reported what is clear evidence
[2:44:10.360 --> 2:44:18.360]  of terrorism or okay fantastic they're asking me when I'm ready to go ahead and
[2:44:18.360 --> 2:44:23.480]  dial them and so then I call the FBI in Dallas because that was the main number
[2:44:23.480 --> 2:44:27.280]  that came up in Texas I couldn't find the number to the Austin FBI during the
[2:44:27.280 --> 2:44:30.280]  Super Bowl since she was saying see something say something and I reported
[2:44:30.280 --> 2:44:33.280]  on all these instances of government-sponsored terrorism and so now I'm
[2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:38.440]  gonna call the Department of Homeland Security itself and and and ask who I
[2:44:38.440 --> 2:44:43.040]  should talk to from the see something say something operation we should all be
[2:44:43.040 --> 2:44:47.120]  calling the media to asking why these phone numbers don't work let's go ahead
[2:44:47.120 --> 2:44:51.960]  and call the Department of Homeland Security the main number 202 282 8000
[2:44:51.960 --> 2:45:06.760]  see if this works hey this is Alex Jones broadcasting worldwide on the
[2:45:06.760 --> 2:45:10.480]  Genesis Communications Radio Network I've been calling Homeland Security see
[2:45:10.480 --> 2:45:14.040]  something say something publish numbers and they've just been going to voicemail
[2:45:14.040 --> 2:45:19.080]  not even saying it's Homeland Security and and big sis has said that if we see
[2:45:19.080 --> 2:45:23.840]  something we should say something immediately and so I've got some reports
[2:45:23.840 --> 2:45:28.640]  of potential terrorist threats that I'd like to relay but I don't know I don't
[2:45:28.640 --> 2:45:32.360]  know what numbers to call and so I really need to get those and my and my
[2:45:32.360 --> 2:45:35.680]  listeners need to know those numbers as well because again they're putting
[2:45:35.680 --> 2:45:40.560]  telescreens at the Walmart's saying you know kind of watch the other shoppers and
[2:45:40.560 --> 2:45:44.040]  people so I I figured if it's that serious that I better get all my
[2:45:44.040 --> 2:45:49.800]  listeners you know to I guess get signed on to report the the threats Janet
[2:45:49.800 --> 2:45:54.240]  Apolitano is in the news today saying that the terror threat is the most
[2:45:54.240 --> 2:45:58.280]  heightened since 9-11 and she says that we need to have that Patriot Act
[2:45:58.280 --> 2:46:05.520]  reauthorized who should I talk to there well see here's the thing sir DHS here
[2:46:05.520 --> 2:46:09.360]  takes your concern very seriously sir but our partners will local law enforcement
[2:46:09.360 --> 2:46:15.120]  direct all suspicious activity to them sir so through the threat fusion centers
[2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:19.640]  but I've been out but I have DHS see something says something flyers that
[2:46:19.640 --> 2:46:24.160]  has this 877 number and other other numbers you're saying you're saying
[2:46:24.160 --> 2:46:29.600]  that that that citizens cannot report things to our loving federal government
[2:46:29.600 --> 2:46:34.600]  no no sir I'm not I'm not saying that sir but it starts off with the local law
[2:46:34.600 --> 2:46:44.200]  officer okay I think that's what what's the phone number for the head of the
[2:46:44.200 --> 2:46:47.400]  rollout of the see something say something you know what can you put me
[2:46:47.400 --> 2:46:52.320]  in touch with the press office of Homeland Security guys get the number
[2:46:52.320 --> 2:46:58.720]  to the Austin Police Department I'm gonna call them yes that's 3-1-1
[2:46:58.720 --> 2:47:04.160]  DHS public affairs hey this is Alex Jones and I'm broadcasting worldwide right
[2:47:04.160 --> 2:47:08.480]  now from Austin Texas and I've been trying to call numbers on DHS flyers
[2:47:08.480 --> 2:47:12.560]  for see something say something yeah and there's not there's not even a
[2:47:12.560 --> 2:47:15.960]  message it's just a computer voice I called it two months ago was able to
[2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:20.080]  get somebody it routed me to Atlanta and then I'm being told I need to call
[2:47:20.080 --> 2:47:26.440]  local police but but I'm trying to report a federal matter that's going on
[2:47:26.440 --> 2:47:32.200]  there by the Potomac NDC at the Pentagon and you would like to report
[2:47:32.200 --> 2:47:37.160]  something yes I'd like to report it and they told me I I needed to call local
[2:47:37.160 --> 2:47:39.760]  law enforcement
[2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:44.080]  yes you would have to call them and then they interval getting contact with FBI
[2:47:44.080 --> 2:47:48.320]  then they will contact us everything nice and compartmentalized but I mean
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:50.840]  they're setting up federally run threat fusion centers when they're already
[2:47:50.840 --> 2:47:54.520]  getting rid of the Tenth Amendment I mean I maybe I should just call the
[2:47:54.520 --> 2:48:00.040]  Pentagon itself maybe the Office of Security at the Pentagon they may be
[2:48:00.040 --> 2:48:04.000]  able to assist you well ma'am just so you know I mean it's not like something I
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:08.600]  think this is Fox News exclusive al-Qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just
[2:48:08.600 --> 2:48:12.080]  months after 9-11 and they say and we're all along he met with the Secretary of
[2:48:12.080 --> 2:48:15.560]  the Army and others when he was already on the news is one of the top terrorists
[2:48:15.560 --> 2:48:19.280]  and then now they say he's running the underwear attack I'm sure you heard about
[2:48:19.280 --> 2:48:23.680]  that underwear bomber yeah and they say he ran the Fort Hood attack did you
[2:48:23.680 --> 2:48:28.240]  hear about that yeah I've heard about the incident and the Times Square event
[2:48:28.240 --> 2:48:32.240]  so I mean how do I get the federal government to investigate itself I mean
[2:48:32.240 --> 2:48:35.600]  I think that's pretty suspicious that the number three guy in al-Qaeda the number
[2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:40.120]  one field operator is hanging out secretly at the Pentagon I mean I think
[2:48:40.120 --> 2:48:43.520]  that's pretty pretty big news from Fox News do you have a computer in front of
[2:48:43.520 --> 2:48:47.200]  you you're in the press office you just search the term al-Qaeda leader dined at
[2:48:47.200 --> 2:48:52.320]  Pentagon okay I mean could just get can you give that to somebody there I mean
[2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:56.160]  maybe Janet Napolitano can graciously she says see something say something well
[2:48:56.160 --> 2:49:00.200]  I mean I mean I got Newsweek reporting hijackers trained at U.S. military bases
[2:49:00.200 --> 2:49:03.680]  I mean it's right there I all these FBI agents have come out and said that they
[2:49:03.680 --> 2:49:09.400]  were that they were ordered to stand down on 9-11 I I want an investigation of
[2:49:09.400 --> 2:49:22.240]  that okay well ma'am I really appreciate your help thank you so much I mean look
[2:49:22.240 --> 2:49:25.200]  this is a normal response to this I mean look at the articles I want to bring up
[2:49:25.200 --> 2:49:31.360]  to him I want to bring up the trillions missing from the Pentagon now the
[2:49:31.360 --> 2:49:34.840]  lawyer has sued Jesse Trinity we're gonna try to get him on soon he's got
[2:49:34.840 --> 2:49:41.520]  new documents confirming FBI got warning day before okc bombing and and and and
[2:49:41.520 --> 2:49:47.760]  how the feds tried to block it and of course I've interviewed the the
[2:49:47.760 --> 2:49:51.240]  emergency responders and others the ATF wasn't in the building that day they
[2:49:51.240 --> 2:49:59.000]  were told not to go in but we're gonna come back from break dialing hot to the
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:03.720]  APD we probably want to call the detectives office because what's gonna
[2:50:03.720 --> 2:50:10.560]  happen is if we call 3-1-1 it's gonna be an operator so I've had the direct
[2:50:10.560 --> 2:50:13.680]  number to detectives before when we're getting death threats I go ahead and
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:17.640]  file those now when the idiots are stupid enough in Austin to call me
