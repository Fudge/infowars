[00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:06.425]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.425 --> 00:00:08.186]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:09.946]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.946 --> 00:00:11.527]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.527 --> 00:00:13.087]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:17.268]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.268 --> 00:00:24.770]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.451]  Well, I've decided today.
[00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:30.246]  To have wide open telephones.
[00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:36.652]  Also, later in the third hour, I'm going to make some calls to Homeland Security, see something, say something.
[00:00:36.652 --> 00:00:44.419]  We've called multiple numbers that they put out publicly, and the voicemail doesn't even declare that it is Homeland Security.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:59.203]  And if the terror threat is so imminent that we could all basically be killed by evil terrorists hiding under our beds, if we don't give all of our freedoms up to the bankers, then why aren't they answering their phones?
[00:00:59.203 --> 00:01:03.904]  And if the Homeland Security numbers don't work, I will move on to the FBI.
[00:01:03.904 --> 00:01:09.825]  And I will, A, declare to them that they're not answering their phones, and I will, B, go on and
[00:01:11.058 --> 00:01:17.663]  Cover issues of real evidence of corporate and government sponsored terrorism.
[00:01:17.663 --> 00:01:19.324]  You see something, you say something.
[00:01:19.324 --> 00:01:27.070]  We all need to stand up and talk about Operation Northwoods, the official US government plan to stage 9-11 style attacks.
[00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.891]  We all need to
[00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:38.889]  Exposed that they lied about WMDs to get us into the war Which itself was a false flag attack.
[00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:44.414]  It was a psychological false flag attack Oh my gosh, Saddam can nuke England in 45 minutes.
[00:01:44.414 --> 00:01:45.856]  He may be able to nuke the US.
[00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:48.398]  He's got nukes He's got all this stuff.
[00:01:48.398 --> 00:01:49.720]  We know we sold them to him.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.965]  Yeah We sold we've got the receipts for the chem and bioweapons on and on and on
[00:01:56.297 --> 00:02:15.666]  So we need to continue to point this out and engage government and not be afraid of these federal agents and basically accept the false Hollywood image that they're these invincible men in black and that we're somehow all guilty of something and we've all done something wrong.
[00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:19.428]  And so, oh my gosh, it's so scary to call the FBI.
[00:02:19.428 --> 00:02:21.989]  It's so scary to call Homeland Security.
[00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:46.256]  I've noticed, just scanning over comments on InfoWars and Prison Planet since I called Homeland Security on Sunday, and the phone number picked up but went to a computer voicemail, a number we'd called months before, a number that's publicly listed on the Homeland Security website, and it just went to a robot answering system, not even declaring that it was Homeland Security.
[00:02:46.256 --> 00:02:48.477]  And I noticed that people couldn't believe it was real.
[00:02:49.997 --> 00:02:53.981]  Because they can't believe that someone would actually call the government.
[00:02:53.981 --> 00:03:04.333]  It's kind of like when I shot video of Marines training for gun confiscation and for the arrest of Americans with foreign troops in Oakland, California in 99.
[00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:11.261]  Most people who were kind of mainline TV heads who were uninformed thought it was fake video.
[00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:20.526]  The Coronado landing, hovercraft landing, warrior fighting vehicles, a thousand plus Marines, hundreds and hundreds of foreign troops.
[00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:22.767]  They thought it was fake.
[00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:31.592]  I mean, I still get emails saying I'm lying about cross-species monkeys with jellyfish or goats with spiders.
[00:03:31.592 --> 00:03:34.334]  Doesn't matter if there's hundreds of mainstream news articles.
[00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:36.015]  I'm a liar.
[00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:38.937]  I still get calls saying Gardasil,
[00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:40.446]  I don't believe that.
[00:04:05.455 --> 00:04:09.856]  Philadelphia Daily News, I mean it's everywhere and they just go, no it's not.
[00:04:10.936 --> 00:04:11.456]  No, it's not.
[00:04:11.456 --> 00:04:14.517]  You know, you didn't call Homeland Security.
[00:04:14.517 --> 00:04:16.117]  You didn't call the White House.
[00:04:16.117 --> 00:04:18.198]  We're going to call the White House, too, today.
[00:04:18.198 --> 00:04:19.458]  You didn't call the White House.
[00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:25.760]  Well, I'm going to give you the number out live on air when I call it, and you're welcome to call.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.840]  Believe in yourself.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.762]  Believe that you could call the White House, that you could call Congress, that you could do something.
[00:04:34.762 --> 00:04:38.583]  So many people can't believe this show because they don't believe in themselves.
[00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:40.984]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:04:40.984 --> 00:04:42.685]  I had George Norrie on.
[00:04:42.685 --> 00:04:45.166]  One of many, you know, high-powered guests we interview.
[00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:48.628]  And people are all over the web saying that George Norrie wasn't on.
[00:04:48.628 --> 00:04:50.489]  People say Willie Nelson hasn't been on.
[00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:52.930]  Charlie Sheen, Jesse Ventura, it's all fake.
[00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.431]  The calls are all fake.
[00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:55.792]  We screen the calls when we don't.
[00:04:55.792 --> 00:04:57.112]  I mean, it's just all lies.
[00:04:57.112 --> 00:04:58.373]  I'll get into all the news when we come back.
[00:04:58.373 --> 00:04:58.733]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.374 --> 00:05:01.535]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:08.477]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:05:08.477 --> 00:05:11.018]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:05:11.018 --> 00:05:16.399]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:19.440]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.501]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:28.006]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:05:28.006 --> 00:05:31.388]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:05:31.388 --> 00:05:37.172]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:05:37.172 --> 00:05:38.813]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:05:38.813 --> 00:05:40.114]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:05:40.114 --> 00:05:42.776]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:05:42.776 --> 00:05:47.019]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:48.720]  You can find the video at www.

[00:06:59.497 --> 00:07:04.060]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.961]  Number 1.
[00:07:04.961 --> 00:07:08.384]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.384 --> 00:07:09.264]  Number 2.
[00:07:09.264 --> 00:07:14.148]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.148 --> 00:07:14.888]  It's true.
[00:07:14.888 --> 00:07:19.772]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:20.593]  Number 3.
[00:07:20.593 --> 00:07:24.175]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:27.858]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.078 --> 00:07:28.878]  Number 4.
[00:07:28.878 --> 00:07:31.619]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:35.300]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.100]  Number 5.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.241]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.241 --> 00:07:45.303]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.303 --> 00:07:49.464]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:06.552]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:08.333]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:10.074]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.074 --> 00:08:11.675]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.675 --> 00:08:13.216]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.216 --> 00:08:17.418]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.418 --> 00:08:21.501]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.268 --> 00:08:34.693]  It is the ninth day of February 2011 on this live Wednesday edition.
[00:08:34.693 --> 00:08:38.257]  We are going to have open phones throughout the broadcast today.
[00:08:38.877 --> 00:08:52.026]  You're welcome to call in about government carbon tax systems trying to shut down and successfully shutting down existing power plants, blocking the firing up of new ones that have been completed in places like Corpus Christi, Texas.
[00:08:52.026 --> 00:08:55.008]  The White House responding to us last Friday.
[00:08:55.008 --> 00:08:57.290]  I talked about it some Sunday, but not really since then.
[00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.892]  But that shows the power of the alternative media.
[00:09:00.652 --> 00:09:03.895]  That they're now having to respond.
[00:09:03.895 --> 00:09:13.444]  Obviously the situation in Egypt, what's happening with the economy, but more importantly all the good news that's happening.
[00:09:13.444 --> 00:09:25.576]  The World Health Organization is probing swine flu narcolepsy concerns and it goes on to report that multiple countries are
[00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:37.439]  We are reporting that people are having increased seizures, Guillain-Barre, and of course narcolepsy, which is another neurological disorder where you just pass out.
[00:09:37.439 --> 00:09:46.101]  You could be driving your car, you could be sitting there on the sidewalk waiting for a bus, and you just pass out for a few minutes.
[00:09:46.101 --> 00:09:48.562]  And this is being reported all over the world.
[00:09:48.562 --> 00:09:49.722]  Twelve countries have reported
[00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:59.814]  Suspected cases of narcolepsy linked to swine flu jabs, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday, as its scientists said the findings warranted more investigation.
[00:09:59.814 --> 00:10:01.977]  More whitewashing, that is.
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:31.150]  There's just so much evidence of this, and we warned about it before the 2009, 2010 hysteria going through that winter at the end of 09, the beginning of 010, because we're not rocket scientists here, but we happen to follow vaccines, and we happen to read the inserts that says it's been linked to Guillain-Barré, narcolepsy, and the onset of seizures.
[00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.751]  And other neurological disorders.
[00:10:33.751 --> 00:10:45.015]  I mean, gee, if I buy a box of cereal and it says it has wheat in it, I'm not smart when I say this cereal has wheat in it.
[00:10:45.015 --> 00:10:52.538]  I mean, that's what's so frustrating, is that the media runs around with these hoaxes saying, Dr. Wakefield's been discredited!
[00:10:52.538 --> 00:10:53.398]  He's been discredited!
[00:10:53.398 --> 00:10:54.779]  And he stands up and says, no I haven't.
[00:10:55.748 --> 00:10:57.269]  You lied and said I made this up.
[00:10:57.269 --> 00:11:03.772]  Here's another British medical team, prestigious, that found the exact same thing before I did.
[00:11:03.772 --> 00:11:07.234]  He just didn't know until now that someone previous to him had discovered it.
[00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:09.655]  Of course, what did I say before that came out a few weeks ago?
[00:11:09.655 --> 00:11:13.777]  I said, I've read about this in medical reports before Wakefield discovered it in the late 90s.
[00:11:15.731 --> 00:11:26.934]  Wakefield is just well-spoken and prestigious, and got Jenny McCarthy involved and others, so they looked at him as kind of the figurehead to attack.
[00:11:26.934 --> 00:11:35.456]  But they run these hoaxes, and I expect for them to run another hoax now saying, it's a hoax, no connection to narcolepsy, no connection to Guillain-Barre.
[00:11:35.456 --> 00:11:37.457]  Really?
[00:11:37.457 --> 00:11:42.839]  I can go down to the Walgreens and say, can I have a vaccine, flu vaccine shot?
[00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:43.979]  Oh, but before I do that,
[00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:46.222]  Can I have a little insert?
[00:11:46.222 --> 00:11:53.847]  Oh, no, no, not the fact sheet you try to give me that you've printed up or the federal government's put out for you to issue that's got a bunch of propaganda in it.
[00:11:53.847 --> 00:12:01.512]  I want the little white paper you unfold with the 20-something paragraphs on it that's got the whole molecular breakdown.
[00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:02.153]  I want that.
[00:12:02.153 --> 00:12:05.355]  Of course, you can read those online as well.
[00:12:05.355 --> 00:12:06.496]  I mean, it's like these drug ads.
[00:12:07.584 --> 00:12:12.668]  I was watching some drug ad online last night.
[00:12:12.668 --> 00:12:16.211]  I was watching an ABC News clip on their website and it was like a minute ad for this drug.
[00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:19.313]  And the drug is for eczema.
[00:12:19.313 --> 00:12:24.257]  And it said, now this turns off your immune system and may cause you to get cancer.
[00:12:24.257 --> 00:12:26.579]  Because your immune system is what defeats cancer.
[00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.540]  And when it stops working, that's when you get the cancer.
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.702]  We're all getting cancer routinely.
[00:12:30.702 --> 00:12:32.343]  That's a fact.
[00:12:32.343 --> 00:12:33.284]  That's why it's so dangerous.
[00:12:33.284 --> 00:12:36.526]  They're pushing for universal cancer screening for cancer cells.
[00:12:37.606 --> 00:12:46.157]  And now a lot of scientists have reported that millions of people are going to end up being diagnosed with cancer who don't really have it.
[00:12:46.157 --> 00:12:56.069]  They're going to be put on chemo, which itself might beat the cancer for a while, but then causes all these other cancers, particularly leukemias, in the blood.
[00:12:57.341 --> 00:12:58.942]  But I already know all of this.
[00:12:58.942 --> 00:13:00.762]  The medical doctors I've interviewed have taught me this.
[00:13:00.762 --> 00:13:02.843]  The research has taught me this.
[00:13:02.843 --> 00:13:08.525]  But to sit there and watch a drug ad and it says, yeah, you got eczema.
[00:13:08.525 --> 00:13:09.625]  You got psoriasis.
[00:13:12.332 --> 00:13:14.533]  You've got flaking skin.
[00:13:14.533 --> 00:13:22.155]  This thing, in nine weeks, we see a massive increase in people reducing their eczema.
[00:13:22.155 --> 00:13:24.216]  And it showed people on airplanes smiling.
[00:13:24.216 --> 00:13:25.817]  It made no sense.
[00:13:25.817 --> 00:13:26.637]  Boy, there.
[00:13:26.637 --> 00:13:28.678]  And then it went through all the problems.
[00:13:28.678 --> 00:13:31.179]  Ah, this may cause you to have a heart attack.
[00:13:31.179 --> 00:13:34.340]  This may cause you to get cancer, because it turns off your immune system.
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.381]  If you've had vaccines lately, don't take it.
[00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:41.002]  You also need to be tested for tuberculosis.
[00:13:42.096 --> 00:13:46.519]  Yeah, because if it turns off your immune system, then that tuberculosis will start growing.
[00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:48.280]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:55.425]  And it's exactly what pharmacist Ben Fuchs was talking about us last Friday, that most of these drugs turn off the immune system.
[00:13:55.425 --> 00:13:58.206]  They turn off the immune system.
[00:13:58.206 --> 00:14:03.510]  And there are so many other dangerous ramifications associated with that.
[00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:09.219]  It's like the studies that have linked frequent use of antibiotics to cancer.
[00:14:09.219 --> 00:14:09.939]  Well, of course.
[00:14:09.939 --> 00:14:20.822]  I mean, if this stuff is powerful enough to kill bacteria in your body, and sure, if you've got a gunshot wound and pus is coming out of it two weeks later, and they said they're gonna have to cut your leg off, boom!
[00:14:20.822 --> 00:14:23.282]  It's wonderful, take it, because it's worth the risk.
[00:14:23.282 --> 00:14:29.204]  But these people just, every time their child gets a cold, boom, they're at the doctor pumping it into them.
[00:14:29.204 --> 00:14:33.365]  I mean, most of the kids I know in this country that are friends with my children, they're on antibiotics every month.
[00:14:34.387 --> 00:14:35.351]  It's just constant.
[00:14:36.826 --> 00:14:40.127]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:14:40.127 --> 00:14:46.128]  One of my daughters, for about two weeks, got her lips got chapped and she got a little bit of eczema.
[00:14:46.128 --> 00:14:57.410]  My wife said, I'm gonna go ahead and take her to the doctor, because we couldn't get rid of it, because we couldn't make her wash it five or six times a day, and just put some topical steroids on it, which is what I was saying.
[00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.790]  And so they give us this big bottle of antibiotics.
[00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.210]  They didn't swab it to see what it was.
[00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.631]  They just said, take these antibiotics.
[00:15:04.631 --> 00:15:05.151]  And I said, honey,
[00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:08.069]  You know what I'm gonna do?
[00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:14.551]  I'm gonna obnoxiously, 10 times a day, just over this weekend, because I'm home now, I'm gonna obnoxiously clean it.
[00:15:14.551 --> 00:15:15.931]  It's just a little bitty spot.
[00:15:15.931 --> 00:15:18.431]  And this is a few months ago, because of the dry weather.
[00:15:18.431 --> 00:15:24.893]  And I said, I'm gonna put corticotypic cortisone on it, okay?
[00:15:24.893 --> 00:15:30.334]  And we're not gonna let her run around in the cold all this weekend, like she likes to do, and she's licking her lips.
[00:15:30.334 --> 00:15:32.274]  Boom, two days later, gone.
[00:15:33.188 --> 00:15:39.532]  Now, they just said, here's the pink bottle of whatever type of liquid antibiotic it was.
[00:15:39.532 --> 00:15:41.073]  Just, oh, we're not gonna swab it.
[00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:42.534]  We don't even know what it is.
[00:15:42.534 --> 00:15:46.616]  It's probably just some eczema, dry skin, but there might be some bacteria in there.
[00:15:46.616 --> 00:15:48.697]  Here, just take this.
[00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:53.820]  Just assault her entire gut where the real flora is.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.541]  Get rid of her natural buffers.
[00:15:55.541 --> 00:15:56.382]  Get rid of it all.
[00:15:56.382 --> 00:15:58.123]  Here's this bottle.
[00:15:58.123 --> 00:15:58.703]  Just take it.
[00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:14.030]  And the truth is it didn't go away for a few weeks because I was only doing it in the morning and at night, cleaning her face and applying cream that weekend, just every two hours, boom, putting it on.
[00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:20.354]  But side issue, I said I would get into all of this news.
[00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:23.356]  We've got some really good news today, some wonderful
[00:16:24.386 --> 00:16:25.967]  News, obviously.
[00:16:25.967 --> 00:16:34.029]  A, it's coming out in AFP, Reuters, you name it, that they're having to now basically investigate.
[00:16:34.029 --> 00:16:37.070]  Go ahead and read the insert and you'd have your investigation.
[00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:53.235]  Of course, I've had the former head of the EU Health Commission on who did expose with their panel of doctors that A, the vaccine was dangerous, the H1N1, and B, it didn't protect you from that flu or the regular flu, and C, it lowered your immunity.
[00:16:54.702 --> 00:17:07.210]  Lower it doubled your chances of actually getting the regular flu and of course the British government studies found that the Canadian government see there are real scientists in these governments they're not all crooks just like over 90% of the
[00:17:10.157 --> 00:17:15.559]  EPA and close to 90% of the FDA signed petitions.
[00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:30.563]  In their unions, they got almost all, in 2000, in 2005, and then again last year, to sign on to a petition listing, hey, it's proven that sodium fluoride, one part per million, increases bone cancer sevenfold.
[00:17:30.563 --> 00:17:32.264]  I always say doubling, just being simple.
[00:17:32.264 --> 00:17:34.124]  I went and looked up the numbers again.
[00:17:34.124 --> 00:17:35.945]  Sevenfold in men, threefold in women.
[00:17:36.725 --> 00:17:42.512]  It's clear that it's causing dental fluorosis and bone fractures.
[00:17:42.512 --> 00:17:50.280]  I mean, you've got almost all the government scientists, the government toxicologists, chemists, saying this is bad.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:57.548]  But the bureaucracy on top is controlled by the big chemical companies, and so they just do it.
[00:17:59.218 --> 00:18:10.486]  Continuing with this really exciting positive news, there's a constellation of really positive news and I'm going to mention it now and then come back and cover it and then go to your phone calls.
[00:18:10.486 --> 00:18:13.809]  World Health Organization probes, swine flu, narcolepsy concerns.
[00:18:16.274 --> 00:18:26.276]  Continuing in medical news, Calgary, one of the biggest cities in Canada, removing fluoride from water supply.
[00:18:26.276 --> 00:18:33.738]  City Council has voted 10 to 3, and they are freaking out saying, we're gonna be without fluoride, our health!
[00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:39.579]  And the Council's going, the Canadian Medical Association, the Canadian Dental Association, the U.S.
[00:18:39.579 --> 00:18:42.520]  Dental Association, for six years have said,
[00:18:43.755 --> 00:18:46.077]  Don't have your kids brush their teeth with fluoride.
[00:18:46.077 --> 00:18:48.180]  They quietly put that proviso out.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.883]  You mean almost all the government scientists and private scientists say this is really bad?
[00:18:51.883 --> 00:18:55.207]  We better quietly start phasing this out.
[00:18:55.207 --> 00:18:57.910]  Just like the EPA announced a month ago.
[00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.293]  Oh, we better cut from 1.2 parts per million to 0.7 parts per million.
[00:19:05.123 --> 00:19:06.464]  Out of the water supply.
[00:19:06.464 --> 00:19:16.031]  Oh, oh, and they also on the same day said, hoping people wouldn't notice that they released two things on the same day, oh, by the way, we better phase out spring fluoride on the crops as a pesticide.
[00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:21.575]  It's going through the cell walls of the plants, right through the wall of the grapes or whatever they're spraying it on.
[00:19:21.575 --> 00:19:24.157]  They spray it on basically everything that's grown above ground.
[00:19:24.157 --> 00:19:26.779]  They don't spray it on carrots and things like that that are below ground.
[00:19:26.779 --> 00:19:29.901]  Oh, oopsie, it's bioaccumulating, very toxic.
[00:19:29.901 --> 00:19:31.142]  We better phase this out.
[00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.613]  See, we're winning here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:36.613 --> 00:19:38.915]  They're holding back in San Diego.
[00:19:38.915 --> 00:19:43.760]  The feds have been trying for 50-plus years to get them to floor a date in San Diego.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.983]  San Diego City Council's holding off for an investigation right now.
[00:19:47.983 --> 00:19:49.665]  They're saying, we need to look at this information.
[00:19:49.665 --> 00:19:54.449]  See, they've gone from calling us kook lunatics to now we're really starting to have an effect.
[00:19:54.449 --> 00:19:59.054]  But I've got even better news, more powerful news, on the other side.
[00:20:00.652 --> 00:20:07.093]  This message starts with a great offer from Big Berkey Water Filters, because we don't want you drinking dangerous water one minute longer.

[00:21:33.123 --> 00:21:36.706]  Physical possession of precious metals, IRA rollover, etc.

[00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:47.135]  Take action today, when we are still accepting paper dollars for gold and silver.
[00:21:47.135 --> 00:21:48.416]  Ready for a change?
[00:21:48.416 --> 00:21:50.698]  Call Roger Rao at 1-800-686-2237, extension 178.
[00:21:50.698 --> 00:21:51.979]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237, extension 178.
[00:22:00.245 --> 00:22:01.425]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:22:01.425 --> 00:22:08.388]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:22:08.388 --> 00:22:10.969]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:22:10.969 --> 00:22:16.151]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:22:16.371 --> 00:22:19.313]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:22:19.313 --> 00:22:21.635]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:22:21.635 --> 00:22:27.939]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:22:27.939 --> 00:22:31.322]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:22:31.322 --> 00:22:37.146]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:22:37.146 --> 00:22:38.807]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:22:38.807 --> 00:22:40.108]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:22:40.108 --> 00:22:42.790]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.211]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:22:44.471 --> 00:22:47.015]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:22:47.015 --> 00:22:51.582]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:22:51.582 --> 00:22:54.186]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.761]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[00:23:02.761 --> 00:23:03.442]  No kidding!
[00:23:03.442 --> 00:23:07.824]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[00:23:07.824 --> 00:23:10.585]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[00:23:10.585 --> 00:23:14.047]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[00:23:14.047 --> 00:23:19.069]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.

[00:23:40.657 --> 00:23:42.677]  That's ReusableCanningLids.com for Tadler Reusable Canning Lids.
[00:23:42.677 --> 00:23:43.637]  The original since 1976.
[00:24:05.313 --> 00:24:08.080]  Strange days are here.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.423]  Strange days have found us.
[00:24:16.089 --> 00:24:21.794]  Okay, going back over some of the good news and some of the other good news I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:25.958]  Of course, the World Health Organization probes swine flu narcolepsy concerns.
[00:24:25.958 --> 00:24:28.821]  Twelve countries in Europe reporting it.
[00:24:28.821 --> 00:24:32.785]  And on top of it, also Australia's reporting deaths.
[00:24:32.785 --> 00:24:34.826]  Several other nations are as well.
[00:24:36.189 --> 00:24:37.629]  Again, we're proven 100% right.
[00:24:37.629 --> 00:24:38.970]  We predicted all of this.
[00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.310]  We're not rocket scientists.
[00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.331]  It was all on the insert.
[00:24:42.331 --> 00:24:44.011]  The devil is in the details.
[00:24:44.011 --> 00:24:51.814]  They leave little provisos there to cover their hind ends because these vaccine makers are given immunity as long as they put it on the label.
[00:24:51.814 --> 00:24:53.554]  Hey, you want to buy this poison?
[00:24:53.554 --> 00:24:55.815]  Go ahead.
[00:24:55.815 --> 00:25:00.936]  Continuing, Calgary removing fluoride from water supply, CBC.
[00:25:00.936 --> 00:25:05.618]  Calgary City Council has voted 10 to 3 in favor of removing fluoride from the city's drinking water.
[00:25:06.957 --> 00:25:11.026]  Calgary City Council has voted 10-3 in favor of removing fluoride again from the water.
[00:25:11.026 --> 00:25:14.114]  Two members of council, Mayor Neheed.
[00:25:15.604 --> 00:25:23.651]  And Brian Pencott, we're out of town, but it doesn't matter because it was the 10 to 3 vote.
[00:25:23.651 --> 00:25:25.572]  And it continues there.
[00:25:25.572 --> 00:25:30.336]  The council also rejected the idea of referring the matter to an expert panel.
[00:25:30.336 --> 00:25:34.260]  Yes, of people paid off by the chemical industry.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:40.085]  Since 1989, 53% of Calgarians voted in favor of adding the fluoride back when they were brainwashed.
[00:25:40.085 --> 00:25:41.286]  Two years later, it was added.
[00:25:42.006 --> 00:25:52.093]  They're talking about at least banning it until there can be a plebiscite or a Greek-style vote put to the city.
[00:25:52.093 --> 00:25:54.815]  So the fight is certainly on there.
[00:25:54.815 --> 00:26:06.783]  But you know, under a democracy, if 51% in Calgary or in New York or in Austin, Texas vote to put a poison in the water, it happens.
[00:26:06.783 --> 00:26:07.684]  Not in a republic.
[00:26:09.798 --> 00:26:13.302]  A democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:26:13.302 --> 00:26:17.887]  In a democracy, 51% can vote to take the property of the other 49.
[00:26:17.887 --> 00:26:22.973]  Or to the extreme, to put you in gas chambers, if they want, or firing squads.
[00:26:22.973 --> 00:26:24.454]  Or to make you walk the plank.
[00:26:24.454 --> 00:26:25.175]  Whatever they want!
[00:26:26.036 --> 00:26:29.939]  To put you in the end of a Saturn rocket and shoot you off the moon against your will.
[00:26:29.939 --> 00:26:39.367]  In a democracy, in a republic, there's absolute rights of the individual that the mob or the corrupt government cannot take away.
[00:26:39.367 --> 00:26:40.988]  That's the difference.
[00:26:40.988 --> 00:26:48.474]  What have you given us, Mr. Franklin, when they came out after the Declaration of Independence and he said, a republic, madam, if you can keep it.
[00:26:50.529 --> 00:26:57.132]  And there were similar statements years later when they officially got the Constitution and Bill of Rights in place.
[00:26:57.132 --> 00:27:06.956]  So, that is certainly good news, but the media up in Canada is trying to spin it.
[00:27:06.956 --> 00:27:09.578]  This is a more fair article out of Canada.com.
[00:27:09.578 --> 00:27:12.119]  It says, vote to rid city water of fluoride passes.
[00:27:13.288 --> 00:27:19.613]  But then, the next article out of the Toronto Sun has a very grave statement.
[00:27:19.613 --> 00:27:22.636]  It says, Calgary could lose fluoride.
[00:27:22.636 --> 00:27:26.799]  And it goes on to talk about, oh, the poor children.
[00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:28.821]  The poor, poor children.
[00:27:28.821 --> 00:27:31.283]  It's just terrible.
[00:27:31.283 --> 00:27:41.952]  And of course, as I mentioned earlier, after 50 plus years, that's what the San Diego paper reported, of the federal government lobbying
[00:27:44.065 --> 00:27:48.707]  San Diego to put one part per million in the water.
[00:27:48.707 --> 00:28:07.016]  They passed it finally last year, and now because of scientific evidence brought in testimony by scientists and to the environmental board, they're saying, whoa, whoa, and their own technicians and engineers and toxicologists at the water treatment facility are saying, ah, see, because the tide has turned.
[00:28:07.016 --> 00:28:09.537]  And so they're saying, let's do an investigation here.
[00:28:09.537 --> 00:28:10.918]  Let's not go ahead and do this.
[00:28:11.798 --> 00:28:14.140]  Do you realize the victories we're having?
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.061]  And we can do the same thing on health care.
[00:28:16.061 --> 00:28:18.883]  They're set to start stripping funding next week.
[00:28:18.883 --> 00:28:39.437]  The Senate's already passed the shoot-down of if you do $600 of total business a year selling beanie babies or pocket knives or whatever the case may be on eBay, that you've now got to do a filing specifying each individual sale, making us surveil ourselves, guilty until proven innocent, paying our taxes to the private Federal Reserve.
[00:28:40.913 --> 00:28:46.419]  Here's the next piece of super good news, but the globalist will respond to this.
[00:28:46.419 --> 00:28:51.584]  You can be absolutely assured to try to discredit
[00:28:52.642 --> 00:29:01.727]  Those of us out there that want to keep the Bill of Rights and Constitution, you can be absolutely 100% assured they are going to stage something.
[00:29:01.727 --> 00:29:20.638]  Some bombings they foil, and watch, they would have used the Patriot Act or sneak and peek or warrantless wiretapping to do it, and they'll say, see, we stopped Habib Ahmed from doing this, and we did it with the Patriot Act, but it's now about to be rescinded.
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:22.380]  Watch.
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.163]  Look for that.
[00:29:25.163 --> 00:29:26.944]  You know what they're going to do.
[00:29:26.944 --> 00:29:29.206]  Here's the good news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:29.206 --> 00:29:31.789]  Patriot Act extension fails.
[00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:36.372]  Procedural vote expected to return, but a big victory.
[00:29:36.372 --> 00:29:39.976]  Will Fort Detrick have to mail out some anthrax again?
[00:29:39.976 --> 00:29:44.039]  And blame it on somebody in a basement?
[00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:45.560]  Where the bathtub, they said, could make it.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.942]  It turned out it was the most weaponized in history ever known.
[00:29:47.942 --> 00:29:48.203]  U.S.
[00:29:48.203 --> 00:29:49.144]  government super weapon.
[00:29:50.663 --> 00:29:54.589]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.589 --> 00:29:57.272]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.764 --> 00:30:05.788]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.788 --> 00:30:09.031]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:09.031 --> 00:30:13.835]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:30:13.835 --> 00:30:20.221]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:20.221 --> 00:30:22.464]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:23.004 --> 00:30:23.304]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:23.304 --> 00:30:23.805]  Bernanke?
[00:30:23.805 --> 00:30:24.485]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:24.485 --> 00:30:25.766]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.766 --> 00:30:28.007]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:41.897 --> 00:30:49.182]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:30:49.182 --> 00:30:58.287]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:31:02.298 --> 00:31:06.279]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:06.279 --> 00:31:15.121]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:31:15.121 --> 00:31:19.762]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:31:19.762 --> 00:31:30.564]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:31:31.204 --> 00:31:40.727]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:40.727 --> 00:31:46.149]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:53.632]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:53.632 --> 00:31:56.393]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:32:00.288 --> 00:32:01.448]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:32:01.448 --> 00:32:08.391]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:32:08.391 --> 00:32:10.952]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:32:10.952 --> 00:32:16.314]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:32:16.314 --> 00:32:19.355]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:32:19.355 --> 00:32:21.416]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:32:21.676 --> 00:32:27.921]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:32:27.921 --> 00:32:31.304]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:32:31.304 --> 00:32:37.089]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:38.730]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.031]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:32:40.031 --> 00:32:42.713]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:32:42.713 --> 00:32:46.937]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:32:46.937 --> 00:32:48.958]  You can find the video at www.
[00:32:49.719 --> 00:32:52.040]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.381]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[00:32:54.381 --> 00:32:56.522]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[00:33:28.536 --> 00:33:30.037]  I knew too much.
[00:33:30.037 --> 00:33:32.819]  Does that make me crazy?
[00:33:32.819 --> 00:33:33.279]  Possibly.
[00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:08.596]  But think twice.
[00:34:08.596 --> 00:34:12.418]  Or even think once.
[00:34:12.418 --> 00:34:22.124]  Don't just respond to the information the global is pushing you, like a spectator, actually analyze it.
[00:34:22.124 --> 00:34:24.086]  Think about it.
[00:34:24.086 --> 00:34:26.367]  Roll around in your mind.
[00:34:26.367 --> 00:34:28.949]  Thinking, consciously thinking is the beginning
[00:34:30.296 --> 00:34:32.997]  Of true liberty.
[00:34:32.997 --> 00:34:39.839]  My heroes have always lived their life out on the edge.
[00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:52.063]  And I hope that when my time's up, people know that I did the best I could to truly be on the cutting edge and to truly challenge folks to live a life of fulfillment and freedom.
[00:34:52.063 --> 00:34:56.924]  And that only comes through a dedication to liberty and a dedication to goodness.
[00:34:56.924 --> 00:34:59.065]  And that doesn't mean I'm on some moral high horse.
[00:35:00.626 --> 00:35:06.333]  But the greatest moral factor is courage.
[00:35:06.333 --> 00:35:07.675]  And that's something we're lacking.
[00:35:07.675 --> 00:35:13.982]  But America, that is the sleeping giant, is awakening despite all the efforts of the social engineers.
[00:35:13.982 --> 00:35:15.965]  And that is very, very exciting.
[00:35:17.096 --> 00:35:24.082]  Now, I just covered how all over the world, and I've got other reports in Europe, they're removing fluoride.
[00:35:24.082 --> 00:35:26.784]  The people are going and taking over their city councils.
[00:35:26.784 --> 00:35:36.632]  They're going over and over again every week with scientists and doctors and citizens reading facts, and the city council first laughs, and then a year later they repeal it.
[00:35:38.857 --> 00:35:39.798]  Same thing in Austin.
[00:35:39.798 --> 00:35:49.604]  Months ago they were laughing about people not wanting the TSA sticking their hands down their pants at the Berkshire International Airport or the naked body scanners going in.
[00:35:49.604 --> 00:35:51.265]  That's what's happened now.
[00:35:51.265 --> 00:35:56.469]  The City Transportation Board has recommended that the scanners not be put in.
[00:35:56.469 --> 00:36:03.113]  There's groups forming, I hear them running radio ads in Austin against it, pointing out it's a police state.
[00:36:04.304 --> 00:36:17.652]  It's incredible, and I can see my influence in this town on air for 16 years, and I can see it in other cities, and I can see your influence, and those that have heard the call and have stood up and been leaders.
[00:36:17.652 --> 00:36:18.832]  It's beautiful.
[00:36:18.832 --> 00:36:33.861]  They're beginning to believe in themselves, and in God's promise that if you stand up and do the right thing and tell the truth and go through the storm, we will get delivered from the hands of our enemies, like Daniel in that lion's den.
[00:36:36.144 --> 00:36:39.947]  So, all over the world it's coming out that the vaccines are killing people.
[00:36:39.947 --> 00:36:48.535]  They're trying to spin it and claim of all the thousands of different studies and reports that it's all discredited, because they say Wakefield's discredited with one study.
[00:36:48.535 --> 00:36:54.940]  Now his study's being duplicated from Japan to Italy, from Germany to Canada.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:56.281]  Their hoax is falling.
[00:36:56.281 --> 00:36:58.163]  The polls show it.
[00:36:58.163 --> 00:36:59.584]  The people are waking up.
[00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:02.727]  The people are waking up and are becoming pro-Second Amendment.
[00:37:04.096 --> 00:37:05.137]  All the polls show that.
[00:37:05.137 --> 00:37:06.378]  Total shift happening.
[00:37:06.378 --> 00:37:08.960]  The people are waking up and becoming anti-abortion.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.441]  They're becoming pro-life.
[00:37:10.441 --> 00:37:11.622]  It's happening.
[00:37:11.622 --> 00:37:18.388]  And that's why the globalists try to pour on the cynicism, the fake moralizing, the bullying of the First Amendment.
[00:37:18.388 --> 00:37:24.112]  It's why they're trying to announce internet kill switches and controls over talk radio, because they're scared.
[00:37:24.112 --> 00:37:25.113]  And they should be.
[00:37:25.113 --> 00:37:27.055]  The globalists have committed a lot of crimes.
[00:37:27.055 --> 00:37:30.117]  They've robbed this country up one side and down the other.
[00:37:30.117 --> 00:37:31.959]  But people are finally responding.
[00:37:34.161 --> 00:37:47.126]  And then of course, I got into the fluoride situation, I got into the vaccines being exposed, and now this super important exciting news, and we'll go to your phone calls.
[00:37:47.126 --> 00:37:49.067]  Patriot Act extension fails.
[00:37:49.067 --> 00:37:52.268]  Procedural vote expected to return.
[00:37:52.268 --> 00:37:59.250]  A plan that would have seen the House representatives extend controversial provisions of the Patriot Act, with little debate, failed Tuesday night.
[00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:03.292]  A group of Republicans joined a majority of Democrats in voting no.
[00:38:03.832 --> 00:38:08.914]  The House voted 277, a beefy majority, to 148.
[00:38:08.914 --> 00:38:11.215]  That is beefy.
[00:38:11.215 --> 00:38:13.156]  That is getting close to supermajority.
[00:38:13.156 --> 00:38:24.760]  The House voted 277 to 148 for the Patriot Act extension, 23 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass it.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.281]  I guess I saw that wrong and am wanting things to be more positive than they are.
[00:38:28.281 --> 00:38:28.621]  The 277 voted
[00:38:32.794 --> 00:38:34.776]  No, that's correct.
[00:38:34.776 --> 00:38:39.880]  The House voted 277 to 148 for the Patriot Act extension.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.741]  23 votes short.
[00:38:40.741 --> 00:38:41.381]  No.
[00:38:41.381 --> 00:38:43.643]  So, I am right.
[00:38:43.643 --> 00:38:47.567]  Most of them did actually vote for it, but at least there's 148 who are moral.
[00:38:47.567 --> 00:38:54.833]  And one person who's in the right against a mob who's in the wrong is a majority of one.
[00:38:58.848 --> 00:39:05.216]  But it appears the bill was controversial enough to convince some two dozen Tea Party backed Republican freshmen.
[00:39:05.216 --> 00:39:07.459]  Now that's a real sign that they're real.
[00:39:07.459 --> 00:39:08.961]  That those are good people.
[00:39:08.961 --> 00:39:13.307]  That they're not neocon, police state, warmonger, tyranny pushers.
[00:39:13.307 --> 00:39:14.088]  This is positive.
[00:39:14.508 --> 00:39:24.014]  But it appears the bill was controversial enough to convince some two-dozen Tea Party-backed Republican freshmen to join a majority of Democrats in voting against it, The Hill reported.
[00:39:24.014 --> 00:39:29.858]  The measure is now expected to return to the House floor for a regular vote that would require a simple majority to pass.
[00:39:29.858 --> 00:39:31.199]  We've got to push.
[00:39:31.199 --> 00:39:37.724]  We've got to do everything we can to pressure them to not fully extend it.
[00:39:37.724 --> 00:39:44.108]  And, of course, I wrote the original analysis of the Patriot Act that won the Project Censored award.
[00:39:45.108 --> 00:39:49.290]  In 2003, and a lot of lawyers read my analysis and actually hailed it.
[00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:52.511]  They hadn't taken the time to read the hundreds of pages and look at the U.S.
[00:39:52.511 --> 00:40:01.394]  Code it listed, but it basically got rid of about five of the ten of the Bill of Rights completely, if they're able to implement it, which they have to a certain extent.
[00:40:01.394 --> 00:40:03.815]  It's one thing to pass something, it's another thing to actually implement it.
[00:40:03.815 --> 00:40:06.636]  And another two of the amendments it seriously damaged.
[00:40:06.636 --> 00:40:09.457]  And Patriot Act 2 would have gotten rid of everything, but they didn't get that.
[00:40:13.083 --> 00:40:20.694]  We've had 800 plus cities move to block the Patriot Act locally and instruct the police and sheriff's deputies to follow the Constitution.
[00:40:20.694 --> 00:40:23.518]  That's all it is, is a pledge to the Constitution.
[00:40:25.037 --> 00:40:35.564]  Five states voted to override the Patriot Act, a good states' rights movement, just like they're moving to block the unconstitutional government-run healthcare.
[00:40:35.564 --> 00:40:37.385]  So, a serious victory.
[00:40:37.385 --> 00:40:41.748]  They may still pass it, but this is the biggest challenge yet.
[00:40:41.748 --> 00:40:45.010]  I mean, what was the Patriot Act passed in the Senate?
[00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:50.474]  Ninety-eight yeas, one nay, and one abstention.
[00:40:53.311 --> 00:40:56.173]  In fact, check me on that.
[00:40:56.173 --> 00:41:01.698]  Guys, October 27, 2001, Patriot Act, Senate vote tally.
[00:41:01.698 --> 00:41:03.819]  Patriot Act, Senate vote tally, 2001.
[00:41:03.819 --> 00:41:05.761]  That should pull it up.
[00:41:05.761 --> 00:41:07.522]  But I know, but I've got to test my memory here.
[00:41:07.522 --> 00:41:16.770]  98 yays, one no, one nay, and one abstention.
[00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:18.431]  One, you know, I'm not going to vote on it.
[00:41:20.843 --> 00:41:27.995]  And you watch, when they try to pass it in the Senate, you're going to see much larger numbers say no, which shows we're repudiating it.
[00:41:27.995 --> 00:41:29.477]  We're saying no to it.
[00:41:29.477 --> 00:41:30.198]  It's a fraud.
[00:41:30.198 --> 00:41:30.799]  It's a lie.
[00:41:30.799 --> 00:41:34.104]  But if they're unable to ram it back through, look for staged terror.
[00:41:35.994 --> 00:41:38.376]  As a way to say, see, we told you so.
[00:41:38.376 --> 00:41:41.178]  You didn't give us the police state, so you caused this to happen.
[00:41:41.178 --> 00:41:43.140]  It's your rights that caused this to happen.
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:46.683]  Well, like Jesse Ventura says, I'd rather face the danger than be a slave.
[00:41:46.683 --> 00:41:52.687]  But I want to play a short video clip of Ron Paul on the House floor yesterday ahead of this being defeated.
[00:41:52.687 --> 00:41:58.372]  And in the middle of the speech, he gets to the heart of the matter, a point I've made ad nauseum.
[00:41:58.372 --> 00:42:03.096]  And that is that if government can sell the precept, the idea,
[00:42:04.468 --> 00:42:04.668]  That's
[00:42:16.317 --> 00:42:22.478]  of Texas, the county of Travis County, settled for $48,000 and change.
[00:42:22.478 --> 00:42:25.819]  I know I talk about this a lot, but it's so incredible, and I see these type of cases all the time now.
[00:42:25.819 --> 00:42:27.059]  I know you do as well.
[00:42:27.059 --> 00:42:37.061]  The woman was out with a group of bike riders in Travis County on a little two-lane country lane, and you run into these gaggles of bike riders, and they just, they'll take over whole lanes sometimes.
[00:42:37.061 --> 00:42:37.861]  You can't even get around them.
[00:42:37.861 --> 00:42:38.841]  It's very dangerous.
[00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:41.621]  It's dangerous for them, dangerous for everybody else, and I like bike riders.
[00:42:41.621 --> 00:42:43.122]  It's just they think they own the road, many of them.
[00:42:43.122 --> 00:42:44.122]  It's like a cult.
[00:42:44.582 --> 00:42:48.604]  They'll cut in front of you and get real aggressive, and they're getting killed all the time.
[00:42:48.604 --> 00:42:52.566]  I mean, it's almost like bike riding rage or something.
[00:42:52.566 --> 00:43:05.292]  I hate to see them behind the wheel of their car, but I don't know the particulars of this lady other than the fact that her filing said she was on the shoulder with a group of bike riders and hit a crack in the ground on the shoulder.
[00:43:05.292 --> 00:43:06.793]  Well, of course, those shoulders are rotten.
[00:43:06.793 --> 00:43:09.815]  I mean, we don't have money to hardly build roads in this country.
[00:43:11.015 --> 00:43:16.739]  Uh, and so, so she flipped off and broke her jaw, and that's the taxpayer's fault.
[00:43:16.739 --> 00:43:20.321]  Folks, when you get on a bicycle, you might get hurt.
[00:43:20.321 --> 00:43:39.893]  When you go on a jet ski, if somebody's on a jet ski and flies off, uh, and hurts themselves because they hit a wave, uh, we'll, we'll, we'll, uh, say at Lake Travis here in Austin, will Travis County, uh, have to pay because they should have controlled the, the waves out there, you know, that the person ran into?
[00:43:43.507 --> 00:43:45.288]  This is a joke.
[00:43:45.288 --> 00:43:53.492]  And so, Ron Paul talks about the fact we have child abuse, we have family violence, do we put a camera in every home to ensure that this doesn't happen?
[00:43:53.492 --> 00:43:56.694]  Sure, it might help somebody, but at the cost of all of our freedoms.
[00:43:56.694 --> 00:44:02.857]  And then in that vacuum of having no true privacy or freedom, tyranny always fills it.
[00:44:02.857 --> 00:44:11.321]  And corrupt individuals in government always use that to enslave and take people's money, and take people's property, and shut down their competition.
[00:44:11.321 --> 00:44:12.782]  That's what tyranny's all about.
[00:44:13.542 --> 00:44:25.554]  And that the old East Germany, it's a historical film, it's accurate to the letter they report, it's the lives of others, about a playwright in East Germany in the mid-1980s,
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:34.102]  And one of his other playwright friends has been banned from being able to put out plays because it wasn't communist enough.
[00:44:34.102 --> 00:44:39.184]  And there's the Minister of Arts who demands to have sex with all the starlets.
[00:44:39.184 --> 00:44:47.167]  If they want to, sure, you want to be able to be in East German TV or East German theater, you've got to have sex with the commissars.
[00:44:47.167 --> 00:44:49.047]  I mean, that's how this works.
[00:44:49.047 --> 00:44:51.228]  And they decide what art you can have.
[00:44:51.228 --> 00:44:54.349]  They decide what you can do.
[00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:56.910]  That's why I'm against government incentives for art.
[00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:04.361]  I'm all for just complete tax rebates, but government can't have any control.
[00:45:04.361 --> 00:45:05.162]  That was my issue.
[00:45:07.421 --> 00:45:18.089]  with the film Machete was that they were blocking films about Waco and things from getting funds because the government didn't want that made and not giving them, you know, millions of dollars of tax incentives.
[00:45:18.089 --> 00:45:25.474]  But Machete was clearly a La Reconquista, La Raza, La Invasora, invasion, takeover film.
[00:45:25.474 --> 00:45:27.515]  Rodriguez is known to be into that stuff.
[00:45:27.515 --> 00:45:29.117]  I got the internal script.
[00:45:29.117 --> 00:45:32.179]  He went in the newspaper and said I was a liar, that I didn't have a script.
[00:45:32.179 --> 00:45:34.821]  And the movie came out and I have the exact script, word for word.
[00:45:35.561 --> 00:45:36.423]  I knew it was a script.
[00:45:36.423 --> 00:45:38.988]  I got it from his people.
[00:45:38.988 --> 00:45:44.819]  And then I separately got it from a Hollywood agent that sent it to me.
[00:45:44.819 --> 00:45:45.801]  I had it in duplicate.
[00:45:46.747 --> 00:45:54.153]  And I just said, look, we need to have the funding pulled if the state doesn't say we will no longer block funds to other people.
[00:45:54.153 --> 00:46:01.259]  See, you cannot have an incentive with government deciding, because that gives them all the power and all the control.
[00:46:01.259 --> 00:46:07.644]  But Ron Paul goes on to talk about liberty versus tyranny in his speech against the Patriot Act.
[00:46:07.644 --> 00:46:11.287]  And, you know, the Houston police chief, what, four years ago?
[00:46:11.287 --> 00:46:14.870]  You can just type into the search engine, Houston police chief wants cameras in homes.
[00:46:16.403 --> 00:46:17.944]  And he said, yeah, this will stop crime.
[00:46:17.944 --> 00:46:19.306]  We want cameras in homes.
[00:46:19.306 --> 00:46:23.049]  I remember three years ago, and now it's over 20,000 homes.
[00:46:23.049 --> 00:46:28.794]  When you have a newborn baby now in England, they said, we're going to put a camera in your house the first month and watch you feeding them, bathing them.
[00:46:28.794 --> 00:46:36.602]  And if we see any mistakes, putting the diaper on, giving them a bath, feeding them, any problems, we're going to take your kid.
[00:46:36.602 --> 00:46:40.185]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[00:46:47.159 --> 00:46:48.842]  Here's another victory.
[00:46:48.842 --> 00:46:54.252]  Inexcusable delay on TSA body scanner safety reports.
[00:46:54.252 --> 00:46:59.962]  The Transportation Security Administration has told members of Congress that more than 15 million passengers receive full body scans at airports.
[00:47:03.203 --> 00:47:07.365]  Without any malfunctions that put travelers at risk of an excessive radiation dose.
[00:47:07.365 --> 00:47:17.231]  Despite the reassurance, however, the TSA has yet to release radiation inspection reports, and they also haven't released the FOIA to Bob Barr's group, for its x-ray equipment.
[00:47:17.231 --> 00:47:27.777]  Two months after lawmakers called for them to make public, following USA Today's request, and what happens is TSA workers are saying, hey, I'm concerned.
[00:47:29.617 --> 00:47:31.458]  I'm concerned about radiation.
[00:47:31.458 --> 00:47:34.119]  And they say you're concerned, you're fired.
[00:47:34.119 --> 00:47:38.180]  You don't have a right under the federal government for job safety?
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.161]  I thought they cared so much about our safety.
[00:47:40.161 --> 00:47:42.242]  And it turns out they lied about the radiation.
[00:47:42.242 --> 00:47:46.883]  One device gives you 20 times, the other system they're selling 50 times conservatively.
[00:47:46.883 --> 00:47:47.744]  New York Times admits.
[00:47:48.635 --> 00:47:50.356]  The radiation they first said.
[00:47:50.356 --> 00:47:56.297]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, have you looked at the photos from the tests that TSA has released?
[00:47:56.297 --> 00:48:02.439]  Where in the images of the scans, you can see the bones in people's fingers?
[00:48:02.439 --> 00:48:04.760]  That's the equivalent of a dental x-ray.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.181]  It is shooting through their hand.
[00:48:08.181 --> 00:48:09.722]  Sure, it's not shooting through the chest.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:17.443]  And the clothing, but if it's going to shoot through, you know, an inch of clothing, a couple layers of clothing, it's going to shoot through your flesh.
[00:48:17.443 --> 00:48:24.326]  And they admit it's the type of radiation that vibrates DNA and causes it to break down.
[00:48:24.326 --> 00:48:26.067]  It's very, very dangerous.
[00:48:26.067 --> 00:48:29.089]  And they're saying that they're going to make people do this.
[00:48:29.089 --> 00:48:31.310]  And there are revolts everywhere.
[00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:35.592]  And, you know, our revolt against the TSA's body scanners has been going on for over a year.
[00:48:35.592 --> 00:48:38.233]  I had a contest a year ago for videos exposing it.
[00:48:39.693 --> 00:48:42.635]  And you notice it didn't immediately stop him.
[00:48:42.635 --> 00:48:47.759]  But then we started beating the drum four months ago again, and then it became one of the biggest stories in the world for a month.
[00:48:47.759 --> 00:48:52.842]  And that didn't beat him completely, but more and more it began, almost like your arm wrestling.
[00:48:52.842 --> 00:49:00.568]  If you don't, when you're arm wrestling, if you don't push and put everything you've got into it, you know you're not gonna win.
[00:49:00.568 --> 00:49:04.671]  I'm just saying, gut up, think about your family, and put every bit of force you've got into it.
[00:49:05.879 --> 00:49:15.041]  You know, they've actually done university studies where, you know, if a woman thinks her child's gonna be hurt, she can beat a big man, you know, at arm wrestling.
[00:49:15.041 --> 00:49:16.521]  Because she's the one that's challenged.
[00:49:16.521 --> 00:49:28.863]  She's the one that's defending, you know, the confirmed reports by police for over 60 years of a woman's baby will be trapped under a car and the woman will go insane and power squat the car off.
[00:49:28.863 --> 00:49:31.383]  And police are like, we just saw the Incredible Hulk.
[00:49:31.383 --> 00:49:34.424]  The brain has an automatic governor in it.
[00:49:35.526 --> 00:49:36.426]  Talk about jet skis.
[00:49:36.426 --> 00:49:42.268]  They've got a Kawasaki Turbo Jet Ski I was reading about that'll go 70 miles an hour.
[00:49:42.268 --> 00:49:47.090]  And it gives you 14% of the power that the engine actually has.
[00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:51.711]  And they do that because they want the torque to pull upwards of three skiers out with a jet ski.
[00:49:51.711 --> 00:49:56.793]  But they can't give you the full power or the thing will go 150 miles an hour and kill people.
[00:49:56.793 --> 00:49:58.173]  It's the same thing.
[00:49:58.173 --> 00:50:00.414]  You're like a Kawasaki Turbo Jet Ski.
[00:50:01.673 --> 00:50:22.418]  You have only got about 14% of the power and they've done hypnosis with Olympic weightlifters that if they can really get somebody hypnotized, but it's not legal to do, you know, the regulations, you know, in the Olympics, but some of them secretly still try to go back and get hypnotized and they train themselves to be able to become hypnotized to get past that governor.
[00:50:23.078 --> 00:50:26.223]  And that's how they just keep breaking, breaking, breaking, breaking records.
[00:50:26.223 --> 00:50:34.114]  It's the same thing of a woman, her kids squealing, mommy, mommy, mommy, and the woman just goes into pure blackout and just goes, just lifts the car up.
[00:50:35.896 --> 00:50:37.597]  Well it's the same thing in the fight against tyranny.
[00:50:37.597 --> 00:50:38.537]  You gotta want it.
[00:50:38.537 --> 00:50:39.317]  You gotta commit.
[00:50:39.317 --> 00:50:43.318]  You gotta think about victory and form that in your mind and then put it into actions.
[00:50:43.318 --> 00:50:44.119]  I promise.
[00:50:44.119 --> 00:50:53.842]  Ron Paul clips coming up and then a full lavish hour of your phone calls coming up and I got a bunch of other just incredible news that we haven't even gotten to yet today.
[00:50:54.798 --> 00:50:56.359]  So it's all coming up.
[00:50:56.359 --> 00:50:58.181]  I am fired up for freedom.
[00:50:58.181 --> 00:50:58.941]  We're on the march.
[00:50:58.941 --> 00:51:00.843]  The empire's on the run.
[00:51:00.843 --> 00:51:02.144]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.144 --> 00:51:07.749]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:07.749 --> 00:51:12.753]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:12.753 --> 00:51:13.233]  It's true.
[00:51:13.233 --> 00:51:16.055]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:51:16.055 --> 00:51:17.797]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:51:18.317 --> 00:51:23.543]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:23.543 --> 00:51:30.671]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:30.671 --> 00:51:31.792]  And here's the best part.

[00:51:44.964 --> 00:51:48.447]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:48.447 --> 00:51:50.188]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:52:00.516 --> 00:52:01.676]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:52:01.676 --> 00:52:08.639]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:52:08.639 --> 00:52:11.220]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:16.621]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:52:16.621 --> 00:52:19.562]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:52:19.562 --> 00:52:21.643]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:52:21.883 --> 00:52:28.186]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:52:28.186 --> 00:52:31.567]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:52:31.567 --> 00:52:37.390]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:39.031]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:40.351]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:52:40.351 --> 00:52:43.032]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:52:43.032 --> 00:52:44.453]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:52:44.713 --> 00:52:47.256]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[00:54:09.718 --> 00:54:11.999]  Infowars.com Steve Watson article.
[00:54:11.999 --> 00:54:12.659]  Poll.
[00:54:12.659 --> 00:54:17.541]  Ron Paul has a greater chance of beating Obama than Sarah Palin does in 2012.
[00:54:17.541 --> 00:54:22.783]  He is, in many scientific polls, including the latest Rasmussen, number one.
[00:54:24.218 --> 00:54:26.945]  In other brass music polls, he's number two under Mitt Romney.
[00:54:31.218 --> 00:54:36.041]  But just politically, she is anti-New World Order.
[00:54:36.041 --> 00:54:39.583]  Michelle Bachman would be a great running mate with Ron Paul.
[00:54:39.583 --> 00:54:47.187]  I hope when he runs, and you can better believe he's going to run, that he gets somebody really strong that's kind of got that electric pizzazz.
[00:54:47.187 --> 00:54:54.912]  And it's going to be the election of women, with Hillary probably running, with Palin obviously running.
[00:54:54.912 --> 00:54:56.933]  And just in political strategy,
[00:54:59.025 --> 00:55:00.186]  Bachman is a good choice.
[00:55:00.186 --> 00:55:02.429]  I'm just telling you right now.
[00:55:02.429 --> 00:55:10.897]  She's not as good as Ron Paul by a country mile, but she's pretty darn good and Ron Paul would certainly continue to educate her.
[00:55:10.897 --> 00:55:12.759]  But very, very exciting.
[00:55:12.759 --> 00:55:17.124]  Let's go ahead and go to this Ron Paul clip on the Patriot Act that was voted down procedurally yesterday.
[00:55:17.124 --> 00:55:18.545]  They're going to try to pass it again.
[00:55:18.545 --> 00:55:18.866]  Here it is.
[00:55:21.434 --> 00:55:22.275]  Gentleman from Michigan.
[00:55:22.275 --> 00:55:34.446]  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased at this time to recognize the distinguished gentleman from Texas, Mr. Ron Paul, for three minutes.
[00:55:34.446 --> 00:55:38.050]  Gentleman from Texas.
[00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:39.011]  I thank the gentleman.
[00:55:39.011 --> 00:55:41.333]  I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks.
[00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:46.232]  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.
[00:55:46.232 --> 00:55:53.016]  I was opposed to the Patriot Act in 2001 and do not believe now that it's a good idea to extend it.
[00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:56.819]  You know, the Fourth Amendment is rather clear.
[00:55:56.819 --> 00:56:01.382]  It says that we should be secure in our papers, our persons, our homes, and our effects.
[00:56:02.222 --> 00:56:14.894]  And that if warrants are to be issued, we have to do it with probable cause and describe, in particular, the places, the people, and the things that we're going to look at.
[00:56:14.894 --> 00:56:20.759]  And I think what has happened, though, over the years has been that we have diluted the Fourth Amendment.
[00:56:20.759 --> 00:56:27.225]  It was greatly diluted in 2001, but it started a lot earlier than that, when the FISA law was originally written.
[00:56:27.785 --> 00:56:28.585]  Well, look at the TSA!
[00:56:51.372 --> 00:56:58.596]  Uh, took us in the wrong direction because the assumption was made, of course, that we weren't spending enough money on surveillance.
[00:56:58.596 --> 00:57:04.618]  And, uh, even though then our intelligence agencies received $40 billion, they didn't give us the right information.
[00:57:04.618 --> 00:57:07.540]  So now we're spending $80 billion.
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:13.423]  But it also looks like, uh, the, the conclusion was the American people had too much privacy.
[00:57:13.423 --> 00:57:17.825]  And if we undermine the American people's privacy, somehow or another, we're going to be safer.
[00:57:18.485 --> 00:57:24.867]  I think another thing that has come up lately has been that the purpose of government is to make us perfectly safe.
[00:57:24.867 --> 00:57:28.248]  Now it is good to be safe, but governments can't make us safe.
[00:57:28.248 --> 00:57:39.312]  I question whether or not we have been made safer by the Patriot Act, but let's say a law makes us somewhat safer, is that a justification for the government to do anything they want?
[00:57:40.332 --> 00:57:55.827]  For instance, if you want to be perfectly safe from child abuse and wife beating, the government could put a camera in every one of our houses and our bedrooms, and maybe there would be somebody made safer this way, but what would you be giving up?
[00:57:55.827 --> 00:57:58.610]  So perfect safety is not the purpose of government.
[00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:03.095]  What we want from government is to enforce the law and to protect our liberties.
[00:58:04.816 --> 00:58:13.204]  This, to me, has been, especially since 9-11, a classical example of sacrificing liberty for safety and security.
[00:58:13.204 --> 00:58:14.705]  Now, I didn't invent those terms.
[00:58:14.705 --> 00:58:24.133]  They've been around a long time, and it's easily justified, and I can understand it, because I was here in 2001 when this came up, and people become frightened.
[00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:25.815]  The American people want something done.
[00:58:27.276 --> 00:58:34.901]  We're going to come back now and start going to your calls and a lot of other important news, but the government's supposed to be the guarantor of liberty, not the enemy of it.
[00:58:34.901 --> 00:58:44.327]  This government is completely backwards from its original mission.
[00:58:44.327 --> 00:58:48.270]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.016 --> 00:58:54.579]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:58:54.579 --> 00:58:55.720]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:59:00.284]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:59:00.284 --> 00:59:06.230]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:08.391]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:59:08.391 --> 00:59:11.054]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:59:11.414 --> 00:59:17.897]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:59:17.897 --> 00:59:20.118]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:59:20.118 --> 00:59:25.460]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:30.742]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:59:30.742 --> 00:59:36.105]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:39.046]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:59:39.286 --> 00:59:42.287]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:59:42.287 --> 00:59:43.068]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:00:05.322 --> 01:00:10.167]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.167 --> 01:00:11.748]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.748 --> 01:00:13.290]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:17.474]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.474 --> 01:00:21.558]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.763 --> 01:00:33.666]  Okay, I will address the V for Victory campaign coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:33.666 --> 01:00:43.013]  It has been one of the most wildly successful operations we've ever launched together, and it's finally starting to hit news around the country.
[01:00:43.013 --> 01:00:46.655]  Newspapers and TV, and that's exactly what we needed.
[01:00:46.655 --> 01:00:56.061]  It's having a giant effect, and it's a symbol against the tyranny, and that we know what the TSA's national rollout and takeover of society is wrong.
[01:00:56.061 --> 01:00:57.642]  Very, very successful.
[01:00:57.642 --> 01:00:58.423]  ABC News,
[01:00:59.223 --> 01:00:59.664]  We're good.
[01:01:26.457 --> 01:01:27.537]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[01:01:27.537 --> 01:01:28.538]  I've got some good ideas for you.
[01:01:28.538 --> 01:01:32.539]  I've got an ironclad contingency plan for any kind of attempted government censorship via internet to
[01:01:55.714 --> 01:01:55.974]  We're good.
[01:02:11.839 --> 01:02:22.505]  No, I know there are a lot of great ways to do that, and actually I sent Kurt an article a few days ago that I read that gave like a whole bunch of ways to get around censorship, and I totally agree with you.
[01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:32.430]  But see, they want to just take over the main web and then make us kind of operate under the floorboards instead of being able to virally spread information on the web.
[01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:39.154]  And so yes, we need to develop alternatives, but in a two-dimensional, three-dimensional model, also fight to keep the web open and free.
[01:02:40.708 --> 01:02:41.789]  Exactly.
[01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:45.191]  I have another idea also.
[01:02:45.191 --> 01:02:51.714]  Think about maybe how you can mobilize people individually.
[01:02:51.714 --> 01:02:53.575]  Let me see here.
[01:02:53.575 --> 01:02:57.858]  By creating maybe a social network for Info Soldiers.
[01:02:57.858 --> 01:02:59.799]  We're doing it!
[01:02:59.799 --> 01:03:00.980]  Awesome.
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:06.963]  So people could get together at coffee shops and mobilize and stuff like that.
[01:03:06.963 --> 01:03:07.944]  Also, one more thing.
[01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:14.643]  About the Federal Reserve, a possible another way to fight them.
[01:03:14.643 --> 01:03:22.708]  I've watched a video called America from Freedom to Fascism.
[01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:23.188]  Yes.
[01:03:23.188 --> 01:03:25.849]  About the Federal Reserve history.
[01:03:25.849 --> 01:03:28.411]  Aaron Russo.
[01:03:28.411 --> 01:03:34.434]  Yeah, and it explains how they operate and how they came about.
[01:03:34.434 --> 01:03:37.036]  What if we could do a class action lawsuit against them?
[01:03:37.828 --> 01:03:40.230]  Well, that is happening.
[01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:46.975]  There are suits on the Federal Reserve for bailouts they've done, for manipulating gold and silver prices, and it is happening.
[01:03:46.975 --> 01:03:48.496]  But more suits are better.
[01:03:48.496 --> 01:03:56.482]  You know, we have all these frivolous suits, and then the system tries to use those as examples to then crack down on our real free speech.
[01:03:56.482 --> 01:04:01.185]  But that's our one way to have a redress of grievances, is those lawsuits.
[01:04:01.185 --> 01:04:02.226]  And I totally agree with you.
[01:04:03.354 --> 01:04:04.254]  Awesome, man.
[01:04:04.254 --> 01:04:06.155]  I guess you're ahead of the game, then.
[01:04:06.155 --> 01:04:07.775]  No, no, no!
[01:04:07.775 --> 01:04:10.796]  You calling in and talking about solutions is what it's all about.
[01:04:10.796 --> 01:04:14.236]  We need to restate them, talk about them, debate them.
[01:04:14.236 --> 01:04:18.117]  But, you know, one way to get around government censorship are these banner campaigns.
[01:04:18.117 --> 01:04:26.359]  You go around town hanging stuff up on light poles, depending on your local laws, where they hang up stuff about dog grooming or
[01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:28.570]  What's going on
[01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:58.097]  I'm back.
[01:05:00.694 --> 01:05:05.257]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.257 --> 01:05:06.157]  Number 1.
[01:05:06.157 --> 01:05:09.580]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:10.440]  Number 2.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:15.343]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.343 --> 01:05:16.084]  It's true.
[01:05:16.084 --> 01:05:20.947]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.947 --> 01:05:21.787]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.787 --> 01:05:25.370]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:29.052]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.272 --> 01:05:30.073]  Number 4.
[01:05:30.073 --> 01:05:32.835]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.835 --> 01:05:36.519]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.519 --> 01:05:37.300]  Number 5.
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:41.443]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.443 --> 01:05:46.208]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:08:02.185 --> 01:08:08.809]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.809 --> 01:08:12.331]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.331 --> 01:08:13.912]  Alright, we're into hour number two.
[01:08:13.912 --> 01:08:19.136]  It is the ninth day of February, 2011 on this Wednesday.
[01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:22.358]  The big ABC TV station in Washington, D.C.
[01:08:22.358 --> 01:08:27.541]  has responded with the most condescending, pro-Big Brother, arrogant,
[01:08:29.056 --> 01:08:34.465]  This is the most piece of unjournalistic trash I've ever seen against our V for Victory campaign.
[01:08:34.465 --> 01:08:37.029]  They call us leftists.
[01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:38.010]  They make fun of us.
[01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:38.932]  They laugh at us.
[01:08:39.958 --> 01:08:45.721]  And they talk about the see something, say something campaign and say that's not spying.
[01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:51.203]  Telescreens telling you watch other shoppers, watch your neighbors, terrorists are everywhere.
[01:08:51.203 --> 01:08:56.045]  They've got a new video they're playing on it saying don't trust the internet, only trust your homeland security.
[01:08:56.045 --> 01:09:00.507]  They're rolling out TSA at the Super Bowl everywhere else, groping people.
[01:09:00.507 --> 01:09:06.670]  Telescreens, government takeover switches in the media, internet kill switches, Patriot Act.
[01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:08.451]  Hey Alex, how you doing buddy?
[01:09:34.082 --> 01:09:39.545]  Hey, first off, I don't know if you've seen this, I got two things I want to talk about.
[01:09:39.545 --> 01:09:43.768]  One is Gardasil, and the other one is Fluoride.
[01:09:43.768 --> 01:09:53.133]  For one, there was an actual TV interview with some doctor on the Medical 18 Fox for Friends.
[01:09:53.815 --> 01:09:57.237]  The title of it is Guard Yourself For Guys.
[01:09:57.237 --> 01:10:00.299]  Shot is FDA approved for boys ages from 9 to 26.
[01:10:24.536 --> 01:10:34.142]  Yeah, yeah, well they actually, the doctor actually said that this stuff is 90% safe and that... 90% huh?
[01:10:34.142 --> 01:10:35.402]  Wow!
[01:10:35.402 --> 01:10:45.989]  Then he said that it would be sexist not to just give it to, to just give it to girls and that his girl patients who were complaining that if we have to take it why don't the guys?
[01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:47.850]  Yeah, see, no, no.
[01:10:47.850 --> 01:10:53.072]  I didn't see the particular piece, but that's the three-year hoax launched by Rick Perry.
[01:10:53.072 --> 01:10:54.453]  He said it's mandatory to take.
[01:10:54.453 --> 01:11:02.616]  What he did is he made it recommended by the health department to recommend it to school kids, and cervical cancer kills less than 3,000 people a year.
[01:11:03.957 --> 01:11:09.021]  Most of it is not associated with the papillomavirus.
[01:11:09.021 --> 01:11:11.603]  There are hundreds of strains.
[01:11:11.603 --> 01:11:18.208]  The Gardasil covers, what, six strains, and it's not even proven to protect you, and then it causes horrible autoimmune responses.
[01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:20.690]  But you notice, you know, he said, oh, it's pretty safe.
[01:11:20.690 --> 01:11:22.932]  You know, sometimes, it's like Russian roulette.
[01:11:24.153 --> 01:11:30.799]  I guess 90% would mean you have a chamber, a revolver with 10 rounds, and you're like, it's pretty safe, go ahead and put it to your head and pull the trigger.
[01:11:30.799 --> 01:11:32.841]  Yeah, go ahead and do it again.
[01:11:32.841 --> 01:11:38.887]  But, I mean, just search the term Gardasil deaths for anybody that wants to see it.
[01:11:38.887 --> 01:11:45.633]  What was the other point on fluoride, the luscious fluoride being taken out of the water supply in Calgary, Canada?
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:52.391]  Okay, well, first thing, I have some information here that in 19...
[01:11:56.505 --> 01:11:57.625]  In 1990, 40 U.S.
[01:11:57.625 --> 01:12:09.428]  dentists brought a case against the American Dental Association, contending that the association purposely shielded the public from data that linked fluoride to genetic defects, cancer, and other problems.
[01:12:09.428 --> 01:12:24.412]  Yeah, that's right, but they quietly capitulated the American Dental Association six years ago and said children under six years of age should not brush with fluoride and toothpaste, and now the government's saying, okay, get it out of the pesticides, okay,
[01:12:25.372 --> 01:12:34.897]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:12:34.897 --> 01:12:37.038]  A couple things.
[01:12:37.038 --> 01:12:45.962]  First of all, as far as the provisions of the Patriot Act not being passed, I'm real glad about that, but like you, I still want to be vigilant.
[01:12:45.962 --> 01:12:49.664]  I actually called my senators and representatives here in Florida.
[01:12:50.259 --> 01:13:08.130]  And you know, it just galled me with that issue that, you know, here the Republicans come out all for it, and yet all these neocons who have this work, and we gotta, you know, annihilate the ragheads and turn Iran into a parking lot mentality, can't see through the smokescreen there, and that there's no difference between both parties.
[01:13:09.408 --> 01:13:20.274]  And I know you use that offensive term to illustrate the racism towards Arabs, but let's try not to use words like that.
[01:13:20.274 --> 01:13:23.996]  Only because it becomes a distraction from the overall information.
[01:13:23.996 --> 01:13:27.778]  But yes, there's this religion of hating Arabs and Muslims, but then...
[01:13:28.978 --> 01:13:46.194]  Turns out the Ford Foundation and the education systems in this country, the Department of Education, for decades have sent tens of millions of dollars a year of textbooks with radical Madrasa-type messages about killing American infidels.
[01:13:46.194 --> 01:13:48.116]  They bring in the radical Muslims.
[01:13:48.116 --> 01:13:50.638]  They force it to be taught in schools.
[01:13:50.638 --> 01:13:52.360]  They want us fighting with each other.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.962]  I mean, if the government really thought Arabs
[01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:56.824]  We're the absolute devil of the world.
[01:13:56.824 --> 01:14:00.907]  Why are they wide open, you know, immigration to this country?
[01:14:00.907 --> 01:14:07.893]  I mean, again, why are they, and I'm not a fan of Hazem Abart, but why are they trying to put the Muslim Brotherhood in?
[01:14:07.893 --> 01:14:11.196]  Because the Muslim Brotherhood wants to basically have war with Israel.
[01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:14.558]  They want a pretext to kick off World War III.
[01:14:14.558 --> 01:14:16.160]  And we've had strategists and
[01:14:18.595 --> 01:14:28.246]  Political scientist on for years saying this was coming and Brzezinski's written multiple books and he's the big architect right now over Obama's foreign policy saying they would do this.
[01:14:28.246 --> 01:14:30.308]  So, it's very important.
[01:14:30.308 --> 01:14:30.789]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:14:31.803 --> 01:14:38.825]  Yeah, the thing I would say about that before I get to my other point real quick is when I say raghead, I'm putting that in quotations as quoting what they say.
[01:14:38.825 --> 01:14:43.466]  I understand, but in this politically correct world, there's two schools of thought.
[01:14:43.466 --> 01:14:48.808]  Use those terms to break the power of them and to let the system know we'll engage whenever First Amendment we want.
[01:14:49.748 --> 01:14:55.812]  Instead of obsessing and getting fetishes over words, instead of what's actually happening to people.
[01:14:55.812 --> 01:15:00.074]  You'll see Arab groups get mad about that term, but not mad about a million dead Iraqis.
[01:15:00.074 --> 01:15:04.456]  You'll see black folks not mad about 51% of their kids getting aborted.
[01:15:04.456 --> 01:15:09.099]  Half the black people not existing, but if they hear the n-word, they go into convulsions of anger.
[01:15:09.099 --> 01:15:10.580]  I understand why Dr. Laura
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.481]  Use that term.
[01:15:12.481 --> 01:15:22.406]  It's because she understood, and I tend to agree with her, that it's silly to give it so much almost religious power, break the power of it, and defend the First Amendment.
[01:15:22.406 --> 01:15:27.949]  You know, I don't get upset when people call in or on websites, you know, call me cracker and things like that.
[01:15:27.949 --> 01:15:29.149]  I have respect for myself.
[01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:31.831]  I know who I am.
[01:15:31.831 --> 01:15:36.393]  But at the same time, I just don't go into those waters because I'm just covering the issues.
[01:15:36.393 --> 01:15:37.774]  But I appreciate your call.
[01:15:37.774 --> 01:15:38.734]  Interesting point, Steve.
[01:15:40.816 --> 01:15:47.206]  She didn't deserve to be boycotted, but that's people's business if they wanted to, for using that word.
[01:15:50.768 --> 01:15:51.468]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:15:51.468 --> 01:15:51.689]  Good, sir.
[01:15:51.689 --> 01:15:52.289]  What's on your mind today?
[01:16:21.464 --> 01:16:33.114]  I've been a long time fan of the show and I've also been a fan of Alan Watt just because he's always so thorough and seems like he's well documented in what he says and everything.
[01:16:33.114 --> 01:16:43.664]  But lately I've heard him say something several times on other shows and there's also audio of it on the web where he said something that's just so provably false.
[01:16:44.932 --> 01:16:49.114]  That just makes me question everything else that he says.
[01:16:49.114 --> 01:16:50.475]  Let me be clear.
[01:16:50.475 --> 01:16:52.295]  We have Allen on every few months.
[01:16:52.295 --> 01:16:54.456]  I respect him.
[01:16:54.456 --> 01:16:57.618]  The info I've seen put out is super accurate.
[01:16:57.618 --> 01:17:01.800]  I probably don't agree with his religious beliefs or whatever they are.
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:05.341]  From what I've seen, he tends to just stay away from all of that.
[01:17:05.341 --> 01:17:06.462]  But that's his business.
[01:17:06.462 --> 01:17:07.202]  But I want to be clear.
[01:17:07.202 --> 01:17:08.183]  We have guests on.
[01:17:09.335 --> 01:17:09.655]  That's
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.101]  You know, I can't get caught up.
[01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:31.262]  I mean, I don't even have time to watch Glenn Beck, but maybe once every two weeks.
[01:17:31.262 --> 01:17:33.263]  I don't have time to listen to Limbaugh.
[01:17:33.263 --> 01:17:34.223]  I mean, I am working.
[01:17:34.223 --> 01:17:35.163]  I am researching.
[01:17:35.163 --> 01:17:36.404]  I'm making films.
[01:17:36.404 --> 01:17:39.345]  And so I can't really be my brother's keeper.
[01:17:39.345 --> 01:17:42.206]  I mean, so what did he say that you think is so patently false since you brought it up?
[01:17:43.618 --> 01:17:56.942]  Yeah, he said that all of the Beatles songs were written by Theodor Adorno, which was a 60-year-old German philosophy professor.
[01:17:56.942 --> 01:18:07.806]  And he also said that Theodor Adorno owned the rights to the Beatles songs until he died, and then that was when they got sold to Michael Jackson.
[01:18:08.587 --> 01:18:11.868]  And he just gives no source for that.
[01:18:11.868 --> 01:18:12.848]  Well, I mean, hold on, hold on.
[01:18:12.848 --> 01:18:29.752]  He couldn't have written... I didn't hear Alan say this, and it just seems... I mean, next time he's on, I'll ask him about it, but Theodore Adorno died in 1969, and the Beatles kept writing songs right into the 70s, so I don't... I mean, he says they wrote all the songs?
[01:18:29.752 --> 01:18:36.474]  Yeah, he said he wrote them all, and he said that he also owned the rights to them, and that's just...
[01:18:37.159 --> 01:18:46.125]  Provably false and let me tell you where I think he got the idea for that and he did say that it's on the web you can look on YouTube.
[01:19:07.179 --> 01:19:07.439]  I don't
[01:19:25.509 --> 01:19:26.450]  We're good to go.
[01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:26.810]  We're good to go.
[01:19:53.307 --> 01:19:56.311]  If you're better than Alan Watt and me, I say go out and do your own show.
[01:19:56.311 --> 01:19:57.372]  Please!
[01:19:57.372 --> 01:19:59.575]  I know there are people out there more eloquent than I am.
[01:19:59.575 --> 01:20:00.476]  Step up to the plate!
[01:20:01.167 --> 01:20:05.251]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:05.251 --> 01:20:09.755]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:09.755 --> 01:20:15.920]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:18.343]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.343 --> 01:20:24.308]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.428 --> 01:20:27.832]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:27.832 --> 01:20:29.713]  There is no other program of its kind.

[01:21:01.798 --> 01:21:05.799]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:05.799 --> 01:21:09.060]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:13.841]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:13.841 --> 01:21:20.243]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.243 --> 01:21:22.484]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:21:23.024 --> 01:21:23.324]  Tim Geithner?
[01:21:23.324 --> 01:21:23.844]  Bernanke?
[01:21:23.844 --> 01:21:24.504]  They're arsonists!
[01:21:24.504 --> 01:21:25.785]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:25.785 --> 01:21:28.025]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:41.929 --> 01:21:43.771]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:43.771 --> 01:21:49.196]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.

[01:22:52.054 --> 01:22:54.456]  My name is Span and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[01:23:07.614 --> 01:23:12.358]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[01:23:12.358 --> 01:23:14.440]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.162]  Made me feel breathless.
[01:23:16.162 --> 01:23:20.606]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[01:23:20.606 --> 01:23:21.687]  Nothing did anything.

[01:23:29.794 --> 01:23:32.417]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[01:23:32.857 --> 01:23:37.879]  The episodes became less frequent and Biomontech completely vanished.

[01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:07.132]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:24:07.132 --> 01:24:11.035]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:11.035 --> 01:24:18.019]  The Patriot Act in a procedural vote was defeated yesterday, the reauthorization of the un-American police state legislation.
[01:24:18.019 --> 01:24:25.044]  I think they've got the votes to pass it in a full vote or in another procedural move.
[01:24:26.752 --> 01:24:30.454]  But this is a victory, and I was correct.
[01:24:30.454 --> 01:24:31.594]  There are 98 U.S.
[01:24:31.594 --> 01:24:51.503]  Senators that voted in favor of the original USA Patriot Act in October of 2001, and Senator Landrieu of Louisiana did not vote, and she abstained, and Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin was the only Senator who voted against the Patriot Act, and that's a good thing that Russ Feingold did.
[01:24:53.712 --> 01:24:55.512]  There you go.
[01:24:55.512 --> 01:24:57.033]  Look, I'm not mad at the last caller.
[01:24:57.033 --> 01:24:58.453]  It's just I don't have time for this, folks.
[01:24:58.453 --> 01:25:02.694]  That's why other people with radio shows and filmmakers are not successful.
[01:25:02.694 --> 01:25:07.356]  Because all they do is just fight with each other constantly and freak out over everything.
[01:25:07.356 --> 01:25:11.557]  I'm just here to get messages out, information, and you can decide what to do with it.
[01:25:12.097 --> 01:25:13.458]  Okay.
[01:25:13.458 --> 01:25:15.960]  I mean, Calgary's voted out fluoride.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:18.141]  San Diego looks like they may do it.
[01:25:18.141 --> 01:25:19.522]  The Patriot Act's in trouble.
[01:25:19.522 --> 01:25:23.885]  There's big investigations in Europe over the vaccines causing brain damage.
[01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:29.268]  I mean, they're putting in emergency alert takeover systems.
[01:25:29.268 --> 01:25:37.574]  All this stuff is happening and I'm here to talk about it and to get people into the exercise of standing up and getting involved for whatever your views are.
[01:25:37.574 --> 01:25:39.535]  Just stop letting the globalists program you.
[01:25:40.759 --> 01:25:44.122]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in California.
[01:25:44.122 --> 01:25:44.882]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:25:49.651 --> 01:25:56.094]  Okay, we've got to stop industry and stop quibbling between government and economy, because that's what it is.
[01:25:56.094 --> 01:26:03.556]  It's causing climate change, like the Nobel thesis has proved, and that's causing the asteroid and the post-shift.
[01:26:03.556 --> 01:26:08.859]  Ma'am, you call us a lot on the voicemail here, and I just, I don't believe in asteroids coming to get us.
[01:26:08.859 --> 01:26:10.299]  I don't, sometimes this happens.
[01:26:10.299 --> 01:26:14.361]  Sometimes we take calls and it's 100% gold info, and I'm just, I'm just honest.
[01:26:14.361 --> 01:26:17.142]  I don't screen calls, but if I don't like where it's going and somebody calls every day,
[01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:20.383]  I mean, ma'am, have you gotten the message here?
[01:26:20.383 --> 01:26:25.765]  I don't believe that that comment coming between the Earth and the Moon on the 15th of March is going to kill us all.
[01:26:25.765 --> 01:26:27.806]  There's going to be a pole shift, okay?
[01:26:27.806 --> 01:26:31.007]  Okay, and I'm not covering up a pole shift, alright?
[01:26:31.007 --> 01:26:37.710]  And I'll be the discredited one when there's no pole shift on March 15th, the Ides of March.
[01:26:38.650 --> 01:26:43.436]  I'll- everyone who said we were all gonna die will be- yes, they were wrong!
[01:26:43.436 --> 01:26:44.177]  Hail them!
[01:26:44.177 --> 01:26:45.438]  Alex was right!
[01:26:45.438 --> 01:26:46.920]  He's disinfo!
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:47.981]  Okay?
[01:26:47.981 --> 01:26:53.367]  We're gonna all be here unless we die in car wrecks today, or get struck by lightning, or die of cancer, or whatever.
[01:26:54.918 --> 01:26:58.422]  And everybody's calling me saying, talk about poll shifts.
[01:26:58.422 --> 01:27:04.009]  So I went and did research and saw some Fox News hype about it, saying the polls were moving.
[01:27:04.009 --> 01:27:12.880]  And then I actually went to the original recordings by the federal government and private scientific outfits, and it turns out they're moving all the time.
[01:27:15.526 --> 01:27:17.627]  You know, a lot of times I don't take a lot of calls.
[01:27:17.627 --> 01:27:20.689]  I have guests on and cover news because... But you know what?
[01:27:20.689 --> 01:27:24.452]  I think this is all educational to begin with, just to hear it.
[01:27:24.452 --> 01:27:30.196]  And so there, I just censored the lady who calls here 15 times a day, sometimes 100 times a day.
[01:27:30.196 --> 01:27:32.597]  No, I don't believe in man-made climate change.
[01:27:32.597 --> 01:27:39.802]  I mean, what a simple, weird statement to say, we need to get the government and industry to stop fighting.
[01:27:39.802 --> 01:27:41.283]  They're causing climate change.
[01:27:43.174 --> 01:27:46.055]  The Easter Bunny is causing Froot Loops to fall out of the sky.
[01:27:46.055 --> 01:27:48.076]  I mean, that has as much sense.
[01:27:48.076 --> 01:27:50.897]  And then to go on to, that's what's causing the asteroid.
[01:27:50.897 --> 01:27:51.377]  What?
[01:27:51.377 --> 01:27:52.318]  What?
[01:27:52.318 --> 01:27:55.599]  Government and industry not getting together is causing an asteroid?
[01:27:55.599 --> 01:27:57.200]  I'm not gonna listen to it!
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.941]  I'm not gonna listen to it!
[01:27:58.941 --> 01:27:59.621]  Do you understand?
[01:27:59.621 --> 01:28:00.801]  I don't want nonsense!
[01:28:00.801 --> 01:28:03.102]  I'm tired of it!
[01:28:03.102 --> 01:28:06.644]  Man!
[01:28:06.644 --> 01:28:08.525]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Ohio.
[01:28:08.525 --> 01:28:09.245]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:28:10.436 --> 01:28:12.537]  Alex, I promise not to upset you with this one.
[01:28:12.537 --> 01:28:15.778]  As a matter of fact, I have a belated birthday present for you.
[01:28:15.778 --> 01:28:16.599]  Okay, thank you, Tim.
[01:28:16.599 --> 01:28:17.459]  What's on your mind?
[01:28:17.459 --> 01:28:26.202]  The more I listen to Big Sis' clip, the, uh, See Something Say Something, I hear our friend Tony Montana.
[01:28:26.202 --> 01:28:29.024]  And if you've got 45 seconds left, I'll play the clip for you.
[01:28:29.024 --> 01:28:29.864]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:28:29.864 --> 01:28:31.485]  Here it comes.
[01:28:31.485 --> 01:28:35.966]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:28:37.662 --> 01:28:40.965]  Homeland security begins with hometown security.
[01:28:40.965 --> 01:28:46.049]  That's why I'm pleased that Walmart is helping to make our communities more safe and secure.
[01:28:46.049 --> 01:28:48.091]  How do you like it?
[01:28:48.091 --> 01:28:51.814]  They tell you all the time what to do, what to think, what to feel.
[01:28:51.814 --> 01:28:57.339]  If you see something suspicious in the parking lot or in the store, say something immediately.
[01:28:57.339 --> 01:28:59.341]  You want to be like a chief?
[01:28:59.341 --> 01:29:00.282]  Like all those other people, man?
[01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:05.532]  Report suspicious activity to your local police or sheriff.
[01:29:05.532 --> 01:29:10.995]  Do you want a Chiavano in every corner, man, looking after you, watching everything you do, everything you say, man?
[01:29:10.995 --> 01:29:14.538]  Thank you for doing your part to help keep our hometown safe.
[01:29:14.538 --> 01:29:16.078]  How'd you like that?
[01:29:16.078 --> 01:29:17.659]  How'd you like that?
[01:29:17.659 --> 01:29:21.682]  I want my human rights just like the President Jimmy Carter says.
[01:29:21.682 --> 01:29:24.584]  You want a Chiavano in every corner, a rat, a spy?
[01:29:24.584 --> 01:29:26.765]  We know what terror... It's beautiful.
[01:29:26.765 --> 01:29:27.766]  Absolutely beautiful.
[01:29:27.766 --> 01:29:28.866]  Just, you just...
[01:29:30.714 --> 01:29:32.115]  Really made up for the last caller.
[01:29:32.115 --> 01:29:33.396]  You are a sweetheart.
[01:29:33.396 --> 01:29:35.018]  Tim, anything else?
[01:29:35.018 --> 01:29:38.621]  I'm sorry I missed your birthday and keep up the fight.
[01:29:38.621 --> 01:29:40.302]  You didn't miss my birthday.
[01:29:40.302 --> 01:29:41.583]  It's coming up Friday.
[01:29:41.583 --> 01:29:42.724]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:42.724 --> 01:29:43.885]  But I don't celebrate it.
[01:29:43.885 --> 01:29:45.647]  I'm too busy fighting the New World Order.
[01:29:45.647 --> 01:29:51.131]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:51.131 --> 01:29:52.532]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.532 --> 01:29:55.054]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.054 --> 01:29:57.737]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.167 --> 01:30:04.751]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:30:04.751 --> 01:30:06.052]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:30:06.052 --> 01:30:10.457]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:30:10.457 --> 01:30:16.403]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:30:16.403 --> 01:30:18.545]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:30:18.545 --> 01:30:21.228]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:30:21.568 --> 01:30:28.070]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:30.271]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:30:30.271 --> 01:30:35.613]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:30:35.613 --> 01:30:40.894]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:30:40.894 --> 01:30:46.276]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:30:46.276 --> 01:30:49.217]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:30:49.457 --> 01:30:52.462]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:30:52.462 --> 01:30:53.224]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.532 --> 01:31:04.374]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[01:31:04.374 --> 01:31:08.656]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:31:08.656 --> 01:31:13.458]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:31:13.458 --> 01:31:19.281]  We're not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:31:19.281 --> 01:31:26.304]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:31:28.937 --> 01:31:35.205]  We're American and be proud.
[01:31:35.205 --> 01:31:38.970]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:31:55.020 --> 01:32:00.267]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:32:00.267 --> 01:32:04.813]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.813 --> 01:32:09.159]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.159 --> 01:32:09.640]  Number two,
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.882]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.882 --> 01:32:15.623]  It's true.
[01:32:15.623 --> 01:32:21.325]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:21.325 --> 01:32:24.927]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.927 --> 01:32:29.629]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:32.390]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:35.732]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.052 --> 01:32:40.993]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.993 --> 01:32:46.055]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.055 --> 01:32:50.216]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.216 --> 01:32:52.016]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.016 --> 01:32:56.617]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:15.463 --> 01:33:17.687]  You know it's funny, we just had that caller.
[01:33:20.154 --> 01:33:20.634]  Are you a communist?
[01:33:20.634 --> 01:33:21.595]  I'm not a communist!
[01:33:21.595 --> 01:33:22.876]  I want to be an American!
[01:33:22.876 --> 01:33:23.477]  Leave me alone!
[01:33:47.773 --> 01:33:49.894]  It's one of my favorite movies.
[01:33:49.894 --> 01:33:53.694]  I'll tell you, Oliver Stone is just amazing.
[01:33:53.694 --> 01:33:55.955]  He actually did years of research before he made that.
[01:33:55.955 --> 01:33:58.236]  It's a composite of some true stories.
[01:33:58.236 --> 01:34:00.556]  That's a little inside baseball on that.
[01:34:00.556 --> 01:34:04.197]  But that is exactly what it is.
[01:34:04.197 --> 01:34:10.338]  I mean, this is archetypal tyranny right out of 1984 at the shopping markets and at the Walmarts.
[01:34:10.338 --> 01:34:12.379]  It's now 9,000 locations that they're going in.
[01:34:14.164 --> 01:34:20.589]  With big telescreens telling you to be paranoid as if the enemy is in America.
[01:34:20.589 --> 01:34:21.369]  And who's around you?
[01:34:21.369 --> 01:34:24.711]  Other Americans grazing at Walmart.
[01:34:24.711 --> 01:34:27.313]  And then she's at the Super Bowl injecting herself.
[01:34:27.313 --> 01:34:29.235]  And they've got the EAS takeover system.
[01:34:29.235 --> 01:34:32.797]  And they're saying we're going to break in on your online video games with terror alerts.
[01:34:32.797 --> 01:34:37.220]  We're going to break in on your cell phone with terror alerts.
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:43.225]  We're going to start not just having EAS test every few days on radio, but there's going to be Obama announcements.
[01:34:44.028 --> 01:34:47.110]  And then I was on ManCow today and he said, well, for a nuclear attack?
[01:34:47.110 --> 01:34:48.852]  And I said, no!
[01:34:48.852 --> 01:34:51.914]  No, the system was in place in the 50s for that.
[01:34:51.914 --> 01:34:53.155]  And it was voluntary.
[01:34:53.155 --> 01:34:55.197]  Now it's mandatory.
[01:34:55.197 --> 01:35:00.561]  And the stations have to spend all this money paying for it that's passed on to you, the consumer.
[01:35:00.561 --> 01:35:03.063]  And now they're saying they're going to start breaking in with messages.
[01:35:03.063 --> 01:35:11.470]  They've announced they're going to try to phase in digital license plates that you get with your tags that you have to plug in to the, you know, uh, tail light, uh,
[01:35:11.770 --> 01:35:18.272]  You're there with your kids at Walmart, you try to keep them away from TV, you try to keep them away from brainwashing, and there's a big brother woman up on the TV
[01:35:41.482 --> 01:35:47.586]  Now you're about to see the ultimate illustration of what bad journalism is.
[01:35:47.586 --> 01:35:49.046]  I'm going to analyze this.
[01:35:49.046 --> 01:35:57.091]  I'm going to play the clip and stop it and start it and break it down here for you right now.
[01:35:57.091 --> 01:36:01.033]  This, this is unbelievable.
[01:36:01.033 --> 01:36:10.059]  But when you talk about Tony Montana, what's funny is I constantly, when I think of the police state, think about him saying, you want a Chavano on every corner?
[01:36:10.959 --> 01:36:11.359]  I think so.
[01:36:40.091 --> 01:36:40.191]  Are
[01:37:00.051 --> 01:37:04.235]  I'm spending probably an hour every day trying to watch them all.
[01:37:04.235 --> 01:37:07.077]  Phil is spending, what, three hours a day?
[01:37:07.077 --> 01:37:15.424]  Phil in there is the point man on all the flyers that come in, all the videos of people posting the V for Victory symbol.
[01:37:15.424 --> 01:37:16.805]  It's incredible.
[01:37:16.805 --> 01:37:21.109]  And of course, the V for Victory originally comes from the 12 and 1300s.
[01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:23.571]  The British longbowman, the Welsh longbowman,
[01:37:24.827 --> 01:37:36.016]  When the Norman and others would invade, the Anglo-Saxons had longbows that were, you know, before guns were invented, but extremely powerful.
[01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:42.621]  And they could shoot people at, you know, 300 yards away, and with incredible accuracy, they'd shoot right through armor.
[01:37:42.621 --> 01:37:49.967]  And so, whenever they would capture the Anglo-Saxon troops, mainly Welsh bowmen,
[01:37:52.156 --> 01:37:53.797]  That's where my folks on the English side are from.
[01:37:53.797 --> 01:37:56.499]  I'm no Jones, I'm part Welsh.
[01:37:56.499 --> 01:37:58.641]  They were the best bowmen in Europe.
[01:37:58.641 --> 01:38:02.704]  And their bows were seen as the most well-designed, the most powerful.
[01:38:02.704 --> 01:38:03.545]  They were feared.
[01:38:03.545 --> 01:38:08.269]  And so when they would capture them, they would cut off their index and their middle finger.
[01:38:08.269 --> 01:38:09.390]  Slice them off.
[01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:12.392]  And so for hundreds of years with groups fighting,
[01:38:14.389 --> 01:38:20.191]  That became a kind of a military insult, or a come and get it, come and take it thing.
[01:38:20.191 --> 01:38:24.213]  Come and take it, here's my fingers, I got them, and I'm gonna use them.
[01:38:24.213 --> 01:38:39.638]  And then that's why the British, because I actually did the research on it after we launched it, I thought it originated with the French Resistance, and saying, you know, V for victory, so there were just posters put up at night, and the Nazis would get mad because, you know, there's a V saying resist the occupation.
[01:38:39.638 --> 01:38:43.280]  With our V, it's got Infowars.com under it, the original poster we put out,
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:50.524]  Well, it's gotta be thousands of variants you've put out, many of them better than what we hastily put together, and I thought it was excellent, you know, what we put together.
[01:38:50.524 --> 01:38:56.508]  We did like in 30 minutes one night, when Watson had the idea, I said, we're launching the Answer to 1984, the 1776 contest.
[01:38:56.508 --> 01:39:02.091]  It's a $10,000 contest, $7,000 for first place, $2,000 for second, $1,000 for third place, and the announcement's coming up.
[01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:10.992]  In fact, when do we launch the contest?
[01:39:10.992 --> 01:39:12.334]  I've got to look at contest rules.
[01:39:12.334 --> 01:39:15.398]  I guess in a few weeks, that contest closes.
[01:39:15.398 --> 01:39:25.333]  And I called Watson so upset about all the police state developments one night at about 5 o'clock here, about 10 o'clock his time in England, and I said, we've got to do something, Watson.
[01:39:26.744 --> 01:39:31.266]  I said, man, I sure hope people, you know, make videos of their activism.
[01:39:31.266 --> 01:39:35.568]  The answer to 1984 or 1776 is a contest wide open.
[01:39:35.568 --> 01:39:52.897]  Whatever you want to do, whether it's a fiction piece you do, or a protest at an airport, or hanging banners up, it's about getting in the streets, about letting others know that there's a national solidarity against the tyranny, that it's not all just left-right paradigm, that we the people can come together for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:39:54.147 --> 01:39:57.911]  And Watson said, I said, we need some kind of symbol though.
[01:39:57.911 --> 01:40:01.094]  People like symbols, but he goes, why not the V for victory?
[01:40:01.094 --> 01:40:04.618]  He said, I was just reading a history book about the French resistance.
[01:40:04.618 --> 01:40:10.203]  It was his parents had moved to France and he was over there visiting him at Christmas.
[01:40:10.203 --> 01:40:11.024]  And I said, that's it.
[01:40:11.024 --> 01:40:11.304]  Boom.
[01:40:11.304 --> 01:40:11.885]  I went to Phil.
[01:40:11.885 --> 01:40:13.446]  I said, Phil, you ready to stay here another hour?
[01:40:13.446 --> 01:40:14.547]  And he said, absolutely.
[01:40:14.547 --> 01:40:15.248]  I said, let's make a V.
[01:40:16.289 --> 01:40:35.303]  And so we launched it, wrote the little, uh, in fact, will you guys print me one off the little message at the bottom about the New World Order's taking over, the banks are looting us, there's a police state, our constitution's under attack, this symbol will get your town talking, it'll get people visiting the site, learning what's happening, and so people understand that there is a underground resistance.
[01:40:35.303 --> 01:40:39.286]  Because media and the system is very, very scared of this.
[01:40:39.286 --> 01:40:40.828]  Because it's been used all over the world.
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:49.106]  And they normally respond, like with the Obama Joker poster, with threatening people with arrest, even if it's hung in legal areas.
[01:40:49.106 --> 01:40:51.247]  How dare you show Obama as the Joker?
[01:40:51.247 --> 01:40:54.770]  That defiles our dear, great leader, Durfur.
[01:40:54.770 --> 01:40:57.973]  And we're here to make fun of Durfur.
[01:40:57.973 --> 01:41:06.479]  We're here to pull down that godlike big brother system that they sell us so that people realize we have strength and they're just men like us.
[01:41:06.479 --> 01:41:09.161]  They put their pants on one leg at a time.
[01:41:09.161 --> 01:41:10.382]  They brush their teeth every morning.
[01:41:11.562 --> 01:41:13.323]  We can defeat them.
[01:41:13.323 --> 01:41:16.405]  And Watson said, Alex, why don't you do a V?
[01:41:16.405 --> 01:41:25.632]  And so we did about an hour of research, found a simple V symbol that you see right behind me if you're watching on TV, and we launched it.
[01:41:25.632 --> 01:41:40.282]  Now, it's been the most successful, from what we can gather, of videos produced, numbers of people posting the V, of buzz, of some newspapers covering it, of massive emails I'm getting, of just incredible response on the web.
[01:41:40.282 --> 01:41:40.482]  But,
[01:41:41.463 --> 01:41:45.167]  With the Obama Joker, the media did exactly what we wanted.
[01:41:45.167 --> 01:41:50.112]  They started threatening people and threatening to arrest whoever was posting these, even in legal areas.
[01:41:50.112 --> 01:41:56.858]  And then the police refused to press charges on one guy because they pointed out, well, they can hang up a dog grooming sign.
[01:41:56.858 --> 01:42:01.823]  That's why I keep using that example the police said, and they can hang up a sign about a
[01:42:05.066 --> 01:42:08.749]  Swap meat or a bake sale or a garage sale.
[01:42:08.749 --> 01:42:11.410]  And the cops said, you know, First Amendment.
[01:42:11.410 --> 01:42:15.233]  Because in some towns there wasn't an ordinance against putting them up on power poles.
[01:42:15.233 --> 01:42:16.934]  And they were like, we're looking for them.
[01:42:16.934 --> 01:42:18.115]  We want to arrest them.
[01:42:18.115 --> 01:42:20.917]  Papers in Texas and TV, you know, was saying this.
[01:42:20.917 --> 01:42:24.419]  And in Florida, they're like, we're going to arrest whoever did this.
[01:42:24.419 --> 01:42:29.182]  And then a bunch of people saw it on the news and they ran out and put them up everywhere.
[01:42:29.182 --> 01:42:30.803]  And the cops were like, we're going to find him.
[01:42:30.803 --> 01:42:31.624]  And then later they said, well,
[01:42:32.484 --> 01:42:34.485]  You know, people made fun of George Bush.
[01:42:34.485 --> 01:42:36.026]  They put him up as the Joker.
[01:42:36.026 --> 01:42:37.247]  Why can't you do this?
[01:42:37.247 --> 01:42:51.195]  And the cops said, in multiple locales, up by Dallas in a town, they said, you know, in the news, and we played those clips here, they said, look, do you want us to go arrest people that put up a garage sale sign on a power pole?
[01:42:51.195 --> 01:42:54.477]  Because this can really, really be a problem here.
[01:42:54.477 --> 01:42:58.319]  We don't want to selectively enforce this, even in towns where they have the ordinance.
[01:42:58.319 --> 01:42:59.280]  Now, we have said,
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:03.181]  We also had the flyer operation with the flu.
[01:43:03.181 --> 01:43:06.941]  That was in scores of newspapers and TV channels.
[01:43:06.941 --> 01:43:13.463]  I had them calling me every day going, are you the one putting up these signs saying the flu shot can kill you or cause Guillain-Barré?
[01:43:13.463 --> 01:43:16.644]  Remember, this is back in 2009.
[01:43:16.644 --> 01:43:19.084]  Before it came out and is admitted it did do this.
[01:43:19.084 --> 01:43:20.304]  See, we were proven right.
[01:43:20.304 --> 01:43:25.445]  And they had newscasts about how evil we were, but then that educated people.
[01:43:25.445 --> 01:43:27.486]  So, all of that is happening.
[01:43:27.486 --> 01:43:27.646]  Now,
[01:43:29.212 --> 01:43:34.146]  The only thing that we haven't had happen is TV coverage and TV demonization.
[01:43:36.727 --> 01:43:39.048]  And that's what we're really looking for.
[01:43:39.048 --> 01:43:51.912]  It's not enough to just, and it's fine, it's the first step in the right direction to make flyers, post them on the web, on Facebook, on Myspace, on YouTube, to make your own YouTube video about the V for Victory campaign to get others.
[01:43:51.912 --> 01:43:54.353]  That's all great, but that's the first step.
[01:43:54.353 --> 01:44:00.195]  The real step is like the guy at the Super Bowl who hung up hundreds of them all around the Super Bowl.
[01:44:00.195 --> 01:44:02.356]  I talked to people that went to the Super Bowl who saw them.
[01:44:03.817 --> 01:44:08.982]  And we got reports that people saw his video that got thousands and thousands of views.
[01:44:08.982 --> 01:44:13.425]  The one problem here is we post probably 10, 15 new videos a day.
[01:44:13.425 --> 01:44:17.169]  And if we just posted one, it would get 10, 20, 30,000 views.
[01:44:17.169 --> 01:44:20.872]  Because we're posting five, 10, 15 videos, only get two or 3,000 views a piece.
[01:44:20.872 --> 01:44:21.893]  But that's still great.
[01:44:21.893 --> 01:44:26.056]  Politicians fly all over the country, powerful ones, just to speak to 1,000 people.
[01:44:26.056 --> 01:44:28.899]  You're putting up a YouTube video and reaching 3,000 people.
[01:44:28.899 --> 01:44:30.300]  But all the people around the Super Bowl,
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:36.544]  Then we got reports others saw that video and went down and put even more up, not just the one guy and his friends.
[01:44:36.544 --> 01:44:40.347]  So again, I salute you for causing that chain reaction.
[01:44:40.347 --> 01:44:42.529]  That's how liberty can defeat these people.
[01:44:42.529 --> 01:44:45.331]  And yeah, I'm risking my life being at the tip of the spear of this, but...
[01:44:45.951 --> 01:44:49.533]  I'm not going to fight for freedom at 10% or 20% or 90%.
[01:44:49.533 --> 01:44:50.754]  I'm going to go 110%.
[01:44:50.754 --> 01:44:54.776]  I'm going to go beyond what I believe I can do.
[01:44:54.776 --> 01:44:56.337]  Does it mean I'm perfect?
[01:44:56.337 --> 01:44:56.817]  No!
[01:44:56.817 --> 01:44:58.959]  But my heart's right and I'm going in the right direction.
[01:44:58.959 --> 01:45:00.520]  And we resonate together.
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:01.340]  We understand that.
[01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:05.182]  We are kindreds, soulmates when it comes to that.
[01:45:05.182 --> 01:45:09.685]  We're part of a brotherhood, a sisterhood of liberty and freedom that is literally eternal.
[01:45:09.685 --> 01:45:10.705]  And I salute all of you.
[01:45:10.705 --> 01:45:11.186]  I love you.
[01:45:12.347 --> 01:45:15.510]  I wanted to take time out today to just thank you, all of you.
[01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:18.172]  It's just been so wonderful what we've done.
[01:45:20.731 --> 01:45:26.555]  This newscast is the most deceptive piece of embarrassing trash that I've ever seen.
[01:45:26.555 --> 01:45:31.118]  I mean, this is worse than local news saying Mercury's good for babies' brains.
[01:45:31.118 --> 01:45:33.980]  This is worse than MSNBC saying lead toys are good for kids.
[01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:36.822]  And if you never saw those clips, just search them and they'll come up.
[01:45:36.822 --> 01:45:37.562]  I'm not going to play them again.
[01:45:37.562 --> 01:45:40.124]  I've played them more than 100 times.
[01:45:40.124 --> 01:45:42.626]  Old-time listeners go, yeah, please don't play it again.
[01:45:42.626 --> 01:45:43.026]  We know.
[01:45:43.026 --> 01:45:44.787]  But new listeners won't believe it.
[01:45:44.787 --> 01:45:45.288]  Just search it.
[01:45:46.605 --> 01:45:47.646]  Mercury good for children.
[01:45:47.646 --> 01:45:49.667]  Newscast Mercury good for children.
[01:45:49.667 --> 01:45:52.548]  MSNBC says lead toys good for kids.
[01:45:52.548 --> 01:45:53.188]  It'll come up.
[01:45:53.188 --> 01:46:02.313]  But this is the most arrogant, humorous-filled, deceptive thing.
[01:46:02.313 --> 01:46:03.474]  It's a minute and a half long.
[01:46:03.474 --> 01:46:07.095]  ABC News out of DC.
[01:46:07.095 --> 01:46:11.858]  A, they say we're leftist when we're all about getting outside the left-right paradigm.
[01:46:13.323 --> 01:46:18.106]  And the ADL says we're hardcore right-wingers, but they're saying we're leftist.
[01:46:18.106 --> 01:46:20.007]  Whatever label they want.
[01:46:20.007 --> 01:46:25.129]  And then they go on and make fun of us and claim we've got stuff about stormtroopers on the websites.
[01:46:25.129 --> 01:46:33.834]  No, we've got the history of the French resistance going up against the Nazis with the V. So they spin that like we say Nazi stormtroopers are invading.
[01:46:34.810 --> 01:46:41.960]  Well, I've got to play it and stop it, because literally every 10 seconds is a deception, and the reporter waves it off.
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:43.503]  He's just laughing at it.
[01:46:43.503 --> 01:46:47.649]  And they're like, it's so reasonable that they're putting telescreens in.
[01:46:47.649 --> 01:46:50.272]  They're not saying don't trust your neighbor and spy on people.
[01:46:50.272 --> 01:46:50.713]  Yeah, they are.
[01:46:51.434 --> 01:47:00.921]  They're introducing this idea they're terrorists everywhere and watch everyone and people are at Walmarts repeatedly seeing a guy on a cell phone and calling the police saying it's a gun.
[01:47:00.921 --> 01:47:07.285]  People are being shot and killed watering their yard because they got a metal sprayer on the end in San Francisco.
[01:47:07.285 --> 01:47:09.546]  I mean it's just la la.
[01:47:09.546 --> 01:47:14.490]  Every day they're shutting down highways because a cardboard box blows out of the back of a truck.
[01:47:17.031 --> 01:47:19.192]  And people are, ooh, a cardboard box!
[01:47:19.192 --> 01:47:26.495]  I mean, it's just all about this culture of limbing fear mongers, and then they train you to report on al-Qaeda, and next it's report illegal guns.
[01:47:26.495 --> 01:47:28.496]  We have the Internal Homeland Security reports.
[01:47:28.496 --> 01:47:30.576]  It's all about the American people.
[01:47:30.576 --> 01:47:32.357]  Just like the TSA is.
[01:47:32.357 --> 01:47:34.538]  But they make this big joke about it.
[01:47:34.958 --> 01:47:40.200]  You got the EAS takeover system of radio and TV, the internet kill switch, but none of that's in context.
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:50.863]  It's just... And notice, just like the White House didn't... They said, well, there was this unreputable source last week that said we might be causing the blackouts, and that's ridiculous, but they didn't say who the source was.
[01:47:50.863 --> 01:47:51.864]  It's us.
[01:47:51.864 --> 01:47:53.744]  Just like the V campaign is us.
[01:47:53.744 --> 01:47:55.865]  They don't even let you have the source.
[01:47:55.865 --> 01:47:59.066]  They don't even have the respect for you to do that.
[01:48:00.933 --> 01:48:01.833]  And I don't want to be interrupted.
[01:48:01.833 --> 01:48:02.574]  This is too important.
[01:48:02.574 --> 01:48:03.694]  I'm skipping this network break.
[01:48:03.694 --> 01:48:07.857]  Stations should carry this because it's a network break.
[01:48:07.857 --> 01:48:12.099]  So, let's start playing this clip out of D.C.
[01:48:12.099 --> 01:48:15.781]  where they don't show you the website, where they don't show you where the V campaign came from.
[01:48:15.781 --> 01:48:18.002]  They lie and say we're leftist.
[01:48:18.002 --> 01:48:23.045]  It is, and they tell you how good it is and reasonable to, you know, see something, say something.
[01:48:23.045 --> 01:48:30.189]  As if we don't know, you know, we see a guy with a gun in the parking lot or we see somebody stealing something, like we don't need to say something.
[01:48:31.095 --> 01:48:37.683]  Again, it's this condescending and getting us used to the government forcing its way into our face every day, bombarding us with propaganda.
[01:48:37.683 --> 01:48:39.605]  This is 1984.
[01:48:39.605 --> 01:48:42.549]  Even the Washington Post says this is 1984-ish.
[01:48:42.549 --> 01:48:44.090]  But they say, oh, we're just kooks.
[01:48:44.090 --> 01:48:45.212]  Look at these nuts.
[01:48:45.212 --> 01:48:48.736]  They say telescreens telling you to spy on people is weird.
[01:48:48.736 --> 01:48:50.157]  It's not spying.
[01:48:50.157 --> 01:48:51.119]  Let's start going to the clip.
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:56.804]  Today about a homeland security campaign called, if you see something, say something.
[01:48:56.804 --> 01:48:58.845]  Critics call it Big Brother is watching.
[01:48:58.845 --> 01:49:03.189]  13 News reporter Dave Cassidy is live on Capitol Hill for us this morning with more info.
[01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:08.173]  And Dave, the government says it's not asking Americans to spy on each other.
[01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:14.505]  That's right, but some groups on the left, Sal and Vanessa, really don't like this one.
[01:49:14.505 --> 01:49:16.627]  They say... Okay, stop right there.
[01:49:16.627 --> 01:49:18.309]  Backing up a few seconds.
[01:49:18.309 --> 01:49:19.410]  Groups on the left.
[01:49:19.410 --> 01:49:27.317]  Now, not only is that obviously a lie, what everything we're about is not being left or right, but the mainline media mainly is saying we're right-wings, we don't like Obama.
[01:49:27.317 --> 01:49:28.378]  So they know that's not true.
[01:49:28.999 --> 01:49:33.744]  And he's reading off my website, he's reading from it, but they're not letting you know the source.
[01:49:33.744 --> 01:49:36.067]  That's the telltale sign of deception.
[01:49:36.067 --> 01:49:41.632]  Just like the White House said, there's people saying we caused the blackouts, they're liars, but they don't let you read what was actually said.
[01:49:42.702 --> 01:49:43.322]  Same thing there.
[01:49:43.322 --> 01:49:44.443]  So two lies there.
[01:49:44.443 --> 01:49:48.604]  We're not leftist, and they don't let you know the source.
[01:49:48.604 --> 01:49:52.206]  They don't let you know the source so you can decide for yourself.
[01:49:52.206 --> 01:49:52.966]  Continue.
[01:49:52.966 --> 01:49:59.128]  A V for victory program because they don't want America to become a police state.
[01:49:59.128 --> 01:50:05.091]  The National Football League signed on to see something say something just in time for last Sunday's Super Bowl.
[01:50:05.091 --> 01:50:05.571]  Okay, pause.
[01:50:06.531 --> 01:50:12.373]  Again, let's just start it over at the beginning, because I've been interrupting, and I'll continue to interrupt, but I want to just start from the beginning here in a moment.
[01:50:12.373 --> 01:50:17.675]  But, yeah, they didn't just sign on to see something, say something, oh, that's so reasonable, as he's about to say.
[01:50:17.675 --> 01:50:26.137]  No, they had TSA running the checkpoints and running the private security and police security, and the National Guard was there groping people doing pat-downs.
[01:50:26.137 --> 01:50:29.779]  Source, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, dhs.gov.
[01:50:29.779 --> 01:50:30.419]  Covered that Sunday.
[01:50:31.496 --> 01:50:32.936]  There you go again.
[01:50:32.936 --> 01:50:36.537]  See, limiting what is actually being rolled out.
[01:50:36.537 --> 01:50:38.938]  Not telling you airport-style securities there.
[01:50:38.938 --> 01:50:41.659]  There's giant jumbo screens bombarding you with propaganda.
[01:50:41.659 --> 01:50:45.340]  No, just, oh, they just wanted some security instead of you see something, say something.
[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:48.561]  It's so reasonable to have telescreens at Walmart.
[01:50:48.561 --> 01:50:48.981]  Continue.
[01:50:52.102 --> 01:50:52.663]  I'm with the peace.
[01:51:11.047 --> 01:51:16.090]  That's right, but some groups on the left, LaSalle and Vanessa, really don't like this one.
[01:51:16.090 --> 01:51:19.991]  They say they're starting their own V for Victory program.
[01:51:19.991 --> 01:51:20.472]  Stop there!
[01:51:20.472 --> 01:51:24.013]  Okay, I apologize.
[01:51:24.013 --> 01:51:26.495]  I said there were only three lies in the first 20 seconds.
[01:51:26.495 --> 01:51:27.315]  There was another lie.
[01:51:27.315 --> 01:51:33.118]  She says, she repeats it, the Homeland Security says they are not asking you to spy.
[01:51:34.994 --> 01:51:36.614]  But they are asking you to spy.
[01:51:36.614 --> 01:51:37.335]  That's what it is.
[01:51:37.335 --> 01:51:42.316]  Spying is being a little creep who creeps around and lets everybody know we're watching.
[01:51:42.316 --> 01:51:45.517]  The government's letting you know we're watching and we're getting other citizens to watch.
[01:51:45.517 --> 01:51:46.577]  You're being watched.
[01:51:46.577 --> 01:51:47.258]  Chilling effect.
[01:51:47.258 --> 01:51:49.018]  You better shut up.
[01:51:49.018 --> 01:51:58.241]  And we've got the public reports by Homeland Security where they say, is somebody talking about politically controversial things?
[01:51:58.241 --> 01:51:58.781]  That's a quote.
[01:51:59.884 --> 01:52:03.688]  So they're saying, we're watching you politically, but she says this is not spying.
[01:52:03.688 --> 01:52:05.049]  They are not doing it.
[01:52:05.049 --> 01:52:06.071]  Please continue.
[01:52:06.071 --> 01:52:19.504]  Police state the National Football League signed on to see something say something just in time for last Sunday's Super Bowl asking fans there to keep their eyes open and tell somebody if they saw something threatening.
[01:52:19.504 --> 01:52:20.125]  Stop right there.
[01:52:22.567 --> 01:52:26.809]  The psychology here is always showing cheering.
[01:52:26.809 --> 01:52:30.471]  Like, oh, they asked him to join in spying and then, oh, they cut to the happy party.
[01:52:30.471 --> 01:52:38.936]  You ever notice when you're watching a basketball game or football game, when there's a great play or a basket three-pointer made, and right before the buzzer, they just cut to troops.
[01:52:39.835 --> 01:52:40.675]  Always.
[01:52:40.675 --> 01:52:44.037]  And that's a Pavlovian thing where they ding the bell, then give the dog food.
[01:52:44.037 --> 01:52:47.578]  Pretty soon they ding the bell, the dog salivates even when there's no food.
[01:52:47.578 --> 01:52:49.719]  It's like, you like that basket?
[01:52:49.719 --> 01:52:51.079]  You like that excitement?
[01:52:51.079 --> 01:52:52.119]  Military!
[01:52:52.119 --> 01:52:53.080]  Military!
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:54.000]  It saves you!
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.300]  It's good!
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:56.041]  It's wonderful!
[01:52:56.041 --> 01:52:57.621]  Right out of North Korea.
[01:52:57.621 --> 01:52:58.242]  Right out of 1984 fiction.
[01:52:59.642 --> 01:53:01.704]  Where everything good is associated with the state.
[01:53:01.704 --> 01:53:03.625]  We're not saying military themselves are bad.
[01:53:03.625 --> 01:53:13.573]  The point is, you know the telltale of a wicked society is government worship, military worship, billboards of the military everywhere, Big Brother's face everywhere.
[01:53:13.573 --> 01:53:19.198]  Again, it's selling young people to go join the military by seeing it.
[01:53:19.198 --> 01:53:24.502]  And it's bombarding you with military pageantry, which they have in China, Nazi Germany had it.
[01:53:24.502 --> 01:53:25.403]  They all have it.
[01:53:25.403 --> 01:53:27.225]  These are the trappings of corruption.
[01:53:28.123 --> 01:53:31.865]  So just every millisecond, this was a weaponized newscast.
[01:53:31.865 --> 01:53:34.126]  Every bit of this was crafted purely.
[01:53:34.126 --> 01:53:41.850]  And the body language, the laughing and the giggling, and if you want to believe that, and he waves his hand, let's continue, it's coming up.
[01:53:41.850 --> 01:53:49.254]  More than 800 stores playing video messages at checkout counters, urging shoppers to report any suspicious activity.
[01:53:49.254 --> 01:53:55.777]  The government says homeland security begins with hometown security, and each of us can play a part.
[01:53:55.777 --> 01:53:56.578]  All right, hit pause again.
[01:53:58.446 --> 01:53:58.666]  I don't
[01:54:15.353 --> 01:54:16.394]  Well, I forgot that lie.
[01:54:16.394 --> 01:54:17.556]  Back it up 15 seconds.
[01:54:17.556 --> 01:54:18.417]  It's just all lies.
[01:54:18.417 --> 01:54:21.120]  And I do this sometimes because I want to show you the lies.
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.902]  It's just everything is a lie.
[01:54:22.902 --> 01:54:24.544]  Everything is a deception.
[01:54:24.544 --> 01:54:32.894]  Back that video up for me, please, because I want to... We're playing it off the ABC player, so that's why it's kind of skippy a little bit, but here it is again.
[01:54:33.953 --> 01:54:38.215]  We see an unattended bag, for instance, in a public place.
[01:54:38.215 --> 01:54:44.097]  But critics say this really amounts to a Big Brother campaign of spying on people.
[01:54:44.097 --> 01:54:52.080]  And the critics' websites are full of references to Nazi stormtroopers and government slavemasters.
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:52.440]  Back to you.
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:54.861]  Yeah, those harm strong words there.
[01:54:54.861 --> 01:54:56.422]  Dave, this campaign started after 9-11, right?
[01:54:58.504 --> 01:55:01.166]  Right, it was kind of a common-sense response in New York.
[01:55:01.166 --> 01:55:02.987]  Alright, pause again.
[01:55:02.987 --> 01:55:09.491]  This campaign of telescreens and being frisk at the Super Bowl and to get on planes having their hands down your pants.
[01:55:09.491 --> 01:55:11.113]  She's like, well this started on 9-11.
[01:55:11.113 --> 01:55:12.814]  See something, say something.
[01:55:12.814 --> 01:55:14.835]  See, they're using symbolism.
[01:55:14.835 --> 01:55:16.416]  They're saying, see something, say something.
[01:55:16.416 --> 01:55:18.077]  That sounds reasonable.
[01:55:18.077 --> 01:55:19.998]  And then to that archetypal
[01:55:21.204 --> 01:55:23.345]  Semantical symbol.
[01:55:23.345 --> 01:55:34.091]  They attach total tyranny, troops at checkpoints, DHS at checkpoints, hands down pants, telescreen, spy on your neighbors, spy on political activity.
[01:55:34.091 --> 01:55:36.833]  And they're like, look, they just started it after 9-11.
[01:55:36.833 --> 01:55:40.015]  It's just if you see something, say something.
[01:55:40.015 --> 01:55:41.756]  It's completely reasonable.
[01:55:43.545 --> 01:55:44.406]  Let's go ahead and finish the clip.
[01:55:57.156 --> 01:56:01.898]  To many people it will just seem like common sense, but to others it looks like something more sinister.
[01:56:01.898 --> 01:56:03.079]  LaSalle, Vanessa?
[01:56:03.079 --> 01:56:05.160]  See something, say something.
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:05.860]  We're watching.
[01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:07.001]  Thanks, Dave.
[01:56:07.001 --> 01:56:08.021]  Oh, see?
[01:56:08.021 --> 01:56:08.801]  See?
[01:56:08.801 --> 01:56:09.962]  That was all teleprompter.
[01:56:09.962 --> 01:56:11.503]  See something, say something.
[01:56:11.503 --> 01:56:13.644]  We're watching you.
[01:56:13.644 --> 01:56:15.605]  Big Brother is watching.
[01:56:15.605 --> 01:56:24.529]  In 1984, because it was based off Stalin and Hitler, Orwell said it was an amalgamation of those societies, of big posters everywhere.
[01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:29.922]  With Big Brother pointing, saying Big Brother is watching.
[01:56:29.922 --> 01:56:30.503]  And you heard her.
[01:56:30.503 --> 01:56:33.104]  She feels like she's part of the power structure.
[01:56:33.104 --> 01:56:36.286]  Just like that San Francisco rental car lady.
[01:56:36.286 --> 01:56:39.568]  I watched her with about 10 people in front of me renting cars.
[01:56:39.568 --> 01:56:40.728]  Our plane was an hour and a half late.
[01:56:40.728 --> 01:56:41.949]  It was like midnight.
[01:56:41.949 --> 01:56:43.670]  I'm just wanting to get in my car.
[01:56:43.670 --> 01:56:46.791]  I've got to drive, you know, to a nearby city.
[01:56:46.791 --> 01:56:48.752]  It was actually two hours away.
[01:56:48.752 --> 01:56:50.914]  I just want to get some sleep.
[01:56:50.914 --> 01:56:53.735]  You know, it's midnight California time, to my time.
[01:56:53.735 --> 01:56:55.156]  And she's there just interrogating.
[01:56:55.356 --> 01:56:56.057]  Where are you going?
[01:56:56.057 --> 01:56:57.658]  Oh, your mom, how's she doing?
[01:56:57.658 --> 01:56:58.579]  Got anything with you?
[01:56:58.579 --> 01:56:59.520]  What's going on?
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:04.205]  And I got up there and I said, look, I know this is Homeland Security, Patriot Act compliant stuff.
[01:57:04.205 --> 01:57:05.706]  I don't want to answer your questions.
[01:57:05.706 --> 01:57:09.570]  And she was, you know, this young blonde on a power trip, like she's 007.
[01:57:09.570 --> 01:57:10.751]  She goes, really?
[01:57:10.751 --> 01:57:11.852]  You don't?
[01:57:11.852 --> 01:57:15.315]  And I said, OK, I'll tell you, I'm doing national TV show.
[01:57:16.223 --> 01:57:18.043]  And then she kind of didn't like that one.
[01:57:18.043 --> 01:57:23.785]  And then looked and said, oh, I've got your real address, not the one you think people have.
[01:57:23.785 --> 01:57:25.365]  And then double charged me.
[01:57:25.365 --> 01:57:26.165]  She showed me.
[01:57:26.165 --> 01:57:30.986]  It's all about these little people grasping for power, wanting the power.
[01:57:30.986 --> 01:57:34.207]  And that's like that woman at the end of the clip.
[01:57:34.207 --> 01:57:37.328]  She says, oh, she says it real sexy.
[01:57:37.328 --> 01:57:38.988]  Oh, see something, say something.
[01:57:38.988 --> 01:57:41.149]  And she adds, we're watching.
[01:57:42.558 --> 01:57:44.579]  We're watching you.
[01:57:44.579 --> 01:57:46.240]  And oh, the government making you buy health care?
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:48.181]  That's not indentured servitude slavery.
[01:57:48.181 --> 01:57:54.363]  The government will come to your house with guns if you don't pay your property taxes, and if you don't leave your house, they will come with guns and steal it.
[01:57:54.363 --> 01:57:56.884]  And if you resist, they'll kill you.
[01:57:56.884 --> 01:58:02.687]  I mean, indentured serfs paid about 20% of their earnings in feudal Europe.
[01:58:02.687 --> 01:58:05.448]  The average American pays around 60% in some form of taxes.
[01:58:06.667 --> 01:58:11.368]  I don't know, I pay 40% more than slaves in Europe did.
[01:58:11.368 --> 01:58:13.349]  There's a total control grid going into place.
[01:58:13.349 --> 01:58:17.330]  Look, V for victory, good victory for whoever's in D.C.
[01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:23.032]  I've seen videos of people posting them, people posting them right outside the White House, right outside Capitol Hill.
[01:58:23.032 --> 01:58:23.672]  Keep doing it.
[01:58:24.574 --> 01:58:26.675]  I've never seen such a police state as D.C.
[01:58:26.675 --> 01:58:29.397]  You can be anywhere and cops walk over.
[01:58:29.397 --> 01:58:31.918]  You don't videotape around here, Mac.
[01:58:31.918 --> 01:58:33.279]  This ain't America no more.
[01:58:33.279 --> 01:58:36.861]  In fact, we have a clip where the cops say, this isn't America anymore.
[01:58:36.861 --> 01:58:37.982]  Same thing in Canada.
[01:58:37.982 --> 01:58:42.604]  You're not in Canada anymore, boy!
[01:58:42.604 --> 01:58:46.086]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.086 --> 01:58:47.307]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.854 --> 01:59:07.331]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:59:07.331 --> 01:59:11.015]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:56.321]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.321 --> 01:59:59.062]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:09.843]  I'm kind of dreading it, but I'm going to do it.
[02:00:09.843 --> 02:00:13.546]  Starting at the bottom of the hour,
[02:00:35.996 --> 02:00:37.117]  I'm going to call the White House.
[02:00:37.117 --> 02:00:38.078]  I'm going to call Congress.
[02:00:38.078 --> 02:00:40.139]  I'm going to call Homeland Security.
[02:00:40.139 --> 02:00:50.086]  And I'm going to report that one of the phone numbers, some of the phone numbers they're giving out for the See Something Say Something campaign don't even get picked up when we've called them live on air.
[02:00:50.086 --> 02:00:55.890]  Just like they had a stand down on Thanksgiving for a few days after Thanksgiving because they knew there were protests coming.
[02:00:55.890 --> 02:01:04.256]  They just turned them off and even stopped the frisking so people couldn't refuse and stand up and have a type of strike victory against tyranny.
[02:01:05.137 --> 02:01:10.020]  But that is coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:11.561]  And you know what?
[02:01:11.561 --> 02:01:15.504]  I want people to send in to the Twitter account right now.
[02:01:15.504 --> 02:01:18.486]  Twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones.
[02:01:18.486 --> 02:01:20.708]  Evidence of terrorism you want me to report.
[02:01:21.476 --> 02:01:27.280]  Because I know about Ammar al-Awlaki, the head of Al-Qaeda, hanging out secretly at the Pentagon, Fox News.
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:31.423]  I know about Gulf of Tonkin being staged, you know, to let them know that government does do this.
[02:01:31.423 --> 02:01:33.504]  Operation Northwoods.
[02:01:33.504 --> 02:01:34.625]  I do know... Oh!
[02:01:34.625 --> 02:01:35.125]  Oh!
[02:01:35.125 --> 02:01:45.853]  Will you guys print me Watson's article from yesterday about Jesse Trinidad who sued and got documents that the FBI did have a warning that they denied for years?
[02:01:45.853 --> 02:01:49.215]  And the head of the FBI anti-terrorism unit was there.
[02:01:49.215 --> 02:01:49.735]  We have the...
[02:01:51.035 --> 02:01:51.536]  I don't know.
[02:02:11.354 --> 02:02:16.937]  About the CIA aircraft, CIA aircraft crashes full of cocaine in Mexico.
[02:02:16.937 --> 02:02:28.023]  I want to have a few articles in front of me so I can report, you know, well, why was there never an investigation of the CIA aircraft crashing and killing those aboard with three and a half tons of pure cocaine?
[02:02:28.023 --> 02:02:30.104]  Why aren't you investigating Amarillo Lockheed?
[02:02:30.104 --> 02:02:32.226]  Newsweek, hijackers trained at U.S.
[02:02:32.226 --> 02:02:33.446]  bases.
[02:02:33.446 --> 02:02:35.467]  I think that's newsworthy.
[02:02:35.467 --> 02:02:39.309]  And, you know, the average FBI agent answering the phone at Homeland Security I don't think is a bad person.
[02:02:39.309 --> 02:02:40.110]  They're compartmentalized.
[02:02:41.536 --> 02:02:47.520]  We've had FBI visits here before, and I take it as a time to educate them.
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:51.603]  I take it as a time to set them down and say, okay, you got questions for me, I got questions for you.
[02:02:51.603 --> 02:03:00.529]  And they'll sit there and kind of joke about stuff when I tell them what's happening, and I go, you know this isn't, you know this country isn't going in the right direction.
[02:03:00.529 --> 02:03:03.571]  You know I'm not making this up.
[02:03:03.571 --> 02:03:05.953]  And people ask, why was the FBI here?
[02:03:05.953 --> 02:03:09.816]  You can just Google FBI visits, Alex Jones, Secret Service visits, if you want to read the history of it.
[02:03:11.334 --> 02:03:18.236]  It's that dag-blasted comment board and the comments on the stories.
[02:03:18.236 --> 02:03:21.937]  They show up with subpoenas for records and it's not fun.
[02:03:21.937 --> 02:03:25.338]  It's happened twice.
[02:03:25.338 --> 02:03:28.958]  Another time they showed up asking for stuff.
[02:03:28.958 --> 02:03:35.240]  Another time the ATF came by investigating the firebombing of the governor's mansion.
[02:03:36.718 --> 02:03:38.500]  But, you know, I'm a guy in the right.
[02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:45.790]  I mean, I really do my best to follow all the laws, even if they're unconstitutional, because I've got to have a very clean nose.
[02:03:45.790 --> 02:03:50.356]  I've got to have an extremely clean nose in everything I do because I'm under total surveillance.
[02:03:54.241 --> 02:03:57.842]  You know, I haven't eaten anything since about 6.30 last night.
[02:03:57.842 --> 02:04:05.044]  I had some carrots and some rice, and I hope that lunch gets here, because I need my energy to call the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:04:05.044 --> 02:04:11.646]  You know, it was like a burden to confront Karl Rove Sunday, and I didn't really fully confront him.
[02:04:11.646 --> 02:04:14.367]  I just said, I'm not eating next to the equivalent of Hitler.
[02:04:14.367 --> 02:04:15.407]  That guy's a war criminal.
[02:04:15.407 --> 02:04:16.427]  We're leaving.
[02:04:16.427 --> 02:04:17.568]  We were sitting right next to him.
[02:04:17.568 --> 02:04:19.308]  So, I mean, I guess that's a protest in a way.
[02:04:19.308 --> 02:04:21.409]  I should have gotten his face.
[02:04:23.616 --> 02:04:26.778]  I've gotten in so many people's faces, and I'm really just sick of looking at them.
[02:04:26.778 --> 02:04:28.759]  I mean, I was physically upset being around him.
[02:04:28.759 --> 02:04:32.881]  This is a guy who pushed torture, illegal wars, over a million dead Iraqis.
[02:04:32.881 --> 02:04:37.804]  I mean, I was sitting next to Emperor Palpatine, and I just... It wasn't even fear of him.
[02:04:37.804 --> 02:04:38.864]  It was disgust.
[02:04:38.864 --> 02:04:39.705]  I was repelled.
[02:04:40.874 --> 02:04:45.019]  And the demonic gibbering I heard for 25 minutes, the giggling.
[02:04:45.019 --> 02:04:50.485]  I mean, I cannot describe to you the satanic cackling of the women and his gibbering.
[02:04:50.485 --> 02:04:51.887]  And he's known as Little Piggy.
[02:04:51.887 --> 02:04:53.028]  He has this little piggy.
[02:04:53.028 --> 02:04:56.332]  I mean, I can't even do it.
[02:04:56.332 --> 02:04:58.795]  Just give me strength, God.
[02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:05.173]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:05:05.173 --> 02:05:11.578]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:05:11.578 --> 02:05:18.964]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:05:18.964 --> 02:05:23.848]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:05:23.848 --> 02:05:25.990]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:05:28.772 --> 02:05:32.534]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:05:32.534 --> 02:05:34.815]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:05:34.815 --> 02:05:35.155]  Call us!
[02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:48.861]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:05:48.861 --> 02:05:56.446]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:05:56.446 --> 02:05:59.448]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:06:11.417 --> 02:06:16.800]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:19.822]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:06:19.822 --> 02:06:22.144]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:06:22.144 --> 02:06:28.408]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:06:28.408 --> 02:06:31.790]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:37.573]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:06:37.573 --> 02:06:39.214]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:06:39.214 --> 02:06:40.335]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:06:40.495 --> 02:06:43.177]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:06:43.177 --> 02:06:47.399]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:06:47.399 --> 02:06:52.021]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:52.021 --> 02:06:54.603]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:06:54.603 --> 02:06:58.465]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:58.465 --> 02:06:59.465]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:00.746 --> 02:07:04.328]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:07:04.328 --> 02:07:05.449]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:07:05.449 --> 02:07:10.012]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:07:10.012 --> 02:07:15.955]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:07:15.955 --> 02:07:18.116]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:07:18.116 --> 02:07:20.798]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:07:21.138 --> 02:07:27.643]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:07:27.643 --> 02:07:29.844]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:07:29.844 --> 02:07:35.188]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:07:35.188 --> 02:07:40.472]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:07:40.472 --> 02:07:45.656]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:07:45.836 --> 02:07:49.038]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:07:49.038 --> 02:07:52.099]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:07:52.099 --> 02:07:53.660]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:07:53.660 --> 02:07:56.781]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.785 --> 02:08:20.707]  I'm going to call the White House live on air.
[02:08:20.707 --> 02:08:27.530]  I'm going to call the Department of Homeland Security live on air.
[02:08:27.530 --> 02:08:37.816]  I called Sunday the Dallas FBI and I brought up Anwar al-Awlaki and other top terrorists at the Pentagon months after 9-11.
[02:08:37.816 --> 02:08:40.017]  Why isn't that being investigated?
[02:08:40.017 --> 02:08:42.218]  CIA aircraft crashes full of cocaine.
[02:08:42.218 --> 02:08:45.359]  They're not investigating that.
[02:08:45.359 --> 02:08:45.960]  Two trillion
[02:08:47.455 --> 02:08:53.100]  Back in 2001, now it's over $4 trillion in congressional hearings missing, but they're not investigating it.
[02:08:53.100 --> 02:09:00.367]  So, I'm going to be calling them all live on air to also report that we gotta see something, say something, Flyer.
[02:09:00.367 --> 02:09:03.950]  You know, that's got the guy in the airport looking at people.
[02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:06.672]  You're not sure if he's supposedly the terrorist or he's looking at the terrorists.
[02:09:06.672 --> 02:09:08.294]  It's all about this paranoia.
[02:09:08.294 --> 02:09:09.935]  You know, trust no one but your government.
[02:09:09.935 --> 02:09:12.417]  Trust no one but Big Brother and Big Brother's watching.
[02:09:14.696 --> 02:09:25.903]  I also want to tell them that this Homeland Security number we called a few months ago, that's on See Something Flyers Now, is not being answered.
[02:09:25.903 --> 02:09:34.588]  And Bob Barr's lawsuit has not been answered, or his FOIA request before a lawsuit has not been answered, and they're supposed to respond to that.
[02:09:34.588 --> 02:09:35.488]  In fact, we should probably get
[02:09:39.192 --> 02:09:53.120]  Bob Barr's organization, or Bob Barr himself, to pop back in on the show this week to see where that foyer went, because what, a week or two ago the deadline passed, and we had the Director of Liberty Guard on the show.
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:55.542]  We've also had Bob Barr on, the founder of it.
[02:09:55.542 --> 02:09:57.123]  So we're going to be talking about all of that.
[02:09:57.123 --> 02:10:05.588]  But I'll be honest with you, this radio show does need your prayers, because our profile is shooting up like a rocket.
[02:10:07.139 --> 02:10:10.482]  At a fleshly level, I am not pleased by it.
[02:10:10.482 --> 02:10:12.303]  I'm not stupid.
[02:10:12.303 --> 02:10:17.387]  And I understand the dangers of engaging these crooks and the dangers of really exposing what they're doing.
[02:10:17.387 --> 02:10:22.410]  And it's by the grace of God I'm still above ground and not pushing daisies.
[02:10:22.410 --> 02:10:24.172]  It's by the grace of God I haven't been set up.
[02:10:24.172 --> 02:10:25.773]  They've certainly tried.
[02:10:25.773 --> 02:10:32.278]  It's by the grace of God and my flesh, my own human desires are, I want to travel.
[02:10:33.283 --> 02:10:34.624]  I want to oil paint.
[02:10:34.624 --> 02:10:37.245]  I want to stay at home and play with my children.
[02:10:37.245 --> 02:10:39.787]  I want to go on trips with my wife.
[02:10:39.787 --> 02:10:42.429]  I want to take my son and my daughters fishing.
[02:10:42.429 --> 02:10:49.213]  And I don't get a chance to do a lot of that because I'm completely focused on this mission.
[02:10:49.213 --> 02:10:52.555]  And every day I have this passionate, deep desire to quit.
[02:10:53.703 --> 02:10:55.207]  And to just walk away from all of this.
[02:10:55.207 --> 02:10:57.933]  They're having to manage people and deal with things.
[02:10:57.933 --> 02:11:00.378]  And I'm not complaining.
[02:11:00.378 --> 02:11:02.243]  You know the rigors of life out there as well.
[02:11:08.527 --> 02:11:30.284]  When I routinely get called by huge Hollywood stars who want to talk to me but don't want to go on air, when I routinely get called by, you know, some of the biggest rock band leaders in the world, when I get calls from powerful politicians that want to talk off-record, it isn't like an ego thing of, wow, I'm really big, wow, I'm able to push stories out nationwide, wow.
[02:11:30.284 --> 02:11:35.228]  It's more of, man, I am at the front end of this thing, tip of the spear, hitting the barbed wire.
[02:11:37.802 --> 02:11:41.004]  It isn't even fear that I have of being killed or in prison.
[02:11:41.004 --> 02:11:41.824]  It's not fear.
[02:11:41.824 --> 02:11:44.065]  It is remorse.
[02:11:44.065 --> 02:11:52.650]  It is almost like I'm nostalgic for the life I could have had.
[02:11:52.650 --> 02:12:00.354]  But the globalists took all of the liberties we could have had in the future.
[02:12:00.354 --> 02:12:06.457]  I mean, they're putting a system in that's destroying our future, and so they've got to be responded to.
[02:12:06.457 --> 02:12:07.178]  But this is not
[02:12:08.797 --> 02:12:10.278]  Fun or a game.
[02:12:10.278 --> 02:12:11.378]  I have gallows humor.
[02:12:11.378 --> 02:12:21.363]  I try to have a stiff upper lip and put my chin up, but I don't even like being this leader.
[02:12:21.363 --> 02:12:23.304]  I don't see myself as that great.
[02:12:23.304 --> 02:12:32.789]  I don't enjoy going and speaking to big crowds of people, though folks will remark I'm about as good as it gets at public speaking because I speak from the heart, and people connect with that.
[02:12:32.789 --> 02:12:34.129]  It's electric.
[02:12:34.129 --> 02:12:35.330]  I like shaking their hands,
[02:12:36.564 --> 02:12:43.105]  And I like seeing them, but I don't like how they're looking at me like I've got all the answers, because I know how weak I am.
[02:12:43.105 --> 02:12:46.586]  I know how human I am.
[02:12:46.586 --> 02:12:49.586]  I know somebody's got to call Homeland Security and call them out.
[02:12:49.586 --> 02:12:51.867]  You think it's fun doing that?
[02:12:51.867 --> 02:12:59.908]  I know why so many listeners that see me in the last few times I've done this, they hear these calls and they say on YouTube everywhere, these aren't real.
[02:12:59.908 --> 02:13:02.609]  I mean, you can hear me dialing the public numbers.
[02:13:02.609 --> 02:13:03.569]  You can hear the tones.
[02:13:04.608 --> 02:13:08.510]  Anybody who's worked in telephone systems knows, I mean, we're down on the numbers.
[02:13:08.510 --> 02:13:12.031]  We're calling them, but people can't believe that someone has courage.
[02:13:12.031 --> 02:13:15.713]  They can't believe someone is real, because they don't believe in themselves.
[02:13:15.713 --> 02:13:23.956]  And so it's my job to show you what you can do, because you can surpass everything I've done.
[02:13:23.956 --> 02:13:27.237]  And until the last few years, I haven't really seen other talk show hosts.
[02:13:27.237 --> 02:13:33.360]  I haven't really seen other leaders stand up who really are starting to get it.
[02:13:34.639 --> 02:13:45.587]  But my understanding, my paradigm analysis, my full spectrum analysis is now being adopted across the board, even by my detractors, and I love it.
[02:13:45.587 --> 02:13:54.654]  It is a pleasure to be attacked because they haven't grown enough spiritually to not be jealous and envious, and they're not even conscious of it, and they're projecting their own shortcomings onto me.
[02:13:55.948 --> 02:14:01.430]  And sometimes I do deserve it, but it is so fulfilling that at least they steal everything we do.
[02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:03.810]  They steal my understanding, my discernment.
[02:14:03.810 --> 02:14:04.711]  Good!
[02:14:04.711 --> 02:14:05.651]  Good!
[02:14:05.651 --> 02:14:11.213]  Clonk me on the head when you come to the well to drink, but drink so you don't die in the desert.
[02:14:11.213 --> 02:14:14.114]  I mean, it's wonderful.
[02:14:14.114 --> 02:14:15.934]  And I've realized that God does this.
[02:14:15.934 --> 02:14:19.115]  He takes attacks and turns them into something good.
[02:14:23.846 --> 02:14:34.953]  I feel bad for my wife who has to know all these lies are pure disinformation from the mainstream media, the think tanks, the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the COINTELPRO.
[02:14:34.953 --> 02:14:44.960]  And I feel sorry for my children as they grow up that I may not be there to be with them and that they'll have to hear further lies because I have become a symbol of resistance.
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:48.262]  Not a perfect symbol, but a symbol because I'm real.
[02:14:48.262 --> 02:14:51.304]  And they will attempt and are attempting to pull that symbol down.
[02:14:53.735 --> 02:15:03.620]  And that's why it's important that you be leaders in your own right, because they can pull down a leader, they can pull down a symbol, an image, if it's a person, but an idea is unstoppable.
[02:15:03.620 --> 02:15:05.501]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[02:15:05.501 --> 02:15:07.582]  I'm flesh and blood.
[02:15:07.582 --> 02:15:09.703]  We're all gonna die.
[02:15:09.703 --> 02:15:16.506]  But I realize that we're gonna win this thing.
[02:15:16.506 --> 02:15:20.548]  I can see, I can see that we can come out of this storm.
[02:15:22.082 --> 02:15:26.966]  If we believe in each other, if we ask God for guidance.
[02:15:26.966 --> 02:15:35.132]  I ask callers to pray on Monday for Ray McGovern so that he doesn't have a relapse of his lymphatic cancer.
[02:15:35.132 --> 02:15:36.393]  He's gonna get the results back.
[02:15:36.393 --> 02:15:38.855]  Let's call him and see what the results were.
[02:15:38.855 --> 02:15:45.080]  I ask folks to pray for me, and I pray for you every night.
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:46.581]  And I pray for my enemies.
[02:15:46.581 --> 02:15:48.423]  I pray that my enemies have their eyes opened.
[02:15:50.657 --> 02:16:02.123]  Because I don't want them to live their life and serve the dark side and not have a chance to experience what those of us that love God and love liberty and have discernment have had a chance to experience.
[02:16:02.123 --> 02:16:06.925]  I love humanity.
[02:16:06.925 --> 02:16:14.069]  I am an enemy of those that are coldly calculating and evil and who use the knowledge of how humanity really operates against humanity.
[02:16:14.069 --> 02:16:18.131]  It is a great crime.
[02:16:18.131 --> 02:16:19.472]  But at the same time, I don't
[02:16:20.615 --> 02:16:22.676]  Hate them.
[02:16:22.676 --> 02:16:30.979]  Maybe a decade ago I had some hate, but when you see me get angry and yell and scream, it's frustration, it's desperation, it's also energy.
[02:16:30.979 --> 02:16:43.605]  And my soul swelling with the desire to have people have their chains unloosed, including my chains, the chains of the flesh.
[02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:48.811]  You know, on Monday I also said, let's pray for Charlie Sheen.
[02:16:48.811 --> 02:16:50.291]  I know Charlie really well.
[02:16:50.291 --> 02:16:53.172]  I'm one of his only really good private friends.
[02:16:53.172 --> 02:16:58.113]  He doesn't have many people that are really his friends.
[02:16:58.113 --> 02:17:03.334]  And Charlie didn't hear me say for folks to pray, but he's called me.
[02:17:03.334 --> 02:17:08.915]  We've talked quite a bit in the last few days and he's at home and he's
[02:17:11.633 --> 02:17:16.996]  He told me that about 95% of what's in the news was just complete lies.
[02:17:16.996 --> 02:17:23.859]  But he said, you know, basically he has relapsed a little bit into behaviors he had a decade ago.
[02:17:23.859 --> 02:17:25.860]  And people say, well, then why are you his friend?
[02:17:25.860 --> 02:17:28.562]  Well, I mean, I've got sin.
[02:17:28.562 --> 02:17:29.422]  I'm not perfect.
[02:17:29.422 --> 02:17:30.863]  I have all those same desires.
[02:17:32.913 --> 02:17:35.594]  And he's a good person.
[02:17:35.594 --> 02:17:49.857]  He's somebody who's gone almost a decade without drinking and without doing other bad things, things that are destructive when they're used in excess, certainly drugs.
[02:17:49.857 --> 02:18:00.800]  I mean, think about Charlie Sheen growing up in Hollywood royalty, 14 years old being in big movies, 16 being in Red Dawn,
[02:18:01.983 --> 02:18:10.175]  And everything he's gone through and living in that armpit of Los Angeles around all that evil and
[02:18:12.622 --> 02:18:13.923]  That's all he knows.
[02:18:13.923 --> 02:18:14.844]  He's got a good family.
[02:18:14.844 --> 02:18:16.245]  Martin Sheen's a really nice guy.
[02:18:16.245 --> 02:18:17.205]  His mother's wonderful.
[02:18:17.205 --> 02:18:18.266]  His brother's great.
[02:18:18.266 --> 02:18:19.747]  The rest of his family are really good people.
[02:18:19.747 --> 02:18:22.589]  They're not even what you'd think of as a mainline liberal.
[02:18:22.589 --> 02:18:24.610]  They're against vaccines.
[02:18:24.610 --> 02:18:25.911]  They're awake to the new world order.
[02:18:25.911 --> 02:18:29.774]  I don't even know why I'm talking about Charlie Sheen, you know, with all these scandals going on.
[02:18:29.774 --> 02:18:32.396]  I haven't talked about it in the last few months.
[02:18:32.396 --> 02:18:36.359]  But, you know, talking to him, you know, he needs real friends.
[02:18:36.359 --> 02:18:42.143]  And Charlie needs your prayers because he's really trying right now, you know, to slow down.
[02:18:43.877 --> 02:18:59.694]  And it's just really important that we reach out to people and that we reach out to ourselves and that we all help each other and that we not be so judgmental because Charlie has a good heart.
[02:19:00.762 --> 02:19:03.504]  You know, Charlie will obsess on certain things, like anybody else.
[02:19:03.504 --> 02:19:14.951]  He's either all into fighting the New World Order, or he's all into collecting watches, or then he's all into astronomy, or he's all into beautiful women.
[02:19:14.951 --> 02:19:22.897]  And who can blame somebody for that desire?
[02:19:22.897 --> 02:19:24.078]  I guess what I'm trying to say is,
[02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:28.722]  That we are a fallen society.
[02:19:28.722 --> 02:19:33.945]  And all of us have done things that are destructive to ourselves and others.
[02:19:33.945 --> 02:19:44.793]  And the difference is, somebody like Charlie Sheen has a heart that is a mile wide and a mile deep.
[02:19:44.793 --> 02:19:50.718]  And somebody like Karl Rove has a heart that isn't even one inch deep.
[02:19:50.718 --> 02:19:52.199]  And he's somebody who really does care.
[02:19:53.678 --> 02:19:55.943]  And he's somebody that everybody just expects to be bad.
[02:19:55.943 --> 02:19:58.208]  So even when he's good, they say he's bad.
[02:19:58.208 --> 02:19:59.632]  So why not be bad?
[02:19:59.632 --> 02:20:00.153]  Be right back.
[02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:05.783]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:05.783 --> 02:20:06.704]  Number 1.
[02:20:06.704 --> 02:20:10.127]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:10.127 --> 02:20:10.987]  Number 2.
[02:20:10.987 --> 02:20:15.891]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:15.891 --> 02:20:16.631]  It's true.
[02:20:16.631 --> 02:20:21.495]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.495 --> 02:20:22.336]  Number 3.
[02:20:22.336 --> 02:20:25.918]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:25.918 --> 02:20:29.601]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:29.801 --> 02:20:30.602]  Number 4.
[02:20:30.602 --> 02:20:33.364]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.364 --> 02:20:37.048]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:37.048 --> 02:20:37.849]  Number 5.
[02:20:37.849 --> 02:20:41.992]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:41.992 --> 02:20:46.757]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:21:06.263 --> 02:21:09.504]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:09.504 --> 02:21:14.305]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:14.305 --> 02:21:20.686]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:20.686 --> 02:21:22.927]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:21:23.467 --> 02:21:24.627]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:24.627 --> 02:21:25.408]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:25.408 --> 02:21:27.088]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:42.372 --> 02:21:44.514]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:44.514 --> 02:21:49.660]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:58.769]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:23:48.379 --> 02:23:51.420]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[02:23:51.420 --> 02:23:52.981]  Finishing up my point on Charlie Sheen.
[02:24:14.776 --> 02:24:26.959]  Of the scores of Hollywood stars, government people, billionaires that have called me or come and visited me over the years, almost all of them want to be private.
[02:24:26.959 --> 02:24:29.580]  They just want to say, I support what you're doing.
[02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:30.420]  And that's great.
[02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:34.901]  But I always say to them, well, I'm not going to pressure you to come on air, but we need solidarity here.
[02:24:34.901 --> 02:24:38.342]  And they just say, oh, you know, I don't want to be targeted.
[02:24:38.342 --> 02:24:41.503]  Well, then you give in to the overall takeover by doing that.
[02:24:42.639 --> 02:24:45.120]  But Willie Nelson doesn't have fear.
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:48.622]  I could call him up right now and probably get him on the show tomorrow.
[02:24:48.622 --> 02:24:51.304]  But he got a lot of death threats and things, so I don't even want to put him in that position.
[02:24:51.304 --> 02:24:52.925]  He's come on three or four times.
[02:24:52.925 --> 02:24:56.627]  He's talked about 9-11 being an inside job.
[02:24:56.627 --> 02:25:00.409]  And then when it got raised on Larry King Live last year, he went ahead and said it again.
[02:25:00.409 --> 02:25:01.710]  Incredible courage.
[02:25:01.710 --> 02:25:04.972]  Jesse Ventura saw the facts of it being an inside job.
[02:25:04.972 --> 02:25:05.952]  Tells the truth.
[02:25:05.952 --> 02:25:06.713]  And Charlie Sheen.
[02:25:08.001 --> 02:25:08.862]  Charlie Sheen.
[02:25:08.862 --> 02:25:09.663]  I know him personally.
[02:25:09.663 --> 02:25:10.684]  He's a smart guy.
[02:25:10.684 --> 02:25:12.206]  He's interesting.
[02:25:12.206 --> 02:25:14.288]  He's informed.
[02:25:14.288 --> 02:25:16.591]  But he has his wild side.
[02:25:16.591 --> 02:25:21.957]  And that's why I'm saying pray for Charlie, because he's trying to get cleaned up.
[02:25:21.957 --> 02:25:25.520]  Again, he's told me, and I know he doesn't lie to me, almost all of it's made up.
[02:25:26.510 --> 02:25:32.053]  I was talking to him last night, and I'm not going to get into really what he told me, but he was just like, I was like, why don't you say then it's not true?
[02:25:32.053 --> 02:25:34.174]  And he goes, oh, then that just gives it more attention.
[02:25:34.174 --> 02:25:36.315]  But he's like, not with this woman, not with that woman.
[02:25:36.315 --> 02:25:37.616]  That woman was never at my house.
[02:25:37.616 --> 02:25:39.517]  That just lies.
[02:25:39.517 --> 02:25:43.579]  It's incredible because he tells me the truth.
[02:25:43.579 --> 02:25:45.380]  And I've seen lies about him in the media before.
[02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:47.161]  And it's just most of it's not even true.
[02:25:47.161 --> 02:25:48.562]  But he told me some of it is.
[02:25:52.287 --> 02:25:53.888]  It's just incredible.
[02:25:53.888 --> 02:25:58.030]  It's incredible to watch something like that happen.
[02:25:58.030 --> 02:26:04.253]  But, pray for America, pray for the world, pray for everybody to not be weak in their flesh.
[02:26:04.253 --> 02:26:05.033]  And pray for Charlie.
[02:26:05.033 --> 02:26:08.675]  He's got a lot of courage, he's got a big heart, and I care about him.
[02:26:08.675 --> 02:26:10.116]  Okay, and I think it's helping.
[02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:13.541]  I mean, I think I know it is.
[02:26:13.541 --> 02:26:15.222]  I'm gonna call Homeland Security a minute.
[02:26:15.222 --> 02:26:26.229]  You remember in the first hour, I talked about how they're removing the fluoride in Calgary, they're getting ready to talk about removing it in San Diego, or they just started to try to put it in, now they're trying to block it.
[02:26:26.229 --> 02:26:33.273]  The vaccines that's coming out with big investigations causing brain disorders, big investigations by even the UN's World Health Organization.
[02:26:33.273 --> 02:26:36.235]  Talk about Satan investigating Beelzebub.
[02:26:36.235 --> 02:26:38.076]  All of that's going on.
[02:26:38.076 --> 02:26:39.177]  And the House,
[02:26:40.882 --> 02:26:43.323]  voted down the extension of the Patriot Act yesterday.
[02:26:43.323 --> 02:26:47.746]  Now, they think they have the votes in another maneuver they're going to do, but I said, watch!
[02:26:47.746 --> 02:26:51.448]  The fear-mongering is going to go stratospheric.
[02:26:51.448 --> 02:26:57.032]  Then, during the break before last, they brought this article in, and I hadn't read it yet, but I read it during the break.
[02:26:57.032 --> 02:26:58.773]  Here's ABC News.
[02:26:58.773 --> 02:27:01.954]  I've also got Reuters reporting the same thing.
[02:27:01.954 --> 02:27:04.316]  This just came out in the last hour.
[02:27:04.316 --> 02:27:06.837]  I was not aware of it, but I knew it was going to happen.
[02:27:06.837 --> 02:27:07.618]  It's cause and effect.
[02:27:09.005 --> 02:27:12.846]  Jump in front of a freight train going 60 miles an hour, it's probably going to kill you.
[02:27:12.846 --> 02:27:16.647]  Expose the globalists for using the Patriot Act to take over our liberties.
[02:27:16.647 --> 02:27:19.028]  If it looks like they're not going to get it through, they're going to scream bloody murder.
[02:27:19.028 --> 02:27:20.709]  This is their takeover.
[02:27:20.709 --> 02:27:23.790]  They've got to keep this in place.
[02:27:23.790 --> 02:27:24.630]  And what did she say?
[02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:30.652]  I told you, getting rid of the terror alert system is because they're just always going to be on the highest alert now.
[02:27:31.934 --> 02:27:32.695]  ABC News.
[02:27:32.695 --> 02:27:36.957]  Terror threat most heightened since 9-11, Napolitano says.
[02:27:36.957 --> 02:27:42.280]  Homeland Security officials call homegrown radicalism a game-changer.
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:44.421]  Oh, there's a game-changer!
[02:27:44.421 --> 02:27:53.767]  Al-Qaeda's gone from sophisticated stand-downs of NORAD men in caves, running attacks, T-boning all their targets perfectly, to magically now it's
[02:27:54.347 --> 02:28:00.594]  People recruited into Islam in prisons set up and run by the FBI where there's no real Muslim handlers.
[02:28:00.594 --> 02:28:07.561]  It's the FBI going out and finding miscreant criminals to hype them up to build fake bombs and go carry it out.
[02:28:09.531 --> 02:28:16.593]  The threat of terrorism is at its most heightened since 9-11 attacks nearly a decade ago, US Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said today.
[02:28:16.593 --> 02:28:21.795]  The terrorist threat facing our country has evolved significantly in the last 10 years and continues to evolve.
[02:28:21.795 --> 02:28:30.998]  So that, in some ways, the threat facing us is at its most heightened since those attacks, she said before the House Homeland Security Committee.
[02:28:31.678 --> 02:28:36.501]  And this just happened last hour and a half and it continues here.
[02:28:36.501 --> 02:28:39.463]  So she's saying that we are on the verge of attacks.
[02:28:39.463 --> 02:28:41.624]  It's the biggest threat ever.
[02:28:41.624 --> 02:28:42.465]  Boom.
[02:28:42.465 --> 02:28:44.486]  They vote down the Patriot Act yesterday.
[02:28:44.486 --> 02:28:44.826]  Boom.
[02:28:44.826 --> 02:28:49.429]  She's testifying saying this threat is incredible.
[02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:53.612]  We have got to get on this right now.
[02:28:53.612 --> 02:28:56.994]  We have got to get involved right now.
[02:28:56.994 --> 02:28:59.356]  We are in so much trouble.
[02:28:59.356 --> 02:29:00.917]  The terrorists are hiding everywhere.
[02:29:02.501 --> 02:29:04.602]  And she goes on with her quotes.
[02:29:04.602 --> 02:29:10.866]  One of the most striking elements of today's threat picture is that the plots to attack America increasingly involve American residency.
[02:29:10.866 --> 02:29:18.650]  As I always told you, they'd shift from the foreign al-Qaeda in the caves, because then they wanted to go attack and invade countries, so they claimed that's where it was coming from and staged it.
[02:29:18.650 --> 02:29:24.393]  Now, they're finding low-grade morons to create an artificial synthetic threat here.
[02:29:25.717 --> 02:29:29.560]  And she says, so it's Americans and homegrown and they're everywhere.
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:34.083]  Right as the see something, say something, telescreens roll out.
[02:29:34.083 --> 02:29:39.807]  Oh, magically, now Janet Napolitano is there to save us.
[02:29:39.807 --> 02:29:41.228]  Oh, we need the Patriot Act.
[02:29:41.228 --> 02:29:43.649]  There's domestic groups, white Al Qaeda.
[02:29:43.649 --> 02:29:44.370]  They're everywhere.
[02:29:44.370 --> 02:29:45.170]  They're gonna get us.
[02:29:45.170 --> 02:29:48.633]  And you see the media roll out now of the domestic control group.
[02:29:48.633 --> 02:29:51.455]  We're gonna call the government live on air coming up.
[02:29:51.455 --> 02:29:52.855]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.855 --> 02:29:54.377]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.370 --> 02:30:02.412]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.412 --> 02:30:06.433]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:06.433 --> 02:30:09.674]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.674 --> 02:30:14.475]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:30:14.475 --> 02:30:20.857]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.857 --> 02:30:23.098]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:23.638 --> 02:30:25.119]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:30:25.119 --> 02:30:26.219]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:26.219 --> 02:30:28.640]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.546 --> 02:30:49.813]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:30:49.813 --> 02:30:58.941]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[02:31:22.418 --> 02:31:25.080]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:31:25.080 --> 02:31:31.606]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:31:31.606 --> 02:31:33.107]  Buy American and stay clean.

[02:31:53.334 --> 02:31:53.654]  Thank you!
[02:32:00.606 --> 02:32:05.169]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:05.169 --> 02:32:06.070]  Number 1.
[02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:09.512]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.512 --> 02:32:10.373]  Number 2.
[02:32:10.373 --> 02:32:15.256]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.256 --> 02:32:15.997]  It's true.
[02:32:15.997 --> 02:32:20.880]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.880 --> 02:32:21.700]  Number 3.
[02:32:21.700 --> 02:32:25.283]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.283 --> 02:32:29.206]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:29.206 --> 02:32:29.466]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.986 --> 02:32:32.748]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.748 --> 02:32:36.412]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.412 --> 02:32:37.212]  Number 5.
[02:32:37.212 --> 02:32:41.356]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.356 --> 02:32:46.120]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:50.586]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.586 --> 02:32:52.368]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.368 --> 02:32:54.611]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:54.611 --> 02:32:56.975]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:03.353 --> 02:33:05.274]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:33:05.274 --> 02:33:06.634]  A lie!
[02:33:06.634 --> 02:33:08.634]  No man is obsolete!
[02:33:08.634 --> 02:33:10.515]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:33:10.515 --> 02:33:13.756]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[02:33:13.756 --> 02:33:19.217]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[02:33:19.217 --> 02:33:20.878]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:33:20.878 --> 02:33:21.958]  A crawling insect!
[02:33:22.398 --> 02:33:27.059]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[02:33:27.059 --> 02:33:28.560]  I am a human being!
[02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:36.302]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[02:33:36.302 --> 02:33:37.442]  I don't care!
[02:33:37.442 --> 02:33:38.483]  I tell you, I don't care!
[02:33:38.483 --> 02:33:40.683]  I'm a human being, I exist!
[02:33:40.683 --> 02:33:43.224]  And if I speak one foreign word,
[02:33:44.025 --> 02:33:47.747]  That thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[02:33:47.747 --> 02:33:50.908]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:33:50.908 --> 02:33:58.612]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[02:33:58.612 --> 02:34:05.656]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your kind!
[02:34:05.656 --> 02:34:09.698]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:34:09.698 --> 02:34:11.439]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:34:15.148 --> 02:34:21.413]  Broadcasting worldwide in defense of liberty.
[02:34:21.413 --> 02:34:24.034]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:34:24.034 --> 02:34:29.438]  We are live in the last 30 minutes of worldwide transmission.
[02:34:29.438 --> 02:34:31.520]  I may even go into overdrive.
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:34.202]  It is Wednesday, the ninth day of February, 2011.
[02:34:34.202 --> 02:34:41.947]  Okay, why am I about to call my public servants, the White House
[02:34:43.103 --> 02:34:52.189]  The main Homeland Security number because we've called these see something say something numbers that are on the flyers they're putting out and most the time it doesn't even have a voicemail.
[02:34:52.189 --> 02:34:57.552]  It's a computer and then beeps and you don't even know who you're calling and these are their listed numbers.
[02:34:57.552 --> 02:34:58.773]  We've gotten them off their Facebook.
[02:34:58.773 --> 02:35:00.494]  We've got them off their flyers.
[02:35:00.494 --> 02:35:08.339]  So I've been forced to call the FBI and I did this on Sunday live and report real evidence of terrorism.
[02:35:09.500 --> 02:35:19.129]  I'm also calling the White House first, because Friday they wrote a story saying that we were liars, basically, dealing with the blackouts.
[02:35:19.129 --> 02:35:22.472]  And I also want to respond to that.
[02:35:22.472 --> 02:35:30.278]  But the definition of terrorism, the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes.
[02:35:30.278 --> 02:35:31.119]  What does the IRS do?
[02:35:31.119 --> 02:35:33.421]  They threaten to take your bank account, your house.
[02:35:33.421 --> 02:35:34.802]  There's not really any due process.
[02:35:36.296 --> 02:35:39.978]  What do police do all over the country when you film them legally in public places?
[02:35:39.978 --> 02:35:41.139]  They arrest you now.
[02:35:41.139 --> 02:35:43.040]  The courts keep throwing it out, but the cops don't care.
[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:47.383]  They say, you can beat the rap, you can't beat the ride, you're not gonna videotape us.
[02:35:47.383 --> 02:36:00.751]  When they shot that poor young man in the back in handcuffs in Oakland last year, they confiscated three cell phones, but they didn't confiscate somebody in a train who'd stopped right across from the other train and videotaped it.
[02:36:01.516 --> 02:36:04.920]  And that's how they got, they lied and said he was out of handcuffs, he attacked him.
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:06.662]  Turned out it was all lies.
[02:36:06.662 --> 02:36:08.785]  They started roughing him up after they'd shot him in the back.
[02:36:08.785 --> 02:36:10.667]  They're like, get up, get up!
[02:36:10.667 --> 02:36:14.992]  They shot him and went through his back, bounced back up out of the concrete, back into his heart.
[02:36:14.992 --> 02:36:19.097]  Double tapped his heart with one bullet.
[02:36:19.097 --> 02:36:21.100]  Would that cop get like a year or something in jail?
[02:36:22.688 --> 02:36:24.429]  But the issue is none of us are safe.
[02:36:24.429 --> 02:36:28.310]  Police shouldn't want bad police to get away with this, or for it to be encouraged.
[02:36:28.310 --> 02:36:30.051]  Or that none of us are safe as a society.
[02:36:30.051 --> 02:36:30.891]  Come on!
[02:36:30.891 --> 02:36:32.372]  We're all together in this.
[02:36:32.372 --> 02:36:38.074]  Black, white, Arab, Jewish, German, Chinese, Mexican, old, young.
[02:36:38.074 --> 02:36:39.655]  We all need freedom.
[02:36:39.655 --> 02:36:43.316]  It's the engine of everything good and wholesome.
[02:36:43.316 --> 02:36:50.339]  Now, without further ado, let's get this train rolling here.
[02:36:51.428 --> 02:36:58.311]  Let's go ahead and on air, call the White House and it's a public number, it's 202-456-1414.
[02:36:58.311 --> 02:37:02.453]  Okay, we're calling the White House.
[02:37:02.453 --> 02:37:04.674]  People are so shocked by me doing this, I don't think it's that big of a deal.
[02:37:04.674 --> 02:37:07.075]  People are like, that couldn't be real, he wouldn't dare.
[02:37:07.075 --> 02:37:07.976]  Well, watch me again.
[02:37:10.407 --> 02:37:11.728]  Hey, this is Alex Jones.
[02:37:11.728 --> 02:37:38.146]  I'm broadcasting worldwide on AM and FM, shortwave, satellite, and XM, and I would like to talk to someone in the White House, A, about a news report they put out about, yours truly, the Chief of Staff did on Friday, claiming that Obama policies aren't causing some of the blackouts around the country, and I'd like to report that the see something, say something phone numbers that they're giving out aren't being answered or
[02:37:38.826 --> 02:37:42.327]  You are going to voicemail with no description of who it is.
[02:37:42.327 --> 02:37:43.327]  Who do you think I should talk to?
[02:37:43.327 --> 02:37:46.048]  Okay, and who are you with?
[02:37:46.048 --> 02:38:00.431]  I am Alex Jones with the Genesis Communications Radio Network and I'm calling my public servants to a report that they put out a false report about us on whitehouse.gov front page.
[02:38:00.431 --> 02:38:02.031]  One moment.
[02:38:02.031 --> 02:38:03.231]  One moment.
[02:38:03.231 --> 02:38:05.732]  Thank you for calling the White House comment line.
[02:38:05.732 --> 02:38:06.732]  We appreciate your call.
[02:38:07.359 --> 02:38:09.660]  Go ahead and get into the voicemail.
[02:38:09.660 --> 02:38:09.780]  See?
[02:38:09.780 --> 02:38:13.262]  You go into a straight dead end trying to call the government.
[02:38:13.262 --> 02:38:13.962]  Press 1.
[02:38:13.962 --> 02:38:14.102]  Oh!
[02:38:14.102 --> 02:38:14.442]  Volunteer.
[02:38:35.063 --> 02:38:43.929]  They can pay mercenaries $180,000 a year to kill women and children overseas, but they can't pay somebody to answer the phone.
[02:38:43.929 --> 02:38:45.470]  Okay, let's do this.
[02:38:45.470 --> 02:38:47.812]  I know why you guys weren't just going to number one.
[02:38:47.812 --> 02:38:49.433]  You wanted to see if there was an option.
[02:38:49.433 --> 02:38:50.173]  I've called before.
[02:38:50.173 --> 02:38:52.555]  I don't think there's an option.
[02:38:52.555 --> 02:38:57.519]  But let's hang up on it and call back and ask if I can talk to a live person.
[02:38:57.519 --> 02:39:00.761]  I want to talk to a live person here on air.
[02:39:04.707 --> 02:39:09.769]  Don't worry, we're going to get some action when I call Homeland Security.
[02:39:09.769 --> 02:39:17.493]  I want to talk to the Press Secretary's office.
[02:39:17.493 --> 02:39:20.114]  No, I want to talk to the Communications Director.
[02:39:20.114 --> 02:39:24.616]  Pfeiffer.
[02:39:24.616 --> 02:39:27.477]  Well, that went well.
[02:39:27.477 --> 02:39:28.458]  Let's call him back again.
[02:39:28.458 --> 02:39:30.339]  I guess now when you call the White House they just hang up on you.
[02:39:33.567 --> 02:39:34.587]  See how this goes here?
[02:39:34.587 --> 02:39:39.909]  And everywhere politicians go, everything they're doing, we should talk to them.
[02:39:39.909 --> 02:39:42.289]  Hello?
[02:39:42.289 --> 02:39:45.110]  So they got our number, huh?
[02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:46.310]  Dial them from another phone line.
[02:39:46.310 --> 02:39:49.251]  Can we do that?
[02:39:49.251 --> 02:39:52.412]  We're not going to be dissuaded so easily here.
[02:39:52.412 --> 02:39:53.332]  And you should do this.
[02:39:53.332 --> 02:39:54.732]  They're your servants.
[02:39:54.732 --> 02:39:57.393]  Your supposed tax money goes to pay for all of this.
[02:39:58.874 --> 02:40:07.038]  And so, I'm calling them, they have attacked me, they've said I'm a liar, and I want a response.
[02:40:07.038 --> 02:40:14.321]  They've said our report is completely false.
[02:40:14.321 --> 02:40:14.841]  Oh boy.
[02:40:14.841 --> 02:40:28.247]  Trying to call my public servants.
[02:40:31.767 --> 02:40:33.593]  Thank you for calling the White House.
[02:40:33.593 --> 02:40:38.727]  Press 1 for the comment line to leave a message for the President, or visit our website at www...
[02:40:43.086 --> 02:40:44.467]  Hey, hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:40:44.467 --> 02:40:47.809]  I'm broadcasting live worldwide right now from Austin, Texas.
[02:40:47.809 --> 02:41:09.560]  I would like to be able to speak to either the Assistant or to the White House Communications Director, because there was a report Friday at WhiteHouse.gov claiming that my report at PrisonPlanet.com was false, dealing with White House energy policy, contributing to the blackouts.
[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:10.561]  Just a moment, please.
[02:41:10.561 --> 02:41:11.581]  Ma'am, is there an actual person?
[02:41:11.581 --> 02:41:12.542]  Because I've been sent a voicemail.
[02:41:16.288 --> 02:41:16.908]  Please reach out.
[02:41:16.908 --> 02:41:18.730]  Thank you.
[02:41:18.730 --> 02:41:20.031]  We're reaching out now.
[02:41:20.031 --> 02:41:24.034]  Maybe Rahm Emanuel will answer.
[02:41:24.034 --> 02:41:27.477]  Hey, this is Alex Jones broadcasting live worldwide.
[02:41:27.477 --> 02:41:34.982]  There was a report put out at WhiteHouse.gov last week by Mr. Pfeiffer.
[02:41:34.982 --> 02:41:41.487]  What is he, the communications director?
[02:41:41.487 --> 02:41:44.109]  Guys, will you put that article back up on screen?
[02:41:44.109 --> 02:41:45.050]  I'm forgetting his title.
[02:41:50.543 --> 02:41:55.806]  Well, he's the... Callin' the White House here live on air, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:55.806 --> 02:41:58.707]  The little proletariat slave.
[02:41:58.707 --> 02:42:01.609]  I wonder if they're listening to us right now while we're on hold.
[02:42:01.609 --> 02:42:06.651]  I gotta get to callin' Homeland Security and others next, so... I don't know how long we can let this go on.
[02:42:06.651 --> 02:42:12.234]  Yeah, I can pull up the, uh... blackout story myself.
[02:42:18.899 --> 02:42:22.921]  We're gonna see if they come to the phone here.
[02:42:22.921 --> 02:42:23.402]  There it is.
[02:42:23.402 --> 02:42:25.743]  Yeah, Dan Pfeiffer.
[02:42:25.743 --> 02:42:26.584]  And what's his position?
[02:42:26.584 --> 02:42:28.285]  It's at the bottom.
[02:42:28.285 --> 02:42:30.446]  You can't believe everything you read.
[02:42:30.446 --> 02:42:33.548]  And then you scroll down there to the bottom with that report.
[02:42:34.748 --> 02:42:35.068]  I don't know.
[02:43:00.865 --> 02:43:04.166]  I guess they're busy there in the background going to see who they can find.
[02:43:04.166 --> 02:43:09.468]  Or I'm probably going to be put to voicemail.
[02:43:09.468 --> 02:43:17.952]  Jaren, let's officially start trying to get a hold of them through channels and see if they'll come on and respond to press reports that I'm on the White House enemies list.
[02:43:17.952 --> 02:43:23.494]  And on top of that, that they're writing these disinformation pieces about us.
[02:43:23.494 --> 02:43:24.294]  I think that's important.
[02:43:26.607 --> 02:43:33.711]  Alright folks, I'm not going to let this go on too much longer here live on air.
[02:43:33.711 --> 02:43:36.673]  What do you want to bet she doesn't come back for a while?
[02:43:36.673 --> 02:43:45.919]  Anybody want to place an imaginary wager?
[02:43:45.919 --> 02:43:48.420]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:43:48.420 --> 02:43:49.421]  Let's go ahead and hang up there.
[02:43:49.421 --> 02:43:51.342]  We've got to get moving on here.
[02:43:51.342 --> 02:43:53.564]  Let's go ahead and see the luck we have.
[02:43:54.758 --> 02:43:55.038]  When we
[02:44:15.717 --> 02:44:16.817]  Okay, fantastic.
[02:44:16.817 --> 02:44:19.599]  They're asking when I'm ready to go ahead and dial them.
[02:44:19.599 --> 02:44:24.901]  And so, then I called the FBI in Dallas, because that was the main number that came up in Texas.
[02:44:24.901 --> 02:44:27.042]  I couldn't find the number to the Austin FBI.
[02:44:27.042 --> 02:44:32.744]  During the Super Bowl, since she was saying, see something, say something, and I reported on all these instances of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:44:32.744 --> 02:44:36.346]  And so now I'm going to call the Department of Homeland Security itself.
[02:44:37.106 --> 02:44:42.628]  And ask who I should talk to from the see something, say something operation.
[02:44:42.628 --> 02:44:46.690]  We should all be calling the media, too, asking why these phone numbers don't work.
[02:44:46.690 --> 02:44:53.453]  Let's go ahead and call the Department of Homeland Security, the main number, 202-282-8000 and see if this works.
[02:44:53.453 --> 02:45:02.316]  Good afternoon, Department of Homeland Security.
[02:45:04.147 --> 02:45:08.811]  Hey, this is Alex Jones broadcasting worldwide on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:45:08.811 --> 02:45:16.396]  I've been calling Homeland Security, see something, say something, publish numbers, and they've just been going to voicemail, not even saying it's Homeland Security.
[02:45:16.396 --> 02:45:22.541]  And Big Sis has said that if we see something, we should say something immediately.
[02:45:22.541 --> 02:45:27.805]  And so I've got some reports of potential terrorist threats that I'd like to relay, but I don't know
[02:45:28.425 --> 02:45:29.986]  I don't know what numbers to call.
[02:45:51.022 --> 02:45:52.683]  Well, see, here's the thing, sir.
[02:45:52.683 --> 02:45:57.667]  DHS here takes your concern very seriously, sir, but our partners with local law enforcement, they access direct all suspicious activity to them, sir.
[02:46:13.909 --> 02:46:15.189]  Through the Threat Fusion Centers?
[02:46:15.189 --> 02:46:22.711]  But I have DHS Flyers that has this 877 number and other numbers.
[02:46:22.711 --> 02:46:30.714]  You're saying that citizens cannot report things to our loving federal government?
[02:46:30.714 --> 02:46:35.335]  No sir, I'm not saying that sir, but it starts off with the local law enforcement sir.
[02:46:37.822 --> 02:46:39.243]  Okay.
[02:46:39.243 --> 02:46:46.930]  I think that's... What's the phone number for the head of the rollout of the See Something Say Something?
[02:46:46.930 --> 02:46:51.614]  Can you put me in touch with the Press Office of Homeland Security?
[02:46:51.614 --> 02:46:53.976]  Guys, get the number to the Austin Police Department.
[02:46:53.976 --> 02:46:56.098]  I'm gonna call them.
[02:46:56.098 --> 02:46:56.559]  I guess that's 3-1-1.
[02:47:01.445 --> 02:47:13.007]  Hey, this is Alex Jones, and I'm broadcasting worldwide right now from Austin, Texas, and I've been trying to call numbers on DHS flyers for See Something Say Something, and there's not even a message.
[02:47:13.007 --> 02:47:14.588]  It's just a computer voice.
[02:47:14.588 --> 02:47:16.708]  I called it two months ago and was able to get somebody.
[02:47:16.708 --> 02:47:28.711]  It routed me to Atlanta, and then I'm being told I need to call local police, but I'm trying to report a federal matter that's going on there by the Potomac in D.C.
[02:47:28.711 --> 02:47:29.271]  at the Pentagon.
[02:47:33.317 --> 02:47:34.538]  Yes, I'd like to report it.
[02:47:34.538 --> 02:47:45.763]  And they told me I needed to call local law enforcement.
[02:47:45.763 --> 02:47:48.025]  Everything nice and compartmentalized.
[02:47:48.025 --> 02:47:52.127]  But I mean, they're setting up federally run threat fusion centers when they're already getting rid of the Tenth Amendment.
[02:47:52.127 --> 02:47:56.409]  I mean, maybe I should just call the Pentagon itself?
[02:47:56.409 --> 02:47:58.190]  Maybe the Office of Security at the Pentagon?
[02:47:59.585 --> 02:48:01.627]  They may be able to assist you.
[02:48:01.627 --> 02:48:01.707]  Yes.
[02:48:27.245 --> 02:48:27.765]  I don't think so.
[02:48:48.854 --> 02:48:49.494]  Okay.
[02:48:49.494 --> 02:48:51.975]  I mean, can you give that to somebody there?
[02:48:51.975 --> 02:48:56.036]  I mean, maybe Janet Napolitano can graciously... She says, see something, say something.
[02:48:56.036 --> 02:48:59.478]  Well, I mean, I got Newsweek reporting hijackers trained at U.S.
[02:48:59.478 --> 02:49:00.518]  military bases.
[02:49:00.518 --> 02:49:01.798]  I mean, it's right there.
[02:49:01.798 --> 02:49:08.341]  All these FBI agents have come out and said that they were ordered to stand down on 9-11.
[02:49:08.341 --> 02:49:12.722]  I want an investigation of that.
[02:49:12.722 --> 02:49:14.843]  You can contact the Office of Security, the Pentagon.
[02:49:16.064 --> 02:49:19.346]  Okay, well, ma'am, I really appreciate your help.
[02:49:19.346 --> 02:49:20.206]  Thank you so much.
[02:49:20.206 --> 02:49:23.828]  I mean, look, this is a normal response to this.
[02:49:23.828 --> 02:49:27.290]  I mean, look at the articles I want to bring up to him.
[02:49:27.290 --> 02:49:30.671]  I want to bring up the trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[02:49:30.671 --> 02:49:32.792]  Now, the lawyer has sued Jesse Trinity.
[02:49:32.792 --> 02:49:34.593]  We're going to try to get him on soon.
[02:49:34.593 --> 02:49:43.838]  He's got new documents confirming FBI got warning day before OKC bombing and how the feds tried to block it.
[02:49:46.278 --> 02:49:48.860]  And of course I've interviewed the emergency responders and others.
[02:49:48.860 --> 02:49:51.142]  The ATF wasn't in the building that day.
[02:49:51.142 --> 02:49:53.584]  They were told not to go in.
[02:49:53.584 --> 02:49:59.589]  But we're going to come back from break dialing hot to the APD.
[02:50:01.513 --> 02:50:07.298]  We probably want to call the detective's office, because what's going to happen is if we call 3-1-1, there's going to be an operator.
[02:50:07.298 --> 02:50:12.282]  So, I've had direct numbers to detectives before.
[02:50:12.282 --> 02:50:15.005]  When we're getting death threats, I go ahead and file those now.
[02:50:15.005 --> 02:50:18.988]  When the idiots are stupid enough in Austin to call me directly here and death threat me.
[02:50:18.988 --> 02:50:20.209]  Cops still don't do anything.
[02:50:21.410 --> 02:50:23.132]  One lady detective was actually pretty nice.
[02:50:23.132 --> 02:50:24.713]  She did call the guy.
[02:50:24.713 --> 02:50:28.736]  He said he was just joking She said well, and she didn't offer for me to press charges.
[02:50:28.736 --> 02:50:39.084]  I kind of knew I could but from now on I will press charges Because it needs to be taken seriously, but yeah, I think the APD is a good place to call
[02:50:40.286 --> 02:50:42.147]  But there you go.
[02:50:42.147 --> 02:50:43.188]  You notice I'm calling the government.
[02:50:43.188 --> 02:50:47.831]  It's not super powerful ring-wraith men in black or Agent Smith from the Matrix.
[02:50:47.831 --> 02:50:48.771]  It's just people like us.
[02:50:48.771 --> 02:50:51.953]  So we're going to come back and get into that as well.
[02:50:51.953 --> 02:50:53.794]  We're talking to our government.
[02:50:53.794 --> 02:50:54.355]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.645 --> 02:51:05.729]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.729 --> 02:51:10.234]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.234 --> 02:51:16.160]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:18.821]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.821 --> 02:51:24.925]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.925 --> 02:51:28.327]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.327 --> 02:51:30.208]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.208 --> 02:51:32.189]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.389 --> 02:51:38.052]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days, guaranteed.
[02:51:38.052 --> 02:51:42.374]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:42.374 --> 02:51:47.496]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[02:51:47.496 --> 02:51:48.336]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguaranteed.com.
[02:51:48.336 --> 02:51:49.037]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguaranteed.com.
[02:52:01.067 --> 02:52:03.448]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.448 --> 02:52:05.649]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.649 --> 02:52:08.971]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.971 --> 02:52:14.074]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.074 --> 02:52:18.276]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.596 --> 02:52:20.939]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.939 --> 02:52:23.483]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.483 --> 02:52:26.747]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.747 --> 02:52:34.337]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.679 --> 02:52:40.064]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.064 --> 02:52:42.906]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.906 --> 02:52:46.609]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.609 --> 02:52:47.670]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.670 --> 02:52:49.011]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:49.011 --> 02:52:50.512]  Invisible Empire.

[02:54:03.464 --> 02:54:12.968]  Okay, we may go into overdrive with these phone calls here live on this Wednesday edition, but we're illustrating how hard it is to report real evidence of terrorism and who's behind it.
[02:54:12.968 --> 02:54:19.271]  Okay, so I've been instructed by Homeland Security to call local police, even though they've got a federally run threat fusion center down here.
[02:54:19.271 --> 02:54:29.035]  I'm going to see if I can get routed over to the DPS command center, little Marshall Law Center, and report real issues that are taking place.
[02:54:29.035 --> 02:54:30.855]  Let's go ahead and dial the Austin 311.
[02:54:32.557 --> 02:54:36.218]  Then I'm gonna request, well, who I should talk to.
[02:54:36.218 --> 02:54:38.820]  Thank you for calling Austin 3-1-1.
[02:54:38.820 --> 02:54:41.961]  All calls may be monitored or recorded.
[02:54:41.961 --> 02:54:45.602]  Please stay on the line for the next available agent.
[02:54:45.602 --> 02:54:52.485]  If this is an emergency, please hang up and dial 9-1-1.
[02:54:52.485 --> 02:54:52.665]  Okay.
[02:54:52.665 --> 02:54:56.787]  Here we go.
[02:55:20.549 --> 02:55:21.811]  Hey, this is Alex Jones.
[02:55:21.811 --> 02:55:24.994]  I'm broadcasting worldwide, live right now.
[02:55:24.994 --> 02:55:32.222]  And I've been trying to call Homeland Security to report evidence of where the terrorist may be.
[02:55:32.222 --> 02:55:34.544]  And I've been told to call the local police.
[02:55:34.544 --> 02:55:37.848]  I guess, can you patch me through to the Threat Fusion Center?
[02:55:38.348 --> 02:55:41.190]  I'm sure finding it hard to put in a serious report here.
[02:56:07.029 --> 02:56:07.930]  Okay, one moment, sir.
[02:56:07.930 --> 02:56:08.870]  I'm sorry to hear about that.
[02:56:08.870 --> 02:56:10.391]  I'll be happy to go ahead and get you transferred through.
[02:56:10.391 --> 02:56:14.254]  They advised you that you need to speak with the local police department?
[02:56:14.254 --> 02:56:15.134]  Uh, yes, they did.
[02:56:15.134 --> 02:56:16.675]  Okay, let me get you transferred through, sir.
[02:56:16.675 --> 02:56:19.277]  You're calling from 512?
[02:56:19.277 --> 02:56:19.657]  Yes.
[02:56:19.657 --> 02:56:20.658]  Okay, one moment, sir.
[02:56:20.658 --> 02:56:21.699]  I'm going to get you transferred through.
[02:56:21.699 --> 02:56:22.459]  I think we're calling off the 311.
[02:56:22.459 --> 02:56:22.759]  Please hold.
[02:56:26.584 --> 02:56:29.165]  And then that tracks where we're at, so they have that information.
[02:56:29.165 --> 02:56:36.246]  And we're going to have to go to break here in a moment, and I'm tempted with the network just to skip the music and the break, because it's the end of the official show.
[02:56:36.246 --> 02:56:37.407]  We'll go into overdrive.
[02:56:37.407 --> 02:56:40.027]  Let's just skip it, and I'll roll right through.
[02:56:40.027 --> 02:56:43.868]  On the rebroadcast, folks, we'll hear this minute cut out, but we're just not going to play an outro.
[02:56:43.868 --> 02:56:47.209]  We're not going to... Well, I guess we have to, to fire tones for stations.
[02:56:47.209 --> 02:56:49.790]  So just hold music for the last few seconds.
[02:56:49.790 --> 02:56:53.171]  Just run like 10 seconds of the ad, so it fires for networks.
[02:56:56.038 --> 02:57:08.045]  Hey, Amanda, this is Alex Jones broadcasting live worldwide, and I've been trying to report where there's clear evidence that the terrorists are being commanded from here inside the United States.
[02:57:08.045 --> 02:57:15.809]  And I've called D.C., I've called Dallas, I've called the FBI, and they have directed me to call my local police department.
[02:57:15.809 --> 02:57:16.830]  For what reason, I'm sorry?
[02:57:17.755 --> 02:57:19.517]  I have Fox News headline exclusive.
[02:57:19.517 --> 02:57:22.741]  Al Qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just months after 9-11.
[02:57:22.741 --> 02:57:30.388]  Anwar al-Awlaki, who reportedly ran the Fort Hood attack, the underwear bomber, the Times Square attack, and many other attacks, is a known U.S.
[02:57:30.388 --> 02:57:32.050]  government agent run out of the Pentagon.
[02:57:32.050 --> 02:57:37.796]  And I have mainstream news here, and I want to report that the terrorists are being run out of the Pentagon.
[02:57:37.796 --> 02:57:39.618]  Okay, and how does that pertain to Austin police?
[02:57:41.149 --> 02:57:45.110]  Oh, well, I was told by Homeland Security in Washington, D.C.
[02:57:45.110 --> 02:57:48.430]  just minutes ago that I had to file it with you.
[02:57:48.430 --> 02:57:52.611]  Are you saying I cannot file this and other reports?
[02:57:52.611 --> 02:57:55.352]  A new document's been released via FOIA, confirmed.
[02:57:55.352 --> 02:58:02.233]  FBI got warning the day before OKC, and the head of the anti-terror unit was actually there and lied and said he was in Dallas.
[02:58:02.233 --> 02:58:04.353]  I've got, man, this is serious.
[02:58:04.353 --> 02:58:07.314]  You think I'm going to call the police live on air with something that isn't serious?
[02:58:08.194 --> 02:58:08.774]  Okay.
[02:58:08.774 --> 02:58:09.794]  Are you a police officer?
[02:58:09.794 --> 02:58:11.275]  No, I'm not.
[02:58:11.275 --> 02:58:12.815]  Okay, I need to talk to somebody.
[02:58:12.815 --> 02:58:16.676]  I've called Homeland Security, I've called the FBI in Dallas, and I'm calling you.
[02:58:16.676 --> 02:58:17.996]  I need to report this.
[02:58:17.996 --> 02:58:20.217]  And they tell you to call Austin Police?
[02:58:20.217 --> 02:58:20.757]  Pardon me?
[02:58:20.757 --> 02:58:22.197]  And they tell you to call Austin Police?
[02:58:22.197 --> 02:58:29.439]  Yes, they say, call your local police, and then I file the report with you, and then they will file it through the Threat Fusion Center to Homeland Security.
[02:58:29.439 --> 02:58:31.299]  Do you want our intelligence unit?
[02:58:31.299 --> 02:58:33.239]  Sure, and I'm not trying to be rude to you.
[02:58:33.239 --> 02:58:34.480]  I'm a little frustrated here.
[02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:35.780]  Yeah, it sounds like you're frustrated.
[02:58:36.731 --> 02:58:38.112]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:58:38.112 --> 02:58:40.194]  Hold on just one moment, ma'am.
[02:58:40.194 --> 02:58:45.178]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.178 --> 02:58:49.321]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:49.321 --> 02:58:52.063]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the...
[02:59:13.251 --> 02:59:15.633]  Your call is being answered by Audix.
[02:59:15.633 --> 02:59:20.556]  Extension 4-6-1-7 is not available.
[02:59:20.556 --> 02:59:22.577]  To leave a message, wait for the tone.
[02:59:22.577 --> 02:59:25.819]  Otherwise, for assistance, press 0-2.
[02:59:25.819 --> 02:59:28.380]  Record at the tone.
[02:59:28.380 --> 02:59:31.422]  I'm Alex Jones, calling live, broadcasting on the air.
[02:59:31.422 --> 02:59:32.843]  I am very concerned.
[02:59:34.395 --> 02:59:46.500]  Since Sunday, I've called the FBI live on air, because the Homeland Security see something, say something, phone number on their flyers, goes to a voice box that has, doesn't tell you who it is, nothing.
[02:59:46.500 --> 02:59:54.403]  They're putting TV screens in 9,000 Walmarts and malls and other grocery stores, saying report on everybody, spy on your neighbors.
[02:59:54.403 --> 03:00:03.006]  Well, I've got real issues to report, and I've been told by Homeland Security in D.C., by the FBI in Dallas, and others, that I need to call
[03:00:03.966 --> 03:00:09.189]  The Intelligence Unit, and that you need to take my report.
[03:00:09.189 --> 03:00:24.418]  And that when you take my report, that I will then be able to have you give that information to the local spy federalization surveillance center known as the Threat Fusion Center.
[03:00:24.418 --> 03:00:28.541]  Now, because we're live on air, I don't want to give out my cell phone number on air.
[03:00:28.541 --> 03:00:29.742]  Sharon, just give me your producer number.
[03:00:29.742 --> 03:00:31.183]  We pull it up on the iPhone, I forget your number.
[03:00:31.183 --> 03:00:32.884]  I'm going to give you my producer's number.
[03:00:33.764 --> 03:00:41.729]  Uh, and I'm also giving you my number, but we're going to have to fade me down live on air right now so that I don't give that number out, uh, over air.
[03:00:41.729 --> 03:00:50.715]  Uh, so, uh, is that possible for me to, uh, for me to leave them my number, uh, and then also, uh, be able to not have it go out over air for a few seconds?
[03:00:51.836 --> 03:00:54.537]  Uh, Jaren is bringing me the producer phone number right now.
[03:00:54.537 --> 03:00:57.718]  I mean, seriously guys, I've had Arne Seveda in studio repeatedly.
[03:00:57.718 --> 03:00:58.998]  This is a serious report.
[03:00:58.998 --> 03:01:02.099]  Let me just go ahead and give you the report right now, just one of the big stack here.
[03:01:02.099 --> 03:01:04.900]  Fox News, October 20th, 2010.
[03:01:04.900 --> 03:01:08.802]  Exclusive, Al Qaeda leader dined at Pentagon just months after 9-11.
[03:01:10.282 --> 03:01:19.907]  This is the guy who they say ran the Fort Hood shooter, that affects us here, the guy that ran the underwear bomber, the Times Square, and it turns out he's a government agent secretly run by the government.
[03:01:19.907 --> 03:01:24.830]  Okay, so I'm reporting the Pentagon created Al-Qaeda in 1979.
[03:01:24.830 --> 03:01:26.730]  I'm reporting that they funded them and protected them.
[03:01:26.730 --> 03:01:30.953]  Newsweek has also, and don't laugh at this, I want you to look it up and find out it's true.
[03:01:31.633 --> 03:01:35.395]  I mean, are you just going to ignore this when you pull up the fact that hijackers were trained at U.S.
[03:01:35.395 --> 03:01:41.897]  military bases and the head of the Defense Language School told that to the San Jose Mercury News as well and Newsweek?
[03:01:41.897 --> 03:01:43.338]  Are you just going to ignore this?
[03:01:43.338 --> 03:01:48.160]  Okay, I'm reporting real information here, okay, and I'm upset about it.
[03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:50.221]  So I'm going to go ahead and fade me down off air for a minute while...
[03:01:53.837 --> 03:01:57.198]  Now, I've given you my number, okay?
[03:01:57.198 --> 03:02:06.820]  And I'm not just going to sit here like a jellyfish anymore when I have stacks of government documents that the government was involved in Oklahoma City, involved in 9-11, and all these places.
[03:02:06.820 --> 03:02:10.761]  And I'm going to continue to call state, federal, and local police departments.
[03:02:15.447 --> 03:02:19.669]  Oh, I've got a key intelligence report for you, but I've got 15 seconds left.
[03:02:19.669 --> 03:02:23.191]  I wonder if I'll hear from you, but you guys already know the terror threats manufactured.
[03:02:23.191 --> 03:02:24.751]  It's all about enslaving us.
[03:02:24.751 --> 03:02:27.212]  Well, it's a sad day for America.
[03:02:27.212 --> 03:02:29.093]  God bless you.
[03:02:29.093 --> 03:02:31.514]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, that's it for the transmission.
[03:02:31.514 --> 03:02:36.256]  I just illustrated to you, you can't get these people on the telephone, and you can't report terrorism.
[03:02:36.256 --> 03:02:39.398]  And the coup de grace in all of this,
[03:02:40.943 --> 03:02:47.111]  The thing that illustrates it better than anything, and Bob Barr's getting ready to sue over it with his Liberty Guard.
[03:02:47.111 --> 03:02:49.774]  They've done four requests on this and those are being ignored.
[03:02:49.774 --> 03:02:57.543]  They turned off all the scanners nationwide and the raped down pat-downs, the microwave machines, all of it, the microwave ovens they put us in.
[03:02:57.543 --> 03:02:58.784]  They turned those all off.
[03:02:59.938 --> 03:03:03.599]  Uh, on the day before Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving, and two days after.
[03:03:03.599 --> 03:03:08.581]  When they knew people were having a nationwide protest to say, we have a Fourth Amendment, we have liberty.
[03:03:08.581 --> 03:03:10.902]  Because they know the threat isn't real.
[03:03:10.902 --> 03:03:13.723]  They gotta stick their hand down every old lady's pants.
[03:03:13.723 --> 03:03:16.164]  They've gotta body scan every little kid.
[03:03:16.164 --> 03:03:20.145]  They gotta humiliate us and interrogate us, because Al-Qaeda is everywhere.
[03:03:20.145 --> 03:03:22.706]  As Janet Napolitano said, it's now the American people.
[03:03:22.706 --> 03:03:25.407]  They've made that flip from men in caves in Central Asia.
[03:03:26.127 --> 03:03:30.629]  From Pakistan to Afghanistan to Iraq into the Middle East to America.
[03:03:30.629 --> 03:03:34.791]  And they got telescreens going in, report everybody, report, report, call the locals.
[03:03:34.791 --> 03:03:41.375]  I'm calling up reporting the fact that the so-called terrorists were protected and given visas into the U.S.
[03:03:41.375 --> 03:03:46.818]  in 2001 just like it's now been confirmed Detroit Free Press, State Department, that the government
[03:03:47.563 --> 03:03:51.565]  Helped get the underwear bomber on the plane and protected him.
[03:03:51.565 --> 03:03:53.145]  This is admitted!
[03:03:53.145 --> 03:03:56.387]  And so let's use this corrupt globalist takeover against them.
[03:03:56.387 --> 03:04:04.770]  Use their own system, and everybody, call your local police, call your threat fusion centers, call the White House, call Homeland Security and say, listen here, servants!
[03:04:04.770 --> 03:04:08.691]  We know your bosses are carrying all this out to take our liberties, and we're done!
[03:04:08.691 --> 03:04:14.254]  We're calling you out, we know you're behind it, we know you're the ones that are doing it, and we're through with you!
[03:04:15.194 --> 03:04:27.712]  Stop staging stuff and going out and finding crackpot lunatics to carry out events as a pretext to take my children and everybody else's children futures and to steal all the bank accounts dry with the offshore banks raping this country!
[03:04:32.802 --> 03:04:33.263]  I'm tired of it!
[03:04:33.263 --> 03:04:35.765]  I just illustrated what a fraud it all is!
[03:04:35.765 --> 03:04:37.687]  They help the terrorists on the planes!
[03:04:37.687 --> 03:04:38.548]  They fund them!
[03:04:38.548 --> 03:04:39.649]  They protect them!
[03:04:39.649 --> 03:04:42.072]  They stand down when you're gonna have a protest!
[03:04:42.072 --> 03:04:43.934]  So that you can't ever have a victory!
[03:04:43.934 --> 03:04:45.775]  They won't answer their telephones!
[03:04:45.775 --> 03:04:47.017]  It's all a fraud!
[03:04:47.017 --> 03:04:48.138]  It's all a fake!
[03:04:48.138 --> 03:04:49.479]  It's all a scam!
[03:04:49.479 --> 03:04:50.180]  Pray for us!
[03:04:50.180 --> 03:04:51.361]  We're continuing on!
