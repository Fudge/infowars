[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:34.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:34.000 --> 00:41.000]  Last week there was a new climate-gate bombshell that didn't get as much attention as it should have,
[00:41.000 --> 00:50.000]  and more universities and institutions have been caught trying to cover up the fact that global warming has stopped in the last 19 years or so,
[00:50.000 --> 01:00.000]  and actually declined in the last six or seven, and that NASA knows this, the different meteorological services like NOAA know this,
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  and are desperate to keep propping it up as they segue on to weather change being abnormal.
[01:06.000 --> 01:14.000]  Oh my gosh, it's snowing in winter. Pay David Rockefeller money. Oh my gosh, it's hot in the summer. Pay Al Gore money.
[01:14.000 --> 01:22.000]  Oh my gosh, it's raining in the monsoon season in Asia. Oh my gosh, pay the UN money.
[01:22.000 --> 01:35.000]  So the climate McCarthyism scandal is growing. Lord Christopher Monkton of Brunchley, who famously parachuted into the UN meetings in South Africa trying to draw attention to their fraud a few years ago,
[01:35.000 --> 01:45.000]  and who broke the climate-gate, many of the climate-gate documents, as well as hackers released that, but he released even more that he was able to get,
[01:45.000 --> 01:54.000]  and he was able to leak the Copenhagen Treaty that was the World Government Treaty and help destroy that five years ago in Copenhagen.
[01:54.000 --> 02:04.000]  So he's going to be joining us via video Skype in the second hour to cover all things fake and viral power grab.
[02:04.000 --> 02:21.000]  And where the state of this major battle against Agenda 21 is that will be discussed coming up in the second hour of this worldwide Thursday transmission, the 22nd day of May 2014.
[02:21.000 --> 02:30.000]  That said, it is yet another total complete overload of information.
[02:30.000 --> 02:38.000]  Obama seeks sports for political refuge. That's the drudge headline from Bloomberg, and that's exactly what he's doing.
[02:38.000 --> 02:46.000]  Almost any time I see ESPN or Fox Sports, it's Obama on there promoting his agenda.
[02:46.000 --> 02:54.000]  Totally and completely disgusting to try to get the mindless bandwagon crowd in line for that.
[02:54.000 --> 03:03.000]  So here's what's up on infowars.com. Fed's set to bail out insurance corporations with taxpayer money.
[03:03.000 --> 03:15.000]  Cart NEMO. TSA to purchase 24 million rounds of duty ammunition. Paul Watson asked the question, Fed's preparing to arm TSA workers, and it's in the article.
[03:15.000 --> 03:29.000]  So careful to be accurate that the headline should really be TSA now to arm their gestapo because last year and this year their union said we want to be armed and they're moving to be armed.
[03:29.000 --> 03:39.000]  And to have a TSA federal police armed division expanded out of the quote viper teams that are already on the streets of America under the TSA.
[03:39.000 --> 03:49.000]  So the headline should be TSA to expand arming of its agents because it's already going on.
[03:49.000 --> 04:00.000]  But there it is, TSA to purchase 24 million rounds of quote duty ammunition. That's in the purchase order. It's not even target ammo.
[04:00.000 --> 04:09.000]  I quit counting it like 2.5 billion rounds a few months ago. We should do a whole article where we get all the different purchase orders and tally it together.
[04:09.000 --> 04:19.000]  Because what the establishment, Prestitute Media does is they go, oh, Alex says it's 1.6 billion or it's 2.5 billion over the last two years we've been reporting on this.
[04:19.000 --> 04:28.000]  Arms build up and ammo build up, munition build up. They'll go look only 100 million or only 200 million. See that's not 2 billion. He's lying.
[04:28.000 --> 04:37.000]  Not adding up all the line items that just stack into the stratosphere like some type of space elevator to hell.
[04:37.000 --> 04:44.000]  So that's coming up. Also US Special Forces with foreign troops practice invading Tampa to fight quote extremist.
[04:44.000 --> 04:52.000]  So foreign troops trying to take on the American people. That's ultra bomb shell. Who needs the United States? Not Russia and China.
[04:52.000 --> 05:00.000]  Video secrets to having a healthy baby. Democratic Senator. Wait till you hear it all coming up. Just wait.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate.
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[05:15.000 --> 05:23.000]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  On average the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[05:31.000 --> 05:37.000]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[05:37.000 --> 05:42.000]  All right, it is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment's not going to do it.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water.

[06:26.000 --> 06:32.000]  The InfowarsLife Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce body
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.000]  and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[06:35.000 --> 06:37.000]  This is not a low grade formula.

[06:41.000 --> 06:46.000]  to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  within a base of deionized water for your preparedness storage.

[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  Hi, folks. Alex Jones here with some important information.
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[07:25.000 --> 07:31.000]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  And that's why I stock MyPantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriot Supply.
[07:39.000 --> 07:45.000]  Go to MyPatriotsupply.com slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage

[07:57.000 --> 08:22.000]  Visit MyPatriotsupply.com slash Alex.
[08:27.000 --> 08:40.000]  Revolution in their hearts. Children start to march.
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.000]  Look at this headline out of CBS News. Talk about Orwellian.
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  Talk about Brave New World. Talk about Pharmakia Police State.
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  CBS News.
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  CDC reports more than 10,000 toddlers.
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.000]  Not only a fraction of that's being reported are medicated for ADHD.
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  They're on sugar. They're on red dyes. They're on all this crazy stuff.
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.000]  They're out of control. No one's disciplining them.
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.000]  The answer is put them on Adderall. Put them on Ritalin that absolutely retards growth.
[09:10.000 --> 09:16.000]  Causes brain shrinkage, heart expansion, heart attacks. You name it.
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.000]  Almost everybody I know knows people that have heart attacks while playing sports and die at major high schools.
[09:22.000 --> 09:30.000]  Two people, when I was in middle school and high school, died while playing football on the football field
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  or during two-a-days because they were on Ritalin.
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.000]  And I remember saying, no, they were on Ritalin and that caused a heart attack, the doctor said.
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  But it's okay because it's the medical establishment.
[09:42.000 --> 09:48.000]  I mean, that's the type of article I have, literally over 100 of them here today that need to be covered.
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.000]  That is the type of out of control garbage. The children need exercise. They need non-GMO.
[09:54.000 --> 10:00.000]  They don't need all the aspartame that's in most the chewing gum and candy now.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  All the different additives.
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.000]  Chicken McNuggets have a form of plastic in them, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  And that's public knowledge and no one gets in trouble.
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.000]  At least a few months ago when we covered and others covered the fact that Subway has a plastic emulsifier in its bread.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  They said they'd take that out.
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.000]  I mean, these are the issues while the children are bouncing off the walls, the electromagnetic radiation,
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  the four or five hours of television and video games a day.
[10:28.000 --> 10:38.000]  This is the issue. The public are watchers. They are spectators. They are in a trance state.
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000]  There's all sorts of medical issues and the answer is not burning their brains out with speed.
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.000]  Because it's true. You put somebody on speed, it'll mellow them out after a while after they burn out on it.
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.000]  And the argument is, well, they're so wound up, this has the opposite effect with their brain.
[10:53.000 --> 11:00.000]  It's all a load of horse crap. Excuse my French.
[11:00.000 --> 11:08.000]  Okay, where to start? We've got clips like this one coming up. Democratic senator.
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  Many people who oppose Obamacare because they're racist. And that's Senator Jay Rockefeller,
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.000]  who said the internet should never have been invented.
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  And it was the head of the Rockefeller family, dynasty now.
[11:21.000 --> 11:30.000]  They, the Rockefeller still attends Bilderberg, but he's kind of drifted off into the drifted off into the distance.
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.000]  And so that article is up on info wars.com.
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  And that is the standard response now.
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  You don't want to turn your guns in. You don't think the state rules your kids.
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  You don't want to open borders. You don't want to ship your job to China.
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  You don't want your power plant shut down. You got any opinion.
[11:51.000 --> 11:55.000]  You know the boiling temperature of water.
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.000]  You know how to tie your shoelaces. It's an act of racist evil.
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  By the man whose family founded Cold Springs Harbor and the modern eugenics movement
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  and funded Adolf Hitler as his main financiers.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  They are going to fight racism, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:13.000 --> 12:19.000]  Just like George Soros, no Nazi collaborator. It's ADL Southern Barbery Law Center Awards.
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000]  And it's faux menning and funding neo-Nazis right now in Eastern Europe.
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  He is held as a beloved, wonderful person.
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.000]  Arnold Schwarzenegger says he wants to be like Hitler. Where's Nazi uniforms?
[12:34.000 --> 12:39.000]  Told Rolling Stones he admires Adolf Hitler. He gets ADL awards.
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  He reportedly at home dresses up in an SS uniform.
[12:43.000 --> 12:50.000]  His dad was an SS captain running an entire town and disappearing people in World War II.
[12:50.000 --> 12:58.000]  In Graz, ADL awards. If you wear a Nazi uniform and actually are a Nazi, you get ADL awards.
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.000]  If you are not for Nazis, you get demonized by Southern Barbery Law Center ADL as a Nazi, as I am.
[13:05.000 --> 13:11.000]  MSNBC, White House Run. Alex Jones is, quote, deeply racist and they don't show one clip or one thing.
[13:11.000 --> 13:18.000]  This is the mindlessness of the political correctness and it works on people.
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  In most states, whites are now a minority. It doesn't matter. There was one white person being hunted down in a gully.
[13:23.000 --> 13:30.000]  I mean, shot in the back, you know, 200 years from now, there was no white people. It would still be a majority and still the problem.
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.000]  If you slip on a banana pill, it's white people's fault.
[13:33.000 --> 13:43.000]  And a lot of the so-called minorities, it's like keeping score or something using the claim of racism to feel and act however they want.
[13:43.000 --> 13:50.000]  It's just tribalism and the, quote, minorities are being taught to hate white people in their own form of tribalism.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  So that's coming up.
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.000]  Russia is taking Prince Charles' Putin and Hitler comment very seriously.
[13:59.000 --> 14:06.000]  He's called him Hitler, so is Jay Leno of all people trying to guess keep his job.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  Hackers are targeting millions of eBay users. We're going to get into that.
[14:09.000 --> 14:16.000]  Google wants to display targeted ads on your refrigerator and everything else in your house, tracking everything you do.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  That's in Wired Magazine. We're going to be breaking all that down.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  A Daily Mail article, have aliens already visited Earth?
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  NASA books suggest an ancient rock art could have been created by extraterrestrials.
[14:28.000 --> 14:35.000]  That's what the movie Prometheus and all this is about, is about introducing the idea that we were created by aliens
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.000]  because the DNA and all the science is proving that evolution didn't happen the way they said it did,
[14:40.000 --> 14:49.000]  that there's giant changes that happen overnight, and that humans are not of this world.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  And that's what NASA's basically saying.
[14:52.000 --> 14:59.000]  And so, again, I don't argue with the theory of evolution or the theory of creation
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.000]  because all of it is constructs of man looking at histories and ancient text
[15:05.000 --> 15:12.000]  and projecting the current debate onto it.
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, what some local preacher thinks about how the Earth was created
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  isn't even what the Bible says.
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.000]  They're just playing the part of God and their dogma that discredits Christianity,
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  but if you actually study the Bible, it's amazing and actually verifies it.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  But that's another trick of the world.
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000]  And then if you look at what the evolutionists say, pilt down man and pig skulls and pig teeth
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.000]  and all the hoaxes and all the lies, there is massive fraud in modern science
[15:41.000 --> 15:50.000]  and it's a religion of eugenics to sell the idea that the general public is scum and deserves to die
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  So, see, I reject it all.
[15:56.000 --> 16:02.000]  The controlled church's idea of the Earth being the center of the universe, we know that's bunk.
[16:02.000 --> 16:13.000]  And that that was just the perspective of people in the church at the time of their interpretation.
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  The Bible said the Earth was round in multiple places,
[16:17.000 --> 16:23.000]  but the ancients after the Dark Ages were saying that it was flat.
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  I mean, it's the same thing over and over again.
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  So, bottom line, I reject the priest of the church to all debate and argue with each other
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  and have a thousand different interpretations of the Bible.
[16:36.000 --> 16:45.000]  And I also reject the church of the eugenicists who pose as speaking from the throne of total truth,
[16:45.000 --> 16:50.000]  the ex-cathedra, that everything they say is true when they're all debating with each other
[16:50.000 --> 16:55.000]  and all have their own little pet theorems.
[16:55.000 --> 16:57.000]  We're going to be breaking that article down today.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  We're going to cover it all.
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.000]  Lord Moncton joins us with the huge McCarthyism sweeping the world to try to persecute those
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.000]  that point out the public documents that Climate Gate and the latest Climate Gate that broke last week
[17:08.000 --> 17:14.000]  prove that the whole environmental movement is a power grab and is not actually trying to help the Earth.
[17:14.000 --> 17:21.000]  That is all coming up as well.
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  We are also going to continue getting into some of the really important news reports,
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  and I'll cover this first when we come back from break.
[17:29.000 --> 17:36.000]  TSA to purchase 24 million rounds of duty ammunition.
[17:36.000 --> 17:39.000]  And Paul Watson goes on to ask the question,
[17:39.000 --> 17:44.000]  are feds preparing to arm TSA workers?
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  That's like asking, do elephants have trunks?
[17:48.000 --> 17:55.000]  And in the article, Paul begs the question, he links to where they say they want armed TSA in the airports,
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  and they're already on the streets via the Viper teams.
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.000]  So the answer is yes, this is happening.
[18:00.000 --> 18:01.000]  We're going to break that down.
[18:01.000 --> 18:04.000]  Also, U.S. Special Forces, we have a newscast of this,
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.000]  and quote, foreign troops practice invading Tampa.
[18:09.000 --> 18:18.000]  Local news promises invasion is not the Russians or the New World Order.
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.000]  Nations, troops from 60 different nations participated in that.
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  We have video of that up on infowars.com.
[18:26.000 --> 18:33.000]  Also, House votes to shut down NSA phone snooping.
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  That's what the headline says.
[18:35.000 --> 18:36.000]  That's not what's really happening.
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.000]  NYPD, considering using drones and gunshot detectors to fight crime.
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  That means microphones.
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  You know, when they train to mow down the public in mass, they call it zombie kill training.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  No, it's mow down the public training.
[18:51.000 --> 18:56.000]  All of this is hiding in plain sight,
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  and it is coming up today, ladies and gentlemen.
[19:00.000 --> 19:07.000]  Also, we have a new record price of gas above $3 a gallon for 1,245 days.
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  That's because of dollar devaluation.
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  I told you this four years ago, and we did articles on it.
[19:13.000 --> 19:14.000]  We need to dig those up.
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.000]  It's now being reported.
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.000]  Angelina Jo Lee talks the possibility of running for office,
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  wedding and more on GMA.
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  Who cares?
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.000]  I mean, she is a anti-gun, world government promoting, pro-Africa invasion,
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  war monger who wants the UN and NATO to invade all these countries,
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  put al-Qaeda in charge.
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  She loved the Syria war, the Libya war.
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  She's a war criminal.
[19:40.000 --> 19:41.000]  And I've said that.
[19:41.000 --> 19:46.000]  Angelina Jo Lee is a guilty, like Joseph Goebbels of Nazi Germany,
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  of crimes against humanity.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  Crime aphasia.
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  I happen to know that she's seen my films with Brad Pitt.
[19:53.000 --> 19:57.000]  I happen to know they were aware of the new old order 10 years ago,
[19:57.000 --> 20:26.000]  and they chose to join it.
[20:28.000 --> 20:31.000]  Stop complying.
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.000]  Start rebelling.
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.000]  This is Tisha Cassida, and I'm challenging you to run for office.
[20:37.000 --> 20:40.000]  Neither corrupt political party offers young and new people
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  the opportunity to save our future.
[20:42.000 --> 20:46.000]  Stop the madness and move to the front of the line.
[20:46.000 --> 20:49.000]  Rebel with me and imagine that 9-1-1.com.
[20:49.000 --> 20:52.000]  Rebellion is located in Vale, Colorado this summer,
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.000]  an untraditional learning and networking experience.
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.000]  Buy your ticket now at ImagineThat9-1-1.com.
[21:25.000 --> 21:30.000]  Get your tickets now at ImagineThat9-1-1.com.
[21:56.000 --> 22:02.000]  Texas is facing a killer drought.
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  For 50 years, projects which could have protected us from this
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  were sabotaged by Wall Street profiteering
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  and the Zero Growth Anti-Science Green Agenda.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  Today these projects will not be enough.
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  We need a revolution in real science to take the lid off human progress.
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  I'm Tisha Rogers.
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  When you vote for me on May 27th in the Democratic runoff election for U.S. Senate,
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  you will be voting to put our space program back to work
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  to bring online thermonuclear fusion energy
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  and discover how the sun influences atmospheric dynamics and climate
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.000]  so we can control these things for the benefit of mankind.
[22:37.000 --> 22:40.000]  We must stop this fracking nonsense.
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  Shell gas is not an economic boom.
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  It's a backward strategy for doom.
[22:44.000 --> 22:48.000]  Vote for me, Tisha Rogers, in the Democratic runoff on May 27th
[22:48.000 --> 22:52.000]  to reject Wall Street sabotage and ensure a fruitful and productive future
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  for Texas and the nation.

[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  to reject Wall Street sabotage and ensure a fruitful future

[24:21.000 --> 24:29.000]  I authorize this message.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  As by Good Morning America yesterday,
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  whether she ever considered running for office,
[24:34.000 --> 24:44.000]  a human rights advocate replied,
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.360]  able to be effective, the Oscar winner added, Joe Lee previously dismissed the idea in
[24:49.360 --> 24:55.720]  Ears Pass saying she had too many skeletons in her closet, but that seems to have changed.
[24:55.720 --> 25:00.800]  What all the suicide stuff, the cutting herself, the devil worship, the wearing blood around
[25:00.800 --> 25:06.480]  her neck saying she loves darkness and murder, stuff like that.
[25:06.480 --> 25:17.240]  I love how she's a human rights advocate with the UN, like David Rockefeller is a philanthropist
[25:17.240 --> 25:23.880]  and Jay Rockefeller is a humanitarian and David Der Rothschild who we got on the show
[25:23.880 --> 25:29.240]  is a humanitarian, a philanthropist and an adventurer.
[25:29.240 --> 25:35.280]  He's like Indiana Jones, why he went to the Arctic once, hundreds of years after people
[25:35.280 --> 25:40.880]  pioneered it in the middle of winter and went to the North Pole.
[25:40.880 --> 25:46.880]  Why did you hear he looked at the moon with a telescope so he's Neil Armstrong now?
[25:46.880 --> 25:51.240]  He flew by helicopter to the North Pole once, he's a trailblazer.
[25:51.240 --> 25:58.160]  Did you hear David Der Rothschild actually found the Lewis and Clark trail and actually
[25:58.160 --> 26:01.480]  went from the east coast to the west coast just last year?
[26:01.480 --> 26:02.480]  Did you hear that?
[26:02.480 --> 26:07.000]  He covered California, folks.
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.920]  So Rothschild there from England, did you know he's a hero?
[26:12.920 --> 26:15.520]  I asked him when he was on the show, I was able to get him on because he had a children's
[26:15.520 --> 26:18.320]  book of brainwashing out about how polar bears couldn't swim.
[26:18.320 --> 26:24.440]  I said, okay, well why are the ice caps of Mars previously melting?
[26:24.440 --> 26:27.560]  I said now they're expanding because global warming had reversed, that was seven years
[26:27.560 --> 26:30.160]  ago and it was already clearly reversing.
[26:30.160 --> 26:36.600]  I said, why are the ice caps of Mars getting smaller too, it's because the sun's heating
[26:36.600 --> 26:37.600]  up.
[26:37.600 --> 26:41.680]  He said, no, it's because Mars is closer to the sun than the earth.
[26:41.680 --> 26:44.840]  And I said, no it isn't, it's Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and then on out.
[26:44.840 --> 26:46.600]  And he said, no it's not.
[26:46.600 --> 26:53.320]  And laughed thinking my audience was the general public that of an authority, a Rothschild
[26:53.320 --> 26:58.440]  says, you know, he's literally the guys that Jesus looked like, he literally looked like
[26:58.440 --> 27:06.080]  Jesus, acts like Jesus, says he wants to save the earth, he is our Christ.
[27:06.080 --> 27:13.480]  Our Christ, Al Gore's a Christ as well, saving us, inventing the internet, he said, no, it
[27:13.480 --> 27:16.120]  is closer to the sun than the earth.
[27:16.120 --> 27:21.120]  Doesn't matter if it's Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, the asteroid belt, Jupiter, the largest
[27:21.120 --> 27:27.680]  planet, the super giant, the gas giant, Saturn, the next gas giant, Uranus, the next gas giant,
[27:27.680 --> 27:31.720]  Neptune and then Pluto, which isn't even considered a planet anymore, and over 300 bodies the
[27:31.720 --> 27:35.560]  size of Pluto are bigger in the Kuiper Belt.
[27:35.560 --> 27:40.920]  It doesn't matter that a seven year old should know that, he thinks you're a moron and he
[27:40.920 --> 27:52.280]  says to you, I say Mars is closest to the sun and Mercury is in the Kuiper Belt.
[27:52.280 --> 27:57.920]  And because he says it, it is law.
[27:57.920 --> 28:01.240]  And if Al Gore says he invented the internet, it's true.
[28:01.240 --> 28:06.200]  And if Obama says it's racist to not turn your guns in and that the NRA was found about
[28:06.200 --> 28:09.360]  the Klan, even if it's the opposite, it doesn't matter.
[28:09.360 --> 28:14.560]  It doesn't matter if you built your small business, he says you didn't build it.
[28:14.560 --> 28:17.400]  It doesn't matter if increasing the debt increases the debt.
[28:17.400 --> 28:19.680]  He says increasing the debt limit doesn't increase it.
[28:19.680 --> 28:24.360]  It doesn't matter if there's $5,000 fines for business owners this year that don't get
[28:24.360 --> 28:26.480]  or make their employees get insurance.
[28:26.480 --> 28:29.560]  They'll just say it doesn't exist as the taxes come due.
[28:29.560 --> 28:36.200]  They will hit you and hit you hard and never stop because you love it and you beg for it
[28:36.200 --> 28:39.560]  and you want it.
[28:39.560 --> 28:44.840]  Because people love being unconscious jellyfish that aren't awake because you watch television
[28:44.840 --> 28:45.840]  all day.
[28:45.840 --> 28:47.640]  You play video games all day.
[28:47.640 --> 28:49.400]  People smoke dope all day.
[28:49.400 --> 28:55.120]  They get drunk all day and they have no idea what planet they're even on.
[28:55.120 --> 29:02.640]  We are going to become gods, period, if you don't like it, get off.
[29:02.640 --> 29:03.640]  You don't have to contribute.
[29:03.640 --> 29:04.640]  You don't have to participate.
[29:04.640 --> 29:14.760]  But if you're going to interfere with me becoming God, I'm going to have big trouble
[29:14.760 --> 29:16.360]  that will help warfare.
[29:16.360 --> 29:23.040]  It really hit me last time I said this every day but I was driving home at night, taking
[29:23.040 --> 29:25.520]  my children to see a movie.
[29:25.520 --> 29:26.520]  And it really hit me.
[29:26.520 --> 29:31.320]  Man, I'm on a planet in deep space with technocrats manipulating everything, openly saying they
[29:31.320 --> 29:32.320]  are.
[29:32.320 --> 29:33.920]  They believe they're going to be gods and merged with machines.
[29:33.920 --> 29:39.480]  And the general public's running around worried about what Hannah Montana or Miley Cyrus is
[29:39.480 --> 29:42.280]  doing sticking her yellow tongue out.
[29:42.280 --> 29:46.320]  It looks like it's put up a... I don't even know what to say.
[29:46.320 --> 29:49.400]  It's like a dead animal.
[29:49.400 --> 29:56.320]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:56.320 --> 30:05.120]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about
[30:05.120 --> 30:06.760]  a potential for hood situation?
[30:06.760 --> 30:10.040]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[30:10.040 --> 30:11.040]  Here we go, folks.
[30:11.040 --> 30:12.040]  I'm being assigned to...
[30:12.040 --> 30:16.240]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films or the nightly news, info
[30:16.240 --> 30:18.200]  wars is the tip of the spear.
[30:18.200 --> 30:21.720]  Is this another false-flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeland
[30:21.720 --> 30:24.320]  security by sticking the hands down on the guns on the streets?
[30:24.320 --> 30:28.280]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[30:28.280 --> 30:31.320]  And that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[30:31.320 --> 30:37.760]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against
[30:37.760 --> 30:39.640]  the so-called rebels.
[30:39.640 --> 30:43.120]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth.
[30:43.120 --> 30:48.680]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv

[31:00.320 --> 31:01.520]  I don't know what it is.
[31:01.520 --> 31:03.360]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[31:03.360 --> 31:07.440]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[31:07.440 --> 31:08.840]  It's like I don't even exist.
[31:08.840 --> 31:11.080]  Oh, Betty, that's just awful.
[31:11.080 --> 31:15.360]  Does this seem familiar? If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[31:15.360 --> 31:20.600]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminator water supplies.
[31:20.600 --> 31:25.560]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[31:25.560 --> 31:28.320]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[31:28.320 --> 31:29.320]  Look it up.
[31:29.320 --> 31:33.920]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population
[31:33.920 --> 31:35.800]  crisis is soon to follow.

[32:00.000 --> 32:04.200]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[32:04.200 --> 32:08.640]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[32:08.640 --> 32:12.240]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[32:12.240 --> 32:15.200]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[32:15.200 --> 32:19.080]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[32:19.080 --> 32:22.760]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[32:22.760 --> 32:26.760]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[32:26.760 --> 32:31.320]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[32:31.320 --> 32:36.560]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[32:36.560 --> 32:40.760]  All right, it is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in breads, it's in toothpaste.
[32:40.760 --> 32:43.800]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[32:43.800 --> 32:45.320]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[32:45.320 --> 32:46.720]  It's time to take action.
[32:46.720 --> 32:48.720]  It's time to filter our water.

[33:00.040 --> 33:06.520]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[33:06.520 --> 33:15.840]  Homeland Security begins with hometown security.
[33:15.840 --> 33:22.200]  It seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets, which may make scarring particularly
[33:22.200 --> 33:29.200]  difficult even with this year's rule changes to recap those revisions.
[33:29.200 --> 33:36.560]  Our citizens are still worth 10 points more than men at all age brackets, but teenagers
[33:36.560 --> 33:43.640]  now rack up 40 points and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points.
[33:43.640 --> 33:53.640]  The big score, anyone, any sex over 75 years old has been up to 100 points.
[33:53.640 --> 34:04.280]  As always, how fast you move determines how long you live.
[34:04.280 --> 34:13.200]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[34:13.200 --> 34:17.280]  And dovetailing with that intro, if you just joined us and are watching on television you
[34:17.280 --> 34:25.440]  see the articles that are up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, TSA to purchase 24 million
[34:25.440 --> 34:29.440]  rounds of duty ammunition for you and your family.
[34:29.440 --> 34:35.160]  U.S. Special Forces with foreign troops practice invading Tampa to quote, fight extremists
[34:35.160 --> 34:41.840]  and announcing on loudspeakers the three of the news that this is not an invasion by the
[34:41.840 --> 34:44.560]  New World Order.
[34:44.560 --> 34:52.360]  With that just dandy and New York City's announcing drones and microphones to watch you and listen
[34:52.360 --> 34:53.360]  to you.
[34:53.360 --> 34:57.160]  That's a New York Daily News.
[34:57.160 --> 35:01.560]  Remember just two, three years ago Alex Jones was insane.
[35:01.560 --> 35:05.720]  There was no plan to have drones watching you in the skies.
[35:05.720 --> 35:10.160]  It's crazy even though it was in all the Pentagon documents that they would have armored vehicles
[35:10.160 --> 35:15.800]  deployed everywhere, drones, attack drones, and now they're at South by Southwest this
[35:15.800 --> 35:21.640]  year on the news, we played it here, they have drones with shotguns and tear gas and
[35:21.640 --> 35:26.240]  face scanners to go and chase people down the street and attack them.
[35:26.240 --> 35:32.300]  With your digital photo from the DMV loaded lovingly into the robot flying around scanning
[35:32.300 --> 35:35.800]  looking for you, Hunter's Seeker Robots.
[35:35.800 --> 35:41.760]  Oh, and driverless cars are coming to Europe next year and they're going to tax everyone
[35:41.760 --> 35:47.680]  by the mile and they're already saying, oh, all the cars for about a decade have a tracker
[35:47.680 --> 35:53.320]  box in them with a live wire, with a cell phone package, we're going to tax you by the
[35:53.320 --> 35:57.880]  mile and it turns out driverless cars are safer than humans, we're not going to let
[35:57.880 --> 36:01.560]  humans drive soon.
[36:01.560 --> 36:07.600]  Oh, and Google is going to tie in along with the NSA and Microsoft and Apple to all the
[36:07.600 --> 36:12.280]  new appliances like the CIA director said two years ago and they're going to track everything
[36:12.280 --> 36:17.440]  you do and watch you in live time and old people if they get Medicare or Medicaid or
[36:17.440 --> 36:23.440]  Social Security will now have to have smart grids in their homes, their subsidized housing
[36:23.440 --> 36:27.320]  that watch when they go to the toilet and report everything they're doing and sensors
[36:27.320 --> 36:32.640]  in the toilet give, you know, readings if they're sick or anything for their safety
[36:32.640 --> 36:43.640]  of course, oh, it's also liberal, so you want to be slaves, you've got it and Adon Salazar
[36:43.640 --> 36:48.880]  is working on an article, I saw this last week, I was at the gym at the one time I
[36:48.880 --> 36:57.480]  see mainstream television and they had MSNBC on and they, of course, you know, that's the
[36:57.480 --> 37:03.160]  where I would see it and they have morning after pill ad with a woman getting them off
[37:03.160 --> 37:06.920]  a store shelf.
[37:06.920 --> 37:12.600]  Now I guess in reality, they're behind the counter but in the ad I saw, we're going
[37:12.600 --> 37:17.280]  to see if you can find it on YouTube guys, they're getting it off the shelf so the idea
[37:17.280 --> 37:22.440]  is this is no big deal, this is safe, it's like a thing of butter or, you know, a can
[37:22.440 --> 37:30.440]  of soda water or, you know, a slice of beef, a rutabaga, an onion, you just throw it in
[37:30.440 --> 37:38.560]  your basket but you can get it right off Amazon, plan B, one step emergency contraceptive must
[37:38.560 --> 37:44.440]  be 17 or over to purchase without a prescription, oh, but if you get a prescription I guess
[37:44.440 --> 37:49.280]  or you show your ID and you're 17 you can get it and what they don't tell you is this
[37:49.280 --> 37:56.240]  is basically the morning after pill that killed so many people, I mean it's really poisonous,
[37:56.240 --> 38:03.360]  it's poison and they just act like oh, it's wonderful, safe and effective, yeah, they
[38:03.360 --> 38:11.840]  found the ad, that's not the one I saw but, oh, listen to the music, yeah, let's start
[38:11.840 --> 38:23.120]  it over, let's start it over since you found it, so this is plan B, one step and it says
[38:23.120 --> 38:30.320]  again, we're going to back it up because I can start at the beginning, I'm going to
[38:30.320 --> 38:34.480]  play it from the beginning so I can read what it says, it's a cartoon of all these
[38:34.480 --> 38:43.000]  happy people, you know, she's laying in bed, she looks over and the condom split, sperm
[38:43.000 --> 38:49.320]  swim by, she's on a bus, a baby's crying, ooh, babies are gross, I'm not ready for that
[38:49.320 --> 38:55.680]  one, she says, she goes to the chemist, it's a nice trendy word for the drug store and
[38:55.680 --> 39:00.600]  she gets the over the counter drug, I guess there's a bunch of brand names of it, this
[39:00.600 --> 39:07.960]  is a different one and they call it the one step and that's out of England, I guess over
[39:07.960 --> 39:15.320]  here it's called plan B, so we're going to try to find the plan B ad and see if we have
[39:15.320 --> 39:19.520]  that, it's probably on the drug website is where we'll find it if it's not on YouTube
[39:19.520 --> 39:26.560]  yet but the point is the guys are working on a report on that, just the total culture
[39:26.560 --> 39:33.520]  of death and in so many sitcoms, dramas, ads you name it, they show a baby crying and it's
[39:33.520 --> 39:40.040]  like the most horrible thing on earth, they're gross, they're terrible, they're disempowering,
[39:40.040 --> 39:45.480]  it'll ruin your life and sometimes I'll be at a resort or something with my children
[39:45.480 --> 39:53.240]  on vacation and it'll be an empty pool and it's always when it's an empty pool and there'll
[39:53.240 --> 39:56.520]  be some trendies out there sitting in the hot tub or whatever and I'll come out with
[39:56.520 --> 40:01.080]  my children who jump in and swim around and laugh and giggle and I've actually seen trendies
[40:01.080 --> 40:07.680]  go and get up and leave like it was so upsetting to see children, well if that's the way you
[40:07.680 --> 40:15.320]  think go to a hotel that doesn't allow children, they have those but the truth is these people
[40:15.320 --> 40:20.360]  will be 45, these 30 year old trendies wishing they had children and then they'll have kids
[40:20.360 --> 40:24.800]  too late and they'll be autistic unfortunately because all the toxins build up in the body
[40:24.800 --> 40:31.520]  and I'm not knocking folks that don't want kids but don't demonize me because I like
[40:31.520 --> 40:37.040]  children and the minute you have children, your brain switches on, you go to the next
[40:37.040 --> 40:44.040]  level but folks do that as well with dogs and pets they have, I mean the point is we're
[40:44.040 --> 40:48.240]  very nurturative but when you have children you start thinking about the world in an entirely
[40:48.240 --> 40:54.840]  different way and this is about a human commitment having children and believing in humanity
[40:54.840 --> 40:58.600]  and believing in life and even though the world's a terrible place in many ways it's
[40:58.600 --> 41:03.240]  also a beautiful wondrous place and we're doubling down against the tyranny and saying
[41:03.240 --> 41:08.080]  we're going to have children, we're going to survive and thrive, we're going to raise
[41:08.080 --> 41:13.760]  them up right to be aware of how the world really works, that's the idea but you see
[41:13.760 --> 41:18.760]  these ads about she's laying in bed, there's this gross looking guy sleeping, she's had
[41:18.760 --> 41:26.880]  sex with him, she looks disgusted at the man, she's on a bus, she's poor, there's babies
[41:26.880 --> 41:33.080]  crying, she doesn't want any part of this, she takes this pill, everything's wonderful,
[41:33.080 --> 41:37.360]  everything is awesome, everything is super when you're part of the team as the Lego movie
[41:37.360 --> 41:41.480]  theme says which reminds me of all the globalist propaganda.
[41:41.480 --> 41:46.200]  The truth is you're poor because of deindustrialization, you're poor because they broke up the family
[41:46.200 --> 41:55.680]  and made all the women work, you're poor because they have set up an anti-human system where
[41:55.680 --> 42:05.040]  we're culturally bankrupted and now you don't have a family, now everyone is totally atomized
[42:05.040 --> 42:11.720]  and separate from each other and people aren't honorable, they don't care about each other,
[42:11.720 --> 42:16.200]  on average that buy into the fake liberal trendy political correctness, they're totally
[42:16.200 --> 42:20.600]  empty, they're totally rudderless and they don't know why they're so unhappy because
[42:20.600 --> 42:26.120]  they buy into whatever the system says so they just double and triple down on the system,
[42:26.120 --> 42:39.800]  they may be fulfilled, I'm gonna steal a silver stallion without a mark on his silky
[42:39.800 --> 42:49.400]  hide and teach him he can trust me like a brother and one day we'll saddle up and ride
[42:49.400 --> 42:56.360]  and we're gonna ride we're gonna ride ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds with a
[42:56.360 --> 43:03.360]  devil close behind we're gonna ride I want to get that high woman song and play it from
[43:03.360 --> 43:08.640]  the start as bumper music because when you get down to at the end of the day whether
[43:08.640 --> 43:15.360]  it's your dog or your horse or your husband or your wife or your children in mammal relationships
[43:15.360 --> 43:20.680]  it's all about trust and you can see a dog when it looks at you with trust or a horse
[43:20.680 --> 43:25.800]  that knows you and looks at you with trust or a bird you feed on your back porch that
[43:25.800 --> 43:32.600]  looks at you with trust and that's all there is in this world is trust and being honorable
[43:32.600 --> 43:37.200]  and people taking themselves seriously and taking each other seriously and having some
[43:37.200 --> 43:41.640]  basic respect and Lord knows I'm not perfect and I'm not respectful all the time but I
[43:41.640 --> 43:46.000]  realize that's what it's all about and the globalists don't respect us and they don't
[43:46.000 --> 43:54.920]  respect themselves and they have such disdain for the public that at Bilderberg on record
[43:54.920 --> 43:59.520]  you're not allowed to look at them in the eyes if you're a bartender or a waiter or
[43:59.520 --> 44:09.360]  a event planner or a manager or anybody hey Alex yes I once served the Queen mom of England
[44:09.360 --> 44:15.720]  what was that like scum exactly as you describe it I wasn't allowed to look her in the eye
[44:15.720 --> 44:20.600]  I was paid a nice $300 not to do that word speak to her tell me that story because you've
[44:20.600 --> 44:24.200]  mentioned it before but I never got the full story yeah I'm I know you also have a degree
[44:24.200 --> 44:28.400]  as a chef I've worked some of the nicest restaurants in Austin before you went to work again back
[44:28.400 --> 44:34.920]  in the media for was it for K.I. or KVUE KXN and K.I. that's right yeah but I was working
[44:34.920 --> 44:40.200]  at Keenland in Kentucky at the racetrack and they oh yeah she she lives about a month out
[44:40.200 --> 44:46.120]  of the year there she's buys her horses there yeah it's very beautiful she grabbed a select
[44:46.120 --> 44:50.960]  group of us and we went up there and we were told not to look at her if she did speak to
[44:50.960 --> 44:57.560]  us not to speak back and that went for her whole posse as well and we follow the rules
[44:57.560 --> 45:05.000]  but that's the way they do it did she need a groom of the stool we can talk about that
[45:05.000 --> 45:12.040]  later I would invite the Queen of England to come to my house and wipe my ass she'd
[45:12.040 --> 45:17.840]  be lucky to do that she would Alex all right folks I don't mean to use crude language but
[45:17.840 --> 45:29.640]  it's done on purpose every once in a while has some aplomb to it now the Queen mom that
[45:29.640 --> 45:35.040]  was for she killed over or the actual Queenie the Queen mom or she killed over yeah you
[45:35.040 --> 45:40.280]  know it came out that she daily got the blood of small children that was quote donated as
[45:40.280 --> 45:45.480]  if the children had parental consent I mean the children don't have free will their parents
[45:45.480 --> 45:50.360]  literally vampire to mount to her to have child blood almost on a daily basis pumped
[45:50.360 --> 45:55.800]  into her fetid arteries and veins we think of that I was all Canadian it was good clean
[45:55.800 --> 46:02.560]  Canadian children's blood oh you do know about that story oh yeah John Bowne you're John
[46:02.560 --> 46:06.960]  Bowne comes from a journalist family his dad work for AP a bunch of the folks got a Peabody
[46:06.960 --> 46:11.200]  Award for journalism and John has unsyndicated radio and news and then when to being a chef
[46:11.200 --> 46:15.480]  for a while and back in the media and he's here and he does a great job John how dare
[46:15.480 --> 46:20.800]  you not want to worship your Queen your your King your Lord your Savior I worship the King
[46:20.800 --> 46:26.840]  of Rock and Roll Jimi Hendrix well that's a little better something tells me that the
[46:26.840 --> 46:32.000]  known Nazi Prince Philip who when he sees black people literally starts saying shouldn't
[46:32.000 --> 46:38.840]  you be out with a spear and a bone for your nose literally if you look that up I don't
[46:38.840 --> 46:43.480]  think he likes Jimi Hendrix well he called Putin a Nazi right well that's his son did
[46:43.480 --> 46:49.080]  that well exactly no no no if you're George Soros and a real Nazi you call people Nazis
[46:49.080 --> 46:54.280]  if you're real Nazis like the German royal family of England you call other people Nazis
[46:54.280 --> 46:58.240]  that actually are the children of the people that defeated the Nazis see yeah I've got
[46:58.240 --> 47:02.480]  a fear I'm starting to get it figured out I think eventually we'll all just walk backwards
[47:02.480 --> 47:07.080]  yeah one of my grandfathers was a fighter pilot the other would be 17s and so because they
[47:07.080 --> 47:13.320]  were fought the Nazis then I am a Nazi according to MSNBC you understand how that works yeah
[47:13.320 --> 47:17.920]  so the Russians fought the Nazis they're now the Nazis according to the Nazis yeah are you
[47:17.920 --> 47:24.160]  right yeah my so my great grandpa fought in World War one my great my grandpa fought
[47:24.160 --> 47:29.360]  in World War two he fought the Nazis so what you're saying is I'm a Nazi you're a Nazi

[47:35.040 --> 47:43.080]  Day good good while they literally shovel the the veterans into an incinerator all hail
[47:43.080 --> 47:47.560]  Arnold Schwarzenegger again who told Rolling Stone he admires Hitler wants to be a dictator
[47:47.560 --> 47:52.680]  and reportedly dresses up in SS uniforms and hands out records with Hitler's speeches
[47:52.680 --> 48:01.920]  on them rolling stone again has the interview with him saying that but but that that's okay
[48:01.920 --> 48:08.440]  you understand is that cool with you John I'm gonna work on it well he's anti gun pro
[48:08.440 --> 48:16.800]  open border show it Republicans loving to you understand yeah he he just works the angle
[48:16.800 --> 48:21.960]  right well he just totally doesn't care about anybody but himself and absolutely turns us
[48:21.960 --> 48:26.280]  back on his friends of 20 30 years I know folks that knows Schwarzenegger well people
[48:26.280 --> 48:30.920]  that smoke pot with him use drugs with him for 20 30 years you know whole nine yards

[49:11.200 --> 49:16.880]  that are taxpayer funded all over the world who are total eugenicist and then also worshiping
[49:16.880 --> 49:22.200]  Angelina Joe Lee and they're merging Hollywood with the political class and all the red carpets
[49:22.200 --> 49:27.040]  in the crowd it is a sick joke we should reject all of these people and when you see somebody
[49:27.040 --> 49:31.800]  reading people magazine and caring about all the mindless hype explain to them that it's
[49:31.800 --> 49:38.200]  literally mind control to blind them from the fact that they are on a deep space orbiting
[49:38.200 --> 49:45.160]  planetoid in the middle of total wonderment total creation and just amazing times and
[49:45.160 --> 49:52.320]  that we are exposing the evil because there's so much good that needs to be absolutely protected
[49:52.320 --> 50:00.840]  kissed sugar on top double sugar on top that's what we're saying now before I go any further

[54:54.560 --> 54:57.560]  ride like the one-eyed jack the diamond
[54:57.560 --> 54:59.560]  the devil's close behind
[54:59.560 --> 55:01.560]  we're gonna ride
[55:01.560 --> 55:03.560]  silver stallion right there
[55:03.560 --> 55:08.560]  Waylon Jennings, Chris Christoferson, Willi Nelson and the immortal Johnny Cash
[55:08.560 --> 55:14.560]  one of their songs is I'm gonna live forever I'm gonna cross that river
[55:14.560 --> 55:19.560]  in a reckless wall
[55:19.560 --> 55:23.560]  razor blades and dice in her eyes
[55:23.560 --> 55:25.560]  nothing better than a reckless woman
[55:25.560 --> 55:32.560]  just a touch of sadness in her face
[55:32.560 --> 55:38.560]  thunder and lightning in her thighs
[55:38.560 --> 55:42.560]  and we're gonna ride
[55:42.560 --> 55:47.560]  ride like the one-eyed jack of diamonds
[55:47.560 --> 55:50.560]  ride like the one-eyed jack the diamond
[55:50.560 --> 55:52.560]  with the devil's close behind
[55:52.560 --> 55:54.560]  we're gonna ride
[55:54.560 --> 55:58.560]  that's all there is in this world is to find that silver stallion
[55:58.560 --> 56:01.560]  without a mark upon his silky hide
[56:01.560 --> 56:04.560]  and teach him he can trust you like a brother
[56:04.560 --> 56:07.560]  one day you're gonna saddle up and ride
[56:07.560 --> 56:12.560]  and that's about your own self becoming an honorable good man
[56:12.560 --> 56:15.560]  building yourself into someone who is streetwise
[56:15.560 --> 56:18.560]  and good and actually understands how people work
[56:18.560 --> 56:21.560]  and wants to build others up and build yourself up
[56:21.560 --> 56:23.560]  and then one day you'll become a man
[56:23.560 --> 56:27.560]  and you can saddle up and ride
[56:27.560 --> 56:30.560]  with the woman the stallion and the wind
[56:30.560 --> 56:33.560]  and the sun is gonna burn into a cinder
[56:33.560 --> 56:35.560]  before we pass this way again
[56:35.560 --> 56:37.560]  but we're gonna ride
[56:37.560 --> 56:39.560]  we're gonna ride
[56:39.560 --> 56:41.560]  like the one-eyed jack of diamonds
[56:41.560 --> 56:43.560]  with the devil close behind
[56:43.560 --> 56:44.560]  we're gonna ride
[56:44.560 --> 56:46.560]  the devil wants to hold you back
[56:46.560 --> 56:48.560]  the devil wants to control your life
[56:48.560 --> 56:50.560]  the devil wants to take your free will
[56:50.560 --> 56:52.560]  even if the devil didn't exist
[56:52.560 --> 56:56.560]  the archetype of the devil does
[56:56.560 --> 56:58.560]  the devil doesn't want you to have guns
[56:58.560 --> 56:59.560]  and know how to use them
[56:59.560 --> 57:05.560]  the devil wants to be the one with the guns
[57:05.560 --> 57:08.560]  because political power goes out of the barrel of a gun
[57:08.560 --> 57:14.560]  and the control freaks desire power above all else
[57:14.560 --> 57:18.560]  TSA to purchase 24 million rounds of duty ammunition
[57:18.560 --> 57:22.560]  feds preparing to arm TSA workers, Paul Watson asked
[57:22.560 --> 57:24.560]  do fish swim in the sea
[57:24.560 --> 57:27.560]  and then the article goes on to say they're calling for arming
[57:27.560 --> 57:29.560]  they're already arming the street with viper teams
[57:29.560 --> 57:30.560]  now they want to be armed
[57:30.560 --> 57:32.560]  and their union calls to be armed
[57:32.560 --> 57:34.560]  and can you think of how horrible that's gonna be
[57:34.560 --> 57:36.560]  the police are already allowed to execute people
[57:36.560 --> 57:38.560]  anywhere they want in the country now
[57:38.560 --> 57:40.560]  some lawyer, some law student says hey
[57:40.560 --> 57:42.560]  why are you trying to search for a car without a warrant
[57:42.560 --> 57:44.560]  so the cops grab him, spread his legs
[57:44.560 --> 57:46.560]  and ram their knees into his crotch
[57:46.560 --> 57:48.560]  till his testicles have to be removed
[57:48.560 --> 57:53.560]  and the police hail it in Albuquerque
[57:53.560 --> 57:55.560]  so it's just part of the total preparation
[57:55.560 --> 57:57.560]  for war with the people
[57:57.560 --> 57:59.560]  and again that dovetails with U.S. Special Forces
[57:59.560 --> 58:01.560]  foreign troops practicing invading Tampa
[58:01.560 --> 58:02.560]  we got Lord Moncton coming up
[58:02.560 --> 58:04.560]  I'm gonna play these videos, get into all of it
[58:04.560 --> 58:06.560]  I haven't gotten to J. Rockefeller yet
[58:06.560 --> 58:08.560]  I mentioned it but we'll play that audio
[58:08.560 --> 58:10.560]  because it dovetails with the McCarthyism
[58:10.560 --> 58:12.560]  beyond McCarthy because McCarthy was going to have
[58:12.560 --> 58:14.560]  something real though I didn't agree with his tactics
[58:14.560 --> 58:16.560]  he's been proven right since the Soviet files
[58:16.560 --> 58:18.560]  were declassified
[58:18.560 --> 58:23.560]  this new ultra-Soviet style true McCarthyism
[58:23.560 --> 58:25.560]  Ching, you're racist if you don't like Obamacare
[58:25.560 --> 58:27.560]  you're a hate-monger and need to be arrested
[58:27.560 --> 58:29.560]  if you don't believe in global warming
[58:29.560 --> 58:33.560]  and then it's man-made and paying Lord Rothschild money
[58:33.560 --> 58:36.560]  we'll be right back with the second hour
[58:36.560 --> 58:57.560]  on this worldwide Thursday edition
[59:06.560 --> 59:09.560]  90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[59:09.560 --> 59:10.560]  within their homes
[59:10.560 --> 59:12.560]  there are more than 42 million smokers
[59:12.560 --> 59:13.560]  in the United States
[59:13.560 --> 59:15.560]  well over a thousand types of mold in mildew
[59:15.560 --> 59:17.560]  linked to numerous conditions
[59:17.560 --> 59:19.560]  and don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans
[59:19.560 --> 59:21.560]  live with pets they're allergic to as well
[59:21.560 --> 59:23.560]  when I began to research these statistics
[59:23.560 --> 59:25.560]  it was clear to me it was time to start
[59:25.560 --> 59:28.560]  cleansing my lungs in order to combat
[59:28.560 --> 59:30.560]  the toxic environment that we cannot escape
[59:30.560 --> 59:32.560]  but that we can fight back against
[59:32.560 --> 59:34.560]  made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[59:34.560 --> 59:36.560]  and manufactured in the USA
[59:36.560 --> 59:38.560]  the new Info Wars Life Lung Cleans is here
[59:38.560 --> 59:40.560]  in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[59:40.560 --> 59:42.560]  with you throughout any toxic environment
[59:42.560 --> 59:45.560]  now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com
[59:45.560 --> 01:00:05.560]  or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.560]  Big Brother
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.560]  mainstream media
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.560]  government cover-ups
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.560]  you want answers?
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.560]  well so does he
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.560]  Alex Jones
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.560]  on the GCN Radio Network
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.560]  and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.560]  Alex Jones
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.560]  Lord Mongeon will be joining us
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.560]  coming up in the next segment
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.560]  having any of them on probably 4 or 5 months
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.560]  huge news on a new Climate Gate document
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:38.560]  they've been suppressing
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.560]  total fraud
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.560]  their plan to persecute anyone that denies
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.560]  what they're up to
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.560]  and again that dovetails
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.560]  I'll play this again for him
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.560]  and I want to play a clip here
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.560]  of Senator Jay Rockefeller
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.560]  maybe we should get the clip of him saying
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.560]  the internet should never have been invented
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.560]  by Al Gore of course
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.560]  and other such fallacies
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:00.560]  but he now says it's racist
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.560]  if you don't like Obamacare
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.560]  a lot of people don't like it
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.560]  are racist
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:07.560]  and even though most polls show it
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.560]  over 80% negative now
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.560]  as people learn how bad it is
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.560]  Bill Press on MSNBC
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.560]  all of them going it's the law
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:16.560]  it's good
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.560]  and the racism will be battled
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.560]  and the conspiracy theorist
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.560]  about rationing of care and death panels
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.560]  of the VA
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.560]  that's going to be stopped as well
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.560]  racist conspiracy theorist
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.560]  and then Press just acts real confident
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.560]  and the average Democratic cult member
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.560]  just goes oh
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.560]  we're the smart ones
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.560]  we're not the right wingers
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.560]  you people are about as liberal
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.560]  as Hitler
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.560]  you people are the opposite of liberals
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.560]  Thomas Jefferson as I say is a liberal
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:53.560]  you my friend are not a liberal
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.560]  I want to be clear about that
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.560]  and I'm just sick of these people
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.560]  parading around with their low IQs
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.560]  with their cultural Marxism
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.560]  flaunting it in our face
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.560]  that they're tough and strong
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.560]  and superior because they've adopted
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.560]  the establishment poison vomit
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.560]  and then they eat the vomit
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.560]  and then spray the vomit on us
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.560]  and we're supposed to lap it up and relish it
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.560]  like it's mother's ambrosia
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.560]  no
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.560]  you people are gibbering scum
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.560]  on confidence trips because you're so empty
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.560]  your narcissistic turds
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.560]  I don't want to be around you
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.560]  I don't want to look at you
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.560]  and I sure don't want you running my life
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.560]  get out of my way
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.560]  filth
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.560]  all of you that say our kids belong to you
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.560]  that's like they're
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.560]  birds will have a certain sound
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.560]  like a whipper wheel will go
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.560]  whipper wheel or bob white
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.560]  called a bird of bob white
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.560]  birds usually named after their call
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.560]  a lot of them are
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.560]  yours is kids belong to us
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.560]  kids belong to us
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.560]  you're our slave
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.560]  you're our slave
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.560]  you're dumb
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.560]  we're smart
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.560]  let's go ahead and go to J. Rockefeller
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.560]  the ultra fascist
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.560]  totally wicked eugenicist
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.560]  scumbag
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.560]  who thinks the public is total trash
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.560]  who sucks off taxpayer money in his tax exempt
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.560]  openly saying that
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.560]  a lot of people don't like it
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.560]  because Obama's black
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.560]  this is written by foreign banks that he partially owns
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.560]  to literally have a tax to them
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.560]  and lower the quality of care
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.560]  and put payroll taxes on poor people
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.560]  and taxes on medical devices
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.560]  and just butcher healthcare even more
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.560]  it's a fascist gang raping
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.560]  and his answer is no you're racist
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.560]  here is J. Rockefeller
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.560]  enemy of freedom
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.560]  I'll be able to dig up some emails
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.560]  that make part of the affordable care act
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.560]  that doesn't look good
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.560]  especially from people who've made up their mind
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.560]  that they don't want it to work
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.560]  because they don't like the president
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.560]  maybe he's of the wrong color
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.560]  something of that sort
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.560]  I've seen a lot of that
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.560]  and I know a lot of that to be true
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.560]  it's not something you're meant to talk about in public
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.560]  but it's something I'm talking about in public
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.560]  so people associate
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.560]  a piece of legislation
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.560]  their leader
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.560]  in the senate
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.560]  has committed
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.560]  at the beginning of the president's term
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.560]  to block every piece of legislation
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.560]  that the president puts forward
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.560]  and they have
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.560]  done that with this exception
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.560]  and a few other exceptions
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.560]  and I find that
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.560]  disingenuous behavior
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.560]  by the way

[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.560]  tyranny placement
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.560]  from 1969 on the nightly news
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.560]  tonight
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.560]  now joining us
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.560]  is lord christopher montan
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.560]  of scienceandpublicpolicy.org
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.560]  the most documented
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.560]  scientific clearinghouse out there
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.560]  for what's been proven
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.560]  to be absolutely accurate
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.560]  very conservative but very accurate
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.560]  it's much worse
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:19.560]  than he's even saying but what he puts
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.560]  is so well documented as conservative about
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.560]  the earth's been cooling for
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.560]  the last 6-7 years
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.560]  the warming stops 17-18 years ago
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.560]  they're fixing
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.560]  the documents and the research around it
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.560]  the buoys, the weather service info
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.560]  through the universities to cover that up
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.560]  he helped get the document at cup and haggon
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.560]  5 years ago that blew it wide open
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.560]  that it was a world tax that helped stop it
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.560]  he released that and he spearheaded
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.560]  and I'm not building him up
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.560]  you need to know you can be effective as well
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.560]  the best news site overall
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.560]  is climate depot
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.560]  with martin morano
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.560]  and of course drudgereport.com
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.560]  and infowars.com are always carrying their news
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.560]  on a weekly basis
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.560]  but I wanted to get lord montan on last week
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.560]  I said please get him on as soon as you can
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.560]  when there was just a flotilla
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.560]  of new
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.560]  climategate cover up information
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.560]  and new statements about let's arrest anybody
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.560]  that doesn't agree that climate change is real
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.560]  and don't want to pay carbon taxes
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.560]  and let's fire professors
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.560]  or let's remove them
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.560]  I mean it's in the US and England
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.560]  it's the new McCarthyism
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.560]  so I want to cover all the
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.560]  latest authoritarianism by the
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.560]  kleptocratic
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.560]  self-anointed
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.560]  priesthood
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.560]  of the
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.560]  french revolution style jackabins
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.560]  I like it under them because
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.560]  of the modern illuminati
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.560]  of your study history
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.560]  and then the communist movement came out of
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.560]  France and England
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.560]  this is on record mainline textbooks
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.560]  just people hear the term illuminati
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.560]  don't even know george washington wrote letters
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.560]  saying how dangerous it was trying to take over masonry
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.560]  you can read his letters the national archive online
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.560]  and so what we face
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.560]  is a group of
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.560]  of just control freak criminals
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.560]  that wanted to overthrow the existing
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.560]  order that certainly had some problems
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.560]  they got well meaning liberals
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.560]  in the thomas jefferson vein
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:13.560]  in France and in the US and England
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.560]  to go along with them so I'm going back
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.560]  to the original progenitors
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.560]  of this degeneracy
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.560]  they are not liberals
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.560]  they coaxed
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.560]  many real liberals and true progressives
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.560]  who wanted to progress scientifically
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.560]  the enlightenment and the
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.560]  renaissance
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.560]  they wanted to hijack that and create
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:35.560]  a nine day work week
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.560]  no more families
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.560]  everything you see them build
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.560]  the nightmare north korea
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.560]  the nightmare soviet union
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.560]  is a jacoban hallucination
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.560]  now i know lord bonkin is a historian
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.560]  an adventer
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.560]  margaret thatcher's top advisor and a member of her cabinet
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.560]  i know he studied history so i know
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.560]  he will probably agree with what i just said
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.560]  in an augmented but these are the little known facts
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.560]  and the reason i'm starting this interview right now
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.560]  with the source of this
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.560]  communist disease
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.560]  so that people understand communism is only
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.560]  150 year old
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.560]  carl marx engels
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.560]  manifestation of the jacobans
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.560]  we'll see if he agrees with me, i would imagine he does
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.560]  because it's history and then i want to look at their latest
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.560]  criminal activities and their
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.560]  attempt to shut us down
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.560]  and then the state of the war against human resources
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.560]  and the war on humanity
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.560]  we're winning the info war but the enemy
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.560]  has seized all the major institutions
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.560]  so how do we fight them effectively
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.560]  lord bonkin thank you so much
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.560]  for joining us
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:35.560]  where do you think this evil generates from
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.560]  historically, politically
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.560]  and do you agree with my analysis
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.560]  going back to the root of it
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.560]  in the last 210 years
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.560]  i'm going to go back further than that
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.560]  to early imperial china
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.560]  because that was the place
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.560]  where they first began
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.560]  philosophically meditating
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.560]  upon the fundamental
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.560]  divide in politics
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.560]  which is between on the one hand
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:01.560]  the totalitarians
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:03.560]  as we would call them now
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:05.560]  they call them in those days the legalists
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:07.560]  and on the other the libertarians
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.560]  that's what we would call them now
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.560]  they call them the confusions
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.560]  and so the debate between
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.560]  the legalists and the confusions has gone on
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.560]  really throughout the history
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.560]  of global government
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.560]  going all the way back to imperial china
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.560]  going back thousands of years
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.560]  and that is and will always be
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.560]  the fundamental divide
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.560]  for those who wish to control
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.560]  everything from the centre
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.560]  and those who like you and me Alex
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.560]  reckon that we can trust the people
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.560]  to decide for themselves
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.560]  how their government should be shaped
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.560]  and how it should run
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.560]  and that's why we support the US constitution
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.560]  and we don't support the attempts
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.560]  to undermine it and circumvent it
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:49.560]  by your current president
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.560]  and his cabinet
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:53.560]  and on the question of the climate
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.560]  which is just the latest manifestation
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.560]  of the totalitarian
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.560]  or legalist faction
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.560]  they have decided
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.560]  to do something which as far as I can
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.560]  tell looking back through history
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.560]  is unique
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.560]  they've decided
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.560]  and I think it's a strategic mistake
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:13.560]  on the part of the totalitarian left
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.560]  they've decided to try to politicise
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.560]  science itself
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.560]  they've decided to adopt
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.560]  a particular scientific viewpoint
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.560]  as party policy
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.560]  as the party line
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.560]  now this is very strange
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.560]  of course there have been precedents
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.560]  for scientific
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.560]  madnesses being adopted by
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:35.560]  individual nations such as
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.560]  Lysenkoism
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.560]  under Stalin
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.560]  where Lysenko
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:43.560]  who was a country agronomist
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.560]  was elevated to be
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.560]  ludicrously head of the Soviet Academy of Sciences
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.560]  and managed to kill
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.560]  20 million
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.560]  Soviet citizens over a 20 year period
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.560]  by the succession of failed harvest
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.560]  because of his mad theory
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.560]  that soaking the seeds of the
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.560]  corn in water
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.560]  over the winter rather than planting them
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.560]  to get used to the temperature
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.560]  would give you a better crop or would give you
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.560]  a failed crop after a failed crop
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.560]  and that was adopted for a time by the Soviets
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.560]  and of course eventually they realised it was mad
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.560]  and they stopped doing it
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.560]  likewise there was Hitler
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.560]  to go back to Hitler's Germany
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.560]  with a centralised full scale
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.560]  lying propaganda
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.560]  soon to be copied by the Soviets
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.560]  and now by the totalitarian left
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.560]  worldwide was to be introduced
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.560]  and there the scientific dopingness
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.560]  that they took on board was
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.560]  eugenicism
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.560]  now both of these have now been
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.560]  proven to be nonsensical
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.560]  but what's now happened is you've got
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:43.560]  a global totalitarian
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.560]  governing class realising
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.560]  for the first time that via
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:49.560]  international institutions such as
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.560]  the UN and the UN Framework
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.560]  Convention on Climate Change and the World Bank
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:55.560]  and all these
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:57.560]  different centralised organisations
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.560]  not one of which is elected
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.560]  they can draw all this together
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.560]  and centralise their power
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.560]  but they needed
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.560]  a scare story
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.560]  in order to frighten us
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.560]  and let's go back though just because I threw out
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.560]  the French Revolution that was really
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.560]  the opposite of what the American Revolution was
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.560]  in my view
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.560]  just because I'm interested in it
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:21.560]  what's your take on my statements about
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.560]  the fact that it's traced communism
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.560]  back to the French Revolution
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.560]  and this attempt
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.560]  it goes back much further than that
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.560]  it is a very very old and very very tired
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.560]  no I know it even goes back to Plato
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.560]  Plato even talked about
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.560]  some of these ideas and debated them back and forth
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.560]  I understand that but specifically
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.560]  what is your take on the French Revolution
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.560]  I mean of course that too
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.560]  of this notion of putting the collective
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.560]  before the individual
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.560]  and of course they didn't believe
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.560]  for a moment in liberty or equality
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.560]  or fraternity
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.560]  they believed in replacing one governing class
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:57.560]  which was relatively competent
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.560]  with another that wasn't
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.560]  and which soon collapsed in favour of
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.560]  a sort of brief and flashy attempt at empire
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.560]  but whereupon the whole of Europe
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.560]  ganged up against this nonsense
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.560]  and brought Napoleon down
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.560]  so it was a pretty dramatic failure
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.560]  at the French Revolution
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.560]  but they're still terribly proud of it
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.560]  they ought to be ashamed of it
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.560]  and that's why I brought it up because it failed
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.560]  and every major tyranny ends up failing
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.560]  the question is with all the new high tech ingredients
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.560]  and more fancy propaganda
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.560]  at the technocrats hands
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.560]  what does your gut historically tell you Lord Mocken
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.560]  who I know is a scholar
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.560]  and also a journalist
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.560]  how does your gut tell you this is going to end
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.560]  how do you see it playing out
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.560]  the new dimension here
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:41.560]  the globalisation
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.560]  of totalitarian group thing
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.560]  is an immensely serious problem
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.560]  because those who love freedom
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.560]  are by instinct
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:51.560]  independent minded
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.560]  you know this from the people you interviewed
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.560]  we all think in our own way
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.560]  we talk in our own way
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.560]  we don't follow the party line
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.560]  of any party really
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.560]  and this gives the left
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.560]  the legalists, the totalitarians
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.560]  a permanent political advantage
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.560]  which actively becomes dangerous
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.560]  when government starts to become
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.560]  global
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.560]  so if we go back only as far
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.560]  as the Jacobins and the French Revolution
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.560]  and you come forward from there
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.560]  you see the gradual
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.560]  global dissemination
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.560]  of the idea
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.560]  that we should salute
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.560]  and obey our masters
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.560]  in the governing class
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.560]  a thing which the aristocrats
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.560]  in Britain never expected or demanded
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.560]  is now expected
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.560]  and demanded by the totalitarian left
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.560]  and with increasing arrogance
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.560]  for instance
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.560]  Professor Lenard Bengelsson
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:47.560]  one of the most eminent scientists
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.560]  in the world, a physicist
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.560]  and he was the head
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.560]  of the Max Planck Institute in Germany
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.560]  which is Europe's foremost scientific institution
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.560]  and not so long ago
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.560]  having safely retired
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.560]  because he couldn't have dared to do this
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:05.560]  and intolerant and unacademically
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.560]  free scientific world
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.560]  he decided to join the policy
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.560]  of my good friend Nigel Lawson's
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.560]  Global Warming Policy Foundation
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.560]  which is a think tank in the United Kingdom
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.560]  the only one devoted
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:19.560]  to giving people the other side of the story
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.560]  first on the economics and now
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.560]  also increasingly on the science
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.560]  and of course it was an enormous coup
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.560]  for the Global Warming Policy Foundation
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.560]  to have persuaded
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.560]  somebody as eminent as Professor
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.560]  Professor Bengelsson to join
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.560]  the academic advisory board
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.560]  of the Global Warming Policy Foundation
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.560]  so he joined it within 10 days
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.560]  he had resigned again
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:43.560]  and in his letter of resignation
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.560]  he said he had been so unmassively
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.560]  bullied and pilloried
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:49.560]  and pestered with emails and telephone calls
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.560]  and hate mail
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.560]  from chiefly from the United States
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:55.560]  from scientists in the United States
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.560]  that he no longer dared
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.560]  to continue for the sake
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:01.560]  of his safety and that of his family
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.560]  to remain
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.560]  as a member of the board of the institution
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.560]  the global warmest are a cult
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.560]  they're not just a cult
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.560]  they are a vicious tyranny
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.560]  and they're trying to impose
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:15.560]  a narrow
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:17.560]  and as we now know
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.560]  scientifically nonsensical
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.560]  viewpoint on the world
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.560]  there has now been according to
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.560]  one of the satellite data sets
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.560]  no global warming at all
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:29.560]  17 years and 9 months
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:31.560]  a completely flat
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.560]  trend
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:35.560]  absolutely no movement at all
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.560]  17 years 9 months
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.560]  now here's the thing Alex
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.560]  in how many newspapers
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:43.560]  have you seen that fact or anything like it
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:45.560]  recently reported
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.560]  really nowhere in fact every summer
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.560]  they point satellites at the northern
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.560]  and southern hemispheres respectively
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.560]  and say they're melting forever
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:55.560]  knowing full well they always shrink in the summer
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:57.560]  right and you see pictures
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.560]  of water pouring off the glaciers
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.560]  and they say this is because of global warming
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.560]  no it's because it's summertime
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.560]  get used to it's been happening for billions
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.560]  of years but that is
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.560]  how absurd it's now become
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.560]  and the news media
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.560]  the beef I have with them
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.560]  is not so much that most
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.560]  of them are now in this
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.560]  totalitarian class and in this
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.560]  mindset but
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.560]  that they will not
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:25.560]  ever print or reveal
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.560]  any fact
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.560]  however obviously central
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.560]  to the debate and important to it
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.560]  if in any way that fact
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.560]  casts doubt upon the party line
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.560]  well sure there's a new climate gate for those that don't know
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:39.560]  that just broke in the last few weeks
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.560]  tell folks about that
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.560]  we have new examples of them saying
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.560]  we've got to hide the decline
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.560]  we've got to not let this data come out
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.560]  we can't have this paper published
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.560]  oh they're doing this all the time
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.560]  it's a continuous process it began
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:55.560]  years ago when
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.560]  the climate gate emails came out
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:59.560]  it's worth just recalling what happened then
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.560]  because
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.560]  somebody at the University of East India
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.560]  who had access to it's servers
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.560]  managed to start
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.560]  reading the emails between
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:11.560]  the various scientists around the world
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:13.560]  that are whipping up this scare
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.560]  Professor Phil Jones
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.560]  was right at the centre
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.560]  of this small group
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.560]  of scientists who are running this scare
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:23.560]  he is one of the Michael Mann
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.560]  at the University of Virginia then at Penn State
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.560]  various others Kevin Trenberth
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.560]  in Colorado, Ben Sancho
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.560]  at Lawrence Livermore
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.560]  there's only half a dozen of them really
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.560]  these were the people all of them
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.560]  essentially communists in their political outlook
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.560]  all of them determined
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.560]  to centralise political
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:43.560]  and scientific power in their own hands
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.560]  as far as...
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.560]  and as you said Lord Monckon they relish their collective power
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.560]  even though individually
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.560]  they can hardly tie their shoe laces and I'm serious
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.560]  well that's right if you look at the science they produce
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.560]  it's shoddy in the extreme
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.560]  full of holes
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.560]  and of course none of it has come to pass
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.560]  when I for instance wrote in 2008
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.560]  in a scientific paper published
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.560]  in a scientific journal after peer review
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.560]  that I reckoned
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:09.560]  the most likely thing was that a doubling
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.560]  of CO2 concentration
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.560]  might cause around one Celsius
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.560]  of global warming
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.560]  if you doubled it again you'd get another one
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.560]  Celsius and after that you'd run out of things
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:21.560]  to make CO2 with
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:23.560]  and therefore there wasn't a climate problem
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:25.560]  there was fury
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.560]  they again this business of them
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:29.560]  saying we can't have this policy
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.560]  well they called for your arrest
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.560]  they've done that many times they've said I should be executed
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:35.560]  they haven't just said I should be arrested
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.560]  they've said I should be executed now this is exactly the kind of language
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.560]  that was used
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:41.560]  by the French Revolutionary going back
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.560]  again to the Jackman
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.560]  so by in the days
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.560]  before Hitler came to power
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.560]  by the Nazi party they were calling
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.560]  for the extermination of their opponents
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.560]  and this is exactly
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.560]  the kind of language
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:57.560]  which is yet again being used
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.560]  by the totalitarian...
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.560]  Oh now if you support the Tea Party
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:03.560]  or anything at colleges the professors say
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.560]  we're going to kill you and they're allowed
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.560]  that was in the news two weeks ago
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.560]  they literally are threatening people
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.560]  and I noticed the controlled left
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:13.560]  is ramping themselves up
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.560]  into a bloodlusting
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.560]  lather now
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.560]  and openly saying no one is allowed to challenge them
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.560]  this is exactly what happened
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.560]  in pre-Nazi Germany
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:25.560]  but as the Nazis were coming to power
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:27.560]  they began to command
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.560]  and organize the organs of public opinion
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:31.560]  they dominated them just as the left
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.560]  does now it was the left then
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.560]  remember that although
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:37.560]  there have been attempts to rebrand
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:39.560]  Hitler as right wing he wasn't
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.560]  it was the National Socialist
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.560]  Workers Party of Germany
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.560]  these were leftists they didn't like the communists
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.560]  because they were rival leftists
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.560]  not because they were one was right
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.560]  and one was left they were both leftists
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:53.560]  and the Hitlerian movement
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.560]  did exactly as it began
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.560]  by making increasingly
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.560]  strident demands that its opponents
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.560]  should be rounded up and first imprisoned
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.560]  then executed whether with
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.560]  or without trial they didn't care either way
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:07.560]  and people didn't
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.560]  bother to stop them saying this
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.560]  and that was where
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.560]  the trouble grew
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.560]  the moment they began to realize
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:17.560]  that however extreme their rhetoric
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.560]  however wild their demands
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.560]  that their opponents should be obliterated
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:23.560]  they would not be punished
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.560]  they would not be held to account
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:27.560]  nobody would bat an eyelid
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:29.560]  it's not free speech when you say
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.560]  we need to kill our enemies
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:33.560]  once they realized they could get away with that
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.560]  they then began implementing
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.560]  what they had been calling for
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:39.560]  and the result was 6 million Jews murdered
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.560]  under 100 million people
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.560]  killed in the Second World War
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:45.560]  it is extremely dangerous
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.560]  to allow this kind of talk
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.560]  and not to fight back
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.560]  and not to resist it
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.560]  and the problem I have with today's GOP
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.560]  with the honorable exception of the Tea Party
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.560]  is that they are sitting
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.560]  on their large warmly bottoms
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.560]  and not standing up
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:03.560]  and every time
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.560]  this attempt to shut free speech down
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.560]  happens
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:09.560]  they are not fighting back
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.560]  they are not bringing in the Constitution
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:13.560]  and pointing it at those who are doing this
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:15.560]  they are tamely allowing
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.560]  the freedom that built America
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.560]  to be dismantled
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.560]  not just piece by piece but now
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.560]  wholesale the moment you get
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.560]  open calls
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.560]  around the world from the scientific community
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.560]  that anybody who disagrees with them on this subject
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.560]  should be executed
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.560]  increasingly happening
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:35.560]  and they are allowed to do this
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.560]  without punishment
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:39.560]  then that's when the rot starts
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.560]  now fortunately in some countries
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:43.560]  because of what happened under Hitler
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.560]  it is now unlawful
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.560]  to call for the execution
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.560]  of those whom you oppose politically
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.560]  and in Austria for instance
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.560]  it is illegal
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.560]  and in Scotland where I am speaking from
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.560]  it is illegal and in Austria recently
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.560]  about this time last year
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:01.560]  there was a professor
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:03.560]  I won't name him because he eventually backed off
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.560]  and he published a thing all over the web
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:07.560]  saying that people who didn't believe
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:09.560]  that the climate was doomed
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:11.560]  unless the west was shut down
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.560]  should be executed
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.560]  he said no point in trying
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.560]  let's get them out of the way
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.560]  and of course there was an outcry
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:21.560]  but he went on saying it
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.560]  and tried to justify it until I wrote to him
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.560]  and gave him 24 hours
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.560]  to retract that demand
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.560]  that we should be executed
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.560]  or I would report him to the Austrian authorities
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.560]  under the hate speech law
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.560]  and he will be sent to prison for life
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:37.560]  and my goodness you've never had a retraction
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.560]  as quick as the one that came back from him
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:41.560]  well that's the thing about the controlled left
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:43.560]  is there's such ultra-authoritarian
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.560]  photocrats
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.560]  and they just have to be stood up against
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:57.560]  their right back to Lord Mountain
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.560]  one of the most basic actions you can take
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:21.560]  to protect you and your family
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.560]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.560]  on average the county says it sprays with glyphosate
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:27.560]  at least once a week
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.560]  few filters cut out the glyphosates
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.560]  that is found in water supplies worldwide
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:33.560]  removed pesticides, herbicides
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.560]  chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid

[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:39.560]  fluoride is in teats
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:41.560]  and coffins and waters and breads and toothpaste
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:43.560]  it is our responsibility to protect our families
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.560]  the establishment's not going to do it
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:47.560]  it's time to take action
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:49.560]  it's time to filter our water

[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.560]  but it's not just the air outside that's toxic
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.560]  indoor air has been shown to have
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:13.560]  two to five times higher concentrations
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:15.560]  of pollutants than even outdoor air
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.560]  and most Americans spend 90% of their time

[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:21.560]  within their homes there are more than

[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.560]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:37.560]  it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.560]  in order to combat the toxic

[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.560]  if you have a fiesta party
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.560]  at your fraternity with mexican food
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:27.560]  toga parties are next
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:29.560]  they're saying no one can dress up at halloween costumes
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:31.560]  of geisha girls, cowboys, or indians
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:33.560]  this is the total control
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.560]  of reducing the language
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.560]  and making everything a faux pas
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:39.560]  and it ties into this shutting down
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:41.560]  of the world
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:43.560]  and it ties into it
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:45.560]  it ties into it
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:47.560]  and it ties into this shutting down information
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:49.560]  and these people calling themselves liberals
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.560]  when they are the opposite
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:53.560]  they're authoritarians
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:55.560]  we'll talk to lord moncton more about that
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.560]  and talk about the latest scandals
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:59.560]  and where this fight is going
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.560]  because we told you this six years ago
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.560]  and now it's happened they've shut down
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:05.560]  over 500 different power plants in the country
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:07.560]  coal power plants they're totally clean
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:09.560]  only water vapor and carbon dioxide
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.560]  comes out
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:13.560]  and in many areas power prices have doubled
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.560]  they're up over 30%
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.560]  and it's bankrupting the country
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:19.560]  china gets three a week we get
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:21.560]  more than three a week shut down
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.560]  now they want to shut down more than a thousand more
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.560]  do the math
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.560]  it's just incredible
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.560]  it's bring us to our knees
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:31.560]  we're going to break down on gen 21 with lord moncton
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:33.560]  speaking of gen 21
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:35.560]  we sell rosa quarry's
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.560]  book
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.560]  by the way she's a liberal democrat
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:41.560]  out in california that woke up to this
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.560]  city county planner zoning person
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:45.560]  and was thought this is incredible
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:47.560]  she wrote her book it's a short book
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.560]  it's available at infowarstore.com
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:51.560]  and it's great to give to friends and family
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:53.560]  that aren't awake to county commissioners
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:55.560]  city council people
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:57.560]  it's just one of hundreds of books

[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:05.560]  the liberty promoting pro gun and more
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:07.560]  apparel made in america

[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.560]  of these fine products supports
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:25.560]  our endeavor
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:27.560]  they are war bonds
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:29.560]  in the info war against the globalist
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.560]  and we're having a major effect
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:33.560]  so many times it's info wars
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.560]  and a constellation of other liberty media
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:37.560]  worldwide
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.560]  holding the line and pushing back
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:41.560]  ukeps being demonized and saying
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:43.560]  you know they're racist we ought to shut them down
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:45.560]  in england because it's the fastest growing party
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.560]  in england and now in europe
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:49.560]  kind of ron paul s just libertarian
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:51.560]  this is happening
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:53.560]  and of course lord mongton is one of the founders of ukep
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:55.560]  so it's so important
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.560]  to support real independent media
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.560]  even if you don't totally agree with it
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:01.560]  if it's basically pro liberty
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:03.560]  because what lord mongton said is so key
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:05.560]  and i want him to elaborate on this because it's so important
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.560]  and i don't want it to get lost in translation
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:09.560]  or
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:11.560]  kind of fall into the cracks he said
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:13.560]  collectivists have a leg up
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.560]  not individually
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.560]  individually their failures
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:19.560]  and they've got university studies
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.560]  out of canada their six times were likely to steal
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:23.560]  their families don't last
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:25.560]  these are terrible people
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.560]  they're weak people
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.560]  so they seek power in a gang
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:31.560]  they seek power in a cult
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:33.560]  they seek power in a combine
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:35.560]  they seek power in a swarm like locus
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:37.560]  and
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.560]  individualist we all have different views
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.560]  in the world even if we may
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.560]  agree on like 90 percent we have different perspectives
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.560]  we're our own people
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:47.560]  and so we're not joiners
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:49.560]  and we don't tend to
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:51.560]  uh
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:53.560]  we tend to give charity wise
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:55.560]  more than anybody else conservatives libertarians
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.560]  the statistics are worldwide but we don't
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:59.560]  unify that
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:01.560]  often because we are individualists
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:03.560]  as you just said so
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:05.560]  it's so important
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:07.560]  to buy the products to promote the radio shows
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:09.560]  the news websites
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.560]  that the FCC came out last week
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.560]  the FCC chairman
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:15.560]  and said no this will censor the drudge report
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.560]  and other libertarian conservative
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:19.560]  sites the republican leadership
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.560]  wants the real tea party shut down
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.560]  with the democrats they're the corrupt
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:25.560]  ruling class that's not free market
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.560]  and they're branding
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:31.560]  if you're pro-gun or anti-Obamacare
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.560]  that's a total scam that you're racist
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.560]  senator rockefeller i played the clip earlier in the hour
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:37.560]  we'll play it again
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:39.560]  this is what's happening
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:41.560]  and these are real authoritarians
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.560]  they need to be called out for it
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:45.560]  they're very dangerous
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:47.560]  so again go to infowarstore.com

[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.560]  and expand on what you just said
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.560]  because
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:59.560]  it was benjamin franklin that said we all
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:01.560]  hang together or hang separate that's why i don't
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:03.560]  in fight with libertarians
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.560]  or paleoconservatives or
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:07.560]  constitutionalist confucius

[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:11.560]  liberty lovers because
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.560]  i do realize the collectivist
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:15.560]  crave power
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:17.560]  and crave destroying individuals
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:19.560]  why do you think
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.560]  that the collectivist
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.560]  the authoritarians are such a vitriolic
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.560]  hatred of families
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.560]  of male masculinity
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.560]  of independent beauty and freedom and wealth
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:31.560]  it's just so alien to those of us
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.560]  i'm not putting this on a pedestal
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.560]  i'm just saying who i am who you are
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:37.560]  i crave liberty
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:39.560]  i crave the animating contest of competition
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:41.560]  i crave diversity
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:43.560]  and real dynamic human spirit
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.560]  and i would be embarrassed
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.560]  to use tactics against my competition
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.560]  to try to shut them down
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.560]  but in this authoritarian world now
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.560]  it's more than just liberalism
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:55.560]  fake liberalism
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:57.560]  it's a craven
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.560]  wicked desire
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:01.560]  to just cheat and steal
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.560]  and people think being dishonorable now
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.560]  is a way to get ahead
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:07.560]  what do you call this
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.560]  just societal rock that we're facing
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:13.560]  this has happened time and again
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:15.560]  throughout history
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.560]  it always ends in the same way
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:19.560]  it ends because eventually
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:21.560]  the totalitarians become so arrogant
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.560]  and so cruel to their fellow men
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.560]  that their fellow men
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:27.560]  who previously hadn't been able
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:29.560]  to stand together and unite
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:31.560]  finally do so
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.560]  and stand up against them
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.560]  and in fact going back to your example
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.560]  of what happened in the decades following
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:39.560]  the French Revolution
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:41.560]  when eventually Napoleon emerged
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:43.560]  as the dictator
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.560]  of France
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:47.560]  and then went around
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.560]  doing bilateral country to country
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:51.560]  deals between him and
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:53.560]  them to lock countries in
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:55.560]  where he wanted them then he would invade them
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:57.560]  and then they couldn't do anything back
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:59.560]  because they'd already signed a treaty with him
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.560]  eventually after enough
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:03.560]  countries had thus been
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.560]  gobbled up by Napoleon
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.560]  they banded together
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:09.560]  and stood together against him
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:11.560]  and even if the battle of Waterloo had not
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:13.560]  been the moment at which he was finally defeated
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.560]  he had already by then been politically
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.560]  defeated because
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.560]  a grand alliance against him
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:21.560]  had been formed
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:23.560]  and much the same happened really before the Second World War
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.560]  where countries like Britain refused
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.560]  to get into
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.560]  alliances with other countries
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.560]  against Hitler because they didn't want
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:33.560]  another war because nobody wants
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:35.560]  another war but the fact was if they didn't
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:37.560]  have one Hitler was going to dominate
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.560]  Europe by exactly the same techniques
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.560]  of a combination of a joint diplomacy
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:43.560]  and brute force
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:45.560]  and will that Napoleon had
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.560]  previously used and Hitler modeled himself
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.560]  very much on the podium
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:51.560]  and so they did it then and eventually
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:53.560]  Hitler pushed it too far
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:55.560]  and the world ganged up against him
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:57.560]  and he was stopped
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.560]  now the difficulty we now face Alex
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:01.560]  is as I was saying earlier a unique situation
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:03.560]  in which totalitarianism
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.560]  or group think
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.560]  has gone global and this globalization
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.560]  of group think is an extremely
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:11.560]  difficult thing to deal with because
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:13.560]  to a greater or lesser degree
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.560]  every country even in the once
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.560]  freedom-loving western world
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:19.560]  is now part of this
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:21.560]  and the entire bureaucratic and governing
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:23.560]  class knows that it's more than
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:25.560]  it's job is worth to dare
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:27.560]  to speak out against it. I'm going to give
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:29.560]  you an example from the University
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.560]  of Delaware where
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:33.560]  a communist front group called Greenpeace
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:35.560]  which pretends to be an environmental
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.560]  organization but in fact was
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:39.560]  taken over by communists
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.560]  30 or 40 years ago now and has been
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.560]  run as a front and by the way
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:45.560]  their founder is the one that blew the whistle on that
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:47.560]  and released the documents that's a fact
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:49.560]  Patrick Moore who has talked
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:51.560]  to me about it and likewise
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:53.560]  is another founder of the late Eric Ellington
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:55.560]  whom I knew well and
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:57.560]  when I first mentioned on your show
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:59.560]  some years ago that Eric Ellington
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:01.560]  one of the founders of Greenpeace had said
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:03.560]  that this had become taken over
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.560]  by the communists.
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.560]  The communists were very angry
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:09.560]  and they then got in touch with me to say
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:11.560]  well you know what evidence do you have
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.560]  that there was anybody called Eric Ellington
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.560]  and I said well his brother is still alive
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.560]  and living in in Scotland where he used to live
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:19.560]  why don't you get in touch with him
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.560]  so they went quiet after that once they realized
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:23.560]  there was an Eric Ellington he was a landscape
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.560]  photographer he lived partly in Scotland
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:27.560]  partly in Jersey and he said to me very
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:29.560]  plainly and he was not a political man
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:31.560]  he said look we founded the organization
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:33.560]  to be a genuine environmental organization
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:35.560]  that was our intention Patrick Moore says the same
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.560]  but he said
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:39.560]  then the communists suddenly took it over
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:41.560]  and because we weren't
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.560]  political we didn't know how to
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.560]  stop them and within a few years
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:47.560]  all of us who had founded it had left
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:49.560]  not because we didn't believe we needed
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:51.560]  a cleaner and safer environment
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:53.560]  but because we didn't believe Greenpeace any longer
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.560]  had anything to do with that.
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:57.560]  Now this organization
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:59.560]  wrote to the University of Delaware it's doing this all the time
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:01.560]  and it made
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:03.560]  an extremely intrusive and elaborate
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:05.560]  freedom of information request
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:07.560]  against Professor David Legates
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:09.560]  who happens to be a co-author
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.560]  of mine on a recent scientific paper
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:13.560]  and a bit of a friend and
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:15.560]  they began saying this was four years ago now
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:17.560]  that they wanted
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:19.560]  information in 60 different
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.560]  categories about his work
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:23.560]  on climate change.
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:25.560]  Now under the law
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:27.560]  in the state of Delaware the first state
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:29.560]  of the Union as you know one of the smallest
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:31.560]  and unfortunately
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.560]  controlled largely by the left
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:35.560]  Joe Biden's son at the moment
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.560]  is the Attorney General there
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:39.560]  they have a freedom of information law
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:41.560]  and this
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:43.560]  was exploited by Greenpeace
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:45.560]  and they said we want
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:47.560]  information about all this
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.560]  to do with Professor Legates.
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.560]  Now Professor Legates is not paid
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.560]  by the state of Delaware
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:55.560]  he's paid independently by the University
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:57.560]  which is itself subsidized
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:59.560]  separately by the state of Delaware
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.560]  but his salary
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:03.560]  is not paid from what comes
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:05.560]  from the state of Delaware or rather
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:07.560]  it wasn't but then
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:09.560]  once this freedom of information request
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.560]  came along
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:13.560]  only then did the University
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:15.560]  tell him that for some years
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.560]  it had been allocating
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.560]  part of the funds from the University
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:21.560]  from the state of Delaware
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:23.560]  towards his salary
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:25.560]  and therefore and only
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.560]  for that reason he was
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:29.560]  subject to the freedom of information law
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:31.560]  and had to turn over not
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.560]  only all the paperwork
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:35.560]  that the law required him to
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:37.560]  but all his personal paperwork
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:39.560]  or anything to do with the climate
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:41.560]  that was on his personal computer, his personal work
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.560]  even if it had nothing to do with
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.560]  state funding he was still to hand it over.
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.560]  That is an unprecedented level
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.560]  of invasion of privacy
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:51.560]  of academic freedom and the University
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:53.560]  went on and on and on at him
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:55.560]  and there's a really nasty piece of work there
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:57.560]  called White
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:59.560]  Lawrence White, he is the
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.560]  general counsel for the University
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:03.560]  he was at Georgetown before
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:05.560]  he's been the rounds and everywhere that
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:07.560]  he's been he seems to have moved on
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:09.560]  rather quickly I shall say
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:11.560]  I won't put it any stronger than that
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:13.560]  Anyway here he is at the University of Delaware
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:15.560]  quite a come down from Georgetown
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:17.560]  and this unspeakable
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:19.560]  White says to
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:21.560]  Lee Gates
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:23.560]  you either produce all this documentation
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:25.560]  whether or not the law requires it
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:27.560]  whether or not it forms part of Greenpeace's request
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:29.560]  or you will have
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:31.560]  infringed a request
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.560]  by a senior officer of the University and you'll be punished for it
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:35.560]  he was threatened
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:37.560]  that if he didn't produce documents which he had
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:39.560]  no duty under any law
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:41.560]  to produce he would be punished
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.560]  by the University. So just more bullying
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:45.560]  I want to shift gears currently into their latest
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:47.560]  power grabs because politically they've been
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:49.560]  exposed again they don't care about
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:51.560]  any of the real environmental issues it's just all
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.560]  carbon taxes they're all making money
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:55.560]  off it from Pechari and the UN
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.560]  moving power plants from England
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:59.560]  and steel mills in England to
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:01.560]  India you've got Al Gore making
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:03.560]  money off of it all of this
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:05.560]  Obama making money off of it
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:07.560]  but they're still just moving forward
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:09.560]  give us the lightest on that
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:11.560]  Right let me first of all just wrap that up
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:13.560]  very quickly I was just about at the end of it there
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:15.560]  and I have therefore intervened
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.560]  in this matter of the University
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:19.560]  and I have made my own freedom of
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:21.560]  information request saying I want all the paperwork
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:23.560]  from the unspeakable white
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:25.560]  about his handling
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:27.560]  of the affair of Professor
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:29.560]  Lee Gates and the request from Greenpeace
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:31.560]  and so far
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:33.560]  the University including a white
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.560]  wrote to me and he said I'm not going to give you any information
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.560]  and so he is now in very big trouble
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:41.560]  with the law because the next thing will happen we'll go
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:43.560]  to court and we'll drag the unspeakable
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:45.560]  white into court and make him explain
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:47.560]  itself and put him in the witness box
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:49.560]  and question after question after question
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:51.560]  the man will be broken by the end of this process
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:53.560]  if he's behaved as I'm told he's behaved
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:55.560]  and so the issue is they're going
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:57.560]  after stuff that you're not allowed to get under
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:59.560]  foyer but then he's not following a foyer
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:01.560]  himself no that's right
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.560]  absolutely the double
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.560]  standard is is powerful but this is
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.560]  they're quite shameless about this
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.560]  they don't care they'll justify
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:11.560]  things by the law if it suits them
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.560]  and if the law doesn't suit them they won't comply
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:15.560]  with it themselves that's how they are
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:17.560]  these people but the point is
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:19.560]  that we are now beginning to fight back
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:21.560]  every time they try this
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:23.560]  on one of my colleagues we fight back
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:25.560]  we're also fighting back against
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:27.560]  anyone who now produces an open
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.560]  and obvious lie in a scientific paper
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:31.560]  and I'm going after
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.560]  at the moment some researchers at the University
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.560]  of Queensland who tried to say
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:37.560]  that 97%
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.560]  of all scientists in 11,944
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.560]  papers they reviewed since
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.560]  1991 had said
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.560]  that most of the warming of recent decades
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:47.560]  was caused by us when
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:49.560]  their own data file that they had
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:51.560]  themselves marked up showed
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:53.560]  only 64 papers out of 11,944
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.560]  0.5%
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.560]  oh yeah
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:59.560]  the hoax that polar bears can't swim
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:01.560]  and penguins are all dying and that
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:03.560]  and the earth's all dying
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.560]  if you can catch them
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:07.560]  out in an actual
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:09.560]  freight lie
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:11.560]  then you've got them because it's fraud
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:13.560]  and so what we're doing to these
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:15.560]  people who have committed fraud
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.560]  here and elsewhere
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.560]  is we're going after them now
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.560]  with prosecutions and you see
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.560]  in Britain we're in some respects
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:25.560]  although we're an unconsidered satrap here of the European
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:27.560]  tyranny by clock we still
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.560]  have one or two freedoms the European
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:31.560]  tyranny how's about to say by the way
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.560]  you're not just toot your horn here you were able
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:35.560]  to get Al Gore's movie pulled out of most schools
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:37.560]  because of all the lies in it
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:41.560]  we made the Department of Education
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:43.560]  circulate I think it was
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:45.560]  70 pages of corrective
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:47.560]  guidance before that film could be
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:49.560]  shown in any school so it was
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:51.560]  a huge victory Al Gore has never
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:53.560]  really recovered from it because
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:55.560]  he was shown to have been essentially
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:57.560]  a political charlatan who knew nothing about the climate
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:59.560]  wait a minute he didn't invent the internet
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:01.560]  well who
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:03.560]  can say but I doubt it very much
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.560]  certainly he was wrong about the climate
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:07.560]  no no I'm being sarcastic the internet was invented
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.560]  in the 70s he's now regarded as a bit of a joke
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:11.560]  the point is though that we're now
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:13.560]  fighting back against these lies and the way
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:15.560]  to do it is to go
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:17.560]  against the individual
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:19.560]  liars the individual crooks
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:21.560]  the individual people
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:23.560]  like the unspeakable white
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:25.560]  the so called general council
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:27.560]  of the University of Delaware
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:29.560]  who has quite improperly abused
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:31.560]  his power and abused his position
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:33.560]  to try to
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:35.560]  order a tenured member of the faculty
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.560]  at his university
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.560]  to produce documents in gross
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.560]  interference with his academic freedom
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.560]  when there was no law
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:45.560]  that empowered him so to demand
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:47.560]  alright we're going to stay there Lord Monkton
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:49.560]  I want to come back and get into
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.560]  their latest power grabs though
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:53.560]  we've talked about stuff they've been doing
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.560]  how we're fighting back but I want to know
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:57.560]  what their latest schemes are
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:59.560]  warn us coming up
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:01.560]  hello this is Steve Shank
[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:03.560]  why do police go undercover
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:05.560]  and why do countries send out spies
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:07.560]  simple if you can cast from intelligence
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:09.560]  what the other guy is doing
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:11.560]  you have the battle won before it starts
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.560]  let's see what intelligence we have about
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:15.560]  your food situation
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:17.560]  we're having the worst disasters ever
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.560]  storms, earthquakes, floods and terrible drought
[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:21.560]  half our population needs food stamps
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:23.560]  and other subsidies to afford their food now
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:25.560]  prices have just hit their all time high
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:27.560]  with more terrible cost coming
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:29.560]  and now your water are being sold
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.560]  to other starving countries
[01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:33.560]  still one third of our corn goes to expensive gas
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:35.560]  instead of feeding livestock and people
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:37.560]  but few dollars you have
[01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:39.560]  China expects to devalue to uselessness
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:41.560]  if it's possible to get the most
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:43.560]  of the best food and freeze the availability
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:45.560]  and cost before it disappears and is unavailable

[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:28.560]  I want people to understand something
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:33.560]  I first
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:35.560]  got on radio in 1996
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:37.560]  and I was just like a mainline libertarian
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:39.560]  and all these veterans
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:41.560]  government people you name it
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:43.560]  engineers were educating me
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:45.560]  because I was on the radio
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:47.560]  and nobody else had a show like this
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:49.560]  in Central Texas
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:51.560]  now it's been syndicated of course since 1997
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:53.560]  and then it's expanded greatly
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:55.560]  but the engineers
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:57.560]  would bring me the documents
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:59.560]  the farmers and ranchers who were having
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:01.560]  their ranches taken
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:03.560]  an imminent domain
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:05.560]  for pennies on the dollar
[01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:07.560]  and then the Enviro Nazis
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:09.560]  that would do it would turn around
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:11.560]  five years later and turn it into condos
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:13.560]  and mansions
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:15.560]  and sell three acres
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:17.560]  for a million dollars
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:19.560]  or two million dollars
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:21.560]  some cases
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:23.560]  half an acre for three million dollars
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:25.560]  on the Colorado River
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:27.560]  I watched them take more than 50,000 acres
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:29.560]  and I mean
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:31.560]  I would come out from the radio studio
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:33.560]  and all these people down there
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:35.560]  want me to come to their ranches
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:37.560]  and see what was being taken
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:39.560]  I would go cover it
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:41.560]  and
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:43.560]  it's like a James Bond movie
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:45.560]  some of the stuff the harassment I would get
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:47.560]  the death threats
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:49.560]  I would stop some of it
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:51.560]  because it's so corrupt you barely stand up
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:53.560]  it falls
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:55.560]  I want to hold Lord Monk to five minutes
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:57.560]  for the next hour so we can finish up the statements
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:55:59.560]  I'm just telling the story now
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:01.560]  that I then went with Mike Hansen
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:03.560]  we've got the footage somewhere we aired it
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:05.560]  back then I had Access TV showing like 97
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:07.560]  they had former Dallas Cowboys
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:09.560]  they had the Bank of America
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:11.560]  they had people from the Clinton administration there
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:13.560]  we got into smart growth conference
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:15.560]  I interviewed Michael Dell
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:17.560]  and I said of course we know it's a land grab
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:19.560]  and would laugh at me
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:21.560]  they weren't even liberals or communists
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:23.560]  so there's also a component of this
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:25.560]  of land grabbers
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:27.560]  and controllers
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:29.560]  it's just criminality is the only way to describe it
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:31.560]  Lord Monk I tell that story
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:33.560]  because I don't think people realize
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:35.560]  under agenda 21
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:37.560]  it's a total overthrow
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:39.560]  it's a return to feudalism
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:41.560]  but it's beyond that
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:43.560]  what do you call these people
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:45.560]  they're beyond authoritarians
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:47.560]  they're really
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:49.560]  like authoritarians meet con artists
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:51.560]  how would you...
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:53.560]  what they are is thieves
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:55.560]  it's a brilliant scam
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:57.560]  because what they do is they set up this whole
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:56:59.560]  environmental thing about how we have to save the planet
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:01.560]  it's preached now in every school
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:03.560]  as though it was some kind of new religion
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:05.560]  and then they go around
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:07.560]  they say right we want to exercise eminent
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:09.560]  domain over a nice ranch in an attractive area
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:11.560]  so that we can save
[01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:13.560]  the lesser spotted three-toed warbler
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:15.560]  or something
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:17.560]  no no it's a warbler in Austin
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:19.560]  no it's a warbler, you're right
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:21.560]  they'll leave it then for a few years
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:23.560]  fallow and then they'll sell it off
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:25.560]  and because
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:27.560]  they'll just leave enough time
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:29.560]  so that people have forgotten how it was they came
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:31.560]  by that land and why they came by it
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:33.560]  they sell it off, up go the condos
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:35.560]  and they trouser
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:37.560]  millions, I mean tens of millions on each ranch
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:39.560]  if they're clever about it
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:41.560]  and this goes and then of course
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:43.560]  a lot of that money goes into the democrat
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:45.560]  political party and of course that is why
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:47.560]  the democrats
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:49.560]  and the left generally have taken up
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:51.560]  this supposed global warming cause
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:53.560]  it is because the major
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:55.560]  funders of their opponents
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:57.560]  politically were of course
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:59.560]  the fossil fuel companies, the coal companies
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:01.560]  the electricity companies
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:03.560]  they were all big donors once upon a time
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:05.560]  to the republican party
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:07.560]  and so what the left have been doing
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:09.560]  for many many years apart from enriching themselves
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:11.560]  they're shaking the oil companies down
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:13.560]  cause they give more to the left now than the right
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:15.560]  that is exactly the thing
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:17.560]  they've terrorized the
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:19.560]  they buy protection money, they buy protection
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:21.560]  yes exactly that by saying
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:23.560]  if you don't do things the way we want
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:25.560]  we'll shut you down because of global warming
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:27.560]  now there is no basis for shutting
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:29.560]  anybody down because of global warming
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:31.560]  but if you've got every school kid
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:33.560]  being trained up by his teachers day after day
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:35.560]  in all this garbage
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:37.560]  eventually people are going to end up...
[01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:39.560]  Sir do five more minutes with us on solutions
[01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:41.560]  stay there please
[01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:45.560]  this is GCN
[01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:47.560]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:53.560]  General what do you think about the FBI
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:55.560]  saying that there is a terror alert on Monday
[01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:57.560]  about a potential forward situation
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:59.560]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex
[01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:01.560]  shoving the crowd
[01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:03.560]  whether it's the radio show
[01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:05.560]  or the news websites documentary films
[01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:07.560]  or the nightly news
[01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:09.560]  Info Wars is the tip of the spear
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:11.560]  is this another false flight stage attack
[01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:13.560]  to take our civil liberties and put more homeland security
[01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:15.560]  by sticking the hands down on the pants on the streets
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:17.560]  it's up to us to set brush fires
[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:19.560]  in the minds of men and women everywhere
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:21.560]  and that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do
[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:23.560]  you watch the Assad regime
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:25.560]  is going to be blamed or accused
[01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:27.560]  of using chemical weapons
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:29.560]  against the so called rebels
[01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:31.560]  what we see now is a war against reality
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:33.560]  it's a war against the truth
[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:35.560]  it's more vital than ever
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:37.560]  that supporters of freedom become members
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:39.560]  of prisonplanet.tv

[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:21.560]  Alex Jones
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:23.560]  alright final segment with lord
[02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:25.560]  Monkton will give you his website here in a moment
[02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:27.560]  you've got the floor sir in the five minutes we have
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:29.560]  thanks for staying over
[02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:31.560]  any other attacks they're involved in
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:33.560]  we should know about their latest scams
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:35.560]  and then any other solutions lord Monkton
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:37.560]  right first thing is
[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:39.560]  we're now going to fight back
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:41.560]  we're going to fight back in an organized way
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:43.560]  we're going to make absolutely
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:45.560]  sure that these people
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:47.560]  know that if they are ever dishonest
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:49.560]  in what they do
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:51.560]  we will have them prosecuted
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:53.560]  for it
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:55.560]  and in the United Kingdom
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:57.560]  we still have the freedom
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:00:59.560]  to mount a private prosecution
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:01.560]  even when the corrupt institutions of the state
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:03.560]  refuse to do so
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:05.560]  I'm actually quietly involved in a case
[02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:07.560]  at the moment
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:09.560]  and because I'm involved in it
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:11.560]  I'm not going to give too many details
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:13.560]  except to say that it involves
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:15.560]  a researcher at a university
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:17.560]  who contributed to a scientific paper
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:19.560]  whose results he flagrantly
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:21.560]  misrepresented
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:23.560]  in a manner where he could not but have
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:25.560]  realized he was misrepresenting it
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:27.560]  it was deliberate
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:29.560]  he deliberately misrepresented those results
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:31.560]  with the intention of maintaining
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:33.560]  the enormous funding
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:35.560]  that particular university gets
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:37.560]  for its work on climate change
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:39.560]  and of impoverishing
[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:41.560]  those of us who have to pay
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:43.560]  massive extra money
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:45.560]  for energy bills that you were talking about earlier
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:47.560]  now that
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:49.560]  under the British definition of
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:51.560]  the fraud law
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:53.560]  which has been changed several times recently
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:55.560]  used to be a common law definition
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:57.560]  but now it's a statutory definition
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:01:59.560]  is a fraud in two directions
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:01.560]  first of all
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:03.560]  it's a fraud because
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:05.560]  the guy has made up
[02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:07.560]  scientific results
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:09.560]  and then misstated them
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:11.560]  and then it's a fraud
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:13.560]  because not only has he
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:15.560]  made that misrepresentation
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:17.560]  so it's fraud by misrepresentation
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:19.560]  he's getting money
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:21.560]  well he himself
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:23.560]  probably isn't making any more money
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:25.560]  by perpetrating the fraud than he would otherwise
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:27.560]  the point is he's causing losses
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:29.560]  to taxpayers and under the British definition
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:31.560]  if you cause a loss to somebody else
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:33.560]  even if you don't expect to benefit from it yourself
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:35.560]  that is still a fraud
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:37.560]  and so it's a fraud also
[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:39.560]  it's a abuse of public trust
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:41.560]  scientists are paid
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:43.560]  a lot of money
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:45.560]  to present their results fairly
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:47.560]  that doesn't mean they're always going to get things right
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:49.560]  but it does mean that if they get a result
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:51.560]  they present that result
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:53.560]  accurately and they do not present
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:55.560]  people in the professional class
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:57.560]  are held to a higher standard
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:02:59.560]  and they are indeed under the new law
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:01.560]  that is the case
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:03.560]  now the first step I have taken
[02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:05.560]  is to give the university the chance
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:07.560]  to name it
[02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:09.560]  the chance to sort its act out
[02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:11.560]  and in the end it worked its way all the way up
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:13.560]  to the vice chancellor
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:15.560]  who refused to take action
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:17.560]  he is now in the frame for fraud
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:19.560]  as is his university
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:21.560]  as is the researcher who caused the trouble
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:23.560]  in the first place as are the three professors
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:25.560]  who were involved in hearing
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:27.560]  the misconduct case
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:29.560]  and finding in favour
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:31.560]  of the student who was concerned
[02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:33.560]  when the evidence against
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:35.560]  that person was overwhelming
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:37.560]  all of them are now facing
[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:39.560]  jail for fraud
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:41.560]  so you're saying the way to go after them is get on the office
[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:43.560]  I agree and the woman we've got left
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:45.560]  absolutely that and so the paperwork has gone
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:47.560]  to the serious fraud office it's looking at it at the moment
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:49.560]  my
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:51.560]  legal advisors who are handling this for me
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:53.560]  have said that the likelihood is
[02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:55.560]  that they won't want to deal with it
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:57.560]  because it doesn't fit into their usual way of doing things
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:03:59.560]  nor will the local police
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:01.560]  in the county concern
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:03.560]  and I won't name
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:05.560]  but the moment they have actually said no to us
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:07.560]  I am then free
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:09.560]  as you are not in the United States
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:11.560]  to walk into any court
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:13.560]  in England and Wales any magistrate
[02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:15.560]  and say here's the evidence
[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:17.560]  I say
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:19.560]  that a crime has been committed
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:21.560]  I have tried to get the public authorities
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:23.560]  to do something about it
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:25.560]  and they won't
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:27.560]  please will you
[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:29.560]  exercising your powers under section one
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:31.560]  just in peace act 1361
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:33.560]  order them to
[02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:35.560]  investigate or in the alternative
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:37.560]  allow me to prosecute
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:39.560]  and then I can prosecute directly
[02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:41.560]  myself
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:43.560]  and that's what I'm now going to do
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:45.560]  so plain and so appalling
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:47.560]  a lie has been told so
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:49.560]  catastrophic an effect as it had on politics
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:51.560]  our own ministers are citing
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:53.560]  this paper and as
[02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:55.560]  part of the reason why they're inflicting
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:57.560]  ever higher taxes on us
[02:04:57.560 --> 02:04:59.560]  I'll tell you what we got to go to break again

[02:06:59.560 --> 02:07:01.560]  Hi folks Alex Jones
[02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:03.560]  here with some important information
[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:05.560]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:07.560]  and his team of patriots over at my
[02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:09.560]  Patriots supply several years ago
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:11.560]  Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:13.560]  frustrated with the direction this country
[02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:15.560]  was headed and the charlatans
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:17.560]  willing to sell us out for a quick buck
[02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:19.560]  deciding to take action a company run
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:21.560]  by patriots for patriots was born
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:23.560]  my Patriots supply has never
[02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:25.560]  taken a loan or accepted outside funding
[02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:27.560]  they now operate two distribution
[02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:29.560]  facilities and employ
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:31.560]  over 50 hardworking American men and women
[02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:33.560]  it is rare to find companies
[02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:35.560]  who practice what they preach and that's why
[02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:37.560]  I stock my pantry with high quality

[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:29.560]  economic news
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:31.560]  when Lord Monkton leaves us at about 5 minutes
[02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:33.560]  he's really on the offense right now
[02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:35.560]  just like what happened with climate gate
[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:37.560]  and those documents coming out
[02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:39.560]  there's new ones coming out all the time now
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:41.560]  where major universities getting caught
[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:43.560]  organizing fraud
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:45.560]  farming for 17 years
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:47.560]  a lot of data shows it's been cooling the last few years
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:49.560]  but regardless folks
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:51.560]  I don't romanticize the oil companies
[02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:53.560]  I don't romanticize any of this
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:55.560]  most of the big oil companies like BP
[02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:57.560]  and Dutch Royal Shell
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:08:59.560]  I see them funding all the environmental ads
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:01.560]  so
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:03.560]  they basically are working with this
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:05.560]  this has been the decided program
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:07.560]  I get zero money
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:09.560]  from any corporation or petrol group
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:11.560]  and any time I talk about
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:13.560]  our coal power plants being shut down
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:15.560]  you must work for them
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:17.560]  well actually coal is generally
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:19.560]  diametrically opposed to oil
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:21.560]  because coal is even cheaper than oil
[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:23.560]  our power prices are exploding
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:25.560]  same thing in England
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:27.560]  Lord Monkton I know you want to finish up
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:29.560]  with how you're prosecuting these people
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:31.560]  and you've done a lot of that in the past
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:33.560]  and made them stop showing Al Gore's movie
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:35.560]  it was proven fraud and all the rest of it
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:37.560]  and I agree that's a key way to go after them
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:39.560]  but joining us in these last few minutes
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:41.560]  I'm going to ask you
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:43.560]  the larger issue
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:45.560]  of
[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:47.560]  I mean just for the general public
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:49.560]  why does the establishment want to bankrupt the west
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:51.560]  why are they moving everything to China
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:53.560]  and India nothing against China and India
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:55.560]  but I mean
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:57.560]  they wouldn't have a market to sell to soon
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:09:59.560]  at the level of economic downturn
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:01.560]  I mean I go to the mall
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:03.560]  used to be totally full just 3-4 years ago
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:05.560]  it's empty I go to movies
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:07.560]  they're empty used to be full
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:09.560]  Austin is a boom city
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:11.560]  the number one boom city
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:13.560]  in the United States
[02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:15.560]  and if it's not a trendy area
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:17.560]  or where government people are at
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:19.560]  or where some of the new Boris live
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:21.560]  it's stalling out most of my family
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:23.560]  that were middle class
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:25.560]  across the border having trouble
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:27.560]  I mean I can see
[02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:29.560]  the country becoming poor
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:31.560]  I can see
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:33.560]  these policies directly shutting us down
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:35.560]  why does the establishment want to do it
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:37.560]  I mean I know about Cloward and Pevin
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:39.560]  and then I want you to
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:41.560]  the establishment in the west
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:43.560]  is looking towards
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:45.560]  global institutions of government
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:47.560]  and everyone who now wants to get into politics
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:49.560]  is playing to become
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:51.560]  president of the European Union
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:53.560]  president of the UN general sector of the UN
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:55.560]  they want to be
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:57.560]  on the world stage now
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:10:59.560]  it's this global
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:01.560]  aspect which I keep referring to
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:03.560]  they don't care how many
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:05.560]  people they tread on
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:07.560]  how many people they make bankrupt
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:09.560]  how many people's ranches they take over and build condos on
[02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:11.560]  they don't care as long as
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:13.560]  they take charge globally
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:15.560]  it's the same with our prime ministers
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:17.560]  now they all the moment they stop being prime minister here
[02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:19.560]  they queue up to get jobs in the European Union
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:21.560]  or the UN
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:23.560]  that's where the real ambition now is
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:25.560]  and because these institutions
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:27.560]  at global level
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:29.560]  are not elected by anyone
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:31.560]  they are all totalitarian institutions
[02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:33.560]  by nature
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:35.560]  because it's only if you have an injection of democracy
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:37.560]  into a system that you have any hope of getting
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:39.560]  anything recognisable as freedom
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:41.560]  except by sheer luck
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:43.560]  and because we have not
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:45.560]  yet made sure
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:47.560]  that the international
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:49.560]  institutions that represent us
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:51.560]  are elected
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:53.560]  these totalitarian institutions
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:55.560]  are increasingly taking real
[02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:57.560]  power from
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:11:59.560]  countries where you still elect your
[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:01.560]  governments as you do for instance
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:03.560]  in the United States we don't in Britain anymore
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:05.560]  we have elections but there for mere
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:07.560]  clerks we don't elect the people
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:09.560]  of government as those are the unelected bureaucrats
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:11.560]  of the European dictatorship
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:13.560]  but you still have elections
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:15.560]  but it doesn't matter who you elect
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:17.560]  what Obama has been doing is going around
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:19.560]  signing foreign treaties
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:21.560]  because under your constitution
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:23.560]  he worked out that the constitution is an obstacle to him
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:25.560]  and the way around it was in the constitution itself
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:27.560]  if he signs a foreign treaty
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:29.560]  that doesn't just bind this congress
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:31.560]  even if he's voted out of office
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:33.560]  and nobody wants that particular provision anymore
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:35.560]  once it's in an international treaty
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:37.560]  often made with just one other
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:39.560]  left-wing country doing the same thing
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:41.560]  then that becomes
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:43.560]  part of the permanent international law
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:45.560]  and you don't have the power
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:47.560]  unilaterally even if you all vote for it
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:49.560]  to repudiate that treaty
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:51.560]  so that's what he's doing
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:53.560]  and increasingly
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:55.560]  this battle is going to have to be fought
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:57.560]  at the international level
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:12:59.560]  and there are two ways one can do this
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:01.560]  one can try oneself to take over
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:03.560]  these institutions of totalitarianism
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:05.560]  but they won't let anyone like you or me
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:07.560]  anywhere near it
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:09.560]  you have to subscribe
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:11.560]  to this culture of corruption
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:13.560]  in order to get away with it
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:15.560]  what we're going to have to do Alex
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:17.560]  it's very ambitious, I'm just beginning to work it out now
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:19.560]  with my friends
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:21.560]  is to establish parallel
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:23.560]  independent
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:25.560]  politically elected
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:27.560]  institutions, a new United Nations
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:29.560]  that is elected, a new World Bank
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:31.560]  that is elected
[02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:33.560]  so that no longer will these old
[02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:35.560]  totalitarian institutions
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:37.560]  have any money, any power
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:39.560]  any standing or any right
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:41.560]  to interfere in how we live
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:43.560]  we're going to need a new
[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:45.560]  constitution of freedom
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:47.560]  internationally
[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:49.560]  not just in individual states
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:51.560]  it's desirable there too but internationally
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:53.560]  we now have to club together
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:55.560]  in a way that as we were saying at the outset
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:57.560]  we do not as
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:13:59.560]  individualists naturally do
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:01.560]  and so I'm proposing to
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:03.560]  found an institute
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:05.560]  it's just going to be called
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:07.560]  freedom and it's going to be open
[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:09.560]  to anyone in the world
[02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:11.560]  who subscribes to democratic
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:13.560]  principles of government
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:15.560]  so that the power resides firmly
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:17.560]  as it does in the United States Constitution
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:19.560]  at least in theory, in the hands
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:21.560]  of the government but of the people
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:23.560]  who can make and un-make government
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:25.560]  at will that's what we're going to have to do
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:27.560]  and we're going to have to do it quite fast
[02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:29.560]  because freedom is dying
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:31.560]  very rapidly
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:33.560]  your republican party is not fighting for it
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:35.560]  the conservative party here has abandoned it
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:37.560]  which is why today
[02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:39.560]  the United Kingdom independence party
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:41.560]  is about to become the largest
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:43.560]  British party in the European Parliament
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:45.560]  and
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:47.560]  it's going to be such a stunning result
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:49.560]  for UKIP that the totalitarians
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:51.560]  will be rocked back on their heels
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:53.560]  because we have been quietly building
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:55.560]  for years to make absolutely sure
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:57.560]  that at least on our continent
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:14:59.560]  freedom does not die
[02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:01.560]  no I know and I follow
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:03.560]  the news as your party that you founded
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:05.560]  20 something years ago or whatever
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:07.560]  it was explodes in popularity
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:09.560]  and it's duplicated across Europe
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:11.560]  they're openly calling for shutting you down
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:13.560]  saying you're racist when you're the opposite of it
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:15.560]  I mean
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:17.560]  saying UKIP is
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:19.560]  and just really using classic Marxist tactics
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:21.560]  and that's what I wanted to ask you Lord
[02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:23.560]  Monkton is that
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:25.560]  clearly I mean
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:27.560]  I saw last year where the French socialist
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:29.560]  to a man almost
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:31.560]  and a woman are exempt from
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:33.560]  the EU taxes as the EU bureaucrats are
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:35.560]  I mean total
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:37.560]  total discrimination classical tyranny
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:39.560]  and then they almost all
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:41.560]  have Swiss bank accounts
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:43.560]  and don't pay their national taxes
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:45.560]  but have raised taxes on
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:47.560]  the Nouveau-Riche and wealthy in France
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:49.560]  to 101%
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:51.560]  to bankrupt their competition
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:53.560]  I mean this is
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:55.560]  a lawless hyper tyranny
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:57.560]  and as Nigel Farage
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:15:59.560]  your colleague and leader of the party
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:01.560]  you know becomes more and more popular
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:03.560]  to see them so threatened
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:05.560]  it shows that they can be defeated
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:07.560]  but as you said
[02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:09.560]  we have to accurately state
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:11.560]  how radically bad they are
[02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:13.560]  but people in England
[02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:15.560]  people in Europe people here in the US
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:17.560]  tend to be more gentlemanly
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:19.560]  conservatives tend to be more
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:21.560]  friendly and we don't want
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:23.560]  to come out and say
[02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:25.560]  these are blood thirsty tyrants
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:27.560]  but they are
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:29.560]  so how do you up the rhetoric
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:31.560]  to match the reality is what I'm saying
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:33.560]  well what we've done
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:35.560]  in UKIP and we've done it very quietly
[02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:37.560]  but with increasing success we have a brilliant
[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:39.560]  leader Nigel Farage
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:41.560]  who is an ordinary working bloke
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:43.560]  who
[02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:45.560]  just decided he wanted his country back
[02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:47.560]  and for years
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:49.560]  he got nowhere he went around all the pubs
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:51.560]  in the south east of England one every night
[02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:53.560]  talking to people saying we can't let this go on
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:55.560]  and they were all horrified at what he was telling
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:57.560]  me about how this political class
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:16:59.560]  was trying to take away
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:01.560]  all their democratic rights and powers
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:03.560]  and they were appalled
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:05.560]  and gradually he built
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:07.560]  UKIP into an enormous and very
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:09.560]  successful fighting force it's about
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:11.560]  to do very very well
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:13.560]  in the European elections precisely because
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:15.560]  all the other parties here
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:17.560]  in Scotland all the other parties have ganged up against us
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:19.560]  and they've said whatever you do
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:21.560]  don't vote UKIP we're all agreed
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:23.560]  we don't want UKIP of course they are
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:25.560]  because they don't want their gravy
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:27.560]  trained to hit the buffers they don't
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:29.560]  want it to tip into the guts they want to go on
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:31.560]  being able to pray upon us
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:33.560]  to put up their ludicrous wind farms
[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:35.560]  all over the beautiful parts of Scotland
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:37.560]  to run everybody out of money
[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:39.560]  with excessive power prices
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:41.560]  to make everybody the slaves
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:43.560]  the tyranny that they cannot remove and cannot hold to account
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:45.560]  and we have simply said
[02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:47.560]  here is what they're actually doing to you
[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:49.560]  we've described it
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:51.560]  and we have used the kind of language
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:53.560]  that conservatives don't usually use
[02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:55.560]  we've called them tyrants we've called them communists
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:17:57.560]  we've called them exactly what they are
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:17:59.560]  that's it the only way to defeat them
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:01.560]  they always say turn down your rhetoric
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:03.560]  you'll be successful no that's why we fail
[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:05.560]  we must go all the way
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:07.560]  we must tell the truth
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:09.560]  of course one has to be sensible
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:11.560]  in the way one puts the point across
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:13.560]  as I've said to you before
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:15.560]  I regard you as being just about on the outer fringe
[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:17.560]  of where one can safely be any further
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:19.560]  and you're off into outer space
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:21.560]  but the thing is yes
[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:23.560]  there has to be a certain common sense
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:25.560]  in how we express ourselves
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:27.560]  but we can be a great deal more
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:29.560]  vigorous than your average
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:31.560]  limp-wisted panty-waste from the GOP
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:33.560]  national committees
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:35.560]  we can do a lot more
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:37.560]  than they are doing
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:39.560]  well sure but let me respond to that
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:41.560]  I mean look I need to be a radicalizer
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:43.560]  and go all the way
[02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:45.560]  get the bar bar first to shake people out of their days
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:47.560]  and then they can come along
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:49.560]  and find Ron Paul and Rand Paul and Lord Moncton
[02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:51.560]  exactly and you're quite right
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:53.560]  about that and I fully understand
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:55.560]  your place in the spectrum as it were
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:57.560]  but the point is this
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:18:59.560]  you're doing very good work
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:01.560]  you have a massive audience
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:03.560]  and a diverted audience
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:05.560]  I get correspondence every time
[02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:07.560]  I'm on the air with you because people like
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:09.560]  to hear the Moncton dimension
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:11.560]  of all this and they are now
[02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:13.560]  waiting for leadership
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:15.560]  to go to the next stage
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:17.560]  they're waiting for what we have done
[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:19.560]  in UKIP to be done
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:21.560]  not just in individual
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:23.560]  and the establishment admits
[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:25.560]  they're worried about an American style UKIP
[02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:27.560]  party I mean that's what
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:29.560]  they are with good reason because
[02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:31.560]  if there were one it would have much greater
[02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:33.560]  chance of success than ever it had here
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:35.560]  in the UK because you are
[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:37.560]  instinctive libertarians in the United States
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:39.560]  the vast majority of your population
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:41.560]  are libertarians not of course in the
[02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:43.560]  central cities where they're all on government
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:45.560]  handouts and paid for by Obama
[02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:47.560]  but everybody else
[02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:49.560]  all the working people

[02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:28.560]  is basically brain damaged now
[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:30.560]  I can hardly talk I'm told
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:32.560]  those guys are real
[02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:36.560]  and believe me the establishment
[02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:38.560]  doesn't like it
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:40.560]  the establishment is
[02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:42.560]  is in overdrive
[02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:44.560]  and it's so frustrating
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:46.560]  to see how the big oil companies
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:48.560]  predominantly except for ExxonMobil
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:50.560]  the biggest
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:52.560]  are openly for about 25 years
[02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:54.560]  funding the carbon tax movement
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:56.560]  as Ken lay on record with Al Gore
[02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:58.560]  in 1995
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:00.560]  that had a group of meetings at the White House
[02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:02.560]  more than 20 of them there's documentaries made on this
[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:04.560]  to develop the carbon tax scam
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:06.560]  so I guess that was 19 years ago
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:10.560]  to be technical
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:12.560]  and
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:14.560]  then when I'm against carbon taxes
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:16.560]  and all this you work for the oil companies
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:18.560]  you work for the oil companies
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:20.560]  you work for the oil companies
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:22.560]  the Koch brothers
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:24.560]  I saw some CNN special
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:26.560]  on their website this weekend that was like
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:28.560]  inside billionaire money
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:30.560]  the Koch brothers
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:32.560]  I've had Greg Paulus
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:34.560]  who's a real liberal on
[02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:36.560]  former federal regulator
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:38.560]  he will tell you the Koch brothers
[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:40.560]  give as much money to the Democrats
[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:42.560]  as they do to the Republicans
[02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:44.560]  until about the last decade
[02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:48.560]  when they weren't at the top
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:50.560]  of the globalist food chain as billionaires
[02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:52.560]  so their businesses started getting shut down
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:54.560]  so they started funding
[02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:56.560]  some of the conservative grips
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:58.560]  I get
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:00.560]  zero Koch brother money
[02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:02.560]  but I have people walking me on the street and go
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:04.560]  I know you work for the Koch brothers
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:06.560]  I'm like no it's the Vatican and the Jews
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:08.560]  or the Masons
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:10.560]  I work for justice
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:12.560]  I work for a good future
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:14.560]  I don't want bad mojo, bad karma
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:16.560]  you reap what you sow
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:18.560]  Tony Montana said I have never done anything
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:20.560]  to anybody that didn't have it
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:22.560]  coming to them and I don't enjoy
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:24.560]  going after people that are attacking me
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:26.560]  I'm forced to do it sometimes
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:32.560]  but it's this
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:34.560]  I mean the left has the Rockefellers
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:36.560]  the Rothschilds, George Soros
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:38.560]  Billa Melinda Gates
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:40.560]  Warren Buffett just
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:42.560]  they have everything they're the establishment
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:44.560]  that's where everyone goes along with them
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:46.560]  they have trillions
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:48.560]  and they're like oh should the billionaires
[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:50.560]  be able to give money
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:52.560]  Wall Street
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:54.560]  gave almost two to one
[02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:56.560]  to Obama
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:26:58.560]  in the last two elections
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:00.560]  almost two to one
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:02.560]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:04.560]  and I'm just sick of it, I get zero
[02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:06.560]  money from Wall Street, zero money
[02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:08.560]  from the Koch brothers, zero
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:10.560]  zero zero zero
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:12.560]  zero zero zero
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:14.560]  zero
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:16.560]  and the Democratic Party is drenched
[02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:18.560]  in globalist money with carbon taxes
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:20.560]  and Obamacare that the Republican leadership
[02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:22.560]  is part of, they're all
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:24.560]  in it together
[02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:26.560]  and all they can point at
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:28.560]  is the Koch brothers that literally
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:30.560]  financed Bill Clinton with
[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:32.560]  Tyson
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:36.560]  Don Tyson, what's the chicken king's name
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:38.560]  I still have everything about him, I can't remember
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:40.560]  his name now
[02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:42.560]  and I'm just sick of it
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:44.560]  how they act like
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:46.560]  their anti-establishment
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:48.560]  I tuned into MSNBC last night to see what they're up to
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:50.560]  they were like bashing the big banks
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:52.560]  I mean they're financed by them
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:54.560]  but their solutions weren't returned last eagle
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:56.560]  their solutions weren't right off the derivatives
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:58.560]  their solutions were
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:00.560]  the evil Republicans are in with the big banks
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:02.560]  yeah and so are the Democrats
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:06.560]  you know who isn't for the banker bailouts
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:08.560]  it's the real Tea Party
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:10.560]  Don Tyson, Poultry, Tycoon, Dye's at 80
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:12.560]  I didn't even know that
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:14.560]  when did he die
[02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:16.560]  2011
[02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:18.560]  I wonder
[02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:20.560]  I hadn't heard of Don Tyson in a while
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:24.560]  boy that guy was a gangster
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:26.560]  died at 80
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:28.560]  I mean you talk about a dixie
[02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:30.560]  mafia gangster boy
[02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:32.560]  he was a real
[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:34.560]  deal
[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:38.560]  and there's all these pseudo-intellectuals
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:40.560]  that just run around
[02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:42.560]  and perseverate on one fact
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:44.560]  wait or another and you know
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:46.560]  oh my gosh oh my gosh
[02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:48.560]  you don't want carbon taxes
[02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:50.560]  you don't like Obama
[02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:52.560]  you work for the Koch brothers
[02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:54.560]  we're better than you
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:56.560]  we don't work for the Vatican
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:28:58.560]  like you
[02:28:58.560 --> 02:29:00.560]  we don't work for Israel
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:02.560]  like you
[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:04.560]  we don't work for the Koch brothers
[02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:06.560]  I mean oil companies like you
[02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:08.560]  like you
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:10.560]  riding your horse to work in Texas
[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:14.560]  oh Alex you're pro-gun
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:16.560]  cause you get money from the gun industry
[02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:18.560]  I should be getting money from
[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:20.560]  I should be getting money from the NRA
[02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:22.560]  I should be getting money from
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:24.560]  gun owners of America
[02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:26.560]  I should be getting money from Smith & Wesson
[02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:28.560]  I'll tell you people should be giving
[02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:30.560]  them money
[02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:32.560]  you should be giving money to the pro-gun groups
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:34.560]  because let me tell you something
[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:36.560]  we have a civil war
[02:29:36.560 --> 02:29:38.560]  with them coming after your guns right now
[02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:40.560]  we didn't have Rand Paul and Ted Cruz
[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:42.560]  they would have gotten their gun banned
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:44.560]  last year
[02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:46.560]  these people are coming down on us
[02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:48.560]  and they've got to be defeated
[02:29:48.560 --> 02:30:12.560]  we are on the march the empires on the run
[02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:14.560]  we are partnering this year with the NFL
[02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:16.560]  the NFL has become a political weapon
[02:30:16.560 --> 02:30:18.560]  the second amendment pushes Obamacare
[02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:20.560]  MSNBC tells us that
[02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:22.560]  our children belong to the state
[02:30:22.560 --> 02:30:24.560]  we have to break through our kind of private idea
[02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:26.560]  that kids belong to their parents
[02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:28.560]  or kids belong to their families
[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:30.560]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities
[02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:32.560]  it is more important than ever to realize
[02:30:32.560 --> 02:30:34.560]  that we are not the alternative media
[02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:36.560]  we are the true media
[02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:38.560]  the establishment dinosaur press is dying

[02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:42.560]  and we are losing that war

[02:31:40.560 --> 02:31:42.560]  if we don't all stand up right now

[02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:30.560]  we can turn the tide against the eugenicist
[02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:32.560]  by giving ourselves the nutrients

[02:33:34.560 --> 02:34:00.560]  This is what you want, this is what you get.
[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:12.560]  You want a 100 square foot coffin apartment where they can charge a 90% property tax?
[02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:14.560]  They're gonna do it.
[02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:19.560]  As long as it's trendy, uh, trendy.
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:21.560]  Mayor Bloomberg says so.
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:26.560]  So in Austin, San Francisco and New York,
[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:31.560]  they're coming in and saying we'll only give you a housing authorization to build buildings
[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:38.560]  under a Gen 21 that have 200 square foot multi-person dwellings.
[02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:45.560]  The individuals get 100 square foot and they're now saying those are too lavish.
[02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:50.560]  And again, the general public thinks of it from the perspective of a nice person because you're nice people.
[02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:55.560]  You're like, well, what's wrong with folks having 200 square feet if that's all they can afford?
[02:34:55.560 --> 02:34:57.560]  I'm gonna explain this again.
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:04.560]  In their own actuaries, they want, as renter owners like Bloomberg, they want to charge you more for less.
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:06.560]  I'm gonna say that again.
[02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:09.560]  That's what feudalism is.
[02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:17.560]  While they who steal all the money live in giant palatial facilities, in most cases that are exempt,
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:21.560]  they run the bureaucracy.
[02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:24.560]  That's the New World Order.
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:26.560]  And they're just a bunch of crooks.
[02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:28.560]  They're not liberals.
[02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:34.560]  I am so sick of Angelina Jolie and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and all of them.
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:42.560]  These people are sickening filth on their moral high horses trying to run my life and your life.
[02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:45.560]  I've had enough of Merkel.
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:49.560]  I've had enough of Hollandaise sauce in France.
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:51.560]  I've had enough of Cameron.
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:56.560]  I've had enough of Boner, all of them.
[02:35:56.560 --> 02:36:02.560]  These people are running our civilization into the ground and they can't believe how successful they've been robbing everyone.
[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:10.560]  So they're festooning secret police everywhere in armored vehicles and helicopters and checkpoints and 25 million bullets for the TSA
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:17.560]  and every form of out of control insanity you could imagine because no one has stood up to them.
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:27.560]  We've all run into people in our lives that we let push us around to the point of they just go completely out of control.
[02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:33.560]  And they do this mind game where they sit there and intimidate us until we just think that that's the way it is.
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:35.560]  It's not supposed to be that way.
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:37.560]  And I'm not trying to get angry today.
[02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:39.560]  I just look at all this news.
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:41.560]  I got hundreds of articles I haven't even covered yet.
[02:36:41.560 --> 02:36:46.560]  And it brutally makes me angry.
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:56.560]  I mean, every 10 minutes while we've been talking, while I've been talking, it just pops in my head that JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association,
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:02.560]  came out and said, your patients are insane if they believe in conspiracy theories.
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:16.560]  And then as God, they said that, and by as God as if what they say is just fact, that cell phones aren't linked to brain cancer.
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:26.560]  Anyone that is worried about cell phones is a raving lunatic who needs to be locked up in an insane asylum.
[02:37:26.560 --> 02:37:30.560]  They call it health behaviors and a sign that you're mentally ill.
[02:37:30.560 --> 02:37:34.560]  You know what, JAMA? You're a bunch of kleptocratic scum.
[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:41.560]  And there are literally over a thousand mainline prestigious studies saying it's massively increasing different types of brain tumors.
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:50.560]  London Guardian this week said, if you use a cell phone 15 hours a week, you are more than double the chance of getting one type of brain tumor alone.
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:55.560]  You people are criminals, okay?
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:38:02.560]  You're just like the people back in the 40s and 50s with TV ads, and we've pulled these up before we could probably find them.
[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:12.560]  Going, Kent cigarettes, you know, doctors recommend four out of five doctors recommend Kent cigarettes if you've got a sore throat, helps the lungs.
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:16.560]  Feeling down, having got a cough, smoke more camels.
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:22.560]  You know what, my grandmother and my grandfather both basically died from lung cancer, one of them from complications from it.
[02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:27.560]  And you know what, I don't want the government involved then if you want to smoke them, that's your issue.
[02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:37.560]  But let me tell you something, those cigarette companies knew in the 20s in rat studies with smoke pumped in that it was giving them lung cancer, okay?
[02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:44.560]  And you know, I mean, I'll be honest, I have an instinct to want to kick those scientists butts.
[02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:52.560]  There it is, 20,679 physicians say luckies are less irritating.
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:39:02.560]  It's toasted, your throat protection against irritation and against cough, lucky strikes from the 1930s, a drugstore ad.
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:05.560]  We just put it on screen if you're a radio listener.
[02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:08.560]  You know, Barney Rubble, he's got a sore throat, he smokes a cigarette.
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:13.560]  I mean, I'm ready to kick, I mean, and again, I'm not saying I'm a tough guy, I want to kick butt.
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:16.560]  I want to turn the table over right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:26.560]  Now scientific evidence on effects of smoking, Chesterfield helps your lungs.
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:35.560]  You understand the tobacco plant pulls up radioactive isotopes out of the soils that are in volcanic soils that tobacco grows well in.
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:41.560]  And that if you smoke a pack of cigarettes a day for 20 years, it's the equivalent of living inside Chernobyl for a year.
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:45.560]  And I boil that down to a layman's statement, but that's basically what I've read.
[02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:46.560]  You can look it up.
[02:39:46.560 --> 02:39:49.560]  Look up radioactive isotopes in tobacco.
[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:52.560]  And again, folks, I have smoked cigarettes.
[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:54.560]  I have chewed tobacco.
[02:39:54.560 --> 02:39:56.560]  I have, I played baseball.
[02:39:56.560 --> 02:40:04.560]  And I mean, I'm going to tell you, the coaches let you chew tobacco when I was like, you know, 12 years old, if I was playing baseball.
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:05.560]  Leave, I get it.
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:07.560]  We would take it with us and stick it in our mouth.
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:10.560]  Okay, so listen, I'm not on some kick here.
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:12.560]  If you want to smoke tobacco, that's your issue.
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:16.560]  My thing is it's a load of crap that it's good for you.
[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:19.560]  And Philip Morris used the same propaganda.
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:31.560]  We just showed a Philip Morris magazine ad from the 40s that it's scientific that global warming, you know, 9,000 million scientists all agree.
[02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:32.560]  It's imminent.
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:38.560]  You're dead if you don't pay Al Gore money and shut down your power plants and move into China that are totally dirty.
[02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:40.560]  You know, all scientists agree.
[02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:44.560]  No one believes that humans aren't causing global warming and we're all dead.
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:46.560]  We don't pay Al Gore money.
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:48.560]  It's a total hoax.
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:49.560]  And I know you know that.
[02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:52.560]  Can we play the everything is wonderful one liner intro.
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:58.560]  Put the guys down and our Oxford affiliate made for us.
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:40:59.560]  We like that.
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:07.560]  By the way, if you're an affiliate and you got great promo people there, you are welcome to send it to show tips or our producers have done get to us and send it five times.
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:08.560]  We'll get it.
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:09.560]  It's not the cruise fault.
[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:13.560]  We just get I don't know what time exaggerate 15,000 emails a day or something on a big day.
[02:41:13.560 --> 02:41:15.560]  It's like sometimes like 2000.
[02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:27.560]  But the point is it varies and a lot of station promos we've been sent and you can put your station in the promo will air that as well as part of the promo for this show.
[02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:33.560]  There's a little idea there and so many listeners on YouTube and info wars getting mad at me.
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:39.560]  I see this. I'm just getting this out there like Alex and respond to my email and I'm mad at him or Alex didn't get back with us on this.
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:40.560]  I'm overwhelmed.
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:44.560]  I apologize.
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:46.560]  I mean, I can't even cover any of this news at this point.
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:48.560]  I just did it.
[02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:51.560]  It makes me too upset.
[02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:53.560]  I'm not lying to people.
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:56.560]  They put cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:42:06.560]  The the the microwave ovens are splattering your whole kitchen with radiation that's on record and frying the food.
[02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:15.560]  The statistics all show it the intestinal disorders, the bowel disorders, the brain disorders, the blood disorders, the lung disorders.
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:24.560]  I mean, we are dying and it's only just begun because our life cycle 74 years.
[02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:29.560]  Reproductive cycle on average is about 20.
[02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:36.560]  Guinea pigs within three cycles are 99% sterile when they're fed one type of Monsanto GMO corn in a major study.
[02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:37.560]  You look it up.
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:43.560]  We sell books that have all studies and the rats and the rest of it, the rats, the guinea pigs, sustainment all the mammals,
[02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:47.560]  hair growing on their mouth, testicles on top of their heads.
[02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:51.560]  I mean, listen, we're down two generations into this is just begun.
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:53.560]  We're dead already.
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:43:01.560]  No one's spock and wrapped of con knows that the ship's not going to make it if he doesn't get out of the reactor and save everybody.
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:05.560]  And then they're about to open the compartment when he's been radiated and they say you can't help him.
[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:07.560]  He's dead already.
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:13.560]  I'm telling you, folks, what we're doing now is just so some remnant of us makes it.
[02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:14.560]  Okay.
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:16.560]  That's why the globalists don't care.
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:19.560]  They're already about to go into the third generation of killing us.
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:22.560]  Soon it's going to be half the babies are born retarded.
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:26.560]  Soon it's going to be hell on earth with these people.
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:32.560]  They are literally shoving us into a meat grinder.
[02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:37.560]  And there's all these old trendy cult members everywhere telling me everything's awesome.
[02:43:37.560 --> 02:43:38.560]  Everything's great.
[02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:42.560]  No, it's not.
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:47.560]  And you know, people like we're mocking is a great guy can get on and he knows I can take it and I like it.
[02:43:47.560 --> 02:43:51.560]  I don't mind it.
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:56.560]  You know, and saying, well, you do go off into space sometimes.
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:58.560]  Well, we are in space, folks.
[02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:04.560]  And I know the enemy program and I've studied it and I'm going to say how horrible it is.
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:32.560]  Look at how successful you kept spin by not compromising.
[02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:46.560]  Oh my gosh, I love this song.
[02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:48.560]  You know what the globalists are always talking about?
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:51.560]  I mean, I saw it just a few months ago.
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:56.560]  Who was the world leader a few months ago said, you know, if aliens invaded the earth, it would help unify us for world government.
[02:44:56.560 --> 02:44:58.560]  It was like all over the newspapers.
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:44:59.560]  I forget who said it.
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:03.560]  But Ronald Reagan said it first chef said it.
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:05.560]  Clinton just said it a few weeks ago.
[02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:07.560]  That's who said it. See if you can queue it up.
[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:08.560]  It was Clinton.
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:09.560]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:10.560]  Bill Clinton.
[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:11.560]  Good memory.
[02:45:11.560 --> 02:45:16.560]  See, Jack couldn't remember that.
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:17.560]  Who was the other one?
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:21.560]  Yeltsin said it.
[02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:23.560]  Who was the guy before Yeltsin?
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:26.560]  I'm just having one of those moments right now.
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:27.560]  Gorbachev.
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:28.560]  Yeah, they all say it.
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:30.560]  Well, if aliens invaded, there it is.
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:32.560]  Bill Clinton, alien attack would unite us.
[02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:34.560]  I probed area 51.
[02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:37.560]  Area 51 is a toxic waste dump.
[02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:38.560]  Mainly.
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:44.560]  And then they've got black ops space aircraft there and that was declassified this year.
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:47.560]  And they were like, oh, you conspiracy theorists are discredited.
[02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:48.560]  There aren't aliens.
[02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:51.560]  I'm not the people saying there's aliens out there.
[02:45:51.560 --> 02:45:57.560]  I've been saying for 19 years on air, it's a skunk works operation.
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:00.560]  And now it's admitted.
[02:46:00.560 --> 02:46:08.560]  But the point is, there's obviously Bill Clinton on the Tonight Show talking about that.
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:11.560]  And that's the kind of stuff they fantasize about is having the outside threat.
[02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:14.560]  But let's say there was some outside threat.
[02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:17.560]  I would be for humanity unifying against it.
[02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:35.560]  I'm not for the humanity unifying and using our instinct to unify to be under these tyrants.
[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:41.560]  And it's just these people do not have our best interest at heart and they are flagrantly anti-human.
[02:46:41.560 --> 02:46:45.560]  And just like perverts get off on defiling innocent children.
[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:50.560]  The globalists get off on defiling humanity, defiling the plants, the animals.
[02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:57.560]  The globalists are butchering the Earth's genetic code and biosphere, doing irreparable harm.
[02:46:57.560 --> 02:47:04.560]  And then saying it doesn't matter, we will race ahead of the problems we've created with the singularity and fix it all.
[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:07.560]  If we were visited someday, I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:12.560]  I just hope that it's not like Independence Day.
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:17.560]  Yeah, right. That it's, you know, a conflict.
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:22.560]  Well, now we have the only way to unite this incredibly divided world of ours.
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:27.560]  Yeah, I love how they try to divide us so they can control us and then bitch and complain and say,
[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:30.560]  you need to do what we say and be united.
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:34.560]  We've divided you, dumbed you down, got you fighting over all this bull.
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:39.560]  And then now you need to follow us, Bill Clinton.
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:44.560]  Just a total miscreant dirt bag.
[02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:48.560]  I didn't take any calls today. I'm going to try to take a lot of calls tomorrow.
[02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:51.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's get you have to back it up though.
[02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:55.560]  It's when he says he's dead already. That's my analogy.
[02:47:55.560 --> 02:47:57.560]  But good job finding that clip so quick.
[02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:00.560]  It's when he goes down into the reactor and he's going to try to get him out and save him.
[02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:03.560]  He goes, look, he's dead already.
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:06.560]  And that's why people need to just get over death.
[02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:16.560]  Even if they weren't hitting us with anthropogenic soft killed weapons at every level,
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:19.560]  you're going to die just like when you were five.
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:23.560]  You never thought Christmas was coming in three months to get that new bike, but it came.
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:27.560]  And then now a year goes by like a week, but by when you were five years old,
[02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:30.560]  you're going to die. You're going to have a heart attack driving up.
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:34.560]  There are people listening to this show right now that will die this week.
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:37.560]  Millions of listeners, you're going to, you're going to have a stroke and die.
[02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:39.560]  You're going to have a heart attack. You're going to die in a car wreck.
[02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:42.560]  You're going to be t boned this week.
[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:44.560]  Some of you listening are going to be dead.
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:46.560]  How are you going to live your life?
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:48.560]  What are you going to do now?
[02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:54.560]  Because I'm telling you, the whole species is going down the tubes with a bunch of psychopaths
[02:48:54.560 --> 02:48:57.560]  who think they're gods and better than us is separate.
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:48:59.560]  Oh, they're, they're separate. All right.
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:02.560]  They are psychopaths. They are sociopaths.
[02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:06.560]  They are fearful cowards that lust after power.
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:15.560]  It's a different mix and combination of these people, but they are the scum of the earth.
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:19.560]  And if you don't learn to recognize them as new listeners,
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:22.560]  if we don't become radicalized against them, it's over.
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:27.560]  Okay. They will win because they're unified and they're crazy.
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:31.560]  It's crazy to go on air and say your kids belong to the state MSNBC.
[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:34.560]  It's crazy to say it's racist.
[02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:40.560]  As J. Rockefeller said, if you don't accept Obamacare, it's crazy to say if you built a business, you didn't build it.
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:46.560]  It's crazy to try to give newborn babies dozens of shots on record that are dumbing them down.
[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:50.560]  It's crazy to put hydrofluorosolicy acid in the water.
[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:51.560]  It's crazy.
[02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:54.560]  By the way, speaking of that, I just keep meaning to say this.
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:50:06.560]  If a fraction of our audience would just buy the Pro Pure G2 filters that are the best gravity fed stainless steel filters out there to cut the glyphosates, those fluoride, all of it, blow away the competition,
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:12.560]  we could fund an incredible operation that would literally go to the next level pretty much instantly.
[02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:14.560]  I'm not complaining. You've been very supportive. We appreciate it.
[02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:20.560]  But this is the highest quality filters, the best out there, the lowest price you need it.
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:24.560]  How many of you are procrastinating to still let your kids drink tap water?
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:27.560]  How many of you haven't put a shower filter around and got some of the best prices on those?
[02:50:27.560 --> 02:50:28.560]  How many of you?
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:29.560]  It's a win-win.
[02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:32.560]  You fund their operation and you buy high quality filters.
[02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:33.560]  Stop procrastinating.
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:36.560]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.

[02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:26.560]  You can't change chance and listen. Another kiss.

[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:35.560]  Another kiss.
[02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:39.560]  How will this move on? There's so much to this.
[02:54:39.560 --> 02:54:45.560]  The days are bright and filled with pain.
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:50.560]  And close me in your gentle rain.
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:55:00.560]  The time you ran was too insane.
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:04.560]  We'll meet again. We'll meet again.
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:11.560]  That's far 20 says. You'd rather cry, I'd rather fly.
[02:55:11.560 --> 02:55:19.560]  The crystal ship is being filled.
[02:55:19.560 --> 02:55:23.560]  Yeah, by the way, speaking of artificial scarcity, a lowering of standard of living,
[02:55:23.560 --> 02:55:27.560]  200 square foot coffin apartments that cost would have 5,000 square foot width,
[02:55:27.560 --> 02:55:30.560]  you know, 10 years ago.
[02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:36.560]  So government and the globalist can control more and more.
[02:55:36.560 --> 02:55:42.560]  Texas town close to toilet to tap loop is this our future water supply.
[02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:47.560]  And they go on to say that Austin has been doing such a good job saving water
[02:55:47.560 --> 02:55:50.560]  that we're not going to get toilet water recycled.
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:54.560]  And again, it's good to save water and not waste it.
[02:55:54.560 --> 02:56:01.560]  But they just want you to not waste it to double triple charge you.
[02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:06.560]  Lake Travis they give more water than the rice farmers want. I don't want to get off in a jag about this.
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:09.560]  I've got all the serious geopolitical news to hit.
[02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:16.560]  But briefly folks, here's that clip from the parable or allegory.
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:22.560]  What's the proper term to describe it where I connect some real world event to something in fiction.
[02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:26.560]  A parallel drawing a parallel to wrath of con.
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:29.560]  I'm not really a big Star Trek fan, but that's the best Star Trek movie in my opinion.
[02:56:29.560 --> 02:56:34.560]  Is wrath of con is actually pretty entertaining because I like like the actors involved was the Hispanic actor.
[02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:37.560]  He was on Phantasy Island. He's a great actor.
[02:56:37.560 --> 02:56:40.560]  Yes, Ricardo Montabond. Is he still alive?
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:46.560]  The guy's amazing. Anyways, I see some of the old movies in the 40s and 50s and 60s. That guy's a really good actor.
[02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:50.560]  Anyways, long story short, we're dead already in the new world order.
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:53.560]  It's a future without humans. The end of us.
[02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:56.560]  We're going to just roll over to whatever the mainstream television says.
[02:56:56.560 --> 02:57:01.560]  Are we real? Can we get outside of it and realize that if we don't stop this, there's no future?
[02:57:01.560 --> 02:57:04.560]  The whole ship of humanity is going to go down. Here's the clip.
[02:57:09.560 --> 02:57:11.560]  He's dead. Montabond's dead. It's too bad.
[02:57:14.560 --> 02:57:17.560]  See Spock in the radiation chamber tries to go in.
[02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:20.560]  No, you'll flood the whole compartment tonight.
[02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:28.560]  He's dead already. It's too late.
[02:57:31.560 --> 02:57:39.560]  But again, the globalists sell us on the idea that, oh, you need to give yourself up to the collective to defend humanity.
[02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:46.560]  Well, yes, individually, you can make the decision for humanity to do whatever it takes to help others.
[02:57:46.560 --> 02:57:52.560]  That's a normal instinct that God gave us. But they take our prime directive to do unto others as we have them do unto us
[02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:56.560]  and lay down your life for your brother, Christ's golden rule.
[02:57:56.560 --> 02:58:03.560]  And they turn it around and say, give up everything for the collective, but that's only giving into their evil plan.
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:09.560]  They're not actually trying to get you to sacrifice yourself and your freedom to build a better world.
[02:58:09.560 --> 02:58:11.560]  They're dealing it because they're a bunch of greedy bastards.
[02:58:11.560 --> 02:58:19.560]  When Obama tells Africa, you can't have air-conditioning your cars. You need to be poor when you just get 15 aircraft land
[02:58:19.560 --> 02:58:25.560]  and it's $50 million a day and red carpets and all these stupid Hollywood people.
[02:58:27.560 --> 02:58:30.560]  People say, oh, you just don't like Hollywood because you haven't been accepted by it.
[02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:34.560]  Hey, I'm nationwide like ZZ Topps says. Dallas, Texas, Hollywood.
[02:58:34.560 --> 02:58:40.560]  I could be in movies all over the place right now, ladies and gentlemen, and I have refused it
[02:58:40.560 --> 02:58:46.560]  because it's crap. It's dirty rags. I want history. I want freedom. I want to go to the stars.
[02:58:46.560 --> 02:58:50.560]  I want you to win and I want scum to be trodden underfoot.
[02:58:50.560 --> 02:58:58.560]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:05.560]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[02:59:05.560 --> 02:59:10.560]  and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:59:10.560 --> 02:59:13.560]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:59:13.560 --> 02:59:17.560]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:59:17.560 --> 02:59:22.560]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:59:22.560 --> 02:59:27.560]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[02:59:27.560 --> 02:59:32.560]  in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:59:32.560 --> 02:59:37.560]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[02:59:37.560 --> 02:59:43.560]  The new InfoWarsLife Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:59:43.560 --> 03:00:02.560]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:00:13.560 --> 03:00:31.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.560 --> 03:00:36.560]  There is definitely an agenda. I talked about it earlier with Bill Clinton and the globalist
[03:00:36.560 --> 03:00:39.560]  and the Vatican's been saying get ready for aliens and all this stuff.
[03:00:39.560 --> 03:00:45.560]  Have aliens already visited Earth? NASA books suggest that ancient rock art could have been created by extraterrestrials.
[03:00:45.560 --> 03:00:48.560]  That's directly out of Prometheus.
[03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:52.560]  Each month a new planet is discovered that bears similarities to our own and is becoming increasingly apparent.
[03:00:52.560 --> 03:00:55.560]  Earth is not unique.
[03:00:55.560 --> 03:01:01.560]  Well of course Earth is unique itself. A dead planet is unique.
[03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:04.560]  But see that's sold like we're not unique.
[03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:09.560]  But you mean unique in that there's not planets that could have life? Yes.
[03:01:09.560 --> 03:01:13.560]  So it stands to reason that of the billions of Earth-like planets,
[03:01:13.560 --> 03:01:19.560]  but we're worried about Angelina Jolie and her collagen injections and her ugly-looking lips.
[03:01:19.560 --> 03:01:22.560]  It's like a baboon's butt or something. I'm sorry.
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:25.560]  So it stands to reason. I'm serious. What an ugly witch.
[03:01:25.560 --> 03:01:31.560]  I'm just being honest. I'm just sick of these people. I can't even look at their chicken neck scum.
[03:01:31.560 --> 03:01:35.560]  So it stands to reason of the billions of Earth-like planets in our galaxy alone.
[03:01:35.560 --> 03:01:39.560]  There might be another that hosts life.
[03:01:39.560 --> 03:01:43.560]  It's a thought that is gaining more credence all the time.
[03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:55.560]  And now NASA has released a fascinating book detailing how or if we might communicate with some of these worlds.
[03:01:55.560 --> 03:01:57.560]  So that's been sold.
[03:01:57.560 --> 03:02:00.560]  But obviously it's intriguing. I mean no wonder people are getting into it.
[03:02:00.560 --> 03:02:02.560]  There's no subject discussion of that sometimes.
[03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:04.560]  I hear some of the other seriousness.
[03:02:04.560 --> 03:02:11.560]  BBC, how do you turn that into a pedophile acronym?
[03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:13.560]  There's so many pedophiles there.
[03:02:13.560 --> 03:02:18.560]  I don't know.
[03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:25.560]  The Boys Bondage Club is not about torturing children though,
[03:02:25.560 --> 03:02:28.560]  but that is quick and good that you came up with that, CJ.
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:34.560]  Russia and China veto UN moves to refer Syria to ICC.
[03:02:34.560 --> 03:02:43.560]  Russia and China have vetoed a UN Security Council revolution that would have referred the conflict in Syria to the International Criminal Court,
[03:02:43.560 --> 03:02:49.560]  saying that Assad's an international criminal when he wasn't persecuting his people compared to other people in the region,
[03:02:49.560 --> 03:02:52.560]  and when he was fighting al-Qaeda.
[03:02:52.560 --> 03:02:55.560]  More than 60 countries supported the French draft.
[03:02:55.560 --> 03:02:58.560]  The frogs are leading this. What does that tell you?
[03:02:58.560 --> 03:03:01.560]  Nothing against the French, but they're using it not even pro-war.
[03:03:01.560 --> 03:03:03.560]  I mean this is sick.
[03:03:03.560 --> 03:03:09.560]  More than 60 countries supported the French draft and tax calling for an investigation to alleged war crimes being committed by both sides,
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:13.560]  including chemical attacks that they're blaming on Assad.
[03:03:13.560 --> 03:03:18.560]  German party accused of neo-Nazi traits set for EU parliament.
[03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:21.560]  They're trying to ban whole parties now if they're nationalistic.
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:26.560]  Well, better watch out, because when the globalists want to have a Nazi party that's real in Ukraine, that's okay,
[03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:31.560]  because George Soros runs it, funds it along with the State Department.
[03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:37.560]  But they want to demonize groups like UKIP, you name it, or myself, and say we're Nazis with no evidence.
[03:03:37.560 --> 03:03:44.560]  So it's a very dangerous attempt to shut down political parties.
[03:03:44.560 --> 03:03:51.560]  And the Russians, of course, have this obsession with hating Germans and then trying to equate it with Nazis,
[03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:54.560]  because that's such a big war with them and millions lost.
[03:03:54.560 --> 03:04:00.560]  The RT says, high old tolerance, Nazi salute, okay, in Switzerland if it's not political.
[03:04:00.560 --> 03:04:06.560]  Listen, if you don't give people the right to do that, they'll take everybody else's right.
[03:04:06.560 --> 03:04:13.560]  A true liberal supports everyone's right as long as you don't call for violence against somebody else, okay?
[03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:19.560]  So that's what's going on there is a real push.
[03:04:19.560 --> 03:04:25.560]  You have this sick relationship with Russia and some of the left in the EU to try to make it the new Soviet Union.
[03:04:25.560 --> 03:04:28.560]  It's got to be watched as well.
[03:04:28.560 --> 03:04:31.560]  So that's some of the news on that.
[03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:32.560]  I'm going to get to this.
[03:04:32.560 --> 03:04:36.560]  AP Exclusive Air Force Security failed nuke test.
[03:04:36.560 --> 03:04:43.560]  Armed security forces at a nuclear missile base at a drill last summer that simulated the hostile takeover missile launch,
[03:04:43.560 --> 03:04:49.560]  because they were unable to speedily regain control of the captured nuclear weapon according to internal Air Force review obtained by the Associated Press.
[03:04:49.560 --> 03:04:55.560]  That was the Maelstrom Air Force missile wing, the 341st missile wing.
[03:04:55.560 --> 03:04:57.560]  All right, nightly news tonight, 7.
[03:04:57.560 --> 03:04:58.560]  I'll be back tomorrow.
[03:04:58.560 --> 03:05:08.560]  Lord willing.
