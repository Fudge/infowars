[00:00.000 --> 00:09.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, the 21st day of August 2018.
[00:09.040 --> 00:11.000]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:11.000 --> 00:14.920]  They now have officially announced that Facebook and the rest of Silicon Valley are bringing
[00:14.920 --> 00:18.640]  the Chinese social score that face scans you everywhere you go to America.
[00:18.640 --> 00:20.520]  They will control your banking, everything.
[00:20.520 --> 00:21.520]  That is now all confirmed.
[00:21.520 --> 00:22.520]  It's on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:22.520 --> 00:26.560]  We're going to be breaking it down, but first let's look at this key boil down of the war
[00:26.560 --> 00:27.560]  on free speech.
[00:27.560 --> 00:28.560]  Here it is.
[00:28.560 --> 00:32.880]  As you've probably heard, recently many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated
[00:32.880 --> 00:37.560]  effort to censor content from broadcaster Alex Jones, because it looks like his website
[00:37.560 --> 00:40.920]  InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[00:40.920 --> 00:43.320]  Yesterday, yep.
[00:43.320 --> 00:51.440]  Apple, Facebook, Spotify, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, all of them pulled or froze Jones'
[00:51.440 --> 00:55.560]  accounts on the grounds that his views are too dangerous to be heard publicly.
[00:55.560 --> 00:59.800]  Oh, it's easy to dismiss concerns about big tech's actions.
[00:59.800 --> 01:04.240]  All coordinated, it seems, to shut down Jones, because, of course, he's the media's poster
[01:04.240 --> 01:06.480]  child for conspiracy theories.
[01:06.480 --> 01:10.640]  Court hearings will resume today in lawsuits against radio host and conspiracy theorist
[01:10.640 --> 01:11.640]  Alex Jones.
[01:11.640 --> 01:12.640]  Alex Jones.
[01:12.640 --> 01:13.640]  Alex Jones.
[01:13.640 --> 01:14.640]  InfoWars.
[01:14.640 --> 01:15.640]  InfoWars.
[01:15.640 --> 01:16.640]  Alex Jones.
[01:16.640 --> 01:17.640]  From InfoWars.
[01:17.640 --> 01:18.640]  InfoWars.
[01:18.640 --> 01:21.200]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[01:21.200 --> 01:26.200]  Alex Jones, obviously, is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[01:26.200 --> 01:30.520]  I know we're supposed to think that Alex Jones is way more radical than, like, Bill Maher,
[01:30.520 --> 01:35.160]  Michelle Wall for Rosie O'Donnell, but he's got a point of view, and CNN is trying to
[01:35.160 --> 01:36.720]  swelch his point of view.
[01:36.720 --> 01:39.800]  Did Twitter make mistakes around Alex Jones' InfoWars?
[01:39.800 --> 01:46.040]  At the time, we did not receive reports that we felt we could take any action that violated
[01:46.040 --> 01:47.040]  on our terms of service.
[01:47.040 --> 01:52.080]  Your colleagues, as CNN pointed out, a number of them, we took action on one, and then we
[01:52.080 --> 01:58.880]  noticed that all the others, likely because they were made known to Alex Jones and InfoWars,
[01:58.880 --> 01:59.880]  were being deleted.
[01:59.880 --> 02:02.760]  But this isn't about Alex Jones.
[02:02.760 --> 02:09.280]  This is about freedom, and our access to information from the sources we, as individuals, trust
[02:09.280 --> 02:10.280]  and like.
[02:10.280 --> 02:14.280]  The left, which seeks to crush anything it can control, applauded the news.
[02:14.280 --> 02:16.360]  I think Alex Jones is disgusting.
[02:16.360 --> 02:18.080]  I think the things he said are awful.
[02:18.080 --> 02:19.320]  He makes me physically sick.
[02:19.320 --> 02:23.040]  With that being said, he does have the ear of the president, and he has six million people
[02:23.040 --> 02:26.360]  that listened to him, and I would like people out there to know that there is a segment
[02:26.360 --> 02:27.840]  of the population that's drawn to this.
[02:27.840 --> 02:31.000]  We have a problem in this country, and I would like him to be exposed.
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.880]  Alex Jones promotes conspiracy theories and foments hatred of media.
[02:34.880 --> 02:37.480]  I don't like giving people like Alex Jones a platform.
[02:37.480 --> 02:41.520]  He's one of those guys who believes that Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[02:41.520 --> 02:44.000]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true.
[02:44.000 --> 02:51.240]  Yesterday, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Spotify all erased most of the posts and videos on
[02:51.240 --> 02:53.640]  their services from Alex Jones.
[02:53.640 --> 02:58.520]  So if we're gone, we're out of there.
[02:58.520 --> 03:03.560]  Why are the most powerful companies in the world suddenly so threatened by an independent
[03:03.560 --> 03:08.560]  radio show host in Texas that they're willing to lose business in order to make him shut
[03:08.560 --> 03:09.560]  up?
[03:09.560 --> 03:13.680]  For many on the left, the views seem to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent
[03:13.680 --> 03:14.680]  them from speaking.
[03:14.680 --> 03:17.120]  And Jones is hardly their only target, that's for sure.
[03:17.120 --> 03:21.480]  Virtually every day, the big tech companies censor someone else whose political opinions
[03:21.480 --> 03:22.480]  they disagree with.
[03:22.480 --> 03:28.360]  Facebook censor our free speech, and shame on the ones that don't even seem that we
[03:28.360 --> 03:29.360]  have been censored.
[03:29.360 --> 03:30.840]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[03:30.840 --> 03:32.840]  They just killed our stream.
[03:32.840 --> 03:33.840]  Really?
[03:33.840 --> 03:34.840]  Yep.
[03:34.840 --> 03:35.840]  Why?
[03:35.840 --> 03:36.840]  Community guidelines.
[03:36.840 --> 03:37.840]  Wow.
[03:37.840 --> 03:39.360]  We can't even show his footage.
[03:39.360 --> 03:46.720]  Alex Jones, who is not my friend, and who tells crazy lies about me, is thrown off Twitter,
[03:46.720 --> 03:49.160]  I think, and Facebook, and a few other platforms.
[03:49.160 --> 03:50.160]  I think he's kind of good.
[03:50.160 --> 03:51.160]  Thank God!
[03:51.160 --> 03:57.160]  Well, if you're a liberal, you're supposed to be for free speech.
[03:57.160 --> 03:59.520]  That's free speech for the speech you hate.
[03:59.520 --> 04:01.000]  That's what free speech means.
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.080]  Our establishment crushes dissent not because our establishment is strong, but because
[04:05.080 --> 04:06.880]  it is weak and afraid.
[04:06.880 --> 04:10.840]  They're the ones in control, and they're the ultimate censors at universities, the media,
[04:10.840 --> 04:11.840]  everywhere.
[04:11.840 --> 04:12.840]  They're monsters.
[04:12.840 --> 04:17.160]  And now they want you completely banned from all new forms of digital communication.
[04:17.160 --> 04:20.320]  Elites aren't afraid of what Alex Jones says, Krieger writes.
[04:20.320 --> 04:22.720]  They're terrified that it's popular.
[04:22.720 --> 04:24.760]  Trump didn't divide American society.
[04:24.760 --> 04:30.360]  Alex Jones didn't cause our widespread, and by the way, justified distrust in institutions.
[04:30.360 --> 04:31.360]  Elites did that.
[04:31.360 --> 04:35.800]  Trump's election and Alex Jones's popularity are merely symptoms of a corrupt and failed
[04:35.800 --> 04:36.800]  status quo.
[04:36.800 --> 04:39.520]  If people know what's true, they can smell it.
[04:39.520 --> 04:41.800]  You can't stop them from knowing that.
[04:41.800 --> 04:50.320]  All right, we're going to launch the main transmission in T-minus 60 seconds after this
[04:50.320 --> 04:53.840]  break initiates.
[04:53.840 --> 04:56.800]  Initiate countdown for launch.
[04:56.800 --> 05:00.400]  This is the most censored transmission on the planet.
[05:00.400 --> 05:01.400]  We knew it was coming.
[05:01.400 --> 05:03.400]  The whole thing was for me leg.
[05:03.400 --> 05:08.680]  Just demonize info wars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[05:08.680 --> 05:14.000]  to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.520]  children and Islamophobia.
[05:16.520 --> 05:22.740]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms
[05:22.740 --> 05:27.020]  where we were all in the top five or top 10 news feeds.
[05:27.020 --> 05:33.120]  Go to infowars.com, forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link
[05:33.120 --> 05:37.080]  or whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[05:37.080 --> 05:41.240]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter and give us your
[05:41.240 --> 05:45.480]  emails so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our
[05:45.480 --> 05:46.480]  own platform.
[05:46.480 --> 05:51.520]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com, forward slash show, how they can download
[05:51.520 --> 05:56.200]  the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information
[05:56.200 --> 06:04.040]  point out, this is the verboten info, this is what they don't want you to see.
[06:04.040 --> 06:10.440]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[06:10.440 --> 06:16.280]  the info war.
[06:16.280 --> 06:22.800]  We're only 77 days out from the most important election in UF history and many could argue
[06:22.800 --> 06:26.720]  the most important election in world history.
[06:26.720 --> 06:32.600]  America is ground zero for the battle for the future of humanity for the globalist fight
[06:32.600 --> 06:42.000]  ragtag vans of pro-America, pro-liberty, pro-western, pro-god individuals.
[06:42.000 --> 06:43.000]  It's here.
[06:43.000 --> 06:44.000]  It's happening now.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.800]  The Democrats are all over the place preparing violence.
[06:46.800 --> 06:50.240]  They're all over the place preparing to have illegal aliens vote.
[06:50.240 --> 06:53.400]  They're having all these city legalized illegal aliens voting, they're handing them out voter
[06:53.400 --> 06:55.440]  registration cards.
[06:55.440 --> 07:00.100]  They are weaponizing the universities, completely weaponizing the already fake news media into
[07:00.100 --> 07:05.480]  mafia stalking syndicates to stalk myself and everyone else that stands up for what's
[07:05.480 --> 07:09.240]  right and to slander and defame the American people.
[07:09.240 --> 07:12.360]  The news is now ratcheting up.
[07:12.360 --> 07:15.680]  Their propaganda of the fake news media that everyone's being violent to them and they're
[07:15.680 --> 07:20.000]  getting death threats from the New York Times, the CNN, they're misquoting me and thousands
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.160]  of publications everywhere saying that I said use battle rifles on the media.
[07:25.160 --> 07:34.880]  That's why I'm offering a $1 million contest, a $1 million reward that of course will never
[07:34.880 --> 07:41.520]  be paid out because there is no video of me saying use battle rifles on the media.
[07:41.520 --> 07:44.480]  It's a total hoax by Lester Holt.
[07:44.480 --> 07:48.640]  It is a hoax by all these individuals.
[07:48.640 --> 07:52.080]  Brian Stelter, all of them, they sit there with Jack Dorsey and go, I'm getting chills
[07:52.080 --> 07:53.080]  right now.
[07:53.080 --> 07:55.680]  He said come with the battle rifles, engage in criminal activity.
[07:55.680 --> 08:02.120]  Now I said use the judicial system legally and lawfully and go after them criminally.
[08:02.120 --> 08:06.320]  Paul Watson has an article on infowars.com detailing the actual quotes and the actual
[08:06.320 --> 08:14.320]  video versus their criminal vicious fraud ahead of framing the American people with
[08:14.320 --> 08:16.040]  events on their own institutions.
[08:16.040 --> 08:18.880]  You can smell it.
[08:18.880 --> 08:20.000]  You can see it.
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.040]  It'd be like if you had a neighbor and they told you, you know, fire is still to burn
[08:25.040 --> 08:26.040]  down houses.
[08:26.040 --> 08:29.520]  Hope when you go out of town next weekend to the beach, nobody burns your house down.
[08:29.520 --> 08:30.520]  You'd be like, what?
[08:30.520 --> 08:35.080]  To your weird neighbor and then later you come home and your house is burned down and you
[08:35.080 --> 08:36.080]  call the police.
[08:36.080 --> 08:39.360]  You say, hey, my neighbor sets up about they go, well, that's funny.
[08:39.360 --> 08:43.800]  Mr. Brown or Mr. Johnson or Mr. whatever his name is, there's real cases like this
[08:43.800 --> 08:45.560]  that have happened quite a few times.
[08:45.560 --> 08:53.040]  He's been convicted twice of arson and his mentally ill and then they go arresting.
[08:53.040 --> 08:55.560]  And I mean, they're they're saying your house is going to get burned down.
[08:55.560 --> 08:57.120]  Our house is going to get burned down.
[08:57.120 --> 08:58.760]  The right wingers are going to attack us.
[08:58.760 --> 09:00.720]  Look, Alex Jones is saying and he's saying it.
[09:00.720 --> 09:04.400]  Meanwhile, in the very video, I'm like, they're going to false flag themselves and stage events
[09:04.400 --> 09:05.400]  against themselves.
[09:05.400 --> 09:08.040]  President Trump, they are setting this up to do it.
[09:08.040 --> 09:11.440]  And they've got Antifa saying they're coming with weapons to members of Congress's houses.
[09:11.440 --> 09:16.720]  They've already shot and attacked Congressman's police and attack Rand Paul until they want
[09:16.720 --> 09:20.280]  to kidnap your son and rape him with pedophiles.
[09:20.280 --> 09:21.280]  But that's OK.
[09:21.280 --> 09:24.320]  Peter Fonda can say that, Peter Fonda.
[09:24.320 --> 09:26.840]  So it's it's just next level.
[09:26.840 --> 09:34.200]  And then you heard it, Jones, Jones, he's behind it.
[09:34.200 --> 09:38.800]  And again, why would they be platforming two weeks ago and take that giant risk because
[09:38.800 --> 09:43.680]  they're making their move into the midterms with false flags and civil unrest?
[09:43.680 --> 09:46.240]  We have George Soros's own internal documents.
[09:46.240 --> 09:49.840]  Infowars.com has their game plan.
[09:49.840 --> 09:53.000]  Infowars.com has their attack profile.
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.160]  What is an attack profile, ladies and gentlemen?
[09:57.160 --> 10:03.840]  That's a term used by a lot of different air forces for the profile and basically the mission,
[10:03.840 --> 10:11.240]  the sortie, and then you can also then another defending military knows the profile of the
[10:11.240 --> 10:14.960]  different types of attacks that different aircraft run with different systems and knows
[10:14.960 --> 10:20.200]  the maneuvers that different state actors tend to use show.
[10:20.200 --> 10:21.920]  We know their blueprint of attack.
[10:21.920 --> 10:26.320]  I'm going to explain this again now.
[10:26.320 --> 10:33.240]  Five years ago, we wrote exclusively at Infowars.com that Silicon Valley was building a giant censorship
[10:33.240 --> 10:42.840]  system to come in to the United States and that was being tested in China, but that the
[10:42.840 --> 10:50.240]  great Chinese firewall was built by Google and is going to be administered by Facebook
[10:50.240 --> 10:51.240]  and Apple and others.
[10:51.240 --> 10:52.240]  It's all official.
[10:52.240 --> 10:53.240]  There it is.
[10:53.240 --> 11:01.520]  2015, four years ago, coming to America, China introduces credit score for obedient citizens,
[11:01.520 --> 11:07.800]  social isolation for people who express controversial opinions or dissent, criticize the government,
[11:07.800 --> 11:11.600]  well, your score drops, do it too much or private corporations you can no longer buy
[11:11.600 --> 11:17.320]  or sell as they're doing to us, deplatforming us, getting rid of our bank accounts, getting
[11:17.320 --> 11:21.440]  rid of our payment processors, trying to get rid of our server software.
[11:21.440 --> 11:28.400]  They scan our site and then we get letters, you know, from the top, one of the top hardware
[11:28.400 --> 11:31.720]  software groups saying, you can no longer use our software.
[11:31.720 --> 11:35.960]  Then we contacted the executives, they said, well, that is our company, but that's not
[11:35.960 --> 11:36.960]  going to happen.
[11:36.960 --> 11:37.960]  That was a mistake.
[11:37.960 --> 11:40.080]  No, it's not a mistake.
[11:40.080 --> 11:41.520]  They've got all these things in place.
[11:41.520 --> 11:42.520]  They've already tested it.
[11:42.520 --> 11:44.280]  Look at DrudgeReport.com.
[11:44.280 --> 11:51.280]  You get tomorrow's news today at Infowars.com and NewsWars.com.
[11:51.280 --> 11:52.280]  There it is.
[11:52.280 --> 11:57.080]  Facebook trusts ratings for users to be hooked into face scanning cameras everywhere with
[11:57.080 --> 12:01.880]  your banking information and then controlling everything you do according to your religion,
[12:01.880 --> 12:08.920]  your ethnicity, your race derivation, all of it.
[12:08.920 --> 12:13.280]  Now no wonder Trump is suing Facebook for violating the fair housing.
[12:13.280 --> 12:16.600]  This is true racketeering, but see, while you're busy hearing about Black Lives Matter
[12:16.600 --> 12:21.880]  as the red herring, all of us are being put into a giant digital gulag.
[12:21.880 --> 12:22.880]  So there it is.
[12:22.880 --> 12:25.800]  Facebook trusts rating for users.
[12:25.800 --> 12:31.360]  Use social credit score, algorithm, flags, behavior, and then controls you.
[12:31.360 --> 12:34.000]  What does Jack Dorsey say?
[12:34.000 --> 12:41.200]  He says, we're going to control Alex Jones and others with Pavlovian carrots and sticks.
[12:41.200 --> 12:47.840]  He explains to Skelter and he explains to Lester Holt, based on the faulty data that
[12:47.840 --> 12:51.360]  I'm saying kill the media, total lie, use battle rifles on them.
[12:51.360 --> 12:53.880]  No proof is shown because there is none.
[12:53.880 --> 12:58.560]  Even with the faulty lie, it is then extruded that, oh, we have to bring in a draconian
[12:58.560 --> 13:03.160]  system bigger than anything George Arwell could even imagine in his wildest nightmares
[13:03.160 --> 13:04.160]  or fantasies.
[13:04.160 --> 13:09.800]  I'm going to explain it again.
[13:09.800 --> 13:16.120]  Google and Apple and Microsoft and others are on record building the Chinese control
[13:16.120 --> 13:18.080]  grid.
[13:18.080 --> 13:24.680]  As soon as Obama got in, all the restraints were taken off 10 years ago now, 10 years
[13:24.680 --> 13:26.520]  ago.
[13:26.520 --> 13:29.160]  This is the Chinese gulag.
[13:29.160 --> 13:34.480]  Facebook is the Chinese communist gulag, but brought to you by Made in America.
[13:34.480 --> 13:38.400]  Oh, we make stuff in America now.
[13:38.400 --> 13:47.480]  We make things that Hitler could only dream of on another planet.
[13:47.480 --> 13:49.160]  And now you know why they banned me.
[13:49.160 --> 13:52.280]  They're getting ready to false flag, they're getting ready to frame everybody, they're
[13:52.280 --> 14:00.440]  getting ready with civil unrest, and they helped round up dissidents, Google and Apple, they
[14:00.440 --> 14:03.200]  report the dissidents who were then taken and executed.
[14:03.200 --> 14:08.360]  On record, Google would love to have me arrested and killed, guaranteed.
[14:08.360 --> 14:13.480]  See, I've never killed anybody.
[14:13.480 --> 14:17.400]  Technically one guy, well, had some health problems later, but technically I didn't.
[14:17.400 --> 14:24.840]  The point is, I've never killed anybody, but these people have helped China kill millions,
[14:24.840 --> 14:28.160]  and now they're bringing it here, and then they sit there all day and go, Alex Jones
[14:28.160 --> 14:29.880]  was mean to the Sandy Hook families.
[14:29.880 --> 14:33.960]  Alex Jones won't stop saying no one died, and I'm like, that's out of context, I didn't
[14:33.960 --> 14:36.880]  say that the way you're saying it, please stop saying I'm saying it, I'm so hurtful.
[14:36.880 --> 14:39.760]  And they go, no, you hurt children, you hurt children.
[14:39.760 --> 14:43.160]  Meanwhile, they helped China, the biggest mass murderers in history, they lie to get
[14:43.160 --> 14:44.160]  us into these wars.
[14:44.160 --> 14:51.000]  They fund the Arab Spring to topple regimes that are actually more democratic.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.560]  They are wild-eyed authoritarians in a nightmare system.
[14:54.560 --> 14:59.840]  Oh, a 90-something-year-old man, I got an article here, 95-year-old Nazi camp guards
[14:59.840 --> 15:03.840]  being deported to Germany to stand trial and go to prison.
[15:03.840 --> 15:09.600]  Why is George Soros not being deported to Hungary or to Germany?
[15:09.600 --> 15:11.480]  Because Germany will try anybody, they say, as a Nazi.
[15:11.480 --> 15:16.800]  I mean, he actually helped round up Jews and take their property, oh no, he gets ADL awards
[15:16.800 --> 15:22.880]  like Schwarzenegger, who wears a Nazi belt buckle and told Rolling Stone he loves Hitler.
[15:22.880 --> 15:30.960]  His father was an SS officer, the marriage was an approved SS breeding program, but you
[15:30.960 --> 15:35.360]  know, because he's in Hollywood and actually is the son of a real Nazi and used to greet
[15:35.360 --> 15:43.800]  people at dinner parties in an SS uniform playing Hitler's speeches.
[15:43.800 --> 15:45.680]  That's Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[15:45.680 --> 15:52.480]  And then you got Soros, a literal Nazi collaborator, he ain't getting deported anywhere, is he?
[15:52.480 --> 15:56.200]  He runs this country and he's about to break the country's back if he can.
[15:56.200 --> 15:59.800]  He's fighting to plunge the stock market right now.
[15:59.800 --> 16:04.800]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[16:04.800 --> 16:08.600]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.

[20:20.160 --> 20:41.080]  This is Alex Jones, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[20:41.080 --> 20:44.840]  This is the most censored, hated demonized program in the world.
[20:44.840 --> 20:45.840]  And why is it?
[20:45.840 --> 20:49.560]  Because I've been telling you for years, because I've read their own statements, picked
[20:49.560 --> 20:54.400]  up pieces of the Intel here and there, but they were building a total censorship system
[20:54.400 --> 21:00.560]  for America and testing it in China and preparing to have the universities and leftist think
[21:00.560 --> 21:08.120]  tanks and groups, then man, the AI computers, they're in our private messages.
[21:08.120 --> 21:10.560]  They are in your Facebook.
[21:10.560 --> 21:11.560]  They are in your email.
[21:11.560 --> 21:18.960]  They have given the Southern Prairie Law Center media matters, the ADL all access and incredibly
[21:18.960 --> 21:26.360]  enough world net daily had the big article yesterday where now media matters has put
[21:26.360 --> 21:32.040]  out a 40 plus page report.
[21:32.040 --> 21:33.920]  Please click on the memo there in the article.
[21:33.920 --> 21:35.420]  Thank you.
[21:35.420 --> 21:39.600]  That is called democracy matters.
[21:39.600 --> 21:42.560]  Now a strategic plan for action for last year.
[21:42.560 --> 21:48.360]  Now remember Senator Warner and Senator Murphy say shutting down all right wing, Patriot
[21:48.360 --> 21:53.000]  media, starting with Alex Jones is the only way to save the democracy.
[21:53.000 --> 21:58.560]  This is this, oh, the democracy where you block people's speech and spy on them and
[21:58.560 --> 22:04.240]  absolutely rape their rights according to what color they are, what sex they are, have
[22:04.240 --> 22:07.720]  all their data, all of it's given to them.
[22:07.720 --> 22:13.840]  And in this David Brock Braggs, and he was given the tens of millions of dollars, $40
[22:13.840 --> 22:20.160]  million program alone to quarterback the entire operation.
[22:20.160 --> 22:30.920]  This is in their own words with interfaces into your Facebook, into your Google, into
[22:30.920 --> 22:33.720]  your Apple, into everything.
[22:33.720 --> 22:38.880]  It's admitted that they run the moderation and remember back in February when they took
[22:38.880 --> 22:43.280]  me off YouTube and some other stuff for a while and then Bloomberg said oh, Alex Jones
[22:43.280 --> 22:49.480]  and others were taken down by a mistake, the moderators weren't properly trained.
[22:49.480 --> 22:56.400]  And that was groups from these organizations and it was incredible CNNs involved, the New
[22:56.400 --> 22:58.680]  York Times is involved, they're involved.
[22:58.680 --> 23:04.400]  We have undercover footage from Project Veritas remember, but also they were, they would
[23:04.400 --> 23:07.760]  know information about our private messages on Twitter.
[23:07.760 --> 23:14.200]  They would know everything and it's because they're reading and watching everything.
[23:14.200 --> 23:17.560]  And they would know if a Russell Brand reached out and wanted to come on the show and then
[23:17.560 --> 23:22.120]  Russell Brand would get a call and I'm giving you inside baseball now and said you better
[23:22.120 --> 23:30.320]  not go on his show when Russell Brand reached out to me.
[23:30.320 --> 23:35.120]  Now you understand the true level of this folks, they are.
[23:35.120 --> 23:41.960]  And David Brock thinks you're so stupid that he brags, in fact, post this world that daily
[23:41.960 --> 23:46.880]  article and then put the document under it please, post a blurb from it and then put
[23:46.880 --> 23:49.520]  the document in FullWars.com.
[23:49.520 --> 23:53.720]  This is like having the admission that 14 bodies are buried in their backyard hypothetically.
[23:53.720 --> 24:01.280]  I mean this is red handed and again flashback, there it is, Jamie White also reporting on
[24:01.280 --> 24:07.560]  that in FullWars.com, Soros back groups clout over colluding with big tech to censor conservatives
[24:07.560 --> 24:11.440]  and then it flashes back to when we reported it last year.
[24:11.440 --> 24:15.760]  So again, I know so much, I hadn't even remembered we covered this last year, but I mean here
[24:15.760 --> 24:27.440]  it is, they are in everything, they are a mafia, they are using a Maoist playbook.
[24:27.440 --> 24:30.520]  You think they're playing games, these people are not playing games.
[24:30.520 --> 24:36.000]  They're funded by a crazy Nazi collaborator who when I was a teenager was on the Lair News
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.400]  Hour that he was an international criminal that overthrew governments and devalued currencies
[24:40.400 --> 24:42.760]  and stole people's pension funds.
[24:42.760 --> 24:47.960]  He took his hundreds of billions of dollars, Soros is worth hundreds and hundreds and
[24:47.960 --> 24:51.160]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions, not 50 billion or whatever.
[24:51.160 --> 24:59.560]  And he came to America and he bought the media and these people are all nightmare henchmen
[24:59.560 --> 25:03.240]  of this guy and he swore to destroy me, he was in the New York Times, he said, I know
[25:03.240 --> 25:06.760]  who my enemies are and I'm glad to know and then the next paragraph was about Alex Jones
[25:06.760 --> 25:11.280]  and populism and he's not sure he can beat us.
[25:11.280 --> 25:15.240]  I'm just supposed to roll over to some crazy Nazi collaborator that overthrows countries
[25:15.240 --> 25:20.240]  and steals old people's pension funds and you've got the entire Hollywood scumbaggery
[25:20.240 --> 25:24.680]  worshiping you.
[25:24.680 --> 25:27.960]  It was happy making time when I would help round up the Jews.
[25:27.960 --> 25:30.120]  I feel not bad about it at all.
[25:30.120 --> 25:35.760]  I said it was very invigorating time for me in my life, I love the Transylvania accent
[25:35.760 --> 25:36.760]  too.
[25:36.760 --> 25:41.280]  Blah, blah, blah, it's so much fun to do what we do to you and you don't even know it,
[25:41.280 --> 25:42.280]  do you?
[25:42.280 --> 25:48.280]  It's so much good times, my son is at spirit cooking events, he looks even crazier than
[25:48.280 --> 25:49.280]  I do.
[25:49.280 --> 25:53.680]  Every photo he's like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
[25:53.680 --> 25:57.120]  ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
[25:57.120 --> 25:58.120]  ha, ha, ha.
[25:58.120 --> 25:59.080]  New one gets in our way.
[25:59.080 --> 26:01.200]  Trump got in our way.
[26:01.200 --> 26:03.960]  Get him, Jones got in our way.
[26:03.960 --> 26:07.640]  Destroy him, no one gets in my way, no one.
[26:07.640 --> 26:17.420]  US Deports, former Nazi camp guard, 95 to Germany, he just convicted us, but not Soros, no no
[26:17.420 --> 26:19.860]  no, he doesn't get shipped away.
[26:19.860 --> 26:22.560]  He's a good man.
[26:22.560 --> 26:32.960]  a good person, funding people so arrogant that they brag, CNN would go on the news in
[26:32.960 --> 26:38.920]  February and announce how much money we were making off YouTube and what was in our account.
[26:38.920 --> 26:44.680]  They were in tortuous interference in my YouTube account, we have the New York Times on tape
[26:44.680 --> 26:50.220]  admitting that as well, Project Veritas got it last year, they're in my financial dealings
[26:50.220 --> 26:56.720]  in a contract with Google, I'm going to say it again, if Google could ship David Knight
[26:56.720 --> 27:02.280]  and Alex Jones and Matt Drudge to a forced labor camp, they do it like that, they fund
[27:02.280 --> 27:08.480]  it all over the world, they help in Pakistan, they round up people that blaspheme Muhammad
[27:08.480 --> 27:12.040]  who then get sent to be killed, they help round up women that don't wear their veils,
[27:12.040 --> 27:19.400]  they get stoned to death, they are authoritarians, 1 trillion infinities, they are mad dog foaming
[27:19.400 --> 27:26.120]  at the mouth of the fortarians with this fake Black Lives Matter gay liberation cover story,
[27:26.120 --> 27:32.640]  it has nothing to do with that, China executes gays, Christians, Buddhist, they are sick
[27:32.640 --> 27:37.640]  evil monsters who have this fake moral high ground where they sit up there and they lecture
[27:37.640 --> 27:43.880]  everybody how good they are and then lie about me and lie about Trump and Trump is valiantly
[27:43.880 --> 27:47.720]  going after them, they mark if you're conservative, if you're libertarian, if you're Christian,
[27:47.720 --> 27:50.280]  if you're black, if you're white, if you're Asian, if you're gay, if you're straight they're
[27:50.280 --> 27:55.880]  reading with AI, all your private messages to your boyfriends, your girlfriends, everything
[27:55.880 --> 28:01.280]  and then they just let David Brock and media matters and George Soros can go right in whenever
[28:01.280 --> 28:06.800]  they want and just see your film role, what you did with your wife, your kids, you know
[28:06.800 --> 28:13.040]  in the bathtub, grandma, it's all theirs and they don't respect you because you don't
[28:13.040 --> 28:19.600]  respect yourselves and everybody's lined up to kiss these monsters, disgusting satanic
[28:19.600 --> 28:26.120]  souls, I'm not talking to our general audience, I'm talking to the sickos that sold out in
[28:26.120 --> 28:30.320]  the media by successive approximation, you are in a brainwashed leftist cult that is
[28:30.320 --> 28:37.180]  just a paper thin veneer over the fact that you work for the most evil, ruthless people
[28:37.180 --> 28:43.720]  in the world that are bringing AI social credit cores with your banking, face scanning, everything
[28:43.720 --> 28:48.120]  you say and do in the real world, tracking everything you do in real time with total
[28:48.120 --> 28:52.800]  control to hack your life, to ruin your life because they think they're God allied with
[28:52.800 --> 28:59.480]  the chai comms that have killed over a hundred million people, they are the enemy.
[28:59.480 --> 29:01.840]  Listen to what Chris said about Andrew 400.
[29:01.840 --> 29:07.000]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in 10 weeks, my son was getting married and when I went for
[29:07.000 --> 29:12.200]  the suit fitting, I was the size 48 and when I went back to do the final fitting, I was
[29:12.200 --> 29:17.440]  a 44, I have more energy, that's for sure, I probably lost four inches around my belly,
[29:17.440 --> 29:20.960]  I'm 57 and I'm back when I was in my 30s.
[29:20.960 --> 29:23.360]  Here's what Dwayne said about Andrew 400.

[33:03.520 --> 33:21.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:21.640 --> 33:31.280]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[33:31.280 --> 33:34.360]  Coming up in the next hour, there's a lot of news that we have been getting to while
[33:34.360 --> 33:38.640]  this huge takeover of the Internet, the attempt to steal the midterm elections, and Chinese
[33:38.640 --> 33:45.160]  communists openly flexing their muscles, taking over Hollywood, U.S. universities, censoring
[33:45.160 --> 33:51.480]  U.S. news operations that are patriotic and faithful and dutiful to common sense and
[33:51.480 --> 33:52.480]  sanity.
[33:52.480 --> 33:56.800]  Yes, we are the most censored transmission in the world.
[33:56.800 --> 34:01.360]  In InfoWars and the attack we've been under, this amazing crew and our audience that are
[34:01.360 --> 34:08.800]  activists and are the InfoWars, and everybody here are on an incredible historic journey
[34:08.800 --> 34:09.800]  together.
[34:09.800 --> 34:19.320]  And you heard me get heated earlier because media matters brags funded by Soros that they
[34:19.320 --> 34:25.160]  have a $40-plus million program just funded last year, there's a bunch of other programs.
[34:25.160 --> 34:33.160]  Bragging how they get into all of your data, bragging how they are running your life, bragging
[34:33.160 --> 34:40.800]  how they've been given access to moderate Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, everything.
[34:40.800 --> 34:44.640]  And you watch Media Matters, writes an article, the entire media dutifully puts it out.
[34:44.640 --> 34:49.120]  Media Matters says Jones says he's going to assault the media with assault rifles.
[34:49.120 --> 34:50.400]  I never say it, it doesn't matter.
[34:50.400 --> 35:00.360]  They say it, Soros says it, Papa, Nazi collaborator says it, and it's like God said it, or Pharaoh
[35:00.360 --> 35:05.880]  said it, so let it be written, so let it be done.
[35:05.880 --> 35:13.160]  I'm surprised they don't read the tea leaves of Soros' droppings and have high priests
[35:13.160 --> 35:19.080]  look into the stars and see what his droppings portend for the future with their sages.
[35:19.080 --> 35:25.640]  This is sick, that demonic, burbling creature perched on top of America.
[35:25.640 --> 35:29.600]  All the pension funds, all the currencies he bankrupted, all the evils, all the Arab
[35:29.600 --> 35:38.200]  Springs he funded, his horrible little sick evil son Alexander, all perching on us, drinking
[35:38.200 --> 35:39.440]  the essence out of our nation.
[35:39.440 --> 35:44.040]  Go read the report, it's on infowars.com.
[35:44.040 --> 35:45.040]  It's incredible.
[35:45.040 --> 35:49.360]  And yes, we broke it four years ago that the Chinese Communist Social Score was already
[35:49.360 --> 35:54.040]  being developed in the U.S. for China and already being deployed by Facebook.
[35:54.040 --> 35:56.040]  Word for word, where's our Pulitzer Prize?
[35:56.040 --> 35:58.720]  I don't want that, I wouldn't take a Pulitzer Prize.
[35:58.720 --> 36:03.480]  A Pulitzer Prize would be like Hitler trying to give me an Iron Cross first class.
[36:03.480 --> 36:06.480]  I would say I don't want that from Adolf Hitler.
[36:06.480 --> 36:11.080]  It's a mark of being pathetic and a mark of being an horrible person.
[36:11.080 --> 36:16.560]  Pulitzer Prize winners now, Pulitzer Prize winners now are literally like recipients
[36:16.560 --> 36:18.480]  of Nazi medals.
[36:18.480 --> 36:22.520]  You get a Peace Prize now, it means you've launched a bunch of wars and they're evil.
[36:22.520 --> 36:28.000]  If Trump ever gets one, they're trying to reprieve themselves and the public's how he should
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.600]  give the money to charity.
[36:29.600 --> 36:30.600]  But that's enough.
[36:30.600 --> 36:32.680]  I'm going to go to David Knight here in just a moment.
[36:32.680 --> 36:34.320]  He'll go with us a little bit in the next hour.
[36:34.320 --> 36:37.000]  It's the one year anniversary of him launching, the real news.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.920]  We're going to be discussing all that with him in just a moment, but to see the cackling
[36:41.920 --> 36:47.800]  and the celebrations all over HBO, all over CNN, all over MSNBC, them spiking the football
[36:47.800 --> 36:53.080]  in the end zone, yeah, he's being de-platformed and let's de-platform them all.
[36:53.080 --> 36:57.760]  Our country's democracy depends on it when that's the opposite of what they call a democracy.
[36:57.760 --> 37:01.520]  And we're a republic, by the way.
[37:01.520 --> 37:05.320]  It's the most illogical stuff Brian Stelter and others when I see these clips.
[37:05.320 --> 37:09.120]  And the same segment will say Trump's war on the press is very serious.
[37:09.120 --> 37:10.120]  He wants to shut us down.
[37:10.120 --> 37:11.280]  He wants blood.
[37:11.280 --> 37:12.280]  Never said that.
[37:12.280 --> 37:18.800]  He says you're liars and enemies of the truth.
[37:18.800 --> 37:26.240]  And then in the very same segment, let's move to Alex Jones and de-platforming him.
[37:26.240 --> 37:31.520]  He's been taken off 20-plus platforms, but Twitter needs to take him completely off because
[37:31.520 --> 37:41.760]  you know, only tyrants try to shut down the press and you say, there's no logic to that.
[37:41.760 --> 37:44.680]  They're raping logic in front of you.
[37:44.680 --> 37:47.240]  George Arwell was a big liberal.
[37:47.240 --> 37:52.760]  He saw the bad side of the imperial system, imperial police officer in India.
[37:52.760 --> 37:55.120]  So he went and became basically a communist, a Thabian socialist.
[37:55.120 --> 37:59.160]  And then when he got to the higher level, it was like, no, we're evil nihilists.
[37:59.160 --> 38:00.160]  We're basically Satanists.
[38:00.160 --> 38:04.560]  We want to totally dominate humanity, make them accept false attitudes that there is
[38:04.560 --> 38:06.760]  no gravity unless we say there's gravity.
[38:06.760 --> 38:12.960]  It's double-think, holding two opposite thoughts in your head at the same time, but being able
[38:12.960 --> 38:19.400]  to rationally operate in that artificial schism.
[38:19.400 --> 38:20.400]  And that's what it is.
[38:20.400 --> 38:22.240]  Donald Trump is trying to kill the press.
[38:22.240 --> 38:23.960]  Donald Trump is a dictator.
[38:23.960 --> 38:25.320]  Donald Trump is like Hitler.
[38:25.320 --> 38:26.800]  Donald Trump wants us all dead.
[38:26.800 --> 38:28.760]  Donald Trump wants our blood.
[38:28.760 --> 38:31.480]  Anyone that tries to take down any of the press is a criminal.
[38:31.480 --> 38:33.200]  A, he's not trying to take them down.
[38:33.200 --> 38:34.280]  He's just standing up against them.
[38:34.280 --> 38:38.360]  Then the next sentence, take Alex Jones and all of them off the air and kick Trump off
[38:38.360 --> 38:39.360]  of Twitter.
[38:39.360 --> 38:43.920]  USA Today, Associated Press, they're all, take Trump off, take Trump off.
[38:43.920 --> 38:47.720]  We're going to go to break and come back with David Knight and I'm going to try to calm
[38:47.720 --> 38:48.720]  down here.
[38:48.720 --> 38:51.600]  He's got a lot to go over himself on this and one year anniversary of the real news
[38:51.600 --> 38:56.560]  that comes on 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. right before I come on every day and then the war room
[38:56.560 --> 38:59.160]  with Owen Schroder here, Roger Stone and others comes up.
[38:59.160 --> 39:08.160]  But this is an incredible time when all of this is coming out and it's all being revealed.
[39:08.160 --> 39:09.160]  Wow.
[39:09.160 --> 39:11.280]  Silicon Valley built the Chinese firewall.
[39:11.280 --> 39:12.280]  Wow.
[39:12.280 --> 39:13.280]  They're helping round up their dissidents.
[39:13.280 --> 39:14.280]  Wow.
[39:14.280 --> 39:15.280]  Apple's moved to China officially.
[39:15.280 --> 39:17.120]  Google's building their censorship engines.
[39:17.120 --> 39:18.120]  Wow.
[39:18.120 --> 39:21.800]  Facebook is using face scanning and banking info and giving it all to the Democrats and
[39:21.800 --> 39:26.560]  foreign governments and the Chinese and you got Zuckerberg in China praising them and
[39:26.560 --> 39:30.400]  praising censorship a year ago.
[39:30.400 --> 39:31.400]  Pull it up.
[39:31.400 --> 39:38.880]  Zuckerberg goes to China and praises censorship with their internet czar and there's videos
[39:38.880 --> 39:40.880]  of them laughing and how great it is.
[39:40.880 --> 39:45.680]  This is the sick joke.
[39:45.680 --> 39:46.680]  This is what they're doing.
[39:46.680 --> 39:50.440]  Now I need to tell you this right now.
[39:50.440 --> 39:52.240]  People say, why didn't somebody stand for the globalist?
[39:52.240 --> 39:53.560]  Why didn't somebody take action?
[39:53.560 --> 39:55.280]  Well, because people are scared.
[39:55.280 --> 39:56.280]  That's why.
[39:56.280 --> 40:01.400]  And I'll be honest with you, I don't want to call it fear because I'm not a big flight
[40:01.400 --> 40:02.400]  guy.
[40:02.400 --> 40:03.400]  I'm more of a fight guys.
[40:03.400 --> 40:06.240]  But this is, this is me scared.
[40:06.240 --> 40:10.240]  Info wars, this whole operation is me seeing a bunch of serious tyrants that think I'm
[40:10.240 --> 40:14.040]  a slave and think you're a slave and they think because I'm not a psychopath or sociopath
[40:14.040 --> 40:16.960]  and I have deep chivalry that I'm a fool.
[40:16.960 --> 40:18.520]  No, I'm not a fool.
[40:18.520 --> 40:20.200]  You people look empty.
[40:20.200 --> 40:21.200]  You act empty.
[40:21.200 --> 40:23.000]  Your families are ugly and stupid.
[40:23.000 --> 40:24.960]  You look like you have been cursed to hell.
[40:24.960 --> 40:26.200]  I know you have horrible lives.
[40:26.200 --> 40:27.200]  I know all about you.
[40:27.200 --> 40:28.800]  I don't want to be with you.
[40:28.800 --> 40:29.800]  Understand?
[40:29.800 --> 40:31.080]  It's about, it's an energy thing.
[40:31.080 --> 40:34.960]  I want to go with the energy that loves people and builds things and is open and honorable.
[40:34.960 --> 40:38.400]  I will not serve your satanic system ever.
[40:38.400 --> 40:44.720]  And I pray to Jesus Christ and the Father and the Holy Spirit moves across the world
[40:44.720 --> 40:48.640]  and gets humanity to awaken before we go into an even deeper level of this because this
[40:48.640 --> 40:50.080]  is our last chance.
[40:50.080 --> 40:56.360]  And Trump is a final signpost on the way to hell pointing back saying, go back, go back.
[40:56.360 --> 40:58.600]  This way leads destruction.
[40:58.600 --> 41:00.600]  And info wars is that signpost.
[41:00.600 --> 41:05.760]  God wouldn't put you in this position and not give you a chance out of it, folks.
[41:05.760 --> 41:07.800]  But this is the final course.
[41:07.800 --> 41:08.800]  And that's why the enemy's activating.
[41:08.800 --> 41:10.560]  It's why they're getting so satanic.
[41:10.560 --> 41:14.440]  It's why they're so hateful now because they want your soul.
[41:14.440 --> 41:15.440]  They want your energy.
[41:15.440 --> 41:21.680]  They want to run your mind and they've already turned all their minions over to a form of
[41:21.680 --> 41:24.240]  spiritual possession of just hate.
[41:24.240 --> 41:33.960]  When I'm around mainstream reporters now, they literally go.
[41:33.960 --> 41:34.860]  That's the spirit.
[41:34.860 --> 41:38.440]  It's, it's like Zonbiosis.
[41:38.440 --> 41:39.880]  And I just look at them and feel sorry for them.
[41:39.880 --> 41:40.880]  They don't know how to handle that.
[41:40.880 --> 41:41.880]  And they'll kind of.
[41:41.880 --> 41:44.680]  I mean, these people will do anything.
[41:44.680 --> 41:46.600]  They love to see us in death camps.
[41:46.600 --> 41:48.160]  They already helped China run it.
[41:48.160 --> 41:49.840]  So we need financial support.
[41:49.840 --> 41:53.960]  I said last day, yesterday, I have not come up with new specials yet.

[42:56.760 --> 42:59.280]  The rebellion against Satan continues!
[42:59.280 --> 43:00.600]  We knew it was coming.
[43:00.600 --> 43:02.280]  The whole thing was for me, leg.
[43:02.280 --> 43:07.520]  First demonize infowars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[43:07.520 --> 43:12.840]  to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[43:12.840 --> 43:19.400]  children and Islamophobia, and then voila, two weeks later ban infowars completely off
[43:19.400 --> 43:26.040]  of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top 5 or top 10 news feeds.
[43:26.040 --> 43:32.320]  Go to infowars.com, for a slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link,
[43:32.320 --> 43:35.920]  whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[43:35.920 --> 43:40.520]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com, for a slash newsletter, and give us your emails
[43:40.520 --> 43:45.440]  so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[43:45.440 --> 43:50.440]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com, for a slash show, how they can download the
[43:50.440 --> 43:55.080]  free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information
[43:55.080 --> 43:59.520]  and point out this is the verboten info, this is what they don't want you to see.
[43:59.520 --> 44:04.400]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[44:04.400 --> 44:08.880]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all

[46:04.680 --> 46:09.640]  Years ago, Infowars life created the powerful Myco ZX formula to help you combat internal
[46:09.640 --> 46:10.640]  yeast.
[46:10.640 --> 46:14.200]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew
[46:14.200 --> 46:18.120]  we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[46:18.120 --> 46:23.280]  Myco ZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed
[46:23.280 --> 46:27.480]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better

[46:34.200 --> 46:38.680]  tract and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.

[46:42.960 --> 46:47.560]  bark, and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test
[46:47.560 --> 46:50.560]  of time as powerful microbalancing properties.

[47:02.960 --> 47:17.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:17.920 --> 47:22.960]  Now you know you're winning the information war when the other side has no response but
[47:22.960 --> 47:28.960]  to resort to censorship.
[47:28.960 --> 47:33.520]  We're going to have to drain the privilege out of Washington first because that's what
[47:33.520 --> 47:35.520]  the swamp feeds on, their privilege.
[47:35.520 --> 47:40.880]  They can't stand for people to exercise their first and second amendments together.
[47:40.880 --> 47:41.880]  You found it.
[47:41.880 --> 47:43.800]  It's the real news.
[47:43.800 --> 47:47.680]  That's what you have to look forward to.
[47:47.680 --> 47:51.080]  He's not sorry when snowflakes can't handle the truth.
[47:51.080 --> 47:53.000]  He's your host, David Knight.
[47:53.000 --> 47:58.560]  Welcome back to Real News, I'm David Knight and joining me in this segment is Lionel.
[47:58.560 --> 48:05.040]  He's happy to have Lionel, an Emmy award-winning television news decoder as he puts it, and
[48:05.040 --> 48:08.840]  a legal analyst, a licensed trial lawyer, a former prosecutor, you can find him at Lionel
[48:08.840 --> 48:09.840]  Nation.
[48:09.840 --> 48:10.840]  Let me tell you something.
[48:10.840 --> 48:11.840]  I love your show.
[48:11.840 --> 48:15.680]  I'm not just saying it because you're here, but it's true.
[48:15.680 --> 48:16.680]  It's great.
[48:16.680 --> 48:18.240]  So keep up the great work.
[48:18.240 --> 48:25.360]  And how things are changing, David, David, what, you did something before this morning
[48:25.360 --> 48:26.360]  which is terrific.
[48:26.360 --> 48:33.520]  And I just, I was thunderstruck by it yet again.
[48:33.520 --> 48:34.520]  You found it.
[48:34.520 --> 48:38.640]  It's the real news with your host, David Knight.
[48:38.640 --> 48:43.200]  That's why you have to understand how these criminals in Washington have perverted our
[48:43.200 --> 49:06.600]  system of government and turned it upside down and have shredded the Constitution.
[49:06.600 --> 49:11.120]  And we have the Democrats suing us, it's a lawsuit that hasn't ever been announced, over
[49:11.120 --> 49:16.680]  the name, real news, trying to shut David down right now.
[49:16.680 --> 49:23.640]  One year anniversary of him launching the show, we are under total George Soros attack,
[49:23.640 --> 49:29.120]  but we trust in you, the audience, we trust in God and listen, it's true, I'm on a suicide
[49:29.120 --> 49:30.120]  mission.
[49:30.120 --> 49:31.120]  I don't want to die.
[49:31.120 --> 49:34.960]  The suicide mission means it's 50-50 that you're not going to make it back.
[49:34.960 --> 49:38.960]  That's what's considered to be a suicide mission by the U.S. Army and the Marine Corps.
[49:38.960 --> 49:41.200]  They consider that a suicide mission.
[49:41.200 --> 49:45.920]  When you go up a hill and you know, taking these hills to use the Pacific example, half
[49:45.920 --> 49:48.960]  the Marines die going up the hill.
[49:48.960 --> 49:49.960]  But you know what?
[49:49.960 --> 49:52.600]  Our kids are back down that hill and we got evil people running the show.
[49:52.600 --> 49:53.600]  We got to go up.
[49:53.600 --> 49:54.600]  We got to go over the top, folks.
[49:54.600 --> 49:56.120]  We're going to do it.
[49:56.120 --> 49:59.760]  But the full force of evil is hitting us, but it's all coming out.
[49:59.760 --> 50:02.760]  China is running it with Facebook, Apple, all of them.
[50:02.760 --> 50:03.760]  They're pure evil.
[50:03.760 --> 50:07.440]  They helped China round up people and send them to death camps to have their organs taken.
[50:07.440 --> 50:09.640]  That means they do it to you.
[50:09.640 --> 50:11.960]  This whole leftist thing is a facade.
[50:11.960 --> 50:13.120]  It's a cover.
[50:13.120 --> 50:14.400]  And the world is waking up.
[50:14.400 --> 50:18.160]  So David Knight, six, seven years ago, entered a contest.
[50:18.160 --> 50:23.040]  He didn't win the contest, but he ended up moving down here from North Carolina with
[50:23.040 --> 50:27.800]  his family, sweltering Texas, and I love Texas, but let me tell you, North Carolina is a lot
[50:27.800 --> 50:28.800]  prettier and a lot nicer.
[50:28.800 --> 50:30.880]  I mean, I love it up there.
[50:30.880 --> 50:34.680]  He pulled up stakes, sold his house, his business, and came down here and he's helped change
[50:34.680 --> 50:35.680]  the world.
[50:35.680 --> 50:38.280]  And I wanted to get, get him on the one year anniversary because they've been trying to
[50:38.280 --> 50:39.280]  shut him down.
[50:39.280 --> 50:45.880]  You know, destroying his, his YouTube channel with nine million subscribers on Apple iTunes.
[50:45.880 --> 50:49.560]  That was the place where he was, had more subscribers than I did folks like to listen
[50:49.560 --> 50:53.680]  to him that way, but you can go to info wars.com forward slash show and right there is a link.
[50:53.680 --> 50:58.280]  Just click it on any device and you will get the podcast direct to you, not through iTunes,
[50:58.280 --> 51:01.160]  not through these middlemen, but the apps they haven't taken yet, but Tim Cook says
[51:01.160 --> 51:02.160]  he's watching me.
[51:02.160 --> 51:04.480]  Oh, we know you're watching the Chinese slaves as well.
[51:04.480 --> 51:06.640]  Mr. Cook and your slave factories.
[51:06.640 --> 51:07.640]  He said he's watching us.
[51:07.640 --> 51:12.360]  He might delete us off of the, the app that's number one in news and also an Android.
[51:12.360 --> 51:15.040]  I understand we have to be deleted because we're number one.
[51:15.040 --> 51:18.320]  So David Knight, congratulations on your work, but we're in the thick of the battle.
[51:18.320 --> 51:23.200]  I just wanted to have you on today to congratulate you and your family on the stalwart work to
[51:23.200 --> 51:27.840]  now be part of the number one most censored news platform on planet earth.
[51:27.840 --> 51:31.560]  And now the most famous first amendment case, all the lawyers agree on all sides.
[51:31.560 --> 51:36.600]  I mean, it's not, we want to be in history, they say that great events and great times
[51:36.600 --> 51:40.240]  make great men and great women, but make no mistake, brother, this is the total fight
[51:40.240 --> 51:44.320]  for planetary future for our species and you are right in the heart of it.
[51:44.320 --> 51:48.640]  So I want to thank you and your wife and your family and your sons and everybody for the
[51:48.640 --> 51:50.360]  work they've done working with us as well.
[51:50.360 --> 51:52.280]  We salute you, David.
[51:52.280 --> 51:53.280]  Well thank you.
[51:53.280 --> 51:57.800]  And it's an honor to be here and it's an honor to be a wanted man, wanted by the largest
[51:57.800 --> 52:00.080]  corporation the world has ever seen.
[52:00.080 --> 52:02.080]  They have hunted me down just like they've hunted you down.
[52:02.080 --> 52:04.600]  I never got a warning ever from Google.
[52:04.600 --> 52:09.400]  I got one message, they cut me off that Monday, August the 6th.
[52:09.400 --> 52:11.840]  They cut me off the last four minutes of my program.
[52:11.840 --> 52:16.640]  I got an email saying we have a complaint and we've deleted your channel.
[52:16.640 --> 52:21.200]  And so we sent a thing back to them and I tweeted out what's going on, but of course
[52:21.200 --> 52:28.440]  I'm not a left of center outlet so they didn't get back to me right away like they did H3H3
[52:28.440 --> 52:32.240]  and they never did anything, but six hours later they started sending me and now they've
[52:32.240 --> 52:34.000]  been sending me for the last couple of weeks.
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.200]  I've been sending me an email, that same email every 10 to 15 minutes.
[52:38.200 --> 52:39.880]  They won't tell me what video it was.
[52:39.880 --> 52:42.360]  I'd never had a complaint, never had a strike.
[52:42.360 --> 52:47.520]  They shut me down guilty by association and so I got shut down.
[52:47.520 --> 52:52.360]  And the interesting thing, Alex, is that I set up as a test case, set up the David Night
[52:52.360 --> 52:57.280]  Show with no connections to Infowars, put up two interviews or two segments.
[52:57.280 --> 53:01.960]  One was an interview with Steve Quayle talking about the Gen 6 conference coming up in September
[53:01.960 --> 53:03.200]  and it's about transhumanism.
[53:03.200 --> 53:07.320]  The other one was about vaccine deaths in Samoa.
[53:07.320 --> 53:08.360]  Those are the only two videos there.
[53:08.360 --> 53:10.400]  They shut that down within 16 hours.
[53:10.400 --> 53:12.400]  So they're searching out what I'm doing and they're showing me.
[53:12.400 --> 53:15.720]  They have unpersoned you for your association with me.
[53:15.720 --> 53:16.720]  That's right.
[53:16.720 --> 53:18.880]  That is Gulag Archipelago, 110%.
[53:18.880 --> 53:19.880]  That's right.
[53:19.880 --> 53:20.880]  Absolutely.
[53:20.880 --> 53:24.960]  And you know, when we're talking about this, let's talk about Google here because Google
[53:24.960 --> 53:32.520]  is, you know, we just had the guy who used to be the head of free expression in China.
[53:32.520 --> 53:36.040]  Now he's the former head of free expression and they didn't replace him.
[53:36.040 --> 53:38.840]  There is nobody there at Google for free expression.
[53:38.840 --> 53:44.600]  And he said, what they are doing in China with their censorship, he said, I can't imagine
[53:44.600 --> 53:47.280]  a scenario where that isn't a violation of human rights.
[53:47.280 --> 53:48.520]  And that truly is.
[53:48.520 --> 53:53.760]  When you are censored by a corporation, that is a violation of human rights.
[53:53.760 --> 53:55.840]  Because it doesn't have to be by a government.
[53:55.840 --> 53:57.640]  The First Amendment is not a privilege.
[53:57.640 --> 54:02.360]  It doesn't guarantee us free speech or freedom of the press.
[54:02.360 --> 54:05.160]  Those were prohibitions against the government taking them away.
[54:05.160 --> 54:09.600]  But when the government merges with the corporations, which is what's really happening now, we have
[54:09.600 --> 54:14.520]  these globalist corporations and these globalist government entities like China and others
[54:14.520 --> 54:18.200]  that are merging together to an act censorship.
[54:18.200 --> 54:20.840]  And that is the worst of fascism.
[54:20.840 --> 54:22.640]  That is actually what fascism is.
[54:22.640 --> 54:26.000]  China is not anti-fascism, they're anti-first amendment.
[54:26.000 --> 54:29.680]  And this is really what this is all fundamentally about.
[54:29.680 --> 54:33.040]  And they've got their report, we've got our Adams report that we know got for the president.
[54:33.040 --> 54:36.560]  That's another reason we've confirmed, yes, very high level people in the federal government,
[54:36.560 --> 54:40.560]  I'll leave it at that, that Trump is now demanding our reports.
[54:40.560 --> 54:43.720]  And the Adams report that I commissioned with Mike Adams, we're going to get another report
[54:43.720 --> 54:47.520]  that I have a top law firm supposedly going to finish today that the president's eagerly
[54:47.520 --> 54:49.960]  awaiting on the whole anti-trust stuff.
[54:49.960 --> 54:50.960]  And here's the deal.
[54:50.960 --> 54:53.640]  No one else in Washington will bring this to the president because you can get killed
[54:53.640 --> 54:54.640]  doing this.
[54:54.640 --> 54:55.640]  Okay.
[54:55.640 --> 54:58.320]  And we need everybody's prayers because I'm not, I mean, the Chinese killed over a hundred
[54:58.320 --> 54:59.480]  million people.
[54:59.480 --> 55:00.720]  The big tech giants love it.
[55:00.720 --> 55:01.720]  They're moving there.
[55:01.720 --> 55:02.720]  Somebody explain your body.
[55:02.720 --> 55:03.720]  We're threading the needle here.
[55:03.720 --> 55:04.720]  We need your prayers.
[55:04.720 --> 55:07.960]  This is getting, use a Star Wars analogy, X-wings in the trench.
[55:07.960 --> 55:08.960]  Okay.
[55:08.960 --> 55:10.600]  And I'm not trying to sit there and blow that up a portion.
[55:10.600 --> 55:11.600]  Look at it.
[55:11.600 --> 55:12.600]  Okay.
[55:12.600 --> 55:13.600]  This is history.
[55:13.600 --> 55:15.200]  We need your prayers more than anything.
[55:15.200 --> 55:16.840]  Democracy matters, strategic plan of action.
[55:16.840 --> 55:22.720]  David Brock funded by Soros Private Confidential, and of course it got leaked to now Brock admits
[55:22.720 --> 55:27.120]  it of how they're in the interfaces reading our private messages on all these platforms
[55:27.120 --> 55:29.280]  and literally using it against us.
[55:29.280 --> 55:33.520]  And the New York Times is also given access to all of your data.
[55:33.520 --> 55:39.160]  So the New York Times folks, Project Veritas's undercover video is literally in your Facebook
[55:39.160 --> 55:40.360]  in everything.
[55:40.360 --> 55:42.560]  This is beyond criminal, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:42.560 --> 55:43.680]  And that's why they want to shut down.
[55:43.680 --> 55:45.400]  Just so you know.
[55:45.400 --> 55:47.760]  Let's take a look at what happened today with Microsoft.
[55:47.760 --> 55:50.160]  This is at the top of Washington Post, Alex.
[55:50.160 --> 55:52.200]  Microsoft, this is a quote, the headlines.
[55:52.200 --> 55:57.640]  Microsoft says it's found a Russian operation that was targeting US political institutions.
[55:57.640 --> 56:02.160]  They're pretending that the Russians are coming after a couple of neocon conservative institutes
[56:02.160 --> 56:03.400]  that nobody's ever heard of.
[56:03.400 --> 56:04.400]  Yeah.
[56:04.400 --> 56:05.400]  Do they find a Martian too?
[56:05.400 --> 56:06.400]  Yeah.
[56:06.400 --> 56:07.400]  That's right.
[56:07.400 --> 56:11.200]  Well, and of course this is, has nothing to do with the fact that Microsoft just last
[56:11.200 --> 56:14.760]  week threatened to de-platform GAB.
[56:14.760 --> 56:17.520]  They said, well, we've got two people that made some comments here, we're going to take
[56:17.520 --> 56:20.800]  down all of GAB because we don't like those comments.
[56:20.800 --> 56:22.400]  So they looked like they're pretty bad.
[56:22.400 --> 56:27.960]  So they come out and say, oh, but look, we're protecting Republicans from Russians.
[56:27.960 --> 56:29.520]  Microsoft is one of the first companies.
[56:29.520 --> 56:32.960]  Actually it was the first company, if you look at the Ed Snowden documents, the first
[56:32.960 --> 56:39.760]  company that jumped onto the prism program to spy unconstitutionally illegally on America.
[56:39.760 --> 56:40.760]  Exactly.
[56:40.760 --> 56:41.760]  We want to come back and break all this down.
[56:41.760 --> 56:42.760]  Stay right there, David.
[56:42.760 --> 56:43.760]  This is important.
[56:43.760 --> 56:48.760]  They think you're so stupid, they admit they're spying on all of you.
[56:48.760 --> 56:53.640]  These big universities, these big newspapers, they're not news anymore.
[56:53.640 --> 56:54.640]  They're not just fake news.
[56:54.640 --> 57:01.080]  They are weaponized, organized crime syndicates, literally trying to steer us into authoritarianism
[57:01.080 --> 57:04.960]  and the next 77 days they're getting ready to make their big jump.
[57:04.960 --> 57:06.360]  Please spread the word.
[57:06.360 --> 57:09.080]  Please tell everybody on local AM and FM stations you're listening to.
[57:09.080 --> 57:11.200]  We forget that's the main audience, TV stations.
[57:11.200 --> 57:12.200]  It's so precious.
[57:12.200 --> 57:13.200]  Thank you stations.
[57:13.200 --> 57:14.200]  Thank you everybody.
[57:14.200 --> 57:16.040]  Tell folks how you're watching, how you're listening.
[57:16.040 --> 57:17.520]  Put a billboard up if you have the money.
[57:17.520 --> 57:18.520]  It's a total war.
[57:18.520 --> 57:22.480]  It's all in the next 77 days and financially support us.
[57:22.480 --> 57:26.920]  This big super sale has to end because SuperMail Vitaliy and stuff is about to sell out with
[57:26.920 --> 57:28.880]  some of the other products.
[57:28.880 --> 57:29.880]  Bodies is about to sell out.
[57:29.880 --> 57:31.280]  We have more coming in about a month.

[57:33.640 --> 57:34.640]  It's got to end.

[57:39.680 --> 57:40.680]  Promote in America.
[57:40.680 --> 57:41.680]  This is a total war.
[57:41.680 --> 57:43.480]  Don't let them intimidate you into silence.
[57:43.480 --> 57:44.480]  Stay with us.

[58:55.600 --> 58:57.840]  you are changing the world?
[58:57.840 --> 59:01.560]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the Glovelist.
[59:01.560 --> 59:06.120]  It is you, the Infowariers, across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood
[59:06.120 --> 59:10.080]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[59:10.080 --> 59:14.880]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[59:14.880 --> 59:15.880]  You are the Infowar.
[59:15.880 --> 59:20.960]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[59:20.960 --> 59:26.040]  go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[59:26.040 --> 59:31.920]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[59:31.920 --> 59:37.480]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[59:37.480 --> 59:40.720]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[59:40.720 --> 59:46.960]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[59:46.960 --> 59:53.920]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[59:53.920 --> 01:00:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.720]  He aligns himself with the truth that it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:22.160]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:28.640]  I'm trying to be calm here and we analyze the architecture of the globalist operation
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:34.600]  quite frankly down to a T and it totally freaked him out.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.800]  And I'm trying to explain something here.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.920]  This is not like I'm up here bragging.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:42.120]  This is like walking into a dragon's nest.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:48.400]  And of course the figurative illusion is China.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:54.200]  China and the Chinese Communist are the most soulless people on the planet, not the Chinese
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.720]  people, but the Chinese Communist.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:01.920]  And David Knight knows that, you know, his daughter is from China adopted.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.320]  My sisters from South Korea adopted, but he went there.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:10.280]  He saw her in the starving conditions and old people, they just let him down the side
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.960]  of the street.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.920]  If you criticize the government, they just kill you.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.880]  They love Buddhists because they're so healthy, they go and put them in a facility and blood
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.520]  type them and everything and then gut them and sell their organs.
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:25.560]  And you tell the leftists, they laugh because they like it.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:28.280]  And that's what Tucker Carlson talked about on Friday night with that professor I want
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.560]  to get on, is that we keep thinking, man, these people don't get it.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.560]  They're idiots.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.020]  Well, their minions are idiots, but the left knows their criminals.
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:37.840]  They know their sociopaths.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.480]  They know they're following a Jacobin left hand path.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.240]  Basically devil worship is their operating system.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.920]  And then they rebrand devil worshipers as oh, free libertarians and all this other crud
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.040]  and oh, you're such intellectuals.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.880]  That's not your real devil worshipers.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.880]  That's people trying to look powerful and look avant-garde, okay?
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.800]  Being a devil worshiper on planet Earth is not being avant-garde.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.160]  It's worshiping the big mainframe system.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:05.800]  David Knight is co-hosting with me for the next 30 minutes, one year anniversary of the
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.800]  real news.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.440]  And I love how they persecute us, David.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.080]  And they think it, I mean, I've seen you when you get tired, you get exhausted as you work
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:19.720]  so hard, you do so much research for your show, five, six, seven hours.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:25.200]  And then when they persecute you, suddenly you're just bounding around the office for
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.400]  a couple of months.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.280]  And then now that you keep persecuting you, I've never seen you have so much energy.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.280]  And I'm the same way.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.280]  I was up till 3 a.m.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.360]  I slept two and a half hours, got up, made breakfast, took my children to school.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:38.200]  I'm up here bouncing off the walls because they're trying to silence me and I know I'm
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.360]  right and we're beginning to defeat them, David.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.160]  And that's a magic moment, isn't it?
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:45.800]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.480]  They don't want us, Alex, it's like the stuff that I was talking about.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.680]  They don't want people to find out what they're doing with vaccines.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:55.360]  They don't want people to find out what they're doing in terms of persecuting people.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.560]  Like you're talking about the biometric identification.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.640]  China is a beta test site.
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.440]  And this is a unification of government organizations, especially China.
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:09.680]  They are handpicked by the globalists to be the beta test site.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.880]  That's where they're trying out all the biometric stuff.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.000]  And if you want to know what this is going to look like, the fact that they can recognize
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:21.200]  people by their face, recognize them by their walk, immediately find them if they are j-walking.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.080]  They can make it so they can't travel, so they can't get a job.
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.080]  Everything that you see happening.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.080]  And they're doing it.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.080]  We're going to come back and talk about this.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.080]  Yeah, they're doing it now.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.080]  They're already doing it.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.080]  Yeah.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.080]  11 million flies canceled.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.080]  That's right.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.080]  I mean, it's here.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.880]  And then Silicon Valley, as you said, this is the happy hunting ground.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:40.280]  This is a total evil system that killed five times what Hitler did, where they let him
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:44.680]  do whatever they want, and so it's the playground of these monsters that are tax exempt like
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:49.200]  Zuckerberg and Tim Cook, but it's okay because Tim Cook's gay, so it's okay if he runs slave
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.200]  factories.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.200]  It's just incredible, David.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.200]  Yeah.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.800]  And when you look at what's happening in Toronto, for example, Google or Alphabet has got their
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.800]  sidewalk labs.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.640]  Now, that is their smart city.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.800]  And I talk about this a lot.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.480]  I talk about self-driving cars, the smart cities, which are part of the UN 2030 agenda.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.480]  They've gotten very specific.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.240]  It's not agenda 21 anymore.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.720]  It's now 2030 that they want this to happen.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.240]  They want to be able to control your movement.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.200]  You know, when we talk about this being a war, what do they tell the troops?
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.760]  You got to learn how to shoot, move, and communicate, right?
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.200]  Well, they want to make sure that you can't shoot.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.720]  They want to make sure you can't communicate.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:22.720]  That's the First and Second Amendment.
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.520]  They also want to make sure that you can't move.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.960]  They want to get you in the cities.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.360]  They want to control your transportation.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.560]  It's kind of like what Matt Drudge said about the ghetto.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:33.000]  He said, yeah, they want everybody in their little ghetto.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.120]  Once they get you in there, they're going to shut the doors and turn on the gas, and
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.840]  that's what they're going to do in these smart cities.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.280]  And now let's come back and talk about that.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.520]  These are like Roche motels.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.440]  They're luring people into to be trendy, these little bubble cities that are the beta test
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.480]  of how cool it is to be a slave, how cool it is to have a microchip, now in Sweden to
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.000]  get on the trains and buses.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.120]  This is not coming.
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.120]  It's here.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:58.280]  The Mark of the Beast is now here, and it was made in America, deployed in China.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:04.080]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winner

[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:27.220]  Live from The InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:36.820]  The battle between the truly ruthless, psychopathic, murderous, global technocrats,
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:43.460]  allied with communist China, radical Islam, the EU, Hollywood, and their leftist hordes,
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:50.180]  lusting for total control, a panopticonic system trillions of times more evil than you
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:55.740]  could even imagine in Orwell's worst nightmares, visited with every human action, every system
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:07:02.740]  tracked in real time, fed through algorithms to then not let you travel or meet people or
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:09.180]  have a life unless you conform to how they demand you conform by increments towards total
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:15.540]  and absolute annihilation of the family of the individual, designed to make you depressed,
[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:20.060]  designed to make you under their control in their own admissions from Sean Parker and
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:21.060]  others.
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:25.540]  You ask, well, why are they all having these executives say Facebook's evil, all this stuff's
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:29.660]  meant to lower your IQ control you because the vampire has to ask permission to come
[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:35.940]  in metaphysically and all the time and space for some reason, you see it at every level
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:41.500]  above and below that they have to tell you what they're going to do to you before they
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.500]  do it.
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:47.060]  And I remember years ago being told by globalists in the off record discussions I had with
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:51.700]  some of them that, oh, you're allowed to operate because we think people are cowards and you're
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.780]  just going to make them submit and condition them.
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:55.820]  Obviously you serve a purpose, well, that was their delusion.
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:59.420]  They decided, I really don't serve that purpose, see, they believe you're stupid, they believe
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:00.420]  you're failed.
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:06.340]  They told me, they said it in front of John Harmon in just one of many conversations,
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:10.380]  that you've bet on the wrong people, humanity's ugly, it's done, we're going to clean them
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:14.260]  up and get rid of them, we're doing all this evil stuff to get control and save the planet,
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:15.620]  which they're not, obviously.
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:19.140]  The GMO, all of it, they're the main authors of saying, we'll make a thousand worlds, we
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:22.540]  have to absorb this one to build the new one, we're going to merge the machines, humanity's
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:23.540]  obsolete.
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:26.020]  You think everything else is obsolete?
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:33.300]  They project their own predatory psychosis onto us and then they build a system to make
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:37.940]  us weak and ugly and stupid so that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, but the feedback
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:40.100]  loop only makes them uglier.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:44.220]  And so David, get into the Mark of the Beast, Made in America, the Big Breaking News, Rudd
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:50.100]  Report.com, Mainstream News, Zuckerberg's been secretly tracking everything you do and creating
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:56.300]  detailed algorithms of who you are and targeting you with ads and giving you different prices.
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:59.580]  Amazon got caught doing this, we had to hit refresh, so notice if I went to the bar, like
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:04.540]  Expedia or whatever, you go in there and because they think you have money, they'll sit there
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.820]  and charge you more for plane tickets, you name it.
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:10.540]  And that came out a decade ago that these companies had cookies in new to charge you
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:11.540]  more or not.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:14.260]  I would never even think like that, to have cookies, I mean, these systems have cookies
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:18.620]  to work, but cookies to like, no, oh, this person's got more money or this person will
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:21.780]  pay more, so I'm going to have them see on display something more.
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:25.140]  Because the average person says, I don't care if they watch me, you know, it's like people
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:28.620]  that post what they bought for Christmas or got for Christmas on Facebook, they go, oh,
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:31.820]  I'm going to Cancun for a week and their house gets robbed because they said where they lived
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:34.020]  and what they had.
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:38.260]  You have doors on your house because criminals could come in, you have doors and windows
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:39.780]  because mosquitoes could come in.
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:44.180]  You don't lower your blinds at night because you're a bad person, you do it because instinctively
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:50.300]  you know that privacy is the essence of your freedom and the ethos from which true civilization
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.380]  and freedom and individuality can grow.
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.300]  So I'm going to shut up the segment the next.
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:58.860]  Get into these huge announcements, the admissions, the fact that Trump is clearly battling them
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:03.020]  toe to toe, coming out against Facebook with the discrimination because that's what this
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:04.020]  is.
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:07.900]  You know, we know the Nazis were bad, they put yellow stars on Jews and pink triangles
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:08.900]  on gays.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:15.140]  It's beyond that and it's all here and why would they miscalculate first and de-platform
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.140]  us?
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.140]  Everyone agrees now.
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.660]  It's blown up spectacularly.
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:20.380]  The ACLU has come out against it.
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:22.460]  Everybody you can imagine starting to turn the tide.
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:26.940]  They tried to sell this whole thing as their rollout of the new social score of de-platforming
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:27.940]  people.
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:31.420]  That's what the social score is, folks, if you're not a good slave and now the intimidation
[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:33.420]  isn't working because I'm sorry.
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:41.060]  We haven't been under 5,000 years of feudal Chinese legalistic control, David Knight.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.060]  We know Alex.
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:46.460]  I think when we look at what's going on in the last couple of days and what we've seen
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:51.380]  with this meeting that we've seen the notes of from January 2017, just a couple of months
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.820]  after the election, they said, look, we got hammered.
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:58.540]  We're going to take it back by taking over social media and shutting down other voices.
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.300]  That's what went wrong.
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:04.780]  And I think that at a time, Alex, and I've talked about this before, one of the first
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:08.740]  reports I did when I came here to InfoWars, I talked about the fourth turning, a cyclical
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:09.740]  view of history.
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:12.620]  It came from Strauss and how a couple of guys went back 500 years.
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:18.700]  I looked at like an 80-year cycle of history as things ramp up as different generations
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:22.020]  react differently to the same kind of stimulus.
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:24.900]  They understand that we're at a turning point right now.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:29.140]  They have to come out and expose themselves even if it's going to be harmful to them
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:32.340]  because we're getting to that point in history.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:37.940]  And when you go back and you look at DARPA and you look at Google and you look at the
[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:41.380]  Facebook and so forth, you understand they're playing the long game.
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:46.340]  If we go back to the mid-1950s, we had the Milgram experiment where you had people that
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:50.700]  would obey authority, you know, they had the little gag that was set up, everybody's seen
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:56.940]  it in the Ghostbusters that Bill Murray kind of made fun of it, where you've got somebody
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:00.540]  that is administering electric shock when they don't give the right answer.
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:04.620]  Well, in the Milgram experiment, they were giving them electric shock and the person
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.300]  was pretending to be electric shock.
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:07.540]  So it was kind of a gag there.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:11.940]  They wanted to see if the person who was running the machine would administer that and yes,
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:12.940]  they would.
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:17.060]  In 67% of the cases, they would go all the way up to a lethal dosage and they reenacted
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:19.740]  this in a French TV game show.
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:23.540]  Also at the same time, they had the Ash experiment where they would take one person, put them
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:28.620]  in a crowd of people and they would have, you know, a simple question like which line
[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:33.220]  is longer and most of the people would go along with the crowd even when they knew that
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:34.780]  was the wrong answer.
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:38.940]  So you take a look at these two things and 10 years after the Ash experiment where they
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:44.140]  were showing the power of herd mentality, the power of peer pressure, you have this guy
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:49.500]  at DARPA, JCR Licklider, who is considered to be the father of the Internet, not Al Gore.
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:53.220]  This guy actually was a psychologist working for DARPA.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:54.220]  He gave it the name.
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:56.340]  He called it the intergalactic computer network.
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:57.940]  We now call that the Internet.
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.020]  He was a psychologist.
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:02.660]  He was well aware of these experiments by Milgram and Acre.
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:08.820]  I read two of his papers as you know, you read them on air.
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:14.540]  He said we need to be able to track the stimuli of the carrot stick and that's why, that's
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:20.780]  why whenever the head of Twitter talks to Stelter like he's an idiot, he goes, listen,
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:24.820]  we're conditioning Jones to behave and we're mind controlling him.
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:25.820]  Exactly.
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:29.940]  And then Darcy says, and you will submit Jones or you'll be blown out the airlock.
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:31.780]  Well, fire away, baby.
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:32.780]  Let's go.
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:36.220]  But you're not going to get sued, Darcy.
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:39.340]  You're not going to get sued for kicking me off your platform.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:42.580]  You're going to get sued for going along with the fact that you said, and you agree that
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:44.100]  I said take guns after the media.
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.820]  I did not say that.
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:49.500]  You will not defame me with the media while you pull that Darcy.
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:50.860]  Go ahead.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.940]  Well, you know, I've played the clip many times of Michael Hayden going to the Washington
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:14:00.020]  Lee Law School, talking to the students there and saying, we're not interested in bad people.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:02.060]  We're interested in interesting people.
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:06.220]  Well, that would be people like you, Alex, people like me, people who are who are interested
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:07.220]  in what they're doing.
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.500]  We're going to get the 1984 treatment.
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.540]  The rest of people get the brave new world treatment.
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:11.540]  Right.
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:15.380]  And so when you get the psychological, and that's what you want to, you're totally on
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:21.820]  it, we'll explain it when we come back, but continuing the 1984 versus the Pavlovian brave
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:22.820]  new world.
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:29.140]  But get into what they did with the whole system where they were claiming that we said
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:31.460]  they were going to invade Texas and Jade Helm.
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:32.460]  We never said that.
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:36.380]  But what Jade Helm documents were when we come back, we'll break down that it was admittedly
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:41.500]  having the military and others interface with the social media and surveillance to take control
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.140]  the population.
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:44.140]  That's right.
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.140]  That's right.
[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:46.140]  That's right.
[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:47.140]  Social intelligence, the fastest growing part of the internet.
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:51.420]  You know, when we go from the 1950s and 60s where they say, hey, you know, we could use
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:55.020]  this as a tool of psychological control and manipulation because when they put out a false
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:58.660]  narrative from the Washington Post and the New York Times or CNN, they want to know if
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.660]  that's working.
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:01.780]  So they want to be able to monitor people's conversations.
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:02.780]  Are they buying this?
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:05.340]  Do we need to tweak it here and adjust it there?
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:06.780]  And so that's the important thing.
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:12.580]  When they were just doing black propaganda or white propaganda with radios, they didn't
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.380]  know how it was, how people were accepting that.
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:18.620]  But the internet gives them the perfect control feedback loop.
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:25.420]  And so in the late 1990s, you have these organizations team with the venture capitalists that are
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:28.540]  creating Google that are creating Facebook, you know, they're getting a lot of attention
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:31.500]  because they had total information awareness and they had the life log.
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:34.500]  Well, they said, forget about the life log where we track everything everybody does.
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.860]  We can call that Facebook and we can fund them with Incutel and these other venture
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:38.860]  capitalists.
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:39.860]  And we come back.
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:40.860]  Let's talk about it.
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:46.540]  We believe their whole technocracy would be based on this grid, but now we have organically
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:53.420]  hacked it and used it to relaunch a human renaissance project, a pro human operation.
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:54.420]  And they're literally panicking.
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:57.260]  We'll be back with David Knight.
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:01.060]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S. What
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:05.780]  if I told you for just 54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:07.700]  at heart and body extract.

[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.220]  Don't just take my word for it.

[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:31.220]  Healthcare reform is confusing, but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan,
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:35.300]  keeping your doctor or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare
[01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:37.900]  system has become a challenge.

[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:15.900]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:20.060]  It is well known in traditional medicine for exuding properties.
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:24.300]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:29.500]  to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and

[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:35.740]  Another turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:41.540]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:47.540]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme

[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:49.060]  organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon
[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:51.740]  for maximum prebiotic effect.

[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:30.260]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:37.260]  I've been watching his wife's show, we've been talking a lot, she's a great lady.
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:44.260]  Man, he's got the spirit of America in him, you get in person, 10 years and you're like,
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:45.260]  feel good.
[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:46.260]  Feel it.
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.260]  That soul.
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:48.260]  Got something deep down.
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.260]  I got something.
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:50.260]  Tells me.
[01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:51.260]  What to do.
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:56.260]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:21:05.260]  We're looking for the animating contest.
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:11.260]  We're not starting the fight, but if you're pushing one, you came to the right place.
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:16.260]  All right, let's go back to David Knight.
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:23.700]  David, I get frantic talking about this because we're watching them build our present.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:29.220]  Real intelligence is just studying what's actually going on, not what somebody's saying.
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:32.260]  And we've watched what they built and then now they admit it's exactly what we said it
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:36.620]  was and it's covered in blood and evil.
[01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:40.380]  And then it's a bunch of people with fake liberal virtue signaling on stuff that doesn't
[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:41.380]  even matter.
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:46.340]  Oh, Confederate statues, oh, the cops are killing black people, you know, it's like a couple
[01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:52.380]  hundred a year, it's terrible, some of it's wrongs, in some cases it's justified.
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:58.180]  But it's literal red herrings to distract and everybody's like these little babies pouting
[01:21:58.180 --> 01:21:59.660]  and complaining, hating America.
[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:05.060]  And it's literally run by this multinational combine that, as you said, has China as its
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:10.060]  big ally, it's unbelievable.
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:13.620]  But you know, like, so we've had William Benion multiple times and one of the things that
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:19.740]  he said one time and I interviewed him that really stood out was he said, what we have
[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:21.580]  here in America now.
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:25.620]  It's far worse than anything that the Stasi ever had in East Germany.
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:30.420]  He spent decades as a global technical head of the NSA observing East Germany and the
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.420]  Stasi.
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:35.580]  And the reason for that is because of the technological leverage that they have in terms
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:36.580]  of watching people.
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:37.580]  And as we're talking about...
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:41.700]  And they were the bad guys, they were the evil guys for doing one, one millionth of
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:46.700]  this and then David Brock brags that they're in all of our accounts watching us and listening
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:48.260]  to us and the New York Times does.
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:52.340]  This is all illegal and how exciting is it for you to see Trump now on the fair housing
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:57.020]  discrimination angle, which all of this obviously tracks who you are, manipulates because of
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.860]  what they have on you.
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:04.220]  It's, again, billions of times more out of control than they're not running to somebody
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:05.220]  because of what color they are.
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:06.220]  And that's wrong too.
[01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:10.500]  This is unbelievable, but they use, again, the liberal packaging to get away with it.
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:15.860]  Well, you know, it all is a system of technocratic control.
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:19.260]  So it's all the things that tyrants have always wanted to do to control people, but it's now
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:24.020]  merged with a very sophisticated technology like we talked about, middle of the 20th century.
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:26.860]  Understanding after the Nuremberg trials, you know, we just had this guy deported back
[01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:33.420]  to Germany because he was a prison guard at one of the prison camps there.
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:35.980]  But they understood that, you know, people will just follow orders.
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:38.660]  And so they said, well, we need to get some kind of a feedback mechanism.
[01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:42.780]  So in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, you had two things happen.
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:46.900]  They created and worked, they had the venture capital firms that were creating Google and
[01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:50.740]  Facebook and these other companies, they were being funded by venture capital firms that
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:55.260]  had DARPA and Incutel, you know, working with them.
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:58.220]  People that were running DARPA were sitting on the boards of these venture capital firms.
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:02.540]  You had Incutel, which was a venture capital firm itself created by the CIA.
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:06.700]  They actually came out and did that to create these organizations so that they didn't have
[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:10.380]  to be the ones doing it, just like they don't have to be the ones doing the censorship right
[01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:11.380]  now.
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:12.380]  They can have these people doing it.
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:15.660]  And they created things that they also started geospatial intelligence.
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:20.260]  The fastest growing part of the intelligence and surveillance community is geospatial
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:21.260]  intelligence.
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:22.260]  What is that?
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:27.020]  That's mapping who you are, what you believe, who your friends are, putting it on a map.
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:30.540]  Activity-based intelligence, they call it ABI, human domain analytics.
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:31.540]  Is that sound familiar?
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:32.540]  And the Pentagon.
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:35.700]  Jade Helm thing you talked about was mastering the human domain and that's been a big part
[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:37.100]  of their geospatial intelligence.
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:42.300]  And let's be clear, they didn't give this map of the world that the Pentagon has to
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:43.300]  do.
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:45.500]  But the Southern Poverty Law Center, two media matters.
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:46.500]  And that's what's incredible.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:47.980]  And that's my big question for you.
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:50.980]  This is the key to everything, in my view.
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:53.180]  They're getting ready for a false flag against the media.
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:56.380]  They're priming it everywhere, lying about me and lying about you, lying about everybody,
[01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:59.100]  lying about Trump saying we want violence and just flat out doing it.
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.540]  They wouldn't be doing that unless they're planning something to make themselves the
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:03.420]  victims as the October surprise.
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.740]  So we'll get your take on that.
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:10.940]  But pulling back from this, Trump said, hey, what you're doing Twitter is illegal with
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:14.140]  shadow manning stop it, other stop it, they backed off a little.
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:17.020]  But now with Facebook, Google, Apple, they're all far worse.
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:19.820]  They're in bed with China, far worse and I'm not just defending Twitter because we're
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:20.820]  still on there.
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:23.460]  It's like a baby when it comes to the true evil stuff.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.060]  They aren't running slave factories in China.
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:27.940]  So Jack Dorsey doesn't have any blood on his hands that I know of.
[01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:32.140]  But these others are true monsters and he's just a junior player.
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:36.980]  So the fact that Senator Warner three weeks ago had an internal memo going around that's
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:40.020]  now public saying we're going to take over, we're going to shut down the Internet and
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:42.780]  we're going to take over all the big tech companies because, you know, the government
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:43.780]  said ship to begin with.
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.260]  He went ahead and said the truth.
[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:49.740]  If you don't submit to us and shut down Trump and they followed the order.
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:54.140]  So somewhere in there, they're now not listening to the president because I'll just tell folks,
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:58.060]  okay, I'll tell you who actually runs Google, okay, the Pentagon told them to put me back
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:04.220]  on YouTube in February, I told her by we're going back up, Pentagon told them to do it.
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:07.580]  So we've gotten to the point where the Pentagon said you put Jones back on.
[01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:08.580]  Okay.
[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:11.180]  I'm sure people can see all the Department of Defense ads that we had on there.
[01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:13.580]  But the point is, is that this is a civil war, folks.
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:16.660]  And I'm not saying the Pentagon's perfect, but they said, no, the Chinese don't call
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:20.180]  the shots, put Jones back on and they were told by the president.
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.820]  Now they don't care now.
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:25.820]  They're ignoring the president and he's saying you're, I will not tolerate this.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:26.820]  This is illegal.
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:27.900]  It's a lot bigger than Alex Jones.
[01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:28.900]  I'm coming after you.
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:29.900]  Now he is.
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:31.940]  Do people realize how epic this is?
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:32.940]  I mean, this is epic.
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:34.860]  We'll come back more or not, but go ahead.
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:37.540]  I mean, I should have opened the show with that because it's so big.
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:39.540]  I can't even get how big this is.
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:42.780]  It's like the Trump is the real McCoy.
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:45.660]  Thank Jesus Christ of Nazareth for Donald Trump.
[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:46.660]  I'm serious.
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:47.660]  Thank God.
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:48.660]  Go ahead.
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:51.180]  We know they're talking about hacking the election.
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.180]  That has been the narrative.
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:55.180]  But then they come back and they say, well, we're not actually talking about, you know,
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:59.620]  hacking, getting into the electronic voting machines, getting into the state boards of
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:03.260]  elections, totaling up all the elections and so forth.
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:06.620]  No, we're just saying that somebody told the truth about Hillary Clinton.
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:10.020]  So they want to hack this election by making sure that nobody tells the truth about Hillary
[01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:11.300]  Clinton and the Democrats.
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:13.500]  And they made that clear in that January memo.
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.500]  That was the training wheels.
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.940]  And once they got them to do that, why not do everything?
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:18.940]  That's right.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:19.940]  That's right.
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:20.940]  Well, what they said in that was they said, we're going to do two things.
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:23.540]  We're going to impeach Trump or we're going to defeat him in 2020.
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:27.220]  The way we're going to do that is by shutting down these other voices and doing it with
[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:29.580]  shutting them down using social media.
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:31.340]  And so they can impeach Trump.
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:32.340]  That's the election here.
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:33.340]  They're trying to hack the election.
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:34.340]  And it's all premeditated.
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:35.340]  It's all premeditated.
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:37.340]  That's right.
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.340]  David, why is it so premeditated?
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:40.300]  I guess they're hiding it in plain view.
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:43.420]  Why the hell would they tell us they're doing something this illegal?
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:48.620]  Well, I think it's because they're looking at this 2030 timeframe.
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:53.820]  They understand that they have to strike when the population is in the right mood.
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:55.540]  That's when they can get a revolution.
[01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:57.860]  And I think that when they're looking at this election, I think they're going to try to
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:58.860]  hack it in two ways.
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:01.360]  Number one is to control speech.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:06.300]  The second way, Alex, which is our election system with all these electronic machines
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:10.420]  when they talk about hacking this machine, it is very, very vulnerable.
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:11.420]  And it is very easy.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:12.700]  Look, you've had the Pentagon hacked.
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:14.260]  You've had the CIA hacked.
[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:18.540]  Everybody forgets about the vault seven stuff that was put out there by WikiLeaks showing
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:20.260]  that they can make it look like they're anybody.
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:24.060]  So when Microsoft is putting this stuff out and all the Democrats are talking about, oh,
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:25.060]  the Russians are coming.
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:26.300]  The Russians are coming.
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.900]  They know that they can get into these machines and hack them.
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:31.740]  The first electronic machines came out of Venezuela.
[01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:32.740]  And you see the cover.
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:33.740]  They're the enemy.
[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:34.740]  They're with the Chai comms.
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:35.740]  They're killing America.
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:36.740]  They're trying to kill the stock market.
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:37.900]  They're trying to stop America being great again.
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:39.980]  They're trying to, you know, end freedom on the web.
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:42.820]  And so they go, the Russians, the Russian, cropping Jones and drugs.
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:43.820]  They're all Russians.
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:44.820]  David Nights are Russian.
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:45.820]  No.
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:46.820]  You're the traders.
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:47.820]  You're the globalist.
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:48.820]  You hate America.
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:49.820]  You say America was never great.
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.060]  You say it'll never be great.
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:53.180]  You are the enemy by your own words.
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:54.580]  You're stinking scum.
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:29:00.620]  If you like alkaline water or know someone that does, you're going to love the Dillon

[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:08.940]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:14.020]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen
[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:18.620]  and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:23.020]  read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using
[01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:27.100]  your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:33.260]  X2, the SuperMail Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Myko ZX Body.
[01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:34.260]  It's all amazing.
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:35.260]  Thank you, brother.
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:39.580]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:43.980]  the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:49.140]  you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God and I wanted to say that
[01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:54.380]  it's an honor to stand side-by-side with you, the crew and the listeners out there, 1770s

[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:27.260]  I want planet Earth's victory like the president wants.

[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:44.020]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:49.740]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:52.820]  David Knight, one year anniversary of him hosting his own syndicated radio slash TV
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:55.460]  program and working with us over six years now doing a great job.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:34:00.900]  It is right in the shotgun with me and we're going to get into this now.
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:05.980]  The Democrats, David Brock, Media Matters, all the documents are public on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:09.900]  Chinese social scores, tracking everything you do, they're in your accounts, they're
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:15.060]  monitoring everything you do, they're spying on you, they're deleting everything.
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:16.260]  This is true authoritarianism.
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:19.580]  They are the modern book burners but they're also stealing your data but the companies
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:20.980]  claim well you opted into it.
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:25.940]  Well Trump is suing them over the discriminatory practices by tracking people according to
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:31.940]  what race they are, what color or ethnicity or sexual preference.
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:35.460]  Everything on the left says they're against, they're the ones doing it in spades.
[01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:36.460]  That's their cover story.
[01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:40.220]  Now, David, I want you to walk through this because it's so critical.
[01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:44.700]  The Democrats have basically hidden in plain view and announced their takeover plan and
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:49.180]  they've said, Senator Warner, Senator Murphy, we're going to steal the election, we're
[01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:53.020]  going to shut everybody down ahead of it, we're going to, I mean the Democrats are
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:56.460]  announcing, they're telling illegal aliens go ahead and vote, major cities are legalizing
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:57.460]  them voting.
[01:34:57.460 --> 01:35:02.220]  They are clearly making their move all in, they've got their people in a crazed fury.
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:07.980]  They're openly having crowds say America was never great, it'll never be great, yay.
[01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:10.860]  I mean they've really trained them to hate America.
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:14.060]  They have no idea what China and other countries are like where you've been.
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:18.740]  So get into how you think they're going to try to make this move and how we, how we
[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:23.940]  stop them, just summing up right now everything we're facing and how critical it is.
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:28.820]  This get out and thank God Trump is now moving against them, but with only 77 days, I can
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:32.380]  just feel in my spirit the earnestness of this moment.
[01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:36.380]  You know, Alex, as we said earlier, that memo says it all, says we're going to impeach
[01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:37.380]  Trump.
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:41.740]  Well, they can impeach Trump if they win a majority of the House and Senate in this
[01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:42.740]  next election.
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:43.740]  So this is very key.
[01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:46.460]  They can impeach him and not have to defeat him in 2020.
[01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:49.940]  The way they do that is to control the narrative.
[01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:54.500]  They're saying that we hacked the election because we told the truth about Hillary Clinton
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:55.940]  in 2016.
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:58.860]  That's how pathetic this is, but they actually have another strategy.
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:01.180]  You know they're not going to put all of their eggs in one basket.
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:02.180]  These people never do.
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:03.180]  They're too clever.
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:04.460]  So they've got a couple of different strategies.
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:08.740]  Number one, to control the narrative and to only put out their narrative about what is
[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:09.740]  going on.
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:13.000]  The second thing I think is really to hack the election.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.500]  These electronic voting machines are very, very vulnerable. The first electronic voting
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:19.020]  machines are created by Smartmatic in Venezuela.
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:21.540]  It's created by friends of Hugo Chavez.
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:23.940]  They created the voting machine so they could rig the elections.
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:28.080]  And Smartmatic was accused of rigging and being involved in election rigging throughout
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:30.500]  Central and South America and to Brazil.
[01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:36.980]  That communist lady that was elected president there, they flipped the narrative there.
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:40.020]  Everybody knew from looking at the exit polls that they had rigged that election.
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:44.180]  And of course here in America, we never, we have one corporation that does exit polls
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:48.300]  just like they're doing the Central and South America, but they never tell us what the total
[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:49.300]  vote total is.
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:53.380]  When you get that one organization that does the exit polling, they only give you demographic
[01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:54.380]  breakdown.
[01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:57.140]  They say, well, this many men, this many women voted for that candidate.
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:04.100]  This many white people, this many black people and so forth, but they never look at the election,
[01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:07.340]  the exit polls and compare that to the actual results.
[01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:11.300]  The State Department does and when they see a difference of more than 4%, they say that
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:12.380]  election was rigged.
[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:18.020]  And so we know that Smartmatic and other companies were involved in election rigging in Philippines
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:21.100]  and Brazil and Mexico and many other places.
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:27.740]  They are a major vendor here, but they've just had at DEF CON and the Black Hat Conference
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:32.340]  in Vegas that they have every August, they had kids come in and they hacked replicas
[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:35.500]  of the state boards of election where they total up all this stuff.
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.340]  It is very easy to do.
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:41.620]  It was a 11-year-old girl who rigged it in just a matter of minutes, but they had kids
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:45.380]  from like 5 to 17 that said, we're going to show you how easy this is, that even a kid
[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:49.860]  can do it and they don't need to have access to the actual machine that can do it by the
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:50.860]  internet.
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:52.220]  If it's connected to the internet, it's even easier.
[01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:53.220]  Exactly.
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:54.340]  And Trump had such a giant landslide.
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:58.740]  We know they stole at least five states, tried to steal six others.
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:02.740]  Local Homeland Security said, no, we were watching federal Homeland Security come into
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:06.060]  the computer's lifetime and we're blocking them.
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:07.060]  So I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:10.980]  Well, if it's enough of a landslide, they know they can't get away with it.
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:15.420]  If it's a close election, they can nudge it in one direction and people say, well, okay,
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:16.420]  I guess that's it.
[01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:21.140]  But if it is a landslide, they can nudge it and they did that in certain areas.
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:24.060]  And so that, I think, is a key thing that we're going to see there.
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:25.060]  Let me ask you this.
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:31.980]  I'll make your point, but then clearly, I mean, they're saying we're going to be violent.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:32.980]  The New York Times is being death-threaded.
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:37.020]  You know, I mean, they're such liars, I guarantee it's them and they're just a scum of the earth,
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:38.020]  folks.
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:39.260]  Nobody wants violence against these scum.
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:42.260]  They make themselves the martyrs.
[01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:43.820]  They're the biggest liars on the planet.
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:45.220]  They say the president's going to be violent.
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:46.220]  I'm going to be violent.
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:49.300]  New York Times printed it that I said, attack them with guns.
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.300]  I never said it.
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:51.300]  They don't even show it.
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:56.340]  They are criminal liars, committed to evil, committed to fraud, committed to deception,
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:39:00.500]  literally, and authorized to engage in it and just a hysterical point of they'll do
[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:05.780]  anything now, so what do you expect them to pull knowing that they're such criminal liars?
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:10.740]  Well, I think, like I said, I think they're going to rig it with the speech.
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:13.940]  I think they're going to rig it with the machines and then they're going to blame it
[01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:16.740]  on the Russians if they get caught with their finger in the tail.
[01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:20.740]  That's why they're setting up this thing, but I want to get back to what, you know,
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:23.420]  is at the center of this and the way that they've attacked you because we've talked
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:27.220]  about the history of how they have set up these control mechanisms going back to the
[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:28.300]  mid-20th century.
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:34.260]  The major changes that took place around the year 2000, late 1990s and 2000, how they've
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:39.620]  set these structures up, but if we go back to the beginnings of free speech, a landmark
[01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:45.180]  case of John Peter Zinger, Alex, that was back in the 1730s and what was he guilty of?
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:46.180]  It was a New York paper.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:52.900]  He was criticizing the governor for corruption and the governor came back at him with a defamation
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:53.900]  trial.
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:54.900]  This is the way they attacked the president.
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:56.900]  This is what they're doing to attack you.
[01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:00.940]  And in that trial, the judge said, well, truth is no defense.
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:05.300]  And it wasn't legally because he was saying it, but the jury nullified that.
[01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:08.340]  And here's the point I want to leave with the audience here.
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:14.180]  We were never given by the government freedom of speech and the freedom of press.
[01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:17.420]  We had that taken by juries, by other people.
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:19.980]  We had a revolution over those issues.
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:23.420]  We took those freedoms and we're going to have to take those freedoms again.
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:26.980]  They're not going to be handed to us on high by some savior anywhere.
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:28.740]  We have to take those things back.
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:29.740]  Those are important.
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:31.900]  They are fundamental human rights.
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:34.860]  And it's going to be during nullification, it's going to be people acting at the local
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:35.860]  level.
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:39.420]  It's going to be us taking these tools of the internet that they meant for evil and
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:40.620]  turning them to good.
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:42.940]  That's really what's going to turn this thing around.
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:47.500]  And it's the same tactics that we're seeing used against you, you know, truth is no defense.
[01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:51.340]  We're going to come after you for defamation and we're going to shut you down on that
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:55.940]  basis when it was exactly what you're talking about is exposing the corruption of Hillary
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:41:00.300]  Clinton and the deep state and they're going to try to turn that thing around on us.
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:05.980]  We have had the alphabet agencies in Washington, the swamp have been making the rules for these
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:09.380]  unelected, unaccountable agencies have been making the rules.
[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:12.780]  And of course, when they make the rules, the federal government and the justice department
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:14.420]  pretends that you don't have any protections.
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:16.300]  You don't have any presumption of innocence.
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:20.900]  You don't have any right to a trial by jury and they can impose excessive fines.
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:26.500]  You've seen this happen with all these different alphabet agencies and now we have alphabet
[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:31.220]  the company and they're going to make the rules and we've got the mob on the street
[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:35.860]  applauding this, the people who have always hated corporations and big business.
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:38.940]  They are applauding the biggest corporations we've ever had.
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:43.540]  The mob as you're talking about is celebrating the fact that we have these small number of
[01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:48.860]  individuals setting the rules for us, working in tandem with the Chinese government and
[01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:50.580]  these other globalist institutions.
[01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:51.580]  And it's crazy.
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:53.380]  It's crazy to censor free speech in the internet.
[01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:54.380]  Exactly.
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:57.260]  When I run into the leftist on the street, they just go, look, you're bad, you're bad
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:58.260]  like it hurts me.
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:41:59.820]  And I'm like, I'm not the bad one.
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:02.540]  You're the ones allied with the chai comms and the globalists and these trillion dollar
[01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:06.980]  companies that have literal suicide nets and forced abortion.
[01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:11.380]  And I've been right about everything and then you've got some made up thing in your head
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:13.220]  that I was mean to kids or something.
[01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:17.660]  I mean, it's just crazy how a lot of these leftists at the grassroots, they really believe
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:19.060]  their own BS, David.
[01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:21.300]  Oh, yeah, because they don't see anything else.
[01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:22.980]  Alex, it goes back to what we're saying.
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:23.980]  Control the narrative.
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:28.380]  The mockingbird press as the CIA came out there, they only say, oh, look, Alex, he said
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:29.380]  this and that.
[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:32.300]  They take the characterizations that are put out there by the New York Times, by the Washington
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:33.300]  Post.
[01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:34.300]  And that's all these people see.
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:35.700]  They don't look at the videos.
[01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:38.620]  They don't look at what you actually said because truth is no defense.
[01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:41.020]  I want to do a few more minutes with you and I'm going to let you go get some lunch.
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:44.420]  You know, you've been up since three a.m. with your morning show at eight a.m. with
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:45.420]  the real news.
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:48.900]  But I want to ask you the question, why do you think they finally pulled the plug on
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:49.900]  us?
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:50.900]  That was a bold move.
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:51.900]  They admit it backfired now.
[01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:57.380]  So what's next straight ahead info wars dot com.

[01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:05.140]  First demonize info wars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:06.140]  to that.
[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:10.460]  Then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:17.020]  children and Islamophobia and then voila, 2 weeks later ban info wars completely off

[01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:04.660]  It take hours.
[01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:06.980]  Michael's DX plus now has a lower price.
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:08.140]  It's stronger.
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:09.700]  It's the other equation in probiotics.

[01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:36.500]  You can also swallow it.
[01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:42.540]  It's a supplement with iodine, a super high quality silver and a lot more without you.
[01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:43.540]  We couldn't do it.
[01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:47.740]  So thank you all for remembering info wars store dot com and remembering that it's not
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:52.060]  just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential
[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:53.060]  to spread the word.
[01:46:53.060 --> 01:47:04.060]  And again, thank you so much for being part of the second American Revolution.
[01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:28.820]  Epic history is happening now.
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:30.860]  We're going to open the phones up in the next hour.
[01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:34.900]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us in the fourth, always a powerhouse of information.
[01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:39.540]  David Knight, one year anniversary of the real news weekday mornings, 8 a.m. central.
[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:48.740]  That's 9 a.m. Eastern, 7 a.m. mountain, 6 a.m. Pacific.
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:53.260]  We are the most censored platform in the world as the first domino.
[01:47:53.260 --> 01:47:58.140]  They soften this up with their artillery for years lying about us.
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:01.900]  And then they thought this will be the first domino will get the public to accept the platforming
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:06.300]  and the global social credit score, which they now admit Facebook and Google and others
[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:09.860]  are bringing to America to track and trace everything you do, then not let you buy or
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:12.340]  sell if you aren't a good little globalist.
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:13.340]  That's what this is.
[01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:16.500]  They're trying to take our banking away or taking one of our payment processors.
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:20.740]  The Jihad Watch just lost that, so that's how historical this is.
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:26.100]  And David, I held you over for several reasons, and I appreciate you coming on with this.
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:35.220]  I just cannot overstate how epic this historical moment is and how crazy this is.
[01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:39.300]  And I want to ask you, because you're an engineer, a father and a business owner and
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:42.340]  a smart guy, why do you think they made the move?
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:47.540]  Because I do know Apple's at the top of the evil chain with China and the globalists.
[01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:48.980]  It's the worst.
[01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:55.020]  And Tim Cook is really a very dark state actor, and we know that he has Sunday meetings
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:57.180]  with the other tech heads on the phones.
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:03.180]  Why would they do it, though, in a whole Sherman-Annie Trust way, where it's so transparent?
[01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:04.580]  And I've got top law firms looked at it.
[01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:07.100]  They said, we're going to go ahead and ready to sue them all for no money.
[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:10.900]  I mean, you know, it's top ones, because this is like the case of the century.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:15.580]  What they're doing is totally illegal, and the consensus is the New York Times, the Washington
[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:20.900]  Post, all these groups are engaging in serious criminal activity, racketeering, getting into
[01:49:20.900 --> 01:49:24.700]  people's databases through these companies, going and intimidating people to lie, or they'll
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:26.180]  write bad stories about them.
[01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:30.620]  I warn folks, people have been recording them when they call, and they're desperate.
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:33.540]  They're like, just tell us something or we'll get you.
[01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:35.500]  Tell us, you know, tell us Jones is on drugs.
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:37.780]  Tell us Jones is having sex with men.
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:39.100]  Just tell us.
[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:43.660]  And they're so panicked, they've been ordered to do this or else, there's a hysteria, and
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:48.020]  all of this is so criminal that they wouldn't be doing it if they didn't think a total revolution
[01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:49.020]  was coming.
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:50.020]  They're counterrevolution.
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:53.780]  They're acting like crazed, maximum security prisoners.
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:57.180]  They are acting, you know, Phil Mudd, I never played at your stage, just blew up at a black
[01:49:57.180 --> 01:50:01.220]  cumsporter and started screaming and yelling and frothing on air.
[01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:04.860]  You know, that says we're going to kill President Trump, the former, he's given the orders for
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:05.860]  folks to kill people.
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:09.300]  He never did it himself, but he ran counterterrorism at the CIA.
[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:11.060]  I mean, these are crazy people.
[01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:13.500]  They are, they are just mad dog.
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:17.260]  Their religion is running our lives, literally.
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:21.780]  And so they're so crazed, they believe they have nothing to lose.
[01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:25.740]  They're going for broke, even though Trump has offered them abstention.
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:30.420]  Trump has offered them amnesty very wisely, hoping they would just defer and stop it.
[01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:32.020]  But they cannot stop it.
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:33.020]  It is spiritual.
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:38.100]  Yeah, you know, and it's also a time, it's the right time for them to do this.
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:39.860]  They must do it right now.
[01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:43.740]  And they have, they understand that they not only lost the election of President Trump,
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:48.620]  but they've lost the momentum, they've lost the narrative that people have awoken to their,
[01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:50.020]  what they're doing.
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:53.500]  We see this happening not only in the United States of President Trump, but of course we
[01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:54.500]  saw it with Brexit.
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:56.020]  We see it happening in Italy.
[01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:59.180]  You've got the Italian president there saying, we're not taking any more of these people
[01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:04.660]  without being able to vet them and saying, we're not going to enforce mandatory vaccines,
[01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:05.980]  a whole slew of things.
[01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:07.300]  You see it happening in Hungary.
[01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:10.820]  Now the people in Sweden have awakened to what's going on.
[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:14.580]  So they're looking at their globalist plans that are unraveling.
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:18.420]  And they knew that they had a cycle where everything was going to be lining up.
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:22.260]  Just take a look at how things have accelerated between the left and the right.
[01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:24.300]  Look at California, for example.
[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:27.820]  You've got people on both the left and the right wanting to either leave the United States
[01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:31.100]  or some people on the right saying, we want to leave California and stay in the United
[01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:32.100]  States.
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:38.460]  And so you have this kind of moment right now that comes along once every 70 or 80 years.
[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:43.140]  They know that at this point in time, things can either go towards more freedom and more
[01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:45.820]  local control, which is what populism is about.
[01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:50.140]  The populist movements are happening with Trump and Brexit and these other places in
[01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:53.220]  Western Europe, or they can move ahead with their agenda.
[01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:54.740]  This is a key moment for them.
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:59.740]  So even though they have to come out, take the mask off, expose themselves to jeopardy
[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:03.660]  and expose themselves to showing what's really going on, they know that the gig is up and
[01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:06.780]  they've got to do it right now or they're not going to get this done.
[01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:11.780]  You have these timings, these moments in history where everything really kind of lines up where
[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:13.260]  the population is right for this one.
[01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:15.820]  You go back and look at the Civil War, for example.
[01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:16.820]  If you go back to the...
[01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:17.820]  That is the exact...
[01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:19.260]  In fact, this is a great turning.
[01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:23.420]  You're right every generation, every 80 years it happens or so, but this is one of the mega
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:28.140]  turning happens every four or five generations, every couple hundred years, beyond Civil
[01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:29.140]  War.
[01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:31.260]  We are entering a 1776 lens.
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:32.260]  That's right.
[01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:37.860]  The Civil War was an echo of, but I agree all the parallels are there and the enemy knows
[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:44.900]  that and as you said is in full commitment because they lust, like a rapist lust after
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:48.780]  some woman, they lust after controlling virtuous people.
[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:50.740]  It is a form of psychic vampirism.
[01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:56.820]  Yeah, if you go back, again, going back to the fourth turning, the Great Depression and
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:53:00.020]  World War II, prior to that the Civil War, prior to that the American Revolution, but
[01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:02.700]  Strouse and Hell went back about 500 years taking a look at this.
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:03.700]  Renaissance.
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:07.540]  And I think the Civil War is kind of interesting because if you go back to 1828, you had the
[01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:11.180]  agrarian interest, you had the industrial interest, and you had tariffs that were set
[01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:12.180]  up.
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:16.180]  You almost had a Civil War and secession then in 1828.
[01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:19.620]  They called it the Tariff of Abomination and then they came back and they said...
[01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:21.500]  Mr. Jackson stopped that because he was a southerner.
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:22.500]  He was able to stop it.
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:23.500]  That's right.
[01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:26.420]  They came back with a nullification act, but it wasn't right.
[01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:31.740]  The timing wasn't right, even though what happened in 1860 was Sumptor and so forth.
[01:53:31.740 --> 01:53:37.500]  It's almost exactly the same thing that nearly happened in 1832, but they walked that back
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.960]  because the timing wasn't right.
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:42.500]  And then it happened again 30 years later.
[01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:44.140]  Right now the timing is going...
[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:45.340]  We got a crisis moment.
[01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:47.940]  It's dangerous and it's also an opportunity.
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:49.820]  And this is the time when things are going to change.
[01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:55.780]  The next 77 days are Luke Skywalker, one second from pulling the trigger and firing the torpedo
[01:53:55.780 --> 01:53:57.780]  down the reactor shaft.
[01:53:57.780 --> 01:54:01.660]  The next 77 days is like a blink of the eye in the time of humanity.
[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:04.420]  This is the most critical time in human history.
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:05.420]  David, do you agree?
[01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:11.300]  I agree because if they can stop Trump, it's going to be a major victory for them in terms
[01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:19.380]  of rolling back the populist movement, the movement for sovereign control, the unraveling
[01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:21.860]  that is happening in the European Union and so forth.
[01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:25.060]  Can you believe, as we've got to go, but can you believe that even though things are getting
[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:29.220]  better and it's so clear Trump's real, that the average minion of the system is only going
[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:31.500]  to be hurt by Trump failing, but they don't care.
[01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:35.220]  Their identity is in destroying their own salvation.
[01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:36.220]  It's insane.
[01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:37.980]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:39.100]  You take a look at what's going on.
[01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:40.100]  I reported earlier today.
[01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:46.780]  They have a 400% increase in just one year over African-American businesses.
[01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:51.700]  You also got President Trump doubling his popularity with African-Americans in just one
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:52.700]  year.
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:55.300]  So they're desperate to roll out things like Omarosa and so forth to try to pull that
[01:54:55.300 --> 01:54:56.300]  back.
[01:54:56.300 --> 01:54:58.740]  David, on fire as usual.
[01:54:58.740 --> 01:54:59.740]  Thank you so much.
[01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:00.740]  Paul Watson's coming up.
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:01.740]  I intend to open the phones up as well.
[01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:03.580]  So much big news we haven't gotten to yet.
[01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:06.820]  Speaking of communism, the white farmers are being kicked out in South Africa.
[01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:10.460]  The Zimbabwe paradigm is unfolding, thank you, David Knight.
[01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:13.100]  People can find you of course at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:14.100]  Thank you.
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:17.740]  Oh my gosh, this is such an epic time.
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:20.300]  I had three hours sleep last night because I was on coast to coast again with George
[01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:21.300]  Norrie.
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:23.100]  Great guy.
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:26.300]  Let me set the record straight to 10 million plus listeners that tune in every evening.
[01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:31.460]  16 million listeners total every week, but I feel like I had 10 hours sleep.
[01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:34.100]  It's just an incredible time and I'm very, very thankful to all of you.
[01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:37.500]  Listen, I should be plugging every segment because of some of the deficits we have.
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:45.420]  We lost a $3 million advertising package where I advertise our products, water filters, air
[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:50.740]  filters, water filters and supplements and they took us off Cridio, they took us off
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:54.540]  Ad Roll a year ago, a year and a half ago and they're just hitting us everywhere.
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:56.100]  This is sanctions by the deep state.
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:56:00.580]  It's globalist tax, totally criminal, concerted, record tearing on record.
[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:06.260]  They've been at the nose, so you can still bypass them and go to infowarstore.com and
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:08.060]  you are the info war.
[01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:12.700]  If you don't buy the products, if you don't sign up for auto ship so that every month or
[01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:15.980]  every two months, three months, you can cancel any time with one click on the website where
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:19.660]  the coffee comes or the supplements come.
[01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:22.140]  If you don't commit to it, we will be destroyed.
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:25.780]  Now listen, if that's in God's plan, that's the way it is, but I'm telling you, they didn't
[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:27.540]  like I'm flipping a coin here.
[01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:32.380]  You and your will and what you do along with God's blessing come together, but with two
[01:56:32.380 --> 01:56:35.660]  of us agree on on earth, God makes it so in heaven to quote the Bible.
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:36.660]  It's true.
[01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:39.900]  So fight the bully, save the internet, save info war special.
[01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:40.900]  I said I was going to stay.

[01:57:22.540 --> 01:57:24.420]  or over store shelves.
[01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:25.420]  Nobody does it.

[01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:12.740]  to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they

[01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:57.660]  Years ago, infowar's life created the powerful mycozx formula to help you combat internal
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:58:58.660]  yeast.
[01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:02.100]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:05.940]  we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:11.180]  Mycozx plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed

[02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:29.500]  You know this morning I was in there making breakfast with my four children and getting
[02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:35.460]  ready to take three up into school and I was exhausted and I was tired and I went in and
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:40.300]  brushed my teeth and I looked at my face, how old I looked and how exhausted and I just
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:42.340]  never looked better.
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:49.300]  And by that I mean I was so tired and so concerned about the world but knowing I was doing the
[02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:55.380]  right thing it was like my soul kicked in, you know what I'm talking about?
[02:00:55.380 --> 02:01:03.140]  And that's the thing about standing up against evil is that when you know you're doing the
[02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:07.420]  right thing, when you know you really know your facts and that you're leading the right
[02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:11.380]  life and you're going the way God wants you to go, there's not a better feeling because
[02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:16.260]  the left, their minions, more and more I'm actually know they're just part of an evil
[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:22.700]  nihilistic program, a criminal operating system, a spirit but their really low level minions
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:28.060]  are upset and freaked out and think everything's wrong and God I'm a good person but why is
[02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:35.060]  it so horrible, something's horrible because you're under evil and you're projecting on
[02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:45.380]  us that we're the evil when you're following the bad guys and it's not subjective.
[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:51.420]  The globalist openly in their own white papers want people poor and stupid.
[02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:56.300]  That's why I love David Nikes, he's actually a scholar and he's done a lot of research
[02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:59.860]  so when I hear him say things, he's saying things that nobody would know unless you'd
[02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:05.340]  actually read Bertrand Russell's books, which I've read a couple of them, oh my God and
[02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:09.620]  unless you've actually read Brave New World and then Brave New World revisited, that's
[02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:13.820]  a nonfiction book written in 1961 before Huxley died, you know the whole background
[02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:18.540]  of he was a part of a secret government breeding program and you know related to the Wedgewoods
[02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:24.140]  and the Darwin's and Galton and the creators of Eugenics and it just goes down a rabbit hole
[02:02:24.140 --> 02:02:29.260]  and you know this stuff, he was saying we're going to get the 1984 treatment, everybody
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:34.340]  else is going to get, there's only a few percent get the 1984 treatment, it was all debate
[02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:41.860]  about that, it's two systems that work together and of course he was actually related to Blair
[02:02:41.860 --> 02:02:47.940]  was part of that, on the periphery of that elite group, George Arwell, Eric Blair and
[02:02:47.940 --> 02:02:54.340]  so they had competing systems of how it would be done but Orwell genuinely didn't like it
[02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:57.940]  and said look I've been around the communists at the highest levels, they are people that
[02:02:57.940 --> 02:03:03.500]  want to have priest of power and hurt you, that's all they want is to make ugly architecture,
[02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:07.940]  ugly art, ugly culture and he said I don't like Hitler and he fought Hitler and the
[02:03:07.940 --> 02:03:12.660]  Spanish Civil War Hitler forces and he meant well but then he would go meet with the top
[02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:18.700]  communists, he's like my god they're as bad as the Nazis and so but you know I heard
[02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:25.660]  Knight just mentioning people like he and I and then Matt Drudge and President Trump
[02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:31.860]  we get the 1984 treatment, the boot stomping on our face, the unpersoning but everybody
[02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:36.820]  else gets the football and the Prozac and the fluoride and the just brain damage and
[02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:40.180]  the cancer and you never know what hit you like a bus hit you like a two year old walking
[02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:44.900]  around in the traffic and a Mack truck's going 60 miles an hour and just you know never
[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:51.020]  knew what hit him, worst thing I ever saw was a couple kids throwing out of a car way
[02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:58.460]  down the beach when I was in college and you got to stop the render a let me tell you see
[02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:03.380]  a toddler smeared all over the highway it's not a good feeling but what I'm getting at
[02:04:03.380 --> 02:04:10.420]  is it's like a Mack truck you never knew what hit him and and that's the thing is when
[02:04:10.420 --> 02:04:13.940]  you get around globalists they already know all the stuff I know and they just go why
[02:04:13.940 --> 02:04:18.740]  don't you join us man what's your problem these people are idiots they'll tear you apart
[02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:22.580]  if you try to help them or build them up they don't want the knowledge join us you can maybe
[02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:26.940]  influence things for the better on the inside but that's not what it is the higher up you
[02:04:26.940 --> 02:04:32.100]  get these people if you ever get around some of these people they look like space sailing
[02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:37.140]  and Zuckerberg and people I've been around him around someone and they're all just like
[02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:43.460]  and it's all just and they're not real people and all they can do is hurt people that's
[02:04:43.460 --> 02:04:48.420]  all they do is fountains of evil fountains of wickedness fountains of fraud fountains
[02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:57.340]  of out of control dominance just social Darwinistic monsters of the it we knew it was coming the
[02:04:57.340 --> 02:05:02.980]  whole thing was for me leg first demonize info wars lie about us build a straw man then sue
[02:05:02.980 --> 02:05:08.060]  us to add credibility to that then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with

[02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:20.380]  murphy hillary clinton is still quarterbacking a lot of this a psycho witch that brags about
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:25.060]  these stabilizing countries and bringing down nations and i came i saw he died in half of
[02:07:25.060 --> 02:07:32.060]  africa collapsed but that's okay because she virtually signaled she likes black lives matter
[02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:38.860]  it's okay if she says uh blacks are super predators and he'd be brought to heal and it's okay if
[02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:43.740]  she used rebel flags when when when when when bill clinton ran for governor that's okay if
[02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:53.540]  she went to the funerals of kkk grand wizards because she's a democratic she's a lady she's
[02:07:53.540 --> 02:08:04.300]  a lady so that's where we stand now i almost started the broadcast with us today but i'm
[02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:12.220]  doing it as we get into the third hour here today that's because i woke up this morning
[02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:17.940]  and i just know i've studied history and i don't know how and i don't get into mysticism
[02:08:17.940 --> 02:08:23.140]  any of that i just instinctively know that there are things connected like if you read
[02:08:23.140 --> 02:08:27.300]  the history books there'd be a big war in china and they'd have a giant earthquake or
[02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:31.620]  or rome would be in a big battle and then a volcano would just suddenly erupt a hundred
[02:08:31.620 --> 02:08:36.340]  miles away it just seems things rhyme things kind of go you're been out in the middle of
[02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:40.580]  the country you're watching your dear hunter something there's a four-way stop of a highway
[02:08:40.580 --> 02:08:43.620]  maybe a quarter mile away you're looking through your rifle scope and you notice no cars come
[02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:47.500]  by for like 30 minutes but all of a sudden four cars come right at the same time and
[02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:51.860]  you wait about an hour and eat your sack lunch and you know sit back and get out your little
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:56.660]  uh you know get out your little hot toddy uh thermos a little bit of jack daniel's in the
[02:08:56.660 --> 02:09:03.060]  coffee and you're sitting there and four cars come at exactly the same time again and you're
[02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:10.020]  like that was twice that happens again while you're up in the deer stand so there's there's
[02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:17.540]  weird rhymes and as above so below in the world i woke up this morning because my son's bathroom
[02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:24.100]  was broken so he came in and woke me up in my shower in my bathroom god love him i don't know
[02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:28.740]  why he announced i'm taking a shower as he walks to the bedroom but okay i just gone to bed two
[02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:32.660]  hours before my complaining system going back to that moment and i've been having a dream about
[02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:39.300]  volcanoes and earthquakes and meteors hitting the earth and i just sat up in my chair and i went
[02:09:40.580 --> 02:09:44.420]  you know with all these world changes going on and all these wars and all this this tectonic
[02:09:44.420 --> 02:09:50.900]  stuff i i just wonder if history will align again the planets will align with all this you know
[02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:56.340]  literal planetary alignment going on and we're going to see some big earthquakes and i just said
[02:09:56.340 --> 02:10:00.340]  go on air alex it's like i thought they were going to blow up the world trade center and i
[02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:04.500]  described it all how they've been a lot and i just had a feeling and i had some dreams and
[02:10:04.500 --> 02:10:08.340]  i'm on record with that i don't get into this a lot but i i do have the you know what they call
[02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:12.420]  the touch i don't think both of the clan they have it are con artists and they can't control it
[02:10:12.420 --> 02:10:16.900]  no one can control it my experience in fact the way to control it is not to control it but
[02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:22.420]  i just felt like i should go on the air and tell you i think it's gonna be some big earthquakes
[02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:24.900]  and i think it's gonna be some big volcanoes and i think there's gonna be some big stuff
[02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:28.500]  kicking off in the next few months and i mean the biggest probably we've recorded
[02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:32.340]  since they've been recording this the last 200 years the seismographs so i'm not even looking
[02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:36.420]  for this news and i get in here and they've got hundreds of articles so i'm going through them
[02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:40.420]  looking at them reading parts of them highlighting stuff and i suddenly see headline after headline
[02:10:40.420 --> 02:10:44.820]  after headline after headline scientists say the big ones overdue scientists say it's imminent
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:50.500]  scientists say that that you know don't worry about the volcano at yellowstone the super volcano
[02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:57.940]  worry about a seven or higher earthquake and then at 69 major earthquakes hit the pacific ring of
[02:10:57.940 --> 02:11:03.540]  fire in just 48 hours driving fears that the big one is about to hit so i'm having dreams about
[02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:09.380]  earthquakes meanwhile they're going on and you're like yeah just like birds will fly a day before
[02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:14.020]  big earthquake hits or mice will run out of their holes and and people are like why are them i mean
[02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:18.180]  they learned in ancient times in europe and in china they wrote about it like if you see a mice and
[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:22.820]  stuff going up in trees and and you see you know animals coming out of their holes an earthquake
[02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:31.620]  is coming and and how do they know i don't know but it's this is documented stuff that goes on
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:36.660]  in the universe because there's an electrochemical internet that they prove in the sixth sense that
[02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:42.420]  it sells in a lot of creatures brains uh some humans have more than others that's what the lay
[02:11:42.420 --> 02:11:46.980]  lines are about stonehenge and all that it's been documented those are big big uh volcanic rock
[02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:52.420]  points were huge uh scientists have measured it at all those stone sites all over the world from
[02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:57.940]  china to again europe to latin america its its points were huge electromagnetic energy spewing
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:03.220]  out of the earth's core basically blasting out not just suns that are blasting out you know radiation
[02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:10.420]  and so mammals particularly but also birds especially migratory birds have uh cells in the
[02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:18.180]  brain that are uh part metal and they're actually able to pick up and that's how the birds better
[02:12:18.180 --> 02:12:24.580]  than an f-16 little bitty hunting birds can fly 3 000 miles you know from from the east coast all
[02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:30.100]  the way down to you know mexico or all the way down to central america and in some cases south america
[02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:38.260]  and the little birdies they have little uh metal deposits iron balls and bird brains yeah there it
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:43.540]  is that that that allowed them magnetically off the iron that's in the earth resonating with their
[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:49.780]  electrochemical gps and now they know the cell towers and stuff are actually blocking that
[02:12:49.780 --> 02:12:57.940]  and now they know whales don't just have sonar whales also have electrochemical uh deposits
[02:12:57.940 --> 02:13:02.580]  in their brains and in fact some of them maybe have a whole organ they didn't know why you'd go
[02:13:02.580 --> 02:13:06.820]  into well brains there's like actually pieces like you know metal nodes and it's actually
[02:13:07.540 --> 02:13:12.100]  like like wireless internet so and the globalists know all this and they're jamming it and they're
[02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:20.340]  doing all sorts of weird stuff so i just want to tell you that we are incredible and so is the other
[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:24.900]  life on this planet and we're amazing and the enemy is humans that know this and think they're a new
[02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:29.620]  species splitting away who don't want you to have access to what you really are and let me tell you
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:33.460]  i can look at hillary clinton or bill gates and i can tell you right now you are no god okay
[02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:41.860]  you are disreputable evil wicked control freaks who are so selfish that you will never
[02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:46.660]  go the promised land you your family's none of you you're from bad stock you're twisted you are
[02:13:46.660 --> 02:13:52.020]  cancer you are malfunctioning just because you can take over the planet as i said a thousand times
[02:13:52.020 --> 02:13:56.740]  and like cancer can take over a body it doesn't mean you're elite it means you are the failure
[02:13:56.740 --> 02:14:01.300]  you want us to fail because you're a failure you tell us we're obsolete and we're ugly and post-human
[02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:07.060]  world because you are and you want us to die and you talk about it and you try to bring us down to
[02:14:07.060 --> 02:14:13.700]  your level but it's not going to happen so here it is it's the big one about to hit california
[02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:19.860]  fears rise after swarm of 53 major earthquakes abc news scientists to tell impact a big one
[02:14:19.860 --> 02:14:26.260]  one they say is over 10 years over in southern california and if it hits
[02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:33.460]  you're talking crazy town yellowstone's greatest geological threat isn't super volcano it's a
[02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:39.140]  magnitude seven quake us a day and that's spot on you know i'd cover that that's super caldera
[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:42.580]  10 years ago they say i was a conspiracy theorist but i mean i was listening to what the geologist
[02:14:42.580 --> 02:14:49.060]  actually had said now they've told the geologist shut up so you think about that but out in the ocean
[02:14:50.260 --> 02:14:57.780]  we're having magnitude 8.9s and stuff so it's all happening california's big one to happen
[02:14:57.780 --> 02:15:04.980]  before we think and will be triggered by slow earthquake the scientist are reporting so i'm
[02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:09.700]  just telling you you know i i woke up this morning thinking about earthquakes and volcanoes and
[02:15:09.700 --> 02:15:17.940]  those i never do and uh and i mean there i think everybody senses this is the big change this is
[02:15:17.940 --> 02:15:24.260]  the big deal and you've got these soul reapers these soul suckers uh we are dealing with a
[02:15:24.260 --> 02:15:29.940]  literal spiritual vampire invasion folks these it's they're activating people everywhere
[02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:35.060]  they're acting like absolute monster animals because they are they're gone they are completely
[02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:41.140]  jacked they turned over their consciousness to whatever this you know stuff is that floats around
[02:15:41.140 --> 02:15:46.100]  in deep space and attaches itself to people and you know that's just that's just the way it is
[02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:49.460]  and i'm real sorry for him but it's good to know jesus hidden that it's good to not be a devil

[02:20:37.620 --> 02:20:41.780]  force feed that's politically correct says cuss words every three seconds her show is being
[02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:55.300]  canceled another one bites the dust the opposition a show that stole my identity then said horrible
[02:20:55.300 --> 02:21:06.580]  racist things i never said no ratings everybody hates you another one bites the dust see we're
[02:21:06.580 --> 02:21:12.260]  not the censor you because nobody wants to watch you nobody wants to listen to air america a bunch
[02:21:12.260 --> 02:21:21.220]  of virtue signaling people in everybody's face so there you go you got it locked the next to
[02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:28.420]  susan because you know his movies are number one but every one of your comics is failing it is the
[02:21:29.220 --> 02:21:35.300]  sarah silverman all of it can you imagine if i dressed up in a hitler outfit and then got up
[02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:41.060]  here and said that i was pro hillary they would say on the news that i was a nazi oh but all the
[02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:45.540]  liberals they charlie chaplin you know they could do what charlie chaplin did but if
[02:21:47.460 --> 02:21:55.540]  if account dankila does uh the hitler dog he gets arrested and is facing a year in prison
[02:21:55.540 --> 02:22:04.420]  in england and youtube deleted his videos and said it was hate speech of the pug
[02:22:05.940 --> 02:22:13.860]  hyling hitler but john please can do it sarah silverman can do it charlie chaplin can do it
[02:22:15.140 --> 02:22:20.740]  but you can't you see slaves see how that works because you're an american or you're a brit you're
[02:22:20.740 --> 02:22:26.020]  hitler even though most of you lost grandparents or great-grandparents in those wars no no no no no
[02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:34.420]  no no no no no that's not how it works ladies and gentlemen the nazi collaborator that helped
[02:22:34.420 --> 02:22:43.940]  round up jews he runs media matters and he says you're a nazi so you are because see george soros
[02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:50.420]  walks as a man all of you are there to drink fluoride and get brainwashed in the schools
[02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:57.780]  and eat gmo until you roll up double x's in your eyes because this earth belongs to him
[02:22:58.420 --> 02:23:00.340]  he's a man you're an animal
[02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:07.540]  he just didn't like hitler because hitler was trying to take over before he did
[02:23:08.420 --> 02:23:14.100]  soros wrote in books and articles in the 80s that he believes he is jesus christ
[02:23:15.860 --> 02:23:16.660]  the messiah
[02:23:16.660 --> 02:23:18.660]  uh
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:24.740]  think about that think about that long and hard and remember he thinks he's better than you
[02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:29.380]  his little demon son and all the rest of them think they're better than you and your family
[02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:33.300]  and when you take those vaccines you drink that fluoride you eat that gmo you listen to their
[02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:37.460]  propaganda you go to their mainline sports games all of it you give into them and you let them win
[02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:43.620]  but the nfl's ratings have dropped another 10 points that's half from four years ago and we're
[02:23:43.620 --> 02:23:49.700]  never coming back it'll be 20 percent of what it was in a couple more years because everyone's
[02:23:49.700 --> 02:23:54.420]  sick of spoiled rotten people making 20 million dollars a year telling them how much they hate
[02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:58.980]  america when all a lot of people's god has a little bit of pride in their country you sacks of garbage
[02:23:59.780 --> 02:24:03.460]  oh but you've got your free speech to take a knee when you're a paid employee
[02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:07.300]  it's like if i worked at a restaurant and i said you know i'm gonna piss on the carpet well you can
[02:24:07.300 --> 02:24:14.180]  piss on your own carpet you ain't pissing on our carpet old veterans people that lost family members
[02:24:14.180 --> 02:24:18.100]  all they've got is a little bit of belief in america and you want to piss all over it while you
[02:24:18.100 --> 02:24:24.260]  make 20 million dollars a year people are done the nfl's biting the dust seeing in already bit the
[02:24:24.260 --> 02:24:28.980]  dust new york times bit the dust wash and post bit the dust they're all failed they're all frauds
[02:24:28.980 --> 02:24:33.860]  they're all propped up by crooks the new york times the wash and post and others are calling
[02:24:33.860 --> 02:24:39.220]  everybody's uncle and like going who secretly funds jones who's the foundation who's the group is
[02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:45.780]  of the russians none of them are self-made they all go grovel and try to virtue signal college
[02:24:45.780 --> 02:24:52.420]  to get a place in the toilet bowl of of george soros hoping that when he defecates on them with
[02:24:52.420 --> 02:24:58.260]  propaganda that they get a little just a little crumb or something they're literally little feeder
[02:24:58.260 --> 02:25:04.100]  fish that follow around you know towards the towards the uh what they call the anal fin of the fish
[02:25:04.100 --> 02:25:08.260]  of the shark and they all just kind of swim right next to his butt i mean i'm sorry that's what they
[02:25:08.260 --> 02:25:13.780]  are and they just oh they're just waiting oh oh he's about to have a bowel movement oh let us
[02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:22.500]  get in there real quickly hey all ben garrison always knows the nfl jumped the shark i've been

[02:33:29.860 --> 02:33:41.860]  i'm in the middle
[02:33:51.140 --> 02:33:53.300]  i had plans when i was about five
[02:33:53.300 --> 02:33:57.300]  five
[02:33:57.300 --> 02:34:05.860]  the memories the race memories things from the past that are the things to come the shape of
[02:34:05.860 --> 02:34:15.940]  things to come all right let's get into the news here i want to go to your calls and then
[02:34:15.940 --> 02:34:20.100]  i want to get to this piece antifa assaults bernie sanders voter in portland
[02:34:20.100 --> 02:34:27.700]  for carrying a fascist american flag hit him and i have a bike lock which is a mace
[02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:36.020]  and remember they did that in san francisco they heard an attack on the police and just
[02:34:36.020 --> 02:34:41.060]  random people that's what they do just the unbelievable cowardice of these people
[02:34:41.060 --> 02:34:48.420]  and then just how stupid they are i mean you kill somebody with a bike lock
[02:34:52.180 --> 02:34:58.020]  to them it's all arping now compare them attacking their own people because i guess
[02:34:58.020 --> 02:35:02.340]  they saw one of the other larkers has grabbed a flag from somebody they're like piranhas to
[02:35:04.660 --> 02:35:09.780]  rufio panman with a guy trying to kill him with a deadly weapon he grabs it in swing
[02:35:09.780 --> 02:35:14.660]  controls the punch knocks the guy out a woman tries to virtue signal and push him to hope that
[02:35:14.660 --> 02:35:19.140]  he hits her and he controls it all in a split second now that's the difference between a
[02:35:19.140 --> 02:35:23.460]  conservative and a christian and a patriot and a little cowardly rat like globalist
[02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:29.540]  you can see not a coward standing up against deadly violence suppresses hitting the woman
[02:35:29.540 --> 02:35:37.700]  even though she strikes him and this is why they banned us as well we had live coverage of all
[02:35:37.700 --> 02:35:41.780]  this happening and they with millions of viewers despite shadow banning their shadow banning
[02:35:41.780 --> 02:35:45.460]  failed and they're like listen your shadow banning supposed to stop jones from getting millions of
[02:35:45.460 --> 02:35:50.820]  views but i was shroyer and the rest of them had millions of views that weekend with their live
[02:35:50.820 --> 02:35:56.660]  feeds and they and they we could see them shadow banning and they just didn't didn't work so they'd
[02:35:56.660 --> 02:36:01.220]  kill the feeds but other people got them so i i added it up i don't usually do that but they
[02:36:01.220 --> 02:36:07.620]  suppressed so much i did it and we had something like just on our feeds five million views despite
[02:36:07.620 --> 02:36:11.620]  shadow banning and then it was everywhere else and they're just like we're not allowing this
[02:36:12.260 --> 02:36:16.100]  we're not going to show people our children the antefa out beating up men women and children
[02:36:16.100 --> 02:36:20.180]  and getting their butts kicked we're just going to say jones is calling for violence and saying
[02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:27.860]  kill reporters which i'm not but you can lester holt ryan stelter the new york times the washington
[02:36:27.860 --> 02:36:35.380]  post they wouldn't be committing absolute criminal activity like that unless they were planning to
[02:36:35.380 --> 02:36:41.380]  go all the way in the next 77 days they are they're coming for everybody they're not going to stop and
[02:36:41.380 --> 02:36:45.060]  by the way they're going to lose this war whether we keep it peaceful which i'm trying to do or
[02:36:45.060 --> 02:36:48.980]  whether they start the offensive and you know people have to defend themselves they are all
[02:36:48.980 --> 02:36:56.260]  going to lose but if they start the civil war and and start getting really violent everybody
[02:36:56.260 --> 02:37:02.580]  we're going to have to really you know do it must be done so and we're just going to have to for
[02:37:02.580 --> 02:37:08.500]  our families and everybody else's future and everything that'd be very very firm i take no
[02:37:08.500 --> 02:37:14.180]  pleasure uh in the fact that we have to defend ourselves and i and i would take no pleasure
[02:37:14.180 --> 02:37:17.860]  you know if antefa tried to come to my house or someone else's house to attack him you had to
[02:37:17.860 --> 02:37:24.820]  defend yourself it's like stepping on a cockroach and i'm like oh man uh cockroach i don't want
[02:37:24.820 --> 02:37:29.700]  to have a bunch of exterminators here oh come here buddy i'm going to have to get a nap get
[02:37:29.700 --> 02:37:34.180]  him just crush your head as quickly as possible and get you in the trash can i mean i don't like
[02:37:34.180 --> 02:37:41.140]  killing cockroaches uh and the the the the media are a pack of liars i would never
[02:37:41.140 --> 02:37:45.380]  offensively attack anybody and they know it but they're putting all of that out there
[02:37:45.380 --> 02:37:48.900]  and and trying to get people to go out and attack and the new york times is advertising hey here's
[02:37:48.900 --> 02:37:53.940]  where they play baseball they know what they're doing and i'm just and they just think they're
[02:37:53.940 --> 02:37:59.060]  going to start this shooting war with the most armed population in the world it's insane
[02:37:59.060 --> 02:38:09.220]  just stop now i mean i i i i get a bullhorn like on my fbi hostage negotiator you are overwhelmed
[02:38:09.220 --> 02:38:13.540]  and surrounded you have committed major crimes it's going to go past if you come out with your
[02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:19.460]  hands up do not execute the hostages stop calling for violence we do not want to have to use
[02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:25.780]  overwhelming force in defense think about what you're doing you are emotional right now and scared
[02:38:25.780 --> 02:38:30.660]  and put up on adrenaline but things will go a lot better if you stop and release the hostages
[02:38:32.660 --> 02:38:38.340]  now i'm waiting by the phone line in here just let me know how the hostages are
[02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:46.740]  and we'll send in some food i mean that's really where we've gotten to here and i'm just like whoa
[02:38:46.740 --> 02:38:53.620]  man i mean media matters is in everyone's twitter facebook google accounts with all your private
[02:38:53.620 --> 02:38:59.780]  it's so totally illegal but soros is overthrown a bunch of countries he always gets away with it so
[02:38:59.780 --> 02:39:04.820]  he thinks he can i mean it's just like yes trump indict them but the justice department
[02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:10.260]  they were smart getting a coup in there and you know sessions has got his whole wife in his house
[02:39:10.260 --> 02:39:14.980]  in his mansion and he's he just they got dirt on him folks i don't know if it's you know him with
[02:39:14.980 --> 02:39:20.420]  little kids or in a kkk outfitter what it is but sessions really has turned out to be a real trojan
[02:39:20.420 --> 02:39:24.020]  horse piece of crap uh and uh
[02:39:26.420 --> 02:39:32.260]  he i mean it's just the crimes being committed are astounding so
[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:38.420]  i guess the soros and the chai comms can go off shore they don't care if there's a big
[02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:43.140]  blitz a little while they're trying to start one i let me just be a thousand percent clear
[02:39:45.620 --> 02:39:48.980]  i have security so i'm not sitting there sleeping with a battle rifle by my bed
[02:39:48.980 --> 02:39:53.780]  but the idea that twitter people say that it's violent to say that if you come to my house
[02:39:54.500 --> 02:39:58.980]  trying to hurt me or my family i'll defend myself the crime to the left the authoritarians is
[02:39:58.980 --> 02:40:03.460]  standing up to them and so they see that as offensively violent if you're asleep in your bed
[02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:10.180]  and five armed men come to kill you if you do not open your chest and present it and kneel
[02:40:10.180 --> 02:40:15.940]  and kiss the antifa boot you are a terrorist at a nazi if you roll over and squeal and beg and say
[02:40:15.940 --> 02:40:21.140]  you're a god you're the most powerful human on earth antifa has defeated me they go good and
[02:40:21.140 --> 02:40:26.900]  then shove the rifle in your mouth and pull the trigger and go ah and then jack dorsi or i
[02:40:26.900 --> 02:40:32.900]  guess twitter would say oh alex is a liberal he likes the death camps in china ah he likes tim

[02:44:00.180 --> 02:44:05.700]  found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to
[02:44:05.700 --> 02:44:12.900]  be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain
[02:44:12.900 --> 02:44:18.900]  could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[02:44:18.900 --> 02:44:25.300]  for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of
[02:44:25.300 --> 02:44:31.220]  heavy metals and acidity in the rain water next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity
[02:44:31.220 --> 02:44:37.700]  filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored
[02:44:37.700 --> 02:44:44.820]  to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the water so what
[02:44:44.820 --> 02:44:51.540]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly
[02:44:51.540 --> 02:44:58.260]  a good water filtration system will purify it the scientists at info wars life have created

[02:47:17.700 --> 02:47:24.900]  so the globalists want to sabotage america they want to bring in a total police state grid
[02:47:24.900 --> 02:47:29.700]  based in china here it's all over the news everything we told you years ago next year's news
[02:47:29.700 --> 02:47:35.700]  today info wars are going to your phone calls look you got two deceptive lying machines abc news
[02:47:35.700 --> 02:47:41.940]  and cnn cnn is usually far worse but abc news you know why is a lot too they had brian ross you
[02:47:41.940 --> 02:47:48.100]  know say that flin had flipped and when he was a russian agent and that and that uh
[02:47:49.380 --> 02:47:53.940]  you know trump was born in russia and was a kgb commander you know and fought hitler
[02:47:55.140 --> 02:48:02.340]  all total crap joy bayhart yay he just flipped all that's made up they're saying that michael cohen
[02:48:02.340 --> 02:48:07.460]  trumps one of his many lawyers one of his disgrace lawyers who've been caught lying you name it with
[02:48:07.460 --> 02:48:11.460]  his taxi company nothing to do with trump they've got him they claim on money laundering because
[02:48:11.460 --> 02:48:15.860]  his business partner didn't pay taxes probably nothing but the point is is cohen's been chomping
[02:48:15.860 --> 02:48:21.300]  at the bit now to actually record trump and then trump's like financing i'm not paying for anything
[02:48:21.300 --> 02:48:27.140]  so that you know the tape's actually exonerated but cnn is saying cohen to plead guilty to criminal
[02:48:27.140 --> 02:48:33.860]  charges and then he's not rolled so uh i don't know i mean when you get two disinformation
[02:48:33.860 --> 02:48:41.780]  organizations like cnn and abc together if they had a baby if they had a baby it would look something
[02:48:41.780 --> 02:48:47.620]  like brian stelter so that's an ugly baby uh a very deceptive little baby as well so we'll
[02:48:47.620 --> 02:48:53.380]  be looking at all that fox is reporting michael cohen striking a deal as well uh but but again uh
[02:48:53.380 --> 02:48:56.500]  yeah let's play joy bayhart and we'll go to your calls remember here here's uh here's here's joy

[02:49:01.860 --> 02:49:17.220]  directed him to make contact with the russians yay make up lies yay wow
[02:49:19.460 --> 02:49:24.980]  whoa okay let's stop there okay let's go to your phone calls carlos and montreal canada
[02:49:24.980 --> 02:49:30.020]  you're on the air worldwide thanks for holding thank you very much alec sir be strong
[02:49:30.020 --> 02:49:37.460]  huh general cornwall is surrendered to washington and ever since that day the what we now know as
[02:49:37.460 --> 02:49:43.780]  the international has been out to destroy the united states and the way that they want to destroy
[02:49:43.780 --> 02:49:50.020]  the united states is to convince the individual against the better judgment of the founding fathers
[02:49:50.020 --> 02:49:57.380]  that the individual is is a majority and a minority of one that the individual you me and everyone
[02:49:57.380 --> 02:50:03.620]  else in america has a right to be free to be to vote their conscience and that is what they're
[02:50:03.620 --> 02:50:09.220]  trying to steal from the youth from those that now support the interfaith they're trying to beat
[02:50:09.220 --> 02:50:16.020]  everyone into group think exactly that's right to take away the individual's concept that you have
[02:50:16.020 --> 02:50:22.500]  so strongly of being a sovereign on your own to be willing to stand and fight and to put your
[02:50:22.500 --> 02:50:28.340]  handcock signature on a piece of paper that tells everybody we must be sovereign individually
[02:50:28.340 --> 02:50:36.500]  not george the third not some kingdom not some secret society but the individual must be sovereign
[02:50:36.500 --> 02:50:41.780]  and you're right that's the fight we're in that's what globalism versus individualism is correct
[02:50:41.780 --> 02:50:46.260]  and they call themselves the international throughout history you can find them in europe
[02:50:46.260 --> 02:50:51.780]  all europe the international of which mr soros of course the big member and these people have
[02:50:51.780 --> 02:50:58.980]  had over time since 1913 as a matter of fact when they were successful in passing uh and to
[02:50:58.980 --> 02:51:05.380]  self finance their project through the federal reserve what they had they had an agenda then
[02:51:05.380 --> 02:51:10.500]  they needed to finance it because you see as in you would have in the game of thrones today
[02:51:11.140 --> 02:51:17.780]  one side being financed by you know by the bankers against each other uh that was very wasteful of
[02:51:17.780 --> 02:51:21.860]  property and money because one had to win but the other one had to lose in the meantime they had to
[02:51:21.860 --> 02:51:27.460]  collect but then they suggested why don't we just do it the other way why don't we print money out
[02:51:27.460 --> 02:51:33.380]  of thin air and collect on that money taxes and principal and then use that money that we get from
[02:51:33.380 --> 02:51:39.220]  taxes to buy the companies from which the americans will be working to pay taxes to pay the debts that
[02:51:39.220 --> 02:51:45.700]  we print out of thin air that that's a fantastic mechanism so once they had the the means to finance
[02:51:45.700 --> 02:51:51.460]  it now they have to execute it and when it comes to executing the death of america sovereignty
[02:51:51.460 --> 02:51:55.620]  that's when they have to go to the media and the media of course cannot tell you the truth
[02:51:55.620 --> 02:52:01.700]  they have to tell you crappola the crappola news network cnn or any other revisions well i agree
[02:52:01.700 --> 02:52:05.700]  i mean they're beyond just lying now these are weaponized criminal groups now actually
[02:52:05.700 --> 02:52:10.660]  engaging in stalking racketeering i mean that they get in all your private accounts criminally
[02:52:10.660 --> 02:52:17.540]  i mean they are agents now uh in our lives literally and now facebook once you're banking
[02:52:17.540 --> 02:52:23.220]  now that way uh the george soros and uh and of course david brock could get in your bank account
[02:52:23.220 --> 02:52:30.100]  itself that's right and that's the international that's the fingers the octopus that the international
[02:52:30.100 --> 02:52:34.340]  mr chirchell wrote about them by the way exactly and that chirchell wrote and that's uh
[02:52:34.340 --> 02:52:44.580]  uh mi6 osse and flaming that's specter specter is the is the global uh crime cartel and you notice
[02:52:44.580 --> 02:52:48.980]  in those books he wrote that like letter got made from russia with love and stuff it wasn't the russians
[02:52:48.980 --> 02:52:52.580]  we were even fighting it was international crime senate get trying to make the united states and
[02:52:52.580 --> 02:52:58.420]  russia go to war and it's exactly what it is today it's incredible isn't it it is as a matter of fact
[02:52:58.420 --> 02:53:04.260]  a little anecdote i had the pleasure of meeting miss money penny from from the in flaming novels out
[02:53:04.260 --> 02:53:10.500]  in uh in london she was the wife of um lord rittstale as a matter of fact secretary to uh
[02:53:10.500 --> 02:53:16.580]  the flaming so it's it's a very interesting um eternal of events to see now the international
[02:53:16.580 --> 02:53:23.220]  coming in but to all of you listening in tefalas and haters of info wars it's your individual
[02:53:23.220 --> 02:53:28.980]  sovereignty the right to be able to vote that is trying to be taken from you that's what you
[02:53:28.980 --> 02:53:33.300]  have to fight for the moment that goes america's finished all the rest would just be the corpse
[02:53:33.300 --> 02:53:38.660]  walking i agree god bless you carlos what a smart caller uh he's been calling for years i love it
[02:53:38.660 --> 02:53:44.980]  when he gets in the line if they get this social credit score going we're really screwed and and
[02:53:44.980 --> 02:53:48.420]  they just did it to me they're they're they're doing it all these other conservatives and
[02:53:48.420 --> 02:53:52.660]  christians libertarians they're saying you can't have credit cards you can't bank you can't you
[02:53:52.660 --> 02:53:58.500]  can't be online you can't this is the unpersoning i mean this is it ladies and gentlemen this isn't
[02:53:58.500 --> 02:54:04.900]  a cakewalk it's not a drill it's not it's here and trump is fighting him as hard as he can he's
[02:54:04.900 --> 02:54:11.300]  just surrounded by cowards surrounded by people that are hedging their bets man you don't hedge
[02:54:11.300 --> 02:54:18.100]  your bet with evil you all in or it wins there's no hedging your bets with evil there's no
[02:54:18.100 --> 02:54:26.340]  no paying off tyrants and this country was founded by people that had come out of major
[02:54:26.340 --> 02:54:31.060]  revolutions in england the scots and others and people that were leaving germany had been slaves
[02:54:31.060 --> 02:54:34.500]  and wanted freedom and that's why they were hard to push around i mean they were perfect i mean
[02:54:34.500 --> 02:54:39.940]  they didn't recreate bad stuff they lived under but that's the american ethos is people that were
[02:54:39.940 --> 02:54:44.980]  for hundreds of years out of the british empire were trying to get away from it and that's exactly
[02:54:44.980 --> 02:54:50.260]  what the caller was just saying great job carlos okay uh this caller says that comments are being
[02:54:50.260 --> 02:54:54.900]  censored let's know you're probably talking about info wars dot com we have this thing called uh
[02:54:56.580 --> 02:55:00.900]  vocal or whatever because they go and won't let us get any big commenting platform it's also the

[02:55:15.700 --> 02:55:20.420]  are discriminating against us and they have a good system but uh it's just unbelievable i mean
[02:55:20.420 --> 02:55:24.100]  we've been that blacklist they're trying to shut the site down right now info wars was down last

[03:04:55.540 --> 03:05:01.780]  thing was for me leg first demonize info wars lie about us build a straw man then sue us to add
[03:05:01.780 --> 03:05:07.220]  credibility to that then have a few fake strikes on youtube and facebook with nebulous terms like
[03:05:07.220 --> 03:05:14.580]  bullying children and islamophobia and then voila two weeks later ban info wars completely off of

[03:06:06.660 --> 03:06:26.260]  you live from the front lines of the info war well the battle's joined incredible news is broken if
[03:06:26.260 --> 03:06:33.140]  you just tuned in and i'm not talking about michael cohen's reportedly corrupt taxi cab business
[03:06:33.140 --> 03:06:40.180]  that doesn't get it with the president i'm talking about facebook admittedly having a chinese communist
[03:06:40.180 --> 03:06:45.700]  social score system where they track every facet of your life everything you do and charge you
[03:06:45.700 --> 03:06:51.700]  different prices and and and you name it total discrimination and thank god trumps moving with
[03:06:51.700 --> 03:06:57.780]  the real anti-discrimination suit this is so unamerican but the big news is google facebook twitter
[03:06:57.780 --> 03:07:05.940]  what they're google apple um and others not not not so much twitter and i'm not saying that because
[03:07:05.940 --> 03:07:10.020]  twitter is doing stuff in china basically not the twitter isn't censoring doing bad things just
[03:07:10.020 --> 03:07:16.980]  want to remove them that because i misspoke but apple google uh facebook they're all going into
[03:07:16.980 --> 03:07:20.820]  china they're all helping censor and they're already doing it here all the things they're doing in
[03:07:20.820 --> 03:07:27.460]  china they're already here they have unpersoned me they have sent me to the phantom zone and now
[03:07:27.460 --> 03:07:32.580]  they're going after our bank accounts now they're going after the payment processors they're now
[03:07:32.580 --> 03:07:39.540]  going after the software you heard that gab dot ai microsoft found out that the software they paid
[03:07:39.540 --> 03:07:45.460]  for and use is running it so they're saying no you can't use that even though you paid for the
[03:07:45.460 --> 03:07:51.220]  software and the license says you can we want gab shut down because americans can't meet in a place
[03:07:51.220 --> 03:07:58.260]  and talk and a lot of people go gee alex you need to go ahead and roll over that's what followers do
[03:07:58.260 --> 03:08:06.740]  that's how you become north korea so let's go to paul watch it and tell us what he's got coming up
[03:08:06.740 --> 03:08:13.380]  you know paul to me it's just fantastical the president's tweeting in support of info wars
[03:08:13.380 --> 03:08:17.380]  he's saying it won't be tolerated the citizenship of conservatives and others it's clearly racketeering
[03:08:17.380 --> 03:08:22.260]  it's not the private company talk they selectively enforce they boost democrat posts they block
[03:08:22.260 --> 03:08:27.780]  conservative posts it's clear election meddling well they try to distract us with russia gate
[03:08:28.420 --> 03:08:32.500]  and we've now reached this epic moment where you wrote four plus years ago
[03:08:34.260 --> 03:08:40.100]  and info wars dot com first about the chinese social score and that was a mark of the beast
[03:08:40.100 --> 03:08:45.220]  and that would be used and now we learn it's already here just as we knew top of drudgerport.com
[03:08:45.220 --> 03:08:51.540]  this is just getting insane paul i mean this is quite a time to be alive what point in history
[03:08:51.540 --> 03:08:56.660]  do you think we are a and b why do you think they're so bold what were tech giants thinking
[03:08:58.020 --> 03:09:06.100]  two weeks ago when they deleted us on august 6 from planet earth i mean what were from 95
[03:09:06.100 --> 03:09:11.140]  percent of the internet what were they thinking because i'm not bragging when i say this
[03:09:11.140 --> 03:09:18.500]  i always tell people recognize me on the street and most of it's positive but i went to the mall
[03:09:19.780 --> 03:09:24.580]  and i went to california pizza kitchen and literally it was full of liberals and full of
[03:09:24.580 --> 03:09:28.980]  you know gay folks you name it they were all coming over we're listeners saying we see through it we
[03:09:28.980 --> 03:09:34.020]  know it's lies i went to lulu lemon my daughters wanted back to school clothes and i was mod by
[03:09:34.020 --> 03:09:37.780]  everyone that worked there and everyone in the shop and they were telling me about shows from a few
[03:09:37.780 --> 03:09:42.980]  days ago and you and everything else and then i went to another store and i was mobbed by half the
[03:09:42.980 --> 03:09:48.020]  people and i couldn't walk 10 feet blacks hispanics old young people that couldn't even hardly speak
[03:09:48.020 --> 03:09:52.420]  english alec shows we love you we know we know you're good we know it's true we know that you
[03:09:52.420 --> 03:09:58.500]  we know the man's coming after you i mean and i cops and security guards and just hispanics and
[03:09:58.500 --> 03:10:02.820]  i mean paul they've done something with thousands of articles a day and all these things lying
[03:10:02.820 --> 03:10:08.180]  everybody knows they're liars and so all it did was make everybody come to us but i'm telling you
[03:10:08.180 --> 03:10:13.300]  and i'm not saying this that confident the globalists knew they had to shut us down i guess a chain
[03:10:13.300 --> 03:10:20.100]  reaction happened thanks to drudgereport.com but i mean literally almost everyone was a listener now
[03:10:20.100 --> 03:10:24.580]  and it was like we're in the inner circle it's like fight club hey we all know we're not hey i'm a
[03:10:24.580 --> 03:10:27.940]  liberal hey i'm gay but i know what they're doing to use wrong and i know they're lying about you
[03:10:27.940 --> 03:10:32.420]  alec i heard you say that they're coming to get you at your house or other people you didn't say
[03:10:32.420 --> 03:10:36.100]  you were going to hurt the media i think they're going to false flag alec are they going to you
[03:10:36.100 --> 03:10:41.380]  know trump's a great guy he's a great guy you know i mean it's like i think they've completely
[03:10:41.380 --> 03:10:45.780]  imploded paul i want to predict a massive red wave unless there's election fraud what do you
[03:10:45.780 --> 03:10:50.820]  think's happened well it's like we always say if you're getting attacked by them they've got such
[03:10:50.820 --> 03:10:55.940]  low credibility and trust ratings then it shows you having a positive effect the point about this
[03:10:55.940 --> 03:11:00.260]  social credit score which as he said we wrote about three years ago in the article that you've
[03:11:00.260 --> 03:11:05.860]  just flagged up is probably even longer ago than that they want to destroy people's lives now i've
[03:11:05.860 --> 03:11:10.740]  gone through how this social credit score which by the way is not even fully in place in china it's
[03:11:10.740 --> 03:11:17.220]  going to be in place by 2020 is actually destroying people's lives we've talked about you being delisted
[03:11:17.220 --> 03:11:22.820]  from linkedin which you can't even upload any content to now we're seeing people for example
[03:11:23.620 --> 03:11:28.740]  getting their accounts shut down for air b and b we've seen people get their bank accounts shut
[03:11:28.740 --> 03:11:35.060]  down bank accounts refused the g had watched guy robert spencer getting his patreon pulled
[03:11:35.060 --> 03:11:40.340]  that's how it's having an effect in china they've got a system whereby if you have a good social
[03:11:40.340 --> 03:11:45.460]  credit score if you a good little automaton a good little sheep you don't criticize the government
[03:11:45.460 --> 03:11:51.380]  which in america is basically now don't criticize silicon valley it was funny how i made that san
[03:11:51.380 --> 03:11:57.380]  francisco is an s-hole video like two weeks before they removed the offer of anything so it's it's
[03:11:57.380 --> 03:12:03.460]  in a similar vein but it's now don't criticize big tech tech or your life will be ruined so in china
[03:12:03.460 --> 03:12:08.500]  they've got it down to a level and this is already happening now whereby the people with a good social
[03:12:08.500 --> 03:12:15.780]  credit score get higher ranking on the dating websites for example they get access to better
[03:12:15.780 --> 03:12:21.380]  women so they've got it down to that level they've got it down to people being refused loans people
[03:12:21.380 --> 03:12:28.820]  being refused credit people not being able to buy airline tickets because they've got a bad social
[03:12:28.820 --> 03:12:33.860]  credit score because they said something mean on the internet you know you can parlay that today
[03:12:33.860 --> 03:12:40.660]  with the usa today writer saying should trump be banned from twitter because he was mean to cnn so
[03:12:40.660 --> 03:12:45.140]  they've expanded that definition of targeted harassment to the point where it now basically
[03:12:45.140 --> 03:12:50.100]  means oh you said something a little bit naughty about brian stelter's appearance that's targeted
[03:12:50.100 --> 03:12:54.340]  harassment get off the internet that's right they're public figures that want us silenced and
[03:12:54.340 --> 03:12:59.540]  bankrupted and literally put in gulags but if you criticize them they're the new super class
[03:12:59.540 --> 03:13:04.420]  and then now you've got the reports coming out where media matters fun about soros has access
[03:13:04.420 --> 03:13:09.700]  to all of our accounts it is spying on us like cnn knew all our sponsors on youtube and was blocking
[03:13:09.700 --> 03:13:14.820]  them this is a criminal mafia but we all think from hollywood that only italians can do that
[03:13:15.700 --> 03:13:19.540]  and so somehow we're blind to this trump's starting to act paul and i bragged about
[03:13:19.540 --> 03:13:24.900]  everybody being awake at the at the mall i'm saying it's backfiring spectacularly but they
[03:13:24.900 --> 03:13:29.300]  don't care so how do you then i'll let you go and take over how do you expect this immovable
[03:13:29.300 --> 03:13:34.340]  object unstoppable force of liberty versus tyranny how is this going to collide because
[03:13:34.340 --> 03:13:38.660]  they're just going ahead with this and they're acting very very confident and let me tell you
[03:13:38.660 --> 03:13:44.180]  on the street things aren't confident well i mean someone made the point to me today and this is
[03:13:44.180 --> 03:13:48.740]  obviously not going to happen at that level but if enough people do it it will happen imagine if
[03:13:48.740 --> 03:13:54.420]  trump suddenly one day just said right i'm shutting down my twitter account i'm moving over to mines.com
[03:13:54.420 --> 03:13:59.940]  for example then the media would all be forced to move over to mines.com trump's haters would be
[03:13:59.940 --> 03:14:05.220]  forced to move over to mines.com to respond to his posts his supporters would as well obviously
[03:14:05.220 --> 03:14:08.820]  so obviously trump's not going to do it he's the president but if you get enough prominent people
[03:14:08.820 --> 03:14:14.340]  banned they move over to these old tech platforms they will grow and in fact i've been looking at
[03:14:14.340 --> 03:14:19.620]  your real video stats the video platform that we moved over to a couple of weeks ago yeah and a
[03:14:19.620 --> 03:14:24.100]  lot of good views on these videos already to say we've only been there for less than two weeks
[03:14:24.100 --> 03:14:28.820]  and that's a really smooth platform it runs real really well so the more people they ban the more
[03:14:28.820 --> 03:14:32.980]  these old tech websites are going to grow and that's going to help us obviously we're going to stay
[03:14:32.980 --> 03:14:38.980]  on the battlefield for as long as possible but the more they break their own systems the more
[03:14:38.980 --> 03:14:44.260]  google breaks its own search engine the more alternatives are going to pop up but then you have
[03:14:44.260 --> 03:14:49.460]  people on fox news like stoss stossel is it who you know he's been good on the past with some stuff
[03:14:49.460 --> 03:14:54.740]  he's a libertarian john stossel he he went on and he said well i don't care if youtube can censor
[03:14:54.740 --> 03:14:59.540]  people if they like it's a private company this is not about censorship as you just said this is
[03:14:59.540 --> 03:15:04.020]  about brigading this is about media matters and these sorrows this is about people with burning
[03:15:04.020 --> 03:15:09.300]  torches saying we can't have bank accounts and we can't exist false flagging us to take us down yeah
[03:15:10.100 --> 03:15:14.180]  yeah it's organized lobbying so when they say we're just enforcing our terms of service no
[03:15:14.180 --> 03:15:19.940]  you're abusing your terms of service because you're falling prey to lobbyists to witch hunts on
[03:15:19.940 --> 03:15:24.900]  twitter to witch hunts orchestrated by media matters which is an abuse of their terms of
[03:15:24.900 --> 03:15:28.500]  service you're gonna take over paul uh but but but let me just make this point
[03:15:29.220 --> 03:15:32.580]  trump can have his cake and eat it too and i'm gonna actually next time i'm gonna get info him
[03:15:32.580 --> 03:15:37.700]  the next day or two i'm actually gonna advise the president but give me a list paul who you think
[03:15:37.700 --> 03:15:42.660]  that he should set up subsidiary accounts and just start doing some there to show them his power
[03:15:43.380 --> 03:15:48.100]  so i i think he could have the cake and eat it too stay on twitter and stay on but start moving
[03:15:48.100 --> 03:15:53.860]  over to other platforms just to show them we'll be right back with paul joseph Watson hi i'm dan

[03:19:53.540 --> 03:19:59.060]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:10.660 --> 03:20:20.420]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show and now your host paul joseph
[03:20:20.420 --> 03:20:25.940]  watson are you like me now we're live this fourth hour of the alex jones show we're still talking
[03:20:25.940 --> 03:20:31.220]  about facebook and basically their admission or the revelation that they're imposing a chinese style
[03:20:31.220 --> 03:20:36.820]  social credit score onto their platform and the article out of the sun which we probably flashed
[03:20:36.820 --> 03:20:42.500]  up earlier facebook has trust ratings for users but won't tell you your score now the other issue
[03:20:42.500 --> 03:20:48.740]  of this which most people haven't touched upon is the tyranny of the fact checkers and in this
[03:20:48.740 --> 03:20:54.100]  article facebook puts out this kind of denial and this is their explanation the article reads
[03:20:54.980 --> 03:20:59.780]  facebook developed a process that protects people against indiscriminately flagging news as fake
[03:20:59.780 --> 03:21:05.700]  attempting to game the system one of the indicators used in this process is how people report articles
[03:21:05.700 --> 03:21:11.540]  as false for instance if somebody previously gave facebook feedback that an article was false
[03:21:11.540 --> 03:21:16.180]  and then the article was confirmed false by a fact checker that person's future feedback would be
[03:21:16.180 --> 03:21:23.220]  weighted more positively if the fact checkers now that flip that over for a second so if they report
[03:21:23.220 --> 03:21:29.460]  an article as fake news as false then it turns out after it's if it was fact checked that the
[03:21:29.460 --> 03:21:35.940]  article was in fact true then they lose the score they lose their trust their influence is demoted
[03:21:35.940 --> 03:21:42.660]  within facebook now that would be all well and good if the fact checkers were impartial and neutral
[03:21:42.660 --> 03:21:50.020]  and nonpartisan guess what they're not which fact checkers does facebook news to facebook use to
[03:21:50.020 --> 03:21:57.940]  fact check its articles its posts on facebook well their abc news the associate to press fact
[03:21:57.940 --> 03:22:07.140]  check org politic fact and wait for it snopes snopes.com all of those outlets have a leftist
[03:22:07.140 --> 03:22:12.980]  bias in the case of snopes it is far left this means of course they'll overwhelmingly flag
[03:22:12.980 --> 03:22:18.980]  right of center content as fake news and not the reverse so when they say oh we're just instituting
[03:22:18.980 --> 03:22:24.740]  a system where people can't get brigaded where people can't flag articles as fake just because
[03:22:24.740 --> 03:22:29.620]  they disagree with the politics that would work if the fact checkers were impartial they're not
[03:22:29.620 --> 03:22:34.500]  impartial so of course the fact checkers are going to abuse their power of course the fact
[03:22:34.500 --> 03:22:40.900]  checkers are going to come down harder on non leftist news sources so that the fact that they've
[03:22:40.900 --> 03:22:47.220]  done this will only help the far left even more because their trust their facebook trust is not
[03:22:47.220 --> 03:22:52.900]  going to get downgraded because the vast majority of articles they flag will indeed be backed up
[03:22:52.900 --> 03:23:00.340]  be flagged as fake news by the fact checkers that is the question who fact checks the fact
[03:23:00.340 --> 03:23:04.660]  checkers because there was an article which was posted on facebook a few months ago this is a
[03:23:04.660 --> 03:23:11.860]  headline out of pj media facebook threatened satire site babel on b over cnn story that
[03:23:11.860 --> 03:23:17.860]  snopes rated false so this satirical website which is upfront about the fact that it's satirical
[03:23:17.860 --> 03:23:24.500]  posted a headline the headline was cnn purchases industrial sized washing machine to spin news
[03:23:24.500 --> 03:23:32.580]  before publication it was obviously a satirical news story what happened it got flagged up on
[03:23:32.580 --> 03:23:39.220]  facebook as containing information that was false that was fake news so then snopes.com
[03:23:39.220 --> 03:23:44.180]  flagged it up they fact checked it and it came back that it was fake news and i believe for a
[03:23:44.180 --> 03:23:49.300]  short amount of time it was removed so that's an example they will flag an obviously satirical
[03:23:49.300 --> 03:23:55.220]  article as fake news even though it's clearly satire and then obviously the person the person
[03:23:55.220 --> 03:24:02.420]  that published that article will lose trust will lose their much wanted credit score on facebook
[03:24:02.420 --> 03:24:07.140]  who fact checks the fact checkers they are not neutral they are far left they are partisan
[03:24:07.140 --> 03:24:13.540]  let's give some more examples of snopes this is from info wars dot com snopes debunks itself on
[03:24:13.540 --> 03:24:19.940]  opres white people quote just have to die controversy so you may remember this video circulated again
[03:24:19.940 --> 03:24:24.900]  it was originally from 2013 it circulated again back in january when they were talking about
[03:24:25.940 --> 03:24:31.140]  potentially opera running for president she basically gives a bbc interview where she says
[03:24:31.140 --> 03:24:38.340]  that generations of racists to solve racism quote just have to die now she didn't specifically say
[03:24:38.340 --> 03:24:44.660]  white people but it was clear from the context that she was talking about old white americans
[03:24:44.660 --> 03:24:49.060]  she could have been talking about nobody else she literally said the solution to racism
[03:24:49.860 --> 03:24:56.180]  and that racism will continue until this generation of racists this generation of old racists in
[03:24:56.180 --> 03:25:02.580]  america dies so then we put out a headline you know um oprah winfrey says old white people
[03:25:02.580 --> 03:25:08.500]  need to die to solve racism that's clearly who she was talking about snopes dot com runs a fact
[03:25:08.500 --> 03:25:14.900]  check on it and says oh just because she didn't say white people that means she didn't mean old
[03:25:14.900 --> 03:25:21.540]  white people even though from the context it clearly was old white people who she was referring to
[03:25:21.540 --> 03:25:27.140]  so they play these little lexicon tricks to declare an article false when it's clearly true
[03:25:27.140 --> 03:25:33.620]  but because she didn't use the term white the word why they label it fake news it gets in some
[03:25:33.620 --> 03:25:39.380]  cases deleted off of facebook and in four wars dot com or whoever posted it not us anymore because
[03:25:39.380 --> 03:25:46.580]  we're banned then our trust our credit rating gets downgraded and even in this example snopes
[03:25:46.580 --> 03:25:52.500]  dot com at the end of this debunking piece which said it was fake news admitted that yes she meant
[03:25:52.500 --> 03:25:57.380]  old white people so even at the end of their own article they admitted yes obviously she meant old
[03:25:57.380 --> 03:26:02.980]  white people but because she didn't specifically say the word white that means it's fake news that's
[03:26:02.980 --> 03:26:09.940]  an example of the tricks they play to label right of center websites fake news when they're not fake
[03:26:09.940 --> 03:26:16.420]  news here's another example again we wrote about this on january 2nd snopes debunked on claim new
[03:26:16.420 --> 03:26:21.140]  york times didn't collude with hillary clinton snopes the left-wing website that supposedly
[03:26:21.140 --> 03:26:26.820]  debunks fake news facebook hires them to do so has itself been debunked after new wikileaks emails
[03:26:26.820 --> 03:26:31.620]  revealed that the new york times colluded with hillary clinton when she was secretary of state
[03:26:31.620 --> 03:26:36.180]  so again they put out an article so then there's no evidence of hillary colluding with the new
[03:26:36.180 --> 03:26:41.940]  york times wikileaks emails proved otherwise but again they've already declared it to be fake news
[03:26:41.940 --> 03:26:47.460]  so it goes down the memory hole here's another example of how snopes is a far left partisan
[03:26:47.460 --> 03:26:54.980]  bias website from the daily caller headline and this is from 2017 snopes caught playing defense
[03:26:54.980 --> 03:27:00.340]  for democrats who sat during navy seal tribute myth busting website snopes got caught pushing a
[03:27:00.340 --> 03:27:05.300]  misleading fact check that offered cover for democratic reps ellison and wassum and schultz
[03:27:05.300 --> 03:27:10.260]  who remained seated during the second standing ovation for karen owens the widow of deceased
[03:27:10.260 --> 03:27:15.540]  navy seal ryan owens so again you remember that conservatives it was during the state of the union
[03:27:15.540 --> 03:27:20.660]  said why are they not standing they weren't standing snopes put out an article basically
[03:27:20.660 --> 03:27:26.660]  misleading people because they did stand on another occasion when these when these individuals got
[03:27:26.660 --> 03:27:31.220]  standing ovation but the one that conservatives were referring to and had the video to prove it
[03:27:31.220 --> 03:27:36.740]  was a previous occasion when they didn't stand when the rest of the house did stand so they
[03:27:36.740 --> 03:27:41.460]  took a second occasion which was not related to the claim relating to the first and said because
[03:27:41.460 --> 03:27:47.700]  they did stand and give these people an ovation on that second occasion then the entire story
[03:27:47.700 --> 03:27:53.300]  is fake news you see how they weasel their way out their way out of it again to declare entire

[03:34:54.660 --> 03:34:59.700]  credit score system before we move on to other news basically we discussed it with alex earlier
[03:34:59.700 --> 03:35:05.860]  they terminated him from linkedin which you don't even upload content to linkedin okay if that happens
[03:35:05.860 --> 03:35:10.180]  to someone because of their political beliefs that's going to prevent them from getting a job
[03:35:10.180 --> 03:35:16.500]  in the future this is about sabotaging people's lives i mentioned as well jack montgomery who is
[03:35:16.500 --> 03:35:21.620]  a writer for bright bar which again is targeted by these brigade witch hunt people on twitter
[03:35:22.420 --> 03:35:28.100]  the sleeping giant and all these other organizations his air bnb account was terminated
[03:35:28.100 --> 03:35:33.860]  they gave him no reason whatsoever we've seen it before where bookings on air bnb where accounts
[03:35:33.860 --> 03:35:39.700]  um related to air bnb get terminated because of people's political beliefs this is the social
[03:35:39.700 --> 03:35:47.300]  credit score in action in america in western countries today now i read a wired news article
[03:35:47.300 --> 03:35:53.780]  earlier which explained how china's social credit score is already going into effect again it was
[03:35:53.780 --> 03:35:58.980]  it was begun back in 2015 it's basically into a great extent not going to be finalized and
[03:35:58.980 --> 03:36:06.020]  centralized until 2020 but the headline on wired news is the odd reality of life under china's all
[03:36:06.020 --> 03:36:12.820]  seeing credit score system and it describes a futuristic dystopian nightmare which is already
[03:36:12.820 --> 03:36:18.180]  a reality in china and it's coming fast to america don't worry about that if facebook gets their way
[03:36:18.180 --> 03:36:24.020]  the article says social credit is preventing people from buying airline and train tickets
[03:36:24.020 --> 03:36:29.860]  stopping social gatherings from happening and blocking people from going on certain dating
[03:36:29.860 --> 03:36:36.260]  websites meanwhile those viewed kindly are rewarded with discounted energy bills and similar perks
[03:36:36.260 --> 03:36:41.060]  now you'll notice that one of the great features of facebook when you get blocked on facebook
[03:36:41.060 --> 03:36:47.380]  as i was blocked on facebook a couple of weeks ago for 24 hours they stop you from using the
[03:36:47.380 --> 03:36:52.500]  messenger system it's not just the fact that you can't post they stop you from using the
[03:36:52.500 --> 03:36:58.740]  messenger system a lot of people communicate with their friends and family on things like instagram
[03:36:58.740 --> 03:37:04.180]  on facebook messenger i mean at least with twitter if you get if you get suspended on twitter you
[03:37:04.180 --> 03:37:08.500]  can still talk to people you can still talk to your friends and family behind the scenes on the
[03:37:08.500 --> 03:37:14.180]  messenger system facebook you're blocked you can't even communicate with people so it's interesting
[03:37:14.180 --> 03:37:20.740]  you know they had this big virtue signal uh facebook a couple years ago i think they instituted it
[03:37:20.740 --> 03:37:25.140]  whereby if there was a terror attack or any other kind of emergency incident in a certain
[03:37:25.140 --> 03:37:29.860]  geographic location they would send out an alert and you were able to go on there and
[03:37:29.860 --> 03:37:34.580]  mark that you were safe now you wouldn't be able to do that if you were suspended or blocked would
[03:37:34.580 --> 03:37:39.540]  you and you're not able to even communicate with your friends and family if you're suspended on
[03:37:39.540 --> 03:37:45.220]  facebook that is the essence of the commie style social credit score system where they prevent
[03:37:45.220 --> 03:37:50.980]  you from organizing they prevent you from accessing things like dating websites or buying airline and
[03:37:50.980 --> 03:37:56.660]  train tickets because you've been a naughty boy or girl this is the essence of the tyranny we're
[03:37:56.660 --> 03:38:04.260]  dealing with given how much power these big tech corporations have amalgamated under their monopoly
[03:38:04.260 --> 03:38:09.460]  this is why the monopoly needs to be broken up so it gives further examples this wired news
[03:38:09.460 --> 03:38:14.820]  article one independent journalist has already been barred from buying plane tickets because of
[03:38:14.820 --> 03:38:20.020]  court fees related to his work so he got into trouble with the court for saying something he
[03:38:20.020 --> 03:38:26.340]  shouldn't for reporting something which upset the one-party state now he can't buy a plane ticket
[03:38:26.340 --> 03:38:31.860]  china supreme court for example this is another example shares a blacklist of people who haven't
[03:38:31.860 --> 03:38:37.140]  paid court fines with sesame credit that's what they call their social credit score system which
[03:38:37.140 --> 03:38:44.260]  in turn deducts user scores until they saw out the bill so if you don't pay your bills then you get
[03:38:44.260 --> 03:38:49.460]  punished then you can't use other networks of websites the other example they give is jumping
[03:38:49.460 --> 03:38:55.060]  healthcare waiting lists so in china you've got these hospitals where you have to basically be in
[03:38:55.060 --> 03:38:59.860]  with the hospital to some extent to jump ahead of the queue the massive queue you can do that by
[03:38:59.860 --> 03:39:04.500]  having a good social credit score by being a good little slave and not criticizing the government
[03:39:04.500 --> 03:39:10.100]  it continues chinese citizens signing up for the wild the popular multiplayer
[03:39:10.100 --> 03:39:16.900]  shoots game counter strike global offensive must register using both their national id and sesame
[03:39:16.900 --> 03:39:22.020]  credit score according to state media so again this takes it one step beyond to the point where
[03:39:22.660 --> 03:39:26.340]  again if you've been a naughty boy or girl you've posted something on facebook you shouldn't
[03:39:27.060 --> 03:39:32.580]  then your very access to the internet gets blocked because your internet id which is linked
[03:39:32.580 --> 03:39:38.180]  with your national id is blocked is censored so these are the levels that they're willing to take
[03:39:38.180 --> 03:39:44.900]  it to it continues anyone caught using cheating software like amy like aimbot so these these
[03:39:44.900 --> 03:39:50.420]  are people playing an online video game which ensure perfect aim will have their sesame credit
[03:39:50.420 --> 03:39:57.220]  scores deducted potentially affecting their real life ability to get loans so there's literally
[03:39:57.220 --> 03:40:03.060]  everything it affects if you've been a naughty boy on the internet in china a high credit score
[03:40:03.060 --> 03:40:08.660]  can help you find a date zenni dot com a dating service with 140 million users which is partly
[03:40:08.660 --> 03:40:14.340]  owned by the american parent company behind tinder gives users with high sesame credit scores
[03:40:14.340 --> 03:40:20.020]  better visibility on their website and in a tinder like move dating giant bar hay dot com lets users
[03:40:20.020 --> 03:40:25.540]  with high sesame credit show off their score to members of the opposite sex as long as they agree
[03:40:25.540 --> 03:40:31.300]  to display their scores as well so they're taking it to the level of dating websites again if you've
[03:40:31.300 --> 03:40:36.660]  been a good boy or girl you'll rise to the top of the rankings when people are looking for dates if
[03:40:36.660 --> 03:40:43.460]  you've criticized the government or in america as it's heading criticize big tech corporations
[03:40:43.460 --> 03:40:48.100]  then maybe you won't maybe your dating profile will get buried and maybe you won't get a date
[03:40:48.100 --> 03:40:53.700]  you see what i mean how they're punishing people on a personal private level it's not just your
[03:40:53.700 --> 03:40:59.780]  band off of facebook it's then it has a knock on effect and it affects you in every other facet
[03:40:59.780 --> 03:41:06.260]  of your private life this is the intensity of the tyranny that chinese citizens are dealing with
[03:41:06.260 --> 03:41:11.140]  and facebook google they're working with them they're trying to bring it here it gives another
[03:41:11.140 --> 03:41:18.660]  example in fact a list of names a list of 169 people who were banned from buying travel tickets
[03:41:18.660 --> 03:41:24.740]  was published by the government so they literally outed people they shamed people they said don't
[03:41:24.740 --> 03:41:30.500]  do business with these people similar to how the democrats have said don't serve members of the
[03:41:30.500 --> 03:41:37.620]  trump administration at restaurants get in their face etc etc is the very same spirit another example
[03:41:37.620 --> 03:41:43.940]  about the social credit score that's already underway in china in the eastern city of suzhou
[03:41:43.940 --> 03:41:49.620]  bus fare evasion posting fake product reviews online not paying your electric bill and bucking
[03:41:49.620 --> 03:41:54.820]  a room in a hotel without showing up all caused deductions in the city's 200 point social credit
[03:41:54.820 --> 03:42:01.780]  score system so literally they've taken what was a script in black mirror from a couple of years ago
[03:42:01.780 --> 03:42:08.500]  the dystopian sci-fi series which is popular on netflix whereby everyone has a has a rating out of
[03:42:08.500 --> 03:42:13.620]  five it's like an uber rating or something everyone has a rating out of five if your rating is not
[03:42:13.620 --> 03:42:18.980]  good enough businesses will not do business with you that image right there that you're seeing up
[03:42:18.980 --> 03:42:25.940]  on screen is from that black mirror episode where basically the character is overly keen to up her
[03:42:25.940 --> 03:42:32.420]  social credit score that she overcompensates she tries too hard it makes people dislike her it makes
[03:42:32.420 --> 03:42:38.500]  them downright her on her social credit score and she can't get access to basic services she basically
[03:42:38.500 --> 03:42:43.540]  ends up destitute and homeless obviously that's an all-wellie in future that's probably way off in
[03:42:44.340 --> 03:42:48.980]  in the future but that's the spirit that's the tyranny of this social credit score this is the
[03:42:48.980 --> 03:42:55.300]  alex germshaw live info wars dot com we'll be back we all know that the outside toxins in the water

[03:47:23.380 --> 03:47:28.980]  go to some global news now this was up on info wars dot com last night article by yours truly
[03:47:29.860 --> 03:47:35.060]  germany no one recognizes our city anymore residents complain after 1200 migrants moved
[03:47:35.060 --> 03:47:40.020]  in we've seen this happen across germany where these small towns of a few thousand people get
[03:47:40.020 --> 03:47:47.140]  absolutely subsumed by migrants and the face of their town changes not for the better in the vast
[03:47:47.140 --> 03:47:52.900]  majority of cases residents of bush dead germany complain that quote no one recognizes our city
[03:47:52.900 --> 03:48:00.020]  anymore after 1200 migrants moved in increasing the population by 26 percent in one foul swoop
[03:48:00.740 --> 03:48:07.060]  may harm conic said that the town which now has 4600 inhabitants had changed drastically
[03:48:07.060 --> 03:48:12.420]  since the migrants were housed at a local military barracks is quite simply the behavior he says for
[03:48:12.420 --> 03:48:17.220]  example in shops things are stolen i experienced it myself three refugees walking on the pavement
[03:48:17.220 --> 03:48:21.620]  not making enough room for a woman with a post chair and child coming in their direction
[03:48:21.620 --> 03:48:26.260]  they make no room she has to move on to the street to get around them he said besides that they
[03:48:26.260 --> 03:48:31.860]  leave piles of rubbish and use every available space to sit around and drink beer now another
[03:48:31.860 --> 03:48:36.740]  resident that they interviewed which is coming up next in this video said quote no one recognizes
[03:48:36.740 --> 03:48:41.300]  our city anymore bush dead used to be a beautiful place a nice place to live now it's a little
[03:48:41.300 --> 03:48:47.140]  different and no one knows what the future holds now there's another video in the article which
[03:48:47.140 --> 03:48:52.740]  basically features germans who are absolutely furious anglomericals policies that's why her
[03:48:52.740 --> 03:48:58.900]  approval rating is at the lowest it's ever been in her entire political career the real mood in
[03:48:58.900 --> 03:49:04.100]  germany there it is again it's people attending protests and saying basically they voted for
[03:49:04.100 --> 03:49:08.900]  her in the past they will never vote for her again now i also mentioned in this article
[03:49:09.780 --> 03:49:16.900]  another story that we had last week about a yzidi teenager a young woman who was actually captured
[03:49:16.900 --> 03:49:23.540]  and enslaved by the islamic state in iraq she moved to germany she got refugee status one of the
[03:49:23.540 --> 03:49:28.900]  ones that actually deserved it then on the streets near stuttgart germany where she lived
[03:49:28.900 --> 03:49:35.700]  where she had registered as a refugee she met her captor she actually met the guy who captured her
[03:49:35.700 --> 03:49:42.260]  and basically sold her into sex slavery the isis bodyguard he was an actual isis member there you
[03:49:42.260 --> 03:49:49.860]  see the woman and he had registered as a refugee too so he was an actual isis member he kidnapped
[03:49:49.860 --> 03:49:55.540]  this young woman in iraq sold her into sex slavery she's walking down the street in germany after
[03:49:55.540 --> 03:50:03.540]  she's been given refugee status there and meets her former isis abductor and captor this is the
[03:50:03.540 --> 03:50:09.380]  situation in germany this is the situation in numerous european countries of course a couple
[03:50:09.380 --> 03:50:15.140]  of months ago donald trump was put on the rack once again for saying that crime had risen in germany
[03:50:15.140 --> 03:50:19.460]  actually violent crime that's risen in germany but because he didn't put the word violent in front
[03:50:19.460 --> 03:50:25.380]  of it that meant it was all fake news once again another example of that although the fact is that
[03:50:25.380 --> 03:50:30.580]  reuters has reported from german government statistics which we wrote about as well crime has
[03:50:30.580 --> 03:50:35.300]  risen and nine violent crime has risen and 90 percent of it is due to migrants that's not
[03:50:35.300 --> 03:50:40.340]  in four wars that's not bright bar that's the german government's own statistics as the fall
[03:50:40.340 --> 03:50:47.300]  out from this horrendous policy continues to reverberate around europe another story here four
[03:50:47.300 --> 03:50:51.620]  year old four-year prison sentence for afghan migrant who stabbed four people after being told
[03:50:51.620 --> 03:50:57.620]  not to harass girls which is again something we see across these major european cities gangs of
[03:50:57.620 --> 03:51:01.940]  migrants or in some cases just individual migrants harassing young women on the street
[03:51:02.660 --> 03:51:07.780]  this is in france an afghan migrant was given a short four-year sentence with one year suspended
[03:51:07.780 --> 03:51:13.940]  after being found guilty of stabbing four people in the town of perry you last week so he's basically
[03:51:13.940 --> 03:51:18.100]  you're going to be out of prison and back on the streets in three years he's not going to be deported
[03:51:18.100 --> 03:51:22.340]  the 19 year old asylum seeker was found guilty of aggravated violence over the weekend
[03:51:22.340 --> 03:51:27.700]  after he had gone on a drunk and rampage with a kitchen knife and injured four people now from
[03:51:27.700 --> 03:51:33.220]  what i read of the article two of these people who were paramedics attempted to intervene
[03:51:33.220 --> 03:51:38.420]  when he was harassing the young girls and they got stabbed for their trouble so again don't
[03:51:38.420 --> 03:51:43.460]  interfere when they're harassing girls because he might end up dead this guy gets three years basically
[03:51:43.460 --> 03:51:49.140]  is going to be on the streets in three years or less another story out of greece young man dies
[03:51:49.140 --> 03:51:54.660]  while trying to protect his girlfriend from three asian migrants in greece on the 16th of august
[03:51:54.660 --> 03:51:59.380]  near the hill of philip apu under the acropolis in effens a gang of three migrants attacked a young
[03:51:59.380 --> 03:52:04.180]  couple during the night the migrants tried to separate a 23 year old portuguese woman from
[03:52:04.180 --> 03:52:09.300]  her boyfriend the young greek reacted immediately fighting all three of them during the fight the
[03:52:09.300 --> 03:52:13.780]  25 year old greek fell off the cliff resulting in fatal injuries the gang fled due to the screams
[03:52:13.780 --> 03:52:18.020]  of his girlfriend so basically he's trying to defend his girlfriend from being attacked by
[03:52:18.020 --> 03:52:23.380]  these migrants fell off a cliff and died again yet another story which has barely been reported
[03:52:23.380 --> 03:52:27.460]  it's been reported i think in voice of europe no other mainstream media outlet will pick it up
[03:52:27.460 --> 03:52:33.300]  because it goes against their agenda especially with key european elections coming up including
[03:52:33.300 --> 03:52:38.340]  next month in sweden where the sweden democrats who are the only anti mass migration party are
[03:52:38.340 --> 03:52:44.660]  expected to perform very well now going back to the social media censorship here's a story that
[03:52:44.660 --> 03:52:49.940]  just broke earlier giddly don't know if we'll see legislation on social media censorship that's a
[03:52:49.940 --> 03:52:55.620]  question for congress so this was white house deputy press secretary hogan giddly who stated
[03:52:55.620 --> 03:52:59.780]  that he isn't sure if there's going to be any legislation dealing with social media censorship
[03:52:59.780 --> 03:53:04.580]  this is a matter for congress but he added that the president had been using the bully pulpit
[03:53:04.580 --> 03:53:11.300]  to call attention to the issue so at least we have finally trump tweeting about this
[03:53:11.300 --> 03:53:16.740]  whether there's action in congress remains to be seen obviously section 230 of the decency
[03:53:16.740 --> 03:53:22.580]  communications act already mandates social media companies not to act like publishers
[03:53:22.580 --> 03:53:26.340]  or their immunity from being sued for the content posted on their websites
[03:53:26.340 --> 03:53:31.540]  will be withdrawn so the law is basically already there it's just not being enforced and it needs
[03:53:31.540 --> 03:53:38.660]  to be enforced sooner rather than later before they ban everyone now we had a poll out of rasmussen
[03:53:38.660 --> 03:53:45.060]  the other day headline rasmussen poll just 18 percent of american support and tifa and the
[03:53:45.060 --> 03:53:51.060]  support is dropping imagine my shot the more innocent people they attack on the street including
[03:53:51.060 --> 03:53:58.180]  this past weekend or a couple of weekends ago an american who is flying a an american flag old glory
[03:53:58.180 --> 03:54:03.940]  turned out to be a bernie senders supporting leftist they bashed him over the head with a pipe
[03:54:03.940 --> 03:54:10.180]  because they fight the nazis right the bernie senders supporting nazis no it's anyone who
[03:54:10.180 --> 03:54:16.100]  carries an american flag because they hate america and as this poll illustrates the american people
[03:54:16.100 --> 03:54:22.020]  hate them too the rasmussen reports national telephone and online survey finds that only 18
[03:54:22.020 --> 03:54:27.380]  percent of likely us voters share a favorable opinion of the anti for protesters with six
[03:54:27.380 --> 03:54:33.060]  percent have viewed them very favorably that compares to 24 percent and eight percent respectively
[03:54:33.060 --> 03:54:39.540]  last september so these numbers are dropping the more americans see a vantifa's thuggish violent
[03:54:39.540 --> 03:54:44.660]  ridiculous behavior on the streets of america the more they disapprove so it's actually working
[03:54:44.660 --> 03:54:50.020]  in trumps favor of course i've said for many months that trumps 2020 campaign ads should be
[03:54:50.020 --> 03:54:55.700]  chock full of footage like this of anti for attacking people on the streets because it's
[03:54:55.700 --> 03:55:00.740]  very effective and it gets the message across as to who the left really is supporting of course
[03:55:00.740 --> 03:55:06.740]  they've made the whole moral panic about the alt right and the neo nazis on the right we disavow
[03:55:06.740 --> 03:55:12.500]  the neo nazis we don't embrace them to any degree the far left and in some cases the center left
[03:55:12.500 --> 03:55:18.260]  if it even still exists they not only don't disavow their violence they embrace their violence
[03:55:18.260 --> 03:55:24.980]  because they say oh but they're called anti for that means anti fascists so that means if you
[03:55:24.980 --> 03:55:31.220]  don't support anti for you're a fascist which is like saying that the democratic republic of north
[03:55:31.220 --> 03:55:39.220]  korea is a democratic republic newsflash it isn't so the poll shows dropping support plummeting
[03:55:39.220 --> 03:55:44.980]  support for anti for i mean 18 percent as a as a stat is too high to begin with but now
[03:55:44.980 --> 03:55:49.860]  that's dropping over the course of last year the more american see of their unbridled violence and
[03:55:49.860 --> 03:55:58.020]  hatred on the streets of america now noted nazi apologist donald trump has dumbfounded everyone
[03:55:58.020 --> 03:56:04.500]  by deporting the last nazi in america this is abc news nazi death camp guard arrested by ice
[03:56:04.500 --> 03:56:09.700]  deported to germany a man who authorities believe that is the last known nazi collaborator living
[03:56:09.700 --> 03:56:14.740]  in the us has been arrested and deported to germany at the order of president donald trump
[03:56:14.740 --> 03:56:19.780]  immigration customs enforcement agents which the left wants to completely abolish you know the
[03:56:19.780 --> 03:56:25.460]  the the agency that's actually kicking nazis out of the country the moral panic neo-nazis
[03:56:25.460 --> 03:56:31.460]  are everywhere crowd wants them abolished removed 95 year old jawick page from his
[03:56:31.460 --> 03:56:35.300]  queen's new york home on monday and you can see the video there on the article so again
[03:56:36.180 --> 03:56:43.300]  noted neo-nazi apologist donald trump deport america's last living nazi something that
[03:56:43.300 --> 03:56:50.020]  the rack obama completely failed to do doesn't quite fit with the narrative does it afp reports
[03:56:50.020 --> 03:56:55.540]  israelis as gun controls following lone wolf attacks israel has changed its gun regulations
[03:56:55.540 --> 03:57:00.020]  have they made it harder to get guns because of lone wolf attacks no they've done the opposite
[03:57:00.020 --> 03:57:05.620]  they've let responsible people own firearms they've changed the regulations to enable hundreds of
[03:57:05.620 --> 03:57:10.740]  thousands more civilians to apply for licenses remove authorities say will increase security
[03:57:10.740 --> 03:57:15.140]  but others argue will stop violence the shift in policy announced by the public security ministry
[03:57:15.140 --> 03:57:21.060]  means that up to 600 000 israelis could apply for gun licenses a dramatic increase on the current
[03:57:21.060 --> 03:57:27.860]  140 000 civilians with permits so they decided to react to violent criminals trying to kill people
[03:57:27.860 --> 03:57:33.220]  by arming responsible people who can shoot bullets in the opposite direction that's going to wrap it
