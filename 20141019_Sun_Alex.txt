[00:00.000 --> 00:11.280]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[00:11.280 --> 00:13.640]  the mind of man.
[00:13.640 --> 00:36.080]  I am your host Alex Jones, and we are going to air a special report that David Knight
[00:36.080 --> 00:40.880]  filed for M4Worst Nightly News Friday evening, then we come back and will officially kick
[00:40.880 --> 00:47.680]  off the transmission with the latest US military preps team for Ebola response in the United
[00:47.680 --> 00:48.680]  States.
[00:48.680 --> 00:51.400]  That's the big headline on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:51.400 --> 00:57.600]  It's a CNN story that is coming up after the break and a special guest formerly with
[00:57.600 --> 01:12.040]  the Central Intelligence Agency, on Ebola.
[01:12.040 --> 01:16.560]  At every crisis, whether engineered, natural or accidental, the Obama administration has
[01:16.560 --> 01:21.280]  exacerbated it as an opportunity for control and manipulation.
[01:21.280 --> 01:23.880]  The Ebola outbreak is no different.
[01:23.880 --> 01:28.400]  There are many people from the powerless to the political and corporate elites, from hippies
[01:28.400 --> 01:33.800]  to microbiologists like Eric Pionka, who want radical depopulation.
[01:33.800 --> 01:35.800]  Just look at this letter to the editor.
[01:35.800 --> 01:41.680]  Of course, it refers to James Lovelock's Gaia theory, a popular way to sell radical depopulation
[01:41.680 --> 01:45.840]  to the masses, to the very people against whom it will be used.
[01:45.840 --> 01:51.320]  I see the earth as more than just a mixture of living things and inanimate matter.
[01:51.320 --> 01:54.160]  I see it as a tightly coupled entity.
[01:54.160 --> 01:58.240]  And the way it's presented to the masses, it anthropomorphizes the earth as a living
[01:58.240 --> 02:04.400]  organism and presents humans not as the stewards of God's created earth, but as a virus.
[02:04.400 --> 02:08.840]  And Lovelock himself conveniently plays into their global warming alarmism, talking about
[02:08.840 --> 02:14.760]  global warming being a fever that the planetary organism, the earth, gets from the virus,
[02:14.760 --> 02:15.760]  the humans.
[02:15.760 --> 02:22.960]  And I like to think of it as a kind of organism, not just a lump of rot with life on it.
[02:22.960 --> 02:29.600]  Any organism can have periods of ill health, and it was pretty unfortunate of us to start
[02:29.600 --> 02:32.720]  worsening the fever that the planet was already in.
[02:32.720 --> 02:36.400]  And of course, environmentalists quickly draw the obvious conclusion that if mankind's
[02:36.400 --> 02:40.000]  a virus, a cancer, it must be eradicated.
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.040]  And so Gaia has been used to put a pagan, new age, happy face mask on the grim reaper
[02:45.040 --> 02:50.080]  of depopulation and sell it as both necessary and inevitable.
[02:50.080 --> 02:57.440]  So what do you think is a viable figure that Gaia, that the planet can sustain?
[02:57.440 --> 03:02.640]  I would guess living the way we do, not more than one billion, probably less.
[03:02.640 --> 03:05.240]  Here you sit saying we are facing doom.
[03:05.240 --> 03:11.560]  We are facing the possibility of five-sixths of our human population being wiped out within
[03:11.560 --> 03:12.560]  a century.
[03:12.560 --> 03:17.520]  This scheme has been picked up and repeated in popular culture.
[03:17.520 --> 03:21.760]  There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.
[03:21.760 --> 03:25.080]  Do you know what it is?
[03:25.080 --> 03:28.080]  A virus.
[03:28.080 --> 03:38.320]  Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet, you are a plague, and we are the cure.
[03:38.320 --> 03:42.680]  So how do we get rid of this human virus that threatens our beloved Earth Mother, Gaia?
[03:42.680 --> 03:46.800]  Or as another scientist puts it, those upright mammalian weeds.
[03:46.800 --> 03:51.160]  As the Church of Euthanasia puts it in their Gaia Liberation Front proposal, solutions
[03:51.160 --> 03:55.400]  to get rid of the human virus like nuclear war or sterilization just aren't as effective
[03:55.400 --> 03:57.040]  as bioengineering.
[03:57.040 --> 04:01.440]  It has the advantage that it could be done with just one person who has the right technical
[04:01.440 --> 04:02.760]  expertise.
[04:02.760 --> 04:07.240]  And there are multitudes of people with the technical expertise and the philosophical
[04:07.240 --> 04:13.000]  bent to do this as Alex Jones pointed out in the documentary Endgame seven years ago.
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.280]  Prominent University of Texas Biologist Dr. Eric Pionka, while receiving an award from
[04:18.280 --> 04:25.160]  the Texas Academy of Science, said that the worldwide AIDS pandemic was, quote, no good,
[04:25.160 --> 04:30.360]  it's too slow, and went on to laud the virtues of Ebola because it would kill 90% of the
[04:30.360 --> 04:33.720]  world population quickly.
[04:33.720 --> 04:39.200]  But most frightening was the fact that in a crowd of over 1,000 prominent scientists,
[04:39.200 --> 04:46.680]  local newspapers reported that 95% of those in attendance gave Pionka sustained standing
[04:46.680 --> 04:54.000]  ovations every time he stole the virtues of mass culling microbes and man's destruction.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  For If It Wores Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.160]  All right, folks, we'll be back with a live transmission on this Sunday.
[05:00.160 --> 05:01.160]  Stay with us.
[05:01.160 --> 05:05.400]  We're here for a little research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around
[05:05.400 --> 05:08.040]  the key concepts of super oxygenation.
[05:08.040 --> 05:12.940]  The next level in cleansing is here with key ingredients backed by real clinical studies.
[05:12.940 --> 05:17.520]  The new oxy powder available through Info Wars Life was invented during Dr. Group's
[05:17.520 --> 05:20.040]  research on the toxification of our bodies.
[05:20.040 --> 05:25.280]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[05:25.280 --> 05:30.560]  ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[05:30.560 --> 05:35.160]  Finally start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[05:35.160 --> 05:39.960]  Oxy powder does not require time off work, and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[05:39.960 --> 05:46.280]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[05:46.280 --> 05:50.960]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[05:50.960 --> 06:01.120]  Go to infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com to get started with oxy powder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[06:20.960 --> 06:27.960]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones, coming to you from Deepenard
[06:27.960 --> 06:33.800]  of Texas, Austin, blasting out across the United States and worldwide on over a hundred
[06:33.800 --> 06:41.840]  and seventy AM and FM affiliates from everywhere, from Oklahoma to Florida, from up in Chicago,
[06:41.840 --> 06:45.460]  Illinois, from Los Angeles, California to Rochester, New York.
[06:45.460 --> 06:49.000]  We are broadcasting on over a hundred and seventy AM and FM affiliates, and of course
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.520]  we dominate internet news at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, you can find the free
[06:54.520 --> 06:56.960]  podcast, video feeds and more.
[06:56.960 --> 07:04.760]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday, the 19th day of October 2014.
[07:04.760 --> 07:10.800]  The U.S. military is preparing teams for the U.S., that's CNN, we've got U.S. hospitals
[07:10.800 --> 07:14.640]  that prepare themselves for Ebola panic as flu season looms.
[07:14.640 --> 07:21.080]  I do think this is a major crisis because it kills at least 70% of people that come
[07:21.080 --> 07:25.800]  in contact, that's with medical help, 90% if you don't have it, and the government's
[07:25.800 --> 07:27.920]  doing nothing to stop it.
[07:27.920 --> 07:32.120]  That's why people are right to be concerned, but instead of just panicking, we need to
[07:32.120 --> 07:38.120]  take action with a plan that can force the CDC, the federal government, to protect this
[07:38.120 --> 07:43.400]  nation from something that the panic alone could cause the next Great Depression.
[07:43.400 --> 07:48.640]  Here's a special report I filed Friday night with a solution to stopping Ebola.
[07:48.640 --> 08:05.680]  Here it is.
[08:05.680 --> 08:09.640]  Stopping this disease won't be easy, but we know how to do it.
[08:09.640 --> 08:14.360]  Getting Ebola, the president says a travel ban won't work, so why are so many countries
[08:14.360 --> 08:15.360]  doing it?
[08:15.360 --> 08:17.560]  A national strike is the answer.
[08:17.560 --> 08:21.760]  I'm wearing the same shirt I was when I was in the car with that family.
[08:21.760 --> 08:26.160]  There is zero risk, I said it, there it is, I shouldn't say that.
[08:26.160 --> 08:27.160]  There's no risk.
[08:27.160 --> 08:32.640]  If there were any risk, I would not expose myself or my family.
[08:32.640 --> 08:37.800]  A national strike will force Obama and the federal government to secure the borders and
[08:37.800 --> 08:40.400]  stop West African flights.
[08:40.400 --> 08:46.320]  A travel ban is less effective than the measures that we are currently instituting.
[08:46.320 --> 08:47.400]  Bravo Sierra.
[08:47.400 --> 08:49.440]  I have a question for you.
[08:49.440 --> 08:55.600]  Do you want to end up like West African countries that are in a stage of panic and total collapse
[08:55.600 --> 09:01.360]  with the UN estimating that over a million people will end up getting Ebola by December?
[09:01.360 --> 09:03.360]  Or do you want to stop it?
[09:03.360 --> 09:11.320]  The default federal law CDC regulation position for the last 30 years on Ebola, smallpox,
[09:11.320 --> 09:14.120]  black plague, you name it, has been the same.
[09:14.120 --> 09:19.480]  If there's a major outbreak in a country, ban travel from that nation to your country
[09:19.480 --> 09:25.600]  during the pandemic in that nation and beef up security on your borders.
[09:25.600 --> 09:33.240]  AP reported today that African nations bordering the five countries yet have had no Ebola cases
[09:33.240 --> 09:37.760]  because more than two months ago they banned flights out of those countries once it reached
[09:37.760 --> 09:43.680]  pandemic levels and they put border guards with machine guns on their borders to let
[09:43.680 --> 09:44.920]  no one come in.
[09:44.920 --> 09:48.480]  Zero cases, they stopped the spread.
[09:48.480 --> 09:53.320]  The default setting in this country was to do the same.
[09:53.320 --> 09:56.520]  Instead, our southern border is totally wide open.
[09:56.520 --> 09:59.360]  Anybody who comes across is basically instantly legalized.
[09:59.360 --> 10:04.000]  The state and local jails are opening up and releasing all the illegals who are felons,
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.920]  who have committed crimes because the feds won't even take them.
[10:06.920 --> 10:10.880]  The southern border is collapsing, the northern border is wide open in many areas, and the
[10:10.880 --> 10:14.360]  flights out of Africa are still coming in.
[10:14.360 --> 10:17.720]  Now it was bad enough that they brought a bunch of Ebola patients from Africa here to
[10:17.720 --> 10:18.720]  begin with.
[10:18.720 --> 10:20.120]  That had never been done before.
[10:20.120 --> 10:26.520]  Then they put them in low level, regular hospitals, not high level, military level four.
[10:26.520 --> 10:29.960]  But if that wasn't out of control enough, then they started letting people out of the
[10:29.960 --> 10:36.560]  Ebola countries fly here when two months ago the U.K., France, Arab countries, just like
[10:36.560 --> 10:42.000]  Africa had banned people traveling by planes into their nations.
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.360]  And they set up serious screening on their borders because they didn't want Ebola.
[10:47.360 --> 10:48.440]  Spain didn't do that.
[10:48.440 --> 10:50.640]  They've got Ebola cases now.
[10:50.640 --> 10:53.120]  This is insanity, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:53.120 --> 10:56.440]  Only the U.S. and Spain are behaving like this.
[10:56.440 --> 11:01.080]  Central and South American and Caribbean countries have banned people from West Africa.
[11:01.080 --> 11:07.040]  General Kelly, they had a South Com admitted Africans are pouring in to the southern border,
[11:07.040 --> 11:11.480]  and then if Ebola ends up in Central or South America, there will be a huge exodus into
[11:11.480 --> 11:12.480]  the U.S.
[11:12.480 --> 11:14.360]  We've got to secure that border right now.
[11:14.360 --> 11:16.160]  But we don't have a lot of time.
[11:16.160 --> 11:18.920]  Once the panic starts, they won't be able to contain it.
[11:18.920 --> 11:20.720]  They've got to get in position now.
[11:20.720 --> 11:22.560]  This is default common sense.
[11:22.560 --> 11:28.040]  I've talked to top military brass, top virologist, epidemiologist, medical doctors on air.
[11:28.040 --> 11:29.640]  This is not my opinion.
[11:29.640 --> 11:32.840]  I've talked to Navy commanders, Coast Guard experts on disease.
[11:32.840 --> 11:36.880]  They say the default positions are being stopped.
[11:36.880 --> 11:39.480]  There is a stand down going on.
[11:39.480 --> 11:45.280]  To counter this, we are calling for a nationwide strike starting next Monday through Wednesday
[11:45.280 --> 11:49.560]  for you to stay home, especially if your medical workers, police, EMTs that are going to be
[11:49.560 --> 11:51.440]  hard to sit by this.
[11:51.440 --> 11:55.320]  To draw attention to the fact that the federal government is on strike and not doing its
[11:55.320 --> 11:58.080]  default job allowing these flights to come in.
[11:58.080 --> 12:00.320]  Even the Speaker of the House has said stop the flights.
[12:00.320 --> 12:07.040]  Senator Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Governor Jindal of Louisiana, but not President Obama.
[12:07.040 --> 12:08.720]  He's out defending this.
[12:08.720 --> 12:13.320]  Now, remember, it was someone flying in from Africa that brought it here, now spreading
[12:13.320 --> 12:15.880]  to nurses and clearly others.
[12:15.880 --> 12:17.640]  Why do they want it here?
[12:17.640 --> 12:22.160]  To create a bigger crisis, to get more funding, to be a political distraction from all the
[12:22.160 --> 12:28.640]  other scandals and the new czar who works for Al Gore previously who has no Ebola background
[12:28.640 --> 12:30.480]  or experience, no medical training.
[12:30.480 --> 12:37.560]  He's an expert at divvying up tens of billions in funding to insiders to run the Ebola disaster
[12:37.560 --> 12:42.080]  where literally hundreds of billions could be made, not just on the vaccine, but on the
[12:42.080 --> 12:44.280]  disaster itself.
[12:44.280 --> 12:46.640]  We're seeing a bank robbery here, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:46.640 --> 12:51.400]  We're seeing a crisis where the managers of the crisis are set to make billions and
[12:51.400 --> 12:56.280]  billions of dollars per week during this crisis that could go on for months, if not
[12:56.280 --> 12:58.800]  years, if it's not contained now.
[12:58.800 --> 13:02.360]  So go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[13:02.360 --> 13:06.920]  Get the article with the hashtag stop Ebola strike.
[13:06.920 --> 13:09.080]  Send it out on Facebook, out on Twitter.
[13:09.080 --> 13:14.520]  Send our article with the videos of the general warning and others so that people understand
[13:14.520 --> 13:19.000]  we don't have to be powerless and just watch the federal government engage in criminal
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  neglect by design.
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.200]  We can A, put pressure on them to take action, but B, if this pandemic gets out of control
[13:26.200 --> 13:32.520]  and becomes even worse, if this epidemic grows into a pandemic, then the people involved
[13:32.520 --> 13:34.200]  can be held accountable.
[13:34.200 --> 13:40.360]  But also it can be used as practice for sheltering in place and for self-quarantining if this
[13:40.360 --> 13:41.840]  gets out of hand.
[13:41.840 --> 13:46.080]  So Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, if you're not essential folks or people like myself
[13:46.080 --> 13:49.960]  that have got to be on air, self-quarantine is a test.
[13:49.960 --> 13:54.720]  We'll call the national strike, call talk radio, call Congress, call the White House,
[13:54.720 --> 14:00.480]  call media, send out tweets, be an activist Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday to fight Ebola
[14:00.480 --> 14:05.320]  and to stop Ebola with the stop Ebola national strike.
[14:05.320 --> 14:07.000]  We can stop it.
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.840]  There is a solution.
[14:08.840 --> 14:11.040]  There is a way to bring it down.
[14:11.040 --> 14:16.120]  There is a way to make them put the default actions in, and there may still be time to
[14:16.120 --> 14:20.520]  stop it before it spreads to thousands or even hundreds of thousands or more.
[14:20.520 --> 14:26.640]  And the whole Homeland Security apparatus has the pretext it needs for total federalization.
[14:26.640 --> 14:30.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've been warning of a biological false flag.
[14:30.240 --> 14:31.440]  This is clearly that.
[14:31.440 --> 14:34.280]  I don't know if they cooked it up in a lab, even though they have a history of doing that.
[14:34.280 --> 14:35.360]  I don't know that.
[14:35.360 --> 14:40.320]  I know that they certainly let it in and are now doing everything they can to help it
[14:40.320 --> 14:41.320]  spread.
[14:41.320 --> 14:43.120]  So the ball is in your court.
[14:43.120 --> 14:47.920]  Send this to friends and family, your email list, Twitter, Facebook, other talk show hosts.
[14:47.920 --> 14:49.760]  Get them to cover it.
[14:49.760 --> 14:52.400]  Organize and be part of this strike, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:52.400 --> 14:55.280]  This is how we can draw attention to this and stop it.
[14:55.280 --> 14:59.960]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off for InfoWars Nightly News with this emergency news bulletin.
[14:59.960 --> 15:00.960]  Right.
[15:00.960 --> 15:01.960]  Right in Texas.
[15:01.960 --> 15:02.960]  Just a few hundred miles away.
[15:02.960 --> 15:08.560]  That was of Friday night, 7 o'clock central, InfoWars Nightly News, part of that transmission
[15:08.560 --> 15:16.560]  Monday through Friday, 7 o'clock central at infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[15:16.560 --> 15:23.160]  The article is hashtag stopabola strike, national strike to force Obama to block West African
[15:23.160 --> 15:24.160]  flights.
[15:24.160 --> 15:27.240]  And I'm going to have Kit Daniels, who's up here working with us on Sunday night, repost
[15:27.240 --> 15:33.320]  it to the top of infowars.com and prisonplanet.com with a red link so you can find the article
[15:33.320 --> 15:39.320]  about it with all of the bibliograph links and the video that you just heard the audio
[15:39.320 --> 15:43.120]  from so you can send it to your friends and family, post it on Facebook, Twitter and other
[15:43.120 --> 15:44.120]  places.
[15:44.120 --> 15:45.880]  There is huge heat from Congress.
[15:45.880 --> 15:46.880]  You name it.
[15:46.880 --> 15:51.600]  To control the border, check for Ebola and stop West African flights so we can get this
[15:51.600 --> 15:52.600]  done.
[15:52.600 --> 15:53.600]  This strike is just one part of it.
[15:53.600 --> 15:56.600]  We're going to come back with the latest Ebola news and a lot more.
[15:56.600 --> 15:57.600]  Stay with us.
[15:57.600 --> 16:01.480]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[16:01.480 --> 16:06.560]  From the water table to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more
[16:06.560 --> 16:10.920]  and more toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[16:10.920 --> 16:15.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[16:15.000 --> 16:19.840]  than even outdoor air, and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[16:19.840 --> 16:21.400]  chemicals within their homes.
[16:21.400 --> 16:25.920]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States, well over a thousand types
[16:25.920 --> 16:28.800]  of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[16:28.800 --> 16:32.320]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic
[16:32.320 --> 16:33.320]  to as well.
[16:33.320 --> 16:37.440]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[16:37.440 --> 16:42.440]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[16:42.440 --> 16:43.440]  back against.
[16:43.440 --> 16:47.720]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[16:47.720 --> 16:51.840]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be
[16:51.840 --> 16:54.240]  brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[17:10.440 --> 17:15.880]  Security, analysis, Info Wars, building independent media operations, you let the worst people
[17:15.880 --> 17:19.840]  get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[17:19.840 --> 17:22.720]  Prime Directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[17:22.720 --> 17:27.680]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory, a popular conspiracy theory talk show called
[17:27.680 --> 17:28.680]  Info Wars.
[17:28.680 --> 17:30.680]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin Jail.
[17:30.680 --> 17:36.200]  These people are assaulting us, targeting of patriots engaged, they are never going
[17:36.200 --> 17:41.200]  to stop, they're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[18:23.600 --> 18:28.840]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[18:28.840 --> 18:34.320]  Not our iodine, it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested
[18:34.320 --> 18:36.320]  and proven to be completely pure.

[19:00.800 --> 19:05.240]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo, at the same time
[19:05.240 --> 19:08.840]  they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.

[19:47.320 --> 19:49.920]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[19:49.920 --> 19:52.880]  I look forward to waking up and taking my supermail vitality.

[20:03.600 --> 20:16.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:16.920 --> 20:22.360]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[20:22.360 --> 20:32.800]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[20:32.800 --> 20:40.640]  Back when I was a little boy, I would have feelings about things, gut instincts and I
[20:40.640 --> 20:46.000]  never followed my gut and bad things happened.
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.720]  But through the last 40 years of my life, over time, I learned to listen to that little
[20:51.720 --> 20:57.600]  inner voice, that conscience, that six sense, that discernment the Bible talks about.
[20:57.600 --> 21:04.360]  And the more I follow my inner voice, the more I have nothing but success and prosperity
[21:04.360 --> 21:12.960]  and blessings until I've gotten to the point where I follow my inner voice about 90% of
[21:12.960 --> 21:13.960]  the time.
[21:13.960 --> 21:14.960]  When I was 14, 0.
[21:14.960 --> 21:22.040]  It's funny when you're 5, you follow your inner voice and you kind of rebel when you're
[21:22.040 --> 21:24.800]  14, 15, 16, you know, up to 20.
[21:24.800 --> 21:31.080]  But the more I follow that inner voice, that's common sense, better my life gets.
[21:31.080 --> 21:34.480]  Let me tell you about my inner voice here.
[21:34.480 --> 21:36.880]  I shared it with you here on air.
[21:36.880 --> 21:42.000]  I go off geopolitics, I go off research, I go off reading the news, I go off talking
[21:42.000 --> 21:43.000]  to other experts.
[21:43.000 --> 21:48.480]  But at the end of the day, after I've intellectually looked at everything, I go with my gut.
[21:48.480 --> 21:55.080]  And you know that since about a year ago, a little less than a year ago, about 11 months
[21:55.080 --> 22:01.680]  ago, I began going on air saying, I believe next winter is going to be MRSA, flesh eating
[22:01.680 --> 22:08.880]  bacteria, hellish flu, and I've never talked like this on 20 years on air.
[22:08.880 --> 22:12.880]  Because intellectually, I could see all the local news stories and the numbers about flesh
[22:12.880 --> 22:18.960]  eating bacteria and hospital-born illnesses and drug-resistant staff and drug-resistant
[22:18.960 --> 22:20.440]  strep.
[22:20.440 --> 22:29.280]  But I also had three family members die in the last month of 2013 and the first month
[22:29.280 --> 22:30.480]  of 2014.
[22:30.480 --> 22:35.920]  And I talked to the doctors at the big hospitals where they were dying and I did the research
[22:35.920 --> 22:41.120]  and they just said that the antibiotics don't work anymore and you stop feeding them to
[22:41.120 --> 22:45.320]  farm animals so we can have them in unsanitary conditions.
[22:45.320 --> 22:48.040]  It's creating superbugs.
[22:48.040 --> 22:52.360]  And so I said that I was doing everything I could this year to get my immune system
[22:52.360 --> 22:58.120]  straight and to get as best of shape as I could and to get my family as in best shape
[22:58.120 --> 23:08.040]  as I could because I sat on air over and over again that I saw a biological crisis in the
[23:08.040 --> 23:10.600]  winter of 2014, 2015.
[23:10.600 --> 23:14.400]  I'm on record hundreds of times.
[23:14.400 --> 23:17.800]  People thought I was pretty weird, warning about something that hadn't even shown up
[23:17.800 --> 23:20.040]  yet.
[23:20.040 --> 23:21.600]  My guts saw family dying.
[23:21.600 --> 23:27.440]  My guts and my intellectual side, talking to doctors, realized there was a lot of mystery
[23:27.440 --> 23:33.480]  illnesses and stuff going on that nobody was talking about and I was at the cemetery every
[23:33.480 --> 23:37.400]  couple weeks burying somebody.
[23:37.400 --> 23:40.240]  My dad had pneumonia for two months.
[23:40.240 --> 23:41.520]  I had it for a month and a half.
[23:41.520 --> 23:44.640]  I've never had that in my life.
[23:44.640 --> 23:45.640]  Antibiotics didn't work, folks.
[23:45.640 --> 23:48.680]  I had to go alternative.
[23:48.680 --> 23:51.160]  We're talking a month of coughing up blood.
[23:51.160 --> 23:55.920]  We're talking about having trouble being on air every day, coughing so much at your chest
[23:55.920 --> 24:05.600]  and muscles and your belly ache, coughing up chunks of my throat.
[24:05.600 --> 24:12.560]  So there's a perfect storm of drug-resistant, antibiotic-resistant bacteria and drug-resistant
[24:12.560 --> 24:14.920]  viruses and that's on record.
[24:14.920 --> 24:17.440]  You don't have to have a gut to know that.
[24:17.440 --> 24:18.840]  You don't have to have a sixth sense of that.
[24:18.840 --> 24:22.840]  You can see it in the numbers.
[24:22.840 --> 24:31.680]  So when Ebola, previously the biggest outbreak for 30-something people, when Ebola infects
[24:31.680 --> 24:36.440]  hundreds of thousands, kills 4,500, that's a whitewash number, probably in the hundreds
[24:36.440 --> 24:39.520]  of thousands from the numbers we've seen, they are really covering up.
[24:39.520 --> 24:44.960]  When the UN says 1.4 million are going to get it by December and then our government
[24:44.960 --> 24:50.160]  leaves the borders open and flies people in from Ebola-stricken countries that aren't
[24:50.160 --> 24:56.160]  even citizens and then sends janitors to clean up the vomit in the house with no breathing
[24:56.160 --> 25:03.840]  apparatus, zero, not even gloves, and they send this guy's kids to school and they don't
[25:03.840 --> 25:08.760]  clean up the ambulance and they send them to a regular hospital and they get on the
[25:08.760 --> 25:16.640]  news and say, zero chance you can get it, zero chance, this thing doesn't show signs
[25:16.640 --> 25:20.960]  for three days like it used to, it's 21 days, it's mutated hundreds of times.
[25:20.960 --> 25:25.600]  It clearly is beginning to go airborne, that's even in the New York Times now, they're covering
[25:25.600 --> 25:35.320]  it up and people's gut tells them this government has lied to us on every front.
[25:35.320 --> 25:39.640]  Even the Huffington Post that's an arm of Obama says that Ebola told in West Africa
[25:39.640 --> 25:43.480]  is likely hugely underestimated, no kidding, there are whole towns where there's just
[25:43.480 --> 25:47.880]  dead bodies piled up everywhere and all over the streets, it ain't 4,000, it's probably
[25:47.880 --> 25:54.840]  like a million, I mean it is five countries collapsing, by the way AP reported on Friday
[25:54.840 --> 25:59.480]  and we covered this earlier in that piece, that the countries all around them sealed
[25:59.480 --> 26:03.360]  their borders, put trips of machine guns on their borders and stopped the flights months
[26:03.360 --> 26:13.240]  ago, zero spread, zero spread in those countries and every other country, Central, South America,
[26:13.240 --> 26:17.760]  the Caribbean, Europe, they all banned flights months ago, we haven't and Obama sits up there
[26:17.760 --> 26:26.640]  with a straight face and he says, hey, not gonna happen, nothing's gonna happen or now
[26:26.640 --> 26:30.880]  that it's here, it's no big deal, it probably won't spread and all the experts say leave
[26:30.880 --> 26:40.240]  the flights open, bull, bull, bull, all they gotta do is not issue West Africans visas
[26:40.240 --> 26:45.000]  for a few months, in those West African countries they don't let people out of their houses
[26:45.000 --> 26:51.440]  in areas yet and by the way they wanna get that going over here so they can pull that
[26:51.440 --> 26:57.000]  martial law system and then martial law will save us, medical emergency will save us and
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.160]  the precedent is set, it's even in the news, type in the headline, Obamacare gets a boost
[27:02.160 --> 27:07.920]  from Ebola or why Ebola's good for Obamacare, yeah, big federal response, the media will
[27:07.920 --> 27:12.640]  say Obama's a savior when he's the opposite, so we've gotta ask the question today and
[27:12.640 --> 27:18.640]  I wanna talk to medical workers, nurses, doctors, epidemiologists, virologists, police
[27:18.640 --> 27:27.160]  officers, jail staff, I wanna talk to the custodians that are having to clean up these
[27:27.160 --> 27:30.840]  airplanes that have been protesting for almost three weeks and refusing, I mean they had
[27:30.840 --> 27:34.920]  all these flights from Nigeria and places where people are vomiting and dying on planes
[27:34.920 --> 27:39.840]  last week, that was in the New York Times even and in New York Post and they're just
[27:39.840 --> 27:44.080]  like don't worry, there's no Ebola without even doing a medical check, they just lands,
[27:44.080 --> 27:48.200]  we got a dead guy on board, died vomiting, there's some blood, don't worry about it,
[27:48.200 --> 27:52.320]  I mean you can see there's a cover up and that's why people are so concerned is because
[27:52.320 --> 28:02.400]  they have zero confidence, zero confidence, yeah there's, Obamacare may hold the key
[28:02.400 --> 28:12.400]  to saving the U.S. from Ebola out of F.P., foreign policy and arm of the Washington Post,
[28:12.400 --> 28:21.640]  their political, geopolitical, wonk magazine, by the way that magazine admitted a couple
[28:21.640 --> 28:25.480]  years ago that our government runs Al Qaeda, but when they admitted it's okay and intellectual,
[28:25.480 --> 28:32.560]  but I say it, you know, 12 years ago it's a T-ball or 13 years ago, we're gonna go to
[28:32.560 --> 28:37.160]  break, we're gonna come back and take your phone calls, I wanna hear from medical workers,
[28:37.160 --> 28:41.360]  from police, from military, they're now announcing military preps team for Ebola response in
[28:41.360 --> 28:46.240]  the U.S., I wanna hear from you what you think, am I wrong here, am I right, can you augment,
[28:46.240 --> 28:57.640]  can you give me more intel, what do you think, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, give
[28:57.640 --> 29:01.800]  me a call at FullWars.com.
[29:01.800 --> 29:06.040]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city has
[29:06.040 --> 29:07.840]  been told not to drink the water.
[29:07.840 --> 29:10.560]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[29:10.560 --> 29:16.240]  But you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[29:16.240 --> 29:17.560]  single day.
[29:17.560 --> 29:20.560]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[29:20.560 --> 29:23.480]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[29:23.480 --> 29:28.040]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo, you can see the shelves empty where water once
[29:28.040 --> 29:29.040]  was.
[29:29.040 --> 29:34.360]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[29:34.360 --> 29:37.560]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[29:37.560 --> 29:40.760]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[30:08.520 --> 30:38.480]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.

[30:56.920 --> 31:07.280]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it, others don't.
[31:07.280 --> 31:12.200]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[31:12.200 --> 31:17.320]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve
[31:17.320 --> 31:19.400]  growth, and rejuvenation.
[31:19.400 --> 31:24.720]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth
[31:24.720 --> 31:28.600]  factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[31:28.600 --> 31:34.200]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA force, just one of the key compounds.
[31:34.200 --> 31:41.760]  IOPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.
[31:41.760 --> 31:44.320]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[31:44.320 --> 31:50.160]  The ultimate value cutting-edge trailblazing game changer that also supports the InfoWars.

[32:01.200 --> 32:06.040]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around
[32:06.040 --> 32:10.720]  the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[32:10.720 --> 32:15.560]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy-powder, available through
[32:15.560 --> 32:20.720]  InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[32:20.720 --> 32:25.840]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[32:25.840 --> 32:30.960]  ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives, or worse.
[32:30.960 --> 32:36.080]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[32:36.080 --> 32:40.600]  Oxy-powder does not require time off work, and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[32:40.600 --> 32:46.880]  Instead, oxy-powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[32:46.880 --> 32:51.600]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[32:51.600 --> 33:04.160]  Go to infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com to get started with oxy-powder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[33:04.160 --> 33:30.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:30.640 --> 33:36.800]  I see a ton of calls coming in, but most of them aren't police, firefighters, EMTs, nurses,
[33:36.800 --> 33:46.280]  doctors, or U.S. military, hazmat, WMD, chem, bio, trained.
[33:46.280 --> 33:50.800]  That's who the phones are open for today, at least right now, because we have a guest
[33:50.800 --> 33:57.720]  coming on, Robert David Steele, ran major CIA operations overseas with the U.S. Army
[33:57.720 --> 34:03.560]  and other military groups, I mean, just not an armchair CIA analyst or something, but
[34:03.560 --> 34:06.720]  someone has actually been in it all over the world.
[34:06.720 --> 34:11.600]  He said two weeks before the first Ebola case showed up in the U.S. that his intel was they
[34:11.600 --> 34:15.240]  were going to have an Ebola false flag in the United States.
[34:15.240 --> 34:17.200]  We'll play that clip right now.
[34:17.200 --> 34:18.200]  Here it is.
[34:18.200 --> 34:19.200]  They will have another false flag.
[34:19.200 --> 34:24.160]  In fact, the false flag I'm hearing about is a simulated Ebola attack in which they
[34:24.160 --> 34:30.360]  actually use biochemical weapons that dissipate, but then they pretended it's Ebola and that
[34:30.360 --> 34:33.760]  it has been brought here by Saudi martyrs, okay?
[34:33.760 --> 34:36.960]  So no, we have not reached the end of the false flag line.
[34:36.960 --> 34:43.520]  However, what we have reached is, I did my first graduate thesis on predicting revolution.
[34:43.520 --> 34:46.080]  Full videos up on infowars.com.
[34:46.080 --> 34:52.440]  I want to hear from the medical workers because they're the people you notice that are getting
[34:52.440 --> 34:55.200]  from someone who was allowed to fly in from Africa.
[34:55.200 --> 34:58.920]  And to Rick Perry's credit, he's finally saying shut down the flights, like Jindal said three
[34:58.920 --> 35:03.080]  weeks ago and Boehner said a week ago and Rand Paul said three weeks ago.
[35:03.080 --> 35:08.160]  He's a medical doctor and Ted Cruz said three weeks ago now or two and a half weeks ago.
[35:08.160 --> 35:10.760]  Now, Rick Perry is saying it makes sense.
[35:10.760 --> 35:13.040]  It's common sense.
[35:13.040 --> 35:16.200]  The White House says there's no threat from these flights, but that's how it got here.
[35:16.200 --> 35:18.040]  And here's why people are panicking.
[35:18.040 --> 35:21.720]  You could say thousands die a year from the flu, but that happens all the time.
[35:21.720 --> 35:25.960]  The flu is a very viral airborne virus.
[35:25.960 --> 35:30.320]  So it infects millions, tens of millions, and then you get thousands that end up dying,
[35:30.320 --> 35:33.560]  mainly with compromised immune systems.
[35:33.560 --> 35:37.240]  One inflated estimates, 35,000, you've been hearing that forever.
[35:37.240 --> 35:41.200]  Most medical doctors I talked to and CDC people say it's more like 5,000.
[35:41.200 --> 35:46.680]  And that's people that have diabetes or had heart problems or already sick in the hospital.
[35:46.680 --> 35:49.760]  But still, it's a serious issue.
[35:49.760 --> 35:55.360]  The reason this is a big deal is that it kills 70% of people that are in an area that has
[35:55.360 --> 36:00.880]  good medical care, 90% if you're in Africa, 91%.
[36:00.880 --> 36:07.680]  I mean, you notice it killed this guy that had US treatment and they don't know if one
[36:07.680 --> 36:10.040]  of these nurses is going to make it.
[36:10.040 --> 36:14.640]  And you can believe they flew all over the place and there's always other flights, hundreds
[36:14.640 --> 36:18.440]  of flights coming in a day full of West Africans.
[36:18.440 --> 36:23.640]  You can believe, common sense tells you it's going to spread.
[36:23.640 --> 36:25.520]  And people don't see the border being controlled.
[36:25.520 --> 36:27.760]  That's been open since January, completely wide open.
[36:27.760 --> 36:31.080]  All these mystery viruses coming across the southern border.
[36:31.080 --> 36:34.880]  The sickest people in Latin America come in here on record to get free health care.
[36:34.880 --> 36:38.000]  You've got Obama letting West Africans fly in.
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.120]  You've got panic on cruise ships, panic everywhere.
[36:41.120 --> 36:46.360]  You've got 5,000 US military, it was 3,000, now 5,000, who don't even have hazmat suits.
[36:46.360 --> 36:52.920]  In the news today, this didn't like the flu where you get it and you throw up and sit
[36:52.920 --> 36:54.880]  on the toilet for a couple of days.
[36:54.880 --> 37:03.240]  This is your kid gets it, my kid gets it, 70%, 70%, I'm going to be putting them in
[37:03.240 --> 37:06.160]  the ground.
[37:06.160 --> 37:08.560]  That's what people are hopping mad.
[37:08.560 --> 37:12.840]  And who would have thought I'd been warning about this and then it pops up in Dallas.
[37:12.840 --> 37:16.800]  I mean, not fun.
[37:16.800 --> 37:21.120]  The last few weeks, all these ACL people down here from Dallas, just running around coughing
[37:21.120 --> 37:24.520]  and vomiting all the street drunk, I mean, who knows?
[37:24.520 --> 37:30.560]  It can spread for 70 days in Seaman, 21 days in the rest of the body.
[37:30.560 --> 37:33.880]  By the way, the big dirty secret is that Ebola is really sexually transmitted.
[37:33.880 --> 37:36.080]  That's one of the main ways you get it.
[37:36.080 --> 37:38.680]  It lives in men's testicles.
[37:38.680 --> 37:40.840]  That wasn't even in Reuters.
[37:40.840 --> 37:46.640]  So it can live in there at least 70 days and spread that way.
[37:46.640 --> 37:47.640]  So this is not fun.
[37:47.640 --> 37:51.760]  It's like AIDS that kills you over a decade and it's hard to get.
[37:51.760 --> 37:56.240]  This is Ebola and I keep telling you, oh, it's super hard to get.
[37:56.240 --> 37:57.240]  No, it's not.
[37:57.240 --> 38:04.280]  Two nurses got it from one guy and now those nurses with fevers and stuff were on airplanes.
[38:04.280 --> 38:06.600]  The CDC told the one nurse, oh, go ahead and fly.
[38:06.600 --> 38:08.200]  We don't care you were an Ebola nurse.
[38:08.200 --> 38:11.080]  We don't care you called and said, I have a fever, it's okay if I fly.
[38:11.080 --> 38:17.800]  Turns out she had Ebola.
[38:17.800 --> 38:19.080]  So that's why I'm concerned.
[38:19.080 --> 38:22.680]  I want to hear from you on this subject.
[38:22.680 --> 38:28.360]  Here's the toll-free number for police, medical workers, EMTs, military, because they're saying
[38:28.360 --> 38:35.560]  in singing in, military preps team for Ebola, Ebola response in the U.S., the U.S. military
[38:35.560 --> 38:39.080]  has a quick strike team equipped to provide direct treatment to Ebola patients out of
[38:39.080 --> 38:40.580]  the United States.
[38:40.580 --> 38:45.160]  Defense Department official told CNN's Barbara Starr today, the Pentagon spokesman later
[38:45.160 --> 38:47.560]  confirmed portions of the official information.
[38:47.560 --> 38:52.560]  Well, Obama announced these military SWAT teams last week, which is all for pure show.
[38:52.560 --> 38:58.400]  If you wanted to stop it, you'd shut down the borders and you would stop the flights
[38:58.400 --> 39:03.000]  like everybody else did months ago, including the African countries surrounding it.
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.320]  But they've got news articles out by the White House, they run Media Matters saying I'm a
[39:06.320 --> 39:10.360]  racist because I've set a control of the borders.
[39:10.360 --> 39:16.760]  There's Curt Nemos articles, just brokeninfowords.com, Pentagon prepares strike team for Ebola.
[39:16.760 --> 39:21.800]  And see, I'm not for tyranny locking people up when they have drug immune TB or resistant
[39:21.800 --> 39:25.800]  or this, but if you don't, then it spreads and then they lock everybody down.
[39:25.800 --> 39:26.800]  Don't you understand that?
[39:26.800 --> 39:27.800]  Oh, it's incredible.
[39:27.800 --> 39:32.680]  We're going to go to Jim and FEMA region six, Texas is part of that.
[39:32.680 --> 39:41.520]  We've got John, who's a chemical specialist and we've also got aircraft mechanic wants
[39:41.520 --> 39:42.520]  to comment.
[39:42.520 --> 39:47.520]  I'd like to hear from custodians that got to work on these airplanes that are striking
[39:47.520 --> 39:49.880]  because they're full of vomit and everything coming out of West Africa.
[39:49.880 --> 39:51.600]  Again, you can pull it up.
[39:51.600 --> 39:55.200]  People are flying and dying on airplanes and they don't even test them.
[39:55.200 --> 39:59.440]  They just say, oh, if they don't have Ebola, the man died of a vomiting fit flying into
[39:59.440 --> 40:05.000]  JFK Thursday night, but they said no Ebola without even doing a test.
[40:05.000 --> 40:06.760]  I mean, it looks like a cover up.
[40:06.760 --> 40:08.360]  Let's get to one call before we go to break.
[40:08.360 --> 40:10.200]  Jim, you say you're a medical worker.
[40:10.200 --> 40:13.480]  What's your take on this?
[40:13.480 --> 40:14.480]  Problem reaction solution.
[40:14.480 --> 40:20.720]  I don't want to get your take on this being a big huge placebo pill, a CIA side off false
[40:20.720 --> 40:23.840]  black drill to take more of our civil liberties.
[40:23.840 --> 40:31.640]  Well, that's what Steel, Robert David Steel, formerly with the CIA said two weeks before
[40:31.640 --> 40:33.840]  this guy even showed up in the news.
[40:33.840 --> 40:38.360]  Now, since then, he was back on one of my guest host, I think it was David Knight and
[40:38.360 --> 40:41.840]  said, well, he's not sure if this is that, but that's what he was quote hearing.
[40:41.840 --> 40:46.480]  We're going to talk to him coming up in the next hour and take your calls.
[40:46.480 --> 40:50.160]  But I think there's real Ebola in Africa.
[40:50.160 --> 40:51.160]  Something's killing everybody.
[40:51.160 --> 40:52.280]  Is it the vaccines?
[40:52.280 --> 40:56.440]  The major African newspapers with epidemiologists and virologists are saying this is a false
[40:56.440 --> 40:58.480]  flag three weeks ago.
[40:58.480 --> 41:03.200]  And the government has a history of putting stuff in vaccines and doing this.
[41:03.200 --> 41:06.280]  My grandmother got polio from the polio vaccine in the 50s.
[41:06.280 --> 41:07.280]  So could be.
[41:07.280 --> 41:09.280]  What do you think?
[41:09.280 --> 41:10.280]  Absolutely.
[41:10.280 --> 41:12.960]  This has everything to do with vaccinations.
[41:12.960 --> 41:16.720]  I don't believe that it has nothing to do with Ebola, but I think it has everything
[41:16.720 --> 41:22.080]  to do with mass vaccinations and it's the way to keep us down, to keep us in a fear
[41:22.080 --> 41:23.080]  state.
[41:23.080 --> 41:25.360]  That's why I believe it's a big, huge placebo pill.
[41:25.360 --> 41:29.360]  Well, it's kind of like Red Deer, as I said last week, would blow up oil well fires with
[41:29.360 --> 41:30.880]  a bigger explosion.
[41:30.880 --> 41:37.080]  You've got dozens and dozens of scandals, everything from Benghazi to a fast and furious
[41:37.080 --> 41:41.680]  to the IRS going after people, to the NSA, to our government funding al-Qaeda and changing
[41:41.680 --> 41:43.400]  the name to ISIS.
[41:43.400 --> 41:48.360]  And so you then you have this huge Ebola thing that even though it makes Obama look bad,
[41:48.360 --> 41:52.640]  it allows his buddies, this guy with Al Gore, used to run Al Gore's operations, are going
[41:52.640 --> 41:58.800]  to be able to control the hundreds of billions of dollars doled out on the fight Ebola fund.
[41:58.800 --> 42:03.000]  And then Obama skates off with pardons into the sunset.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.120]  I think you're really on to something.
[42:05.120 --> 42:08.240]  Well, you know, keep doing a good job.
[42:08.240 --> 42:11.720]  I'm going to keep taking the colloidal silver and the beyond Tangier tangerine.
[42:11.720 --> 42:15.240]  It's going to keep your immune system up anyway in case this isn't a false flag.
[42:15.240 --> 42:20.400]  But we have to remain diligent and, you know, keep moving forward.
[42:20.400 --> 42:21.840]  I'm glad you make that point.
[42:21.840 --> 42:24.160]  I am not in my gut.
[42:24.160 --> 42:31.240]  I am less worried about Ebola than I am about MRSA and all these antibiotic resistant bacteria
[42:31.240 --> 42:34.920]  and drug resistant viruses that are just killing people all over the place.
[42:34.920 --> 42:39.520]  That's why I'm trying to boost my body's natural defenses with the entire info wars

[43:31.240 --> 43:34.880]  The government's department of homeland security is buying up loads of ammo.

[48:17.200 --> 48:22.680]  we'll talk about Ebola vector spreading we have an aircraft mechanic wants to comment
[48:22.680 --> 48:26.240]  yeah i'd really love to hear people that work in the aircraft industry having to be around
[48:26.240 --> 48:30.720]  this stuff coming in from west africa the vomit everywhere all the guy died vomiting
[48:30.720 --> 48:35.160]  everything's fine i was reading the new york post was like minutes after they landed they
[48:35.160 --> 48:41.960]  declared it was not a bola with no test that that really freaks me out there's no danger
[48:41.960 --> 48:48.120]  this nurse that had a bola that flew on four or five aircraft flights with a fever gave
[48:48.120 --> 48:56.280]  it to anybody bull baloney bravo seara again i want people to wake up to this and take
[48:56.280 --> 49:01.240]  action now before it starts spreading the feds are going to start taking action once
[49:01.240 --> 49:08.520]  it's out of control as a power grab you can bet your bottom dollar on that but now the
[49:08.520 --> 49:12.800]  pentagon is prepared its quote strike team for Ebola curtain mo has an article on it
[49:12.800 --> 49:20.080]  in full wars dot com right now let's go to spiro and then to john spiro you say you're
[49:20.080 --> 49:25.640]  an aircraft mechanic are you talking to other folks that are having to clean up these planes
[49:25.640 --> 49:29.360]  i know for three weeks in new york and other areas where folks are coming in from africa
[49:29.360 --> 49:34.400]  mainly vomiting everywhere they don't want to clean up vomit from places hit with Ebola
[49:34.400 --> 49:38.240]  sounds like their conspiracy theorists i think they should get some chips and eat it like
[49:38.240 --> 49:44.640]  dip i mean obama said there's nothing to worry about right well you know i tell you what
[49:44.640 --> 49:49.080]  it's uh it's really concerning uh to me and a lot of people i work with have been in the
[49:49.080 --> 49:53.680]  industry for more than 10 years now why it only kills 70 percent of people to get it
[49:53.680 --> 49:58.440]  what are you worried about dying for obama played golf for four hours last night before
[49:58.440 --> 50:02.640]  having a 10 minute meeting on Ebola and his Ebola's are didn't show up for it what's wrong
[50:02.640 --> 50:09.600]  with that how about obama fly with all these Ebola patients huh well absolutely all right
[50:09.600 --> 50:13.360]  if there's no big deal well he says that he hugs and kisses the nurse which totally gives
[50:13.360 --> 50:18.120]  you a false sense to get you know and by the way if you have a business you didn't build
[50:18.120 --> 50:25.960]  it either do you believe any of that no not at all yeah exactly you know the uh i i work
[50:25.960 --> 50:33.360]  for um i'm a contractor and uh we do third party maintenance for major domestic airline
[50:33.360 --> 50:37.080]  here and uh you know so the the facility i work at issued a memo and where it states
[50:37.080 --> 50:41.400]  uh that they they don't perceive the Ebola to be any kind of a threat to the employees
[50:41.400 --> 50:47.960]  or contractors like that they know they haven't uh issued any any kind of you know meetings
[50:47.960 --> 50:53.400]  or any kind of extra gear or anything you know they have these uh uh these UV lights
[50:53.400 --> 50:58.280]  that that say that they can kill the virus within uh 10 minutes you know well that's
[50:58.280 --> 51:04.200]  actually true that's actually true are they running the UV lights for the planes no we
[51:04.200 --> 51:09.160]  don't have them we need them that's what i'm saying oh got it yeah measures in place uh
[51:09.160 --> 51:12.720]  you know and then the world health organization came out and said that that one guy you were
[51:12.720 --> 51:17.720]  speaking about died on the flight um they don't know not abola they they were kind of
[51:17.720 --> 51:23.360]  alarmed by how how can you come to that conclusion so quickly yeah he's coming from nigeri died
[51:23.360 --> 51:28.720]  vomiting and everything's fine don't be worried you know and i see people around here at work
[51:28.720 --> 51:33.600]  but that don't you know think to wear just simple things like latex gloves when they're
[51:33.600 --> 51:36.960]  over there messing with the seats or whatever and i go over there and i'm saying you know
[51:36.960 --> 51:40.400]  kind of halfway holding my breath on my way over there but i mean i'm like you know hey
[51:40.400 --> 51:44.840]  uh maybe you should wear some gloves or a mask or something you know well you know they're
[51:44.840 --> 51:49.240]  in the news saying people are canceling flights it's already having economy and fear right
[51:49.240 --> 51:53.680]  now it hasn't spread massively so from the numbers i've seen it's not that big an issue
[51:53.680 --> 51:59.240]  for the casual flyer but if you're cleaning airplanes in new york or other east coast
[51:59.240 --> 52:04.400]  places full of less avocates coming in and there's vomit and stuff absolutely that's
[52:04.400 --> 52:09.880]  a major threat god bless you i appreciate your call i mean if you work at a major hospital
[52:09.880 --> 52:16.440]  if you are a cop having to go once quarantining starts or you're an emt i mean whoa look it's
[52:16.440 --> 52:21.360]  nurses that are getting it anybody that comes in contact with these people in a first responder
[52:21.360 --> 52:26.440]  role is the number one group in danger and they're not telling those people they're in
[52:26.440 --> 52:32.160]  danger and that's going to cause a bigger loss in confidence when the Ebola starts spreading
[52:32.160 --> 52:35.960]  and i say when it's already spreading i believe it's going to start spreading i don't know
[52:35.960 --> 52:40.360]  how bad it's going to get but clearly they're covering something up the intellectual data
[52:40.360 --> 52:46.400]  shows it the geopolitical data shows it and my gut screams it we'll see what happens maybe
[52:46.400 --> 52:50.760]  if we put enough attention on this have a big enough strike call enough attention to
[52:50.760 --> 52:56.120]  it they may put measures in place that mitigate it could be a false flag with a stimulant
[52:56.120 --> 52:59.640]  to create a bunch of fear and sell the vaccine they're coming out with in three months i
[52:59.640 --> 53:05.120]  don't know i just know this the default positions are being ignored john and montana what's
[53:05.120 --> 53:13.600]  your take on this yeah hi alex um my my whole uh thing here is with the disease stacking
[53:13.600 --> 53:18.320]  they got going on through the southwest border they got a whole bunch of illegal aliens coming
[53:18.320 --> 53:25.600]  out and a bunch of weird viruses killing people absolutely absolutely and with some of those
[53:25.600 --> 53:32.480]  is included in the symptoms is coughing sneezing scabies will eat your skin which creates the
[53:32.480 --> 53:37.760]  hysteria where everybody thinks someone with with the flu has Ebola so they're saying get
[53:37.760 --> 53:43.520]  your flu shot and we won't quarantine you but the flu shots never been been guessed properly
[53:43.520 --> 53:48.120]  to stop the flu it's a total hoax so what's going to happen is total hysteria this winter
[53:48.120 --> 53:56.280]  yeah and people will start coughing with they do have Ebola and people will become complacent
[53:56.280 --> 54:02.240]  and that's when i can see the disease spreading um well and truly uh into that's the point
[54:02.240 --> 54:07.680]  i hadn't thought of the flu because Ebola has flu life symptoms the first few weeks will
[54:07.680 --> 54:14.440]  be the perfect cover for Ebola to spread absolutely and with the people with uh scabies and everything
[54:14.440 --> 54:19.040]  else they're going to have open wounds on them um other people are going to just assume
[54:19.040 --> 54:24.680]  that they've got the flu and as far as uh vector spreading goes these people all throughout
[54:24.680 --> 54:28.960]  the southwest border and these people that have Ebola they're going to go ahead and meet
[54:28.960 --> 54:33.200]  and they're going to they're going to random locations these illegal aliens and that's
[54:33.200 --> 54:37.360]  exactly how you want to do it you don't want to have it uh to where it's in a predictable
[54:37.360 --> 54:42.640]  line that's right and the head of south com general kelly says it'll probably go to south
[54:42.640 --> 54:47.520]  america and cause a huge flood across the border so why isn't obama beefing up the border
[54:47.520 --> 54:51.960]  again i want it on record that when this gets out of control if it does who allowed it to
[54:51.960 --> 54:58.280]  happen and hopefully if enough people complain about this the system may back off great points
[54:58.280 --> 55:04.600]  thank you so much uh we got a lot of callers here chris dr chuck and many others uh dr
[55:04.600 --> 55:08.760]  chuck who's a medical worker wants to comment on this from south carolina then we'll talk
[55:08.760 --> 55:15.760]  to frank and others go ahead hey alex how you doing today uh just hoping we can try to
[55:15.760 --> 55:20.120]  figure out what's going on what do you think's happening absolutely buddy let me uh let me
[55:20.120 --> 55:26.000]  just first precious that uh i i truly believe that this is all about the the the concept
[55:26.000 --> 55:32.560]  of being able to uh provide the vaccine which is then going to get everybody sick ultimately
[55:32.560 --> 55:40.400]  so i i understand that my wife is also in um a more uh confined healthcare job that she
[55:40.400 --> 55:47.520]  does and she works for hca which is a rather large hospital organization here in america
[55:47.520 --> 55:54.320]  and to give you some idea of who supports the cdc and funds them let me just list off this
[55:54.320 --> 56:01.040]  from a bulletin that was put out a few days ago by hca that was not for external distribution
[56:01.040 --> 56:08.160]  let me read it to you the cdc foundation which funds the cdc operation has received generous
[56:08.160 --> 56:14.400]  funding from a number of donors such as the paul g allen foundation the bill and melinda
[56:14.400 --> 56:25.280]  gates foundation exxon mobile robert wood johnson foundation the william and florida
[56:25.280 --> 56:30.000]  folks by the way for those that don't know these are all on record eugenicist all vaccine
[56:30.000 --> 56:35.600]  front company people all global government promoters the same people you hear that underwrite
[56:35.600 --> 56:42.480]  mpr so amazing yeah that's who's funding this as they're about to come out with a vaccine
[56:42.480 --> 56:48.080]  with god knows what in it wow that's powerful send me that memo can you scan that or send that to

[56:54.320 --> 57:04.480]  what one of the other cdc foundation donors is the hca hospital foundation which has been certified
[57:04.480 --> 57:10.480]  as one of the bold hospitals for you to go to in downtown at dusk oh yeah and they put this known
[57:10.480 --> 57:16.480]  uh al gore employee as the new czar no medical training no medical background because what he

[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:41.440]  on what's happening what do you think's going on well i don't know exactly what's going on
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:46.960]  with the government but i just want to let people know now this is information that i've received
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:53.520]  and it's a little might be a little outdated but what people need to know about abola is that
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:01:00.880]  as long as you don't have any open source in your skin and you don't get the uh a contaminated
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:07.440]  substance in your mouth your nose or your eyes generally you're protected now when it comes
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:14.720]  to the two nurses that were working on uh mr duncan in down in dalis what i surmise what happened
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:21.760]  and how they got infected is in the late stages of the virus your internal your internal organs
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:30.240]  are liquefying and what happened with him is his eoli the the air sacs in your lungs uh we're bursting
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:37.120]  and building with uh fluids similar to pneumonia and when you're coughing and uh you're going to be
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:44.640]  expelling those heavy droplets out into the air into a three to five foot radius and so if they
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:50.560]  had any charts any pens anything like that but they sat down on a hard surface that they didn't
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:57.120]  be decontaminate after they took off and they they down dressed they got out i agree plus they
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:02.400]  told to put tape around their necks they could pull some skin off do that my my point is this i'm
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:08.640]  no virologist but it used to hit like 36 people and they would maybe a national news story or world
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:14.560]  story now it's got thousands it it it's mutated it it lives in the body longer it's cure it's
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:20.560]  clearly getting stronger so what you're going off of is the old abola we don't know yet what's
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:26.480]  happening on this new one but it's certainly radically different and that that's my point exactly is
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:32.960]  with uh as you were commenting on earlier how many uh infections they they estimate that
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:39.520]  after every uh third to fourth generation of infection so you got one person spread to two
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:43.840]  people two people spread it to four people four people spread it to eight people by the time
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.960]  you're getting to that eight people that are infected the view the virus is is going to mutate
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:53.680]  by that fourth generation of infection and with all these millions of people that are getting in
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:59.200]  africa they believe it may go airborne very soon and that's the 64 trillion dollar issue thank you

[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:13.520]  take on this jennifer hey alex huge supporter of your everything all your thank you thank you
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:21.360]  um mine is about the hypocritical my question is maybe to you or the audience um we all have
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.240]  to take an oath just like the person that has to take an oath just like yeah do no harm hypocritees
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:33.360]  yes we know that oath probably doesn't mean much to them but this is if people died um because of
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:39.120]  that is and my question i don't really know how to phrase this question without making it too confusing
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:46.320]  but how far um what does that a hypocritic oath means is that you know we put ourselves in jeopardy
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:52.800]  as paramedics as that of my well you've got a triage it and and so you contain the african
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:58.000]  countries you try to give them aid but you don't let it spread and the hypocritic oath says you
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.600]  don't let a contagion spread that's that's first off they've inverted it to say bring all the Ebola
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:08.720]  patients here it's like joe bigs went to ut and 17 or 30 people said bring a bola here how's it you
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.600]  know basically get a bowl and approve your liberal so that's kind of an inverted hypocritic oath
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:19.520]  you contain it you help those as much as you can but it's a triage you don't spread it to show that
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:27.200]  you're you know liberal oh yeah i know that i mean we're we take an oath to protect and defend
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:32.480]  the weak and sick right just like the person who takes the oath but you know maybe the oath
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:36.880]  doesn't mean something but i know it we well exactly but but then you take another oath to
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:42.960]  this country into your family and family first well god first and family then the country
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:47.040]  show what they need to be doing is protecting our country first because if they won't protect this
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.880]  country they won't protect anything the truth is the globalists hate this country and are shutting
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:56.400]  down our power systems and raising our taxes and the globalists that have become powerful off this

[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.240]  bola pages that's in the news frank in new york retired medical worker wants to talk about a
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:32.560]  bola gabe says it's gonna get a lot worse we've got pam in texas she's cancelled her tickets with
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:38.400]  american airlines or united airlines and we're joined for this hour we'll be taking calls with him
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:47.040]  by robert david steele he's a former marine cik officer us spy hacker ceo he's probably better
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:52.800]  known as being a hacker and best-selling author ceo of open source solutions network ink and 2012
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:58.080]  candidate for a form party presidential nomination currently ceo of earth intelligence network and
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:03.920]  accredited educational nonprofit he's known for his advocacy of open source intelligence teaching
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:10.000]  7500 mid-career officers from across 66 governments and today the foremost proponent of applied
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.520]  collective intelligence which integrates holistic analytics true cost economics and open source
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:20.240]  everything the ladder in engineering and information management approach that is affordable
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:26.880]  and we're unscalable his most recent book is the open source everything manifesto
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:37.600]  transparency truth and trust big bat usa.org just one of his website he's got pi beta iota.net
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:44.320]  as well all linked up on info wars.com now back in september he shed here and i played it last
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:49.120]  hours won't play it again that the word he was getting was a false flag within a bolus simulant
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:57.600]  to basically create a political smoke screen to block out a political catalyst of true change in
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:04.160]  this country now he i was gone with a family issue david niner reviewed him a few weeks ago and
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:09.440]  he said well basically i'll let him say what he thinks about what's currently happening
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:15.120]  but there's so much to go over from what i'm seeing the default positions are being turned off a
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:21.200]  bolus being allowed to come in and spread i think it's the end of the world no but it's certainly
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:28.720]  an example of how they are trying to undermine this country to create a policy of dumbed down
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.760]  poor people who are so busy trying to find their next meal they can't be politically involved and
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.920]  again we have a lot of phone calls you're able to talk to mr. steele here today and bring up your
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:43.360]  points on a bola the big question is what's happening while we're looking at a bola we'll
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:46.640]  discuss that as well robert great to have you here with us
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.920]  and he may not be getting audio from me on his skype robert can you hear me
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:02.960]  yeah we lost audio to him reconnect skype so wonderful technology but at the same time
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:12.960]  time but at the same time it does have its bumps in it so we'll get his take on all of that coming
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.880]  up as soon as we get him on by the way if you're a radio listener and you hear me say play this
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:25.520]  clip look at this article we reach millions a day with video streams we reach tens of millions
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:31.600]  a week on youtube and other platforms so it's a syndicated radio show on 170 plus stations but
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:38.240]  it's also really a tv show you can all find the free feed at info wars dot com forward slash show
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:43.440]  be sure and pay that forward take that link send it out to others tell folks about the national
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:49.120]  strike who draw attention to the inaction on a bola and so much more because clearly him
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:56.000]  hiring a non-medical doctor no bola background a guy that runs fake energy deals for al gore
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:05.280]  or as the new czar shows me it's nothing but a big profit taking operation a big insider operation
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:10.960]  all right we do have mr. steel able to hear us thank you robert david steel a big bat usa
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:16.640]  dot org for joining us you heard my question you've got the floor you made that prediction
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:22.560]  where you said this is what i'm hearing what do you have to say now what do you think's going on
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:28.960]  what are your sources telling you well the good news is that instead of a false flag what we're
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:39.200]  dealing with is is blatant malfeasance by cdc and the nih and and this uh this doctor gucci at
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:46.080]  nih should be fired i certainly agree with you the client is not a serious appointee no czar ever is
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:52.640]  um bottom line here is the u.s. government is not seeing to the best interest of the american public
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:02.640]  i mean clearly it's it's criminal neglect anyway you slice it but tell us the intel
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:07.360]  you were getting two weeks before this guy is even in the news and three weeks before he dies
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:14.080]  or four weeks saying i'm hearing about a stimulant abola uh to be brought in as a false flag and
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:19.760]  there could be a national strike over it i mean that's an amazing statement i mean what what were
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:26.720]  you hearing at the time what i was hearing was that there was a very there was first off there
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:32.480]  was complete confidence that abola would not reach the united states uh but that it could be
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:39.440]  introduced in the united states as a means of forcing the issue of passing a draconian quarantine
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:46.000]  law that would then be abused in the future uh what i think we have now is real abola showing up
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:52.800]  because of the hubris because of the ignorance because of the irresponsibility of the cdc and the
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:59.840]  white house uh the white house knew 10 months ago this was an issue in 2004 brints gocroft and
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.960]  others told the white house that infectious disease was the number two high-level threat to
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:12.320]  national security after poverty um so now i think reality has trumped false flag now it's
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:18.880]  still a threat and the martyrs from saudi arabia are still a threat but the u.s government has become
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:25.040]  more of a threat than false flag if that makes sense to you no i get it who needs saudi arabian
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:30.080]  martyrs with abola uh that are carrying in on purpose and vectoring it when you've got a government
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:35.280]  that just gives visas to people that are clearly sick in countries that are collapsing i mean that's
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:41.200]  that's just i i mean i get an etness i know that goes on but the level of an etness is like batting
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:47.360]  a thousand how are they so perfectly inept yeah i think part of the reason and i've thought about
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:53.040]  this for a long time part of the reason is that the u.s government has never been held accountable
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:59.760]  for actually looking out for the public interest um and what we have now is a perfect storm abola
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:06.640]  could be an excellent motive it could be a wake-up call for the american public the goodhearted
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:12.800]  common sense american public the government is not serving our needs maybe it is time for general
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:18.800]  strike it's just crazy that you brought that up a month plus ago and then it just clicked for me
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:23.840]  friday we should have a national strike just pointing out why are the borders open why are
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:29.760]  you allowing flights why are you issuing these visas uh i mean this could be the catalyst a lot of
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:34.160]  people that are smart like yourself are saying the same thing michael savage thinks that they've
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:40.000]  really miscalculated and this is an etness well you know i used to say that when given a choice
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.720]  between incompetence and conspiracy always go with uh incompetence and then 9 11 happened and of
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:53.920]  course i've seen so many false flag conspiracies since then 9 11 uh the school uh in connecticut
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:15:04.960]  sandy was bombing um so my real concern here is um my real concern here is that um what we have is
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:13.680]  a perfect storm in which incompetence has trumped false flag but at the same time um i'm sorry i've
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:17.440]  got something going on here to the side that should not have been allowed to happen let me
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:23.360]  just turn it off i know that is these damn devices and phone calls yeah no forgive me alex because
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:27.680]  it's an honor to be on your show and i think you do extremely important we totally get phones and
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:34.480]  stuff ringing bro okay that's how it is so so i think cdc basically cdc has been incompetent the
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:40.240]  national institute of health has been incompetent the lead guy for the national institute of health
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:48.000]  is actually a known incompetent from the aids hiv uh time frame uh yeah that's what savage said he
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.240]  pointed out he's the guy that looked at spread stay there i'm gonna break down as an analyst but a

[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:21.280]  jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcm radio
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:35.120]  network nobody nobody on friday i launched a national strike idea because i was playing a clip of
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:43.040]  robert david steel of big bat usa dot org or high beta iota dot net incredible news sites
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:48.400]  with all his analysts on there and i was one wait a minute he predicted the abola
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:53.520]  and then he said there should be a strike against it let's have a strike so that's why i said let's
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:58.080]  get him on sunday i appreciate him graciously coming on on his sunday but this affects us all
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:04.240]  and then i said let's have a petition we've had those before not that the white house responds but
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:10.480]  it becomes a bully pulpit when we get half a million sign signatures of the port pierce morgan
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:14.320]  for his red coat activities the citizen has free speech not some foreigner
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:22.160]  here well the white house for the first time ever removed our petition to ban west african
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:28.720]  flights or cease issuing visas to west africans until the pandemic is abated which the surrounding
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:34.400]  african countries and hundreds of other countries have done two months ago so kit daniels is writing
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:38.720]  a story about that right now but robert david steel i'm going to give you the floor during this
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:43.520]  segment come back with calls with you but they are really scared of this strike idea because that
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:50.880]  was also in the petition and they're really upset about any type of response don't they know they're
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:55.120]  going to get the blame because i agree with you now this is leaning towards incompetence because
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:02.400]  it's blowing up in their face so bad that's more scary than them false flagging and being in control
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:08.400]  it's so scary to think the people running things and starting war with russia and funding al-qaeda
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:14.960]  and isis are this inept and obama plays golf like four hours a day and doesn't even have meetings with
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:20.480]  his jar uh give me your take on this you've got the floor what do you think this is distracting
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:26.080]  from as well go ahead alex let me say that one of the reasons obama plays golf so much is because
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:32.640]  he realizes he's not actually president yeah uh ever since jfk was was assassinated by elements
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:38.320]  of his own government uh in collaboration with wall street new york energy and the bush family
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:45.760]  um no president has actually been president and obama was given the choice between gold or led
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:51.440]  a very early on in his presidency and he's been a deer in the headlights ever since so he's not
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:58.560]  actually running the government uh now he's just embarrassed um i think that one of the problems
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:03.920]  we have is that obola is making it clear to the american people that the u.s government lies to
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:10.080]  them about everything and or even worse the u.s government doesn't actually know the truth about
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:18.640]  anything so obola for me is the perfect storm it's it's the the absolute proof needed to the american
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:25.440]  public the congress the executive the supreme court the intelligence community none of them are worth
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:31.440]  a bucket of warm spit in terms of taking care of the public interest so i love your idea of a general
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:40.560]  strike um i love your idea of bringing pressure to bear uh your idea no no no i have to give you
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:46.880]  credit i was more thinking i wasn't thinking as much about this as you have uh but the bottom line
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:52.480]  is that i think the american public should be asking some tough questions before the election
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:59.600]  i'm almost certain that the democrats will lose the senate um and the republicans will put us in
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:05.440]  the gridlock the question for me is is there a learning moment is there something we can do
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:10.800]  to occupy the home offices of every serving senator and every serving representative
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:16.880]  and require them for example to support electoral reform which would put the public back into the
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:22.960]  public enterprise um so i throw it back to you alex what do you think we should do next well
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:28.720]  number one they're bringing obola patients you know into regular hospitals and i wouldn't just
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:34.800]  read the cdc standard default was a set of special facilities which are now starting to do i just i'm
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:40.800]  just trying to understand actually who's running the government and and because now it looks like
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:46.320]  a bunch of special interest in there stealing silverware off the deck of the titanic what do you
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:55.520]  think this is distracting from i that's that's a great question um it's actually not distracting
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:25:02.080]  from as much as it's it's highlighting the fact that the u.s government is out of control um i mean
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:08.720]  let's take one specific example dr fauci at the net at the national institute of health this guy is
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:16.320]  an idiot uh he has been shown before to be malfeasant and completely wrong on hiv and aids
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:24.560]  he's been completely wrong on obola and to take one very specific example it was the cdc that was
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:31.520]  at fault for the nurses uh being infected because the cdc was saying that the n95 mask was good
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:38.320]  enough and they didn't need to cover up their skin in fact the n95 mask is good for 0.3 microns
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:46.720]  and obola i am told by one of our analysts is a 0.08 micron we're also finding that obola has
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:52.320]  gone airborne among animals that obola does survive outside the host under certain conditions
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:59.440]  particularly cold conditions um bottom line here is that cdc has no clue and it is doing what most
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:06.240]  lawyers do which is when they don't know the answer they lie uh and i think that this is a
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:15.200]  chance for america to understand the u.s government is not helping well you're right that the obola
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:21.600]  virus is a lot smaller than that mask that's been confirmed and i just wonder how they're this in app
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:26.160]  because i can go read their own set standards that were written by smart people that makes
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:30.880]  sense and that have contained this before other african countries are doing that they're containing
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:37.200]  it why do we have to be the country that's the dumping ground for people fleeing who have obola
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:44.080]  i just don't get it well we're we're also the country that's the dumping ground for baby pacifiers
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:50.160]  and and every other form of good that the europeans have forbidden because it contains too many toxins
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:55.520]  and the reason we're the dumping ground is because we have a government that makes decisions on who
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:00.000]  pays to be heard not on what's in the public no that's right that's right china executes people
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.320]  for melamine and milk no one the the fda came out and said melamine's not bad doesn't matter it
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:12.000]  causes kidney failure and babies just it's okay it was in the washington post absolutely right
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.280]  and citizens united was was five supreme court justices that were bought and paid for by the
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:22.640]  u.s chamber of commerce and justice powell it took 25 years to subvert the supreme court but
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:28.880]  they finally got it done and the american people sit by apathetically while their government betrays
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:34.960]  the public interest so obola even though it's caught everybody's attention is nothing more than a
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:41.360]  manifestation of what we've allowed the government to get away with on everything well i want to come
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:46.400]  back and and just wildcard ask you what are some of the other big things you're looking at right now
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:50.320]  i go to your side all the time and just all the amazing things are being discussed there
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:54.080]  what are some of the other big balls in the air that you're focused on right now and then we'll
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:59.120]  take some phone calls all right well one of the things i'm wondering is if jim webb will get away
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:05.600]  from being hillary like and actually run as a coalition president we'll talk about that what
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:10.320]  do you think about the situation with russia and ukraine who's winning that i think russia will
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:17.760]  inevitably win because the ukraine is based on russia on speaking russia on russian nationals
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:23.360]  that is a war that the united states started to break up the forming alliance between germany
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:31.200]  and russia the united states is losing on all fronts but they are having some economic effect
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:35.920]  on the russians but the russians didn't start it so we lose the moral high ground i had a famous spy
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:41.200]  on just last week he said well there is no right or wrong in geopolitics and right there
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:45.200]  is the disconnect i mean he just said there is no right or wrong well where the hell are you
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:49.920]  no the moral high ground matters more on that when we come back yeah we're going to come back
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:55.840]  and talk about that straight ahead with robert david steel pie beta iota net i'm alex jones

[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:23.600]  countries to do well but there's a corporate zombie view a crony capitalist view that they
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:29.920]  admit in writing books where they want everybody else to be shut down by government and regulations
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:36.800]  but only they are exempt to operate call it fascism crony capitalism whatever it is they've
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:44.720]  got to know that karmically they'll never get away with enslaving everyone so they can be
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:50.880]  in control of a pile of skulls i i i really don't understand the ruling class and what they're doing
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:56.880]  am i wrong in that analysis or can you expand on i mean where's the world going well alex i think
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:04.000]  you're right but the world has changed the the elites the one percent have been focused for
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.680]  the last 50 years on creating governments that are 100 corrupt that do exactly what they're
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:15.520]  told to do by by the bankers and the elites and and it's true the public and what has happened
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:20.640]  now is that they've realized that they're killing the golden goose and it's not just the banks the
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:26.320]  corporations are now starting to realize some of the corporations that minimum wages creates
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:32.320]  serfs that can't buy their products this is something henry ford knew long ago the good news
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:38.000]  the big news is that the elites have broken ranks uh lady lin roth child who it turns
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.800]  out comes from new jersey she just married a knight in england has held a conference on
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:48.400]  inclusive capitalism the mars family is pressing on with something they've been doing for 50 years
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:54.000]  which is mutuality economics and we have our black sheep billionaires now on the west coast
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.040]  and what is happening is there is a segment of the elites that's starting to realize
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:07.040]  that everything they've been doing has been toxic for their future generations so i think
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:12.800]  there's actually good news on the horizon well i agree with you because over the years a lot of
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:17.120]  elites live in awesome and i've been in la new york i mean i've met with really famous people
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:21.760]  really powerful people and they're more awake than the general public and they're freaked out
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.080]  and don't like what's happening with their kids and grandkids and then there's a disconnect then
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:30.720]  how if you're running the world how is it this bad and they go look there's a lot of really
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:36.560]  dark people at a core group who want everything and who want to basically wreck the whole system
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:43.440]  to ensure they get control of the future and so what you're saying is true there is a major
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:51.040]  split in the ranks of the elite yeah and and and our public education is is what makes the
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:56.160]  difference i mean we've been dumbed down and drugged up for a long time but what i see happening
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:04.640]  now is the public is is waking up and your listeners are in the vanguard i really believe
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:10.000]  that the pressure can now be brought on congress and frankly these two weeks before the election
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:18.320]  in november are prime time for us taking the government back i want to go to some phone
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:24.240]  calls and get their take in the year response to it but what about a year and a half ago our
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:30.560]  own military saying we're not going to support bombing Assad for al-qaeda and then them trying
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:36.080]  to change the name to isis and confuse the public and turkeys bombing the Kurds as they beg for help
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:42.080]  against isis that's blowing up in their face i mean there's just so much good news it's the best
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:48.240]  of times worst of times like tale of two cities though it is and the military is still conflicted
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:54.000]  i mean the us government is afraid of its veterans because the veterans have paid the supreme sacrifice
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.800]  they have done their job they've come home their dissolution they know they've been lied to and
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:04.640]  they're armed and dangerous you got a bunch of cowardly corporate lawyers that love the military
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:15.360]  enforcing their edicts but but are scared of them yes what i see happening here is the veterans the
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:20.880]  young college kids the older guys like myself that are unemployed but want to work uh and the
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:26.480]  soccer moms i see us all coming together but what we're missing what we're missing is a catalyst
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:31.760]  abola is an excellent precipitant for the public coming together but we're still missing some kind
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:37.200]  of catalyst that actually brings us together in a manner much more effective than occupy with
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:41.760]  its waggling fingers and that's something like a woman torturing herself on the on the in front
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:46.800]  of the white house of the capital alex i expected you to set that up after i mentioned it the first
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:52.400]  time we haven't found the volunteer yet and we better watch it somebody doesn't blame on us we
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.080]  hope that doesn't happen i mean is there something other than that that's a precipitate that isn't
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:03.360]  so horrid i or the tree of liberty's got to be watered i'm not sure i'm not sure i certainly
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:09.680]  believe in non-violence i i really would love to see an occupation of the home offices of every
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:16.640]  senator and representative for the next two weeks and i would like to see them forced to sign a
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:22.000]  pledge to pass the electoral reform act that reopens the elections to all of us not just the
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  two-party tyranny that for me would be a good start and i agree that obola is not a major
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.120]  threat to the country but the incompetence of the government is so i'm sure it's an indicator
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:38.000]  it's an indicator of how out of control they are yes and electoral reform is how we restore the
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.800]  integrity of the u.s. government that's the one thing we should all be able to agree sure i just
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:47.120]  don't know if you get folks excited about that you know i agree it's it's key they may get excited
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:53.120]  enough to go storm peacefully the offices of senators and congresspeople to point out that
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:58.320]  there's a stand-down going on with a strike the articles on info wars dot com stop a bullet strike
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:03.120]  hashtag national strike to force obama to block west african flights let's go to one call before
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:07.280]  we go to break let's talk to frank in new york you're on the air with our guest robert david
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:14.160]  steele go ahead good evening how are you good go ahead um basically i just want to say something
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:19.040]  right now um this anichrist president we have i think he's really falling over some shame himself
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:24.080]  basically because how can you allow people to come to this country knowing they have Ebola
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:31.840]  it just imperils me to know when i'm very pissed off about this well i think i think what steel
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:37.760]  said is true obama knows he's a complete puppet but when you actually don't empower government
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:42.720]  people to have any power and it's all bureaucracy and all corporate interest then it begins to
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:48.160]  manifest itself and then the whole illusion implodes well let me let me let me tar and
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:55.200]  feather john carrey our secretary of state um john carrey gave up his integrity long ago
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:02.320]  but one of the one of the things he did that i consider treason was burying the iran contra
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:09.680]  investigation oh yeah john carrey ignored letters from gary hart and from pilots plumley and many
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:16.080]  others and he buried that investigation because he was asked to bury it by the two-party tyranny
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:22.720]  so from where i said john carrey has no business being secretary of state and he is in fact a
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:30.640]  primary um reason why we are not acting responsibly for instance we should have hospital ships off of
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:38.640]  the coast of west africa sure we should have the 30 minute test mandated for anyone coming through um
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:43.440]  through europe from west africa before they get on a plane just like homeland security
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:48.400]  can check everybody that gets on a plane before the plane takes off there's no reason why we can't
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:53.920]  do well exactly grabbing my testicles is pointless checking me for a bowl of i'm coming from an
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:59.600]  Ebola country is totally reasonable no one would complain about that but the key thing alex is there's
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:05.520]  a test that takes 30 minutes it can be done at the airport so you get there early it's a test
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:10.640]  that exists that the u.s. government is not requiring there you go we're going to go right
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:15.680]  and come back and go to some final calls uh michael and daryl and gabe and pam and others
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:21.600]  again you've got two websites and they're both very interesting tell us the difference between
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:28.240]  the two different sites well the the big bad usa.org is from my my very short presidential campaign
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:32.560]  and it's where all the ideas are that i hope someone like jim webb will actually pay attention
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:38.400]  and anyone who does not look at a coalition government electoral reform and so forth is
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:43.280]  not going to get elected president i'll tell you about the other one next time well absolutely
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:49.760]  because the news sites the one i really like will be right back folks final segments straight ahead
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:54.960]  as we try to talk about real issues this is not dumb down radio not dumb down tv we talk about
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:59.920]  real issues here not a bunch of regurgitated corporate socialist propaganda

[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:03.760]  let's talk to michelle who wants to comment on hospitals she says are volunteering to take
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:12.800]  Ebola patients i've seen that in the news as well go ahead hi alex um yeah we have some hospitals
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:22.960]  here um columbia uh charleston and greenville um they are all offering uh
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:34.240]  ebola health basically um maybe they don't have the negative pressure rooms that are required
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:44.000]  so i don't know i don't know what i mean that's why i'm freaking out i'm no medical doctor but
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:49.120]  they had all these facilities with these pressurized rooms and bio shield and hundreds of billions
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:56.160]  spent the last 15 years mr steel that's my big issue it's not just incompetence at some level
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:01.120]  why would they send Ebola patients why do they have people loading the Ebola patient nurse uh
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:06.720]  last week on a plane not wearing hazmat suits what's going on why was she why was she on a
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:14.800]  commercial plane to begin with why wasn't she on a special flight um it really is quite astonishing
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:23.840]  i think the public has a right to be very very angry um cdc and nih are not telling the truth
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:28.400]  in part because they don't actually know what the truth is just like the president's so-called
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:35.600]  czar that's not a health professional most cdc and nih leaders may have once studied health but
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:40.960]  they have been bureaucrats for the last 30 years and they've forgotten what it's like to actually
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:45.600]  care for the public that's it you just hire a bunch of lawyers and pr people and they start
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:50.720]  smoking their own dope pam in texas i've got a lot of news articles of people canceling their
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:54.560]  vacations i don't think that's needed at this point but if we keep spreading it maybe what's
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:51:00.240]  your take on that pam alex i just have to say i adore you i know you're really busy but we love
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:06.720]  you um i wanted to tell you i am a medical doctor i finished my training about 10 years ago which was
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:12.320]  before the government started really taking over medical training and basically dumbing down doctors
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:19.760]  to not think but to only follow protocol anyways my family was planning on taking buying five tickets
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:29.520]  this month to fly in united and um i just absolutely will not fly right now and i i had given up faith
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:35.040]  in my congressmen for sure so i said i'm just going to call united directly and let them know
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:39.920]  that i've canceled our flights because maybe it's the public pressure you know if they see it hitting
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:46.080]  their wallet so i called and i spoke to the lady she's extremely nice and she said let me read you
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:52.880]  a memo that our company meaning united put out to us so she she looked for the memo she found
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:57.520]  that she started reading it to me and basically what the memo said was that united was telling its
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:02.720]  employees that ebola is totally under control but there's nothing to be concerned about whatsoever
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:09.680]  and i explained to the lady you know basically i'm i got a medical background and these are the facts
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:14.080]  you know we went through the incubation period two to 21 days what happens if the guy gets on the
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:19.360]  plane at day four and is totally asymptomatic screening procedures nothing and the lady was
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:24.080]  obviously very concerned um but i thought it was just horrific that she's reading me this thing that
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:29.360]  united gave them that said that there's no risk and i oh yeah they've got their propaganda together
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:33.680]  and there wouldn't be a risk if they did the screening and paid attention but because they say
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:39.600]  because they believe their bs is god and his reality that's why there's the danger amazing
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:43.680]  points pan you ought to write an article about that we publish it you know as a medical doctor
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:49.360]  giving their view on the on the pr thank you pam mr steele what's your take on what she just said
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:55.520]  well i'm reminded of how everybody was lied to by george bush after 9 11 when he told everyone
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:01.280]  to go back into new york city and and there was a test is good for you yeah exactly exactly and
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:07.680]  breathing asbestos is wonderful the fact is the u.s government has gotten away with telling lies
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:14.400]  lies for for centuries but more so than ever in the last 50 years and it's time for the public to
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:20.800]  start demanding the truth on every point i agree with you i mean look in third world countries
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:26.160]  if an agency had screws up they get fired or arrested and so they don't want to screw up here
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:30.400]  it's like you screw up you get increased funding well that's going to cause more screw ups
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:37.120]  i i really agree with your previous caller the time has come for the public to start putting
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:43.280]  economic pressure on everybody uh i personally am planning to fly to los angeles on the 6th of
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:48.560]  november uh but i do think it's absolutely irresponsible for the government to not be
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:52.800]  screening in fact someone just vomited in the pentagon parking lot the other day and she had
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:59.280]  been in west africa um i don't know what else to say other than that people should be sitting in
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:04.800]  their congressman's office saying look fool i'm going to come vomit on you if you don't get
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:10.800]  to start taking this seriously take it serious i think that's the the new hashtag take a ball of
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:18.720]  serious hashtag or just serious or how about hashtag truth absolutely uh let's jam in a few
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:23.120]  more here gaban north carolina you're on the air or north of kota i'm sorry i'm right or wrong
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:29.040]  go ahead you're on the air mr jones because you seek the truth i have a message for you okay
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:36.480]  the message is this it has begun a warning has been given in the heavens
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:43.840]  lest no man may boast of sending this signal the sun shall be darkened and the moon two more times
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:49.280]  shall not give its light and turn to blood my people perish for the lack of knowledge
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:54.880]  well that's a creepy phone call you know i think the government's non-response is the real
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:59.920]  indicator of how much trouble around like like mr steels saying uh but you got any comments on that
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:07.040]  steel well i i i'm not so sure well the apocalypse first off can be interpreted in in at least two
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:12.800]  ways and i i lean toward the the more fruitful optimistic way which is that light comes and
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:21.280]  we we reinvent ourselves in god's uh image and and we become a heaven on earth uh i'm a positive
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:27.520]  person uh i believe the u.s. government is getting to the point where it's going to melt down so
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:32.800]  completely that the public decides that it has to take matters into its own hands and that will be
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:37.760]  a good thing for america i agree at the state and county level people getting back to reality last
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:42.080]  call we have time for sorry the others darrell in north carolina you're on the air go ahead
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:52.480]  hey alex um i found a pdf from the center for aerobiological scientists at the us army research
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:59.120]  institute of infectious disease at fort getrick maryland said ebola has an aerosol stability
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:06.560]  that is comparable to influenza a and that basically all it needs is winter type conditions
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:14.160]  yes to maximize this aerosol that is so bombshell so army document and steel obviously knows about
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:18.960]  an army document says ebola could be airborne in the winter will you send that document right now

[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:44.000]  some of the top headlines and one of those headlines is that not only has ebola been shown to go
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:50.800]  airborne uh among animals but it is also known to survive outside the host under cold conditions
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:55.600]  well it's clearly spreading very fast now so you're saying cold weather in this army document
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:57:02.240]  makes it stronger no it it survives well it allows to live longer yeah yeah it survives outside the
