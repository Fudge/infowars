[00:44.880 --> 00:51.440]  intel from inside the fake Robert Mueller investigation on why the president is

[00:55.320 --> 00:59.040]  James Woolsey and that's supposed meeting and with General Flynn and then
[00:59.040 --> 01:04.360]  it gets even crazier CNN is reporting as we told you about two weeks ago
[01:04.360 --> 01:09.240]  exclusively here from our sources that the Podesta group run by Tony Podesta and
[01:09.240 --> 01:14.280]  propped up by his political operative brother John Podesta is set to close this
[01:14.280 --> 01:20.400]  Wednesday the 15th of November in just three and a half days that illustrates a

[03:23.600 --> 03:27.800]  evidence the fact that he's honoring vets and the fact that he's being personal
[03:27.800 --> 03:32.840]  activates human emotion and behavior and is something the globalists don't want
[03:32.840 --> 03:39.080]  is real humanity it's beautiful that's coming up as well plus ISIS has a

[07:16.360 --> 07:23.240]  global transmission it is already the 12th of November 2017 thank you for
[07:23.240 --> 07:29.080]  joining us we've got an extraordinary transmission lined up for you tonight
[07:29.080 --> 07:35.400]  but let me just start with something that I should have started with on the
[07:35.400 --> 07:39.760]  Friday show because I'm live 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. as their most folks know they're
[07:39.760 --> 07:44.440]  watching weekdays syndicated on stations across the country radio and TV in
[07:44.440 --> 07:47.760]  full wars.com for its last show this radio listeners want to actually add a
[07:47.760 --> 07:51.000]  dimension to it and actually see what we're doing here and actually see the
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.320]  clips and read the articles for themselves
[07:56.120 --> 08:10.120]  I saw a video on Thursday night of Sean Parker the former president of Facebook
[08:10.120 --> 08:15.640]  legendary hacker computer programmer you name it fell I got to meet once here in
[08:15.640 --> 08:25.360]  Austin and he was saying Facebook targets and exploits your weaknesses it
[08:25.360 --> 08:30.120]  targets and exploits your psychology it makes you depressed by design and it's
[08:30.120 --> 08:35.080]  very very evil and we consciously knew this when we did it so Thursday night I
[08:35.080 --> 08:39.400]  see that when I'm at home kind of getting ready for the next day show I
[08:39.400 --> 08:42.640]  spent two three hours at night sometimes getting ready and then a few hours in the
[08:42.640 --> 08:49.640]  morning and I sent Nico Acosta our head producer the clips on the computer I
[08:49.640 --> 08:52.720]  emailed them and I said I want to leave the show with this tomorrow but I didn't
[08:52.720 --> 08:59.040]  because Congressman Gates out of California came out and said yeah they're
[08:59.040 --> 09:04.640]  getting ready for Marshall on the forceful removal of Trump with a coup and
[09:04.640 --> 09:06.680]  they broke down how they're preparing for it and how they're trying to get
[09:06.680 --> 09:10.720]  people on Capitol Hill ready to go along with it and I could see how I kind of
[09:10.720 --> 09:14.680]  didn't go with my lead story because when I got up in the morning Steve Watson
[09:14.680 --> 09:21.000]  at m4s.com and written a story about that but once I kind of backed off from
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.480]  that story once I already covered it it was accurate once I'd already gone over
[09:25.480 --> 09:28.600]  and I realized we've already talked about that a lot they already got Phil
[09:28.600 --> 09:33.520]  mud of the CIA saying we're gonna kill Trump on CNN you already see the hashtag
[09:33.520 --> 09:36.600]  hunt Republicans you know kill cops I mean you already see all the
[09:36.600 --> 09:40.920]  revolutionary fervor Governor Jerry Brown just said you know we need to kill
[09:40.920 --> 09:44.560]  people that don't want to pay carbon taxes and put them six feet under when
[09:44.560 --> 09:48.560]  we've got that speech we can play for you it's on him full wars.com so it's like
[09:48.560 --> 09:52.560]  hey we know they're revolutionary they're bullies they're criminals they
[09:52.560 --> 09:56.400]  they'll kill us if we don't do what they say thank God we have a second amendment
[09:56.400 --> 10:02.960]  but to have Sean Parker multi-billionaire founder of Napster found one of the
[10:02.960 --> 10:07.560]  co-founders of Facebook and so many other big endeavors
[10:10.760 --> 10:16.280]  who was so crazed when I met him he wasn't on drugs it was natural super
[10:16.280 --> 10:21.280]  intelligence that he's walked up to me went Alex Jones I can't believe you're
[10:21.280 --> 10:28.400]  here he was all he goes I'm leaving and just ran down the hall out the door at
[10:28.400 --> 10:33.240]  a party I was invited to by a rock star and then she says funny little story
[10:33.240 --> 10:36.880]  because I said well I don't know what that guy's problem is but okay he ran for
[10:36.880 --> 10:40.520]  me like Casper the friendly ghost somebody sees a ghost you know they run
[10:40.520 --> 10:43.000]  out the door so hard they just put a hole through the door and there's a
[10:43.000 --> 10:52.560]  silhouette of their body but I don't need to believe Sean Parker I read
[10:52.560 --> 10:57.240]  documents 20 years ago and 10 years ago and five years ago I talked to former
[10:57.240 --> 11:04.320]  CIA section chiefs about this that were at MIT in the 70s I did my research
[11:04.320 --> 11:07.840]  because the elite acts like you're all idiots or I'm an idiot and then we won't
[11:07.840 --> 11:12.480]  actually go read what's been written in published books by them people ask how
[11:12.480 --> 11:14.920]  do I know all this stuff why does everything keep coming true I talk
[11:14.920 --> 11:19.400]  about why does the media create all these fake things I didn't talk about to
[11:19.400 --> 11:23.000]  attribute to me to try to make people not tune in it's because I actually went
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.440]  and read what they said they were gonna build and here's the bad news most of
[11:27.440 --> 11:31.560]  it they've been able to do the good news is we now know they mean what they're
[11:31.560 --> 11:36.040]  saying we can stop them we have the Intel because a long-term program like
[11:36.040 --> 11:43.440]  this can be stopped if you're aware of it even its final 20% or so so Sean
[11:43.440 --> 11:47.400]  Parker co-founder of Facebook Bash's company saying it was built to exploit
[11:47.400 --> 11:55.880]  human vulnerability that CNBC you'll be on Facebook folks and they pop up
[11:55.880 --> 12:00.840]  serotonin reuptake inhibitor Prozac ads and psychological test ads and they
[12:00.840 --> 12:05.120]  they admit they're targeting leftist I mean this was in the news in January of
[12:05.120 --> 12:12.520]  this year Australian executives leaked it risking their lives not just their
[12:12.520 --> 12:16.480]  money to say we're exploiting especially leftist we want to keep them
[12:16.480 --> 12:21.080]  desperate alone with fake bot friends and freak them out about Trump and ruin
[12:21.080 --> 12:25.320]  their lives that's why they're so deranged folks they've been hit with AI
[12:25.320 --> 12:32.800]  computers and by the way Facebook's fighting back I'm okay I'm not at
[12:32.800 --> 12:36.320]  liberty to get into at this point but they've hit the friendly thing and the
[12:36.320 --> 12:39.960]  negative deal they've hit us with the negative full manipulation of their
[12:39.960 --> 12:45.560]  operatives and their positive hey stop it Alex I've been hit in the last two
[12:45.560 --> 12:51.000]  days and we recorded a lot of it so just get ready okay so so all of this is
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.080]  going on their congressional hearings saying shut us down and Sean Parker comes
[12:55.080 --> 13:01.440]  out and says we're exploiting people we're using and we're manipulating them
[13:01.440 --> 13:04.640]  we're using their witnesses we're making them more depressed and he basically
[13:04.640 --> 13:07.760]  says it all it's incredible is he hedging his bets like Donna Brazil
[13:07.760 --> 13:12.320]  what's happening here's the first clip that thought process was all about how
[13:12.320 --> 13:18.200]  we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible and
[13:18.200 --> 13:22.400]  that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in
[13:22.400 --> 13:26.880]  a while because someone liked or commented on what you get on the hill
[13:26.880 --> 13:30.560]  or whatever that's gonna get you to contribute more we're getting a fist
[13:30.560 --> 13:34.160]  fight and that's gonna get you you know more likes and comments and it's a
[13:34.160 --> 13:39.880]  thousand dollars in a fist fight that it's like a I mean it's exactly the kind
[13:39.880 --> 13:43.920]  of thing that a that a hacker like myself would come up with because you're
[13:43.920 --> 13:50.960]  exploiting a vulnerability in in human psychology and I think that we you know
[13:50.960 --> 13:58.760]  we the inventors creators you know it's me it's mark it's the you know Kevin
[13:58.760 --> 14:05.280]  sister man Instagram it's all of these people understood this consciously and
[14:05.280 --> 14:12.200]  we did it anyway but did you understand the next hundred moves my friend or did
[14:12.200 --> 14:17.360]  you see the moves before they were even announced he now begins to understand
[14:17.360 --> 14:22.440]  that that's why he's doing this let's go to the next clip talking about children
[14:22.440 --> 14:28.880]  here it is and then they would say they would say no no no no I value my real
[14:28.880 --> 14:33.920]  life interactions I value the moment I value presence and I value intimacy and
[14:33.920 --> 14:38.080]  I would say well you're a conscientious objector that's okay you don't have to
[14:38.080 --> 14:44.320]  participate but you know we'll get to eventually and and and like I don't know
[14:44.320 --> 14:51.760]  if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying because it the
[14:51.760 --> 14:57.560]  on the unintended consequences of of of a network when it grows to a billion or
[14:57.560 --> 15:04.120]  two billion people and it and it begin and it literally changes your relationship
[15:04.120 --> 15:11.480]  with society with each other with you know it it it probably interferes with
[15:11.480 --> 15:23.120]  productivity in weird ways it you know anxiety is a huge problem now in of
[15:23.120 --> 15:29.400]  course anxiety was always a big problem but it the the surveys that have been
[15:29.400 --> 15:33.840]  going on for years are showing a huge rise in anxiety amongst high school kids
[15:33.840 --> 15:42.560]  and younger and and you know you have to wonder if there isn't some you know if
[15:42.560 --> 15:49.640]  the if the thought process that went into building these applications premeditated
[15:49.640 --> 15:55.080]  the first of them to really understand it that thought process was all about how
[15:55.080 --> 16:01.160]  do we consume as much of your time and your soul listen carefully because I'm

[20:23.240 --> 20:26.520]  Alex Jones show
[20:30.800 --> 20:35.040]  all right I want to cover something right now it's very very heartfelt and
[20:35.040 --> 20:41.520]  it's not artificial Trump understands the personal touch you know it was
[20:41.520 --> 20:46.440]  confirmed by General Kelly and others that Obama did not call the family
[20:46.440 --> 20:51.040]  members of troops that died he would occasionally if someone was me part of a
[20:51.040 --> 20:56.800]  political function like con and his gold star family then then then Obama did
[20:56.800 --> 20:59.840]  call a few of the families but Trump is called hundreds and hundreds and
[20:59.840 --> 21:05.520]  hundreds of families and that was later confirmed and Trump's one
[21:05.520 --> 21:14.720]  understanding takes serious value in personal conversations and personal
[21:14.720 --> 21:20.120]  connections and he calls every police officer that gets killed in the United
[21:20.120 --> 21:25.720]  States he calls her family when I got remarried didn't even tell Trump about
[21:25.720 --> 21:32.680]  it didn't even know about it Trump called me called my wife separately I haven't
[21:32.680 --> 21:40.960]  gone to that full story and he just relishes it now the globalists want
[21:40.960 --> 21:45.320]  you to only be emotional when they say about the topics they want it's about
[21:45.320 --> 21:49.200]  using the words they want or doing what they say or it's all manipulation with
[21:49.200 --> 21:52.840]  a bunch of actors with Trump it's spontaneous where he just says bring a
[21:52.840 --> 21:56.440]  whole crowd up here let's just see what they do the Secret Service tries to
[21:56.440 --> 22:02.680]  stop him and he countermans them and then Trump I reported on this a year ago
[22:02.680 --> 22:06.820]  but it's now been in the news Trump keeps a yellow notepad or one of his
[22:06.820 --> 22:12.360]  scribble does and he writes down everything it is a really good memory
[22:12.360 --> 22:16.080]  like he writes down things they want things they say and he takes what he
[22:16.080 --> 22:20.580]  gets just like it's a Trump Tower or a golf course what his supporters or
[22:20.580 --> 22:25.380]  members want and then he looks at it is it reasonable does it resonate and then
[22:25.380 --> 22:32.980]  he takes action on it so he's like the opposite of a psychic vampire he wants
[22:32.980 --> 22:37.000]  to give because then he gets even better back that's the big secret psychic
[22:37.000 --> 22:40.680]  vampires think they're taking only no you give you get back even more it's so I
[22:40.680 --> 22:44.840]  sense it's a selfish person and I want I'm in a good person my whole life okay
[22:44.840 --> 22:48.720]  I'm not out to get people but I'm meaner now if I need to be I figured out like
[22:48.720 --> 22:53.120]  this reap what you so what comes around goes around treat others you want to be
[22:53.120 --> 22:57.720]  treated what Jesus said man I'm all about it because the better I do I was
[22:57.720 --> 23:01.480]  already inclined to do it but now the more fearless the more focused the more
[23:01.480 --> 23:05.720]  giving I am it just comes back it's incredible so the media is making jokes
[23:05.720 --> 23:08.600]  about this they're attacking it you name it they're also attacking him Kim Jong
[23:08.600 --> 23:11.680]  Un called him old and stupid he said well you're short and fat but I never
[23:11.680 --> 23:14.440]  say that you know it's a joke like I never call you short and fat like you
[23:14.440 --> 23:19.120]  just called me old and stupid it creates it's that it's that joke to turn a
[23:19.120 --> 23:24.680]  phrase but Vietnam War veteran cries on President Trump's shoulder during Vietnam
[23:24.680 --> 23:28.960]  speech liberal mainstream media hit this beautiful moment from American people
[23:28.960 --> 23:32.720]  it does not fit their narrative they hit it they've also been attacking it some
[23:32.720 --> 23:37.400]  president Donald J. Trump is on his 14th day Asia trip and you know what's
[23:37.400 --> 23:40.600]  interesting here is when they instantly see something they'll attack it but when
[23:40.600 --> 23:45.760]  they don't know what to do they weigh today now they are attacking so he's on
[23:45.760 --> 23:49.800]  his 14-day East Asia trip has gone so well starting in Japan that will end the
[23:49.800 --> 23:53.400]  Philippines next week President Trump attended the APEC summit in Da Nang
[23:53.400 --> 23:56.600]  Vietnam on Friday and Saturday on Saturday President Trump delivered speech
[23:56.600 --> 24:00.440]  in the Da Nang Vietnam on Veterans Day by an instance several U.S. veterans
[24:00.440 --> 24:04.080]  with Vietnam War President Trump delivered another astounding speech in
[24:04.080 --> 24:08.120]  honor of the veterans and during it one of the veterans came and broke down on
[24:08.120 --> 24:13.480]  his shoulder this is so powerful here it is thank you for your support of the
[24:13.480 --> 24:19.760]  military and it's an honor to be here as one of seven Vietnam veterans
[24:19.760 --> 24:40.120]  representing the 58,000 heroes to an ever-vated home thank you so much
[24:40.120 --> 24:46.080]  I'm nervous you know it's an honor for me to be here and again it's just a
[24:46.080 --> 24:50.920]  short little thing but Trump has that effect on people because it's real
[24:50.920 --> 24:57.000]  he's not a saint he wants families to be strong he wants to have a future he's
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.680]  pro-human he doesn't want to break up families he doesn't want to attack
[25:00.680 --> 25:06.280]  Christians he doesn't want to not have prosperity he's not a Satanist he's not
[25:06.280 --> 25:11.280]  out to get you and those of us that aren't Satanists we understand the
[25:11.280 --> 25:16.400]  selfishness of somebody that doesn't just want to have things their way but
[25:16.400 --> 25:22.960]  wants to have it at your expense and that's what's so powerful
[25:23.360 --> 25:28.320]  Trump should lay off wiki leaks that the reason he got elected out of a lot of
[25:28.320 --> 25:33.240]  reasons they're a big part of it part of that trifecta and you know he should
[25:33.240 --> 25:40.040]  he should lay off you know he should expand vaccine investigations like he
[25:40.040 --> 25:45.720]  said he would do and you know he said he wouldn't expand the Afghan war and he
[25:45.720 --> 25:49.640]  has claiming that to clean it up and get out but we'll see he means well but he's
[25:49.640 --> 25:54.560]  done some bad things but if you weigh things the good he's done versus the bad
[25:54.560 --> 25:59.640]  he's done the good way outweighs the bad and you know a man by his enemies the
[25:59.640 --> 26:04.640]  way they're out to get him shows you everything speaking of that we've got a
[26:04.640 --> 26:08.880]  special that will end today it has to end today because a bunch of the products
[26:08.880 --> 26:12.440]  I just picked the sales I decide nobody argues with me they should a

[34:05.800 --> 34:11.080]  fight here ladies and gentlemen and when I tell you Roger Stone is a direct
[34:11.080 --> 34:14.480]  plug-in to Donald Trump everybody knows that he doesn't want to make a big deal
[34:14.480 --> 34:18.440]  out of it but you know the media calls him a dirty trickster and all this stuff
[34:18.440 --> 34:22.760]  and he just takes on their attacks and makes a joke out of it but the truth is
[34:22.760 --> 34:26.800]  he's a big sweetheart he's against evil government he's not a villain like
[34:26.800 --> 34:31.000]  they've said or I wouldn't be involved with him his information has been the
[34:31.000 --> 34:37.960]  most accurate continued information I've gotten from anybody except for my
[34:37.960 --> 34:41.280]  few conversations with the president where he did exactly what he said he
[34:41.280 --> 34:46.600]  would do and of course they have get me Roger Stone the Netflix series it was a
[34:46.600 --> 34:49.600]  big hit and all the rest of it they banned him on Twitter two weeks ago
[34:49.600 --> 34:52.800]  he's filing suit they had congressional hearings a week and a half ago
[34:52.800 --> 34:57.960]  Twitter Facebook Google saying they were censoring me at lunch because we said a
[34:57.960 --> 35:01.400]  Muslim ran over folks with a truck that's the weird thing is they've got
[35:01.400 --> 35:08.400]  these con games going where they they go Joan says the sun is yellow he's a
[35:08.400 --> 35:13.960]  liar it's purple and it's just like what what is the game where they hide it in
[35:13.960 --> 35:19.880]  plain view like discredit themselves is it just an appeal to power where they
[35:19.880 --> 35:22.640]  just think because they're in Congress and they're before a committee and
[35:22.640 --> 35:26.520]  they're the you know heads of technology or heads of operations for the big three
[35:26.520 --> 35:31.920]  internet giants that I was at lunch and I saw about the attack and they said it
[35:31.920 --> 35:36.840]  was Islamic and that the mayor had been warned and that needs to be banned sir we
[35:36.840 --> 35:41.120]  banned it at lunch yes we we banned it and then it was all true it was a fox
[35:41.120 --> 35:49.160]  news clip and again it's next level but I wanted to get Roger on because he
[35:49.160 --> 35:53.360]  called me about two hours for airtime I was actually up here already working and
[35:53.360 --> 35:58.000]  he said he text me said I got huge breaking news and again it's big news
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.080]  but it's a microcosm into how things work on multiple fronts it's been
[36:02.080 --> 36:07.640]  announced by CNN when he said three weeks ago here that the Podesta largest
[36:07.640 --> 36:13.480]  lobbying firm in DC by Tony Podesta was shutting down this next Wednesday it's
[36:13.480 --> 36:19.640]  officially closed Wednesday and and you see Saturday live turning against the
[36:19.640 --> 36:25.360]  Clintons now Donna Brazil Wolf Blitzer Chris Hayes I mean this is definitely an
[36:25.360 --> 36:29.320]  exodus as they figure out the public hates these people and there's
[36:29.320 --> 36:34.040]  indictments reportedly out there now I've been told by my sources when I talked
[36:34.040 --> 36:39.240]  to Roger two hours ago he said about an hour before airtime he said Alex I am
[36:39.240 --> 36:41.880]  not gonna answer that question because the sources but I think you're in the
[36:41.880 --> 36:46.320]  right direction so my source that they not just Tony but that John's gonna be
[36:46.320 --> 36:50.960]  indicted that's from other sources I have I'll just tell you in the Pentagon in
[36:50.960 --> 36:55.600]  the FBI I'll leave it at that and they've not been wrong either but I haven't
[36:55.600 --> 37:01.200]  gotten 500 pieces of info from them like like stone I've gotten 30 40 pieces from
[37:01.200 --> 37:05.160]  each group I actually can't believe how honorable people in the government are
[37:05.160 --> 37:08.640]  actually with all the intel we're given but I guess we're only the ones crazy
[37:08.640 --> 37:13.160]  enough to put it out so he's got huge general Flynn Mueller investigation
[37:13.160 --> 37:16.480]  stuff that deals with the whole investigation not just Flynn and then
[37:16.480 --> 37:21.440]  he's got huge news obviously with the Podesta John Podesta and Tony Podesta and
[37:21.440 --> 37:24.600]  the announcement of the lobbying firm is closing next Wednesday Roger Stone
[37:24.600 --> 37:30.600]  thank you for joining us my friend Alex great to be here I think most Americans
[37:30.600 --> 37:36.520]  saw a blaring headlines that the special counsel Robert Mueller had opened up
[37:36.520 --> 37:41.960]  investigation into General Michael Flynn in connection with a 15 million
[37:41.960 --> 37:49.040]  dollar Turkish kidnap plot in which it is alleged that Turkish interests engaged
[37:49.040 --> 37:55.440]  or spoke to General Flynn for essentially an extra dujishal kidnapping an
[37:55.440 --> 38:04.040]  expedition of a religious fanatic who not so long ago masterminded an uprising
[38:04.040 --> 38:09.480]  and an attempted coup in Turkey it's also fair to say that the gulon as he is
[38:09.480 --> 38:14.520]  known who was held up in Pennsylvania in the Poconos is engaged in a myriad of
[38:14.520 --> 38:21.440]  other federal crimes but ironically the investigation into General Flynn stems
[38:21.440 --> 38:28.480]  solely on the memory of former FBI FBI director James Woolsey the mainstream
[38:28.480 --> 38:33.480]  media tells us that Woolsey was partners with Flynn and his public affairs
[38:33.480 --> 38:41.320]  firm and that he was the one pointing the finger at the general now if you
[38:41.320 --> 38:47.280]  look at this stunning interview that he actually gave he implicates Woolsey
[38:47.280 --> 38:52.520]  pardon me implicates Flynn saying he heard in a hotel room when he came at
[38:52.520 --> 38:57.080]  the end and Flynn was present some discussion of an extra dishel kidnapping
[38:57.080 --> 39:02.680]  and then later in the tape he attempts to back off of it as if he hadn't said
[39:02.680 --> 39:07.520]  that previously and said of course that none of this was known entirely or in
[39:07.520 --> 39:13.880]  the first person so he purposely maligns Flynn Flynn has vehemently denied that
[39:13.880 --> 39:20.080]  he sat in on any discussion of kidnapping he understood the angst that
[39:20.080 --> 39:25.640]  the that the Turkish had about the crimes of the gulon in the United States and
[39:25.640 --> 39:30.600]  yes they should be brought to the attention of law enforcement but Woolsey
[39:30.600 --> 39:35.680]  has impugned a good man and that stunning interview shows his treachery
[39:35.680 --> 39:40.560]  here is the truth Woolsey was never partners with Flynn he was on an
[39:40.560 --> 39:45.440]  advisory board un uncompensated in Flynn's group he badgered Flynn
[39:45.440 --> 39:51.160]  relentlessly about the ability to make money he himself wanted the Turkish
[39:51.160 --> 39:58.000]  account a $15 million lobbying account perfectly legal his wife driven by
[39:58.000 --> 40:03.040]  greed and money had actually told the Turks 50 million was the price tag and
[40:03.040 --> 40:09.920]  they were incensed when they quite legally engaged general Flynn for which
[40:09.920 --> 40:16.840]  he was paid $500,000 most of which my sources tell me went to subcontractors
[40:16.840 --> 40:21.000]  in an effort to educate the Justice Department about some things that the
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.320]  gulon has been doing in this country that are illegal so the entire thing here
[40:26.320 --> 40:33.000]  is is because Woolsey who Trump never likes even on the campaign stump Woolsey
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.320]  is a deep-stator Alex who attaches himself to Trump Trump does not want him
[40:38.320 --> 40:42.320]  on the road only wants Flynn to travel with them and indeed Mike Flynn's
[40:42.320 --> 40:49.720]  representation of the Turks begins at a time that he when he is a private
[40:49.720 --> 40:54.840]  citizen in private practice and spending all his time campaigning with and for
[40:54.840 --> 41:00.160]  Donald Trump almost 30 days on the road introducing Trump at these enormous
[41:00.160 --> 41:05.400]  rallies so I think a great American patriot is being framed here and I
[41:05.400 --> 41:10.720]  said I think Woolsey is a deep-state quisling who is doing the dirty work
[41:10.720 --> 41:15.720]  of the bushes in the Clintons is pointing a finger there's no doubt there's no
[41:15.720 --> 41:20.280]  doubt about all of that and of course you get that from your sources very high
[41:20.280 --> 41:25.280]  up but expanding we're about to go to break what do you make of Brazils come
[41:25.280 --> 41:29.920]  out we've talked about it now Chris Hayes now Wolf Blitzer basically all of
[41:29.920 --> 41:33.320]  them are throwing the Clintons out of the bus something I've never seen before
[41:33.320 --> 41:37.360]  what does this signify well the professional Democrats have figured
[41:37.360 --> 41:40.600]  out that the Clintons are burdened that they're just no longer willing to
[41:40.600 --> 41:45.120]  handle most of the anti-clinic activity you see is being orchestrated by the
[41:45.120 --> 41:50.880]  Obamas who are ready to turn the page to set the stage for a potential candidacy
[41:50.880 --> 41:57.240]  by Michelle Obama Michelle Obama should not be underestimated as a candidate we
[41:57.240 --> 42:02.320]  can make snide jokes about her all we like but she commands a greater loyalty
[42:02.320 --> 42:07.240]  in the Democratic Party base and the far left indeed than Hillary Clinton ever
[42:07.240 --> 42:12.720]  did and her husband controls the machinery of the Democratic Party Joe
[42:12.720 --> 42:18.040]  Biden talking about running is a joke Joe Biden is an enfeebled old man who
[42:18.040 --> 42:22.480]  can't keep his hands off of young girls and women not his wife it's quite
[42:22.480 --> 42:28.080]  creepy well that's the big subject I want to cover with you next I mean the
[42:28.080 --> 42:32.040]  Republican Party is nasty it's a it's corrupt it's being removed we're in a
[42:32.040 --> 42:37.200]  battle there that's our real problem but the Democrats what does it mean when
[42:37.200 --> 42:43.200]  you've got all the Democrat media and things like Saturday Night Live turning
[42:43.200 --> 42:49.760]  against the Clintons what does that signify straight ahead with Roger

[47:59.000 --> 48:04.640]  and I'm gonna air the CNN piece and I'm gonna air the Saturday live piece and
[48:04.640 --> 48:07.960]  others if I have time to get to them all they're up on infowarstore.com where
[48:07.960 --> 48:12.040]  mainstream media is like Bill and Hillary Clinton corrupt they need to pay for
[48:12.040 --> 48:15.720]  their sex crimes they need to pay for covering up the assaults on women they
[48:15.720 --> 48:18.800]  need to pay for working with the Russians they need to pay for working with
[48:18.800 --> 48:25.800]  the Chinese I'm like when did they become the Alex Jones channel it's crazy so
[48:25.800 --> 48:30.080]  what does that signify just Roger was on a few weeks ago he said hey Hillary
[48:30.080 --> 48:33.760]  says you're gonna run again in 2020 we're gonna support our exploratory
[48:33.760 --> 48:39.040]  committee and I said to Roger off air I said I almost don't want to give my plan
[48:39.040 --> 48:43.440]  to make jokes about this because they still think Hillary's their girl but
[48:43.440 --> 48:49.040]  now all of them are turning against her the entire system meanwhile at the very
[48:49.040 --> 48:54.160]  moment the Republicans are trying to get a rope get rid of Roy Moore and I'm not
[48:54.160 --> 48:57.000]  saying he's perfect if you know if he did the things they're claiming and I say
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.240]  crucifying but now some of the accusers have gone offline others are you know
[49:01.240 --> 49:09.600]  Democratic Party operatives all this other stuff's going on my big issue is
[49:09.600 --> 49:12.760]  our big problems the Republican Party just because we're defeating the
[49:12.760 --> 49:16.360]  Democrats and America's turned on them and a political realignment how do we
[49:16.360 --> 49:18.960]  make sure we get good people the Republican Party to turn this around
[49:18.960 --> 49:24.480]  but Roger what do you make of the point we've gotten to when clearly a months
[49:24.480 --> 49:28.080]  ago I said they're starting to eat the Clintons they're turning on them they're
[49:28.080 --> 49:32.160]  gonna use the Harvey Weinstein thing as a trigger to go after everybody I mean
[49:32.160 --> 49:36.600]  now that's happened what is the next shoe to drop and what do you make of the
[49:36.600 --> 49:43.320]  complete exodus against the Clintons I think this is a very key point Alex and
[49:43.320 --> 49:48.240]  that is a many on the right have long believed that the ruling elite was
[49:48.240 --> 49:53.040]  monolithic and that they moved in total concert through their groups such as the
[49:53.040 --> 49:57.120]  trilateral Commission the council on foreign relations and of course the
[49:57.120 --> 50:01.600]  Bilderbergers it's not entirely true they have their own intramural struggles the
[50:01.600 --> 50:05.960]  Rockefellers always wanted ultimate power they never got the presidency the
[50:05.960 --> 50:10.440]  Kennedys had to fight the Rockefellers and the Harriman's had to fight both of
[50:10.440 --> 50:14.880]  them for supremacy within the establishment what you have here is a
[50:14.880 --> 50:21.600]  purge very much like the purge in Saudi Arabia where the hard left who see the
[50:21.600 --> 50:26.880]  Democratic Party as their vehicle and long-term investment realize that Bill
[50:26.880 --> 50:32.160]  and Hillary are dead weight that Bill's rapes and his assault on women can no
[50:32.160 --> 50:36.880]  longer be suppressed that Hillary's role in covering it up is now too widely
[50:36.880 --> 50:43.840]  known that the epic scam of the Clinton Foundation if they follow the path laid
[50:43.840 --> 50:49.960]  out by the brilliant Charles Wartell will lead to indictments ultimately for
[50:49.960 --> 50:55.320]  the violation of multiple laws because the Clintons indeed would steal a hot
[50:55.320 --> 51:01.040]  stove deeply resented in Obama land is the profiteering it's not just for
[51:01.040 --> 51:05.560]  example that Hillary negotiated an agreement with the Obama administration
[51:05.560 --> 51:09.640]  regarding her contacts and handling of her foundation while she was Secretary
[51:09.640 --> 51:14.080]  of State then made sure that the agreement was not legally binding and then
[51:14.080 --> 51:20.240]  continuously violated it in violation of what she had agreed to with Barack is
[51:20.240 --> 51:26.360]  it surprising that Obama is ready to download this this you know dead weight
[51:26.360 --> 51:31.600]  that's a really good point so if I pull back from this though obviously they
[51:31.600 --> 51:34.960]  know their political parties in trouble getting rid of the Clintons now that's
[51:34.960 --> 51:40.720]  a day-later dollar short as they say this is a metastasizing cancer and they've
[51:40.720 --> 51:45.480]  got all these other corrupt interests in there as well why didn't they see this
[51:45.480 --> 51:51.520]  before well the Clinton's hammerlock on the party money and her standing in the
[51:51.520 --> 51:57.880]  party based on a very strong run against Obama gave her the and the nasty
[51:57.880 --> 52:01.680]  tactics in air of inevitability professional Democrats many of
[52:01.680 --> 52:07.400]  whom I know and drink with who despise her supported her candidacy because the
[52:07.400 --> 52:11.880]  Clintons were notoriously vengeful they were sure so what are they saying about
[52:11.880 --> 52:17.000]  her now look at they I think they view her as dead me but don't think that
[52:17.000 --> 52:20.760]  means they've changed their ideology or that they've changed their game plan to
[52:20.760 --> 52:25.200]  push a communist socialist leftist agenda that was my next point that was my
[52:25.200 --> 52:29.880]  next point what you just said they are trying to jettison her because she's
[52:29.880 --> 52:35.600]  not leftist and globalist and racist enough they think she's posing as that
[52:35.600 --> 52:41.280]  and so this shows how they admittedly have gotten even more radical and even
[52:41.280 --> 52:46.600]  more mentally ill well look and I should address two other key points here my
[52:46.600 --> 52:53.120]  sources tell me that the attacks against Judge Roy Moore which are almost 40
[52:53.120 --> 52:57.080]  years ago these are not convictions these are merely accusations looking
[52:57.080 --> 53:00.680]  sketchier and sketchier and the more they are examined I'm told that this was
[53:00.680 --> 53:06.680]  cooked up and packaged by the diabolical Carl Rove at the behest of Mitch
[53:06.680 --> 53:11.520]  McConnell this is the payback for the pasting of their hand-picked candidate
[53:11.520 --> 53:17.000]  Luther Strange and they're endangering a seat for the Senate and they don't seem
[53:17.000 --> 53:22.120]  to care when McConnell called on Moore to withdraw he knew legally that there
[53:22.120 --> 53:26.680]  was no way to do that that his name cannot be removed from the ballot at this
[53:26.680 --> 53:30.840]  point regardless of any state what do you make of a lot of polls that are up on
[53:30.840 --> 53:35.120]  infowars.com showing more has gotten even bigger leads since this happened it
[53:35.120 --> 53:39.200]  looks like Alabamans are just sick of dirty tricks well that could be the
[53:39.200 --> 53:43.360]  case in all honesty it's a little soon to pull it because it's still nuclear I
[53:43.360 --> 53:48.480]  mean Roy Moore is a trending but someone has taken advantage of what is a
[53:48.480 --> 53:52.880]  national disgrace and that is all these leftist hypocrites who claim to love
[53:52.880 --> 53:59.200]  feminism and be feminists turning out to be sexual harassers I mean Weinstein is
[53:59.200 --> 54:05.120]  no different than Bill Clinton or part than Bill Clinton for example. How would
[54:05.120 --> 54:08.920]  you grade Trump I mean Afghanistan he said when he wouldn't expand that he did
[54:08.920 --> 54:12.760]  he's been wrong on vaccines he said he would try to expose that he didn't he's
[54:12.760 --> 54:16.400]  bad on WikiLeaks I mean let's say the things he's bad on but overall the
[54:16.400 --> 54:20.120]  elite hate him he's got the economy going he's bringing back free speech
[54:20.120 --> 54:23.680]  anti-political correctness I mean what's good about Trump in three minutes
[54:23.680 --> 54:28.040]  what's bad about Trump. A record stock market unemployment at the lowest point
[54:28.040 --> 54:31.920]  in American history very very aggressively trying to hack back
[54:31.920 --> 54:39.800]  regulations in all departments that retard job growth and economic growth a
[54:39.800 --> 54:43.480]  his head screwed on right most definitely in terms of North Korea
[54:43.480 --> 54:47.760]  understands that peace through strength is better than marching off to
[54:47.760 --> 54:53.480]  foreign wars my real problem Alex is that the high number of Bush alum headed
[54:53.480 --> 55:00.040]  by HR McMaster and Dina Habib Powell and particularly in the White House
[55:00.040 --> 55:07.760]  Economic Policy Council shop are hardcore pro NAFTA pro a neocon pro E war
[55:07.760 --> 55:15.600]  Iraq war Bushies and they unilaterally have found a way to I think mislead the
[55:15.600 --> 55:20.880]  president we were sure we're getting a lot done thanks to his instincts but
[55:20.880 --> 55:24.640]  when he's trying to pull from the swamp to make his government he's being
[55:24.640 --> 55:28.720]  infiltrated at every turn which means we've got to be vigilant we've got to
[55:28.720 --> 55:32.040]  be focused look you got to support him when he's right which is most of the
[55:32.040 --> 55:35.800]  time you got to point out where his orders and his policies are
[55:35.800 --> 55:41.920]  being countermanded by a Bush commanded bureaucracy out to undo what he wants
[55:41.920 --> 55:45.680]  done I think he's doing extraordinarily well on the big picture stuff let me get
[55:45.680 --> 55:51.720]  back to this briefly with you what do you make a Mueller now that he's just
[55:51.720 --> 55:55.000]  credited involved with the Russians Hillary discredited again back to the
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.960]  Podesta's shutting down their lobbying firm I mean what does that signal or does
[55:59.960 --> 56:04.880]  Mueller just roll forward despite the fact that he's basically you know been
[56:04.880 --> 56:09.280]  caught in bed with Putin look I think Tony Podesta probably isn't guilty of
[56:09.280 --> 56:13.480]  that many crimes if he's indicted for failure to file for the Ukrainian
[56:13.480 --> 56:20.520]  part of a party he was represented this crime is easily remedied by filing he
[56:20.520 --> 56:28.320]  did pot file late but he filed and no one has ever been to our knowledge
[56:28.320 --> 56:32.280]  actually prosecuted for this and if they were it would be generally speaking a
[56:32.280 --> 56:37.240]  $5,000 fine and they slap on the rest they're going after Manafort so it's a
[56:37.240 --> 56:40.760]  political stunt it's it's window dressing it's the way Robert Mueller
[56:40.760 --> 56:44.920]  convinces us look I'm buying partisan I'm going after a big Democrat now here's
[56:44.920 --> 56:48.560]  the problem John Podesta told the Senate Intelligence Committee he knew nothing
[56:48.560 --> 56:53.680]  about the Fusion GPS so-called dirty dust that's the real crime is the
[56:53.680 --> 56:58.320]  perjury on Fusion GPS and it appears that he was lying now that we know that
[56:58.320 --> 57:04.320]  he met with a Fusion GPS official who is talking to the government so I think it
[57:04.320 --> 57:09.680]  is reasonable to say that John Podesta's time in the barrel may be about to come
[57:09.680 --> 57:13.920]  but but not for what we're hearing about all right Roger Stone we can only
[57:13.920 --> 57:17.680]  follow you on Twitter it's Stone Cold Truth because they banned Roger Stone

[57:25.480 --> 57:30.600]  that I asked Judge Andrew Napolitano to review the first draft of my lawsuit
[57:30.600 --> 57:35.000]  against Twitter it's just come from my team of terrific lawyers and he really
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.520]  believes it's a 10 strike he believes it's an extraordinary case for free

[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:09.360]  fiction it's happening now in ridiculous spectacle let's go to Paul Watson
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:15.120]  laughing at deranged social justice warriors is so 2016 I mean it's just such

[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.880]  and cities across the country will scream helplessly at the sky one year
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:48.960]  after the election of president Donald Trump all right then one more time
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:07.960]  I was thinking this reminds me of something what could it be
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:48.940]  you're re-enacting the two minutes of hate out of 1984 you're literally all
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:03:01.480]  well Ian we're dealing with the daycare generation why do you think college
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.640]  safe spaces now have crayons and puppies to cuddle we're dealing with
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:10.160]  infants who learned that screaming was how you got your own way well this is
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:24.560]  the adult world snowflakes and things just don't work like that
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:33.000]  oh sweet taste of liberal tears tell a lie it's not sweet it's also taste salty

[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:43.020]  what he had to do
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:53.100]  I don't sing because I'm a good singer I sing because it's about not caring
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:58.740]  people think about you and telling it like it is all right ladies and gentlemen
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:02.860]  that's old Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard bringing us in with Poncho and
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:11.300]  lefty out of kindness I suppose all right let's get into the serious news here
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:20.420]  right now I want to explain something I'm not a bully and so when I see a weak
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:24.460]  person or mentally retarded person or a handicapped person I don't think hey
[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:30.060]  that's an old lady in a wheelchair going out to her car let me go beat her up
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:35.980]  because she's an easy target or there's a mentally retarded 12 year old let me
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:44.340]  steal their lunch money from them but that's how the globalist operate and I'm
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:57.380]  I'm not anti-Muslim I was against the Iraq war part one in 1991 and 19 or 2003
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:03.380]  I was against both of those and I studied the topics I knew they were putting
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:06.580]  radicals in charge getting rid of moderates it was all part of a larger
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:13.500]  setup to take control the region very cold blooded very immoral then I saw
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:21.100]  Obama come in nine years ago and I heard he was this Islamic operative he was
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:24.220]  involved with a Muslim brotherhood and he had this plan for this big Arab
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:27.340]  spring on the takeover of the Middle East and Africa and the killing of non
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:31.100]  radical Muslims and Christians and this global takeover into flood Europe with
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:39.340]  George Soros and all this and I thought man this must not be true that's so evil
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:44.140]  there's no way that's real and I sat back about two three years into it and I
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:48.380]  watched it happen and I had the CIA whistleblowers on Colonel Schaefer and
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:53.060]  Tosh Blumley and many people behind the scenes and they said we're giving heavy
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:58.740]  weapons the most radical jihadists that kill every woman man child priest non
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:02.420]  radical Muslim they're killing everybody and our government's back in it and we
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:07.540]  were the tip of the spear I'm so proud of that exposing it
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:18.420]  what a time to be alive and then I saw George Soros with hundreds of boats a
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:22.580]  day out of Libya bringing the radical Muslims he brought in from all the
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:28.740]  world into Libya into Europe and having the EU and the UN give them pass codes
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:34.860]  and give them passports and let them come in 80% of the immigrants military age
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:43.580]  men that was the words of the EU itself an inter poll turned out it was way more
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:49.420]  than that was like 95% military age men and I pulled back and I went wow and then
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:55.420]  I saw I got articles where the Muslims will go to a pet show in Germany and
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:10:02.780]  start raping horses pooping in pools they they're they're banning October
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:06.420]  Fest all over Germany first saw it three years ago now it's nationwide
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:10.780]  because the Muslims break the bottles of beer and just flip out and beat
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:18.820]  everybody up it triggers them to suicide bomb and I'm like listen here I'm not
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:24.220]  giving up my way of life and what I do and freedom and the ability to not drink
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.900]  beer or drink beer or go outside at night or a woman wear a mini skirt or
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:31.580]  not wear a mini skirt because we brought in a bunch of crazy people out of the
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:35.860]  Middle East and North Africa with a big bankers and Nazi collaborators back in
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:43.260]  it guess what I'm not putting up with this and here it is up on info wars.com
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:48.020]  but it links to mainstream German news with a straight face listen to this
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:54.380]  Christmas commercial British and Germany Christmas commercial by
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:11:01.180]  grocery chain features Muslims seeks but no Christians and you watch this by the
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:08.180]  number one UK number two company in Germany you watch the Tesco UK based
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:12.580]  supermarket chain with a Christmas ad with gay families with little kids
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:17.740]  they've taken the CPS and Muslims but no Christians no crosses and it tells you
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:21.740]  where they are but you think oh that's just a damn lemon article in full wars
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:28.340]  calm here's the voice of Europe Paris cancels Christmas market hold special
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:38.940]  Ramadan party every year instead and it gets worse this is the program because
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:44.860]  they know we're open free society type folks and so they just sell us on going
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:50.540]  along with whatever the establishment says so we're like okay we won't have
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:54.100]  October festival won't have Christmas won't hand out Christmas cards at school
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:12:00.220]  oh but the schools in the US and in the UK and in Germany and in Sweden they take
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:07.740]  the children to the mosque search engine it and have them pray to Allah and they
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:11.660]  let the Islamic men who see little girls as animals if they're not wearing a
[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.980]  hood known by some other man and escorted by a man that means they're their
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:20.940]  property women can't even go outside but that's okay because Linda Sorcerer and
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:30.060]  George Soros the Democratic Party said it was sexy it's just crazy coming back
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:33.020]  we're gonna look at the attack on Christianity the attack on the family
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:37.660]  the attack on basic survival of the species and the Islamic attacks that are
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:42.860]  going on as well but there's no doubt the globalists are just cold-blooded people
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:47.020]  that want to conquer society and rule personally in their lifetimes and if
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:51.900]  they got a ally of the authoritarian radical orthodox Islam to take over
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:59.980]  they'll do it and if they've got to overrun everything they'll do it the
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:04.420]  good news is humanities awake and we are rejecting their whole program we're
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:07.980]  saying no to their whole program and good things are happening and that's why

[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:34.900]  the reason they're doing that is because they know we're away when you spread the
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:38.460]  links to the articles or the video links for the live show leaks on Twitter

[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:18.300]  for more than 22 years on air I've exposed to the fact that everything the
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:24.100]  globalists do is upside down world everything they do is inverted well
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:28.340]  coming up in the final segment you're in about 30 minutes I'm gonna give my
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:33.060]  review of stranger things very well done television show that is laced with
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:38.420]  propaganda and anti-human garbage so that's coming up Darren McBreen is with
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:44.140]  me right now great talk show host researcher info wars fellow and Darren
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:48.580]  I wanted to in the next segment get into what's happening with the entire
[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:54.580]  Democratic Party turning against Hillary and turning against Bill Clinton and
[01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:57.140]  obviously they're not doing that because they're angels they're doing it because
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:01.380]  they know it isn't working the public is awakening if she was president right
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:06.100]  now they wouldn't be doing it exactly so we're going to in the next segment get
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:11.380]  into the final canary in the coal mine Saturday Night Live coming out saying
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:16.260]  you're too old you're arrogant you're corrupt you're out of control we want
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:21.380]  you to be destroyed and then Donna Brazil comes on as an actress and says
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:25.580]  I'm gonna bring you all down I'm gonna blow this up which is exactly what smart
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:29.620]  elements the Democratic Party are doing but I know they're evil and sociopathic
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:33.140]  so I want them to keep being so obvious but at the same time I it only
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:36.420]  vindicates everything we've been talking about the last few months I mean are we
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:44.300]  not next month's news today next year's month or next year's news sometimes I
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.140]  mean you've talked about stuff they did we don't hear about till five ten years
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:52.700]  later but you know they are imploding so bad I didn't tell you about this I was
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:57.820]  harassed over the weekend on Facebook by some people that not even friends of
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:01.740]  mine but they went on my Facebook and they're trying to tell me how info wars
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:04.940]  is and now we're the mainstream we're part of the mainstream we're no better
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:09.820]  than Fox News and and I'm just those are paid groups they go they gang up they
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:14.300]  target everybody that works here shing a weak link yeah well and they're trying
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:17.860]  to harass me and and I try not to get into any arguments with those guys but
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:22.420]  I thought about it and I thought you know is Fox News I mean we are being
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:27.060]  attacked we Twitter censors us they're hell they're talking about info wars in
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:31.700]  congressional hearings right now how to stop info wars is basically the topic
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:36.380]  it's going on right because we just want basic freedom but that's the thing we
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:40.420]  know Soros is spending hundreds of millions just on info wars funding
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:44.540]  campaigns to target all our crew go after people try to turn them off from
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:48.020]  money but of course you never even get it they're just there to use you and
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:52.060]  destroy you and again what are they so afraid of we have a memory Gruber said
[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:56.460]  thank God the public has no memory thank God they're so stupid we can screw
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:59.900]  them over with Obamacare they just don't like the fact that info wars like
[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:04.100]  grudge will show you something they said five years ago versus today that we're
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:08.860]  not that smart we just have a memory well like Zuckerberg calls his you know
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:12.140]  everybody that's on Facebook dumb efforts he calls people that trust me or
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:15.860]  dumb efforts right and don't forget it was Zuckerberg and now Parker the former
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:18.380]  president goes public saying we're praying on people that's right we're
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:23.100]  hurting people Zuckerberg remember it was a couple years ago at a UN conference
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:26.620]  he was his last year he told Merkel he said I'm gonna spy on the people on a
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:30.980]  hot Mike I know what she said hey what are you gonna do about this anti-Muslim
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:36.340]  rhetoric if people post anti-Muslim anti-immigration post on their
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:40.220]  Facebook what are you gonna do about that and he says hey we're taking care of
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:45.700]  it you know hot Mike and it started a month later CNBC reported that so ahead
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:49.220]  of our breakdown of Saturday Night Live turning against him a key bell weather a
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:54.700]  key key canary coal mine and then ahead of my Stranger Things review and this is
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:58.780]  a loyal opposition review I mean it's a good show it's just that it tells you
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:01.940]  what's going on with the CIA and real government programs that happen but it
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:06.140]  makes an entertainment that doesn't tell you there's a whole literal leftist
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:11.180]  foundations Ford Foundation Carney endowment script that's public I mean
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:14.620]  they admit the script is in all the major media that's corporate and so I'm
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:20.060]  telling you this is a CIA program it's coming up here in the last segment but
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:25.300]  first we're gonna play this clip of Angel soft that aired a few years ago just
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:29.300]  part for the course of anti-fathers ahead of this clip I'm gonna play from
[01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:32.940]  Stranger Things where it's all anti-father anti nuclear family to
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:35.940]  control you and break you down doesn't mean nuclear families are perfect doesn't
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:39.260]  mean there's problems they're attacking the strongest thing statistically there
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:42.780]  as don't have a nuclear family three times were likely to be in prison four
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:45.980]  times were likely to be on drugs they know what they're doing so it's
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:51.260]  biological but here it is father's day ad pulled to political to praise dads
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:55.540]  that's this year mainstream news but first I want to get into this ad
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:25:01.940]  father's day mom emotional ad thanks moms and this is a ad put up by Angel soft
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:08.380]  and the same NFL game they did this four other ads on father's day against
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:14.740]  fathers mother's day is for mothers we love mothers okay I love my mom by more
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:20.140]  of my dad okay but the point is is that dads get to have their day not no it's
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:25.220]  too political this year they won't run pro dad ads I've got mainstream news I'm
[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:27.820]  gonna show you just like mother and father are getting banned you know by
[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:34.620]  the whole movement so here is a clip of what is being run against fathers my
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:39.860]  father passed away when I was three there was four of us kids within five
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:47.140]  years so my mom had to raise four kids by herself my mom was a celebration of
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:51.220]  dads hurts mom herself or saying of a mother and father hurts people that
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:26:01.660]  don't do her whatever very emotional I'm sorry it's a whole ad thinking moms on
[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:06.340]  father's day I don't know how she's raised three boys on her own with such
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:10.980]  grace again dad being really nice hurts women seen her try to try to juggle
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:16.340]  both mom dad and you know everything that out this is like they targeted the
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:20.660]  black man you don't want to be the dad's out yep get the dads out they're doing
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:23.820]  the same thing to everyone now she was not a joke
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:30.020]  oh well that's the odds they know without a thought without a father figure
[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:35.220]  you're not gonna go out it's biological about the same male whales can't be
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:40.900]  involved male chipmunks toughness it was something very fragile I'll stop right
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:44.820]  there so they ran all these anti-father ads on Father's Day to see what would
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:48.220]  happen it blew up in their face this is the norm by the way Alex on just like
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:52.380]  all your dad's a fat idiot he's a drunk he's a moron it's every program every
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:55.580]  six they don't debate this but the point is it's declassified now here it is
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:27:00.180]  Harold son this is a US ad that ran here this year they tried to air it during
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:05.300]  their national soccer they call football championship it was banned Harold son
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:11.100]  Father's Day ad pulled to political to praise dads so let us show you the the
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:15.660]  the ad that's too political that's so evil that it praises how great dads are
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:19.660]  and how great moms are here it is
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:31.180]  little baby don't you cry daddy's gonna sing you a lullaby women together with
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:36.260]  a baby the humans it's like aliens make these ads this is what's bad this is
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:41.460]  what's banned father loving a child the image of a father being good we all did
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:47.100]  this does it take for mothers that fathers are good you know this was part
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:50.820]  of the communist manifesto is in the family look at North Korea's basically
[01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:58.180]  done it you've got to undermine men and all those experiences of fathers with
[01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:03.020]  their daughters and the father at the prom taking his daughter in a rubbing
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:06.780]  his baby's feet this is our human experiences and the sick freaks running
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:11.620]  things say this is dirty this is bad and we're rejecting it and the good news
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:16.140]  is let's recognize we're rejecting it as a human community the fake racism the
[01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:19.980]  race betting they push the name of anti-racism the sexism the classism we
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:22.820]  have all been on a journey together we have been through rough times together
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:26.500]  but we are together we are trans we love our grandfathers our grandmothers we
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:29.700]  love our fathers our mothers we love everyone the fact that we love mothers
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:33.140]  and fathers and families doesn't mean we're bad to other people they've hit
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:38.100]  with chemical weapons it's why they call it television programming that's right

[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:13.220]  chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:18.540]  were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens
[01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:22.940]  but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:27.860]  pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy

[01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:19.700]  Sunday 12th day of November 2017 Alex Jones here the final two segments with my
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:23.700]  good friend an amazing political researcher and graphics expert and
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:27.740]  talk show host Darren McBrain. I've already talked about it earlier but I
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:31.620]  don't just say things to make himself a filling profits I say things when
[01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:35.620]  they're evident. We told you the Democratic Party's turning on itself
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:39.820]  it's imploding we led the way at Roger Portland to our articles weeks ago
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:45.260]  noticing what was already happening talk show host Donna Brazil head of the DNC
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:49.580]  Chris A's Wolf Blitzer saying the Clintons are bad bad news hurt the
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:54.780]  Democratic Party they finally figured out what we know the the globalism the
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:57.980]  corruption listen I hope the Democrats reform themselves and get back to
[01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:01.100]  populism and free market and prosperity I'm not against Democrats or
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:04.420]  Republicans I'm against the Democrats because they became so selfish and
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:10.900]  and inwardly focused and you know so Kim Jong unlike or or or or or basically
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:15.300]  Stalinistic but we've got the big news here ladies and gentlemen since this
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:19.980]  damn broke in the last few weeks Saturday Night Live the big bellweather the
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:23.580]  canary in the coal mine that killed its ratings going after Trump and all their
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:25.580]  lies and calling me racist with no proof
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:31.260]  Alec Baldwin Alex Jones very racist got it from him all of that now suddenly
[01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:33.820]  turning against the Democrats we're gonna play the clip in a moment Darren what
[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:37.900]  do you make of this I think it's exciting to see you know but we knew this was
[01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:43.300]  gonna happen they have to stay relevant so they can't just be anti Trump all
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:47.900]  the time it's it's killing the radian their ratings and but I've always said
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:53.740]  especially since Trump has been elected a lot of people unfortunately they get
[01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:58.020]  their news and their news source is from late night television that's where they
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.940]  get you've been saying that for the seven years you've been here in info
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:03.780]  wars Alice we got to focus more in entertainment that's where they're
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:07.740]  hitting us I'm like I'll cover the news but you're right we've got to watch this
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:11.140]  and keep track of because that's what the propaganda and people like that they
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:15.300]  like to escape and these guys are funny I'll admit a lot of and I do too but why
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:19.260]  won't they let us escape well it's it's part of the establishment and we know
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:24.060]  the media is part of the you know the establishment they use the media to
[01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:28.260]  help control the narrative and they so what does it mean they thrown their full
[01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:33.140]  weight behind propaganda entertainment shows comedy shows late shows what does
[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:36.180]  it mean that more and more the Democrats are turning against Hillary I think it
[01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:39.500]  signifies indictments everything said about Trump on Russia is about to
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:43.460]  happen to them absolutely like I said they have to they have to somehow stay
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:47.340]  relevant if they can because they're losing power they're losing I mean a
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:50.820]  lot of people they're losing influence is what I agree so suddenly in the last
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:54.820]  two weeks why are all the Democrats and their entertainment shows suddenly who
[01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:57.780]  were like cult-like followers of Hillary and Bill why are they suddenly
[01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:01.540]  turning on them what do they know well they know what's coming out there's a
[01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:05.060]  lot of stuff that's coming out but even Donna Brazil and I do credit her for
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:09.620]  coming out and exposing the Hillary campaign but she's not gone far enough I
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:13.060]  mean her book is still called hacking she still says he's covering her but she's
[01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:16.980]  covering her own ass that's what's going on but look you've got a stack of
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:20.300]  articles there were some of those headlines I'm gonna play this this piece
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:23.940]  we're gonna analyze you're in critique this one is pretty huge I don't think
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:28.380]  you've seen this one yet but the Huffington Post they just yanked an article
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:34.220]  about Russiagate this was a couple days ago it was only up there for 24 hours but
[01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:38.620]  the guy that wrote this he is an award-winning journalist and UN
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:43.980]  correspondent for 25 years his name is George Lauria Lauria I think that's how
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:48.820]  he pronounced his name but he talked about Russiagate and this article only
[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:53.420]  lasted like I said for 24 hours and they pulled it I saw it I saw it today
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:57.740]  because it showed that basically it was Hillary yes it showed that it was Hillary
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:02.940]  and check this out the two sources that originated the allegations claiming that
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:10.020]  Russia meddled in the 2016 election they were both paid for by the DNC and the
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:14.220]  Clinton campaign and what's incredible is you've got real journals that you can
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:17.460]  post around tell the truth about this they get shut down which creates the
[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:21.860]  strizand effect but let's expand on that the fact that in this piece you're
[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:26.220]  about to see from Saturday Night Live that Donna Brazils the hero again shows
[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:31.220]  how desperate they've gotten here's part of that Saturday Night Live piece that
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:36.100]  aired last night and now a message from the Democratic National Committee this
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:41.220]  Tuesday Americans went to the polls and they told President Trump we don't like
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:49.660]  what you're doing at all sir and now one thing is clear we're back baby
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:38:01.100]  and we have about this confidence is the back this up Darren everything they
[01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:06.060]  say here is what we talked about how they really only won two Democrat states
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:09.700]  they already won last election they're imploding they're delusional they should
[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:13.260]  be gotten rid of I mean it's literally word for what Roger showed and I and you
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:17.420]  and others talked about last week they're now saying and how they stole the
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:22.860]  primary from Bernie Sanders which is true but again and how Seth Rich was
[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:28.980]  killed politically let's continue and we haven't felt this confidence since the
[01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:35.700]  day before Trump won you love our fresh new ideas delivered by fresh new faces
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:51.340]  like me and I'm team player Donna Brazil and we also have some great new
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:56.580]  leaders waiting in the wings like hot young thing Elizabeth Warren and also
[01:38:56.580 --> 01:39:07.380]  that's right and together we're gonna end the spirit of divisiveness in this
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:12.180]  country by focusing on how we won the governor's races in two of the 10 states
[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:17.780]  we care about and we learned our lesson from the last election we can't just to
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:23.020]  feel to coastal elites we need mouth breathers from Wisconsin and window
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:29.180]  liquors from Ohio as well and we know that what Americans really care about is
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:34.340]  jobs jobs like smuggling immigrants across the border and converting
[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:40.980]  Confederate monuments into statues of prominent lesbian people that they
[01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:44.580]  don't say what's politically correct like these comics out there who think
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:47.700]  it's okay to make jokes about concentration camps that guy should
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:53.900]  run to hell the dam's all back and we won't stop now because we need another
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:40:00.700]  path for our country another vision for America another chance for me Hillary
[01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:05.180]  Rodham Clinton just one more chance
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:13.220]  they too late they should have known back during the campaign I wouldn't get too
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:16.980]  used to this as well I think they're still gonna use their normal format I
[01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:21.820]  just think they're being forced to at least try a little bit of course fair
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:28.660]  this is our balance you're so it came came and just wait till Bernie transfers
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:35.180]  his face a passionate millennial voters over to a new leader no if you liked it
[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:43.500]  you should have put a ring on it pass watch out America because the dams are
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:57.180]  back we're back baby we're not old senior Trump I will destroy all of this
[01:40:57.180 --> 01:41:03.940]  that was paid for by Mark Cuban so what they're pushing is this count this week
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:07.500]  mark Cuban's gonna try to take Trump out in the next primary yeah in two and a
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:11.980]  half years and this is all the inside baseball but they get this is their
[01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:15.940]  facelift they're desperately trying to get the face sucker the Clintons out of
[01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:19.300]  there because it's killing them literally killing their party not just
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:23.020]  saying that it's the end of the Democratic Party a lot of these skits end up on
[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:27.260]  social media so that'll be on YouTube and it'll be on Facebook later and I
[01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:32.500]  predict that will be one of their most viewed you know because this is a thing
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:38.860]  they want you to believe that Donald Trump as what like a 30% approval rating
[01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:43.140]  just like you're in the campaign it's about 65 yes totally ridiculous so it's
[01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:47.340]  65 with voters it's about 50 with non-voters yeah so when they start doing
[01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:51.940]  more of this conservative like 57 they're gonna get a lot more views and
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:56.500]  they're gonna get a better reaction I mean most people the America is not full
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:42:02.140]  of libtards there's a lot of them out there don't get me wrong I'm just I'm
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:05.580]  saying the most of the majority of people are are patriotic Americans well
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:10.580]  also Trump 10 months in 11 months in is delivering on the economy and
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:14.620]  everything else so they've got a big problem they've got a big problem when
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:19.940]  we come back though I'm gonna be honest with everybody I want to see the
[01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:24.380]  Democrats continue on being so idiotic in the public so we beat them but we've
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:27.500]  got the Republican Party as well we've got a face but the fact that they're
[01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:31.340]  finally waking up that no one's buying your BS means they'll finally be a
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:34.620]  harder opponent to beat because they're gonna go back to lying more
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:38.260]  efficiently not just selling their whole new world or program I'm gonna come

[01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:05.420]  why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:10.780]  pretty much scares me the most I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:14.980]  from food and water and beverages in my system but right now we're dealing with
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:19.900]  massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:24.740]  off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:29.060]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere these are all parasites tell
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:32.020]  us about all the stuff there's so many things that are in it you have the neem
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:36.660]  in there you have the organic clove bug the organic wormwood I recommend doing
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:40.340]  the parasite plans at least twice a year all right well I'm glad we've got some
[01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:42.900]  back in because I'm going back on it today it just came back in yesterday

[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:55.220]  thank you Dr. Grip from the Global Healing Center thank you so much for all
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:58.220]  your work sir on this great product
[01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:05.380]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:21.660]  rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex Jones
[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:26.540]  what I told folks ten years ago that Facebook was there to create artificial
[01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:30.260]  systems of government surveillance between you and your friends was meant to
[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:33.420]  make you depressed it was because I already read government documents
[01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:37.940]  involved in the planning of social networks in the 1960s at MIT we've had
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:43.300]  CIA whistleblowers on like Steve Bachanik a psychiatrist but also whistleblowers
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:47.540]  behind the scenes I talked to but my father himself also worked on those
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:55.060]  systems in the 1960s and 70s so I was told about that a long time ago the point
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:48:02.380]  is is that the main propaganda is inside television shows and entertainment
[01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:07.740]  the globalists know they've lost the fight for control the mainstream news they
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:11.300]  know they've lost control so it's in sports that they put the politics in
[01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:16.500]  NFL you wake up to that they go bankrupt and now it's in great art films great
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:21.060]  shows like stranger things it's really well done that it's just laced and one
[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:25.820]  layer of this is the anti-family anti-father I waited till I was six
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:31.020]  episodes in watch the sixth today watch this fifth yesterday it's all anti-family
[01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:36.060]  it is definitely anti-family McBrain and we just showed earlier all the TV ads
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:40.620]  against the family against fathers dads are slobs dads are evil I mean it's so
[01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:45.180]  overt once people are looking for it it's ridiculous once you're looking for it
[01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:49.780]  you can see it it's it's real subtle but it but if you look for it it's right
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:52.780]  there in front of your face and I was talking earlier about the communist
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:56.740]  manifesto that's that's one of the things in the communist manifesto is to
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:49:01.940]  break down the family unit and this is a subtle way of doing it it basically just
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:06.820]  makes it uncool to have the nuclear family and again we get cookie cutter
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:11.660]  America there's been problems but it plays on your emotions as if family did
[01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:16.140]  this well if you think family screwed you over you wait till the system it
[01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:19.140]  doesn't give a damn about you they're trying to take away the one group that
[01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:22.260]  and it's in all the countless government documents the communist in the
[01:49:22.260 --> 01:49:25.460]  Soviet Union but especially North Korea as you mentioned earlier they get rid
[01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:31.380]  of the family so let's go ahead and air and this is total fair use I'm gonna
[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:35.140]  assume I try to claim copyright this is a public program I paid for this I
[01:49:35.140 --> 01:49:39.700]  watched it I'm a citizen free speech I am reviewing this to give you critiques
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:43.780]  also the girls are all anorexic in it plus the 13-year-old girls who was 12
[01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:47.220]  when they shot it they're calling her the sexiest woman alive sexiest woman in
[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:50.500]  Hollywood sexiest woman and we pull that up when we come back after this clip I
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:54.420]  mean there's so many layers but here's the deal they admit MK ultra they admit
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:57.660]  mind control they admit drugging women and children they admit trying to torture
[01:49:57.660 --> 01:50:02.900]  people so they become psychic or express their powers and that's all real but
[01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:06.660]  it becomes a joke so oh you learned about that on stranger things there it is
[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:11.340]  the magazine called Millie Bobby Brown or the sexiest TV stars and honestly what
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:16.580]  the f she's 13 years old the sexualization of children here is our
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:22.300]  breakdown of stranger things episode 5 season 1 okay this is the number one TV
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:26.140]  show in the world as most of you know right now so I decided to go ahead and
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:32.220]  watch the first season stranger things great cinematography great cast okay
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:38.500]  really good but then you know that there are written rules in Hollywood and
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:45.220]  quotas that every film must attack the nuclear family every show this is a
[01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:53.020]  minute and that every leading role must be a hero must be a woman so I'm sitting
[01:50:53.020 --> 01:51:00.260]  here watching this while I'm on the elliptical and the theme is families
[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:07.540]  having done it together is bad in the previous episode soulful shadowing the
[01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:11.020]  father's dead being has run off from the from the house that has their dimensional
[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:15.460]  hate broken there's no writer is explained they're fighting he was never a good dad she
[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:21.700]  was the mom that was good dad's back so earlier they'd stolen a gun his son had
[01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:25.780]  out of his car to go fight the interdimensional monster and I by the
[01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:30.740]  time he would solve this I said oh next they've got the gun the guy won't know
[01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:33.820]  how to shoot it but the girl will sure enough that happened but then it got
[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:38.700]  even worse then it got even worse it went further they did actually talk crap
[01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:43.740]  about the nuclear family on top of it now again I didn't predict this it's total
[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:50.100]  scripted just like gamer gay and all the rest of it this is incredible that it's
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:53.820]  just all laced in here and look I'm all for women being heroes movies the point
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:59.300]  is it's every hero in every movie now and it's all admitted a formula of total
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:04.220]  control and this is what America is is protecting so let's watch the scene
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:29.900]  right here they also laced into all shows the dream going to college they
[01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:34.900]  know it's a giant scan medley of fraud to debilitate people and basically brain
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:37.340]  wash them into gills that's all they classified to just like ugly arts all
[01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:43.660]  CIA but so this is a show about the CIA about my control but it's my control
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:51.620]  you need to be here to it yes you don't need a man knowing the nuclear family
[01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:55.820]  it's bad it's nasty but again they spelled it out in a minute again they
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:58.860]  know you're awake to mind control globalism shadow government so now they
[01:52:58.860 --> 01:53:03.060]  have a show about that to hit you with their property and
[01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:45.900]  again and I knew the girl would walk up and shoot the cans but then they go
[01:53:45.900 --> 01:54:01.180]  further actually bad-mouthing shrewd shrewd their family
[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:22.780]  so you're wondering how do they have them shooting a gun because they're
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:26.940]  gonna their bad mouth hunting and fathers again I mean my god they must
[01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:56.060]  have given the person that wrote the trigger episode a bonus for this and how stupid they think you are so again more attacking dad
[01:54:56.060 --> 01:55:15.460]  don't get married marry the state he's really well and take one check to the
[01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:33.340]  cancer there you go and I can sit there by the millisecond and show you the
[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:37.900]  propaganda and it's all like that not just the over at NFL stuff the globalist
[01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:43.180]  hate our families they hate our strength they hate Christians and like to
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:48.580]  pentagram with bathroom art pieces like shows my son is laced it's all absolute
[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:53.660]  brainwashing yeah the entire time so one of us a little programming with a
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:58.580]  head on that's over the guy has like Trump hairstyle it's totally white I mean
[01:55:58.580 --> 01:56:02.660]  it's all f a white male go to hell
[01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:19.940]  she's not just another suburban girl who thinks she's rebelling by doing exactly what every other suburban home does and hope that these passes in the matter is the boring one-time job who now works sales and live out a perfect and boring little life at the end of a coldest night exactly like their parents they're taking their economy away she'll be
[01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:32.940]  homeless and they make it cool now again I'm not selling the cookie-cutter program but that's the artificial system that's actually made everybody's working on together so then just like the Facebook
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:43.500]  all alone and depressed and so they make it cool for you to get deeper into your depression and not find other humans you love and work with then it puts an artificial stresses into family to make it cool to
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:57:00.500]  problems breaking the metaphysical deal understand and again it's only classified folks that that's what we're talking about this is a real program about brainwashing and about children being tortured and it's all been declassified it's all really going on they've been talking about the MK Ultra in here but then it makes it entertainment so when I talk about it then it makes the difference
[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:22.500]  in making it come back people are waking up about it that's the good government program and it's all the strangest things anti-family anti-male women are strong men are weak and above all else Christianity is not the answer and it trains women to turn against their men then the man's gone the state comes in the family's
