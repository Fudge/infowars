[00:00.000 --> 00:24.200]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:24.200 --> 00:27.200]  Turn your guns in, it's for the children.
[00:27.200 --> 00:31.200]  Open up a socialist America, it's for the children.
[00:31.200 --> 00:33.440]  Set up a communist America, it's for the children.
[00:33.440 --> 00:38.760]  Open the borders of Europe up to 80% military age men to pour in 10 million plus for the
[00:38.760 --> 00:40.040]  children.
[00:40.040 --> 00:41.880]  Call them all children.
[00:41.880 --> 00:48.840]  Put 25 year old Islamic invaders trained by ISIS and al-Qaeda in public schools, in middle
[00:48.840 --> 00:55.080]  schools and high schools and let them rape the children for the children.
[00:55.080 --> 00:59.000]  Call everyone invading the nation on the southern border a child, that's what Obama
[00:59.000 --> 01:00.000]  tried.
[01:00.000 --> 01:01.000]  It's incredible.
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am a historical expert on wide spectrum news and analysis and that's
[01:07.680 --> 01:12.320]  why the globalists hate my guts and when we return in the next segment, I'm going to show
[01:12.320 --> 01:28.680]  you total irrevocable, absolute, ultramassive proof that they know full well that Trump
[01:28.680 --> 01:36.640]  is following standard policy set up nine years ago by Barack Hussein Obama and that his policy
[01:36.640 --> 01:43.120]  was similar to that of George W. Bush and follows standard policy that we've had since
[01:43.120 --> 01:48.000]  the days of Dwight D. Eisenhower and I'm going to show you the news articles, the video
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.080]  clips, congressional debates with Dianne Feinstein, Hillary Clinton, all saying the
[01:53.080 --> 01:57.520]  same things just a few years ago about the situation.
[01:57.520 --> 02:02.720]  When you capture thousands of people sometimes a day, you don't just throw children in with
[02:02.720 --> 02:08.200]  a bunch of undocumented men and women, many of them coyotes, many of them criminals fleeing
[02:08.200 --> 02:09.200]  justice.
[02:09.200 --> 02:15.280]  If you do that, the children get raped, they get killed.
[02:15.280 --> 02:21.400]  That is standard procedure but it gets even crazier.
[02:21.400 --> 02:25.720]  You've got the Democrats from New York to Texas running around beating on walls saying
[02:25.720 --> 02:31.360]  let us in, it's hot out here when it's 72 degrees inside implying that they're all dying
[02:31.360 --> 02:38.360]  and you've got the former director of the CIA, Hayden, that Crete comparing it to Dachau
[02:38.360 --> 02:46.800]  and Buchenwald and Auschwitz claiming that they're concentration camps, unbelievable
[02:46.800 --> 02:51.800]  insane stunts but it gets even more wild.
[02:51.800 --> 02:56.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, when we return, the UN human rights said Trump's policy separating
[02:56.560 --> 02:58.840]  migrant families is abuse.
[02:58.840 --> 03:09.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, the United Nations is world famous for raping, murdering and killing
[03:09.080 --> 03:20.000]  children they take from their families and sex trafficking them from the Balkans to Africa
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.160]  to Asia to Latin America and we're going to go over all of that.
[03:24.160 --> 03:30.160]  I made a film on the UN abuse of children.
[03:30.160 --> 03:31.160]  It's incredible.
[03:31.160 --> 03:32.160]  America destroyed by design.
[03:32.160 --> 03:35.880]  About a third of the two hour film is on that subject but just search engine UN caught
[03:35.880 --> 03:36.880]  smuggling children.
[03:36.880 --> 03:43.240]  Hell, the UN just got caught in a huge Reuters report in January of this year.
[03:43.240 --> 03:44.240]  Put that up.
[03:44.240 --> 03:49.640]  UN running giant child trafficking ring in Haiti.
[03:49.640 --> 03:55.120]  Put that for me, please, crew, so this is amazing, United Nations, peacekeepers caught
[03:55.120 --> 04:01.600]  running a child sex ring, 2,000 plus cases of sexual abuse reported, boom.
[04:01.600 --> 04:04.640]  That was a whole other case, it's unbelievable.
[04:04.640 --> 04:10.840]  But the way they hoax this, that Trump has concentration camps, well we've got exclusive
[04:10.840 --> 04:18.680]  video up on infowars.com where they go over what's really inside these facilities and
[04:18.680 --> 04:27.320]  yes, they have chain link fences inside these air conditioned buildings so that people
[04:27.320 --> 04:32.400]  can't get in to hurt the children because you've also got people under 18 years, you
[04:32.400 --> 04:38.960]  have a teenager separate and we're talking about full indoor gyms, we're talking about
[04:38.960 --> 04:45.120]  the equivalent of a nice five day school, nice beds, everything.
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.240]  America on average takes better care of children anywhere else in the world, but the murderous
[04:49.240 --> 04:54.160]  globalist UN and the communist Chinese that actually sell people's organs, they're all
[04:54.160 --> 05:00.760]  lecturing Trump right now because they want totally open borders for globalism.
[05:00.760 --> 05:06.600]  Nourish a probiotic friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by info wars
[05:06.600 --> 05:07.960]  life.

[05:19.280 --> 05:21.440]  and flax fiber.
[05:21.440 --> 05:26.560]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria which
[05:26.560 --> 05:32.200]  helps you digest food, absorb nutrients and even support your immune system.

[05:39.560 --> 05:45.080]  And prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic
[05:45.080 --> 05:52.200]  acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum

[06:24.080 --> 06:36.480]  A few months ago in early 2019 Peter Sutherland, the former head of the EU, former deputy director
[06:36.480 --> 06:44.740]  of the UN who had made himself the head of the UN Global Migrant Initiative, died.
[06:44.740 --> 06:51.600]  But he lives on with the fact that the UN runs over 100 major nations immigration policy.
[06:51.600 --> 06:57.400]  After UNESCO treaties that Trump pulled out of last year, since the days of William Jefferson
[06:57.400 --> 07:03.680]  Clinton he entered UNESCO, the UN had been telling the State Department who could come
[07:03.680 --> 07:12.840]  in and who couldn't and were quote vetting the refugees including al-Qaeda and ISIS fighters.
[07:12.840 --> 07:18.960]  Now that's essential to understand so we're not just looking at what's happening with
[07:18.960 --> 07:25.600]  the detained immigrant migrant children, the children of illegal aliens invading, the parents
[07:25.600 --> 07:30.720]  abusing their children, taking them over thousands of miles through dangerous areas through
[07:30.720 --> 07:39.040]  rattlesnakes, through the smugglers, the coyotes, through all of it, Obama's own Justice Department
[07:39.040 --> 07:47.080]  and ICE estimated 80% of women that are brought across the border by the coyotes are raped
[07:47.080 --> 07:49.440]  as a part of their passage.
[07:49.440 --> 07:50.960]  I'm going to show you that.
[07:50.960 --> 07:56.600]  But the parents doing that, if you or I did that the CPS would take our children.
[07:56.600 --> 08:00.600]  We took our child out the middle of a 100 mile desert and said we're going to walk with
[08:00.600 --> 08:04.680]  our five year old across a 100 mile desert which is nothing compared to the thousand
[08:04.680 --> 08:10.040]  mile treks they're making out of Central and South America up through Central America into
[08:10.040 --> 08:11.720]  Suther North America.
[08:11.720 --> 08:16.720]  But if you went out with one backpack and you're five year old and tried to march across
[08:16.720 --> 08:20.120]  it, not knowing where you were going, they would take your child for child endangerment
[08:20.120 --> 08:23.720]  and they should.
[08:23.720 --> 08:29.400]  But you've got a UN program that Trump pulled out of last year where in Nicaragua and El Salvador
[08:29.400 --> 08:37.600]  they have two UN missions that actually run the program to have them stack up at the border
[08:37.600 --> 08:42.440]  and then get on top trains and they have agreements with all those nations that they can then go
[08:42.440 --> 08:48.000]  through on the tops of the trains, men, women and children hanging on up to the US as part
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.080]  of a UN program to collapse our borders.
[08:51.080 --> 08:55.200]  They're using these poor desperate people and I wish we could help them.
[08:55.200 --> 08:59.960]  But the globalist program to collapse the US is meant to bring everybody down.
[08:59.960 --> 09:03.880]  Look what the globalists have already done to successful countries in Latin America and
[09:03.880 --> 09:04.880]  Africa.
[09:04.880 --> 09:08.720]  They destroyed them the same way America is being destroyed with these policies.
[09:08.720 --> 09:13.100]  So I'm giving you the whole analysis here, but they don't want you to hear and everybody
[09:13.100 --> 09:16.240]  watching should tell friends, neighbors, family to listen and watch.
[09:16.240 --> 09:17.760]  You should tell them to tune in.
[09:17.760 --> 09:20.880]  You should tell them if you're watching on Twitter or Facebook or YouTube right now.
[09:20.880 --> 09:25.880]  And if you want to know what's really going on and how big this media globalist hoax is,
[09:25.880 --> 09:31.960]  their next big push to try to bring down Trump and America just like Europe is open borders.
[09:31.960 --> 09:33.800]  So the UN runs it.
[09:33.800 --> 09:34.800]  Trump pulls out of it.
[09:34.800 --> 09:39.720]  So the very same Soros funded non-governmental organizations, I've got stacks of news here
[09:39.720 --> 09:44.040]  on the same thing in Europe, but I'm going to tie it all together, the information they
[09:44.040 --> 09:45.040]  don't want you to have.
[09:45.040 --> 09:46.040]  This is the full spectrum.
[09:46.040 --> 09:51.280]  Now, now that you know that's going on, let's look at what's currently happening in the
[09:51.280 --> 09:52.280]  hysteria department.
[09:52.280 --> 09:57.440]  And then I'm getting the really big news.
[09:57.440 --> 10:02.080]  The Democrats are branding this and Hayden, the former head of the CIA, who was engaged
[10:02.080 --> 10:09.480]  in all and the NSA, all the illegal behavior, what a sinister, twisted, looks like a Pixar
[10:09.480 --> 10:10.480]  Disney villain.
[10:10.480 --> 10:12.800]  Zoom in on that sinister face.
[10:12.800 --> 10:18.080]  He compares Trump and the detention of these children while they vet their parents and
[10:18.080 --> 10:23.360]  find out who's criminal, who isn't, where they came from, who they are.
[10:23.360 --> 10:28.320]  He's comparing that to Auschwitz where hundreds of thousands, millions of people got processed
[10:28.320 --> 10:30.920]  and put in a slave labor and many of them killed.
[10:30.920 --> 10:35.160]  Now, come on, unbelievable.
[10:35.160 --> 10:39.720]  And of course, footage has been released of the children in these facilities and they're
[10:39.720 --> 10:43.880]  like high schools, junior highs and middle schools because they are.
[10:43.880 --> 10:50.000]  They're run by advisors from the local independent school districts who take the contracts and
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.240]  then they bring in substitute teachers and security and they run it the way you should.
[10:54.240 --> 10:58.960]  These are huge schools inside warehouses.
[10:58.960 --> 11:03.920]  I demanded coverage of this years ago, I made a big deal about it 10 years ago when it started
[11:03.920 --> 11:04.920]  if you remember.
[11:04.920 --> 11:09.360]  Ventura did a show on it and they actually released footage then and I had to shut my
[11:09.360 --> 11:14.120]  mouth because I knew they had some real FEMA camps and I wanted to know why there were
[11:14.120 --> 11:17.880]  jungle gyms and stuff in Round Rock up there and I went and found out.
[11:17.880 --> 11:20.480]  So I'm an expert on this.
[11:20.480 --> 11:21.480]  But let's continue.
[11:21.480 --> 11:23.200]  And I'm not bragging, I'm just saying this is a fact.
[11:23.200 --> 11:25.600]  If you're a TV viewer, you see how great these facilities are.
[11:25.600 --> 11:30.800]  Hey, look at the numbers of problems coming out of them, it's almost non-existent because
[11:30.800 --> 11:36.840]  these poor children out of Latin America and other areas are so happy to be somewhere safe.
[11:36.840 --> 11:39.320]  Now let's continue.
[11:39.320 --> 11:44.560]  You got the Democrats running to New York, running to Texas and then going, oh, it's
[11:44.560 --> 11:47.680]  hot, it's 100 degrees, all the children are dying inside, oh, they're dying, then they
[11:47.680 --> 11:52.440]  get inside, even CNN has to admit they had thermometers, the Democrats did, they had
[11:52.440 --> 11:58.680]  to admit it was 72, that's in my articles, some say that's too cold, it's too hot, it's
[11:58.680 --> 11:59.680]  too cold.
[11:59.680 --> 12:06.600]  76 is about the average they say, 72 degrees, yeah, we like our recognition down here in
[12:06.600 --> 12:07.600]  Texas.
[12:07.600 --> 12:13.800]  So Obama started this whole program and then again, they've got chain link fences in the
[12:13.800 --> 12:18.320]  warehouses on the outside so adults can't get into them or unauthorized, some of the
[12:18.320 --> 12:22.400]  cots are up against the edges, they use some of these photos before the facilities got
[12:22.400 --> 12:26.000]  upgraded but there, it's Obama era.
[12:26.000 --> 12:36.160]  Now let's continue, 80% of Central American women, girls are raped crossing into the U.S.
[12:36.160 --> 12:42.960]  This is last year, the center and it breaks it all down, numbers from the Justice Department
[12:42.960 --> 12:47.440]  and ICE, 80% of women and girls crossing in the U.S. by way of Mexico are raped during
[12:47.440 --> 12:51.800]  their journey, that's up from the previous estimate of 60% according to Amnesty International
[12:51.800 --> 12:55.160]  and then it goes into ICE agreeing with that number.
[12:55.160 --> 12:58.680]  Here's a CNN article from last year, the deadly toll of human smuggling and trafficking
[12:58.680 --> 13:03.520]  in the U.S. It's estimated that there's over 200,000 people dead that they don't know about
[13:03.520 --> 13:08.680]  but they've already found over 100,000 dead and another 100,000 shot, most of them being
[13:08.680 --> 13:12.360]  robbed when they tried to come up through Mexico.
[13:12.360 --> 13:19.880]  It is beyond road warrior in northern Mexico and how these folks are being fed on by these
[13:19.880 --> 13:26.040]  evil gangs, the Mexican mafia, MS-13, all these other groups.
[13:26.040 --> 13:30.760]  Now do you hear that humanized, you hear that covered, no, no, no, no.
[13:30.760 --> 13:35.360]  You have adults showing up, you'll catch 20, 30, 40, 50 people at a time, men, women and
[13:35.360 --> 13:40.880]  children, some of them dehydrated, whatever and of course you go women here, men here,
[13:40.880 --> 13:45.080]  you process, you find out who people are, they go through the whole thing and then if
[13:45.080 --> 13:47.480]  you're here and have a criminal background and have already been here before, you go
[13:47.480 --> 13:49.680]  to jail and your kids go to CPS.
[13:49.680 --> 13:54.320]  If you're a rapist or a murderer, others, you get deported back to Guatemala, Nicaragua,
[13:54.320 --> 13:56.320]  El Salvador, Brazil.
[13:56.320 --> 13:59.520]  What are we supposed to do?
[13:59.520 --> 14:04.360]  Oh, here, we got 100 people we picked up today coming over the river or crawling across the
[14:04.360 --> 14:11.840]  desert, here, let's just throw them all in to a holding tank.
[14:11.840 --> 14:14.360]  That would be insane abuse, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:14.360 --> 14:15.800]  Oh, but guess who does that?
[14:15.800 --> 14:21.600]  The UN throws people into big, giant, sports stadium style holding tanks and we're going
[14:21.600 --> 14:23.080]  to cover that when we come back.
[14:23.080 --> 14:27.920]  I have hundreds of mainstream news articles admitting unbelievable amounts of men, women
[14:27.920 --> 14:31.040]  and children murdered, sex traffic killed by the UN.
[14:31.040 --> 14:35.120]  Oh, but guess who's been suing Trump and guess who's involved?
[14:35.120 --> 14:41.280]  The UN human rights head, Trump policy separating families is abuse.
[14:41.280 --> 14:47.920]  He goes on to say it's government sanctioned abuse, harming children.
[14:47.920 --> 14:55.680]  That is like Satan just, you know, telling a regular person they're the devil.
[14:55.680 --> 14:59.320]  It's like Hitler telling somebody they're a Nazi, whether they're not even a Nazi.
[14:59.320 --> 15:01.160]  But remember, what is Hayden saying?
[15:01.160 --> 15:04.040]  That little creep who's been caught lying to Congress and spying illegally and all the
[15:04.040 --> 15:05.040]  rest is garbage.
[15:05.040 --> 15:10.440]  He says it's like Auschwitz, he says it's like Nazi Germany and you got the Democrat
[15:10.440 --> 15:13.760]  lawmakers angry with what they saw in South Texas.
[15:13.760 --> 15:19.560]  But then we have the shock video on infowars.com from information liberation inside Trump's
[15:19.560 --> 15:22.200]  concentration camp for immigrant children.
[15:22.200 --> 15:25.880]  And I can't believe it's nicer than many of the public schools I've seen.
[15:25.880 --> 15:34.280]  There's a ton of the footage, indoor gyms, everything, food, air conditioning, schools,
[15:34.280 --> 15:40.040]  the whole nine yards regimented by the best they've had in their life.
[15:40.040 --> 15:44.520]  That's the evil of the concentration camps, playing volleyball, playing soccer.
[15:44.520 --> 15:50.240]  Oh my God, it's so horrible, jungle gyms, everything, weights and track for the older
[15:50.240 --> 15:51.240]  children.
[15:51.240 --> 15:56.000]  Meanwhile, the UN literally runs giant child kidnapping rings and death camps and exterminated
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.880]  a million people in Rwanda.
[15:59.880 --> 16:00.880]  This is Dan Pilla.
[16:00.880 --> 16:02.440]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[16:02.440 --> 16:04.000]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[18:00.320 --> 18:05.680]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.680 --> 18:10.960]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:10.960 --> 18:17.720]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.720 --> 18:23.600]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.600 --> 18:26.920]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.920 --> 18:31.840]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later we now have the fruit
[18:31.840 --> 18:36.920]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.920 --> 18:37.920]  symptoms.
[18:37.920 --> 18:41.800]  If pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.800 --> 18:46.480]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.480 --> 18:52.280]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.280 --> 18:55.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:55.000 --> 19:00.560]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[19:00.560 --> 19:02.720]  InfoWarsLife is launching its newest product.

[20:03.120 --> 20:05.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:34.120 --> 20:40.520]  The president is speaking right now with Vice President Pence about the whole media
[20:40.520 --> 20:46.200]  hoax, the UN-run global hoax that we've got children in concentration camps.
[20:46.200 --> 20:48.200]  It's unbelievable.
[20:48.200 --> 20:53.040]  And if you just joined us, I was breaking down earlier all of that and the proof of
[20:53.040 --> 20:57.840]  it and the history of it and just how insane all of this is.
[20:57.840 --> 20:59.720]  It is mind-blowing.
[20:59.720 --> 21:05.440]  So he's still live as we speak and we're going to go back to the beginning of his statements
[21:05.440 --> 21:08.640]  coming up in this hour and play them, but they were powerful.
[21:08.640 --> 21:12.080]  He said people are dying in mass coming over the border.
[21:12.080 --> 21:13.960]  He said they're killing people once they get here.
[21:13.960 --> 21:15.440]  It's totally lawless.
[21:15.440 --> 21:18.520]  Latin America has collapsed.
[21:18.520 --> 21:20.560]  You've got the Democrats lying about what's going on.
[21:20.560 --> 21:25.760]  But if you just joined us, this whole push about children in concentration camps and
[21:25.760 --> 21:30.960]  this is like Nazi Germany and the Democrats and the Republicans saying it is their desperation
[21:30.960 --> 21:35.040]  to make America turn against Trump and turn against prosperity.
[21:35.040 --> 21:38.520]  It's just that simple and it's diabolical.
[21:38.520 --> 21:44.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, 80 percent of the women coming in to the United States through Mexico
[21:44.400 --> 21:47.160]  get raped according to Amnesty International.
[21:47.160 --> 21:49.960]  That is the Huffington Post own admission.
[21:49.960 --> 21:53.520]  You have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people killed already in the last decade
[21:53.520 --> 21:54.640]  in Mexico.
[21:54.640 --> 21:59.920]  Many of them, the ones kind of come in to the United States.
[21:59.920 --> 22:06.000]  And then you've got the United Nations running this huge gigantic hoax.
[22:06.000 --> 22:14.840]  U.N. human rights head, Trump policy separating migrant families is abuse.
[22:14.840 --> 22:16.240]  That's the head of that program.
[22:16.240 --> 22:19.920]  Now that's in the hill today, but they think you don't have a memory.
[22:19.920 --> 22:20.920]  Look at this article.
[22:20.920 --> 22:25.200]  One peacekeepers caught running massive child sex ring, not one person jailed.
[22:25.200 --> 22:30.840]  Reuters broke all that down earlier this year.
[22:30.840 --> 22:31.840]  There's AP.
[22:31.840 --> 22:37.880]  Now let's go back to AP.
[22:37.880 --> 22:39.440]  Think about that.
[22:39.440 --> 22:49.680]  AP Exclusive, U.N. child sex ring left victims but no arrest because it was the U.N. doing
[22:49.680 --> 22:53.800]  it, tens of thousands of children, many of them ended up dead.
[22:53.800 --> 22:59.880]  Hundreds were found dead, raped, murdered, decapitated, snuff filmed.
[22:59.880 --> 23:02.000]  That's the U.N. peacekeeper specialty all over the world.
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.120]  It's known for that.
[23:03.120 --> 23:06.480]  I've made films about it 21 years ago.
[23:06.480 --> 23:09.440]  I made my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[23:09.440 --> 23:16.360]  A third of it is about U.N. sex crimes with mainstream articles and videos.
[23:16.360 --> 23:20.680]  I had to blur it out, but we've got them raping children, torturing them and roasting them
[23:20.680 --> 23:24.160]  over fires and eating them.
[23:24.160 --> 23:34.960]  In my film, America Destroyed by Design, we have the U.N. roasting and eating children.
[23:34.960 --> 23:41.840]  Roasting and eating children, U.N. peacekeepers caught running a child sex ring, 2,000 plus
[23:41.840 --> 23:44.160]  cases of sexual abuse reported.
[23:44.160 --> 23:51.640]  It's AP, the child sex ring run by the U.N. peacekeepers in Haiti.
[23:51.640 --> 23:56.320]  Here's another one, U.N. failed Rwanda, they didn't fail.
[23:56.320 --> 24:03.600]  They came in in 94, Bill Clinton oversaw it, they stood down, they put the minority Christian
[24:03.600 --> 24:07.840]  tribe in camps and killed over a million of them and the U.N. oversaw it and there's
[24:07.840 --> 24:12.840]  videos and photos of the U.N. raping and robbing the women and children and then killing them
[24:12.840 --> 24:15.400]  with machetes and machine guns.
[24:15.400 --> 24:22.640]  Exclusive, Rwanda revisited former President Clinton said he never knew the extent of suffering
[24:22.640 --> 24:26.760]  during Iran's genocide, but American diplomats on the ground knew exactly what was happening
[24:26.760 --> 24:29.920]  and they told Washington and were told to stand down.
[24:29.920 --> 24:40.840]  That's foreignpolicy.com, globalist publication, globalist publication 2015 documenting everything
[24:40.840 --> 24:49.080]  I said in my film America destroyed by design, shove that down your throat so-called liberals.
[24:49.080 --> 24:58.280]  When you point your fingers at Trump and air-conditioned facilities that by law set up decades ago,
[24:58.280 --> 25:02.360]  the children come into because they're with all these adults, they don't know who's who,
[25:02.360 --> 25:05.240]  they've got to vet them, put them into the database.
[25:05.240 --> 25:10.080]  You don't put children in general population in these immigrant detention centers that every
[25:10.080 --> 25:18.360]  other country has, unless you're Germany or Europe where they open their borders up, 80%
[25:18.360 --> 25:23.600]  of Central American women and girls are rape crossing into the U.S.
[25:23.600 --> 25:28.320]  The deadly toll, it's all right here, London independent, U.N. peacekeepers and Haiti implicated
[25:28.320 --> 25:34.440]  in child sex ring, on and on and on and on and on.
[25:34.440 --> 25:38.960]  I mean you can go to Bing images, Google censors everything now or other search engines
[25:38.960 --> 25:44.040]  type in U.N. peacekeepers killing children, U.N. peacekeepers raping children and you
[25:44.040 --> 25:52.440]  will get your spiegel, you'll get the Moscow Times, you'll get the Japanese newspapers,
[25:52.440 --> 25:55.560]  hardly any U.S. news but you can see it for yourself.
[25:55.560 --> 26:02.440]  But the biggest ones were the whistleblowers, the congressional hearings about Kosovo and
[26:02.440 --> 26:07.040]  also about Bosnia-Herzegovina, remember that there have been Hollywood movies made about
[26:07.040 --> 26:10.800]  it, where they were loading kids on C-130s, the U.N. and flying them out to the Middle
[26:10.800 --> 26:20.080]  East to the sex dungeons, just like the Lolita Express with Epstein and Weinstein and Clinton.
[26:20.080 --> 26:24.600]  I mean these people got a lot of nerve, they're the ones, the U.N. running industrial level
[26:24.600 --> 26:29.920]  child kidnapping and sex abuse and kidnapping women, that's a whole other area, it's even
[26:29.920 --> 26:36.760]  bigger, the U.N., type in U.N. trafficking kidnapped women, you'll get Guardian, AP Reuters,
[26:36.760 --> 26:46.200]  I mean confirmed, absolutely, totally confirmed, massive sex crimes, U.S. congressional hearings
[26:46.200 --> 26:53.440]  but zero coverage, here in the U.S. media and it's all been confirmed now, the Democrats
[26:53.440 --> 26:58.600]  try to whitewash it but don't worry, oh the former head of the CIA and the NSA Hayden
[26:58.600 --> 27:04.800]  says it's like Auschwitz and Dachau and Buchenwald, Nazi Germany and Trump's a Nazi and the Democrats
[27:04.800 --> 27:09.000]  are banging on the doors, oh we ought to roll some of that footage, let us in, oh we demand
[27:09.000 --> 27:21.160]  to see the babies, they let them in, it's all nice, 72 degrees, it's incredible ladies
[27:21.160 --> 27:29.520]  and gentlemen, oh these Democrats care so much about your children, they care so much
[27:29.520 --> 27:33.960]  and they've got all the regular Democrat lawyers running along behind everybody, these people
[27:33.960 --> 27:39.520]  are unbelievable, trying to humanize people, we're treating like humans, when the global
[27:39.520 --> 27:43.560]  is for everybody else like dog meat and they're just trying to create an idea that we can't
[27:43.560 --> 27:48.160]  have a border and we can't hold anybody that pours across our border when they are abusing
[27:48.160 --> 27:52.040]  their children, bringing them across and a lot of the kids it turns out have to go through
[27:52.040 --> 27:57.120]  databases, they've been kidnapped, a lot of times their children that other people have
[27:57.120 --> 28:00.720]  that were grabbed from their parents who were killed on the way up, what do you think happens
[28:00.720 --> 28:04.160]  to the hundreds of thousands of people that have been dug up and mass graved all over
[28:04.160 --> 28:07.280]  Mexico, a lot of times their kids aren't with them, they're taken, they're smuggled and
[28:07.280 --> 28:12.160]  the Democrats have been caught all over the US fencing the kids through the Catholic Church
[28:12.160 --> 28:16.360]  instead of quote through the normal government aid agencies, Obama only started that the
[28:16.360 --> 28:22.640]  last few years and with Segwaying, this is the real scandal, out of keeping them in
[28:22.640 --> 28:25.720]  the detention centers and processing them and just loading them on buses, remember
[28:25.720 --> 28:29.760]  we broke that, that they were just loading them on buses and then shipping them to Catholic
[28:29.760 --> 28:36.000]  charities, oh give a bunch of little kids to the Catholic priest and all the other perverts
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.280]  with them, isn't that a great idea, I must say all Catholic priests are but the special
[28:40.280 --> 28:44.400]  Democrat party ones, going to pull up Jocari Jackson's report on that from four years ago,
[28:44.400 --> 28:49.160]  we were the first to break that, drudge link to it, where they were just loading them on
[28:49.160 --> 28:54.720]  the buses and just disappearing kids, oh really that's totally illegal but Obama did it, we'll
[28:54.720 --> 28:59.280]  be back, stay with us.

[32:00.160 --> 32:03.960]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[32:03.960 --> 32:08.480]  The real drama can be found here in Lelani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[32:08.480 --> 32:13.920]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[32:13.920 --> 32:19.320]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[32:19.320 --> 32:20.840]  to unhealthy levels.
[32:20.840 --> 32:27.400]  To find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[32:27.400 --> 32:31.360]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[32:31.360 --> 32:32.880]  in the rainwater.
[32:32.880 --> 32:38.080]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[32:38.080 --> 32:44.160]  metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[32:44.160 --> 32:50.120]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned
[32:50.120 --> 32:55.120]  is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[32:55.120 --> 33:04.080]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[33:04.080 --> 33:21.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:21.280 --> 33:34.120]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[33:34.120 --> 33:38.440]  I am so outraged right now.
[33:38.440 --> 33:45.120]  I am boiling angry right now that the mainstream media is so deceptive, so brazen, so over the
[33:45.120 --> 33:51.320]  top arrogant that they think they can sell the hoax that the U.S. has children from Latin
[33:51.320 --> 33:56.720]  America and other areas that are pouring in illegally with smugglers, their parents that
[33:56.720 --> 34:01.600]  are endangering them, you name it, and they're being put in clean, nice facilities that are
[34:01.600 --> 34:06.760]  set up as schools while we find out who the hell they came in with through the hundreds
[34:06.760 --> 34:11.520]  of thousands that have been killed trying to get into the U.S. by the murderous, barbarous
[34:11.520 --> 34:13.720]  gangs in Mexico.
[34:13.720 --> 34:19.560]  And to have that turned around and to have Democratic Congress people banging on doors
[34:19.560 --> 34:24.120]  saying it's hot out here and they get inside at 72 degrees and they go, well, doesn't matter,
[34:24.120 --> 34:29.600]  you should let them go like Obama started doing before he followed the U.S. law and
[34:29.600 --> 34:32.840]  the kids got taken care of, but he started loathing them on buses and shipping them to
[34:32.840 --> 34:37.920]  Democrat and Catholic charities run by the Democrats just disappearing them.
[34:37.920 --> 34:43.360]  Many of them found in sex trafficking and I've got even CNN reporting that right here.
[34:43.360 --> 34:48.560]  So let's just let kids randomly show up with who the hell knows who and then just turn
[34:48.560 --> 34:51.400]  them loose into the U.S.
[34:51.400 --> 34:52.720]  That is completely evil.
[34:52.720 --> 34:58.160]  But we first documented that four years ago with Jacarie Jackson and Adon Salazar where
[34:58.160 --> 35:03.680]  we caught the buses and in McAllen, Texas and the local emergency manager saying, look,
[35:03.680 --> 35:04.680]  here's the order.
[35:04.680 --> 35:08.720]  Obama told us, let them in, load them on buses and they're sent to Democrat charities.
[35:08.720 --> 35:13.840]  Folks, Hillary's top lady got caught in Haiti trying to ship out a bunch of kids without
[35:13.840 --> 35:14.840]  documentation.
[35:14.840 --> 35:20.600]  Remember, she got a major smuggling charge and was convicted, but when the president
[35:20.600 --> 35:22.600]  ordered it, it still happened.
[35:22.600 --> 35:28.040]  Think about the smoke screen they're using here and how huge this is that you've got
[35:28.040 --> 35:36.400]  the former head of the CIA Hayden saying that this is like concentration camps for the kids
[35:36.400 --> 35:39.560]  and that all of this is going on.
[35:39.560 --> 35:42.360]  The Democrats yelling and screaming saying there's no air conditioning till they get
[35:42.360 --> 35:43.360]  inside.
[35:43.360 --> 35:51.240]  All Trump's doing is following U.S. law and then you get the U.N. coming out saying that
[35:51.240 --> 35:54.720]  this is like a concentration camp and Trump is a criminal.
[35:54.720 --> 36:01.040]  When the U.N. has this incredible history of mass sex slavery in Africa and Haiti in
[36:01.040 --> 36:05.040]  the Balkans, in Asia, in Latin America, it is incredible.
[36:05.040 --> 36:09.760]  This AP on screen, unbelievable.
[36:09.760 --> 36:16.800]  We were in Haiti months before that broke and first reported on it with senators in Haiti.
[36:16.800 --> 36:21.280]  Just like we reported on and broke the latest mole in the Trump campaign and the last two
[36:21.280 --> 36:25.240]  moles, we're going to break more in the next segment with Roger Stone exclusively and Matt
[36:25.240 --> 36:26.720]  Bracken with his analysis.
[36:26.720 --> 36:31.400]  But let me, because I was mentioning it, get to the president's speech that's still
[36:31.400 --> 36:37.080]  ongoing but the first is very, very powerful where he lays it all out.
[36:37.080 --> 36:40.440]  We're live linked to it on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[36:40.440 --> 36:48.120]  The president exposes the massive hoax that he's even in control of this.
[36:48.120 --> 36:49.560]  He's just following the law.
[36:49.560 --> 36:54.600]  He defaulted back to the law that Obama started violating halfway into his presidency.
[36:54.600 --> 36:57.600]  First four years Obama followed the law, put them in these detention centers, they weren't
[36:57.600 --> 36:58.600]  as nice.
[36:58.600 --> 37:02.320]  They've been beefed up and made nicer.
[37:02.320 --> 37:06.840]  He's making the children detention centers great again but with Obama put our article
[37:06.840 --> 37:07.840]  back up during his speech.
[37:07.840 --> 37:11.640]  I want to show people our article from four years ago with the HD footage of the emergency
[37:11.640 --> 37:15.200]  manager saying, we're ordered to not even ask you who they are, load them, men, women,
[37:15.200 --> 37:21.920]  children up in buses and just sometimes unaccounted 10-year-olds and just ship them to Illinois.
[37:21.920 --> 37:22.920]  You name it.
[37:22.920 --> 37:23.920]  Wow.
[37:23.920 --> 37:27.480]  You imagine you're going to an airport and you come in and there's some little kids
[37:27.480 --> 37:30.720]  there and the government just takes them and says, we're going to just turn them loose
[37:30.720 --> 37:33.040]  outside the airport to some random people.
[37:33.040 --> 37:35.040]  You'd say, is this a movie?
[37:35.040 --> 37:37.120]  But they do it.
[37:37.120 --> 37:42.240]  And then when we try to stop it, they turn it around that we put kids in a fricking concentration
[37:42.240 --> 37:43.240]  camp.
[37:43.240 --> 37:45.840]  America defeated Hitler.
[37:45.840 --> 37:49.200]  Now the Democrats have said they want to put conservatives in reeducation centers.
[37:49.200 --> 37:51.320]  That's in major bills.
[37:51.320 --> 37:52.600]  But that's their political enemies.
[37:52.600 --> 37:55.000]  Hell, Hillary said we want fun camps for men.
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.280]  They've said they want to reeducate us.
[37:57.280 --> 38:02.120]  They turn the colleges into these reeducation camps, but this is not happening to these
[38:02.120 --> 38:03.120]  children.
[38:03.120 --> 38:04.120]  They're being well taken care of.
[38:04.120 --> 38:08.680]  I have investigated it because I would investigate real FEMA centers and ran to some of these.
[38:08.680 --> 38:12.320]  And these are simply following law they're well taken care of.
[38:12.320 --> 38:14.520]  Some of their parents are allowed into the country and they're not criminals if they're
[38:14.520 --> 38:15.520]  not their ship back.
[38:15.520 --> 38:18.200]  A lot of times they're being smuggled in by people that aren't even their parents or
[38:18.200 --> 38:19.200]  family.
[38:19.200 --> 38:23.720]  They're catching kids being smuggled in for the hungry market of child molesters in the
[38:23.720 --> 38:26.640]  U.S. and their spokespersons, the Democratic Party.
[38:26.640 --> 38:27.640]  That's who they are.
[38:27.640 --> 38:35.240]  It's why Salon, it's why the New York Times, it's why HBO, Vice is now promoting pedophilia
[38:35.240 --> 38:40.640]  because they want to normalize what they are into.
[38:40.640 --> 38:44.280]  They catch Democrats all the time with underground sex slave things in Austin and it's always
[38:44.280 --> 38:50.040]  like the mayor's brother or city councilman's brother and their coyotes here in Austin beating
[38:50.040 --> 38:52.640]  people with baseball bats to suck money out of them.
[38:52.640 --> 38:55.720]  And if they don't do good, they're found dead in the desert.
[38:55.720 --> 39:00.000]  But then Robert Rodriguez makes movies where Don Johnson, the gringo, shoots the pregnant
[39:00.000 --> 39:01.000]  Mexican.
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  That's not happening.
[39:02.000 --> 39:03.000]  The gringos aren't doing that.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  I dare you to find one case out of a million.
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.080]  Let me tell you who has killed hundreds of thousands of women and men and that's the
[39:09.080 --> 39:10.080]  Mexican gangs.
[39:10.080 --> 39:11.880]  But oh, let's not talk about those.
[39:11.880 --> 39:16.840]  Let's say Trump's building concentration camps were saving these children and not just throwing
[39:16.840 --> 39:21.480]  them to the forewinds when they just made it through the death race they were in.
[39:21.480 --> 39:51.200]  Here's the President by the Vice President of the United States.
[39:51.200 --> 39:53.720]  Thank you very much, everybody.
[39:53.720 --> 39:54.720]  Thank you very much.
[39:54.720 --> 39:57.320]  This is an incredible time for our country.
[39:57.320 --> 40:01.040]  I would say that our economy, and many of you know that very well, is doing better than
[40:01.040 --> 40:02.960]  it ever has done.
[40:02.960 --> 40:10.200]  Our employment numbers are the best that they've been, perhaps ever, but certainly in recorded
[40:10.200 --> 40:14.960]  history reports just came out, best in 44 years.
[40:14.960 --> 40:17.800]  Black unemployment is the lowest level in history.
[40:17.800 --> 40:21.160]  Hispanic unemployment, lowest level in history.
[40:21.160 --> 40:24.480]  Women unemployment, lowest level in 21 years.
[40:24.480 --> 40:31.400]  It started at 19, went up to 20, now it's up to 21, very soon it's going to be in history.
[40:31.400 --> 40:35.920]  We're doing numbers like we've never seen and we have some of the great industry leaders
[40:35.920 --> 40:40.640]  here today who I'm going to be introducing in a little while quickly and they're going
[40:40.640 --> 40:44.200]  to do so much with NASA and so many of the great things we're doing.
[40:44.200 --> 40:47.000]  But they understand full well what's happening.
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.680]  We've never seen a period of time like this.
[40:48.680 --> 40:53.240]  The whole world is looking up to the United States, and the United States is respected
[40:53.240 --> 40:54.240]  again.
[40:54.240 --> 40:58.240]  It was a period of time we were not so respected, not so long ago.
[40:58.240 --> 41:01.240]  The United States is respected again.
[41:01.240 --> 41:08.040]  If I might, I just wanted to make a brief statement on immigration and what's happening.
[41:08.040 --> 41:16.320]  And I'll say it very honestly, and I'll say it very straight, immigration is the fault
[41:16.320 --> 41:22.040]  and all of the problems that we're having, because we cannot get them to sign legislation.
[41:22.040 --> 41:26.000]  We cannot get them even to the negotiating table.
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.400]  And I say it's very strongly the Democrats' fault.
[41:30.400 --> 41:35.760]  They're obstruction, they're really obstructionist, and they are obstructing.
[41:35.760 --> 41:46.040]  The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility.
[41:46.040 --> 41:47.480]  It will be.
[41:47.480 --> 41:50.800]  You look at what's happening in Europe, you look at what's happening in other places,
[41:50.800 --> 41:56.200]  we can't allow that to happen to the United States, not on my watch.
[41:56.200 --> 42:01.720]  For the rest of the world, you look at everything that's taking place, pick up your newspapers
[42:01.720 --> 42:04.680]  this morning, and you see.
[42:04.680 --> 42:09.160]  We want safety and we want security for our country.
[42:09.160 --> 42:16.200]  If the Democrats would sit down instead of obstructing, we could have something done very
[42:16.200 --> 42:23.000]  quickly, good for the children, good for the country, good for the world.
[42:23.000 --> 42:24.880]  It could take place quickly.
[42:24.880 --> 42:30.280]  We could have an immigration bill, we could have child separation, we're stuck with these
[42:30.280 --> 42:32.920]  horrible laws.
[42:32.920 --> 42:34.840]  They're horrible laws.
[42:34.840 --> 42:39.840]  What's happening is so sad, is so sad.
[42:39.840 --> 42:44.920]  We're going to stop right there, that's right, a lot of these laws were passed by Bill Clinton.
[42:44.920 --> 42:49.840]  And he's trying to reform it, the Democrats just say total open borders, let the UN run
[42:49.840 --> 42:50.840]  it all.
[42:50.840 --> 42:55.280]  We've got more of this coming up, but first big exclusive news with Roger Stone, Matt

[46:59.680 --> 47:11.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:11.360 --> 47:14.760]  This is Roger Stone with Breaking News.
[47:14.760 --> 47:21.080]  Today I sent a letter to Chairman Devin Nunes of the House Intelligence Committee to inform
[47:21.080 --> 47:28.440]  him of yet another FBI effort to infiltrate the Trump campaign and compromise Donald Trump
[47:28.440 --> 47:29.880]  himself.
[47:29.880 --> 47:35.520]  In May of 2016, I was approached by a man named Henry Greenberg, or at least that's
[47:35.520 --> 47:41.840]  the alias that he used, who said he had valuable information on the Clintons.
[47:41.840 --> 47:48.200]  After meeting him for 20 minutes, he told me that the information would cost $2 million.
[47:48.200 --> 47:53.840]  When I told him that not only did I not have $2 million, but even if I did have it, I didn't
[47:53.840 --> 47:58.920]  pay for political information, he laughed and said it wasn't my money he wanted, it
[47:58.920 --> 48:01.080]  was Donald Trump's.
[48:01.080 --> 48:07.800]  I told him that Trump didn't pay for information either, and that was the end of the meeting.
[48:07.800 --> 48:15.840]  Now however, we have learned that Henry Greenberg is a long time Russian national, but an FBI
[48:15.840 --> 48:22.600]  informant who has had numerous waivers to get in and out of the country at the sufferance
[48:22.600 --> 48:24.320]  of the FBI.
[48:24.320 --> 48:31.280]  This is clearly like the situation with Steph Halper, yet another attempt to infiltrate
[48:31.280 --> 48:34.760]  and compromise the Trump campaign.
[48:34.760 --> 48:38.120]  This is Roger Stone with Breaking News.
[48:38.120 --> 48:44.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[48:44.200 --> 48:49.720]  Well it was Roger Stone that broke Steph on Halprin and the other mole and now the latest
[48:49.720 --> 48:53.960]  mole, and the media, even though he broke it, even though he told the Washington Post
[48:53.960 --> 48:58.200]  on Friday and told us on Friday, but we had to hold it till Sunday as part of an agreement
[48:58.200 --> 49:00.680]  with the Washington Post, so we simultaneously broke it.
[49:00.680 --> 49:02.600]  We were 30 minutes before them.
[49:02.600 --> 49:06.720]  It was 7 a.m. Eastern was the time we were able to break it.
[49:06.720 --> 49:11.000]  And there's his statement, but no one picked it up at drudgerport.com, that no, this is
[49:11.000 --> 49:16.080]  someone using a Western style name, not saying they're a Russian background, coming and saying
[49:16.080 --> 49:20.240]  we have dirt on Hillary, that's totally normal in a campaign to do opposition research.
[49:20.240 --> 49:24.320]  And then spinning it, that somehow, oh see, it's an undisclosed person, now that we know
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.280]  that they're going to bring him up and say, oh, he has Russian ties when Stone and Kapugado
[49:29.280 --> 49:31.120]  do not know about the Russian ties.
[49:31.120 --> 49:36.600]  But regardless, it changes the subject from, here they are trying to plant more moles, potential
[49:36.600 --> 49:41.320]  moles inside of the camp to create those connections to Russia that don't exist.
[49:41.320 --> 49:45.880]  And then counterterrorism expert, author, researcher, former Navy SEAL, Matt Bracken
[49:45.880 --> 49:48.360]  is going to add his analysis to this as well.
[49:48.360 --> 49:52.360]  He's riding shotgun with us, so Roger, I tell you, this is getting incredible.
[49:52.360 --> 49:57.240]  Well, the more we dig into it, the more incredible it is, Alex.
[49:57.240 --> 50:04.760]  In May of 2016, this is prior to Hillary raising the whole phony Russia issue, my associate
[50:04.760 --> 50:11.160]  Michael Kaputo, who's appeared here numerous times at Info Wars, was approached by a man
[50:11.160 --> 50:16.120]  who said he had valuable information for the Trump campaign.
[50:16.120 --> 50:21.960]  Kaputo asked me to meet with the man who, at that point, called himself Henry Greenberg.
[50:21.960 --> 50:25.080]  As we now know, that was an alias.
[50:25.080 --> 50:31.000]  And if you go to democrat.ca.org, you can see his real background.
[50:31.000 --> 50:40.640]  He is a 17-year paid informant for the FBI, a Russian national who spent 10 years in prison
[50:40.640 --> 50:48.120]  who was in the country in May 2016 through a special waiver approved by the FBI.
[50:48.120 --> 50:57.880]  How does a foreign organized crime associate with a 10-year violent prison record get into
[50:57.880 --> 51:04.840]  the country, except for he is sent to us in an effort to entrap myself and compromise
[51:04.840 --> 51:05.840]  Donald Trump?
[51:05.840 --> 51:07.840]  And by the way, that's all come out in the investigation.
[51:07.840 --> 51:14.080]  If I saw an excellent headline that describes all this, that out of town halls, I said Friday,
[51:14.080 --> 51:16.600]  overall, it's a whitewash, but admits bombshells.
[51:16.600 --> 51:20.120]  They say nobody did anything wrong, then they actually admit all the crimes in it.
[51:20.120 --> 51:22.800]  This is all confirmed, what you've been saying all along.
[51:22.800 --> 51:28.840]  Well, the mainstream media likes to go back to the fact that I didn't recall this meeting.
[51:28.840 --> 51:30.560]  I didn't recall it.
[51:30.560 --> 51:35.520]  Kaputo didn't recall it until Robert Mueller's investigators asked him all about it, and
[51:35.520 --> 51:38.960]  they knew all about it, how coincidental.
[51:38.960 --> 51:45.000]  Interestingly enough, they also had a text message between Kaputo and myself in which
[51:45.000 --> 51:50.400]  he asked me how the meeting went, and I told him it was a waste of time.
[51:50.400 --> 51:56.360]  But it's interesting, how did they get that text message if not through an illegal FISA
[51:56.360 --> 52:03.400]  warrant spying on me because I'm a 30-plus-year associate of Donald Trump's?
[52:03.400 --> 52:06.160]  The whole thing stinks of a setup.
[52:06.160 --> 52:11.440]  The mainstream media wants to focus on why I didn't remember an innocuous 20-minute meeting
[52:11.440 --> 52:17.520]  in which nothing inappropriate happened other than my flatly rejecting this effort to entrap
[52:17.520 --> 52:18.520]  us.
[52:18.520 --> 52:23.320]  Obviously, had Trump paid for this information, he would have been compromised, and I think
[52:23.320 --> 52:26.840]  that was the purpose of the actual meeting.
[52:26.840 --> 52:29.840]  And they sure tried absolutely hard.
[52:29.840 --> 52:33.200]  I notice even the Washington Post in places, they talk about this guy, they go, yeah, you
[52:33.200 --> 52:37.240]  worked for the FBI for 16 years, yeah, he's got a criminal background, okay, big deal.
[52:37.240 --> 52:40.320]  Oh, but you know, Stone doesn't really know they sent them.
[52:40.320 --> 52:45.760]  We have the documents, we have the emails, we have the admissions of people covering
[52:45.760 --> 52:50.040]  up for Hillary and real Russian collusion and all this other collusion with China, and
[52:50.040 --> 52:51.680]  then trying to project that on you.
[52:51.680 --> 52:57.360]  They covered up Spygate, illegal spying on you guys, with the whole new Russia gate.
[52:57.360 --> 52:59.680]  Where is Russia gate now at this point?
[52:59.680 --> 53:03.680]  I mean, I know it's falling apart, but at the same time, they just keep moving forward
[53:03.680 --> 53:09.520]  and the top search term yesterday and today is Roger Stone Trump, as this is the top story
[53:09.520 --> 53:14.040]  going, oh my God, we got him at Joy Bay are, yay, General Flynn says they're all Russian
[53:14.040 --> 53:18.080]  agents, Trump's going to hell, we're bringing the economy down, yep, yep, and of course
[53:18.080 --> 53:19.240]  none of it was true.
[53:19.240 --> 53:23.280]  So they just keep running the hoax when you're the one going public to Washington Post saying,
[53:23.280 --> 53:26.920]  hey, they keep asking me about a guy that had a five-minute meeting with, one of thousands
[53:26.920 --> 53:30.880]  of meetings that was, didn't even really say he was a Russian, he's got this anglicized
[53:30.880 --> 53:37.160]  sounding name, and then it's just incredible, it's like they take something, they take something
[53:37.160 --> 53:41.880]  where it's a point against them and then they act like it's something we've done.
[53:41.880 --> 53:47.000]  No, exactly right, they make a great deal of the fact that I honestly just didn't recall
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.480]  this meeting because it was so ludicrous.
[53:49.480 --> 53:56.080]  Not only does this guy show up wearing a mega hat, a Trump t-shirt, he shows me on his phone
[53:56.080 --> 54:01.600]  photographs of himself and a woman, his wife, his girlfriend, I don't know, at various Trump
[54:01.600 --> 54:06.720]  rallies, he's obviously trying to persuade me that he just wants to help Trump, and then
[54:06.720 --> 54:13.600]  he says he wants $2 million for unspecified information, doesn't say that it's emails
[54:13.600 --> 54:15.200]  by the way.
[54:15.200 --> 54:18.520]  The whole thing reeks of an FBI cover-up.
[54:18.520 --> 54:25.040]  How was he in the country at all given his record for gun violence in the USSR?
[54:25.040 --> 54:30.640]  Roger, Roger, these people have so much intelligence on us that I'm there with like Navy Seals
[54:30.640 --> 54:35.800]  who were off-duty, one of them a major leader in the underwater submarine operations, really
[54:35.800 --> 54:40.120]  secretive stuff, he didn't give me the info but I know who he is and talk to folks.
[54:40.120 --> 54:44.680]  The point is they come over to our table the night of the inauguration and we later learn
[54:44.680 --> 54:51.640]  and track all this and start saying, I want to buy submarine technology and I want you
[54:51.640 --> 54:55.960]  to meet with a representative of type one, they're patriots and the Navy SEAL guys are
[54:55.960 --> 54:59.920]  like, whoa, because no one even knew that they were in super secret submarine operations,
[54:59.920 --> 55:00.920]  but these people did.
[55:00.920 --> 55:04.760]  And then later we learned they posted photos at strategic places of us at that meeting
[55:04.760 --> 55:12.080]  online to start an investigation on me and those Navy SEALs and yes, later tried to go
[55:12.080 --> 55:14.240]  after that leader.
[55:14.240 --> 55:18.120]  So I'm telling you man, they are incredible.
[55:18.120 --> 55:23.000]  Well, and really when you, let me address the most important question.
[55:23.000 --> 55:27.000]  These illegal FISO warrants are their Achilles' heel.
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.400]  They refuse to admit in the Manafort matter that he was ever under surveillance in the
[55:31.400 --> 55:36.600]  discovery even though he's legally entitled to the evidence against him.
[55:36.600 --> 55:41.920]  The Rod Rosenstein and the Justice Department is stonewalling the House Intelligence Committee
[55:41.920 --> 55:44.400]  in their demands for this information.
[55:44.400 --> 55:48.600]  The fact that they have the text messages between Caputo and I, I believe those are
[55:48.600 --> 55:54.400]  the fruits of an illegal FISO warrant as reported by the New York Times on January 20th.
[55:54.400 --> 55:55.400]  Stay there.
[55:55.400 --> 55:57.560]  We're going to come back with more of this just briefly and I'm bringing Matt back
[55:57.560 --> 55:58.560]  in.
[55:58.560 --> 56:02.060]  I'm not even plugging this hour except free shipping is still here today and all the big
[56:02.060 --> 56:03.840]  specials today because I've been so busy.
[56:03.840 --> 56:07.360]  I haven't done new specials even though X2 and Rainforest are about to sell out.
[56:07.360 --> 56:08.360]  They're still 50% off.
[56:08.360 --> 56:12.800]  Folks, if you want to support the broadcast, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com or triple
[56:12.800 --> 56:16.720]  A-253-3139, please pray for us, spread the live links.
[56:16.720 --> 56:19.200]  We are tomorrow's news today as while we're under attack.
[56:19.200 --> 56:23.040]  Matt Bracken only brought up the Navy SEAL story, you're a former Navy SEAL, to like
[56:23.040 --> 56:29.880]  they know when I've got security or they even know on the day who I'm with, with people
[56:29.880 --> 56:34.240]  I've only been with for two days, trying to get me to do something illegal or trying
[56:34.240 --> 56:35.240]  to get my associates.
[56:35.240 --> 56:38.520]  I mean, they are on our butts trying to plant something.
[56:38.520 --> 56:44.440]  Well, remember, they can listen to your phones 24-7 unless you take the battery out or stick
[56:44.440 --> 56:46.640]  it in a ammo can or something.
[56:46.640 --> 56:50.280]  So your phone is an eavesdropping device and a geo tracker.
[56:50.280 --> 56:55.760]  So every time you use a credit card, it pings at their headquarters.
[56:55.760 --> 56:59.120]  So if they want to follow you and know what you're talking about, who you're with, they
[56:59.120 --> 57:00.120]  know.
[57:00.120 --> 57:05.040]  It's something that, this is something that Roger mentioned this morning on Laura Ingram.
[57:05.040 --> 57:11.640]  This is similar, the Greenberg setup is similar to the Trump Tower meeting in that the Russian
[57:11.640 --> 57:17.120]  lawyer, Vessel Metskaya, she needed a special State Department visa to get into the USA.
[57:17.120 --> 57:23.480]  Then she meets Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS before and after the Trump Tower meeting.
[57:23.480 --> 57:26.040]  So I mean, this is clearly another setup.
[57:26.040 --> 57:29.560]  It's all part of the same insurance policy.
[57:29.560 --> 57:32.320]  Let's talk about this deep state war, Matt and with Roger.
[57:32.320 --> 57:33.880]  We come back in just two minutes.
[57:33.880 --> 57:34.880]  What's their next move?
[57:34.880 --> 57:36.400]  Let's take a look at a lot of their moves accurately.
[57:36.400 --> 57:40.560]  Matt Bracken, counterterrorism expert, of course, we've got Roger, the center of this.
[57:40.560 --> 57:42.480]  What does he expect is coming next?
[57:42.480 --> 57:46.920]  We know, as he said a few weeks ago, they're zeroing in on Roger Stone and me.
[57:46.920 --> 57:53.560]  About 25% of the time spent on Alex Jones.
[57:53.560 --> 57:58.520]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[57:58.520 --> 57:59.520]  yeast.
[57:59.520 --> 58:03.080]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew
[58:03.080 --> 58:07.040]  we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[58:07.040 --> 58:12.160]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed
[58:12.160 --> 58:15.760]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[58:15.760 --> 58:18.320]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[58:18.320 --> 58:23.080]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive
[58:23.080 --> 58:27.720]  tract and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[58:27.720 --> 58:31.840]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, poudarco
[58:31.840 --> 58:36.440]  bark and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test
[58:36.440 --> 58:39.440]  of time as powerful microbalancing properties.
[58:39.440 --> 58:44.280]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at infowarslife.com.
[58:44.280 --> 59:05.640]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from infowars.com, when you spread the videos,
[59:05.640 --> 59:14.880]  that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[59:14.880 --> 59:15.880]  You are the InfoWars.
[59:15.880 --> 59:20.960]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[59:20.960 --> 59:26.040]  go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[59:26.040 --> 59:31.920]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[59:31.920 --> 59:37.440]  So now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[59:37.440 --> 59:39.840]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[59:39.840 --> 59:45.280]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward
[59:45.280 --> 59:46.920]  slash newsletter.
[59:46.920 --> 59:57.320]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[59:57.320 --> 01:00:23.320]  Welcome back Alex Jones here, I was talking to Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, best selling
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.320]  author, counterterrorism expert, and Roger Stoner in the break about why I was bringing
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:33.200]  up the Navy SEAL story, about guys I was with, I'm just going to leave it at that, and some
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.320]  other folks there at the inauguration, some of the things we were doing.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.680]  Just two days into it, they already had people on us that knew classified backgrounds on
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:44.520]  people we were with and were actually stragging up conversations with them on the street and
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:50.920]  bars to try to get a meeting or get us to say something so that they could then, Bracken
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:54.800]  explained to them what they're doing, and I'm not trying to insert myself in the story,
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.800]  I'm in the story.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:00.600]  25% of the time Caputo said the FBI brought me up, Roger's talked to a dozen other people
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:04.240]  or more that say the same thing, they're now trying to act like me and Stone are master
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.760]  mining, but the point you made during the break was key, please make that.
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:14.560]  This is a full spectrum intel operation, the tactics and the techniques that they learned
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.520]  that the CIA and others learned and used during the Cold War and the war on terror against
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:25.520]  legitimate foreign enemies, they've now brought home and have turned against domestic opposition.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.920]  It's just the point of having the meeting is just to have the meeting, like the Trump
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.720]  Tower meeting, doesn't matter what they talked about.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:40.680]  The fact that a compromised or guilty looking Russian lawyer is in the same room with Donald
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.040]  Jr. for two minutes or whatever, that's the goal.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:52.880]  Whether meeting Stefan Halper or Alexander Downer in London, if you have the meeting,
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:58.840]  it can then be leaked to the media as a guilty meeting, proof of collusion.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:04.800]  This is actually going to blow up on them because using this guy, Greenberg, whatever
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:11.200]  his real name is, the Russian, it's so clumsy, a Trump T-shirt, it's such a clumsy method
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.280]  of entrapment.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:16.880]  They obviously dropped it, his handlers, his FBI handlers, after the meeting said, well,
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:23.080]  forget this, it's gone nowhere, Roger Stone didn't bite, but what it did was it established
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.080]  the pattern.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.120]  This is part of Strach's insurance policy that he discussed in his emails.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.760]  This is where it's going to really blow up though.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:37.640]  Just a second, Strach is an old friend of Rudy Contreras, judge on the FISA court, the
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:44.400]  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, this is why the DOJ has been going to the mattresses
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:50.680]  risking impeachment, risking contempt of Congress, because when it comes out that Strach didn't
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:54.920]  need any help at FISA court, he could have put in a blank sheet of paper in that the
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:59.960]  FISA court is also corrupt, then this scandal blows up supernova.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.200]  I think you just knocked it out of the park there, I mean that's absolutely right, we're
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.920]  going to break here in a few minutes, but man that's huge what Matt Bracken just talked
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.920]  about, Roger.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.080]  No, I think Matt just nailed it.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.680]  The FISA warrants are their Achilles heel.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.720]  They are at the centerpiece of the Manafort case, they're at the centerpiece at their
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:25.800]  effort to frame me for some bogus offense to silence me.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:31.080]  I'm being persecuted because I supported Donald Trump and for no other reason.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:37.200]  I've committed no crime and they know that, so they go out and try to manufacture one.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:43.160]  This is going to be a complete struggle and it appears that Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:49.360]  and now even Paul Ryan have laid down the gauntlet for DOJ, turn over the information
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:56.720]  regarding the FISA warrants and who was being spied on or face an insurrection in the Congress.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.560]  Didn't we see with that report that got no attention last year when we come back, we'll
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:07.600]  talk about this, where the FISA court overseers put out a report saying they'd been lied to
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.240]  and that they'd been given info that wasn't true and improper warrants, and I think that's
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:15.800]  the FISA court preemptively trying to cover their butt way ahead of time, Matt.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.600]  Yeah, but that went away.
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:22.160]  That turned very quiet when it turned out that Peter Strock is a pre-existing friend
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.600]  of close friend of Judge Rudy Contreras.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:30.640]  There's a redacted text where it says, blank, and it's presumed to be Contreras, wants
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.360]  us to have a meeting, but we need to bring up some other, bring some other people for
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.760]  cover for action.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:42.560]  That's a tradecraft term showing guilty knowledge that this meeting would be completely guilty.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:46.160]  So cover for action in that text message is damning.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.520]  I don't know why people haven't picked up on that one, it's huge.
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:53.160]  I'm telling you folks, everybody's sick of Russiagate, so am I, but Russiagate spied
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:58.200]  on Russiagate and brings them down, that deep state's going down.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:04.560]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:10.920]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:18.200]  or videos or other material from infostore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.400]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.320]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.760]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.920]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.920]  children and adults.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:38.160]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:43.880]  and iodine as well, infowarslife.com, or triple-A-253-3139.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:48.280]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.160]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:54.280]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:06:13.400]  against us so we need your support.
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:32.240]  All right, this segment with Roger Stone and Matt Bracken, I want to get more into Russiagate,
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:38.320]  that's really a cover for Spygate, and what the Inspector General report shows, and what
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.280]  they think Mueller and the Deep States can do next.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:47.000]  But I told the story about people trying to get me when I'm with Navy SEALs to sell them
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  submarine technology.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.920]  It's not about me, it's about, they're going around in a full spectrum intelligence operation
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:07:00.280]  that Bracken talked about, trying to get us just to joke around about something illegal.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.800]  And this is how they then open up investigations, it's how they leak things.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:07.840]  Matt Bracken was getting into that earlier.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:12.680]  But now, what does it mean, this is a selfish question, Roger Stone and Matt Bracken jump
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:16.400]  in, and then recap what you were saying earlier, that's so huge about Strock's connection to
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:20.640]  the FISA court judge, that's amazing, we want to elaborate on that more.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:27.840]  But what does it symbolize Stone and Bracken, of how desperate they are, the Deep State
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:34.480]  Clinton stay behind networks that are still in there but being exposed, that I'm 25% of
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:39.200]  the time and the questions for Caputo, who's been on the show and talked about it and others,
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:46.600]  getting into what we do, where we go, what we eat, Trump's sex life, our sex life, because
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:50.640]  I know I'm not connected to Russia, and I know they know that, that is insane.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:56.040]  So what does that say as they tighten the news down, tighten the net down, that they're
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:00.840]  targeting me, because I mean, Roger, you have no Russian connections either, but you've
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.160]  been one of the big fish, you've known Trump for 40 years, they've been saying you're the
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:08.080]  bad guy day one, to try to bring me into central casting, what does that signify?
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:13.280]  Well, Alex, today at two o'clock in front of the chief judge, there's a hearing over
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:18.520]  an attempt to subpoena a man who once worked for me named Andrew Miller.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:23.760]  Andrew Miller was my right hand man for a number of years, and the FBI showed up at
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:30.880]  his St. Louis home roughly two weeks ago to question him extensively about my relationship
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.960]  with Alex Jones.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:39.120]  Now, his lawyer is resisting an attempt to drag him in front of the grand jury to testify.
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:43.040]  He did not work for me during the 2016 campaign.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:50.520]  He has no knowledge of the Trump campaign support or the Trump efforts that I made independently,
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.880]  but they are struggling to bring him in front of a grand jury.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:58.880]  Why are they asking questions about my relationship with Info Wars and Alex Jones?
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.000]  Why are you being targeted?
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.280]  Why do they want to silence us?
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:09.200]  Why are they moving to the chief judge in an attempt to force this young man to testify?
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.840]  It's outrageous, but I think it shows you where they want to go.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:19.640]  They're going to seek to frame me and perhaps you in some bogus crime that does not exist
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:25.640]  because they want to silence Info Wars, because we're the cutting edge, we're the tip of the
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:31.600]  spear, and we hurt them every day by bringing people like Matt Bracken on to tell people
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:32.600]  what is really happening.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.600]  Exactly.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.600]  It's not Alex Jones.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:40.400]  It's the platform, but it is surreal to then, dozens of people, some have told me on air,
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.400]  some in private.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:45.000]  Yeah, they just keep obsessing with you and how you're a mastermind and you work with
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.800]  Trump and that's not really true.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.800]  I mean, the president said, I like what you're doing, press the attack, keep it up.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.760]  I'm not going to let you down.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:52.760]  Don't let me down.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.760]  I mean, that's it.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.760]  He's the president.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:10:00.320]  You know, they act like it's a bad thing that, you know, some of these folks are like
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:04.560]  a naval intelligence, but then it's private, like Jack Pasobic, and they go, he has to
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.880]  be kicked out of the Navy.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:08.400]  You can't have someone in intelligence talking to the president.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.160]  I mean, this idea that Americans can't communicate and try to bring the country back.
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.320]  Matt Bracken, what do you make of all this and what do you think's coming next?
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:24.000]  The larger picture that the, you know, the sky camera view is about controlling the narratives.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.400]  And you can see this, whether it was fast and furious, which was sold as 90% of the
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:34.640]  guns in Mexican crimes, complete, you know, operation, a deadly operation, the Benghazi
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.400]  video false narrative.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.040]  What we're seeing is an effort to control the narrative.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:44.720]  If they can restrict it, say to Fox News and have people just say, oh, the only place that's
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.520]  been reported is on Hannity and who's he's a kook.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:53.360]  Well, info wars is cutting edge info wars is the tip of the spear, like you said.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:57.800]  And it's a question of discrediting info wars, eventually taking it down.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:02.120]  But if they can't take it off the air, they want to discredit it so that anything that
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.880]  comes out of here is tainted.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.720]  That's why, you know, it's very rare for a guy like Jack Busovic, he can be on or Tony
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:14.320]  Schaefer, Colonel Tony Schaefer, Roger Stone, I could probably on one hand, name the people
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:19.400]  that have appeared on info wars that are also allowed inside the Fox building, they'll never
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.760]  be anywhere else.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:26.880]  So if they can, if they can contain the this leading edge of information to what they want
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.640]  to portray as kook world, that's part of discrediting.
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:33.280]  Matt, that is the smartest thing you've ever said, because if you read media matters and
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:37.720]  the globalists, they keep saying, Jones, and my guess, that's you continue to be patient
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:38.720]  zero.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.720]  They see us as a disease.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.440]  Stelter calls us a disease that must be eradicated.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:46.880]  And then Tucker Carlson says, don't trust CNN, they go, help dare you hurt democracy.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.440]  They want to take us off the air.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.440]  We're just saying they're liars.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.120]  But that's it they say, we must shut down info wars, because time and time again, it
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.520]  creates the countervailing narrative that the public believes instead of theirs, because
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.520]  our narratives true.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.520]  But that's it.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.520]  They just don't like that.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.840]  They keep seeing the narrative come out of info wars.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:04.840]  Go ahead.
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:13.080]  And meanwhile, you've got Morrell, who was the deputy CIA during the flap where what's
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.480]  his name during Benghazi was fired.
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:20.400]  He's a stooge for the deep state, he goes to work, I think, for CBS, you've got, you've
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:25.880]  got Clapper, Brennan, now Hayden's coming out calling Trump a Nazi, putting up a picture
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:28.320]  of Auschwitz over these things.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.720]  So you've got the deep state heavyweights, Brennan, Clapper, Hayden, they're going to
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.720]  the mattress.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.280]  This is do or die.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:42.240]  If it turns out that struck, you know, off duty, contacted Contreras of the FISA court,
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.680]  and that the original warrants are going to look damningly guilty.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:50.400]  This is going to, it'd be impossible for them to contain.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.320]  So this week could be like, you know, major tectonic plates.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.320]  No, I agree.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.320]  And they've committed so many crimes.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:00.480]  If you look at that arrogant little elf, Hayden and all of them, they look really scared
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.480]  for the first time.
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.480]  Obama looked scared.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.480]  Hillary looked scared.
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.480]  Trump's winning.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.480]  We're winning, Roger.
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:06.480]  What do you say?
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.120]  Well, I think you're exactly right, yet at the same time, I have to deal with this effort
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:18.920]  to crank up and frame me for some crime, which is why I must ask people to go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:24.000]  Mueller is gunning for me, and Alex, I think he's gunning for you, and we have to be prepared.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  This is going to cost literally hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.400]  Yeah, I'm going to tell the listeners that.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.280]  Everybody says they want to take America back and they want to fight the globalists.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.840]  We are frontline.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.720]  We are their main enemy because we don't pull punches.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:40.520]  And absolutely, if we don't get massive funding, we won't be able to do the expansion.
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:43.600]  And then they're going to start winning and pushing us backward.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:47.480]  They have to see us win in court, which we're starting to do, and expand.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:50.760]  I'm very close to having the next cruise ready to launch a bunch of new shows, talking to
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.040]  Matt Bracken about that in the next week, Matt, because I've got to get a bunch of people
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.040]  together on this.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.400]  And we've got the satellites, TV stations picking us up.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.160]  They know we're winning.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.440]  They know we've got a model like Sinclair to go to local TV stations, and it's already
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.880]  happening and having more success than I even thought it would.
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:08.160]  And that's why they are going into connection fits.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:12.480]  So, yeah, we sold a lot of product over the weekend, but it's already 50% discounted,
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.000]  so it doesn't really fund us a lot.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.320]  We had some moderate donations, but you know, people like to buy the products out of donations.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:24.720]  If you ever wanted to be in the fight against the globalist, then you need to go to infowars.com,
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:25.720]  and you need to go to infowars.com.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:29.680]  There's a link there to donate.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.680]  You need to go to Rogers Jones defense fund, but infowars.com forward slash donate.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:39.000]  Jones legal, Alex Jones, can we put that back up, just freeze that for me because I don't
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.880]  have it in my sheet here, thanks.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.240]  Alexjoneslegalfund.com, Alexjonesdefensefund.com, and make a major donation.
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.560]  Now, if you can afford it, make a big donation, or if you only can afford $10.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:54.760]  The point is, we are in the gun size because we're changing the country and changing the
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:55.760]  world.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:56.760]  Go get a bunch of products.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.560]  Free shipping was already supposed to end, but I've been too busy when I have a new special.
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:03.200]  Free shipping is still there, and these giant discounts, 50% off, but those have got to
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:07.480]  end today after I get off the demo coat with some new specials, but they won't be dramatic
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.480]  like this.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.080]  I want to do one more segment with you gentlemen, and just try to let you guys have the floor
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:15.400]  bracket and then stone about what you expect to come next.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:20.680]  This whole hoax that Trump's putting children in concentration camps when it's the UN, and
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:24.960]  the Democrats have all actually been caught doing all this, and where you see this going,
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:31.800]  and I see Trump winning right now, but as you said, these arrogant, cornered, crazy SOBs
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.680]  aren't going to stop, so you guys have been really accurate predicting what's going to
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:35.680]  come next.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:41.000]  We'll hit that, and then, ladies and gentlemen, we are joined by George Norrie to get his
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  take on all this, and so much more.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.480]  So, that's coming up, and then Ali Alexander is hosting the fourth hour, and he didn't
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:54.560]  have open phones in the third hour, infowars.com, newswars.com, and Bracken's site as enemies

[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:38.840]  By the end of the broadcast today, right when the war room is kicking off with Owen Shroyer
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:45.680]  and Roger Stone, we're going to have an exclusive analysis, believe me if we weren't exclusive
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:48.880]  I'd just post somebody else's article, I just want the info to get out.
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:55.240]  Our crew noticed on page 302 of the 500 page report that mainstream media said totally
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:21:00.240]  exonerated the Clintons in the FBI day one before they'd read it.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.960]  Yeah, they said the FBI didn't do anything wrong according to them because they're not
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:09.520]  a judge or jury, but they said here's the facts, 302 I guess is the name of an FBI field
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:10.520]  report.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:15.040]  Finally, they coded the message because on page 302, I think that's a coded message,
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:20.240]  they point out that it was the FBI internally that had whistleblowers that were upset about
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:23.840]  what was on Wiener's laptop and a cover-up of that, and that's why they reopened the
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:28.120]  investigation so they could pun it back down to the police in New York.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:34.720]  We were told all that by guests on this show in New York when it all happened, in fact
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.520]  that was broken by Doug Hagman here, and then of course Eric Prince came out to Breitbart
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.520]  and talked about it, so that's in there too.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:44.960]  There's a lot of things that are the breadcrumbs in that IG report.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:49.840]  Let me ask Matt Bracken and then Roger Stone, why do you think this report on the surface
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:53.320]  looks like it's a whitewash, but then there's bombshells everywhere?
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:59.560]  Well, they took a giant tub of stinking excrement and then they put in a pink box and put a
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:04.520]  ribbon on it and said, there's no proof, like there's no confession, yes, I Peter Strock
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:09.920]  did all of this from my bias, so it's like when, as has been pointed out, it's like
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:16.640]  when Comey did his indictment followed by exoneration speech, the excrement is still
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:23.360]  inside of the pink box, but I'd like to say something about the FBI and the other federal
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.600]  law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies.
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:31.320]  I keep hearing about that it's only a few bad apples on the seventh floor of the FBI.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:37.600]  If that was so, we'd be seeing whistleblowers incognito behind a screen with a muffled voice
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.160]  saying what they knew.
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:44.880]  The problem is that the FBI and other agencies have been hiring social justice warriors for
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.880]  a generation now.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:51.960]  I mean, look at Brennan, he admitted on polygraph in 1980 that he voted for the communist ticket
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:52.960]  in 1976.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:58.000]  They said, come on in, he might as well have had mole on his forehead, so it don't expect
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.440]  help from the rank and file FBI, they're practically as bad as Strock.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:08.040]  The old school that we are, our generation that was raised to defend the Constitution
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.120]  against all enemies foreign and domestic, we're considered dinosaurs.
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.960]  No, you're right, that's a major problem.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:18.080]  How do we remove, I mean like a reality winner who was an ISIS and al-Qaeda operative, how
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.720]  do we remove these mentally ill SJWs from the government?
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.800]  I mean, they infested.
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:26.720]  I don't think that we do under the current structure, they're too deeply embedded.
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:31.120]  They want to get rid of Strock like you said.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:36.760]  There's a great article in front page MAG today about the corrupt bureaucracy, the federal
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:42.560]  bureaucracy, they've been hiring their own ilk now for a generation and it putrifies
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:49.080]  and the filth rises to the top, that's who they hire and then they filter out the patriots
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:50.960]  and they reward the traitors.
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:55.800]  Just look at these guys like Brennan, Comey, Clapper, Morel, they're all on network news
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:59.320]  lying, they're complete counter-patriots.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:03.520]  And what's crazy is how arrogant they are, Roger Stone, where's this going, what's the
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.520]  next shoot-a-drop?
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:10.280]  Well, not only are they on network news lying, they're being paid to do it.
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:18.120]  Look, this confrontation between the House and the Justice Department is our best hope.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:23.760]  And frankly, Paul Ryan, the speaker, had been dragged ticking and screaming to the investigation.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:30.880]  Devon Nunes is a hero and he has to undergo the slings and arrows of the mainstream media
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.800]  every single day.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.000]  Their Achilles heel are the Faisal warrants.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.960]  We have to fight to uncover what is there because that is what makes the whole dirty
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:44.480]  cover-up unravel.
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:48.080]  The Inspector General's report is a bureaucratic whitewash.
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:51.880]  They lay out all the crimes and then they try to excuse them.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:55.840]  That performance by the FBI Director Ray was embarrassing.
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.840]  He admitted to nothing.
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:59.080]  We're going to have sensitivity training.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.120]  There was no political bias.
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:04.320]  There are no crimes here, folks, just keep moving.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:07.080]  He is not the man to clean up the FBI.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:11.320]  The president commends him in a tweet, I don't see how he can.
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:14.040]  Why doesn't the FBI Director clean house?
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.040]  He won't.
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:19.000]  The House cleaning at the FBI needs to begin with the new director.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.160]  He is part and parcel of the deep state.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:28.880]  This is something that Gowdy Nunez said over the weekend.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:34.320]  Maria Bartiromo has got an outstanding segment with Devin Nunez from Sunday morning with
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.400]  Maria Bartiromo.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:42.960]  Both Nunez and Gowdy now say to Ray and Rosenstein, do you want to be part of the cover-up team
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.960]  or the clean-up team?
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:49.320]  What I think he is saying is you're going to go down with the rats on the sinking ship
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.560]  if you try to maintain this cover-up.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:54.240]  You've got to now pick a side.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.440]  It's like the Berlin Wall.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:57.480]  You've got to jump one way or the other.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:03.160]  You've got to decide if you're on our side, the clean-up team or the cover-up team.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:08.200]  When all this vice of stuff is unwrapped finally, anybody who's been covering it up, they should
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.200]  go to prison.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:15.800]  And by the way, the fact that we see Giuliani saying that Comey should go to prison and
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:19.400]  this is a criminal cover-up and others should go to prison, that's the mouth of the president
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:20.400]  saying we're moving that direction.
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.280]  And some say, well, why give them amnesty if they join us?
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.480]  That's how we win this war quickly, folks.
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:28.280]  As if we say, you're going to get amnesty, just come over now.
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:29.280]  You know we're winning.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.280]  And that's the truth.
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:34.840]  And I think a lot of these rats should realize they're not going to keep their job, but they're
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.000]  not going to go to prison.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.400]  They need to get out of the way.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.440]  That's a smart move, isn't it, Matt?
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.560]  That's why Strach is saying he'll testify in Congress without an offer of immunity because
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:50.440]  Strach, the only way out for Strach now, after all of his text messages, is to say, I've
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:55.640]  us just following orders, remember the text- Oh, that's a major point that he's getting
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:56.640]  ready to roll on.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:57.640]  Do you agree with that, Roger?
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:02.960]  I really do, because at the end of the day, the real question here is, what did Obama
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.040]  know and when did he know it?
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:09.040]  Strach says in his text messages, the president wants to know everything.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:17.120]  Susan Rice writes a CYA memo for the file that kind of gives you the game.
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.400]  Strach Obama is the head of the rotted fish.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.640]  He is running and approving this entire...
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.640]  That's right.
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.960]  At the end of the day, he's doing it for Hillary and the Democrats, and that's why he's been
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.600]  laying low.
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.600]  That's exactly right.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.040]  Vessel and its guy, the attorney, got the special visa through the State Department.
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:35.960]  That's not Strach at the FBI.
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.360]  That's State Department.
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:41.640]  Where do State Department, CIA, FBI, where do they all meet?
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.320]  Only one place, White House.
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.320]  That's right.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:47.920]  We knew this, you said this a year and a half ago, Roger, that sources in Intel that this
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.880]  was Samantha Powers, all of them.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:52.400]  They're just all in there with the NSA, all of them.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.040]  That's why these crooks are also scared.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:01.120]  All roads lead to Barack Obama as the master criminal who was trying to wire things for
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.120]  Hillary.
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:07.040]  The reason they were so arrogant in their text messages, in their emails, in their actions,
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.520]  it was because they were so certain she would win.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:11.680]  They were calling her the president.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:12.680]  Exactly.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:13.680]  Exactly.
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:14.680]  That's right.
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:18.280]  Mike Rogers, Mike Rogers of the NSA will be the big white hat.
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:22.280]  When he testifies, he'll be the Ollie North times a thousand.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.280]  That's right.
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:26.440]  He's the one that when the president was president-elect, he ran over there and spilled the beans
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:27.440]  of the president.
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:28.440]  Thank God.
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:30.440]  Thank God for Rogers.
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:31.440]  God.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.440]  God.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.440]  Oh, he'd been so much trouble.
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.440]  I wanted one for that.
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:35.440]  Okay.

[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:31.040]  of clips and more of the president's speech today about this whole hoax that he's putting
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.640]  kids in concentration camps.
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:37.240]  You know, we've documented real FEMA emergency centers for societal collapse.
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:42.080]  We've documented congressional hearings on plans to put political dissidents in facilities.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:45.680]  I mean, I've got the documents, the executive orders, I've made films.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:50.960]  I investigated FEMA camps and most of the ones people said were FEMA camps were immigrant
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:54.480]  centers and some of them had kids on them.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:59.560]  I've been involved in national TV shows with those with Jesse Ventura and we discovered
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:04.160]  this where they kept kids.
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.280]  And Obama did it and Trump's been trying to change the law.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.520]  But what do you do with a family or a bunch of people show you don't put them in general
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:13.520]  population kids with a bunch of other adults.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.880]  So they are certainly spinning all of that.
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:20.680]  We'll get George Norrie's take on that, George Norrie's take on the world in general here
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:21.680]  in just a moment.
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:25.760]  I've been wanting to get George on for a while and then I had an idea.
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.120]  I thought, why not twist his arm to come on the show?
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:29.120]  He's a busy guy.
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:33.560]  He's up at night with his, well, you could argue the top radio show in the world.
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.560]  It's definitely in the top two.
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:37.240]  And of course that's coast to coast to AM with George Norrie.
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:40.960]  So we're going to be going to him here in just a moment to cover that in the waterfront.
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:49.240]  But before we go any further here, please don't forget this broadcast is funded by you.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:53.960]  Yeah, the radio network has its ads and I've got some ads I run on the air, but we mainly
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:58.000]  sell our own products to fund ourselves.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.400]  And this is the final day because I've been so busy out of the new specials of free shipping
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:06.920]  on all our best selling items and 50% off on brain force, the real Red Pill Plus, Super
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:10.800]  Mill Vitality X2, even though the supply of that is very, very low.
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:14.040]  If you haven't tried brain force or X2, those two alone, they're amazing.
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.040]  We've got prostagarb, we've got lung cleanse.
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:19.200]  These are real game changers.
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:25.960]  Great books, great films, great t-shirts, great water filtration, excellent air filtration.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:30.600]  Whatever the best systems are, and then things that I personally use, we order it and then
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:31.960]  sell it at a discount.
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:32.960]  Take knockout.
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:36.360]  On average, it's 19 bucks for a bottle of melatonin.
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:39.560]  I found out how much good melatonin is, about a dollar per bottle.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:42.280]  I said, well, why are people selling it for 20, 30 bucks?
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.440]  I said, I like to take L-trip to Phan and Valerian route, some other stuff at the same
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:51.320]  time, that'd be 50, 60 bucks to have all those different pills when I do need help sleeping,
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:55.520]  which is not that often, but it happens.
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:58.280]  I went and checked with the experts and said, it's totally safe to put eight different things
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:02.440]  together, all the same regular dose for the same price of one.
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:06.920]  Eight products in there for the price of one of the products, but they sell it to you.
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:09.920]  That's the markup they do.
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:10.920]  That's the markup, folks.
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.040]  They put a dollar a product and then it's sold for 19 bucks, but I put eight different
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:15.040]  products in it.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:19.360]  It's the same normal amount, it's a big old pill, and then boom, sell it to you for $19.
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:24.520]  It's on sale right now, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:25.520]  Go read the reviews.
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:30.120]  I'm not going to go over all these reviews while George is there, but that's how we fund
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:31.120]  our operation.
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:37.520]  So, joining us is George Norrie, and of course, you hear him coast to coast over 650 radio
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:38.520]  stations.
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:40.880]  He's also on in Europe and Canada and Guam.
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:45.120]  He's one of the only U.S. shows that's been exported worldwide with great success.
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:52.160]  The reason I love George is, he was the only guy in 2003, back when infowars was pretty
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:56.360]  big, but not like it is now, that had the guts to put us on here.
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:01.760]  And so, he's a real trailblazer, and everybody else has me on, and they get threatened to
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:03.640]  not have me on, and they don't have me on.
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:06.520]  Doesn't matter if I go on somebody's show and it's the number one podcast they ever
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:09.880]  have, they get told, don't do it or iTunes won't promote you, and they roll over.
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:14.520]  George Norrie went to bat for me and was under a lot of pressure, but thanks to him, infowars
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:15.520]  has reached out a lot of folks.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:19.080]  So, I always like to thank George when he comes on, and I want to get into the passing
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.080]  of the great Art Bell.
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.080]  I wanted to get you all about that.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:26.800]  I want to get into the situation going on with, you know, the lies about what's happened
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:27.800]  with the kids.
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:30.800]  Maybe you disagree, and then I want to get into just where you see the planet and this
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:35.760]  whole great quickening or change you predicted so many years ago that would happen.
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:41.200]  So, thank you for coming on with us, coasttocoastam.com, George, good to have you with us.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:43.240]  Alex, I feel like your big brother.
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:44.240]  Oh, yeah.
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:45.720]  Good, it's good to have you here.
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:51.720]  You're also a, how many time Emmy Award-winning TV producer, news producer as well?
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:57.720]  Three times, and I've got the honor and distinction, Alex, that I've been nominated to the National
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.000]  Radio Hall of Fame.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.520]  Today's the last day of voting.
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:06.400]  Your listeners and viewers can push me to the top if we get this thing done today.
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:07.400]  Absolutely.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:11.280]  I mentioned this a few weeks ago, and people say, oh, this is how you thank George Norrie
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:13.040]  for everything he's done.
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:15.400]  He deserves to be in the Radio Hall of Fame.
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:19.920]  It also means a lot to advertisers and things, and it's just, it's really good for George
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:23.880]  to get this recognition, and I saw this and wanted to invite him on.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.440]  I told him last week, and I said, hey, can I get you on to promote that?
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:27.440]  It's about the stuff?
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.840]  Because, you know, he's a busy guy, and he said, yeah, it's important, I guess, you
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:33.800]  know, so I asked George to come on to do this, and how do people do it?
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:37.120]  I mean, I've got several ways for him to do it.
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:42.360]  It's radiovote.com, radiovote.com, but they can also text, can't they?
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:45.120]  How do people make sure you go to number one?
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:46.600]  This is what you do, Alex.
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:52.480]  First of all, if you have 90 different cell phones and 15 different e-mail addresses,
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:57.240]  you can vote 105 times, that's what they permit that.
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:58.600]  So this is what you do.
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:09.800]  In terms of text, everybody grab your phone, send a text message to 9600, 96000, 9600, and
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:17.280]  then in the message, you just put the number 700, that's my code to register a vote three.
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:24.720]  So 96000 is like the phone number you send the text to, and then 700 is the message.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:31.600]  If you also vote by e-mail, you go to radiovote.com, and you have to vote in two categories.
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:38.240]  One for somebody in music, and then someone in talk, which is my area, and then just vote
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:43.160]  for whoever you want in the music section, and then just click me at radiovote.com in
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:45.320]  the talk section, and they record it.
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:50.440]  But again, if you've got 15 different e-mail addresses, you can vote 15 times.
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:54.800]  So I'm looking at who you're up against, and some of them are some nice folks, but give
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.800]  me a break.
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:59.600]  George, you arguably are the number one radio host in the world, and you're on at night,
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:03.480]  which even, I mean, you've got 60%, I know, of the overnight radio listening audience
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:07.320]  of the U.S., and you've just done so much for Liberty Movement, you were the first big
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:12.520]  guy to expose vaccines on a national platform, and I don't know how you were able to do it,
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:16.400]  because I know that they put the screws to people.
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:20.720]  You haven't really told me this, but I know some of the things that have gone on, and
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:21.720]  that's a question.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:25.640]  How were you able to take coast to coast from 80% entertainment, which is still fun and
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:31.560]  good, nobody's saying it's bad, to 70% real news and 30% fun?
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:34.800]  I mean, I think you almost flipped it and made it even more popular.
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:37.000]  How were you able to do that?
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.720]  The world changed it, Alex.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:40.840]  So many things have been happening on this planet.
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:46.240]  They're still happening on this planet, that it was almost irresponsible just to go on
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:50.880]  the air and do the entertainment end of the show, which is fun and important, and I love
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.000]  that.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.480]  But to be able to do that every night, I think was a little inappropriate and irresponsible.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:02.000]  There's just too many things happening on this planet right now with the Deep State and
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  everything else.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.120]  Oh, you were covering Deep State when you were the number one host in St. Louis 25 years
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:08.120]  ago.
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:09.120]  I was covering it.
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:10.120]  Absolutely.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:12.600]  Yeah, but I mean, you were the guy that brought Deep State, remember, it was all over the
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:17.400]  news when you had me on CNN, C-Span, don't have Alex Jones on, Bohemian Grove doesn't
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:21.280]  exist, global, remember, global government didn't exist.
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:23.040]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:29.120]  And you have been sadly misquoted on a number of things that you've said on your show and
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:35.200]  my show where people just take things out of context, the things that you've done.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:37.960]  And I'd love putting you on so we could straighten it out.
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:41.480]  You know, it's funny you say that because I was, I've had family stuff and a baby came
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:44.680]  in, I've had no sleep, but now I'm better, the baby's big and sleeps through the night
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:45.680]  now.
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:46.680]  That's why I've been able to come on.
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:47.680]  I'm usually begging to come on.
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:48.680]  The last year he invited me on.
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:52.280]  I couldn't do it because you know, you've had children, you know, it is for years.
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:54.400]  Oh yeah, he has grandchildren now.
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.040]  So I'm a zombie, but I'm better now.
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:00.400]  I would love to come on and do a few hours and really go through all the disinfo.
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:04.200]  Like, I've apologized to Sandy Hook parents, even though media took it out of context for
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:05.200]  three years.
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.520]  And the media keeps saying, Alex Jones says nobody dies.
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.720]  He's attacking the families when I'm not.
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:13.400]  And so yeah, I would love to come on and just cover the waterfront in real quotes about
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:14.400]  what I really stand for.
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:15.400]  That'd be great.
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:16.400]  Absolutely.
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:22.960]  I mean, we have had you on where I specifically said to you, Alex, I want you to tell people
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:27.880]  what you really think, what you said, and you correct it for people.
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:30.440]  So the misunderstandings are fixed.
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:35.080]  And I hope that's helped you a little bit because it certainly had years ago, but enough
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.800]  about me because I'm not kissing your butt.
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:37.800]  It's true.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:42.720]  George Norring, if you track the entire spectrum of who woke this country up, who allowed people
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:46.400]  like me to take it to the next level, he took us to the next level.
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:47.400]  It's two people.
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:48.400]  Two people.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:49.400]  It's Matt Drudge and George Norring.
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:50.400]  Two people.
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:52.520]  We're going to come back and talk about key issues straight ahead.
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:58.200]  I'm going to ask you about the great Art Bell.
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:01.600]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia.
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:02.600]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:03.600]  Thanks for holding.
[01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:04.600]  Hey, Alex.
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:08.160]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:13.320]  I remember back when info wars and prison planet, it was just blue text on a white screen
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:17.600]  and I had to load down the page on my dial up internet and I thought it was pretty cool
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:21.680]  and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.480]  And I've been using your product since the first iteration of the vital shield.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:30.880]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the super male vitality, the caveman, the real red pill,
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:31.880]  Michael ZX biting.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:32.880]  It's all amazing.
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:33.880]  Thank you, brother.
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:38.880]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:43.280]  the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:47.480]  you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:51.440]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew and
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:57.800]  the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:01.600]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:06.160]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:11.560]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:16.960]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:18.480]  to unhealthy levels.
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:25.000]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.400]  in the rainwater.
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:35.720]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:41.800]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:47.440]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:52.760]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:59.160]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.400]  Cleaning your body is hard work.

[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:14.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:18.720]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:20.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:23.960]  That's right, mainstream corporate media is dying.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.920]  George Norrie and InfoWars are continuing and expanding.
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:29.760]  George was saying some pretty powerful stuff during the break.
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:33.040]  He wants to get into what's happening with the migrant children, what he really thinks
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:36.280]  is there, Korea, and other issues.
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:40.280]  But Art Bell, I mean, look, I don't know who I think is the better talk show host, you
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:41.280]  or him.
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:44.680]  There are two of the most listenable, smartest guys ever.
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:50.040]  He could tell a story, he could really, you know, it was amazing.
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:54.640]  But again, your political understanding was a little bit even more expansive, so I don't
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.120]  know who's a better talk show host.
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:48:01.120]  I've got to say out of the two of you, and I'm serious, the two of you are probably in
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:07.280]  my mind the best, most listenable talk show host in U.S. history, because I've listened
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:09.080]  to a lot of them.
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:13.320]  And so Art is gone, he's the guy that originally launched the show that you took over and expanded.
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.840]  I just want to spend a few minutes on our bell.
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.600]  Sure thing, Alex.
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:19.320]  And, you know, we were different.
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.600]  Art was very, very good at what he did.
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:25.640]  I mean, he was one of a kind.
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:30.640]  Had I gone into coast to coast to try to duplicate the guy, I would have fallen right on my face.
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:32.320]  I mean, you can't do that.
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.360]  He was a living legend at the time.
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:40.480]  I was on the air April 13th this year when we were starting to get reports that he had
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:41.480]  died.
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:43.320]  I got to tell you, I didn't believe it.
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:45.360]  I thought somebody was joking us.
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:47.120]  It was a fake news story.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:52.320]  I kept telling my producer, Tom Danhizer and Lisa Lyon, I said, you two need to find out
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:53.560]  if this is real or not.
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:49:00.120]  I am not going on the air saying that he has died and be wrong, not on this.
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:01.720]  That's just not my style.
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:06.280]  And so we kept checking and checking and checking, and it was just a weird story, Alex.
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:07.760]  It was weird.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:13.400]  Finally, the Nide County Sheriff's Department put a video out that said that he had died
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:18.320]  and that George Knapp backed it up for me, and he said, yeah, he's gone, and we went
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:19.640]  with the story.
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:26.520]  But for hours while we were getting trickling in reports that he had died, I didn't believe
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:27.520]  it.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:28.520]  Nobody did.
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:31.320]  To this day, and here we are about two months later.
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:33.240]  They still don't have a cause of death.
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:35.360]  They have not released it.
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:41.360]  They keep telling us that if they get it, it will go to the Nide County Sheriff's Department,
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:43.000]  then it's up to them to release it.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.600]  It is a bizarre story, but also one of the saddest.
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:52.120]  Yesterday, would it turn 73 years old on Father's Day?
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:57.040]  Happy Father's Day to you, too, Alex, but sad story, just tragic indeed.
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:04.760]  He was suffering with the chronic lung disease, COPD, was hospitalized some time ago for it.
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:08.120]  I think that had a lot to do with it, but nobody knows.
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:13.680]  Well, I got to tell you, when you listen to people a lot, you form a deep relationship,
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:19.840]  and when I saw the news, I felt the same way, like, that's not true.
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:22.560]  Because there aren't a lot of people that impressed me, you know, Hollywood, all that
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:23.560]  stuff.
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:25.080]  Trump impresses me because he's a maverick.
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:26.080]  You're a maverick.
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:29.600]  The only thing I really respect is Trollblazers and mavericks and people that go against the
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:36.920]  grain, and he's one of the greats, so a really sad passing there, obviously, but he'll live
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:40.240]  on through his work, obviously, forever.
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:45.600]  Let's briefly get into your view on Trump and what he's done a year and a half in.
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:46.600]  Looks to me like he's winning.
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:47.600]  He's turning the tide.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:48.600]  The country's coming back.
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:52.280]  You had a word during the break for what he's done with Korea.
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:53.280]  Brilliant.
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:55.640]  Absolutely brilliant.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:51:01.560]  And if this works the way that everybody intends it to work, this could be one of the most
[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:08.640]  dramatic political moves I have ever seen, something that no U.S. president has been
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:11.000]  able to do since the Korean War.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:16.280]  He's been able to pull this off, apparently, and let's keep our fingers crossed that everything
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:18.960]  works out the way it is.
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:23.000]  Despite the fact that, you know, of course, there's human rights issues in North Korea.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.160]  Kim Jong-un has been a butcher.
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:29.200]  He has killed off his uncle when the guy fell asleep in a meeting.
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:34.840]  They've done all kinds of bizarre things, but the bottom line is, do we want a war with
[01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:36.240]  another country?
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:38.600]  And the answer is absolutely not.
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:39.600]  And there are times that...
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:42.520]  But also, the only way to ever get them free is to do this.
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:43.800]  It'll go on for another 100 years.
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:48.880]  It's been going on 60-plus years, and if they'll bring an industry, it'll only help their
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:49.880]  people.
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:50.880]  Absolutely.
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:52.000]  And that's what we have to do.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:58.320]  So we have to, one, get them to disarm, get rid of those nukes, and then help them rebuild
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.640]  their country, get rid of our troops.
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:06.280]  We don't need 30,000 troops there anymore, and let's make this planet a place to be.
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:11.640]  Then we've got to concentrate on Iran and get that fixed before that gets out of control.
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:19.760]  But I think I would give Donald Trump an A-minus so far for his time in office.
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:24.840]  The only thing I've been critical about, about what he's been doing lately, is just his tweeting
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.840]  and stuff like that.
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:31.880]  On one hand, I know what he's trying to do with that, but on the other, I think he needs
[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:36.640]  to just calm down a little bit, be a little more presidential.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:41.440]  The guy could go down in history as one of the great ones.
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:45.920]  I agree with you at some level, but at the same time, they lie about him so much, and
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:47.160]  he wants to respond to it.
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:48.480]  I think that's why he's a maverick.
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:54.080]  Now, separately here, before we forget, because I really want you to win this, and I saw this,
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:58.080]  and I knew you were right up there at the top running about to win it, but like you
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:01.160]  said, they've got so many other people trying to, I don't want to say rig it, but every
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:02.880]  device is able to vote once.
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:07.160]  So I want you to win this, because I really think it's something to do for George Norrie,
[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:10.440]  and I saw this, I saw this on television, they were talking about the Radio Hall of Fame
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:12.680]  situation, RadioVote.com.
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:15.360]  You absolutely deserve to be in there.
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:18.440]  We need to celebrate patriots that have been telling the truth and have been really promoting
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:19.440]  voting.
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:26.120]  Free speech, RadioVote.com, and folks go there, George Norrie, again, how do people vote when
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:27.120]  they get there?
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:28.120]  All right.
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:36.120]  If you have a cell phone, grab it right now, send a text message to this number, 960000.
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:37.720]  That's 96,000.
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:44.120]  That's like the phone number, but you, all you have to do is do those digits, 960000.
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:51.080]  And then in the message, you put 700, because that's how they record a vote for me, 700,
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:52.080]  and just send it.
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:56.520]  And then you get a response back right away from the National Radio Hall of Fame that says,
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:58.480]  your vote's been accepted.
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:04.040]  Then you can also go online with your email address to radiovote.com.
[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:08.520]  You vote for somebody in the music category, it's the first segment you'll see.
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:13.760]  And then in the talk category, there's a little tiny button there that you got to dot in,
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:16.640]  and then the vote for me, and that's it.
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:23.400]  They will announce the winner on June 25th, next Monday, and let's keep our fingers crossed.
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:27.400]  Now, I asked you during the break, I said, what's something else you want to get into
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:28.400]  on air?
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:29.400]  We'll put it on screen.
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:33.800]  There were a whole bunch of news articles that are these PR pieces that called for my
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:39.680]  videos that happened to be streamed on Amazon Service that we put up there years ago, that
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:40.680]  they wanted banned.
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:42.760]  And what they're saying is they want me banned from the internet.
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:45.080]  It's like saying, we want books to be banned.
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:51.080]  Now, even if I was Hitler, they sell Mein Kampf, my struggle on Amazon, they sell it
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:52.080]  at bookstores.
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:55.080]  I remember one time in college, I was buying a copy of Mein Kampf, so I wanted to read what
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:57.640]  Hitler said, and the lady said, are you a Nazi?
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:54:58.640]  Like they were free.
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:54:59.640]  I said, why are you selling it?
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:00.640]  Are you a Nazi?
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:07.040]  So even though I was a bad guy, how is it good to say Amazon is hawking bizarre conspiracy
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:08.040]  theory films?
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:11.200]  They go on to say, Business Insider, you name it, the bunch of articles that came out,
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:17.320]  because this is all lined up, banned me from the internet, banned my films, get them off.
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:23.680]  I mean, that idea that they're pushing that is the modern book burning, isn't it, George?
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:27.040]  Your critics, Alex, don't get you.
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:32.000]  They don't understand, they don't understand free speech, they don't understand what you're
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.880]  all about, and they don't understand that you're out to protect our freedoms.
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:37.880]  They don't get it.
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:42.840]  And so consequently, when they hear you, and you look, you're an emotional guy when you
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:49.320]  talk, I've seen you in person, you get people excited, that's you, that's your style.
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:54.880]  But when some of these critics hear you, they think, oh my God, this guy's out of control,
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:58.800]  and they want you out, they want you banned, and you know what?
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:01.160]  That's not the American way.
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:03.040]  Everything you do, you have a right to do.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:06.520]  I've never heard you with profanity against somebody.
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:14.520]  You've been tough, but you're a decent guy, you're a family guy, and your work deserves
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:18.800]  to be displayed, whether it's on Amazon or on the internet.
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:22.640]  And I thank God we still have this freedom to be able to do stuff like that.
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:26.160]  Well, I was about to say, the university's already trying to ban conservative libertarian
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:28.240]  Christian nationalist speech.
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:31.920]  When you've got business insider who's usually pretty good in others, because there's a head
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:37.120]  out on me politically saying he doesn't deserve to be online, ban his films, and by the way,
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:38.120]  these are old films.
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:40.320]  I'm not against the police, I'm against the police state.
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:45.760]  The left is so concerned about police states now, they list the films, police state 2000,
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:50.640]  police state to the takeover, and films about the deep state, and they say they want it
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:56.280]  banned, and they say they want it banned because I pointed out the London bombings were staged.
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:58.520]  Yes, they let the guys bomb.
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:01.040]  That was in major British newspapers.
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:04.480]  And so they report it like they're reporting some evil dirtiness.
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:08.600]  The big dirtiness is that you have Gizmodo and others calling for, look, look, if they
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:13.160]  can ban my films or my books, George, they can ban anybody's can't they?
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:14.160]  That's right.
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.160]  That's right.
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:18.640]  We may have a segment on one night and they decide we don't want this guy to talk about
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:19.640]  that.
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:22.400]  Clip, clip, clip, and you just can't do it.
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:27.400]  We cannot regulate the internet like that or anything else.
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:31.520]  They did that with my Joe Rogan interview, went to number one on iTunes, they blocked
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:35.240]  it, and then Joe hadn't had me back on because he got the message, hey, you have Alex Jones
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:38.720]  on, we're going to kick you off Apple and YouTube, and that's his only platform.
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:39.720]  That's okay.
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:40.720]  I understand that.
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:43.800]  I just hope that Rogan understands down the road they're going to ban him anyway.
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:47.440]  We'll be back with a few more minutes with George Norrie.
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:51.800]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:56.520]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:58.040]  to detoxify the body.
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:02.920]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:04.440]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:09.360]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:11.200]  the body and it supports the infomer.
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:13.440]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:17.920]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:22.600]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:23.600]  get.
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:26.800]  You owe it to your health, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:31.840]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:37.080]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:40.920]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:41.920]  prayers together.
[01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:42.920]  We're changing the world.
[01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:48.600]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and infowarslife.com.
[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:54.760]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and Biotru Selenium.

[01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:06.360]  mustard seed.
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:12.520]  Our super high quality nascent iodine is an essential mineral sourced of 99.99% ultra
[01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:15.040]  pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:19.760]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:22.800]  every cell, tissue, and organ in the body.
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:28.280]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain, and
[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:30.520]  overall brain fog.
[01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:36.400]  Survival Shield X2 and Biotru Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.

[02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:23.960]  Well, the great George Norris with us, Coast to Coast AM, Midnight Central Time, 10PM Pacific,
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:25.760]  Coast to Coast AM dot com.
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:31.720]  George, you're a newsman, you know, in your own right, three time Emmy award-winning newsman.
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:39.640]  I mean, this is Eisenhower, Clinton, Bush era, when thousands come across a day, sometimes
[02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:43.560]  whole groups, no one knows who's who, they put adults in one area, kids in another.
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:48.200]  I mean, they're saying it's concentration camp, the kids are there, you know, they're
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:50.480]  saying Trump's a Nazi, Hayden is.
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:54.960]  I mean, I've got a memory, this is all, Obama did all this too, what do you think's going
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:56.840]  on there or do you disagree with me?
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:04.840]  Well, first of all, Alex, we're talking about illegal immigration, violation of American
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:05.840]  law.
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:08.360]  And we have to keep our borders tight.
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:11.480]  I mean, that's just a sad way to do it now.
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:16.720]  On the other hand, and this is so important that everybody understands this, people want
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:18.400]  a better living style.
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:23.360]  They want to get out of the country they're in because their life is not working.
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:26.520]  They're not making any money, their lifestyle is horrible.
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:31.800]  I can understand that it's the saddest, saddest thing that we have to go through as a nation
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:37.680]  to have to deny people the right to come through into our country, which is wonderful
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:42.440]  and perfect as far as I'm concerned, and say no to these people.
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:48.960]  Now, all that said, you got to do something about control, and you just can't have thousands
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:52.240]  of people coming across the border without any control.
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:53.240]  Every day.
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:55.400]  Every day, so that's got to be stopped.
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:59.360]  Now, the second question is separating kids from their families.
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:04.160]  Well, first of all, in some cases, they're not really family, they're just kids coming
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:05.680]  over with them.
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:12.040]  Family members are using these kids to get across the border, but you can't put sadly
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:13.040]  enough.
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:19.080]  You can't put kids in these areas that you've got the adults hold up.
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:20.280]  It's just unhealthy.
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:22.240]  It's just not good.
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:24.000]  It's a horrible situation.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.800]  There are no winners here.
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:31.920]  We as a country, we don't win, and these people who are coming across the border don't win.
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:37.200]  We've got to do something a little better with legal immigration, maybe let more people
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:38.600]  in.
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:45.040]  We have to definitely check them all out because there are a lot of criminals that come across
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:47.760]  the border, and we don't want anything to do with them.
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:48.760]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:49.760]  That's the thing.
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:52.760]  The third world's collapsing, and we can't then just say, oh, everybody come, it'll be
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:55.120]  just like Europe, and a total collapse.
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:56.120]  You can't do that.
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:57.120]  It's sad.
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:59.640]  Look, it's the worst situation to be in.
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:00.640]  It's sad.
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:04.920]  I think the Palestinian situation with the Israelis is sad.
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:08.480]  Those people deserve their own homeland.
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:15.840]  The Gaza Strip and stuff like that, it's a disaster, but something's got to be done
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:16.840]  worldwide.
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:23.360]  I mean, these are huge problems, and we have to deal with it as a nation with it.
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:27.560]  Exactly, but if the first world just opens itself up to six and a half billion people
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:29.960]  in the third world, we know it's the giant sucking sound.
[02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:35.000]  People make us third world as well, and it will be a total global disaster.
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.120]  You cannot do it.
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:41.000]  It's like you have one piece of food and four people to feed.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.080]  Somebody's going to get it.
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:43.080]  The other ones aren't.
[02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:44.080]  Well, it's like a lifeboat.
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:48.040]  Let's say the lifeboat takes 100 people, and the UN's going to try to put 500 in the
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:49.040]  lifeboat.
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:51.760]  We're going to sink the whole lifeboat, and it's not our responsibility to save those
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:54.760]  countries, even if we could, and if we could, I wish we could.
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:56.000]  It's just an incredible situation.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:03.680]  Coast to Coast AM.com, BeyondBelief.com, National Radio Hall of Fame, ElectionRadioVote.com.
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:06.680]  Go vote for George Norrie there, folks.
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:11.440]  It's just fun to celebrate people who are patriots, and not just to be passive and go,
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:15.400]  oh, I like what George has done, but I'm not going to go to radiovote.com and actually
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:16.400]  vote for him.
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:19.160]  Well, if you don't, you know, that's really a sad thing, because I'm now, I'm really
[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:20.160]  rooting now.
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:21.160]  I want George to win.
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:30.000]  I also vote by text dial 9600-96000, and text message 700 to win and get George in there.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  I want to see him number one.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.080]  I know you're right there in the running, George, so thank you so much for spending
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:35.080]  time with us.
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:36.080]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:37.080]  Last date of vote.
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.080]  Let's do it.
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:39.080]  All right.
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:40.080]  He better win.
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:41.080]  God, you know it's rigged.
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:43.080]  Give me a break.
[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:44.080]  All right.
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:45.080]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:46.080]  I'm going to give the number out.
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:47.080]  I'm going to hit a bunch of news.
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:48.080]  Got more of Trump's speech.
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:50.000]  This is a key transmission.
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.720]  I got some really big news on death panels, too, that you don't want to miss.
[02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:56.560]  This is critical.

[02:06:49.880 --> 02:07:04.720]  We're kicking these trainers' asses politically and we're not backing down at her.
[02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:33.440]  Let's go!
[02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:39.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 18th day of June, 2018, we're going to be live
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:44.920]  here for another hour until the fourth hour kicks in, and then we've got Ali Alexander
[02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:50.920]  hosting that and we've got the war room for three hours coming up after that.
[02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:57.920]  Order battle, U.S. taking in 250 children a day at drugreport.com.
[02:07:57.920 --> 02:08:09.760]  And I cannot believe, when I say hoax, I mean, this is the standard procedure for decades
[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:13.560]  that when you pick up a group of 100 people and you have no idea who the hell they are,
[02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:18.360]  that you take them and you test them for diseases, and you put the children in one area and the
[02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:23.280]  women in another and adult males in another, because if you do put people in general population
[02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:29.840]  like this, you always get rapes, you always get robberies, you always get child molestation.
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:38.080]  There's 30,000 border kids that have just come through in the last month.
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:42.760]  I mean, it is getting insane because they're advertising, come here, everything's free.
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:48.520]  And Mexico tells folks, you get on that bus, you get on that train, you don't stop.
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:53.920]  In our country, you go to El Norte.
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:58.080]  And then these people show up, when I fly in, you know, I go through a deal, I show
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:02.680]  them my passport, they look at who I am, they might go search my bags, but oh my gosh, we
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:12.200]  don't know who you are and you got Lysol over you, we're going to just turn you loose.
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:17.680]  Obama, the first four years of his administration, did hold people at these camps until they
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:18.680]  got vetted or whatever.
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:24.240]  And then they released most of them and 95% would never show up at their immigration
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:25.520]  hearings.
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:27.440]  On average, they'd make them wait two years.
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:31.000]  Now they're saying the immigration wait under Obama before he left was four years.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.920]  So are you going to show up to your hearing in four years?
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:37.400]  What are you going to do?
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:39.520]  Put a piece of paper on the wall for four years?
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:42.200]  I'd forget.
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:45.360]  It's designed so nobody would ever show up.
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:49.200]  And then they show some of these busting camps where they put up in these sports stadiums
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:55.160]  and stuff, and these hangers, fences so the adults and the children are separated, and
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:10:02.280]  they go, oh look, even Newsweek admits Obama held more than double the number of children
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:04.680]  in shelters compared to Trump Winehouse.
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:08.960]  And that's what the Attorney General is saying, and that's true.
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:13.840]  But you turn on the news, it's like, this is like Auschwitz, it's like Buchenwald,
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:20.920]  Chalkow, the former head of the CIA.
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:28.600]  I mean, that's cuckoo, that's cuckoo.
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:33.520]  Trump got funding increase for the center, so they're nicer.
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:39.360]  So separating mothers and children like the Nazis, even though when he was NSA and CIA
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:42.240]  director with Obama, that's what they did.
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:47.800]  He thinks you're so stupid.
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:51.200]  And then I've got the deadly toll of human trafficking singing in, hundreds of thousands
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:55.600]  dead, all the sex slaves, Democrats going bang on the walls.
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:00.920]  But remember these articles, Jakari Jackson and Don Salazar, 2014, four years ago.
[02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:02.520]  We ought to grab that video report.
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:07.360]  In fact, grab that video report out of this because we exclusively broke it.
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:11.120]  Six months later, New York Times was forced to report it out of the same town, McAllen,
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:12.120]  Texas.
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:13.120]  They go, no, no, no.
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:14.120]  They come in.
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:15.120]  We don't even vet them.
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:16.120]  Not for diseases, nothing.
[02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:17.120]  We just let them in.
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:21.120]  Then we interviewed the head of the border patrol a year after that, in that sector.
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:23.640]  Oh, he risked his job doing that.
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:26.480]  And he said, no, we're not even allowed to test them for disease.
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:31.360]  And we know that we have black plague.
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:35.920]  And he said, we also know that we have leprosy and drug resistant TB and a bunch of other
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:36.920]  stuff.
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:41.720]  We have TBs, you name it, and that they're loaded and then we follow the buses to Catholic
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:46.800]  and Protestant churches where there's no vetting, no IDs, and kids are then taken off
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:53.040]  buses and put in vans with God knows who and disappeared.
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:56.360]  That's human trafficking, by the way, under federal law.
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:01.480]  When you have undocumented people crossing a national line, undocumented children or
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:03.680]  adults, but with children, it's unbelievable.
[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:07.480]  Hillary had one of her top aides convicted of trying to smuggle black kids out of Haiti
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:13.040]  undocumented, but Obama did it.
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:14.040]  That's my big frustration.
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:18.920]  It's why they hate info wars, because they can track back that we forced that out.
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:25.200]  I keep explaining why they're trying to shut us down, because they don't like the fact
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:33.320]  I can get up here on air and send reporters to the border, a Don Salazar and Jacare Jackson,
[02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:36.520]  to get the head of the border patrol and the head of emergency management and them to just
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:39.720]  a point blank say, we don't do medical tests, nothing.
[02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:42.840]  These kids show up over a thousand a day in McAllen alone.
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:47.280]  We load them up and we disappear them into America.
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:56.480]  What in the head and a bunch of them are unaccompanied and a lot of them are adults and a lot of
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:12:57.600]  them are lying about their age.
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:01.000]  What planet do you do that?
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:05.040]  They can easily check them and enroll them, but they don't want them enrolled.
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:07.480]  And with the history of the Democratic Party and all these Democratic officials caught
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:11.480]  child trafficking, sex trafficking, the Caudes sucking off them, that's what it is.
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:15.040]  It's the Democrats feeding off a new underclass.
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:22.120]  We've had city council members in Austin's brothers caught with people in dungeons in
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:23.120]  their basements.
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:29.880]  We don't have basements in Texas except Democrats do, where they would hold people and torture
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:34.880]  them in cages till their family gave them more money.
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:42.600]  Oh, but they're Hispanics, so they can't do any wrong, don't investigate them.
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:47.080]  City official admits border patrol, fronting cash to busy legals anywhere in the U.S.
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:49.600]  How bombshell is that article?
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:55.440]  We ought to flashback this back on infowars.com and tie it in for the fact that this is what
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:59.560]  Obama did to stop doing what was going on now and Trump put it back in where no, you
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:03.520]  don't just show up with a bunch of kids and then just pump them into wherever you want.
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:08.240]  That violates federal and international law.
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:09.240]  Unbelievable.
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:14.400]  Meanwhile, oh, we're putting kids in concentration camps, Hayden says, oh, Democrat lawmakers
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:18.000]  angry with what they saw in South Texas, they've got the heat going, it's 100 degrees, they
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.440]  went inside it was 72.
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:22.400]  What does that even mean?
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:28.120]  See the shock video inside Trump's concentration camps, how lavish and nice it is.
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:31.680]  Some of the kids get to stay here, their parents aren't criminals, had committed a bunch of
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:34.560]  crimes, they can prove it's them, a lot of them are getting to stay actually.
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:38.920]  But no, no, we don't even know who you are or who you're with or can't find or you're
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:41.840]  with some guy that didn't even your family, sorry, you're getting sent back.
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:46.400]  I mean, God, since when can we let people just kidnap kids and bring them here?
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:51.120]  Flashback, Obama's HHS placed migrant children in custody of human traffickers, daily caller,
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:52.120]  remember that?
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:56.240]  Of course they did, that's who you think is there to grab the kids.
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:15:01.600]  This is all a big feeding frenzy of children, you know a lot are getting killed in rituals.
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:06.320]  Yeah, the MSM is beyond misleading the public about what's going on, but don't worry, we've
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:11.440]  got delicate little genius failed actors like John Kuzak accused of inciting violence over
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:12.880]  Trump's immigration policy.
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:20.680]  He said burn down the emergency centers, oh, that's a great idea, burn down a facility,
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:24.240]  a school and food facility and sleeping facility of children.
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:29.520]  That's how you free him, just a bit of dumb mindlessness, he's had a lobotomy.
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:35.560]  Dude, there's a superhero, it'll be a question mark like, dude, where'd my brain go?
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:38.920]  They're like, can you find your butt with both hands, what's a butt?
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:45.560]  I want to burn down the children, I want to save them, I'm Don Kuzak.
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:50.520]  Associated press says cages describe chain link partitions, it's all sick, it's all lies,
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:55.160]  Laura Bush chimed in, we'll tell you about her when we come back.
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:16:00.120]  We call it the crapper, water closet, outhouse or bathroom, but where do you go when there's
[02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:01.320]  nowhere to go?
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:03.520]  The answer is the Biffy Bag.

[02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:39.080]  talk about this topic. If you call, please talk about this topic. I want to get your
[02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:46.120]  take on it. The hoax that kids are in concentration camps. When the UN has this huge history of
[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:53.120]  kidnap and kid sex slavery, Rwandan massacres, Haitian slave kids, Associated Press, Democratic
[02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:58.960]  Party, open borders, the coyotes, hundreds of thousands, a dead total. All these mass
[02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:03.400]  graves they're digging up. 80% of the women coming across kid. Right by the Mexican drug
[02:21:03.400 --> 02:21:11.920]  cartels. Source on that. MSC International. Huffington Post. And then, you know, thousands
[02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:15.960]  of people getting grabbed every day per sector. And then they check out who they are and
[02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:18.960]  vet them and put them through. And you put the kids in one area and the women in another,
[02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:22.560]  the men in another. Of course, it's not going to be like the Superdome, a big rape party,
[02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:27.360]  but that's been the policy for decades. Trump's trying to change it. And so there's no illegal
[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:32.320]  immigration, but then you can get in easier if you're vetted. Democrats say, well, no,
[02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:36.720]  we want the UN back in control of immigration. We want UNESCO back in control. We want totally
[02:21:36.720 --> 02:21:42.000]  open borders. Trump says, that's no deal. So they grandstand and pity party and run
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:45.920]  around and let us in. It's hot out here. I bet the kids are hot inside. We want to see
[02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:54.800]  you go in. It's super nice, super clean. And then the media just keeps going with a lie.
[02:21:54.800 --> 02:22:00.720]  But meanwhile, Laura Bush's husband launched the big illegal Iraq war, even though it was
[02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:05.720]  all lies and fixed intelligence and the guy that voted for the assault weapons ban and
[02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:12.800]  the guy that wanted open borders, Laura Bush, outraged by US border policy, but okay with
[02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:23.080]  hubby destroying the Middle East. Isn't that just perfect? It breaks her heart. Oh, she's
[02:22:23.080 --> 02:22:28.080]  such a virtue signaler. We need Republicans like her again that are really Democrats,
[02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:32.160]  don't we? But don't talk about the huge human toll or NAFTA gap that you help get through
[02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:37.920]  or all the scams or any of that or city official admits border patrol, front and cash to bussy
[02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:43.720]  legals anywhere in the US. That was under Obama where he just stopped even passing people
[02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:48.720]  for diseases, anything. Just let him in. Let's play a clip from that Don Salazar, Jacarie
[02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:54.160]  Jackson report that needs to go. We should retweet this. Remember Obama stopped putting
[02:22:54.160 --> 02:23:00.000]  people in facilities. He just started letting NGOs. Oh, the Vatican was the big one. Oh, here's
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:05.560]  the Vatican. Here's a bunch of priests to get undocumented kids with no name and no record.
[02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:09.760]  Here's a bunch of little girls and little boys. We don't even know if you are a priest.
[02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:13.480]  You're just, Oh, I'm a priest. All right, a priest of Satanism. I'll take care of those
[02:23:13.480 --> 02:23:19.760]  kids for you. And then they disappear. Unbelievable. And a bunch of them found dead and smuggled
[02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:25.320]  and sold into sex slavery in places like Houston. After all, people need little kids to rape
[02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:30.640]  during the Super Bowl, don't they? And the special ops, people are told to stop. The
[02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:35.040]  warrants are even killed because they have special events going on in special control
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:39.880]  zones. I only have the formula one out here. They got the little kids out there. I've talked
[02:23:39.880 --> 02:23:43.600]  to the investigators and they're blocked from stopping it. They've thought about just going
[02:23:43.600 --> 02:23:50.600]  ahead and going in. I think that's probably going to happen. But I digress. Trump's giving
[02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:55.640]  the green light. He says, I don't care what low levels they're trying to stop you. Take
[02:23:55.640 --> 02:24:00.120]  them out. That's been going on. But when you take them out like that, the public can't
[02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:05.640]  handle that type of news. So it's kept on the DL. That's what the Democrats are so upset
[02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:09.440]  because they're the pedophile party. They're the child trafficking, human trafficking party,
[02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:14.040]  and they've all been caught doing it. Here's part of that report. What happened today in
[02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:19.160]  particular is that the border patrol dropped off some, they call them detainees, but obviously
[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:24.040]  they're not detained after they dropped them off. And normally they have tickets or arrange
[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:29.720]  transportation to go somewhere in the interior. Well, today, apparently for some logistical
[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:34.760]  reasons, some of them didn't have transportation arranged or their transportation is tomorrow.
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:42.280]  They're posing. Look at that concentration camp. It's a public school with a bunch of
[02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:49.480]  women and children. And then they're just the Democratic party shows up. We have all the documents,
[02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:54.520]  the article, and just gives them $500 in a bus ticket to Democrat party areas, mainly Chicago
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:25:04.280]  and Houston. And boy, they get there. It's incredible. Let's continue. We're having upon
[02:25:04.280 --> 02:25:09.720]  places to shelter for tonight. So we access some resources that we have. We're going to
[02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:14.440]  shelter them here tonight. So why is the border patrol bringing them here? They're not bringing
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:19.000]  them here. They're bringing them to our bus terminal because that's where the border patrol
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:24.200]  understands that they have transportation to go to the interior. Right. So the dropping them off
[02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:28.440]  is our understanding that they were dropped off with tickets or with vouchers for tickets.
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:34.200]  Turns out some of them didn't tonight have their ticket or didn't have their voucher,
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:38.840]  or like I said, their bus isn't till tomorrow. So they got nowhere to stay.
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:43.880]  Our bus terminal buyers, I mean, the city of McAllen bus terminal is not a 24 seven
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:49.080]  operation. Right. So we've got to put them up somewhere else. So for tonight, we're doing
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:53.320]  the best we can with this resource, which thankfully one of our neighboring cities
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:57.560]  made available to us. And we're going to put them up here tonight tomorrow. We'll have a little chat
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:01.400]  with border patrol and see what's going on. Stop there. That's an eight minute report.
[02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:08.840]  That's Kevin Pagan, the head of emergency management in McAllen, Texas. And we have the
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:13.800]  footage of the people come walk across the border. The border patrol takes them. They take them on
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:19.880]  vans a half mile to the bus terminal. They're given money and vouchers and the Democrats are there.
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:27.640]  The Vatican's there actually directing where they go. Wow. Now, remember Hillary, one of
[02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:32.920]  her top staffers got convicted of trying to smuggle over a hundred kids out of Haiti
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:37.160]  that caught up the airport trying to get them on a specially chartered jet.
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:42.200]  And the Haitians locked her butt up and she got here and got locked up.
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:46.920]  The Clinton-Sillsby Travelling scandal and how the media attempted to ignore and cover it up.
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:51.560]  They said it was 33, but it turned out hundreds that she tried to get lined up.
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:59.320]  She's now changed her name and runs a child's AIDS group. Oh my God.
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:04.760]  And by the way, hundreds of thousands of kids have been brought in the U.S. and no one even
[02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:10.440]  knows where they are. But that's put less pressure on your kid getting grabbed out of their backyard.
[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:18.040]  Well, it's their two million kids missing a year and yeah, 60, 70 percent are
[02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:23.400]  13, 14, 15 that run away. But a lot are one, two, three, four year old and they'll take one or two
[02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:29.560]  and put it on the news with the rest. No, no, no. Got to do something about these missing
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:33.800]  children grabbed by perverts. Too many incidents, fast trial, death penalty. Yeah, that's Trump.
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:39.800]  And they're mad that they don't get to never give those kids an ID or have those kids be
[02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:44.920]  known. They're so mad that those kids get an ID. They're so mad those kids get help. They're so mad
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:50.600]  they get three meals and football and basketball and baseball and soccer and they're so mad that
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:54.440]  even with their bad parents or whoever they're with get deported. In some cases, they get to stay
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:28:05.880]  here. They are so pissed that we're just not a total wall, wall, west. So info wars.com,
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:09.560]  the articles up from earlier in the broadcast. Please get out that key video to everyone.
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:14.600]  If you want to counter this must see Trump imprisonment of migrant children is a giant
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:21.160]  hoax. Watch live established that pushes racist Trump narrative again and then covers up massive

[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:45.480]  people in it. I mean, I mean, it's like it's like their vampires feeding on Hispanics as they
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:50.120]  this whole underworld. It's like we've got Mexico the same. There's mass murder there going on
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:56.120]  quietly, but only on Hispanics by the Hispanics, the Democrats and the devil worshipers want revenge

[02:32:55.960 --> 02:33:07.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:07.160 --> 02:33:25.800]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones,
[02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:33.240]  live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the infowars.com studios.
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:41.320]  All right. This is dramatic. Democrats have come out and are supporting President Trump's
[02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:47.720]  detention of undocumented migrant children so they not be put in general population
[02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:51.960]  with the thousands of other adults that come in every day. That's just common sense
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:54.440]  while they're vetted, while they're medically checked, while they're fed.
[02:33:54.440 --> 02:34:02.600]  So in a big turn of events, Dianne Feinstein and Hillary Clinton have come out in support
[02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:07.640]  of the president. It's incredible. Of course, the issue is they think you don't have a memory.
[02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:12.600]  This is years ago. This is actually Hillary just a few years ago. We got Feinstein more than 20
[02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:17.400]  years ago. But here's Hillary Clinton. Just because your child reaches the border doesn't mean your
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:23.560]  child gets to stay. Here it is. And many children are fleeing from that violence. Should they be
[02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:29.320]  able to stay here? Well, it may be safer, but that's not the answer. I do not. Should they be
[02:34:29.320 --> 02:34:35.000]  sent back? Well, first of all, we have to provide the best emergency care we can provide. We have
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:42.440]  children five and six years who have come up from Central America. We need to do more to provide
[02:34:42.440 --> 02:34:47.320]  border security in southern Mexico. They should be sent back now. Well, they should be sent back
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:52.040]  as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults and their families are because there are
[02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:57.160]  concerns about whether all of them can be sent back. But I think all of them who can be should
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:35:02.280]  be reunited with their families. And just as Vice President Biden is arguing today in Central
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:07.960]  America, we've got to do more. I started this when I was secretary to deal with the violence
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:12.920]  in this region, to deal with border security. But we have to send a clear message just because
[02:35:12.920 --> 02:35:18.600]  your child gets across the border. That doesn't mean the child gets to stay. So we don't want to
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:24.920]  send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous
[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:36.840]  journey. Now, that's Hillary in 2016, early 2016, February 2016. Today, she's saying the opposite.
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:42.440]  Now, notice she can say it perfectly. She's smart. If you implode the border, if you invite people
[02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:48.840]  to do this, it invites human smuggling, collapsible stuff like Europe. She knows. She was trying to
[02:35:48.840 --> 02:35:55.160]  fool voters. It's in the WikiLeaks by acting conservative or common sense. Now that she's
[02:35:55.160 --> 02:36:04.040]  didn't make power, she's showing you who she really is. It's incredible. But let's see a few
[02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:09.080]  more of these clips. And it's not just her. It's Joe Biden. It's Barack Obama. It's Diane Feinstein.
[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:14.840]  I mean, I have hours of these clips, but I want to go to your phone calls. But I've had Democrats
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:18.040]  confront me on the street go, how dare you don't want to take care of the poor migrant children?
[02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:21.960]  Oh, are you taking care of them down in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador? Are you going down there?
[02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:26.760]  Like my family's actually gone down as missionaries and in the military and other things to try to
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:34.760]  help people. No, you haven't done that. No, you didn't go take Spanish at LSU and then volunteer
[02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:38.840]  for Vietnam and then go down and live down there and be a missionary. No, you didn't do
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:46.520]  any of that. You Democrats, you just virtue signal to everybody else about how great you are, but
[02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:53.160]  you don't fight. You sign on to the Communist Chinese plan and then point your finger at those of us
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:57.080]  who actually fight communism and say we're the enemy. You're a joke.
[02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:03.160]  But here's another clip. Hillary Clinton used to sound a lot like Trump. We're going to go to that
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:09.000]  one next and then we're going to play Dianne Feinstein. Here it is. We can enforce our borders.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:16.040]  I think we should enforce our borders to have a situation where 40% of the babies born on Medicaid
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:23.400]  in California today are born of illegal immigrants creates a very real problem for the state,
[02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:31.080]  which is in deficit. Of course, the borders. I agree. 17% of our prison population at a cost
[02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:36.440]  of 300 million a year, the illegal immigrants who come here and commit felonies. All right,
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:40.200]  that's fine. Back when the Democrats were behaving like Republicans to get elected,
[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:46.200]  then open the border. Let's continue with Hillary. Do not want to do anything to encourage more
[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:51.880]  illegal immigration into this country. We have to stop the inflow of illegals coming into our
[02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:58.920]  country. Mexican government's policies are pushing migration. The Mexican government is much smarter,
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:04.280]  much sharper, much more cunning, and they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:10.440]  for them. They don't want to take care of them. Look, I voted numerous times when I was a senator
[02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:19.640]  to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in.
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:25.240]  We will build a wall. It will do what it's supposed to do. Keep illegal immigrants out.
[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:29.880]  If they've committed transgressions of whatever kind, they should be obviously deported.
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:33.640]  And some of these people are causing tremendous problems. All you have to do is look at the
[02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:39.320]  crime wave. If I'm elected, they're going to be out of there day one. I voted for border security,
[02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:43.320]  and some of it was a fence. I don't think we ever called it a wall. Maybe in some places it was a
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:46.840]  wall. We're going to have a border. It's going to be a real border. You know, secure our borders
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:52.200]  with technology, personnel, physical barriers, if necessary. We need to have tougher employer
[02:38:52.200 --> 02:38:57.160]  sanctions. We have a country. We have to have borders. We have borders. We have to have laws.
[02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:03.480]  We either have a country or we don't. The difference is Trump is actually doing
[02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:09.000]  some of what he said he did. Hillary is the opposite. And he accepted the bill.
[02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:13.320]  Like he always said, I will absolutely, if somebody's been here 20, 30 years and they
[02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:16.600]  don't have a criminal record, they're part of society, weren't born here. We'll just fast track
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:20.440]  them in a year. They'll be sentenced. But if you got a bunch of felonies and you're 40-something
[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:23.720]  years old and claim you've been here for 20 years, but we know you really live in, you know,
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:30.440]  Nicaragua two years ago, your ass is gone. It's real simple. We should be vetting people with a
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:37.000]  basic system, just like every other country does. It's incredible. All right, I'm going to go to
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:41.480]  your phone calls when we come back for a few segments. And then we've got a guesthouse coming on,
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:46.040]  and then Owen Shroyer's loaded for bear. There's a bunch of other news I didn't hit. This just broke
[02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:51.160]  by Jamie White. I mentioned this earlier, but this story needs to go really viral.
[02:39:52.200 --> 02:39:57.800]  In full wars, right again, war inside FBI triggered reopening of Clinton email probe,
[02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:06.600]  and the whole investigation into the reopening on Anthony Weiner. As we reported from the time
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:14.120]  from our sources that included the state police of New York and the state police of New Jersey,
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:20.040]  and also the central intelligence agency, the good guys that are in there. We told you all that
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:24.920]  with Doug Hagman and others. In full wars, right again, war inside FBI triggered reopening of Clinton
[02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:33.000]  email probe. IG report confirms Patriot agent concern McCabe delayed probe into Anthony Weiner,
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  put pressure on them, causing Comey to reopen it for a week so they could have the excuse to
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:44.440]  that be reopened to kick it back down with the state. The inspector general's report reveals
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:49.640]  the FBI reopened Hillary Clinton's probe due to pressure from a case agent concerned over private
[02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:54.280]  emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop confirming in full wars news because you think the feds could
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:59.880]  cover it up. But there were so many copies of it that when a Patriot saw it and knew they had to
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:05.880]  then reopen it to then shovel it down to the state level and try to contain it. The report
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:11.000]  explains how a Patriot agent dumbfounded over the fact that top FBI leadership had taken no action
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:15.720]  in almost a month over the discovery of a batch of emails that was reportedly really bad stuff
[02:41:15.720 --> 02:41:23.000]  on Weiner's laptop. And it's got all the quotes here, all the documentation on page 302, which
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:27.320]  again is the name of an FBI report. It's kind of a message like an FBI agent reports the field
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:31.800]  agents report on 302s. That's the name of the documents. So funny they stuck this on page 302.
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:36.040]  It's like little hidden Easter eggs saying here's our real report. Look at this. This is the key.
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:41.400]  This is what's important. This is what Comey did. Comey covered it up. So it's a big article.
[02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:48.280]  It details it all. It's got clips from the emails from the text messages from the inspector general's
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:53.720]  report. It's testifying by the way right now. We're gonna go break and come back just briefly.
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:57.720]  I haven't come up with the new specials. I mean the specials are already so huge.

[02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:00.680]  Living in Volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here
[02:44:00.680 --> 02:44:06.200]  in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned
[02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:13.320]  about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:19.720]  the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metal
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:25.480]  levels, alkalinity, and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:31.960]  metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter
[02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:37.800]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to
[02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:44.440]  optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:50.120]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply,
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:54.200]  but more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:56.760 --> 02:45:03.640]  You deserve a deep rest while sleep with Knockout by InfowarsLive. Our organic formula is made from

[02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:55.400]  and we are winning.
[02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:12.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:19.560]  I'm going to find me a reckless woman.
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:25.560]  Raise your blades and die center high.
[02:47:28.520 --> 02:47:32.120]  Just a touch of sadness set her finger.
[02:47:35.240 --> 02:47:39.000]  Thunder and lightning inner thighs.
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:43.160]  Thunder and lightning inside. On corruption it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:48.280]  And we're going to rise. What you talking about there? We're going to rise.
[02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:54.680]  Ride like the one-eyed jack of diamonds. Ride like the one-eyed jack of diamonds with the devil
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:59.880]  close to high. We're going to rise. One-eyed jack of diamonds.
[02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:04.120]  Let's say that's a limonade. Now the limonade is copying God.
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:11.480]  One-eyed jack of diamonds, your spiritual eye. I'm going to chase the sky forever.
[02:48:11.480 --> 02:48:12.440]  Sir Willie Nelson.
[02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:17.320]  With the woman and the stallion and the wind.
[02:48:21.240 --> 02:48:23.320]  And the sun is going to burn into ascender.
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:29.640]  Before we ever pass this way again.
[02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:33.720]  Before we ever pass this way again.
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:37.400]  And I'm going to rise. I'm going to rise.
[02:48:38.680 --> 02:48:40.360]  And we're going to rise.
[02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:43.320]  We're going to rise. We're going to rise.
[02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:44.760]  All right, I'm going to write to your phone calls.
[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:50.840]  I covered a lot of stuff for Artie today. But the reason I'm really frustrated is
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:56.600]  I haven't hit the really key stuff yet. And that's just the stuff that I had before the
[02:48:56.600 --> 02:49:01.640]  show started. So much is broken at newswars.com and infowars.com right now.
[02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:06.440]  I may have to host a little bit of the next hour just to get to it. But just, just, just here's one
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:13.320]  story. And then remember, when you see this article go, wait a minute, what did Alex cover
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:17.160]  two years ago, a year ago, six weeks ago and last week?
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:24.120]  I said that Google and IBM are in competition with each other
[02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:28.840]  with the World Health Organization, with the National Health Service of England,
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:32.920]  it's whatever it adopts gets adopted and with the state of California and with the VA.
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:34.920]  I'm trying to get this in front of Trump.
[02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:42.440]  Remember, you heard about four years ago how they had death panels with a computer and the
[02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:46.360]  bioethicist in Arizona for the Veterans Affairs is a beta test.
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:52.360]  Well, there's the Bloomberg headline today. Well, they just anticipated where I was going
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:56.360]  without me even telling the crew, boy, they are on target. If you're a TV viewer, you just saw that.
[02:49:57.160 --> 02:50:03.080]  Google is training machines to predict when a patient will die. Now, now, now translate what
[02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:11.880]  that just said. Google is training machines to decide when you die, not to predict, but notice
[02:50:11.880 --> 02:50:19.080]  how they spend that. No, the machines are deciding if they're going to save you and what you've done
[02:50:19.080 --> 02:50:22.760]  already in the National Health Service. Were you a smoker? Were you overweight? What was your
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:28.520]  political thing? It's already there. But how are they going to introduce AI computers bypassing
[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:33.000]  doctors and nurses bypassing even the bioethicist board? They quit giving them the Hippocratic
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:43.800]  Oh, 20 years ago. Hippocrates. And now they're just putting it out like it's no big deal,
[02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:50.360]  saying Google is training machines to predict when a patient will die. Oh, they predict so
[02:50:50.360 --> 02:50:56.840]  accurately because they will withhold the care. But they'll say, oh, the machine made the decision.
[02:50:56.840 --> 02:51:10.200]  Who programs the machine? Unbelievable how they introduced this to us, the slaves.
[02:51:10.200 --> 02:51:18.040]  But it's so cute. It's the zeitgeist movement. A computer will decide what I eat and what I do
[02:51:18.040 --> 02:51:26.520]  and when I work and who I am. It decided it's a computer. It's fancy. It knows it's better than
[02:51:26.520 --> 02:51:33.160]  me. It's replacing me. The future is here. And the war for the future has been won by
[02:51:33.160 --> 02:51:41.880]  international business machines and the Watson. And who is Thomas Watson? You might want to find
[02:51:41.880 --> 02:51:52.360]  out. The numbers on the Jews in the camps. And then they named the machine killing our troops
[02:51:53.080 --> 02:52:01.800]  after him. Beautiful. And it's sickening in your face. Because they think you're done.
[02:52:01.800 --> 02:52:04.760]  They think you're an idiot. And they tune in and they hear me and they go,
[02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:11.640]  this guy has got our entire game plan. And the reason we want him shut down is our own people
[02:52:11.640 --> 02:52:15.080]  are compartmentalized going along with it for their own personal gain and aren't fully aware.
[02:52:15.080 --> 02:52:19.400]  And a lot of them are having crisis of conscience because of Jones. We thought Jones was just
[02:52:19.400 --> 02:52:22.920]  crediting what we were doing to the public so that they wouldn't believe it was happening.
[02:52:22.920 --> 02:52:26.840]  And he's having the opposite effect. We want him destroyed. If you make him a martyr,
[02:52:26.840 --> 02:52:34.920]  literally be more powerful, assassinated character first than poisoning. And that's
[02:52:34.920 --> 02:52:41.160]  the decision. And I'm, I'm not going to commit suicide, but I will say this. I'm not scared of
[02:52:41.160 --> 02:52:46.920]  them. In fact, it's all responsibility I have. It's going to the end no matter what the cost is.
[02:52:46.920 --> 02:52:59.320]  I have no fear. Oh, and there's another Tom Watson saying the computers will save us. Of
[02:52:59.320 --> 02:53:05.000]  course, every IQ number shows it's going down where brainwaves are going down. Cantor is going
[02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:08.680]  straight up. Everything bad is going up. Everything good is going down. Sperm counts.
[02:53:08.680 --> 02:53:18.280]  But don't worry, the robots will, the liberals love it. They'll decide who gets the money.
[02:53:18.280 --> 02:53:20.280]  All right, I'm going to your phone calls now.
[02:53:25.480 --> 02:53:32.040]  There's a computer called Thomas Watson. So loving. The doctors don't have to feel
[02:53:32.040 --> 02:53:40.680]  bad. He lives and dies because the computer says his name's Tommy. Tommy J. Watson.
[02:53:45.400 --> 02:53:54.200]  It's so liberal. It'll take all your normal functions away and let it'll do everything for
[02:53:54.200 --> 02:53:59.800]  you until you're obsolete. It's the computers having program of the globalist to make you
[02:53:59.800 --> 02:54:03.960]  incrementally have your power, incrementally have everything like, oh, we're going to put
[02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:09.400]  suspenser belts on you like Baron Harkin and we don't need to walk. You're like, at first,
[02:54:09.400 --> 02:54:14.200]  wow, to walk down the hall to walk up this hill is so much fun. But you're dying. Your muscles
[02:54:14.200 --> 02:54:19.400]  are dying. You're atrophying as a human as they take control of every function until you're being
[02:54:19.400 --> 02:54:24.440]  made obsolete and you're opting into it. There's always the latest glitz. And oh, God, if I could
[02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:33.960]  just have the iPhone 10. Yeah, that's what Ray Kurzweil says. Oh, I may not exterminate you when
[02:54:33.960 --> 02:54:40.920]  I become a God, but I might accidentally step on you. Oh, the robots might keep us as pets.
[02:54:40.920 --> 02:54:54.760]  We that designed it all. Oh, they're already teaching us. Who should we go to first?
[02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:04.200]  Charles, Brian, Chase, Jason.
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:11.080]  Yeah, let's talk to Jason in New Jersey first. Jason, thanks for holding it on the air worldwide.
[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:17.960]  Go ahead. Hey, Alex, what's up? Actually, in Illinois, but Jason in Illinois, we're president.
[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:23.080]  They said New Jersey, but it doesn't really matter. Let's just say, let's stop. Let's start over.
[02:55:23.080 --> 02:55:29.320]  Let's go to your call. Hello, Jason in Illinois. Go ahead. Hello, sir. Glad to be talking to you
[02:55:29.320 --> 02:55:33.000]  big timeline. But I know why they got your name wrong. Your phone's such hammered. Hell, I can
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:37.800]  barely understand you. I'm not mad at you. Just give us a point. Sorry about that. First thing I would
[02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:47.160]  do as president would be to send the US Air Force into Mexico and send all the cartels and the
[02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:53.320]  Mexican government straight to hell where they belong and call it New Texas, call Mexico, maybe
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:59.800]  break it up into three, you know, New Texas, maybe New Illinois, I don't know, maybe, maybe Travis
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:06.200]  at the terminal Travis. Oh, name the whole country, Travis. Well, I know there's a lot of
[02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:10.040]  Hispanic folks in Mexico might actually like that. You know, the big thing is our big banks
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:14.600]  are working with the drug cartels. And I think that's why it's been so hard to fix the problem
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:19.320]  is that the globalists have been doing this and using Mexico and Obama using Mexico. I think
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:26.520]  Trump's really stopping that. What do you think? Yeah, I remember you had a interview with a DEA
[02:56:26.520 --> 02:56:32.200]  guy. He was a native Texan, but he was. Yeah. So Selly Castile. Yeah. Yeah. I watched that not
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:36.440]  long ago. He basically, man, that was important. That interview was like 12 years ago and he
[02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:40.840]  predicted the whole war in Mexico, the collapse, everything. Yeah. Yeah. We've been meddling
[02:56:40.840 --> 02:56:47.320]  in Mexico for, you tell me, I don't even know, 40 years, 50 years. So, you know, it's no wonder
[02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:51.960]  they're collapsed, but I think the most humanitarian thing to do is just be to take over the whole
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:58.200]  dark country and just send all the government and the cartels way straight through their mass.
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:02.280]  Well, there's no doubt that the U.S. has managed things better than Mexico has.
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:06.280]  Mexico never got out from under colonial rule, really. They just kept the same colonial system.
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:11.400]  We've had our own problems, but I don't know. I mean, it would almost be a better idea than
[02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:17.720]  letting Mexico with the globalists take over the U.S. But man, I tell you, I just, I just,
[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:22.120]  who knows? It's just, you know, I don't know the age of conquest is still going.
[02:57:22.120 --> 02:57:26.840]  The problem is that the globalists are using third world to capture the first world now.
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:30.680]  So it's an interesting idea. I can see the headline now. Jones says
[02:57:31.560 --> 02:57:35.960]  invade Mexico. I know a lot of the really successful, wealthy Hispanics in Texas.
[02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:40.440]  Every time I talk to them, they say we should invade Mexico and take over,
[02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:44.600]  including some of my in-laws. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:48.920]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[02:57:48.920 --> 02:57:53.720]  Between debt crisis, natural disasters, or even simple power outages,

[02:58:46.280 --> 02:58:49.880]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products,
[02:58:49.880 --> 02:58:55.160]  we have it in FullWars' life. It'd take hours. Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:58:55.160 --> 02:58:59.320]  It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold,
[02:59:00.200 --> 02:59:05.480]  the candida. It's back in stock. The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:59:05.480 --> 02:59:09.240]  It's got the preglonone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:59:09.240 --> 02:59:12.280]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[02:59:12.280 --> 02:59:17.240]  So you can upload it. And our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver
[02:59:17.240 --> 02:59:23.320]  and iodine fortified toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle that's a spray you do.
[02:59:23.320 --> 02:59:29.240]  You can also swallow it. It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver,
[02:59:29.240 --> 02:59:34.920]  and a lot more. Without you, we couldn't do it. So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsStore.com
[02:59:34.920 --> 02:59:39.480]  and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake
[02:59:39.480 --> 02:59:42.920]  and it's so essential to spread the word. Again, thank you so much for being part
[02:59:42.920 --> 03:00:08.920]  of the Second American Revolution.
[03:00:13.240 --> 03:00:25.240]  All right. I got loaded phones and I didn't realize that our next guest host has a Brandon Darby,
[03:00:25.240 --> 03:00:30.440]  who's a big Breitbart editor, exposed the border stuff coming up. He's a big guest and others.
[03:00:30.440 --> 03:00:35.640]  So I got to go quick here. I apologize to the callers, but let's go to Kirsten and then Chase
[03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:38.920]  and others. Kirsten, you're on the air from Florida. Worldwide, thanks for calling.
[03:00:38.920 --> 03:00:43.960]  Thanks, Alex. This is my third time calling you. My first time, you did the thing about
[03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:50.200]  the Federal Reserve, Obama crashed. That got 8,000 views and I'm the Singaporean Chinese girl.
[03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:55.960]  Remember, I called you a couple times. I've moved to Florida from Tennessee and I want to talk to
[03:00:55.960 --> 03:01:05.160]  you about the kids coming in, the migrant kids. During Obama in 2014, there were 70,000 migrant
[03:01:05.160 --> 03:01:10.040]  kids, which is four times what there is now. That's right, because Obama invited it so it
[03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:17.720]  caused the flood. Correct. And I say, E-Verify, E-Verify, E-Verify. I'm a legal immigrant. I came
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:24.920]  here at 15 years old and I didn't come here to live in an illegal hellhole. That's not what I
[03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:30.680]  signed up for and that's not what I want. So really, no, keep them out. And on top of that,
[03:01:30.680 --> 03:01:40.600]  I take all your products. I love Survival 2x and the selenium. Thank you. And I try to apply
[03:01:40.600 --> 03:01:47.080]  for a reporter for you. I think you might need a chai-com that speaks Chinese to do a little
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:51.240]  reporting. I don't think Chinese people are all chai-coms. I mean, the government's chai-com.
[03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:58.120]  Making a joke. Yeah. I'm Singaporean Chinese. I think you saw the Singaporean summit. My
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:04.040]  country's pretty, I'm Singaporean American. My country, my birthplace is pretty amazing.
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:08.440]  Yeah, here it is. I want to visit sometime. God bless you, Kirsten. Thank you for the call.
[03:02:08.440 --> 03:02:12.440]  Thank you so much. And we're looking at all the reporters right now trying to budget things.
[03:02:12.440 --> 03:02:15.720]  It's all how much funding we have. I want to hire a bunch of reporters. Don't worry, but we're trying.
[03:02:16.440 --> 03:02:18.520]  Chase, in California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:02:19.560 --> 03:02:23.400]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex, and thank you for what you do for the country.
[03:02:23.400 --> 03:02:24.040]  You bet, brother.
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:28.280]  Let's face the patriot on the front lines of California. I'm fired up about your reporter
[03:02:28.280 --> 03:02:33.480]  challenge as well, and I got my YouTube page fired up. But I want to talk about Trump. He's
[03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:38.920]  turned the corner, I think, with that North Korean peace deal. People across the left,
[03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:43.320]  across the right, everywhere in between, they all seem to start finally figuring out that he's
[03:02:43.320 --> 03:02:48.920]  doing good. And so now the Democrats are striking back. They're doing the same old usual tactic.
[03:02:48.920 --> 03:02:53.400]  It's problem solution. They commit the problem with the influx of immigrants.
[03:02:53.400 --> 03:02:57.400]  They blame Trump. They call him a racist, and then they have the solution. They say,
[03:02:57.400 --> 03:03:01.960]  no more Trump and no more borders. But if we can get out there and put out the narrative by
[03:03:01.960 --> 03:03:06.520]  putting our reports out, like I'm doing, Chase the patriot on YouTube, if we can get out there,
[03:03:06.520 --> 03:03:07.880]  we can put the narrative in those.
[03:03:07.880 --> 03:03:12.040]  I agree. Everyone, whether a video has a thousand views or a hundred million or whatever,
[03:03:12.040 --> 03:03:16.840]  everyone speaking out, everyone engaged, forget the censorship. So what if you're a patriot and
[03:03:16.840 --> 03:03:21.480]  they censor you? The point is, that's because you're effective. Absolutely. Get out there,
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:25.400]  spread the word now more than ever, because people are ready for the truth.
[03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:31.880]  Hey, how about a solution to the problem? You know, let's connect the two stories. So we have
[03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:37.080]  the border base in between North and South Korea. Let's get those troops back and put them on and
[03:03:37.080 --> 03:03:41.960]  create a new border base on our own border to protect our own border, to train our troops,
[03:03:41.960 --> 03:03:43.480]  to kill two birds with one stone.
[03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:50.280]  I totally agree. That'd be a great, we've had a big ceasefire happen in Afghanistan.
[03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:53.880]  I was told Trump was going to beef trips up, just like he did with North Korea,
[03:03:53.880 --> 03:03:58.760]  to make them come to the table and then actually sign a deal, but a real economic deal to help
[03:03:58.760 --> 03:04:02.040]  the people of Afghanistan so that they stop fighting with each other. And now it looks like
[03:04:02.040 --> 03:04:06.840]  they may, that that might happen as well. So we'll see what happens. A build up before we have a
[03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:12.920]  build down. Thank you so much. I appreciate your call. Now to Brian and Charles and Joe and Liberty
[03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:18.520]  and Gerald, I apologize. The war is coming up in an hour. I got a punch out of here because Ali
[03:04:18.520 --> 03:04:24.840]  Alexander has got several big guests lined up. He's got Brandon Darby, who's always down on the
[03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:29.720]  border doing big reporting. The left attacks him and makes stuff up about him. I even published
[03:04:29.720 --> 03:04:34.440]  a note before I apologize. Believe him that left lies about Darby. He's a great guy. He's going to
[03:04:34.440 --> 03:04:37.560]  come up. He's got a lot of great sources on the border. He's going to be breaking that down.
[03:04:38.120 --> 03:04:43.560]  And then we've also got Stephen Franson, who's got a great work on the rise and fight, defeat,
[03:04:43.560 --> 03:04:49.000]  globalism save the West. That's all coming up. The philosopher as well. So whatever you do,
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:52.200]  info wars, links, YouTube, Facebook, spread those links.

[03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:13.240]  me that we are going to overthrow the United States government leading a frontal assault
[03:06:13.240 --> 03:06:17.320]  on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:24.120 --> 03:06:30.520]  Allie Alexander takes over ladies and gentlemen right now needs no introduction political analyst
[03:06:30.520 --> 03:06:36.360]  patriot. Last year going public with something to do behind the scenes. Follow him on twitter at
[03:06:36.360 --> 03:06:42.760]  Allie. He's taken over with a bunch of big guests today that you don't want to miss.
[03:06:42.760 --> 03:06:46.840]  Tell us about those guests that are coming up. Thanks for co-hosting. The broadcast is yours.
[03:06:47.560 --> 03:06:51.960]  Hey Alex, thanks for the mic. I'm going to make it down to Austin sometime and we got to do some
[03:06:51.960 --> 03:06:56.920]  fellowshiping, but we have Steve Franson who is a philosopher. We're going to talk about
[03:06:56.920 --> 03:07:02.120]  fatherliness and why we need to make men more masculine and why we need to reclaim
[03:07:02.120 --> 03:07:08.040]  some of our masculinity in this age of disinformation and then we'll have Brandon Darby with Breitbart
[03:07:08.040 --> 03:07:13.720]  Texas. He's the editor there. He runs the cartel chronicles and he's really taken it to the media
[03:07:13.720 --> 03:07:18.600]  kind of correcting the record that it was actually the Obama administration who is caging children
[03:07:18.600 --> 03:07:23.400]  and the Trump administration that's giving them beds. So we got a really exciting hour
[03:07:23.400 --> 03:07:30.120]  here on the last hour of your show. It's all yours my friend. Thank you. Thank you. Well,
[03:07:30.120 --> 03:07:34.440]  welcome to the Alex Jones show. I'm guest hosting Ali Alexander. You can find me at
[03:07:34.440 --> 03:07:40.200]  twitter, twitter.com slash ALI. I got some pithy thoughts there. I want to introduce my friend
[03:07:40.200 --> 03:07:44.760]  Steven Franson. Let me read his bio. This is kind of awkward when you have to read a friend's bio,
[03:07:44.760 --> 03:07:50.600]  but let's bring in Steve Franson. Steve Franson is a philosopher and author of a book called
[03:07:50.600 --> 03:07:55.880]  Rise and Fight, Defeat Globalism and Save the West. He has a master's of arts and education
[03:07:55.880 --> 03:08:01.560]  with honors. He was an early investor to Bitcoin. Steve has been a life coach and consultant since
[03:08:01.560 --> 03:08:09.080]  2014. His work involves helping people learn about the past, gain crucial empathy, philosophy skills,
[03:08:09.080 --> 03:08:14.520]  and finding their purpose in life. He is passionate about free speech, Western civilization, exercise
[03:08:14.520 --> 03:08:20.680]  and diet, and peaceful parenting. He lives in Montana with his lovely wife, dogs, and newborn
[03:08:20.680 --> 03:08:25.800]  baby daughter. How's the weather there, Steven, in Montana? Because here in Texas, it's a little warm.
[03:08:26.840 --> 03:08:32.600]  Hey Ali, it's nice and cool. It's been raining. It's beautiful here. I love Montana. I'm living
[03:08:32.600 --> 03:08:37.480]  in the Bitterroot Valley, so I got a beautiful view of all the mountains around me. I'm really
[03:08:37.480 --> 03:08:43.400]  happy to be I am for worse today. How are you my friend? I'm doing excellent. It's always an honor
[03:08:43.400 --> 03:08:49.720]  and a privilege when Alex and his awesome team give me the mic and we get to talk about truth.
[03:08:49.720 --> 03:08:54.200]  You know, what I love about the Infowars team is they're not talking down to me or telling me,
[03:08:54.200 --> 03:08:59.960]  okay, Ali, you got to react to the media. We get to be proactive here and talk about survival
[03:08:59.960 --> 03:09:05.240]  skills. So I knew that when I was going to guest host now, I was like, okay, it's time to introduce
[03:09:05.240 --> 03:09:11.560]  folks to Steve Franson. Alex, let me share my philosophy of what I think the future looks like
[03:09:11.560 --> 03:09:17.960]  and how we could operate more peacefully. And what I like about you is we share a lot in common
[03:09:17.960 --> 03:09:22.760]  and how we see the future, but it differs a little bit. And this book that you have is very,
[03:09:22.760 --> 03:09:29.160]  very timely. We have to save Western civilization. We have to defeat these corporates, these oligarchs,
[03:09:30.040 --> 03:09:35.320]  the bankers, the media, the Hollywood. We got to defeat all of them. And what I like about,
[03:09:35.320 --> 03:09:39.960]  you know, your book is, you know, you really tackle some of these issues. A lot of it's
[03:09:39.960 --> 03:09:45.880]  external. We are at war, but a lot of that war starts with ourselves. How would you sum up
[03:09:45.880 --> 03:09:51.320]  the basis of your book? What's, you know, what's your thesis behind the entire book?
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:57.880]  Basically, it's on the drill sergeant in basic. I'm going to run you through what you need to know
[03:09:57.880 --> 03:10:01.640]  as a person that wants to jump into the cultural war. You want to influence people. You want to
[03:10:01.640 --> 03:10:07.400]  reach people. These are some of the basic principles. And then also, I have some ideas, I think of
[03:10:07.400 --> 03:10:13.080]  remedies, some of the illnesses of the West right now, you know, how to get into a hierarchy,
[03:10:13.080 --> 03:10:18.280]  how to form fraternal organizations, how to battle back journalists in the media.
[03:10:18.280 --> 03:10:21.560]  There's different things that I offer in the book that I think are really juicy,
[03:10:21.560 --> 03:10:28.840]  really digestible and very effective. Yeah. And your background isn't, you know, you weren't a
[03:10:28.840 --> 03:10:34.520]  political hack like me, you know, for over a decade, you've been working with people and
[03:10:34.520 --> 03:10:40.600]  as a life coach and doing psychology and time kind of the studies that can make a man stronger.
[03:10:40.600 --> 03:10:45.240]  And one thing that I loved about, you know, your book, you know, you gave me a copy. It's called
[03:10:45.240 --> 03:10:49.720]  there's a chapter called the quality of fatherliness. Well, this was your first
[03:10:50.280 --> 03:10:55.480]  father's day yesterday with your newborn daughter. And, you know, you and I were talking about how
[03:10:55.480 --> 03:11:01.960]  that changed you when you first held your newborn daughter. What changed in you as a man? Because,
[03:11:01.960 --> 03:11:07.640]  you know, you've been somebody who's championing this philosophy. But what was the experience like
[03:11:07.640 --> 03:11:13.720]  and what did that do for your ideas? Right. Well, you know, a lot of you don't know me yet, but I
[03:11:13.720 --> 03:11:18.920]  spend most of my 20s. I'm 32 now. I spend most of my 20s preparing to be a father, really working
[03:11:18.920 --> 03:11:25.240]  on myself. I saw the value of going to therapy, the value of exploring myself. If you're familiar
[03:11:25.240 --> 03:11:31.080]  to Jordan Peterson's works, I'm definitely in that whole Bailey wick. So holding my daughter
[03:11:31.080 --> 03:11:38.120]  for the first time, it was, you know, the scientists say you get a huge drop in testosterone.
[03:11:38.120 --> 03:11:44.360]  And I certainly, I certainly felt like, oh, I'm a father now. I felt something in my brain change.
[03:11:44.360 --> 03:11:51.400]  I felt myself just mellow out, calm down. And really, you know, we talked a bit about this
[03:11:51.400 --> 03:11:56.360]  in a recent stream, we talked about ego death and about your pride, you know, and that's what
[03:11:56.360 --> 03:12:02.440]  Kanya is going through right now. That's what I experienced that myself too. I just felt this
[03:12:02.440 --> 03:12:08.600]  like change over a complete change over. So do you think that that's kind of a natural byproduct
[03:12:08.600 --> 03:12:17.640]  of becoming a father is some of this ego death? Yeah, I would say so because you really, you
[03:12:17.640 --> 03:12:21.800]  have to stop thinking about everything in terms of yourself. You stop formulating in terms of
[03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:25.880]  what's best for me, what's most convenient for me, what is going to serve me here in the near
[03:12:25.880 --> 03:12:30.920]  future. You have to think of the far future. You have to think decades ahead. I like to think
[03:12:30.920 --> 03:12:35.720]  generations ahead. I also wrote a chapter in one of my books recently called Dynasty in Hegemony,
[03:12:35.720 --> 03:12:43.080]  where I talk about really setting up an intergenerational sort of path for your family,
[03:12:43.080 --> 03:12:48.040]  really setting a new way in this information age that we have to be able to have your family set
[03:12:48.040 --> 03:12:52.040]  up far into the future. So I think that's a huge way that your formulations really changes.
[03:12:52.040 --> 03:12:56.600]  They really change. And I certainly have made that change. I think of everything in terms of what's
[03:12:56.600 --> 03:13:01.160]  best for my daughter, what's best for my family, how am I going to do this? What are the optics on
[03:13:01.160 --> 03:13:05.720]  this? What's the empathy here? What do I need to handle in order to make things best for them?
[03:13:06.520 --> 03:13:13.400]  Yeah, and I like that. So tell the audience about this chapter in your book, the quality of
[03:13:13.400 --> 03:13:23.320]  fatherliness. Kind of give us an overview of what's behind that quality. Sure. Well, I name
[03:13:23.320 --> 03:13:28.680]  it a few different things in the essay, but first and foremost is protectiveness. You really want
[03:13:28.680 --> 03:13:35.720]  to practice protectiveness as a father. You are really the immune system for your family as a father
[03:13:35.720 --> 03:13:42.200]  and especially for your children. Children who grow up without fathers, girls start puberty earlier,
[03:13:42.200 --> 03:13:48.760]  they are prone to more sexual activity. Boys who are without fathers, they are prone. They
[03:13:48.760 --> 03:13:54.360]  are more involved in mass shootings. I think 95% of the mass shooters had father issues. They had
[03:13:54.360 --> 03:14:00.280]  absent fathers. You're also more prone to volatility, inability to control your emotions
[03:14:00.280 --> 03:14:05.160]  and stuff like this. So really, you want to be the immune system for your family. And that is
[03:14:05.160 --> 03:14:10.680]  really encapsulated in protectiveness. And I also talk about providing. Providing is huge. Providing
[03:14:10.680 --> 03:14:16.840]  is all the success industry combined, everything you need to know about real estate, everything
[03:14:16.840 --> 03:14:21.480]  you need to know about networking, all this stuff. It really hooks into this fundamental drive we have
[03:14:21.480 --> 03:14:26.840]  as fathers to really provide for our children. So you really are the psychological backbone for
[03:14:26.840 --> 03:14:32.920]  the family as a father. And of course, we live in a time where fatherhood is just not really in
[03:14:32.920 --> 03:14:37.240]  the zeitgeist. It's really not the thing right now. We've really lost our way in the West.
[03:14:37.240 --> 03:14:45.000]  Yeah, it's really a shame. And I tell my readers and my viewers on Periscope this all the time
[03:14:45.560 --> 03:14:55.160]  is that we as a Western civilization have imploded more than we've been invaded. And the war is on
[03:14:55.160 --> 03:15:03.640]  multiple fronts. And what I like about some of your work is it does kind of evoke Jordan Peterson.
[03:15:03.640 --> 03:15:08.200]  It's like clean your room. And it's like find purpose. And he talks, you know, Dr. Peterson
[03:15:08.200 --> 03:15:12.600]  talks about all these emails that he gets from young men saying, I found my purpose. Thank you
[03:15:12.600 --> 03:15:18.280]  so much. Or Stefan Molyneux, you know, who harkens back to some of these age old principles that
[03:15:18.280 --> 03:15:24.680]  will keep us a healthy and a stable society. We're about to go to break. But when we come back,
[03:15:24.680 --> 03:15:30.440]  Stephen, I want to talk about some of these qualities that men need to learn and some of
[03:15:30.440 --> 03:15:36.840]  these qualities that they can implement immediately to become the alpha, the protector of their homes
[03:15:36.840 --> 03:15:41.320]  and their families. It's going to be very, very awesome. You are listening to the Alex Jones
[03:15:41.320 --> 03:15:46.120]  show here on Info Wars. I am your guest host, Ollie Alexander. We're talking to Steve Franson.
[03:15:46.120 --> 03:15:48.200]  We'll be back on the other side of the break.
[03:15:53.240 --> 03:15:57.400]  Healthcare reform is confusing. But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan,
[03:15:57.400 --> 03:16:01.960]  keeping your doctor or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system
[03:16:01.960 --> 03:16:07.480]  has become a challenge. Control your own health care costs and choices with Liberty Health Share.

[03:17:30.680 --> 03:17:35.560]  written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever. We're in a constitutional

[03:18:59.080 --> 03:19:04.120]  seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify
[03:19:04.120 --> 03:19:09.800]  the body. That's why I'm introducing Z Shield. Toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's

[03:19:15.480 --> 03:19:21.240]  detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula
[03:19:21.240 --> 03:19:26.040]  that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to
[03:19:26.040 --> 03:19:30.840]  perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it
[03:19:30.840 --> 03:19:35.880]  to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as

[03:19:50.680 --> 03:20:02.520]  our bodies with Z Shield InfoWarsLife.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:05.880 --> 03:20:11.160]  Take people, take people, take people, take people, take people, and you expose them, expose them,
[03:20:11.160 --> 03:20:19.480]  expose them, expose them, expose them to things that they are avoiding. If you are receiving this
[03:20:19.480 --> 03:20:29.960]  transmission, you are the resistance. If for 10 years you didn't avoid doing what you knew you needed to do,
[03:20:31.960 --> 03:20:36.600]  I love that. You know what that is? That's what the kids call a banger. It's called a banger,
[03:20:36.600 --> 03:20:43.960]  that type of synthwave EDM that has some audio stuff in it. You know, I'm 32 but now I'm sounding
[03:20:43.960 --> 03:20:49.720]  like a boomer myself. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show here on InfoWars. I am hosting for
[03:20:49.720 --> 03:20:54.920]  this last hour and it's a privilege and an honor to do so. I'm Ali Alexander. You can find me on
[03:20:54.920 --> 03:21:01.320]  YouTube and the onlines. I'm joined by my friend Steve Franton and we're going over a list but
[03:21:01.320 --> 03:21:09.240]  that song, Stephen, you've seen, it's a band called, it's a DJ duo called Milk and Cooks.
[03:21:09.240 --> 03:21:15.800]  That's an unreleased song so that was an exclusive here for InfoWars and they were actually at
[03:21:15.800 --> 03:21:21.240]  Mike Cernovich's A Night for Freedom, both as DC and New York party and I know that you're
[03:21:21.240 --> 03:21:26.600]  into some synthwave stuff. Stephen, was that a nice tease for you? How did that sound?
[03:21:27.640 --> 03:21:32.600]  That was a nice tease. I love the synthwave stuff. I love what Milk and Cooks have done.
[03:21:32.600 --> 03:21:37.640]  I was able to catch them with you. I went to A Night for Freedom in New York City and I thought
[03:21:37.640 --> 03:21:43.160]  they did an incredible job. They had dancers. These guys are pure swine so Milk and Cooks,
[03:21:43.160 --> 03:21:48.440]  that's a great plug. Yeah, they're these beautiful blonde, bulky twins out of Chicago
[03:21:48.440 --> 03:21:54.280]  and what's funny is I'm going to out them. I hope that the mainstream media doesn't record this but
[03:21:54.280 --> 03:22:00.440]  sometimes what they say that they'll do in their shows with 20 or more thousand people is they'll
[03:22:00.440 --> 03:22:05.640]  play little clips of Alex Jones kind of putting it into the zeitgeist. We're everywhere folks.
[03:22:05.640 --> 03:22:11.560]  The info warriors, the true resistance, we're truly, truly everywhere. What I want to do is I want
[03:22:11.560 --> 03:22:17.560]  to get back into this chapter, the quality of fatherliness in your book titled Rise and Fight.
[03:22:17.560 --> 03:22:23.880]  People can order that already on Amazon. In this, you say a man can build up his ability to serve
[03:22:23.880 --> 03:22:27.880]  as a protector to his family in any of the following ways. So we're going to give you this
[03:22:27.880 --> 03:22:32.200]  list. If you're at home, you want to be writing this down right now. If you're listening via radio,
[03:22:32.200 --> 03:22:38.360]  you want to pull over. The first way you say is owning guns, practicing gun safety and target
[03:22:38.360 --> 03:22:45.560]  accuracy. The second thing you say is maintaining physical fitness such that a violent attack
[03:22:45.560 --> 03:22:52.600]  from an outgroup assailant could be met with lethal force if necessary, if lawful and if
[03:22:52.600 --> 03:22:59.000]  necessary. The third you say is practicing situational awareness in all environments
[03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:08.440]  where a man's family will or can be. Next you say owning a trained guard dog or guard dog breed.
[03:23:08.440 --> 03:23:13.000]  Wow, I'm like tripping over my words right now. Next you say choosing a safe neighborhood for
[03:23:13.000 --> 03:23:18.120]  one's family to live in. This is very important. My mother was a single mother and the single best
[03:23:18.120 --> 03:23:24.680]  decision she made was making sure that we got in a good neighborhood with a good school district
[03:23:24.680 --> 03:23:30.440]  and that allowed us opportunities to choose our path in life where so many get trapped in this
[03:23:30.440 --> 03:23:36.120]  urban environment of decay. And then lastly you say exercising good taste and psychological
[03:23:36.120 --> 03:23:43.080]  judiciousness in terms of the people and information a man allows into his home.
[03:23:43.080 --> 03:23:50.120]  I talk about this for hours every week on my periscope that the media is literally speech
[03:23:50.120 --> 03:23:57.000]  control so that they can control your thoughts. If they add the adjectives, you know, controversial
[03:23:57.640 --> 03:24:02.520]  for Republicans and then they say, oh, watch this powerful speech from, you know, the rapist Bill
[03:24:02.520 --> 03:24:09.400]  Clinton, the alleged rapist Bill Clinton, which I totally think he did it folks. But, you know,
[03:24:09.400 --> 03:24:15.640]  then it kind of already sets the frame, if you will. Scott Adams talks about this. And so this
[03:24:15.640 --> 03:24:20.760]  list, you know, how practical is this list? Is there anything else you would tell men who are
[03:24:20.760 --> 03:24:26.120]  fathers that, you know, this is what you immediately can do right now, right now, right now, right now
[03:24:26.120 --> 03:24:30.760]  if you want to become the alpha protector of your home? Right. Well, something else that I really
[03:24:30.760 --> 03:24:36.520]  stress and I have stressed for years is cultivate sobriety. I'm not talking about, you know, go full
[03:24:36.520 --> 03:24:41.560]  tea total or anything like this, but really know what you want to do with your life. Really
[03:24:41.560 --> 03:24:46.440]  cultivate a straight straight edge, really some kind of focus so that you understand how it is
[03:24:46.440 --> 03:24:52.200]  that you're going to manifest your meaning in this life, how you are going to expand out how you're
[03:24:52.200 --> 03:24:56.520]  going to conquer physical the physical world, how you're going to be present for your family.
[03:24:56.520 --> 03:25:00.440]  That's all about being sober, being focused and being aware. So it really has a lot to do with
[03:25:00.440 --> 03:25:06.040]  mindset. That's why we see a lot of the mindset industry really taking off because you're really
[03:25:06.040 --> 03:25:10.360]  looking for answers and they're really looking, how can I get to that next level? How can I even
[03:25:10.360 --> 03:25:15.880]  start a family? How can I even get a woman? How can I keep this? How can I maintain it? I really
[03:25:15.880 --> 03:25:20.200]  think that has a lot to do with sobriety, really knowing yourself and staying consistent over time.
[03:25:20.200 --> 03:25:25.320]  Certainly that's how I've done it. I'm reaping the rewards. I live in a great place here in Montana.
[03:25:25.320 --> 03:25:30.040]  I've done all those things on that list. I've got my guns. I got my dog. I got my wife. I got my
[03:25:30.040 --> 03:25:34.120]  friends. I got everything lined up. And so that's what I offered to people. I'm really living the
[03:25:34.120 --> 03:25:39.080]  message and a lot of that has to do with my living clean. You know, a lot of people don't know this
[03:25:39.080 --> 03:25:45.240]  in marketing because I've been doing political marketing for 11 years. You have the user and
[03:25:45.240 --> 03:25:51.960]  the buyer. The user may not always be the buyer. For example, men's underwear, it's something like
[03:25:51.960 --> 03:25:58.920]  70 to 80% of men's underwear is actually purchased by women. So it's used by men, but women make the
[03:25:58.920 --> 03:26:05.560]  purchases, which is why advertisements look the way they do. They're more glowing. There's some
[03:26:05.560 --> 03:26:14.920]  hair in there. Women are looking for a certain type of idealistic picture, a meme, if you will,
[03:26:15.800 --> 03:26:21.160]  that they want to see their man in. And so then that's what the man ends up wearing.
[03:26:21.160 --> 03:26:26.280]  What's your message to women about this book? And in particular, this chapter, what's the
[03:26:26.280 --> 03:26:36.360]  sell for women? Why do they need to also promote good fatherhood, not stay at home fathers, but
[03:26:36.360 --> 03:26:41.560]  present fathers? Right. Well, if you don't want all the bad things happening to your kids that
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:46.280]  are markers of lack of fatherhood, then you're going to want to be one of those women that really
[03:26:46.280 --> 03:26:51.880]  encourages a man to be strong, a man to do what is right. I mean, that's really the sell is that
[03:26:51.880 --> 03:26:56.280]  it's a win-win. You know, I'm all about win-wins. I've really learned that that's how you have to
[03:26:56.280 --> 03:27:00.920]  handle it in society. That's how we're going to save the West. And if we can restore the relationship
[03:27:00.920 --> 03:27:05.080]  between man and woman, so they're both seeking win-wins for each other. They're seeking to help
[03:27:05.080 --> 03:27:10.200]  each other, to keep each other inspired. I mean, having a strong man in the home is a really great
[03:27:10.200 --> 03:27:15.400]  thing for women. It's a pretty easy sell once you allow women to really experience what it is to have
[03:27:15.400 --> 03:27:19.720]  a great protector around. What it is to have a man that takes an interest in the children,
[03:27:19.720 --> 03:27:24.520]  a man that can put on his game face and go out and bring home the bacon, but then come home
[03:27:24.520 --> 03:27:29.480]  and be firm and assertive and gentle with the children. I mean, that is just paradise.
[03:27:29.480 --> 03:27:33.800]  Parenthood is absolute paradise. You know, Mike Sernich will attest to that. He certainly said
[03:27:33.800 --> 03:27:38.680]  that on his Twitter recently, I'm in full agreement. So I think it's a pretty easy sell,
[03:27:38.680 --> 03:27:43.560]  but it's a matter of, as Jordan Peterson was saying right before we came back on,
[03:27:43.560 --> 03:27:47.080]  he was saying, you got to make people aware of what they've been in denial of, what they've been
[03:27:47.080 --> 03:27:52.040]  afraid of fitting to themselves. So there really are a lot of women out there that if they could
[03:27:52.040 --> 03:27:56.760]  really just admit it to themselves for one second, what it would be like to have a great man around
[03:27:56.760 --> 03:28:01.160]  or a great father, what kind of joy that would bring? I think that's the sell right there.
[03:28:01.880 --> 03:28:07.480]  That's the sell. The book is Rise and Fight. That's if you want to defeat the globalist.
[03:28:07.480 --> 03:28:13.400]  If you want to fight to save the best parts of Western civilization, I still say that there's
[03:28:13.400 --> 03:28:18.200]  some parts that suck. There's some parts, you know, the decisions that are the downfall of the West
[03:28:18.200 --> 03:28:23.400]  were determined by the West. Steve, I'm so glad that you joined us. We'll have to have you back
[03:28:23.400 --> 03:28:29.640]  again. I know that Alex wants a lot more philosophy here on Infowars, because we have to equip people.
[03:28:29.640 --> 03:28:33.240]  I think this is why people are buying supplements at the Infowars store. I think that this is why
[03:28:33.240 --> 03:28:39.400]  people are getting into mindset. Thanks so much for joining us. We're about to hop on to a break
[03:28:39.400 --> 03:28:44.200]  and then talk about the board of it. Thank you, Stephen Franson. Thanks for having me, Ollie.

[03:30:15.080 --> 03:30:20.520]  on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word. You are the Infowar. And now,
[03:30:20.520 --> 03:30:25.160]  because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to

[03:31:54.040 --> 03:31:59.720]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here
[03:31:59.720 --> 03:32:05.160]  in Leilani estates. But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned
[03:32:05.160 --> 03:32:12.360]  about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[03:32:12.360 --> 03:32:18.360]  the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy
[03:32:18.360 --> 03:32:24.520]  metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy
[03:32:24.520 --> 03:32:31.000]  metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[03:32:31.000 --> 03:32:36.840]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to
[03:32:36.840 --> 03:32:43.400]  optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:43.400 --> 03:32:49.080]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:49.080 --> 03:32:53.160]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:53.160 --> 03:33:03.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:03.880 --> 03:33:26.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. We're here on InfoWars. I'm just hosting this last hour for
[03:33:26.200 --> 03:33:31.400]  Alex. We just wrapped up an awesome 30 minutes with Steve Franson, which we talked about the
[03:33:31.400 --> 03:33:36.440]  importance of fatherhood. And not just from the perspective of a man, but also the perspective
[03:33:36.440 --> 03:33:42.920]  of a woman and how we can save the West. And that half hour was focused on what we could do
[03:33:42.920 --> 03:33:49.320]  internally, but externally, we're facing still great threats to the West. And so I wanted to spend
[03:33:49.320 --> 03:33:54.840]  this last half hour separating fact from fiction, because even me, someone who does this political
[03:33:54.840 --> 03:34:00.040]  stuff full time, I have troubles separating fact from fiction when it comes to this
[03:34:00.040 --> 03:34:05.640]  border crisis. Are we caging children? Are we not? Are the Democrats in the media lying or
[03:34:05.640 --> 03:34:11.160]  aren't they? Where are the Republicans on this issue? So I knew I had to bring on one of the,
[03:34:11.160 --> 03:34:17.240]  you know, actually, he is the best in the business on the border. Brandon Darby is the editor at
[03:34:17.240 --> 03:34:22.280]  Breitbart, Texas. I don't have a bio to read for him because we've known each other so long.
[03:34:22.280 --> 03:34:28.440]  He was mentored by Andrew Breitbart himself, one of the last originals from those heydays,
[03:34:28.440 --> 03:34:32.120]  a good friend of mine, a good friend of the movement, and a good friend of truth. I mean,
[03:34:32.120 --> 03:34:37.800]  he does not, he doesn't tow a line. He has the cartel chronicles over there at Breitbart, Texas,
[03:34:37.800 --> 03:34:41.800]  and he doesn't tow the line. But Brandon, thanks for making time for us today.
[03:34:43.240 --> 03:34:49.080]  Hey, Ali, thanks for having me on. I appreciate it. And yeah, I'm glad to be on. I think it's
[03:34:49.080 --> 03:34:53.080]  really important. There's a lot of information swirling around, a lot of misinformation,
[03:34:53.080 --> 03:34:59.000]  a lot of mischaracterized information. And I think it's important that all groups,
[03:35:00.120 --> 03:35:02.600]  you know, hear what's going on and have a discussion about it.
[03:35:03.480 --> 03:35:07.720]  Yeah, that's what I'm all about. And I think that that's this new age that, you know, whether
[03:35:07.720 --> 03:35:12.280]  you like Donald Trump or you don't, whether you like Kanye West or you don't, this is something
[03:35:12.280 --> 03:35:16.600]  Andrew would want is everyone talking to everyone. So thanks for joining us. I want to ask you a
[03:35:16.600 --> 03:35:22.120]  bunch of stupid questions. And then you tell us what's factor fiction. Are their children presently
[03:35:22.120 --> 03:35:30.360]  in, you know, cage-like jails right now? Yes. And why is that? What is it? Is it?
[03:35:32.360 --> 03:35:37.720]  Okay. So this is where, you know, and again, I mean, some of, you know, some of the listeners,
[03:35:37.720 --> 03:35:43.960]  I'm sure, are not going to appreciate some of what I have to say, but I'm going to say it, you know,
[03:35:43.960 --> 03:35:48.760]  there's a lot of stuff that's said about what's happening at the border, a lot of stuff that
[03:35:48.760 --> 03:35:54.760]  that goes on at the border that the truth is actually horrifying enough, especially in Tom
[03:35:54.760 --> 03:35:59.800]  Olipis, the south of Texas, and then Coahuila and Nuevo León, these three Mexican states
[03:35:59.800 --> 03:36:07.000]  immediately south of Texas. But a lot of the things that people get carried away on are just
[03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:12.840]  not true. Like, you know, a lot of, and I'm not trying to be ugly, but I do think info was,
[03:36:12.840 --> 03:36:18.120]  I might have participated in it, with this like child sex trafficking camp in Tucson, you know,
[03:36:18.120 --> 03:36:23.240]  I looked into that and it just wasn't true. And, you know, there's a lot of things, the thing about,
[03:36:24.520 --> 03:36:31.960]  you know, the training camp in Juarez outside of El Paso for ISIS, that just wasn't true.
[03:36:31.960 --> 03:36:39.080]  And there's a lot of these things that we get carried away, and rabbit trails we go down,
[03:36:39.640 --> 03:36:44.840]  that they're just not helpful, you know, they're just not helpful to the cause, they're not helpful
[03:36:44.840 --> 03:36:49.880]  to the cause of securing the border, or if your cause is just bringing more attention to what goes
[03:36:49.880 --> 03:36:55.000]  on in the border region, right? They're just not helpful. So, so being on here is very important
[03:36:55.000 --> 03:37:00.600]  to me, because I can, you know, I do think that there's a lot of important things that come from
[03:37:00.600 --> 03:37:08.280]  info wars. And I think it's very, very important that you're there, you know, all outlets have
[03:37:08.280 --> 03:37:15.800]  made mistakes. And it happens. So, so that said, and that squared away, let's talk about what really
[03:37:15.800 --> 03:37:20.920]  goes on. You know, as most of the info wars listeners probably know, because I think they
[03:37:20.920 --> 03:37:27.640]  generally stay very informed about border issues and sovereignty issues. The US-Mexico border is
[03:37:27.640 --> 03:37:35.480]  roughly 2000 miles long. That 2000 mile long border has nine border patrol sectors, okay?
[03:37:35.480 --> 03:37:45.320]  Texas has five of those sectors. Now, three of those sectors are areas of border that are controlled
[03:37:45.320 --> 03:37:50.520]  by two criminal groups. We call it transnational criminal groups. Most people just simply call
[03:37:50.520 --> 03:37:59.320]  them Mexican cartels. And those Mexican cartels, they, some of the factions routinely make more
[03:37:59.320 --> 03:38:03.720]  money from illegal immigration than they do from narcotics. That's something a lot of people don't
[03:38:03.720 --> 03:38:08.760]  realize. Like human trafficking. Is that what you're saying? Well, no, not human trafficking.
[03:38:08.760 --> 03:38:13.720]  Some of it's human trafficking, but human smuggling, right? So, people who voluntarily enter the
[03:38:13.720 --> 03:38:18.920]  situation. And so, people need to understand this, that all of those nine sectors on the border
[03:38:18.920 --> 03:38:24.360]  are controlled by different Mexican cartels. And they all have different MOs. They all have
[03:38:24.360 --> 03:38:29.320]  different personalities and types and ways that they do business. As you move west along the
[03:38:29.320 --> 03:38:36.040]  border towards California and through California, those Mexican cartel groups tend to be much more
[03:38:36.040 --> 03:38:41.320]  professional. They tend to make sure that their violence doesn't implicate or doesn't hurt as
[03:38:41.320 --> 03:38:47.880]  many innocent bystanders as- You said as we move west. As you move west. But now when you get below
[03:38:47.880 --> 03:38:53.480]  Texas, specifically the Rio Grande Valley sector, the Laredo sector and the Del Rio sector,
[03:38:53.480 --> 03:39:00.440]  that's Los Zetas and that's the Gulf cartel. Now those two groups, they tend to be a lot more
[03:39:00.440 --> 03:39:05.880]  ruthless with average citizens. Their violence does affect other people and they tend to make
[03:39:05.880 --> 03:39:11.240]  decisions that don't care about, necessarily care about tomorrow. That's why when we had the migrant
[03:39:11.240 --> 03:39:17.640]  crisis in 2014, you saw the influx was largely in the Rio Grande Valley sector and the Laredo
[03:39:17.640 --> 03:39:22.840]  sector and the Del Rio sector. It was in the area controlled by the Gulf cartel in Los Zetas
[03:39:22.840 --> 03:39:26.760]  because they didn't care about tomorrow. The Sinaloa cartel out west, they said,
[03:39:26.760 --> 03:39:31.480]  hey, wait a minute. If we put all these kids going through, we're going to make a lot of money doing
[03:39:31.480 --> 03:39:36.600]  it, but it's going to increase the law enforcement presence, which is going to hurt us in the long
[03:39:36.600 --> 03:39:40.680]  term. It's going to hurt our profits in the long term, so we're not going to do it. We're not going
[03:39:40.680 --> 03:39:46.120]  to let them cross. Well, that's why most people tend to cross in the Rio Grande Valley sector.
[03:39:46.120 --> 03:39:51.960]  It's more dangerous. It is much more dangerous because those criminal groups
[03:39:51.960 --> 03:39:57.480]  don't care about tomorrow. If you imagine, if they don't care about tomorrow, they're much
[03:39:57.480 --> 03:40:03.880]  more likely to do things that are more violent, more extreme, not care if they hurt innocent
[03:40:03.880 --> 03:40:11.400]  people. This is the context that all fits with it. Now, when people leave Central America
[03:40:11.400 --> 03:40:15.480]  and they're on their journey to the US, the majority of women from Central America are
[03:40:15.480 --> 03:40:20.680]  sexually assaulted along that journey. They come into the US where they're usually sexually
[03:40:20.680 --> 03:40:25.000]  assaulted more. It is a very violent, unhumanitarian.
[03:40:28.280 --> 03:40:32.360]  This is my problem with what I think the media is trying to do. They're trying to get
[03:40:32.920 --> 03:40:39.000]  President Trump and the DHS to say, okay, we're going to release parents when they show up with
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:44.360]  their children. We're not going to implement this zero tolerance policy that Attorney General
[03:40:44.360 --> 03:40:49.720]  Jeff Sessions has had. What that's going to actually do is encourage more women and children
[03:40:49.720 --> 03:40:55.560]  to participate in this system of sex, drugs, and assault. That's something I don't want.
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:41:03.480]  Right. I'll get there. The bottom line is that no one crosses that border
[03:41:04.120 --> 03:41:09.400]  without paying a cartel. It just doesn't happen. You pay the cartel and you continue
[03:41:09.400 --> 03:41:14.360]  to make payments to the cartel. If your child is crossing, then the family is paying the cartel.
[03:41:14.360 --> 03:41:21.000]  We could go down the whole list of litany of issues, but nobody just crosses. It isn't like
[03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:25.240]  a guy in the mountains in Guatemala is like, hey, I'm going to make a journey and work and
[03:41:25.240 --> 03:41:29.640]  better my life. No, he has to get an agent. That agent has to deal with the Mexican, the
[03:41:29.640 --> 03:41:36.120]  transnational criminal group. That group works out a price. Then that guy agrees to make payments.
[03:41:36.120 --> 03:41:41.320]  If he doesn't, his family gets killed. He willfully enters that situation trying to find work
[03:41:41.320 --> 03:41:49.160]  in the US. There's a lot of complicated to it. The bottom line is when people cross the border
[03:41:49.800 --> 03:41:55.960]  and they're arrested and apprehended, the same thing that happens to me and you happens to them.
[03:41:56.520 --> 03:42:00.920]  If I'm driving down the road in my car and I don't pay a speeding ticket and I have a warrant
[03:42:00.920 --> 03:42:05.240]  for my arrest, I'm going to get pulled over. When I get pulled over, the cop is going to say,
[03:42:05.240 --> 03:42:09.800]  you have a warrant for your arrest. I have to arrest you. Then I'm going to say, wait, I have my
[03:42:09.800 --> 03:42:16.920]  child in the car and the cop isn't, he's not going to say hello. In that case, I can't arrest you.
[03:42:16.920 --> 03:42:23.560]  Go on. No, he's going to go. Do you have a family member nearby you can call? If I say no, then
[03:42:23.560 --> 03:42:29.240]  he's going to call social services and social services is going to pick up my child until I'm
[03:42:29.240 --> 03:42:33.400]  not in jail. That's what's going to happen. They're not going to put my daughter in a jail cell.
[03:42:33.400 --> 03:42:39.400]  Yeah, I'll wait around. Yeah, thanks for hanging on. Brandon Darby with the editor of

[03:47:32.920 --> 03:47:40.200]  here on info wars. I'm so privileged to be closing out the hour. I am your host Ali Alexander. We
[03:47:40.200 --> 03:47:44.680]  have on the phone one of my dearest friends in the conservative movement, the political movement,
[03:47:44.680 --> 03:47:50.200]  in the movement to restore individuals to keep nation sovereign Brandon Darby from Breitbart,
[03:47:50.200 --> 03:47:55.560]  Texas. You know what I will say is this is what I love. What I love is that with Breitbart and
[03:47:55.560 --> 03:48:02.040]  info wars, I can have an honest discussion where I can ask any question I want and we will push out
[03:48:02.040 --> 03:48:09.880]  corrections. We will push out retractions because Lord knows there's not enough money on the Breitbart
[03:48:09.880 --> 03:48:16.600]  side or the info wars side to keep journalism funded like the multi-billion dollar mainstream
[03:48:16.600 --> 03:48:21.000]  media, lame stream media, you know, kind of apparatus. They're not covering these stories
[03:48:21.000 --> 03:48:27.720]  that Brandon is in his cartel chronicles or what info wars is with some of their border coverage.
[03:48:27.720 --> 03:48:33.880]  Brandon, you were talking about these children and how the same thing that would happen to you
[03:48:33.880 --> 03:48:38.360]  or I, you know, I don't have, I'm an uncle but I'm not a father, but if you were with
[03:48:38.360 --> 03:48:43.480]  your daughter and you got pulled over, they would separate you from your child because
[03:48:43.480 --> 03:48:49.880]  you would be detained and why should we put children in adult prisons? It seems like a toxic
[03:48:49.880 --> 03:48:54.840]  argument that the media is trying to make for political purposes. Like they have a policy
[03:48:54.840 --> 03:49:02.440]  goal at the end of this. Is that true? I would say that's accurate. That's how I look at it.
[03:49:03.720 --> 03:49:08.200]  And that's what I was trying to explain earlier. So when people first come across the border and
[03:49:08.200 --> 03:49:13.480]  they get arrested, they get put into a holding facility. If you get put into a holding facility
[03:49:13.480 --> 03:49:20.360]  and there's mass numbers of people, they can't have a Hilton hotel room for everyone who gets
[03:49:20.360 --> 03:49:25.800]  arrested at the border. So what happens is they put them in a large room and because some people
[03:49:25.800 --> 03:49:30.840]  are good people and some people are bad people, some people are five years old and some people
[03:49:30.840 --> 03:49:36.920]  are 30 or 50, what they do is they separate them with chain link. They have dividers in
[03:49:36.920 --> 03:49:43.080]  between people so it's done to protect people. I don't really know another way that it could be
[03:49:43.080 --> 03:49:49.320]  done and that is a temporary situation. If it's a child, they don't stay there long and then
[03:49:49.320 --> 03:49:55.240]  they're taken by human services and then they're put into a nicer facility that resembles a group
[03:49:55.240 --> 03:50:00.360]  home for children. So when you say, are there people in cages? Yes, there are. Are there kids?
[03:50:00.360 --> 03:50:07.480]  Initially there are. Yes. They're in chain link. They're in rooms that are with chain link dividers
[03:50:07.480 --> 03:50:15.080]  between them and other individuals for the child's safety. Is that ideal? No. Do I think that's
[03:50:15.080 --> 03:50:21.320]  horrible? Yes, I do. Do I think there's another way to do it? No, I really don't. I can't think of
[03:50:21.320 --> 03:50:26.760]  another way to do it unless you use bars or unless you use concrete blocks, which in which case then
[03:50:26.760 --> 03:50:33.000]  they'd be putting kids in cells, right? What do you do? So if you look at what's occurred
[03:50:33.720 --> 03:50:38.520]  many years ago in the Bush years, a lot of folks in Austin where I think the largest
[03:50:38.520 --> 03:50:43.720]  infowars base is, that's where infowars is based, a lot of folks will remember people
[03:50:43.720 --> 03:50:49.960]  protesting in Hutto at the Hutto Family Detention Center, Immigration Detention Center. And the
[03:50:49.960 --> 03:50:55.560]  left demanded that those Family Detention Centers be shut down. Well, you know what? The Family
[03:50:55.560 --> 03:51:02.440]  Detention Centers were shut down. And now the left is demanding that people don't be held
[03:51:02.440 --> 03:51:09.400]  independently. So it's like, well, okay, so if you can't hold people as a family and you can't
[03:51:09.400 --> 03:51:15.160]  hold people individually, so in other words, don't hold anyone. Just allow everyone in the world who
[03:51:15.160 --> 03:51:20.280]  wants to come to come and stay in America. That's not a good situation. And if the policy is that
[03:51:20.280 --> 03:51:25.240]  anyone with a child gets to come and stay and doesn't get detained, everyone who comes will bring a
[03:51:25.240 --> 03:51:30.840]  child. And this is not a good situation that's sustainable. Milton Friedman talked about this.
[03:51:30.840 --> 03:51:36.840]  You can't have open borders and have a system of entitlements in a social net. You can't have both.
[03:51:36.840 --> 03:51:43.000]  It's not sustainable. It's not sustainable. The only people that I see it sustaining is the
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:47.880]  cartels. And, you know, Brandon, I was reading your article, you know, on Breitbart, Texas last
[03:51:47.880 --> 03:51:52.920]  night, you know, these chain link partitions is what I would call them. And that's what you guys
[03:51:52.920 --> 03:52:01.400]  called them. And I was thinking is, you know, this allows officers to see what's going on. You know,
[03:52:01.400 --> 03:52:06.760]  they can't build these permanent institutions that would cost us billions and billions of dollars
[03:52:06.760 --> 03:52:12.280]  that would essentially be jail cells. But instead, this is like triage. When you go to the hospital,
[03:52:12.280 --> 03:52:18.520]  the nurse performs triage. She decides who goes what, where, how soon someone needs attention.
[03:52:18.520 --> 03:52:23.880]  In jail, it's called booking or processing. And unfortunately, this is just a part of the process.
[03:52:23.880 --> 03:52:29.320]  But it's the easiest, I think, fastest, safest way to get into a situation where they can monitor
[03:52:29.320 --> 03:52:33.000]  the entire situation, make sure no one's being bullied. And then, like you said, then they're
[03:52:33.000 --> 03:52:39.720]  put into a type of foster care situation. What was the Obama administration's policy
[03:52:39.720 --> 03:52:45.800]  in regards to this, this policy or how children are treated? Were they in cages under the Obama
[03:52:45.800 --> 03:52:51.320]  administration as well? Well, yeah, if we're going to use that terminology, yes, they were.
[03:52:51.320 --> 03:52:56.360]  That the exact same facilities that Trump is using are the exact same facilities that Barack
[03:52:56.360 --> 03:53:04.440]  Obama used. So my issue is that I'm glad people are horrified about the realities along our
[03:53:04.440 --> 03:53:09.480]  border. I think that's wonderful. I don't want to discourage that in any way. My problem is that
[03:53:09.480 --> 03:53:16.680]  when I see them blaming it on Trump, when really it's not on Trump, that's just the same facilities.
[03:53:16.680 --> 03:53:21.720]  And they were silent even though the information was available. And they were silent during the
[03:53:21.720 --> 03:53:26.280]  Obama years. It makes me feel like they're doing it with a political motive rather than an altruistic
[03:53:26.280 --> 03:53:31.640]  or a humanitarian motive. And that's where my objection comes in. But I remind people that
[03:53:31.640 --> 03:53:38.840]  the difference right now is that what Barack Obama did after 2009, he started to change it.
[03:53:38.840 --> 03:53:43.080]  He started to not really enforce certain laws. And he basically said, look, if you're a kid or
[03:53:43.080 --> 03:53:47.160]  you come with an adult, we're not going to keep you in custody. And then he's formalized that in
[03:53:47.160 --> 03:53:53.640]  2014 with what's called the November 20th J. Johnson memo. And so basically what he did is
[03:53:53.640 --> 03:53:58.280]  he goes, I don't care what laws Congress passed, this is what I'm going to do. I'm just not going
[03:53:58.280 --> 03:54:04.040]  to prosecute those laws. And what Trump is saying is no, that we're a nation of laws and we're going
[03:54:04.040 --> 03:54:09.240]  to prosecute the laws. If you violate the laws, you're going to get prosecuted. This is what happens
[03:54:09.240 --> 03:54:15.800]  if you get prosecuted. And here's the deal. If you don't like the laws, Congress needs to change
[03:54:15.800 --> 03:54:21.320]  the laws, but don't just leave the laws alone to protect yourself politically and expect me to
[03:54:21.320 --> 03:54:26.440]  ignore the laws whenever we're a nation of laws, because that is what makes us different from Mexico
[03:54:26.440 --> 03:54:30.760]  is we are a nation of laws. Yes, we have corruption. Yes, we have a lot of problems,
[03:54:30.760 --> 03:54:37.800]  but not in comparison and context. We really don't compare to Mexico. And us being a nation
[03:54:37.800 --> 03:54:43.320]  of laws is why our economy thrives. It's why a lot of it is part of that. And so we need to retain
[03:54:43.320 --> 03:54:48.840]  that. And you can't just say, okay, you people never mind about the law. You have to change the
[03:54:48.840 --> 03:54:53.720]  law. And that's what he's saying. And that's what he's doing. And so is he separating children?
[03:54:53.720 --> 03:54:58.600]  Is it happening more than under Obama? Yes, it is because he's following the law more than Obama
[03:54:58.600 --> 03:55:05.560]  did. Obama literally just said, hey, I'm not going to follow that law. And to be fair, the
[03:55:05.560 --> 03:55:09.800]  Republicans could change the laws now. They have enough control, even though they don't have a super
[03:55:09.800 --> 03:55:15.720]  majority in the Senate, they could do it. They have had the super majority and chose not to do it.
[03:55:15.720 --> 03:55:21.080]  And then in 2009 and 10, the Democrats had a super majority. If they had enough power to ram
[03:55:21.080 --> 03:55:25.560]  Obamacare down their throats, they had enough power to change the immigration laws. But yet
[03:55:25.560 --> 03:55:31.000]  they didn't. Why didn't they change the immigration laws? They didn't. Brandon, your heart is in the
[03:55:31.000 --> 03:55:37.640]  right place. Your facts are in the right place. I think that what you're doing is powerful. People
[03:55:37.640 --> 03:55:44.520]  can obviously find you at Breitbart.com slash Texas. But where else can they find you as we get off
[03:55:44.520 --> 03:55:51.400]  with you? I think the best way to find me is probably at Brandon Darby on Twitter.
[03:55:52.760 --> 03:55:58.040]  See what I have to say. I try to be as informative as possible. I try to be fair. I try to be
[03:56:01.160 --> 03:56:05.960]  very considerate and compassionate about what's occurring on the border to the migrants. I tend
[03:56:05.960 --> 03:56:09.880]  to blame, like I said, I tend to blame Congress more than I blame the people who come here. I don't
[03:56:09.880 --> 03:56:20.360]  blame them. I would too under the circumstances. Come on Twitter and let's interact and enjoy
[03:56:20.360 --> 03:56:24.680]  the information that my team puts together because we have a unique project, as you know,
[03:56:24.680 --> 03:56:30.200]  like Cartel Chronicles. It's Mexican journalists and citizen journalists. We publish it in
[03:56:30.200 --> 03:56:34.120]  English and Spanish. We do it under a pseudonym so they don't get killed because they would get
[03:56:34.120 --> 03:56:38.280]  killed for what they write. And they write about what these cartels are doing, who they are,
[03:56:38.280 --> 03:56:43.720]  who their business ties are. We constantly exposing them. And there's just not a dang thing
[03:56:43.720 --> 03:56:48.040]  that the cartels can do about it because they don't know who it is doing it. And it's a beautiful
[03:56:48.040 --> 03:56:53.080]  project. It's one of the most, I think it's the most giving and loving project for people in Northern
[03:56:53.080 --> 03:56:58.360]  Mexico that exists right now in the world. And it's bright part doing it, which I think the
[03:56:58.360 --> 03:57:02.360]  left can't comprehend. You know, it just blows their brain or they make some short circuit or
[03:57:02.360 --> 03:57:05.800]  something. Brandon, Brandon, brother, thank you for coming on InfoBoards. It was nice talking.
[03:57:05.800 --> 03:57:12.680]  Thank you, Ali. Yeah, of course. Y'all, this has been an exciting past hour. We talked about
[03:57:12.680 --> 03:57:18.200]  how to save the West. But Steve Franson, we talked about how to do that internally. With Brandon
[03:57:18.200 --> 03:57:23.480]  Darby, we talked about how to do that externally. I am forever grateful to InfoBoards for letting
[03:57:23.480 --> 03:57:28.920]  us talk to millions of people across lots of different platforms. It's very exciting to give
[03:57:28.920 --> 03:57:32.840]  this information. And there's no one whispering in my ear, Ali. You can't say this. You can't say
[03:57:32.840 --> 03:57:37.880]  this. Here's our agenda. And that's why it's important that we support and we purchase the
[03:57:37.880 --> 03:57:42.040]  bright part has a store. InfoBoards has a store. Thank you guys so much. This is Ali.

[03:57:49.000 --> 03:57:56.040]  Hey, I've been following you since I was 14. I'm 32 now. I remember back when InfoBoards and
[03:57:56.040 --> 03:58:01.640]  Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial
[03:58:01.640 --> 03:58:06.280]  up into that and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and
[03:58:06.280 --> 03:58:10.120]  followed all your guests. And I've been using your products since the first iteration of
[03:58:10.120 --> 03:58:16.200]  Survival Shield. And since then, I'm on the X2, the SuperMail Vitality Decay Man, the Real Red
[03:58:16.200 --> 03:58:21.880]  Peel, MycoZX body. It's all amazing. Thank you, brother. Yeah. And I wanted to say that by following
[03:58:21.880 --> 03:58:27.640]  you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing
[03:58:27.640 --> 03:58:33.080]  the spirit. And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[03:58:33.080 --> 03:58:37.880]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew and the listeners
[03:58:37.880 --> 03:58:48.360]  out there, 1776 worldwide. Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
