[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.360 --> 00:09.480]  Waging war on corruption
[00:11.320 --> 00:17.400]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:23.440 --> 00:25.440]  Every progressive show
[00:25.920 --> 00:27.920]  As we progress into the future
[00:27.920 --> 00:35.700]  Each passing broadcast is just getting more and more hardcore more and more jam-packed with absolutely off-the-charts
[00:36.240 --> 00:38.240]  news and information
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.680]  It is fortunate that you tuned in to this Sunday the sixth day of
[00:46.320 --> 00:47.520]  January
[00:47.520 --> 00:55.180]  2013 broadcast because it's going to be a very important transmission to say the least coming up in 30 minutes a police chief Mark
[00:55.180 --> 01:02.220]  Kessler is going to be joining us with state level nullification at the town council level
[01:03.060 --> 01:08.800]  In Pennsylvania, they are moving to get a law passed to mobilize their town
[01:09.420 --> 01:16.100]  against the globalist and violations of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and the Declaration of Independence gives them that power and
[01:17.020 --> 01:19.100]  He is coming on the show. We found out he's a
[01:19.660 --> 01:21.620]  Listener as well. That's good
[01:21.620 --> 01:25.580]  It's good to know that there's a fellow Liberty Lovers out there across the nation in the world
[01:25.580 --> 01:30.580]  And that's what my plan and Ron Paul's plan as well has been nullification
[01:31.260 --> 01:33.260]  at the county city state level
[01:34.780 --> 01:42.240]  Nullification short of secession, but if we have secession it's not from the United States. It's to have the states pull out of the federally
[01:43.180 --> 01:48.660]  Occupied New World Order system and to re-upload the Republic and people are hearing that message
[01:48.660 --> 01:53.940]  There's a bunch of states moving in that direction a lot of towns and counties and cities on different fronts and here's the deal
[01:55.180 --> 01:58.460]  If 800 plus cities and more than 30 states
[01:59.060 --> 02:04.660]  Do not arrest illegal aliens for having no insurance being drunk being here illegally
[02:04.660 --> 02:08.100]  They're above the law because the police can't arrest them for other crimes
[02:08.260 --> 02:11.220]  They don't arrest them basically for anything except aggravated assault
[02:11.220 --> 02:16.180]  And then they're not even deported once they get out of prison and you can obviously see that in the news everywhere
[02:16.180 --> 02:19.620]  That's an admitted fact. I'm not picking on the illegal aliens here
[02:19.620 --> 02:25.420]  It's that it's a fraud that they're above the law because the system wants an incentive to have them here to drive down wages
[02:25.900 --> 02:30.780]  Want to know why America is losing a standard of living. That's a big part of it prison labors displacing us
[02:32.740 --> 02:39.960]  Obviously dollar devaluation too high a taxes make it prohibitive for companies to manufacture and develop things
[02:40.500 --> 02:42.500]  in R&D here in this country
[02:42.500 --> 02:47.340]  But my issue is if 800 last time I was like eight hundred and eighty something
[02:47.340 --> 02:50.860]  It's almost nine hundred cities and towns every big city in the country
[02:51.860 --> 02:53.860]  almost every small
[02:54.180 --> 02:56.180]  city and many of the towns
[02:56.460 --> 02:59.940]  medium sized cities you name it are sanctuary cities and
[03:01.700 --> 03:03.260]  If
[03:03.260 --> 03:09.240]  The cities and counties are getting away and the states are getting away with ignoring
[03:09.240 --> 03:11.640]  constitutional federal law
[03:13.640 --> 03:15.640]  They're getting away with crime
[03:15.640 --> 03:18.760]  We can get away with something as constitutional
[03:19.400 --> 03:21.880]  You know the feds are like oh, no you can't have nullification
[03:22.400 --> 03:28.520]  Civil war decided that there's no such thing as the states or counties or cities baloney, and it's all about our will
[03:29.280 --> 03:34.220]  We control our local towns and cities we get people in there that say you know what?
[03:34.220 --> 03:40.260]  We're not gonna enforce unconstitutional gun laws we catch the money in the commission of a crime of the legal gun
[03:40.260 --> 03:42.260]  We'll throw the book at them, but we're not gonna pull over
[03:43.100 --> 03:46.500]  Farmers and find a shotgun in the vehicle and take them to jail it isn't happening
[03:47.460 --> 03:51.620]  Okay, it's real simple, so we're gonna be talking about that today
[03:51.620 --> 03:52.780]  That's not even the top story
[03:52.780 --> 03:57.920]  But it's very important because it ties in a lot of other ways we can resist this globalist takeover by realizing
[03:57.920 --> 03:59.920]  We do have power and we can say no
[03:59.920 --> 04:06.080]  there were federal law saying black people weren't human, but the Constitution and the Bill of Rights said they were and
[04:06.720 --> 04:12.240]  So it took a hundred years, but down the road or a little less than a hundred down the road
[04:13.480 --> 04:17.920]  Those rights were claimed those rights are there not given by the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[04:18.620 --> 04:24.760]  Pointed out by it. They're simply signposts like there's Mount Rainier in Washington State
[04:24.760 --> 04:32.920]  The sign doesn't make Mount Rainier it points at it the Constitution Bill of Rights points at what is already there now
[04:32.920 --> 04:37.280]  Here's the deal Washington Post talked to the White House. They're talking about executive orders
[04:37.280 --> 04:41.880]  And they're talking about extrajudicial activity to shut down the Second Amendment
[04:42.480 --> 04:47.600]  Right here where I live the city's moving to just outlaw gun shows period that's deep in the heart of Texas
[04:48.200 --> 04:52.240]  We've got a bunch of other really important news as well
[04:52.240 --> 04:58.000]  They're talking about repealing the 22nd amendment. So Obama can be president for life. Basically stay with us
[04:58.880 --> 05:06.280]  sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die start purifying your water with

[06:27.440 --> 06:33.680]  My friends we are live it is already Sunday the sixth day of January
[06:35.360 --> 06:43.000]  2013 and we're here every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas
[06:43.000 --> 06:51.240]  Austin broadcasting world wide not just coast-to-coast on over it's approaching 150 a.m. And FM affiliates
[06:52.320 --> 06:54.320]  XM global shortwave

[07:02.640 --> 07:07.720]  streaming video at info wars news calm and prison planet TV
[07:07.720 --> 07:14.360]  Okay, let me just mention what's coming up. It's the fullest plate. I've ever had on the Sunday broadcast and and next week
[07:14.360 --> 07:16.600]  Maybe even more full and more full
[07:16.600 --> 07:22.380]  I mean the amount of tyranny we're seeing in a week is more than I would see in a in in a year
[07:22.520 --> 07:25.080]  15 years ago 16 17 years ago on air
[07:25.840 --> 07:27.800]  just simply
[07:27.800 --> 07:29.800]  Amazing to see all of this happening
[07:30.840 --> 07:34.280]  Here is some of the news the 22nd
[07:34.280 --> 07:40.640]  Amendment HJ res 15 has been introduced to overturn that so Obama could run for a third term
[07:40.640 --> 07:46.760]  And I went and did a check a bunch of Democratic Party sites like daily costs and others are fantasizing about
[07:47.240 --> 07:52.260]  Obama for life kind of like Hugo Chavez who by the way they say if they unplug him
[07:53.280 --> 07:55.480]  He won't be coming back from Cuba
[07:56.440 --> 08:01.300]  So we're gonna be looking at that also Assad of Syria not a fan of the guy
[08:01.300 --> 08:04.780]  Definitely a dictator, but a soft dictator
[08:05.900 --> 08:07.900]  He gave a speech obviously
[08:08.540 --> 08:10.020]  today and
[08:10.020 --> 08:15.960]  Said look al-qaeda is being funded by the West to attack Syria. We will fight to the death and it's true
[08:15.960 --> 08:16.380]  I mean
[08:16.380 --> 08:23.260]  It's a New York Times you name it that our government is putting al-qaeda in there to attack a country where Jews Christians and all
[08:23.260 --> 08:25.060]  Muslim groups live in peace
[08:25.060 --> 08:30.480]  His father was somewhat of a brutal dictator in the Hazi Mubarak stripe, which they call light
[08:30.480 --> 08:34.840]  So he's a light light dictator, but al-qaeda is just unbelievable
[08:34.840 --> 08:41.680]  We posted a video up at info wars calm that I'll play later in the broadcast in the second hour of the main brigades
[08:43.080 --> 08:45.080]  on the suburbs of
[08:46.440 --> 08:52.920]  Damascus the capital of Syria chanting we blew up the towers. We're coming to kill you America after we're done here and
[08:54.600 --> 08:57.000]  It's it's even on Arab television stations
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.480]  It's just unbelievable that and by the way a year ago when they killed Gaddafi
[09:03.720 --> 09:08.340]  They had signs on BBC saying next stop Damascus. We're coming to Syria
[09:08.340 --> 09:14.360]  So our government NATO and others the French are leading it. Normally they're anti-war. They're just leading this thing
[09:14.800 --> 09:16.800]  The French are at the head of this
[09:17.480 --> 09:19.960]  Well, I've already talked about it a lot. I'm gonna talk about in the second hour
[09:20.400 --> 09:24.680]  It's just incredible that we were talking about it two years ago with Libya when that started
[09:24.680 --> 09:30.360]  Almost two years ago in Syria when it started and now it's like yeah. Okay, our government runs al-qaeda. Never mind that
[09:30.920 --> 09:35.400]  And people send me emails going. Well, at least we got Arabs killing Arabs. You know, this is crazy
[09:36.320 --> 09:38.320]  Assad hasn't attacked anybody
[09:39.040 --> 09:41.040]  Assad wears a suit and tie
[09:41.120 --> 09:47.520]  Women can walk down the street and go to college there and nobody's wearing burkas. That's all ending al-qaeda is chopping
[09:48.040 --> 09:52.520]  Christians heads off just type in just type in Syrian rebels chop Christians heads off
[09:52.520 --> 09:59.600]  Stabbing them making father's truck bomber. They kill their whole families and our media has actually run articles saying
[09:59.600 --> 10:01.280]  Oh, look at the rebels doing a great job
[10:01.280 --> 10:08.040]  And then there's a backlash in the New York Times pulled a video a few months ago showing this our media thinks we're so
[10:08.320 --> 10:14.240]  dumbed down they can show al-qaeda chopping a Christian's head off or throwing them off a church top or
[10:14.640 --> 10:19.360]  Making them a car bomb or they kill their family and our media is so evil
[10:19.920 --> 10:22.200]  They're like, oh look at the rebels. They're so wonderful
[10:22.200 --> 10:29.620]  I mean, this is so Twilight Zone. I can't even register it. Okay, and I expect corrupt stuff out of government. I
[10:30.320 --> 10:32.120]  Mean, I expect all sorts of this
[10:32.120 --> 10:37.200]  I don't even know what to say at this point because now it's admitted and it's a back-of-the-paper issue
[10:38.760 --> 10:42.200]  So that's coming up some of the second hour, okay
[10:42.200 --> 10:48.880]  Hold on to your hats here ladies and gentlemen, because I told you this was coming there is an incredible
[10:48.880 --> 10:53.080]  incredible Washington Post article posted up at info Awards calm
[10:53.080 --> 10:58.160]  It's also on the easiest place to find it drug report calm on the left-hand side at least 20 minutes ago
[10:58.560 --> 11:01.440]  Had it and here is the Washington Post
[11:02.120 --> 11:07.320]  article White House ways broad gun control agenda in wake of Newtown shootings and
[11:08.160 --> 11:11.160]  They say in here. We're just gonna have the ATF
[11:12.120 --> 11:18.600]  Go in and and extra judicially with rulemaking exactly what Larry Pratt of Gunners of America has warned about here in the last month
[11:18.600 --> 11:21.160]  We're just gonna go in and do it outside of law
[11:21.160 --> 11:23.760]  Maybe even executive orders and yeah
[11:23.760 --> 11:27.440]  We're just gonna ban gun shows and ban you giving your son or daughter a gun no more
[11:27.760 --> 11:31.800]  Giving family a gun or transferring a gun and we're just gonna put giant
[11:31.800 --> 11:37.560]  You know regulatory taxes outside of Congress on the bullets and it links to all the plans and it's a long
[11:37.920 --> 11:43.480]  Four-page article with links. I spent two hours on this sucker last night two hours
[11:43.480 --> 11:50.760]  I was up till about 1 a.m.. On this okay following what they're all saying. It's exactly what we knew it's all their old plans
[11:51.760 --> 11:53.760]  regurgitated vomited onto us at once
[11:54.400 --> 11:59.040]  And it is the repeal the Second Amendment that the Huffington Post the Atlantic wire
[11:59.920 --> 12:07.520]  The economist and then the Chinese government the Russian government all these governments even USA today said what's with all the foreign?
[12:07.800 --> 12:12.660]  Governments it's bad enough to have Piers Morgan over here lecturing us a redcoat by the way
[12:12.660 --> 12:15.600]  I'm on his show tomorrow night in person in New York. I thought it'd be fun
[12:15.960 --> 12:19.680]  But to make a long story short ladies and gentlemen Mike Adams is sitting in tomorrow
[12:19.680 --> 12:22.880]  He'll sure do a better job than I do. I'm a fan of that guy
[12:23.640 --> 12:28.000]  But continuing here. It is just off the chart insane. We'll be getting into that
[12:28.380 --> 12:33.680]  We have a video clip and I remember seeing him say this everywhere, and we even found the text of it
[12:33.680 --> 12:35.000]  I couldn't find the video
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.520]  CNS news found it and the videos up at info Wars calm right now
[12:39.520 --> 12:46.600]  And Obama says look I'm not coming after your handguns your rifles nothing anybody says it. They're a liar. He said that four years ago
[12:47.800 --> 12:53.700]  And I warned people I said now in this campaign because the fix is in I said he's saying he's coming after handguns and rifles
[12:54.280 --> 12:57.260]  They're coming after everything the Illinois bill that we barely beat
[12:59.240 --> 13:00.440]  Last week
[13:00.440 --> 13:05.840]  Openly made you turn in everything turn it in and everybody's registered there under the void card
[13:05.840 --> 13:10.040]  That's why you don't want to be registered isn't they always confiscate go through the quote background check
[13:10.040 --> 13:13.360]  They know you're a gun owner, but it's not registered when you waive your rights
[13:13.360 --> 13:17.520]  And they said that you know everything's turned in including pump shotguns
[13:18.600 --> 13:24.080]  Pump rifles people go their pump rifles. Yeah, a lot of pump rifles a lot of good ones out there actually the point is
[13:24.880 --> 13:29.920]  If you want something reliable, they're actually pretty good some of them the point is is that it banned everything
[13:29.920 --> 13:36.920]  Except sim except bolt-action way beyond just semi-auto, so it's all here. It's all happening
[13:36.920 --> 13:41.560]  We know what they want. We know what they're doing. We know what they're after and and by the way
[13:41.560 --> 13:44.720]  I'm gonna go over some statistics here on air when we come back
[13:45.520 --> 13:51.880]  From the Centers for Disease Control FBI and US federal government with links to it at info Wars calm
[13:52.320 --> 13:56.040]  America's biggest killers the chart anti-gunners don't want you to see and
[13:56.040 --> 13:59.800]  And by the way guns are at the end of the list
[14:01.420 --> 14:05.940]  With eleven thousand four hundred and ninety-three killed in fiscal year
[14:07.320 --> 14:09.320]  2011 you always get the numbers a year late and
[14:10.360 --> 14:11.600]  There you go
[14:11.600 --> 14:18.520]  But I'm gonna go over all those numbers here on air by the way an estimated seventy two percent of those were gang related
[14:18.800 --> 14:24.120]  gang members killing each other so take seventy plus percent out of eleven thousand five hundred roughly and
[14:24.120 --> 14:28.240]  We're now talking about three thousand five hundred or so
[14:29.400 --> 14:35.500]  Maybe four thousand real deaths from guns folks. There's three hundred and fifteen million people here
[14:36.320 --> 14:40.080]  Let me just give you one number, and this is a conservative number by the way
[14:40.720 --> 14:45.640]  Guess how many people die from tobacco use five hundred twenty nine thousand medical errors
[14:46.480 --> 14:51.240]  195,000 bad drug interactions goes on and on all right see I'm already starting to go to it
[14:51.240 --> 14:55.760]  We're gonna cover that after the break after we get into these audio clips of Obama's saying
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.120]  Listen listen when you go home and your friends tell you that I'm coming after their guns
[15:00.120 --> 15:03.980]  I'm not gonna take anything you got a Second Amendment. I believe in it
[15:03.980 --> 15:10.160]  We're leaving your guns alone, and the Democrats is very telling are yay cuz most Democrats are gun owners
[15:11.600 --> 15:14.360]  Almost everybody's a gun owner now every liberal
[15:14.360 --> 15:19.240]  I know in the last decade has figured out government can't won't protect you watching Katrina and Sandy
[15:19.240 --> 15:22.000]  And all these other events and and once you go out and shoot again
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.640]  You're like this is no big deal running a blender at your house. You have to hold it down is more dangerous
[15:28.480 --> 15:34.440]  Running a egg beater is you know it takes more force. I mean guns are a piece of cake and
[15:35.520 --> 15:37.520]  once you try one
[15:38.120 --> 15:40.480]  once you go to a gun you never go back I
[15:41.260 --> 15:46.480]  Mean it's that simple, and it's not that weird on power trips. We have guns. It's that we're in charge
[15:46.480 --> 15:49.600]  We feel empowered I sleep so good no

[20:12.780 --> 20:14.900]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation
[20:15.900 --> 20:20.500]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[20:21.900 --> 20:23.900]  to quote Thomas Jefferson
[20:23.900 --> 20:29.560]  The great thing about the Second Amendment is you will only need it when they try to take it away
[20:30.260 --> 20:33.820]  That is a Thomas Jefferson quote similar quotes by other founders
[20:33.820 --> 20:40.180]  You know my family fought for the Second Amendment to be created in the Revolutionary War and my family fought
[20:40.260 --> 20:42.520]  When Santa Anna tried to disarm the people?
[20:43.340 --> 20:50.020]  at Gonzales and then on into the other battles on both sides and my family were involved in the founding of Texas and
[20:50.660 --> 20:52.660]  I'm not turning my guns in
[20:52.660 --> 20:57.940]  Because it's a symbol and we know what it means while the government buys another
[20:59.460 --> 21:06.100]  200,000 hollow point bullets for the American people on top of the 1.6 billion. They already bought in the last 14 months
[21:06.780 --> 21:13.500]  We're gonna be going to that report here today government is arming against us and then telling us turn your guns in because we want
[21:13.500 --> 21:14.380]  To take good care of you
[21:14.380 --> 21:14.860]  No
[21:14.860 --> 21:18.260]  They want to be able to do to us whatever they want just like in Mexico
[21:18.260 --> 21:24.300]  Where they have taken all the guns from the citizens 50-something years ago, and they have the highest crime rate in the world
[21:25.340 --> 21:31.740]  For a nation the only city that's higher than one of their cities is Chicago where they have a gun ban
[21:32.220 --> 21:35.980]  Again where the criminals run free in government and on the streets
[21:39.580 --> 21:41.860]  Right now I want to go to a clip here
[21:42.300 --> 21:44.580]  And I hope you were listening earlier
[21:44.580 --> 21:51.260]  The Washington Post has come out and said that they've talked to the White House and that indeed they're going to use executive power
[21:51.980 --> 21:53.980]  outside of Congress
[21:54.300 --> 22:01.980]  To basically shut down gun shows tell shops not to sell semianos and and and just prosecute people
[22:02.380 --> 22:08.780]  Outside of law just have the ATF plan. They have a rule if you transfer guns and things. It's it's a laundry list four-page article
[22:08.780 --> 22:14.660]  White House ways broad gun control agenda in wake of Newtown shootings very chilling
[22:15.940 --> 22:17.940]  But I wanted to play the liar-in-chief
[22:18.620 --> 22:21.620]  Obama this is four and a half years ago
[22:22.820 --> 22:27.700]  CNF news found this I remember him saying this over and over again that I'm not coming after your second minute
[22:27.700 --> 22:29.460]  But we have a Biden saying the same thing
[22:29.460 --> 22:35.740]  But here's Obama saying I'm not coming after your handgun your rifle none of your guns and now that he's not facing a reelection
[22:35.740 --> 22:38.820]  He's like yeah, I'm gonna take everything here
[22:38.820 --> 22:43.440]  It is when y'all go home, and you're talking to your buddies, and they say he wants to take my gun away
[22:45.140 --> 22:48.100]  You've heard it here, I'm on television so everybody knows it I
[22:49.500 --> 22:51.500]  Believe in the Second Amendment I
[22:52.300 --> 23:00.780]  Believe in people's lawful right to bear arms. I will not take your shotgun away. I will not take your rifle away I
[23:00.780 --> 23:07.100]  Won't take your hand gun away, and I will not hire any lobbyists broke all records
[23:07.100 --> 23:09.660]  I will not sign executive orders to circumvent law
[23:10.060 --> 23:14.500]  More executive orders and all predators before him from George W. Bush back to George, Washington
[23:16.060 --> 23:18.900]  I will not have signing statements breaking all the records
[23:21.060 --> 23:27.300]  But he's got a peace prize so he can put al-qaeda in the countries to chop Christians heads off. I mean it is just amazing
[23:27.300 --> 23:29.300]  Amazing
[23:30.140 --> 23:35.140]  Let's go to Joe Biden during the same 2008 campaign saying the same
[23:35.460 --> 23:40.780]  Thing here is Joe Biden talking about his Beretta handgun after he talks about a shotgun
[23:40.780 --> 23:43.300]  Which is semi-auto which they would ban here it is I?
[23:44.860 --> 23:49.780]  Guarantee Barack Obama ain't taking my shotguns, so don't buy that malarkey
[23:50.260 --> 23:56.460]  Don't buy that Malarkey. They're gonna. They're gonna start peddling that to you. I got two of he tries to fool my Beretta
[23:56.460 --> 24:00.500]  He's got a problem. I like that a little over-and-under. You know. I'm not bad with it
[24:02.140 --> 24:06.500]  And he's talking about a very shotgun there the point is is that
[24:07.420 --> 24:09.700]  There is Biden saying they're not coming after your guns
[24:10.180 --> 24:17.140]  When he wrote the original assault weapons bill in 92 that they had to water down and we have Feinstein
[24:17.220 --> 24:18.620]  We'll play it later
[24:18.620 --> 24:24.100]  We played it last week and throughout the week saying mr.. Mrs.. America get ready to turn in your guns
[24:24.100 --> 24:25.500]  and
[24:25.500 --> 24:29.180]  his original bill banned all semi-autos period show
[24:30.020 --> 24:32.020]  decades later or 15 years later
[24:32.900 --> 24:36.900]  He's running around saying. Oh, I don't want your guns lying to people
[24:37.420 --> 24:43.740]  And look some folks say oh Alex as I saw in the comments on info wars calm and prison plan calm
[24:43.820 --> 24:47.460]  Okay, they all lie big deal see they just got you used to it now
[24:47.780 --> 24:52.700]  no, whenever George Herbert Walker Bush lied and said read my lips no new taxes and
[24:52.700 --> 25:00.460]  Then raise taxes. It was over and then of course. We just got something just as bad Bill Clinton William
[25:00.460 --> 25:06.780]  Jefferson Clinton who I used to think was the greatest liar I'd ever known Obama definitely is better and tells more whoppers
[25:06.900 --> 25:12.540]  But the issue is is that Obama has raised 14 taxes on the general public
[25:12.980 --> 25:15.980]  You can just type in its USA today. It's Bloomberg
[25:17.100 --> 25:19.100]  77% of Americans
[25:19.260 --> 25:21.260]  That's working Americans
[25:21.260 --> 25:25.620]  77 percent of the country everybody who works got a payroll tax increase
[25:26.300 --> 25:31.260]  If you make thirty six thousand dollars a year on average. It's about two hundred dollars a month
[25:33.780 --> 25:35.700]  $200 a month and and
[25:35.700 --> 25:40.340]  that's just one tax we're talking about so and
[25:40.860 --> 25:42.300]  Then there's another 13
[25:42.300 --> 25:48.140]  Taxes on top of it and fines and fees and all the rest of it and then all those other taxes on people making over
[25:48.140 --> 25:54.180]  125 thousand dollars a year individually quarter million collectively that all gets passed on to you when you get laid off or
[25:54.860 --> 25:57.260]  Middle class folks don't come in by goods now there
[25:57.260 --> 26:04.700]  It is fiscal cliff deal raise taxes on seventy seven percent of Americans tax policy center and analysis and now that's official
[26:04.780 --> 26:10.820]  Okay, let's go ahead. That's now law. Let's go ahead and go to the clip of Obama saying. I won't raise your
[26:10.820 --> 26:17.420]  Raise your any of your taxes not your payroll tax not your on on raising them all
[26:17.820 --> 26:20.020]  Raising everything he said he wouldn't raise
[26:21.140 --> 26:27.620]  In fact they've had Howard Dean come out and say if you make ten thousand dollars a year. You should pay taxes extra taxes
[26:28.140 --> 26:32.100]  About two weeks ago. He's looking up Howard Dean says poor should pay more
[26:32.100 --> 26:38.220]  Oh, yeah, because you want to get the economy going no you know that high taxes shut down economies
[26:38.220 --> 26:44.340]  You know Kennedy cut the highest tax bracket by 50% the next tax bracket by 30 plus percent and tax receipts
[26:44.340 --> 26:46.340]  Did what by the next year?
[26:46.460 --> 26:52.220]  Did they go up 20% did they go up 30% 50 60 70 80 90 they went up over?
[26:53.420 --> 26:54.380]  100%
[26:54.380 --> 27:00.020]  More than double the tax receipts you'd think bureaucrats would want money. No they don't want money
[27:00.300 --> 27:04.460]  They want to bankrupt your butt and get you on welfare. We've gone
[27:04.460 --> 27:08.500]  from less than 2% of the country on food stamps in the 30s to
[27:08.980 --> 27:13.740]  Now 50 million people it's doubled the last four years from 25 million
[27:13.740 --> 27:19.900]  And they're set to double it again the name of the game is takeover. They don't want you uppity having any money
[27:20.780 --> 27:28.280]  Let's go to this clip of Obama saying he wouldn't raise any of your taxes any of your payroll taxes here it is
[27:28.280 --> 27:33.740]  And I can make a firm pledge a pledge under my plan no family
[27:34.560 --> 27:36.560]  making less than
[27:37.320 --> 27:44.120]  $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase not your income tax not your payroll tax
[27:44.280 --> 27:48.160]  Not your capital gains taxes not any of your taxes
[27:49.160 --> 27:52.880]  by the way they have in the in the now law a
[27:53.680 --> 27:55.680]  surcharge of what is it three point nine
[27:55.680 --> 28:01.560]  Percent on all your 401k investments you've already paid taxes on this over and over again now
[28:01.560 --> 28:06.800]  it's an investment for your retirement or for college whatever for your children, and they're going to tax that and
[28:08.240 --> 28:11.280]  just I don't know how bad this has got to get here and
[28:12.240 --> 28:16.840]  And and used to people get mad about this, but and a lot of folks are angry
[28:16.840 --> 28:19.880]  I mean Congress does have a 9% approval rating
[28:19.880 --> 28:24.560]  But I got to tell you the 35 40 percent of people in this country that really are Obama supporters
[28:24.560 --> 28:28.760]  Is about half the people in the country voted and a little more than half voted for Obama?
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.360]  The 25 30 percent 35 depending on how you look at it because he's got 30 million legal aliens supporting
[28:34.360 --> 28:36.360]  So that's about 35 percent total
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.680]  Are you people are just idiots?
[28:38.680 --> 28:44.280]  I mean you're chumps this guy's a collectivist that wants to bankrupt everything and put America through emergency

[33:49.040 --> 33:51.040]  Early in the morning. I'm gonna get on an airplane
[33:51.040 --> 33:56.000]  Early in the morning, and I'm gonna fly up to New York to be in studio with Piers Morgan
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  And they've got a bunch of surprises lined up for me
[33:59.880 --> 34:02.720]  Alan Dershowitz and a bunch of others to sit there and
[34:03.240 --> 34:05.000]  in Peck at me
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.600]  But they would do it via satellite and and we were gonna do it be a satellite
[34:08.600 --> 34:11.520]  And but I thought you know what I want to look that guy in the eyes
[34:12.520 --> 34:17.160]  And so we'll see if they chicken out boy. They they swore to me. They won't
[34:17.160 --> 34:22.240]  I've had CNN check it out before via satellite interviews, and I'll get really really upset if they do, but
[34:22.760 --> 34:26.400]  That political rumble in the jungle is set for tomorrow night
[34:26.960 --> 34:32.440]  9 o'clock central 8 o'clock Eastern in studio at the CNN command center that I've been in multiple times
[34:32.960 --> 34:34.960]  So that should be interesting
[34:35.960 --> 34:43.000]  Speaking of that let me just go ahead and play a clip again of Dianne Feinstein who's bill obama says he's gonna put his quote full
[34:43.000 --> 34:44.140]  weight my
[34:44.140 --> 34:49.760]  That's a quote to her last bill. She didn't have the votes for now. She has them
[34:49.760 --> 34:54.720]  She says to make you mr.. And mrs. America turn your guns in here's that clip
[34:55.600 --> 35:01.920]  California senator Dianne Feinstein worked for more than a year to get the assault weapons bill passed in the face of ferocious
[35:02.280 --> 35:04.280]  opposition from the National Rifle Association
[35:04.760 --> 35:08.640]  She says she got the best she could if I could have gotten
[35:09.520 --> 35:13.040]  51 votes in the second round of the national rifle association
[35:13.040 --> 35:16.240]  votes in the Senate of the United States for an
[35:16.800 --> 35:22.920]  Outright ban picking up every one of them mr. And mrs. America turn them all in
[35:22.920 --> 35:28.680]  I would have done it. I could not do that the votes weren't here
[35:29.680 --> 35:34.240]  But that was over a decade ago now her bill says that
[35:35.120 --> 35:39.740]  Because well a decade ago the American people wouldn't put up with the UN and NATO commanding our military
[35:39.740 --> 35:47.260]  They wouldn't put up with the NSA spying on the American people without warrants and admitting. It's going after conservative libertarian and
[35:48.740 --> 35:52.620]  Constitutional groups see the whole homeland system is now for us. They admit it I
[35:53.900 --> 35:58.060]  Want to play another clip and then for the rest of this segment the next we're gonna go to our guest a police chief
[35:58.060 --> 36:05.540]  I want to first play this clip from last year, Lubbock County, Texas with judge head. He's the county judge. That's like the county mayor
[36:05.540 --> 36:10.620]  Talking about Obama's gonna come for the guns that judge had actually read Obama's quotes
[36:10.620 --> 36:14.920]  And the UN quotes see they've all said over and over again. They want a total abolition of guns
[36:15.820 --> 36:21.660]  That's in the preamble to the original UN treaty, but see when we're informed when judge head is informed
[36:21.940 --> 36:26.420]  Or police chief Mark Kessler's informed or Ron Paul's informed
[36:27.180 --> 36:32.860]  The con artist in corporate mainstream collaborator media they just go to the public. Oh, that's a kook
[36:32.860 --> 36:38.340]  That's a conspiracy theorist don't don't listen to them. They don't know what they're talking about just listen to us
[36:38.340 --> 36:40.340]  But see that doesn't work anymore
[36:40.700 --> 36:46.420]  That's why they're so desperate to bankrupt America now and get our guns now because they know America's waking up
[36:46.420 --> 36:51.820]  That's why they're trying to get in as many illegal aliens as they can get as much people on welfare as they can they paid
[36:52.380 --> 36:56.940]  $22,000,000 to ship General Motors to China look it up barely made the news, but it's in the news
[36:57.740 --> 36:59.740]  vault and Cadillac factories
[36:59.740 --> 37:02.420]  I believe Cadillacs made in China most of them
[37:03.780 --> 37:06.740]  Anything they can it's one thing if you move to China
[37:07.740 --> 37:10.540]  It's another thing of my money paid to move it there
[37:11.100 --> 37:16.060]  They're not liberals aren't screwing up. They're not liberals. They're authoritarians
[37:16.140 --> 37:21.460]  they are engaged in economic siege, but here's judge head on local Fox News and
[37:21.980 --> 37:26.580]  Now other police other county judges mayors are saying the same thing
[37:26.580 --> 37:30.900]  If 800 cities and 30-plus states can nullify for illegal aliens
[37:31.500 --> 37:35.580]  When that is a violation of federal and state law and just let them do whatever they want well
[37:35.580 --> 37:38.740]  We can nullify illegal federal laws when they are unconstitutional
[37:38.980 --> 37:44.660]  And say our local police under the mayor and under the county or whatever the sheriff. We're not taking people's guns
[37:46.140 --> 37:53.300]  Okay, but this this this this police chief goes further. They make provisions to defend the Second Amendment. You've got to call these tyrants bluff
[37:53.300 --> 37:59.620]  Ten years ago Feinstein said oh, I got to get votes to take your guns. We got to get an amendment lady
[38:00.740 --> 38:07.300]  Constitutional amendment now a decade later. She's like. Oh, we'll just do it with an executive order. That's in the Washington Post
[38:07.820 --> 38:11.860]  They're seeing what the public does there. They're seeing others a backlash right now
[38:11.860 --> 38:16.220]  We're gonna go to our guests, but first here is judge head of Lubbock County, Texas
[38:17.020 --> 38:22.300]  During the election warning of this eventuality coming to a head no pun intended here
[38:22.300 --> 38:26.260]  It is he is gonna try to hand over the sovereignty of the United States to the UN
[38:27.180 --> 38:33.020]  Okay, what's gonna happen when that happens? I'm thinking worst-case scenario right right understand civil unrest civil disobedience
[38:33.940 --> 38:39.340]  Civil war maybe and we're not talking just a few riots here and demonstrations
[38:39.340 --> 38:44.280]  We're talking we're talking Lexington Concord take up arms and get rid of the guy
[38:45.020 --> 38:50.140]  Okay, now. What's gonna happen if we do that if the public decides to do that he's gonna send in
[38:50.140 --> 38:53.200]  You in troops. I don't want them in Lubbock County
[38:53.900 --> 38:58.580]  Okay, so I'm gonna stand in front of their person armored personnel carriers and say you're not coming in here
[38:58.580 --> 39:03.220]  Mm-hmm and the sheriff I've already asked him. I said you're gonna back me said yeah, I'll back you well
[39:03.220 --> 39:05.300]  I don't want a bunch of rookies back there all right
[39:05.300 --> 39:06.700]  I want that's right
[39:06.700 --> 39:12.500]  He goes on to say they had to create another unit just to deal with the feds and if every county did that it'd be
[39:12.500 --> 39:18.180]  Over and people said well, that's that's crazy the feds are God the feds have been taken over by firing mega banks on record
[39:18.180 --> 39:21.540]  Okay, I'm done ranting our guest is with us this segment and the next
[39:21.940 --> 39:27.140]  And he joins us, but imagine ten years ago hearing that it would have been crazy four months ago
[39:27.140 --> 39:28.940]  It sounded a little strange to people now
[39:28.940 --> 39:34.380]  It's like oh yeah, she know that guy was just more informed than even the general conservative out there, okay?
[39:34.380 --> 39:36.380]  This is what's going to happen
[39:36.620 --> 39:41.140]  Okay, they plan on raising taxes now Obama's already calling for more tax increases
[39:42.100 --> 39:45.960]  Same thing in 1775 eating out our substance
[39:45.960 --> 39:53.280]  It's reducing us to ruin that was the plan so the British nobility could buy up all the businesses and
[39:53.360 --> 39:55.360]  land for pennies on the dollar
[39:56.200 --> 40:00.560]  Was Oliver Wendell Holmes the Supreme Court justice that said the famous justice that said
[40:01.480 --> 40:06.480]  Taxes are the price of civilization, and that's true to have somewhat of a civilization a small limited government
[40:06.480 --> 40:12.440]  But what about when the government becomes evil and destructive of those aims which happens all throughout history and and uses
[40:12.440 --> 40:18.080]  Civilization to destroy us and reduce us to slavery all right. We take you now to police
[40:18.800 --> 40:22.640]  Chief Mark Kessler in a Pennsylvania a town of Gilberton
[40:22.840 --> 40:26.920]  That's like Mayberry RFK and the citizens are backing in Pennsylvania police
[40:26.920 --> 40:32.800]  She proposes Second Amendment preservation ordinance demand a real plan nullifying constitutional gun laws
[40:32.800 --> 40:39.760]  And he joins us to talk about enact any and all measures as may be necessary to prevent the violation of the Second Amendment
[40:39.800 --> 40:41.120]  That's right
[40:41.120 --> 40:47.000]  That's right. Not just say we're not going to enforce unconstitutional laws and act whatever it takes any means necessary
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.920]  I want to salute you serve for your stand for the Republic, and it's good to have you here with us
[40:52.000 --> 40:58.600]  Tell us why this came to mind and where this is going. Well. Thank you very much Alex for having me on your show
[41:00.320 --> 41:07.400]  This came to mind after after yes, and evil shooting and the outcry for everybody to
[41:08.280 --> 41:10.280]  bad weapons
[41:10.280 --> 41:12.000]  Hopefully
[41:12.000 --> 41:18.320]  after three or four weeks of research I came up with the idea for the nullification process and
[41:19.560 --> 41:21.560]  after several drafts I
[41:21.760 --> 41:23.280]  planned on
[41:23.280 --> 41:28.120]  Introducing to the borough council on our next meeting on January 24th
[41:28.720 --> 41:30.720]  Which I hope they do
[41:31.240 --> 41:33.240]  pass
[41:35.480 --> 41:38.400]  Well I hope it I hope it does pass
[41:38.400 --> 41:44.700]  Why did you I mean did the clock get so close to midnight? Is that why you come up with this plan?
[41:49.740 --> 41:54.660]  Around the country in particularly in Washington that everybody screaming to
[41:55.940 --> 42:00.420]  Weapons and they realize that it's not it's not the weapon
[42:00.940 --> 42:04.300]  That's causing the problem. It's the person behind the weapon
[42:04.300 --> 42:10.380]  That's causing the problem and until they figure that out. They're never going to solve the problem. It's not the
[42:11.740 --> 42:17.540]  Law-abiding citizens that are going out and committing these heinous crimes. They're so evil and
[42:18.340 --> 42:20.940]  Unspeakable it's the mentally ill
[42:21.620 --> 42:26.620]  Unfortunately they're doing a lot of these crimes and criminals. It's not the law-abiding citizens.
[42:27.140 --> 42:31.020]  Well, that's right. I mean every day in this country unfortunately every day
[42:31.020 --> 42:36.620]  I've looked it up or on average every day a mentally ill person takes a butcher knife and stabs their family with it
[42:36.980 --> 42:41.260]  Do I have to lose my butcher knife because they do that and we're gonna be right back with the police chief
[42:41.380 --> 42:43.380]  Pennsylvania police chief proposed a Second Amendment
[42:43.860 --> 42:49.820]  Preservation ordinance we appreciate his courage and his forethought, and this is something that can really pick up steam everywhere
[42:49.820 --> 42:53.340]  I mean if they let the illegal aliens run free and that's unconstitutional
[42:53.500 --> 42:57.740]  How about police and counties and cities just pass law saying we nullify
[42:58.540 --> 43:00.420]  unconstitutional garbage

[48:23.100 --> 48:28.020]  34,000 deaths show you've got tobacco 500 plus thousand medical errors
[48:28.620 --> 48:30.620]  195,000 unconventional injuries
[48:31.140 --> 48:32.900]  118,000 alcohol abuse
[48:32.900 --> 48:38.140]  107,000 motor vehicle accidents 34,000 gonna ban cars because they're dangerous well. Don't worry
[48:38.140 --> 48:41.420]  They want to make you drive robot cars now. That's the whole Google plan so look out
[48:41.420 --> 48:43.420]  on intentional poisoning
[48:44.100 --> 48:49.500]  31,000 758 now gotta ban everything poisonous well everything's poisonous, but you can drink too much
[48:50.140 --> 48:53.860]  Scope mouthwash and die I'm gonna ban that drug abuse
[48:54.500 --> 48:56.500]  25,000
[48:56.520 --> 48:58.820]  Unintentional Falls so that was separate from that
[49:00.140 --> 49:01.220]  24,792
[49:01.220 --> 49:06.580]  non firearm homicides baseball bats ice picks butcher knives rocks
[49:06.580 --> 49:11.100]  16,799 firearms homicides
[49:12.820 --> 49:19.860]  11,493 in 2011 these numbers always come out a year late, so these just came out a few weeks ago three weeks ago the point is
[49:20.820 --> 49:23.820]  That you've got a much better chance of falling in the shower
[49:24.420 --> 49:28.580]  Then you and dying than from a firearm and over 70% of those
[49:28.860 --> 49:34.860]  11,000 go look at the fbi.gov and violent crime statistics our gang bangers killing each other
[49:34.860 --> 49:41.020]  Now four thousand still a big number, but but it's nothing compared to everything else. This is a hoax
[49:41.020 --> 49:43.020]  I want to go back to the police chief sir
[49:43.020 --> 49:45.260]  You've got the floor here for the balance of the segment
[49:45.300 --> 49:48.820]  Where would you like to see this go the common sense what you see in your town?
[49:48.940 --> 49:51.380]  How do we get your counsel to get this law passed?
[49:52.100 --> 49:55.260]  How do people read a copy of it so other towns can introduce it?
[49:55.260 --> 50:00.780]  I mean this is what we need to do because you've got all these other cities ignoring things that are the law
[50:00.780 --> 50:05.340]  Well, how about we have cities ignore things that are unconstitutional? Well?
[50:07.420 --> 50:10.300]  receiving phone calls from all across the country from Alaska to California
[50:11.180 --> 50:18.540]  Asking for copies of the alleged proposal. I'm going to introduce the council on 24th of January
[50:19.140 --> 50:21.140]  From mayors in Chester County, Pennsylvania
[50:21.860 --> 50:23.860]  to mayors in Bucks County, Pennsylvania
[50:24.060 --> 50:26.060]  that one copies
[50:26.060 --> 50:31.420]  of different sheriff's departments all around the country that are asking me for copies they have called and
[50:31.820 --> 50:37.420]  Gave me great support throughout this whole thing, and I would like to see it spread throughout the entire
[50:38.020 --> 50:40.020]  continental United States yes
[50:40.260 --> 50:47.020]  By up by every means necessary and spread the word to everybody and we're not going to stand idle. We can't stand
[50:47.940 --> 50:49.060]  and
[50:49.060 --> 50:51.340]  Just let these bureaucrats in Washington
[50:52.180 --> 50:54.180]  Ram down
[50:54.180 --> 50:56.180]  anti constitutional law
[50:56.460 --> 51:03.620]  To the American people it's just not right and I will not my department will not enforce any unconstitutional laws against the Second Amendment
[51:03.620 --> 51:08.380]  Or the Constitution of the United States as far as I'm concerned for the Constitution of Pennsylvania
[51:08.380 --> 51:13.900]  Well, I know you're sticking your neck out because you love the Republican your family and our future and obviously
[51:13.900 --> 51:15.900]  I don't put words in your mouth, but
[51:16.140 --> 51:19.860]  Guns are the canary in the coal mine. I'd like you to elaborate on that chief
[51:19.860 --> 51:27.700]  But looking at this it's an example of leadership you do this, and you haven't even put it out publicly yet
[51:28.500 --> 51:30.340]  Obviously you will see on the city website
[51:30.340 --> 51:34.820]  And you're already have people all over the country wanting to emulate what you've done
[51:34.820 --> 51:41.600]  And and that's the essence of this we have to simply stand up as leaders and do what's right and others will join us
[51:42.460 --> 51:45.740]  but if we just stand here and let the tyranny take over as
[51:46.340 --> 51:48.940]  Churchill said there may come a time when
[51:48.940 --> 51:52.860]  We have to stand up and fight because it's better to down our feet than as slaves
[51:53.540 --> 51:58.320]  Instead of fighting politically early on when our chance for victory was assured
[51:59.140 --> 52:03.580]  Exactly exactly and God forbid the last thing we want is any kind of violence
[52:04.420 --> 52:07.500]  hopefully, you know this will be a
[52:09.220 --> 52:11.700]  Kind of a gateway for other other
[52:11.700 --> 52:19.580]  other people that believe in the Constitution and other law enforcement officials and just the average citizen that could take it make a
[52:19.580 --> 52:20.660]  Copy of it
[52:20.660 --> 52:26.860]  Call me get in touch with me make a copy of it take it to their local law enforcement agencies their local sheriff their local
[52:27.500 --> 52:29.500]  politicians and
[52:29.580 --> 52:35.780]  Have them do the same thing that I'm trying to do and I mean I've been contacted by the old keepers
[52:37.020 --> 52:39.940]  They're there in support of me the Pennsylvania United PA
[52:39.940 --> 52:45.300]  9 9 12 guys, they're a million members strong throughout the country
[52:46.060 --> 52:49.620]  They they're backing me. There's just a whole bunch of people
[52:50.420 --> 52:56.660]  Yeah, folks are just looking for men of honor to stand up and you're doing that and this is what can turn the tide
[52:56.660 --> 52:59.820]  This is what the anti-gunners are so scared of they know
[53:00.860 --> 53:05.740]  Actual innocence being killed by guns is incredibly rare. They have the statistics. I've been around them
[53:05.740 --> 53:12.300]  These are cold-blooded tyrants, you know, all the pro-gunners are always so polite and go what's wrong with these people?
[53:12.300 --> 53:16.620]  Look at the statistics. They're not dumb. Most of them are tyrants
[53:16.620 --> 53:20.460]  Sure, you've got people at the grassroots that never grew up around guns that are scared of them
[53:20.500 --> 53:25.780]  But the general establishment people that want our guns they want them to oppress us and look
[53:25.780 --> 53:27.900]  I've told the police this and the police aren't stupid
[53:27.900 --> 53:34.020]  They know this there's a lot of people aren't turning them in and if a Feinstein gun man goes through and they try to go around
[53:34.020 --> 53:39.340]  Harassing gun owners. It is not going to go. Well and what judge had talked about is going to end up happening
[53:39.340 --> 53:43.300]  I want to avert that and I agree with you. I think we can
[53:43.980 --> 53:46.460]  Fix this just by political action. I
[53:47.340 --> 53:49.340]  Hope so. I hope so out
[53:49.820 --> 53:52.740]  The last thing like I said, we want if any kind of violent
[53:53.620 --> 53:55.060]  erupting throughout the country
[53:55.060 --> 53:59.220]  I know hopefully this sends a clear message to Washington and to the
[53:59.220 --> 54:04.140]  The media that we're not going to stand idly by and let them confiscate
[54:05.180 --> 54:10.260]  The Second Amendment or the goal or tamper with the Constitution itself. That's that
[54:11.220 --> 54:13.060]  We got a band together
[54:13.060 --> 54:14.420]  Wow

[54:27.860 --> 54:33.260]  You know nice of you to give your number out for mayors and sheriffs or others that may want to get a copy
[54:33.700 --> 54:36.340]  of it and if you'd like to send us the
[54:37.020 --> 54:43.500]  The proposed town ordinance or law we would love to post it at info wars comm so you don't get hammered

[55:21.500 --> 55:26.540]  We that is the last thing we want whoever shoots first loses
[55:26.580 --> 55:32.260]  We want to stand up politically and use that force to defend our freedoms
[55:32.420 --> 55:37.980]  Not shoot our mouths off, and I've told people this if you won't politically get involved to defend your freedom
[55:37.980 --> 55:41.780]  It's talk you will never physically defend when the time comes

[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:35.240]  But we had some amazing founders and I saw a clip of Michael Moore saying how dare the founders
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.620]  You know people think that's all set in stone. They fought the greatest empire in the world
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:45.980]  They trail based liberty that became the model of the planet and I look at the ordinance that you can get an info wars

[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:02.140]  And there's a line in here
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:08.820]  It talks about an act ending in all measures as may be necessary people say oh they'll come get us like they're God or something
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:15.860]  I'm not Olympus if you simply say no they lose the moral authority and then the gun confiscation never happens if you cower

[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:39.440]  I'd like to say I hope everybody gets behind this and my mayor mayor mayor Mary Lou Hannon
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:42.840]  She's pro Second Amendment. She's standing behind me on this
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.280]  She can also push the council into adopting this
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:53.340]  and I just really hope the passes and we all got a band together and stand up and fight the
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.860]  the
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:56.860]  Treasonous in the in the
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:00.140]  Washington and the elite
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:05.940]  It's just everything that's going on right now in the country. I'm really worried about where we're headed in the next four years
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.180]  it could be very disastrous and
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:12.700]  They want to take they're going to start taking our weapons away from us
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:18.980]  It's just a very it's the start of a very bad situation within the United States

[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:31.180]  These all band together and say enough is enough. We had enough. We're not going to take it no more
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:35.120]  We're not going to sit idly by and not and let the government ram
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:38.900]  anti-constitutional ball down the throats of the American system
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:40.180]  That's right
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:45.300]  If we just act like it's some mothership that gives us all the orders it's going to do whatever at once and
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:49.700]  Foreign interests are going to come in and buy it off. We have to

[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:56.580]  Statesman during the Civil War to paraphrase
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.340]  him he said that
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:03.820]  the liberty and freedom is not given it is taken it is demanded and
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:11.140]  We need the special interest of liberty and the American people and private property and low taxes and freedom
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.660]  And and and so we've got to get aggressive
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:19.340]  We've been taken over because we became passive and it's just common sense we either get involved
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:25.740]  Or we lose everything exactly exactly and we can't do that. We can't I will not sit idly by
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:31.900]  And let this unconstitutional act that they're trying to get the Congress is trying to pass right now
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:34.340]  Not the whole Congress. These are some good congressman
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:40.460]  There's good good good senators in the United States, but just certain ones that have this ideological
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:45.540]  Anti-american agenda that does not sit well with me. That's right
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:51.220]  It won't be what and they guilt us into oh, I mean you've heard it. You're a clan member of your own guns
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:57.100]  You know you're an accessory to murder the NRA or lobbyists for these 20 dead kids
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:01.740]  It's the government the federal government that made those gun-free zones and the media that
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:05.700]  Advertised it as the places for Prozac heads to go kill people
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:10.820]  I mean if they want to put blame out there there are light years more to blame than anybody else
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:15.460]  Exactly, they should look in the mirror. They really they really need to a reality check
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.460]  We need to get these people out of office
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:22.420]  I don't think that they they're committing acts of treason on a daily basis
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:26.780]  And it just boggles the boggles my mind as they as an individual
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:34.300]  And as a police chief that these people are in the position of power that they're in what about your other officers
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.780]  Are they fired up about this?
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:41.740]  Yeah, everybody Michael communities pretty much fired up about this that the local communities around me are fired up about it
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:43.660]  I've received calls in different
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:46.940]  Area chiefs of police that can be congratulate me
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:52.140]  Others are good because this is how brush fires in the minds of men start according to Jefferson well
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:55.620]  I want to salute police chief Mark Kessler in Gilberton, Pennsylvania
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:58.380]  When is your town gonna stand up?

[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:17.620]  Well, so does he?
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:19.620]  live from Austin, Texas
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:23.940]  Broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:36.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was just talking to police chief of a town up in Pennsylvania mark Kessler if you joined us
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:39.740]  He was telling me off-air as he left us that
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:43.380]  And he also said some on-air that little short segment
[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:49.280]  That police chiefs all over the country are calling him and congratulating him for getting a piece of
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.420]  Statutory law
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:57.420]  that can that complies with the Second Amendment of Pennsylvania and the federal Second Amendment to
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:03.160]  Simply say we're not gonna harass gun owners. We're not going to confiscate guns. This is unconstitutional order
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:06.100]  and by the way
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:09.600]  Diane Feinstein and it's in the Washington Post yesterday
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:14.720]  They're saying they may use executive orders or ATF rulemaking and I've been warning you about that
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:20.000]  But now it's official to just shut down gun shows you name it and I am really ashamed of something
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:25.940]  That I have and my listeners to a great extent here in Austin have allowed
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:30.160]  Because we're all guilty of not standing up to these people
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:35.920]  Have allowed the Austin City Council and the county commissioners
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.400]  Who are in a story in the Austin American Statesman?
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.940]  To come out and say that they are set to ban
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:49.460]  Gun shows not just from county and city property the big convention centers
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:57.360]  They're saying they're set next week to vote the Austin American Statesman reports on a city law and a county law
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:03.320]  They're working together to ban gun shows period what's next like San Francisco ban gun shops
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.920]  This is deep in the heart of Texas
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.720]  Travis County
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:15.120]  Do I have to name drop here that it was David Ayers my ancestor that raised Colonel Travis's son. I
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:22.000]  Mean, I've got I've got relatives with counties named after him in Texas and I am ashamed
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:26.800]  That that Travis County that bears the name of William Barrett
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:33.900]  Travis is set to ban gun shows and they're talking about gun shops. You know, I said that's next they're there
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:39.640]  They're starting to talk about that. Here. It is Austin American Statesman city county to consider restricting gun shows
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:46.720]  And potentially even curtail them on private property within the city limits. The Austin American Statesman has learned and
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.420]  It goes on Mike Martinez
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:55.200]  Mike Martinez, man, you know Mike can't you just be an American?
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.560]  Mm-hmm
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:02.500]  Mexico has taken all their people's guns. They have the highest murder rate. It's almost 60,000 dead in just last five years
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:10.920]  Women men children our own Justice Department shipped guns into Mexico to blame our Second Amendment and got caught
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:18.240]  Cuz good be ATF agents blew the whistle and you sit here and call yourself an American. I call you a shameful
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.120]  Enemy of the Republic and a piece of garbage
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.120]  You
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.240]  Physically want to shut down gun shows
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.340]  Just you people there's no end to you
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:36.640]  You know, they were trying to shut down gun shows a few years ago. They were sending an ATF try to set folks up
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.780]  yeah, I called for a protest of it and then they had a
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:45.000]  Local group protest and I showed up at it. They even had provocateurs at it to
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.680]  Try to go after me
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:51.400]  I mean listen, they want to use Austin as a case to break open all of Austin
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:56.760]  Texas into the rest of the country and go after our guns. It is it is just absolutely
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.360]  amazing
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.280]  To see this type of stuff going on and if you haven't read the Washington Post article
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:08.320]  You really should but can we get that flashback cute back up Obama?
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:13.280]  I will not take any guns even though it's a state senator. You can find public letters
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:20.320]  He wrote as question and answer periods for the Chicago Tribune saying I believe all guns semi-auto
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.520]  rifles handguns bolt-action single-shot
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.560]  Everything must be banned and I got Dianne Feinstein saying that too
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.240]  I've got Joe Biden
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:37.240]  when he introduced the first assault weapons ban calling for an abolition of gun ownership in this country for
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:42.280]  almost all guns to be turned in the Illinois Statehouse has bills introduced right now and
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:47.440]  They've got until what Tuesday to get it done. I warned you last week. They could play possum
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:53.800]  They claim they didn't have the votes word is we've got some calls on this from some good sources. They may try to ram it through
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.080]  Physically making you turn your guns in
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:04.080]  Like they've already done in Chicago making it the murder capital of the world at least Mexico doesn't have that crown that trophy that belt
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.240]  They're just murder capital country-wise
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.840]  as they took all the guns and
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.920]  you know, I think all Americans whether your name's John Brown or
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.680]  Whatever it is, you ought to move down to Mexico, of course
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.000]  They won't let people move down there. If you're an illegal alien down there. They put you in a forced labor camp, but
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.360]  Wow
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.800]  Very very dangerous time and see the globalists don't care whether they're unpopular or not
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.980]  They think homeland security works for them and they're dropping the hammer on us
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:39.140]  Was it Noel in Illinois that you said had some news on the
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.860]  Bruce in Illinois
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:47.740]  Bruce in Illinois, then we'll go to Noel in Illinois and others Bruce. What is your Intel?
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:53.500]  It was callers last Tuesday started warning us about the gun grab in emails and Wednesday
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.700]  We covered it and sure enough
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:12:00.940]  We wrote an article Wednesday that made national news and Thursday the bill to confiscate most firearms including
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:05.860]  Pumped shotguns was introduced and then we thought we shot it down Friday
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:12.380]  Are you saying other meeting right now and other in session right now to try to get your guns? Yes, sir
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.380]  Alex on Friday a
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:19.140]  the gun ban amendments were introduced into the Illinois House and
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:23.280]  In an unprecedented session at two o'clock today
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.940]  the Illinois House
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:32.080]  Judiciary number one committee actually was brung into session to look at the gun ban bill
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:35.520]  The Speaker of the House Michael Madigan
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:41.940]  He is so confident that the gun ban bill will pass out of committee that at five o'clock today, Illinois time
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:49.000]  He is actually going to bring the full house of the Illinois General Assembly the house of the Illinois General Assembly to session now
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.220]  It originally came out of the Senate and passed committee, but they didn't have a Senate vote
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:58.420]  Are they gonna try to pass it in the house first? Yeah, they're doing today in an unprecedented vote today
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:01.000]  I mean all the dirty tricks were done out today Alex
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:07.780]  This was done so late Friday that even the Illinois State Rifle Association could not get out an alert
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:14.860]  Listen my gut told me my gut I said it on Thursday and Friday they would they would sneak attack put it back up

[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.760]  They can't bar Chicagoans promoting guns to defend themselves
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.000]  So they're striking back as any globalist would is just take every gun
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.120]  We've got my goodness
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:16.440]  And they're gonna use this as the model with an executive order the Washington Post reports yesterday
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:22.800]  Saturday to just have Obama sign an order taking our guns and his plan is to start a civil war
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.360]  These people are criminals. I'm sorry. Go ahead, sir
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:31.840]  Well, that is what's happening Alex will see the General Assembly with this vote because this is a dirty-tricks vote

[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:15.360]  I talked to him Friday and we knew that there was a chance that they were going to introduce it into the Illinois house
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:18.800]  but we didn't know they were going to fast-track it at that time and
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:25.640]  Richard had actually left the Capitol and went back to chat. Yeah, when are we gonna stop falling into their traps?
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:32.360]  I said Thursday and Friday, they're gonna play possum and people are like stop fear-mongering. I know the enemy's tactics

[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:32.780]  I was reading Pentagon public documents about how foreign banks were going to take over America. That was their new boss
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:39.780]  Army War College, it's all public and it's not even classified and how they use info war to control us with lies
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:45.700]  Doesn't mean the average man and woman in the military is bad. They're great people the globalists that run our military
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.460]  They're using military mind control
[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:50.980]  Manipulation techniques on us and I'm done
[01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:53.860]  playing games with it and
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:21:00.020]  It doesn't matter how much fancy propaganda you got once people see behind the curtain doesn't matter how fancy the facade is
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:04.940]  It's over and we are on the march. The Empire is on the run
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:12.300]  If these crooks in the Illinois state legislature pass a huge gun ban ammo ban most guns

[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.320]  You thought you just go to sleep America and keep all your liberties think again
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:00.020]  Bruce
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:04.080]  When are they voting on this and then if it was in the Senate before?
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:09.880]  Will it have to go through the house into the Senate or what's the time frame? What's the order of things here?
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:14.400]  Okay. Well Alex the current order is that at two o'clock today the house?
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:20.840]  Judiciary number one committee was brung into session and the bill was introduced or filed for that committee
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:28.860]  That bill has to be heard in that committee and then like I said earlier at five o'clock today Michael Madigan the speaker of the Illinois
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:35.960]  House was bringing the full house to session at five o'clock with the intent that they're going to be there. Hopefully
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:40.480]  For that bill to come out of committee so it can go straight to the floor
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:46.840]  We're 22 minutes central time into five. This is happening right now. It's happening right now. Yes, sir
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:47.360]  Yes, sir
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:53.280]  And in our Illinois the history of Illinois is a lot of things bad things happen about midnight
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.800]  That's right and the way this thing works
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.640]  as long as
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.760]  Madigan can keep that committee in session until he can
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:08.840]  Brow beat somebody to change their vote and make sure that it passes the committee it will then go immediately to the floor of the house
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:11.600]  And this General Assembly in Illinois for a vote
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:17.280]  Texas I've stormed the Texas Capitol peacefully the media called it storming
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:23.320]  I just marched in with hundreds of people over the TSA the bills been reintroduced to arrest them this time when they grow puss I
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:28.920]  Call don't you call for peaceful citizens to go in right now to that committee and to go into those?
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.440]  the
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:33.360]  Representatives offices and let them know it's your capital
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:37.360]  I say it's time for Illinoisans to take their state back from the Mafia
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.440]  Absolutely, Alex. In fact, there's a call out
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:46.440]  See that they see the dirty trick about this stunning is the dirty trick about this stunning is it happened late?
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:51.280]  Friday so that people actually couldn't rally and didn't even know what's happening
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.680]  And then you go home to spend one day with your look look
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:59.440]  I knew this would happen, but people said oh Alex come on. Let us have a victory that there they are right now
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.920]  They're introducing the bill
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.560]  Amendment one it is all happening right now ladies and gentlemen this is insane
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:12.920]  Believe that this vote was structured in a deliberate attempt to stop people like you and others from great creating the grassroots
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:19.520]  Movement and so that people couldn't go to Springfield and couldn't attend these hearings. That's right. Let me say it this way
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.200]  Let me say it this way
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:26.080]  do you think they're openly introducing bills to take almost all the guns federally and
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:32.240]  bragging about it and letting piers Morgan and the Chinese government and the Russian government call for our guns to be turned in with the
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:38.320]  UN treaty coming up in March if they weren't planning on doing this okay folks. I know it's unpopular
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:44.480]  I know it's unconstitutional. I know when I look in their beady little eyes. They're planning on war
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:51.880]  I'm telling you this is it and we can beat them, but people got to admit. There's a fight happening. Well. Yes, sir Alex
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:56.080]  I do agree with that now. I do have a slight different take on all this gun control bills
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:01.560]  You know remember Joseph Farah when he came on to your show, and he talked about how he was afraid that
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:08.720]  Barack Obama and his controllers would line people up and basically do away with them and remember how you played on the air
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:14.560]  No, that's what Bill Ayers told Obama in the FBI files was they were gonna kill put 50 million of us in camps and kill us
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:20.880]  Yeah, well understand. You know Barack Obama is a hardcore communist, but Barack Obama understands power and
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:25.600]  What brocco I believe is happening here is I believe that this is the beginning of a purge
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:28.600]  You know if Barack Obama can use the color of law
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:35.080]  They're bragging on Democratic sites, this is a way to harass gun owners everywhere
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:40.400]  This is how they make us the enemy. This is what Homeland Security's for yes, we'll see this will purge
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:47.420]  Obama's critics it will purge his opposition and Obama can in a sense change the demographics in the political
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.520]  Landscape of the United States and ensure that he and his minions will be in
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:56.160]  I don't know why you said we disagree. They've introduced the amendment to making president for life, basically
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:59.520]  Hjres 15 federally I totally concur with you
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:06.880]  Yeah, I mean to disagree. I mean I have a different take I mean I believe that this gun control situation is literally a purge I
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:13.280]  Believe it's the purge of Obama's. Oh, they've actually all over the Democratic sites that we've got an article coming out tomorrow
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.000]  I told Paul about it mother writers like a week ago, but
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:21.280]  Soon articles coming out because I see it everywhere. I sent him a bunch of examples to write an article where they go
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:26.720]  We hope you don't turn them in we're gonna kill you and these are big official sites. No this is it these people
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:32.440]  This is this is Russia 1948
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:39.320]  Now you're right and for those that don't know they kill most people after 48, okay, I appreciate your call
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:44.400]  Yeah, and see I'm so busy. I can't keep track of everything guy calls it. He says look it up
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:48.060]  I look it up there. It is. I look up the Statehouse website look up the video feed
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:50.700]  They're in there debating the bill on the floor of the house right now
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:58.140]  They promised they wouldn't reintroduce it on Friday a pack of liars, and I know they're liars
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:04.220]  Why did I didn't believe them because I wanted to go home for a day and a half and sit around cook food play with
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:06.380]  board games with my children and
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:10.700]  Quite frankly go out and shoot my rifle in the backyard because I live out in the country. I mean
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:17.620]  But you know what all my neighbors were shooting. I've never heard all my neighbors on three sides of me
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:20.220]  Shooting and this weekend. They were all shooting
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:27.480]  People get what's going on and again the low-level folks say well, why do you want my guns?
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:34.620]  And then the establishment says well for everybody's safety they want our guns to dominate us
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:39.820]  Let's jam in a call before we go to break another caller from Illinois Greg in Illinois. You're on the air go ahead
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:47.340]  I don't Alex. Thanks for doing what you do. I just like to tell you how crooked this is
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:51.500]  I want to underline it so everybody else that's listening can understand
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:57.660]  It's so crooked like like the previous caller said you know it's unprecedented
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:00.220]  They brought told us they weren't going to do anything
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:04.220]  And they brought it in on Friday where they couldn't get the word out now
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:12.320]  They've got everybody in there doing their thing and we can't I've been trying to call all day all the voicemails are full

[01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:23.260]  Understand that but that's quite a way from where I'm at and it's not a possibility for me today. I understand
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:25.660]  But we're not like for affiliates in Illinois
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:30.040]  Everybody needs to get there or the state police are coming to take your guns
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:35.640]  You're right. You're right, but it's coming to every other state everybody got to watch it

[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:34.920]  You know the old saying stand for something fall for anything
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:38.920]  You don't stand for something you're like a leaf in the wind my friends
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:44.880]  You know if I had to quantify the New World Order global government all it is is a bunch of Bernie Madoff Ken Lay types
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:52.880]  Who in the last 200 years got governments and corporations and companies to borrow money from them out of nothing
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:56.880]  And now they've got 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives out there and
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:00.880]  Globalism is just a bunch of international crooks only a few thousand of them
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:04.880]  Exempt from all the other laws playing countries off against each other
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:12.880]  Getting rid of national sovereignty and basically trying to get governments to lobby
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:18.880]  Legislatures to raise taxes to pay corporate welfare to them
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:22.880]  And now they know we're getting awakes they're like hey how about you give us those guns too
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:28.880]  And just sit down there and shut up while we militarize and federalize the police and buy all these weapons and
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:30.880]  Billions around to ammo and tanks
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:34.880]  Never mind those cameras giving you tickets when you drive down the road from point to point
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:36.880]  Never mind your kids being trained to spy on you
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:39.880]  Never mind the NSA yeah we'll use drones to kill citizens
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.880]  Sit down and shut up
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:44.880]  You know it's almost a curse to be informed
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.880]  It's really not a curse
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:51.880]  Even if you were a cynical globalist being informed is very good for business
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.880]  But I spent
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:56.880]  I didn't really talk about Al Gore and his current TV
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:02.880]  Deal selling out to Qatar in the Arab emirates over in the Middle East
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:06.880]  Until I'd had some time Friday and Saturday to study it a bit
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:09.880]  And I already knew what was going on but I wanted to make sure you know
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.880]  That's why I'm so frustrated once I get on air
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.880]  Because there's just all this research behind it that I could never put out on air
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:17.880]  Because of time constraints
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:20.880]  But I went and did the research it turns out Forbes already done it all for us
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.880]  And it's an article titled Current TV
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:26.880]  Sold to Al Jazeera for $500 million deal for Al Gore
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:31.880]  Average listenership or viewership was 40,000 people an hour
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:36.880]  A B-rate AM station in a major city has 40,000 listeners an hour
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:39.880]  They're probably charging $100 an ad
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:41.880]  Al Gore was charging $10,000 an ad
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:46.880]  That was just big corporations kind of giving him you know their donation to put out anti-gun info
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:49.880]  And it turns out they're talking about Al Gore
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:53.880]  And it turns out they're talking about how it's a foreign run media now here in the US
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:55.880]  State run Arab media Al Jazeera
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:58.880]  That's bad enough violates a bunch of laws
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.880]  But the biggest issue of this globalism
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:03.880]  Is that he got all this oil money too from it
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.880]  And he's a hypocrite about that
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.880]  When he's already been one of the biggest oil men in American
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:09.880]  Modern American history and politics
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:10.880]  Occidental petroleum
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:11.880]  He wants a global
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:13.880]  I saw a comment on a YouTube video I did
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.880]  Saying you mean we pay our taxes to Al Gore
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.880]  And people said well he owns the software for the carbon trading
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:22.880]  No he has a company called Gore and Blood
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.880]  In London a Rothschild company
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.880]  That you pay carbon taxes to
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:30.880]  Where they trade the carbon credits okay
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:33.880]  You pay the money to Al Gore
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:36.880]  They couldn't get the feds to ram it through so they got
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:39.880]  Counties and cities that were traitorous like Austin Texas to sign on
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:41.880]  And yes Austinites
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:43.880]  Through different Austin energy programs
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:46.880]  Pay money to Al Gore
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:47.880]  When you turn your light switch on
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.880]  That man bear pig fat
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:51.880]  Turd of a man
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:52.880]  Con artist
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.880]  I was watching the Beverly Hillbillies with my children
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.880]  I let them watch old TV yesterday
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.880]  And they had a con artist episode where this con artist
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:36:59.880]  Comes to their house and
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.880]  He takes them to sell them the Hollywood Bowl
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:03.880]  And then he takes them to sell them the zoo
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:06.880]  And he goes I tell you what if you buy these from me
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:10.880]  I'll throw in this this highway
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:16.880]  I mean Al Gore is that type of con artist
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.880]  But let me go to your calls I said I'd go to your calls
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:20.880]  The issue here is
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:22.880]  Carriage rights
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.880]  If you've got
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:26.880]  On average about 5 million viewers a day
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.880]  It varies in the regulations
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:30.880]  You can force your way on the basic cable
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:32.880]  But basic cable gets bigger and bigger
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.880]  Because of that and charge people
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.880]  On average 56 dollars more than double what it was
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.880]  When Al Gore is vice president
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:41.880]  Honcho the 96 telecommunications act
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:43.880]  So he went and twisted arms
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:45.880]  They admit this in the article
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:48.880]  To put current TV on the air five six years ago
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.880]  With no viewers
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:52.880]  Because he gets an automatic payment
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:55.880]  From everybody with basic cable and basic satellite
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.880]  And now he gets a foreign government purchase
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.880]  Roughly five times what it was even worth
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:04.880]  I mean just amazing
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.880]  Amazing and that's just one little
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.880]  One little scam
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.880]  And it is a scam
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.880]  I talked about this last week
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.880]  Congress gets caught inside our trading
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.880]  They go you know what we'll pass a law to outlaw it
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:18.880]  It was already illegal
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.880]  But they play that little game
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.880]  That bait and switch
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:24.880]  We'll pass a law to make it illegal
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.880]  They pass a law to legalize it
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.880]  Talk about crooks
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.880]  Frank in New York you're on the air
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.880]  Thanks for holding brother go ahead
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:34.880]  How are you Alex?
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.880]  Listen I just want to thank you
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:38.880]  For doing what you're doing for the past 17 years
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:40.880]  You've been very knowledgeable
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:42.880]  Everything you say is on
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.880]  But the whole thing this is Alex
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:46.880]  This is actually that intervention
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:48.880]  This is going to happen regardless of what we do
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:50.880]  I hate to sound so cynical about it
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.880]  But it's going to happen
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:54.880]  Unfortunately
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:56.880]  Well it is true we've killed
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:58.880]  53 million babies and say they're not babies
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:00.880]  And we've launched
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:02.880]  All these illegal wars and we've become
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.880]  Decadent and evil
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:06.880]  Anytime a country becomes decadent and evil it falls
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.880]  We'll fall just like Mexico
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.880]  Just like North Korea
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:12.880]  That is our future
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.880]  You know the Rothschilds actually want to create
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:16.880]  Israel I believe you know that as well too
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:20.880]  I know the Rothschilds are at the very head
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.880]  They're at the very head of wanting to create
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.880]  World government absolutely Frank
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.880]  My point is
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:28.880]  They want to create Israel
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:30.880]  After World War II
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.880]  They funded the founding of it
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:34.880]  Correct
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.880]  But my point is that
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.880]  Without Israel
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.880]  This would not happen I know this sounds crazy
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:42.880]  But Israel has to happen
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.880]  For the anti-correct to come back
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.880]  That's all I have to tell you
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.880]  No I hear you and you know Israel
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:50.880]  Every citizen that wants a gun is issued full auto
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:52.880]  And we pay for it with our taxes
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.880]  But then Israel came out and said
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:56.880]  Their foreign minister said take our guns
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:58.880]  It's like oh I pay for your M16
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:00.880]  And Israel said yeah that's right
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.880]  Yes and one more thing Alex
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:04.880]  Do me a big favor tomorrow night
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.880]  Can you please kick his ass tomorrow
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:08.880]  Piers Morgan I can't stand that
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:10.880]  I'm going to be polite
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.880]  Now with the red coat
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:14.880]  But I'm sure I'll let him attack me first
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.880]  Then I won't physically do anything
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:18.880]  He's got a bunch of bodyguards
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:20.880]  Anyways and I'm actually afraid of Piers Morgan
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.880]  I'm being sarcastic folks
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.880]  I'm flying up there just for the fun of it
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:26.880]  So we'll see what happens
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.880]  Thank you you're on the air go ahead
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:30.880]  Well a couple of suggestions
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:32.880]  For you and I do hope you will consider taking them
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:34.880]  To heart first of all
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:36.880]  Every time you mention the whole thing
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:38.880]  About the TSA and the police doing random
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.880]  Searches on the roads and everything
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.880]  You always forget to state the most important thing
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:44.880]  And that is that we actually do have
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:46.880]  The right to refuse searches like that
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:48.880]  No no we do but the average cop
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.880]  Doesn't know that and it'll beat your brains out or shoot you
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.880]  This is totally
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:54.880]  Unconstitutional
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:56.880]  I like telling Rosa Parks go to the back of the bus
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:58.880]  She didn't have to and absolutely
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:00.880]  Have you heard they're signing up all over the country
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:02.880]  Gang checkpoints where they search your vehicle
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.880]  I mean this is called martial law
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:06.880]  Yes and I know
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:08.880]  But we shouldn't be afraid to refuse
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:10.880]  Because as long as we have our rights we might as well use them
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:12.880]  Whenever we have them so I'm just suggesting
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.880]  Make sure you point out we do have the right to refuse
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.880]  Whenever you bring that up
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.880]  And I also have another suggestion
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:20.880]  The whole thing you did
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.880]  About the TSA week
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:24.880]  Has inspired me to suggest
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:26.880]  Maybe you do another thing for a day
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:28.880]  Like maybe mock Big Brother
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:30.880]  Because the fact is I know Big Brothers
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.880]  Oh no no we don't want to have people go out
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:34.880]  And climb up poles and bash
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:36.880]  Security cameras with baseball bats
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:38.880]  We don't want anything illegal to happen
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.880]  I mean what would protesting Big Brother week consist of?
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:42.880]  Yeah I know
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.880]  I don't want us to break anything but
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:46.880]  No no we should just take cancer shots
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.880]  Vaccines full of cancer
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:50.880]  Let's talk to Mark in Oregon
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.880]  Mark you got one minute we're going to break go ahead
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.880]  Hello Alex
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:56.880]  Hey buddy
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.880]  Alex not the main reason I call
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.880]  I hope you could hold me after the break for a moment
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:02.880]  So I could get to it real quick
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.880]  But I think it may be the main reason that I call
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:06.880]  I'm not sure
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.880]  And I'm not trying to be negative or morbid here Alex
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.880]  Or to discourage you in any way
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:12.880]  But I've heard what you've had to say
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:14.880]  About Piers Morgan
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.880]  You know recently
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:18.880]  And I know it to be true
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:20.880]  We're going to have Mohammed come to the mountain
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:22.880]  Rather than you go to see him
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:24.880]  Oh no I love going into the lion's den
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:26.880]  Man I love going into the
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.880]  I don't mean that Alex
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.880]  I mean this is a very
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:32.880]  Accelerated
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.880]  Event
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:36.880]  Framework that we're living in at this time
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:38.880]  And I fear for your safety
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:40.880]  My brother
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:42.880]  You know what Obi Wan Kenobi
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:44.880]  Look I got to jump I got to get to everybody
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:46.880]  But I appreciate you look look
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:48.880]  No more of this stuff
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.880]  You know what Obi Wan Kenobi tells Darth Vader
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:52.880]  Strike me down Darth I shall become
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:54.880]  More powerful than you can
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:56.880]  Possibly imagine
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:58.880]  I am not worried about anything
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:02.880]  We have witnessed
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:04.880]  Two terrible storms in the east
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:06.880]  But we are still in the eye of the perfect storm
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:08.880]  The most devastating
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:10.880]  Economic condition since the great depression
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.880]  America's worst drought in agricultural history
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:14.880]  And now the economic
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:16.880]  Results of the presidential election
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:18.880]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:20.880]  Everyone's food supply
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:22.880]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:24.880]  From E Foods Direct and I recommend you do the same
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:26.880]  It's time to get your own supply
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.880]  From E Foods Direct

[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.880]  Trading my freedom for food
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:34.880]  I'm taking control of my future
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:36.880]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same

[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:36.880]  And leave the silver at the surface
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:38.880]  But rather we have formulated our silver
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:40.880]  Gel using the natural skin nourishing

[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:26.880]  I'm going to get to at least you guys
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:28.880]  Mark, make your other point real quick

[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.880]  Okay Alex, and just quickly in passing to my other point
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.880]  When you get on Pierce Morgan's show
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:36.880]  If you would please bring up the gross inconsistencies

[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:42.880]  And perhaps discuss false flags
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:44.880]  False flags in general
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:46.880]  I think it hit it really good
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:48.880]  I really do
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:50.880]  Alex, my main point
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:52.880]  Is that John Moore
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:54.880]  And he says eight other public
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:56.880]  Figures who have very high level
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.880]  Competential sources
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:00.880]  In various US federal
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:02.880]  Government agencies
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:04.880]  All agree across the board
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:06.880]  That the scenario is to occur in March
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.880]  Where we have the perfect storm
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:10.880]  Of the gun grab
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:12.880]  Having gone on for a bit
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:14.880]  Or commencing
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:16.880]  Financial collapse
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:18.880]  Martial law and then civil war
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:20.880]  Well I hope that's not the case
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.880]  And if we get the word out
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:24.880]  These tyrants won't be able to do this
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:26.880]  But they didn't set up homeland security
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.880]  And all the tanks and armor
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:30.880]  And anti-gun training to play deadly winks
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:32.880]  Frank in Louisiana, you're on the air Frank
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:34.880]  Welcome
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:36.880]  Yes Alex, we have to remind these traitors
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:38.880]  That they are literal traitors
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:40.880]  You can't legislate away the bill of rights
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:42.880]  And we have to remind them
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:44.880]  That you're in violation of your

[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:52.880]  And by the way we were watching
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:54.880]  The live Illinois Statehouse feed
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:56.880]  And when the bill came up they went
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:58.880]  Let's go to closed session
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:00.880]  And they turned the video feed off
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:02.880]  To take their guns
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:04.880]  I'm sorry go ahead
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:06.880]  Well they're in violation of the Article 6 oath
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:08.880]  Which when that contract is broken
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:10.880]  You didn't default to that contract
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.880]  We don't have to do anything
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:14.880]  Hey this government is not legitimate already
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:16.880]  They say our military is under
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:18.880]  NATO UN command last year
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:20.880]  And they have to be
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:22.880]  Reminded that the right of the people
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:24.880]  Clause followed by the infringement clause
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:26.880]  Says we have a right
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:28.880]  From God as declared
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:30.880]  The declaration of independence
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:32.880]  Which is organic law still cited on the
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:34.880]  First pages of the statutes at large
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:36.880]  That's right our rights don't come
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:38.880]  From government or even the constitution
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:40.880]  Of bill of rights they come from God
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:42.880]  They're unalienable
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:44.880]  They're unalienable they're on record
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:46.880]  Great point Frank anything else?
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:48.880]  Well one thing that you might
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.880]  Just put into the thought process
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:52.880]  Is we have to ask the government
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:54.880]  Why are you charging us a heavy progressive
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:56.880]  Income tax it's forbidden by the
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:58.880]  Rules of direct apportionment in the constitution
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:00.880]  Didn't have it until 1913 it's all
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:02.880]  Paid to the private federal reserve
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.880]  It's the foreign federal reserve sucking us dry
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.880]  They brag they're foreign
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:08.880]  They call us dumb slaves
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:10.880]  To the public find out what the Goldman Sachs
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:12.880]  And people say about you
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:14.880]  Let's talk to Noel in Illinois
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:16.880]  Shite of the treachery go ahead Noel
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:18.880]  Yes before my
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:20.880]  Comments on the gun grabbing
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.880]  Anyone in Austin I highly suggest
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:24.880]  You go to the Austin Hilton Convention
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:26.880]  Center at 745
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:28.880]  Tonight T. Boone Pickens
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:30.880]  Will be speaking at the annual meeting
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:32.880]  Of the American Meteorological Society
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:34.880]  And heck go protest all week
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:36.880]  That's right they're having a big weather
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:38.880]  Notification chemtrail meeting here in Austin
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:40.880]  The next two days we're going to have reporters
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:42.880]  There you make your point on the guns
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:44.880]  Okay Mike
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:46.880]  Madigan his daughter Lisa Madigan
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:48.880]  The attorney general of Illinois
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:50.880]  Lost an embarrassing suit when
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:52.880]  The courts ruled that Illinois can't have
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:54.880]  Concealed carry so it's no surprise
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:56.880]  That they're doing this at such
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:50:58.880]  Rapid speed yeah the answer is
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:00.880]  Oh really courts say you can have a gun we're just
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.880]  Going to take them all we're going to jump down to Ray
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:04.880]  In California they're also trying to totally
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:06.880]  Ban guns there now the few that are still there
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:08.880]  Open gun bans being pushed by the
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:10.880]  Globalist who are arming with the teeth against
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:12.880]  Us and all have bodyguards and their own
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:14.880]  Special licenses go ahead
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:16.880]  Ray
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:18.880]  Go ahead welcome
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:20.880]  Hi I just wanted to say
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:22.880]  I'm more concerned about
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:24.880]  Bio Holocaust and subsequent nuclear
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:26.880]  Holocaust that is probably going to run with
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.880]  This gun ban thing that's going on
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:30.880]  Well we got a federal government
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:32.880]  That injected black people with syphilis and
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:34.880]  Gave foreigner kids polio
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:36.880]  And it's all irradiated our soldiers
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:38.880]  So how dare you say the government
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:40.880]  Would ever do anything corrupt or illegal
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:42.880]  That's impossible I mean the government
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:44.880]  Is run by foreign banks that are
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:46.880]  Eugenicist and say they want world government to
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:48.880]  Cut off resources and kill us I mean
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:50.880]  That's loving Ray I appreciate
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:52.880]  Your call Spence in Missouri

[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:12.880]  Talked to you once before just for a brief moment
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:14.880]  Just south of the big 72,000
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:16.880]  Square footer
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:18.880]  Hey listen they've blocked off
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:20.880]  All the caves around here with bars
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:22.880]  They've put concrete
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:24.880]  Up around them
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:26.880]  They're blocking all the highways with cables where you can't cut
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:28.880]  Across they're digging in against us
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:30.880]  They're cutting it the foreign occupation is here
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:32.880]  And the cops are dumb enough to march
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:34.880]  Off against the American people holy mackerel
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:36.880]  Real quick on the gun man
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:38.880]  Listen I have I hope you
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:40.880]  Don't mind I started
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:42.880]  Just a small website to try to get people
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:44.880]  Informed around here
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:46.880]  Because just
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:48.880]  And I've used a little bit of your information

[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:56.880]  We're trying to get people
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:58.880]  I've owned to your show
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:00.880]  And I'm trying to buy the magazines from you
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:02.880]  I'm trying to get everything I can
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:04.880]  In hardcore literature I've ordered
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.880]  All of the discs
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.880]  I want to get this stuff tangible
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:10.880]  So that we can produce this
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:12.880]  I've got an IT department
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:14.880]  I employ probably 20 people
[01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:16.880]  I'm sick to my stomach with this crap
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:18.880]  No I hear you Spence
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:20.880]  And God bless you I appreciate your call
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:22.880]  Speaking of magazines

[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:26.880]  Where you've gained your life
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:28.880]  Realizing that we're all focused on football
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:30.880]  Entertainment, TV
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:32.880]  All these petty things
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:34.880]  While global corporate combines
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:36.880]  Are coming in taking over our government
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:38.880]  Socializing the public to make us dependent
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:40.880]  While siphoning and skimming
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.880]  Off the money overseas
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:44.880]  We sell the magazine at cost
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:46.880]  They're almost sold out the January issue

[01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:58.880]  And said this man wants your guns
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:00.880]  And broke down he would use executive orders
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:02.880]  To go after your guns

[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:30.880]  In North Dakota
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:32.880]  You're on the air Jeff go ahead
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:34.880]  Hey Alex how are you doing?
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:36.880]  Good
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:38.880]  Hey I've been spending about the whole entire day
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:40.880]  Trying to get through to these Illinois
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:42.880]  Reps about this gun ban
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:44.880]  They've just turned their phones off
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:46.880]  Yeah they're mafia
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:48.880]  I finally did get through to somebody
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:50.880]  Sid Matthias' secretary
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:52.880]  Or something
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:54.880]  She told me the bill did not get called
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:56.880]  And I thanked her for the
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:58.880]  Information but then you just reported
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:00.880]  That they did call the bill
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:02.880]  And they went into committee
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:04.880]  Well they change stuff all the time
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:06.880]  But according to the Illinois state rifle association
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:08.880]  And we were watching it and they brought up the bills
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:10.880]  A group of bills including that one
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:12.880]  And they said we're going to closed session
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:14.880]  And cut the video feed
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:16.880]  Well you know maybe there's still
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:18.880]  Time for us to get some voice in on that
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:20.880]  Well my point is
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:22.880]  We now have Dianne Feinstein on record
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:24.880]  In fact you are up to end the show please
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:26.880]  All of them saying Mr. and Mrs. America
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:28.880]  Get ready to turn your guns in
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:30.880]  They want our guns, the question is why
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:32.880]  What do they have planned?
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:34.880]  Total implosion, collectivization
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:36.880]  Of America
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:38.880]  Well give Pierce Morgan
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:40.880]  A piece of my mind when you see him
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:42.880]  You know what
[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:44.880]  The last time I flew to New York to be on TV
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:46.880]  It was The View
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:48.880]  And that was a couple years ago
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.880]  And they were like okay satellite we really want you to
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:52.880]  Fly here and I went no I'm only doing
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:54.880]  Satellite and then I thought you know what

[01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:58.880]  And the first they're like

[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:08.880]  Common sense facts
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:10.880]  It'll be the biggest audience they've had in a while
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:12.880]  I mean CNN's only got about a half
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:14.880]  Million viewers now the derivative of
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:16.880]  It the YouTube videos other news picking

[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:22.880]  Out to New York and
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:24.880]  Do that interview
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:26.880]  The TSA tries to stop me

[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:40.880]  Felon doing a perp walk
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:42.880]  At a super max I mean it's just
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:44.880]  This whole culture is about
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:46.880]  Training you to be a slave
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:48.880]  Felix in New York you're our final caller
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:50.880]  Go ahead
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:52.880]  Thank you Alex just two quick things
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:54.880]  First of all my mom just suggested
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:56.880]  That you wear a
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:56:58.880]  Don't tread on me either shirt
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:00.880]  Or maybe a flag
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.880]  Because
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:04.880]  And secondly I was just
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:06.880]  Wondering what time is
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:08.880]  Is it being taped or is it going to be live?
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:10.880]  I wouldn't do it if it wasn't live
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:12.880]  It's 9 o'clock central 8 o'clock
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:14.880]  Eastern it's not that I mean
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:16.880]  I mean Jesse Ventura goes on there
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:18.880]  A lot of other folks on there it should be an interesting
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:20.880]  Interview I mean I called for his deportation
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:22.880]  So he'll say how dare you
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:24.880]  Try to violate my first amendment and I'll say you're trying to
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:26.880]  Violate my second amendment you're a foreigner
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:28.880]  I'll source the Supreme Court ruling
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:30.880]  They'll have
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:32.880]  You know Dershowitz come flapping out there

[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:54.880]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east
[01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:56.880]  But we are still in the eye of the perfect storm
[01:58:56.880 --> 01:59:00.880]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression
[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:02.880]  America's worst drought in agricultural history
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:06.880]  And now the economic results of the presidential election
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:10.880]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply

[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:22.880]  I'm taking control of my future
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:24.880]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same
