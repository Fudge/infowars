[00:00.000 --> 00:11.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.840 --> 00:19.380]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.380 --> 00:35.040]  Texas Alex Jones my friends I am totally wound up on this 10th day of July 2014
[00:35.040 --> 00:41.520]  on this Thursday edition Obama is in town there are helicopters army
[00:41.520 --> 00:47.040]  helicopters black helicopters police helicopters secret service all over
[00:47.040 --> 00:50.700]  downtown I was down there this morning they were bugging their eyes out at
[00:50.700 --> 00:54.500]  people Anthony Gucci already lives downtown and had them bugging their eyes
[00:54.500 --> 00:58.940]  out of him just driving down the street and I'm getting the point where a
[00:58.940 --> 01:01.300]  secret service is that to me I'm just gonna pull over get a camera out and
[01:01.300 --> 01:05.980]  say this isn't North Korea you work for a total criminal who we wish no harm
[01:05.980 --> 01:11.060]  upon the whole country's a giant fraud now the borders are wide open big bank
[01:11.060 --> 01:14.540]  ship in the narcotics aren't you guys supposed to be looking for hookers and
[01:14.540 --> 01:21.460]  blow they shut down all of our 35 northbound this morning and I was
[01:21.460 --> 01:26.540]  watching it on the news an hour after he'd driven by to some fundraiser from
[01:26.540 --> 01:32.620]  downtown they still had it shut down and I was driving to work and saw all the
[01:32.620 --> 01:36.100]  motorcycle cops still blocking the roads why not demolish the roads
[01:36.100 --> 01:41.300]  permanently why not nuke each city he visits as a sign of respect as he gets
[01:41.300 --> 01:45.900]  off his helicopters and is saluted a globalist publicly funding ISIS to
[01:45.900 --> 01:49.620]  carry out terror attacks and he was at Robert Rodriguez the grand dragon of
[01:49.620 --> 01:54.180]  Mecheloraza's house last night celebrating the destruction of America
[01:54.180 --> 01:58.660]  here's Leigh Ann McAdoo's report well Obama is in the neighborhood this week
[01:58.660 --> 02:03.700]  and rather than visit the border to witness firsthand the crisis that is
[02:03.700 --> 02:07.700]  largely brought on by his failed policies he is gonna be parting it up with
[02:07.700 --> 02:13.020]  people who have paid anywhere from 10 to 35 thousand dollars to bask in his
[02:13.020 --> 02:17.580]  presence at one of his democratic fundraisers tonight he is in Austin
[02:17.580 --> 02:23.880]  Texas visiting the home of Austin based filmmaker Robert Rodriguez whose
[02:23.880 --> 02:30.020]  ultra-violent machete franchise is very pro illegal immigration but instead of
[02:30.020 --> 02:34.220]  portraying illegal immigration in a positive good-for-the-economy sort of
[02:34.220 --> 02:40.300]  way Rodriguez's film bolsters support by demonizing a Texas politician who's
[02:40.300 --> 02:45.460]  seeking to tighten border control and also they portray a minute-man style
[02:45.460 --> 02:50.900]  American delighting in shooting a pregnant Mexican woman so it's hard to
[02:50.900 --> 03:01.540]  tell if it's a pro amnesty message or a la raza cattle call and of course Jessica
[03:01.540 --> 03:05.340]  Alba is gonna be one of the special guests at tonight's fundraiser now
[03:05.340 --> 03:09.140]  Robert Rodriguez has done a lot for the Latino community he's launched the
[03:09.140 --> 03:14.180]  careers of a lot of Latino actors and as well as his movie spy kids was one of
[03:14.180 --> 03:19.180]  the first theatrical franchises to feature a Latino family playing
[03:19.180 --> 03:24.020]  superheroes they were the first Latinos featured in a heroic role and Rodriguez
[03:24.020 --> 03:30.820]  did insist on that also Rodriguez is a member of the National Council of the
[03:30.820 --> 03:37.180]  Raza he's a president's council donator to La Raza who of course promotes the
[03:37.180 --> 03:43.660]  race over everything else and Rodriguez is one of the new minority owners of a
[03:43.660 --> 03:49.060]  television network his L Ray network is geared towards a Hispanic audience and
[03:49.060 --> 03:54.580]  he admits that his network he will use it if the president or the White House
[03:54.580 --> 04:00.260]  calls upon him to use the network to reach out to the Latino voters but of
[04:00.260 --> 04:05.140]  course if the way machete promotes illegal immigration is any indicator of
[04:05.140 --> 04:09.540]  how Robert Rodriguez is gonna try and reach the Latino voters well I guess
[04:09.540 --> 04:14.260]  we can expect to see more messages promoting racial division rather than
[04:14.260 --> 04:19.340]  bringing us all together so this is who Obama is spending his evening with
[04:19.340 --> 04:23.420]  tonight rather than visiting the border rather than addressing the crisis and
[04:23.420 --> 04:28.180]  actually acknowledging that this is a huge issue and maybe just showing the
[04:28.180 --> 04:32.100]  American people hey I'm not afraid to go and be in these border facilities where
[04:32.100 --> 04:35.900]  there's all these contagious diseases running rampant I mean even that to just
[04:35.900 --> 04:39.300]  go and show that now he's gonna go up with people who are paying thirty five
[04:39.300 --> 04:43.900]  thousand dollars to go party it up at Robert Rodriguez's house because he's
[04:43.900 --> 04:47.940]  showing you this is the kind of president he is and this is where he
[04:47.940 --> 04:54.420]  stands on this issue of illegal immigration alright folks we'll be right
[04:54.420 --> 04:58.060]  back that's from m4's Natalie news last night Lord Obama is still in town

[08:24.380 --> 08:34.500]  generals gathered in their masses just like witches at black masses in the
[08:34.500 --> 08:39.860]  fields the body's burning minds that plot destruction sorcerers of death
[08:39.860 --> 08:46.660]  construction and over in the Middle East right now the ISIS neural order force
[08:46.660 --> 08:55.700]  is engaged in massive destruction of Christian churches minority Muslim
[08:55.700 --> 08:59.700]  mosque and engaged in mass exterminations we're now several months into
[08:59.700 --> 09:04.340]  that three-plus years into 300 plus thousand murdered at the hands of al-qaeda
[09:04.340 --> 09:12.140]  and ISIS forces in Syria and Defense Secretary Hagel has come out saying
[09:12.140 --> 09:16.900]  every country in the world is threatened by ISIS basically give up all your
[09:16.900 --> 09:22.020]  rights or they'll kill you any minute when he literally is overseeing the
[09:22.020 --> 09:28.940]  transference of weapons to them and they are a Saudi Arabian army simply
[09:28.940 --> 09:33.380]  amazing and that's even in major defense publications that's not even hidden or
[09:33.380 --> 09:39.420]  debated at an academic or military level the general public though is being
[09:39.420 --> 09:44.180]  told we're gonna take all your rights because of ISIS when it's publicly run
[09:44.180 --> 09:48.300]  by the criminals that set upon our government I'm gonna get into Barack
[09:48.300 --> 09:52.500]  Obama and the fact that he's spending three days in Austin three hellish days
[09:52.500 --> 09:58.140]  I guess staying down at the W hotel with Secret Service crawling all over
[09:58.140 --> 10:02.580]  downtown literally bugging their eyes out hatefully at men women and children
[10:02.580 --> 10:07.260]  to let you know you are scum you are a slave it's not about keeping the
[10:07.260 --> 10:14.020]  criminal puppet Obama safe it's all about dominating America helicopters
[10:14.020 --> 10:18.420]  checkpoints I-35 the most busy highway in the country the most busy stretch is
[10:18.420 --> 10:24.620]  through Austin that's on record for the National Transportation Bureau and
[10:24.620 --> 10:34.380]  openly ladies and gentlemen I-35 shut down for hours for hours southbound
[10:34.380 --> 10:40.180]  today and even after 45 minutes after Obama had left I was watching the news I
[10:40.180 --> 10:45.340]  said I'll drive into the office now I was up to go down I-35 partway that I'm
[10:45.340 --> 10:49.340]  driving and he's been gone for 45 minutes to an hour and there's still the
[10:49.340 --> 10:55.380]  highway shut with more Austin police cars driving around and the headline is
[10:55.380 --> 11:01.580]  from KVUE Obama visit cost APD thousands how about hundreds of thousands
[11:02.340 --> 11:11.540]  and I mean I I think I want to go find some Secret Service downtown and just
[11:11.540 --> 11:14.780]  go up to them and say why are you in make-believe land bugging your eyes out
[11:14.780 --> 11:19.900]  it like families pushing baby strollers who don't even care that Obama's here
[11:19.900 --> 11:24.300]  we're here working and living and then every time the Emperor shows up he
[11:24.300 --> 11:28.500]  could easily fly helicopters to nearby fields like he does in DC and places
[11:28.500 --> 11:33.060]  they won't put up with it and then get in a limo and drive a mile to these
[11:33.060 --> 11:37.220]  fundraisers with all these different Democratic mafia bosses in Austin
[11:37.220 --> 11:41.660]  they've already destroyed California now moved here instead they would just
[11:41.660 --> 11:49.780]  want to shut everything down it really makes me want to throw up and I've
[11:49.780 --> 11:53.100]  talked to multiple people that have been downtown who are just blocks and blocks
[11:53.100 --> 11:57.260]  away from where Obama is that with the Secret Service is rolling around
[11:57.260 --> 12:01.340]  bugging their eyes out of people and I've had the Secret Service and I've
[12:01.340 --> 12:06.020]  told the story many times at Bilderberg 2008 no one knew where Hillary and
[12:06.020 --> 12:10.060]  Obama were in Virginia they disappeared for over a day we were there the the
[12:10.060 --> 12:14.260]  armored limousines came in with Hillary and Obama later came out they were
[12:14.260 --> 12:21.820]  there years later and they would actually lift HK MP5's up and point them in our
[12:21.820 --> 12:27.300]  direction as we stood there with video cameras or with bullhorns like ooh I'm
[12:27.300 --> 12:33.260]  intimidating you because you're out here reporting as if that scares me if I want
[12:33.260 --> 12:37.700]  to go buy a dark suit or sunglasses I can do it all day long I'd watch Secret
[12:37.700 --> 12:41.500]  Service walk around with their little you know their little jackets talking into
[12:41.500 --> 12:45.060]  it like they're imagining they're in movies I mean what a joke you're not
[12:45.060 --> 12:49.260]  Clint Eastwood okay and again I shouldn't even attack the Secret Service I
[12:49.260 --> 12:54.260]  know a lot of them and I know some very close to the criminal operation and they
[12:54.260 --> 12:57.860]  say it's worse than we know not just Bongino on the air it was a senior Secret
[12:57.860 --> 13:01.900]  Service but but a lot of them but I think it's the mid and low level ones that
[13:01.900 --> 13:05.780]  they have out far off they're just trying to play the part of a movie or
[13:05.780 --> 13:09.180]  something and you know I don't like going to really bad third-world countries
[13:09.180 --> 13:15.540]  because the police act a little like that and I've been in England when the
[13:15.540 --> 13:19.020]  prime minister is right down the street and their people don't act like that I've
[13:19.020 --> 13:23.500]  been there when royalties running around and they don't act like that I mean this
[13:23.500 --> 13:28.980]  is the new royalty and Edward Bernays the big psych warfare chief Sigmund
[13:28.980 --> 13:31.900]  Freud's nephew who worked for the Department of War the Department of
[13:31.900 --> 13:36.500]  Defense the greatest PR propaganda master probably of all time except for Joseph
[13:36.500 --> 13:42.100]  Goebbels maybe Joseph Goebbels was so jealous of him it came out in the Nazi
[13:42.100 --> 13:46.900]  files they had an international hit out of a million US dollars on Edward
[13:46.900 --> 13:51.860]  Bernays that's how jealous they were of him and but he was just as bad many
[13:51.860 --> 13:56.460]  respects as the Nazis and of course he wrote three books bragging about how he
[13:56.460 --> 14:04.500]  mind-controlled the public for the globalist and Bernays got into the fact
[14:04.500 --> 14:08.820]  in the 20s he worked right up into the 70s when he was like 90-something years
[14:08.820 --> 14:13.860]  old that we've got a merge politics with Hollywood that was starting to burgeon
[14:13.860 --> 14:18.780]  at the time and just make it all about how they're the new royalty so it's not
[14:18.780 --> 14:24.540]  about their policies and so the public feel removed from the political elite
[14:24.540 --> 14:30.780]  and feel powerless and that's what the helicopters and the checkpoints and the
[14:30.780 --> 14:36.660]  TSA and the red carpets and the Air Force One and the Hollywood dinners with
[14:36.660 --> 14:41.940]  Obama is all about is to make you think they're prestigious and oh my gosh like
[14:41.940 --> 14:47.580]  Hollywood people and in the political class grovels to Hollywood stars and the
[14:47.580 --> 14:52.580]  Hollywood stars then grovel to the political class I've seen it I've seen
[14:52.580 --> 15:02.860]  it myself and it is so disgusting in fact I want to find a clip from myriad old
[15:02.860 --> 15:06.420]  movies we've all seen all movies that have this that are based on real things
[15:06.420 --> 15:12.740]  that happen where the natives are about to kill everybody but the doctor throws
[15:12.740 --> 15:16.580]  some gunpowder in the fire and it explodes and they've never seen that
[15:16.580 --> 15:22.060]  before so they start bowing down or to use a return of the Jedi cheesy analogy
[15:22.060 --> 15:26.980]  the Ewoks start worshiping C-3PO thinking he's a golden god or to use
[15:26.980 --> 15:30.880]  Indiana Jones rare as a lost art they hold up the golden idol and they all
[15:30.880 --> 15:36.660]  bow down to it it's literally like natives that have never seen a firearm
[15:36.660 --> 15:40.860]  and they're about to kill you but you go a gukupatanga and you pull the trigger
[15:40.860 --> 15:47.180]  on the gun and fire it and they all start groveling in fear that's what all
[15:47.180 --> 15:50.300]  the big government buildings and the black uniforms and the checkpoints and
[15:50.300 --> 15:54.660]  the black mask and the armored vehicles are
[15:58.740 --> 16:04.220]  so this is this is what the system is and that everybody else doesn't actually
[16:04.220 --> 16:11.900]  produce literature or art or science or trailblazing everyone then becomes a
[16:11.900 --> 16:16.580]  wannabe establishment type see all these subsections of fake country club people
[16:16.580 --> 16:23.660]  and fake trendies with their mismatched socks and big beards lecturing you you
[16:23.660 --> 16:27.340]  know that it's bad to be a white male you know they're white males or you know
[16:27.340 --> 16:31.460]  the feminist movement and then that's all of this is these little empty scared
[16:31.460 --> 16:35.740]  people who don't have success who don't have an identity other than what they've
[16:35.740 --> 16:39.460]  gone and basically picked off a store shelf that they've decided is their
[16:39.460 --> 16:43.740]  humanity and they're the intellectuals and no one else is an intellectual but
[16:43.740 --> 16:48.460]  them and they're going to tell you not to use the word bossy and they're going
[16:48.460 --> 16:52.340]  to tell you not to use the word illegal immigrant and then immigrant and they're
[16:52.340 --> 16:56.780]  going to tell you what you can and can't do and they're going to do you know
[16:56.780 --> 17:05.260]  control the language and you're going to comply with them and it is all just a
[17:05.260 --> 17:14.100]  giant giant off-the-chart joke on every single level and it's a fraud but
[17:14.100 --> 17:20.940]  imagine it like 7 30 this morning I click on the local traffic news knowing
[17:20.940 --> 17:27.900]  there'd be traffic jams everywhere and I 35 is shut down during drive time it
[17:27.900 --> 17:30.740]  already takes an hour to get anywhere in the city because we they didn't build
[17:30.740 --> 17:34.300]  roads like they should they wanted to build light rail and it's all again
[17:34.300 --> 17:41.740]  globalist control and then I decided to drive in at like 10 to 15 I got ready at
[17:41.740 --> 17:46.180]  home because I had to go down an area of 35 that Obama had just gone on and again
[17:46.180 --> 17:59.220]  it was almost an hour after he'd gone by and they had all of I 35 southbound
[17:59.220 --> 18:06.300]  cab you just come on air Buckley I haven't just let's just shut everything down
[18:06.300 --> 18:12.460]  right now I have a maximum rule three years in that when you guys come on
[18:12.460 --> 18:15.380]  there unless it's telling me a guest or something's ready that I want you to
[18:15.380 --> 18:20.100]  say it on air the listeners just come on over the mic because we're gonna we're
[18:20.100 --> 18:23.860]  gonna break this habit right now go ahead a friend of mine has been stuck in
[18:23.860 --> 18:28.980]  traffic almost two hours and he sent us a video it's a road just a real simple
[18:28.980 --> 18:31.820]  quick video well I mean this is an incredible scandal because the photos
[18:31.820 --> 18:36.220]  you found guys I shot some video on my phone this morning as well are nothing
[18:36.220 --> 18:41.100]  compared to the overhead traffic cam shots they had of just 30 miles of I
[18:41.100 --> 18:46.700]  35 stopped and then long after he went it's like a revelry to for the police
[18:46.700 --> 18:54.780]  under orders to just squat on the highway and just to keep it closed as an act of
[18:54.780 --> 18:59.420]  total domination as you're going bankrupt paying for the gas prices that
[18:59.420 --> 19:07.900]  they've engineered so we're going to be breaking all of that down luckily I have
[19:07.900 --> 19:12.340]  a new code on my phone if you're having issues getting into it to get those

[19:39.900 --> 19:43.140]  ceremonies for the president than they do for the North Korean dictator this is
[19:43.140 --> 19:48.700]  so un-American it's a joke George Washington wouldn't even allow parades
[19:48.700 --> 19:54.140]  for himself because he was an American now look what they've done and this guy

[23:59.340 --> 24:15.060]  we filed a petition yesterday expanding on the one that our reporter Joe Biggs
[24:15.060 --> 24:21.700]  put up a few days ago and last time I checked it had one signature the article
[24:21.700 --> 24:28.300]  had almost a thousand comments but one signature on the article saying that we
[24:28.300 --> 24:34.780]  want the illegals the children to be bus to the White House into DC to be put in
[24:34.780 --> 24:40.180]  the Democratic Party areas and to let the Democratic Party fundraisers all the
[24:40.180 --> 24:44.620]  big rich billionaires who are tax exempt under Obama the ones that got all the
[24:44.620 --> 24:48.900]  Obamacare waivers that that they should house them but even better how about we
[24:48.900 --> 24:53.900]  go dump all the ms-13 kids and the rest of them that's now being confirmed off
[24:53.900 --> 25:01.380]  at the W downtown where the Lord and Savior is staying and by the way Austin
[25:01.380 --> 25:08.100]  media is basically covering up the fact that Obama is shut down at 35 for hours
[25:08.100 --> 25:11.540]  they're admitting there was some quote traffic problems but they're not even
[25:11.540 --> 25:16.860]  admitting that there's still traffic jams ongoing while this happens let's go
[25:16.860 --> 25:22.740]  back to the White House petition they're on screen there it is that Kurt
[25:22.740 --> 25:30.820]  Nemo and I put up and you can go to info wars.com and find the article that's
[25:30.820 --> 25:35.900]  now scrolled off into the news archive that's the top stories archive that the
[25:35.900 --> 25:40.740]  featured news top stories that roll off will be in the top stories link at the
[25:40.740 --> 25:47.300]  top of info wars.com and if you want to believe it it only has 369 signatures
[25:47.300 --> 25:52.100]  now this morning it hadn't updated in the past it would update in real time
[25:52.100 --> 25:57.140]  and we famously have had petitions that got half a million people signing them
[25:57.140 --> 26:05.780]  now we get 369 do you think they're gaming it do bears go potty in the woods
[26:05.780 --> 26:15.980]  do fish swim in the sea do ducks quack does Obama lie so that's just some of
[26:15.980 --> 26:19.820]  the news on that front now now listen I haven't even gotten into the big stack
[26:19.820 --> 26:23.580]  of border news that is exploding and our reporters that are still on the ground
[26:23.580 --> 26:27.900]  in Southern California where the feds are swearing with the sheriff to arrest
[26:27.900 --> 26:32.900]  anybody that dares try to block the precious buses where homeland security
[26:32.900 --> 26:38.500]  is human smuggling violating federal law in front of everyone to dump illegals
[26:38.500 --> 26:44.020]  at military bases across the country and at churches across the country to then
[26:44.020 --> 26:49.020]  be housed in public schools and then to be legalized and then to be given voter
[26:49.020 --> 26:55.340]  ID cards and then to vote like New York State to ban guns and we now have gun
[26:55.340 --> 26:59.420]  confiscation beginning in New York I mean it's real simple it's a mafia
[26:59.420 --> 27:06.580]  takeover and Robert Rodriguez has his L. Ray Hispanic who close clan channel and
[27:06.580 --> 27:10.300]  he's a big part of a Metsha and La Raza for those inside the race everything
[27:10.300 --> 27:14.460]  those outside the race nothing and it's openly funded by Obama I knew about this
[27:14.460 --> 27:17.660]  when it was secret but did decided not even go there because it would reveal
[27:17.660 --> 27:22.380]  sources but he's now given interviews the variety you name it saying I will use
[27:22.380 --> 27:27.660]  my Spanish speaking network to influence politics in America and open the
[27:27.660 --> 27:33.900]  border to unlimited South American you name it immigration and again this is a
[27:33.900 --> 27:39.020]  reverse colonization but we're being colonized by failed third world
[27:39.020 --> 27:44.740]  countries with the globalist working with them in tandem and again don't use
[27:44.740 --> 27:50.060]  the word bossy don't call them aliens don't call them illegal because because
[27:50.060 --> 27:54.340]  Michelle Obama said so and my god it would be so scary to tell her to go to
[27:54.340 --> 27:58.660]  hell it would be so scary to say no to these known criminals we've just got to
[27:58.660 --> 28:01.860]  do what they say because they shut down roads when they come to town they have
[28:01.860 --> 28:10.620]  red carpets the Marines salute them they are God and so they will take your house
[28:10.620 --> 28:15.780]  if you don't pay the fake income tax and they will give it to an illegal who
[28:15.780 --> 28:20.460]  will just be exploited down the road so here's the headlines gun confiscation
[28:20.460 --> 28:24.220]  begins in New York Nassau County man state police just came to my home and
[28:24.220 --> 28:29.940]  took everything as the governor promised the SWAT team raids are beginning
[28:29.940 --> 28:34.500]  Defense Secretary Hagel says ISIS imminent threat to every stabilized
[28:34.500 --> 28:37.500]  country on the earth I agree with that statement and the globalists that run
[28:37.500 --> 28:44.460]  it are the real imminent threat the globalist that run it the destabilization
[28:44.460 --> 28:49.460]  program just like the open borders here high-level NSA official the NSA has
[28:49.460 --> 28:53.780]  become Jagra Hoover on super steroids spying on everything folks it's well

[28:58.260 --> 29:01.580]  police all want to be federalized because then they get led into the star
[29:01.580 --> 29:05.780]  chamber computer rooms where they can just spy on everybody keep files on
[29:05.780 --> 29:11.140]  their ex-wife their husband it's just total beyond 1984 maximum criminal
[29:11.140 --> 29:15.500]  operation money laundering child kidnapped running I mean the government
[29:15.500 --> 29:21.780]  is 100% pure Satan now the average person mid-level doesn't even know that and the
[29:21.780 --> 29:26.180]  government has a lot of real functions but at the top I mean it might as well
[29:26.180 --> 29:31.220]  be Elsie Bob captaining it let's continue shock reports 70 million people
[29:31.220 --> 29:34.460]  would be starving in the streets without government welfare programs that's
[29:34.460 --> 29:38.660]  coming up washington's arrogance will destroy its empire that's part of the
[29:38.660 --> 29:42.740]  plan they want the mega empire to rise Chinese purchases of u.s. real estate
[29:42.740 --> 29:46.700]  up 70% is the Bank of China facilitates money laundering they're

[33:20.980 --> 33:27.380]  the late former head of the Star Wars program nuclear physicist and engineer
[33:27.380 --> 33:31.340]  dr. Bob Bowman was the secret head of the Star Wars program that was later
[33:31.340 --> 33:37.300]  declassified he said by 1979 when the Star Wars program was already old under
[33:37.300 --> 33:42.340]  another name public was told about it in the 80s there was a fleet of over a
[33:42.340 --> 33:49.780]  hundred space planes with du sebo decapitation weapons to take out
[33:49.780 --> 33:55.700]  governments even under mountains and then he could only talk about that because
[33:55.700 --> 34:01.340]  it had been accidentally declassified well here it is in the week newspaper the
[34:01.340 --> 34:13.100]  Pentagon's plan to put robot marines in space and it breaks it down how they're
[34:13.100 --> 34:21.740]  launching robot drones in space yeah yeah they're launching on 2014 I mean
[34:21.740 --> 34:28.060]  basically 35 years ago 36 years ago there was already a fleet of these in
[34:28.060 --> 34:33.580]  orbit and you can bet whatever the public's going to be shown is going to
[34:33.580 --> 34:43.060]  be the super old models like the ones we have on screen that is a 1970s model on
[34:43.060 --> 34:49.460]  screen and they're telling you about it in 2014 oh my gosh what an incredible
[34:49.460 --> 34:56.540]  declassification that's how I told you how the NSA controlled everything with
[34:56.540 --> 34:59.380]  their hubs and all the telecommunications buildings how they use
[34:59.380 --> 35:03.980]  keywords and how they were building the systems and the compression to save
[35:03.980 --> 35:09.380]  everything in real time I told you that in 1997 and again I'm not bragging it's
[35:09.380 --> 35:17.020]  that you better listen to me now about what won't come out for five ten years
[35:17.020 --> 35:21.620]  because they're not waiting 40 years 35 years to bring stuff out me now they're
[35:21.620 --> 35:28.620]  bringing every five ten and let me give you the news flash remember while we're
[35:28.620 --> 35:32.660]  talking about open borders and all the corruption the government funding ISIS
[35:32.660 --> 35:38.260]  and they don't care that you know it's because they think you're done they've
[35:38.260 --> 35:41.900]  already put stuff in the food and water supply that's way beyond even what I
[35:41.900 --> 35:47.940]  know they've already jacked with basically the atmosphere you name it we're
[35:47.940 --> 35:59.020]  not in 2014 boys and girls and that's why they treat you like your wild dogs or
[35:59.020 --> 36:03.020]  something they don't even treat us like we're natives that they you know they're
[36:03.020 --> 36:09.900]  at the fort and they fire the shotgun to scare the natives off or you know have a
[36:09.900 --> 36:18.060]  fancy Trojan horse they treat us like wild dogs or like a lice or something
[36:18.060 --> 36:25.900]  they're just brushing off of us and that's the attitude and so they can
[36:25.900 --> 36:31.900]  engage in all their little weird fantasies of engaging in dehumanization
[36:31.900 --> 36:37.580]  in mad scientist behavior on us social engineering to the point of saying you
[36:37.580 --> 36:41.540]  will not use the word bossy and you will say two plus two equals whatever we say
[36:41.540 --> 36:45.820]  is that clear and we go yes I don't want to be racist there's a video that I'm
[36:45.820 --> 36:50.780]  going to play here in a few minutes before I get into all this news it's up
[36:50.780 --> 36:59.220]  on info wars.com that is incredibly shocking video crazed abortion
[36:59.220 --> 37:06.620]  advocate attacks peaceful pro-lifers and we have the unedited video with the
[37:06.620 --> 37:11.140]  goblin troll. In fact I told Watson to go with the headline this morning of
[37:11.140 --> 37:15.940]  goblin trolls attack pro-lifers but he didn't think that was professional but I
[37:15.940 --> 37:21.780]  mean when the shoe fits actual goblin troll
[37:22.340 --> 37:28.180]  literally doesn't need makeup be in the next Lord of the Rings cave troll runs
[37:28.180 --> 37:33.540]  up and begins screaming at pro-lifers who were at a big city abortion clinic that
[37:33.540 --> 37:40.380]  on record mainly kills minority babies and begins screaming racist and begins
[37:40.380 --> 37:46.380]  attacking the pro-lifers and rips their sign down and stomps on it because when
[37:46.380 --> 37:50.900]  they invoke the word race it doesn't matter they can't tie their shoe laces
[37:50.900 --> 37:58.740]  it doesn't matter that this troll like white woman and I shouldn't make fun
[37:58.740 --> 38:04.220]  of how she looks but it's just it totally fits the bill this intellectually
[38:04.220 --> 38:09.540]  ugly person begins screaming you anti-woman anti-minority you racist
[38:09.540 --> 38:16.340]  and begins attacking him hitting him and then and then invokes racist and then
[38:16.340 --> 38:21.660]  attacks racist so you know as Obama turns ISIS loose to murder Christians and
[38:21.660 --> 38:27.420]  Muslims all of the Middle East blow up mosque churches 300,000 dead in Syria you
[38:27.420 --> 38:31.100]  know as they break down the borders as hundreds of thousands get killed in
[38:31.100 --> 38:36.580]  Mexico by the cartels no one cares you just showed Don Johnson shooting a
[38:36.580 --> 38:41.060]  pregnant woman in a fictitious movie made by a literal Hispanic grand dragon
[38:41.060 --> 38:45.820]  of the Hispanic race nation that they're trying to make Hispanics join instead
[38:45.820 --> 38:49.020]  of having basic liberty and freedom and joining the Liberty Nation which I'm
[38:49.020 --> 38:54.220]  trying to get everybody to join they're at an abortion clinic where 80% of the
[38:54.220 --> 39:00.820]  abortions are minority babies that's CNS news and so if you don't want black and
[39:00.820 --> 39:07.340]  Hispanic babies literally chopped up and you're white you're a racist and how
[39:07.340 --> 39:13.300]  many abortion clinic places videos have you seen where you'll be white people
[39:13.300 --> 39:17.260]  trying to get them to not kill the black babies and they'll have a black person
[39:17.260 --> 39:24.260]  or an Asian doctor run out and say no one wants the ugly dumb black babies we've
[39:24.260 --> 39:27.740]  played those clips many times we've got a guest coming out about this later so
[39:27.740 --> 39:31.620]  we'll play it then no one wants and I've used to hear that myself I have gone and
[39:31.620 --> 39:35.580]  protest and also covered protest where there were resting pro-life protesters
[39:35.580 --> 39:40.460]  who weren't even on the abortion clinic property in Austin before years ago back
[39:40.460 --> 39:46.740]  in 96 97 and they would run up and push on me and say nobody wants the black
[39:46.740 --> 39:50.420]  babies and to be like black people or white people doing so always say that
[39:50.420 --> 39:53.260]  the black preachers I have on about it like Reverend Childress and others a
[39:53.260 --> 39:56.460]  black genocide report and they go of course that's what they say no that's
[39:56.460 --> 40:02.340]  what they say so again if you don't want to take a black baby and I mean chop it
[40:02.340 --> 40:10.420]  up you are a racist yeah there's the video headline abortionist challenges
[40:10.420 --> 40:14.860]  protesters who adopt ugly black babies not a word from the Democratic Party
[40:14.860 --> 40:21.180]  who founded the Ku Klux Klan because they've got literal morons with
[40:21.180 --> 40:27.860]  extremely IQs extremely low IQs that I shouldn't even attack or be mean to
[40:27.860 --> 40:37.540]  that we should feel sorry for racist I'm an unlexible I'm a trendy just
[40:37.540 --> 40:45.260]  attacking people's free speech you don't want blacks to die you hate blacks you
[40:45.260 --> 40:50.740]  don't want Mexican drug cartel to kill 130,000 Mexicans you racist against
[40:50.740 --> 40:57.700]  Mexicans I mean literally that's all they've got is that they're Democrats and
[40:57.700 --> 41:01.740]  Republicans have got their problems and identify with party as well and defend
[41:01.740 --> 41:05.260]  Republicans when they're doing bad stuff it's disgusting but I've never seen
[41:05.260 --> 41:10.980]  anything like this dumbed-down television culture of nobodies who have no
[41:10.980 --> 41:16.540]  jobs no future Obamacare written by hardcore globalist to bankrupt them on
[41:16.540 --> 41:24.180]  record and they don't care they're just dangerous masses of snot-nosed trolls
[41:24.180 --> 41:28.340]  who ladies and gentlemen you can bet money if they start putting patriots
[41:28.340 --> 41:32.620]  in FEMA camps and they just give people a pretext like some federal buildings
[41:32.620 --> 41:35.700]  being blown up and they say it's time to arrest these people that's already

[41:40.380 --> 41:44.940]  will cheer ladies and gentlemen public executions that is my belief that is my
[41:44.940 --> 41:49.820]  opinion and we have the weathermen reports the people that trained Obama from
[41:49.820 --> 41:54.060]  Larry Graf Walt and others was confirmed in court where they plan to put 50
[41:54.060 --> 42:00.820]  million conservatives in forced labor camps they dream 300 400 pounders you

[47:25.940 --> 47:31.660]  torture and the only reason you heard about that the New York Times was
[47:31.660 --> 47:35.740]  because Carl Rove was so arrogant and the reporters were arrogant and didn't
[47:35.740 --> 47:39.060]  like him at a cocktail party the Washington Post New York Times there's a
[47:39.060 --> 47:43.100]  bunch of them they're going you people are nothing you'll report whatever I say

[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:40.180]  hard labor in prison but they allow you to get on the train if you don't get off
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:44.020]  and the Mexican military sells them meals and things on the way this is
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:48.620]  mainstream news they then arrive in McCallan on the border or they arrive
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:53.940]  by the border in San Diego and they are disgorged this is one of dozens of

[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:25.020]  people and nobody was injured when the train nicknamed the beast came off the
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:31.140]  tracks of spokesman for local emergency services said since last October more
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:37.740]  than 50,000 try about half a million unaccompanied minors oh look Reuters uses
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:41.580]  the White House term the White House said you will use the term unaccompanied
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:48.100]  minors or children and they did you use what and again 2 plus 2 equals 5 and you
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:50.900]  didn't build your business and you can keep your doctor even though you can't
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:56.820]  you do what the Lord the Savior says so I like it you and Jamie Foxx says he's
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:00.340]  Lord and Savior since last October you had a thought Christ came back today
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:03.180]  with all the highway shut down in Austin letting the little people know what
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:08.780]  trash they are since last October more than 50,000 unaccompanied minors most
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:13.020]  from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have been caught illegally crossing
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:17.500]  they've been advertised to come in 99% according to a leaked ICE memo or made
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:21.540]  legal and then they're shipped deeper into the U.S. and air-conditioned buses
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:26.940]  and the word is if you can just get up there on the cargo train and there's so
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:31.100]  many they load the inside areas that are open the open box cards they load the
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:36.740]  top and then they have to hang on to the sides to get in just just so many
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:41.940]  piling on the trains so fast tens of thousands a day dozens of trains a day
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:51.420]  arrive 1300 per train I mean look at some of those photos just hundreds and
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:59.500]  thousands just piling in free welfare voter ID drivers license Valhalla and
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:03.340]  again they're just giant poor desperate ignorant masses that don't know any
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:06.140]  better and I don't even blame them wanting to come here a lot of them
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:11.100]  amputees diabetes you name it they can't be taken care of they're coming
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:15.700]  they're coming they're coming they're coming and this is just the beginning but
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:19.900]  there's also gangs MS-13 mules narcotics traffickers as the border
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:26.300]  completely collapses I mean this just makes my head spin how epic this is
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:31.100]  children say they're fleeing violence at home and hope they will be able to stay
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:34.860]  in the United States several days of heavy rain in southern Mexico may have
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:41.060]  caused the train to derail authority said and AP and Reuters keep acting like
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:45.060]  no one knows why they're illegal or why they're showing up while Obama gives
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:51.220]  them weekly awards and says come on up and Biden says come on up and 99% it
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:16:01.900]  was 80% weren't being deported a few months ago 99% 99% 99 99 99 99 99
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:12.100]  don't they have a song called 99 from the 60s and it just goes on and on I know
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:20.980]  they have a misfit song that goes we all want 38 we all want 38 we are 138 8888
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:26.740]  the point is is that there's 700 plus million people down there the
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:31.020]  population is doubling every 23 years on average and though and it is the
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:35.140]  conquering and the joke is it's true you can say Europeans conquer things and
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:38.820]  built a lot of stuff also engage in atrocities the natives engage in those
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:42.420]  as well I'm not excusing any of this is human activity and now we're this
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:46.860]  civilized trendy culture that are taught you know how to wear unmatching
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:50.980]  socks and have big beards and be trendy all day and just two plus two equals five
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:55.140]  and then now the Democrats are being paid to bring them into their houses it's a
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:17:01.620]  total racket but total implosion and you've got by the way I haven't even
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:06.060]  covered this yet if you look it up George Soros is behind the same open border
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:10.620]  society that overthrew Ukraine is behind this and I need to get our writers if
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:15.100]  you just search George Soros behind immigrant wave he's publicly behind it
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:22.940]  as usual you cannot get rid of him like cockroaches or like the plague or like
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:29.180]  death and taxes George Soros when he was 1415 1617 a to the Nazis in Romanian
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:33.540]  other areas rounding up fellow Jews and gave a 60 minutes interview proud of it
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:38.980]  so he gets 80 L awards my grandfathers that fought the Nazis have been dead for
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:43.180]  a long time one of them for 10 years one of them for more than 20 they're dead in
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:50.020]  the ground and George Soros evergreen has $10 billion plus his tax exempt and is
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:55.420]  just overthrowing funding al-Qaeda groups Arab Springs Nazis overthrowing
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:18:01.060]  Ukraine giant immigrant implosions abortuaries and he wants weed everywhere
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:04.260]  and legalized so everybody's stoned out of their gourd and again I'm against the
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:09.660]  drug war but he's for legalization for the wrong reason and by the way I've
[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:12.500]  figured it out it's not legalization they make you waive your rights for
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:16.220]  medical marijuana and go into the social services and it's even worse than it
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:20.100]  being illegal I mean that they just want to cut of it Soros admits responsibility
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:24.740]  for the coup and mass murder in Ukraine and go read the article he's proud of
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:33.100]  it and of course this human tick this demon this this this this disease this
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:40.380]  walking vampire there it is Soros and failure I said the failure because I'm

[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:31.100]  establishment has decided to tie the corporate globalism to giant immigrant
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:35.740]  movements in the third world that way outnumber what's left in the West as a

[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:46.580]  simple quote Hispanics are having children whites and blacks aren't so
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:53.820]  Hispanics have already basically inherited what's left of the West if they
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:58.420]  want but the globalists don't want that but if you look at things from a racial
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:03.380]  perspective that quote Hispanics have won from the Robert Rodriguez race base
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:07.620]  and so that's why they go with it but they add turn your guns in have
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:13.820]  abortions world government socialism men are bad why would Hispanics want to
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:18.100]  embrace something like that well because it's dumbed down politically like
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:22.500]  everybody else and so it's kosher and acceptable to be racist if you're
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:26.940]  Hispanic and it's sold by the Spanish speaking media so it's perfect that
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:31.300]  other Americans don't know what's going on and the Democrats are going back to
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:36.820]  their Klan policy that they left in the 60s of trying to get whites to be racist
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:40.980]  and be racially based whites rejected it because of Christian movements mainly
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:46.100]  this is real sociology you're hearing the real history and so the Democrats
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:50.820]  then went into race-based politics with minorities and now they've gotten the
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:56.300]  minority level up to majority they go part of being a minority is you don't
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:59.780]  have a man in the house part of being a minority is you turn your guns in part
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:05.980]  of being a minority is your own welfare that's how you beat what the whitey how
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:10.180]  do you beat a whitey if you're black kill your baby so white people go to an
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:13.380]  abortuary say don't kill your black baby people come out and say get out of
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:18.340]  here races and attack them if you want to stick a suction needle in the back of
[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:23.540]  a baby's head and suck its brains out you'll be given literal awards you can

[01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:58.420]  wrong thing I wouldn't be surprised if him and Obama weren't going to the tunnel
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:01.740]  of love and those little paddle swans they have down on the lake down there
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:06.780]  birds of a feather fly together they might have had Michael Obama there as
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:14.380]  well. I'm sorry I can't help it. That's just Obama's illegitimate son is Michael
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:19.900]  Obama from the snapping turtle. Obama there is nothing happening at the border
[01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:25.900]  that I am not intimately aware of. Everything is proceeding as I have
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:32.100]  foreseen it. I need that clip coming back guys what an incredible clip. Everything
[01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:39.220]  is proceeding as I have foreseen. The NSA is spying on everyone we'll launder so
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:44.020]  much money through these illegals you chump Americans I'm a master gangster
[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:50.140]  now take your vaccines drink your fluoride. We're on the march the

[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:03.060]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my
[01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:07.860]  family so much get healthy and detoxify. Most people know that iodine
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:13.220]  deficiency has been a crisis around the world. Iodine is key to so many of the
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:17.660]  body's functions especially the thyroid. I discovered a product being developed by
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:22.860]  Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield true nascent iodine that your
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:26.860]  body can really absorb. Then about a year ago he said listen if you think this is
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:31.860]  powerful I'm going to come out with rare earth deep earth crystals and the
[01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:37.220]  results that I personally have had have been life-changing. Nobody else has got
[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:41.700]  iodine based on these pure crystals ladies and gentlemen. This is innovating
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:46.460]  and the best part is it helps fund info wars.com the radio show the TV show the

[01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:14.500]  filtered through the Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system. That one is better. Tastes like
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:18.060]  nothing. Yep I know a good water tastes like it's good water. Most tap water
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:23.060]  contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate and many others.
[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:26.900]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:31.260]  issues including tooth decay, lower IQ and even cancer. It tastes like you're

[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:50.300]  Drudge has the most incredible photo of the death train known as the
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:58.660]  beef with what looks like 5,000 or more illegals not 1,300 coming into the
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:05.100]  United States and again these death trains arrive people die falling off of
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:10.060]  them and I'm not laughing as they're dying. I'm laughing because this country is
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:14.860]  such a joke. Let me hear Well and Jennings for a minute. It'll make me feel
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:35.380]  better just a touch of sadness and thunder and lightning and we're gonna
[01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:53.340]  ride like the one-eyed jack of diamonds with the devil close behind your phone
[01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:59.100]  calls us enough of me. Let me direct you to infowars.com. Well first let's just
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:02.660]  read those drudge headlines. There's so many more coming out to make up my head
[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:10.740]  spin at this point. Death train derails in Mexico. 1,300 migrants headed towards
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:16.380]  US on one train alone. Photos Obama laughs his way through border meeting.
[01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:24.300]  Perry I don't know if he heard me. Houston black woman goes on epic rant about
[01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:27.740]  illegals. We have that video coming up. It's an awesome video. I'll play that
[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:33.020]  recalls video. African Americans confront immigrant supporters. Amnesty disaster
[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:38.540]  for black workers. It's a disaster for Hispanic workers as well except when you
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:43.620]  get a Spanish speaking assembly line or restaurant or meatpacking when you go
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:47.180]  it's on record. I mean it's taught in colleges now. It's been going on so long.
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:50.820]  Meatpacking restaurants you name it. If you don't speak Spanish you can't work
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:57.700]  there. Well who does that hit? It hits poor whites and poor blacks. And it's just
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:36:03.100]  the way it is folks. So get used to it. And again once America collapses it's
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:07.100]  not going to help Central and South America that is in collapse right now.
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:13.060]  Now I noticed this this morning and Kurt Nemo has documented it now at
[01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:17.700]  infowars.com. We put the petition up at about two o'clock yesterday at the end
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:21.740]  of the show to have the illegals and of course it's a joke petition to point out
[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:26.260]  what a fraud this is. To Democratic Party leaders houses the White House in DC
[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:30.460]  have a Democratic Party with their billions of campaign contributions to
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:35.660]  pay for it. And we've had petitions that have gotten again a half million
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:38.700]  signatures have become national news that the White House have been forced to
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:43.740]  respond to. We've had a bunch of them. We hadn't done one in a while. I get up this
[01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:49.860]  morning about 6.37 I go in. There's one signature. Alex Jones when I set up the
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:55.220]  petition. Biggs did one kind of like it but I wanted to expand on it. So I did
[01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:58.020]  one with Kurt yesterday and he wrote an article about it. I thought man I've
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:02.940]  never seen that before. Usually get signups immediately. It wasn't until
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:09.620]  about an hour ago that they took the block off. So Alex Jones petition
[01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:14.100]  languages on White House website inoperable for more than 12 hours. That's
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:21.140]  a great headline Kirby. You might just say White House blocks illegal alien
[01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:25.900]  petition or something because I mean that's what they did and see they know
[01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:29.900]  they have algorithms. If they block something right when it goes up right
[01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:33.940]  when it goes on Facebook and Twitter then people give up and leave. So even if
[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:38.020]  they game this we have to prove it's totally game with the petitions. This is
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:41.180]  where they act like they're listening to you. Has no effect anyways except it
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:46.940]  publicly is a bully pulpit. Go to info wars.com go into the petition and sign
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:55.620]  it. Go into it and sign the petition that that now has 496 signatures. Does
[01:37:55.620 --> 01:38:03.020]  anyone believe that? Does anyone believe that so info wars.com help us test this
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:08.780]  out? Now before I go to your calls I want to mention a few of the other
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:14.180]  headlines that are on the homepage of prisonplanet.com and infowars.com. Ted
[01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:20.620]  Cruz Democrats vote to ban books repeal First Amendment. That's what they're
[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:25.460]  currently doing. We've got British politicians a secret deal to allow mass
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:28.340]  public surveillance. Yeah that's just like I put microphones up in public
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:30.620]  everywhere. They've been doing it for a long time but now they're just
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:34.420]  announcing it to the slaves. Do I get the apologies now that everything I said
[01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:38.380]  has come true? It didn't come true. It was already there. Don't people understand
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:45.860]  that? Again a very important video I shot yesterday paralleling Obama to Nixon
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:50.500]  and the need for impeachment. Obama must fall. I put out my case that the
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:55.940]  Republicans need to be scared as well. The system needs to be put in check. Well
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:59.260]  if we just let him be a big criminal that'll make the Democrats unpopular. No
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:03.700]  it won't. He'll ship 20 million illegal kids in who are 15 years old. They'll be
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:11.020]  voting with fake IDs. It's game over. Game over man. That's what we're coming
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:16.220]  down to here. And again I warned you about Obamacare and the
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:21.260]  giant screw job that it is. But people don't listen. They're like shut up
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:25.940]  crackerhead. You just don't want people getting some free health care. You race
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:32.540]  this lazy cracker butt. I'm gonna get me some free health care. And yeah they
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:36.460]  just water down Medicare, Medicaid that was already there down to almost nothing.
[01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:40.700]  Do we have the clip of Obama where he said that he's intimately aware of
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:44.260]  everything going on the border? And that's actually true. He's the one that
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:47.260]  basically ordered the whole thing open. Let's go to that clip.
[01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:52.860]  You know Jay Johnson is now visited at my direction the border five times. He's
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:58.700]  going for a sixth this week. To help order the standout. He then comes back and
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:05.100]  reports to me extensively on everything that's taking place. Jay. So there's
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:11.820]  nothing that is taking place down there that I am not intimately aware of and
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:17.740]  briefed on. By the way stop right there. This isn't. When he goes places he changes
[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:23.460]  his accent slightly and that's NLP type weird mumbo jumbo. I don't think it's
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:27.140]  even real at that point. That's like Hillary when she goes to Kentucky.
[01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:35.860]  And then when she literally we can play the clip. When she goes to New York she's
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:41.540]  like how you doing down here? He's good to see you. I talk like Bugs Bunny meets
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:51.340]  the mafia. Hey, what's going real well? Hey, hey, hey, Luigi. I mean that's how
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:56.740]  fake it all is. He might be an Android. In fact, I think he probably is actually a
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:41:01.060]  robot and his wife is actually the Merman from He-Man. I think it's official.
[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:05.860]  I'm being sarcastic ladies and gentlemen. Even though she didn't put on a
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:13.740]  Halloween costume, she is the Merman. I wonder if she wear 6x underwear. 43,000
[01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:17.740]  pairs of 6x underwear. That's how many illegals are going to ship in. They
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:20.980]  think they're going to have tens of thousands of people get the special
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:28.260]  order underwear for probably while the train derailed. They put too many. I'm
[01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:32.460]  sorry folks. Here's the deal. Latin America is collapsing and I'm just
[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:36.300]  laughing because all you idiot yuppies who can't get a job with all your fake
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:43.060]  garbage $300,000, $200,000 degrees that have been a fraud for 20 years. All you
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:46.700]  were taught in college was how to be brainwashed and be a liberal, trendy,
[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:50.700]  mindless fascist who goes around henpecking everyone. You're a joke.
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:55.860]  You're a fraud. You're a failure. You're an idiot. And only admitting that can turn
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:42:02.900]  this around. And we don't have long dumb butt. Okay. I'm talking to all of you out
[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:06.820]  there that think you've arrived because you're part of a surly peer pressure
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:14.220]  gang mentality of snot nose behavior. You people are jokes. You've been promised
[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:19.100]  you'll be the head of the new political class. You're going to be nothing.
[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:24.060]  Anyways, I'm going to go back to your calls here and just I've never have
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:27.060]  gone to the calls. We're going to go to your calls here in just a moment. Ladies
[01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:31.340]  and gentlemen, I'm not going to be depressed about this. Okay. I'm going to
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:34.580]  I tried to put the fire out as Rome burned, but if everybody wants to dance
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:39.740]  around and have fun, then more power to you. But when this sucker goes belly up
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:44.460]  and you've got 101 million people that are on welfare, 70 plus million that
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:49.140]  would starve to death in a matter of weeks without it. Game over man. Game over.
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:55.900]  Game over. It is serious game over. Can we just loop that for everybody? Just
[01:42:55.900 --> 01:43:02.300]  just loop it, please. See, it's game over. We came and played game over here.
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:05.700]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, instead of the loop, I don't even care if it's a loop.
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:08.860]  Just just hit it over and over again. I need to hear game over game over game
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:12.820]  over. In fact, that can be the new American flag game over. And just
[01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:21.300]  everyone's an idiot but thinks they're a winner. Game over, man. Game over. Exactly.
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:31.620]  Game over, man. Game over. I love it. All you fake government people think you're
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:35.620]  invincible. You're nothing but a bunch of delusional narcissists imagining what
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:39.460]  big, powerful winners you are when you're incredible failures and you know
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:43.300]  deep down you're cowardly scum and everything you've got going to be sucked
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:49.060]  out of you by the criminal operation so you cower and fear to it.
[01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:53.140]  All right. Briefly here, ladies and gentlemen, I think I'm going to double
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:56.900]  down today with even more iodide. Now, I suggest you consult with your
[01:43:56.900 --> 01:44:01.620]  physician before you take the recommended daily allowance of the
[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:10.420]  survival shield X2. We still sell the original, very powerful, pure iodine,
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:14.420]  purest out there until X2 came out from the deeper of crystals. Nobody else has
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:18.340]  this. All the other stuff's from seaweed base. And you can go see the videos
[01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:24.580]  at m4warslife.com. And your support of the transmission funds this entire
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:29.060]  operation. Super metal vitality is turning this job of the
[01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:35.140]  creature into a little closer to what I used to look like.
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:38.100]  And it's really helping me out a lot and just amazing. A Dr. Group is really
[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:41.460]  cool doing this formulation for us and it funds the operation.
[01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:44.740]  So if you don't want to run the white flag up, you might want to actually
[01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:47.700]  support us and buy some of the great products but also get some really great
[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:51.060]  products for yourself. So take the challenge. Get the super metal vitality.
[01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:54.500]  Get the survival shield X2 or the original survival shield. Get all the
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:58.020]  other great products at m4warslife.com. Check out the informational videos
[01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:01.300]  there. See the incredible purple crystals for yourself.
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:04.900]  And find out from Dr. Group and others what they do and why this iodine is so
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:07.940]  special. Why iodine is so special period but this iodine
[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:16.740]  is like iodine squared in my view. m4warslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:19.780]  And again we have m4warsstore.com with all the great
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:25.780]  books, videos, films, high quality water filters, discounted with promo code water.
[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:28.820]  All we can do is take control of our own lives, get prepared ourselves,
[01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:32.500]  and wake others up because the whole world's going to go into crazy town
[01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:35.380]  from here on out. And I've been telling you that for years now it's here, the
[01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:38.340]  beginning. So hey, at least we know what's going on.
[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:41.860]  We're informed and we're going to get to see the yuppies beg for mommy,
[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:45.220]  which I don't get pleasure out of except at one level.
[01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:49.940]  Because the trendies and people, you know they've been brainwashed from birth,
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:52.660]  they've gone along with a lot of this and they're not going to be smiling too
[01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:57.140]  much longer, are they? So again m4warslife.com and m4warsstore.com,
[01:45:57.140 --> 01:46:05.540]  888-253-3139. And with the iodine, with the super male,
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:08.900]  we have the super female that's getting even more rave reviews from women.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:11.940]  Women love the super male but the super female,
[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:15.780]  I'll tell you that's good stuff. I haven't been taking it but I've been
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:24.260]  taking super male. I'm not wanting beer anymore either.
[01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:29.220]  I just want to. It's my little cocktail in the evening as well.
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:34.260]  Super male in the morning, super male at the lunch time, super male in the
[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:38.500]  evening. How's that song go? Lovey in the morning,
[01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:42.100]  lovey in the evening, lovey in the something time.
[01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:48.100]  I don't know. It doesn't matter. Who knows, who knows.
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:52.100]  This is the totally unencumbered uninhibited Alex Jones. I apologize.
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:56.020]  Let's go to your phone calls. Eric in Missouri,
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:47:00.020]  Obama is intimately aware of his precious little zombie
[01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:04.180]  children coming up that will be rolled into the new super state.
[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:08.100]  What did you call about today, you evil person?
[01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:13.540]  Alex, everything you just said was so racist. I just can't even believe it.
[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:16.740]  This is an info warrior calling from Missouri with some
[01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:20.180]  troop bombs for the public. Everybody can look up
[01:47:20.180 --> 01:47:26.180]  google.com and google Costco, former CEO. That's all you have to do
[01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:29.300]  and you'll get the backstory to this story. No, no, no. He ordered
[01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:33.300]  Dinesh Kassouza's book off the shelves and I've never even told this story.
[01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:37.220]  I was trying to do a distributorship deal. This is what the Democrats do
[01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:40.500]  about a year ago and I was told in the meeting
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:43.860]  we're never going to put your coffee on our store shelves
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:47.540]  because you've talked about about Costco and I said no, I haven't,
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:51.140]  don't remember doing that, but they said the date
[01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:56.020]  and what I had said about the CEO and the magazine I read from Costco,
[01:47:56.020 --> 01:47:59.620]  the free magazine they give out, about how wonderful Obama is and how
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:03.540]  wonderful socialism is, and literally that's how
[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:06.660]  controlled they are and that's the system they're going to have
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:09.940]  where you don't have a job unless you work for LFA.
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:14.660]  I mean that's pretty scary, isn't it? It sure is. Well, I emailed the current
[01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:18.180]  Costco CEO and I'm not going to name him because he actually replied to me.
[01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:22.980]  I was shocked, but I got their little PR release a few minutes ago
[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:26.260]  and it's basically a big pathetic denial
[01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:29.140]  that they pulled the dice off. We stopped carrying his book
[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:32.580]  because it didn't sell even though it was a bestseller.
[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:36.580]  In the middle of it, it says Costco is not a bookstore.
[01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:42.100]  Our bookshelf space is very limited. We exercise discipline in the best
[01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:44.820]  utilization. We're actually psychopathic black-up
[01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:47.700]  commanders who put cancer viruses in the vaccine
[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:51.620]  and our life extension program for the Alpha Centuries launch is on schedule.
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:57.300]  Oh, excuse me, I'm liberal. Oh, give me everything, are you racist?
[01:48:57.300 --> 01:49:03.540]  No, I'm not. To political candidates or parties,
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:08.660]  left, center, right or other, period. Costco does not have a political ashy
[01:49:08.660 --> 01:49:12.500]  committee. Meanwhile, Alex, the true info warriors,
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:15.460]  the guys with blood pounding through their eyeballs
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:18.580]  when they see this kind of bullcrap, the kind of people that-
[01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:26.100]  Racist, racist, racist, racist, racist, racist, racist. Hold on,
[01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:29.220]  hold on, CJ wants to say something. CJ said he was out there and there was
[01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:32.420]  a giant pyramid of Hillary's book that isn't selling well
[01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:35.700]  called I'm a Bloated Disease Maggot. Go ahead. Yeah, there was no copies of
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:38.580]  America, but Hillary's book was in a big old pile,
[01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:43.700]  as big as Texas untouched. No fingerprints on the covers, nothing.
[01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:48.260]  Oh my gosh, oh my gosh. There's a group of trendies dancing around it
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:52.580]  chanting. You're kidding? No, I'm kidding. Yes.
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:56.580]  Oh, I'm sorry. They were busy buying Albright. Oh my gosh, anything else, Eric?
[01:49:56.580 --> 01:50:01.220]  Yeah, I'll just say this. As soon as I got the email, I just replied,
[01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:06.260]  pathetic. The guy wrote back, oh, thank you. Sorry you felt that way and good luck.
[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:11.860]  I was like, sorry, GI, we just come in peace, lay down and take some shots, drink
[01:50:11.860 --> 01:50:16.740]  some water, feeling better now. The glands are shutting down.
[01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:21.700]  When your pancreatic cancer is going well, we're liberals, we're liberals.
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:26.580]  We're not psychopathic eugenicists or anything.
[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:30.660]  I'm sorry, go ahead and start. I said, hey, forward my email to Jim Senegal,
[01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:34.580]  your former CEO who at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night,
[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:38.660]  the co-founder and former CEO of Costco, plug president Barack Obama's
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:44.420]  investment in the education of informal energy as well as his immigration policies.
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:51.940]  Barack Obama saved me. Barack Obama. Thanks for raising taxes on poor people.
[01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:55.460]  You're so nice. Thanks for breaking all your promises.
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:59.540]  I feel so trendy right now.

[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:38.500]  That's what Obama thinks. He thinks Americans are done and they sure like to act like it.
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:43.860]  Just like I told you, last year in Cyprus, they'd start taking everybody's bank accounts
[01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:50.100]  Europe wide. That's now beginning. Germany and England. The bureaucracy's doing it. They don't
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:55.060]  care what the elected governments do. Black ops squads are standing by. This is a takeover.
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:59.940]  George Soros is right up there at the top laughing the whole time. And now they're going to collapse
[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:04.580]  the whole Southwest and bring us into depression and poses the saviors over that because they don't
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:09.300]  care. And Obama doesn't care about being popular. He cares about getting his job done. We're going
[01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:15.540]  to your calls, but here's an article that was up on drudgereport.com. It's from infowars.com.
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:20.500]  Texas town no quarter for illegals. They've passed a law saying they're not going to store them in
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:24.500]  government buildings there. Well, the Justice Department says that's not allowed. You will
[01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:29.060]  house them with your local tax money and then the feds will give them the free welfare and the voting
[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:35.620]  cards. But here's one of the videos with Houston residents freaking out about what's happening
[01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:42.500]  because Houston's probably already about 50% illegal, 20% Hispanic, 30% black, 10% white or
[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:48.900]  something. I don't know. 110%. I don't know. Let's go ahead and something like that. But let's go
[01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:54.260]  ahead and go to this clip. These illegal immigrants don't have nowhere to go. So y'all going to come
[01:55:54.260 --> 01:56:00.100]  over here to our neighborhood, open the school up for them. Really? Is that right? No, wait a minute.
[01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:04.500]  Anybody think that's right? To say Bernadette Lancelin is angry would be an understatement.
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:09.220]  She's blocked though. She can't. That the parents are impossible conditions or
[01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:13.220]  surroundings or whatever's going on out there. I don't care. I don't care about what's going on
[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:18.260]  right here in my own backyard, my neighborhood. Lancelin says she's raised three children and
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:22.420]  six grandchildren in the Trinity Garden neighborhood around Terrell Middle School. She made her
[01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:26.820]  feelings known as officials from FEMA Health and Human Services and the General Services
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:32.260]  Administration toured the building to determine whether it could be used as a temporary shelter
[01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:36.580]  for unaccompanied Central American children. Then they're borrowing money to open it up.
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:41.620]  Money that could be given to that school. That's enough. That's enough. I said I got calls.
[01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:46.180]  It's not fair. It's not right. Full video on infowords.com. It's also on drudgerport.com.
[01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:49.780]  There's a bunch of videos. Listen, here's the deal lady. You paved your tax money for that school
[01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:55.620]  in years. It's the North American Union's conference. What's going to keep them from escaping here
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:59.060]  and just moving around? They're going to be released, lady. You didn't know that? What's
[01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:03.060]  going to keep them behind these gates? Security really? They can't even control the border.
[01:57:03.060 --> 01:57:09.620]  Spoken like a true terrorist and a racist. You say two plus two equals four. You're a terrorist.
[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:16.980]  But there you go, ladies and gentlemen. This is the total joke. And notice the reporter calls them
[01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:23.380]  unaccompanied children. Obama says you will now call them unaccompanied children. Everyone goes
[01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:30.260]  and salutes. Yes, sir. I mean, you will not use the word bossy. I will not use the word bossy.
[01:57:30.260 --> 01:57:34.260]  I mean, this is a total joke.
[01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:40.260]  Derek in Ohio, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:57:42.260 --> 01:57:50.500]  Hello? Yes, sir. Go ahead. Yes, I find it outrageous that abortion is somehow
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:56.900]  accepted as women's rights. And yet people who choose to home birth
[01:57:56.900 --> 01:58:04.500]  are condemned and the risk of CPS investigating them. Well, because they don't want the kid born,
[01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:07.300]  but then if it's born, they want to take it away and get it in the hands of the state.
[01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:13.060]  I mean, period. Good parents are the number one target of CPS on record. Right. I mean,
[01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:16.180]  I see stories all the time where they know a kid's not getting fed dying and they leave them there
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:20.580]  to die. But if it's a good Christian family, SWAT teams are coming. Anything else, sir? Go ahead.
[01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:28.020]  You've been holding. Um, no, just just really witnessing this moral decline in this country
[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:33.060]  where people don't so many people don't stand for anything. And the people stay there. I'm
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:36.500]  going to come back to you in one minute. You're absolutely right. More calls coming up the next
[01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:42.020]  hour. It's more than moral decline. The people are jellyfish. They repeat what the national
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:47.940]  TV says. The local news repeats it. I mean, they have a saying two plus three equals five. This is
[01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:56.180]  a cult. Alex Jones here for info wars.com. In the month of July, we have got giant specials on

[01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:22.180]  This is more than a summer blowout special. This is a new declaration of independence. But to expand

[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:58.020]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[01:59:58.020 --> 02:00:14.420]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's
[02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:22.180]  Alex Jones on the GCM radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas. Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:29.540]  You know, I get really bummed out sometimes watching free society torn to pieces, watching
[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:37.140]  criminality grow. Other times I get real cynical and sarcastic. I think about the morons that support
[02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:42.340]  all this corruption. They have no idea what they're doing. But the technocrats on top do going back
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:49.300]  to Derek and Ohio. Yeah, Derek, I mean, it is a moral decline. And the big thing is the churches
[02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:55.140]  for 50 years have been state run. The big churches, the glitterbug churches, the CIA with the name
[02:00:55.140 --> 02:01:00.820]  it and claim it fake right wing churches out of Texas that went nationwide in the 70s and 80s.
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:06.020]  She's this prosperity message. They break up families. You name it. They're actually
[02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:09.860]  psi off officers. A lot of them. That's actually come out in the news before.
[02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:15.860]  But a lot of these big preachers in San Antonio and Houston are actually on the government payroll.
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:19.620]  And the people didn't know that you just start changing clergy response teams. We broke it,
[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:25.060]  but there's actually newscast and it was declassified seven years ago. In fact,
[02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:29.460]  not a lot of them, almost all of them are. And they get off on power trips. They go to meetings.
[02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:34.900]  They have ranks. They salute. The lower levels don't. They're just auxiliary spies.
[02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:40.900]  And they're bringing the country down. And that's why the Republicans won't do anything
[02:01:40.900 --> 02:01:44.900]  about the open border because they're part of it as well. There's a rebellion by the Tea Party
[02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:50.580]  to try to fix it. But that's why they're going to just death con one and just lower in the border
[02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:56.100]  completely, putting out the call as dozens of trains a day with thousands arrive. And they're
[02:01:56.100 --> 02:02:00.260]  going to bring them to every town and then create a whole crisis out of that and then exploit those
[02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:05.060]  people as well. So the poor people being brought in from the collapse regimes are in the same boat
[02:02:05.060 --> 02:02:08.180]  as those of us here, but it doesn't matter. They're still being used as a weapon.
[02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:13.540]  It'd be kind of like in the civil war, you know, you might be fighting your brother across the
[02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:19.060]  line. Still, they're being ordered and commanded to do things that will bring the country down.
[02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:23.620]  They are being politically programmed to vote to end the family in the Second Amendment in
[02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:28.100]  private property. It's here. They're going to take over. And they're going to blow stuff up
[02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:31.060]  and blame it on the Tea Party and come after us. I mean, that's what they're going to do.
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:36.660]  Now, we've got the boldness to know the enemy's plan. And it's so epic
[02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:40.020]  that we're aware of the enemy's operation of accurately predicted their next moves.
[02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:45.700]  And now we could stop them. But people every day, I see me on the street and they say,
[02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:49.300]  thank you. We're glad you're there for us. Listen, brother, I'm here for me.
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:53.860]  If you're going to be free, I'm going to be free. Everything's connected.
[02:02:54.820 --> 02:03:00.980]  And I'm doing this for the future and for justice. And because I have fight and flight.
[02:03:02.020 --> 02:03:06.980]  And I never really run. I'm not very good at running. I just tend to always go into fight.
[02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:12.660]  And so I'm doing it for you, too. But buddy, I'm doing it for all of us. And I need you to get
[02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:16.260]  involved as well. I don't care what it is. You better just get moving.
[02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:23.300]  I mean, it's that simple. This is a takeover. And the globalist are organized. They got our
[02:03:23.300 --> 02:03:33.140]  tax money and they've got their commanders in place. I mean, Rod Riggs is so arrogant on and off
[02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:37.620]  the air where he admits he works for the government and will, you know, put out propaganda to open
[02:03:37.620 --> 02:03:41.780]  the borders and stuff. He's probably got a rank as well. I mean, they're trying to hire all the
[02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:46.740]  dentists. I know through my dad to be in Homeland Security and spy on people and not for terrorism.
[02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:51.140]  I mean, this is a takeover, folks. This is North Korea. Derek, would you like to say
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:52.980]  anything about that? Or you got anything else you'd like to comment on?
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:59.140]  Well, I'd like to say that my wife and I are having our first baby and we're still so blessed.
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:05.220]  And we realize that there's nothing more important in our lives right now. And I realize my time
[02:04:05.220 --> 02:04:12.180]  here is only that. It's not forever. And we're only thinking of our children and our children's
[02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:16.740]  future and what kind of world that they're going to be brought up in and what's actually going to
[02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:25.140]  happen. This is just so crucial. And to see so many people that they're not interested,
[02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:29.220]  young people, they're not interested in having families. They're not interested in having children.
[02:04:29.220 --> 02:04:36.020]  They just want to stay children themselves forever, it seems. I'm not trying to generalize all people,
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:43.380]  of course, but it's really something that I notice. And God just help us all.
[02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:53.700]  Well said, sir. Very, very well said. And just stick together. I mean, they're trying to ban
[02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:58.500]  homeschooling in a whole bunch of states, saying you'll get a CPS visit even. I mean, it's just
[02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:04.100]  incredible. Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she
[02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:09.300]  goes to sleep. I could take her on romantic dates. I get her flowers. You name it. She's just not the
[02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:15.300]  woman I married. Oh, Ralph, that's just awful. Does this seem familiar? Are the honeymoon days
[02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:21.220]  of your relationship long gone? If so, consider this, the abundance of chemical additives,

[02:06:24.660 --> 02:06:29.540]  mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions. And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans
[02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:33.460]  live with pets they're allergic to as well. When I began to research these statistics,
[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:39.220]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment

[02:06:59.860 --> 02:07:04.980]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered city of Austin tap water. I didn't taste dirt in it.
[02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:09.780]  God knows what's in this. These people just sampled city of Austin tap water straight from
[02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:15.940]  the faucet. Next we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a Cropure G2.0 filtration
[02:07:15.940 --> 02:07:20.500]  system. Now when it is better. Tastes like nothing. Yep I know what good water tastes like. It's good
[02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:26.740]  water. Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate and many others.
[02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:31.300]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues including
[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:35.780]  tooth decay, lower IQ and even cancer. It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're
[02:07:35.780 --> 02:07:42.180]  drinking tap water. The Cropure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances leaving
[02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:46.980]  only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water. Okay this is very tasty. It's good water.

[02:08:04.980 --> 02:08:07.220]  Ladies and gentlemen it's worse than I thought.
[02:08:07.220 --> 02:08:14.260]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:30.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, Karma Geddon was supposed to happen out in LA a few years ago when they
[02:08:30.500 --> 02:08:36.020]  shut down one of the major highways for half a day to fix a bridge. No ladies and gentlemen,
[02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:45.700]  Karma Geddon didn't happen in LA. It's happened here in Austin. Obama has been here since
[02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:51.700]  yesterday and there has been non-stop traffic. I-35 Northbound, Southbound blocked. Southbound
[02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:57.460]  this morning. Northbound now. We had a guest that was going to be coming into studio and then a
[02:08:57.460 --> 02:09:02.820]  landline and can't even probably come on air because they can't get out of downtown because
[02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:10.900]  Obama was there this morning. The entire city is basically paralyzed with 20 miles of traffic
[02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:17.300]  backed up. We have a local news report here where he's out in Mainer from about an hour ago
[02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:25.140]  with it backed up 20 miles into Austin. And by the way, this is right out by our office. We
[02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:33.540]  got to go shoot video with this. 20 miles of the traffic not moving. Yeah, Alex, the b-roll that
[02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:41.140]  we're showing is traffic heading out of Austin towards Mainer, a suburb that is nowhere near
[02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:46.260]  our metropolitan area as far as any of his planned visits. And look, the cops are all over. I saw
[02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:51.540]  this morning, he'd already left town. They were just randomly blocking mixed masters and highways
[02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:58.020]  just as some act of power. And that's what all of this is. It's just a total domination of the
[02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:04.340]  American people. Let's play the audio from some of that newscast. And then I shot some video on
[02:10:04.340 --> 02:10:10.740]  my iPhone this morning of the traffic cams that they have where it just showed nothing moving on
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:21.140]  I-35 at 8 a.m. through 9.30 Southbound with them just blocking waiting for him. And then when he
[02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:28.900]  goes through, like he's God, well, he goes around fundraising. And again, it gets worse and worse
[02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:32.020]  and worse, but he won't go to the border. Let's go ahead and go to that report.
[02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:38.340]  Welcome back to KXAN News at noon. We are taking a live picture of State Highway 71
[02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:44.420]  and the Tollway 130 and the traffic back up there is a parking lot just outside of the
[02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:50.420]  airport near the Del Valley area. We assume this is the direction of the presidential
[02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:53.940]  motorcade presidential. And again, we've got a bunch of these videos. We've got new ones. We've
[02:10:53.940 --> 02:11:00.020]  got ones from when he was here a year ago, ladies and gentlemen. But again, I want to show the ones
[02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:09.700]  that I shot on my iPhone today. And again, we actually have video of that. And again, they
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:20.980]  literally shut down the highways to do this. Okay, let's go ahead now and go to Joe Biggs
[02:11:20.980 --> 02:11:27.700]  reporting from Marietta, Southern California with Kit Daniels on what transpired last night. He got
[02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:34.580]  an interview. The video is up on infowars.com with the hundreds of quote socialists that arrived
[02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:43.220]  demanding open borders. And again, we finally did get some shots up there showing the completely
[02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:51.940]  open highway for hours so that Obama could drive down. And again, even after he was gone,
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:12:01.060]  even after he had left and wasn't even in the city anymore, they still just kept it shut
[02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:06.100]  an hour later when I drove to work. I think they should permanently just close the road
[02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:10.660]  because he drove on it. I'm serious. Like they used to take the wives of Viking kings
[02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:16.340]  and their children and burn them on a ship with his body. Why not blow the whole earth up
[02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:23.060]  just to honor Obama? I'm serious. How about some child's sacrifice, like line the road with
[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:26.820]  aborted babies? And that's what they're into anyways. I guess they already heat hospitals
[02:12:26.820 --> 02:12:32.900]  with dead babies' bodies and Pepsi's baby flavored. Why not? See, the maximum satire I can come up with,
[02:12:34.020 --> 02:12:39.460]  they're involved in. And they have democratic party websites make fun of me for saying Caligula
[02:12:39.460 --> 02:12:45.540]  married his horse and the elites become corrupt and decadent, knowing how ignorant their audience
[02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:51.700]  is, preying on the pseudo fake bloated intellectuals who have five degrees and can't get jobs and
[02:12:51.700 --> 02:13:02.980]  are total failures and love it. Okay, let's go ahead and go to Joe Biggs. I'm in a crazed mood
[02:13:02.980 --> 02:13:07.380]  today, folks, because I'm just so sick of it all trying to control myself here, trying to have
[02:13:07.380 --> 02:13:12.420]  gallows humor here as we watch the country hung until dead by the neck, hung by the neck until
[02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:18.740]  dead or flayed or lied or drawn and quartered. I've had enough. I tell you, it's having Obama
[02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:24.100]  and the globalist here in the city celebrating their destruction of Texas and America makes
[02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:29.140]  you want to throw up. Joe Biggs reporting from Southern California. What do you got for us?
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:33.860]  All right, I'm Joe Biggs here at Marietta, California in front of the Border Patrol station.
[02:13:33.860 --> 02:13:39.140]  We're just seconds ago, federal agents are flying overhead in the helicopter just watching these
[02:13:39.140 --> 02:13:43.780]  peaceful protesters. You know, they're circling around trying to hassle us. Meanwhile, behind me
[02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:49.060]  over this way, Border Patrol agents have been coming up to everybody that steps outside of the
[02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:52.980]  free speech zones, and they kind of pushed them back in their place and make sure that they stay
[02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:57.700]  over there. You know, this is complete tyranny at its best right now. You know, they've given us
[02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:02.180]  a small area to stand in and if you try to step outside of that, they threaten you to call the
[02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:08.820]  cops and all that. What I saw last night was very interesting though, pro-amnesty supporters
[02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:14.900]  calling themselves a freedom socialist party, you know, supporting Obama's socialist agenda.
[02:14:18.020 --> 02:14:25.060]  Let's talk about the socialist Joe Biggs that you got to interview with. Let's talk about that.
[02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:29.860]  Yeah, they were all about leaving the borders completely open when I asked the lady,
[02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:35.780]  should we have borders? She said no. It should just be one North American content completely. We
[02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:40.260]  should just let everybody roam freely through and do whatever they want. And then I asked her.
[02:14:40.260 --> 02:14:45.380]  Sure, Joe, we're going to have to abort this interview for a minute here because somebody's
[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:51.700]  got a radio on or somebody's got another mic open there. And so we'll move to another spot.
[02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:55.700]  And then when we come back from break, you can. We're about to get kicked off right now. This
[02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:59.540]  is going live. Okay, good. Well, let's talk to them then. Okay, well, let's go ahead. Oh, yeah,
[02:14:59.540 --> 02:15:05.860]  evil reporter terrorists aren't allowed to be in America, I guess. Look at them. Yes. Well,
[02:15:05.860 --> 02:15:10.420]  if you were an illegal alien, you'd be fine. Go over and talk to them. Do you want to come over?
[02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:15.940]  Go talk to them. Well, we'll talk now. That's fine. If you don't mind.
[02:15:18.020 --> 02:15:21.460]  I'm Joe Biggs with n4wars.com. How are you doing? What's the problem?
[02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:24.900]  I don't think there is a problem. Oh, I didn't know if there was something new.
[02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:29.860]  Did the war patrol agents mention anything about going inside these cones to you?
[02:15:29.860 --> 02:15:34.740]  Yesterday, the police came by someone from your police department and said that this was a public
[02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:39.300]  road and we could actually be over here. Actually have that on tape. Well, I'm asking you that
[02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:43.540]  because the border patrol agents mentioned it to me that they don't want you behind these cones.
[02:15:43.540 --> 02:15:49.140]  I wasn't here yesterday. So why are they allowed to be over this way? That's why I was saying,
[02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:54.420]  does Fox News pay them or something? I don't know. Let me talk to the war patrol guy because
[02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:57.780]  obviously there's two. Well, Fox has got to be paying them or something if they can be over here
[02:15:57.780 --> 02:16:01.940]  because they're mainstream media and we can't be over there reporting for Americans. Look,
[02:16:02.980 --> 02:16:08.340]  yeah, but I'm saying. No, exactly. Fox News is allowed to be there, but the cop came over to
[02:16:08.340 --> 02:16:16.500]  try to run the enemy, you know, the independent press off. And again, Joe, we're getting another
[02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:22.180]  audio feed from you. It's not even background people talking. And they told me yesterday,
[02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:26.580]  too, if I have a press pass, I could be over here. Well, I mean, that's how this works. It's
[02:16:26.580 --> 02:16:32.660]  whatever they say. So we're going to bust any legals, chip them in. We expose it. Nobody gets
[02:16:32.660 --> 02:16:37.380]  in trouble. We're going to fund Al Qaeda. We're going to ship narcotics in. We're going to launder
[02:16:37.380 --> 02:16:41.540]  drug money. We're going to buy armored vehicles. We're going to spy on you illegally. We're going
[02:16:41.540 --> 02:16:46.100]  to put microphones up all over the three corners and listen to you. We're going to take your money.
[02:16:46.100 --> 02:16:50.420]  We're going to bankrupt the country. We're going to ban your light bulbs. We say your kids belong
[02:16:50.420 --> 02:16:55.220]  to us. We say you didn't build your business. We say Obamacare will lower your costs, even though
[02:16:55.220 --> 02:17:00.500]  it doubles it or triples it. It's just a total system that's out of control. And if they could
[02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:04.980]  get the cops to put us all in FEMA camps, they would. The average cop's not even that bad.
[02:17:04.980 --> 02:17:10.900]  But again, Joe, we're getting a double feed here. But that happens sometimes with lights.
[02:17:10.900 --> 02:17:15.700]  It's not, it's not coming from there. We have an internal mic set on. Yep.
[02:17:16.580 --> 02:17:17.940]  We'll walk somewhere else and call you back.
[02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:21.540]  I'm telling you this right now. I personally spoke to them.
[02:17:21.540 --> 02:17:22.100]  Hello?
[02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:28.660]  Somebody else's mic is going into yours, but you're not going wireless, are you?
[02:17:28.660 --> 02:17:29.620]  It should be retaliated.
[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:31.220]  Yes, I'm wireless.
[02:17:31.220 --> 02:17:38.660]  Yeah, we always go with a cord. Number one rule is that we have a cord wireless always does this.
[02:17:38.660 --> 02:17:43.220]  It's a default position. But I know you guys are new. You're doing a great job. We're going to go
[02:17:43.220 --> 02:17:49.860]  to cord and then come back to you during the next break. This is total transparency.
[02:17:49.860 --> 02:17:54.660]  It's measure control. I'm directing it. It's a whole deal. I'm here in the audio.
[02:17:54.660 --> 02:18:00.420]  I'm having to figure out what's going on. And so we'll figure that out and go to a corded mic.
[02:18:01.540 --> 02:18:06.900]  Corded mic. We ran into this down at the border last time in Texas.
[02:18:06.900 --> 02:18:15.220]  But again, I could tell that was another broadcast. But what it was was Fox or somebody had them on
[02:18:15.220 --> 02:18:21.620]  in a channel. Plus they can jam those really easy. So I tell you, boy, there is no talk radio like
[02:18:21.620 --> 02:18:28.820]  this by any stretch the imagination. I can tell you right now. Also, I'll just talk about it during
[02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:35.220]  the break. Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com. I would have loved for all you to really be able to hear
[02:18:35.220 --> 02:18:40.580]  what happened there with the cop. But we'll try to go back and talk to them again and see what's
[02:18:40.580 --> 02:18:45.300]  going on and see what's finding out and find out what we can. But basically they were like,
[02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:49.700]  you need to go ahead and move out of this area. But the corporate prostitutes could be there.
[02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:55.140]  At least Fox News is there reporting on what's going on, period. But again, we have the socialist
[02:18:55.140 --> 02:19:02.500]  video that is just absolutely essential up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:06.740]  We're going to go to break and see if we can get audio with Joe Biggs down there. If not,
[02:19:06.740 --> 02:19:12.340]  just have him go HD, shoot video, follow report that way. And then we'll go to Oz,
[02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:19.140]  Ron, Tom, Stacy and Lewis. In fact, in order, we'll go to Oz, then we'll go to Ron,
[02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:24.660]  then we'll go to Stacy, Lewis and Tom. And we will get to your calls. And again,
[02:19:24.660 --> 02:19:30.900]  this is dynamic real radio. Some days it's a train wreck because it's real. I don't like the
[02:19:30.900 --> 02:19:36.980]  train wreck yesterday evening, coming up with 1300 look more like 5000 the photos I saw.
[02:19:37.540 --> 02:19:42.980]  Illegals, men, women, children, you name it, that we're not allowed to even call immigrants
[02:19:42.980 --> 02:19:47.780]  now or migrants. First, you first don't call them illegal aliens, then call them immigrants
[02:19:47.780 --> 02:19:52.420]  or migrants. And no, no, no, no, they're all children. They can be a 55 year old, three-time
[02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:57.380]  murderer, convicted child molester. You call them unaccompanied children and the mainstream
[02:19:57.380 --> 02:20:03.140]  media jumps when they say do it. This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?

[02:23:03.140 --> 02:23:09.140]  have to tell you. This economy sucks. Unlike the political elite and Wall Street bankers,
[02:23:09.140 --> 02:23:15.140]  you know that debts don't disappear and bailouts have big consequences. Stock and real estate
[02:23:15.140 --> 02:23:20.900]  market bubbles can pop at any moment and evaporate most or all of your retirement savings.
[02:23:20.900 --> 02:23:25.380]  Folks, we're in the weakest economy of our lifetime and it's likely to get much worse.
[02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:31.700]  Virtually zero sectors of the economy are hiring and workforce participation is at record lows.
[02:23:31.700 --> 02:23:35.860]  And I'm here to tell you this may be the best thing that could happen to you. If you move
[02:23:35.860 --> 02:23:41.060]  decidedly and develop a backup plan immediately, proportionately more millionaires were created
[02:23:41.060 --> 02:23:46.580]  during the Great Depression than at any time in history. And history is about to repeat itself.

[02:24:16.580 --> 02:24:31.060]  All right, folks. That was deliberate jamming of our wireless signal. That's why I don't
[02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:35.860]  like using wireless out of those events because they can get messed up. People can dial into them.
[02:24:35.860 --> 02:24:39.780]  So we're going to get them hooked up with wires and I'll go back to them coming up.
[02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:46.820]  Right now, let's go to Oz in Georgia. Oz, you're on the air. Thanks for calling in. Go ahead.
[02:24:46.820 --> 02:24:50.980]  How are you, Alex? This is the red alert with your permission. I'd like to say a few words.
[02:24:51.700 --> 02:24:54.900]  Yeah, you're on the air. We don't really screen calls. You're on the air right now.
[02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:59.620]  All right. Thank you. Okay. Well, the first thing I want to speak about is
[02:25:01.380 --> 02:25:05.620]  when the National Susan said that Obama was really vindictive, he was not lying.
[02:25:05.620 --> 02:25:12.180]  Obama is someone that if you were to do something to him, he's going to do it to you tenfold.
[02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:18.420]  Now, I want to speak about the six American Islamist activists who work with the Obama
[02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:24.420]  administration that are Muslim Brotherhood operatives who enjoy strong influence over US policy.
[02:25:26.260 --> 02:25:30.500]  That is what I want to speak about today. Brother, listen. This is a phenomenon with
[02:25:30.500 --> 02:25:37.460]  the callers where everybody always says what they want to speak about. You're on air now. So I'm
[02:25:37.460 --> 02:25:43.300]  not screening your call. We're live right now. Okay, then I want to know why nobody is doing
[02:25:43.300 --> 02:25:51.300]  anything about this. One of their main compounds is in Houston, Texas, and it is home to Hamas,
[02:25:51.300 --> 02:25:55.780]  the Muslim Brotherhood in Al Qaeda. No, no, that's true. They've got bases in California,
[02:25:55.780 --> 02:26:01.060]  Alabama, because the government runs Al Qaeda. It's all a joke. It's all a scam.
[02:26:03.140 --> 02:26:10.100]  Well, exactly. But we have these people, like Muhammad Ali Biari, who changed their accent up
[02:26:10.100 --> 02:26:15.540]  and sound just like a person from Houston, Texas or from the South. And I think this is the same
[02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:21.140]  thing that we see with Obama, where he's trying to change his accents to sound more Southern,
[02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:25.380]  more American. I mean, he already has the cut out family, cut out wife.
[02:26:26.900 --> 02:26:30.820]  No, I hear you. I hear you're making really great points. And again, I mean, they're turning the
[02:26:30.820 --> 02:26:36.020]  whole Middle East and Africa over to the most radical, vicious extremists you can imagine,
[02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:40.740]  ISIS and Al Qaeda. And then acting like they've got to take our rights away because it's happening.
[02:26:40.740 --> 02:26:43.140]  It gets me so angry, I can hardly even do a radio show.
[02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:46.580]  Alex, would you mind if I say one more thing? Yeah, go ahead.
[02:26:46.580 --> 02:26:53.300]  Okay, I don't really need to say this. It seems like it's imaginary. It seems like it was made
[02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:59.700]  up by the CIA, FBI. But the thing that's going on here is that a lot of the CIA, FBI, NSA,
[02:26:59.700 --> 02:27:05.060]  all these federal agencies, they're converting to Islam. So not only are they hiring people
[02:27:05.060 --> 02:27:14.340]  from Hamas, people from these extremist groups. And I can tell you who's doing this. Janet and
[02:27:14.340 --> 02:27:19.220]  the politicians, those hiring all these people, Obama, Obama is hiring all these people. And now
[02:27:19.220 --> 02:27:26.740]  they are enjoying, they are enjoying influence over US policy. Well, you know, I used to always
[02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:31.140]  hear that he was a secret Muslim and all that. And he went to Cairo and he spoke better Arabic,
[02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:35.620]  they said than most imams. And I don't just sit there and hate Muslims. And just because they're
[02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:40.900]  Muslims, there are super radical sects of it. And the globalists are the ones behind those,
[02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:45.140]  protecting them, arming them. And he gave them the missiles, he gave them the weapons, he let
[02:27:45.140 --> 02:27:49.700]  them attack all these countries. They tried to overthrow our ally, Egypt, and put the Muslim
[02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:54.340]  Brotherhood in al-Qaeda in charge. And our media called them protesters and they were launching
[02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:59.700]  rockets at police stations and attacked the Egyptian military when they crushed them.
[02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:08.340]  And then his brother is a Muslim, excuse me, his cousin, Odinga. And Odinga got caught
[02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:14.500]  shipping all this money up to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. And it's just a bunch of criminal groups
[02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:20.420]  and special interests. And it's true that there is a radical Islamic special interest group
[02:28:21.060 --> 02:28:26.500]  working with the Democratic Party. And the Democrats, look what they're doing with
[02:28:26.500 --> 02:28:32.980]  La Raza and Meshish, just any group they can to leverage a takeover. They'll work with al-Qaeda,
[02:28:32.980 --> 02:28:39.380]  they'll work with big corporations and the Republicans do it too. This is just a criminal
[02:28:39.380 --> 02:28:46.260]  takeover. Napoleon converted to Islam for a while and got a bunch of the folks to work with him.
[02:28:46.260 --> 02:28:54.820]  I mean, this has happened before and man, I just can't believe it. I mean, I have reached a point
[02:28:54.820 --> 02:29:00.500]  that this is so serious, I try to not get angry on air. So I try to be more cynical and make
[02:29:00.500 --> 02:29:11.220]  jokes out of this because it's either that or cry. I mean, it's just, it's crazy. It's crazy
[02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:18.100]  to then see Secret Service when Obama's not even anywhere around just driving around bugging
[02:29:18.100 --> 02:29:24.340]  their eyes out at people in Austin and acting rude to people because that's their job. Make
[02:29:24.340 --> 02:29:30.980]  us feel small, grab our genitals at the airport, treat us bad, tell us we're the terrorist. I mean,
[02:29:30.980 --> 02:29:37.220]  they say Homeland Security is for gun owners, returning veterans, libertarians, conservatives.
[02:29:39.060 --> 02:29:43.380]  And they mean it. I mean, they're coming after us. If you're al-Qaeda, you're okay.
[02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:48.580]  If you have no job and you're from South America, come on in. You're a big banker,
[02:29:48.580 --> 02:29:52.580]  you're tax exempt. We're on the march. We'll see if our guys got the audio fix, doing a great job
[02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:56.020]  down on the border. Alex Jones. Stay with us. And the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:57.460 --> 02:32:03.940]  dead ants. I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[02:32:03.940 --> 02:32:10.260]  much get healthy and detoxify. Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around
[02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:16.820]  the world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered
[02:32:16.820 --> 02:32:22.900]  a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine
[02:32:22.900 --> 02:32:27.140]  that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is
[02:32:27.140 --> 02:32:32.980]  powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals. And the results that I
[02:32:32.980 --> 02:32:39.700]  personally have had have been life changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure
[02:32:39.700 --> 02:32:45.220]  crystals, ladies and gentlemen. This is innovating. And the best part is it helps fund infowars.com,
[02:32:45.220 --> 02:32:49.620]  the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:55.060]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2. Take advantage of this
[02:32:55.060 --> 02:33:11.380]  unprecedented 30% off super detox special at infowarslife.com. Resistance to
[02:33:11.380 --> 02:33:20.260]  tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones. The video is not that good for radio,
[02:33:20.260 --> 02:33:26.420]  but it's very powerful. If you see the video, it's in the featured news section of infowars.com.
[02:33:26.980 --> 02:33:32.900]  Pro amnesty socialists flood Marietta City Hall. Amnesty activists hold signs stating,
[02:33:33.460 --> 02:33:37.860]  open the borders, freedom, socialist party and immigrants welcome here.
[02:33:39.140 --> 02:33:44.500]  Again, to be voters to bring in pure socialism, aka cloward and piven, and they admit that on
[02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:50.500]  tape. So great job to Kit Daniels and staff sergeant Joe Biggs down there on the border in
[02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:56.740]  Marietta and they're coming back today or I guess in the morning and they've got a lot of HD footage
[02:33:56.740 --> 02:34:00.980]  that's now up on infowars.com. They're able to get more of it filed by the nightly news seven
[02:34:00.980 --> 02:34:08.100]  o'clock each night. And again, I thought it was just a wireless chatter over the deal, but it was
[02:34:08.100 --> 02:34:15.220]  an actual broadcasting over the channel we were on out there in Marietta. So we've got them with
[02:34:15.220 --> 02:34:20.420]  a wired in mic now. There's a lot of bullhorning going on. The police are there, but Joe, I couldn't
[02:34:20.420 --> 02:34:25.860]  make it all out when you were talking to the senior police officer. Was that a Marietta police
[02:34:25.860 --> 02:34:31.300]  officer or a county sheriff? And it sounded to me like he said, get out of there. But you said,
[02:34:31.300 --> 02:34:38.660]  hey, you know, you've got Fox News right there. What are you saying? Roger that. It was a Marietta
[02:34:38.660 --> 02:34:42.820]  police department officer and he came over and said, no, you can't be over here. You're standing
[02:34:42.820 --> 02:34:47.940]  on the wrong side of the cones. The border patrol asked you to leave, but standing right behind me
[02:34:47.940 --> 02:34:52.740]  is Fox News. I said, well, if Fox News can be over there, the mainstream media, the ones who don't
[02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:57.060]  even tell the truth, why can they be over there? They must be paying off the border patrol. They
[02:34:57.060 --> 02:35:01.860]  must be paying off the police. I mean, just seconds ago after I was told I couldn't be here,
[02:35:02.740 --> 02:35:07.140]  a Fox News cameraman was standing right over here outside of the cone area where I was just
[02:35:07.140 --> 02:35:11.300]  told I could not be and the border patrol didn't even go over and say anything to him. That's what's
[02:35:11.300 --> 02:35:15.540]  going on. This is tyranny at its best. Well, it's no longer the border patrol or ICE or Homeland
[02:35:15.540 --> 02:35:21.540]  Security. It's the Department of Illegal Alien Importation. And I'm seeing the photos and videos
[02:35:21.540 --> 02:35:27.300]  of these trains. Most of these are adult men. These are not children, but the media says you will
[02:35:27.300 --> 02:35:33.780]  call them unaccompanied children. And then all the prostitute media that works with the government
[02:35:33.780 --> 02:35:38.900]  who's allowed to be there, but we aren't, they all dutifully do whatever the globalists tell
[02:35:38.900 --> 02:35:43.780]  them to do. This is just amazing, Joe. Yeah, it's crazy. And last night, though, too, you know, with
[02:35:43.780 --> 02:35:48.900]  the whole, the pro amnesty side with the socialist flags flying and all that, they said everybody
[02:35:48.900 --> 02:35:54.100]  that was on our side over here on the pro knows and are the anti illegal immigrant side. They were
[02:35:54.100 --> 02:36:00.820]  calling us all terrorists, bigots that we were basically unwelcomed and we should not be out
[02:36:00.820 --> 02:36:05.380]  here doing this. They want the borders to be completely wide open and they just want to make
[02:36:05.380 --> 02:36:10.980]  one huge North American content with no borders whatsoever. And by the way, that's the North
[02:36:10.980 --> 02:36:15.220]  American Union plan that Petraeus and Pelosi talked about. We're still not going to be allowed into
[02:36:15.220 --> 02:36:20.820]  Mexico. It's only we're open and then we've got to pay the bills. You understand that?
[02:36:21.540 --> 02:36:27.380]  Yes, I mean, what's going on out here is crazy. But I mean, the positive side of this is,
[02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:32.020]  you know, we're standing out here waiting on a bus. A bus hasn't happened. You know, what that tells
[02:36:32.020 --> 02:36:37.620]  me is a city like Murrieta stood up to the tyranny. They stood up to the government said, no, you're
[02:36:37.620 --> 02:36:41.380]  not going to come in here. And they scared these guys and they're not willing to come down here
[02:36:41.380 --> 02:36:46.900]  right now at all. Well, it's amazing. You know, that officer's body language was he didn't dislike
[02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:51.780]  you. He was being ordered to come over and try to tell you to get out of that area. Because the
[02:36:51.780 --> 02:36:56.740]  quote border patrol wanted you to yesterday, the police department came over here directly in the
[02:36:56.740 --> 02:37:00.820]  spot where I'm standing and they said, you can be here. If you have press credentials, you can be
[02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:04.500]  here and you can be across the street right over there where I was just standing. They said that
[02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:09.620]  is a public area on the right side of the road. The border patrol side is on the left side. So
[02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:14.260]  the police department told us that. So the border patrol, the government is bullying the local police
[02:37:14.260 --> 02:37:19.060]  department and telling them how they can run their jurisdiction. Well, the truth is you should be
[02:37:19.060 --> 02:37:24.660]  able to be anywhere as long as it's not on private property. And all those right of ways are public
[02:37:24.660 --> 02:37:30.180]  under common law. First, they say just get in these boxes. Then phase two, they say now get back
[02:37:30.180 --> 02:37:35.060]  in a smaller box. And finally, they say leave. They're training you to go under their control.
[02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:41.220]  And again, I mean, if you want to, I think you should go over there and talk to them and say,
[02:37:41.220 --> 02:37:48.180]  is this public right away? Is this the county or city of Marietta? Because I know the city has
[02:37:48.180 --> 02:37:52.900]  come out and said the feds aren't helping them. They can't take all these illegals and the rest of
[02:37:52.900 --> 02:37:58.500]  it. Well, I mean, right over here behind us was another area where they were allowing parking
[02:37:58.500 --> 02:38:03.620]  over here. And then they blocked it off and made this area that they were going to call a like a
[02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:08.580]  police, uh, police command center. But there's nobody even here from the police station for that.
[02:38:08.580 --> 02:38:13.940]  They're just trying to keep the free speech zone smaller and smaller. You know, every time we go
[02:38:13.940 --> 02:38:18.420]  to one of these events, they get smaller and smaller and smaller. And this is like a tiny box
[02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:22.180]  we're able to stand in to be able to voice our opinions here. Well, you do what you feel is
[02:38:22.180 --> 02:38:26.980]  best, but I personally would go and challenge it and walk around when they come over and flip out.
[02:38:26.980 --> 02:38:33.060]  I'd say, come on, man, this is America. You're busting illegal aliens in here, committing federal
[02:38:33.060 --> 02:38:38.500]  crime. We're here to expose this cover up. What do you expect us to do? I noticed Fox News is
[02:38:38.500 --> 02:38:41.940]  supposedly allowed to be on the other side of the street. What do you want to do, Joe? Okay, Joe
[02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:48.420]  Biggs, I'm saying, let's go do it. Why not? Oh, how dare an American walk where illegals are about
[02:38:48.420 --> 02:38:52.420]  to be busted. And again, we're not against these kids. I kind of agree with Glenn Beckton. It is
[02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:55.860]  good to be nice to him. Give him soccer balls, teddy bears, because they're leaving collapsed
[02:38:55.860 --> 02:39:04.100]  areas. But they're being used as weaponized tools politically in the middle. Do what? Anybody you,
[02:39:04.100 --> 02:39:12.260]  sir? That's fine. Okay, how about you? I mean, that's America right there. Just walk on over there.
[02:39:14.340 --> 02:39:16.180]  Okay, yeah, sure. Please have somebody out here.
[02:39:18.580 --> 02:39:21.940]  They're refusing to talk. They said they'll get someone else right. Where are they standing, Joe?
[02:39:21.940 --> 02:39:24.740]  Where are they standing? So why is it I have a question? No, why could Fox News bring their
[02:39:24.740 --> 02:39:29.220]  cameras over here a minute ago for five minutes after I was told I couldn't be here? And they
[02:39:29.220 --> 02:39:33.540]  walk up to him, Joe, and not one of you guys walked over the distance for the cop gets there.
[02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:40.500]  Do what? I mean, that's not Mexico or board patrol. That's the county road. I would just
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:44.500]  go talk to him. We were saying is why were why was Fox News allowed to sit over there? We were
[02:39:44.500 --> 02:39:49.620]  told we had to leave. Well, no, why are citizens period? Why are citizens period traded like crap?
[02:39:49.620 --> 02:39:54.100]  Tell them you want an air conditioned bus to give you a ride back to Austin. I want some free food.
[02:39:54.100 --> 02:39:57.380]  Can I get a health care? I'm a veteran. I haven't been seen in five months.
[02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:03.300]  And do you guys do anything for us, please? That's right. He costs a lot every day,
[02:40:03.300 --> 02:40:07.540]  but he can't get into the VA. I can't get into the VA, but they're in there hanging out.
[02:40:07.540 --> 02:40:12.740]  That's ridiculous. Well, this is country come to by the way, have they still canceled your VA
[02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:15.860]  checks since you went on the base? Yeah, I haven't gotten anything yet.
[02:40:19.780 --> 02:40:23.220]  Okay, they're going to try to call the police again and do what they do because they're sheep.
[02:40:23.220 --> 02:40:26.260]  Well, just listen, that's a county road right there, right? Go over and talk to him.
[02:40:26.820 --> 02:40:32.820]  Yeah, it's a county road. Go over and talk to him. Again, live from Marietta, California with Joe
[02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:41.380]  Biggs. It's not a public road. Is this not a public road to walk on? Yeah, we need to get the
[02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:46.020]  demonstrators over there to talk to everybody and just discuss this and not be put in smaller boxes.
[02:40:46.020 --> 02:40:53.620]  Go talk to that board of patrol. Let's go find out what's going on. That lady's talking to them.
[02:40:54.340 --> 02:40:56.420]  Okay, but what's the problem? That's what I understand.
[02:40:59.620 --> 02:41:02.900]  I don't know, but that's a problem when you follow orders and you don't follow your heart
[02:41:02.900 --> 02:41:06.020]  and you're not an American, you don't go by that, then that's what tyranny take.
[02:41:06.020 --> 02:41:08.740]  Ask him, ask him how long the Obama order to stand down.
[02:41:09.780 --> 02:41:13.300]  Anybody could take orders. Ask him how long ago Obama ordered to stand down.
[02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:18.100]  Do you want to go to the Obama order to stand down? When did Obama order to stand down?
[02:41:21.700 --> 02:41:23.060]  No, no, talk to him, talk to him.
[02:41:26.100 --> 02:41:29.060]  No, no, ask him if that's a county road or border patrol jurisdiction.
[02:41:31.140 --> 02:41:33.620]  They're only at the border. They're just in a power grab,
[02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:35.940]  getting more parts of the country's internal checkpoint.
[02:41:35.940 --> 02:41:43.140]  Again, if you just joined us, our reporters are in Southern California and Marietta.
[02:41:45.380 --> 02:41:48.340]  How far away are you from the border? That's the fence right there, correct?
[02:41:48.980 --> 02:41:56.100]  Oh, no, no, no. We're pretty far away from the border. This is maybe 120 miles.
[02:41:56.660 --> 02:42:00.020]  Yeah, that's what I thought, looking at the map, so I don't understand why the border patrol is there.
[02:42:00.020 --> 02:42:03.460]  Well, they have a big fence. If we have a fence across our borders, racist,
[02:42:03.460 --> 02:42:06.980]  but it's okay for them to have their fence. It's okay for the White House to have a fence around
[02:42:06.980 --> 02:42:11.700]  that. But wait a minute, wait a minute. That's right. I mean, they're dumping the people there
[02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:16.820]  in Marietta that's away from the border. And then why is the border patrol there? It just clicked.
[02:42:17.780 --> 02:42:22.260]  Their constitution free zone is only 100 miles from the border. I would go ask them,
[02:42:22.260 --> 02:42:27.380]  what are you doing away from the border, stopping citizens from reporting on illegals being bussed
[02:42:27.380 --> 02:42:30.580]  in? They literally are the immigrant importation agency.
[02:42:30.580 --> 02:42:35.380]  Why are you guys keeping us from doing our job report on this? All we're trying to do is get the facts.
[02:42:36.420 --> 02:42:42.340]  Hello? Back out from Marietta so people can see the map. This is unbelievable. People don't, they
[02:42:42.340 --> 02:42:54.500]  don't care. And the police are now pulling up. There's two police. I will talk to them. Ask them
[02:42:54.500 --> 02:43:00.260]  why the border patrol is 100 miles from the border telling you that the press can't walk around on
[02:43:00.260 --> 02:43:04.740]  the side of the road in a county. Go up and see what they're talking about over there. Let's go
[02:43:04.740 --> 02:43:09.620]  find out. Go ask the cop what's going on. No, it's all right. We have the right to record.
[02:43:10.580 --> 02:43:14.500]  We have the right to record. But all I say is there's been people walking over and talking to
[02:43:14.500 --> 02:43:18.740]  you guys. So why can't we? Because we're not on camera right now. Ask him why he's 100 miles from
[02:43:18.740 --> 02:43:25.140]  the border. Why are we guys, why are you guys 100 miles from the border? To protect illegals.
[02:43:25.140 --> 02:43:32.020]  From my job. It's called the First Amendment from Austin, Texas from info wars.com. Yes.
[02:43:35.380 --> 02:43:38.660]  No, the thing is, those people keep coming over here. And after you guys told us we had to move
[02:43:38.660 --> 02:43:45.940]  Fox News, move their camera. Listen, why is the border patrol 100 miles from the border
[02:43:45.940 --> 02:43:48.740]  shepherding illegally? Officers came over yesterday. That's all I was saying.
[02:43:50.820 --> 02:43:52.660]  They're there to cover up a crime. Bring that up.
[02:43:52.660 --> 02:43:57.380]  Find the cop pattern. You're actually impeding immigration right now. Impeding
[02:43:57.380 --> 02:44:00.660]  immigration. Importing them. Because they're impeding immigration.
[02:44:06.260 --> 02:44:09.540]  We can't talk to the ICE, at all, any ICE officials whatsoever. You guys put them on
[02:44:09.540 --> 02:44:16.020]  furlough. Tell them he's stonewalling while helping smuggle humans. You guys are stonewalling
[02:44:16.020 --> 02:44:23.220]  while helping smuggle humans. That guy has no jurisdiction. Tell the cop to come over. That
[02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:29.300]  border patrol is involved in treason. Is it this public property over here? Step back out of the
[02:44:29.300 --> 02:44:34.900]  roadway. Hey, go over to the sidewalk. Go to the sidewalk. The cops know it's all color law. Go to
[02:44:34.900 --> 02:44:40.260]  the cops over there. Don't talk to that cop. Can I see you real quick, please, sir? We just
[02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:44.340]  had to find out why yesterday we were told we could stand over here. And then today they're
[02:44:44.340 --> 02:44:47.380]  flipping out on us. That's what we're trying to figure out. Please, we're just standing over here
[02:44:47.380 --> 02:44:50.900]  being nice. They think you stole their property, sir. I thought we were told yesterday that you
[02:44:50.900 --> 02:44:55.780]  got your jurisdiction. That is not their property. Can you not put the camera on me?
[02:44:55.780 --> 02:45:00.660]  That is not. God, they're all working for the system. All the aid in the batch shipping the
[02:45:00.660 --> 02:45:06.260]  illegals in. That's all. It's not an interview. It's just a conversation. Go to the sidewalk.
[02:45:06.260 --> 02:45:12.420]  Go where they're at over there. This is unbelievable. And now they're wandering around.
[02:45:12.420 --> 02:45:19.540]  Look at her. She's there aiding and abetting this. Okay, so we're just trying to figure out
[02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:22.420]  because we were given different information yesterday. And that's what I've been trying to
[02:45:22.420 --> 02:45:26.020]  find out. They just keep stonewalling me. They want to answer my question. Yesterday,
[02:45:26.020 --> 02:45:32.180]  an officer from more police, they came over here and stopped and talked to us and said,
[02:45:32.180 --> 02:45:38.660]  this was an open area. You could be over here and sit down, have chairs and talk and interview
[02:45:38.660 --> 02:45:44.340]  and protest on this side of the road. We have that on film. Ask them why the Border Patrol is
[02:45:44.340 --> 02:45:49.140]  out of their jurisdiction. Arresting citizens. Okay, why can't we be over here today when
[02:45:49.140 --> 02:45:54.900]  yesterday you said we could? Well, I don't know what's changed. So I'm all I'm asking you here
[02:45:54.900 --> 02:46:01.140]  today while I'm here is please come out. Ask them why the Border Patrol, of course, is policing
[02:46:01.140 --> 02:46:14.020]  citizens. That's your guy's job. Why are the Border Patrol policing citizens?
[02:46:14.900 --> 02:46:18.580]  If you have specific questions, can I stand right here? How come the police didn't tell
[02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:24.740]  Fox News about the area that we were told to get out of? No, you're not. You're not like not
[02:46:24.740 --> 02:46:29.460]  rights, lady. But why I'm saying why is Fox here? It's Fox paying you guys. Does Fox News pay all
[02:46:29.460 --> 02:46:39.380]  you so they can use that? Yeah, go over to Fox. Go to the Fox Satellite. No, no, no, no, we just
[02:46:39.380 --> 02:46:45.380]  want to get a good answer. That's all. But that's not what we were told. You're aiding in a bed in
[02:46:45.380 --> 02:46:51.060]  the importation of illegals. It should be the same standard all the time. Go to the Fox Satellite.
[02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:54.980]  That's fine. We'll go to the Fox Satellite then. We'll go over here with lame stream media. No,
[02:46:54.980 --> 02:46:59.380]  no, no, not the other side. Go where Fox is at with the Satellite dish because they'll have to
[02:46:59.380 --> 02:47:04.580]  make them move too. Again, folks, this is cops following criminal orders to violate the First
[02:47:04.580 --> 02:47:11.860]  Amendment to then aid and abet the fraud of bringing illegals over. Yeah, exactly. We're right here
[02:47:11.860 --> 02:47:18.020]  outside the cones. Now, Fox will try to get you if they follow the pattern to have the cops throw
[02:47:18.020 --> 02:47:23.780]  you out of there as well. Joe, I don't mean to be ranting here, but I mean, break down what just
[02:47:23.780 --> 02:47:31.300]  happened. How many miles away from the border? 120. 120 miles from the border. And the border
[02:47:31.300 --> 02:47:37.780]  patrol is there to keep the press away from the illegals. It's 10 times more guarded than our
[02:47:37.780 --> 02:47:46.260]  borders are. Well, no, that's their job is to guard the illegal transfer and the human trafficking.
[02:47:46.260 --> 02:47:51.620]  It's government sponsored human trafficking at its best. Give us a report. Talk about what just
[02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:56.980]  happened. What happened was is we walked and we stood and we're talking where we were told to
[02:47:56.980 --> 02:48:01.940]  yesterday by the local police and then border patrol came over and said, oh, you can't be here.
[02:48:01.940 --> 02:48:07.140]  Well, that's not their jurisdiction. This is the public property area. This is the city's area right
[02:48:07.140 --> 02:48:11.940]  here. Right away trying to bully us around. It's only a matter of seconds before the brown shirt
[02:48:11.940 --> 02:48:17.300]  to show up to I'm sure. Well, yeah, and now the border patrol is fully converted to standing
[02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:22.820]  down on the border and then organizing bases inside the country to deploy illegals all over the nation.
[02:48:23.940 --> 02:48:30.900]  Yeah. I mean, everybody out here is watching this happen right now and filming because they see
[02:48:30.900 --> 02:48:35.540]  the tyranny happening right now. They're seeing these these puppets for the Obama administration
[02:48:35.540 --> 02:48:40.580]  and just try to put a a stranglehold on real Americans out here trying to speak the truth.
[02:48:40.580 --> 02:48:47.220]  None of that altered crap. And I love how the cops are saying just be nice. Don't get upset.
[02:48:47.220 --> 02:48:50.820]  Just basically you can't report because you're an American. We're about to help the border
[02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:56.340]  patrol bring illegals in here and you know, they're committing a major crime. So why are you upset?
[02:48:56.340 --> 02:49:03.060]  You should just let us shove you out of here. Yeah, I just I don't get why they this is just
[02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:09.140]  crazy. You know, it's I can't believe what I'm seeing here right now. You can't even come out
[02:49:09.140 --> 02:49:15.060]  here and talk on public property and they have to like shuttle you off in some little small free
[02:49:15.060 --> 02:49:21.540]  speech zone box. Watch, I bet they try to harass those patriots that have a cold pepper. Don't
[02:49:21.540 --> 02:49:27.300]  tread on me flag. I wouldn't doubt it. They'll probably start running over and tackle them here
[02:49:27.300 --> 02:49:31.620]  at any minute. Well, they're sitting over here. Look at a meeting over here conspiring for what
[02:49:31.620 --> 02:49:37.700]  they're going to do next. Well, I love how the cops walk up. Not so much the woman, but the other
[02:49:37.700 --> 02:49:42.420]  guy walks over like I can't believe you're filming me in a public place when all they do is film us
[02:49:42.420 --> 02:49:48.420]  and surveil us. I can't believe you're concerned about the collapse of America and huge trains
[02:49:48.420 --> 02:49:54.180]  from Central and South America pouring in with criminals and you name it. I can't believe you
[02:49:54.180 --> 02:50:00.020]  care. How dare you, Joe? Yeah, how dare me exercise my rights as an American.
[02:50:01.460 --> 02:50:06.500]  What is it? Well, also, they were simply telling you don't block the road, which they'll try
[02:50:06.500 --> 02:50:10.420]  jurisdictionally to say you're blocking it and arrest you. But you can go up to the edge of the
[02:50:10.420 --> 02:50:16.340]  sidewalk. You can also use the road to go back and forth. I would personally... Well, down here,
[02:50:16.340 --> 02:50:21.860]  look at this. All they said, this is a public area, this road right here, this dirt is public
[02:50:21.860 --> 02:50:27.380]  road, public access by the local police. Yeah, and now they're saying that that's border patrol
[02:50:28.020 --> 02:50:32.100]  property and we can no longer be there. Yeah, that's a lie. You can go to the maps guaranteed.
[02:50:32.100 --> 02:50:35.940]  It's not border patrol. The local police came by the way. She said, don't you don't you respect
[02:50:35.940 --> 02:50:41.460]  private property? So now the feds call their land private property. They want fences. They don't
[02:50:41.460 --> 02:50:46.260]  want to be surveilled, but they want to surveil us because it is a government run by crooks,
[02:50:46.260 --> 02:50:51.540]  for crooks, by crooks, of the crooks. We're going to go to Brett and come back to you,

[02:52:56.900 --> 02:53:03.140]  dead, inch. I think the national debt is $15 trillion. Boston U Economics Professor Lawrence
[02:53:03.140 --> 02:53:07.220]  Kotlikoff astutely points out that after factoring in guarantees such as social security,
[02:53:07.220 --> 02:53:12.260]  Medicare, Medicaid, and defense expenditures, the national debt is closer to $211 trillion.
[02:53:12.260 --> 02:53:16.900]  Mathematically, this debt is not serviceable via taxation. And for politicians on Capitol Hill,
[02:53:16.900 --> 02:53:20.980]  default is not an option. So we can expect the Federal Reserve to monetize the short while
[02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:25.380]  resulting in even more confiscation of our hard earned savings via inflation. Hi, my name is Adam

[02:54:24.500 --> 02:54:30.820]  to be like hundreds of thousands per major city in your area as a new political force they control
[02:54:32.260 --> 02:54:35.540]  who will carry out political voting operations, rioting, you name it.
[02:54:36.260 --> 02:54:39.540]  The Cubans were used for that in the 80s, very small numbers compared to this,
[02:54:40.340 --> 02:54:46.260]  in Florida for political control. Because they brought in the dregs there as well when Castro
[02:54:46.260 --> 02:54:52.820]  dumped his criminals on to the United States. And that's basically what's happening.
[02:54:52.820 --> 02:54:56.020]  People that have disabilities, people that have criminal records,
[02:54:56.020 --> 02:55:00.580]  mothers that are poor with a bunch of kids, it is party time and the cops are there.
[02:55:00.580 --> 02:55:06.100]  How dare you be an American? What the, you're supposed to cower at home like that judge that
[02:55:06.100 --> 02:55:11.780]  went door to door in Dallas and said, you don't come out and protest, boy. You do something we
[02:55:11.780 --> 02:55:18.660]  don't like, we're going to arrest you. Yeah, boy. Yeah, because this is a total takeover plan.
[02:55:18.660 --> 02:55:23.380]  Joe Biggs and Kit Daniels, I know you're going to have articles out on this, but border patrol
[02:55:23.380 --> 02:55:29.700]  operating 120 miles outside their jurisdiction, busing in the illegals, dumping them off there
[02:55:29.700 --> 02:55:35.700]  in the city. And the police, even though the mayor said they don't want more of the illegals
[02:55:35.700 --> 02:55:41.700]  and can't pay for it, 60 million already in the last few years. The cops are taking the orders
[02:55:41.700 --> 02:55:45.940]  of the border patrol to not let you walk up and talk to them and stuff because
[02:55:45.940 --> 02:55:50.020]  the prostitute media does what they're told you don't. Well, they're going to make these people
[02:55:50.020 --> 02:55:54.260]  look like terrorists on their news websites. They're going to call them bigots and things
[02:55:54.260 --> 02:55:58.900]  like that. That's pretty much what they usually always do. But if you notice, since we've been
[02:55:58.900 --> 02:56:02.900]  here, look at all the amount of cops and stuff that showed up when you're an American and you
[02:56:02.900 --> 02:56:09.220]  exercise your, your rights, they come out in full force. I just think it's hilarious that
[02:56:09.220 --> 02:56:14.020]  we went over there and asked them a few questions and now they brought out a couple of literally
[02:56:14.020 --> 02:56:18.820]  the enemy showed up. The enemy showed up. Yeah, that's right. When you're a liberty,
[02:56:18.820 --> 02:56:24.020]  love an American, you are a terrorist and enemy to this government now. They brought the canine
[02:56:24.580 --> 02:56:31.140]  Yeah, they brought the canine units now. Yeah, purely for intimidation, purely for intimidation
[02:56:31.140 --> 02:56:36.020]  to make sure they can commit those felonies and ship those illegals in as fast as they can.
[02:56:36.020 --> 02:56:39.460]  Well, look at this, pan over here real quick. Look at all these people over here. I mean,
[02:56:39.460 --> 02:56:43.780]  does that look like people who are terrorists to you? Everyone's sitting down waving American flags
[02:56:43.780 --> 02:56:49.380]  right now having a good time. And they just don't want bus full of buses full of people
[02:56:49.380 --> 02:56:56.340]  coming into their town and making their city go bankrupt. Well, it's undoubtedly have you seen
[02:56:56.340 --> 02:57:03.300]  any without saying names, any provocateurs trying to stir up trouble? Oh, yeah, there's one possible
[02:57:03.300 --> 02:57:09.860]  FBI informant guy here. Well, listen, the issue here overall is that it's important that that
[02:57:09.860 --> 02:57:15.300]  there not be any violence there. It's important that you know, we try to be as peaceful as possible.
[02:57:15.300 --> 02:57:22.900]  But we have to exercise our free speech at the same time. And we just cannot let the border
[02:57:22.900 --> 02:57:30.420]  patrol 120 miles from the border with the police sit there and frustrated. But I guess they're
[02:57:30.420 --> 02:57:34.900]  getting upset, because I guess they can't have those buses drop people off there because you're
[02:57:34.900 --> 02:57:41.700]  there. Exactly. I'm still waiting for another helicopter start flying over and having people
[02:57:41.700 --> 02:57:46.100]  repelled down right here in our location. Well, Joe, it's frustrating out there live on the street,
[02:57:46.100 --> 02:57:50.660]  but you've done an incredible job despite some technical issues. You and Kit, when are you guys
[02:57:50.660 --> 02:57:56.180]  coming back tomorrow night? All right, well, we're gonna have more live reports with you.
[02:57:56.180 --> 02:58:01.940]  Let's have a live report like 1130 30 minutes into the show central time tomorrow. Get your reports
[02:58:01.940 --> 02:58:08.260]  filed. Get those out to everybody that's out there. And again, we just salute you
[02:58:08.260 --> 02:58:13.140]  and commend you and I'll be praying for you. And it's just I don't even think those cops are bad
[02:58:13.140 --> 02:58:17.460]  people. But there they are aiding and abetting the border patrol that are so happy with their
[02:58:17.460 --> 02:58:22.900]  new job to follow orders to import people illegally, while citizens are being treated
[02:58:22.900 --> 02:58:28.260]  like total slaves. And it just proves Homeland Security, all of it is about slavery and is
[02:58:28.260 --> 02:58:32.740]  about control. More videos and articles from Kit Daniels and Joe Biggs at info wars dot com

[02:58:50.180 --> 02:58:55.540]  I can taste dirt in it. God knows what's in there. These people just sampled city of Austin tap
[02:58:55.540 --> 02:59:00.980]  water straight from the faucet. Next we had them try a sample of tap water filtered for the pro pure
[02:59:00.980 --> 02:59:06.740]  G 2.0 filtration system. Now my net is better taste like nothing. Yep, I know a good water tastes
[02:59:06.740 --> 02:59:12.740]  like it's good water. Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine glyphosate
[02:59:12.740 --> 02:59:16.740]  and many others. Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of
[02:59:16.740 --> 02:59:21.540]  major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ and even cancer. It tastes like you're
[02:59:21.540 --> 02:59:27.300]  drinking out of the lake when you're doing tap water. The pro pure G 2.0 filtration system removes
[02:59:27.300 --> 02:59:32.580]  these deadly substances, leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water. Okay, this is very
[02:59:32.580 --> 02:59:38.340]  tasty. It's good water. Refreshing. It's good. Go to info wars store dot com today and get your

[02:59:47.860 --> 02:59:57.940]  Coast to coast direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[03:00:06.100 --> 03:00:13.380]  big brother mainstream media government coverups you want answers well so does he
[03:00:13.380 --> 03:00:22.340]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[03:00:24.500 --> 03:00:28.500]  I apologize the callers just got stuck behind a bunch of important guests
[03:00:29.220 --> 03:00:35.620]  Ron in Hawaii you're on the air go ahead. All right, can you hear me? Yes, sir. All right,
[03:00:35.620 --> 03:00:43.220]  I'm there. It's 1968. I'm born in a military, you know, Army brat. And these people are here in force.
[03:00:44.020 --> 03:00:50.260]  Thousands of them. And they got brand new SUVs, everything. Then there's the other side, the
[03:00:50.260 --> 03:00:56.020]  gang guys. They're everywhere. And then all the cripples. It's like, they just showed up.
[03:00:56.580 --> 03:01:02.500]  And the last two months, thousands. So you're saying you're in Hawaii and there's the gang
[03:01:02.500 --> 03:01:08.740]  contingents that the the folks that we're sorry for but are disabled and then kids are in Hawaii.
[03:01:09.460 --> 03:01:16.660]  Yes, thousands. They got brand new SUVs. They can't even drive. I ain't kidding.
[03:01:17.860 --> 03:01:22.500]  I know. I've been seeing that around Austin. What do you what do you think the cover is here?
[03:01:22.500 --> 03:01:26.900]  We know there's money laundering drug dealing mules. I mean, what else do you
[03:01:26.900 --> 03:01:32.660]  think's behind this total takeover? They're trying to ruin it. Just like you said, I never had the
[03:01:32.660 --> 03:01:38.180]  internet before. I know it was bad, but I know it was this bad. See, my daughter just hooked me up with
[03:01:38.180 --> 03:01:44.820]  this and your show. And I knew it was bad, but this is crazy. And these people over here,
[03:01:44.820 --> 03:01:48.740]  they got bugs all over them. I can see it crawling. I don't even like to ride a bus no more.
[03:01:48.740 --> 03:01:57.300]  They don't keep the locals don't like to ride the bus no more here. There's thousands.
[03:01:57.380 --> 03:02:02.020]  Man, it's crazy. No, I hear you. I mean, Latin America is poor and has a lot of bad things
[03:02:02.020 --> 03:02:06.660]  about it, but it's not that bad in many areas. It's that they're sending the most,
[03:02:07.780 --> 03:02:15.860]  you know, absolutely destitute. And that's a poem about send me your poor, send me your
[03:02:15.860 --> 03:02:20.580]  unwashed or whatever, but that's not really what's going on here. I mean, that's not what built this
[03:02:20.580 --> 03:02:26.900]  country. And it's clowered in heaven. That's why the socialists showed up in Marietta and said,
[03:02:26.900 --> 03:02:31.540]  we want clowered in heaven. We have the video. I mean, they know what they're doing. And it's
[03:02:31.540 --> 03:02:36.340]  just game over, man, game over. If America doesn't turn the corner and I see those Border Patrol,
[03:02:37.140 --> 03:02:42.100]  they're bossing citizens around to bring the illegals in. Now the Border Patrol literally
[03:02:42.100 --> 03:02:48.660]  has been fully converted to butlers for the illegals. And again, I'm not even demonizing
[03:02:48.660 --> 03:02:54.420]  the illegals themselves. They're just a tool, a weapon. But in the hands of the globalists,
[03:02:54.420 --> 03:03:00.820]  they are a weapon. Stacy in California, thanks for holding. Hi, how are you? I'm all right.
[03:03:00.820 --> 03:03:07.940]  Thanks for calling. Thank you. Yes, I am from Marietta and I have been out at the protest every day,
[03:03:07.940 --> 03:03:16.180]  mostly doing night shift. And since before the first bus has arrived. And I realized that you
[03:03:16.180 --> 03:03:19.860]  guys are having problems with the Border Patrol right now in the police department on the street
[03:03:19.860 --> 03:03:29.140]  there. I'm on my way there after the phone call. But just know that when there's no cameras around,
[03:03:29.700 --> 03:03:33.860]  the Border Patrol agents in the police department are completely on our side.
[03:03:33.860 --> 03:03:38.820]  They do nothing but thank us. I know, I know they know they're committing crimes.
[03:03:40.020 --> 03:03:43.060]  I mean, I'm sorry, the Border Patrol, I don't care if they know it's wrong.
[03:03:43.940 --> 03:03:51.380]  It is a crime under federal law to sit. I mean, I can't send my kids randomly to some other country.
[03:03:51.380 --> 03:03:57.860]  That's child endangerment. And all I'm saying is, but you're right, we don't want to turn this into
[03:03:57.860 --> 03:04:04.740]  an anti-border patrol, anti-police thing. Go ahead. And what my point is, is that they have
[03:04:04.740 --> 03:04:10.900]  officially been placed on a gag order and they cannot speak to anyone about anything anymore,
[03:04:10.900 --> 03:04:16.980]  because too much information has been getting out. But they have told us and they have told
[03:04:16.980 --> 03:04:23.380]  their commanding officers that if they're told to march on us or arrest us, they will stand down.
[03:04:23.380 --> 03:04:27.700]  Well, it's clear that that's what they've already decided that. That's why they keep
[03:04:27.700 --> 03:04:32.820]  backing off. Usually the cops will just attack you. But they realize they are so in the wrong here
[03:04:33.860 --> 03:04:40.500]  that people are just ready for something to kick off, which I do not want. So I agree with you.
[03:04:40.500 --> 03:04:44.100]  I'm going to do some more overdrive, Stacey. I want to hear more from you on the other side.
[03:04:44.100 --> 03:04:50.820]  Then we're going to go to Lewis. Then we're going to go to Mike and Duke and Carolyn.
[03:04:50.820 --> 03:04:56.580]  More overdrive coming up. Stay with us. This is beyond radio. I mean, this is so real, folks.
[03:04:56.580 --> 03:05:04.900]  I just, I just am so angry. By now, you may know that a Bitcoin is the first decentralized currency

[03:08:11.140 --> 03:08:18.580]  Fix Bayonets. We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones broadcasting live
[03:08:18.580 --> 03:08:24.020]  from the front lines. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:28.980 --> 03:08:33.140]  I just try to do too much when I start getting in these whiny moods on air. It's because
[03:08:33.140 --> 03:08:38.820]  it just gives me a headache to just see all the stuff the globalists are doing,
[03:08:38.820 --> 03:08:43.300]  all the crimes they're committing, how they're eroding our freedoms, how they're establishing
[03:08:43.300 --> 03:08:48.020]  open tyrannies against us, and shutting up Homeland Security for the American people while
[03:08:48.020 --> 03:08:55.060]  aiding Al Qaeda. And then I don't like having to sit here and, you know, cold bloodily say we
[03:08:55.060 --> 03:09:02.340]  can't take all these illegals because it's humans, I feel sorry for them. But it's a globalist plan
[03:09:02.900 --> 03:09:08.740]  to manipulate those feelings in me and to bring down the country. And then I see the border patrols
[03:09:08.740 --> 03:09:13.780]  saying get back, get back so they can bring the buses in. And I don't want to hate them
[03:09:13.780 --> 03:09:18.740]  or the cops that try to aggressively come over and say get back just because we're trying to be on
[03:09:18.740 --> 03:09:25.620]  the sidewalk. And, you know, I know the police and the border patrol because we've talked to them.
[03:09:25.620 --> 03:09:28.980]  I really freaked out about what's happening. They know this means the country's collapsing.
[03:09:31.140 --> 03:09:35.620]  You've got the head of the border patrol union, the deputy head saying they're under a gag order,
[03:09:35.620 --> 03:09:39.940]  says no agents, securing border. They were ordered to stand down three and a half months ago. I mean,
[03:09:39.940 --> 03:09:48.340]  that is sensational. And still we can't get it out in the news other than info wars.com,
[03:09:48.340 --> 03:09:54.980]  road report.com, whirlwind daily.com, maybe the Washington times.com. And then when we reported,
[03:09:54.980 --> 03:09:59.380]  okay, New York Times goes, yeah, we're busting them all over the country. And then now they're
[03:09:59.380 --> 03:10:04.660]  building up so much in these cities from Michigan to Texas, from California to New York, from
[03:10:04.660 --> 03:10:09.220]  Alabama to Washington state that even Democrat cities are freaking out. People are going,
[03:10:09.220 --> 03:10:15.380]  man, there's 10,000 kids here and a bunch of men. And I mean, I went down to the hiking bike trail
[03:10:15.380 --> 03:10:24.020]  in the middle of nowhere where there's never people to take the dog last weekend. And I've been to
[03:10:24.020 --> 03:10:27.860]  Guatemala and I have family that live there. So I have a lot of Guatemalan, you know, machete and
[03:10:27.860 --> 03:10:34.180]  Guatemalan bags and stuff. And I said, I said, I've seen that before. And I walked over and talked
[03:10:34.180 --> 03:10:39.700]  to the people and I said, you from Guatemala and they're like, see Guatemala. And it was like a
[03:10:39.700 --> 03:10:47.940]  grandma in the water with a tin can and like woven string fishing. And they had bags. And I saw
[03:10:47.940 --> 03:10:52.900]  where there'd been a fire and I was like, my God, there's people from Guatemala living on the hiking
[03:10:52.900 --> 03:11:05.380]  bike trail. And again, I don't dislike them as people. I have some of them on my iPhone actually.
[03:11:05.380 --> 03:11:11.140]  But I realized this is an unlimited stream, a weapon, because they'll end up after a while
[03:11:11.140 --> 03:11:20.420]  getting on welfare rolls, getting into the system and politically doing whatever the Democratic
[03:11:20.420 --> 03:11:25.380]  Party tells them to do. And this is the Republican Party helping kill the country.
[03:11:27.300 --> 03:11:32.420]  If you don't get it, folks, you use a tin can with a string tied to it and then you can roll it.
[03:11:32.420 --> 03:11:37.140]  See, and that's a real, that's a rod and reel with just the can.
[03:11:41.540 --> 03:11:47.620]  And again, this is a family of like five kids and grandma that fled Guatemala.
[03:11:47.620 --> 03:11:53.220]  And I totally get why they want to be here. But I guess they haven't paid the coyotes or whatever
[03:11:53.220 --> 03:11:56.980]  enough here in Austin that run the Democratic Party. If you don't pay them a bunch of money,
[03:11:56.980 --> 03:11:59.780]  they'll beat you up with a baseball bat or kill you and bury in their backyard.
[03:12:00.500 --> 03:12:04.020]  And they just dig them up everywhere with the Democratic Party people's houses and just get
[03:12:04.020 --> 03:12:07.940]  swept from the rug because they're really exploiting these people. You want to be honest
[03:12:07.940 --> 03:12:12.180]  about it. And then I kind of clicked this morning, maybe Glenn Beck's right. I mean,
[03:12:12.180 --> 03:12:17.620]  we do bring them soccer balls and teddy bears. But then that takes the moral high ground away from
[03:12:17.620 --> 03:12:22.420]  the Democrats that are causing all this. And then we point out, why is Latin America so corrupt?
[03:12:22.420 --> 03:12:26.420]  Why can't they be helped? And then point out what the Democrats are planning to do. I mean,
[03:12:26.420 --> 03:12:31.060]  maybe I'm wrong to say that's just a sick ploy or a stunt.
[03:12:34.340 --> 03:12:38.420]  But UC professor says immigration influx is about reeducation of society
[03:12:38.420 --> 03:12:44.660]  and a permanent subservient class. And that's it. Who are under government control so they're
[03:12:44.660 --> 03:12:48.180]  unindependent. Stacy, you're saying you live there in Marietta. You're about to get off work
[03:12:48.180 --> 03:12:52.180]  and go down there. And you're saying you've talked to the board of patrol and police down there.
[03:12:52.180 --> 03:12:57.780]  We've talked to them too. In other areas of Texas and ICE agents and emergency managers,
[03:12:57.780 --> 03:13:05.460]  what you're saying is true. But nevertheless, they're following the orders. And again,
[03:13:05.460 --> 03:13:09.300]  we don't have long to stop this collapse. I don't know how long we've got, but the trains
[03:13:09.300 --> 03:13:17.780]  are more full now. There's more of them. And Homeland Security is now the collapse system.
[03:13:17.780 --> 03:13:22.420]  And this is clearly what Obama's planning to collapse the country, amongst other things.
[03:13:22.420 --> 03:13:26.820]  There's no doubt the socialists showed up with the Democratic Party and admitted that yesterday
[03:13:26.820 --> 03:13:31.780]  in Marietta. We have the video and it's just mind blowing. It is mind blowing.
[03:13:31.780 --> 03:13:40.660]  And to see this happening and to realize it's happening and to realize it's not going to
[03:13:40.660 --> 03:13:47.300]  help the people once the U.S. collapses, there'll be nowhere to run. Anyways, Stacy, anything else?
[03:13:48.980 --> 03:13:53.940]  Yes. Well, I just wanted to say that after Tuesday when we had turned the buses around
[03:13:53.940 --> 03:14:01.060]  successfully, I did go down to San Diego because I heard that's where our buses
[03:14:01.060 --> 03:14:06.580]  were being diverted. So I went to San Diego and I went to a few Border Patrol stations down there
[03:14:06.580 --> 03:14:10.980]  to try to find out where they were going because I knew they're not being sent back to Texas.
[03:14:12.100 --> 03:14:18.260]  But I had found out that they were, after being spread around all of San Diego County,
[03:14:18.260 --> 03:14:25.540]  they had been now collected into one particular facility in Chula Vista at 311 Athe Street.
[03:14:25.540 --> 03:14:33.940]  They are being housed there and this area is right on the border of Tijuana and San Diego.
[03:14:33.940 --> 03:14:39.380]  It's a very dangerous neighborhood. If you wave the American flag, it's like waving a target.
[03:14:39.380 --> 03:14:45.140]  So they know there will be no protest of anyone stopping buses from entering that facility.
[03:14:45.860 --> 03:14:50.020]  However, the disease and contamination that is spreading and is rampant
[03:14:50.020 --> 03:14:52.580]  is why they've had to be condensed to one location.
[03:14:52.580 --> 03:15:01.220]  Wow, and they're not letting congressmen into these facilities. I mean, this is just so illegal.
[03:15:01.220 --> 03:15:05.220]  Where's the child welfare? I mean, they're taking homeschoolers' kids because they make
[03:15:05.220 --> 03:15:10.820]  nothing but A's and then you've got these kids being exploited. Can you imagine what they're
[03:15:10.820 --> 03:15:17.460]  doing to these kids? Well, that's the other thing is that after I followed them there and
[03:15:17.460 --> 03:15:24.020]  after I was at Border Patrol and I was driving along the border looking and watching these people,
[03:15:24.020 --> 03:15:29.540]  I drove to ICE headquarters in downtown San Diego in Front Street and I sat out there by
[03:15:29.540 --> 03:15:34.980]  myself protesting. And as ICE agents came up to me and asked what I was doing there,
[03:15:36.020 --> 03:15:44.260]  some people, men in their mid-20s, walked up and asked the ICE officers for directions to the
[03:15:44.260 --> 03:15:50.340]  trolley station. And as the ICE officers were trying to give them directions, the men started
[03:15:50.340 --> 03:15:57.220]  laughing and saying, ah, we just got released. We're so happy and broken English. And the ICE
[03:15:57.220 --> 03:16:01.700]  agents put their hand up and said, I can't talk to you and turned around and walked away. And I
[03:16:01.700 --> 03:16:05.940]  said, are you kidding me? I said, why aren't you arresting them? I said, you know what? The trolley
[03:16:05.940 --> 03:16:10.900]  station is around the corner. You take the southbound line all the way till it stops.
[03:16:10.900 --> 03:16:14.660]  No, no, no, they, I mean, they release them publicly. You've got to tell that testimony.
[03:16:14.660 --> 03:16:23.700]  Go out there and tell Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and Kit Daniels. Tell them everything that you
[03:16:23.700 --> 03:16:27.140]  just told us. That's very powerful. God bless you. They're going to be out there all day and they
[03:16:27.140 --> 03:16:31.940]  come back tomorrow night. Thank you, Stacy. Lewis in North Carolina, South Carolina, go ahead.
[03:16:33.220 --> 03:16:37.300]  Oh, yes, Alex. I wanted to say thanks for taking my call. I wanted to speak directly
[03:16:37.300 --> 03:16:47.300]  regarding the, um, the, uh, problem with Rhode Island, uh, using DNA, uh, against, uh, uh,
[03:16:47.300 --> 03:16:51.300]  with, with, with the school children. I want to. That's right. Now states like Rhode Island are
[03:16:51.300 --> 03:16:55.460]  passing laws to take DNA from everybody. First they denied they were doing this with babies
[03:16:55.460 --> 03:17:01.220]  at birth. Now they, they say in the bill, it will re legalize that. Right. And, and well,
[03:17:01.220 --> 03:17:04.420]  I wanted to speak directly to your previous caller who's an expected parent and everyone
[03:17:04.420 --> 03:17:08.980]  out there who's expected parents, they need to stand up to this and politely let me talk to
[03:17:08.980 --> 03:17:12.900]  the provider and tell them, I know, I understand the value of the Guthrie test that does field
[03:17:12.900 --> 03:17:17.460]  prick test that harvest this information. It's a useful prophylactic to test for things like
[03:17:17.460 --> 03:17:21.620]  taste act and other congenital diseases. I understand the value of it. They, they, they
[03:17:21.620 --> 03:17:26.740]  make their intentions. They will not have this test on religious grounds. They will turn this
[03:17:26.740 --> 03:17:31.700]  test down unless they get a written assertion. They'll do this test in a private facility,
[03:17:31.700 --> 03:17:34.500]  such a private facility. Yeah, that's right. What you got? Yeah, because they'll say we're
[03:17:34.500 --> 03:17:37.940]  going to do blood tests, but it doesn't even really get done. They send it to the health
[03:17:37.940 --> 03:17:43.540]  department and into the feds. I first, we first broke that a long time ago. And now it's mainstream
[03:17:43.540 --> 03:17:48.260]  news that, oh, we got to get the blood again for our secret database. And again, just government
[03:17:48.260 --> 03:17:54.980]  does whatever it wants. And it wants to collapse the country. That's what this is all a plan for.
[03:17:55.540 --> 03:18:00.260]  And it's totally disgusting. We're going to skip this network break and go to the bottom of the
[03:18:00.260 --> 03:18:06.420]  hour. Mike in Toronto, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Hey, Alex, how are you?
[03:18:07.300 --> 03:18:10.660]  Just sometimes I get exhausted. It's just, it's just, it's just too crazy.
[03:18:11.380 --> 03:18:17.300]  Yeah. Listen, I just want to get your take on this and see what it means. Basically,
[03:18:17.300 --> 03:18:24.020]  if you remember 14 years ago, there was the whole case with Eileen Gonzalez, one kid that was sent
[03:18:24.020 --> 03:18:29.460]  here. His mother died on the way over from Cuba, but he was sent here. There was a custody case
[03:18:29.460 --> 03:18:34.500]  where his father wanted to bring him back to Cuba. You're, you just mentioned a while ago,
[03:18:34.500 --> 03:18:39.540]  there are a thousand kids or thousands of kids that are being sent across the border.
[03:18:39.540 --> 03:18:43.860]  And I'm just wondering how the government would react. Oh yeah, the government grabbed him away
[03:18:43.860 --> 03:18:48.900]  from his family, sending back child welfare SWAT teams because they cared. The truth is, they
[03:18:48.900 --> 03:18:53.940]  don't care. The globalists can care less. Like they hate basically everybody but themselves.
[03:18:53.940 --> 03:18:57.060]  It's just, it's just, they suspend whatever laws they want, whenever they want.
[03:18:57.060 --> 03:19:03.380]  And again, they're encouraging the whole thing and busing them in. It's all planned.
[03:19:04.740 --> 03:19:09.060]  Would they possibly know what the status of every child is if they're just busing them and
[03:19:09.060 --> 03:19:19.060]  can process them and let them go? No, no, I hear you. Listen, it's a plan by design on record.
[03:19:19.060 --> 03:19:22.500]  I appreciate your call. Duke in Oklahoma, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[03:19:22.500 --> 03:19:32.180]  Yeah. Well, you know, Mary Fallon is allowing 1100 of them, they say, you know, here in Oklahoma.
[03:19:32.180 --> 03:19:37.620]  And, you know, that's just a door open is all that is. By the way, that's a total siob. They
[03:19:37.620 --> 03:19:42.020]  always say in the first announcement, oh, there'll be 1100 at this school that that's,
[03:19:42.020 --> 03:19:46.260]  that's 10,000 per town when they're done. Okay. It's to collapse the country.
[03:19:47.140 --> 03:19:51.700]  And so again, there's already, they say it's five million Legals. It's 30 million.
[03:19:51.700 --> 03:19:55.540]  And that's a conservative number that are already here. I mean, it's always 10,
[03:19:55.540 --> 03:20:01.700]  20, 30 times what they say. Same time, they're shutting down, starting to shut down roadways.
[03:20:01.700 --> 03:20:06.340]  And they're doing a lot more bags where they'll just shut the road down if they see a couple
[03:20:06.340 --> 03:20:11.460]  backpacks or something like that. And those shut the road down. They're getting people ready for
[03:20:11.460 --> 03:20:17.940]  something. Yeah, we need to be talking about what they're going to do when the collapse
[03:20:17.940 --> 03:20:22.740]  accelerates. That's what we should be focusing on. What comes next? The waves are getting bigger.
[03:20:22.740 --> 03:20:26.740]  How big will they get? Because there's a depression all over the Caribbean and
[03:20:26.740 --> 03:20:32.500]  central and South America. Mexico has failed. I mean, that's a fact. And now the federal
[03:20:32.500 --> 03:20:38.260]  government has decided to allow collapsing countries in to collapse into ours, which is
[03:20:39.060 --> 03:20:44.740]  an act of political war. I mean, refugees can wreck a country. That's well known.
[03:20:44.740 --> 03:20:52.100]  And they have done this now. And I mean, this is just over the top. And then if you don't accept
[03:20:52.100 --> 03:20:57.700]  the collapse, Robert Rodriguez and Obama will say you're a racist pushing race war. And then when
[03:20:57.700 --> 03:21:03.540]  the collapse happens and the welfare checks don't get there or the dollars devalued and it won't
[03:21:03.540 --> 03:21:09.940]  buy enough, the entire country's going to burn. And that's the plan. And then they'll say we're
[03:21:09.940 --> 03:21:13.780]  going to restore order. And just like out here, the cops will come after anybody that didn't
[03:21:13.780 --> 03:21:17.460]  like it. I mean, that's the plan. That's pretty much it.
[03:21:19.300 --> 03:21:21.940]  I know you are too, brother. So let's just keep fighting.
[03:21:22.580 --> 03:21:25.380]  Well, what else do you think they're going to pull? Because this is important. We should be
[03:21:25.380 --> 03:21:30.180]  discussing it. Well, you know, they're preparing us right now. If you just look around at what
[03:21:30.180 --> 03:21:37.060]  they're doing, you can kind of get an idea, a glimpse of what they're trying to set up or stage.
[03:21:37.860 --> 03:21:42.820]  And you can watch the news all you want, or you can pay attention to what's going on in your town.
[03:21:42.820 --> 03:21:47.940]  But it's great that we're all connected. We're able to talk to each other by your fault, by
[03:21:47.940 --> 03:21:53.860]  using your program to communicate these things and get them out there. We should have had more
[03:21:53.860 --> 03:21:57.940]  cameras down there in California. Whenever they went up to bigs, they should have, we should have
[03:21:57.940 --> 03:22:02.820]  had three or four other people videotaping those camera guys. That way we can expose this stuff
[03:22:02.820 --> 03:22:09.220]  for what it really is. We've got to have backup. I hear you. God bless you. I mean, I'm reading
[03:22:09.220 --> 03:22:15.220]  the headlines at info wars.com and drugs report.com El Paso times. Another plane lands in El Paso
[03:22:15.220 --> 03:22:19.060]  carrying more undocumented immigrants. The official who spoke on the backgrounds that the
[03:22:19.060 --> 03:22:23.460]  border patrol has been getting family groups and processing them before turning them over to
[03:22:23.460 --> 03:22:28.260]  immigration and customs enforcement, who then ships them deeper into the US. I mean, the words
[03:22:28.260 --> 03:22:33.460]  out, you get here, you're legal. But me as a citizen, I could hardly get back in the country.
[03:22:33.460 --> 03:22:43.700]  Um, death train derails in Mexico magazine reports. Amnesty disaster for black workers
[03:22:43.700 --> 03:22:51.940]  to disaster for everybody. Administration turns to churches to avoid clashes. Volunteers worked
[03:22:51.940 --> 03:22:56.260]  identified bodies of dead children. Muslim prayer rug found on Arizona border.
[03:22:56.260 --> 03:23:04.580]  More military bases asked to open facilities. Homeland closing roads to keep reporters out.
[03:23:09.540 --> 03:23:15.060]  I mean, this is just, this is just insane. And then you go to info wars.com. They just
[03:23:15.060 --> 03:23:19.940]  posted a bunch of amazing videos with the headline special report protesters arrive
[03:23:19.940 --> 03:23:25.300]  outside border patrol station in Marietta. I mean, this has been going on for weeks.
[03:23:25.300 --> 03:23:28.660]  Uh, more people are arriving. I think I'm going to change that headline to,
[03:23:31.780 --> 03:23:34.420]  you know, to one of these other issues. I'm going to watch some of these videos and change
[03:23:34.420 --> 03:23:40.180]  that headline because it's, it's a whole bunch of videos boiling all this down. Um, and so
[03:23:43.460 --> 03:23:45.700]  um, I think the headline should be
[03:23:47.620 --> 03:23:52.100]  border patrol operates outside their jurisdiction, tries to keep reporters away from buses. I mean,
[03:23:52.100 --> 03:23:58.100]  I, border patrol tries to keep press away from buses in Marietta. You know, that's it. There's
[03:23:58.100 --> 03:24:07.460]  your headline. So, um, that's a very important article up on info wars.com. Um, that's just some
[03:24:07.460 --> 03:24:13.220]  of the news we've got up there. Caroline in New York here on the air. Go ahead. Hi, Alex. Good
[03:24:13.220 --> 03:24:19.620]  to talk to you. I'm up here in upstate New York and I called my congressman who is Tom Reed
[03:24:19.620 --> 03:24:27.220]  and, um, this little trendy answered the phone like always and I said, well, how many, how many
[03:24:27.220 --> 03:24:35.940]  unaccompanied illegal aliens are being shipped into New York and he didn't know. And I'm like,
[03:24:35.940 --> 03:24:39.940]  well, what are you answering the phone for? If you don't know how many are being shipped in here?
[03:24:39.940 --> 03:24:47.380]  So I'm being given the run around every time I call his office to ask him a question. It's just
[03:24:47.380 --> 03:24:53.300]  a run around. They don't know how many and I said, well, what are you doing about it? And they said,
[03:24:53.300 --> 03:25:00.740]  oh, well, we're looking into it. It's just crazy. And remember, though, they have federally funded
[03:25:00.740 --> 03:25:06.020]  checkpoints where they take blood without warrants now intimidating people and surveillance and
[03:25:06.020 --> 03:25:12.500]  cameras everywhere. We just had a checkpoint the other week. I was driving to work and there was
[03:25:12.500 --> 03:25:17.940]  a sign on the side of the road that said, slow down checkpoint. I mean, it was early in the morning,
[03:25:17.940 --> 03:25:24.100]  so it wasn't set up yet. And I'm thinking, what the heck is this all about? So I mean, it's,
[03:25:24.100 --> 03:25:31.380]  it's just crazy up here. We have so much so many drug addicts and people on Medicare and disability.
[03:25:31.380 --> 03:25:37.620]  They just shut down the, you know, they want to shut down our handicapped workshop and just
[03:25:37.620 --> 03:25:41.860]  release all these people onto the street with nowhere to go. Oh, yeah, that's it. They're getting
[03:25:41.860 --> 03:25:45.460]  rid of the mental health. They're getting rid of the workshops for poor people. They're cutting
[03:25:45.460 --> 03:25:50.340]  all the social networks that would help black, white, Hispanic poor people and just dumping
[03:25:50.340 --> 03:25:56.100]  more in. This is the plan collapse. Undoubtedly. The question is, what are they planning to pull
[03:25:56.100 --> 03:26:01.300]  during it? I mean, I am so on the edge of my seat right now, because we're not going to have to
[03:26:01.300 --> 03:26:06.900]  wait to see what's going to happen now. It's all about to get crazy. I told this trendy. I told
[03:26:06.900 --> 03:26:12.660]  them to, I said, look up cloud and pivot. I said, you'll learn a lot. I said, and this is, this is
[03:26:12.660 --> 03:26:20.820]  a controlled collapse. It's going to lower wages here. I said, and also your future is doomed.
[03:26:20.820 --> 03:26:26.740]  I said, these, these illegal aliens are being given in-state tuition. Any state they want to
[03:26:26.740 --> 03:26:32.260]  go to school in, I said, how about you? Are you being given in-state tuition? No, you're being
[03:26:32.260 --> 03:26:37.700]  allowed to make a debt slave. And these guys get a free ride. And well, again, they're being used
[03:26:37.700 --> 03:26:43.460]  because they're so pliable. They will do whatever the government tells them, aka the Democratic
[03:26:43.460 --> 03:26:47.540]  Party. And they only need a few more percentage points to ban guns in Texas and in New York and
[03:26:47.540 --> 03:26:51.300]  California. And in fact, California's already got the votes. New York has it and they're taking
[03:26:51.300 --> 03:26:55.300]  the guns. And so that's why they're doing it. I mean, this is to turn the whole country blue.
[03:26:56.020 --> 03:27:00.980]  The Republican leadership's going along with it. And I mean, it's on. I appreciate your call. Great
[03:27:00.980 --> 03:27:06.100]  points, Carolina, New York. Thanks for holding. Look at this infowars.com posted article by Max
[03:27:06.100 --> 03:27:14.340]  Lavo at, you know what? Hit the fan report. Shock report, 70 million people would be starving in
[03:27:14.340 --> 03:27:19.540]  the streets without government welfare programs. The fundamental numbers behind all the propaganda
[03:27:19.540 --> 03:27:25.700]  tell a startling different story. 101 million are on welfare. 70 plus million are on total welfare.
[03:27:25.700 --> 03:27:32.980]  That's a weapon because these aren't just like cows you quit feeding and they jump the fence and go
[03:27:32.980 --> 03:27:39.940]  somewhere else or die. These are human beings that will burn, destroy, kill, but they won't have to
[03:27:39.940 --> 03:27:44.580]  do that. They just got to politically get in line and they'll get their freebies. I mean,
[03:27:44.580 --> 03:27:49.140]  it's a total plan. You wonder how America will be conquered? This is it. And it's not 20 years
[03:27:49.140 --> 03:27:56.420]  from now. Like they said 20 years ago, it's now. It's just about to start. As I keep telling you,
[03:27:56.420 --> 03:28:05.460]  it's going to get crazier and crazier and crazier. And all of you that have played along with it are
[03:28:05.460 --> 03:28:10.100]  literally digging your own graves. Last caller I have time for, I apologize to the others.
[03:28:10.820 --> 03:28:13.300]  Ray in Florida, you're on the air. You'll be our tail gunner.
[03:28:13.300 --> 03:28:17.860]  Tail gunner. I like that. Am I on now? You are, brother.
[03:28:18.660 --> 03:28:24.500]  Okay, good. I'm going to talk to you about the chemtrails. I was working on a roof recently
[03:28:24.500 --> 03:28:28.500]  and I'm seeing them spray usually populated areas. Am I correct in saying that?
[03:28:29.220 --> 03:28:32.820]  Well, they're doing atmospheric manipulations and a lot of them. They've also got lower sprays.
[03:28:33.460 --> 03:28:37.140]  We don't know. There's a lot of declassified stuff. It's a giant program. We're not sure what's
[03:28:37.140 --> 03:28:44.500]  going on. Okay. Well, usually classified materials are nine times out of 10 weapons based. So,
[03:28:44.500 --> 03:28:50.980]  I stumbled on major technology recently on the internet with the World War II when they were
[03:28:51.780 --> 03:28:55.300]  practicing on the Japanese POWs and microwaving in the death. Yes.
[03:28:56.500 --> 03:29:02.420]  And I noticed that they had said something if they can get something inside your body.
[03:29:02.420 --> 03:29:08.580]  Oh, yeah. I know. I mean, that's a big part of the aluminum dioxide and other barium salts and
[03:29:08.580 --> 03:29:14.820]  things is to resonate with the major technology and slow fry you so they can actuary out when
[03:29:14.820 --> 03:29:18.820]  you'll die. Oh, yeah. That's a big part of the frequency pollution program we're under. Yep.
[03:29:19.540 --> 03:29:23.940]  Yeah. So, I was looking at my microwave door and I noticed that the microwave door,
[03:29:25.060 --> 03:29:29.140]  if you can go ahead and get something to stop them, the major technology from getting to your
[03:29:29.140 --> 03:29:35.300]  body, is it possible to stop the major technology? Well, sir, I just think you should drink fluoride,
[03:29:35.300 --> 03:29:40.340]  take all the shots and eat the GMO and corn syrup and just worship government. I mean,
[03:29:40.340 --> 03:29:44.820]  don't be extreme and don't say the word bossy. Michelle Obama said not to and she's the boss.
[03:29:44.820 --> 03:29:49.220]  Okay. All right. That's not bossy for her to say, don't be bossy. I mean, it's totally normal.
[03:29:49.220 --> 03:29:52.180]  We're on the march. Great job of the crew. The empire's on the march. I want to thank all our
[03:29:52.180 --> 03:29:56.740]  affiliates. Pray for an awakening. And the GCN radio network. We've already hit the rocks.
[03:29:56.740 --> 03:29:58.740]  Now, will we break up?
