[00:57.760 --> 01:05.800]  one of the major cartels in documents Vicente, Zem, Bada, Nabella worked for the
[01:05.800 --> 01:09.360]  US government in drug trafficking and documents show that the federal
[01:09.360 --> 01:14.240]  government for at least five years allowed them to ship ton after ton of
[01:14.240 --> 01:18.280]  pure cocaine into the US quote in exchange for information about other
[01:18.280 --> 01:23.440]  cartels yeah the cartels they're waging war against that aren't part of the
[01:23.440 --> 01:27.160]  cartels that launder the money with the big US banks that have been caught red
[01:27.160 --> 01:31.280]  handed doing it just like our so-called government is down in Columbia for a
[01:31.280 --> 01:35.840]  decade knocking out their competition the head of the New York stock exchange

[08:00.960 --> 08:09.120]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:17.120 --> 08:25.120]  back on April 27th of this year we ran to the headline now the federal documents
[08:25.120 --> 08:29.440]  that were made public and federal court and listeners pointed out to us we ran
[08:29.440 --> 08:35.560]  the news story top Mexican drug lord I trafficked cocaine for the US government
[08:35.560 --> 08:44.680]  written by Paul Joseph Watson for info wars.com and prison planet.com now when
[08:44.680 --> 08:49.200]  I got off the air yesterday Aaron ran over Aaron Dykes and he said you haven't
[08:49.200 --> 08:53.120]  seen this and I said no he goes well it's been on info wars all day our link
[08:53.120 --> 08:57.880]  to it and so I read the report did some more research and I said I think we
[08:57.880 --> 09:03.320]  reported on this and I went and looked it up and we sure did the part that the
[09:03.320 --> 09:13.280]  El Paso Times does not cover is that he and others he's associated with this
[09:13.280 --> 09:21.040]  cartel have said they also were involved in getting guns and were involved in
[09:21.040 --> 09:26.840]  Fast and Furious and this nexus is it in now the Associated Press Florida papers
[09:26.840 --> 09:32.280]  of course broke it I don't know two three weeks ago have all reported that
[09:32.280 --> 09:38.200]  Fast and Furious ATF E alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives are always
[09:38.200 --> 09:43.600]  adding new things onto their name and the FBI and DEA have been involved
[09:43.600 --> 09:49.160]  shipping thousands of guns not just to Mexico but to Miami and other areas to
[09:49.160 --> 09:57.800]  select gangs that are waging covert wars against drug cartels that are not
[09:57.800 --> 10:10.280]  paying their cut and I talked about of course the Reuters report back in 1999
[10:10.280 --> 10:18.080]  when Richard Grasso then head of the New York Stock Exchange traveled and it
[10:18.080 --> 10:21.320]  mentioned well there's a little known federal law that actually drug money
[10:21.320 --> 10:26.280]  from overseas can be invested in US banks and the stock market and he was
[10:26.280 --> 10:30.120]  there encouraging and it showed them meeting the head of the FARC you can
[10:30.120 --> 10:33.280]  dig up the photo the head of the FARC guerrillas down in Columbia big big
[10:33.280 --> 10:37.160]  beard I forget his name you can look it up and he said invest with us or you're
[10:37.160 --> 10:40.800]  gonna be invaded they gave me a year he didn't invest they ended up killing him
[10:40.800 --> 10:44.960]  and the worst US military invaded down there called it drug interdiction and
[10:44.960 --> 10:49.440]  it's admitted that they have grids they fly where the government-grown cocaine
[10:49.440 --> 10:53.680]  that's laundered through the US is left alone and then they find FARC fields of
[10:53.680 --> 10:59.360]  coca and those are sprayed so it's a business operation and the list goes
[10:59.360 --> 11:02.600]  on and on Vietnam and the coffins full of heroin confirmed congressional
[11:02.600 --> 11:07.440]  hearings the 1980s Iran Contra shipping guns down there to knock out the drug
[11:07.440 --> 11:13.480]  competition ship the cocaine back the 1996 or was it 97 we're playing the
[11:13.480 --> 11:19.600]  clips on the radio of the CIA inspector general admitting yes the CIA
[11:19.600 --> 11:25.960]  shipped in drugs this is all on record and Gary Webb of course broke it and
[11:25.960 --> 11:29.320]  won the Pulitzer prize for it had a new book coming out it was gonna doubly
[11:29.320 --> 11:32.920]  prove it what five six years ago and he had to move his house is being broken
[11:32.920 --> 11:36.440]  into he said he was being threatened he told many people that including Freya
[11:36.440 --> 11:39.680]  Ricky Ross who's now out of prison we had Ricky Ross on from prison to talk
[11:39.680 --> 11:44.360]  about it he from memory told Celica still he was being threatened he told me
[11:44.360 --> 11:48.760]  that he asked me to get all these documents and and put it up on a website
[11:48.760 --> 11:54.160]  for him it was public stuff he sent us a desk my wife kept saying we got to get
[11:54.160 --> 11:57.800]  this up but back then I had almost no internet technical skills in fall wars
[11:57.800 --> 12:02.680]  was you know had a lot of visitors but we never even got it up none of it was
[12:02.680 --> 12:05.920]  secret it was just stuff that he put in public presentation so I'm gonna say
[12:05.920 --> 12:08.880]  that somebody comes and kills me I don't know where that disk is it's where I've
[12:08.880 --> 12:14.120]  dropped the ball so many times but they of course came to his house and shot him
[12:14.120 --> 12:19.760]  twice in the head with a shotgun now continuing here so so they don't want
[12:19.760 --> 12:25.160]  this information known but they can't hide it anymore this information cannot
[12:25.160 --> 12:33.680]  be hidden anymore and so what's now happening is and we've shown you the
[12:33.680 --> 12:40.160]  ABC newscast the CBS newscast the Fox newscast where they go yes the army and
[12:40.160 --> 12:44.040]  the Marines in Afghanistan now 90 plus percent of world opium production it was
[12:44.040 --> 12:47.960]  around 10% before the liberation boy they've sure liberated them now are
[12:47.960 --> 12:52.760]  giving them the fertilizer giving them security and helping them pipe in water
[12:52.760 --> 13:00.200]  even to grow more opium so we get a lot of people addicted so the banks can get
[13:00.200 --> 13:04.920]  even more money and then more stereos and computers and jewelry and cars can be
[13:04.920 --> 13:09.320]  stolen by the addicts so that then they can grab the addicts and put them in
[13:09.320 --> 13:14.360]  prison for 10 15 years working for 25 cents an hour in slave labor to drive
[13:14.360 --> 13:18.920]  down wages and displace the country overall economic future and of course if
[13:18.920 --> 13:23.000]  you look at the big three or four mega private prisons they're all subsidiaries
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.840]  of the big six mega banks who openly launder the drug money so the drug
[13:26.840 --> 13:31.560]  dealers ship the drugs in use the police to knock out their competition and then
[13:31.560 --> 13:36.200]  put the users in prison when they're caught using the product they shipped
[13:36.200 --> 13:39.880]  in using for slave labor it's a program where you make money consolidate power
[13:39.880 --> 13:45.360]  corrupt police all the way down the line and it works really well now going
[13:45.360 --> 13:49.120]  back what five six years ago the interviews are all public Celica still
[13:49.120 --> 13:54.880]  high level well the highest level D agent in all of Latin America former
[13:54.880 --> 14:02.480]  sniper Vietnam then later a police officer he comes out and says here's the
[14:02.480 --> 14:07.880]  deal this is what I've been told by my DEA contacts and my Los Zetas contacts
[14:07.880 --> 14:12.400]  their Mexican military trained at Fort Benning Georgia School of Americas and
[14:12.400 --> 14:17.560]  they're going to start a war down there as soon as Calderon gets elected he said
[14:17.560 --> 14:20.760]  he will be elected it's going to be staged and they're going to knock out
[14:20.760 --> 14:24.000]  the three or four cartels that are big that won't pay their money into the
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.840]  United States just like what's happened with the FARC in Columbia and of course
[14:29.840 --> 14:34.800]  he's one of the main sources for the work of Pulitzer Prize winner Gary Webb
[14:34.800 --> 14:40.080]  and he wrote the book powder burns now out of print but the the point is is I
[14:40.080 --> 14:43.720]  believed him but I still was like man this is wild I mean they're gonna have a
[14:43.720 --> 14:47.720]  total collapse in Mexico and then that's gonna be used to start collapsing the
[14:47.720 --> 14:51.840]  Southwest well then a few about a year after he said that the SPP documents
[14:51.840 --> 14:55.520]  got released the judicial watch soon got the North American Union Security
[14:55.520 --> 15:00.600]  Prosperity Partnership documents from the BAMP Canada meeting in 2006 they got
[15:00.600 --> 15:04.880]  them in 2007 it's in my film in game and they said we'll use flu fears terror
[15:04.880 --> 15:10.000]  fears and collapsing Mexico to create a continental security perimeter well
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.040]  earlier this year Obama publicly created that continental security
[15:14.040 --> 15:18.120]  perimeter in the name of fighting the collapse of what's happening in Mexico
[15:18.120 --> 15:23.520]  and the guns and the drugs and the murder and Shelley said six years ago that
[15:23.520 --> 15:26.800]  the government was shipping guns in before that the ATF set him up three
[15:26.800 --> 15:29.600]  years ago he said on this show and those interviews are all there in the
[15:29.600 --> 15:34.040]  articles that they were accelerating shipping guns in and they were gonna
[15:34.040 --> 15:37.960]  blame the Second Amendment and he went and protested and made a big stink about
[15:37.960 --> 15:42.080]  it and for years he went to gun shows because I've been at the gun show with
[15:42.080 --> 15:45.120]  him here in Austin usually didn't even have guns to sell and sold bumper
[15:45.120 --> 15:50.000]  stickers t-shirts his book and then he needed money because he's a retired
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.280]  DA school teacher living in a trailer down in South Texas and he started
[15:55.280 --> 16:00.920]  selling off his gun collection and what former cop doesn't have 50 guns you know
[16:00.920 --> 16:04.920]  what the government called an arsenal and so he began selling a shotgun a rifle
[16:04.920 --> 16:09.280]  to get money he even you know talked about it you know a divorced guy again
[16:09.280 --> 16:13.000]  he in his own words living in a trailer school teacher South Texas that's what
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.640]  happens do you know not since bad live in a trailer but the point is he needed
[16:15.640 --> 16:21.520]  money so boy they set him up for selling a couple shotguns legally a private
[16:21.520 --> 16:24.720]  sale they said that he was really a gun dealer and it was all a big setup they
[16:24.720 --> 16:27.840]  sent him to prison and we you the listeners really tried to help him out
[16:27.840 --> 16:32.920]  with his with his defense and so I don't want to thank you for doing that I
[16:32.920 --> 16:36.480]  know it's a thankless thing when you a lot of times help people but we do
[16:36.480 --> 16:39.920]  appreciate you but they still send him to present and so that's what came out
[16:39.920 --> 16:44.720]  of it so we're on record breaking all of this down and here we are top Mexican
[16:44.720 --> 16:54.840]  drug lord I traffic cocaine for the US government and that is the report up at
[16:54.840 --> 17:01.880]  info wars.com April 27th 2001 and it goes on the logistical coordinator for
[17:01.880 --> 17:06.280]  the top Mexican drug trafficking gang that was responsible for purchasing the
[17:06.280 --> 17:13.400]  CIA torture jet that crashed with four tons of cocaine on board back in 07 was
[17:13.400 --> 17:17.400]  told as told the US district court the North District of Illinois in Chicago
[17:17.400 --> 17:23.000]  that he has been working for the US government asset for years Jesus
[17:23.000 --> 17:37.040]  Vinton Zambala Nabila is the son of El Mayo Zambada Garcia one of the top kingpins of the Sinaloa drug
[17:37.040 --> 17:40.960]  trafficking organization and it goes on to say that you know he released the
[17:40.960 --> 17:44.560]  documents at federal court kind of like Hal Turner released the documents at
[17:44.560 --> 17:47.720]  federal court that he really wasn't a white supremacist leader for the last
[17:47.720 --> 17:52.480]  decade attacking yours truly every week but that he was a national security
[17:52.480 --> 17:58.000]  agent highest level top secret for the FBI and then the FBI testified yes he is
[17:58.000 --> 18:02.200]  our man please don't send him to prison and the judge said I don't care he
[18:02.200 --> 18:06.600]  threatened state judges he's going to jail so they certainly and of course they
[18:06.600 --> 18:11.360]  went ahead and burned him after hackers got into Hal Turner's computer
[18:11.360 --> 18:16.720]  Patriots by the way and did release the fact that he was a federal agent at above
[18:16.720 --> 18:22.520]  the highest level a national security level agent not even known to exist
[18:22.520 --> 18:27.160]  publicly until then in the FBI it's the same thing with this guy it doesn't
[18:27.160 --> 18:31.880]  matter if he was running Fort Benning Georgia trained commandos in Mexico to
[18:31.880 --> 18:35.960]  consolidate the drug trade and make sure the price has got jacked up they don't
[18:35.960 --> 18:40.800]  like prices falling doesn't matter the truth doesn't matter it will continues
[18:40.800 --> 18:43.720]  like a Raul de Rivera stands there within a Marine Corps Colonel and says you
[18:43.720 --> 18:48.640]  help grow the open he says I sure do it's for America you bet it's for your
[18:48.640 --> 18:54.800]  children now continuing documents feds allegedly allowed Sinaloa cartel to move
[18:54.800 --> 18:58.720]  cocaine into u.s. for information you always love the spin when they get caught
[18:58.720 --> 19:01.920]  they're like well yeah well we've been doing this so he give us info on other
[19:01.920 --> 19:06.560]  cartels yeah that you're knocking out five years they admit u.s. federal
[19:06.560 --> 19:11.320]  agency allegedly allowed the drug trafficking cartel to bring in tons
[19:11.320 --> 19:14.600]  and several tons of cocaine the United States in exchange for information about
[19:14.600 --> 19:18.640]  rival cartels according to court documents filed in the u.s. federal court
[19:18.640 --> 19:25.480]  the allegations are part of the defense of a Sente Zamba doll keeper is
[19:25.480 --> 19:31.520]  pronouncing this Zamba a doll nabella who was extradited the United States to
[19:31.520 --> 19:35.640]  face drug-trafficking charges in Chicago the court in Chicago held a
[19:35.640 --> 19:39.760]  status there today and ordered the u.s. government to respond to the motion
[19:39.760 --> 19:44.560]  containing the allegations and it goes on with the documents and so it breaks it
[19:44.560 --> 19:49.180]  all down so here you have it and other big drug cartel leaders have come out
[19:49.180 --> 19:52.440]  and said yes we were involved in this same group and the government would

[23:46.280 --> 23:48.920]  Anderson I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our

[24:39.200 --> 24:43.600]  the way we've been talking to their folks and we were gonna get on yesterday
[24:43.600 --> 24:48.720]  time zone issues and I wanted to have some time before we got them on so we
[24:48.720 --> 24:52.480]  could queue up some music and properly reducing but he's scheduled to be on
[24:52.480 --> 24:55.440]  this hour or next hour if not I'm sure we'll get him on the next few days
[24:55.440 --> 25:02.040]  prodigy of mob deep iconic you know top rapper hip-hop and the reason I'm
[25:02.040 --> 25:04.840]  interested in getting on is because he's spoken out for 9 11 truth very
[25:04.840 --> 25:09.360]  eloquent Lily he's exposed all these Jay-Z and others always talking about the
[25:09.360 --> 25:13.920]  Illuminati and you know pushing that out there like it's a good thing he's a
[25:13.920 --> 25:17.680]  really stepped up and criticized that so I want to get him on the show I look
[25:17.680 --> 25:22.360]  forward to it but once something goes haywire like it did yesterday who knows
[25:22.360 --> 25:26.160]  it will be today or tomorrow sometime in the future but we're we're lining that
[25:26.160 --> 25:32.720]  up had it absolutely set last night to be on a little after 11 12 Eastern but
[25:32.720 --> 25:38.480]  it may be a time zone issue we'll see what comes up with that now getting back
[25:38.480 --> 25:48.200]  to the issue of the El Paso times this has been reported on by info wars comm
[25:48.200 --> 25:53.760]  then a few days later the new American magazine an excellent job breaking it
[25:53.760 --> 25:59.520]  down as well and finally mainstream news has reported on this and he's entered in
[25:59.520 --> 26:03.880]  to the federal record that he was working for the US government and allowed
[26:03.880 --> 26:09.120]  to ship narcotics in well this is exactly what Selika still and others told
[26:09.120 --> 26:17.480]  us more than five years ago and it's the same reports that we've got now coming
[26:17.480 --> 26:24.960]  out and and again we have those articles up at info wars comm where top
[26:24.960 --> 26:29.880]  Mexican drug cartel leaders say that they were actually delivered guns by the
[26:29.880 --> 26:34.440]  ATF and other branches of the federal government and now the head of the ATF
[26:34.440 --> 26:38.800]  has admitted that he had lied when he said he didn't know anything about it
[26:38.800 --> 26:43.280]  and that he was ordered to do so by the Attorney General Eric Holder Holder then
[26:43.280 --> 26:47.280]  said no I didn't order that and then later documents were released that indeed
[26:47.280 --> 26:51.280]  he did know and that the White House did know and of course we've played the
[26:51.280 --> 26:55.520]  clips from C-Span of the testimony and it turns out of course as I had
[26:55.520 --> 26:59.400]  remembered a year and a half ago they'd given press conferences admitting that
[26:59.400 --> 27:03.400]  they'd been doing a gun tracing program into Mexico and did know about it but
[27:03.400 --> 27:06.680]  that was when they were putting their spin on it ahead of time so by his own
[27:06.680 --> 27:10.920]  admissions the Attorney General has perjured himself to Congress now we've
[27:10.920 --> 27:16.040]  learned they've shipped them guns into Florida California Illinois other states
[27:16.040 --> 27:23.840]  to select cartels and that's what's so scary about this is that in most major
[27:23.840 --> 27:29.040]  cities the police are deployed only to go after and then a compartmentalized
[27:29.040 --> 27:36.120]  small-time people and then of course medium-sized players that aren't paying
[27:36.120 --> 27:42.480]  their cut in but more often than not another drug gang is dispatched to
[27:42.480 --> 27:47.000]  simply murder the other drug dealers and then the police turn to blind eye and
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.560]  it's time as a nation to grow up to just how corrupt we become and this didn't
[27:52.560 --> 27:58.880]  start yesterday if you look at prohibition in the 20s alcohol use more
[27:58.880 --> 28:03.600]  than tripled government's own numbers and the profits more than tripled and all
[28:03.600 --> 28:08.360]  sorts of alcohol poisoning happened the police became incredibly corrupt that's
[28:08.360 --> 28:10.960]  how they corrupted the cops you really couldn't get cops be part of drug
[28:10.960 --> 28:14.880]  dealing at the time because drugs were sold at drug stores over the counter it
[28:14.880 --> 28:18.800]  wasn't even an issue drug use was a lot lower it was seen as a illness as a
[28:18.800 --> 28:24.480]  disease have you ever dig in to old junk piles out in the country I know I know a
[28:24.480 --> 28:27.320]  lot of folks do it and I've done it because you can sell the bottles because
[28:27.320 --> 28:33.440]  of their antique and you know the old medicine bottles and old Coca-Cola bottles
[28:33.440 --> 28:37.640]  and things sometimes the bottles are worth hundreds of dollars a piece the
[28:37.640 --> 28:41.200]  point is you dig in the old trash piles and you'll just find anywhere you dig
[28:41.200 --> 28:44.240]  you'll find in the middle of nowhere out in the countryside a lot of them
[28:44.240 --> 28:48.360]  bottles oh you got a headache you got the flu drink some of this it's opium
[28:48.360 --> 28:54.280]  Coca-Cola had cocaine in it a lot of it in it that's why it's called coke if you
[28:54.280 --> 28:57.760]  don't believe me just look up the history of Coca-Cola and cocaine sometimes I
[28:57.760 --> 28:59.960]  talk about that people don't believe me because they're ignorant they're like
[28:59.960 --> 29:03.920]  Coca-Cola doesn't have cocaine in it I'm not saying it has it in it now it's been
[29:03.920 --> 29:09.280]  taken out since the late 1930s well it's been like decokinated it still has
[29:09.280 --> 29:14.960]  cocaine flavoring the flavor of Coca-Cola and Pepsi is Coca that's the
[29:14.960 --> 29:23.960]  secret ingredient is decokinated like decaffeinated cocaine but here it is just
[29:23.960 --> 29:27.840]  just out in the open not with a bang but with a whimper yeah it's coming out in
[29:27.840 --> 29:32.240]  court he's giving them some documents they work for the US government and you
[29:32.240 --> 29:36.600]  know ran this big aircraft operation and oh what do we have in Bloomberg from
[29:36.600 --> 29:43.760]  last year 376 billion dollars in laundered drug money by the by Wachovian

[33:12.680 --> 33:31.120]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[33:31.120 --> 33:36.160]  you know I just spent the last 20 minutes or so getting into so-called
[33:36.160 --> 33:40.640]  government drug dealing but saying government you know gives it too much
[33:40.640 --> 33:44.680]  respect these are rogue criminal elements that have taken over our
[33:44.680 --> 33:50.760]  government and now instead of denying that they traffic the narcotics they
[33:50.760 --> 33:57.000]  think you're so weak-minded that they have ABC CBS Fox and others in the last
[33:57.000 --> 34:03.120]  year come out and go yes it's true we help grow the opium I mean it's so
[34:03.120 --> 34:07.120]  industrial it's so huge that they're giving them the fertilizer the
[34:07.120 --> 34:12.040]  transport the security reportedly been having troops dig and help plant it when
[34:12.040 --> 34:16.600]  they need help during harvest the troops are given a little extra cash this is
[34:16.600 --> 34:19.800]  part of the corrupting of the troops and the government's like look we had to
[34:19.800 --> 34:24.880]  kill Pat Tillman over this he didn't go along with it we had to murder him we
[34:24.880 --> 34:29.680]  got caught doing that what do we do and they go you just go public with it you
[34:29.680 --> 34:33.440]  just go public and go oh yeah I'm barbecuing kids on the backyard it's no
[34:33.440 --> 34:41.120]  big deal and that's what they've done and they get herald to up there to go the
[34:41.120 --> 34:44.800]  patriotic duty let's cut to the Marine Corps Colonel with all the troops
[34:44.800 --> 34:47.560]  standing around looking freaked out because the troops were like what are
[34:47.560 --> 34:51.480]  we doing here what are we doing here growing this opium shut up or they'll
[34:51.480 --> 34:55.360]  frag you everybody knows you know that the bosses up top are getting a big
[34:55.360 --> 35:01.440]  piece of this I know but it's just wrong hey go along you'll get a piece of it the
[35:01.440 --> 35:05.520]  commanders are like look this this operation is so big what do we do well
[35:05.520 --> 35:09.200]  the American people are so dumb now we'll just come right out and say we're
[35:09.200 --> 35:13.000]  helping grow it and that it's to fight al Qaeda and they'll buy it I mean look
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.600]  they let the TSA stick their hands down their pants they let us put radioactive
[35:16.600 --> 35:21.480]  isotopes in the sodium fluoride in the water why not they love it the public
[35:21.480 --> 35:24.240]  hasn't even noticed that their cancer rates have doubled in the last 10 years
[35:24.240 --> 35:28.720]  and their diabetes rates they haven't even noticed that we've stolen 27 trillion
[35:28.720 --> 35:34.560]  man erupting them so we might as well just ship it in publicly in fact we
[35:34.560 --> 35:37.560]  ought to just have stores where the government openly sells heroin and
[35:37.560 --> 35:41.280]  cocaine and then we'll even bring it into schools and have it as part of the
[35:41.280 --> 35:44.120]  school lunch program to inject the children but as soon as the child
[35:44.120 --> 35:48.960]  injects the heroin then we'll have an officer arrest them in fact that sounds
[35:48.960 --> 35:52.280]  like satire but I think that's the level it's coming to next where you'll be
[35:52.280 --> 35:58.000]  ordered to inject your child with heroin but then you'll be arrested after
[35:58.000 --> 36:03.760]  your order to inject it I mean that is basically what this has come to and it
[36:03.760 --> 36:11.160]  will continue it will not stop it is going to intensify oh my gosh okay I've
[36:11.160 --> 36:19.160]  got a lot of other news that I want to cover here but that's why I get mad when
[36:19.160 --> 36:23.560]  I pull up to a checkpoint it's happened I don't know three or four times over the
[36:23.560 --> 36:29.400]  years and the police asked to search my car and I just look at them and I say
[36:29.400 --> 36:36.480]  for what they said you have any guns knives other objects drugs I just look
[36:36.480 --> 36:40.000]  at them and I just say you're not stupid you know the government brings the
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.280]  drugs in and I don't use your products now you go get a drug dog and I know
[36:45.280 --> 36:49.360]  that your drug dog is big and fat and alerts every time you bring it you
[36:49.360 --> 36:54.160]  claim probable cause because it gets a biscuit I understand that but you want to
[36:54.160 --> 36:57.440]  go ahead and search you know about 50 other cars while that happens or go get
[36:57.440 --> 37:03.040]  the drug dog and let's just do this now one time I let him search it because I
[37:03.040 --> 37:06.640]  had to get to the radio station I was on in like 30 minutes this is gonna be like
[37:06.640 --> 37:10.960]  14 years ago and I wasn't even a checkpoint I got pulled over on 183
[37:10.960 --> 37:18.200]  north the time and I was over there at KJFK and the cop pulled me over and he
[37:18.200 --> 37:23.200]  looked he was I want to search this car and I just said okay please hurry I got
[37:23.200 --> 37:26.600]  to get to work and as soon as I do that he said oh that's all right you can go
[37:26.600 --> 37:30.520]  but again probably not even a corrupt cop he was just wanting to see if I had
[37:30.520 --> 37:34.600]  something so I might go ahead and then he could see that I could care less I
[37:34.600 --> 37:40.040]  just wanted to get out of there so he left me alone but look I don't use your
[37:40.040 --> 37:46.880]  products let's get that straight I use the CIA's products two times when I was a
[37:46.880 --> 37:53.000]  teenager once at a party and once at a basketball court and both times it felt
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.600]  like I just been through a traumatic experience you know that feeling after a
[37:56.600 --> 38:00.120]  really bad car wreck and you're wide awake and feel kind of dirty in your
[38:00.120 --> 38:04.520]  brain like like everything's grungy that's what your product cocaine makes
[38:04.520 --> 38:10.160]  me feel like it makes me feel like hell it destroys my confidence but I'm told
[38:10.160 --> 38:14.360]  people that don't have confidence they like it for me it's like hell on earth
[38:14.360 --> 38:21.320]  same thing with marijuana every time I've smoked it it just makes me feel
[38:21.320 --> 38:27.240]  depressed and paranoid except once and I was told that was some type of super
[38:27.240 --> 38:32.080]  medical grade stuff and and by the way you're like oh my gosh marijuana just be
[38:32.080 --> 38:37.040]  honest about it demystify it cocaine's horrible methamphetamines horrible
[38:37.040 --> 38:41.600]  the Valium's horrible all these drugs are horrible whether they're over the
[38:41.600 --> 38:45.600]  counter prescription any of this stuff whether it's it's illegal drugs
[38:45.600 --> 38:52.760]  demystify it it's what losers do demystify be getting drunk is being
[38:52.760 --> 38:56.840]  cool like Hollywood notice Hollywood sells drugs is cool alcohol is cool
[38:56.840 --> 39:01.520]  cigarettes is cool that's because it was product placement
[39:01.520 --> 39:08.280]  demystify it all folks it's horrible it's terrible don't ever use it for the
[39:08.280 --> 39:15.720]  first time you want to get high go rock climbing you want to get high go hiking
[39:15.720 --> 39:20.000]  up a whole mountain side when you get to the top you're gonna be high when you
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.880]  get back down to the bottom that night or eating dinner in a cabin you're gonna
[39:22.880 --> 39:27.000]  be you're gonna be high on life or win at business or win in your personal
[39:27.000 --> 39:32.160]  life or go to a swim meet and watch your daughter and son both get the blue
[39:32.160 --> 39:39.200]  ribbon that's gonna make you high having our big story you know stories we
[39:39.200 --> 39:47.040]  break up on the drugs report that gets me high now there are some drugs I like
[39:47.040 --> 39:51.040]  and this this is a bad drug my wife's almost completely off of it I'm trying
[39:51.040 --> 39:57.280]  to kick it and that's called coffee you drink coffee long enough it doesn't
[39:57.280 --> 40:01.840]  even really get you stimulated anymore you just need it to be stimulated so I
[40:01.840 --> 40:06.640]  guess at the end of the day I have a drug problem because I am a depressed
[40:06.640 --> 40:12.160]  zombie and cannot operate without coffee so let's just all demystify it do you
[40:12.160 --> 40:16.280]  put people in prison because they drink three or four cups of coffee a day I've
[40:16.280 --> 40:21.200]  cut back to about two big ones a day now it's at a six or seven I watch down to
[40:21.200 --> 40:25.440]  one little cup in the morning I mean do we deserve to go to prison no it's a
[40:25.440 --> 40:32.680]  serious brain stimulant when somebody old lady drinks some tea do you put her
[40:32.680 --> 40:37.960]  in prison Rush Limbaugh hurt his back got an oxy cotton it's extremely addictive
[40:37.960 --> 40:43.000]  it's a synthetic heroin do we put Rush Limbaugh in prison because he got
[40:43.000 --> 40:48.320]  addicted the brains designed to get addicted no but Rush Limbaugh shouldn't
[40:48.320 --> 40:55.200]  support mandatory sentences for heroin and cocaine as he still does that is so
[40:55.200 --> 40:58.720]  hypocritical and I'm not even here trying to bash Rush I'm just saying
[40:58.720 --> 41:03.320]  you've got to stop being hypocrites in life and we're all hypocrites to a
[41:03.320 --> 41:08.360]  certain extent we all make mistakes we all do things that are wrong we all
[41:08.360 --> 41:12.320]  subconsciously lie even we don't know we're lying we and we'll kind of twist
[41:12.320 --> 41:18.800]  things to not hurt somebody's feelings or you know whatever the case may be but
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.880]  see I've to train myself that when I catch myself later doing something that
[41:23.880 --> 41:28.320]  I'm ashamed of it at least I try to not be like that most people don't even
[41:28.320 --> 41:33.000]  think about it and that's why we've gotten to have a delusional culture it
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.480]  was a big university study that confirmed all the other studies that just came
[41:36.480 --> 41:39.040]  out a few weeks ago that I've attempted to cover I've read the headlines here
[41:39.040 --> 41:43.200]  about studies show peer pressure can make you physically change your memories
[41:43.200 --> 41:49.880]  a brain scan show in the brain that's what a magician does and they've done
[41:49.880 --> 41:53.640]  the studies where you can say here's a blue car here's a red car and then have
[41:53.640 --> 41:57.360]  the authority figure get up there and say this car is red when it's clearly
[41:57.360 --> 42:00.920]  blue and the majority of people if they're told by an authority figure that
[42:00.920 --> 42:06.000]  the car is red when it's really blue will go ahead and say okay it's it's it's
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.360]  red if you say so and that's why I routinely hear national talk show host
[42:11.360 --> 42:16.720]  attack me I can just randomly do go to the dial and hear it that's why I can
[42:16.720 --> 42:22.640]  listen to local radio and say Alex Jones saying our police are dealing drugs I
[42:22.640 --> 42:26.880]  just find it hard to believe that our good officers out on the street are
[42:26.880 --> 42:31.120]  dealing drugs you find it hard to believe the government's been caught over
[42:31.120 --> 42:34.760]  and over again doing it I mean major banks don't get in trouble laundering
[42:34.760 --> 42:40.840]  hundreds of billions a year when they quote get caught I mean what are you
[42:40.840 --> 42:46.080]  talking about and and they always built strong men you know that officer out
[42:46.080 --> 42:50.160]  there clearing up a wreck on the road in the drug dealer and I don't appreciate
[42:50.160 --> 42:55.560]  certain people saying that actually heard a talk show host here in town say
[42:55.560 --> 42:58.840]  that about me there's a pretty good guy knowing but he is a retired police
[42:58.840 --> 43:03.840]  officer you know these people on this station saying that the police deal the
[43:03.840 --> 43:08.880]  drugs I don't appreciate it the police officers work harder out there cleaning
[43:08.880 --> 43:15.240]  up wrecks and risking their lives well obviously the cop change in tires or
[43:15.240 --> 43:22.360]  running red light checks isn't dealing drugs and I didn't say that it's the
[43:22.360 --> 43:27.000]  higher-ups know what's going on and are told what to do by the feds and what to
[43:27.000 --> 43:32.080]  leave alone that's what's on record so stop building strong men I didn't say
[43:32.080 --> 43:37.080]  the cop that's in your church is dealing drugs I didn't say that what I said is
[43:37.080 --> 43:41.680]  they were on record the feds and the higher-ups and the detective vice
[43:41.680 --> 43:45.280]  squads in every major city have been caught over and over again running the
[43:45.280 --> 43:49.120]  drugs and living in million-dollar houses when the beat cops living in the
[43:49.120 --> 43:53.920]  blue-collar neighborhood with a broke-down pickup truck and police should
[43:53.920 --> 43:57.520]  stop putting up with this of course you know what happens when you do what
[43:57.520 --> 44:01.600]  happened to Serpico you get shot in the face what happened to Serpico famous
[44:01.600 --> 44:05.000]  New York cop had to leave the US because of death threats moved to Switzerland
[44:05.000 --> 44:09.880]  played by Al Pacino in the movie Serpico first day on the job he's brought up to
[44:09.880 --> 44:15.200]  narcotics detective been on the force 10 years they go shake down some robbers
[44:15.200 --> 44:19.280]  that have got some stolen diamond necklaces and they give him the
[44:19.280 --> 44:24.640]  equivalent of a three or four month salary diamond bracelet they says I
[44:24.640 --> 44:29.200]  don't want that and they say oh yeah take it although I've had famous detectives
[44:29.200 --> 44:32.400]  from New York on talking about these you know these things that happen they're
[44:32.400 --> 44:36.520]  like you're not gonna take that just just do it even if you don't just in
[44:36.520 --> 44:43.640]  middle make the guys feel better that's called a corruption and remember the
[44:43.640 --> 44:48.080]  tens of billions by the end of it I think was like 60 billion pull it up
[44:48.080 --> 44:54.200]  pallets of money flown and flown in tried billions on pallets flown into
[44:54.200 --> 44:58.000]  Baghdad and then at first it was 20 and then 40 and then 60 I forget the last
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.120]  number and I talked so many military personnel including folks that are known
[45:02.120 --> 45:05.320]  to me personally for many years I'll just leave it at that and that's what
[45:05.320 --> 45:10.160]  happens if you're just a regular sergeant they go hey you know the captain
[45:10.160 --> 45:14.560]  calls you in or the Colonel calls you in you know what you've been working hard
[45:14.560 --> 45:19.920]  it's tough our military doesn't get paid enough over here here's $10,000 just to
[45:19.920 --> 45:23.360]  help your family and of course you're only you're not paid enough to live the
[45:23.360 --> 45:28.000]  contractors are being paid $180,000 on average the combat contractors you're
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.640]  getting paid maybe 25 30 thousand a year if you're lucky you know your wife's
[45:31.640 --> 45:35.520]  calling up saying we're bankrupt we can't live there's inflation so you want to
[45:35.520 --> 45:41.080]  take it the minute you take that now you're corrupted yeah there's one of
[45:41.080 --> 45:45.560]  the older articles 2007 it's a lot more now London Guardian how the US sent $12
[45:45.560 --> 45:50.720]  billion in cash into Iraq and watched it vanish
[45:50.720 --> 45:55.000]  special flights brought in tons of banknotes which disappeared into the
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.960]  war zone yeah and it went to the different rival groups not to fight the
[45:57.960 --> 46:05.960]  US forces and NATO forces and Brit you know allied forces to be technical but
[46:05.960 --> 46:09.360]  by the time I know you can pull it up try that headline but just put 40 billion
[46:09.360 --> 46:16.480]  in there see if you can find that one I know I read those numbers now if you're
[46:16.480 --> 46:21.640]  higher up your Colonel they call you and say you know what here's a hundred
[46:21.640 --> 46:27.000]  thousand dollars in hundred dollar bills and you're like I'm supposed to take
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.560]  this yeah we all are it's it's the George Bush cares about you and Cheney
[46:31.560 --> 46:33.920]  cares and they understand what you're going through and they don't think it's
[46:33.920 --> 46:36.560]  fair what the contractors are getting this is actually what they're told so
[46:36.560 --> 46:41.760]  this is yours now once you've taken that hundred thousand what happens when they
[46:41.760 --> 46:46.280]  send from the Pentagon somebody who wouldn't take the money a army inspector
[46:46.280 --> 46:50.760]  a captain a Colonel a Marine Corps inspector you know how many hundreds
[46:50.760 --> 46:56.800]  have been fragged and they come in and start noticing that contractors are
[46:56.800 --> 47:01.880]  getting you know 15 million dollars for a $500 blue tarp or that the waters
[47:01.880 --> 47:05.120]  rotten that the troops are getting or everything's falling apart and stuff's
[47:05.120 --> 47:08.280]  being stolen out of the warehouses well they get shot in the head that they
[47:08.280 --> 47:15.880]  commit suicide or an IED blows them up or Pat Tillman says I'm not going along
[47:15.880 --> 47:20.880]  with this and they say oh really you're not going along with this and of course
[47:20.880 --> 47:24.840]  what are they going to do when the army coroner who was a Colonel says no he was
[47:24.840 --> 47:29.440]  he was killed he was this was a homicide he was shot it appears at over a
[47:29.440 --> 47:32.240]  hundred yards and that's what the witnesses later came out and said he
[47:32.240 --> 47:36.920]  begged for his life he had behind a rock you know said I'm a friendly and
[47:36.920 --> 47:40.880]  that they knew that and then they went up and shot him at about what would they
[47:40.880 --> 47:47.000]  say six yards away they estimated from the powder burns a three shot m16
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.080]  burst right across the front of his face begging and they went up to the NFL
[47:52.080 --> 47:58.600]  star stuck a gun right up to him and killed him because because after they
[47:58.600 --> 48:01.440]  first shot him into his body armor and he was wounded he got up and waved his
[48:01.440 --> 48:04.880]  arms and said it's me I'm a friendly they kept shooting so he got down and
[48:04.880 --> 48:11.680]  hid they came up and got him that's who runs America okay you need to grow up
[48:11.680 --> 48:16.440]  and understand that and none of us are safe these bankers are gonna implode
[48:16.440 --> 48:23.440]  everything now I've been talking about government drug dealing I've been

[49:39.400 --> 49:43.320]  those to show people that's how they do that online but the point is you've
[49:43.320 --> 49:51.560]  exposed them bottom line what's your take on that I mean to me you know it's
[49:51.560 --> 49:55.760]  definitely it's definitely not a joke man it's a lot of real stuff going on
[49:55.760 --> 50:01.120]  out here in this in this world is secret societies of real you know it's
[50:01.120 --> 50:07.240]  definitely very obvious you know that um they had worked and it's that play in
[50:07.240 --> 50:12.640]  the music industry and the food industry politics everywhere you turn is
[50:12.640 --> 50:17.120]  everywhere you just got to read the signs you know I mean the writing on the
[50:17.120 --> 50:22.880]  wall basically it's all in front of your face you know I'm saying um yeah most
[50:22.880 --> 50:26.800]  people just learn about it and do a little research about it all they'll
[50:26.800 --> 50:30.360]  be able to see like oh wow this yeah understand what's going on you know I
[50:30.360 --> 50:35.080]  mean absolutely you've got the floor lay it out break it down I mean this this
[50:35.080 --> 50:38.720]  reported letter that when you were set up and sent to prison for exercising your
[50:38.720 --> 50:41.880]  second amendment rights I mean did you write this letter and because it's very
[50:41.880 --> 50:48.880]  poignant and you know I agree with much of it so you got the floor yeah yeah I
[50:48.880 --> 50:54.280]  wrote a lot of letters while I was in here man um I was doing this thing for
[50:54.280 --> 51:00.760]  five magazine you know um just writing letters from from prison just expressing
[51:00.760 --> 51:06.600]  myself and and things I wanted to get off my chest and I want my mind and I
[51:06.600 --> 51:12.000]  wanted to let people know and I wanted to show them even though I was inside you
[51:12.000 --> 51:16.880]  know locked in a prison you know I wanted to show them that I still had no
[51:16.880 --> 51:21.040]  fear in my heart you know about speaking my mind and letting people know what
[51:21.040 --> 51:26.560]  time it is there is no reason for me to fear because it's really nothing there's
[51:26.560 --> 51:30.740]  nothing they can do besides kill me and I'm not afraid of that you know I mean
[51:30.740 --> 51:36.680]  like um I don't think right now they had the point where they would take it
[51:36.680 --> 51:41.920]  that far I think they like this plan that they got into effect they didn't
[51:41.920 --> 51:45.680]  affect for hundreds of years or whatever I think it's so embedded in people
[51:45.680 --> 51:49.320]  brains now they got people so brainwashing in the world that they don't
[51:49.320 --> 51:55.000]  even really care anymore you know I mean about people like Alex Jones people
[51:55.000 --> 51:59.080]  like Prodigy like they're like yeah and tell the people what you want we got
[51:59.080 --> 52:02.960]  you people so brainwashed there's nothing you guys can do about it that's how
[52:02.960 --> 52:08.320]  they feel you know I'm saying and when I say they I mean you know the power and
[52:08.320 --> 52:13.320]  instructions that's in place you know that's that's been in the control us you
[52:13.320 --> 52:18.520]  know I mean absolutely I mean looking at it well it's two-fold 30 40 years ago
[52:18.520 --> 52:23.400]  if you talked about this they would give you a fast acting cancer they would
[52:23.400 --> 52:27.720]  kill you it's on record much of it's been declassified but people still had
[52:27.720 --> 52:31.880]  courage and got the word out and so because so many people spoke out they've
[52:31.880 --> 52:36.040]  now flipped it and said okay we're growing the opium in Afghanistan okay
[52:36.040 --> 52:39.780]  we're shipping the cocaine in okay we're shipping the guns into Mexico to
[52:39.780 --> 52:44.840]  blame the Second Amendment and so they decided just to just go with the
[52:44.840 --> 52:49.880]  revelation of the method instead because they're desperate but if we really try
[52:49.880 --> 52:53.200]  to shake people out of their trance as you and others are doing across the
[52:53.200 --> 52:59.920]  board they we can beat them if we can get people out of the transfer in it
[52:59.920 --> 53:04.600]  definitely definitely you know at the end of the day you know I always say
[53:04.600 --> 53:09.800]  like God always wins at the end of the day you know I mean good always gonna be
[53:09.800 --> 53:14.080]  evil at the end of the day man no matter how bad it's looking you know I mean no
[53:14.080 --> 53:19.320]  matter what's going on you know I mean um good is always gonna win you know I
[53:19.320 --> 53:25.680]  mean um but right now you know I mean the devil definitely got the world in
[53:25.680 --> 53:31.880]  the headlock you know I mean it's crazy it's definitely crazy and it's at the
[53:31.880 --> 53:36.040]  point where they got it they got it so far like I said they don't even care
[53:36.040 --> 53:39.440]  they'll put it they put it all in our face you know I mean the information
[53:39.440 --> 53:44.580]  information age is everywhere it's all over the internet what's going on you
[53:44.580 --> 53:49.560]  know it's all in these books it's in movies it's in you know it's all over
[53:49.560 --> 53:55.800]  the place and they got people so brainwashed you know I mean with with
[53:55.800 --> 54:02.520]  older you know fashion and you know jewelry especially like in the hip-hop
[54:02.520 --> 54:06.760]  world you know in the hip-hop community in the urban communities with well where
[54:06.760 --> 54:11.880]  I can't welcome from you know I mean they got so brainwashed with with with
[54:11.880 --> 54:18.360]  fashion jewelry and like and sex and all this stuff we like we don't even care
[54:18.360 --> 54:24.200]  to even think about what's going on you know I mean like a lot of a lot of the
[54:24.200 --> 54:29.520]  people that I'm around like I look at them sometimes and all they're concerned
[54:29.520 --> 54:34.920]  about is what I just said like the fashion and jewelry the sex all of stuff
[54:34.920 --> 54:39.440]  that materialistic and stuff that like it's not gonna do nothing for a soul
[54:39.440 --> 54:43.400]  what he likes well you've had it all and you know it's not like I've had it all
[54:43.400 --> 54:47.600]  but I mean I've had a lot of success gotten to meet most of them in most of
[54:47.600 --> 54:50.920]  famous people in Hollywood at one time or another and once you meet them and
[54:50.920 --> 54:55.920]  find out that it's nothing it's not fulfilling what what is fulfilling is
[54:55.920 --> 55:01.440]  having truth and information and decency and honor and but but for folks that have
[55:01.440 --> 55:04.880]  never really had some form of notarized your fame which you've had much greater
[55:04.880 --> 55:08.920]  than I have they can't understand it they're they're always scrambling for it
[55:08.920 --> 55:13.240]  reaching for it do you agree with that statement and what can you say to young
[55:13.240 --> 55:17.240]  people and others that feel unfulfilled because they're not somebody making ten
[55:17.240 --> 55:22.320]  million dollars a year like a top rap star man I would say it's not all about
[55:22.320 --> 55:30.840]  that man life life is not about you know that chasing chasing that dream life
[55:30.840 --> 55:36.000]  is about you know I mean being happy you know I mean it's about it's about
[55:36.000 --> 55:42.520]  having you know a pure heart pure soul eating good family you know I mean yes
[55:42.520 --> 55:46.840]  love you know I'm saying like your relationship with your spouse or
[55:46.840 --> 55:51.600]  whatever you know that these are the things that life is about raising your
[55:51.600 --> 55:55.680]  children properly making sure that you know each generation gets better than
[55:55.680 --> 55:59.440]  the last one you know smarter and healthier than the last one all that
[55:59.440 --> 56:03.680]  these are the things that life is about it's not really about chasing on these
[56:03.680 --> 56:08.480]  crazy dreams you know I mean because you know even though people want you know
[56:08.480 --> 56:13.520]  people want success you know everybody wants to be successful you know I mean
[56:13.520 --> 56:18.320]  in life and have some decent money where you could be comfortable and things like
[56:18.320 --> 56:22.960]  that but you know some people really just take it too far and they get caught up
[56:22.960 --> 56:29.360]  in that whole money and success thing you know I mean yes I think it's a well
[56:29.360 --> 56:34.760]  it's a hierarchy of needs success is great as long as you don't compromise to
[56:34.760 --> 56:39.840]  get it and as long as the success itself isn't the goal success in doing good
[56:39.840 --> 56:44.960]  success in beautiful art success in developing things that's wonderful the
[56:44.960 --> 56:50.840]  globalist the controllers create a false success and set up false icons for us so
[56:50.840 --> 57:03.320]  that we'll chase basically it's false idols
[57:03.320 --> 57:10.400]  you know I try to reach out and you know share the information that I know with a
[57:10.400 --> 57:15.880]  lot of people you know I mean stuff that I've read over the years and learn

[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:51.360]  CNN headline we're gonna be getting into some more of this news throughout the
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:56.680]  hour obviously as it develops this is all part of an orchestrated program and no
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:01.560]  puppet George Bush Barack Obama or Mitt Romney is gonna save you it's the
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:06.960]  Federal Reserve or us it's the king dragon rulers of this system they have
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:13.080]  to come down not their puppets now prodigy of mob deep legendary icon of
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:17.560]  hip-hop and ramp is our guest really exposing the Illuminati program and we
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.440]  were getting into you know folks you know coming in and saying we're trying to
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.800]  wake up you know folks and they're not listening it's because they're following
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:32.440]  a false mirage a false culture sold to them by the social engineers but the
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.720]  good news is we're beginning to break through and one of the most common
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.520]  questions I get is get prodigy on you know he's talking about stuff you're
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:43.560]  talking about so here he is sir and you got cut off by the break this is a short
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:47.360]  second you're talking about people have to want it and then let's get into your
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:54.240]  view on the Illuminati and who's running this system yeah so you know like I was
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:02:00.920]  saying you know it's hard to get people to listen and to get people to want to
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.400]  change they gotta want that change on it oh that doesn't ever happen you can't
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:09.120]  force somebody to want to change their life and change that way of thinking to
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:13.320]  understand what's really going on that they've been manipulated their parents
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.640]  and their grandparents have been manipulated you know it's hard to
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.240]  break somebody out of that stuff you know and that way of thinking in that
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:26.720]  and in that belief system you know I mean because they're in a comfortable
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:32.720]  space where you know that it just shatters their whole entire world like
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:38.280]  and they're way of thinking it hurts too much it's way too comfortable for
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.440]  them to just stay the way they are you know what I mean well it's like Neo in
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:47.200]  the Matrix when Morpheus gives him the red pill and he goes look all I'm
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:54.480]  offering is the truth nothing else yeah exactly so you know that's a
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.400]  difficult thing you know and I found that real challenging you know I mean
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:04.640]  growing up and you know dealing with the environment that I come from you know
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:10.000]  that street world where you know it's it's it's a lot of knuckleheads you know
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.560]  I mean it's real difficult to reach them you know I mean so yeah I had to learn
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:21.480]  the hard way that you know I could I just sit back and the people that around
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:26.080]  me that notice what I'm all about and the things that I learned and you know
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:31.800]  the things that I put in my music a lot and those that want that change in their
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:37.480]  life they'll come to me I don't even have to find them you know I mean how did
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:47.280]  you begin to awaken I mean it was it was about 1989 you know I went to high
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:52.200]  school in Manhattan I went to Art and Design where I met my music partner
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:59.040]  have it you know me and back then they used to have these these tables out in
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:04.440]  the street on random corners and like Queens and Manhattan Bronx and Brooklyn
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:09.160]  all the five girls or whatever they said these tables and it was like Muslim
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:16.200]  guys selling books you know I mean or they looked like they were Muslim to me
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.280]  you know I mean because they had on the guard the hats and you know the whole
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:27.120]  get-up whatever so I used to stop at the tables and I used to buy this coconut
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:34.400]  oil I like I smell you know me yes stay there let's come back we've got

[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.280]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or

[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:25.280]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:29.840]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.960]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:35.320]  moving up quick because they're globally devaluing the dollar they're
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.440]  talking about tax increases and super congress this is a tax increase to

[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:20.960]  back to prodigy of mob deep legendary Grammy award-winning rapper who goes
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:25.000]  right back to the start of all the big superstars we have today he was getting
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.800]  into his awakening and he started to you you got to the point of talking to
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:40.760]  folks selling books on the street please continue you know he had he had a
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:47.720]  community in Brooklyn or the answer a lot of community and basically yeah this
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:52.480]  people out in the street selling books and the Muslim oil and different things
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:56.120]  like that like incense and stuff like that I just stopped at the table to pick
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:59.760]  up this coconut oil because I like to have smell you know cuz the girls liked
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:05.760]  it so at the table they would sell these books written by doctor you know man
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.880]  there was a book they were the first books that I've read books on like the
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:17.240]  holidays one book was about Christmas about Easter and showed like the origin
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:25.040]  of these pagan you know evil holidays so I picked it up and I was like what the
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.960]  hell is this because they had one the Christmas book at Santa Claus looking
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:33.200]  like Satan on the cover they were just like strange I never saw nothing like
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.960]  that before you know I was only like 16 I picked up the book and I started getting
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:42.800]  into it and I started learning who back to your kids and what he's about and
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:48.520]  the stuff that he teaches and I started reading a lot of his books you know I
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:56.680]  realized that you know this dude was basically teaching you know people
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:00.880]  especially black people you know about our origin and where we come from and
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:06.720]  how we you know we we have a great history in his world and how we would
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:15.120]  like basically our brainwashed you know and so washed of all of our history and
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:19.960]  who we are and everything that's right if you go back to Roman times no one
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:25.440]  looked at and said black men were inferior I mean that wasn't even you
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.800]  know debated or or discussed and you can lay out your historical review but
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:35.080]  what really from my research to go back 500 years ago they wanted to start this
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:39.040]  transatlantic slave trade and they had indentured servants who were white in
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:43.440]  Europe but they said hey we can use Bible passages and distort them dealing
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:48.360]  with ham and can enable and say that these people deserve to be slaves and
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:52.880]  actually took some selling but because the sailors themselves from Europe were
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.440]  mainly pressed and slaves on the ships if you actually research it I mean most
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.480]  of them were captured and put on the ships to run them that's why there were
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:06.920]  so many people breaking off and becoming pirates that then they sold that idea and
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:12.920]  that really is an idea that didn't exist to what 500 years ago exactly you know
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:23.360]  they they flipped it and a lot of the Bible so-called on Bible stories and all that or whatever so you know Dr. York was just putting it out there you
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:28.280]  know me and really you know exposing it to the world you know and sharing the
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:33.000]  information with everybody and accepting everybody also you know no matter what
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.760]  color you are no matter what race you are it was teaching that this is
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:41.400]  information that need to be you know just that that needs to be put out there
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:45.760]  needs to be learned when did you start learning about the Illuminati because you
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:51.440]  told me you've seen the Obama deception you know the radio show you I said well
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.080]  what's your favorite clip and you said the Bohemian grove the the David Gergen
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:00.800]  situation yeah I mean through his books you know through Doc books that's how I
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.440]  learned about it that's how I pumped into it because you know it all coincides
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.160]  with each other you know me once you start learning the origin of things and
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:13.200]  you start learning you know the background things always going on you're
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:19.600]  gonna stumble on this word Illuminati and you're gonna stumble on you know the
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:25.240]  whole diabolical plan and the whole grand scheme of things of what's happening
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:30.480]  you know I mean so that's how I bumped into it and then you know later on you
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:35.040]  just gotta learn you know I started doing research to me I'm like is this man I'm
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:39.680]  like is this is too unbelievable the information that I was learning was like
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.480]  too incredible you know I mean so it forces you to do your own research it
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.520]  forces you like back then it wasn't no internet when I was growing up you know
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.560]  I mean so I had to go to the library you know I mean check books that's what I did
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:57.480]  the exact same thing so you you've been awake for close to 30 years yeah I mean
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:02.080]  I've been I've been learning ever since I was like 16 I've been learning doing
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:07.640]  research so you know I'm 36 now you know I mean so that's about yeah 20 years you
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:12.720]  know I mean I've been really doing my research you know I mean and studying
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:18.920]  this whole thing you know so I started in the lobby these fun old books and just
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:23.800]  like passing around information they used to get passed around the street like
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:30.280]  different VHS videotapes that a lot of a lot of the people that I knew in the
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:37.360]  street life like a lot of my criminal friends you know they were all just you
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.560]  know just dumb criminal running around a lot of them were very intelligent you
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.040]  know me a lot of them well that's the economy like they say in the godfather
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.960]  that for a hundred years they've been shipping the illegal contraband into
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.960]  those black neighborhoods to make that the zone where it was acceptable so
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:56.040]  people say oh look these people are criminals the point is that's that's the
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:02.120]  the economy that was shut up there by the system exactly you know me exactly
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:06.680]  and it's a um you know it's a stereotypical thing that people look at
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:11.720]  us like I already whatever he said or whatever you know me but anyway a lot
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:15.360]  of my friends you know I mean we would pass around information to each other
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:22.480]  videotapes are like uh I think it was called the movie 92,000 it was just
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:28.600]  crazy so and we used to watch and I had I forget the God's name on there Anthony
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:35.040]  Hilder exactly Anthony Hilda and the other guy with the glasses
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:43.440]  Ted Gunnerson he just died over the weekend oh yeah yeah well well
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:48.560]  Jordan Maxwell oh yeah they used to be on those tapes a lot with Anthony Hilda
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:53.320]  Hilda so we used to watch those we used to pass them around and this is how we
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.440]  got more into it we like damn I started seeing these tapes I'm like hold up this
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:01.400]  is the same thing that Dr. Yorke was talking about so I started the dots
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:07.320]  started connecting you know I mean that I when the internet came around I was you
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.920]  know research all the things that I was learning from Hilda Maxwell York and
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:17.320]  from everybody that I bumped into you your information you know Alex Jones and
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:23.600]  I'm like well everybody is saying the same thing you know me gotta be real you
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.360]  know me and we'll look at skull and bones ABC got footage they're worshiping
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.600]  Satan doing mock human sacrifices then I go into Bohemian Grove here are the
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:35.920]  Christian conservative leaders and corporate leaders worshiping a big stone
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:41.240]  owl and and and bring male prostitutes in and people like oh let them have fun
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:46.920]  the point is they're not who they say they are out in the public they're doing
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:53.200]  all this ritualistic murder and and rituals on little you know they don't
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:59.160]  name a lesson little kids doing sex with satanic sex rituals like this stuff is
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.720]  really going on in this world like you know I mean you got you got you know
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:10.000]  sick people like Jeffrey Dahmer and and different people like that and I believe
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.800]  that it was it was a different background to it why he was doing what he was

[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:43.560]  with and knew who are just constantly selling the establishment view of the
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:49.240]  world nothing but materialism and constantly showing Illuminati symbolism
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:53.480]  okay I mean you talk about why you think they're doing this are they trying to
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:56.680]  brag that they're with the Illuminati do they want to get into the Illuminati are
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:04.200]  they part of the Illuminati and why are you angry about this I mean it got to a
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:08.760]  point in my life where I had to step back and look at my own self you know I
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:13.240]  mean I had to look myself in the mirror like like what are you doing you know
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:18.560]  I mean I was promoting a lot of the wrong things you know and at the same
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:24.320]  time I was putting the information that I was learning to all these books you
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:29.200]  know me from you from you know hell from York and from everybody that I was
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:32.520]  learning from I was putting the information in my music you know I mean
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:37.040]  I was I was like mixing the medicine with the food you know I mean so so they
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:41.400]  wouldn't be able to really taste it but it was in there you know I got it you
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.280]  were going with the bling and you know some of the nomenclature but it was so
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:51.120]  basically people would you come check out the real message exactly you know
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:55.320]  I had to I had to mix it in there somehow to get people's kids to spark
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:59.520]  people's curiosity like hold up probably talking about party and in this net
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:02.640]  but hold up what was he talking about right here what does mean to spark the
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:06.320]  interest I was trying to be strategic about it almost you know I mean to
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:12.360]  spark people's interest and what else I had to say you know man and you know I
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:17.200]  got to a point in my life and my career where you know it's easy to get caught up
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:21.680]  in that lifestyle you know I mean you know fast money and all that type of
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:26.800]  stuff to you know the sex drug and rock a world quote-unquote you know I mean so
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:32.440]  um you know I started slipping at some point and I had to catch myself you
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:35.680]  know me and look myself in the mirror like your dogs what you doing you know
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:40.560]  me like you really bugging right now now it's time to go all the way you know
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:45.120]  I mean cuz you're bugging you know I mean so I had to catch myself and I got
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.920]  to the point where I just got set up and I got pissed off and I said you know
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:55.000]  what I'm not rocking jury no more number one I'm not I'm not doing certain
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.200]  things anymore and I'm doing it to make a statement you know I mean to let people
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:03.320]  say that why is he doing that let's listen to what he has to say you know
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:09.400]  I mean and um basically I started you know looking at the other people in the
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:14.280]  industry and I just started taking out certain things that I've seen like why
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:19.200]  is this person doing this you know Jay-Z was just one example of and one of the
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.840]  biggest examples of you know artists in the music industry you know I mean
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:30.760]  because he's so popular so big you know and the community where he comes from
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:36.640]  out there in Brooklyn this is where you know the guy Dr. York is also from and
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:41.360]  Jay-Z was part of that community the Dr. York community you know I mean he had
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:45.080]  learned all that information that York was putting out all the information that
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.360]  I know you know I mean Jay-Z was learning that also so he knows what time it is
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:54.440]  you know I mean but he just doesn't promote it you say in bottom line in a
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:58.720]  way he's a turncoat you know he knows all this information but he's clearly
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:03.360]  decided to join it he's decided to hey I'm gonna I'm gonna Benedict Arnold

[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:16.720]  chosen sides you know I mean for lack of a better time he he's chosen a side you
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:23.160]  know me and the side that he chose is money power and you know he doesn't
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:27.320]  really care to spread any type of information that might help save somebody

[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:13.040]  points I want to get to now running through these fast sir we've seen
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:18.800]  rappers in the media demonized lately and you were one of the only people to
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:23.600]  actually come to their defense for calling out Obama what's your view of
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:31.360]  president Barack Obama I mean my view on him is that you know number one you
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:35.720]  can't be a president of the United States unless you're part of this bloodline
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:41.120]  that they got going on that goes all the way back to you know me you're
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:46.200]  being royalty you know me who believe that they're related to Jesus and Mary
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:50.720]  Magdalene they're completely delusional yeah exactly you know I mean so they got
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:55.320]  this bloodline going on and whether people believe it or not it's very real
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:36:01.040]  you know you will not be an American president unless you are late and part
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:06.200]  of this bloodline and Obama is you know he's a part of that that's why he was
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:10.680]  allowed in the door and that's why he was placed where he's at now well he's
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:15.480]  related to Cheney and Bush yeah and by the way they're all related to everybody
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:20.240]  else that's been confirmed yeah I mean it's definitely it's definitely a link
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.720]  I heard a lot of people say oh well all humans are related no I'm not talking
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:29.440]  about that I'm talking about you know first third fourth fifth cousins like
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:34.800]  I'm talking about very related like this is your family you know I mean your
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:39.480]  mother is this person's cousins and like I'm talking about real yeah they would
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:43.760]  come to the family reunion that closely related well it turns out that the Bush
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:48.640]  and Kerry particularly even MSNBC to the breakdown it's like I got a French
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:52.080]  Bulldog it's super related to all the French Bulldogs I mean it turns out
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:56.800]  their cousins on every side in every angle third cousins fifth ninth 10th
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:02.480]  15th I mean that's just all related yeah exactly so you know Obama is a part of
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:07.560]  that and whether he knows it or not you know I mean because I don't know that
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:12.440]  man I haven't got a chance to pick his brain so I don't know really I can only
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:18.160]  assume and I can only look at the facts you know me and from what I see you know
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:25.280]  me whether he knows it or not you know he's down with his whole you know
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:30.720]  conspiracy you know me to to rule the world basically he's a part of it you
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:38.480]  know me and you know the brainwashed people and to kill people genocide you
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:42.520]  know me everything that's going on out here that you there's just so fantastic
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:46.160]  you really don't want to believe it you know Obama's down with it you know
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:50.560]  Prodigy what about the fact that he increased the funding for the basically
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:56.000]  forced abortions and population reduction in Africa I mean that's the
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.040]  big litmus test for me any leader because it a matter of your white black you
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:05.680]  know when people are when 52% of black people in America are never born I mean
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:09.880]  that is definitely being targeted and Jesse Jackson talked about this until
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:14.680]  he ran for president and suddenly shut up for me that's the litmus test yeah
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:18.640]  yeah I mean there's a lot of stuff like that going on man it's definitely a lot
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:24.080]  of stuff like that going on and you know it's sad man it's sad that you know when
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:28.040]  when people when the election time was going on when you know Obama was running
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:33.560]  for president I was looking at all the candidates and you know I'm like wow
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:37.880]  this is really a black candidate like you know it was amazing to watch that you
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:42.520]  know man cuz you know I'm I'm black I'm proud of my heritage and it would be
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:45.720]  nice to see that you know I mean that would be a beautiful thing so I'm
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:49.960]  looking at everybody though and I'm watching you know the debates with the
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.720]  candidates when they debate each other and all that and I'm really watching it
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:58.840]  close I'm paying attention to what they saying and what they represent and I
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:04.120]  seem to do Ron Paul and a thing certain things he was saying you know man I
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:10.520]  was a hold up Ron Paul is the only one up here like really exposing people like
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:14.800]  he's really saying something nobody else is saying nothing like him you know me
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:19.520]  and the whole media came after him I one of my staff got a be a professional
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:23.680]  poll call the other day and it was it was it was computerized and they had the
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:27.280]  Republican candidates one through seven with Ron Paul at the end he tried to
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:31.040]  vote for Ron Paul and it wouldn't let him vote and they've caught Fox News
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:36.440]  dubbing in booze over him when he wins the big straw polls absolutely they I
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:40.120]  mean that's where you can tell if the media is behind somebody then you know
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:43.520]  they're bad if the media is against somebody you know they're good
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:48.280]  exactly you know I mean so I put it out there I started doing interviews they
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:52.400]  were like yo you bought your vote for Obama to lose a popular thing in the
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:56.480]  rap community so vote for Obama the first black president he'll be the first
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:59.840]  black you know that was real popular and a lot of people just follow like sheep
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:04.640]  you know I'm sad so they asked me on the radio would you what you vote for I
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:08.880]  said if I was before I would vote for Ron Paul you know I mean and they were like
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:13.280]  what they couldn't believe I said that you know I mean like everybody in the
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:18.080]  hip hop community they were just like oh apology you crazy the first black
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:22.040]  president he's black vote for him cuz he's black I'm like you don't vote for a
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:26.880]  person cuz he's black first of all you know I mean you vote for a person you
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:30.400]  know no matter what their color is you vote for them because of their
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:34.560]  intelligence and what they say they're gonna do and you know what they are
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:38.880]  doing and you know I mean exactly you don't you don't judge somebody by the
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:43.960]  color of their skin but by the character of their deeds exactly you know I mean
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:47.720]  so this is what I was promoting the people and they tried to like almost
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:52.800]  demonize me or like like say oh Potter he's crazy he was wrong with this guy
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:57.280]  he's just oh he's just ranting and he doesn't know what he's talking about you
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:01.800]  know I mean he's a conspiracy theorist and he does this and he does that I'm
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:05.600]  like wow there's that many crazy people as well hey look who's been proven right
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:10.480]  continued the wars the torture the spying the banker behavior I mean it's
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:14.760]  like bush three here or I guess bush was really part three of his dad so I
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:18.600]  guess it'd be part four five bush five here because we all know that when
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:21.920]  Reagan was running things that it was really a bush senior talk about a
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:26.600]  wicked wicked devil on that front running through a bunch of questions here
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:33.840]  and I'm glad Ron Paul was on my list here let's talk a little bit about 9-11
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:44.920]  what's your view on 9-11 9-11 was basically set up you know I mean about a
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:50.160]  definitely by you know this thing called the Illuminati you know I mean that's
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:57.120]  another thing I want to touch on real quick Illuminati is just a word first
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:01.320]  of all you know I mean it means wrong to be enlightened you know the illuminated
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:07.080]  ones or whatever whatever right you know the original Illuminati that the
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:13.560]  original concept you know I mean it comes from you know the essence and
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:18.440]  Egypt and ancient Egypt you know I mean that the original mason's you know I
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:23.440]  mean the Egyptian mystery schools exactly it comes from us and it took our
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:28.880]  information basically and it's using it for evil you know I mean so I just want
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:33.000]  to let people know the origin of this stuff like they've taken our history our
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.920]  you know I mean my ancestors history knowledge information and they're using
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:43.640]  that power which is God's power and using it for evil you know it is true
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:50.160]  that Egypt 6,000 years ago or more was the first with the setup colleges honest
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:57.040]  on astronomy but also farming but also political control and and then of course
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:01.160]  that's why we're buried in coffins I mean it's all Egyptology and then that's
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:05.320]  what the mason's are you know or think they're hoarding the secrets of it and
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:09.520]  then you have really the Illuminati being a modern branch of that and really
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:14.720]  it's a gang of people and of course most mason's or porch mason's aren't even
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:19.240]  aware of it and it's an idea they can see we can't it's like they live John
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:25.840]  Carpenter you know they live we sleep and you put the sunglasses on and now you
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:31.720]  can see and what do they say when you can see I got one that can see exactly
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:37.560]  you know I mean so that word is just a word it's a concept like you said for a
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:40.720]  group of people that are running things that's probably not even their name
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:43.920]  habits you know I'm saying they probably go about different name they probably
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:49.680]  have no name or who cares they call it the council the Supreme Council of 13
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:54.240]  that sits above the Bilderberg group I've confirmed this by multiple high level
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:57.920]  CIA and State Department people and Colonel Craig Roberts and others I
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:00.680]  would never even say it till I'd gotten it confirmed over and over again you
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:05.560]  notice the new super congress is a model of that or a subgroup as above below in
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:09.760]  their rules you have six house six Senate and Obama as the head of the
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:15.760]  council of 13 again Jesus and his 12 disciples the 13 colonies they always
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:32.400]  repeated over and over again
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:48.520]  the bottom line is on not 11 you know I mean they what they did was they killed 20 birds with one stone
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:45:18.480]  they changed people's mentality the way they look at the world they pulled off one of the biggest ritualistic murders you know I mean that ever happened you know I mean live for the whole world to see you know I mean I put a line in one of my songs that they were just playing in the intro about how they lit the pentagram on fire you know the pentagon that's a pentagram
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:40.000]  they said fire that day it's the center of the pentagon of a pentagram yeah so it was on fire like and they only do that in satanic rituals they like pentagrams on fire you know I mean so I think it was more than just over something hit the building whatever I think they really did it on fire for a reason you know they admit that wars are
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:50.760]  ritualistic slaughter that goes back to the Romans with the gladiators it began as a sacrifice but instead of the priest cutting your heart out we have people kill each other in the ring
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:46:07.480]  and the ancient Greek said human sacrifice this stuff does not does not change and for the outer initiates at Bohemian Grove it's mock but then for the inner initiates it becomes real and then once they've compromised you there now you can engage in the mass murder and death openly
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:21.360]  now I've read and I want to see if this is accurate that obviously you have a right to defend yourself a famous wealthy person I mean guys that you know care you know the clothes donut shops it or you know at midnight or you know allowed to carry guns even in cities that have restrictions
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:39.360]  and I've read that you got set up for having a gun to defend yourself a multi-millionaire probably 50 times over I don't know and that and that and again in New York you're not allowed to defend yourself and that's what they sent you to prison for and that that was basically done to punish you because of what you were saying
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:56.360]  well that might be a little extreme to say that you know people might have the wrong idea what really happened everything is not and this is a help this is a help calm people down a little bit to with all the conspiracy stuff you know I mean everything is not a conspiracy
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:13.360]  something's happened because you did something wrong and there's no big conspiracy behind it you know I mean I did something wrong that day you know I mean the street the life where I come from you know it's dangerous man the environment where I come from is dangerous and I'm out there I'm not out there
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:32.360]  trying to hurt people I'm not doing that but you have a right to have a gun I think that was wrong but you know what the gun was illegal that I had you know I mean I have a right to have your gun as long as I follow the steps and follow the law and get it the right way you know I mean the gun I was carrying was illegal it was a legal
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:43.360]  it was a legal fire I wasn't supposed to have it I wasn't licensed to carry you know but see there's only a few spots prodigy where that's the case and a law that's unconstitutional is null and void I don't want to
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:56.360]  I look I would use this example if you weren't here because it's it's a good one it's true you know the first gun laws were against black people in this country after the Civil War they said we can't have those folks be in arms so it started and there's only a few cities
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:12.360]  Chicago New York and others where it's almost impossible to own a gun for me it is it is it is it is crazy to especially be a famous person with all the I bet the stalkers and stuff you've got and to not have a gun I mean listen I got a gun right here with me right now
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:30.360]  and it's not because I'm living in fear I'm living in strength I mean I gotta tell you you were falsely imprisoned and I know it's a way to man up and say well I did wrong I'm not going to say it's you know that I was put in prison but and I don't want to end the interview on that but I mean shouldn't you work to get rid of New York gun laws so everybody can defend themselves
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:50.360]  I mean yeah that would be a beautiful thing there would definitely be a beautiful thing to do that you know I mean yes I think it's pure bull I mean I understand you know it's like good sportsmanship okay I went to jail I'm not going to say I was innocent but I mean well okay I'll use this one on you there been a lot of laws in this country that were unconstitutional haven't there been
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:49:10.360]  yeah you're right about that I can think of a couple right now I bet you can think of some you definitely right about that you know what you know I just wanted to let people know it wasn't like it wasn't like how they came after me because he's talking this stuff in his songs and that's not what happened you know what I'm saying
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:34.360]  now I hear you but but but if you were playing along then it might have gotten dropped and I know that stuff goes on yeah you never know with that you know I mean that it was definitely I'll tell you this much during my trial the arresting detectives came on the stand and they actually lied like cold lied in my trial
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:50.360]  you know I mean it was like a big lie to make sure that I got locked up because it wasn't illegal search it was an illegal search of my car so they got on the stand in the trial and they said oh we saw the gun in his hand we walked up on the car and that wasn't true okay

[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:48.360]  and it was very exciting to learn that over the years he's been a big quote fan of the broadcast know a lot of my crew absolutely loves music I'm familiar with it never have time to really listen to a lot of music but I know about the message and very talented good to have him with us
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:55:04.360]  I'm getting into some really hardcore issues then I'm going to get into the economy Catherine Albrecht's coming up her self battling breast cancer the stock market is just plunging right now still but taking you to Mike Adams of natural news will be in a special report with us tonight
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:22.360]  there at 7pm at prisonplanet.tv in the special report section and also be on the front page they're popping up at 7pm is how you'll be able to see that just at prisonplanet.tv we'll have more breaking news then they rated this place and they took what mangoes
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:30.360]  raw milk raw milk cheese you can buy a whole foods down the street here I know I buy it tastes totally different it's so good
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:42.360]  it was drawn destroyed their stuff right there $120,000 bail rated a dairy also not just the store and this is all operating in plain view it's just like they're arresting Amish now and people selling eggs
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:50.360]  I mean they are coming after everybody hey can't have a garden in your yard hey can't speak at city council hey the police fire the mayor they're God
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:56:06.360]  and then it's in the news that the government not just in fast and furious is bringing the drugs in as well that's in El Paso times today going to Mike Adams here for this segment the next Mike you've got breaking news for us this story just gets crazier by the minute
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:18.360]  yeah we have two pieces of breaking news and you're getting at first Alex this is not just seven minutes off the front lines first piece is you know how you're always talking about the environmental police and how they're going to start cracking down on
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:38.360]  the rain police that's it it's happening in LA County right now news is that the DA of LA County there has refused to prosecute this case so it's being turned over to a special environmental crimes prosecutor who specializes in raw milk crimes
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:52.360]  I mean can you believe this it's actually environmental cops and prosecutors are now coming to the surface and that's what they're going to be prosecuted under because regular DA's refuse to take this they know it's ridiculous they create separate just like they created eugenics
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:57:06.360]  courts to order sterilization 20s 30s 40s 50s 60s in this country now they've created the the green police and remember the mayor of San Francisco saying you've seen those out of commercials with us arresting you for light bulbs we're going to do it that's it
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:19.360]  so this this person James Stewart is going to be charged with 13 counts we don't know what the counts are yet but we know they involve several felony charges and again the conspiracy charge that you already covered yesterday
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:34.360]  now in addition to that we also have news that there is a dis info agent now spreading misinformation across the internet and we suspect but we can't yet prove that that person has been turned by the feds and is spreading false rumors
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:45.360]  of course they go in they tell an employee if you say this you won't go to jail and in my word we've got the alternative media and I would not even cover the dis info but obviously there's going to be insane lies put out
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:55.360]  just like we were lied about when we said that the flu shot was hurting people it was confirmed later to be killing them we were attacked and lied about it's just it's how they operate
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:58:03.360]  another big piece of news that came from the front lines during the protest yesterday that doesn't even count the protest that took people spontaneously confronted them
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:17.360]  they did they did they showed up Mariel Hemingway was there there's an actor let's see Vincent Gallo apparently very popular actor was one of the customers of that or a member of that buying club he was there people began speaking out
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:31.360]  and it was interesting Alex because here we have Hollywood celebrities talking about the police state they're starting to get it they're starting to wake up in a sense they've done us a favor by waking people up to what's really happening
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:41.360]  put the line down sir I will be right back it's the green police stay with us Mike Adams

[01:59:53.360 --> 02:00:01.360]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:30.360]  you got a TDI here clean diesel you're good to go sir that's right there's a checkpoint set up but he's a good little minion and so he gets to go free and then police are arrested because they're eating drinking out of foam cups it's not a joke okay this is already going on in Europe they're already banning the vitamins and minerals
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:50.360]  has nothing to do with the environment Mike Adams more breaking news from the health ranger they have created a new special imperial green police court because the other courts won't do it this is how tyrants work they create new courts and this is spun out of the eugenics courts that's what the whole green movement is Mike Adams please continue
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:01:03.360]  yes so this prosecution is apparently going to take place under this new environmental prosecutor authority we don't even know where that comes from the information right now is a little bit loose because this is breaking news happening right now
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:13.360]  so they tell us radiation from Japan's good they raise the safe level all the toxic stuff BP's great but you try to it's been confirmed they were selling devil mangoes
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:42.360]  right watermelons raw honey mangoes goat milk and goat cheese and remember Alex that the cops went in there and the sheriffs LA county sheriff's department went in there and they began what can only be called a nutritional book burning they began destroying up to $50,000 worth of fresh produce and whole foods and farm fresh eggs pouring the milk down the drain loading up the food and across the street Alex or just down the road
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:56.360]  is a shelter for poor people who need food and so right in the face of people who are starving in America they are destroying food and proving who who's the master and who's the slave
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:13.360]  it's good they tried to put that woman in jail for 93 days for a tomato box in her front yard yeah I mean what type of sick people are you let me tell you something watermelons by the way they are resting people everywhere selling watermelons on the side of the road they don't let little girls have lemonade stands
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:32.360]  now the health department it's total control while the government I mean I was looking at the video of the cops that we posted at info wars dot com you have a natural news and they looked like people I've seen being let off of prison trucks to do work I mean they look seedy oily criminal criminal eyes
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:36.360]  I mean God help this country they've got hardcore crooks working for them
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:50.360]  and what's beautiful about that Alex there is a silver lining to this is that this is now waking up literally millions of people who've been sitting on the sidelines and not believing that this was happening a lot of people who were skeptical about your show
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:03:05.360]  or our website or the things that we were saying now they're seeing oh my goodness this is real well my just like yesterday I sent your article to drudge and you notice it went up and I know that drudge and others listen I'll just leave it at that and we want to thank them for
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:20.360]  you know drudge is getting more and more hardcore we love it and of course it's exploding and popularity as if he couldn't get bigger and hopefully you get a new report out I mean my gosh watermelons watermelons mangoes destroyed and that the special
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:36.360]  environmental court to prosecute for the watermelons and other evil you need to get that report out get it up at info wars dot com and natural news and we will get hopefully some of the big sites to carry it if his lordship Matt drudge sees fit
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:45.360]  well just to clarify I don't know if it's an environmental court or maybe just a special environmental prosecutor who's going who's going to take the case through the regular court system
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:04:00.360]  so I mean it's an environmental prosecutor is what I'm saying absolutely and the other element in this is that there were children who could not feed on their mother's breast milk for a variety of health reasons and they were being raised on the
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:15.360]  raw goats milk that was being sold in the store by the way let me stop you if you go back to doctors even 3040 years ago Germany Europe here they would say get them get raw milk and or they would say get the milk of a Jenny or a female donkey
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:29.360]  they say is even better in matching and that's what the baby needs but no you will drink corn syrup yeah yeah that's right that's right everybody knows in the nutrition field that raw goats milk is the closest thing for to mother's milk
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:39.360]  to an infant and so there are many children in L.A. who today don't have their milk because of what these what I can only call government terrorists yeah I knew the goat was good but
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:52.360]  Jenny's it didn't even better my understanding is that goats milk is is still the best but probably either one is better than pastor you're the expert you're the health rancher going to be with us tonight girls
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:05:00.360]  me in studio to an RT later today from our studios Mike Adams great job for filling this in Catherine on straight ahead you bet stay with us
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:09.360]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:20.360]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:29.360]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:36.360]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:45.360]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[02:05:45.360 --> 02:06:01.360]  one of my old sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365

[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:36.360]  all right ladies and gentlemen we're about to go to Catherine Albrecht who's done yeoman's work out there exposing the total panopticon spy grid as we of course have done for 16 years but now it's it's it's it's beyond RFID chips it's it's just total total surveillance
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:54.360]  meanwhile recession is seen looming as jobless benefits and CNBC that we never left the recession and they knew that and no matter how much money is give the bankers and how much services you cut we're signed on to 1,500 trillion
[02:08:54.360 --> 02:09:13.360]  okay it's impossible to pay we don't owe it in fact if you gave even getting into the math what happened if you gave 310 million americans their percentage of 1.5 quadrillion how much would that be individually it's ridiculous in fact
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:33.360]  if you do that equation divide that 1,500 trillion by 310 million i want to find out how much that is per person if we're going to pay that back how much they say we owe 14 trillion eurozone policy makers fail to extinguish market fire
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:48.360]  future of treasury secretary not certain yeah throw him out throw him under the bus like like that's going to change something when the same megabanks on this country through fraud trichette says eurozone and better shape than us Japan Italian prosecutors these documents from moody's
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:10:08.360]  S&P to find out why they're claiming that europe's and worshipped in the US i remember two weeks ago that was reported on by tarpley here as he reads Italian he speaks Italian will germany save the euro from collapse i mean it is just bedlam and the stock market is down the dow was down
[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:19.360]  171 nasdaq's 93.05 S&P 4205 and i thought it was going to be milk and honey with the debt deal
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:30.360]  you see which actually increases spending and they announced the qe3 continued a dollar devaluation we're going to be covering that as the show goes on but i wanted to get
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:49.360]  over to Catherine albricht here on the broadcast with us well to also find out how her health is going fighting breast cancer and obviously all of us praying for i know i say a prayer every time i think about her and all the other good great people out there that are battling such things
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:11:04.360]  i've got a wife and my mother and my grandmother who's actually battling breast cancer but i shouldn't even got into that the point is is that that i have i have two daughters it's just a terrible thing and then you read about
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:24.360]  the bisphenol and all the rest of it helping contribute to it but there there's so much other news with Catherine albricht that i want to discuss with her today really covering the waterfront she's also radio talk show host and author with just the full
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:35.360]  on assault of control where they used to deny that they were spying on us now it's just out in the open face scanning cameras license plate readers biometrics at the airport
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:48.360]  and her website is Catherine albricht dot com she's also doctor albricht a master's in education from harvard with concentration in technology innovation education Catherine great to have you here with us
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:12:01.360]  Alex it is always such a joy to come on your program and a warm hello to all your listeners they have sent just such beautiful emails and cards and letters of supporters have been battling breast cancer and i just wanted to say warm thank you to everybody out there
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:16.360]  listening i love you guys and it was just an amazing experience to see how much support is out there how enormous alex your audience has grown to become i mean you have listeners all over the world and i know that because i've been hearing from them and i just want to send
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:19.360]  you just my warmest heartfelt thanks to everybody out there
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:33.360]  well absolutely now listen i'm here with bated breath i know you see you gave us a message that on your own show today that you do sometimes during the week but always at least on saturdays you know while you're battling this affliction but i mean i kind of
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:37.360]  i mean give us a preview of what is your health update right now how are you doing
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:48.360]  well the the update is i've kind of picked and chosen the best from both worlds and i know that they're i mean what i've learned there's a raging war going on between the people who are sort of the traditional oncology
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:13:05.360]  conventional medicine folks and you know dare i say at the pharmaceutical industry on the one side that you know the natural alternative health practitioner people on the other side and i guess because i have an academic training as you mentioned i have a doctorate from harvard and i've spent a lot of time learning how to research
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:22.360]  i've kind of picked and chosen the best from both and so in in in my case i have a stage three c breast cancer so for people who who are familiar with cancer that means that the cancer in my breast had actually spread up into the lymph nodes under my arm but it didn't go any further
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:37.360]  and that's the good news if you catch it in time before it actually gets into you know an organ or into the bones or metastasizes and put you into stage four if you catch it in time then actually the conventional treatments and i know this is going to be heresy on your show
[02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:52.360]  but the conventional treatments actually add a tremendous amount to your life expectancy so in my case you know and i i was just as skeptical as everybody else was like oh my gosh i'll never do chemo i'll never do surgery radiation forget it and the more i've actually researched it
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:14:00.360]  because of my case which is what's called locally advanced breast cancer it's not just a little lump it's not just a tiny little thing they do a lump back to me and that's it
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:13.360]  and you know when people get that lifestyle changes diet exercise supplements can make an enormous difference when you've got a big tumor and mine was the size of a mouse alright so i should just picture a mouse that's big
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:22.360]  when you've got a big tumor like that you must get it out of the body because you're putting so much stress and pressure on your body to try to eliminate it
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:36.360]  you can if you if you have the surgery and allow them to remove that factory of cells then you can go on to some of the other approaches to try to get the rest of it out of your body and that's you know it's circulating around it's in my lymphatic system it's in my bloodstream
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:51.360]  and it's trying to get a toehold on another part of my body so in my case what i've done is i actually am part of a cutting edge clinical trial of a brand new drug down at Dana Farber which is one of the top cancer institutes in the country
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:15:03.360]  and that would be my other piece of advice to anybody battling cancer don't just go to your local hospital down the street get yourself even if you have to get on an airplane to a top notch cancer institute or research institute
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:13.360]  there's about a dozen of them across the country md anderson is probably your nearest one down there in texas they're down in houston for me it's Dana farber down in boston both excellent institutions
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:22.360]  you go there and you at least hear what what do you have for me what is my prognosis you know what what is this look like and they'll give it to you straight
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:37.360]  your oncologist oncologist want you to live i don't know about the drug companies necessarily but the oncologist absolutely wants you to live and your oncologist will map out here's what we do here is the best that we can offer from medical science
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:47.360]  and i think anybody who doesn't at least get that consult and that information is missing out on a huge potential resource that could save their lives so
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:58.360]  absolutely if you just go to the country hospital even though they're great doctors they've got 10 20 year old technology it's the big research hospitals where my dad actually worked in high school
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:11.360]  and in college he actually spent a lot of time at md anderson years total they had really advanced stuff even back in the back in the 60s who knows what they've got now but overall then i mean it is all of this helping are you doing better because
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:22.360]  it is because what what i'm doing is i'm on this experimental trial it's it's a drug that's shown a whole lot of promise i'm going to be on it until october of 2012
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:32.360]  so it's a long time so i'm going to be in treatment for a long time most women after like four to six months are done with their breast cancer treatment and get on with their lives and just hope it never comes back for me it's going to be a longer road
[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:46.360]  but i'm feeling great i am supplementing all of this the traditional star the conventional stuff i'm doing i'm taking curcumin i'm alkalizing i'm drinking raw juices i'm doing all of that stuff too and when you put them together
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:55.360]  you know i think that's really when you get the best package and you know i'm going to be writing some of this up i actually had a bunch of people ask me it was on coast to coast last night talking about this
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:17:05.360]  a bunch of people wrote and said can you just write out what you figured out because i can't find anybody else saying this you know they're either saying you know don't do the conventional route get rid of the chemo don't even think about it
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:20.360]  or they're saying you know blow off all these supplements alkalization all this stuff doesn't work and i'm trying to integrate the two so i will be writing that up and you know people want to stay tuned for that i would i would love to you know share that as i get a little deeper into this whole process
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:32.360]  absolutely and i'm just really glad that you're willing to even talk about this now because it affects so many people and all of us have a have a dog in the fight
[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:44.360]  and so and so we're all in eight women alex one in eight women in their lifetime will actually be diagnosed with breast cancer and that's horrifying you know you look at india where where they're in the sun so they're getting vitamin d
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:55.360]  unlike us we're indoors you know type in when our computers are watching tv or in offices in india their breast cancer rates and prostate cancer rates which i guess is the equivalent for guys you know the hormone cancer
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:18:09.360]  they're a fraction of what we have and it's because of the sunlight the vitamin d which you know we can supplement that and it's also because they are eating this rich diet in spices and vegetables and natural foods and things that god put on this earth
[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:25.360]  so you know it's it's amazing to me one in eight women in this country it's it's like i don't know it's it's epidemic but i mean obviously dr albert you've looked at the best thing all day they admit it's hyper feminizing women making them go into puberty early not just all the hormones in the
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:41.360]  meat and then feminizing boys and that it's you know really a reeking havoc and then and then soy i mean this is all stuff you've talked about on your show you've got teflon you know all this crazy stuff that we're just saying oh yeah it's safe or somebody tell me the other day
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:55.360]  i was talking about teflon and they said well i was actually talking to a girl she went and told her mom we need to get rid of our teflon pans and the mom said that's crazy if it were so bad for you it would be illegal to sell it and i'm think i'm rolling my eyes well many
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:19:15.360]  answers have doubled the last decade alone diabetes has doubled the last decade that the one common type and it's a nightmare and ladies and gentlemen we are under eugenics attack and everybody's compartmentalized the doctors the lawyers the teachers but it is the higher ups know fully what
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:29.360]  they've done and i get emails saying hey it's not that bad i go to target now and everything is teflon free yes because katherine albrick and many others educated you hey suddenly they're saying this fiend all free yes because we warned you but it's
[02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:44.360]  still in the juice box linings and all of it folks i told people for years there's uranium in most the floor are they put in your water now that's admitted it takes standing up and saying no and let me tell you i've been lazy i've been unhealthy but i'm trying to get myself healthy
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:58.360]  and trying to have my house 100% organic and clean because i've got three children okay katherine albrick stay there i want to shift gears to cover the waterfront of the panopticon takeover and transhumanism is when i wanted to set you up last week for the show it's because i heard one of your

[02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:57.360]  Of destruction
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:01.360]  Alright, that's our good friend Dave Mustaine, the one the only
[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:06.360]  His metal brain corrodes
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:12.360]  Alright, let's go back to Catherine Albrecht
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:17.360]  I'm out of a little anxiety right now about the stock market even though I'm not in it
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:21.360]  It's connected our entire economy so I tend to goof off when I'm upset
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:29.360]  Catherine Albrecht, I want to cover the whole situation with Google and all their spying
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:32.360]  But now you guys have really developed some great things with StartPage
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:34.360]  We'll do that coming up at the end of the hour
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:39.360]  But let's start getting into transhumanism and how they're pushing it like it's a great thing
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:43.360]  Really selling us eugenics and telling us it's a foregone conclusion
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:48.360]  Cover some of the biggest threats to privacy and really human dignity that we see with the Big Brother system
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:53.360]  You know, that is the culmination of so much of this technology
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:55.360]  And I don't think people quite get the big picture
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:58.360]  And you know, it's hard to when you're right in the middle of it
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:02.360]  Because you know, each thing that comes at you, you see it for the individual piece it is
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:06.360]  But if we step back and look at this forest of trees that we've been creating
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:10.360]  And then take a look at what these transhumanists are actually talking about
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:12.360]  It's all taking form
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:17.360]  And I say that in like the darkest sort of sci-fi horror movie sense
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:21.360]  That all of these little disparate pieces that have been put in place
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:25.360]  You can almost picture them as like, well, we could call them a net, couldn't we?
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:26.360]  We could call them a web
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:28.360]  We could refer to them in all these terms
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:31.360]  You know, what is a net? It's designed to catch things
[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:34.360]  What is a web? It's designed to trap prey
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:38.360]  And we have essentially now created with our technology
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:43.360]  What IBM and HP and a bunch of these companies are referring to
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:47.360]  Is sort of this global life form, this global skin
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:52.360]  And they are envisioning a time when each one of us becomes sort of a node
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:59.360]  In a nervous system of this gigantic, sentient, worldwide global entity
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:01.360]  And it's a really disturbing concept
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:04.360]  I've been saying this for, gosh, 10, 12 years
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:07.360]  And your listeners may know, and listeners to my show know
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:10.360]  You know, I'm a born-again Bible-believing Christian
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:13.360]  I, since the age of 8 years old, was warned about the Mark of the Beast
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:18.360]  And at 8 years old in the 1970s, I had no idea how any of that could happen
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:20.360]  How could you buy and sell with a number? I don't get that
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:23.360]  How could you have a system that would require every...
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:26.360]  They could cut people off from buying something
[02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:27.360]  Well, that's the thing
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:30.360]  It's being sold like it's the best thing to slice bread
[02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:34.360]  The architecture is designing it to track all of us in real time
[02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:38.360]  To manipulate cultures, societies, to gauge systems, as Google says
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:42.360]  To predict mass movements, to predict the future
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:44.360]  I mean, this is about the globalist playing God
[02:27:44.360 --> 02:27:46.360]  And they're selling it like, oh, it's going to empower you
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:48.360]  You're going to live longer
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:51.360]  And sure this stuff could be positive if it was built that way
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:54.360]  But in every case, it's built to totally enslave us
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:57.360]  Well, and not only that, and you totally pegged it, Alex
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:01.360]  But not only that, as a Christian, and I know you are as well
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:05.360]  You look at things that give humans enormous amounts of power
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:09.360]  And you say, that'd be a really great thing if we weren't living in a fallen world
[02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:13.360]  If everybody was great, if everybody was perfect, if everybody wanted the best for everybody else
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:18.360]  And it was above board and ethical, power would be a wonderful thing to have
[02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:21.360]  But as you and I both know, you create power, you put it out into the world
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:25.360]  And what inevitably happens is that people will take it, they'll twist it
[02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:28.360]  They'll abuse it, they'll use it to further their own ends
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:30.360]  And essentially stomp on everybody else
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:36.360]  So what we have now been creating, and I think this idea of sort of the global matrix
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:39.360]  And all the things that you talk about on your show
[02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:43.360]  The power that we have put into the hands of those who would take it up
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:46.360]  Over our own individual lives, the power of surveillance
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:50.360]  The power of knowledge about us, and ultimately it will be the power to control us
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:54.360]  To control everything from the appliances in our home to the thoughts in our heads
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:58.360]  That kind of power has now been created, that is the sort of the promise
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:00.360]  And the threat of technology
[02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:03.360]  And you know, it's funny, I was talking about Facebook the other night
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:10.360]  And I was talking about how Facebook was denying that their facial recognition programs
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:13.360]  Were any kind of a problem, and they said, you know, it's up to you
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:17.360]  Whether you choose to post your face on Facebook or not, totally your decision
[02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:20.360]  You could post an avatar, you don't have to put your face up there
[02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:25.360]  But of course we know Zuckerberg's sister said they want to get rid of anonymity completely
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:26.360]  So everybody's known
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:29.360]  He called his users, you know, dumb idiots, because they trust him
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:33.360]  Look, this is a nightmare system of control
[02:29:33.360 --> 02:29:36.360]  And I want to look at different aspects with it, with Dr. Catherine Albridge
[02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:38.360]  Who really studies these areas
[02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:41.360]  And then I want to get into transhumanist Ray Kurzweil
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:46.360]  And the rest of it on the other side, I'm Alex Jones, GCNLive.com
[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:51.360]  We've got a lot of key news up right now as well

[02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:04.360]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011
[02:31:04.360 --> 02:31:08.360]  We will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years
[02:31:08.360 --> 02:31:11.360]  He says it will change everything about our lives
[02:31:11.360 --> 02:31:14.360]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children
[02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:16.360]  And even how you take care of your health and your own family
[02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:19.360]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:22.360]  The crazy part is, he's usually right
[02:31:22.360 --> 02:31:24.360]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM
[02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:28.360]  Panny Mae, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties
[02:31:28.360 --> 02:31:31.360]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:34.360]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free
[02:31:34.360 --> 02:31:37.360]  Detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[02:31:37.360 --> 02:31:39.360]  And it's a real eye-opener
[02:31:39.360 --> 02:31:40.360]  I can't stress this enough
[02:31:40.360 --> 02:31:43.360]  You should at least watch this free video online today
[02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:45.360]  He explains everything you need to know
[02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:47.360]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[02:31:47.360 --> 02:31:52.360]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:53.360]  That's End of America
[02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:54.360]  The number 3.com

[02:32:00.360 --> 02:32:04.360]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:32:04.360 --> 02:32:09.360]  Number 1. New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:11.360]  Number 2. Our new energies are
[02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:14.360]  Wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:32:14.360 --> 02:32:17.360]  It's true. Total government control of electricity
[02:32:17.360 --> 02:32:20.360]  In the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:22.360]  Number 3. In some areas of the country
[02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:24.360]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:32:24.360 --> 02:32:28.360]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:32:28.360 --> 02:32:32.360]  Number 4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:32:32.360 --> 02:32:36.360]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:41.360]  Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:45.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[02:32:45.360 --> 02:32:46.360]  One of my oldest sponsors

[02:33:08.360 --> 02:33:15.360]  Darker shame, darling, darker shame
[02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:21.360]  Thank you for all the joy and pain
[02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:28.360]  Picture show, second balcony
[02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:32.360]  Was the place with me, second seat
[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:35.360]  Go Dutch street, you were sweet
[02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:40.360]  Darker shame, darling, darker shame
[02:33:40.360 --> 02:33:44.360]  Alright, we're going back to Dr. Catherine Albrecht here in just a minute or two
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:48.360]  And by the way, we're gonna have a bunch of very informative guests tomorrow
[02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:51.360]  We're gonna continue to watch this stock market plunging
[02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:55.360]  In fact, if you guys will put back on the PrisonPlanet.tv view screen
[02:33:55.360 --> 02:34:00.360]  The stock graph right now, I will give people the numbers
[02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:02.360]  Hit refresh on that baby for me
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:09.360]  Last time I checked, the stock market had dropped in the Dow 391 points
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:13.360]  And now it has gone back up a tiny bit, 366
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:17.360]  So that's good, that slide, at least for now, has been corrected
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:21.360]  But they're talking about all-out European collapse, US collapse
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:23.360]  After they got their debt ceiling increase
[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:28.360]  Go deeper into debt to us with fiat stuff we make up
[02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:32.360]  And we will give you some future
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:34.360]  And then you give in to them and things get worse
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:39.360]  They say it's the biggest route since the pre-banker bailout days
[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:41.360]  So as you can see, it's not fixing things
[02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:43.360]  We're going to Catherine's Albrecht here in a moment

[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:39.360]  That the government's adding in the fluoride

[02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:43.360]  I know that's even more wicked

[02:36:56.360 --> 02:36:59.360]  So let's just go through a cornucopia
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:02.360]  Of the surveillance systems that are violating our rights
[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:05.360]  Everywhere, the transhumanist
[02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:09.360]  I've heard you say some really informative things on that subject
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:11.360]  And how it's being rolled out as trendy
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:13.360]  To have the microchips put in your brain
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:15.360]  Not a system of enslavement
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:17.360]  Catherine, go over it for us
[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:19.360]  Yeah, you know, there's a whole bunch of stuff going on
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:22.360]  And I've just got a couple of things in the news to kind of anchor some of this
[02:37:22.360 --> 02:37:24.360]  I know you've talked about these things
[02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:27.360]  You know, the Interpol chief calling for a global ID card
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:29.360]  So they can manage all of this immigration
[02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:31.360]  That is falling right in the hands
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:35.360]  Or right on the heels of L1 identity solutions
[02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:39.360]  Now that's the big biometrics company
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:40.360]  It's a U.S. company
[02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:44.360]  Started by all the CIA spooks and NSA and Homeland Security guys
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:47.360]  And they've been making a fortune off of this
[02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:49.360]  They sold the company for billions
[02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:52.360]  Literally to a French company called Safran
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:54.360]  S-A-F-R-A-N
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:56.360]  Now you've got a French company that owns
[02:37:56.360 --> 02:37:58.360]  It's now the biggest biometrics company on the globe
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:01.360]  It is owned by the French government, no less
[02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:05.360]  And now they are in charge of all of our biometrics
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:06.360]  It's going global
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:09.360]  You've got Interpol saying we need a global ID card
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:10.360]  You've got these global companies
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:12.360]  And in fact both L1
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:14.360]  Which is the biggest company you've never heard of
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:17.360]  And Safran are both working together saying
[02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:19.360]  Hey you know this is just going to move us closer
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:22.360]  To the global management of biometric identities
[02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:23.360]  So there's a big one
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:27.360]  You've also got going on sort of here on our soil
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:30.360]  You've got this House Judicial Committee
[02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:33.360]  Judiciary Committee approving a bill
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:34.360]  Or at least giving a thumbs up
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:36.360]  Sending it back to the house now
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:39.360]  That all ISPs would be required to log
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:42.360]  All of your internet activities for a period of one year
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:45.360]  Now that's heavy because what that means
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:47.360]  Is that without a warrant
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:49.360]  Law enforcement, this is actually part of the bill
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:51.360]  Law enforcement would be able to get into those records
[02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:53.360]  Pinpoint anybody or everybody
[02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:55.360]  I mean they could just do it as a blanket
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:57.360]  And say I want to know everybody who goes to infowars.com
[02:38:57.360 --> 02:38:59.360]  Or to katharinealbrecht.com
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:01.360]  Or to startpage.com or whatever the heck it is
[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:04.360]  And they would be able to access that list
[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:06.360]  Now that bill, I have to say it right here now
[02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:08.360]  That bill cannot stand
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:09.360]  We cannot allow that to pass
[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:12.360]  That's got to be, I think, the biggest battle
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:15.360]  That we're going to fight in this legislative season
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:17.360]  Is going to be that bill
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:19.360]  California has a bill right now requiring
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:22.360]  All shelter pets to be microchipped
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:24.360]  So they're moving sort of through the animals
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:26.360]  So let's get the animals chipped
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:28.360]  And then once you're used to chipping your pet
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:29.360]  Then you want to chip your kid
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:31.360]  Then you want to chip grandma
[02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:33.360]  And then you want to chip the nuclear workers
[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:36.360]  And then you want to chip, you know, the teachers in the schools
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:39.360]  Well, reporters reported like nine years ago
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:42.360]  That they wanted to forcibly chip
[02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:44.360]  And it was a policy, but when they got attention
[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:46.360]  They backed off the California prisoners
[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:48.360]  I mean, this is just, this is just
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:50.360]  They're assailing us with this
[02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:52.360]  Until we get conditioned to it
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:53.360]  Yeah, I think so
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:55.360]  And, you know, years ago
[02:39:55.360 --> 02:39:57.360]  The thought of putting a microchip into an animal
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:39:59.360]  There wouldn't be a person in this country
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:00.360]  Who wouldn't be outraged at that
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:01.360]  And say, you know, mark the beast
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:02.360]  Come on, let's be real here
[02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:04.360]  We're talking about transmitting a number
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:07.360]  And we know that that can be put into human beings
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:09.360]  When done, people have had these things implanted
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:11.360]  In them, in their hands even
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:15.360]  So it is, it's a slow wearing down
[02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:19.360]  And, you know, because a human lifespan is relatively short
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:21.360]  You know, all the people who are worrying about
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:23.360]  The social security number back in the 1920s
[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:25.360]  You know, the 1930s, they're all dead
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:27.360]  And the rest of us are like, yeah, we're born into a world
[02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:29.360]  Where they make us have a social
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:31.360]  You look at the microchips
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:33.360]  All of us who are opposing the microchips
[02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:35.360]  You know, at some point, down the road
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:37.360]  It's going to be a whole new generation
[02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:39.360]  And they've already found that younger people today
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:41.360]  They're much more open to this idea of implants
[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:43.360]  That could manage their cell phones
[02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:44.360]  Or their Facebook contacts
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:46.360]  And at all the big video game conferences
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:48.360]  They have speaker after speaker
[02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:49.360]  It's obviously a talking point
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:52.360]  Get up and say, soon you're going to have a chip in you
[02:40:52.360 --> 02:40:54.360]  That tracks everything you do
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:56.360]  And you'll be able to play the game better
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:40:58.360]  And then soon you won't be able to play the game
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:00.360]  If you don't have the chip
[02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:03.360]  And then you expand out from there
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:06.360]  They're just completely selling everyone
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:08.360]  On accepting this
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:10.360]  Well, that's part of the matrix that you talk about
[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:12.360]  Is once we take these chips into our bodies
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:15.360]  And we plug our brains into this network
[02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:18.360]  Which really is what the transhumanists are talking about
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:20.360]  You know, we're going to dump these human bodies
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:23.360]  You look at what Ray Kurzweil has to say
[02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:25.360]  And Peter Cochran is another one
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:28.360]  C-O-C-H-R-A-N-E
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:30.360]  He's out of England and he wrote a horrifying thing
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:34.360]  About dumping our bodies and becoming cyborgs
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:37.360]  And he really sums it up in an essay he wrote
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:39.360]  He says there's going to be a point
[02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:41.360]  When we're going to just dump these bodies
[02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:45.360]  We will all upload our consciousness into a massive entity
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:49.360]  And that entity will be freed from the constraints
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:51.360]  Of gravity and time and space
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:53.360]  And it will be able to fly out into the universe
[02:41:53.360 --> 02:41:56.360]  Looking for other bodies to inhabit
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:41:58.360]  I'm not making that up now
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:01.360]  I'm in possession, I don't know what is
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:03.360]  So this notion that our technology
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:05.360]  Is just making life more convenient
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:07.360]  The dishwasher helps mom, whatever
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:10.360]  That's out the window, these guys are really talking about
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:12.360]  The next level of technology
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:15.360]  Where we dump these human bags of flesh
[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:17.360]  Which is how they view them
[02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:19.360]  And then we all become one
[02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:22.360]  With sort of this master global consciousness
[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:24.360]  And I gotta say, when I read the Bible
[02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:26.360]  And I read the book of Revelation
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:28.360]  The beast of the end time
[02:42:28.360 --> 02:42:30.360]  That will control everything
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:32.360]  That's exactly what that's going to look like
[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:35.360]  Because if we build it, it's like field of dreams
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:37.360]  If you build it, they will come
[02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:39.360]  As we build this system
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:41.360]  Google, and I want to get into Google in a minute
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:43.360]  They want to be the mind of God
[02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:45.360]  That's an actual quote from one of the Google founders
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:47.360]  They want to be the mind of God
[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:49.360]  So if we create this
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:52.360]  And we've got the ability to be omniscient
[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:54.360]  And have everyone uploaded into it
[02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:56.360]  And interconnected with it
[02:42:56.360 --> 02:42:58.360]  And brain merged with it
[02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:01.360]  Then that is going to be the perfect storm for Satan
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:04.360]  The beast to come in and say
[02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:06.360]  I now own you
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:09.360]  And you look at what the Mark of the Beast is about
[02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:12.360]  And I really think, and I've sat with this since I was 8 years old
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:15.360]  I really think this idea of needing a mark
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:18.360]  To buy and sell, and it's not just taking the mark that dams you
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:20.360]  It's worshiping the beast
[02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:22.360]  There's going to be a moment
[02:43:22.360 --> 02:43:24.360]  At some point in our future, maybe not so far off
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:26.360]  Where you're going to be asked
[02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:28.360]  Listen, you're going to swear allegiance
[02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:30.360]  You're going to take this thing
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:32.360]  And when you do it, you will be changed
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:34.360]  And you're going to be changed spiritually
[02:43:34.360 --> 02:43:36.360]  Something's going to happen
[02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:38.360]  It would not surprise me, Alex
[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:40.360]  And I've thought about even writing a novel about this
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:43.360]  If it wasn't that you literally upload your soul
[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:46.360]  Into something for permanent safekeeping
[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:48.360]  It'll be quote unquote immortal
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:50.360]  And by the way, this is all quackery
[02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:53.360]  For decades, they ended up imprisoning
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:55.360]  Tens of thousands of innocent people
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:57.360]  With their stupid lie detector test
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:00.360]  And then now they have high tech brain scanners
[02:44:00.360 --> 02:44:02.360]  That they claim, and they show the jury
[02:44:02.360 --> 02:44:04.360]  Look, the blinking lights say you're guilty
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:07.360]  It's like, Mr. Rockefeller, you've paid us 10 billion
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:09.360]  Now you're not going to die, we're uploading your soul
[02:44:09.360 --> 02:44:11.360]  Yes, sir
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:13.360]  And it'll be a computer program that can talk to you
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:15.360]  It may even be sentient
[02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:17.360]  And they've already got computers in them
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:19.360]  That can make decisions, do puzzles very well
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:22.360]  For humans, and so you won't be able to converse
[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:24.360]  It'll sound like David Rockefeller will be like
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:26.360]  Good, now I can die, I live forever
[02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:29.360]  And it's a total con, don't forget
[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:32.360]  There's a lot of quackery involved here, go ahead
[02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:35.360]  Yeah, and I think there's such enormous spiritual pieces
[02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:38.360]  To this, and anybody who doesn't feel the spiritual battle
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:40.360]  Is, you know, they need to get on their knees and pray
[02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:42.360]  Satan wants to be God, and he's using this creation
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:44.360]  To try to build it
[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:46.360]  Well, you got it, and the thing about Satan is
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:48.360]  You know, obviously he's never going to be God
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:50.360]  He's going to shake his tiny fist at God
[02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:53.360]  His efforts to replicate God's powers are so pathetic
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:55.360]  And they always fall short, and they always fail
[02:44:55.360 --> 02:44:57.360]  And they always have a downside
[02:44:57.360 --> 02:45:00.360]  And this idea, you know, only God can give us immortality
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:02.360]  Only God can give us eternal life
[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:05.360]  But Satan's going to say, and I really believe this is going to happen
[02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:08.360]  At some point, listen, you know, you're going to die
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:11.360]  At age 80 or 90, maybe we can get chapter 100
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:13.360]  But eventually you're going to die, but if you upload
[02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:16.360]  Into this matrix, you will live forever
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:19.360]  And when people make that bargain
[02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:21.360]  When they worship that
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:24.360]  And make that bargain and upload themselves into that
[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:27.360]  That's going to be the moment when they lose their souls
[02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:29.360]  And their soul will not be redeemable at that point
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:31.360]  And it will belong to Satan, the Bible's very clear on that
[02:45:31.360 --> 02:45:33.360]  Now, you may think, and I'm sure there's listeners out there going
[02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:36.360]  Wow, Catherine's really gone off the deep end
[02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:39.360]  But let me tell you, this is not me speaking
[02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:42.360]  This is the people on the other side
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:45.360]  Clearly spelling this out
[02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:49.360]  They say it as clear as I'm saying it
[02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:51.360]  Kurzweil says that people who won't take this
[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:53.360]  Will just be put in ghettos
[02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:55.360]  And then basically won't be needed
[02:45:55.360 --> 02:45:57.360]  They're all writing about that
[02:45:57.360 --> 02:46:00.360]  And they're writing about the spiritual piece of it, too
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:03.360]  Alex, they're writing about the worship component
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:05.360]  They're writing about the new revolution
[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:08.360]  Well, Kurzweil quote says in the tagline for his movie
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:10.360]  I know you've seen and talked about
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:12.360]  A transcendent man, he says, I don't believe in God yet
[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:14.360]  I'm going to be God
[02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:16.360]  That's right, yeah, and that's the ultimate sin
[02:46:16.360 --> 02:46:18.360]  And you know, that's the problem
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:20.360]  What did Satan promise Adam and Eve in the Bible?
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:21.360]  You will be as gods
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:22.360]  You got it
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:25.360]  And so Kurzweil is just like the snake with the apple
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:28.360]  You know, however many years later
[02:46:28.360 --> 02:46:31.360]  He's like the snake with the apple making you the same promise
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:34.360]  They're going to download into your brain a wire head
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:37.360]  A total ecstasy program
[02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:39.360]  You go, I'm God
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:42.360]  And then you go, I must transcend and meet the hellbop
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:44.360]  I'm killing my physical body
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:46.360]  That's what they write about in their weird nihilistic writings
[02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:47.360]  They do
[02:46:47.360 --> 02:46:49.360]  They do, and it's religious
[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:51.360]  They're no different than people
[02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:54.360]  Putting on the white knikies and the black outfits
[02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:56.360]  And taking barbiturates and drinking vodka
[02:46:56.360 --> 02:47:00.360]  Yeah, and it is absolutely a cult
[02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:02.360]  No, they're a bunch of complete lunatics
[02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:03.360]  Totally
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:04.360]  Totally
[02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:05.360]  And it's religion
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:07.360]  I'm sorry, go ahead
[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:10.360]  People often will say to me
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:13.360]  You know, Catherine, I love everything you do except that Christian stuff
[02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:16.360]  And I say, you know, dude, take a look at who we're fighting
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:20.360]  Because those people will absolutely talk religion to you
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:22.360]  They will absolutely, you read their writing
[02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:24.360]  They're the ones that always push the atheist thing
[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:26.360]  Just so you're not looking at religion
[02:47:26.360 --> 02:47:29.360]  But that everything they do is obsessed with the occult
[02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:31.360]  And how they're going to be God
[02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:32.360]  And they don't want you looking at religion
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:35.360]  Because they don't want you, quote, getting their Lucifer power
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:38.360]  Which they think are guarding, and then they hate Christians
[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:40.360]  And so they're like, oh, there's nothing going on
[02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:43.360]  There's no spirits, oh, great goblin, give me power
[02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:45.360]  I mean, you know, they're just obsessed with it
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:48.360]  Yeah, it's interesting stuff
[02:47:48.360 --> 02:47:51.360]  So the people I would recommend, people look at
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:54.360]  Peter Cochran, C-O-C-H-R-A-N-E
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:56.360]  His website's really dark, it's all futuristic
[02:47:56.360 --> 02:47:58.360]  He's got a bunch of stuff out there on that
[02:47:58.360 --> 02:48:03.360]  Obviously, Ray Kurzweil is the guy who's probably achieved the most, you know, best-seller status
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:06.360]  They say they will destroy the earth to keep on willing
[02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:10.360]  And they just talk like total power-tripping lunatics
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:13.360]  Yeah, I know, and, you know, it plays right into their hands
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:16.360]  That the earth is becoming polluted, people are getting sick
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:18.360]  Our bodies are breaking down
[02:48:18.360 --> 02:48:21.360]  Because the more pollutants you put out there, the more people who get cancer
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:24.360]  I mean, believe me, Alex, there have been times over the last six months
[02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:26.360]  I've thought, you know, I'd love to dump this body
[02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:29.360]  It's betrayed me, it's not working so good right now
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:31.360]  And, you know, it's tough to go through cancer treatment
[02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:36.360]  Catherine, that's the lie, they've added the poisons in on record
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:39.360]  To make normal life, normal birth impossible
[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:42.360]  Total sterilization, where you've got to go to them
[02:48:42.360 --> 02:48:45.360]  And have the man and woman's cells spliced
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:47.360]  And then you think you're getting your baby with your genetics
[02:48:47.360 --> 02:48:51.360]  But they can add their Trojan horse piggybacks in
[02:48:51.360 --> 02:48:53.360]  Just like they've done with GMO
[02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:55.360]  That's why they're destroying all the crops
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:48:57.360]  And all the human and animal genetics
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:02.360]  They're destroying giant underground animal and plant armored vaults
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:05.360]  And people hear this to Alex and they say, oh, that couldn't be possible
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:07.360]  They could never coordinate something that large
[02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:10.360]  Let me tell you, once you understand the spiritual piece of this
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:13.360]  And you understand that we're not battling flesh and blood
[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:17.360]  But we are in an enormous spiritual battle on this planet right now
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:21.360]  Once you get that, and you understand that there are chess pieces that are black
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:23.360]  And they're being moved on the board
[02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:26.360]  And there's chess pieces that are white being moved on the board
[02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:28.360]  And that is a battle raging
[02:49:28.360 --> 02:49:30.360]  I'm sure it's raging in the heavens too
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:32.360]  Look, the New Ages, they can't get it
[02:49:32.360 --> 02:49:34.360]  It's a spirit of the year, you can't see it
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:36.360]  You can call it a space invader if you want
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:38.360]  But there is the mystery of evil
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:44.360]  There is a coordinating force outside of humans
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:47.360]  You can call it spiritual, or you can call it whatever it is
[02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:49.360]  And the elitists believe that
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:52.360]  They believe they're being directed
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:54.360]  Yes, do they ever, absolutely
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:57.360]  So, and let me just, from a practical perspective
[02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:00.360]  I hate leaving people just going, yeah, this is so creepy
[02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:02.360]  There are practical things you can do
[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:04.360]  There are companies that you need to be paying more attention to
[02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:08.360]  Facebook, I'm so glad, has come to the public's awareness
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:10.360]  With all of the privacy issues
[02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:13.360]  I'm so glad Zuckerberg's sister came out and just said it like it is
[02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:15.360]  We want to eliminate anonymity
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:17.360]  We want to make sure
[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:19.360]  And said, hey, we're watching you big deal
[02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:21.360]  You shouldn't do it if you don't want to be watched
[02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:24.360]  That's right, and then, of course, he's the guy who wants his own stuff hidden
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:26.360]  So, don't even get me going on that guy
[02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:28.360]  But you know, Google's saying they want to be the mind of God
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:30.360]  They got a picture of your house from a satellite
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:32.360]  They're doing the drive-by thing
[02:50:32.360 --> 02:50:34.360]  They're reading all of your email
[02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:36.360]  And I always point this out, if you have a Gmail account
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:39.360]  Every email you write and send is being scanned
[02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:41.360]  Keywords are going into your profile
[02:50:41.360 --> 02:50:43.360]  They're watching everything
[02:50:43.360 --> 02:50:45.360]  Yeah, folks, you think you're looking at a crystal ball
[02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:47.360]  And getting data with Google
[02:50:47.360 --> 02:50:49.360]  But Sauron's looking back to the other side
[02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:51.360]  They are watching everything
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:53.360]  And you're telling them what's really in your mind
[02:50:53.360 --> 02:50:55.360]  Where you're going, what you're doing
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:50:57.360]  And it was in Qtel Money, CIA Money founded it
[02:50:57.360 --> 02:50:59.360]  Pig, Schmidt, all of them
[02:50:59.360 --> 02:51:01.360]  They're just total front-level minions
[02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:05.360]  OpticsPlanet.com is where discerning gun owners and outdoorsmen go to gear up

[02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:36.360]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:51:36.360 --> 02:51:38.360]  They've been available since 1986
[02:51:38.360 --> 02:51:42.360]  Yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement
[02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:44.360]  Gold is outperformed paper investments
[02:51:44.360 --> 02:51:46.360]  Yet no word about IRAs
[02:51:46.360 --> 02:51:51.360]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237

[02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:09.360]  And keep all of your money?
[02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:12.360]  I'm Jason Davenport and I've just completed Zerodet100.com
[02:53:12.360 --> 02:53:15.360]  A program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds
[02:53:15.360 --> 02:53:19.360]  Including debt collectors and foreclosures with guaranteed results
[02:53:19.360 --> 02:53:20.360]  Forget loan modifications
[02:53:20.360 --> 02:53:24.360]  Zerodet showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance
[02:53:24.360 --> 02:53:26.360]  While stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime
[02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:28.360]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages
[02:53:28.360 --> 02:53:32.360]  But the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zerodet program
[02:53:32.360 --> 02:53:37.360]  Find out how I did this by calling Zerodet today at 800-477-9256
[02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:40.360]  Tell them Jason sent you and ask for the Zerodet special
[02:53:40.360 --> 02:53:45.360]  And the free bonus promotion about stopping an IRS levy and getting your money back
[02:53:45.360 --> 02:53:49.360]  Tell them Jason sent you and call 800-477-9256
[02:53:49.360 --> 02:53:52.360]  800-477-9256
[02:53:52.360 --> 02:53:56.360]  That's 800-477-9256
[02:53:56.360 --> 02:54:00.360]  Or visit www.zerodet100.com
[02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:07.360]  I say I shot the sheriff but tax clearance was inserted
[02:54:07.360 --> 02:54:09.360]  Okay, my main broadcast is over in five minutes
[02:54:09.360 --> 02:54:12.360]  But I will do prisonplanet.tv only
[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:15.360]  Info or streams, only five minutes, special comment
[02:54:15.360 --> 02:54:19.360]  Because I have to about what media matters is doing to us
[02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:23.360]  You know they're getting ready to rebrand, quote, anybody who isn't a total communist
[02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:26.360]  Globalist as a terrorist
[02:54:26.360 --> 02:54:28.360]  And I'm always calling for non-violence
[02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:33.360]  And when Richard Poplowski, two hours after he shot and killed three cops
[02:54:33.360 --> 02:54:35.360]  They downloaded the full contents of his computer
[02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:39.360]  And had Southern Poverty Law Center connected reporters say he did it for me
[02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:43.360]  Turned out he hated me all over my website, attacked me on all the Nazi sites
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:47.360]  And said I worked for Israel
[02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:50.360]  And didn't like me
[02:54:50.360 --> 02:54:52.360]  And it turned out there were thousands of websites on his computer
[02:54:52.360 --> 02:54:55.360]  But they chose to say I made him do it
[02:54:55.360 --> 02:54:58.360]  And I'm getting to the point of litigation
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:03.360]  If people continue to take things out of context and imply that I'm calling for violence
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:04.360]  And they've done it again
[02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:07.360]  And have a part about how they're trying to cause a civil war in America
[02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:11.360]  Between the police and the public and the military
[02:55:11.360 --> 02:55:13.360]  And I've got to find it later
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:15.360]  But I know that I...
[02:55:15.360 --> 02:55:18.360]  I'm just going to go back to Catherine Albert and I'll just finish at the overdrive
[02:55:18.360 --> 02:55:21.360]  But I know in the YouTube video I've been going to say they want this clash
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:23.360]  But we can't let it happen
[02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:25.360]  Reach out to police and military
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:27.360]  But see they just take it all out of context
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:29.360]  Where if a cop was reading this
[02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:31.360]  And they just want to get a bunch of corrupt cops souped up
[02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:33.360]  To come set me up and kill me
[02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:34.360]  Whatever
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:36.360]  You think I'm worried about death
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:38.360]  Going up against Soros and all you people
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:40.360]  I mean you really think...
[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:44.360]  The point is we know what your bosses are getting ready to do in America to blame on us
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:45.360]  I understand that
[02:55:45.360 --> 02:55:46.360]  But it doesn't matter
[02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:49.360]  You've got to be defeated or there's no future
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:51.360]  Now they got a bunch of young snot-nosed kids
[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:53.360]  Who work in there and even know what they're doing
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:55.360]  Compartmentalized idiots
[02:55:55.360 --> 02:55:57.360]  And well
[02:55:57.360 --> 02:55:59.360]  But they did admit they wanted to infiltrate media organizations
[02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:01.360]  And destroy them from within
[02:56:01.360 --> 02:56:03.360]  So we do have to run background checks on folks we hire
[02:56:03.360 --> 02:56:05.360]  But
[02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:07.360]  It is just a real shame
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:09.360]  And they also took out of context the helicopter plan
[02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:11.360]  The Sunshine Project in Texas discovered
[02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:14.360]  They have knockout gases released on the public
[02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:16.360]  And then all the statements about the elites
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:18.360]  About releasing viruses on us
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:20.360]  And then they just make it sound like I'm crazy talking about that
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:23.360]  So we'll just do another report on that
[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:25.360]  For everybody to learn exactly what you're up to
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:26.360]  Going back to Katherine Albright
[02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:28.360]  Katherine, I want to have you back up in the near future soon
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:30.360]  Tell us about...
[02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:31.360]  You're talking about Google
[02:56:31.360 --> 02:56:34.360]  But you are the spokesperson for StarPage
[02:56:34.360 --> 02:56:36.360]  That we've promoted here, StarPage.com
[02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:40.360]  That actually lets you even get Google results
[02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:42.360]  Without them spying on you
[02:56:42.360 --> 02:56:44.360]  Yeah, that's the cool thing
[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:47.360]  And we've talked about StarPage for years, you and I
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:49.360]  And it is the way that you can access it
[02:56:49.360 --> 02:56:51.360]  It's a search engine for people who don't know
[02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:53.360]  That allows you to do searches
[02:56:53.360 --> 02:56:55.360]  Without Google recording everything you search for
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:56:57.360]  And, you know, never before have I seen the value of it
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:56:59.360]  Alex so much is having breast cancer
[02:56:59.360 --> 02:57:02.360]  Because, you know, I'm typing in a lot of personal medical information
[02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:04.360]  Into search engines
[02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:06.360]  I want to know, what is this drug? What does that do?
[02:57:06.360 --> 02:57:07.360]  What is this treatment?
[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:09.360]  And if I were doing that into Google
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:12.360]  Google would know every aspect of my health treatment
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:14.360]  And then they have ads pop up
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:16.360]  And they admit they're doing it
[02:57:16.360 --> 02:57:18.360]  Yeah, if I were typing in a doctor
[02:57:18.360 --> 02:57:20.360]  You know, you get a new doctor, you type in the name
[02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:22.360]  You get a prescription, you want to see what the side effects are
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:23.360]  They record all of that
[02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:24.360]  And so they know everything about you
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:26.360]  Who you're seeing, where you're going
[02:57:26.360 --> 02:57:27.360]  It's crazy
[02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:29.360]  So StarPage has been around for a couple of years
[02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:31.360]  A lot of your listeners are huge fans of StarPage
[02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:33.360]  And I want to thank you all for supporting StarPage
[02:57:33.360 --> 02:57:35.360]  Because they're a great company
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:38.360]  The amazing thing is that now
[02:57:38.360 --> 02:57:41.360]  StarPage is actually returning Google results
[02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:43.360]  And a lot of people, they go to StarPage
[02:57:43.360 --> 02:57:45.360]  Now they see Enhanced by Google, they're like,
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:46.360]  Where you bought out by Google
[02:57:46.360 --> 02:57:48.360]  I'm a VP with the company, I can say totally not
[02:57:48.360 --> 02:57:50.360]  But what we are doing now is
[02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:53.360]  When you type in a query, you know, breast cancer for example
[02:57:53.360 --> 02:57:55.360]  StarPage servers, which are either in the Netherlands
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:57:57.360]  Or in California
[02:57:57.360 --> 02:58:00.360]  Will go onto Google's website
[02:58:00.360 --> 02:58:02.360]  They will put in the search for breast cancer
[02:58:02.360 --> 02:58:04.360]  They'll get the results from Google
[02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:06.360]  Folks never get it, it's a proxy
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:08.360]  It's a proxy, they put it behind a firewall
[02:58:08.360 --> 02:58:10.360]  Then they serve you the results
[02:58:10.360 --> 02:58:11.360]  Google doesn't see you
[02:58:11.360 --> 02:58:13.360]  Google just sees some computer in the Netherlands
[02:58:13.360 --> 02:58:14.360]  And it's private
[02:58:14.360 --> 02:58:16.360]  StarPage, it's not logging IPs
[02:58:16.360 --> 02:58:18.360]  Totally not, totally private
[02:58:18.360 --> 02:58:21.360]  And this ISP thing, if you use the proxy
[02:58:21.360 --> 02:58:25.360]  On StarPage, your ISP will not know where you even go
[02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:28.360]  And that's the cool part of this horrible off-hasses
[02:58:28.360 --> 02:58:30.360]  So startpage.com
[02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:32.360]  I vouch for them, I know you do too
[02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:33.360]  It's a great company
[02:58:33.360 --> 02:58:35.360]  Absolutely, people have got to vote with their feet
[02:58:35.360 --> 02:58:36.360]  And stop the NSA
[02:58:36.360 --> 02:58:38.360]  Known as Google and Pig Schmidt and the rest of them
[02:58:38.360 --> 02:58:39.360]  Thank you, Catherine
[02:58:39.360 --> 02:58:40.360]  See you back tomorrow at 11am
[02:58:40.360 --> 02:58:42.360]  I'll come back and internet only
[02:58:42.360 --> 02:58:45.360]  Thank you for listening to GCN
[02:58:47.360 --> 02:58:49.360]  Visit GCNLive.com today
[02:58:52.360 --> 02:58:54.360]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[02:58:54.360 --> 02:58:56.360]  In the last century alone
[02:58:56.360 --> 02:58:59.360]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[02:58:59.360 --> 02:59:01.360]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[02:59:01.360 --> 02:59:04.360]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[02:59:04.360 --> 02:59:06.360]  We have tremendous influence
[02:59:06.360 --> 02:59:08.360]  On our president in Congress
[02:59:08.360 --> 02:59:10.360]  And they really are calling the shots
[02:59:10.360 --> 02:59:13.360]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.360 --> 02:59:15.360]  As American citizens to pay attention
[02:59:15.360 --> 02:59:19.360]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:59:19.360 --> 02:59:21.360]  The criminal offshore cartel
[02:59:21.360 --> 02:59:23.360]  Held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:59:23.360 --> 02:59:26.360]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[02:59:26.360 --> 02:59:28.360]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[02:59:28.360 --> 02:59:30.360]  They're asking for more matches
[02:59:30.360 --> 02:59:32.360]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:59:32.360 --> 02:59:34.360]  Today seems like nobody does care
[02:59:34.360 --> 02:59:36.360]  And right now in Washington DC
[02:59:36.360 --> 02:59:39.360]  We have seen a fall of the Republic
[02:59:39.360 --> 02:59:41.360]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic
[02:59:41.360 --> 02:59:44.360]  On DVD at infowars.com

[02:59:52.360 --> 02:59:55.360]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[02:59:55.360 --> 03:00:11.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:15.360]  Okay, so you got the George Soros run
[03:00:15.360 --> 03:00:17.360]  Funded media matters
[03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:20.360]  Which is tiny compared to infowars.com
[03:00:20.360 --> 03:00:22.360]  prisonplanet.com
[03:00:22.360 --> 03:00:26.360]  But the masquerades is this quote nonpartisan group
[03:00:26.360 --> 03:00:28.360]  When their own memos have come out in political saying
[03:00:28.360 --> 03:00:31.360]  We're going to infiltrate, we're going to destroy organizations from within
[03:00:31.360 --> 03:00:34.360]  It's our job to destroy the alternative media
[03:00:34.360 --> 03:00:37.360]  Fox News to quote other conservative groups
[03:00:37.360 --> 03:00:39.360]  And they really hate my guts
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:43.360]  And when Richard Poplowski up in Pittsburgh a few years ago
[03:00:43.360 --> 03:00:46.360]  Was a former Marine
[03:00:46.360 --> 03:00:48.360]  He got a second pit bull
[03:00:48.360 --> 03:00:50.360]  They were urinating all over the carpet
[03:00:50.360 --> 03:00:52.360]  His mother told him get rid of that dog
[03:00:52.360 --> 03:00:54.360]  Or you're kicked out of the house
[03:00:54.360 --> 03:00:57.360]  He was drunk in the early morning hours
[03:00:57.360 --> 03:00:59.360]  That's all confirmed
[03:00:59.360 --> 03:01:01.360]  And threw a fit when she kicked him out
[03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:03.360]  It was a domestic dispute
[03:01:03.360 --> 03:01:05.360]  The most dangerous thing cops go to
[03:01:05.360 --> 03:01:07.360]  And the cops came and killed three of them
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:08.360]  And it's terrible
[03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:10.360]  And we've always said we're against that
[03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:12.360]  Within two hours of him being arrested
[03:01:12.360 --> 03:01:14.360]  They came out in the news and said
[03:01:14.360 --> 03:01:16.360]  And had weird people popping up in the news
[03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:19.360]  It was clearly scripted saying oh we did this for Alex Jones
[03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:21.360]  We learned, thank God we got his handle online
[03:01:21.360 --> 03:01:23.360]  And the handle they were talking about
[03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:25.360]  And he was attacking me everywhere
[03:01:25.360 --> 03:01:28.360]  And he was a white supremacist
[03:01:28.360 --> 03:01:30.360]  I guess one of the few that didn't offend
[03:01:30.360 --> 03:01:33.360]  And they knew that
[03:01:33.360 --> 03:01:36.360]  And I forced retractions in five newspapers
[03:01:36.360 --> 03:01:39.360]  Over the Poplowski
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:41.360]  I had to call him up and I said listen
[03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:43.360]  Here's all the proof of this
[03:01:43.360 --> 03:01:46.360]  You know how'd you get that info out of that computer
[03:01:46.360 --> 03:01:48.360]  Who handed that to you
[03:01:48.360 --> 03:01:49.360]  What agency
[03:01:49.360 --> 03:01:51.360]  They all got scared because they knew
[03:01:51.360 --> 03:01:53.360]  So the first thing on the cops mind
[03:01:53.360 --> 03:01:55.360]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center and others
[03:01:55.360 --> 03:01:58.360]  Who were hooked in with the local reporters
[03:01:58.360 --> 03:02:00.360]  That write for them basically
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:03.360]  Was get Alex Jones
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:05.360]  I mean I would imagine that a
[03:02:05.360 --> 03:02:07.360]  Bolter came down a mountain and killed a cop
[03:02:07.360 --> 03:02:09.360]  While they're in Colorado they'd blame me
[03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:12.360]  Because this is how they manipulate cops
[03:02:12.360 --> 03:02:14.360]  We've had pro-land rights rallies
[03:02:14.360 --> 03:02:16.360]  And I've heard police radios going
[03:02:16.360 --> 03:02:18.360]  They're Republic of Texas
[03:02:18.360 --> 03:02:20.360]  They're all trying to shoot you
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:22.360]  So the cops get all scared
[03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:24.360]  Guys on the radio told me you're bad
[03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:26.360]  Told about manipulating people
[03:02:26.360 --> 03:02:28.360]  And the government doesn't just lie to us
[03:02:28.360 --> 03:02:30.360]  They lie to their own minions
[03:02:30.360 --> 03:02:32.360]  And it's really disgusting
[03:02:32.360 --> 03:02:34.360]  Because they talk about the headline
[03:02:34.360 --> 03:02:37.360]  Is Alex Jones warns of orgy of mass murder
[03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:39.360]  And they think wow he does
[03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:42.360]  And then it goes into quotes about
[03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:45.360]  Poplowski
[03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:47.360]  And Jewish cabals running everything
[03:02:47.360 --> 03:02:49.360]  And then it says he got all this from
[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:51.360]  Alex Jones that's not true and everybody
[03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:53.360]  Knows that
[03:02:53.360 --> 03:02:56.360]  And this is their script
[03:02:56.360 --> 03:02:58.360]  Southern Poverty Law Center ADL type script
[03:02:58.360 --> 03:03:00.360]  And then it goes on alas
[03:03:00.360 --> 03:03:02.360]  He's up to his old tricks
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:04.360]  And they're very upset about my video
[03:03:04.360 --> 03:03:06.360]  That's on the Alex Jones channel of
[03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:08.360]  YouTube right now
[03:03:08.360 --> 03:03:11.360]  And I'm sad to say it only has
[03:03:11.360 --> 03:03:14.360]  You know 142,000 views
[03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:16.360]  It should have 10 million
[03:03:16.360 --> 03:03:18.360]  Obama launches gun grab
[03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:20.360]  And it starts with a newscast
[03:03:20.360 --> 03:03:22.360]  With them confiscating the guns in New Orleans
[03:03:22.360 --> 03:03:24.360]  And saying all the guns will be taken
[03:03:24.360 --> 03:03:26.360]  And they go on to say I'm completely insane
[03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:28.360]  And this isn't real
[03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:30.360]  They say it's total delusion
[03:03:30.360 --> 03:03:32.360]  And because I've made a video
[03:03:32.360 --> 03:03:34.360]  Against gun grabbing
[03:03:34.360 --> 03:03:36.360]  And against the ATF doing things outside law
[03:03:36.360 --> 03:03:38.360]  Really here's the NRA
[03:03:38.360 --> 03:03:40.360]  NRA to sue feds over ATF intimidation
[03:03:40.360 --> 03:03:42.360]  Of gun sellers
[03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:44.360]  Really this is all crazy delusion
[03:03:44.360 --> 03:03:46.360]  That they're doing this outside law
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:48.360]  When I have the ATF letters
[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:50.360]  And the ATF's been caught shipping guns into Mexico
[03:03:50.360 --> 03:03:52.360]  See they're really upset
[03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:54.360]  That I'm up here reading the El Paso Times
[03:03:54.360 --> 03:03:56.360]  And we told you this back in April
[03:03:56.360 --> 03:03:58.360]  About also the government
[03:03:58.360 --> 03:04:00.360]  Not just shipping guns down
[03:04:00.360 --> 03:04:02.360]  They're shipping drugs back
[03:04:02.360 --> 03:04:04.360]  And they've been caught
[03:04:04.360 --> 03:04:06.360]  And so they have these watchdog groups
[03:04:06.360 --> 03:04:08.360]  You know for the good banker George Soros
[03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:10.360]  That go after evil talk show hosts
[03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:12.360]  Who are nonpartisan
[03:04:12.360 --> 03:04:14.360]  And just cover the truth and risk my life and my name
[03:04:14.360 --> 03:04:16.360]  Then they take out a context
[03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:18.360]  A clip where I'm talking about the fact that
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:20.360]  The Sunshine Project got this in 2001
[03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:22.360]  We've dug it out before
[03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:24.360]  It's off their site but it's in some of the digital archives
[03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:26.360]  They haven't pulled it down
[03:04:26.360 --> 03:04:28.360]  I printed it and saved it and can't find it
[03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:30.360]  We're gonna go look after the show
[03:04:30.360 --> 03:04:32.360]  I have to also get the former head of the Sunshine Project on
[03:04:32.360 --> 03:04:34.360]  They shut it down because of threats and lack of funding
[03:04:34.360 --> 03:04:36.360]  And I know the article you can find with the Marine Corps
[03:04:36.360 --> 03:04:38.360]  Threatened Sunshine Project
[03:04:38.360 --> 03:04:40.360]  To remove declassified document
[03:04:40.360 --> 03:04:42.360]  And the Marines said this shouldn't have been declassified
[03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:44.360]  And it's the Marines
[03:04:44.360 --> 03:04:46.360]  And the plans for helicopters
[03:04:46.360 --> 03:04:48.360]  In regional grids with knockout gas
[03:04:48.360 --> 03:04:50.360]  And then you got the globalist
[03:04:50.360 --> 03:04:52.360]  Talking about doing it with bio weapons
[03:04:52.360 --> 03:04:54.360]  So that's what I'm talking about
[03:04:54.360 --> 03:04:56.360]  The gun confiscation is real
[03:04:56.360 --> 03:04:58.360]  The plan to nerve gas the public's real
[03:04:58.360 --> 03:05:00.360]  Just like injecting little kids with syphilis is real
[03:05:00.360 --> 03:05:10.360]  So shut up!
