[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:44.080]  U.S. officials say it's highly likely I ran behind the new tanker attack and the bombing
[00:44.080 --> 00:45.560]  of another ship.
[00:45.560 --> 00:56.400]  Well, if the mullahs are really that crazy, this could start World War III, Vladimir Putin
[00:56.400 --> 01:03.480]  warned at the end of the world two days ago, we covered it yesterday, got almost no attention.
[01:03.480 --> 01:07.760]  Every major analyst agrees the world is in more peril of a new giant war than it's ever
[01:07.760 --> 01:14.080]  been between all these different factions and parties, the Saudi Arabians against the
[01:14.080 --> 01:21.600]  Iranians, Pakistan against India, China declaring it controls all the oceans around it, including
[01:21.600 --> 01:31.840]  classical waters of Japan and you name it, down to the Philippines, two ships, one torpedoed,
[01:31.840 --> 01:41.160]  one bombed, huge oil tanker burning on fire, set to sink and flood the Gulf with crude oil.
[01:41.160 --> 01:46.880]  All of this happening in the Gulf of Oman, one torpedo attack, one bombing attack, everyone
[01:46.880 --> 01:54.240]  abandoning ship, are the mullahs that crazy, that's the headline on infowars.com with a
[01:54.240 --> 01:58.080]  live feed today, if you want to share that, the censored broadcast, the video and audio
[01:58.080 --> 02:09.360]  feeds at infowars.com and iswars.com, war with Iran imminent, war with Iran imminent,
[02:09.360 --> 02:15.320]  is Tehran really this crazy or is it another false flag, because if you study history,
[02:15.320 --> 02:23.800]  the favorite false flag comes from British naval annals, Cohen was first seen in naval
[02:23.800 --> 02:30.120]  journals 500 years ago, but it's older than that, the favorite place to stage events is
[02:30.120 --> 02:37.120]  on the open water because it's hard to prove who did it, but you know World War I started
[02:37.120 --> 02:45.520]  with a ship, the Lusitania and a quasi-false flag, you know the main started the Spanish
[02:45.520 --> 02:51.560]  American war in 1898 with William McKinley and his navy, that's stage most historians
[02:51.560 --> 02:56.880]  agree, blown up, everybody was off the ship to say that the Spanish had done it, and of
[02:56.880 --> 03:01.440]  course there's so many other famous naval events, the USS Liberty, which was staged
[03:01.440 --> 03:07.520]  by Israel to get us into war with Egypt, didn't work, that's been even declassified by many
[03:07.520 --> 03:13.120]  Israeli documents and fighter pilots, and of course you've got so many other big events
[03:13.120 --> 03:20.800]  like the Gulf of Tonkin that got us into Vietnam, I'm sure the headline will be out later in
[03:20.800 --> 03:26.920]  the news today, Alex Jones says that the tanker attacks are a false flag, I did not say that,
[03:26.920 --> 03:35.600]  I said that it could be, and many analysts are in the news saying Iran has nothing to
[03:35.600 --> 03:42.760]  gain from this, well I would agree in the main, but not in a smaller area that's just
[03:42.760 --> 03:46.960]  as important when you actually look at it from a perspective, the Mullahs are under
[03:46.960 --> 03:51.680]  pressure politically and are very unpopular in teetering, and their economy's under sanctions
[03:51.680 --> 03:55.680]  for decades and falling apart, they have built up their military since Operation Praying
[03:55.680 --> 04:06.600]  Man has destroyed much of their navy in the 1980s, but they believe they can win a war,
[04:06.600 --> 04:10.720]  a conventional war with the United States, and many analysts believe they can as well,
[04:10.720 --> 04:18.720]  this is not Iraq, and these are not the classic Arab nations with a very unpopular dictator
[04:18.720 --> 04:25.000]  sitting on top of them that the West has inroads into their government and can basically overthrow
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.040]  them, this is an entrenched group, yes it's a lot of unpopularity in their nation, but
[04:30.040 --> 04:35.480]  a large military in place with a tight grip from the throat of the people, and Iran might
[04:35.480 --> 04:42.800]  roll the dice and start these provocations, deny them, but then still use it to push into
[04:42.800 --> 04:50.600]  a larger war, activating Hezbollah sleeper cells, which are in every major western city
[04:50.600 --> 04:55.560]  and are ready to wreak havoc, if you think a school shooting wreaks havoc in your town,
[04:55.560 --> 05:01.440]  take a couple of Iranian special ops, jumping chlorine gas down your hundred store building,
[05:01.440 --> 05:05.560]  is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want,
[05:05.560 --> 05:12.480]  the air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major
[05:12.480 --> 05:18.880]  city, some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities, how can I solve that problem,
[05:18.880 --> 05:23.800]  so we have air filters at infowarstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now
[05:23.800 --> 05:32.720]  $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology, and we've
[05:32.720 --> 05:37.240]  got a limited quantity of these left right now, we're basically selling these at cost
[05:37.240 --> 05:42.240]  because there was a big overhaul, go ahead and read the hundreds of five star reviews
[05:42.240 --> 05:48.600]  for yourself, I've got two in my home, you will notice the difference ladies and gentlemen,
[05:48.600 --> 05:55.400]  with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house, don't live in a polluted major city in your
[05:55.400 --> 06:22.960]  home, have clean air, go to infowarstore.com, well just two days ago Vladimir Putin held
[06:22.960 --> 06:30.200]  an emergency summit in St. Petersburg and said that the world was on the verge of nuclear
[06:30.200 --> 06:37.800]  war, it could very easily destroy ourselves, and magically one of the hotspots where you
[06:37.800 --> 06:44.520]  would expect a major new world war to strike up, the Gulf of Oman, not one but two tankers
[06:44.520 --> 06:48.920]  have been torpedoed and bombed and are on fire as we speak with all abandoning ship,
[06:48.920 --> 06:53.480]  I get radio listeners, obviously you've already seen this all over television today, but we
[06:53.480 --> 07:01.480]  have the latest at infowars.com and newswars.com, drugsreport.com also has excellent coverage
[07:01.480 --> 07:08.160]  of it, this is also obviously going to be an environmental disaster, the big question
[07:08.160 --> 07:18.880]  is, why on God's green earth have an attack in Hormuz, Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf
[07:18.880 --> 07:25.200]  of Oman, which would trigger the United States, Israel, Saudi Arabia and others to attack
[07:25.200 --> 07:31.680]  Iran, why would Iran do that, and so far they haven't taken credit, at least as of 10 minutes
[07:31.680 --> 07:36.600]  ago when I was checking myself, guys will you check and see if Iran is taking credit,
[07:36.600 --> 07:42.400]  they denied they were behind attacks a few weeks ago, but then they're running a proxy
[07:42.400 --> 07:50.720]  war in several countries in the Middle East and some of those folks did take credit, but
[07:50.720 --> 07:55.840]  where they took credit it could have been basically a setup, so here's the bottom line,
[07:55.840 --> 07:59.720]  we don't know, obviously you don't know, I don't think anybody knows except for those
[07:59.720 --> 08:08.800]  that did it, who's behind this, US officials are all over the news, Fox News, CNN, CBS
[08:08.800 --> 08:15.840]  saying that Iran highly likely behind the torpedo attack, now I know Trump is not into
[08:15.840 --> 08:20.960]  false flags, he's a straight shooter, in fact he's even gone into the CIA and told folks
[08:20.960 --> 08:27.800]  that I've talked to her in the room, large, large room, that all the dirty stuff's over,
[08:27.800 --> 08:33.760]  we're not going to play both sides, I've told, this is a few days after he got elected
[08:33.760 --> 08:43.560]  and got into office, Trump told the whole room, the CIA, of top people, he said, we're
[08:43.560 --> 08:47.280]  going to tell Saudi Arabia you're going to stop funding ISIS in al-Qaeda or we'll overthrow
[08:47.280 --> 08:51.960]  you, and Trump obviously knows that the West has been playing both sides and we're not
[08:51.960 --> 08:56.640]  going to fund it either, and so you saw ISIS destroyed, al-Qaeda destroyed, so Trump didn't
[08:56.640 --> 09:03.000]  plan these games, that doesn't mean that neocons are globalists inside the system, the embeds
[09:03.000 --> 09:09.720]  inside our system might not have funded another terror group, a third party group, contractors,
[09:09.720 --> 09:15.760]  we don't know, when you go see James Bond movies, and specters trying to get the US
[09:15.760 --> 09:19.280]  to fight Russia and vice versa and there's a private company that's actually blowing
[09:19.280 --> 09:28.160]  stuff up, that isn't life imitating art, that's art imitating life, Ian Fleming was MI6 high
[09:28.160 --> 09:33.280]  level, OSS before that, wrote those books that a lot of it's based on today, you say
[09:33.280 --> 09:36.800]  well then why do they just keep doing the same script, because that's how governments
[09:36.800 --> 09:42.960]  and things operate, that's the real world folks, that's how things actually take place,
[09:42.960 --> 09:47.920]  there just usually isn't one super guy taking on a thousand people, that isn't how it works,
[09:47.920 --> 09:53.160]  and so Trump says I want square dealing, I want straight shooting, so people know when
[09:53.160 --> 09:58.080]  I say something I mean it, no more of this strategy of tension, where the globalists
[09:58.080 --> 10:02.040]  run around stirring up trouble constantly, so we have an excuse to be everywhere and
[10:02.040 --> 10:05.200]  then make money off both ends, we're just going to be there because we've got better
[10:05.200 --> 10:10.480]  military and better technology and give people a better deal and straight shoot them, because
[10:10.480 --> 10:16.400]  the subterfuge is killing our country, and it's immoral and it's wrong, so we don't
[10:16.400 --> 10:23.400]  know what's happened, I'm not prepared to say that this is a false flag, but I also
[10:23.400 --> 10:28.000]  think it's very interesting that you've got quote US officials saying they think it's
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.760]  Iran and then Iran stands to gain, when many other analysts and I agree with them say Iran
[10:32.760 --> 10:39.040]  doesn't, but the Mullahs are unstable and they do have a powerful military and they
[10:39.040 --> 10:46.680]  are crazy and they are tired of being in the position of being under sanctions that
[10:46.680 --> 10:52.760]  could topple them, so they could choose the house of war instead of the house of inaction.
[10:52.760 --> 10:59.000]  Here are some of the headlines, US says Iran likely behind the torpedo attack on oil tanker
[10:59.000 --> 11:07.560]  in the Gulf, oil tankers are targeted with explosives in the Gulf of Oman, Iran has little
[11:07.560 --> 11:17.000]  to gain from Oman, tanker attacks, that's Bloomberg, oil prices surge after a parent
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.840]  attack on two tankers, they're straight-of-hormose, I want to say oil companies stay in the game
[11:22.840 --> 11:27.800]  but I don't think they're behind it, Trump shock USA told it will lose war with Iran
[11:27.800 --> 11:31.480]  and here's why, that's a big article out of the express in the UK I'm going to get into
[11:31.480 --> 11:39.040]  coming up, dozens rescues reported attack, leaf ships ablaze off Iran, it just goes
[11:39.040 --> 11:46.000]  on and on, but Iran has not taken credit for it, as of we're sitting here talking live
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.960]  right now, let's go to this CBS News report.
[11:49.960 --> 11:57.560]  These attacks were caused by Iran, he is not able to describe the method of attack but
[11:57.560 --> 12:03.080]  crew members of the two ships are being quoted as saying they thought they had either struck
[12:03.080 --> 12:11.040]  a mine or been hit by torpedoes, this contradicts what Iran's foreign minister is saying, he
[12:11.040 --> 12:17.320]  tweeted that these explosions were beyond suspicious, suggesting they've been the work
[12:17.320 --> 12:26.400]  of some third party in an attempt to sabotage a visit by Japan's prime minister to Tehran,
[12:26.400 --> 12:34.720]  he is there today in an effort to reduce tensions in the Middle East, the US defense official
[12:34.720 --> 12:41.920]  is also saying that Iranian claims to have rescued all 44 crew members are patently false
[12:41.920 --> 12:49.520]  because 21 of the crew members were picked up by the US Navy, now in recent weeks there
[12:49.520 --> 12:55.400]  have been other attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman just outside the Persian Gulf and
[12:55.400 --> 13:03.120]  those previous attacks, those were carried out by mines placed on the hulls of the ship
[13:03.120 --> 13:08.960]  and the US blamed Iran for that, the US did not retaliate for those attacks but it has
[13:08.960 --> 13:15.440]  warned Iran it will be held accountable for any attacks on American interests and the
[13:15.440 --> 13:21.640]  free passage of ships in and out of the Persian Gulf certainly qualifies as an American interest
[13:21.640 --> 13:26.400]  and so much of the world depends on that oil, Anthony.
[13:26.400 --> 13:27.720]  David Martin at the Pentagon.
[13:27.720 --> 13:33.440]  You know I just remembered though, a month ago the head Mula, the Ayatollah of Rock
[13:33.440 --> 13:42.320]  and Rolla over there said, in fact pull this up guys, the exact headline was Iran's leader,
[13:42.320 --> 13:47.760]  Supreme Leader, he pressed TV had it, it was directly out of their state run media, Iran's
[13:47.760 --> 14:04.280]  Supreme Leader vows to retaliate to US sanctions and declares what the exact term he used to
[14:04.280 --> 14:12.880]  pull the quote up, said that they were activating their Hezbollah forces around the world and
[14:12.880 --> 14:19.040]  that the entire world was a battlefield, just pull up Iran's leader threatens to retaliate
[14:19.040 --> 14:26.320]  to US sanctions by hitting soft targets, so just that statement a month ago and I went
[14:26.320 --> 14:30.600]  and checked it, I just believe it when it was on the bottom of CNN, I went and checked
[14:30.600 --> 14:37.720]  press TV and there it was and I meant to cover that, I think I did, ooh that's a big deal,
[14:37.720 --> 14:43.160]  I just moved the needle towards it being Iran, plus this is exactly how they do it with rubber
[14:43.160 --> 14:49.840]  boats at night coming up when those ships are docked or moving through and placing mines
[14:49.840 --> 14:58.240]  on the side, I think Iran's really crazy enough to do this, deny they're doing it, to put
[14:58.240 --> 15:04.000]  pressure on Trump economically, well hell they threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz
[15:04.000 --> 15:11.560]  a month ago too, in the same damn speech, see I'm so used to false flags that everything
[15:11.560 --> 15:15.760]  starts looking like one because there's been so many in history, but the more I percolate
[15:15.760 --> 15:20.800]  on this, they shot their mouth off a month ago, Iran threatens to close the Strait of
[15:20.800 --> 15:27.880]  Hormuz, that'll be everywhere and the other one was Supreme Leader tells Iranian forces
[15:27.880 --> 15:38.200]  worldwide that the entire world is a battlefield and other statements, so I'm not ready to
[15:38.200 --> 15:43.640]  say Iran's behind this, I don't think anybody is and we're gonna look at a history of false
[15:43.640 --> 15:48.120]  flags on the open water when we come back, we'll get into all the other news, we are
[15:48.120 --> 15:53.080]  loaded for bear today, this is again very important transmission, we're sussing and

[20:44.400 --> 20:50.360]  When I woke up this morning and heard that one ship have been torpedoed one bombed in the Gulf
[20:51.000 --> 20:54.320]  Right off the coast of Iran. I said are they really that crazy?
[20:54.320 --> 21:01.040]  Because so many wars get started with a false flag where a country will attack its own ship to blame
[21:01.400 --> 21:03.400]  The nation they want to attack or invade
[21:04.120 --> 21:10.560]  There's many historical examples of that. I'll go into some and I was watching ABC news CNN Fox news
[21:10.560 --> 21:17.680]  And they were unsure and then some US officials started coming out from the Trump administration saying we believe it's Iran
[21:17.680 --> 21:25.360]  But not giving any evidence and then I was sitting here thinking on air earlier and it all hit me
[21:26.680 --> 21:29.000]  The Iranians took credit for this
[21:29.760 --> 21:31.280]  Four months ago
[21:31.280 --> 21:37.080]  Two months ago and about a month ago and my crew was able to pull up the articles. You heard me mention on air from memory
[21:37.800 --> 21:39.800]  So let me just tell you right now
[21:40.480 --> 21:42.480]  Iran is the main
[21:42.480 --> 21:43.760]  suspect and
[21:43.760 --> 21:49.600]  Iran stands to gain from this and Iran thinks that they can push Trump
[21:50.960 --> 21:58.320]  Into backing off sanctions or they'll continue to sabotage ships in the Gulf and then claim
[21:59.080 --> 22:00.520]  that
[22:00.520 --> 22:05.800]  Trump is staging it so that if Trump strikes back they look like the victim
[22:07.560 --> 22:09.560]  So here's the big announcement
[22:09.560 --> 22:15.920]  Iran thinks they can't lose because they think they control the paradigm of choices. I'm speaking directly to Iran right now on their molars
[22:15.920 --> 22:19.120]  I know what you're up to because you've shot your mouth off. I
[22:20.000 --> 22:25.440]  Guess you warned Trump and he didn't listen you think you'll either get us to back off the sanctions and
[22:28.240 --> 22:30.760]  You can superpiece in your proxy war in Yemen
[22:30.760 --> 22:38.640]  Which will mean you control in the region which Saudi Arabia won't put up with so that's not gonna happen or
[22:40.000 --> 22:46.680]  You're going to push the United States into responding because you continue to sink ships connected to the United States
[22:48.280 --> 22:50.280]  And you'll deny it
[22:51.680 --> 22:53.440]  Looking like the victim
[22:53.440 --> 23:00.720]  Now, why do I know that because I read press TV. I've been on press TV about a hundred times and
[23:01.200 --> 23:06.720]  I just got too tired. I don't go on BBC press TV really any of it anymore. Everybody knows that
[23:08.000 --> 23:12.320]  So we don't work for Iran as I've gone on their national television over a hundred times I
[23:13.640 --> 23:17.560]  Read what their government says and what they say domestically and I've got it right here
[23:17.560 --> 23:23.480]  Because if somebody tells you they'll sink ships then it starts happening
[23:26.560 --> 23:29.760]  They said they're going to do it so they are the prime suspect I
[23:30.560 --> 23:36.560]  Ran vows to retaliate if u.s. List revolutionary guard as terror organization. That was April 9th
[23:37.080 --> 23:40.080]  Well, what happened again a month ago?
[23:40.880 --> 23:46.360]  They were listed as a terror group and all of Hezbollah worldwide which they obviously are
[23:46.360 --> 23:52.880]  They see themselves as a paramilitary group inside every country and they're very serious. They make your average
[23:53.280 --> 23:55.280]  Arab terrorist look like a sweetheart
[23:55.440 --> 23:57.440]  When it comes to the effectiveness
[23:58.040 --> 24:03.640]  Very nasty very bad. We've allowed their total infiltration more treason by our leftist governments
[24:04.960 --> 24:10.520]  And guess what I'm going for memory. I think it was about four and a half weeks ago. We just pull up u.s. List
[24:11.960 --> 24:14.680]  Iranian National Guard as terrorist
[24:14.680 --> 24:17.080]  So
[24:17.080 --> 24:24.240]  Trump didn't didn't balk for threat and I ran threatened to sink ships and block the Strait of Hormuz and
[24:25.720 --> 24:28.600]  They vowed to activate their forces around the world
[24:29.280 --> 24:32.680]  That's the London Independent. You can go to press TV and read it yourself
[24:33.680 --> 24:39.760]  Iran raises stakes in us showdown with threat to close Hormuz. That's Bloomberg April 22nd
[24:39.760 --> 24:45.440]  Remember all that and what did they say if you freeze the assets of the Iranian?
[24:47.040 --> 24:54.120]  Revolutionary Guard, it's really the government. That's their bank accounts. That's that's the moolas if you do that. We will start sinking ships
[24:55.440 --> 24:57.440]  in the Strait of Hormuz and
[24:58.200 --> 25:00.200]  Those ships are sinking right now
[25:00.520 --> 25:04.560]  Like we put this big tanker back on screen. Notice there's water shooting out
[25:06.240 --> 25:08.240]  The front of the ship
[25:08.240 --> 25:10.560]  And that's its pumps are on high
[25:11.320 --> 25:16.840]  Thousands of gallons a second are shooting out and the ship is starting to list to its right
[25:17.680 --> 25:23.320]  And that's the helicopter the floor over hours ago. The ship is going to burn and sink
[25:24.280 --> 25:26.280]  99% chance and flood
[25:27.120 --> 25:29.120]  The Gulf of oil
[25:31.080 --> 25:36.280]  That's just one of the two sinking ships so they're they're following the other promise we will sink ships in
[25:36.280 --> 25:38.280]  In the Strait of Hormuz
[25:39.400 --> 25:43.480]  U.S. Blacklist banks individuals for transferring billions to Iran's Revolutionary Guard
[25:44.880 --> 25:49.440]  That's March 26. Yeah, but they went on to list the guard about a month after
[25:50.360 --> 25:54.960]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen Iran says they did it
[25:57.320 --> 25:59.520]  Iran back sleeper cell militants
[25:59.520 --> 26:06.280]  Hibernating in U.S. Positions for attack. Remember that info wars comm article back in 2018
[26:06.800 --> 26:10.640]  When we got the Google internal report of what they wanted banned and
[26:11.480 --> 26:17.600]  Google was spending 15 million dollars to have me delisted but they were paying private outside groups to manipulate the algorithm
[26:17.600 --> 26:23.360]  So when they tell Congress, oh, we don't do it. Oh, no, you just have somebody else do it for you. It's still technically a lie
[26:23.360 --> 26:28.480]  One of the things was that I was talking about Iranian sleeper cells
[26:28.640 --> 26:35.200]  They don't want us talking about that folks because the left is working with Hezbollah. I'm gonna say that again
[26:36.040 --> 26:37.720]  You heard that years ago here now
[26:37.720 --> 26:45.480]  It's been a mainstream news in S13 and Hezbollah work with the Democrats made a deal with the Democrats five years ago
[26:45.960 --> 26:48.800]  To help launder money to help control the Middle East
[26:48.800 --> 26:54.520]  That's what pissed off the Saudis so much and scared the living hell out of them toward now. They'll do whatever Trump says
[26:55.560 --> 26:57.560]  okay, and
[26:58.200 --> 27:00.200]  Now it's all come out like I told you that
[27:01.360 --> 27:03.360]  Former Secretary of State Kerry
[27:03.840 --> 27:09.400]  Goes into these countries like Iran and tells them how to defeat U.S. policy and defeat Trump treason and
[27:10.320 --> 27:12.320]  That they're working with Hezbollah
[27:12.320 --> 27:18.440]  ms-13 Hezbollah these are criminal cutout groups so Obama can give the order and
[27:19.400 --> 27:23.360]  Hezbollah will come to your house or ms-13 will come to your house under orders
[27:23.360 --> 27:28.960]  He doesn't know it comes from Obama or Hillary and then you just hear oh a gang broke in and killed the congressman
[27:29.480 --> 27:34.400]  And they're killing Republican state senators right now as a test. I warned everybody about this last year
[27:34.400 --> 27:38.800]  I said you'll start hearing about senators getting killed at their houses and and then it's gonna move on
[27:39.840 --> 27:41.760]  It's all a test
[27:41.760 --> 27:43.240]  Hezbollah
[27:43.240 --> 27:44.320]  ms-13
[27:44.320 --> 27:49.360]  Have your houses listed and that's why I told you you better have your battle rifles ready
[27:51.520 --> 27:53.520]  They'll kidnap your kids
[27:54.200 --> 27:55.960]  They'll car jack you
[27:55.960 --> 27:57.680]  They'll shoot you in the head
[27:57.680 --> 28:02.960]  They'll throw some heroin at the scene and they've got killers in every town to match
[28:03.840 --> 28:05.000]  Trump
[28:05.000 --> 28:09.600]  They believe and the embedded assassination teams. They're in every US city
[28:09.600 --> 28:15.280]  There aren't just SWAT teams in every city folks. There are multi agency kill teams in every city
[28:15.280 --> 28:17.280]  There have been since the Cold War and
[28:17.720 --> 28:22.280]  Those groups have been mopping up and killing Hezbollah and ms-13 cells
[28:22.280 --> 28:26.880]  I was told this by high-level CIA when Trump was president elect
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.200]  That there was already a civil war and that they had the molas and yes the Democrats
[28:33.120 --> 28:37.120]  Look, they've got the border going down there. They're helping child smuggle you understand
[28:37.120 --> 28:41.400]  That's why Pelosi said ms-13 are God's children and are good people
[28:42.880 --> 28:51.680]  Do you understand do you understand this is real this is treason the Democrats are globalist
[28:51.680 --> 28:56.920]  They hate the country. They want to bring it down. They have murder teams all over the nation
[28:58.840 --> 29:03.520]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs listen to me
[29:03.520 --> 29:09.960]  You don't know me and we'll never meet I had a problem like you once I drank and used to party a little too much
[29:09.960 --> 29:13.600]  Till it got out of control and almost ruined my life

[32:06.640 --> 32:13.440]  Self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and
[32:13.760 --> 32:19.320]  Sustaining one another it is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach
[32:19.320 --> 32:23.120]  It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting
[32:23.720 --> 32:24.680]  self-sustaining
[32:24.680 --> 32:31.560]  Self-structured little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up the audience determines what audience is
[32:31.560 --> 32:37.280]  Ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is whether it's
[32:37.480 --> 32:44.760]  $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that
[32:44.760 --> 32:51.960]  And at the same time support press support speech support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold
[32:51.960 --> 33:02.960]  And it's the ultimate American Democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[33:03.480 --> 33:06.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:06.360 --> 33:34.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios its Alex Jones
[33:34.120 --> 33:39.560]  The evidence at this point is overwhelming. I
[33:41.480 --> 33:47.000]  Ran just months ago said if you put sanctions on our
[33:48.480 --> 33:51.920]  Revolutionary guard around the world we will start bombing ships
[33:52.440 --> 33:58.080]  In the Strait of Hormose and we will block the Strait of Hormose. We will cost you trillions of dollars
[33:58.080 --> 34:08.560]  But then once you do it you then deny it so that you can get the US to attack you and make yourself the victim like they've already been doing with their patrol boats
[34:08.560 --> 34:14.960]  In international water grabbing our troops our sailors our Marines our seals
[34:15.880 --> 34:22.800]  So that's what's happening here. I have no doubt. Yes, there's a long history of false flags and staged events, but
[34:23.640 --> 34:26.160]  No one's talking about how the Iranians nowhere
[34:26.160 --> 34:28.880]  Threatened in April and
[34:30.400 --> 34:33.880]  In the subsequent months that they would do this and now it's happened
[34:34.360 --> 34:42.080]  And that's why the Trump administration saying they are the prime suspect that the Trump administration is not pointed out what they said
[34:43.880 --> 34:47.400]  Remember Trump said never ever ever threaten the United States of America again
[34:47.400 --> 34:54.440]  Or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before that means nuclear weapons in Japanese
[34:54.440 --> 35:02.040]  We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence and death be cautious
[35:03.400 --> 35:06.960]  Well document cam shot, please that was Trump in
[35:09.360 --> 35:11.360]  Just a few weeks ago
[35:13.680 --> 35:15.680]  And again back in 2018
[35:16.760 --> 35:22.560]  Well now Iran has raised the stakes in the US showdown
[35:22.560 --> 35:29.480]  With threat to close the Strait of Hormuz by blowing up ships and other events
[35:30.600 --> 35:34.160]  That's Bloomberg. That's London independent. That is back in late April
[35:34.800 --> 35:37.400]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen. I ran
[35:38.840 --> 35:44.400]  Admits that they're behind it because if they said we're going to do this and then it happens
[35:44.400 --> 35:50.880]  They're the prime suspect. Oh, but notice. Oh, the Japanese leaders here
[35:51.000 --> 35:57.400]  You did this to embarrass our meeting. No, they know Trump isn't gonna attack Iran while the Japanese leaders there
[35:58.200 --> 36:02.320]  and so they use that as a shield as well this stinks like a
[36:03.800 --> 36:05.800]  Persian Shiite mullah
[36:06.840 --> 36:08.840]  concoction if ever I saw one and
[36:09.360 --> 36:11.560]  Trump is going to see
[36:11.560 --> 36:16.480]  Right through it. Yes, Japan wants that cheap oil
[36:19.200 --> 36:26.640]  So Hezbollah's leader and all of them have been shooting their mouths off bragging about this and now they've done it
[36:28.600 --> 36:30.600]  And they think we're stupid
[36:31.400 --> 36:37.760]  So I agree with US officials saying it's highly likely I ran behind new tanker attacks in Gulf of Oman
[36:37.760 --> 36:41.160]  You know if I got up here and I said hypothetically
[36:43.000 --> 36:49.320]  That I'm gonna do some horrible heinous crime if you do X you do X and then that very horrible crime happens
[36:49.600 --> 36:52.840]  People say get that guy. He did it. It's just presumed
[36:57.160 --> 37:00.840]  So we have such a history of false flags and staged events
[37:00.840 --> 37:07.280]  That when people tell you they're going to do something you still got to sit back and look at it
[37:08.560 --> 37:10.560]  But I'll tell you as for me my friends
[37:11.960 --> 37:13.960]  They said they do it
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  They think Trump might back down
[37:18.240 --> 37:20.240]  Take the sanctions off
[37:21.800 --> 37:22.920]  Or
[37:22.920 --> 37:31.800]  They think the US can quote start the war because they have denied it now. Let's talk about what comes next? What happens?
[37:33.160 --> 37:38.880]  You have a couple more of these ships get blown up the United States you can bet your bottom dollar
[37:39.840 --> 37:45.400]  It's going to back a Saudi Arabian attack on Iranian shipping lanes
[37:46.080 --> 37:48.400]  and Iranian military targets and
[37:49.320 --> 37:51.320]  You'll have a bunch of stealth bombers
[37:51.320 --> 37:53.040]  at
[37:53.040 --> 37:57.320]  80,000 feet fly over and drop 2,000 pound bombs all over Iran
[38:00.120 --> 38:01.600]  Now
[38:01.600 --> 38:03.600]  What happens after that?
[38:04.080 --> 38:06.080]  five minutes later
[38:07.360 --> 38:12.600]  Iranian sleeper cells in every major US city and
[38:14.160 --> 38:16.520]  Sheite sleeper cells in Iran and
[38:16.520 --> 38:25.440]  Sheite sleeper cells in Iraq and sheite sleeper cells in any other country that backs what Trump does are
[38:25.960 --> 38:30.000]  Going to have soft targets hit truck bombs
[38:32.160 --> 38:36.480]  Poisoning of air conditioning supply systems. That's what Iranian specialized in
[38:39.280 --> 38:41.280]  Burning buildings down oh
[38:42.720 --> 38:46.160]  No, the Iranians are gonna run around with machine guns and fights with the cops and streets
[38:46.160 --> 38:48.560]  They're gonna drive around in little delivery vehicles
[38:49.280 --> 38:52.800]  The middle of the night burning your houses down nerve-gassing you
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.560]  Dumping nerve gas out at the Capitol. That's what they're gonna do and there's so many of them here
[38:57.800 --> 39:01.720]  Hope everybody enjoys because they're not just from Iran. You see
[39:03.760 --> 39:06.160]  19% of Islam is sheite and
[39:06.840 --> 39:12.800]  They've got sheites from every country in the world that have all purposely
[39:12.800 --> 39:18.240]  Immigrated to the great Satan. So when the great day of judgment comes and the Great War
[39:18.840 --> 39:24.320]  Comes and they think Iran gets nuked during it. That's okay because they're gonna burn all of our cities down
[39:25.320 --> 39:29.960]  And while the cops are busy putting their armor on to go find out what's happening
[39:29.960 --> 39:36.080]  All hell will break loose when they drive a truck bomb right in to the containment center at your local nuclear reactor
[39:36.320 --> 39:38.880]  Like the JJ Pickle Center in north Austin
[39:38.880 --> 39:43.280]  That's the first thing they'll do is places like that that are not guarded
[39:43.280 --> 39:49.560]  They'll drive a big 18-wheeler full of plastic explosives in there. Oh, by the way, if people are asking help Alex
[39:49.560 --> 39:55.800]  Don't say all this stuff. They'll build it. No, no, I know what they're up to. I'm telling you their tactics. Believe me
[39:57.760 --> 40:01.800]  Your average group couldn't carry stuff out like this, so I'm not putting out any secrets here
[40:04.040 --> 40:06.040]  So
[40:06.040 --> 40:10.480]  We've had Western governments from England to the United States to protect
[40:10.920 --> 40:16.720]  Hezbollah and bomb-making factories. They just pulled an article up about it. Pull that back up, please and again
[40:16.720 --> 40:23.080]  I'm gonna tell you this sounds incredible until you realize how the world really works the Democrats are involved in child trafficking
[40:23.440 --> 40:25.280]  Drug trafficking is the most corrupt people
[40:26.280 --> 40:28.280]  You've ever seen
[40:30.520 --> 40:32.520]  British PM asked
[40:32.520 --> 40:38.040]  PM asked the British government will cover Hezbollah bomb factory because of Iran nuclear deal
[40:40.600 --> 40:44.440]  Remember that now that's back in the news today
[40:46.320 --> 40:48.320]  Think about that
[40:49.800 --> 40:56.080]  So you need proxy armies you need muscle you need mafia projection you need power and
[40:57.200 --> 40:59.200]  That's why Obama made a deal with Iran
[40:59.200 --> 41:05.520]  Because they got Shiite networks that narcotics traffic all over the world
[41:07.880 --> 41:14.080]  You know Iran helped overthrow Serbia remember that and one third of the country was given to the Muslims the men were killed and
[41:15.400 --> 41:21.000]  Muslims then took their second bride and there's videos of them bragging this woman is my slave
[41:21.720 --> 41:23.720]  She has my children. She's now under Allah
[41:23.720 --> 41:30.120]  And so that's how this works this is a plan the Arab Spring all of it
[41:31.360 --> 41:33.200]  Obama protected Hezbollah
[41:33.200 --> 41:37.920]  Drug ring to save Iran nuke deals New York Post that was three years ago
[41:40.040 --> 41:45.480]  You think Obama is just some cute community organizer he is a criminal mastermind
[41:46.880 --> 41:48.880]  With the people he works with
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  So they've got Iranian
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.760]  sex traffickers narcotics traffickers
[41:54.280 --> 41:55.720]  killers
[41:55.720 --> 41:59.840]  Paramilitary all over the Western world waiting and you've got Obama
[42:00.160 --> 42:07.440]  Meeting with and carry meeting with and carry going monthly to advise Iran how to defeat America how to defeat Trump
[42:08.520 --> 42:15.720]  And they've got their people embedded all throughout the government and they still think they're going to win and they still dream of Antifa
[42:15.720 --> 42:21.440]  is only their cutout is their decoy their method professor type by day job molester, you know by night Antifa seriously
[42:22.800 --> 42:26.680]  They're just decoys. It'll get some of the blame when they send Hezbollah
[42:28.840 --> 42:30.840]  An MS-13 hit squads
[42:33.120 --> 42:35.120]  To people's houses
[42:35.960 --> 42:39.120]  Oh, and they'll they'll go after the Senate majority leader
[42:39.520 --> 42:41.520]  They'll go after Republicans
[42:41.520 --> 42:45.920]  that that that they think they're safe because the Democrats want
[42:46.240 --> 42:52.720]  Decapitation of the US and they're getting ready to make their move with Iran. The Democrats are a foreign domestic
[42:53.480 --> 42:55.480]  army
[42:56.120 --> 43:01.800]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world
[43:02.640 --> 43:04.640]  history
[43:04.640 --> 43:07.760]  This is a digital AI and forced gag order
[43:07.760 --> 43:11.920]  Not to say the name Alex Jones are in full wars.com
[43:17.160 --> 43:24.960]  This is Nazi Germany level this is racketeering. This is cartels. Mr. President. We need your help. We need it now
[43:25.280 --> 43:32.680]  You can take on big tech. They saw info wars as a dominant independent anti-war pro-human pro-sovereign
[43:32.680 --> 43:37.640]  Pro-family populist organization, so they thought first they come for Alex Jones
[43:38.440 --> 43:41.080]  Then when people say okay take him off the air

[46:00.440 --> 46:07.160]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and
[46:07.160 --> 46:14.520]  And backed up with human waste and debris this is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed
[46:15.080 --> 46:20.200]  Like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products
[46:20.360 --> 46:24.440]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged
[46:25.080 --> 46:31.480]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged the human body gets clogged just like that
[46:31.480 --> 46:39.640]  And you may be experiencing backup too. So if you want some relief some explosive relief go to infowarstore.com and get oxy powder

[47:05.960 --> 47:07.960]  Go
[47:21.880 --> 47:23.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, i'm your host alex jones
[47:24.520 --> 47:28.440]  And our military can take out the iranian molas very very quickly
[47:29.080 --> 47:34.600]  Except they have stay behind networks or terror cells in every major western city
[47:34.600 --> 47:36.600]  Molas in april and may
[47:37.160 --> 47:40.200]  All warned that if trump put sanctions on them
[47:40.760 --> 47:43.240]  On their revolutionary guard that is the government
[47:43.880 --> 47:45.880]  They are the praetorian guard
[47:45.880 --> 47:47.880]  They are the molas
[47:47.880 --> 47:52.920]  They are the Shiite aristocracy the royalty genetically related to muhammad
[47:53.960 --> 47:55.960]  They have their Shiite groups everywhere
[47:56.440 --> 47:58.920]  Paramilitary prepared for major terror attacks
[47:59.160 --> 48:02.600]  They bragged they were going to bomb ships and close the Strait of Hormuz
[48:02.600 --> 48:10.120]  In national television announcements. They've now done it. Ladies and gentlemen, u.s. commanders last week on the 7th
[48:10.920 --> 48:15.160]  Says american forces face imminent threat from
[48:15.960 --> 48:23.320]  Iran you remember that don't you and now they've come out and said we're going to torpedo ships and sink them
[48:23.800 --> 48:28.680]  And now it's happening and now they're saying. Oh, no, america did it. It's a false flag
[48:28.680 --> 48:35.080]  It's unbelievable and it's incredibly dangerous, but the best move is to not give in to the threat
[48:35.960 --> 48:40.840]  Believe me. Most of these iranian sleeper cells since trump got in are being targeted
[48:41.720 --> 48:43.720]  government databases that have
[48:44.600 --> 48:47.720]  Been developed by obama that obama had for controlling these groups
[48:48.680 --> 48:51.560]  Have fallen into the u.s. government's hands
[48:52.280 --> 48:54.280]  And that's why you've got bar
[48:54.680 --> 48:56.680]  And all the rest of the guys have been killed
[48:56.680 --> 49:05.000]  Bar and all the rest the guys that used to be establishment totally in bed with trump and america now because the level of treason by the clinton's and obama
[49:05.880 --> 49:09.640]  Working with the iranians giving them tens of billions and pallets of cash
[49:10.120 --> 49:12.760]  Not just hundreds of millions but billions and billions
[49:13.640 --> 49:18.440]  And and using them as a drug network and as an assassination arm in the west
[49:20.600 --> 49:21.800]  Yes
[49:21.800 --> 49:25.080]  As the muscle for the democrats this this this realization
[49:25.080 --> 49:27.080]  This revelation
[49:27.960 --> 49:29.560]  of how
[49:29.560 --> 49:34.200]  Infiltrated this country was with chai calm support as well has now brought us to the point
[49:35.080 --> 49:37.080]  of world war
[49:37.560 --> 49:39.560]  With iran
[49:39.640 --> 49:44.280]  When I say world war it's because it will trigger a larger crisis
[49:45.160 --> 49:49.560]  Russia would be advised to stay out of it. Russia has drawn down troops in venezuela
[49:50.520 --> 49:52.520]  China would be advised to stay out of it
[49:52.520 --> 50:01.560]  But this could very easily escalate in fact it probably will you've got burning sinking ships right now
[50:04.120 --> 50:06.120]  And no one is on the news
[50:06.920 --> 50:13.960]  Saying iran threatened to bomb ships two months ago if we put sanctions on them and they just did it
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  They admit to it
[50:17.000 --> 50:24.520]  Think about how incredible that is ladies and gentlemen. Think about how dangerous that is
[50:25.400 --> 50:27.400]  Pray for peace ladies and gentlemen
[50:28.040 --> 50:30.040]  but again
[50:30.440 --> 50:33.640]  We are dealing with an ancient enmity between the shiites
[50:34.680 --> 50:36.120]  and the sunnis
[50:36.120 --> 50:39.800]  The sunnis were smart enough to sit on top of mecca and control it
[50:39.800 --> 50:48.440]  The shiites are the minority, but they believe again. They are the rightful muslims because their leaders
[50:49.560 --> 50:54.760]  Come from the bloodline of muhammad. It's like queen elizabeth is a royal bloodline
[50:55.480 --> 50:57.480]  It is a religious
[50:57.800 --> 50:59.800]  royal
[50:59.800 --> 51:01.800]  bloodline
[51:01.800 --> 51:04.440]  It's 19 of islam it wants the kaba
[51:04.920 --> 51:06.600]  It wants the stone
[51:06.600 --> 51:10.360]  It wants control of mecca and medina the other holy sites
[51:11.560 --> 51:14.840]  But it could never get itself a country like saudi arabia did
[51:16.120 --> 51:18.120]  And so it went and got
[51:19.080 --> 51:23.160]  Iran in 1979 and god we should never have let them do it
[51:23.160 --> 51:25.400]  I tell you we should have stopped it right then
[51:25.880 --> 51:29.160]  Because the iranians don't want to live under it. They're really smart nice good people
[51:29.960 --> 51:31.960]  and they've got high IQs
[51:32.040 --> 51:33.400]  and
[51:33.400 --> 51:37.320]  They're trouble in a war and it's just a bad situation
[51:37.880 --> 51:40.040]  But they've gotten them they've rain washed them
[51:41.960 --> 51:44.600]  And trump for several years has put iran on notice
[51:45.320 --> 51:48.360]  That if they attack any of our forces he's going to go after them
[51:49.400 --> 51:54.680]  And trump has tweeted that there'd been no attacks on ships the first couple years he was in well now the the attacks are back
[51:55.080 --> 52:00.280]  And iran's reign of terror is being extended. So pray for peace ladies and gentlemen, but prepare
[52:00.280 --> 52:02.280]  for war
[52:03.720 --> 52:08.600]  So first they started with sabotage of well tankers a month ago now. It's outright bombing them
[52:11.400 --> 52:15.480]  Trump's come out and told them again over and over again. They're playing with fire, but they're not listening again
[52:15.480 --> 52:19.320]  I'm going to say it. Iran said they'd do it if trump did x
[52:20.120 --> 52:21.720]  they just
[52:21.720 --> 52:26.440]  Did what they said they do and I agree with the trump administration that it's iran
[52:26.440 --> 52:31.720]  Trump is not the type to pull false flags very low chance some third-party group could have done it
[52:32.360 --> 52:36.440]  Or that Saudi Arabia could have bombed its own ships, but that's not generally what they do
[52:37.560 --> 52:44.760]  We'll see ladies and gentlemen. This is a very very dangerous time. And I think I've made my point on that. Okay
[52:45.320 --> 52:48.920]  As new developments unfold, we will go through all of this
[52:50.440 --> 52:55.240]  I've got a team of several people just constantly scanning everything and you better believe
[52:55.240 --> 52:57.240]  And you better believe that as this unfolds
[52:58.280 --> 53:04.520]  We will give you the latest on what could turn out to be a new world war just as latimer putin warned
[53:05.480 --> 53:11.320]  Two days ago with all these flash points in the south china sea india and pakistan iran and
[53:12.920 --> 53:14.920]  Saudi Arabia
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.200]  It is it is just absolutely very very dangerous
[53:18.520 --> 53:20.520]  Borders being collapsed everywhere
[53:20.520 --> 53:25.560]  Islamic invasions being funded by the un obama said all this in motion
[53:26.600 --> 53:30.440]  But obama was supposed to have hillary in power during this point
[53:33.960 --> 53:37.480]  So they'd have this big global crisis that we would just capitulate to islam
[53:39.640 --> 53:43.880]  Well, it's not happening the way it was supposed to happen. It's not unfolding
[53:44.600 --> 53:48.360]  The way the globalists wanted and they are now entering full panic mode
[53:48.360 --> 53:50.360]  Okay, let me judiciously
[53:51.160 --> 53:53.160]  Tell you what is
[53:53.640 --> 53:55.640]  Coming up
[53:55.640 --> 53:58.760]  There's a very important article on news wars.com
[53:59.640 --> 54:04.520]  It's also on europe wars.com. There's a lot of original content on europe wars.com
[54:04.520 --> 54:07.880]  There were two reporters in europe three reporters in europe
[54:08.600 --> 54:11.640]  Congress could slash migrant surge
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.800]  By changing two laws says dhs chief
[54:15.800 --> 54:21.640]  This is getting no attention. It needs to go viral. We want to fix these problems very very quickly
[54:23.560 --> 54:25.560]  Another report sweden
[54:25.720 --> 54:28.360]  This covers 90 percent of moroccan miners actually adults
[54:29.000 --> 54:33.080]  Shock footage a thousand migrants swarm invade us through open border fence
[54:34.360 --> 54:36.520]  That's just some of what's coming up and a bunch more

[55:30.680 --> 55:31.800]  And her
[55:31.800 --> 55:33.800]  Doesn't look like a demon. She just is a demon
[55:34.360 --> 55:39.560]  So that's coming up and so much more today that i haven't gotten to so many clips so much more
[55:39.560 --> 55:42.120]  Um, i'm just going to tell listeners this
[55:44.040 --> 55:49.080]  It's critical that we be on the air and stronger than ever going into this election
[55:51.080 --> 55:53.080]  And the enemy and the globalists and
[55:53.640 --> 55:55.640]  individuals appointed by obama
[55:55.720 --> 55:57.720]  in the bomb administration
[55:57.720 --> 56:04.200]  Are using law enforcement tactics against us like we were an organized crime organization try to shut us down
[56:04.280 --> 56:06.840]  It's not going to work. They're going to end up getting a lot of trouble
[56:07.960 --> 56:09.320]  but
[56:09.320 --> 56:12.120]  We need your hopes and prayers and we need you to understand this isn't a game
[56:12.840 --> 56:13.240]  also
[56:13.240 --> 56:16.920]  I need people to just commit to go to m4warstore.com because money
[56:17.640 --> 56:21.640]  In this fight is almost everything word of mouth and prayer is key
[56:23.400 --> 56:26.760]  We've got the best supplements the best minerals the best vitamins the best
[56:27.320 --> 56:30.920]  Nutraceuticals you're going to find anywhere the highest grade the best quality
[56:32.440 --> 56:35.880]  A lot of brands out there have less product in it than the bottle cost
[56:35.880 --> 56:41.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we put out the best highest quality at a very affordable price
[56:41.800 --> 56:43.320]  Whether it's the turmeric
[56:43.320 --> 56:46.120]  Our bodies or whether it's brain force or whatever the product is

[57:16.520 --> 57:19.720]  And we sold out of a huge supply of it. I doubled the order

[57:56.520 --> 57:59.480]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions
[57:59.480 --> 58:03.480]  It's the way of their great destiny to merge with ai gods
[58:03.800 --> 58:07.960]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension
[58:08.200 --> 58:13.080]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives
[58:13.400 --> 58:19.320]  Is our bodies if I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from fourslife.com. I couldn't do it
[58:19.800 --> 58:27.400]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality methylcobalamin and double the strength of it
[58:27.400 --> 58:29.400]  In a new formula ultra 12

[1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:20.440]  Oh
[1:00:31.720 --> 1:00:40.440]  I'll send an s o s to the world. I'll send an s o s to the world. I hope that someone gets my
[1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:43.560]  I hope that someone gets my
[1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:51.000]  I hope that someone gets my message in the box. All right. What I'm going to do right now is
[1:00:52.840 --> 1:00:55.480]  Tell you a little bit more about that special that I barely plugged last hour
[1:00:55.480 --> 1:00:58.600]  And then I'm going to hit the ground running and all the other news next segment
[1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:02.440]  Recovering this right now
[1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:07.560]  What I'm going to do now is
[1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:14.760]  Well, what I'm going to do now is just kind of sit back and think about where the world is
[1:01:16.520 --> 1:01:18.520]  And where it's headed and what's unfolding
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:22.520]  Because it really is just crazy
[1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:28.680]  And I can't believe that at this point in history when America is in a position like this
[1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:31.880]  We've got a president that's just trying to
[1:01:32.440 --> 1:01:34.440]  Let the country be prosperous and survive
[1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:40.840]  To have so many people lined up against them because they're so weak-minded and they've drunk the Kool-Aid of the establishment medium
[1:01:41.640 --> 1:01:43.640]  And I'll tell the establishment something too. You're crazy
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  You're really crazy
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:48.200]  betting
[1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:50.200]  With the globalist
[1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:55.400]  Against this country. So when I come back, I'll get into all the news and all the information
[1:01:56.120 --> 1:01:59.720]  We've got several guests joining us today as well, but I'm going to go to a special report here
[1:01:59.720 --> 1:02:06.600]  A lot of interesting stuff to get to. There's there's there's dozens of these that we need to really cover in great detail
[1:02:08.680 --> 1:02:10.680]  But I want to
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:20.440]  Get into just the first few minutes of when I confronted sundar we ran this at the start of the show yesterday
[1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:25.240]  And it's important
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:29.240]  It needs to be seen
[1:02:31.560 --> 1:02:34.520]  I thought I had your stays less today, but I didn't have that
[1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:39.000]  So I'll get by the next segment your stays list
[1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:42.040]  And now I can tell you about the name of that video
[1:02:43.320 --> 1:02:46.200]  Derek brain put together a very important four minute video
[1:02:47.480 --> 1:02:49.480]  that
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:52.440]  The brace it all down
[1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:54.440]  That breaks it all down
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:02:57.880]  So we'll be airing that later in the show as well
[1:03:00.360 --> 1:03:05.000]  But I just sit back and I think about obama and hillary and
[1:03:06.280 --> 1:03:08.280]  All of them in bed with the globalist
[1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:13.240]  All the things they're doing all things are up to and the fact that they've gotten away with all this
[1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:17.160]  And it just makes me sick
[1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:21.720]  And I just wonder how much of this we're going to put up with and
[1:03:22.920 --> 1:03:26.920]  You know, why do we put up with all this? No, it's because we're a nation of TV heads
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:30.040]  Yeah, we're all the blame
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:33.640]  But see there a lot of folks aren't TV heads. They're hardcore criminals
[1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:35.960]  They have criminal minds
[1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:37.960]  They work with other criminal regimes
[1:03:38.120 --> 1:03:40.120]  Come up with criminal schemes
[1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:46.680]  And that's what they've done
[1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:49.320]  So when we come back
[1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:54.200]  I'm gonna get into all that here on air for everybody
[1:03:58.040 --> 1:04:01.640]  It's gonna be perfect that we have Matt Bracken on the fourth hour because he's
[1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:07.160]  In the Middle East but in the military but the Navy SEAL written a lot about war with iran and what he thinks is gonna happen with it
[1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:12.760]  So that should be interesting when we get to that as well. And I also intend to open the phones up today
[1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:18.920]  And we have a lot of exciting things being said and done by the president dealing with censorship
[1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:23.240]  And I've actually seen some good movement on that front. There's also
[1:04:24.360 --> 1:04:26.360]  a whole project veritas situation
[1:04:27.960 --> 1:04:32.120]  That has expanded quite a bit with the red-handed censorship
[1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:35.720]  Because as I've said, they don't just censor
[1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:37.720]  They don't just censor
[1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:42.760]  They defame you in the process of it
[1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:46.040]  And then they blackball you and financially ruin you
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:51.160]  So there's an added criminality to this that isn't just oh, it's their platform. Let them do it
[1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:54.600]  No, no, they remove you so you can be destroyed
[1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:03.800]  Infowars the most banned network in the world
[1:05:03.800 --> 1:05:08.360]  We have a new super special. It's on everything with force in its name
[1:05:08.920 --> 1:05:14.440]  The new already best-selling space force america's back awesome shirt that I love and everybody else is loving

[1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:23.080]  It's 33 off because we saw the t-shirt of 50 off that'd be at cost all the other force products
[1:05:23.160 --> 1:05:29.800]  It's all 50 off dna force plus that is such a huge deal. That is the best goq 10 pq q system
[1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:35.240]  It's just unbelievable. It does folks 50 off. No, nobody gets close to that price rain force plus amazing
[1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:41.480]  Ferbo force, which is just tearing our energy clean healthy focused amazing ultimate female force is incredible as well
[1:05:41.640 --> 1:05:46.200]  It's 33 percent off. We're about to sell out of that all of the force products. It's got force in the name
[1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:51.640]  It's 50 to 33 off at info wars store dot com info wars store dot com
[1:05:51.640 --> 1:05:59.400]  info wars the most banned network in the world
[1:05:59.400 --> 1:06:12.680]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:06:30.360 --> 1:06:32.360]  You
[1:06:39.240 --> 1:06:41.720]  President trump has said
[1:06:43.320 --> 1:06:48.840]  That he is going to go after big tech now with antitrust and that they're going to be very very sorry for what they've done
[1:06:50.040 --> 1:06:54.680]  He's decided to go after facebook youtube his parent company google and alphabet
[1:06:54.680 --> 1:06:58.840]  And of course apple. We told you all that first in that order
[1:07:01.160 --> 1:07:05.560]  He met with jack dorsi jack dorsi promised him nothing was going on. There was no censorship
[1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:13.000]  trump's been shown definitive proof by us intelligence agency analyst their experts in cybercrime
[1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:17.240]  And he's been shown a definitive proof by briefings given to him by
[1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:20.200]  the folks at project veritas
[1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:24.760]  Where trump's actually commissioned research into it, that's no secret
[1:07:25.240 --> 1:07:30.120]  And he's been given briefings by three law firms that I had written up for him two years ago and a year ago
[1:07:30.760 --> 1:07:36.760]  And he has been shown a massive breakdown proof by the head of the campaign mr. Parcell
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  who's also an internet marketing expert
[1:07:40.280 --> 1:07:44.200]  And so when he came out over the weekend and said you will pay for this
[1:07:45.080 --> 1:07:47.400]  It's because he knows that jack lied to him
[1:07:47.400 --> 1:07:53.240]  Twitter should let the band conservative voices back on their platform without restriction
[1:07:53.880 --> 1:07:57.320]  It's called freedom of speech remember you're making a giant mistake
[1:07:58.680 --> 1:08:00.120]  That was this weekend
[1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:05.800]  When is twitter going to allow the very popular conservative voices that it's been so viciously shut down back on
[1:08:06.840 --> 1:08:08.840]  And into the open
[1:08:09.400 --> 1:08:11.080]  It is time
[1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:13.800]  So that was a few weeks ago then this weekend he comes out and says
[1:08:15.080 --> 1:08:17.080]  You're in trouble
[1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:19.080]  That's a big deal
[1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:24.920]  So we're living in incredible times, but I want to just tell the audience something if you hadn't been
[1:08:26.600 --> 1:08:28.600]  Banging the drum
[1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:35.320]  If you hadn't been taking action if you hadn't been calling congress if you hadn't been calling talk radio
[1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:38.120]  Tucker Carlson hadn't been doing when he was doing if matt drudge
[1:08:38.200 --> 1:08:42.920]  He hadn't been when he was doing this would not be starting to happen because if we lose the free speech we lose at all
[1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:46.280]  You ask why would the globalists be so bold? Well, it's because
[1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:52.760]  It's about power. It's about control. They've gotten away with it so long. They think they're invincible
[1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:56.440]  But do you remember sundar
[1:08:56.520 --> 1:09:01.160]  Pachai the google frontman lying to congress last year and this year when I confronted him
[1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:04.840]  And jack dorsi and others
[1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:09.000]  Hell they wouldn't even testify to congress before that they were so arrogant
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:14.280]  They wouldn't work with the military. They were so arrogant, but now they're not as arrogant as they used to be
[1:09:15.080 --> 1:09:20.120]  Because the cows are coming home to roost. Here's a compilation in the last year
[1:09:21.160 --> 1:09:24.760]  Of some of what's happened and how info wars has been at the very
[1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:28.360]  tip of the spear as we promised you we would
[1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:32.600]  At point like range confronting google
[1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:38.200]  Confronting twitter confronting facebook confront confronting these lying politicians
[1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:41.240]  And now it's paying off
[1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:43.240]  And that's why you support us
[1:09:43.320 --> 1:09:48.360]  This is listener participation radio and tv. This is take back america and you've done it
[1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:52.120]  We're not complete yet, but you're turning the tide and so
[1:09:53.080 --> 1:09:57.880]  I salute you and I salute this crew and I salute everybody that's made this transmission possible because
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:03.800]  Without info wars, we would not be in this position and without you there would be no info wars. So I think that's
[1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:06.360]  Clearly
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:08.120]  Understood that you
[1:10:08.120 --> 1:10:10.360]  Are the mbps in this fight
[1:10:11.160 --> 1:10:13.720]  Without you this country and this planet's done
[1:10:14.920 --> 1:10:16.520]  Now you think about that
[1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:18.520]  Here's the last year's action
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:23.400]  Would love to have me arrested and killed guaranteed
[1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:25.400]  I
[1:10:27.640 --> 1:10:33.000]  Am here because there is a concerted effort by the democratic party and multinational corporations in big tech
[1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:41.640]  To silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices info wars founder alex jones is calling out alleged collusion between google and democrats
[1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:46.840]  You know google is helping china with dragon y and you know that they're helping censor
[1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:51.560]  And you know you know that you've sold this country out and you won't even help the pedagogical help the chicoms
[1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:55.240]  You bet on the wrong country sundar. We're aware of his lying to congress
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:11:00.040]  We're aware of him in the dragonfly project that's already been operational for years inside the chinese government now
[1:11:00.040 --> 1:11:03.720]  It's just being rolled out the general public sundar you're engaged in treason
[1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:09.880]  You've had google executives lie to congress. You're not censory conservative the big tech companies and and the head of apple admit
[1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:13.160]  That they met with senator warner who's running this whole thing
[1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:20.200]  To begin shutting down conservatives or the democrats threatened to federalize big tech if they did not basically roll over to them
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:25.960]  I know we had alex jones in the room earlier promoting conspiracy theories alex jones
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:31.480]  Obviously is the one that conspiracy theorists whose brand is bullying. You didn't call me to testify in america
[1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:35.880]  I have a right to fix my accusers and you congressman doge are a liar and a fraud
[1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:46.040]  Twitter is planning to permanently suspend alex jones's personal account at info wars
[1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:53.320]  This comes after twitter CEO jack dorsey was on capital hill yesterday speaking with lawmakers twitter gives alex jones
[1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:56.200]  The boot the social networking site permanently banning
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.480]  He and his media company info wars
[1:12:02.520 --> 1:12:06.280]  But I have a right to face my accusers jack they're lying about me and they're trying to be platforming
[1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:10.280]  26 companies working in concert violating the Sherman any trust act and now
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:15.000]  Senator warner and senator widen have said quote. There's thousands of sites worse than alex jones
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.920]  So we're becoming like cuba. We're becoming like vietnam. We're coming like china
[1:12:18.920 --> 1:12:24.600]  So regardless what we'll think about me or the straw man should I have a first amendment or should these companies be able
[1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:28.760]  To to violate the whole safe arbor hack to all that and then ban conservatives en masse
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:33.000]  I don't know anything about your site man. We're also standing up
[1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:40.920]  To social media censorship. That's the new thing our interview was cut short because he was confronted
[1:12:40.920 --> 1:12:46.760]  By alex jones of info wars right here in the hallway. It's weird, man. Oh, yeah, it's really where there's no purge of conservatives
[1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:49.320]  shadow banning
[1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:51.400]  Bias in social media
[1:12:52.200 --> 1:12:58.760]  Concern about bias in social media. Well, I think the bigger bias is against freedom of expression. Everybody should be there's a there's a look
[1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:01.320]  I support going after here, but you said don't exist
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:03.880]  It's not a heckler. I depressed a gaggle. Look at this guy
[1:13:04.040 --> 1:13:07.400]  He's saying that I don't exist and there I just don't know who you are man
[1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:12.200]  I don't read your website sure and they do like me and these very parents and then he plays dumb
[1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:19.560]  info wars.com. You know what it is does google does facebook does that's why you think it'll actually be regulated like what do they need to be right?
[1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:21.880]  Marco Rubio snake
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:24.760]  This is a little crap boy here. All right, man. Yeah, who are you?
[1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:28.440]  Yeah, sure. I swear to god. I don't know who you are man. You better hope you don't be platforming tens of millions of views
[1:13:28.920 --> 1:13:33.000]  Info wars better than russian lembaugh. He knows who info wars is playing this joke over here
[1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:34.520]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work
[1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:40.120]  The most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host alex jones for many on the left
[1:13:40.440 --> 1:13:43.400]  The view seems to have become that if you can't beat them
[1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:48.680]  Prevent them from speaking on twitter the top tweet links to an info wars story
[1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:55.080]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized
[1:13:55.160 --> 1:14:01.560]  The system self-corrected that's not that shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore should be a usa article the last time i checked
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:08.520]  But you saw this you at usa today at lunch. I did yeah, and this and I also saw the system system corrected
[1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:16.040]  Even the new york times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from from the internet and communicating with each other
[1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:18.200]  Just like communist china
[1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:24.760]  We need you to act now and move against big tech censorship president trump cnn and the democrats
[1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:29.160]  You know are destroying the first amendment and these will be stood up against these are very extreme individuals
[1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:34.600]  And no matter what anyone tells you they are extremists, and that's why facebook decided to get rid of them
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:42.760]  Goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that trump's wrong. There's no censorship with conservatives or patriots
[1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:47.320]  You are incredibly shameful. How are you doing alex? You're just a look at you
[1:14:47.880 --> 1:14:49.880]  You are literally an anti-american
[1:14:50.440 --> 1:14:55.720]  Antifree speech coward shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the first amendment
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:15:01.880]  But instead a tap dogging calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech
[1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:09.480]  Info wars the most banned network in the world
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:13.320]  And now we are in prime position
[1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:18.840]  We've taken the hits we've gone through a lot, but because of your support
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:21.640]  We have now lazed the target
[1:15:22.600 --> 1:15:24.600]  for trump to come in
[1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:27.560]  And elements of our government that want this country to survive
[1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:33.000]  And elements of the corporate world that don't want to be ruled by our new kings in silicon valley
[1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:35.480]  Who themselves are commanded by the chai comms
[1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:38.200]  To take out the globalist politically
[1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:41.000]  We have licked them up like a christmas tree
[1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:47.080]  So everybody can see who the problem is and now the vaporization is about to begin
[1:15:47.640 --> 1:15:51.000]  Watch my friends. Believe it. It's already started

[1:20:39.640 --> 1:20:42.140]  We're gonna get into something that is
[1:20:44.040 --> 1:20:46.040]  Quite frankly horrifying
[1:20:46.600 --> 1:20:50.360]  But ladies and gentlemen, it's got to be covered if we're gonna protect the children
[1:20:51.480 --> 1:20:53.980]  And future generations in this nation
[1:20:53.980 --> 1:21:00.460]  Throughout history there have been cults that form inside different civilizations
[1:21:01.180 --> 1:21:05.100]  During their declines that are obsessed with sex with children
[1:21:05.820 --> 1:21:07.820]  And obsessed with sacrificing children
[1:21:08.460 --> 1:21:10.700]  You know to any archaeological site in the world
[1:21:11.260 --> 1:21:16.860]  From ancient china to ancient africa to ancient europe to ancient mezzo america and you will find
[1:21:17.740 --> 1:21:21.340]  A priest class having sex with children at first
[1:21:21.340 --> 1:21:23.340]  And then killing them
[1:21:26.940 --> 1:21:31.980]  Now the vehicle used today for all of this is the lgbt
[1:21:33.020 --> 1:21:35.020]  qx yz movement
[1:21:38.140 --> 1:21:42.940]  And at public schools all across the country children as young as five are being indoctrinated
[1:21:44.220 --> 1:21:49.100]  Into two daddies two mommies and are having their their education sexualized
[1:21:49.100 --> 1:21:53.660]  And they're having their own gender confused and their children
[1:21:55.900 --> 1:22:00.700]  And so when they then get it confused and say oh, I I I do want to be the other sex
[1:22:01.500 --> 1:22:07.580]  They're lied to and told they really can be another sex or you could be a penguin or you could be a dolphin
[1:22:08.060 --> 1:22:11.580]  Like south park famously made fun of eight years ago
[1:22:12.540 --> 1:22:15.020]  But eight years later they won't even make fun of it now
[1:22:15.020 --> 1:22:22.860]  Because silicon valley will take you off the air because it's the religion in silicon valley to hate america
[1:22:23.180 --> 1:22:28.940]  To hate capitalism and to hate the family and i'm going to tie it all together here in this segment in the next
[1:22:29.020 --> 1:22:32.380]  But here's just the news today without even looking
[1:22:35.340 --> 1:22:40.940]  School district to bust students to gay pride parade that's right. You don't go to the planetarium
[1:22:42.540 --> 1:22:44.540]  Or the zoo
[1:22:44.540 --> 1:22:50.300]  You get to get out of class and it's encouraged and go to the gay pride parade you ever been to a gay pride parade
[1:22:52.460 --> 1:22:54.460]  I was downtown a few years ago
[1:22:54.940 --> 1:22:58.300]  On halloween and they had a gay pride parade and I was like what is this it was
[1:22:59.180 --> 1:23:02.300]  Naked men some of them having sex with each other
[1:23:03.500 --> 1:23:06.140]  When I was walking across the street just to go to a restaurant
[1:23:07.980 --> 1:23:11.100]  I mean folks you don't take kids to a gay
[1:23:12.460 --> 1:23:13.980]  pride
[1:23:13.980 --> 1:23:15.100]  parade
[1:23:15.100 --> 1:23:20.140]  We have to cut most of the stuff we film at these out because it can't go out of a broadcast television
[1:23:20.620 --> 1:23:23.980]  including scantily glad five and six year old girl and boys
[1:23:25.020 --> 1:23:27.020]  twerking their asses
[1:23:27.020 --> 1:23:30.220]  To men and women the whole thing is pedophilic
[1:23:31.740 --> 1:23:33.740]  And now they admit
[1:23:33.740 --> 1:23:39.580]  The british government has mps members of parliament and major think tanks say sex with kids is good kids like it
[1:23:39.580 --> 1:23:45.580]  It's healthy. It's wonderful. Um, that was just yesterday. Uh, let make child porn legal
[1:23:46.860 --> 1:23:49.340]  There's all these shows about children and sex and
[1:23:50.460 --> 1:23:55.340]  Salon and the new york times talk about how pedophiles aren't criminals. They just love children and
[1:23:57.020 --> 1:23:59.500]  Buddha judges boyfriend or husband won't even say that
[1:24:01.500 --> 1:24:04.380]  Love knows no age and that's the new nameless slogan
[1:24:04.380 --> 1:24:10.460]  So you see it everywhere and little kids dancing half naked on tv having men throw dollar bills at them
[1:24:12.940 --> 1:24:14.940]  So this is all happening
[1:24:15.340 --> 1:24:19.260]  instead of sending kids to these over sexualized events they should really be focusing on
[1:24:20.220 --> 1:24:27.740]  failing schools in the district adan salazar reports for info wars.com the austin american statesman gushingly reports on how great it is
[1:24:28.460 --> 1:24:30.700]  And now they're gonna bust the little kids
[1:24:31.980 --> 1:24:33.580]  To the gay pride
[1:24:33.580 --> 1:24:35.580]  Parade and you know what? We'll be there
[1:24:36.140 --> 1:24:40.380]  videotaping it and showing the child abuse. Oh, but guess who else will be there?
[1:24:42.060 --> 1:24:45.020]  They always act like we're trying to stop these events. I had tifa
[1:24:46.620 --> 1:24:48.620]  mask men
[1:24:49.180 --> 1:24:51.020]  with guns
[1:24:51.020 --> 1:24:53.260]  promise to show up at the gay pride parade to make sure
[1:24:54.220 --> 1:24:57.100]  Haters don't get to show you what's happening with the children
[1:24:57.100 --> 1:25:02.700]  And the news will all sanitize it very nicely when they set the kids up on their knees
[1:25:05.580 --> 1:25:09.340]  Sometimes unannounced in a convicted pedophile hyzer child sit on their knee
[1:25:09.980 --> 1:25:14.140]  And then what does the local news in houston say you gotta get them while they're young?
[1:25:15.180 --> 1:25:17.180]  That's a quote
[1:25:17.180 --> 1:25:18.780]  so
[1:25:18.780 --> 1:25:24.060]  Antifa won't just be out there with their guns when your kids get bussed to the gay pride parade
[1:25:24.060 --> 1:25:32.060]  No, ladies and gentlemen antiva vows to defend drag queen story time at texas library

[1:26:03.900 --> 1:26:08.060]  It was the big middle of the week for kids that aren't in kindergarten yet
[1:26:08.060 --> 1:26:13.820]  And people are like what the hell when they showed up to it and there was a dude with a clown outfit

[1:26:19.180 --> 1:26:24.620]  My two-year-old daughter has gone to that library before for story time
[1:26:25.900 --> 1:26:30.060]  And I remember hearing about it and I said, you know, you might not want to go to that big one downtown
[1:26:30.060 --> 1:26:34.060]  Even though it has the best story times just like two hours really good story time readers
[1:26:34.060 --> 1:26:40.060]  Because they're gonna slip, you know, what in there? She goes oh come on. Well, guess what? They did my daughter wasn't there

[1:27:09.100 --> 1:27:12.780]  And you know, what's gonna happen when we find out what we found out in other areas
[1:27:13.020 --> 1:27:17.020]  You're gonna go to jail jail jail jail jail jail of any of your convicted pedos
[1:27:18.220 --> 1:27:22.860]  Which they'll be plenty swimming like sharks around you know, bleeding baby seals
[1:27:23.980 --> 1:27:25.980]  Antipa vows to defend
[1:27:25.980 --> 1:27:31.980]  Drag queen story time at texas library. They're gonna defend like the beaches of marmondie
[1:27:32.780 --> 1:27:40.780]  Antifa has pledged to protect a drag queen story time event at the texas library to ensure that protesters will not interrupt
[1:27:41.500 --> 1:27:47.100]  Oh, they won't they won't let you interrupt their police officers the children's exposure
[1:27:47.980 --> 1:27:50.780]  Oh to the far-left trans agenda
[1:27:51.980 --> 1:27:53.980]  Which helps to protect the citizens of texas
[1:27:53.980 --> 1:27:55.980]  citizens agenda
[1:27:55.980 --> 1:27:57.980]  Which hell doesn't just
[1:27:57.980 --> 1:27:59.980]  You know
[1:27:59.980 --> 1:28:01.980]  Bugger, you know bend the kids over and bugger them
[1:28:03.980 --> 1:28:07.980]  Oh, no, no, this will teach him to chop their genitals off
[1:28:07.980 --> 1:28:15.980]  And so austin's antifa chapter called atx resistance action to malice group announced their call to action on facebook ahead of the drag queen event
[1:28:15.980 --> 1:28:21.980]  Said to take place at the leander public library saturday june 15th
[1:28:21.980 --> 1:28:23.980]  Hosted by the open
[1:28:23.980 --> 1:28:25.980]  Cathedral church
[1:28:25.980 --> 1:28:33.980]  And they go on to all their comments. Oh, I wonder if they'll be at this event where the two lesbians cut their son's
[1:28:35.980 --> 1:28:37.980]  Penis off he didn't like it
[1:28:37.980 --> 1:28:39.980]  He cried for daddy daddy tried to save him
[1:28:39.980 --> 1:28:45.980]  But the police that's in the news wouldn't help him because you know if your mom cuts your genitals off of scissors
[1:28:45.980 --> 1:28:51.980]  It's okay. Well, then they stabbed him to death. I wondered if antifa was there to help
[1:28:51.980 --> 1:28:55.980]  He was nine years old. They stabbed him to death. How liberal

[1:32:52.980 --> 1:32:54.980]  You know there's what things go websites
[1:32:54.980 --> 1:33:17.980]  Go there
[1:33:17.980 --> 1:33:25.980]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[1:33:25.980 --> 1:33:28.980]  You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he
[1:33:28.980 --> 1:33:33.980]  Live from the infowars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[1:33:33.980 --> 1:33:49.980]  Imagine 20 years ago you read a science fiction book where armed communists in black physically attack whoever they want to get away with it
[1:33:49.980 --> 1:33:56.980]  and where children are taken in many cases to convicted pedophiles in some cases when the parents aren't even told in public schools
[1:33:56.980 --> 1:34:05.980]  and in libraries and sat on the lap of huge obese fat men in clown outfits while they cry
[1:34:05.980 --> 1:34:11.980]  and then local news in Houston says haha gotta get them while they're young
[1:34:11.980 --> 1:34:19.980]  No one would ever believe that and then you'd have a kid who's autistic and they admit that's who they're getting is mentally ill children
[1:34:19.980 --> 1:34:23.980]  because they don't understand what's happening they perform at gay night clubs
[1:34:23.980 --> 1:34:27.980]  so they're pedophile night clubs throwing cash at them
[1:34:27.980 --> 1:34:34.980]  and then and then the sponsors is a convicted famous drug dealer who chopped a man up with a saw
[1:34:34.980 --> 1:34:40.980]  served 18 years in prison and then he says on video and they say on video
[1:34:40.980 --> 1:34:46.980]  We're now going to talk about children and drag queens so bring your especially small children to the television
[1:34:46.980 --> 1:34:50.980]  We want to corrupt them and they goes he goes haha
[1:34:50.980 --> 1:34:54.980]  Would you like me to play it back that cue that up first
[1:34:54.980 --> 1:35:02.980]  so in the psychological manuals and before there were psychological manuals that the Germans developed 200 years ago
[1:35:02.980 --> 1:35:08.980]  if someone started chopping their fingers off or their genitals off we called them crazy people
[1:35:08.980 --> 1:35:16.980]  and said they were dangerous and if they were only hurting themselves we would throw them out of the village
[1:35:16.980 --> 1:35:22.980]  or lock them up but if they hurt other people we'd kill them
[1:35:22.980 --> 1:35:32.980]  but now if you teach children that are mentally ill and autistic or Down syndrome to chop their testicles off it's stunning and brave
[1:35:32.980 --> 1:35:39.980]  so I thought I would just get to this before I talk about something you're not going to believe and play the Sundar Pachai clip
[1:35:39.980 --> 1:35:51.980]  but here are two of the sponsors the men who launched the club kid movement which was underaged teenagers being gang banged at gay clubs
[1:35:51.980 --> 1:35:59.980]  and then now they hang around with 8, 9, 10, 11 year olds who have money put in their G strings and they say we want to corrupt your children
[1:35:59.980 --> 1:36:07.980]  and behind them in the videos it says Rohibinol which is a date rape drug and the little kid in other videos says I like to take ketamine
[1:36:07.980 --> 1:36:12.980]  which again is a folks I want to show you things here but we're on a lot of TV stations
[1:36:12.980 --> 1:36:19.980]  now some of this is from PBS you can show surgeries and things in which documentary that's how South Park was able to do it
[1:36:19.980 --> 1:36:26.980]  I don't want to show you a sex change video but I think I am so that's coming up your discretion advised next segment
[1:36:26.980 --> 1:36:36.980]  but you need to understand folks most of these it's now mentally retarded children and autistics that are being captured by these people
[1:36:36.980 --> 1:36:42.980]  so let's play a clip of the famous murderer who now manages children who dance half naked for men
[1:36:42.980 --> 1:36:43.980]  here it is
[1:36:43.980 --> 1:36:47.980]  and now we've got something to show you and we have to warn you ladies and gentlemen
[1:36:47.980 --> 1:36:54.980]  if you've got young or impressionable children in your household bring them to the screen right now
[1:36:54.980 --> 1:37:03.980]  what we're going to show you is going to leave an impression on them and we hope the impression will be that they grow up if they're 3 or 4 or 5 years old
[1:37:03.980 --> 1:37:06.980]  to become 7 or 8 year old drag queen for farmers
[1:37:09.980 --> 1:37:10.980]  can't make that up
[1:37:10.980 --> 1:37:18.980]  he looks like one of those horror movies where the mortuaries do medical experiments and that's the guy that like captures you and grabs the teenagers and takes them to the lair
[1:37:18.980 --> 1:37:20.980]  they're like where does Hollywood cast these people?
[1:37:20.980 --> 1:37:22.980]  because they've seen the real deal
[1:37:22.980 --> 1:37:27.980]  I used to think Italian gangster movies were overdone with Italian gangsters act
[1:37:27.980 --> 1:37:32.980]  and then I ran into like John Gotti's one of his grandsons
[1:37:32.980 --> 1:37:36.980]  and some of those guys in New York they came to my event and they're like this is our club you know
[1:37:36.980 --> 1:37:40.980]  people said you couldn't do this show, we liked it, we're going to go to the club
[1:37:40.980 --> 1:37:42.980]  and the guy was like Pat Mills you're going to love you
[1:37:42.980 --> 1:37:45.980]  it was like when Robert De Niro goes oh this is like so much
[1:37:45.980 --> 1:37:48.980]  it was like well those were nice guys though compared to these guys
[1:37:48.980 --> 1:37:50.980]  my point was they were actually acting like the caricature
[1:37:50.980 --> 1:37:52.980]  so you see these movies with people that kidnap kids and stuff
[1:37:52.980 --> 1:37:55.980]  and then the ones that actually are involved in all this craziness
[1:37:55.980 --> 1:37:58.980]  they look just like what you think they look like
[1:37:58.980 --> 1:38:04.980]  so see Hollywood's just showing you what's really going on ladies and gentlemen
[1:38:04.980 --> 1:38:05.980]  it's crazy
[1:38:05.980 --> 1:38:10.980]  so there's the real threat folks not John Gotti the third or whatever
[1:38:10.980 --> 1:38:13.980]  so he's not trying to chop your son's balls off
[1:38:13.980 --> 1:38:19.980]  I'm sorry it's just that's the place that we've gotten to in this country is evil
[1:38:19.980 --> 1:38:25.980]  out in the open roaring at you bragging about what it's doing
[1:38:25.980 --> 1:38:28.980]  and we're about to get to even more hardcore stuff
[1:38:28.980 --> 1:38:30.980]  that gentleman there with the cat lady glasses
[1:38:30.980 --> 1:38:33.980]  wait till you see the background on this
[1:38:33.980 --> 1:38:36.980]  this is sick, sick, sick
[1:38:36.980 --> 1:38:43.980]  but don't worry Antifa vows to defend drag queen storytime at Texas library
[1:38:43.980 --> 1:38:50.980]  the time of the fascist event opposing storytime is 1pm
[1:38:50.980 --> 1:38:53.980]  we need to be there at 12.30
[1:38:53.980 --> 1:38:56.980]  so we have enough bodies to take the space
[1:38:56.980 --> 1:39:00.980]  storytime is from 3 to 3.45pm
[1:39:00.980 --> 1:39:04.980]  the ATX resistance action stated
[1:39:04.980 --> 1:39:10.980]  so you'll have a dozen methods or so show up in their black uniforms and mask
[1:39:10.980 --> 1:39:15.980]  which is even better because unsuspecting kids that didn't know their moms will just leave
[1:39:15.980 --> 1:39:24.980]  they'll only have a few ghouls or what's the term they use, familiars
[1:39:24.980 --> 1:39:28.980]  there are going to be wrenfields there that will be bringing their children
[1:39:28.980 --> 1:39:34.980]  and of course you'll always see the child autistic, drugged out, probably being sold for rape meat
[1:39:34.980 --> 1:39:37.980]  I'm not testing what they call it, they call it rape meat
[1:39:37.980 --> 1:39:43.980]  and so because Antifa will be there though normal folks that didn't know what was happening
[1:39:43.980 --> 1:39:46.980]  they'll leave and then you'll just have people bringing rape meat
[1:39:46.980 --> 1:39:48.980]  and I don't mean to be so gross about this
[1:39:48.980 --> 1:39:50.980]  you didn't know the terms for your children
[1:39:50.980 --> 1:39:52.980]  a child they've had for a while is called rape meat
[1:39:52.980 --> 1:39:54.980]  now let's continue
[1:39:54.980 --> 1:39:57.980]  there's faiths worse though than being rape meat
[1:39:57.980 --> 1:40:00.980]  because again the left hand before you're born or even after you're born
[1:40:00.980 --> 1:40:02.980]  and harvest your organs for Satan
[1:40:02.980 --> 1:40:04.980]  because of the satanic power they get from it, they believe
[1:40:04.980 --> 1:40:06.980]  the exercise of evil
[1:40:06.980 --> 1:40:08.980]  they do this, there is a huge phenomenon
[1:40:08.980 --> 1:40:12.980]  I had them just search engineering it and the crew was blown away by people cutting their sons genitals off
[1:40:12.980 --> 1:40:15.980]  because this satanic culture is about hurting the family
[1:40:15.980 --> 1:40:17.980]  and hurting the human community
[1:40:17.980 --> 1:40:20.980]  and so if you can't get yourself on Ritalin and Prozac
[1:40:20.980 --> 1:40:23.980]  or give them a bunch of shots so he's autistic
[1:40:23.980 --> 1:40:25.980]  because it gives you a thrill when you do it
[1:40:25.980 --> 1:40:32.980]  the next thing you do is that you cut his genitals off yourself with scissors
[1:40:32.980 --> 1:40:34.980]  and carve a makeshift vagina
[1:40:34.980 --> 1:40:36.980]  that's a quote from the police report
[1:40:36.980 --> 1:40:41.980]  now the father was worried but the mother was allowed to run off with her girlfriend
[1:40:41.980 --> 1:40:44.980]  when they cut his genitals off when he was younger
[1:40:44.980 --> 1:40:47.980]  he complained and tried to leave and beg for daddy
[1:40:47.980 --> 1:40:49.980]  so they stabbed him to death
[1:40:49.980 --> 1:40:51.980]  which means he's trans dead now
[1:40:51.980 --> 1:40:54.980]  which may be a new thing where leftists go nice
[1:40:54.980 --> 1:40:56.980]  actually they want to euthanize kids, they admit that
[1:40:56.980 --> 1:40:59.980]  they want people to be able to commit suicide who aren't even sick
[1:40:59.980 --> 1:41:01.980]  so I guess the leftist thing will probably be
[1:41:01.980 --> 1:41:02.980]  they're probably already doing it
[1:41:02.980 --> 1:41:05.980]  torture their kid enough where they ask to be guillotined
[1:41:05.980 --> 1:41:07.980]  and then you go to say the town square antifa's there
[1:41:07.980 --> 1:41:09.980]  and little kids are having their heads guillotined
[1:41:09.980 --> 1:41:11.980]  because that's what this is
[1:41:11.980 --> 1:41:14.980]  so he begged for daddy and so they plunged a dagger into his heart
[1:41:14.980 --> 1:41:17.980]  dozens of times with pleasure and rolled around his blood
[1:41:17.980 --> 1:41:20.980]  I'm not kidding, you can go read the Brazilian police reports if you'd like to
[1:41:20.980 --> 1:41:23.980]  there's longer articles, news wars spared all that
[1:41:23.980 --> 1:41:25.980]  the natural news article got more into it
[1:41:25.980 --> 1:41:27.980]  I kind of went down the rabbit hole and read the full thing
[1:41:27.980 --> 1:41:31.980]  they were satanic delights
[1:41:31.980 --> 1:41:33.980]  I tell you about how they tortured children over long periods
[1:41:33.980 --> 1:41:35.980]  well there's something about mommy doing it
[1:41:35.980 --> 1:41:37.980]  that satan really likes
[1:41:37.980 --> 1:41:40.980]  that's kind of like the super mario brother invincibility aura
[1:41:40.980 --> 1:41:42.980]  or when you go supernova
[1:41:42.980 --> 1:41:45.980]  oh when mommy cuts your penis off
[1:41:45.980 --> 1:41:47.980]  when mommy stabs you to death
[1:41:47.980 --> 1:41:50.980]  that's sweet sweet to satan's ears
[1:41:50.980 --> 1:41:53.980]  that's a special little bugaboo for those
[1:41:53.980 --> 1:41:55.980]  but remember it's all liberal
[1:41:55.980 --> 1:41:59.980]  Brazilian lesbian couple
[1:41:59.980 --> 1:42:02.980]  who tried to force transgender surgery on a nine year old boy
[1:42:02.980 --> 1:42:06.980]  stab him to death because he didn't like having his penis cut off
[1:42:06.980 --> 1:42:09.980]  and you can go read the whole article about it
[1:42:09.980 --> 1:42:12.980]  lesbian stab innocent nine year old son to death
[1:42:12.980 --> 1:42:14.980]  after trying to make him transgender
[1:42:14.980 --> 1:42:16.980]  turns out they'd done multiple surgeries
[1:42:16.980 --> 1:42:19.980]  they kept trying to carve it and stabbing him
[1:42:19.980 --> 1:42:21.980]  it wasn't to cut his genitals off
[1:42:21.980 --> 1:42:23.980]  they wanted to give him a vagina they said
[1:42:23.980 --> 1:42:25.980]  I'm sorry for TV viewers
[1:42:25.980 --> 1:42:28.980]  this is what the children are being taught this
[1:42:28.980 --> 1:42:32.980]  and so he finally fought back and they murdered him
[1:42:32.980 --> 1:42:34.980]  and that was he's in God's hands now folks
[1:42:34.980 --> 1:42:36.980]  let's be serious and pray for his soul
[1:42:36.980 --> 1:42:38.980]  I have no doubt he is with Christ right now
[1:42:38.980 --> 1:42:40.980]  and I have no doubt where these women are going
[1:42:40.980 --> 1:42:42.980]  straight to effing hell and you know there is one
[1:42:42.980 --> 1:42:44.980]  so keep laughing daemons
[1:42:44.980 --> 1:42:46.980]  keep laughing because you didn't get his spirit
[1:42:46.980 --> 1:42:48.980]  you may have tortured the living hell out of him
[1:42:48.980 --> 1:42:50.980]  but you didn't get his spirit
[1:42:50.980 --> 1:42:52.980]  you child molesters
[1:42:52.980 --> 1:43:05.980]  you will go to hell
[1:43:22.980 --> 1:43:24.980]  5 different types of caffeine
[1:43:24.980 --> 1:43:26.980]  doesn't have a crush
[1:43:26.980 --> 1:43:28.980]  that's turbo force
[1:43:28.980 --> 1:43:30.980]  can't derive
[1:43:30.980 --> 1:43:32.980]  5 hundred milligrams
[1:43:32.980 --> 1:43:34.980]  low bar B
[1:43:34.980 --> 1:43:36.980]  very bad
[1:43:36.980 --> 1:43:38.980]  I want a low bar
[1:43:38.980 --> 1:43:40.980]  can't derive
[1:43:40.980 --> 1:43:42.980]  5 hundred milligrams
[1:43:42.980 --> 1:43:44.980]  low bar B
[1:43:44.980 --> 1:43:46.980]  very bad
[1:43:46.980 --> 1:43:48.980]  that's turbo force
[1:43:48.980 --> 1:43:50.980]  I tell ya what I'm doing
[1:43:50.980 --> 1:43:52.980]  we will go F level level
[1:43:52.980 --> 1:43:54.980]  it can't go through
[1:43:54.980 --> 1:43:56.980]  and get official
[1:43:56.980 --> 1:43:58.980]  info wars
[1:43:58.980 --> 1:44:00.980]  the most banned network in the world
[1:44:00.980 --> 1:44:02.980]  so the info wars model is a
[1:44:02.980 --> 1:44:04.980]  self fulfilling self supporting
[1:44:04.980 --> 1:44:06.980]  structure that is promoting free press
[1:44:06.980 --> 1:44:08.980]  and free speech by people getting together
[1:44:08.980 --> 1:44:10.980]  and supporting one another and sustaining one another
[1:44:10.980 --> 1:44:12.980]  it is the only independent press
[1:44:12.980 --> 1:44:14.980]  of this size and scale
[1:44:14.980 --> 1:44:16.980]  of this public reach
[1:44:16.980 --> 1:44:18.980]  it is the one model that says
[1:44:18.980 --> 1:44:20.980]  there is no way to have a self supporting
[1:44:20.980 --> 1:44:22.980]  self sustaining
[1:44:22.980 --> 1:44:24.980]  self structured little d democratic structure
[1:44:24.980 --> 1:44:26.980]  that because the audience determines
[1:44:26.980 --> 1:44:28.980]  what content goes up
[1:44:28.980 --> 1:44:30.980]  the audience determines what audience
[1:44:30.980 --> 1:44:32.980]  is ultimately reached by their choices
[1:44:32.980 --> 1:44:34.980]  and supporting info wars
[1:44:34.980 --> 1:44:36.980]  and it's all because the audience spends
[1:44:36.980 --> 1:44:38.980]  there whatever it is whether it's $5 or $50
[1:44:38.980 --> 1:44:40.980]  a month on products that they like
[1:44:40.980 --> 1:44:42.980]  and that they want that actually compete
[1:44:42.980 --> 1:44:44.980]  with the corporate driven model
[1:44:44.980 --> 1:44:46.980]  and the ability to do that and at the same time
[1:44:46.980 --> 1:44:48.980]  the news they want to see and what views
[1:44:48.980 --> 1:44:50.980]  they want to hold and it's the ultimate
[1:44:50.980 --> 1:44:52.980]  American democratic expression and experiment
[1:44:52.980 --> 1:44:54.980]  and it is the celebration of free press
[1:44:54.980 --> 1:45:16.980]  and free speech with free markets
[1:45:24.980 --> 1:45:26.980]  we did more research and secured
[1:45:26.980 --> 1:45:28.980]  more of the deep earth crystals
[1:45:28.980 --> 1:45:30.980]  of nascent ionite
[1:45:30.980 --> 1:45:32.980]  chemist and others
[1:45:36.980 --> 1:45:38.980]  showed us the research by combining
[1:45:38.980 --> 1:45:40.980]  it with three other compounds
[1:45:40.980 --> 1:45:42.980]  two forms of iodine
[1:45:42.980 --> 1:45:44.980]  and vitamin c
[1:45:44.980 --> 1:45:46.980]  super charges it
[1:45:46.980 --> 1:45:48.980]  and makes it even more
[1:45:48.980 --> 1:45:50.980]  bio available
[1:45:50.980 --> 1:45:52.980]  ladies and gentlemen you want to research
[1:45:52.980 --> 1:45:58.520]  It's an incredible discovery, X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[1:45:58.520 --> 1:46:03.420]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[1:47:02.020 --> 1:47:31.860]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:31.860 --> 1:47:39.120]  Hollywood and the Tabistock Institute in the 1960s, developed a plan to create promiscuity
[1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:43.200]  to break up the family, but then they said we're not gonna just promote homosexuality.
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:45.840]  We're going to...and again, that's not to bash people that are homosexual.
[1:47:45.840 --> 1:47:48.380]  I'm saying they're using you, okay?
[1:47:48.380 --> 1:47:54.320]  To then say, oh then everything goes, beachality, sex with children, and by increments, they've
[1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:57.880]  gotten the LGBT community to become the LGBTP.
[1:47:57.880 --> 1:48:03.120]  P. In fact, they're even adopting it, saying pedophilia is good.
[1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:08.680]  And so we would show you three years ago, drag queen festivals in Austin held in public,
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:13.960]  opened the public, outdoor areas, hotels, schools, where small children put money in
[1:48:13.960 --> 1:48:15.960]  G-strings of men.
[1:48:15.960 --> 1:48:21.400]  Now it's children going to nighttime clubs where alcohol served and men shove money in
[1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:24.960]  their G-string while little boys shake their butts in their faces.
[1:48:24.960 --> 1:48:28.000]  But because it's, quote, gay, it's okay.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:31.240]  If you walked into a topless bar, and I was in plenty of them in college, I went to a
[1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:33.520]  few bachelor things when buddies got married.
[1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:35.720]  I'm not a topless bar guy.
[1:48:35.720 --> 1:48:42.040]  The point is, is that if you walked into one of those, you saw a six-year-old, seven-year-old,
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:44.280]  10-year-old girl on stage.
[1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:50.960]  You go call the police, and if you saw men sticking money in 10-year-old girls' G-strings,
[1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:51.960]  you'd kick their ass.
[1:48:51.960 --> 1:48:54.360]  I mean, seriously, I would start beating them.
[1:48:54.360 --> 1:48:58.120]  I'd say, hey, shut this down, and a bouncer'd walk over and put his hands on me, and I'd
[1:48:58.120 --> 1:48:59.120]  break his nose.
[1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:00.120]  Guaranteed!
[1:49:00.120 --> 1:49:02.720]  And I'd stop bragging, you'd do that, too.
[1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:05.360]  What the hell is a little girl doing up their own stage?
[1:49:05.360 --> 1:49:09.320]  Well, her tits aren't out, excuse my French, so it's supposedly okay.
[1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:10.520]  No, it's not.
[1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:11.520]  It's sick.
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:19.160]  And it's mainlining people into a very dark, evil world of freaks.
[1:49:19.160 --> 1:49:21.760]  And it's exploitive, and it's pure evil.
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:25.720]  And so all over the country, all over the world, men are cutting off their own genitals, even
[1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:28.160]  though it would be paid for by the government.
[1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:29.720]  Women are cutting their son's genitals off.
[1:49:29.720 --> 1:49:34.480]  It's a sick form of moonshowsen beyond proxy, I would call it.
[1:49:34.480 --> 1:49:42.960]  And it's being sold by Hollywood and Silicon Valley, where it is a giant cult.
[1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:46.120]  You get to these women in Brazil, I'm not kidding.
[1:49:46.120 --> 1:49:51.400]  They ran off a little boy for years from his father and tortured him.
[1:49:51.400 --> 1:49:57.640]  And I'm not going to read the translated police reports, but they didn't just chop his genitals
[1:49:57.640 --> 1:49:58.640]  off.
[1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:03.480]  They were like, you are going to be a girl now, they kept stabbing him on a weekly basis
[1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:05.120]  because they were torturing him.
[1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:06.920]  You know, that's totally mentally ill.
[1:50:06.920 --> 1:50:10.440]  It's mentally ill to go to the doctor and have your genitals cut off.
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:14.080]  You're not a woman.
[1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:17.960]  You are not a biological woman, but I am a libertarian.
[1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:25.640]  If a full grown man wants to go say he's a woman and have his genitals cut off, that
[1:50:25.640 --> 1:50:26.640]  is his business.
[1:50:26.640 --> 1:50:28.600]  I'm not paying for it.
[1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:32.720]  I think you're mentally ill.
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:37.480]  Now people want to put bleach in their eyes.
[1:50:37.480 --> 1:50:42.000]  Governments pay for it, and then we pay for it in tax money because they feel trans-abled.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:46.360]  This is total mental illness, and I know you know that, but you need to know it's been
[1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:49.480]  focused and it's been deployed on purpose.
[1:50:49.480 --> 1:50:56.000]  Now, more than a decade ago, South Park did a whole comedy piece on this, and back then
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:51:00.600]  everybody bought it was crazy, and they showed real footage, 35 millimeter film, of a sex
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:01.600]  change operation.
[1:51:01.600 --> 1:51:05.680]  So viewer discretion is advised, you ask how they air this on national television, because
[1:51:05.680 --> 1:51:09.360]  it's surgery, and these things have aired on PBS as well.
[1:51:09.360 --> 1:51:12.000]  You ever watch PBS with like heart surgery and stuff?
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:16.320]  I find that even scarier than this, but I'm going to show everybody what they put out
[1:51:16.320 --> 1:51:24.200]  on Comedy Central, interspersed with the cartoon like it's a joke, saying, this is horrible,
[1:51:24.200 --> 1:51:25.200]  you shouldn't do it.
[1:51:25.200 --> 1:51:27.200]  It was something good that the brothers did.
[1:51:27.200 --> 1:51:28.200]  I'm a fan of a lot of their work.
[1:51:28.200 --> 1:51:35.000]  I think it really exposes the hypocrisy of the left, and it's horrific, and it's horrible.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:38.840]  But you have to understand, this is what children are being targeted with, and in Europe especially,
[1:51:38.840 --> 1:51:43.200]  Sweden and England, children as young as seven are having sex changes.
[1:51:43.200 --> 1:51:49.720]  They're having their testicles flayed, flayed.
[1:51:49.720 --> 1:51:53.680]  This is mental illness, and the rate of suicide is off the charts.
[1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:56.960]  The rate of mental illness, because it's already mentally ill.
[1:51:56.960 --> 1:51:59.880]  You know, Vincent Van Gogh cut his ear off.
[1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:01.760]  He was mentally ill.
[1:52:01.760 --> 1:52:04.560]  He was poisoned by mercury.
[1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:05.560]  It's not good.
[1:52:05.560 --> 1:52:07.320]  And then he committed suicide.
[1:52:07.320 --> 1:52:09.800]  Someone should have saved Vincent Van Gogh.
[1:52:09.800 --> 1:52:12.400]  He cut his ear off.
[1:52:12.400 --> 1:52:13.920]  He was start raving mad.
[1:52:13.920 --> 1:52:20.400]  And if you cut your ear off, or your fingers off, or your testicles off, you're crazy unless
[1:52:20.400 --> 1:52:22.760]  you've got cancer in your testicles.
[1:52:22.760 --> 1:52:24.280]  And then you've got to do it.
[1:52:24.280 --> 1:52:28.200]  And I have to sit here in 2019 and explain that this is wrong.
[1:52:28.200 --> 1:52:31.320]  I know our audience gets it, but it's part of a diabolical plan.
[1:52:31.320 --> 1:52:34.880]  And then I'm getting to the big story I haven't hit yet, other than Robert Barnes is joining
[1:52:34.880 --> 1:52:39.600]  us, because I'm going to show you the apex of this operation.
[1:52:39.600 --> 1:52:41.040]  I'm going to show you who runs it.
[1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:47.080]  I'm going to show you who's up at the top of it that comes out in daylight and who calls
[1:52:47.080 --> 1:52:50.760]  for me to be taken off the internet.
[1:52:50.760 --> 1:52:59.880]  Child actors who played young children past their age, who then head up censorship operations
[1:52:59.880 --> 1:53:09.040]  as a liaison to Google, who also has interesting things on their Twitter about muppets and
[1:53:09.040 --> 1:53:12.960]  children, and who goes out to the events with little children and tells you how great it
[1:53:12.960 --> 1:53:13.960]  all is.
[1:53:13.960 --> 1:53:14.960]  It's fine.
[1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:20.960]  Wait till you meet this person coming up who has this great, funny act.
[1:53:20.960 --> 1:53:21.960]  Everybody's so nice.
[1:53:21.960 --> 1:53:22.960]  Everybody's so good.
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:24.960]  There's nothing creepy about any of this.
[1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:27.400]  We need your children to come to our event.
[1:53:27.400 --> 1:53:29.000]  Are you bringing them?
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:35.480]  We got contacted by Silicon Valley, by Google and by Twitter, and they said in Facebook,
[1:53:35.480 --> 1:53:40.520]  they said, you can do anything you want, just don't talk bad about our agenda.
[1:53:40.520 --> 1:53:41.880]  And I said, what's that?
[1:53:41.880 --> 1:53:49.160]  Bringing Muslims in and teaching children about sex changes.
[1:53:49.160 --> 1:53:50.640]  That's all.
[1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:54.480]  It's the one or it's the two things we want you to do.
[1:53:54.480 --> 1:54:01.440]  And she says this, he says this, this cat lady glasses person says all this in the video
[1:54:01.440 --> 1:54:08.400]  we're going to play with Sundar Patsai, and you're going to read, oh, hi kids, I'm a mommy.
[1:54:08.400 --> 1:54:09.400]  Come close.
[1:54:09.400 --> 1:54:11.320]  I'm a mommy.
[1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:14.160]  Mommies take care of little kids.
[1:54:14.160 --> 1:54:16.760]  You can trust a mommy.
[1:54:16.760 --> 1:54:22.480]  Little kids are scared of men, but not when they're dressed like women as much.
[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:25.520]  Sundar seems a little uncomfortable, but it's okay.
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:29.320]  Sundar signed on for, what is he, worth like 50 billion or whatever?
[1:54:29.320 --> 1:54:32.200]  You know, he signed on, it's kind of making him upset.
[1:54:32.200 --> 1:54:36.240]  He's got children and a wife, but it's okay, Sundar.
[1:54:36.240 --> 1:54:38.520]  It's okay, Sundar.
[1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:44.560]  So let's go to South Park and the real footage of a man having his genitals flayed.
[1:54:44.560 --> 1:54:48.360]  Here it is.
[1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:49.560]  Hello, Mr. Garrison.
[1:54:49.560 --> 1:54:50.840]  I'm Dr. Biber.
[1:54:50.840 --> 1:54:53.400]  I'll be performing your surgery today.
[1:54:53.400 --> 1:54:55.080]  God bless you, doctor.
[1:54:55.080 --> 1:54:57.120]  I know you'll make me well again.
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:02.000]  Now, you're absolutely sure you want to have a vagina plastic.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  My whole life, I've been a woman trapped in a man's body.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:07.880]  A sex change operation is my last chance at happiness.
[1:55:07.880 --> 1:55:11.000]  All right, then let's begin.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  Just relax, Mr. Garrison.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:16.840]  I think if more people could just see a sex change operation, they would know how perfectly
[1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:18.960]  natural it is.
[1:55:18.960 --> 1:55:23.160]  The first thing I'm going to do is slice your balls.
[1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:31.240]  Oh, with the scrotum open, I can now discard of your testicles.
[1:55:31.240 --> 1:55:33.680]  So long balls.
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:39.240]  Now, I'll just continue the incision up the shaft of the penis.
[1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:40.760]  Oh, that stings.
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:41.760]  This is the religion.
[1:55:41.760 --> 1:55:45.640]  Now, I'll just turn your cutting penis inside out.
[1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:48.120]  Oh, oh, Jave.
[1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:54.240]  All we need to do now is stuff the unskinned penis inside your pelvis.
[1:55:54.240 --> 1:55:59.720]  And now I'll use the skin from your penis to make the vaginal lips.
[1:55:59.720 --> 1:56:03.320]  Do I look like a woman?
[1:56:03.320 --> 1:56:07.160]  Pretty much.
[1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:10.600]  By the way, that's censored from what I've seen back when it happened.
[1:56:10.600 --> 1:56:12.840]  They showed the whole thing on national television.
[1:56:12.840 --> 1:56:14.520]  It was way more horrible.
[1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:15.520]  So that's an edited version.
[1:56:15.520 --> 1:56:18.440]  I want to find, I know we've got other medical ones.
[1:56:18.440 --> 1:56:22.760]  I just wanted to show that one, because TV stations, the left will call and say, he's
[1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:24.600]  showing bad things.
[1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:28.040]  And the states can say, no, we just showed what aired on national television and national
[1:56:28.040 --> 1:56:29.040]  cable.
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:34.480]  There's a reason I didn't show a sex change off PBS, because you left us with lie and
[1:56:34.480 --> 1:56:35.480]  trick people.
[1:56:35.480 --> 1:56:41.920]  Because you want to commit the crime of chopping little boys' balls off.
[1:56:41.920 --> 1:56:43.480]  You don't want me to show the crime.
[1:56:43.480 --> 1:56:47.400]  So you'll call up and say, I've committed the crime of showing it.
[1:56:47.400 --> 1:56:48.400]  No filth.
[1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:50.160]  It's just like in a murder trial.
[1:56:50.160 --> 1:56:52.960]  I'm showing what you do to masculinity.
[1:56:52.960 --> 1:56:53.960]  You hate it.
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:56:54.960]  You call it toxic.
[1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:58.520]  You want to destroy it, because you want no one to oppose your takeover.
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:00.960]  Sundar, all those billions aren't worth it.
[1:57:00.960 --> 1:57:03.440]  You know the left's going to get your children, Sundar.
[1:57:03.440 --> 1:57:07.280]  Are your children worth it, Sundar?
[1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:10.640]  I think Sundar is completely, I've watched this interview like eight times, he's freaked
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:17.640]  out because this person is a demon goblin, he's talking to, he's got a woman.
[1:57:17.640 --> 1:57:23.760]  It's a Hollywood thing, but it wants you to think it's a woman, because, hey, puppies
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:30.920]  and candy, they don't settle kids down, but mommy does.
[1:57:30.920 --> 1:57:35.480]  Mommy wants to help little boys and girls, and mommy's going to help.
[1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:38.080]  Mommy learned a lot in Hollywood.
[1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:39.080]  Mommy learned a lot.
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:46.080]  We'll be right back in FullWars.com, we'll never surrender.

[1:58:48.160 --> 1:58:53.400]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[1:58:53.400 --> 1:58:58.560]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[1:58:58.560 --> 1:59:05.440]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[1:59:05.440 --> 1:59:11.280]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[1:59:11.280 --> 1:59:14.200]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[1:59:14.200 --> 1:59:19.560]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[1:59:19.560 --> 1:59:25.960]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[1:59:25.960 --> 1:59:31.120]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine, in fact, current research
[1:59:31.120 --> 1:59:35.960]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme
[1:59:35.960 --> 1:59:40.040]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:59:40.040 --> 1:59:42.760]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[1:59:42.760 --> 1:59:51.480]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:59:51.480 --> 1:59:58.480]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:21.480 --> 2:00:27.680]  Okay, I don't get into this to make fun of this person because they've made themselves
[2:00:27.680 --> 2:00:32.840]  the victims but they're not the victims, they're the Hollywood ruling elite.
[2:00:32.840 --> 2:00:37.220]  And the transgenderism is an attack on the family, it's meant to sexualize children and
[2:00:37.220 --> 2:00:44.200]  screw them up and it makes no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, that this comes directly out
[2:00:44.200 --> 2:00:45.200]  of Hollywood.
[2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:55.080]  Watch what came up, please, inner, inner thread, is that how you pronounce it?
[2:00:55.080 --> 2:00:56.080]  Inner freed.
[2:00:56.080 --> 2:01:01.880]  Now, when I read this person's bio the other day, the crew thought I was joking.
[2:01:01.880 --> 2:01:08.640]  Early life played the son of Rocky in Rocky III and played children up until the time
[2:01:08.640 --> 2:01:17.440]  he was 25 or so in Hollywood playing a child.
[2:01:17.440 --> 2:01:21.560]  I bet all the tea in China that we've got a victim here.
[2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:28.200]  But a lot of victims turn into Renfields, familiars, and again, I've explained how this
[2:01:28.200 --> 2:01:29.200]  works.
[2:01:29.200 --> 2:01:36.040]  So, this individual is a key liaison helping run censorship with Google and others, they
[2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:44.040]  always use outside media, chief technology, correspondent for Axios, senior editor, recode,
[2:01:44.040 --> 2:01:49.600]  senior editor, all things digital, senior writer, CNET, goes on, formerly a man.
[2:01:49.600 --> 2:01:56.040]  You cannot find the name of what he was, he is still biologically a man, he even talks
[2:01:56.040 --> 2:01:57.040]  like one.
[2:01:57.040 --> 2:02:03.600]  But I wanted to play this bizarre Sundar piece and then I wanted to read every comment is
[2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:06.300]  negative about it on YouTube.
[2:02:06.300 --> 2:02:08.320]  Every comment says, is this the twilight zone?
[2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:12.760]  And again, the person is trying to be shocking, trying to be the center of attention.
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:19.080]  And talking about Islamaphobes, you would be dead in two minutes in Somalia.
[2:02:19.080 --> 2:02:21.960]  You'd last 20 minutes in Saudi Arabia.
[2:02:21.960 --> 2:02:25.560]  You would last five minutes in northern Sudan.
[2:02:25.560 --> 2:02:28.880]  You would last 10 minutes in Libya.
[2:02:28.880 --> 2:02:35.640]  You would not last an hour in Baghdad.
[2:02:35.640 --> 2:02:40.200]  So I just, it's this thing of like gushing over it, and then of course there's all these
[2:02:40.200 --> 2:02:44.520]  Muppets, I don't see Elmo on there, Elmo creator got busted or the guy that does the
[2:02:44.520 --> 2:02:46.880]  voice of Elmo actually got busted as a pedophile, but no big deal.
[2:02:46.880 --> 2:02:52.120]  Oh, lots of little Muppets and a pretty mommy, that's how he sees himself as a nice mommy.
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:57.200]  Well, let's play mommy, because you're not just a child actor star now that played a
[2:02:57.200 --> 2:03:01.600]  child after you weren't a child and all those child stars that hung out at Michael Jackson's
[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:02.600]  house.
[2:03:02.600 --> 2:03:03.600]  I wonder if you ever did.
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:04.600]  We're investigating.
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:05.600]  I bet you did.
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:06.600]  But it's not just that.
[2:03:06.600 --> 2:03:10.920]  No, no, it's more, isn't it?
[2:03:10.920 --> 2:03:11.920]  Let's roll the tape.
[2:03:11.920 --> 2:03:16.100]  Maybe a good place to start is YouTube and obviously it comes up a lot.
[2:03:16.100 --> 2:03:20.480]  What goes through your mind when you watch a video like the recent one you had this teenager
[2:03:20.480 --> 2:03:26.680]  would appear to be donning Muslim garbs spewing a lot of anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, homophobic,
[2:03:26.680 --> 2:03:27.680]  hate?
[2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:31.960]  What goes through your mind when you see a video like that and see that it's gotten 350,000
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:32.960]  views?
[2:03:32.960 --> 2:03:37.800]  I don't know all the details of this specific video, but in general, look, I mean, all of
[2:03:37.800 --> 2:03:42.400]  us, none of us want harmful content on our platforms.
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:46.440]  I think last quarter alone, we removed 9 million videos from the platform.
[2:03:46.440 --> 2:03:50.520]  More recently, we have introduced, just like today, we do this in search.
[2:03:50.520 --> 2:03:56.000]  We had ranked content based on quality, and so we're bringing that same notion and approach
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:04:03.440]  to YouTube so that we can rank higher quality stuff better and really prevent borderline
[2:04:03.440 --> 2:04:04.440]  content.
[2:04:04.440 --> 2:04:05.440]  Oh, hit pause.
[2:04:05.440 --> 2:04:07.080]  We're going to come back and play the rest of this.
[2:04:07.080 --> 2:04:14.320]  You'll know what the borderline contents me, but oh, this person with Sundar uplying to
[2:04:14.320 --> 2:04:17.200]  us on HBO, that's quality.
[2:04:17.200 --> 2:04:19.160]  No one wants to watch it.
[2:04:19.160 --> 2:04:21.200]  It got 50 to one downvotes.
[2:04:21.200 --> 2:04:23.280]  Every comment hates you.
[2:04:23.280 --> 2:04:26.520]  This is quality content for you.
[2:04:26.520 --> 2:04:29.360]  You will like the quality content now.
[2:04:29.360 --> 2:04:30.360]  It is good.
[2:04:30.360 --> 2:04:31.360]  It's a joke.
[2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:35.400]  You're like, it's politically incorrect to an Indian accent.
[2:04:35.400 --> 2:04:39.760]  I love Indians that are patriots, but I make fun of everybody and I'm going to do it because
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:42.240]  we're not going to follow your political rules anymore.
[2:04:42.240 --> 2:04:43.240]  You got it?
[2:04:43.240 --> 2:04:48.320]  I'll talk like Yosemite Sam, but I'll talk like this like Sundar if I want to, or I'll
[2:04:48.320 --> 2:04:57.280]  talk like...
[2:04:57.280 --> 2:05:04.640]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[2:05:04.640 --> 2:05:18.280]  This is a digital AI enforced gag order, not to say the name Alex Jones, or m4wars.com.
[2:05:18.280 --> 2:05:20.000]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:21.200]  This is racketeering.
[2:05:21.200 --> 2:05:22.200]  This is cartels.
[2:05:22.200 --> 2:05:24.720]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[2:05:24.720 --> 2:05:26.600]  We need it now.
[2:05:26.600 --> 2:05:28.280]  You can take on Big Tech.
[2:05:28.280 --> 2:05:34.760]  They saw m4wars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:40.920]  populist organization, so they thought first they come for Alex Jones, then when people
[2:05:40.920 --> 2:05:45.240]  say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[2:05:45.240 --> 2:05:50.160]  The way to fight back is to support m4wars now more than ever, and make it a standard
[2:05:50.160 --> 2:05:52.000]  of freedom and free speech.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:56.600]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[2:05:56.600 --> 2:05:59.320]  You got it.
[2:05:59.320 --> 2:06:04.920]  That free speech is coming to you.
[2:06:04.920 --> 2:06:09.240]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:06:09.240 --> 2:06:16.240]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[2:06:16.240 --> 2:06:19.240]  How we see the earth?
[2:06:19.240 --> 2:06:21.240]  You got it.
[2:06:21.240 --> 2:06:25.240]  How we see the earth now?
[2:06:25.240 --> 2:06:27.240]  You got it.
[2:06:27.240 --> 2:06:29.240]  How we see the earth now?
[2:06:29.240 --> 2:06:31.240]  Meet Ian Freed.
[2:06:31.240 --> 2:06:33.240]  You got it.
[2:06:33.240 --> 2:06:38.240]  Now, Ina Freed, former child star.
[2:06:38.240 --> 2:06:45.240]  Bounce around Hollywood, playing the part of a child many years after he wasn't a child.
[2:06:45.240 --> 2:06:48.240]  The movie's like Rocky III.
[2:06:48.240 --> 2:06:54.240]  Yes, you can't make that up, and now he goes around calling for everybody to be censored
[2:06:54.240 --> 2:06:55.240]  off the Internet.
[2:06:55.240 --> 2:06:56.240]  He doesn't agree with.
[2:06:56.240 --> 2:06:59.240]  And so this is doing some study on this guy.
[2:06:59.240 --> 2:07:06.240]  You go to San Francisco, the whole ruling class at Google in these facilities dress like
[2:07:06.240 --> 2:07:08.240]  women and clowns now.
[2:07:08.240 --> 2:07:12.240]  So this is kind of his good behavior outfit, and that's why you have lawsuits that are
[2:07:12.240 --> 2:07:15.240]  going forward for that poor little boy.
[2:07:15.240 --> 2:07:17.240]  Imagine the hell he went through in Hollywood.
[2:07:17.240 --> 2:07:22.240]  And that system, wow, we got to pray for his soul.
[2:07:22.240 --> 2:07:26.240]  There's probably nothing left there now, whatever is running.
[2:07:26.240 --> 2:07:31.240]  It's whatever deep star system it comes from, but let's continue back to what I was getting
[2:07:31.240 --> 2:07:36.240]  at.
[2:07:36.240 --> 2:07:40.240]  He's out here now, not just a child star, and now not just a man that says he's a woman.
[2:07:40.240 --> 2:07:48.240]  He now, ladies and gentlemen, is a censor, but literally 50 to one downvotes, thousands
[2:07:48.240 --> 2:07:55.240]  of negative votes, only a few positive votes, and everyone is saying things like, I just
[2:07:55.240 --> 2:07:59.240]  threw up in my mouth as he interviews the head of Google.
[2:07:59.240 --> 2:08:03.240]  Hate speech doesn't exist, just speech that some authoritarians don't like.
[2:08:03.240 --> 2:08:05.240]  Wow, this is beyond weird.
[2:08:05.240 --> 2:08:08.240]  That fat guy dressed up as a woman, clown world.
[2:08:08.240 --> 2:08:09.240]  What the F is this?
[2:08:09.240 --> 2:08:10.240]  Is this the onion?
[2:08:10.240 --> 2:08:12.240]  Is this Brian Stelter and drag?
[2:08:12.240 --> 2:08:13.240]  Is this a parody?
[2:08:13.240 --> 2:08:15.240]  This is every comment.
[2:08:15.240 --> 2:08:17.240]  This is every comment.
[2:08:17.240 --> 2:08:19.240]  I read hundreds of these.
[2:08:19.240 --> 2:08:24.240]  Every comment, ladies and gentlemen, is extremely flipped out.
[2:08:24.240 --> 2:08:28.240]  No one can believe it.
[2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:30.240]  Zoom in on these, and look at these comments.
[2:08:30.240 --> 2:08:34.240]  This is really happening.
[2:08:34.240 --> 2:08:36.240]  Now, let's go to the next ones.
[2:08:36.240 --> 2:08:37.240]  These are really small.
[2:08:37.240 --> 2:08:40.240]  Zoom in.
[2:08:40.240 --> 2:08:41.240]  I hate YouTube.
[2:08:41.240 --> 2:08:42.240]  I hate Axios.
[2:08:42.240 --> 2:08:44.240]  Go away.
[2:08:44.240 --> 2:08:46.240]  What is this, man?
[2:08:46.240 --> 2:08:49.240]  I just feel like I'm in the twilight zone.
[2:08:49.240 --> 2:08:51.240]  You guys cannot stop free speech, period.
[2:08:51.240 --> 2:08:55.240]  The more you push this leftist agenda, the more people are getting red-pilled.
[2:08:55.240 --> 2:08:57.240]  I was one of them.
[2:08:57.240 --> 2:09:00.240]  You guys will lose this battle.
[2:09:00.240 --> 2:09:02.240]  Wait, this isn't a joke video.
[2:09:02.240 --> 2:09:03.240]  These two, it goes on.
[2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:15.240]  Lost everything, including my mother when I fled Cuba to come to the USA where I thought people were free to express themselves, where people were protected by the Constitution.
[2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:17.240]  Shame on you, Axios.
[2:09:17.240 --> 2:09:18.240]  Oh, my God.
[2:09:18.240 --> 2:09:19.240]  I wasn't expecting that.
[2:09:19.240 --> 2:09:22.240]  The video should have a trigger warning.
[2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:26.240]  I'm glad they dropped that don't be evil thing.
[2:09:26.240 --> 2:09:29.240]  Expecting Western values that goes on.
[2:09:29.240 --> 2:09:31.240]  I'm not going to read the really mean ones.
[2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:34.240]  Zoom in some more, please.
[2:09:34.240 --> 2:09:40.240]  Also, that's a man, baby.
[2:09:40.240 --> 2:09:46.240]  This was a skit on SNL, and it goes on to make fun of it there.
[2:09:46.240 --> 2:09:52.240]  This dude is Chris Farley in drag.
[2:09:52.240 --> 2:09:57.240]  Ina Freed, you don't pass, not even close.
[2:09:57.240 --> 2:10:00.240]  The attempt is hysterical.
[2:10:00.240 --> 2:10:10.240]  Sundar Pachai is an authoritarian, and anyone that isn't a devout follower of progressive dogma must be silenced for wrongthink.
[2:10:10.240 --> 2:10:21.240]  People like him, Susan, the head of YouTube, whatever her name is, and the other Silicon Valley authoritarians will be the reason for their platforms much-deserved.
[2:10:21.240 --> 2:10:23.240]  Downfall.
[2:10:23.240 --> 2:10:25.240]  Next person, Clown World.
[2:10:25.240 --> 2:10:27.240]  Google hate speech.
[2:10:27.240 --> 2:10:31.240]  The company's end will be a good thing.
[2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:32.240]  That's right.
[2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:37.240]  The only real hate speech is those that hate speech.
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:38.240]  Am I in an alternate universe?
[2:10:38.240 --> 2:10:39.240]  I can't tell.
[2:10:39.240 --> 2:10:42.240]  Trump 2020.
[2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:47.240]  What can you tell this creature is lying before the lips even move?
[2:10:47.240 --> 2:10:48.240]  It goes on and on, folks.
[2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:58.240]  I'm not going to read hundreds of these on air, but you get the good news that humanity is rejecting it.
[2:10:58.240 --> 2:11:04.240]  Humanity is saying no to it, no matter how much they push it.
[2:11:04.240 --> 2:11:15.240]  So why then is the Austin American statesman promoting small children being bused in the field trip to the Gay Pride Parade?
[2:11:15.240 --> 2:11:22.240]  Why is California saying your children will go to gay sensitivity training whether you like it or not?
[2:11:22.240 --> 2:11:26.240]  You can't opt out because it's the religion.
[2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:30.240]  And that's what these systems push.
[2:11:30.240 --> 2:11:43.240]  And there's Mr. Freed or Mrs. Freed or whatever it is, Freed, with the cat lady glasses, with the little girl at their pride parade.
[2:11:43.240 --> 2:11:45.240]  There it is.
[2:11:45.240 --> 2:11:48.240]  My visibility is revolution.
[2:11:48.240 --> 2:11:52.240]  There with all the cute little dolls for children.
[2:11:52.240 --> 2:11:54.240]  Hi, children.
[2:11:54.240 --> 2:11:55.240]  Come to me.
[2:11:55.240 --> 2:11:57.240]  I was a child star.
[2:11:57.240 --> 2:12:01.240]  I was a child star in Hollywood for decades.
[2:12:01.240 --> 2:12:06.240]  I played a child even after I wasn't one.
[2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:09.240]  Man, you look at the MO on this.
[2:12:09.240 --> 2:12:14.240]  About 50,000 red flags shoot up.
[2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:17.240]  So we're done talking about this individual.
[2:12:17.240 --> 2:12:19.240]  But here's Sundar Pachai.
[2:12:19.240 --> 2:12:34.240]  Let's start it from the beginning, who just is totally blown away as he talks and is being criticized for not doing enough censorship because we're being so mean to sweet little Muslims.
[2:12:34.240 --> 2:12:39.240]  This is a good place to start as YouTube and obviously it comes up a lot.
[2:12:39.240 --> 2:12:49.240]  What goes through your mind when you watch a video like the recent one, you had this teenager, what appeared to be donning Muslim garbs, spewing a lot of anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, homophobic hate.
[2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:55.240]  What goes through your mind when you see a video like that and see that it's gotten 350,000 views?
[2:12:55.240 --> 2:13:04.240]  I don't know all the details of this specific video, but in general, none of us want harmful content on our platforms.
[2:13:04.240 --> 2:13:08.240]  I think last quarter alone, we removed 9 million videos from the platform.
[2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:17.240]  More recently, we have introduced 50 to 1 negative votes on the video.
[2:13:17.240 --> 2:13:19.240]  Everyone hates you.
[2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:26.240]  Everyone knows you're authoritarian and so it may trick kids that you're not threatening when you dress up like a cat lady.
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:31.240]  But adults know, oh my God, that is like a horror movie character.
[2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:46.240]  I mean, I'm not saying this guy is a child molester, but I do think very high probability, living in Hollywood, being a child actor, that small, going through all that, that you were probably abused or at least the Hollywood folks tried to abuse you.
[2:13:46.240 --> 2:13:52.240]  It's rampant. It's known that the actors that go far are passed around like sex dolls.
[2:13:52.240 --> 2:14:03.240]  But when you have a bunch of children's toys around you and you're acting like a woman and everything else, the people that drive the rape vans, dress like women and have little dolls, they try to talk to kids,
[2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:05.240]  and I've got puppies, I've got ice cream.
[2:14:05.240 --> 2:14:08.240]  I mean, this is like, this is the 101.
[2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:16.240]  They've got this big FBI video out. It's got like 15 million views that was put out by Wired about how to tell what somebody is with their body language.
[2:14:16.240 --> 2:14:22.240]  They don't go out for body language. It's off the way people dress and how they act. That's the MO.
[2:14:22.240 --> 2:14:24.240]  It's called profiling.
[2:14:24.240 --> 2:14:31.240]  And anybody that profiles Silicon Valley and all these people is that it is a collection of classical predators.
[2:14:31.240 --> 2:14:34.240]  And they want your children. They want to indoctrinate them.
[2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:38.240]  They confuse their sex gender. They want to be the parents.
[2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:42.240]  They want to run your life. Let's finish up with this person.
[2:14:42.240 --> 2:14:46.240]  More recently, we have introduced, you know, just like today, we do this in search.
[2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:49.240]  We, you know, we had ranked content based on quality.
[2:14:49.240 --> 2:14:56.240]  And so we're bringing that same notion and quality to YouTube so that we can rank higher quality stuff better.
[2:14:56.240 --> 2:14:57.240]  And this is quality.
[2:14:57.240 --> 2:15:00.240]  And prevent borderline content.
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:02.240]  All the YouTube pedophile stuff's quality, huh?
[2:15:02.240 --> 2:15:05.240]  Which need to be removed, but which can still cause harm.
[2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:10.240]  And so we are working hard. It's a hard computer science problem.
[2:15:10.240 --> 2:15:15.240]  It's also a hard societal problem because we need better frameworks around what is hate speech, what's not,
[2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:19.240]  and how do we as a company make those decisions at scale and get it right without making...
[2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:20.240]  There you go.
[2:15:20.240 --> 2:15:25.240]  You've talked about the progress it's made, but I feel like every other week we're talking about something really bad,
[2:15:25.240 --> 2:15:29.240]  whether it was, you know, with the Notre Dame fires and 9-11 footage showing...
[2:15:29.240 --> 2:15:30.240]  The boss.
[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:33.240]  It feels like you've got Muslims running around saying burned out.
[2:15:33.240 --> 2:15:35.240]  Thousands of churches burned by Muslims.
[2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:36.240]  Then there's a clear cover up.
[2:15:36.240 --> 2:15:37.240]  They won't.
[2:15:37.240 --> 2:15:38.240]  And we just question and say, is it Muslims?
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:40.240]  That's an attack on us directly.
[2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:47.240]  Because this person that looks like a praying man is says that says that they want to restrict your speech.
[2:15:47.240 --> 2:15:53.240]  We're going to come back with Bob Barnes to get into this more and the latest on the ships that are on fire and potential of war.
[2:15:53.240 --> 2:15:54.240]  Stay with us.
[2:15:54.240 --> 2:15:58.240]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[2:15:58.240 --> 2:16:05.240]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally at heart and body extract?
[2:16:05.240 --> 2:16:08.240]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[2:16:08.240 --> 2:16:10.240]  Don't just take my word for it.

[2:16:31.240 --> 2:16:32.240]  I buy some.
[2:16:32.240 --> 2:16:33.240]  I use some.

[2:16:45.240 --> 2:16:47.240]  Life saving, ready to eat bacon.

[2:20:34.240 --> 2:20:39.240]  Okay, I've always said this, it's true.
[2:20:39.240 --> 2:20:44.240]  The most powerful broadcast I'm engaged in, I just don't plug.
[2:20:44.240 --> 2:20:46.240]  I don't plug, we don't fund the operation.
[2:20:46.240 --> 2:20:51.240]  So I just want listeners to know that I'm very thankful to all of you, I'm very appreciative.
[2:20:51.240 --> 2:20:55.240]  And I'll just say it, please don't forget, without you we're not here.
[2:20:55.240 --> 2:20:59.240]  And we're not going to compromise, we're not going to back down.
[2:20:59.240 --> 2:21:04.240]  Trump has signaled major actions against big tech, both publicly and privately.
[2:21:04.240 --> 2:21:07.240]  I'm going to fill you in on that next segment.
[2:21:07.240 --> 2:21:11.240]  Robert Barnes, one of our favorite gas constitutional lawyers and be with us a couple of segments.
[2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:14.240]  Then I'm going to host a little bit into the next hour with Matt Bracken today.
[2:21:14.240 --> 2:21:16.240]  We've got some very special guests tomorrow in studio.
[2:21:16.240 --> 2:21:22.240]  I'm just going to leave it at that for you, but a lot of big stuff happening here tomorrow.
[2:21:22.240 --> 2:21:31.240]  But I want to slow down for just a minute or two and invite listeners to really make your life better.
[2:21:31.240 --> 2:21:40.240]  And at the same time, know that the action you're taking in making your life better has a win-win 360 event involved in it.
[2:21:40.240 --> 2:21:48.240]  Buzzfeed, two years ago, tried to shut us down, went and had all of our products tested.
[2:21:48.240 --> 2:21:53.240]  And they found they all passed California standards, which almost no one can do.
[2:21:53.240 --> 2:22:01.240]  They're 900 times stronger than the second strongest systems, and that's the European Union.
[2:22:01.240 --> 2:22:07.240]  So they're a thousand times stronger than Texas standards.
[2:22:07.240 --> 2:22:10.240]  They're more toxins in the air than you're allowed to have in these products.
[2:22:10.240 --> 2:22:13.240]  That means non-detectable toxins of any type.
[2:22:13.240 --> 2:22:16.240]  Very expensive to get it certified like that.
[2:22:16.240 --> 2:22:18.240]  Methicabolamine.
[2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:25.240]  We signed a deal with a two-year contract to bring you twice as strong methicabolamine that is medical grade.
[2:22:25.240 --> 2:22:28.240]  But don't inject it, but that's what it's the same as.
[2:22:28.240 --> 2:22:34.240]  One tenth of what's in this bottle that you get from a doctor to inject costs like $100.
[2:22:34.240 --> 2:22:37.240]  It normally costs $29.95.
[2:22:37.240 --> 2:22:42.240]  You take it under the tongue, you get a lot better absorption than you would get by just swallowing it.
[2:22:42.240 --> 2:22:46.240]  So it's the second best way to absorb it.
[2:22:46.240 --> 2:22:48.240]  We signed it to your contract.
[2:22:48.240 --> 2:22:51.240]  We got a better deal on it and a lower price.
[2:22:51.240 --> 2:22:55.240]  And they said, listen, we can double the strength.
[2:22:55.240 --> 2:22:56.240]  We doubled it.
[2:22:56.240 --> 2:23:01.240]  So it's double the strength of the original Secret 12.
[2:23:01.240 --> 2:23:04.240]  It's Ultra 12 and we sold out of it all.
[2:23:04.240 --> 2:23:06.240]  But I saw it selling out really quick when it came out.
[2:23:06.240 --> 2:23:07.240]  I said, God, people are crazy about this.
[2:23:07.240 --> 2:23:09.240]  They know what a good deal it is.
[2:23:09.240 --> 2:23:15.240]  So we doubled the order and an 18-wheeler of it showed up yesterday.
[2:23:15.240 --> 2:23:20.240]  And I was at the warehouse signing some paperwork last night and I saw it pulling in.
[2:23:20.240 --> 2:23:22.240]  I said, oh, that's the Secret 12.
[2:23:22.240 --> 2:23:26.240]  But double strong, the Ultra 12.
[2:23:26.240 --> 2:23:31.240]  I said, I'm going to give a bottle away of that for free.
[2:23:31.240 --> 2:23:35.240]  Because you think 12-hour energy or six-hour energy or any of this stuff gives you any energy.
[2:23:35.240 --> 2:23:37.240]  It's dirty energy.
[2:23:37.240 --> 2:23:40.240]  You don't just get energy from speed or from caffeine.
[2:23:40.240 --> 2:23:45.240]  You get it from the building block of the body and that's B12, organic B12,
[2:23:45.240 --> 2:23:48.240]  methylcobalamin, the type you actually absorb.
[2:23:48.240 --> 2:23:53.240]  And so why would I take something that we were in the red the first four months of this year?
[2:23:53.240 --> 2:23:58.240]  And this got in and people knew how great it was and they bought so much of it, one of the black.
[2:23:58.240 --> 2:24:05.240]  And I said, but what if I sell half the load for free?
[2:24:05.240 --> 2:24:12.240]  Everybody sees how great it is for energy and stamina and focus and libido and everything else, a key building block.
[2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:14.240]  And then they'll love it.
[2:24:14.240 --> 2:24:15.240]  And so we're doing it.
[2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:21.240]  Free bottle of Ultra 12 with every purchase of the 8-pack power stack,
[2:24:21.240 --> 2:24:23.240]  which we launched a few weeks ago and I've been so busy.
[2:24:23.240 --> 2:24:26.240]  I've never even told you about the 8-pack power stack.
[2:24:26.240 --> 2:24:28.240]  It's four new formulas, 13 pills.
[2:24:28.240 --> 2:24:30.240]  You take half of the morning, half at night.
[2:24:30.240 --> 2:24:31.240]  They're in the little packs.
[2:24:31.240 --> 2:24:34.240]  They go in your lunchbox, go in your truck, give them to people.
[2:24:34.240 --> 2:24:35.240]  They're great.
[2:24:35.240 --> 2:24:41.240]  Wake up and work is the best formula you're going to find anywhere for flex and joint support,
[2:24:41.240 --> 2:24:46.240]  energy kickstart formula, krill oil formula that supercharges it all,
[2:24:46.240 --> 2:24:52.240]  a new tropic brain formula, and a green detox formula.
[2:24:52.240 --> 2:24:55.240]  That's in the morning, incredible.
[2:24:55.240 --> 2:24:57.240]  One handful, bang, it's down.
[2:24:57.240 --> 2:24:59.240]  Then at night, rest and recover.
[2:24:59.240 --> 2:25:00.240]  We'll put that back on screen.
[2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:02.240]  Rest and recover.
[2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:08.240]  And all the things it's got, an immune support formula, a sound sleep formula that's excellent as well,
[2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:13.240]  a krill oil formula that's great for nighttime, and a bone support formula.
[2:25:13.240 --> 2:25:18.240]  These are for people that are like me that forget to take all the great stuff we've got.
[2:25:18.240 --> 2:25:21.240]  Well, it's all just in two convenient packs.
[2:25:21.240 --> 2:25:25.240]  We put $25 in a box of this.
[2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:28.240]  No one's ever put $10 in something like this.
[2:25:28.240 --> 2:25:31.240]  And still people get great results because vitamins and minerals are so good.
[2:25:31.240 --> 2:25:33.240]  Even adulterated watered down crap.
[2:25:33.240 --> 2:25:35.240]  This is all pure amazing.
[2:25:35.240 --> 2:25:39.240]  We're selling it at 50% off with a free bottle.
[2:25:39.240 --> 2:25:43.240]  So all told, I'm close to losing money on this,
[2:25:43.240 --> 2:25:47.240]  but I want you to be blown away by the 8-pack PowerStack Daily Care,
[2:25:47.240 --> 2:25:52.240]  that you get it 50% off and a free bottle of Ultra 12.
[2:25:52.240 --> 2:25:54.240]  Little secret about marketing, I don't follow marketing.
[2:25:54.240 --> 2:25:55.240]  I do what I like.
[2:25:55.240 --> 2:25:56.240]  I'm a maverick.
[2:25:56.240 --> 2:25:57.240]  Everybody knows that.
[2:25:57.240 --> 2:25:58.240]  Some good, some bad.
[2:25:58.240 --> 2:26:04.240]  But I want you to see how great 8-pack PowerStack is and habitualize you to use this
[2:26:04.240 --> 2:26:08.240]  and to love it and get great responses and become a regular customer.
[2:26:08.240 --> 2:26:11.240]  But I also know that when you use Ultra 12,
[2:26:11.240 --> 2:26:15.240]  you're going to use it over and over and over and over again and love it.
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:20.240]  Free bottle of Ultra 12 with 8-pack PowerStack Daily Care, 50% off.
[2:26:20.240 --> 2:26:21.240]  You cannot.
[2:26:21.240 --> 2:26:25.240]  This is undoubtedly the best deal we've ever offered.
[2:26:25.240 --> 2:26:26.240]  And it's amazing.
[2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:31.240]  And I promise I'm only running it until next Friday
[2:26:31.240 --> 2:26:34.240]  because we think we'll probably sell half of our Ultra 12.
[2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:36.240]  We won't get more in for three, four months.
[2:26:36.240 --> 2:26:39.240]  We'll be able to keep it at regular price until that point.
[2:26:39.240 --> 2:26:41.240]  So thank you all who bought Ultra 12.
[2:26:41.240 --> 2:26:42.240]  Thank you.
[2:26:42.240 --> 2:26:46.240]  But here's other people's chances to get it for free at infowarslife.com.
[2:26:46.240 --> 2:26:49.240]  Okay, let's shift gears to Bob Barnes.
[2:26:49.240 --> 2:26:50.240]  I appreciate him holding 15 minutes.
[2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:52.240]  I got behind today and it got compounded.
[2:26:52.240 --> 2:26:57.240]  I wanted to get you on yesterday, but I couldn't on this latest disinfo.
[2:26:57.240 --> 2:26:59.240]  We'll talk about that next segment.
[2:26:59.240 --> 2:27:04.240]  But I separately wanted to get your take on Trump's tweet that Twitter better watch it
[2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:07.240]  and that there will be repercussions that he's coming after him.
[2:27:07.240 --> 2:27:09.240]  I've got the inside baseball on that.
[2:27:09.240 --> 2:27:11.240]  I know you've got your ear to the ground.
[2:27:11.240 --> 2:27:13.240]  What do you make of this?
[2:27:13.240 --> 2:27:17.240]  Well, he's starting to accelerate and I think it's been critical that he do so
[2:27:17.240 --> 2:27:22.240]  because the first he met with him, which is his protocol, his procedure.
[2:27:22.240 --> 2:27:24.240]  It did not change things.
[2:27:24.240 --> 2:27:27.240]  And then after that, he has now accelerated it to his son
[2:27:27.240 --> 2:27:29.240]  and other people were making public statements.
[2:27:29.240 --> 2:27:33.240]  And now he himself is making and he was making statements at public events.
[2:27:33.240 --> 2:27:36.240]  And now he's using the Twitter forum to do so.
[2:27:36.240 --> 2:27:40.240]  To use Twitter to talk to Twitter directly to the world.
[2:27:40.240 --> 2:27:45.240]  And so I think that there's a strong indicia that he's going to take meaningful action
[2:27:45.240 --> 2:27:49.240]  sometime over the next six months before the election season,
[2:27:49.240 --> 2:27:53.240]  above and beyond the antitrust investigations that are ongoing
[2:27:53.240 --> 2:27:56.240]  in order to make sure that something meaningfully happens here.
[2:27:56.240 --> 2:28:00.240]  Because if they don't take action, if the president doesn't take action,
[2:28:00.240 --> 2:28:03.240]  it's clear they're going to meddle and manipulate the election outcomes
[2:28:03.240 --> 2:28:07.240]  by silencing, suppressing and censoring the most important pro-Trump voices
[2:28:07.240 --> 2:28:09.240]  in the social media sphere.
[2:28:09.240 --> 2:28:11.240]  And it's the only way he can lose.
[2:28:11.240 --> 2:28:15.240]  He's not going to lose in a straight up race to Joe Biden that's honestly conducted.
[2:28:15.240 --> 2:28:19.240]  The only way he can lose is if his audience is not there to promote his message
[2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:23.240]  and his ideas and the American patriotic ideas to the country.
[2:28:23.240 --> 2:28:26.240]  So if he's serious and sincere about reelection,
[2:28:26.240 --> 2:28:30.240]  then he needs to take action on behalf of the free speech rights of all Americans
[2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:35.240]  or all of us in jeopardy, both his reelection opportunities and our free speech rights.
[2:28:36.240 --> 2:28:40.240]  When we come back, we'll get more into this and we'll shift gears into the attacks on us,
[2:28:40.240 --> 2:28:42.240]  which are really unprecedented.
[2:28:42.240 --> 2:28:47.240]  Not because it's attacks on us, but because it's a window into larger game plan of these individuals.
[2:28:47.240 --> 2:28:51.240]  Robert Barnes is my guest. I'm Alex Jones, newswars.com.
[2:28:51.240 --> 2:29:00.240]  Oh, these pains, my neck, my back, shoulders. I've got to get some relief.

[2:30:55.240 --> 2:31:00.240]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air. Thanks for calling Mike.
[2:31:00.240 --> 2:31:05.240]  You are the man, Alex. I'm so glad to be talking to you. I'm so excited. I'm such a big fan.
[2:31:05.240 --> 2:31:10.240]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products. I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[2:31:10.240 --> 2:31:15.240]  The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth.
[2:31:15.240 --> 2:31:20.240]  Tastes like, tastes like great milkshake. You know, if you just add it to milk.
[2:31:20.240 --> 2:31:26.240]  It tastes like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. Like good.
[2:31:26.240 --> 2:31:32.240]  I feel great since I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride free toothpaste.
[2:31:32.240 --> 2:31:38.240]  I've used the supermail vitality, a host of other products. So thank you so much for that as well.
[2:31:38.240 --> 2:31:41.240]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air. I'm thanking you.
[2:31:41.240 --> 2:31:47.240]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom, the true bone broth.
[2:31:47.240 --> 2:31:50.240]  It is next level. It really is good. So thank you.
[2:31:50.240 --> 2:31:53.240]  I feel great since I've been taking it. Thank you.
[2:31:56.240 --> 2:32:07.240]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[2:32:07.240 --> 2:32:16.240]  It's from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[2:32:16.240 --> 2:32:20.240]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[2:32:20.240 --> 2:32:27.240]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[2:32:27.240 --> 2:32:35.240]  And you may be experiencing back up too. So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to infowarstore.com and get oxy powder.

[2:33:18.240 --> 2:33:24.240]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:24.240 --> 2:33:52.240]  Alright, I'm Alex Jones, your host. Robert Barnes is our guest. I'm going to do some of the next hour with former Navy Shield best-selling author, security expert Matt Bracken, a particular expert on Iran.
[2:33:52.240 --> 2:33:56.240]  I believe Iran is behind the attacks on the ships. I'll tell you why next hour.
[2:33:56.240 --> 2:34:03.240]  That exclusive video from the first hour I broke it down has been posted to infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com.
[2:34:03.240 --> 2:34:13.240]  And as of the last time I checked, no one from the State Department, the White House, the Pentagon is saying Iran said in April and May and June.
[2:34:13.240 --> 2:34:19.240]  Over and over again, even a week ago, we're going to blow up ships in the Strait of Hormuz if you put sanctions on us.
[2:34:19.240 --> 2:34:25.240]  And they did it. And now they're acting like they didn't because they want to make it look like the U.S. strikes them first.
[2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:31.240]  This is pure terrorism, absolute Iranian, Persian type thinking, very sophisticated.
[2:34:31.240 --> 2:34:37.240]  They did it while the Japanese leaders there so that we won't attack because he's there right now.
[2:34:37.240 --> 2:34:42.240]  This is very sophisticated. They have taken credit for it before they did it.
[2:34:42.240 --> 2:34:45.240]  And so we're going to talk about that coming up with Matt Bracken.
[2:34:45.240 --> 2:34:51.240]  Getting back to Robert Barnes, I want to shift back to where you think Trump's going with all this.
[2:34:51.240 --> 2:34:59.240]  But first, let's hit this. They have a former U.S. attorney appointed by Obama who did bring down the governor of Connecticut.
[2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:10.240]  That's quite a feat. I've looked into this individual closely and what they're doing in our Connecticut case on Sandy Hook, which should affect everybody,
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:15.240]  is they keep acting like we're holding things back or not.
[2:35:15.240 --> 2:35:20.240]  And they're using, and I mean this nicely, the ignorance of the judge, because I don't know a lot of this IT stuff,
[2:35:20.240 --> 2:35:24.240]  to keep saying that we don't have things. And I really want to make a statement to the judge.
[2:35:24.240 --> 2:35:31.240]  I'm tempted to get on a plane for the next hearing and bring my IT folks who are smart but not experts on Google to explain.
[2:35:31.240 --> 2:35:36.240]  As you know, she ruled yesterday that we need to give them the Google files.
[2:35:36.240 --> 2:35:45.240]  Well, we've never printed files off Google other than general traffic stuff and some demographics about men or women and the percentage.
[2:35:45.240 --> 2:35:58.240]  And to have them all over the news saying, oh yes, the judge agrees, Jones is hiding things and engaged in obstruction and all this,
[2:35:58.240 --> 2:36:03.240]  is a fraud and a lie. And quite frankly, this guy is going to be out here deposing me in a few weeks.
[2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:07.240]  When I walk in that room, I'd be like, hey dude, you're the one that lives off these dead kids.
[2:36:07.240 --> 2:36:17.240]  I barely ever talked about it. In fact, at Google Analytics, we're glad we looked at it. It shows less than 0.2%.
[2:36:17.240 --> 2:36:23.240]  I mean, and that's all of it since then. I've talked about it a lot more because they've made me talk about it.
[2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:27.240]  And we looked at that in there and it shows that.
[2:36:27.240 --> 2:36:35.240]  So anything they come up with is a fraud and I wonder if they've done a parallel construction or I wonder, you know, they got really freaked out in court.
[2:36:35.240 --> 2:36:40.240]  And obviously we're going to find out who's funding them. We obviously know we're going to let them perjure themselves.
[2:36:40.240 --> 2:36:47.240]  You talk about real perjury. I don't think these guys know that we're not experts at marketing and stuff like they say we are,
[2:36:47.240 --> 2:36:55.240]  but we are experts on taking on organized crime. That means real organized crime, like Hillary Clinton and like Barack Obama, who's in bed with Hezbollah.
[2:36:55.240 --> 2:37:03.240]  And so I just don't think it's not a threat to these people. It's just that I just can't believe they're projecting onto me who they are.
[2:37:03.240 --> 2:37:10.240]  They're projecting onto me that I live off these families when I barely ever talked about them and they play edited tapes of what I really said.
[2:37:10.240 --> 2:37:17.240]  And that's why they're so pissed is they realize they don't have a damn case, but it's just dealing with them and watching what they do.
[2:37:17.240 --> 2:37:21.240]  I believe they're involved in some of the parallel construction. What do you think?
[2:37:21.240 --> 2:37:34.240]  Well, there's no question that there's a false premise of the suit because the suit in Connecticut is entirely predicated on the assumption that this was a analytically market driven product,
[2:37:34.240 --> 2:37:44.240]  that this was not about independent authentic ideas or independent perspectives of the world, that instead, and that it was entirely driven heavily just by same hook.
[2:37:44.240 --> 2:37:54.240]  And the reason why I have reason to believe that they know that allegation is false from the inception is that they have, quote unquote, media experts that are working with them,
[2:37:54.240 --> 2:38:05.240]  that are aligned with them, that are supporting them in different respects, who have reviewed according to their own sworn testimony, various, all the websites, all the web pages, all the broadcasts.
[2:38:05.240 --> 2:38:10.240]  You have people like Media Matters who are watching and recording and transcribing every single broadcast.
[2:38:10.240 --> 2:38:20.240]  So they knew there was no marketing tie in to anything related to beliefs and issues debating Sandy Hook because they saw the broadcast themselves.
[2:38:20.240 --> 2:38:25.240]  They saw the web pages themselves. They searched the broadcasts themselves. They searched the web pages themselves.
[2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:30.240]  And there was no advertising or marketing specific to Sandy Hook ever. There was nothing tied into it. Not only that.
[2:38:30.240 --> 2:38:40.240]  So Norm Pattis is a smart guy, but he's a busy guy. What are we going to tell the judge? Like, judge, these people tell you I'm this villain. They tell you I live off these dead kids.
[2:38:40.240 --> 2:38:47.240]  They're the one that sued the dead teacher and all these heroes and people, these lawyers, these creatures, and it's just we're not who they say.
[2:38:47.240 --> 2:38:54.240]  There is no evidence because it doesn't exist. That's what's so frustrating is, as you said, they know none of this is there.
[2:38:54.240 --> 2:39:02.240]  You've spent over a month here in our offices over the time. There's no planning. There's no marketing. It's all research. It's all guest.
[2:39:02.240 --> 2:39:14.240]  It's all analysis. It's all going out and videotaping stuff. What's our research? We think it's wrong that people from the Congo with one of the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever are just by the thousands being brought up.
[2:39:14.240 --> 2:39:26.240]  We go videotaping. It becomes national news. There is no marketing. Our news is our news. What I think is important, you've been around here just for the audience to know.
[2:39:26.240 --> 2:39:30.240]  Have you seen any calculation, any premeditated of anything?
[2:39:30.240 --> 2:39:44.240]  Not at all. In fact, everything at the program is focused entirely on news content. Ideas, spreading ideas, sharing ideas, researching ideas, investigating ideas, challenging establishment narratives, challenging political narratives, challenging the political power structure.
[2:39:44.240 --> 2:39:55.240]  That's the obsession of everybody who works there. To be frank, from a business perspective, there probably should have been marketing analytics and business studies and things like that, but you've never cared about that, never focused on it.
[2:39:55.240 --> 2:40:00.240]  Well, let's be honest. You saw my taxes. I've been totally overpaying like an idiot.
[2:40:00.240 --> 2:40:07.240]  Oh, completely. And not only that, I mean, for example, there probably are, you know, product studies that could have been done. You never do that.
[2:40:07.240 --> 2:40:09.240]  You look at what you like in the world.
[2:40:09.240 --> 2:40:17.240]  But the products, too, aren't connected to news. I have hundreds of clips I didn't get to. I have stacks of incredible stuff here.
[2:40:17.240 --> 2:40:28.240]  Putin's saying the world's going to end. I haven't even played that today. And they just go, oh, Sandy Hook, you, because they all are so politically dumb, these few Democrat lawyers think that's how they get in the news.
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:36.240]  They don't even know that the analytics, I'll tell you the analytics, when we covered a Sandy Hook story, I was on Joe Rogan, they put out over 30 videos.
[2:40:36.240 --> 2:40:42.240]  The average video has 3 million views. One of them has 14 million or whatever.
[2:40:42.240 --> 2:40:48.240]  These guys, the marketing is, I go, Joe, no one wants to hear about Sandy Hook, but okay, open it.
[2:40:48.240 --> 2:40:55.240]  The Sandy Hook piece has 200,000 views. The next lowest one has like a million and a half. That's analytics.
[2:40:55.240 --> 2:41:02.240]  And I don't cover something because I think it'll be big. I cover what I care about. But the analytics to these idiots is this.
[2:41:02.240 --> 2:41:13.240]  Everyone's sick of Sandy Hook, you dirty, stupid people, using these poor families. My God, you bloodsuckers. I'm not the bloodsucker. I'm not sucking off the dead kids and the families.
[2:41:13.240 --> 2:41:29.240]  In my view, in opinion, you're a bloodsucker. And it's just incredible. Barnes, I'm getting upset here because I am so sick of Sandy Hook, and I'm so sick of them saying, I'm like, oh my God, Alex Jones, did you know, he named his son after Sandy Hook.
[2:41:29.240 --> 2:41:37.240]  You know, he pays for his toilet paper with Sandy Hook. All Sandy Hook ever did was cost me money. We had stations when I questioned it, take me off the air.
[2:41:37.240 --> 2:41:45.240]  And we have the, thank God we looked into the analytics. It actually shows that. So what are they going to do, Bob, when the analytics show what we're saying is true, which you'd already told me.
[2:41:45.240 --> 2:41:51.240]  You should say, give it all to them. My issue is checking liability for what they can monkey with in there.
[2:41:51.240 --> 2:41:58.240]  Well, I think, I mean, the reality of the way Google works is that Google tracks a wide range of data for their own personal purposes.
[2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:01.240]  Well, that's my next point. I don't have access to hardly any of it.
[2:42:01.240 --> 2:42:10.240]  Correct. And that's deliberate by Google. Google does not allow people to have access to that except on a subscriber basis and on a limited basis and on a search order basis.
[2:42:10.240 --> 2:42:21.240]  So this is not data that any private company can own other than Google because Google wants to monopolize that data because Google is using that data to monetize what Google does.
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:28.240]  One of the great myths out there that some of the courts have bought into is that these big tech companies are offering free services. No, they're not.
[2:42:28.240 --> 2:42:38.240]  Google is monetizing the information for their own personal purposes. Anytime any human being searches Google, they are giving Google their personal private information, which Google will in turn monetize.
[2:42:38.240 --> 2:42:41.240]  And that's what Google does. This is Google's assets, Google's data.
[2:42:41.240 --> 2:42:52.240]  I know. And so what do I, because I don't know how to respond to this judge. Like, I don't know how this stuff all works. I've barely ever looked at it and they're just like, give us the Google. Well, we don't, we aren't even able to give you the Google.
[2:42:52.240 --> 2:43:12.240]  What does that even mean?
[2:43:23.240 --> 2:43:25.240]  So we're there folks. Tomorrow's news today.
[2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:30.240]  Impholwars.com! Woo!
[2:43:30.240 --> 2:43:36.240]  Impholwars.com, because that's much people out here. I'm talking about infowars.com.
[2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:39.240]  I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com. There you go.
[2:43:39.240 --> 2:43:47.240]  We knew this censorship was coming forever. We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air. Anybody can use it. We upload and do whatever you want.
[2:43:47.240 --> 2:43:53.240]  People go to infowars.com and newswars.com. That's where they find it. You know, there's what things called websites. Please go there.
[2:44:17.240 --> 2:44:30.240]  We need to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting infowars.
[2:44:30.240 --> 2:44:46.240]  And it's all because the audience spends there, whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see
[2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:56.240]  and what views they want to hold. And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[2:44:56.240 --> 2:45:11.240]  The globalists are hyper-competitive, scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[2:45:11.240 --> 2:45:22.240]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension. But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[2:45:22.240 --> 2:45:37.240]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLife.com, I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical modelman and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[2:45:37.240 --> 2:45:43.240]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:56.240]  It is amazing. Experience pure medical modelman B12 for yourself and fund the second American evolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA-253-3139.

[2:46:58.240 --> 2:47:13.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:47:13.240 --> 2:47:28.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:47:28.240 --> 2:47:43.240]  I knew Hillary came out and made that who I was and focused on that in the campaign. But I thought, okay, the lawyers involved, though, might actually be drinking the Kool-Aid. They might actually believe in the bullet. No, they know. They know I hardly ever talked about it. They know we don't have all this stuff. They know we didn't sell anything Sandy Hook related.
[2:47:43.240 --> 2:47:54.240]  They know that I didn't get up there and lie and question public events and false flags. Like I questioned today, was this staged with Iran? There's been so many staged events before. And they know I didn't create questioning it.
[2:47:54.240 --> 2:48:06.240]  They know it's totally American to do what I did. So they project this idea that I made all this money off Sandy Hook. And then when there's no evidence of that, they just keep demanding, we'll give it this or give that or any company we're ever connected to.
[2:48:06.240 --> 2:48:18.240]  We'll give us all their data and that will show what you did so they can try to misrepresent it to people that aren't technically informed. And that's really what I believe is going on here is a deliberate attempt to deceive the judge.
[2:48:18.240 --> 2:48:33.240]  And I'm not even worried about my particular case. I'm just running into the political class and just how bottomless they are and how bad they are and how the media works in concert to do this for this electronic lynching.
[2:48:33.240 --> 2:48:51.240]  And then in my name, they're on NPR and we're going, we just wish he'd stop sending people their houses and say it didn't happen. If he'd just apologize and it's all a lie. They know that years ago I said, well, even before they sued me, I said, well, if your feelings are hurt that I questioned, I apologize.
[2:48:51.240 --> 2:49:05.240]  And they go, oh, you admit you lied. And then it just goes on and on, on and on the coordinated garbage. And then in my name, these politicians and these talk show hosts like John Ronson, who is do never interview him folks.
[2:49:05.240 --> 2:49:12.240]  He will lie to your face. He will edit stuff, credibly deceptive. They try to murder the truth. And then they say you're the one doing it.
[2:49:12.240 --> 2:49:25.240]  So I want to digress into some more important things or stop digressing and get into more important things happening in the world and censorship. But I think this is really a sign of desperation by these folks. What do you think, Robert?
[2:49:25.240 --> 2:49:39.240]  Well, there's no doubt that there's this attempt to try to create the impression of you as being that caricature character from Homeland. And the media has tried to highlight aspects of any aspect of the litigation in a way to highlight that component,
[2:49:39.240 --> 2:49:56.240]  even though it's completely and utterly false. I mean, now you've had teams of lawyers come down and you gave them full, unfettered, unlimited, unrestricted access to all of your data and information, gave a far more access than any client I've ever known to do,
[2:49:56.240 --> 2:50:11.240]  or any other business I've ever known to do in litigation of a lifetime. And all of them came to the universal conclusion and all of them have in some for me to attest it under oath and directly to courts that the assumptions of the lawsuit in Connecticut are simply false.
[2:50:11.240 --> 2:50:31.240]  There was no big marketing plan around Sandy Hook, and that's evident by one primary fact. 99.98% of all news coverage and information during this time period from 2012 to 2018, the time frame covered under the suit, under the various suits,
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:49.240]  had nothing to do with Sandy Hook. And of the 0.002% that had anything to do with Sandy Hook, 90% of that was about the politicization of it, was about Big Pharma, was about whether there was a Freedom of Information Act cover-ups going on in state authorities in
[2:50:49.240 --> 2:51:03.240]  Connecticut, which the Connecticut Supreme Court ultimately confirmed, whether or not there was the politicians were saying things appropriately. And what's fascinating in this is a lot of information has come out about what politicians were covering up in Connecticut,
[2:51:03.240 --> 2:51:17.240]  including the fact that they failed to provide basic security techniques and mechanisms for their own teachers to protect their own kids. My nephew does some of this work where you always now in schools provide for schools to be able to lock the doors.
[2:51:17.240 --> 2:51:25.240]  Each teacher be able to lock the inside of the door so that they can protect their own students in case any kind of violent incident takes place.
[2:51:25.240 --> 2:51:34.240]  In Israel, of course, they train and arm the teachers to avoid terrorist events in their schools, and they've had extraordinary success defending their schools that way.
[2:51:34.240 --> 2:51:45.240]  Yet that's not what happened to Sandy Hook. And what's amazing is if the media would have done its job and meaningfully done inquiries, they could have exposed this fact about what the politicians were covering up in Sandy Hook at the time.
[2:51:45.240 --> 2:51:57.240]  And I guarantee you, every school in America would have had that safety mechanism put in place the very next day or within a week. That didn't happen. There may be schools right now that are in danger and that are not safe.
[2:51:57.240 --> 2:52:14.240]  Only because the media decided to make the issue one about guns, not an issue about school safety, not an issue about big pharma, not an issue about politicians going cheap and covered up for their own basic failures that left these kids in harm's way, that left these teachers in harm's way,
[2:52:14.240 --> 2:52:22.240]  that left these security individuals and others that were there in harm's way because they did not have the means to defend and protect themselves and protect the children in their care.
[2:52:22.240 --> 2:52:35.240]  And instead, these politicians, similar to what happened down in Florida. I mean, the big difference in Florida was that when Parkland, when they tried to blame just the gun, people pushed back against that narrative seeing what happened in Sandy Hook, and what happened?
[2:52:35.240 --> 2:52:40.240]  It exposed major law enforcement malfeasance and misconduct and what happened.
[2:52:40.240 --> 2:52:53.240]  So let me add to that. We had three students on the day after it happened and one of them, I forget his name, he was black. We don't look his name up. CNN said we hired an actor.
[2:52:53.240 --> 2:53:00.240]  So they say that we're saying they're hiring actors. We're not. Jalen Martin, we got to get him back on. Please get him back on.
[2:53:00.240 --> 2:53:09.240]  They go on CNN and say he's not a real student. Turns out he was because he said, I watched the police stand down and I watched the security guy stand around for 10 minutes.
[2:53:09.240 --> 2:53:15.240]  Well, that all turned out to be true. So instead, CNN then says we're using actors.
[2:53:15.240 --> 2:53:22.240]  Then they say take him off YouTube. He says no one died. That wasn't true. We broke that the police stood down.
[2:53:22.240 --> 2:53:31.240]  So their answer was again, in my name, to say that no one died. I mean, this is next level, my friend. This is next level.
[2:53:31.240 --> 2:53:41.240]  Absolutely. And really, so half of what's going on here by the press and by the politicians is a hit job on you, as has been admitted by other high profile members of the press to me personally.
[2:53:41.240 --> 2:53:54.240]  But the other half of it is the press and the politicians gun control agenda, which is in order to blame guns only, they have to hide evidence about other culprits.
[2:53:54.240 --> 2:54:03.240]  That's why they're not talking about Big Pharma. That's why they're not talking about Hollywood celebrating serial killer kind of activities and films and other TV cultural impacts.
[2:54:03.240 --> 2:54:09.240]  That's why they're not talking about school safety mechanisms that could make schools truly safe and thoroughly safe.
[2:54:09.240 --> 2:54:13.240]  They're not talking about adequate law enforcement response as arose as an issue in Parkland.
[2:54:13.240 --> 2:54:22.240]  They're not talking about this cult of personality that the media has helped develop ever since Columbine that's triggering repeat and copycat people doing.
[2:54:22.240 --> 2:54:26.240]  And they hype school shootings up so it's an option in someone's mental menu.
[2:54:26.240 --> 2:54:30.240]  Exactly. And they know this. They know Jake Tapper has talked about this.
[2:54:30.240 --> 2:54:34.240]  And it's finally starting to say we shouldn't be using the person's name. We shouldn't be celebrating him.
[2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:41.240]  The left one in the United States was the result response that New Zealand gave, which was talking about banning all guns, talking about banning all guns.
[2:54:41.240 --> 2:54:53.240]  And they know they've been using and promoting and hyping school shootings to get guns while ignoring all the real causes. They feel guilty. So they want to make me the homeland character that made all my success off them.
[2:54:53.240 --> 2:54:57.240]  And they all know it's a damn lie. And the truth is it's them. It's pure projection.
[2:54:57.240 --> 2:55:09.240]  How many kids did they put in harm's way by not fully developing the investigative research and review to show what was really happening in Sandy Hook and in other school shootings?
[2:55:09.240 --> 2:55:16.240]  Had they meaningfully dealt with the cult of personality they were creating, that people like Cassandra Fairbanks have documented in detail.
[2:55:16.240 --> 2:55:27.240]  If they had meaningfully dealt with basic school safety techniques that they chose not to utilize in that place because politicians wouldn't have saved a few cents and lined their own pockets instead effectively by what they were doing.
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:38.240]  If they had meaningfully dealt with big pharma and the impact of the lack of effective treatment for a wide range of people, part of it relates to homeless explosion in the United States.
[2:55:38.240 --> 2:55:43.240]  The lack of effective response has not been adequate to deal with people who are mentally ill.
[2:55:43.240 --> 2:55:55.240]  So let me ask you this. Where do you think, not my cases, where does this go in the general? Because everywhere in the news and we're getting calls and we're getting messages and people like, why are you saying you think Iran did it?
[2:55:55.240 --> 2:56:07.240]  You know, you're the false flag guy. No, I always just question, could this be staged to have a stack of historical documents where we and others have staged attacks on ships to get us into the Vietnam to get us into World War One to get us into the Spanish American War.
[2:56:07.240 --> 2:56:15.240]  But that doesn't mean this is staged because the Mullahs said, you cut off our money two months ago. We're going to blow up ships to the Strait of Hormuz. They did it.
[2:56:15.240 --> 2:56:18.240]  Now, of course, they're denying it because they want us to strike first.
[2:56:18.240 --> 2:56:24.240]  But when you say you're going to do something and then you do it, the Pentagon says, we believe they're about to do it a week ago and it happens.
[2:56:24.240 --> 2:56:32.240]  I tend to side with the Pentagon on this because you're not like the whole Pentagon's bad. Sometimes bad general stage things like LL Limitzer. Sometimes they don't.
[2:56:32.240 --> 2:56:36.240]  I trust Trump on this. Trump doesn't stand a game from this. We don't want war with Iran.
[2:56:36.240 --> 2:56:44.240]  And so, I mean, that's the reality. So the public's mad at me for saying, I think Iran did it, but I'm supposedly Mr. False Flag. I'm not.
[2:56:44.240 --> 2:56:47.240]  I really tell people what I think, Bob.
[2:56:47.240 --> 2:56:59.240]  Oh, precisely. And I think if you compare it to, if you put info wars coverage of major war related events or in your discussions of it, going back to 1991 as a 17 year old,
[2:56:59.240 --> 2:57:08.240]  we are discussing these events on ham radio and then on public access and then on talk radio and now through the info wars network, you can trace that to the New York Times.
[2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:13.240]  The New York Times doesn't come out of the winning end of the misinformation correct information battle.
[2:57:13.240 --> 2:57:18.240]  The New York Times told us that babies died in incubators and to get us into Iraq war one.
[2:57:18.240 --> 2:57:21.240]  The New York Times told us that their weapons of mass destruction Iraq.
[2:57:21.240 --> 2:57:28.240]  New York Times predicted various aspects of things related to 9 11 that proved that false and books like looming tower the rest.
[2:57:28.240 --> 2:57:34.240]  We go all the way back to New York Times as a notorious history of promoting propaganda and misinformation to get us into wars.
[2:57:34.240 --> 2:57:38.240]  Well, info wars has been more accurate and far more accurate than the New York Times has ever been.
[2:57:38.240 --> 2:57:40.240]  And they want to project all their inaccuracy on us.
[2:57:40.240 --> 2:57:44.240]  Let's finish up the mad brackets taken over our number four. Stay with us.

[3:00:08.240 --> 3:00:20.240]  Well, there's big developments on Iran. Pompeo says that it's the Iranians.
[3:00:20.240 --> 3:00:23.240]  Some of my crew isn't mad at me, but they disagree.
[3:00:23.240 --> 3:00:26.240]  I think it's a false flag. They're scared to come on.
[3:00:26.240 --> 3:00:30.240]  So I'm trying to get him to get on with us the next segment.
[3:00:30.240 --> 3:00:34.240]  Going back to Bob Barnes.
[3:00:34.240 --> 3:00:38.240]  The Democrats are really desperate and they've always done corrupt stuff,
[3:00:38.240 --> 3:00:39.240]  but not just in our cases, but other things.
[3:00:39.240 --> 3:00:41.240]  They've thrown caution to the wind.
[3:00:41.240 --> 3:00:44.240]  And whether it's the Covington kids that you're involved in filing suits,
[3:00:44.240 --> 3:00:47.240]  or whether it's the small and just smulling,
[3:00:47.240 --> 3:00:51.240]  and just everything they do turns to crap now because people used to be unconscious
[3:00:51.240 --> 3:00:53.240]  and were kind of buying in.
[3:00:53.240 --> 3:00:56.240]  Everybody, you know, is questioning now.
[3:00:56.240 --> 3:00:59.240]  And even when I say Iran may have done this because they threatened it a month ago,
[3:00:59.240 --> 3:01:01.240]  I think that's a good reason to say they may have done it.
[3:01:01.240 --> 3:01:04.240]  My own crew's kind of shaking their head at me.
[3:01:04.240 --> 3:01:05.240]  I'm the bad guy here.
[3:01:05.240 --> 3:01:08.240]  So what I'm saying is that's fine. It's free speech.
[3:01:08.240 --> 3:01:09.240]  I don't run a cult here.
[3:01:09.240 --> 3:01:12.240]  People ask, well, how does Watson think that it did happen that you think it might not have?
[3:01:12.240 --> 3:01:14.240]  Because we're not running a cult. I respect people.
[3:01:14.240 --> 3:01:16.240]  We're really trying to find the truth.
[3:01:16.240 --> 3:01:20.240]  We don't get a talking point here, but what are they going to do?
[3:01:20.240 --> 3:01:25.240]  Am I right from your historical research or smart guy that they've kind of gone insane
[3:01:25.240 --> 3:01:29.240]  and they didn't get that governors on behavior were there for a good reason to protect them?
[3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:32.240]  Because they've just gone crazy.
[3:01:32.240 --> 3:01:37.240]  I think, I mean, actually, Jordan Peterson had a good description of this when he was on Joe Rogan.
[3:01:37.240 --> 3:01:40.240]  He said he thought they were in a state of desperation,
[3:01:40.240 --> 3:01:43.240]  so they're throwing Hail Marys across the board and the presses attempt,
[3:01:43.240 --> 3:01:48.240]  and they're destroying their long-term brand just for short-term clicks
[3:01:48.240 --> 3:01:52.240]  to try to stay afloat in the modern social media era
[3:01:52.240 --> 3:01:58.240]  when more and more people recognize and realize that the primary and principal sources of misinformation,
[3:01:58.240 --> 3:02:02.240]  particularly consequential misinformation that leads to wars and conflicts
[3:02:02.240 --> 3:02:08.240]  and unnecessary division in America and the world, is the mainstream establishment press.
[3:02:08.240 --> 3:02:11.240]  So the New York Times has probably been the primary source of misinformation
[3:02:11.240 --> 3:02:15.240]  that helped propagate horrible events since 1930.
[3:02:15.240 --> 3:02:19.240]  I mean, the New York Times covered up Stalin's, what Stalin was doing in the Soviet Union.
[3:02:19.240 --> 3:02:22.240]  Initially said that Hitler might be a good guy.
[3:02:22.240 --> 3:02:25.240]  Initially, they covered up what was happening in the Holocaust,
[3:02:25.240 --> 3:02:30.240]  and they buried it in the inside pages of their, in the bottom pages of their articles and their news stories.
[3:02:30.240 --> 3:02:35.240]  Then after that, 1959, told everybody that Castro was really just a nice guy,
[3:02:35.240 --> 3:02:37.240]  and he was, they said, I remember this before I read it.
[3:02:37.240 --> 3:02:39.240]  He was the Abraham Lincoln of the Caribbean.
[3:02:39.240 --> 3:02:40.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:02:40.240 --> 3:02:44.240]  In fact, what they said was, yes, he did say when he was doing the revolution
[3:02:44.240 --> 3:02:46.240]  that he was not going to be part of the government,
[3:02:46.240 --> 3:02:49.240]  but that was just a reflection of naivete, not hypocrisy.
[3:02:49.240 --> 3:02:52.240]  That's what they said in 1959 after he seized complete power.
[3:02:52.240 --> 3:02:56.240]  So then, of course, they spread further lies with the Gulf of Tonkin.
[3:02:56.240 --> 3:02:59.240]  Together send to Vietnam another fake attack on a ship.
[3:02:59.240 --> 3:03:01.240]  Yeah, exactly. You go on and on and on.
[3:03:01.240 --> 3:03:04.240]  So you look at the Iranian event, you have publications like Zero Heads
[3:03:04.240 --> 3:03:06.240]  that are arguing it might be a false flag.
[3:03:06.240 --> 3:03:10.240]  You have other people who believe it's a sincere event based on the reasons you've articulated
[3:03:10.240 --> 3:03:12.240]  that Iran has sort of foreshadowed this coming.
[3:03:12.240 --> 3:03:16.240]  You know, I'm going to wait and see mode myself.
[3:03:16.240 --> 3:03:20.240]  But the key is we need people challenging establishment narratives.
[3:03:20.240 --> 3:03:24.240]  And the whole goal of what these various, the way the press and the politicians
[3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:28.240]  have covered this lawsuit is Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut made clear
[3:03:28.240 --> 3:03:32.240]  his goal was to shut you down, silence you, prevent your audience from supporting you.
[3:03:32.240 --> 3:03:34.240]  They've prejudiced themselves.
[3:03:34.240 --> 3:03:36.240]  They've admitted the real goal is a silent speech
[3:03:36.240 --> 3:03:39.240]  and that they're going to have to lie to try to get that done.
[3:03:39.240 --> 3:03:41.240]  And you're seeing it just now go across the board.
[3:03:41.240 --> 3:03:44.240]  When they're going after Milk Toast Liberals like Philip DeFranco
[3:03:44.240 --> 3:03:49.240]  and a Sunday front page New York Times article as they did just this past Sunday,
[3:03:49.240 --> 3:03:52.240]  you get a sense of the scale, the size and the scope of this.
[3:03:52.240 --> 3:03:56.240]  And ultimately the goal is to not allow what happened in 2016 to reoccur ever again.
[3:03:56.240 --> 3:04:00.240]  Oh, they've decided all the governments all over the world just want to get rid of the internet itself
[3:04:00.240 --> 3:04:02.240]  being a free open thing for general access to the public.
[3:04:02.240 --> 3:04:05.240]  They decided, oh gosh, we're all dead meat.
[3:04:05.240 --> 3:04:08.240]  So first they throw out Alex Jones and now it's liberal Philip DeFranco
[3:04:08.240 --> 3:04:10.240]  who they call the kingpin of brainwashing.
[3:04:10.240 --> 3:04:15.240]  I mean, the guy literally attacks me constantly and it supported me being silenced.
[3:04:15.240 --> 3:04:16.240]  Correct, exactly.
[3:04:16.240 --> 3:04:21.240]  I mean, so you look at all of it, I mean, there's a consistent effort to suppress and censor and control speech.
[3:04:21.240 --> 3:04:24.240]  And the consistent effort is Philip DeFranco didn't go under their control monetarily.
[3:04:24.240 --> 3:04:25.240]  Correct, exactly.
[3:04:25.240 --> 3:04:28.240]  And in fact what's happening is in fact they're diverting money and diverting eyes
[3:04:28.240 --> 3:04:30.240]  and diverting resources from the establishment narrative.
[3:04:30.240 --> 3:04:34.240]  And it's not only that, what's happening sort of broad scale and wholesale
[3:04:34.240 --> 3:04:37.240]  is that originally the internet was designed as a surveillance technique
[3:04:37.240 --> 3:04:41.240]  to develop gain and that's how a lot of the Intel companies saw it, Intel operative saw it.
[3:04:41.240 --> 3:04:45.240]  And now it's become a free speech explosion in the original First Amendment.
[3:04:45.240 --> 3:04:48.240]  That's right, because electricity can flow both ways.
[3:04:48.240 --> 3:05:17.240]  Let's do two more minutes on that key point you just made when we come back. Stay with us.
[3:05:18.240 --> 3:05:19.240]  Thank you.
[3:05:48.240 --> 3:06:00.240]  The Alex Jones Show.
[3:06:18.240 --> 3:06:31.240]  All right, a few more minutes with Bob Barnes, constitutional lawyer.
[3:06:31.240 --> 3:06:37.240]  On how the globalists admitted that the internet was developed by DARPA, developed by scientists to communicate with each other.
[3:06:37.240 --> 3:06:47.240]  And it was developed by psychiatrists, the idea of it to track people psychologically and make sure they were following stimuli over the intergalactic communication grid.
[3:06:47.240 --> 3:06:52.240]  If you go back to the original documents in the 50s, but it was just theorized and by the 60s they had it,
[3:06:52.240 --> 3:06:54.240]  CD-ROMs by then everything.
[3:06:54.240 --> 3:07:01.240]  And then it was slowly deployed to the public and they're about 30 years advanced, 40 years advanced depending on the technological area you look at.
[3:07:01.240 --> 3:07:07.240]  But they always thought we'll be able to control them with it with this worldwide web.
[3:07:07.240 --> 3:07:12.240]  But instead, humans are manifesting their will no matter what they do.
[3:07:12.240 --> 3:07:20.240]  And once that Promethean fire has been released, it's spreading and I think they now realize just cut the whole damn thing off and turn it into a glorified Netflix.
[3:07:20.240 --> 3:07:32.240]  The order went out to spend trillions to produce tens of thousands of movies a year to hopefully have everybody stop looking at the real world and people on the internet.
[3:07:32.240 --> 3:07:34.240]  But that hasn't worked either.
[3:07:34.240 --> 3:07:39.240]  And so their total panic mode is accelerating. Where does it go now?
[3:07:39.240 --> 3:07:43.240]  I mean, now it's basically do we choose the Chinese social credit model system or not?
[3:07:43.240 --> 3:07:50.240]  Because the Chinese system is use the internet solely for the purposes of censorship, control thought, monitoring people's activity,
[3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:58.240]  use these new technologies to not only spy on people but brand them and to brand them in such a way that the world looks at them in a certain way.
[3:07:58.240 --> 3:08:06.240]  They have limited access to certain resources that it's a new social status structure created with this literal social credit system.
[3:08:06.240 --> 3:08:18.240]  And what you're seeing is the same thing now that some parts of big tech in the US are pursuing the part because they want access to the Chinese market but also in part because they like the Chinese model better.
[3:08:18.240 --> 3:08:27.240]  Big tech has a controlling totalitarian mindset by its very nature because they tend to be monopolies for technological reasons.
[3:08:27.240 --> 3:08:41.240]  So when you create money, it's the old rule. You give the more power, the more corrupt. And that's what happens with monopolies. That's why back in the 19th century we passed the Sherman Act and other laws to prohibit these from ever rising and controlling our politics ever again.
[3:08:41.240 --> 3:08:50.240]  And now we have the most dangerous monopolies the world has ever seen in big tech that can control people's speech, control how people think, control how people act and react.
[3:08:50.240 --> 3:09:04.240]  And you look at their alignment with big pharma, you look at their alignment with big governments in China. They are without doubt the most dangerous threat, most pernicious threat to American democracy and freedom not only here but its principles and precepts around the world.
[3:09:04.240 --> 3:09:14.240]  That's why as we started this conversation what President Trump said was critical because the next great battle for the future of America and the world is the battle of big tech.
[3:09:14.240 --> 3:09:28.240]  And this is already a cyber war not just taking out servers or hydroelectric dams. It's a war by governments and major corporations over the architecture of the internet whether there's freedom or not.
[3:09:28.240 --> 3:09:43.240]  And the chai comms of the EU have all weighed in to end freedom worldwide for the general public and small businesses and our government's paralyzed in fake libertarian propaganda that isn't in the real world that it's like saying liberals say give free stuff to everybody.
[3:09:43.240 --> 3:09:49.240]  But then everybody comes here and the whole system collapses which is the cloward and pivoted communist plan. Well it's the same thing with conservatives.
[3:09:49.240 --> 3:10:05.240]  They're like let the market handle it. It's not market when it's the communist Chinese and the EU teamed up regulating the internet and so the companies by extension because of a power vacuum bow to China and the EU because our government doesn't pass prohibitive laws saying you will not violate people's rights here.
[3:10:05.240 --> 3:10:12.240]  You've now handed it over to them and a few greedy big tech corporations and big media corporations that are falling apart.
[3:10:12.240 --> 3:10:22.240]  They hope to make bigger profits in the future if they can bring in an authoritarian model here but that will destroy their free market model that made them so great to begin with.
[3:10:22.240 --> 3:10:30.240]  And now they had antitrust hearings in Congress as you know in the last two days. And it's not about the monopolistic practices going on.
[3:10:30.240 --> 3:10:41.240]  It's a bunch of bitching and complaining. A big media company saying we're going bankrupt. We need to make big tech only link to our articles and promote us.
[3:10:41.240 --> 3:10:53.240]  Well that's the same thing they've been saying for five, six years. And so that brought us the model of sycophantic dying media and sycophantic collapsing political parties who don't even know what planet they're on or 50 years behind.
[3:10:53.240 --> 3:11:06.240]  Joining with big tech to be the police of the internet to take out their competition but all they did was destroy themselves and discredit themselves with the public in the process while big tech six backs and laughs at how this is happening.
[3:11:06.240 --> 3:11:14.240]  But we've been more sophisticated to expose the full spectrum analysis. Give it to the president and others. They concur. The Pentagon concurs. And so now it's game over.
[3:11:14.240 --> 3:11:27.240]  Because Google and others were so arrogant as to move with Apple to China now 14 months ago and openly declare that we're done and a joke and a bunch of old curmudges that didn't couldn't find their ass with both hands.
[3:11:27.240 --> 3:11:37.240]  And they told the Pentagon we're not going to help you in any way because you're done. That actually caused like Frankenstein to be struck by lightning to wake up so as bad as our military industrial complex is.
[3:11:37.240 --> 3:11:48.240]  It went when it came to reckoning and actually dying politically and handing it over to the chai comms and people. Their old separation of powers instinct kicked in and they said no we will not be your slave.
[3:11:48.240 --> 3:12:00.240]  And now the battles on and Google is crapping its drawers. Facebook Twitter are all known now. It's over and they know it's begun. So everybody keeps spreading the word because we're not winning.
[3:12:00.240 --> 3:12:12.240]  But we're at least awake again and in the fight. Oh exactly. It's like we're at Bunker Hill and one of my great great grandfathers was the colonel who said don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes.
[3:12:12.240 --> 3:12:22.240]  And the colonel Prescott who my brother is named after. So the it's that's basically where we're at politically and structurally and the big difference between populism and the establishment left and the establishment right.
[3:12:22.240 --> 3:12:34.240]  Is it distrust concentrated power in the form of the government or concentrated power in the form of private corporations and big monopolies. And that's what the populist revolution is what they never anticipated unearthing.
[3:12:34.240 --> 3:12:47.240]  They thought the Obama era of social media was going to be their perfect ideal era and that was what was going to move forward collectively. What they didn't realize is that when you gave the technological tools for people to express their own views.
[3:12:47.240 --> 3:13:01.240]  In the same way that info wars allows its audience to allow its audience's voice to be reached and its audience voice to be heard and its audience voice to hear what they want to hear by supporting info wars by being part of this economic self supporting self sustaining
[3:13:01.240 --> 3:13:16.240]  system that provides an independent little D Democratic experiment for free speech free press and free markets in the same way that it was sort of the ultimate counter to the establishment Chinese social credit based kind of economic system where you have concentrated
[3:13:16.240 --> 3:13:25.240]  economic and social and political power in the hands of so few. The their goal was one in which they got to dictate thoughts and ideas and they thought the Obama era would dominate.
[3:13:25.240 --> 3:13:32.240]  But the reality is when you empower ordinary people to pick their own news and their own views which was inherent to the technology that social media.
[3:13:32.240 --> 3:13:42.240]  That's right. They've already moved light years beyond it. Robert Barnes. Thank you so much. I mean in the final equation they've miscalculated. Now there's a known fight over the future of speech.
[3:13:42.240 --> 3:13:55.240]  They pressed too hard and I don't be too confident here but I would I would characterize this as the Germans Eastern Front collapsing in 19 late 1943 early 1944.
[3:13:55.240 --> 3:14:08.240]  Oh it's very much the emperor has no clothes. Everybody can see what's taking place. Everybody can see what's happening with the we've landed at Normandy and everybody on the other side can see the inevitable outcome and consequence that's coming down the pipeline.
[3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:19.240]  And the as long as people sustain their independent at the as long as they sustain organizations like Info Wars against this onslaught and assault then this lawfare will fail.
[3:14:19.240 --> 3:14:29.240]  This political warfare will fail. This attempts of censorship and state control will fail because President Trump will act and because he acts because he listens to the audience.
[3:14:29.240 --> 3:14:38.240]  He listens to the public. He listens to his voters his constituents and the one of the most critical foundational base component to that is the Info Wars audience.
[3:14:38.240 --> 3:14:48.240]  So as long as they show that they're going to continue to support and sustain Info Wars against this extraordinary unprecedented assault and attack then they are the ones with the real power.
[3:14:48.240 --> 3:15:03.240]  And that's what all of this is this guy does designed to disguise. It's designed to disguise that the ordinary person holds the real power against all of this corrupted corrosively corrupted institutional establishment that wants to shut them up.
[3:15:03.240 --> 3:15:18.240]  He wants to censor them wants to suppress them wants to fuck control them wants to behave control them wants to restrict the 1st Amendment rights 2nd Amendment rights 4th Amendment rights 5th and 6th Amendment rights 8th Amendment rights that will not work and cannot succeed as long as they continue to support one another.
[3:15:18.240 --> 3:15:31.240]  And through supporting Info Wars as an example and illustration of that the ultimate little D Democratic example of a self supporting self sustaining free priests free press free speech free market institution in the world today.
[3:15:31.240 --> 3:15:38.240]  And against all this onslaught against all this attack still stand like the Star Spangled Banner it still waves.
[3:15:38.240 --> 3:15:50.240]  Beautiful said where the real power lay. God bless you my friend we'll be right back with the latest on the Iran crisis thank you so much sir the latest on the Iran crisis and it is a crisis is it a false flag or is it real.

[3:19:01.240 --> 3:19:13.240]  To talk to you before I get into what I want to say I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all I was turned on to the ultimate female force I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic root things like that that I trust.
[3:19:13.240 --> 3:19:20.240]  You know because I've seen a lot of other vitamins they don't have things that they say that they have in them and they're often not things that are natural I appreciate that.
[3:19:20.240 --> 3:19:22.240]  Well what happened with ultimate female force tell us about it.
[3:19:22.240 --> 3:19:29.240]  Well it's really great you know it's like a multivitamin I take it it tastes good it doesn't have that nasty aftertaste it actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[3:19:29.240 --> 3:19:33.240]  And you know it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day so I really like it.
[3:19:33.240 --> 3:19:40.240]  Well just so you know we look at whatever the best herbs are they're known to turbo charge women and then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[3:19:40.240 --> 3:19:47.240]  So yeah stamina libido energy these are amazing things and ultimate female force so I'm glad you plugged it.
[3:19:47.240 --> 3:20:00.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:17.240 --> 3:20:38.240]  Surfing nuclear war surfing the apocalypse hopefully not.
[3:20:38.240 --> 3:20:41.240]  You know I go with my gut.
[3:20:41.240 --> 3:20:48.240]  I know the Democrats are allied with Hezbollah and with the Arab Spring and with MS 13.
[3:20:48.240 --> 3:20:59.240]  I've seen it with my own eyes I've witnessed it and then I was told by high level good people who don't want to be in Syria who don't want to be in Afghanistan.
[3:20:59.240 --> 3:21:02.240]  But they say Iran is a real issue.
[3:21:02.240 --> 3:21:08.240]  And Saudi Arabia is going to attack them if they continue to get delivery systems to the nuclear weapons they already have.
[3:21:08.240 --> 3:21:15.240]  They have a family that was involved in some of the operations 10 years ago that Iran has nuclear weapons.
[3:21:15.240 --> 3:21:18.240]  But I'm not going to get into all that.
[3:21:18.240 --> 3:21:30.240]  I was told Saudi Arabia had them and it later came out was true for my family who wouldn't get into tales but they have satellites they have aircraft folks they can see this they see it they know what it looks like.
[3:21:30.240 --> 3:21:37.240]  Even if it's a half mile under the ground when they try to transport it and move it when they're able to catch it.
[3:21:37.240 --> 3:21:43.240]  I know though the history of false flags and I'm going to co host this hour with Matt Bracken and I'll go into some of those a little bit later.
[3:21:43.240 --> 3:21:49.240]  I had to put out the video in the first hour saying though Iran admits to attacking ships.
[3:21:49.240 --> 3:22:02.240]  In previous statements because when you say two months ago you put tariffs on us or you put sanctions on our main government group the Revolutionary Guard that's the government.
[3:22:02.240 --> 3:22:07.240]  That's the ruling Pretorian Guard we're going to attack you.
[3:22:07.240 --> 3:22:11.240]  So there's exclusive Iran admits to bombing ships vows more terror attacks.
[3:22:11.240 --> 3:22:16.240]  Now is it clickbait not exactly because I get into the video and I say we don't know 100%.
[3:22:16.240 --> 3:22:26.240]  But when they say in a bunch of statements at press TV that we're going to torpedo and sink ships the trade or moose if the United States does this they deserve to be the prime suspects.
[3:22:26.240 --> 3:22:34.240]  My book basically said they did it or they could be attacked for making that statement because they could now be blamed.
[3:22:34.240 --> 3:22:43.240]  If I said hypothetically I'm coming over to Bob's house if he does X to shoot him in the head and then Bob gets shot in the head the next week after he does X I'm the prime suspect.
[3:22:43.240 --> 3:22:47.240]  You could have the headline Alex Jones said he killed Bob.
[3:22:47.240 --> 3:22:48.240]  That's it.
[3:22:48.240 --> 3:22:51.240]  Ron Paul is a great point on this we'll play the clip next segment.
[3:22:51.240 --> 3:22:53.240]  I'm going to go to Matt here in a moment.
[3:22:53.240 --> 3:22:56.240]  The neocons could be setting Trump up.
[3:22:56.240 --> 3:23:03.240]  I said just a month ago the four ways Trump can lose reelection is they trick him into a war and then they do a pig to make him look like a like a failure.
[3:23:03.240 --> 3:23:13.240]  That's one can commit to a war they're going to sabotage you want and the Democrats have got that written all over them so the neocons collapse the economy to the Federal Reserve.
[3:23:13.240 --> 3:23:15.240]  Steal the election.
[3:23:15.240 --> 3:23:17.240]  And have collapsed borders.
[3:23:17.240 --> 3:23:19.240]  Those are the things Trump has to deal with.
[3:23:19.240 --> 3:23:21.240]  So I don't want to war Iran.
[3:23:21.240 --> 3:23:23.240]  A bunch of ships have been sabotaged.
[3:23:23.240 --> 3:23:24.240]  That didn't do anything.
[3:23:24.240 --> 3:23:25.240]  Now they're getting torpedoed.
[3:23:25.240 --> 3:23:26.240]  Now they're getting bombed.
[3:23:26.240 --> 3:23:28.240]  Now they're sinking.
[3:23:28.240 --> 3:23:36.240]  And you've got Pompeo saying I ran responsible for blatant assault on oil tankers Gulf of Oman.
[3:23:36.240 --> 3:23:37.240]  We're going to play that clip right now.
[3:23:37.240 --> 3:23:39.240]  Here it is.
[3:23:39.240 --> 3:23:48.240]  It is the assessment of the United States government that the Islamic Republic of Iran is responsible for the attacks that occurred in the Gulf of Oman today.
[3:23:48.240 --> 3:23:55.240]  This assessment is based on intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute the operation.
[3:23:55.240 --> 3:24:07.240]  Recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.
[3:24:07.240 --> 3:24:16.240]  This is only the latest in a series of attacks instigated by the Islamic Republic of Iran and its surrogance against American and allied interests.
[3:24:16.240 --> 3:24:23.240]  And they should be understood in the context of 40 years of unprovoked aggression against freedom loving nations.
[3:24:23.240 --> 3:24:30.240]  On April 22nd Iran promised the world that it would interrupt the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz.
[3:24:30.240 --> 3:24:35.240]  It is now working to execute on that promise.
[3:24:35.240 --> 3:24:42.240]  In early May the Revolutionary Guard Corps attempted the covert deployment of modified dows capable of launching missiles.
[3:24:42.240 --> 3:24:47.240]  On May 12th Iran attacked four commercial ships near the Strait of Hormuz.
[3:24:47.240 --> 3:24:57.240]  On May 14th Iran-backed surrogates attacked by armed drones struck two strategically important oil pipelines in the Saudi Arabia.
[3:24:57.240 --> 3:25:01.240]  On May 19th a rocket landed near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
[3:25:01.240 --> 3:25:10.240]  On May 31st a car bomb in Afghanistan wounded four U.S. service members killed four Afghan civilians and wounded bystanders.
[3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:19.240]  Yesterday Iranian surrogance fired a missile in the Saudi Arabia striking the arrival terminal of an international airport injuring 26 people.
[3:25:19.240 --> 3:25:26.240]  Taken as a whole these unprovoked attacks present a clear threat to international peace and security.
[3:25:26.240 --> 3:25:35.240]  A blatant assault on the freedom of navigation and an unacceptable campaign of escalating tension by Iran.
[3:25:35.240 --> 3:25:41.240]  Prime Minister Abe made a trip a historic trip to arrive to ask the regime to de-escalate and enter into talks.
[3:25:41.240 --> 3:25:44.240]  Iran's Supreme Leader rejected Prime Minister Abe's deployment.
[3:25:44.240 --> 3:25:47.240]  Let's stop there. We're going to get to more of it. I've got the articles and transcript.
[3:25:47.240 --> 3:25:50.240]  He's saying everything I said an hour after I said it.
[3:25:50.240 --> 3:25:55.240]  He said it last hour because they specifically said we're going to blow ships up and do this.
[3:25:55.240 --> 3:25:59.240]  So all I'm saying is when you say you're going to do something, you get the plane.
[3:25:59.240 --> 3:26:02.240]  I'm the guy that popularized the term false flag.
[3:26:02.240 --> 3:26:06.240]  I get it could be staged. Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL deployed over there.
[3:26:06.240 --> 3:26:12.240]  The Iranians admit they blew up the Marine Corps base in Lebanon. They admit they've got sleeper cells.
[3:26:12.240 --> 3:26:16.240]  I just don't think this is your regular false flag. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Ron Paul's right.
[3:26:16.240 --> 3:26:21.240]  But regardless, Trump's taken the position through Pompeo that this has been on purpose.
[3:26:21.240 --> 3:26:25.240]  There's been a lot of attacks. I don't see false flags being this many attacks.
[3:26:25.240 --> 3:26:29.240]  Is a third party doing it? What is Matt Bracken thinking?
[3:26:29.240 --> 3:26:35.240]  This is straight up Iran. Like you, I'd be the first one to say it was a false flag attack.
[3:26:35.240 --> 3:26:39.240]  This is straight up Iran and Pompeo had a lot of the reasons.
[3:26:39.240 --> 3:26:47.240]  This is a technological and training issue. You just don't get frogmen across the Persian Gulf undetected.
[3:26:47.240 --> 3:26:49.240]  It's calm water. There's a half moon.
[3:26:49.240 --> 3:26:53.240]  Everybody's watching. Exactly. We're not putting our troops in to put mines on ships.
[3:26:53.240 --> 3:27:03.240]  Yeah, this is not a dowel. And this is not something like in Yemen where Boston Whaler zooms up to an unprepared ship.
[3:27:03.240 --> 3:27:08.240]  This is a stealthy frogman attack. That means it's state level actors.
[3:27:08.240 --> 3:27:16.240]  The only countries that could do this, and I say countries, this is not like a ragtag band of mercenaries.
[3:27:16.240 --> 3:27:20.240]  Let me stop you. You're a former frogman, so you're the perfect person to talk about this.
[3:27:20.240 --> 3:27:26.240]  But they admit frogmen teams just like the Revolutionary War putting mines on ships exactly right in the middle of all this.
[3:27:26.240 --> 3:27:31.240]  How would the U.S. or Israel do all these attacks and not get caught?
[3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:36.240]  Yeah, well, we could. We have the technology to do it.
[3:27:36.240 --> 3:27:37.240]  Submarines.
[3:27:37.240 --> 3:27:42.240]  But the our submarines, well, not only from submarines, submarines can operate very easily in the Persian Gulf.
[3:27:42.240 --> 3:27:47.240]  It's so shallow. But there are other means of inserting a swimmer delivery vehicle.
[3:27:47.240 --> 3:27:51.240]  These are little wet submersibles, meaning that that's what I meant, the little submarines.
[3:27:51.240 --> 3:27:57.240]  Yeah, they're inside of a composite fairing. So it's not like a metal hulk.
[3:27:57.240 --> 3:28:03.240]  And they are breathing scuba inside of the swimmer delivery vehicle.
[3:28:03.240 --> 3:28:06.240]  But they can get right up underneath of a ship and put mines on it.
[3:28:06.240 --> 3:28:14.240]  In this case, it looks like they also put mines above the waterline because their goal is to is to have a breach that can they can ignite.
[3:28:14.240 --> 3:28:20.240]  You know, that's harder to put out underwater would just be flowing as a pollution into the Gulf.
[3:28:20.240 --> 3:28:29.240]  So so yeah, this is a state level of actor and Occam's razor says Iran because they can insert from a mini sub straight across from Iran.
[3:28:29.240 --> 3:28:34.240]  You know, they don't need to bring a ballistic missile submarine into the Persian Gulf.
[3:28:34.240 --> 3:28:41.240]  And notice the head of operations in the Navy last week said prepare for imminent attack because obviously they probably saw him loading subs in the water.
[3:28:41.240 --> 3:28:45.240]  Let's come back and talk about all that and what this means straight ahead.
[3:28:45.240 --> 3:28:49.240]  Folks, I'm telling you, either way you slice it, we're probably going to war with Iran.

[3:32:52.240 --> 3:33:02.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:22.240 --> 3:33:31.240]  All right, Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL bestselling author, research for deployed in the Middle East, expert in a lot of this is about a shotgun.
[3:33:31.240 --> 3:33:35.240]  I want to clarify what I was saying earlier. I'm not an expert in submarine warfare, but I've said a lot of it.
[3:33:35.240 --> 3:33:43.240]  When I said the U.S. couldn't carry out something like this, obviously we have some of the best equipment in the world, compared to anybody.
[3:33:43.240 --> 3:33:56.240]  I'm saying, I don't believe Trump would do this. And I don't believe you'd have all these attacks. Missiles coming in, you know, out of areas controlled by Iran and exploding over, you know, Riyadh.
[3:33:56.240 --> 3:34:01.240]  It's got to be like 10 tankers that have been bombed or attacked now the last few months.
[3:34:01.240 --> 3:34:07.240]  And Iran saying, if you put sanctions on us, we'll do this. And then it's happening. I don't want a war.
[3:34:07.240 --> 3:34:17.240]  I'm not here saying I think Iran could be behind this to get some brownie points with the neocons. They're the ones trying to take me off air. They're horrible.
[3:34:17.240 --> 3:34:25.240]  I'm just saying Iran has their Hezbollah sleeper cells all over the world. The Democrats made a deal with them. They're working with them.
[3:34:25.240 --> 3:34:33.240]  The British government, the U.S. government protects their narcotics trafficking and sex trafficking operations in Europe and the U.S.
[3:34:33.240 --> 3:34:43.240]  That that's mainstream news. And so there's a strategic deal with the globalists in Iran, just like there was to use them against the Serbs and take over a third of their country under Bill Clinton.
[3:34:43.240 --> 3:34:52.240]  It's very sick. We've got factions in our CIA that have been working with them since 1979 and a double cross to the Shah.
[3:34:52.240 --> 3:34:59.240]  So when you read Iran responsible for blatant assault on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, Mike Pompeo says, and I played that earlier.
[3:34:59.240 --> 3:35:09.240]  They said we'll sink ships and block the Strait of Hormuz. And so this is escalating. Now, could it be Israel doing it?
[3:35:09.240 --> 3:35:22.240]  Israel staged false flags before. Could it be the Saudi Arabians doing it? Maybe? Maybe so. I just don't know why Matt Brackett's shaking his head. We'll go to him in a moment.
[3:35:22.240 --> 3:35:29.240]  I just don't know why the Iranians would shoot their mouths off like this. The reason I think it's leaning towards them.
[3:35:29.240 --> 3:35:34.240]  Everything Pompeo said, I said an hour before, because I'm doing my research. We're not just making stuff up here.
[3:35:34.240 --> 3:35:41.240]  They said they'd do it if we put the sanctions on the Revolutionary Guard. They said these exact type of attacks.
[3:35:41.240 --> 3:35:46.240]  They're running a proxy war in other areas of the Middle East, like Yemen. That's heating up.
[3:35:46.240 --> 3:35:53.240]  They won a war with Israel six, seven, eight years ago. They think they can win another one in Lebanon. They're scrapping for a non-traditional war.
[3:35:53.240 --> 3:35:59.240]  And so if they can trick Trump into attacking him and then deny that they did it, they think they'll have the moral high ground.
[3:35:59.240 --> 3:36:07.240]  Or maybe Trump backs off and takes the sanctions off. Either way, they win. I think it's a very dangerous gamble if they are the ones behind it.
[3:36:07.240 --> 3:36:15.240]  And Matt, I agree with you. My gut level, and I've got some of the folks in here that were in special operations and everything else and other stuff, they think I'm wrong.
[3:36:15.240 --> 3:36:24.240]  And they think it's a neocon trap against Trump. All I know is, do you agree, though, that this could turn into a full-scale war very quickly?
[3:36:24.240 --> 3:36:35.240]  Yes, absolutely. I go straight back to 30 years ago, 31 years ago, there was something called the Tanker War from 84, really ramped up in 87.
[3:36:35.240 --> 3:36:47.240]  And in 88, one of our ships hit a mine almost sank at one of our naval warships. And we sent enough naval and air assets in there.
[3:36:47.240 --> 3:36:53.240]  We destroyed half of their navy and crippled their ports. I mean, we really beslapped them.
[3:36:53.240 --> 3:36:56.240]  Was an Operation Praying Mantis part of that?
[3:36:56.240 --> 3:37:04.240]  That was Operation Praying Mantis, which ended the Tanker Wars. And it also forced Iran to finally conclude its war with Iraq.
[3:37:04.240 --> 3:37:14.240]  It was very definitive. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps has been feeling that sting on their face for 30 years.
[3:37:14.240 --> 3:37:19.240]  And now what they're trying to do is goad us into another Operation Praying Mantis.
[3:37:19.240 --> 3:37:26.240]  But they think that this time, they've got forces around the world to escalate to a fourth generation war.
[3:37:26.240 --> 3:37:40.240]  It's something that I don't understand how this didn't become huge news. But a few days ago or last week, in England, they found tons of prepared explosives linked to Hezbollah.
[3:37:40.240 --> 3:37:45.240]  So they're preparing for attacks abroad. And I also go back a couple years to the operation.
[3:37:45.240 --> 3:37:50.240]  Let's be clear. The government covered up a bomb factory full of plastic explosives. That's confirmed.
[3:37:50.240 --> 3:37:58.240]  Right. Plastic explosives, which is like basically the initiator and ANFO, ammonium nitrate fuel oil, which is the main charge.
[3:37:58.240 --> 3:38:00.240]  No, they're cooking up truck bombs.
[3:38:00.240 --> 3:38:12.240]  Right. Truck bombs. And I go back to the Metcalfe operation. The only way that I interpret the Metcalfe operation, that electrical power station in California attack,
[3:38:12.240 --> 3:38:23.240]  it's what's called a proof of concept operation, where some colonel, let's just say hypothetically, Iranian Revolutionary Guard coulds force,
[3:38:23.240 --> 3:38:34.240]  says, look, I can cripple America's grid. You give me a half million dollars and I'll prove to you that if you'd give me 20 million dollars, I can shut off the power in America.
[3:38:34.240 --> 3:38:39.240]  And so they do a kinetic rifle attack against the substation, very sophisticated.
[3:38:39.240 --> 3:38:41.240]  Using 30 caliber rifles.
[3:38:41.240 --> 3:38:53.240]  And also, well, any type, it doesn't even matter, but it was timed with getting into some fiber optical tunnels and doing other pretty sophisticated time on target stuff.
[3:38:53.240 --> 3:38:57.240]  And I think that the purpose of that, it wasn't like militia practicing.
[3:38:57.240 --> 3:39:03.240]  That was somebody demonstrating to the general back home, probably in Tehran.
[3:39:03.240 --> 3:39:10.240]  If you give me 20 times what I just did as a proof of concept operation, I can shut down the American power grid.
[3:39:10.240 --> 3:39:20.240]  So what they're going to try to do is, with low level attacks like these that we've seen that Pompeo outlined, they're going to go to us into an operation premanus.
[3:39:20.240 --> 3:39:30.240]  And when we, you know, attack their ship, their navy in a major way, then the truck bombs are going to go off in London and New York and power grid goes down, etc.
[3:39:30.240 --> 3:39:32.240]  No, I agree. So the threat needs to be nuclear weapons.
[3:39:32.240 --> 3:39:33.240]  They've been planning for this for 30 years.
[3:39:33.240 --> 3:39:34.240]  They've been planning this for 30.
[3:39:34.240 --> 3:39:37.240]  The threat needs to be strategic nuclear weapons on the leadership of Iran.
[3:39:37.240 --> 3:39:39.240]  They'll back off if they know we're going to nuke them.
[3:39:39.240 --> 3:39:46.240]  But I agree. We shouldn't just sit there and blow up their ships and then have them unleash their sleeper cells.
[3:39:46.240 --> 3:39:51.240]  The only action is an attack with strategic nuclear weapons.
[3:39:51.240 --> 3:39:53.240]  And then the Iranians and the Chinese might get involved in that.
[3:39:53.240 --> 3:39:55.240]  We're off to World War III.
[3:39:55.240 --> 3:40:02.240]  Yeah, the advantage that we have this time is that we have actually achieved energy independence.
[3:40:02.240 --> 3:40:12.240]  So compared to, for example, Asia and Europe, that, you know, if the Persian, if the hostrates of Hormuz are blocked, they're screwed.
[3:40:12.240 --> 3:40:13.240]  We're not.
[3:40:13.240 --> 3:40:14.240]  We'll walk through that next segment.
[3:40:14.240 --> 3:40:16.240]  We'll have you on the war room, too, because you're the expert on this.
[3:40:16.240 --> 3:40:18.240]  If you can do it, Matt, if you can't understand.
[3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:19.240]  Yeah, we'll continue.
[3:40:19.240 --> 3:40:20.240]  We'll continue.
[3:40:20.240 --> 3:40:22.240]  I'll go on there with you with Owen.
[3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:23.240]  Let's just pull back here.
[3:40:23.240 --> 3:40:25.240]  I'm not a hawk, but I do study military stuff.
[3:40:25.240 --> 3:40:27.240]  And I just know strategically, you're right.
[3:40:27.240 --> 3:40:34.240]  When people have sleeper cells, competent has below that make Al Qaeda look like choir boys, incompetent, you know, drooling idiots.
[3:40:34.240 --> 3:40:40.240]  When they've got them, they admit they haven't, and they've got all these, these, these really plans to bring down civilization.
[3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:46.240]  Then if we do go to war with them, you can't just sit there and destroy the group that's attacking the ships.
[3:40:46.240 --> 3:40:52.240]  You have to go full in war, not announce and start using, you know, atomic weapons on them.
[3:40:52.240 --> 3:40:59.240]  But as I said, I think that's the only way the Moodles will back down is if they know they're going to be decapitated in five minutes.
[3:40:59.240 --> 3:41:01.240]  And I don't want to go there either.
[3:41:01.240 --> 3:41:08.240]  So in your thoughts, is there a way to make them back down without letting them know we're going to use nuclear weapons?
[3:41:08.240 --> 3:41:10.240]  I think it's a, it's like a game of chicken.
[3:41:10.240 --> 3:41:14.240]  And, and it's like a, it's an order of magnitude escalation each time.
[3:41:14.240 --> 3:41:22.240]  I think that our, our experts are aware that they could have these sleeper cells going after our power grid, detonating truck bombs, etc.
[3:41:22.240 --> 3:41:24.240]  You know, in our city centers.
[3:41:24.240 --> 3:41:28.240]  But, but you know, there are alternative short of nukes.
[3:41:28.240 --> 3:41:35.240]  We demonstrated this with the beginning of Baghdad of operation, quote unquote, operation Iraqi freedom.
[3:41:35.240 --> 3:41:43.240]  We have these carbon, carbon chaff bombs that will shut down a power plant without destroying it.
[3:41:43.240 --> 3:41:46.240]  So it can be cleaned up and put back in operation.
[3:41:46.240 --> 3:41:49.240]  But that's not going to stop the leadership from triggering the sleeper cells.
[3:41:49.240 --> 3:41:56.240]  Only if they know all their military bases are going to get vaporized and their mountain fortress is destroyed by tactical nuclear weapons.
[3:41:56.240 --> 3:41:57.240]  Well, they step down.
[3:41:57.240 --> 3:42:02.240]  If we have a conventional war and let them activate their sleeper cells, then they could win.
[3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:04.240]  I don't know about if the nukes are necessary.
[3:42:04.240 --> 3:42:10.240]  Remember, we also have these, these, um, these deep boring bombs that, you know, that doesn't take it all out though.
[3:42:10.240 --> 3:42:17.240]  That doesn't, you might take out a mild deep base as you know, you might take out one part of it, but you don't take the whole base out with them.
[3:42:17.240 --> 3:42:18.240]  They'll have five or six instances.
[3:42:18.240 --> 3:42:19.240]  We'll never know where they're at.
[3:42:19.240 --> 3:42:28.240]  I'm just saying from a point of view of war, if you're going to go like you do with Japanese or anybody else, you drop high powered weapons on them to make sure you win.
[3:42:28.240 --> 3:42:31.240]  And that's all I'm saying is if they know we're going to nuke them, they're going to back down.
[3:42:31.240 --> 3:42:34.240]  I don't think they'll believe in it for a second that we're going to nuke them.
[3:42:34.240 --> 3:42:37.240]  I think that their, their people are saying, don't worry about the nukes.
[3:42:37.240 --> 3:42:38.240]  It's never going to happen.
[3:42:38.240 --> 3:42:40.240]  We can ride out what America does.
[3:42:40.240 --> 3:42:42.240]  That's why I'm trying to put nukes on the table.
[3:42:42.240 --> 3:42:46.240]  But you can't put nukes on the table because the Iranians have deals with the Chinese.
[3:42:46.240 --> 3:43:15.240]  Hold it right back folks. Stay with us.
[3:43:15.240 --> 3:43:19.240]  This is Nazi Germany level. This is racketeering. This is cartels.
[3:43:19.240 --> 3:43:23.240]  Mr. President, we need your help. We need it now.
[3:43:23.240 --> 3:43:25.240]  You can take on Big Tech.
[3:43:25.240 --> 3:43:34.240]  They saw Info Wars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[3:43:34.240 --> 3:43:42.240]  So they thought first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[3:43:42.240 --> 3:43:48.240]  The way to fight back is to support Info Wars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[3:43:48.240 --> 3:44:15.240]  Understand that they believe they can take us down. They'll take everybody else down.

[3:45:22.240 --> 3:45:25.240]  So we're there folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[3:45:25.240 --> 3:45:29.240]  Info Wars.com, man! Woo!
[3:45:29.240 --> 3:45:31.240]  Where are you?
[3:45:31.240 --> 3:45:34.240]  Info Wars.com, because that's what you see from out here.
[3:45:34.240 --> 3:45:38.240]  I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[3:45:38.240 --> 3:45:44.240]  We knew this censorship was coming forever. We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[3:45:44.240 --> 3:45:47.240]  Everybody can use it, reupload it, do whatever you want.
[3:45:47.240 --> 3:45:50.240]  People go to infowars.com and newswars.com, that's where they find it.
[3:45:50.240 --> 3:45:52.240]  You know, there's things called websites.
[3:45:52.240 --> 3:46:18.240]  Go there.
[3:46:18.240 --> 3:46:23.240]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now.
[3:46:23.240 --> 3:46:28.240]  And if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[3:46:28.240 --> 3:46:32.240]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[3:46:32.240 --> 3:46:38.240]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[3:46:38.240 --> 3:46:43.240]  Call it, talk radio, c-span, shout it out loud and public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[3:46:43.240 --> 3:46:46.240]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[3:46:46.240 --> 3:46:56.240]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[3:46:56.240 --> 3:47:10.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:10.240 --> 3:47:16.240]  All right, the war room is coming up in 13 minutes at infowars.com forward slash show and on some radio and TV stations to pick it up.
[3:47:16.240 --> 3:47:19.240]  We're very thankful to those stations.
[3:47:19.240 --> 3:47:21.240]  Oh, Troyard is a great job hosting it.
[3:47:21.240 --> 3:47:24.240]  Matt Bracken is going to write a shotgun for part of the show with him.
[3:47:24.240 --> 3:47:25.240]  About 15 minutes in, he'll be joining.
[3:47:25.240 --> 3:47:26.240]  I'm going to pop into.
[3:47:26.240 --> 3:47:28.240]  And we should have done this today, and I apologize.
[3:47:28.240 --> 3:47:29.240]  I'll do it tomorrow.
[3:47:29.240 --> 3:47:33.240]  We're going to open the phones up to get your take, uncensored, unfiltered.
[3:47:33.240 --> 3:47:34.240]  And I want to be clear.
[3:47:34.240 --> 3:47:39.240]  People will ask, well, wait, you're saying it could be Neocon staging it or some third party country.
[3:47:39.240 --> 3:47:47.240]  Like Saudi Arabia or you're saying, you know, Iran may have done it because they said they would a month ago.
[3:47:47.240 --> 3:47:48.240]  That's what Pompeo brought up.
[3:47:48.240 --> 3:47:50.240]  I mean, I looked at press TV.
[3:47:50.240 --> 3:47:51.240]  That's their site.
[3:47:51.240 --> 3:47:52.240]  They actually said that.
[3:47:52.240 --> 3:47:53.240]  I don't just believe CNN.
[3:47:53.240 --> 3:47:55.240]  We're just looking at all the angles.
[3:47:55.240 --> 3:48:00.240]  We don't know Iran saying, oh, you did this to embarrass the Japanese premiere.
[3:48:00.240 --> 3:48:02.240]  Well, he's here and all this.
[3:48:02.240 --> 3:48:08.240]  Ron Paul saying the Neocons could be roping Trump into a war that he's supposed to be embarrassed in.
[3:48:08.240 --> 3:48:12.240]  CIA has done that before to JFK.
[3:48:12.240 --> 3:48:14.240]  So there's a lot of pieces here.
[3:48:14.240 --> 3:48:20.240]  So when I talk about potential military actions, we're wargaming these.
[3:48:20.240 --> 3:48:22.240]  I don't want to nuke Iran.
[3:48:22.240 --> 3:48:24.240]  I don't want to have a war.
[3:48:24.240 --> 3:48:29.240]  I'm just saying studying hotspots that could trigger World War four.
[3:48:29.240 --> 3:48:32.240]  They call Cold War World War three.
[3:48:32.240 --> 3:48:38.240]  Pakistan and India is right up there at the top, Iran, Saudi Arabia, their rivalry.
[3:48:38.240 --> 3:48:40.240]  That's right there at the top.
[3:48:40.240 --> 3:48:42.240]  Miss communication with Russia.
[3:48:42.240 --> 3:48:43.240]  That's kind of down the line.
[3:48:43.240 --> 3:48:44.240]  China, South China Sea.
[3:48:44.240 --> 3:48:47.240]  That's that's up there at the top.
[3:48:47.240 --> 3:48:54.240]  I'll get Matt's taking what he thinks is right up the top as a researcher, former Navy SEAL, you know, defense researcher, smart guy.
[3:48:54.240 --> 3:49:01.240]  But let's hear from Ron Paul and his idea that this be the Neocons trying to set the president up.
[3:49:01.240 --> 3:49:02.240]  Here it is.
[3:49:02.240 --> 3:49:09.240]  The one thing interesting is this is that Abe's there and one of the ships was owned by Japan.
[3:49:09.240 --> 3:49:10.240]  Yeah.
[3:49:10.240 --> 3:49:18.240]  I mean, that just seems to be over over the top, you know, of that's more evidence why Iran.
[3:49:18.240 --> 3:49:25.240]  I mean, why would they have them there and do some talking because I think their interest is just trying to get rid of sanctions.
[3:49:25.240 --> 3:49:30.240]  And obviously Japan would like to get rid of the sanctions because they used to import a lot.
[3:49:30.240 --> 3:49:31.240]  They need that a lot.
[3:49:31.240 --> 3:49:32.240]  Yeah.
[3:49:32.240 --> 3:49:36.240]  And I would wonder if this is not a Neocon coup or move against Trump.
[3:49:36.240 --> 3:49:38.240]  If just think about a couple of things.
[3:49:38.240 --> 3:49:40.240]  So Abe's in Iran with Trump's blessing.
[3:49:40.240 --> 3:49:43.240]  Abe called Trump before he went.
[3:49:43.240 --> 3:49:44.240]  They talked about things.
[3:49:44.240 --> 3:49:46.240]  We don't know exactly what they said.
[3:49:46.240 --> 3:49:50.240]  But obviously he had Trump's blessing to go there and serve as some kind of intermediary.
[3:49:50.240 --> 3:49:53.240]  When he was there, he said, Hey, everyone, don't start.
[3:49:53.240 --> 3:49:54.240]  Don't break the agreement.
[3:49:54.240 --> 3:49:55.240]  Don't start doing nukes.
[3:49:55.240 --> 3:49:57.240]  You know, just keep keep keep it cool.
[3:49:57.240 --> 3:50:00.240]  Trump himself said, let's start negotiating.
[3:50:00.240 --> 3:50:01.240]  Let's start negotiating.
[3:50:01.240 --> 3:50:05.240]  So Trump is moving away from war, at least according to his rhetoric.
[3:50:05.240 --> 3:50:12.240]  And actually this was a little reported on, but Iran freed a U.S. resident that it was holding on espionage charges.
[3:50:12.240 --> 3:50:13.240]  That may have been a goodwill gesture.
[3:50:13.240 --> 3:50:17.240]  So things are kind of breaking loose a little bit, maybe negotiations.
[3:50:17.240 --> 3:50:19.240]  And all of a sudden, here you go.
[3:50:19.240 --> 3:50:22.240]  You know, Matt Bracken, that was this morning.
[3:50:22.240 --> 3:50:28.240]  And I'd say that makes a lot of sense that the neocons don't want Trump to have a peace deal.
[3:50:28.240 --> 3:50:31.240]  The word is they tried to sabotage the North Korean deal.
[3:50:31.240 --> 3:50:36.240]  But then Pompeo says, Hey, Iran just said they'd sink ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
[3:50:36.240 --> 3:50:43.240]  If we put these sanctions on them, and we did, and we forget we put sanctions on them because Iran has been engaged in all sorts of terrorist activities all over the planet.
[3:50:43.240 --> 3:50:45.240]  Now they've cut back since Trump got in.
[3:50:45.240 --> 3:50:46.240]  I think got a fear.
[3:50:46.240 --> 3:50:47.240]  Matt Bracken, what do you think?
[3:50:47.240 --> 3:50:48.240]  Who do you think's right?
[3:50:48.240 --> 3:50:50.240]  Pompeo or Ron Paul?
[3:50:50.240 --> 3:50:52.240]  Well, it doesn't have to be either or.
[3:50:52.240 --> 3:51:09.240]  This wouldn't be the first time that deep state opponents to a regime have stoked the fires to go to war with another country in order to damage their own leadership.
[3:51:09.240 --> 3:51:12.240]  I mean, it's not as if it's never happened before.
[3:51:12.240 --> 3:51:23.240]  And when you talk about false flags and weaponizing the intelligence services, this is one of the worst effects of this is a complete lack of faith and confidence.
[3:51:23.240 --> 3:51:30.240]  After the Iraq WMD debacle, Brennan was involved in that also.
[3:51:30.240 --> 3:51:34.240]  Yeah, if our country's really under attack, we've been lied to so much, we don't even know it's true anymore.
[3:51:34.240 --> 3:51:37.240]  It's the old boy who cried wolf.
[3:51:37.240 --> 3:51:51.240]  You keep telling lies and in terms of frogman attacks, I'd like to quickly mention two parallels or two precedents in the Gulf of Tonkin incident that got us into Vietnam officially.
[3:51:51.240 --> 3:52:02.240]  What was really going on was our Navy was escorting patrol boats up to the north to put over demolition, like frogman attacks, seal type attacks.
[3:52:02.240 --> 3:52:12.240]  The South Vietnamese Arvins, but the covering force of the destroyers, the North Vietnamese were getting wise to it.
[3:52:12.240 --> 3:52:19.240]  They were aware of these frogman attacks coming over the beach and they went out to engage our destroyers.
[3:52:19.240 --> 3:52:24.240]  We were like, oh mercy, get me my smelling salts, we've been attacked.
[3:52:24.240 --> 3:52:29.240]  We've been dropping off frogmen and saboteurs all along.
[3:52:29.240 --> 3:52:36.240]  We were trying to goad them into doing something that then we could use as a Cassus bella, I think that's how you pronounce it.
[3:52:36.240 --> 3:52:47.240]  But another one, and this is much less known, in 1983, the Nicaraguan port of Corinto in the Pacific, we were involved with the Contras then.
[3:52:47.240 --> 3:52:53.240]  We actually had American frogmen, seals, do a demolition raid.
[3:52:53.240 --> 3:52:56.240]  They were supposed to train Nicaraguans, and here's the parallel.
[3:52:56.240 --> 3:53:06.240]  They were supposed to train Nicaraguans to go in on a cigarette boat and then go ashore with demolition packs and blow up oil tanks, fuel farms.
[3:53:06.240 --> 3:53:08.240]  But they couldn't train the Nicaraguans.
[3:53:08.240 --> 3:53:12.240]  You just can't say, that's why I laugh when you said maybe the Saudis did this attack.
[3:53:12.240 --> 3:53:18.240]  You just can't take a bunch of knuckleheads and turn them into frogmen in a short period of time.
[3:53:18.240 --> 3:53:27.240]  So in the Corinto raid, it actually wound up being Americans, and it's funny, they hadn't accounted correctly for the very high tide range.
[3:53:27.240 --> 3:53:29.240]  Their cigarette boat went aground.
[3:53:29.240 --> 3:53:37.240]  So when the bombs are going off at dawn, they're still on a mud flat, getting rid of all any evidence that they were Americans.
[3:53:37.240 --> 3:53:39.240]  Of course, if they're captured, it's going to look pretty bad.
[3:53:39.240 --> 3:53:44.240]  There are two American frogmen, sheaped up to Washington, sitting there in a cigarette boat.
[3:53:44.240 --> 3:53:48.240]  They did get off the mud flat and got away, so it's just like a funny story now.
[3:53:48.240 --> 3:53:55.240]  But this is the kind of thing that in the Gulf situation today, there's no way that you just get some knuckleheads and do this.
[3:53:55.240 --> 3:54:03.240]  These would be very well trained career professional, could force equivalent to SEALs doing this kind of operation.
[3:54:03.240 --> 3:54:04.240]  No question about it.
[3:54:04.240 --> 3:54:09.240]  And isn't Iran one of the only Islamic countries that actually has the skill to have these type of forces?
[3:54:09.240 --> 3:54:11.240]  Absolutely, definitely.
[3:54:11.240 --> 3:54:14.240]  And they're not Arabs, first of all.
[3:54:14.240 --> 3:54:17.240]  They're ethnically not Arabs.
[3:54:17.240 --> 3:54:22.240]  The Saudis have a hard time manning fighter planes that can fly at night.
[3:54:22.240 --> 3:54:27.240]  They're not the healthiest population in terms, if you were looking for...
[3:54:27.240 --> 3:54:29.240]  Let's talk about this, because I talk to the family of the military and they say,
[3:54:29.240 --> 3:54:33.240]  I find Iran's totally different than when you fight the Muslims or the Arab Muslims,
[3:54:33.240 --> 3:54:37.240]  which we're not saying are cowards, but there's just something kind of, I don't even say stupid,
[3:54:37.240 --> 3:54:45.240]  but it's a little bit different ball of wax than fighting, say, Russians or Iranians or Japanese or anybody else.
[3:54:45.240 --> 3:54:48.240]  So what's the deal with Arabs?
[3:54:48.240 --> 3:54:52.240]  Maybe it's a thousand years of inbreeding, though, some would say.
[3:54:52.240 --> 3:55:00.240]  But the Persians seem to have a healthier stock, but also more results-oriented.
[3:55:00.240 --> 3:55:07.240]  If you, in less nepotism, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, you have to know somebody to become an F-15 pilot.
[3:55:07.240 --> 3:55:13.240]  You might be like a Don Knot.
[3:55:13.240 --> 3:55:20.240]  Sure, you got 10,000 princes and they're all fighter pilots and they do one Saudi and they all get $10 million bonus.
[3:55:20.240 --> 3:55:24.240]  And they can't fly at night because they fly into the ground every time.
[3:55:24.240 --> 3:55:28.240]  And they think they have a little bit more of a military tradition in Iran.
[3:55:28.240 --> 3:55:36.240]  Now, I think what's going on is they're trying to goad us into escalating with a big military response,
[3:55:36.240 --> 3:55:43.240]  and then they're going to attack us fourth generation with going against power grid.
[3:55:43.240 --> 3:55:45.240]  Who knows? I mean, with this thing in Congo-
[3:55:45.240 --> 3:55:46.240]  You're going to walk through it all.
[3:55:46.240 --> 3:55:47.240]  You're going to walk through it all.
[3:55:47.240 --> 3:55:50.240]  We're out of time on the war room coming up in like three minutes.
[3:55:50.240 --> 3:55:58.240]  Infowars.com, newswars.com has links to it, local radio stations folks.
[3:55:58.240 --> 3:56:03.240]  We're going to break it down from A to Z in all the clips and your phone calls.
[3:56:03.240 --> 3:56:10.240]  Matt's going to talk about 30 minutes with Owen and then they're going to take several hours of phone calls on this.
[3:56:10.240 --> 3:56:14.240]  I intend on popping in as I develop more news and information on this front.
[3:56:14.240 --> 3:56:25.240]  Some other areas I didn't get into. Denver City Council has elected a woman who says that she wants a violent communist overthrow of the U.S.
[3:56:25.240 --> 3:56:26.240]  We've got all of that.
[3:56:26.240 --> 3:56:27.240]  Any means necessary.
[3:56:27.240 --> 3:56:30.240]  So that shows where all this is going.
[3:56:30.240 --> 3:56:31.240]  That is next hour.
[3:56:31.240 --> 3:56:33.240]  Please don't forget.
[3:56:33.240 --> 3:56:35.240]  We sold out of it in a month.
[3:56:35.240 --> 3:56:39.240]  People were blown away that we have the highest quality medical bottleman.
[3:56:39.240 --> 3:56:44.240]  Secret 12 is great. This is twice as strong, way better.
[3:56:44.240 --> 3:56:46.240]  I ordered a huge shipment.
[3:56:46.240 --> 3:56:47.240]  We've got a great U.S. company.
[3:56:47.240 --> 3:56:48.240]  You can turn it right around.
[3:56:48.240 --> 3:56:49.240]  It came back in.
[3:56:49.240 --> 3:56:57.240]  I ordered double the amount and I'm going to offer you a free bottle, a free bottle at Infowars.com of Ultra 12.
[3:56:57.240 --> 3:57:12.240]  When you get the introductory 50% off 8-pack power stack that is a month's supply of morning and evening, four new formulas, 13 great capsules.
[3:57:12.240 --> 3:57:14.240]  You've got to read about these formulas.
[3:57:14.240 --> 3:57:19.240]  This is the best daily regimen product out there.
[3:57:19.240 --> 3:57:24.240]  No one we know puts this much product into one of these daily regimen type packs.
[3:57:24.240 --> 3:57:30.240]  But your 8-pack power stack, our newest product, for 50% off, you get a free bottle of Ultra 12.
[3:57:30.240 --> 3:57:35.240]  So you can see about clean, healthy energy from V12, not from some stimulant.
[3:57:35.240 --> 3:57:37.240]  Infowarsstore.com, thanks for the support.
[3:57:37.240 --> 3:58:02.240]  Four room coming up right now.
[3:58:02.240 --> 3:58:26.240]  Five different types of caffeine, pleasant as a crush.
[3:58:26.240 --> 3:58:43.240]  And get the fish oil.
[3:58:43.240 --> 3:58:49.240]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block.
[3:58:49.240 --> 3:59:01.240]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[3:59:01.240 --> 3:59:10.240]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[3:59:10.240 --> 3:59:21.240]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
