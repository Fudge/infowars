[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:38.020]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.020 --> 00:45.420]  we're live my friends it is Monday the 10th day of January 2011 we're gonna be
[00:45.420 --> 00:49.180]  live here for the next three hours coming up in the last hour we have
[00:49.180 --> 00:53.980]  several special guests joining us including Larry Pratt the head of gun
[00:53.980 --> 01:00.580]  owners of America he will be joining us I don't know where to begin where to
[01:00.580 --> 01:05.740]  start while the world economy continues to collapse as the dollar continues to be
[01:05.740 --> 01:10.860]  devalued as governments like Russia and China and the EU and the Arabs in the
[01:10.860 --> 01:16.220]  Middle East all move away from the dollar as the police state unfolds as the
[01:16.220 --> 01:23.060]  TSA rolls out on the streets all we're hearing about is Saturday's tragedy the
[01:23.060 --> 01:27.620]  six dead the others wounded the poor little nine-year-old girl and it's very
[01:27.620 --> 01:32.300]  hard to listen to but we're gonna play it coming up the father Mr. Green John
[01:32.300 --> 01:38.740]  Green of the little girl who was killed has come out and said look we saw the
[01:38.740 --> 01:43.340]  police state with the TSA after 9-11 and we're hearing all these calls to take
[01:43.340 --> 01:47.300]  our liberties we don't need any more restrictions and what does the
[01:47.300 --> 01:53.700]  authoritarian criminal group posing as the left do they rampage forward
[01:53.700 --> 01:58.060]  demanding that guns be restricted and that free speech be absolutely eviscerate
[01:58.060 --> 02:02.620]  I mean amazing legislation being introduced I have all the quotes from
[02:02.620 --> 02:07.660]  the Congress people here they say that anything seen as intimidating anything
[02:07.660 --> 02:13.220]  that angers a congressperson any crosshairs over a district you are going
[02:13.220 --> 02:19.340]  to go to prison the end of free speech in America and then there's the bigger
[02:19.340 --> 02:27.140]  lie that this guy was a iron ran conservative with no evidence what we
[02:27.140 --> 02:31.900]  do have evidence from all of his classmates just unbelievable amounts of
[02:31.900 --> 02:36.780]  emails and documentation was that he was someone who thought that he wanted to
[02:36.780 --> 02:41.660]  be a woman that he was a long-haired pot smoker not saying pot smokers are
[02:41.660 --> 02:46.520]  inherently bad but Harris Clybold this guy the Pentagon shooter it is a
[02:46.520 --> 02:50.580]  psychotropic and can in major studies since schizophrenics over the deep end
[02:50.580 --> 02:54.380]  that's admitted I mean it can have good effects for people it's got some health
[02:54.380 --> 02:57.260]  effects that are positive it's also got some that are negative depending on the
[02:57.260 --> 03:02.820]  individual it isn't the psychotropic classing and but expanding on that he
[03:02.820 --> 03:09.020]  had of course a satanic shrine a voodoo shrine the skull with the oranges that's
[03:09.020 --> 03:18.860]  what that is the police have properly assessed exactly what that is and so you
[03:18.860 --> 03:23.020]  got a guy who likes the communist manifesto it was called very liberal by
[03:23.020 --> 03:28.500]  his friends and that's all over the news today and what it looks like is this guy
[03:28.500 --> 03:32.940]  had multiple personalities whether it was naturally occurring via some type of
[03:32.940 --> 03:38.860]  brain disorder or chemical problem or whether it was mind control which again
[03:38.860 --> 03:44.620]  artificially simulates naturally occurring mental illness he sure fits the
[03:44.620 --> 03:48.180]  bill I mean he's a guy who likes to dress up like the grim reaper and thinks
[03:48.180 --> 03:53.900]  he's a powerful vampire devil master he's a guy who thinks he's a woman he's
[03:53.900 --> 03:58.540]  a guy who's hanging out and going and visiting with the congresswoman he now
[03:58.540 --> 04:01.980]  I said this last night before the devil worship stuff came out I said this guy's
[04:01.980 --> 04:07.540]  a devil worshipping vampire want to be it's very popular you see these young
[04:07.540 --> 04:13.700]  punks usually got you know middle-class parents their spoil brats they can't get
[04:13.700 --> 04:17.100]  a date of their life depends on it you see them running around Austin bugging
[04:17.100 --> 04:20.700]  their eyes out trying to look crazy and I mean it's one of the few groups that I
[04:20.700 --> 04:24.780]  just gravitate towards I want to punch in the nose I mean I see some crazed
[04:24.780 --> 04:30.940]  weak punk but again there they don't want to gang up on you know 10 to 1 one
[04:30.940 --> 04:35.740]  time I was with Tommy Pallotta coming out of a restaurant there about 10 of
[04:35.740 --> 04:39.340]  these wraiths and they said something smart mouth to me and I'm not a tough
[04:39.340 --> 04:42.900]  guy but they were just so evil looking they think the devil so powerful I said
[04:42.900 --> 04:47.980]  all ten of you come on right now I'm gonna stomp your guts out let's go right
[04:47.980 --> 04:51.780]  now I shouldn't be telling that story but these people I sense them I see them
[04:51.780 --> 04:56.220]  and I called it last night devil worshipping coming we'll be right back
[04:56.220 --> 05:02.780]  stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[05:02.780 --> 05:07.020]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[05:07.020 --> 05:11.220]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[05:11.220 --> 05:15.100]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[05:15.100 --> 05:18.780]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[05:18.780 --> 05:23.340]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[05:23.340 --> 05:27.380]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.380 --> 05:31.140]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.140 --> 05:34.780]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:34.780 --> 05:39.140]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:39.140 --> 05:42.260]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[08:12.260 --> 08:19.540]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.540 --> 08:27.740]  Alex Jones all right I have been non-stop researching all of the
[08:27.740 --> 08:34.060]  intelligence out there since I got word of this shooting I visited info wars
[08:34.060 --> 08:42.820]  dot com in the morning or to just become afternoon on Saturday and I noticed
[08:42.820 --> 08:48.100]  that Aaron Dykes was on call for updating Saturday and I saw the ABC news
[08:48.100 --> 08:53.300]  article he linked to dealing with all the shootings there at the grocery store
[08:53.300 --> 08:58.700]  in Tucson and they were reporting at the time the Congresswoman was dead because
[08:58.700 --> 09:06.020]  they thought she was dead that was a false report and we immediately launched
[09:06.020 --> 09:10.940]  into researching this coming up in about an hour and 20 minutes from now
[09:10.940 --> 09:17.260]  sheriff Richard Mack is going to be joining us this federal judge that was
[09:17.260 --> 09:25.020]  killed is a great guy he's the fellow that ruled against Clinton in the
[09:25.020 --> 09:31.580]  sheriff Richard Mack gun control victim disarmament case and I also have
[09:31.580 --> 09:38.020]  intelligence that I've been going over and vetting but it it's bonafide that
[09:38.020 --> 09:43.340]  the judge was ruling in a key case against the Obama administration in a
[09:43.340 --> 09:52.140]  move to seize homes and people's bank accounts without due process and this
[09:52.140 --> 09:56.300]  integrates them with other rulings foreclosure lawsuit upset court rules
[09:56.300 --> 10:04.700]  against Wells Fargo and US Bank Corp being able to just seize homes without
[10:04.700 --> 10:11.340]  the proper deed so I have to tell you and folks I don't just come at this
[10:11.340 --> 10:15.340]  because I want it to be a government operation deep down I wish that it was
[10:15.340 --> 10:19.820]  just a real nut doing this but we know that he had been recommended for
[10:19.820 --> 10:23.220]  psychiatric care and kicked out of college we know he'd been calling for
[10:23.220 --> 10:28.700]  violence we know he was protected it fits the exact MO of a liberal area just
[10:28.700 --> 10:34.500]  like Columbine Colorado this was a liberal enclave in Tucson this sheriff
[10:34.500 --> 10:41.180]  is a serious political socialistic operative attacking the first amendment
[10:41.180 --> 10:48.460]  and the second amendment instantaneously this Clarence DuPnik who Mack knows as
[10:48.460 --> 10:55.380]  well Sheriff Mack will be joining us coming up to deal with this Richard
[10:55.380 --> 11:00.620]  Mack former sheriff of Graham County Arizona he knows all the players and
[11:00.620 --> 11:06.260]  94 he filed lawsuit challenging the Brady bill ruled on by John in role the judge
[11:06.260 --> 11:13.740]  that was murdered you know this is payback by the globalist this Giffords
[11:13.740 --> 11:19.260]  Congresswoman was staunchly pro-second amendment staunchly pro-border control
[11:19.260 --> 11:27.460]  and a person described as a pothead extreme liberal I mean he fit the
[11:27.460 --> 11:31.420]  pedigree you know the the volunteering at the animal shelter the whole nine
[11:31.420 --> 11:35.140]  yards not that that's bad but that's you know the hardcore you know kind of
[11:35.140 --> 11:40.580]  liberal religion is to volunteer at the animal shelter he had the devil skull
[11:40.580 --> 11:46.580]  the oranges around it the voodoo or black magic version of san aria he
[11:46.580 --> 11:51.060]  wanted to be a woman he dressed up like a grim reaper playing death death metal
[11:51.060 --> 11:57.540]  music about shooting people and bodies hitting the floor that's why I said last
[11:57.540 --> 12:03.260]  night before his satanic shrine was found in his parents backyard they let
[12:03.260 --> 12:11.420]  this go on that he was clearly a satanist I've dealt with this too long
[12:11.420 --> 12:16.620]  that's who I've been physically attacked by one time was trench coat wearing
[12:16.620 --> 12:21.220]  hooded satanist another time a trench coat wearing hooded satanist appeared at
[12:21.220 --> 12:26.380]  the bookstore signing and I had undercover police there with guns they
[12:26.380 --> 12:30.500]  were right behind him but he did sort of pulling out his hand like simulating
[12:30.500 --> 12:34.380]  killing me kind of a psychological counting coup same MO the point is I've
[12:34.380 --> 12:40.300]  dealt with these people repeatedly this is who's always after liberty and it's
[12:40.300 --> 12:45.980]  Harrison Clybold into satanism Ritalin Prozac making videos at the school about
[12:45.980 --> 12:50.420]  killing people the sheriff meeting with the police chief while it happened the
[12:50.420 --> 12:54.900]  school more than half empty reports of other shooters inside I have seen this
[12:54.900 --> 12:58.940]  over and over again why aren't they really seeing the surveillance videos of
[12:58.940 --> 13:05.100]  this you know took them years with Columbine this whole thing has hundreds
[13:05.100 --> 13:09.380]  and hundreds and hundreds of points and then we have the 77 hearings about
[13:09.380 --> 13:13.700]  mind control assassins we have the London Guardian we have Reuters it we
[13:13.700 --> 13:18.660]  have the LA County medical examiner saying that he'd been shot by another
[13:18.660 --> 13:25.740]  caliber handgun RFK behind the head we have the witnesses with sir hand sir
[13:25.740 --> 13:31.140]  hand being drugged we have the local skunk works operation nearby with the
[13:31.140 --> 13:36.780]  known CI asset holding the trigger that's all mainstream news now decades and
[13:36.780 --> 13:42.460]  decades and decades later we have the mark David Chapman we have the John
[13:42.460 --> 13:47.260]  Hinckley junior we've got him meeting with Marvin Bush and others the day
[13:47.260 --> 13:51.580]  before his dad the head of world vision where where we've had confirmed
[13:51.580 --> 13:57.660]  documents come out overseas they use these missionary camps is as mind
[13:57.660 --> 14:05.540]  control training covers it goes on and on and on and then we talked to sheriff
[14:05.540 --> 14:10.380]  Mack this morning and it just completely blew me away I looked into this
[14:10.380 --> 14:15.300]  that's why we called him I looked into this federal judge and he's one of the
[14:15.300 --> 14:21.060]  best in the country and they they blew him away and they sent our ringwraith to
[14:21.060 --> 14:27.380]  do it a cowardly creature a real red-blooded god-fearing man could take
[14:27.380 --> 14:32.540]  on probably a hundred of these venomous little little effeminate wraiths but
[14:32.540 --> 14:39.500]  with a firearm he just reaped incredible havoc and these people are all
[14:39.500 --> 14:43.180]  over Austin I'm not saying everybody that's into being vampy or wearing
[14:43.180 --> 14:47.020]  black is he's a devil worship or an evil but I see the crazed young males
[14:47.020 --> 14:50.900]  going around intimidating old ladies and grocery stores and I just want to knock
[14:50.900 --> 14:54.980]  their teeth out every time I see them because I see somebody who's trying to
[14:54.980 --> 15:00.540]  act menacing trying to be into evil I want to go after them I mean I'll just
[15:00.540 --> 15:04.220]  be honest with you these people know how to punch my buttons because I have a
[15:04.220 --> 15:09.260]  family I have children and people who want only are seeking after evil
[15:09.260 --> 15:14.500]  wanting Lee trying to turn themselves over to it that's the ultimate sin I
[15:14.500 --> 15:22.900]  am just at a spiritual level totally set against them and the Soviets were
[15:22.900 --> 15:27.140]  wantonly turned over to this the Nazis were turned over to it the Maoists were
[15:27.140 --> 15:30.500]  turned over to it and I can look at the federal government and all of its
[15:30.500 --> 15:35.700]  trappings I can tell it's turned over to it when I see premeditated conscious
[15:35.700 --> 15:43.780]  evil I get angry now we need to take our country back at the city the county the
[15:43.780 --> 15:48.780]  state level and it's going to be strong truthful rhetoric about the new world
[15:48.780 --> 15:51.860]  order and about the issues that the globalist are bringing into our society
[15:51.860 --> 15:58.580]  that is going to turn the tide against these people if we had some hit Larry and
[15:58.580 --> 16:03.820]  dictator perhaps if they were removed forcibly we could fix our society but
[16:03.820 --> 16:08.020]  more often than not you get something even worse than when that happens this
[16:08.020 --> 16:12.860]  is a society where we individually have become corrupt and decadent and evil and
[16:12.860 --> 16:16.700]  turned loose of our government and allow government to get out of control and
[16:16.700 --> 16:20.860]  allowed corrupt groups to get control of government violence is not the answer
[16:20.860 --> 16:25.780]  and I've always taught that first they ignore you then they laugh at you then
[16:25.780 --> 16:29.980]  they attack you then you win and there is no doubt we can fix this piece of
[16:29.980 --> 16:34.100]  lead but just as Robert Shapiro and countless other Obama's advisors have
[16:34.100 --> 16:40.380]  said in the news the last year they need an Oklahoma City or 9-11 event to make
[16:40.380 --> 16:44.660]  the government look like victims so that they can get the public support and get
[16:44.660 --> 16:48.340]  the moral high ground they're so arrogant they admit this and they've been
[16:48.340 --> 16:52.380]  gearing everybody up and they're getting the underwear bomber on the plane and
[16:52.380 --> 16:56.740]  protecting them they're protecting major Hassan that's come out I mean all of
[16:56.740 --> 17:02.460]  this they're protecting any type of lunatic crazy or mind control person
[17:02.460 --> 17:08.100]  they can now whether this guy was under mind control or not and it's simple they
[17:08.100 --> 17:11.940]  grab you they shock therapy you they erase your memory they pump you full of
[17:11.940 --> 17:16.780]  drugs they pump you full of compulsions they torture you under hypnosis and then
[17:16.780 --> 17:22.340]  simulate that when you shoot this woman when you shoot this judge when you shoot
[17:22.340 --> 17:30.060]  these people you will have the pain it will go away the fear will go away that's
[17:30.060 --> 17:36.420]  one of the most standard Manchurian you know North Korean style systems perfected
[17:36.420 --> 17:41.500]  back in the 70s by the US government been doing it since the 40s that's just
[17:41.500 --> 17:45.100]  the low-tech way and that's the one they usually use they get somebody who's
[17:45.100 --> 17:49.260]  already kind of skit so already screwed up they fracture their brain up a lot of

[24:16.300 --> 24:21.940]  okay we can learn a lot from what's happened when you have Sheriff Richard
[24:21.940 --> 24:26.060]  Mack who was a sheriff in that area of Arizona he's got a lot of really deep
[24:26.060 --> 24:31.060]  intelligence and information for us on what's really happening and by the
[24:31.060 --> 24:37.020]  minute as we learn more it bottom line they knew he was gonna attack and they
[24:37.020 --> 24:42.980]  let him at the bare minimum they're keeping it very quiet about what's in all
[24:42.980 --> 24:46.300]  the letters and stuff that they got and the sheriff I've been watching him on
[24:46.300 --> 24:50.300]  television the one demonizing the Second Amendment in free speech he does not
[24:50.300 --> 24:54.580]  want to talk about what's in him only that he keeps trying to blame
[24:54.580 --> 24:59.020]  conservatives and then when confronted on Fox News he said he has no evidence
[24:59.020 --> 25:04.500]  he's just giving his opinion and he got all these calls to end the First
[25:04.500 --> 25:08.220]  Amendment all these calls to go after the Second Amendment to register all
[25:08.220 --> 25:12.980]  firearms in border states that's new American magazine today the
[25:12.980 --> 25:21.260]  legislation's being introduced but let's talk about what we do know in the
[25:21.260 --> 25:25.100]  first hour before we knew anything I got on the phone there in Dyches we wrote a
[25:25.100 --> 25:30.500]  story together where we said it could be a pro-abortion I'm an anti-abortion
[25:30.500 --> 25:34.860]  activist but then I looked up that the Congresswoman wasn't really pro-abortion
[25:34.860 --> 25:37.500]  so I said that's probably not it because they're one of the few groups that
[25:37.500 --> 25:41.780]  actually is grassroots that's conservative that will kill people we just
[25:41.780 --> 25:46.740]  assessed in the past who's done things and you learn a lot from that I said it
[25:46.740 --> 25:52.540]  could be a little reconquista because she's doesn't want open borders and it's
[25:52.540 --> 25:56.900]  been in the news in Mexico in the US that there are bounties on sheriffs and
[25:56.900 --> 26:02.100]  members of the legislature's heads in Arizona and Texas as well as in Mexico
[26:02.100 --> 26:07.140]  and California but I went on to say or it could be some kind of trench coat
[26:07.140 --> 26:15.380]  mafia type group or it could just be a complete schizophrenic nutcase or it could
[26:15.380 --> 26:20.180]  be a mind control operation and we're still not completely sure but what this
[26:20.180 --> 26:24.780]  is what we know we've watched all those YouTube videos we've read as my space his
[26:24.780 --> 26:30.260]  Facebook all of it and what we know is this is a guy who had multiple
[26:30.260 --> 26:34.020]  personalities if anybody ever did he thought he was a woman with one
[26:34.020 --> 26:37.660]  personality people described as being different every day he thought he was a
[26:37.660 --> 26:42.140]  black magic warlock carrying out voodoo ceremonies with the skull and the
[26:42.140 --> 26:51.740]  oranges and the candles that's what that is he was a big marijuana rights type
[26:51.740 --> 26:57.840]  guy he was a big animal rights type person he was into the communist
[26:57.840 --> 27:05.220]  manifesto now obviously he's out of his gourd whether it's artificial or not so
[27:05.220 --> 27:12.380]  it's not a hundred percent fair to say that this is because he's a abortion
[27:12.380 --> 27:18.260]  supporting devil-loving communist admirer who also likes to dress up like a
[27:18.260 --> 27:25.460]  woman but ladies and gentlemen that sure is the opposite of what you'd call a
[27:25.460 --> 27:29.100]  tea party conservative have you ever thought of a tea party conservative
[27:29.100 --> 27:32.660]  dressing up like the grim reaper and burning American flags while playing
[27:32.660 --> 27:37.100]  very sadistic what's the body's at the ground what's the body's at the ground I
[27:37.100 --> 27:43.460]  mean stuff that you know adolescents get into to feel powerful I mean do you
[27:43.460 --> 27:47.140]  think that's what you think of as a tea party type person who thinks they're a
[27:47.140 --> 27:53.100]  woman one day of the week a devil worshipping Darth Sidious another day
[27:53.100 --> 28:00.420]  of the week described by classmates at two different colleges as a super liberal
[28:00.420 --> 28:05.340]  extremely liberal very liberal those are all quotes super liberal extremely
[28:05.340 --> 28:11.020]  liberal very liberal does that stop the London Guardian Huffington Post does
[28:11.020 --> 28:17.340]  that stop Politico does that stop CNN or MSNBC does that stop any of them from
[28:17.340 --> 28:26.500]  blaming and ran I ran I played that clip on the Sunday show yesterday I ran no
[28:26.500 --> 28:29.900]  mention anywhere of David Ike we've checked but because he talked about
[28:29.900 --> 28:34.700]  conscious dreaming they said it's David Ike's fault and called him a right
[28:34.700 --> 28:38.620]  winger if you've got to use a left right paradigm term I would not call David a
[28:38.620 --> 28:42.300]  left-winger I mean a right-winger I'd call him a left-wing kind of new age
[28:42.300 --> 28:47.740]  person though that's not really a fair label but but the bigger issue is why
[28:47.740 --> 28:51.940]  every time there's a tragedy do these people exploit it despite the fact that
[28:51.940 --> 28:56.940]  the father of this poor dead little girl is out there begging them not to
[28:56.940 --> 29:01.180]  exploit this to hurt liberty I mean I mean I have to hand for this father two
[29:01.180 --> 29:04.580]  days into this I would be in such grief with my daughters and one of my daughters
[29:04.580 --> 29:12.700]  have been gunned down I would be in such abject grief off the chart and he is
[29:12.700 --> 29:16.660]  crying in the interview that I wouldn't be able to come on the air and defend
[29:16.660 --> 29:20.420]  liberty and freedom I would just I don't know what state I'd be in this guy came
[29:20.420 --> 29:26.460]  out and said look I travel a lot look at all the liberties we lost flying what

[35:13.740 --> 35:17.900]  because they can't respond to everything they can't protect you they are there
[35:17.900 --> 35:22.180]  after a crime is committed to then bring you to justice to bring you to the
[35:22.180 --> 35:27.980]  grand jury all right now continuing this is very important they're claiming that
[35:27.980 --> 35:32.580]  Sarah Palin by putting crosshairs over that district saying target this
[35:32.580 --> 35:38.540]  district to defeat these Democrats somehow cause this and they want to use
[35:38.540 --> 35:45.460]  her as a beta test to go after free speech in this country ah but here's
[35:45.460 --> 35:49.060]  the Wall Street Journal I'm gonna show folks a document cam of this if they're
[35:49.060 --> 35:55.100]  watching on prison planet dog TV Obama if they bring a knife to a fight we bring
[35:55.100 --> 36:03.740]  a gun I mean I constantly hear this type of rhetoric and clearly it's an
[36:03.740 --> 36:11.940]  analogy to upping the political firepower in a political debate when I
[36:11.940 --> 36:17.100]  say info war that means information fight to get the truth out when they
[36:17.100 --> 36:22.020]  say if they bring a knife we bring a gun clearly Obama doesn't deserve to be
[36:22.020 --> 36:27.860]  arrested for saying that but that is much more extreme than Sarah Palin
[36:27.860 --> 36:32.340]  putting crosshairs on a map over districts now continuing here's
[36:32.340 --> 36:39.180]  world net daily look who else put bullseye on Giffords district leftist blog
[36:39.180 --> 36:46.900]  points finger at Palin while scrubbing dead to me rant and they go on to say my
[36:46.900 --> 36:52.900]  congresswoman voted against Nancy Pelosi and is now dead to me I am from
[36:52.900 --> 36:59.740]  Tucson area and I live in Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords district I work like
[36:59.740 --> 37:03.580]  a dog for her elections when she was in the Arizona house surrounded by a
[37:03.580 --> 37:10.060]  right-wing nutcases when Arizona redistricted an O2 a seat bound up she
[37:10.060 --> 37:14.060]  was right smack in the middle of it and they go on to say that she's not been
[37:14.060 --> 37:19.020]  liberal she's been pro-gun and wants to control the border and so she's now dead
[37:19.020 --> 37:27.740]  to me and that I bet you my bottom dollar as more documents come out as we
[37:27.740 --> 37:31.300]  learn more or they'll probably try to suppress them or cherry picket we're
[37:31.300 --> 37:35.460]  gonna learn that this lunatic went down there and gunned her down who we've
[37:35.460 --> 37:40.500]  heard now he's had arguments with over the fact of open borders which she
[37:40.500 --> 37:46.620]  resisted and but again he's clearly out of his mind he likes communist he likes
[37:46.620 --> 37:54.140]  Hitler he likes white supremacist he's into all this stuff but the overriding
[37:54.140 --> 37:58.780]  issue is the people that knew him said he was extremely left-wing so it's not
[37:58.780 --> 38:05.060]  fair to come out and try to attack the First Amendment and say that
[38:05.060 --> 38:09.540]  conservatives libertarians people like Ron Paul caused this to happen with our
[38:09.540 --> 38:13.300]  heated rhetoric our country's going into a depression offshore banks have stolen
[38:13.300 --> 38:17.300]  trillions of dollars we've got all these illegal wars going on whether you
[38:17.300 --> 38:22.260]  call yourself left right libertarian patriotic constitutionalist anarchist
[38:22.260 --> 38:26.540]  whatever you have a right to say you're sick of the government you want it off
[38:26.540 --> 38:30.660]  our back it's the biggest government in history it's the most out of control
[38:30.660 --> 38:36.060]  government in history we're going bankrupt here and now there's all these
[38:36.060 --> 38:39.220]  Republican senators and others saying we've got to lower the rhetoric that's
[38:39.220 --> 38:44.060]  right yes we've all got a bipartisan agree not to criticize each other
[38:44.060 --> 38:47.660]  ladies and gentlemen you go back 200 years ago people were routinely getting
[38:47.660 --> 38:53.980]  in fist fights on the Congress floor freedom is a dirty business and you
[38:53.980 --> 39:00.180]  know what an armed society is a polite society as well but you look at Mexico
[39:00.180 --> 39:05.580]  where they've had now upwards of 30,000 deaths it's way over 28,000 now many of
[39:05.580 --> 39:11.820]  them police mayors you name it the highest number of quote public servants
[39:11.820 --> 39:14.420]  being killed in the world Aaron Dykes for an article about it Saturday and
[39:14.420 --> 39:17.940]  linked to the our government's own statistics they have a total gun ban
[39:17.940 --> 39:21.740]  for their citizens and so when they sit here and tell you that you've got to
[39:21.740 --> 39:26.460]  give up all of your second amendment and your free speech because your free
[39:26.460 --> 39:31.460]  speech and your second amendment caused this they're saying America and liberty
[39:31.460 --> 39:35.980]  and freedom caused it and that it's bad and when po-talk of the Southern Slime
[39:35.980 --> 39:42.060]  Center gets up on television and blames Ein Rand and David Ike and says people
[39:42.060 --> 39:46.700]  that are into gold and silver when this schizophrenic made a couple comments
[39:46.700 --> 39:51.340]  about if I say I have a currency that I am the treasurer and they repeated it
[39:51.340 --> 39:57.180]  over and over again so now if somebody commits a crime and they're into
[39:57.180 --> 40:01.100]  gardening does that mean gardening is bad I mean this is the message that you
[40:01.100 --> 40:05.260]  better sit down shut up and do what the government says and hand over your
[40:05.260 --> 40:09.180]  dollars and let them raise your taxes and let them control your life and turn
[40:09.180 --> 40:13.180]  your guns in while the government masses all this paramilitary force against us
[40:13.180 --> 40:17.380]  and routinely shoots kids in the backs and tasers people to death you know
[40:17.380 --> 40:20.300]  we're not supposed to be worried about that let the state have all the power
[40:20.300 --> 40:24.220]  at once but that counterbalance the armed citizen oh that's dirty that's bad
[40:24.220 --> 40:31.180]  and then I point out again you got a pro-gun woman who's a blue dog Democrat
[40:31.180 --> 40:34.580]  who the Democrats have been attacking I've got a whole bunch of reports how
[40:34.580 --> 40:38.460]  much they hate her and how she's been getting threatened by the left the
[40:38.460 --> 40:42.740]  controlled paradigm left and you got this very conservative federal judge who
[40:42.740 --> 40:46.260]  went to meet with her about the deteriorating border and that the drug
[40:46.260 --> 40:53.700]  gangs have taken over up to 85 miles in to the state and he's dead and he's a
[40:53.700 --> 40:59.940]  guy that ruled against Clinton in Clinton's gun grabbing very very suspicious
[40:59.940 --> 41:07.340]  now continuing here now this is the key right here I'm about to get into this is
[41:07.340 --> 41:11.620]  the most important point of it all 41 minutes into the first hour and I'm
[41:11.620 --> 41:15.660]  begging you to get this out to everyone you know I'm very thankful for the
[41:15.660 --> 41:20.780]  drives report having us linked from Saturday right through to today with our
[41:20.780 --> 41:25.820]  big article about Arizona shooter obsessed with mind control and now other
[41:25.820 --> 41:30.300]  newspapers are interviewing people in the college he'd walk in and say do you
[41:30.300 --> 41:34.100]  believe in mind control and he tell people he was under mind control and
[41:34.100 --> 41:39.260]  all he did was jibber about mind control there was the gentleman you can pull
[41:39.260 --> 41:45.180]  this up in 1998 that killed 13 people at a Baptist church in Fort Worth he'd
[41:45.180 --> 41:49.260]  been in Navy black ops he had been in mind control programs just like the LA
[41:49.260 --> 41:58.500]  Times Alexander Cochran reports that the unabomber was in a CIA LSD experiment
[41:58.500 --> 42:04.500]  that is declassified now who does this guy ask for as his lawyer Theodore
[42:04.500 --> 42:11.700]  Kazinsky's lawyer just like Jolly and West was the doctor for Jack Ruby and
[42:11.700 --> 42:15.340]  Ruby said they're giving me cancer injections people didn't know at the
[42:15.340 --> 42:19.140]  time the CIA had developed that now it's admitted shot him up killed him that's on
[42:19.140 --> 42:25.380]  record then Jolly and West becomes McVeigh's a physician from the time he's
[42:25.380 --> 42:29.980]  arrested through the trial and invert in Terahood Indiana he died a few years
[42:29.980 --> 42:35.460]  ago number two in mind control according to the MK Ultra 77 declassified the
[42:35.460 --> 42:41.620]  public number two man in mind control under Dr. Ewing Cameron and he's the
[42:41.620 --> 42:46.820]  doctor at the bedside when Jack Ruby's fine the shooter of Lee Harvey Oswald I
[42:46.820 --> 42:52.820]  mean folks it's it never ends now he's asking for the unabombers lawyer what
[42:52.820 --> 42:58.980]  it's admitted that the unabomber was in a CIA black-op program you cannot make
[42:58.980 --> 43:04.820]  this up it's a staged event my gut tells me all the evidence is there just like
[43:04.820 --> 43:10.460]  when we had the lawyers on Mr. and Mrs. Haskell both lawyers within four days
[43:10.460 --> 43:15.580]  after the Christmas Day bombing going back 12 and a half months ago and they
[43:15.580 --> 43:19.180]  reported that they saw the sharp-dressed man getting on the plane without a
[43:19.180 --> 43:22.780]  passport that there was an argument and the sharp-dressed man called rank then
[43:22.780 --> 43:26.260]  there was a guy videotaping the underwear bomber Metallib the entire time
[43:26.260 --> 43:30.220]  that they pulled him off reportedly found other bombs then they were told to shut
[43:30.220 --> 43:33.380]  up then they told their story the FBI visited him told them they were wrong
[43:33.380 --> 43:38.580]  then a month and a half after that the undersecretary of state came out Mr.
[43:38.580 --> 43:42.860]  Kennedy and said don't blame me I was ordered by an unnamed US agency to help
[43:42.860 --> 43:50.900]  him get on the plane that is public I told you that was staged how did I know
[43:50.900 --> 43:55.700]  Christmas Day my wife says go get eggs please because everything else the
[43:55.700 --> 44:00.260]  grocery store was closed I go to the gas station I'm getting the eggs getting
[44:00.260 --> 44:06.940]  myself a top of Chico mineral water waddle up to the checkout counter they
[44:06.940 --> 44:14.420]  got the TV on and it's a shooting it's a bombing I go get in my car and by the
[44:14.420 --> 44:17.860]  time I got home 10 minutes later sitting in the car listening right after it
[44:17.860 --> 44:26.020]  happened they've got the former head of Homeland Security on television saying
[44:26.020 --> 44:30.180]  we'll order scanners now because this happened and the spin was on every
[44:30.180 --> 44:33.420]  channel that don't worry they're gonna put scanners in because this happened
[44:33.420 --> 44:36.860]  when they'd ordered them a year before and Chertoff had given the order when he
[44:36.860 --> 44:42.220]  was told they had a Homeland Security to to begin the purchase of them and now
[44:42.220 --> 44:47.700]  he's the head of the company again that's just one little piece when you
[44:47.700 --> 44:54.180]  hear them immediately ready immediately scripting you notice you didn't hear
[44:54.180 --> 45:02.020]  any more about these firecracker bombs in Maryland last week because those are
[45:02.020 --> 45:05.660]  probably real loan nuts that did that when it's real they're not ready to
[45:05.660 --> 45:09.980]  have it on a handle it okay but when it's stage they hit the ground running
[45:09.980 --> 45:14.340]  and they're ready and then the evidence just comes out and it's on record the
[45:14.340 --> 45:18.980]  government got the underwear bomber on the plane boys and girls it's on record
[45:18.980 --> 45:22.500]  and we're all a lucky the admitted CIA asset secretly meeting at the Pentagon
[45:22.500 --> 45:26.500]  runs all these people it's admitted that for two years they knew who saw him
[45:26.500 --> 45:31.340]  what was planning the attack at Fort Hood under and we're all lucky's control so
[45:31.340 --> 45:36.860]  I know a staged event when I see one but I wasn't sure Saturday and Sunday and I
[45:36.860 --> 45:41.420]  said so last night but I said looking at his M.O. most these mind-control guys
[45:41.420 --> 45:48.020]  are given a personality template that they are a grim reaper devil worshiper
[45:48.020 --> 45:53.580]  and that they've got all this power and I said I believe he's a devil worshiper
[45:53.580 --> 45:59.460]  into the kind of vampire type subculture you know imaginary vampire
[45:59.460 --> 46:06.260]  and sure enough ladies and gentlemen black magic vampirism and all the stuff
[46:06.260 --> 46:11.220]  that goes with it dressing up like a woman being a liberal going and helping
[46:11.220 --> 46:17.300]  at the dog park I mean it it's all a hundred percent goes together part and
[46:17.300 --> 46:24.060]  parcel and all integrates together and here's another headline shooting
[46:24.060 --> 46:29.580]  suspects nihilism rose with isolation exactly into everything dark I love
[46:29.580 --> 46:38.020]  Hitler he says I love communism I love the devil I love the voodoo you know do
[46:38.020 --> 46:42.860]  what and it says he's a truth or in the article yeah this is definitely in
[46:42.860 --> 46:47.260]  mind control this whole thing was scripted from the beginning I told I
[46:47.260 --> 46:51.580]  mean look look I've got all the articles right here in front of me will
[46:51.580 --> 46:55.900]  Obama force America to absorb a terror attack to save his presidency that's
[46:55.900 --> 47:00.380]  September 22nd 2010 with all these White House advisors saying how great a big
[47:00.380 --> 47:03.580]  attack on the government would be to make them look like the victims here's
[47:03.580 --> 47:08.260]  another one top-fed repeats ominous absorb terror attack rhetoric but they
[47:08.260 --> 47:13.220]  know you don't buy into the Muslim stuff anymore so this happens now before I
[47:13.220 --> 47:16.460]  get into that new development let's get to this article that we've got to get
[47:16.460 --> 47:23.060]  out to everybody liberal smear machine backfires after gunman found to be a
[47:23.060 --> 47:28.780]  cultist pot smoking left-winger a full-scale demonization campaign against
[47:28.780 --> 47:32.540]  conservatives free speech of the Second Amendment on behalf of Democrats and
[47:32.540 --> 47:36.260]  the establishment media and the wake of Saturday shooting has sensationally
[47:36.260 --> 47:41.900]  backfired after it emerged that the gunman Jared Lee was a left-wing pot
[47:41.900 --> 47:49.300]  smoking liberal who was into dressing like a grim reaper and dabbling in the
[47:49.300 --> 47:58.540]  occult so again we've got this loftner individual who is a kaleidoscope a
[47:58.540 --> 48:05.020]  cornucopia whatever you want him to be he's it again they want to demonize
[48:05.020 --> 48:08.140]  marijuana legalization movement boom he's that you know the animal rights
[48:08.140 --> 48:13.620]  people he's that he the left the right just everything in their fervor to tear
[48:13.620 --> 48:18.460]  down the first and second amendments Democrats and their allies in the
[48:18.460 --> 48:23.780]  corporate media hastily characterize him as an anti-government right-winger in
[48:23.780 --> 48:28.660]  the rush to link him to the Tea Party and Sarah Palin a contention that is
[48:28.660 --> 48:33.420]  still being invoked as Dems seek to rush through gun control legislation as well
[48:33.420 --> 48:38.460]  as a bill that could make criticism of government a form of hate speech however
[48:38.460 --> 48:42.900]  precisely as Alex Jones forecast on a show last night and he's got a link to
[48:42.900 --> 48:48.140]  it it has emerged this morning that he is a devil worshiper wannabe who idolized
[48:48.140 --> 48:52.500]  fake human skulls and dressed up like the grim reaper well more than that I
[48:52.500 --> 48:56.380]  mean that's a sanary of it's the white side you know voodoo of it's the black
[48:56.380 --> 49:00.900]  side it's death worship devil worship with a skull giving it oranges and
[49:00.900 --> 49:06.380]  that's what they do how often have you witnessed a Tea Party or an anti-
[49:06.380 --> 49:11.740]  government activist or a conservative engage in any of the following behaviors
[49:11.740 --> 49:20.140]  all of which are confirmed to have been conducted by Loeffner burning an
[49:20.140 --> 49:24.820]  American flag being a left-winger and a liberal that's what all his friends said
[49:24.820 --> 49:29.940]  smoking pot having long hair dressing up as the grim reaper dabbling in a cult by
[49:29.940 --> 49:34.100]  worshipping a replica of a human skull expressing the desire to be a woman
[49:34.100 --> 49:38.140]  describing Karl Marx communist manifesto was his favorite book does it sound like
[49:38.140 --> 49:45.660]  Jared Lee was a right-wing conservative as the liberal smear machine is
[49:45.660 --> 49:50.180]  attempting to claim despite the fact that his former classmate described him as
[49:50.180 --> 49:54.940]  quote quite liberal and left-wing the New York Times Washington Post along with
[49:54.940 --> 49:59.180]  a host of status blogs at the Huffington Post daily cost were beating the drum
[49:59.180 --> 50:03.220]  for so-called right-wingers opponents of Obamacare and big government you ought
[50:03.220 --> 50:07.140]  to really love the tyranny liberals he continues the torture the wars you're
[50:07.140 --> 50:11.380]  not liberals you're a bunch of fascist to be politically silenced the name of
[50:11.380 --> 50:15.980]  toning down the rhetoric really when Obama is saying they bring a knife we
[50:15.980 --> 50:20.620]  bring a gun or when you're talking about how how on the daily cost how she's
[50:20.620 --> 50:28.260]  dead to you and how horrible she was in reality the shooter's political views
[50:28.260 --> 50:31.980]  were all over the map sharing characteristics of conservatism liberalism
[50:31.980 --> 50:34.980]  and libertarianism he was a fundamentally disturbed and deranged
[50:34.980 --> 50:43.380]  individual now we come back now he's a truther that's right mumbling in class
[50:43.380 --> 50:52.780]  about mind control constantly he's got a voodoo shrine in his back in his
[50:52.780 --> 50:59.220]  backyard and then we've got all this legislation being proposed to shut down

[52:37.980 --> 52:41.140]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[52:41.140 --> 52:46.380]  checkout to. Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[54:22.500 --> 54:27.980]  regularity that's what Harrison Clybold said and now they're unnamed friends
[54:27.980 --> 54:31.540]  there's all these other MySpace and Facebook's records of what was said
[54:31.540 --> 54:38.620]  about being a grim reaper wanting to be a woman but now there's unnamed people
[54:38.620 --> 54:42.980]  saying that they would hang out and smoke marijuana every day with the crew
[54:42.980 --> 54:47.060]  and when they weren't going to concerts or watching movies they talked about the
[54:47.060 --> 54:51.500]  meaning of life and dabbled in conspiracy theories see if you question the
[54:51.500 --> 54:55.580]  government or Gulf of Tonkin even though it's admitted it was staged that causes
[54:55.580 --> 55:00.580]  you to dress up like the grim reaper and get into voodoo and Karl Marx and kill
[55:00.580 --> 55:05.260]  people mistrust of government was his defining conviction the friend said he
[55:05.260 --> 55:08.420]  believed the government was behind 9-11 and worried that governments were
[55:08.420 --> 55:13.340]  maneuvering to create a unified monetary system a new world order currency so see
[55:13.340 --> 55:16.340]  now when it's all over the news every day they're setting up a world government
[55:16.340 --> 55:20.660]  you're not supposed to talk about it or have an opinion even though it's all
[55:20.660 --> 55:26.660]  being set up because oh he's one of those shooters as the IMF and World Bank
[55:26.660 --> 55:34.460]  announced the band core as all of this unfolds and happens so classic and this
[55:34.460 --> 55:39.460]  is out of the Associated Press known for being government run so there's no
[55:39.460 --> 55:44.380]  telling if it's even true it certainly may be but the issue here is we know he's
[55:44.380 --> 55:47.620]  got the devil's shrine at his house we know he wanted to be a woman we know
[55:47.620 --> 55:50.580]  he's dressing up like the grim reaper burning American flags we know he's
[55:50.580 --> 55:56.620]  writing about the communist manifesto that does not equal I ran that does not
[55:56.620 --> 56:00.740]  equal David I and so the system is desperate they've got to get us back
[56:00.740 --> 56:05.020]  under mind control get us back under their control get us back under that
[56:05.020 --> 56:10.260]  trance of feeling sorry for the government and oh my gosh and it's so
[56:10.260 --> 56:12.940]  terrible meanwhile this is a government that's killed over a million
[56:12.940 --> 56:19.660]  Iraqis over a million Vietnamese based on lies lying about WMDs calling for
[56:19.660 --> 56:23.580]  violence against nations telling us the torture of people's children in front of
[56:23.580 --> 56:28.100]  them to get answers is good a government so arrogant that they've been
[56:28.100 --> 56:31.780]  writing public policy reports saying how great attacks on the government would
[56:31.780 --> 56:35.820]  be as a pretext to have the government have the excuse to take our liberties
[56:35.820 --> 56:41.820]  that's how dumb they think you are at the White House now regardless of whether
[56:41.820 --> 56:45.740]  this is staged or not they're using it and I want to make the number one
[56:45.740 --> 56:51.060]  search term today so everybody sees this and so we can get on the offensive in
[56:51.060 --> 56:55.940]  the info war and we're doing that liberal smear machine backfires after
[56:55.940 --> 57:02.420]  gunman found to be a cultist pot smoking left winger let's get this out to

[57:14.140 --> 57:20.540]  the same issues here's another one by Mike Adams in the wake of Gifford
[57:20.540 --> 57:25.940]  shooting the mere act of questioning the government now being demonized but
[57:25.940 --> 57:33.940]  here is the search term that I want to launch today liberal smear machine
[57:33.940 --> 57:39.500]  liberal smear machine and it doesn't matter that Google blocks us on the

[57:53.860 --> 58:00.260]  search word search term liberal smear machine and and why does the system want
[58:00.260 --> 58:04.620]  to make this all liberal versus conservative by making it hey let's get
[58:04.620 --> 58:09.340]  the conservatives they can get mainline liberals to go along with anti second

[58:27.540 --> 58:30.900]  and then republicans will cheer the giving up the liberties and the left

[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:09.660]  do the culture vultures back off no that's why the White House has written
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:14.140]  all these memos and their advisors have saying we need a big tragedy we need a
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:20.620]  terror attack to make us the victims boom it happens just like at Columbine
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:28.420]  always the nihilistic mixed up screwed up children of liberals deliver and in

[01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:03.060]  flashback during illegal immigration debate sheriff dumb nick calls
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:08.060]  opponents racist so see they can call you whatever they want they can say if
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:11.660]  you're against healthcare bill you don't like black people which creates
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:16.260]  racial division and could cause fighting they don't care though they're gonna use
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:20.620]  their political weapons on you but you're not gonna say kick the bombs out
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:23.900]  you're not gonna say my second it's from my right but the good news is the
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:28.620]  tide's turning in every poll the vast majority have gone from being for
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:31.420]  abortion to against it the vast majority being against the second
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:35.580]  amendment to now being for it no one five years ago knew about the fellow
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:41.060]  reserve being private maybe two out of 50 people maybe now over 80% know it's
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:45.060]  private wanted to abolish or at least audited time is running out for the
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:48.860]  globalist the people are aware of the corruption they want to make it all a
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:55.740]  big left-wing right-wing fight I don't think it's fair to say this guy did all
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:59.180]  this because he was a left-winger and then let's demonize the Democrats but
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:05.980]  his MO is a lot closer to that and his old makeup and what we know about him is
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:12.180]  a lot closer to what you'd see as extreme liberal I mean I guarantee you
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:16.260]  walk up to some of the vampire wannabes that go to UT down on the drag running
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:19.300]  around trying to scare people and you ask him what they believe in it's gonna
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:23.420]  be communism or something I mean you know it's it's seen as trendy and cool
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:29.380]  and it's disgusting and I for one am sick of it we got a bunch of audio clips
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:34.380]  coming up but I mean there are scores of these articles Gabrielle Giffords
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:41.780]  shooting reignites fight over right-wing rhetoric in US Sarah Palin at
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:46.820]  center of storm over political vitriol after spree leaves six dead in
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:52.060]  congresswoman in critical condition you know the founding fathers went around
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:57.220]  actually assassinating tyrants but they were tyrants who were known to be
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:03.140]  tyrants and who'd been killing people I mean what happened with Shilchescu was
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:08.020]  it right for the Romanians to overthrow that mass murder was it right for the
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:12.500]  German military and Operation Valkyrie to try to overthrow Hitler according to
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:16.540]  our government no you let the government run all over you you never stand up
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:20.620]  against it but I want to be clear going out and becoming violent is not the way
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:24.620]  to go because we still can take our states back peacefully and take our
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:30.820]  congress back peacefully the system wants to jumpstart violence to to to to
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:37.820]  cut that off to stop that process from happening where we use words and
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:42.860]  powerful truthful words exposing the authoritarianism the tearing that's
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:46.940]  growing under both parties to have a rediscovery of liberty and freedom and
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:51.100]  take our country back so go ahead and stage all the shootings you want
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:56.020]  globalist this has got it written all over it people are wise to you and it
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:59.300]  ain't gonna work go ahead and try to take our free speech on our second
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:02.780]  amendment see what happens this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:07.220]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:11.260]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:14.660]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:19.180]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:23.740]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:27.780]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:31.580]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:35.180]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:39.540]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:50.580]  what he had to say about it when he was confronted about having no evidence that
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:56.820]  this guy was a right winger in fact the evidence is now becoming completely
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:02.620]  crystal clear that he was all over the political map and clearly leaning towards
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:07.260]  a lot of liberal views but let's go ahead and play this clip of what the
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:12.500]  father of the little dead girl says what does he say he criticizes basically the
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:16.860]  TSA and the airports and our loss of liberty there he says let's not have
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:22.100]  more of this you're not gonna be able to stop random acts like this when Cain
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:28.100]  killed Abel did God punish the rock that Cain used to bash Abel's brains out
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:39.180]  with you know did did the Israelites ban rocks no Cain got in trouble and what's
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:42.020]  happening to our minds what's happening to our culture what's happening in
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:47.500]  Mexico why are they unraveling it's cultures of corruption total gun ban in
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:55.100]  Mexico highest crime rate in the world now upwards of 30,000 dead a lot of
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:10:04.300]  police sheriffs regional police mayors let's go ahead and play the clip of the
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:10.820]  father John Green of the little girl gunned down reportedly by the grim
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:19.540]  reaper American flag burning cross-dressing animal rights activist so
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:24.820]  called conservative who liked the communist manifesto here it is John how do you
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:32.020]  explain something like this to your little boy well you know that we haven't
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:38.620]  started for that my son's my son's interested in hunting and he guns in
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:43.820]  general he's got nerve guns and things like that the only thing I did say is
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:54.460]  that you know that you see what happens you thought it's all problems but you
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:58.380]  can't solve problems with guns there's always gonna be there's always gonna be
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:05.860]  more problems but you know this is such a random act I don't want to raise
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:13.060]  alarm to that's a rare thing to happen in Tucson Arizona which is a wonderful
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:21.220]  city and the northwest side is a wonderful community but it just it shows
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:28.380]  it can happen anywhere and that's I think Christina you know she was born on
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:38.460]  9-11 the day the towers and down in the only city and he left us as it's
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:45.740]  tragic day but everything in the middle they're beautiful we had nine beautiful
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:52.780]  years occur I know I know she wouldn't want things to change would not want
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:58.380]  restrictions I I saw what happened to to our lives specifically because I travel
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:04.900]  quite a bit after 9-11 travel became a nightmare it don't need any more
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:14.380]  restrictions on our society I mean just I just think we are friends and family
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:19.300]  that we have the remorse of within this tragedy it's maybe that fella who was
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:25.740]  shooting everybody if he had some friends and family around him you know
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:32.220]  prior to this is that is that the one of the lessons we can take away from this
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:36.740]  John I mean I know okay when you lose a loved one when the rest of it's up on
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:43.260]  prisonplanet.com but there is the father John Green and his little girl you
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:47.900]  know was thinking about getting into political office and so they took her
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:56.700]  down to meet with the I guess role model the attractive intelligent member of
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:03.460]  Congress who again is set to make a recovery doctors optimistic but Giffords
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:08.940]  in for long recovery what an amazing story and to hear that father we had
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:13.540]  nine great years with her anybody who's got children and daughters you that
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:17.580]  really is like somebody reaches in and you can feel somebody with their hand
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:25.020]  on your heart pulling on it and I just think about this spoiled rotten wicked
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:29.460]  brat or he may have been a mind control victim either way he's a mind control
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:34.340]  victim of the culture in there playing violent video games 24-7 which all the
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:39.180]  study show desensitize you you may not be have the proclivity to be a
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:42.660]  psychopathic killer but when a psychopathic killer plays those games they
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:50.900]  do get the proclivity it does kick in I'm not saying restrict those games but be
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:56.260]  conscious about it but sure don't move to take my free speech in fact we have
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:59.180]  the video clip of it we'll play it later another clip coming up first but
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:04.180]  Democrats planning bill that would outlaw threatening lawmakers and the
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:08.660]  congressman said that anything you know throw the bums out anything that puts us
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:13.740]  down any things that make them that makes us feel bad any things that may
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:18.260]  make someone not like us over in Europe that's how they restrict free speech
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:21.700]  they say well you're calling the government scum that might make somebody
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:28.940]  who's unstable come after us and they're saying they're gonna amend the law to
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:33.380]  basically use the secret service on citizens and expand it but meanwhile
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:37.380]  Obama's saying if they bring a knife to a gun you know to a fight we bring a gun
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:43.740]  and we've got the daily cost talking about this congresswoman Giffords being
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:48.860]  dead to them because she was a conservative now let's go to Clarence
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:58.740]  Dumnick the sheriff there in the county who who wasted no time no time going
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:06.700]  after everybody's free speech and the second amendment and here he is on Fox
[01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:12.740]  the same show right after the father was on and the reporter is asking him well
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:17.860]  what's your proof that rhetoric caused him to do this I mean what's your proof
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:25.060]  and again he's a crazy person worshiping the devil he's I mean if you
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:29.900]  watch his videos it's right he dresses up like the grim reaper you know this
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:33.500]  country's in a lot of political trouble there's a lot of stuff going on and when
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:37.100]  things get crazy people go crazy when people lose everything they lose it
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:41.860]  yeah you're gonna see a lot of fireworks coming up and they plan on using it to
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:46.460]  take our freedoms our right to defend ourselves when the economy's collapsing
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:49.980]  out there and there's people running around looting the streets this is the
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:54.460]  big move if there was any doubt they want our guns they want our free speech
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:59.420]  they want our birthright look at what they do and everybody around this guy
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:03.060]  knew what he was planning but he got away with it why is that and who are
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:06.780]  these guys who brought him there and look like handlers why is you know John
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:10.900]  Doe number two let's not talk about it let's play the clip of the sheriff
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:15.860]  getting put on the hot seat as he's out there pushing and pushing and pushing to
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:20.260]  get political gas mileage out of it here it is what I'm wondering is do you have
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:25.060]  reason to believe that this particular suspected killer was was taking in
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:30.700]  information or was in any way influenced by the vitriol or the rhetoric that
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:36.820]  you're referring to that you know has been out on the airwaves if your
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:40.940]  question is specific I have to be specific and say I don't have that
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:46.140]  information yet the investigation is very in its very initial phases but my
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:50.020]  belief and I've been watching what's been going on in this country for the
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:55.260]  last 75 years and I've been a police officer for over 50 years there's no
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:17:00.820]  doubt in my mind that when a number of people night and day try to inflame the
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:04.660]  public that there's going to be some consequences from doing that and I
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:09.180]  think it's irresponsible to do that is that sheriff just sounds like you're
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:12.340]  being very honest that that's just your speculation and that's not anything
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:18.340]  that's fact-based at this point that that's that's my opinion period and you
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:24.020]  know we've had some some people question whether that is something you should be
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:29.260]  sharing now because tempers are already inflamed people are upset about what's
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:33.140]  happened the grieving families are still mourning the bodies have yet to be
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:39.220]  buried and is at the time really to be injecting speculative opinion like that
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:44.780]  into this case by somebody like yourself the sheriff well I think difference of
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:48.980]  opinion is this what makes the world go round and round but I think it's
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:56.580]  irresponsible for us not at some point to address this kind of behavior and try
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:18:00.780]  to put a stop to it there's no doubt in my mind that there are consequences to
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:06.780]  this kind of behavior when when people allegedly credible people who get up and
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:11.340]  in front of cameras and there you go phones so so so this is a guy we have
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:15.860]  the video of that too coming up if we have time this is the sheriff that said
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:21.060]  you're a racist if you don't like health care this is the sheriff who said
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:25.740]  it's racist if you want to control the borders that's in flaming people what
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:30.420]  does MSNBC do what all these guys do and hey you know what spew your
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:34.860]  rhetoric I've got my response to you that's how this works and you're not

[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:46.020]  able to that is the feds bomb Oklahoma City in 95 to shut down the states

[01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:25.820]  all right sheriff Richard Mack who's the sheriff in Arizona and knows all these
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:29.940]  players he's got some really important information for us and I'm going to
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:36.340]  integrate it in with a chilling report that's up on info wars.com and
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:42.260]  prisonplanet.com by the excellent research blog the total collapse top U.S.
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:49.660]  federal judge assassinated after threat to Obama agenda and it goes through that
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:56.980]  judge role was really causing them a problem and we're going to be covering
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:25:02.420]  that with sheriff Richard Mack coming up we're gonna have open phones when he's
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:05.580]  on with us as well then we're gonna have Larry Pratt in the last 30 minutes of
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:12.380]  the broadcast executive director of gun owners of America but quite frankly their
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:16.220]  bold attack on the second amendment is one thing and I've got the proposed
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:20.780]  legislation they already had written in the last month we warned you they've
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:29.580]  got geographically specific Texas to California gun registration plan and I've
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:34.540]  got the bill all right here it's a new American article we've got linked up on
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:40.820]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com but quite frankly that isn't as frightening
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:45.140]  as them openly because I've got the legislation right here and what they're
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:50.060]  proposing they say anything that makes somebody look bad in government is going
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:57.020]  to be illegal because it could incite somebody I mean this is moving very very
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:26:04.700]  very fast right now the toll-free numbers specifically on the shooting any
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:09.140]  tidbits of information you've got or points I haven't raised specifically on
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:12.460]  the second amendment or this attack on the first amendment I tell you the
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:17.700]  Democrats really show us who they are I saw Republicans you know back during
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:22.820]  Bush they arrest 9-11 truthers taser them send them to Guantanamo I mean it's
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:26.780]  just both parties are totally disgusting but whatever parties in power are the
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:30.300]  ones that always really flog the tyranny and then as soon as the other
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:35.980]  parties out of power they then poses you know defenders of liberty but a real
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:40.780]  change has happened a lot of these new Republicans our patriots do speak out
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:44.820]  against the world government do speak out against the new world order and are
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:49.260]  real and that's why they're pulling out all the stops against them if you see
[01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:53.300]  the media going into absolute conniption fits against somebody then you know
[01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:57.020]  they're good and strangely enough I just started researching this last night
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:00.180]  because I just took it for granted that well she's a Democrat she must be pro
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:05.940]  abortion pro open border anti-gun it turns out the Democrats absolutely hated
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:11.820]  and had attacked her and called her dead to them and everywhere else this
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:18.260]  Giffords lady and her husbands and Navy captain you know their their main line
[01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:23.420]  conservatives and they did not like it and I got a sneak in suspicion because
[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:27.420]  he's been to it we've now confirmed he's been to events with her he's asked
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:35.220]  her weird questions that the reported shooter Jared Lee Loeffner and again I
[01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:39.820]  was able to say last night I bet this guy's a devil worshiper anybody that's
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:42.860]  you know saying his favorite video is a grim reaper burning an American flag
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:47.100]  with really creepy music I noticed that in the video I saw Saturday that it
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:50.300]  would look like Arizona the background then I did searches on that other
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:54.460]  person's handle turns out they reportedly knowing now the reporting he was
[01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:58.420]  there I mean look you're dressing up like a really creepy grim reaper and
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:02.140]  playing really sick music burning an American flag does that sound like a
[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:07.580]  tea party or to you doesn't even sound like a Democrat to you know it's a
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:14.500]  lunatic a lunatic now was it artificial had he been broken into this he had the
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:19.820]  alter egos the the the the the the multiple personalities he was one of
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:24.500]  them was a woman another was a liberal that took care of doggies he would dress
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:30.420]  different for everyone another was this devil worshiper grim reaper he was
[01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:34.220]  obsessed with words and was always I mean you watch his videos I mean it's
[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:38.940]  hard to fake somebody this crazy of course some of his favorite books were
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:43.820]  Alice in Wonderland of course you know who else like those books other famous
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:47.300]  shooters were obsessed with it some reason they use it in code words and
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:55.340]  things I'd have to say right now it's about an 80% probability this get that
[01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:59.380]  this is a staged event you know he went into some kind of psychiatric reviews
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:03.180]  in September but they're keeping all that very close to their vest right now
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:09.820]  but it was ordered in September last year the police came to his house and you
[01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:14.020]  know I think there needs to be more probable cause acted on when somebody's
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:17.420]  talking about how they're gonna kill people which he done that's a warrant
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:21.460]  right there you start going around dressing up in black trench coats and
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:25.260]  talking about abortion how great it is and talking about how you want to kill
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:31.380]  people then you need to have a warrant needs to be served out you know but they
[01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:35.100]  never go to Harrison Clybold's house they never go to this guy's house and I
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:39.020]  bet you it's gonna come out in months it always has that this guy was on some
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:43.260]  type of Prozac drug which they admit puts you into a highly suggestible la la
[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:47.380]  land well you'll do things like shoot people focus decades but now it's on the
[01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:51.780]  drug inserts they have to admit it sure from that coming up we're on the March

[01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:09.700]  our articles warning everyone back in 2010 top fed repeats ominous absorb
[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:15.860]  terror rhetoric all these different White House officials and advisors making
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:21.340]  chilling comments about how they need stage terror attacks in America to be
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:26.460]  blamed on domestic groups so that people will then love Obama again and accept
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:33.780]  their agenda and it's all right here if I let me just pull you the Robert
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:39.100]  Shapiro clip it's just one of them Clinton and Obama advisor the bottom line
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:41.740]  here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership said
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:46.060]  Shapiro adding this is Financial Times of London he has to find some way of
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:51.060]  demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence and short of a new
[01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:57.740]  9-11 event or Oklahoma City bombing I can't think of how he can do that and
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:00.980]  I'm sorry to talk about mind control but we know it's been declassified they
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:04.540]  have them you get into Harris and Clyde Bolton Columbine that was a staged
[01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:09.580]  event takes hours to go over the evidence but we're joined for the next
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:17.340]  55 minutes or so by a man who really needs no introduction Sheriff Mac.com
[01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:22.900]  former sheriff of Graham County Arizona in 94 he filed a lawsuit challenging the
[01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:27.580]  Brady Bill ruled on by John M. Roll the judge who was just murdered by the
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:32.500]  Grim Reaper character who loves Carl Marx and likes addresses a woman and burn
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:37.300]  American flags but he's a conservative the New York Times says he's a lecture
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:41.020]  on constitutional issues relating to gun control law enforcement and stage
[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:46.820]  rights and I had the pleasure of having him speak at an event I had in Central
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:51.300]  California a few months ago and he's here with us now because he knows the
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:56.980]  players he knows the gun grabber anti-free speech pimp Sheriff Clarence
[01:39:56.980 --> 01:40:03.060]  Dupnick what a dupe he is to tyranny and he also knows the late and honorable and
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:08.300]  he was an honorable judge roll and he was a sheriff out in those parts and he
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:12.540]  wanted the Supreme Court so we're gonna go over that with Sheriff Mac and I'm
[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:15.580]  gonna hit some new intel and get his take on it and then your phone calls
[01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:20.460]  Sheriff Mac good to have you here with us. Thanks a lot Alex it's a real sad day
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:25.940]  for America to address this issue but especially to address the issue of one
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:32.460]  of the very few if not the only principled constitutional judge in America and
[01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:38.700]  now he's gone and as you said he was the judge in my case and he defended me
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:44.700]  everything that we stood for by principle he stood with us he made sure
[01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:48.620]  that those who were going after me were shot down those who were trying to
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:53.220]  attack even my standing the federal government attack said that Sheriff
[01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:57.660]  Mac can't even sue us because he has no standing he doesn't represent the county
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:01.940]  he's not a county commissioner therefore has no business and no lawful
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:06.900]  authority to sue judge roll shut that down he said the only principle that's
[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:11.060]  really that really matters here is that the government is trying to force
[01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:17.180]  Sheriff Mac to violate his oath of office to comply with federal unconstitutional
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:22.380]  unfunded mandates he recognized it he stood behind it he was he had the
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:27.140]  courage to stand for what the truth was that I was actually trying to do he's
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:33.340]  mentioned in all my books especially from my cold dead fingers and if anybody
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:36.980]  wants to pick that up it's actually the very best quote I've ever heard can you
[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:42.860]  imagine Alex that a federal judge and this is on page 19 he said Congress
[01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:47.620]  exceeded its authority under article one section eight of the United States
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:55.460]  Constitution actually quoted the enumerated powers of Congress and said
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:42:01.020]  they violated article one section eight and therefore Mac wins because of the
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:05.580]  tenth amendment and this also he was the only judge who heard this case out of
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:10.780]  dozens and dozens of share of of judges who heard this case at the circuit court
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:15.460]  level and at the Supreme Court he was the only one that said this also violated
[01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:21.100]  Mac's Fifth Amendment rights because it violates his right to do process now I
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:25.580]  want to go more over this but but as we're researching this deeply it turns
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:29.660]  out the Congresswoman Giffords we're gonna play this clip next hour was on
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:34.180]  Fox News the day before she was shot and she was talking about breaking the
[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:38.580]  left-right paradigm coming together cutting government cutting congressional
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:44.340]  spending if the Democrats and Republicans ever come together against the open
[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:48.940]  borders against the gun control against the dollar devaluation it's game over
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:54.220]  for the bankers and I find it very suspicious that judge roll who was for
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:57.100]  controlling the border and was meeting with her about the deteriorating
[01:42:57.100 --> 01:43:02.700]  security he'd been criticizing that 80 plus miles into Arizona is now controlled
[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:07.180]  by Mexico it turns out that and I'm gonna get to this a little bit later after
[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:12.060]  you talk more top US federal judge assassinated after threat to Obama
[01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:18.140]  agenda it turns out that a key in a key ruling and an SVR report federal judge
[01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:25.940]  John McCarthy role was the was the chief judge for the United States
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:31.340]  district court for the district of Arizona who this past Friday issued what
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:36.420]  was called a preliminary ruling in the case of United States of America versus
[01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:44.700]  the 333-520 in United States currency and then they have the case number filed
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:48.620]  wherein he stated he was preparing to rule against Obama's power to seize
[01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:52.460]  American citizens money without clear and convincing evidence of a crime being
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:56.060]  committed so he was going up against the know your customer Patriot Act stuff
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:44:00.300]  and how key this ruling was there's been other rulings against grabbing
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:06.220]  people's homes without proper deeds he was going in that direction I tell you
[01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:11.820]  very convenient that that these two got shot for the Obamanoids I mean I mean I
[01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:15.700]  mean if this was a so-called conservative out to kill liberals he sure
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:22.220]  killed the killed and wanted the wrong people Richard Mack no question now
[01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:29.740]  there's no question that Gavin Giffords is a good woman she has been very
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:35.740]  independent I don't agree with all her views but she was a pro-second
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:43.660]  amendment she was working against illegal immigration she has a gun and
[01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:47.340]  carries a gun even if she would add a gun in her hand I don't think she would
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:52.140]  have been able to shoot back on this at particular instance but yes it when
[01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:59.140]  somebody told me that judge role was at her rally I said no way I said federal
[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:03.380]  judges are not supposed to go to public political rallies like that and then they
[01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:06.980]  said oh well he was just shopping at Safeway and just happened out right at
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:12.060]  the wrong moment and he was saying hello to Congresswoman Giffords now we're
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:15.580]  told he wanted to meet with her about the deteriorating situation he wanted to
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:19.460]  meet with her after I think something else was going on I smell a big fat
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:24.020]  dirty rat well I did at the very beginning and when my son called me I
[01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:27.380]  was actually speaking again in California my son called me in the morning
[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:31.700]  and told he didn't know it was judge role and all my family know judge role
[01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:36.940]  very well because he's in all my books and they remember his name because he
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:42.940]  was the first one to hear my case and I was just absolutely floored at my next
[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:46.420]  meeting when a person in the audience told me that the judge who was murdered
[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:52.380]  was judge John roll this is a an absolutely principled constitutional man
[01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:57.420]  a man who would do anything to stand for freedom for our country and then he
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:03.700]  is snuffed out by somebody who actually admits on his own emails that there are
[01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:09.860]  such thing as mind control brainwashing and all this other crap and then he goes
[01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:16.260]  through with this absolute horrendous murder and how could anyone look at
[01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:21.860]  that beautiful little girl and shoot her like that it has to be somebody who's
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:26.700]  completely deranged or completely manipulated absolutely who could shoot a
[01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:30.700]  nine-year-old girl I mean you look in this murderers eyes and then there's all
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:35.380]  the witnesses he's the reported murder and he is just completely crazed but now
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:39.660]  we learn one personality he dressed up like a woman another he did devil
[01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:43.620]  worship another he went out and help people locally with their animals I
[01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:48.060]  mean this guy sounds like the classic multiple personality fruitcake and now
[01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:51.700]  the Newark Daily News and those are reporting the teachers are saying in
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:55.700]  college he would come in and basically say I'm under mind control do you know
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:47:01.060]  what that is yeah so I mean come on and I'll tell you another thing Alex I told
[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:04.900]  my son who it was I didn't know this kid's name but I said this is gonna be a
[01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:12.060]  white deranged supposed constitutional guy and a loner and sure enough here it
[01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:18.460]  comes I know I know before it was even reported who he was yeah my gut told me
[01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:23.420]  that too I was hoping above hope what do you think about the bizarre voodoo he's
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:27.060]  got the skull of the oranges for those that don't know that's an offering to
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:31.340]  to be Elsie Bob you know even in voodoo they've got the light in the dark voodoo
[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:36.700]  this is the darkest type of voodoo here well these things are real and that's
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:40.420]  why you've got a steer away and what we've said all along is the steer away
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:46.100]  from those who participate in the same worship it can create a mind control it
[01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:50.540]  can create a brainwashing well why did his parents allow this big tent in the
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:56.060]  back with sofas and I mean he had a whole set up out there well what what
[01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:59.900]  parents let their kid have a full board devil worship outfit you know you know
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:05.260]  the and again all of that's crazy and if and instead of sheriff dupe nick P
[01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:09.940]  mccounty sheriff and Tucson and others in this country congresswoman McCarthy now
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:15.780]  calling for more gun control if all these idiots would keep their mouth shut
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:20.580]  and and and try to investigate and see what went on and attack the problem
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:24.180]  instead of attacking freedom and the Constitution we're gonna make it
[01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:30.020]  somewhere on this issue but the first thing is I would ask any sheriff or any
[01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:34.900]  police officer why did not Tucson PD have security there at an outdoor
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:40.300]  political rally of a congresswoman why didn't the sheriff have security there
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:44.220]  when I spoke at Santa Cruz with you I didn't even ask for and they had like
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:49.620]  30 people I know security was everywhere and I'm glad they were I was glad to see
[01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:54.460]  security at our event there were you had a tremendous event out there was jam
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:59.900]  packs dining room only nine or you know 900 people maybe a thousand both nights
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:04.140]  two nights in a row and there was security there she's a congresswoman for
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:10.380]  God's sake and she's one hour she's 60 minutes from the border and they have no
[01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:15.900]  security at an outdoor event for her when there are public hits on members of
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:19.860]  Congress federal judges and sheriffs on record that have been standing for
[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:24.900]  border control yeah and the sheriff duke Nick has been criticizing all the other
[01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:29.340]  sheriffs who have been fighting the illegal immigration he has he with the
[01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:34.300]  other sheriff from Santa Cruz sheriff Astrada those two have been fighting the
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:39.100]  other sheriff and these are sheriffs who get getting shot at multiple times
[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:43.780]  deputies and others getting shot at out in these desert areas where the cartels
[01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:47.740]  are now bleeding over into Arizona and these sheriffs are putting their lives
[01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:54.380]  on the line sheriff Babu especially in Penal County which is right next to
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:58.840]  Pima County and then sheriff duke Nick what does he do he criticizes the
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:03.620]  sheriff tells him it tells everybody tells the entire nation that legal
[01:50:03.620 --> 01:50:06.820]  immigration is not a problem and those of you trying to fight it or a bunch of
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:11.820]  racists and bigots how absurd can we get he's saying that it's our fault when
[01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:16.740]  when this grim reaper Marxist lover never said anything about immigration
[01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:21.300]  correct and and not only that sheriff duke Nick is now blaming the Tea Party
[01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:26.180]  Movement the constitutionalists and other people on radio talk shows that
[01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:31.900]  it's our rhetoric and and so he's basically telling America and people in
[01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:35.860]  Arizona and his constituents who are Tea Party members and there's a lot of them
[01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:39.940]  there that you should be quiet and support your government so people like
[01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:46.220]  this don't get bad ideas from what you are saying how absurd can you get
[01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:49.860]  unbelievable I want to get into the move to shut down free speech open

[01:54:22.740 --> 01:54:26.980]  winger and folks you know I'm for drug decriminalization I'm not bashing pot
[01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:32.340]  smokers but the point here is is that four mentally ill people I've read the
[01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:36.980]  studies it may help you if you've got cancer or glaucoma I know it's got a
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:42.140]  lot of medical uses but it is classified in the hallucinogenic area and time and
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:45.820]  time again marijuana does make schizophrenics you can look it up they
[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:49.700]  recommend schizophrenics not use any drugs but helps push them deeper into
[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:54.900]  the psychosis for whatever reason they can also have positive psychological
[01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:58.340]  effects on other people but you know different things are different for
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:03.620]  everybody you know that's the old you know stuff about opiates sometimes the
[01:55:03.620 --> 01:55:06.620]  Native Americans you can't knock them out with that for surgery they've got to
[01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:11.100]  use something else it's different for every person and schizophrenics it is not
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:16.380]  the way to go but again it could be mind control could be a schizophrenic but
[01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:19.980]  we're doing the search term liberal smear machine let's put that in Google
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:27.900]  over and over again liberal smear machine and let's also do the headline
[01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:33.740]  let's fire another torpedo in the info war gunman left winger gunman left
[01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:38.540]  winger that's the second search term so liberal smear machine and liberal left
[01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:41.780]  winger a sheriff Richard Mack again he was a sheriff down there and knows all
[01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:45.500]  these players what is it like because I know you're doing the research but I've
[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:48.860]  seen all over the news that he was talking about killing people at college
[01:55:48.860 --> 01:55:53.740]  the police had been to his house why didn't they execute a search warrant why
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:57.500]  hadn't he been put in psychiatric care or was he we're not being told that I
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:01.420]  mean they're acting very suspicious this sheriff won't talk about what they've got
[01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:06.580]  out of his safe but and then won't say it's proof that it's right wing I mean
[01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:11.020]  you know this sounds like a lot's going on here when he's got a full bore black
[01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:15.420]  magic temple in his backyard well I would like to first ask the sheriff why
[01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:18.780]  aren't you going after the people who got him the marijuana he wasn't growing
[01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:23.220]  his own so let's find out who his drug source was let's arrest them for being
[01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:29.260]  accomplices and maybe we should make laws against marijuana oh whoops it's
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:34.060]  already against the law he couldn't get marijuana it's against the law yeah he
[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:38.900]  was a pothead he was a cook and we don't believe that he went to that he was
[01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:43.980]  ever institutionalized because he was able to buy a gun just a few months ago
[01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:49.660]  and he had to do a obviously go through the criminal background check from the
[01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:55.140]  sports authority where he bought the gun so most of those but again some
[01:56:55.140 --> 01:57:00.700]  mental mental history records are not immediately available to those kinds of
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:05.980]  checks even though the FBI has tried to increase those and put them on their
[01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:10.180]  list those are a little bit more difficult to deal with even for the FBI
[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:13.700]  and all there we also know they're already trying to use it against military
[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:18.860]  veterans so they're going to use it as a discriminatory system I'd rather
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:23.140]  just have the people be armed to defend ourselves from loons well absolutely
[01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:31.100]  and the whole thing is the leaders including Sheriff Dupnick and our own
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:36.580]  Congress are going to use this to take guns away from you and me innocent
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:40.420]  law-abiding citizens are going to pay the price for this because they're going
[01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:46.220]  to come after us now Arizona just recently this might be another spoke on
[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:50.700]  the wheels here of this whole story Arizona just six months ago went to a
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:56.900]  constitutional form of Second Amendment adherence we no longer require permits
[01:57:56.900 --> 01:58:02.820]  of any kind you can carry open or concealed no money no fees no licenses
[01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:07.340]  no permits no asking mother may I and that's Vermont style you know this
[01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:11.540]  would have been a Republican rally I'll guarantee you half the people would
[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:14.900]  have been packing and he would have been shot down even faster he wouldn't
[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:19.740]  have got the second shot off if the people I know in Tucson that are just
[01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:23.580]  the normal tea party groups and the gun race groups if any of them had been
[01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:29.140]  there this guy would have never shot that little girl makes me sick and now
[01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:32.380]  they're gonna try to use her murder to take our sacred First Amendment and
[01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:35.980]  Second Amendment but her father have you heard this Sheriff Mack I'll ask you when
[01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:39.300]  we come back in 60 seconds her father came out and said don't take people's
[01:58:39.300 --> 01:58:44.420]  liberties over her death are you tired of searching for great talk radio
[01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:52.740]  more important search for no rules we are the GCN radio network hundreds of
[01:58:52.740 --> 01:58:56.900]  nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[01:58:56.900 --> 01:59:01.940]  chance to not relive history as a finishing off this agenda that we're
[01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:05.500]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned immense
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:10.580]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[01:59:10.580 --> 01:59:15.940]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:20.860]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:25.260]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:28.980]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:32.940]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:38.500]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:44.620]  the Republic get your copy of full of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're
[01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:51.300]  watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet.tv
[01:59:53.180 --> 02:00:00.900]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:12.460]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:19.980]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:30.780]  Alex Jones well the world socialist website is saying Arizona assassination
[02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:34.860]  spree tied to political right oh really well he was a favorite book was a
[02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:39.460]  commerce manifesto and he like to dress up like a woman the grim reaper was
[02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:44.940]  called very liberal by his friends I mean just incredible Sheriff Mack I've got
[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:49.860]  the new American magazine here in front of me this is linked up on info
[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:54.660]  wars in prison planet ATF plans registration in border states now
[02:00:54.660 --> 02:01:00.420]  they're trying to extra judicially say they want when people buy rifles for for
[02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:05.780]  it to be reported to the ATF not just go through the next system but the
[02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:09.140]  statistics I've read most the weapons being used by drug cartels down there
[02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:13.460]  are being bought from the military themselves they're they're fully auto
[02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:21.620]  and there's hang grenades and stuff yeah all that's true and I guarantee you that none of the things that they want to do as far as
[02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:26.700]  registration or more background checks or more about any kind of checks would have
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:30.540]  stopped this that's why they have to take this Alex to the next level and
[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:34.900]  they've got to confiscate guns that's the only thing that will have any
[02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:39.620]  appeasement to these gun grabbers and boy we better be watching out because this
[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:45.380]  is a direct hit at the second amendment well I mean regardless of who's really
[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:48.900]  behind it it looks staged I mean I mean I've never seen them come out of the
[02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:52.380]  closet as tyrants this but they even want the first amendment they say
[02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:57.780]  anything that could be conscrued as making someone else angry is gonna be
[02:01:57.780 --> 02:02:01.540]  banned that's right and so that means they're coming after you they're coming
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:07.420]  after me they're coming after the tea party movement and it's it's really an
[02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:13.660]  amazing process how these things are exploited and just as you mentioned the
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:17.980]  little green girl's father said you're not going to exploit my daughter's death
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:23.260]  to promote your own political liberal agenda and especially to go after gun
[02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:29.100]  couldn't more gun control what a great man yeah if one of my daughters was gun
[02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:33.340]  down I'll guarantee you 48 hours later I would probably not even be able to talk
[02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:38.180]  but are you hearing break up and crack up and it just tears my guts out it does
[02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:43.660]  me as well I've shed tears over this over the weekend several times especially
[02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:49.180]  when I knew it was that little girl and especially judge John roll judge judge
[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:56.060]  John roll changed my life a lot of what he did is what I'm doing now because of
[02:02:56.060 --> 02:03:00.380]  what he did and what he stood for and what he said is in my books now you
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:04.820]  always talk about him in my presentation you always talk about him when
[02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:14.500]  you're on the show every time every time yes and a guy who likes to wear women's
[02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:18.420]  clothes and dressed like the grim reaper has killed him and then we get to be
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:23.780]  blamed for it absolutely astonishing that they could make that big of a turn
[02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:29.580]  but when you get liberals who will not comply with principles of freedom who
[02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:34.140]  will not comply with their oath of office who now ruled the Constitution and
[02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:39.500]  then make fun of it afterwards you know where this type of stuff can come from
[02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:42.980]  unbelievable we're about to go to bright long-sendment coming up are gonna take
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:46.940]  calls but any other pieces of info you want to talk about dealing with judge
[02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:54.780]  roll yes on on page two of my little book he said this and this is what I've
[02:03:54.780 --> 02:03:58.940]  quoted on your show numerous times said I'm reading right out of my book
[02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:04.180]  federal district judge John roll Mac is thus forced to choose between keeping
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:09.740]  his oath or obeying the law subjecting himself to possible sanctions he was
[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:13.420]  really worried about the sanctions that were going after me he protected me
[02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:17.180]  because they said in the Brady Bale that they would arrest me if I failed to
[02:04:17.180 --> 02:04:23.500]  comply or in the other sheriff and so judge rule stood up for me in
[02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:27.580]  particular because I was the only one filing the lawsuit at that time isn't
[02:04:27.580 --> 02:04:32.180]  that interesting you get this conservative Democrat you get this
[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:38.820]  federal patriot judge killed by this ultra liberal and it's so convenient
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:42.540]  now the media gets to blame it on the Tea Party boy isn't that convenient that's
[02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:46.620]  very and he's running around everywhere saying he's under mind control but we're
[02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:55.340]  just supposed to ignore that huh sheriff yeah I'd like to know who his
[02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:58.900]  psychiatrist was we'll be right back

[02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:08.500]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:13.340]  representative Carolyn McCarthy whose husband and son were killed on that
[02:08:13.340 --> 02:08:18.340]  commuter train back in the early 90s by that other lunatic it was done in an
[02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:24.660]  area where it's a victim disarmament zone no guns allowed predominantly in many
[02:08:24.660 --> 02:08:28.860]  areas of the state but a hundred percent gunman on that train you notice these
[02:08:28.860 --> 02:08:33.060]  people love generally to go where it's a school or some other place where they
[02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:37.820]  know people aren't going to be armed so they can carry out their ghoulish deed
[02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:43.140]  and as the culture and the media hypes it and hypes it mentally ill people get
[02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:46.820]  the idea well I'll go commit suicide by waving a gun around on the Brooklyn
[02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:51.020]  bridge and the cops will come and shoot me that's what this guy talked about he
[02:08:51.020 --> 02:08:55.380]  talked about his assassination how the police would then assassinate him but
[02:08:55.380 --> 02:08:59.740]  that didn't happen this lunatics now going to be in a supermax prison for the
[02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:04.300]  rest of his life and probably executed after a few decades of that but McCarthy
[02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:09.620]  ready's gun control bill and in her bill she says and we will not allow him to
[02:09:09.620 --> 02:09:14.100]  have an arsenal of ammunition like he has had so she says not only will semi
[02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:18.980]  automatic guns of any type be banned in the bill she's about to introduce but
[02:09:18.980 --> 02:09:23.420]  she went on to say that that that that that he will not be allowed to have the
[02:09:23.420 --> 02:09:29.740]  amount of ammo he had so I guess now having 18 rounds is a arsenal I guess
[02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:35.420]  you get one bullet a kind of like Australia Richard Mack yeah I saw her
[02:09:35.420 --> 02:09:42.540]  comment I've actually debated her back during the beta bill times she was a
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:47.780]  woman who cares nothing about history she carries nothing about the rule of
[02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:53.340]  law she's she believes that gun control somehow would have made her family
[02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:57.100]  safer well they already had gun control just as you mentioned extreme gun
[02:09:57.100 --> 02:10:03.380]  control so the only thing as we were pointing out earlier Alex they can take
[02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:08.740]  us to the next level is not more background checks the only thing can be
[02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:15.700]  confiscation and complete of gun control which means innocent law-abiding
[02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:19.580]  citizens will not be able to get these and that doesn't work in Mexico they've
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:23.700]  got a crime right off the charts compared to us absolutely in fact Mexico is a
[02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:28.780]  war zone and citizens are not allowed to have guns there no one is and yet it is
[02:10:28.780 --> 02:10:35.860]  a war zone there and in fact the drug war has destroyed that country almost
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:40.180]  completely stopping tourism in the northern part of the area because people
[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:44.020]  are afraid to go down there anymore here's a quote here's a quote by McCarthy
[02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:50.580]  she says she says that my staff is working on looking at different
[02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:55.460]  legislation fixes that we might be able to do to introduce as early as today that
[02:10:55.460 --> 02:11:02.380]  was yesterday she said tomorrow she goes on here to say that many said that
[02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:05.020]  people with a history of mental instability like the alleged shooter
[02:11:05.020 --> 02:11:10.740]  Jared Lee Loeffner should not be able to buy a gun well I mean how do you know
[02:11:10.740 --> 02:11:16.140]  beforehand and no one should be able to buy stockpiles of ammunition used by the
[02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:21.260]  22-year-old assailant he had 18 rounds of well so that's a stockpile now what
[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:26.740]  does that mean it means you and I are in trouble and other law-abiding citizens
[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:32.460]  we are the ones that they're going to attack this is something that they are
[02:11:32.460 --> 02:11:38.740]  loving to exploit what this was for their own gun control liberal agenda and
[02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:45.420]  that's why I told my son I know darn well who this shooter is because this is
[02:11:45.420 --> 02:11:50.260]  something that they had to have happen we got a lot of phone calls here we're
[02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:53.740]  gonna continue with phone calls right through Larry Pratt coming up in about
[02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:57.500]  30 minutes and I'm gonna go into the fourth hour today as well make sure we
[02:11:57.500 --> 02:12:01.300]  get to everybody because I've got a lot of other points that I haven't made yet
[02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:08.060]  and I want to speak directly to the gun grabbers coming up briefly in the start
[02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:13.140]  of the next hour but right now I want to hurry through these question or quick
[02:12:13.140 --> 02:12:17.820]  comment for Sheriff Richard Mack John in Texas you're on the air go ahead hi
[02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:23.060]  Alex you know Australia Canada in Britain you Britain used to have the
[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:27.500]  same gun rights we did but because of the same cooking cutter alone deranged
[02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:32.140]  gunman now they lost all their rights and not only that they have a free speech
[02:12:32.140 --> 02:12:35.180]  restrictions there now to where you can't say certain things that they put
[02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:38.940]  you in jail they're almost though what I call soft core communist police states
[02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:44.220]  and that's what the globalists have really got designed for this country they
[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:48.020]  got to have gun control we're the last country besides us in Switzerland or the
[02:12:48.020 --> 02:12:51.100]  only two country where they have free access to the gun so they got to have
[02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:53.700]  an excuse to get them out of our hands and a few years ago they had a
[02:12:53.700 --> 02:12:57.380]  psychiatric patient go into one of their state governments and kill a bunch of
[02:12:57.380 --> 02:13:01.820]  people I mean how many times we have to see this repeat itself over and over and
[02:13:01.820 --> 02:13:07.260]  over again it's very suspicious anything else John no that's just about it
[02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:11.860]  Sheriff Mack your comments on what John just said well he's absolutely correct
[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:17.700]  and everything that has failed in Europe we now want to embrace in America and
[02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:22.060]  our leaders here are doing it including the one that led us in a moment of
[02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:26.460]  prayer this morning from the White House law disgusting he just prays that he'd
[02:13:26.460 --> 02:13:32.700]  be able to enslave us let's talk to Dave in Ohio Dave you're on the air hey
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:38.380]  doing Alex are you doing Sheriff good thanks yes I had come across something on
[02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:44.900]  YouTube on Congress and Congresswoman Giffords YouTube channel she has on the
[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:50.180]  part of where you subscribe to other she has two friends and one of them is the
[02:13:50.180 --> 02:13:55.420]  Grim Reaper Laughner now what is that I mean I mean was that before or after was
[02:13:55.420 --> 02:14:02.500]  a hat I mean that's no we've checked it and it appears that it happened after
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:07.100]  the shooting we've gone to the Google archive and it looks like it wasn't
[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:12.020]  there just a few weeks ago and I just have a message to the usurping gun
[02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:18.740]  grabbing slime filth of this country come and take it well that is the issue if
[02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:22.940]  they do try to disarm us like the Nazis did it's it's gonna it's it's gonna be
[02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:26.380]  serious situation and that's what the globalists want folks let's fix the
[02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:30.140]  country peacefully let's take our counties and cities back let's not let
[02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:34.900]  them use fake terror and hyped up events to scare us into submission to give up
[02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:38.300]  our first amendment or our second amendment or our property rights let's
[02:14:38.300 --> 02:14:42.500]  stand strong and come together and that's why I'm and we're gonna play this
[02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:46.700]  later Congresswoman Giffords she was talking about shattering the left right
[02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:51.020]  paradigm and for a Democrat was pretty conservative on the border and second
[02:14:51.020 --> 02:14:55.180]  amendment and a lot of Democrats had had been attacking her for voting against
[02:14:55.180 --> 02:15:01.980]  Nancy Pelosi and others exactly she she was independent she was an Arizona by
[02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:07.140]  heart and so she was standing for her people on several issues yeah she was
[02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:12.260]  still a Democrat on some issues but on some real key issues she was very
[02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:16.860]  independent very Arizona and a guy that all his friends called very liberal
[02:15:16.860 --> 02:15:21.460]  extremely liberal who liked to dress up like a girl who liked to dress up like
[02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:28.060]  the grim reaper who you know in between the time he was doing a voodoo
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:33.460]  rituals and his own little voodoo temple in the backyard that mommy and daddy I
[02:15:33.460 --> 02:15:39.180]  guess knew about and let him have at 20 something years old now we're blamed for
[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:43.660]  that no you will not blame us for that if this guy claimed he was a tea partier
[02:15:43.660 --> 02:15:47.780]  and ran American flags up to the top of the pole every day it's still not my
[02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:53.660]  fault what somebody else does but to claim that this freak represents true
[02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:58.500]  conservatives is a fraud and a stinking joke I'm gonna go to our phone line
[02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:03.060]  system here eight seven seven seven eight nine al ex let's talk to mark in
[02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:07.460]  Texas and then JB mark you're on the air with Sheriff Richard Mac he's gone
[02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:14.540]  how are you okay mark you there yeah yeah hello yes I can yeah you all know
[02:16:14.540 --> 02:16:20.860]  about Joe Zemudio the hero that ran into the action and subdued the gunman
[02:16:20.860 --> 02:16:26.620]  yeah yeah he had a gun on him yeah I see them on Fox News today and they didn't
[02:16:26.620 --> 02:16:29.900]  know that at first but when they found out I mean their jaw just dropped to the
[02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:33.220]  ground and I'm sure they're gonna try to bury this guy I couldn't find them
[02:16:33.220 --> 02:16:37.660]  anywhere else but he's on a YouTube video with her all though did an
[02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:41.660]  interview with them so you might want to check that out and I'm glad you called
[02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:45.460]  because I heard them say a man with a gun subdued him and then we've been
[02:16:45.460 --> 02:16:51.300]  looking for days and it's so buried we can't find it oh we have it okay when
[02:16:51.300 --> 02:16:54.380]  I'll take it if you got it and if you got the herald that will post it on
[02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:59.220]  info wars or prison planet but they've really been trying to bury that haven't
[02:16:59.220 --> 02:17:04.860]  they a sheriff max oh yeah yeah they did they tried to bury it however he was
[02:17:04.860 --> 02:17:09.100]  just a little bit late getting there with his gun they were actually were
[02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:13.180]  trying to report that he had a gun but it wasn't loaded no I don't believe that's
[02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:17.420]  the case what happened is he went into the store and heard the shooting and
[02:17:17.420 --> 02:17:22.540]  went back out there and then I think the suspect was reloading at the time
[02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:27.460]  trying to put in another clip and that's when the guy decided to tackle him and
[02:17:27.460 --> 02:17:31.340]  then somebody helped him and then a third person came over and sat on him as
[02:17:31.340 --> 02:17:37.620]  well but what I would say if any of the tea party people I know and I've talked
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:41.260]  over at a hundred tea parties across this country in the last year and a half
[02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:46.900]  not once did anybody ever mention that we should kill politicians that we should
[02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:51.420]  kill anybody that this was a call to arms no one has ever talked about that
[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:56.140]  Alex at any of the tea party groups ever they want yes they're mad they're
[02:17:56.140 --> 02:17:59.820]  frustrated but all they want is their constitution back and they want the
[02:17:59.820 --> 02:18:04.700]  politicians who swear or no to actually follow the Constitution to pretend to do
[02:18:04.700 --> 02:18:08.060]  it sometimes and they're sick and tired of watching this corruption and they
[02:18:08.060 --> 02:18:13.220]  want some answers and they want a change in our country that's all they're
[02:18:13.220 --> 02:18:20.980]  asking for okay local radio is reporting that gunman was shot by defender in the
[02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:26.340]  crowd and we have Fox News Shepherd Smith now reporting this so our web
[02:18:26.340 --> 02:18:29.940]  masters are going to get it up on infoworks.com and prisonbonnet.com but
[02:18:29.940 --> 02:18:36.780]  if they have successfully kept it quiet that the guy actually shot him or that
[02:18:36.780 --> 02:18:40.540]  may be a misreport Sheriff Mack again you've got that he only came out and
[02:18:40.540 --> 02:18:44.460]  helped tackling but didn't use his gun correct that's the story I've got at
[02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:49.020]  this point but I think this comes back to a point you were making earlier this
[02:18:49.020 --> 02:18:53.820]  idiot this lunatic thought he was going to be shot he knows that people have
[02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:58.100]  guns in Arizona he knows people have guns in Tucson he expected to be sick
[02:18:58.100 --> 02:19:02.420]  there that there would be security he expected that after he got four or five
[02:19:02.420 --> 02:19:06.940]  off this somebody was gonna shoot him this was his way to go out in a blaze of
[02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:13.340]  glory he expected to be assassinated and it boy can you imagine this spoiled
[02:19:13.340 --> 02:19:17.460]  brat living with mommy and daddy at 22 can you imagine what he's gonna like a
[02:19:17.460 --> 02:19:23.300]  super max and then and then lethal injection yeah exactly but you know he
[02:19:23.300 --> 02:19:27.460]  is so crazy maybe he needs to just be in a mental institution I mean he is a I
[02:19:27.460 --> 02:19:31.460]  mean he's clearly completely a fruitcake well the people in his class at
[02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:35.300]  Pima Community College had reported him to the school and teachers and security
[02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:39.020]  and others saying this guy's a kook he's violent he's crazy get him out of here
[02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:43.220]  they took action but law enforcement I guess never did well they went to his
[02:19:43.220 --> 02:19:47.380]  house and they promised to put him in psychiatric care and if they did leave
[02:19:47.380 --> 02:19:50.980]  and if they did put him on the seroton re uptake inhibitors it's on the drug
[02:19:50.980 --> 02:19:54.660]  insert it can trigger psychotic violent breaks Sheriff Mack stay there my
[02:19:54.660 --> 02:19:59.820]  friend more call straight ahead from JB Sean and many others Randy Joe Mark
[02:19:59.820 --> 02:20:03.820]  aiming you name it hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are
[02:20:03.820 --> 02:20:07.940]  now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did
[02:20:07.940 --> 02:20:11.060]  you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more

[02:25:05.740 --> 02:25:07.940]  and i don't even call them liberals they're just
[02:25:07.940 --> 02:25:09.980]  fascist

[02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:44.380]  top u s federal judges assassinated after threat to obama agenda
[02:25:44.380 --> 02:25:47.940]  when i learned what judge role was doing on a key executive order
[02:25:47.940 --> 02:25:51.460]  with obama and the executive order thirteen five two eight
[02:25:51.460 --> 02:25:54.260]  dealing with the ten fema governors
[02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:56.140]  uh... this judge was
[02:25:56.140 --> 02:25:59.980]  really on target and then talk in a share of mac how he was a pro second
[02:25:59.980 --> 02:26:01.700]  amendment patriot
[02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:03.020]  uh...
[02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:05.780]  i tell you this whole thing stinks worse and worse
[02:26:05.780 --> 02:26:07.420]  by the minute
[02:26:07.420 --> 02:26:09.260]  uh... sheriff mac uh...
[02:26:09.260 --> 02:26:11.780]  let's let's finish up our talk with
[02:26:11.780 --> 02:26:16.020]  judge role and how important he was to you he's in all your books you talked
[02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:19.340]  about him in one of your speeches you gave out in california with yours
[02:26:19.340 --> 02:26:20.060]  truly
[02:26:20.060 --> 02:26:23.860]  uh... you talked about me every time you come on this show you really admired
[02:26:23.860 --> 02:26:26.300]  him as one of the few good federal judges
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:30.540]  and then magically he's dead i'd and by this guy running around saying he was
[02:26:30.540 --> 02:26:32.740]  under mind control
[02:26:32.740 --> 02:26:37.540]  yeah at the uh... the coincidences keep piling up uh... and after you get to
[02:26:37.540 --> 02:26:39.260]  ten or fifteen of them
[02:26:39.260 --> 02:26:42.380]  you know uh... maybe they weren't coincidences
[02:26:42.380 --> 02:26:45.860]  uh... very rarely do things happen in our government uh... today that are
[02:26:45.860 --> 02:26:47.700]  just coincidence
[02:26:47.700 --> 02:26:49.780]  uh... however be that as a man
[02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:52.100]  uh... judge john roe was a good man
[02:26:52.100 --> 02:26:56.020]  uh... in my very first book uh... we dedicate a lot of it to what he did and
[02:26:56.020 --> 02:26:57.020]  said
[02:26:57.020 --> 02:27:00.300]  uh... on page nineteen is really is quoted
[02:27:00.300 --> 02:27:04.280]  uh... i've never seen any judge be more forthright
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:06.420]  and constitutional in a ruling
[02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:07.900]  in my life
[02:27:07.900 --> 02:27:10.460]  uh... i've been around a lot of judges
[02:27:10.460 --> 02:27:14.060]  uh... probably hundred but i've never seen anybody stand
[02:27:14.060 --> 02:27:15.820]  uh... for uh...
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:18.460]  foundational american principles
[02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:19.860]  like this man did
[02:27:19.860 --> 02:27:21.900]  uh... if it wasn't for him
[02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:24.260]  uh... i would not have made it through this
[02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:25.860]  uh... his his
[02:27:25.860 --> 02:27:26.980]  decisions
[02:27:26.980 --> 02:27:29.380]  propelled me to the supreme court
[02:27:29.380 --> 02:27:32.140]  and a lot of what he said in the original
[02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:34.100]  uh... was used then
[02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:38.300]  one thing when i was testifying at the district court level which was uh...
[02:27:38.300 --> 02:27:41.460]  the only place any of the sheriffs involved in this testified
[02:27:41.460 --> 02:27:43.060]  was at the district court
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:45.380]  in his courtroom i was testifying
[02:27:45.380 --> 02:27:47.300]  and the lawyer for the federal government
[02:27:47.300 --> 02:27:49.620]  was attacking me and cross-examining me
[02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:52.100]  and then she turned to the judge and said
[02:27:52.100 --> 02:27:55.420]  and now larry pratt can back this up to about the statistics that
[02:27:55.420 --> 02:27:57.900]  the federal government was using she said
[02:27:57.900 --> 02:27:59.820]  your honor in the first four months
[02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:01.660]  the brady bill has prevented
[02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:04.220]  two hundred and fifty thousand felons
[02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:08.980]  from getting access to guns in this country and uh...
[02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:11.540]  then i think he stopped her
[02:28:11.540 --> 02:28:12.980]  and he said
[02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:14.420]  uh... counselor
[02:28:14.420 --> 02:28:17.220]  but do not try to pretend in this courtroom
[02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:22.460]  that your statistical analysis somehow equates to constitutionality
[02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:24.580]  and then that is how scalia
[02:28:24.580 --> 02:28:27.100]  in his ultimate ruling
[02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:30.980]  no case-by-case weighing up the burdens of benefits is necessary
[02:28:30.980 --> 02:28:34.260]  such commands are fundamentally incompatible with our constitutional
[02:28:34.260 --> 02:28:35.660]  system of dual sovereignty
[02:28:35.660 --> 02:28:38.100]  in other words talking about state sovereignty
[02:28:38.100 --> 02:28:39.140]  that the states
[02:28:39.140 --> 02:28:41.580]  are not subject to federal direction
[02:28:41.580 --> 02:28:43.860]  and this whole thing is so principle
[02:28:43.860 --> 02:28:47.580]  that i had to put it in these books and of course judge john roll
[02:28:47.580 --> 02:28:49.580]  is mentioned in every one of them
[02:28:49.580 --> 02:28:50.860]  and now
[02:28:50.860 --> 02:28:52.500]  he said
[02:28:52.500 --> 02:28:57.260]  amazing and folks can find out more about those books at your website and

[02:30:10.620 --> 02:30:14.340]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company

[02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:19.620]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:24.060]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[02:30:24.060 --> 02:30:28.180]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:30:28.180 --> 02:30:31.940]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[02:33:17.660 --> 02:33:22.300]  the people that call themselves the left
[02:33:22.300 --> 02:33:25.660]  are not liberals oh they've got grassroots
[02:33:25.660 --> 02:33:30.140]  well-meaning people in the streets just like there are some republicans that
[02:33:30.140 --> 02:33:33.260]  support the patriot act in torture they're just
[02:33:33.260 --> 02:33:36.300]  weak-minded idiots but they're not conservatives
[02:33:36.300 --> 02:33:41.020]  towards washington would slap them upside the head
[02:33:41.020 --> 02:33:46.220]  but uh we have a guy who had multiple personalities clearly was completely
[02:33:46.220 --> 02:33:50.940]  insane called for violence police went to his house but didn't search it
[02:33:50.940 --> 02:33:54.940]  he dressed up like the grim reaper and burned american flags he admired
[02:33:54.940 --> 02:33:58.140]  the communist manifesto was his favorite book
[02:33:58.140 --> 02:34:03.020]  uh he was into drugs all his friends all over the news
[02:34:03.020 --> 02:34:08.220]  said he was a extreme liberal uh hardcore liberal
[02:34:08.220 --> 02:34:11.980]  but it doesn't matter uh the msnbc christ matthews
[02:34:11.980 --> 02:34:15.340]  uh others keith overman are blaming
[02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:21.740]  i'd ran i mean if they can go after that lady
[02:34:21.740 --> 02:34:24.700]  they can go after anybody i mean they want to shut down free speech and i've
[02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:28.620]  got the legislation here they have this stuff already written
[02:34:28.620 --> 02:34:35.020]  they say that any symbol or any statement that could provoke someone else
[02:34:35.020 --> 02:34:38.700]  banned that's no more first amendment it's gone
[02:34:38.700 --> 02:34:42.380]  same way they've done it in europe uh they've got bills introduced here's what
[02:34:42.380 --> 02:34:46.780]  american uh the new american magazine says atf plans
[02:34:46.780 --> 02:34:50.060]  gun registration in border states just arbitrarily
[02:34:50.060 --> 02:34:54.380]  it's all happening and as if that isn't bad enough
[02:34:54.380 --> 02:34:57.820]  leftist attack parents of murdered nine-year-old
[02:34:57.820 --> 02:35:02.460]  the classy parents came out and said don't use our daughter's death
[02:35:02.460 --> 02:35:05.820]  to restrict the second amendment free speech we played the clip earlier the
[02:35:05.820 --> 02:35:09.420]  father starts crying he says there's always going to be random
[02:35:09.420 --> 02:35:13.980]  nuts he understands that mexico's had upwards of 30 000 deaths now in the
[02:35:13.980 --> 02:35:16.860]  last two years it was 28 000s a few months ago
[02:35:16.860 --> 02:35:21.660]  it's almost over 30 000 now a lot of them mayors police chiefs you name it
[02:35:21.660 --> 02:35:25.580]  total gun ban worst crime rate in the world most dangerous place
[02:35:25.580 --> 02:35:29.020]  to be a cop in the world or a member of government
[02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:32.220]  that's on record that's not debatable in our article we wrote saturday we have
[02:35:32.220 --> 02:35:35.820]  links to the state department's own admissions
[02:35:35.820 --> 02:35:39.820]  and there's there's got to be a response i think the
[02:35:39.820 --> 02:35:42.940]  eindrand foundation that's pretty powerful should probably go after the
[02:35:42.940 --> 02:35:46.700]  southern property law center in msnbc trying to blame the murder of this
[02:35:46.700 --> 02:35:49.900]  little girl on them that i mean that's crazy
[02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:54.940]  uh david ight the new age ufo guy i mean no one could call him a right
[02:35:54.940 --> 02:35:57.180]  winger they called him an extreme right winger
[02:35:57.180 --> 02:36:00.780]  i mean i think he's got some litigation here we've got to stand up to these
[02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:03.660]  people it's like when they said if you don't want government run health care
[02:36:03.660 --> 02:36:08.620]  you're a racist that's invoking hate but i don't say take their free speech away
[02:36:08.620 --> 02:36:13.340]  i've got my free speech to point out how asinine they are now they're playing
[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:19.740]  racial politics but now aol and others are attacking
[02:36:19.740 --> 02:36:24.140]  christine taylor greens parents and really going i can't even read this
[02:36:24.140 --> 02:36:27.980]  stuff on there this article needs to get out to everybody leftist attack
[02:36:27.980 --> 02:36:34.540]  parents have murdered uh nine-year-old
[02:36:34.540 --> 02:36:41.660]  and now i found all these uh other news articles
[02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:45.820]  where the left was going after representative gabriel giffords because
[02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:50.300]  she voted against ancy polosi she was pro-second amendment pro-border control
[02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:53.260]  and she and we've got a video coming up later we have time where she told fox
[02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:57.100]  news day before she was killed a shot in the head and the federal judge killed
[02:36:57.100 --> 02:37:00.700]  before she was wounded that we need to get rid of the left right paradigm and
[02:37:00.700 --> 02:37:05.260]  follow the constitution and cut government very suspicious i want to go
[02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:12.060]  to the chairman of gun owners of america uh he joins us now executive director
[02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:16.700]  of gun owners of america gunowners dot org uh and former member of the virginia
[02:37:16.700 --> 02:37:21.820]  house of delegates uh larry pratt to get his take on this to quickly cover
[02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:26.220]  the full spectrum of of what we're facing with these people
[02:37:26.220 --> 02:37:29.980]  hi alex it's good to be with you again thank you so much for having me it's
[02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:33.660]  it's good to be here if there was ever a good to have you if there was ever any
[02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:37.340]  doubt that these so-called democrats hate the first amendment
[02:37:37.340 --> 02:37:40.700]  and the second amendment i mean they are really
[02:37:40.700 --> 02:37:43.900]  going after freedom now in the wake of this shooting
[02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:49.420]  uh by this cross-dressing grim reaper they really would like to intimidate us
[02:37:49.420 --> 02:37:53.580]  even before any legislation uh might be pushed
[02:37:53.580 --> 02:37:57.900]  into silence and i i'm not buying it when they
[02:37:57.900 --> 02:38:01.900]  ask the question i i have told reporters already today
[02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:05.820]  it's hypocrisy itself to even ask that question
[02:38:05.820 --> 02:38:09.500]  surely you know that when it was so funny
[02:38:09.500 --> 02:38:13.180]  to have a movie made how to assassinate president bush
[02:38:13.180 --> 02:38:16.620]  president clinton didn't have a word to say about that
[02:38:16.620 --> 02:38:20.220]  but when we have a pro second amendment rally on april 19th
[02:38:20.220 --> 02:38:25.100]  he's cutting us about watching our tone give me a break
[02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:29.740]  so my answer to them is for every politician that would like to come up
[02:38:29.740 --> 02:38:33.980]  with an anti-gun law like carillon uh
[02:38:33.980 --> 02:38:37.500]  McCarthy McCarthy thanks i wouldn't bring that from long island
[02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:42.140]  or this uh colleague of hers brady who wants to
[02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:46.780]  silence speech our answer to them is we're going to target you in the next
[02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:49.020]  election i want to try to take you out how do you like
[02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:52.140]  that choice of words oh you don't like it well why don't
[02:38:52.140 --> 02:38:54.940]  you go look on the southern poverty law center
[02:38:54.940 --> 02:38:58.380]  title i'm sorry you can't they took it down but they called
[02:38:58.380 --> 02:39:02.540]  for uh getting rid of the 19 democrats that voted against Pelosi
[02:39:02.540 --> 02:39:06.380]  gifords included she needs to be taken out hey come on
[02:39:06.380 --> 02:39:09.500]  this is the way people talk in politics and to
[02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:15.820]  hypocritically turn to sarah palin and to the tea party and say it was they
[02:39:15.820 --> 02:39:19.900]  that did it i'm sorry i'm not by it well what about obama saying hundreds of
[02:39:19.900 --> 02:39:23.260]  times a speech line he had and still using it
[02:39:23.260 --> 02:39:26.620]  last year was when republicans bring a knife to a
[02:39:26.620 --> 02:39:32.780]  to an event we bring guns yeah yeah now i don't think anybody really expected
[02:39:32.780 --> 02:39:35.820]  to see obama with a gun in his hand probably wouldn't know which end of it
[02:39:35.820 --> 02:39:38.940]  to hold but you know we understood he's speaking
[02:39:38.940 --> 02:39:41.900]  metaphorically he's trying to rile up his base
[02:39:41.900 --> 02:39:46.940]  he's trying to use a linsky i communist tactics to divide the country
[02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:51.500]  but not literally he's not talking about that
[02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:55.740]  well i'm getting really creeped out now chip burlett uh has gone on democracy
[02:39:55.740 --> 02:40:00.300]  now and blame myself and ron paul uh for this stuff
[02:40:00.300 --> 02:40:03.980]  everybody knows that ron paul and i and others we are part of a revolution
[02:40:03.980 --> 02:40:09.260]  restoring our republic and we're against violence we're gonna win this thing
[02:40:09.260 --> 02:40:12.860]  as long as we can keep it nonviolent but then i have all these democratic
[02:40:12.860 --> 02:40:15.580]  operatives i know you've seen it robert shepiro and others
[02:40:15.580 --> 02:40:19.660]  saying gee obama needs some kind of violence against the government
[02:40:19.660 --> 02:40:23.180]  to look like the victim you know the uh the old
[02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:26.780]  dame that wrote uh the co-author of clowered
[02:40:26.780 --> 02:40:30.940]  piven strategy uh she's 78 years old she was
[02:40:30.940 --> 02:40:35.740]  one of the lecturers at the socialist scholars conferences that obama attended
[02:40:35.740 --> 02:40:38.460]  while he was at columbia in the year two after he had
[02:40:38.460 --> 02:40:42.460]  graduated uh chic has called that was the time for
[02:40:42.460 --> 02:40:46.620]  violent revolution so somebody who had designed a strategy
[02:40:46.620 --> 02:40:50.940]  such as the financial meltdown that we had to collapse the system
[02:40:50.940 --> 02:40:53.820]  i guess she figures that well maybe they've collapsed it enough now it's
[02:40:53.820 --> 02:40:57.660]  time for violence at the heart of every socialist
[02:40:57.660 --> 02:41:01.180]  even the so-called peaceful ones like michael herrington
[02:41:01.180 --> 02:41:04.860]  well if conditions are appropriate uh violence would be okay i don't think we
[02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:07.980]  should do it now in america michael herrington said well now
[02:41:07.980 --> 02:41:12.860]  frances uh fox uh piven thinks that it would be
[02:41:12.860 --> 02:41:17.740]  appropriate so that's something that's a dirty little secret is that the violence
[02:41:17.740 --> 02:41:20.700]  that gets committed in this country and around the world
[02:41:20.700 --> 02:41:24.700]  is committed by left-wing operatives and left-wing
[02:41:24.700 --> 02:41:28.540]  well wait a minute we've suddenly seen all these videos british government
[02:41:28.540 --> 02:41:31.420]  funded showing a teacher murdering nine-year-olds
[02:41:31.420 --> 02:41:35.340]  in her class if they don't accept carbon taxes and we've seen
[02:41:35.340 --> 02:41:41.340]  one of the ipcc authors come out uh with all these other professors and say we
[02:41:41.340 --> 02:41:44.940]  need fascism we need to kill people that don't go
[02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:48.700]  along with our environmental takeover we need to get rid of democracy
[02:41:48.700 --> 02:41:52.460]  i mean they're out in the open they praise mount satung
[02:41:52.460 --> 02:41:55.820]  well thank god for uh the attorney general of virginia
[02:41:55.820 --> 02:42:00.140]  uh kuchinelli who is litigating against
[02:42:00.140 --> 02:42:04.300]  university of virginia where one of the climate fraudsters worked for a while
[02:42:04.300 --> 02:42:07.980]  to get those records so that he can further expose
[02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:13.180]  if indeed there is evidence of it uh what kind of fraudsters uh they were
[02:42:13.180 --> 02:42:17.260]  and i think these people are getting desperate because
[02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:21.100]  programs like you enable uh people like me and
[02:42:21.100 --> 02:42:24.060]  many others to communicate with the american people
[02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:27.740]  and they don't have an information monopoly that's why we're hearing all
[02:42:27.740 --> 02:42:33.820]  about these first amendment shutdown laws because they don't know what else to do
[02:42:33.820 --> 02:42:37.340]  they know they can't win a debate the only thing they can do is to call us
[02:42:37.340 --> 02:42:41.180]  racists by the way i am jealous that you were singled out by
[02:42:41.180 --> 02:42:45.660]  burtila and i wasn't included i mean you gotta be really proud
[02:42:45.660 --> 02:42:49.260]  that you were bookended with rand paul now that's
[02:42:49.260 --> 02:42:53.180]  that's pretty good stuff yeah but i mean they
[02:42:53.180 --> 02:42:57.100]  let's take rand paul they claimed he kidnapped a woman wasn't true they
[02:42:57.100 --> 02:43:01.180]  claimed he wasn't a medical doctor wasn't true uh they claimed he was
[02:43:01.180 --> 02:43:04.460]  against the civil rights act when his satellite's cutting out he says excuse
[02:43:04.460 --> 02:43:07.500]  me what'd you say and he says no i'm not
[02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:11.820]  forgetting rid of it oh yes i hear you uh no i'm not forgetting rid of it
[02:43:11.820 --> 02:43:15.100]  and then they ran with a transcript saying yes i'm forgetting rid of it when
[02:43:15.100 --> 02:43:18.940]  clearly he didn't say that but the good news is 10 years ago larry that would
[02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:21.980]  have worked that full court press demonization
[02:43:21.980 --> 02:43:25.340]  instead it made him get a boost in the polls
[02:43:25.340 --> 02:43:28.860]  when they put out the lies and that's what i think they don't realize
[02:43:28.860 --> 02:43:34.140]  they're out of ammo to use uh that type of analogy
[02:43:34.140 --> 02:43:38.460]  they're out of ammo now and no one trusts them no one believes them
[02:43:38.460 --> 02:43:42.780]  and and the fact that they would attack this poor dad and mom
[02:43:42.780 --> 02:43:45.980]  that said don't use our daughter to take more freedoms
[02:43:45.980 --> 02:43:50.780]  the fact that they would do that they they are just monsters
[02:43:50.780 --> 02:43:54.060]  and they're monsters more and more they're showing it because they're
[02:43:54.060 --> 02:43:57.420]  throwing a fit they know they're losing
[02:43:57.420 --> 02:44:01.100]  they know i mean look look at the polls 80 plus percent want to abolish your
[02:44:01.100 --> 02:44:04.780]  audit the fed now larry as you know five ten years ago
[02:44:04.780 --> 02:44:08.540]  one out of a hundred one out of 50 didn't know about the fellow reserve
[02:44:08.540 --> 02:44:12.460]  i mean in your decades fighting for liberty what type of change have you
[02:44:12.460 --> 02:44:14.940]  seen well it's the same in the second
[02:44:14.940 --> 02:44:19.660]  amendment arena we've seen a steadily increasing support for
[02:44:19.660 --> 02:44:23.340]  general gun ownership opposition to banning and guns
[02:44:23.340 --> 02:44:27.260]  and opposition to restrictions when people don't even know what gun
[02:44:27.260 --> 02:44:30.700]  control normally means they just will ask they'd be asked to use
[02:44:30.700 --> 02:44:33.820]  support gun control well that's like saying uh
[02:44:33.820 --> 02:44:38.140]  uh do you support the constitution but it's help if you've read it
[02:44:38.140 --> 02:44:41.900]  you know it's like saying do you support controlling your automobile when you go
[02:44:41.900 --> 02:44:45.020]  down the highway 99 percent would say yes but but
[02:44:45.020 --> 02:44:48.540]  they mean we're going to take your car away from you car control
[02:44:48.540 --> 02:44:53.660]  that's exactly a great analogy and so that's what we're dealing with and i
[02:44:53.660 --> 02:44:57.900]  think we've been successfully across the freedom front
[02:44:57.900 --> 02:45:01.500]  some more than others on battles better than others we're pushing them back and
[02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:04.620]  you're right they're going crazy but they're reacting
[02:45:04.620 --> 02:45:08.620]  uh to this tragedy the way vultures react to carry on
[02:45:08.620 --> 02:45:13.020]  they see a dead body and oh it's time to have more gun control time to have more
[02:45:13.020 --> 02:45:16.140]  speech control that's a new term have you seen it a
[02:45:16.140 --> 02:45:22.940]  tragedy vultures i love it but we'll uh we'll use that from here on
[02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:25.740]  because that's what they are they are despicable people
[02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:29.100]  they want to take away our freedom that caroline mccarthy
[02:45:29.100 --> 02:45:33.660]  would like the rest of the country to be as defenseless as her poor husband was
[02:45:33.660 --> 02:45:39.900]  when he was being executed on a train where nobody was allowed to have a gun
[02:45:39.900 --> 02:45:43.500]  of course the gunman didn't uh he thought that was a pretty good idea
[02:45:43.500 --> 02:45:46.940]  and brought his gun into the gunfree zone and killed a bunch of people
[02:45:46.940 --> 02:45:51.260]  and she wants to impose that kind of compulsory victimization
[02:45:51.260 --> 02:45:54.860]  victim hood on the rest of the country and by the way that was an admitted
[02:45:54.860 --> 02:45:57.980]  race crime he wanted to kill white people but that
[02:45:57.980 --> 02:46:02.220]  that's something they kept quiet same thing with this major hassan
[02:46:02.220 --> 02:46:05.740]  uh the same cnn reporters there's a big article out
[02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:09.660]  and new york times reporters said oh don't make it about what group he was
[02:46:09.660 --> 02:46:14.460]  with let's not politicize this all these dead people so see
[02:46:14.460 --> 02:46:18.620]  they're just despicable and they don't they've never said uh anything about
[02:46:18.620 --> 02:46:23.180]  Islam when you go back to the robert kennedy assassination
[02:46:23.180 --> 02:46:26.700]  that arguably was the first act of jihad in
[02:46:26.700 --> 02:46:29.420]  the united states certainly in that century anyway
[02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:33.980]  um because that's exactly what that disgruntled palestinian was doing
[02:46:33.980 --> 02:46:38.380]  and the only people that didn't find out about it were the american people
[02:46:38.380 --> 02:46:42.460]  because the media sat on it and then they could sit on things
[02:46:42.460 --> 02:46:46.220]  only in the last few years with the internet and
[02:46:46.220 --> 02:46:49.900]  talk radio are we able to find out things like that
[02:46:49.900 --> 02:46:53.740]  the world is more interesting than we've thought
[02:46:53.740 --> 02:46:57.660]  well and of course going back it's funny the sir hand sir hand there's two ways
[02:46:57.660 --> 02:47:02.540]  to look at it the first act of jihad or as the coroner said somebody else had
[02:47:02.540 --> 02:47:05.500]  shot from behind almost at point blank range we were talking
[02:47:05.500 --> 02:47:08.220]  about that earlier dealing with mind control
[02:47:08.220 --> 02:47:13.020]  larry print where do you see this going because uh you've got a pro-gun democrat
[02:47:13.020 --> 02:47:16.940]  shot in the head thank god lived and she's responding and i think she'll make
[02:47:16.940 --> 02:47:20.060]  almost a complete recovery we can all cross our fingers and say a prayer
[02:47:20.060 --> 02:47:24.860]  but this judge role he was the guy that for those that don't know
[02:47:24.860 --> 02:47:30.860]  who delivered the big brady bill uh uh victory with with with sheriff richard
[02:47:30.860 --> 02:47:33.500]  mack i mean i mean if this guy was a right wing tea
[02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:36.300]  partier when he's not dressed up like the grim reaper
[02:47:36.300 --> 02:47:40.860]  devil worshipping or dressed up like a woman or you know stoned out of his
[02:47:40.860 --> 02:47:43.580]  gourd playing video games i mean there's no evidence he's a
[02:47:43.580 --> 02:47:46.940]  conservative but let's just say he is because it's more fun that way
[02:47:46.940 --> 02:47:50.540]  but i mean if if if he was going out to kill
[02:47:50.540 --> 02:47:53.820]  left-wingers boy he sure found the right the wrong ones
[02:47:53.820 --> 02:47:58.460]  yeah exactly now i am i don't think this is going to go
[02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:02.300]  after virginia tech the issue had pretty well settled down
[02:48:02.300 --> 02:48:06.380]  and then the n r a went wobbly again of carlin mccarthy bill
[02:48:06.380 --> 02:48:11.820]  this time because the n r a endorsed so many of these so-called blue dogs
[02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:15.420]  including gifords but she only got a d on our rating
[02:48:15.420 --> 02:48:19.100]  she told you she was pro-second amendment but don't look at how i vote
[02:48:19.100 --> 02:48:23.420]  you know and so we we backed her opponent in there she's a lovely lady
[02:48:23.420 --> 02:48:26.460]  but that's not the qualification for being in congress
[02:48:26.460 --> 02:48:32.540]  and we backed a number of the upstarts of the insurgents who took out a lot of
[02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:34.860]  these so-called blue dog democrats that were
[02:48:34.860 --> 02:48:38.700]  demonstrably lap dogs for Nancy Pelosi
[02:48:38.700 --> 02:48:43.100]  well the n r a endorsed all of those people and they are now in kind of the
[02:48:43.100 --> 02:48:47.260]  doghouse uh with baner and cantor and it gave them a
[02:48:47.260 --> 02:48:52.060]  chance to see that oh n r a is not really our friend
[02:48:52.060 --> 02:48:56.780]  not the friend of the second amendment either so i i honestly believe that now
[02:48:56.780 --> 02:49:00.540]  if the n r a wants to go wobbly on this the leadership is not going to listen
[02:49:00.540 --> 02:49:05.420]  to them they've lost their credit
[02:49:05.420 --> 02:49:08.940]  well the pendulum swinging not just on the second amendment i see abortion
[02:49:08.940 --> 02:49:11.820]  statistics you go back to rovey wade it was about
[02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:19.020]  on average 55 45 55 pro-abortion 45 percent uh against because they use
[02:49:19.020 --> 02:49:23.900]  lies in the media and said it's a blob of tissue now i see the numbers a decade
[02:49:23.900 --> 02:49:28.700]  ago flipped 55 against 45 uh four now i see
[02:49:28.700 --> 02:49:32.460]  numbers of over 70 percent and over 80 percent
[02:49:32.460 --> 02:49:36.140]  with people under 20 i mean it just isn't working anymore
[02:49:36.140 --> 02:49:39.900]  now because on the internet you can see pictures of aborted
[02:49:39.900 --> 02:49:43.820]  babies and it's pretty grizzly stuff and uh
[02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:47.340]  you you also have the increasing use of sonogram so that
[02:49:47.340 --> 02:49:51.740]  the mother considering an abortion can see that oh that doesn't look like a
[02:49:51.740 --> 02:49:56.300]  glob of conception to me that looks like a baby
[02:49:56.300 --> 02:49:59.980]  so yeah there's all kinds of areas where we're pushing back
[02:49:59.980 --> 02:50:05.260]  and i think it's uh exciting time and i'm in a way i'm glad that mccarthy and
[02:50:05.260 --> 02:50:09.180]  some of these others are attacking because it gives us a chance to duke it
[02:50:09.180 --> 02:50:11.900]  out with them i think we can this is the way we're
[02:50:11.900 --> 02:50:15.900]  going to beat them in the arena of the debate of ideas
[02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:19.980]  they lose and the only card they've got left is their race card their right
[02:50:19.980 --> 02:50:22.940]  wing extremist card and the message that comes back
[02:50:22.940 --> 02:50:26.860]  electronically is i'm sorry but your card has expired
[02:50:26.860 --> 02:50:31.580]  i'm not able to accept it yeah people aren't buying it anymore
[02:50:31.580 --> 02:50:34.620]  we're going to come back and we'll get your take i want to read some of this
[02:50:34.620 --> 02:50:39.900]  uh where aol has a column attacking the parents of the dead girl
[02:50:39.900 --> 02:50:43.580]  i mean if there is no end to the indecency
[02:50:43.580 --> 02:50:51.420]  the low-lifeness of these slimy collectivist trash people
[02:50:51.420 --> 02:50:55.180]  who who just hate the second amendment they're so domesticated
[02:50:55.180 --> 02:50:58.780]  they were brought up so weak that they're scared of guns they're scared of
[02:50:58.780 --> 02:51:01.340]  private property they're scared of the family
[02:51:01.340 --> 02:51:05.100]  is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys
[02:51:05.100 --> 02:51:09.100]  18 years ago we developed a program that has made thousands debt free in just
[02:51:09.100 --> 02:51:11.980]  90 days it's called zero debt in 90 days

[02:51:16.140 --> 02:51:20.300]  when i first joined i was being sued so i used the program methods
[02:51:20.300 --> 02:51:24.860]  and after filing one piece of paper the collection lawsuit was dismissed with
[02:51:24.860 --> 02:51:28.060]  zero debt in 90 days your success is guaranteed in writing
[02:51:28.060 --> 02:51:31.660]  there is no other program of its kind don't be alone when creditors gang up

[02:52:10.300 --> 02:52:14.540]  agenda that will be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[02:52:14.540 --> 02:52:18.620]  i have tremendous influence on our president in congress

[02:54:35.820 --> 02:54:40.140]  yeah we dare criticize all the corruption but going back to leary pratt
[02:54:40.140 --> 02:54:44.300]  i'm seeing a lot of bizarre activity here's the headline leftist attack
[02:54:44.300 --> 02:54:49.100]  parents of murdered nine-year-old the dignity and class of the parents of
[02:54:49.100 --> 02:54:52.380]  christina taylor green does not fit neatly into the partisan
[02:54:52.380 --> 02:54:57.900]  political script and then it goes into an article in aol
[02:54:57.900 --> 02:55:05.180]  by uh genie sager uh attacking the family
[02:55:05.180 --> 02:55:14.300]  and uh saying they don't deserve to be parents
[02:55:16.220 --> 02:55:21.820]  wow i mean so that means that if they have any other children
[02:55:21.820 --> 02:55:26.940]  the social workers should come and grab the children out of that home
[02:55:26.940 --> 02:55:31.580]  that's really what they're saying what lovely people
[02:55:35.500 --> 02:55:38.540]  rather than say hey you know this guy just wants to be
[02:55:38.540 --> 02:55:43.740]  this family wants to be left alone it's bad enough that their daughter was
[02:55:43.740 --> 02:55:51.340]  killed by a monster and now they have to put up with a bunch of vultures
[02:55:51.340 --> 02:55:53.500]  and that's all they're saying they're going there's always going to be
[02:55:53.500 --> 02:55:57.980]  crazies there's almost seven billion people there's 310 million in this
[02:55:57.980 --> 02:56:00.460]  country you're going to have bad stuff happen
[02:56:00.460 --> 02:56:04.060]  300 000 die year in car wrecks we don't stop driving cars
[02:56:04.060 --> 02:56:08.300]  i mean sorry sorry she's dead but that's not the second amendment's fault
[02:56:08.300 --> 02:56:13.260]  exactly right in fact the problem is that nobody at the scene of the crime
[02:56:13.260 --> 02:56:16.300]  had a gun there was a guy that came onto the scene
[02:56:16.300 --> 02:56:19.740]  from a nearby store but by the time he got there
[02:56:19.740 --> 02:56:23.500]  the puke was already down and he helped to subdue the guy
[02:56:23.500 --> 02:56:27.100]  but nobody who might have been able to
[02:56:27.100 --> 02:56:31.260]  actually respond while the 10 to 12 seconds were elapsing
[02:56:31.260 --> 02:56:34.620]  you know nobody there had a gun i gotta say it's a good thing i'm not a cop
[02:56:34.620 --> 02:56:37.100]  and it's a good thing i wasn't there because it's not like i'm some tough
[02:56:37.100 --> 02:56:39.820]  guy but if i saw dead people for no reason and a
[02:56:39.820 --> 02:56:44.540]  shot kid i mean i i mean on top of that Alex when
[02:56:44.540 --> 02:56:47.660]  when all this was happening and this guy was being subdued
[02:56:47.660 --> 02:56:51.260]  he was trying to load another magazine fresh
[02:56:51.260 --> 02:56:54.940]  rounds into his gun so he wanted to keep on killing
[02:56:54.940 --> 02:56:58.300]  there would have been every reason to take him out of the gene pool
[02:56:58.300 --> 02:57:03.500]  right at that moment no i agree i um
[02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:07.340]  i just can't imagine people that get off on senseless murder and you know it's a
[02:57:07.340 --> 02:57:11.820]  growing subculture that's into death and dressing in black and
[02:57:11.820 --> 02:57:15.660]  and all these songs about how great murdering children is and
[02:57:15.660 --> 02:57:19.180]  you know what he's going to find out in a supermax prison what what evils really
[02:57:19.180 --> 02:57:22.380]  like though hopefully he won't be there too long
[02:57:22.380 --> 02:57:26.780]  i hope they're going to take him on a gurney and shoot him up he likes to
[02:57:26.780 --> 02:57:31.420]  put stuff into his body well they can do that for him
[02:57:31.420 --> 02:57:35.340]  larry pratt goners dot org and valuable information there now's the time for

[02:57:44.140 --> 02:57:48.860]  what about this atf de facto registration in the southwest
[02:57:48.860 --> 02:57:52.300]  um it's actually blown up in their face it looks like some of the
[02:57:52.300 --> 02:57:55.900]  guns that some of the atf agents were sending south of the border with
[02:57:55.900 --> 02:57:59.340]  informants one of them may well have been a gun that
[02:57:59.340 --> 02:58:04.380]  was used to kill the border patrol agent but they've been trying to run up the
[02:58:04.380 --> 02:58:07.820]  the numbers so that they can trace more guns that have come from the united
[02:58:07.820 --> 02:58:10.540]  state well some of those numbers then apparently
[02:58:10.540 --> 02:58:18.220]  are coming from atf themselves that's what kind of flea these people are
[02:58:18.220 --> 02:58:22.140]  absolutely well a navy seal got caught selling hand grenades to the mexican
[02:58:22.140 --> 02:58:25.740]  mafia but that's not the navy's fault i mean that's a criminal

[03:02:20.940 --> 03:02:24.620]  black powder guns with no record and that's why they hate them
[03:02:24.620 --> 03:02:27.980]  because you know they do not want an armed population and folks that's some
[03:02:27.980 --> 03:02:30.620]  of the best guns to buy that are off record

[03:08:12.540 --> 03:08:17.420]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen and i've got a special message directly to
[03:08:17.420 --> 03:08:20.620]  the globalist and the gun grabbers coming up at 33 after
[03:08:20.620 --> 03:08:23.900]  we're continuing with open phones throughout this fourth hour
[03:08:23.900 --> 03:08:28.540]  he just joined us in the last segment a caller randy in texas was reading a
[03:08:28.540 --> 03:08:32.620]  lengthy but also very good poem i want him to finish up the last few lines
[03:08:32.620 --> 03:08:35.020]  up and then tell us the name of it maybe he'll
[03:08:35.020 --> 03:08:38.940]  email it to us or to somebody else we can get it up on a website so folks can
[03:08:38.940 --> 03:08:42.540]  i can read it but uh go ahead and finish your poem randy
[03:08:42.540 --> 03:08:46.380]  thanks alex uh the laugh okay we got to i'm starting
[03:08:46.380 --> 03:08:50.300]  at the poem is we're going to need each other before it's all through the last
[03:08:50.300 --> 03:08:54.540]  lines are i'm starting to worry about what is in store
[03:08:54.540 --> 03:08:59.820]  reality is getting much harder to see i thought i got that from the man on tv
[03:08:59.820 --> 03:09:04.220]  i can tell that the news isn't news anymore and the only news left is a
[03:09:04.220 --> 03:09:08.220]  football team score these words fell out on my paper
[03:09:08.220 --> 03:09:11.820]  today and you asked me so what are you trying to say
[03:09:11.820 --> 03:09:16.460]  and when you ask me okay what should we do we're going to need each other
[03:09:16.460 --> 03:09:20.620]  before it's all through well well said i tell you they haven't released the
[03:09:20.620 --> 03:09:24.380]  surveillance footage of the shooting yet which i find to be very suspicious
[03:09:24.380 --> 03:09:28.940]  we've got reports of other shooters uh somebody responding and trying to stop
[03:09:28.940 --> 03:09:32.220]  him with a gun i mean who knows even what we're
[03:09:32.220 --> 03:09:36.140]  being told is true but looking at the photograph of this guy and looking at
[03:09:36.140 --> 03:09:40.300]  the um devil worship shrine you know the offerings of
[03:09:40.300 --> 03:09:44.460]  oranges to the skull uh the grim reaper behavior uh
[03:09:44.460 --> 03:09:48.220]  it's just nihilistic uh sickeningness that
[03:09:48.220 --> 03:09:52.140]  is pushed by the culture and the literature with young people i i'm not
[03:09:52.140 --> 03:09:56.220]  calling uh for that literature to be curtailed or censored
[03:09:56.220 --> 03:10:00.540]  but you know they they're not going to take my free speech away
[03:10:00.540 --> 03:10:05.020]  we need to counter their evil with our free speech of the truth
[03:10:05.020 --> 03:10:08.860]  and and and that's the antidote to all of this uh
[03:10:08.860 --> 03:10:14.700]  randy good to hear from you mark in florida mark you're on the air go ahead
[03:10:15.260 --> 03:10:20.140]  hey thanks for taking my call um my thing is that you guys keep mentioning it
[03:10:20.140 --> 03:10:25.260]  and talking about it uh the shooter had on his youtube
[03:10:25.260 --> 03:10:32.060]  a student that said what are what good are words if they have no meaning to
[03:10:32.060 --> 03:10:35.580]  government and you guys have uh talked all about this how
[03:10:35.580 --> 03:10:39.340]  government says one thing and does another an example would be
[03:10:39.340 --> 03:10:43.260]  how government says education is important that's why we're going to
[03:10:43.260 --> 03:10:46.540]  appoint a gun at you and seize your house to pay for it
[03:10:46.540 --> 03:10:50.940]  and it seems to me that the shooter was
[03:10:50.940 --> 03:10:55.020]  trying to find the truth somehow some way and he just wasn't
[03:10:55.020 --> 03:10:59.020]  he just didn't have the mental ability to do it and he lost it and that's what
[03:10:59.020 --> 03:11:02.460]  i'm thinking well he was into everything nazism
[03:11:02.460 --> 03:11:08.380]  communism uh wanting to be a woman uh but the main body of his work is kind of
[03:11:08.380 --> 03:11:11.740]  a classic uh mainline modern which would be the
[03:11:11.740 --> 03:11:16.060]  opposite of classic uh liberal but uh you know he talked
[03:11:16.060 --> 03:11:19.980]  about mind control not only in those videos new york daily news and others
[03:11:19.980 --> 03:11:22.780]  are quoting people in the classrooms he'd come in and say do you know about
[03:11:22.780 --> 03:11:26.380]  mind control or other articles i'm under mind control
[03:11:26.380 --> 03:11:30.620]  and whether he was just a paranoid schizophrenic or was under mind control
[03:11:30.620 --> 03:11:35.100]  we know mind control is real uh we know that the people that were targeted i
[03:11:35.100 --> 03:11:39.980]  mean this is out of central casting a nine-year-old girl gets blasted a
[03:11:39.980 --> 03:11:44.060]  federal judge who's pro-second amendment um
[03:11:44.060 --> 03:11:48.300]  and was in a key case i mean my gut everything tells me this stinks to high
[03:11:48.300 --> 03:11:51.820]  heaven and uh
[03:11:51.820 --> 03:11:57.020]  you know this scrambled brain guy uh you know we need to see all the records on
[03:11:57.020 --> 03:11:59.980]  him but they're trying to keep that very close to their vest why haven't we
[03:11:59.980 --> 03:12:03.900]  seen the video the shooting yet what are they editing something
[03:12:03.900 --> 03:12:07.260]  i mean again it's just all of it begins to add together and we know their
[03:12:07.260 --> 03:12:11.020]  history of staging things they stage the gulf of tonkin
[03:12:11.020 --> 03:12:15.100]  they stage hundreds of bombings in europe to blame on their political enemies
[03:12:15.100 --> 03:12:20.780]  they do this i mean operation north woods and i i appreciate your call mark
[03:12:20.780 --> 03:12:23.660]  that guys just just google operation north woods
[03:12:23.660 --> 03:12:27.100]  abc news u.s government plan to terrorize us cities
[03:12:27.100 --> 03:12:30.460]  or pull up the national security archive you'll actually get the document when
[03:12:30.460 --> 03:12:33.900]  you search it and you can show people operation north woods joint chiefs of
[03:12:33.900 --> 03:12:38.380]  staff green lighted plan how to commit sniper attack shootings
[03:12:38.380 --> 03:12:46.380]  in dc maryland miami and other areas and how to even blame patsies
[03:12:46.380 --> 03:12:50.380]  how to have multiple shooters on site how to tackle one guy say they did it
[03:12:50.380 --> 03:12:53.980]  we don't know that's the problem but we do know they're hyping it
[03:12:53.980 --> 03:12:57.100]  and using it to try to take our second amendment our free speech
[03:12:57.100 --> 03:13:02.860]  which is treason and is illogical unless you're retiring
[03:13:02.860 --> 03:13:07.340]  amy in michigan you're on the air go ahead hello ellis it's a pleasure to
[03:13:07.340 --> 03:13:10.700]  talk to you to talk to you um thank you first of
[03:13:10.700 --> 03:13:14.060]  all i want to say that you're an inspiration to all of us
[03:13:14.060 --> 03:13:17.580]  to find our voices and to stand up for the wrongs that we see going on
[03:13:17.580 --> 03:13:22.700]  every day um my comment is about the first report to the second suspect in
[03:13:22.700 --> 03:13:26.460]  the shootings when i first saw him i immediately
[03:13:26.460 --> 03:13:30.140]  noticed that he bears an uncanny resemblance to the person who you
[03:13:30.140 --> 03:13:34.940]  pointed out that might be the fbi informant from the hutari scene
[03:13:34.940 --> 03:13:39.180]  i'm from the area of the hutari sting so their faces have been everywhere i was
[03:13:39.180 --> 03:13:44.700]  just wondering if you've noticed that no i haven't i mean i guess they're both
[03:13:44.700 --> 03:13:48.620]  kind of deli-faced white males i get but i think
[03:13:48.620 --> 03:13:51.980]  the so-called individuals you're talking about
[03:13:51.980 --> 03:13:55.980]  were in custody and then released i mean but who knows we know now from federal
[03:13:55.980 --> 03:14:00.700]  documents big vay was an operative once he got out of the military
[03:14:00.700 --> 03:14:04.620]  but actually if you guys with the document cam shoot across uh here i can
[03:14:04.620 --> 03:14:08.220]  show folks operation north woods i've got it up on screen just type in

[03:14:15.420 --> 03:14:18.460]  chairman joint chiefs of staff l l limnitzer
[03:14:18.460 --> 03:14:23.260]  and um you can just go read it all for yourself
[03:14:23.260 --> 03:14:26.940]  uh in fact i'll i mean deeper in the document it talks about how to
[03:14:26.940 --> 03:14:34.300]  how to stage um how to stage shootings and i mean i mean this is our
[03:14:34.300 --> 03:14:38.060]  government for anybody that wants to look it up for themselves
[03:14:38.060 --> 03:14:44.060]  anything else that you'd like to add amy no thank you i just want to i just

[03:14:58.540 --> 03:15:01.100]  i mean what else are we supposed to do these people are criminals they've got
[03:15:01.100 --> 03:15:08.620]  to be dealt with um thank you though uh let's go ahead uh and
[03:15:08.620 --> 03:15:11.900]  cover this article i was just given administration to world
[03:15:11.900 --> 03:15:16.700]  arizona shooting shows we have extremists too
[03:15:16.700 --> 03:15:20.700]  well we've known that the mayak and homeland security reports say that
[03:15:20.700 --> 03:15:23.980]  homeland security is really for gun owners veterans
[03:15:23.980 --> 03:15:29.500]  returning veterans um libertarians ron paul supporters and they're now on
[03:15:29.500 --> 03:15:33.740]  democracy now we have the clip it's going up on info wars in prison planet
[03:15:33.740 --> 03:15:38.220]  saying it's my fault and the paul family i guess it's we're evil
[03:15:38.220 --> 03:15:41.260]  because we want our republic we want what's in the bill of rights of
[03:15:41.260 --> 03:15:45.660]  constitution and we want it now and so when the government does
[03:15:45.660 --> 03:15:50.540]  things that are wrong and you criticize it if some lunatic
[03:15:50.540 --> 03:15:55.900]  with a devil worship shrine in his backyard goes and shoots somebody it's
[03:15:55.900 --> 03:16:00.060]  our fault no it's not my fault and you're the ones putting out
[03:16:00.060 --> 03:16:03.580]  environmental videos showing children being murdered and making it cute that
[03:16:03.580 --> 03:16:08.220]  human beings have no value we're going to get that report out on info wars
[03:16:08.220 --> 03:16:13.900]  dot com and present by the dot com if not today tomorrow i have had it
[03:16:13.900 --> 03:16:19.180]  in an effort aimed at solidarity notice how that's a lie right there it's
[03:16:19.180 --> 03:16:22.220]  solidarity secretary of state hillary clinton the one that blamed
[03:16:22.220 --> 03:16:26.140]  oklahoma city on rush limbaugh remember that when they they were behind it
[03:16:26.140 --> 03:16:29.500]  clearly and an effort aimed at solidarity secretary of state hillary
[03:16:29.500 --> 03:16:32.700]  clinton on monday linked the weekend shooting of 20 people in arizona
[03:16:32.700 --> 03:16:36.540]  grocery store to extremism faith in other countries a comparison that some
[03:16:36.540 --> 03:16:39.820]  observers say may not live up to the facts of the case
[03:16:39.820 --> 03:16:44.060]  yeah a paranoid schizophrenic any way you slice it
[03:16:44.060 --> 03:16:48.140]  who's got all these different personalities of a woman a liberal that
[03:16:48.140 --> 03:16:52.780]  helps puppy dogs at the local pound
[03:16:52.780 --> 03:16:57.260]  a grim reaper a devil worshipper and a quote
[03:16:57.260 --> 03:17:00.220]  hardcore liberal
[03:17:03.340 --> 03:17:06.540]  you talk about lies what about the government medias lies about wmds in
[03:17:06.540 --> 03:17:10.940]  iraq and all the millions dead through that over a million dead in iraq
[03:17:10.940 --> 03:17:14.300]  that was three years ago lands at british medical journal
[03:17:14.300 --> 03:17:17.580]  and what about you with all the blood on your hands they just want to grandstand
[03:17:17.580 --> 03:17:20.620]  and go look at the little girl and the father comes out and the mother says
[03:17:20.620 --> 03:17:22.780]  don't use our little girl to take more freedom
[03:17:22.780 --> 03:17:27.420]  you see what happened after 9 11 in the airports losing our freedoms
[03:17:27.420 --> 03:17:30.060]  we ought to try to get that father and everybody in the world is but i got a
[03:17:30.060 --> 03:17:34.380]  stinking suspicion we get him on he's going to be a patriot
[03:17:34.380 --> 03:17:37.260]  he said don't use it to take our second amendment don't use it to take our
[03:17:37.260 --> 03:17:41.180]  rights and they're now attacking them attacking their
[03:17:41.180 --> 03:17:45.180]  family right now that's how sickening these people are because they want to
[03:17:45.180 --> 03:17:48.940]  use her to set up their tyranny and they can't stand it
[03:17:48.940 --> 03:17:54.060]  and there's nobody they won't attack in that mission
[03:17:54.060 --> 03:17:56.780]  during the town hall and abu dhabi monday clinton
[03:17:56.780 --> 03:18:02.860]  who's on a trip to qatar oman and the united arab emirates was speaking
[03:18:02.860 --> 03:18:08.460]  during a forum on women's issues look we have extremists in this country so
[03:18:08.460 --> 03:18:14.380]  it just goes on from there i've just had enough of these people
[03:18:14.380 --> 03:18:18.060]  and that made me angry out there so you can see where they're going with this
[03:18:18.060 --> 03:18:21.500]  meanwhile you're looking at the lady whose administration in 95 carried out
[03:18:21.500 --> 03:18:24.380]  that bombing and that takes hours to get into the evidence but it's an
[03:18:24.380 --> 03:18:28.140]  absolute fact a bunch of terrorists who don't say
[03:18:28.140 --> 03:18:34.940]  that they could excite violence you are terrorist you are a criminal government
[03:18:34.940 --> 03:18:39.340]  let's talk to george in connecticut george you're on the air go ahead
[03:18:39.340 --> 03:18:43.900]  alex um i think it's important that uh somehow we maybe put something up to
[03:18:43.900 --> 03:18:48.380]  focus in on uh the judge i suspect that there was a second
[03:18:48.380 --> 03:18:52.460]  shooter because this is too unusual not only did this guy shoot
[03:18:52.460 --> 03:18:57.420]  uh do a 341 you know our our constitution and two
[03:18:57.420 --> 03:19:01.420]  probable probable patriots uh but it just
[03:19:01.420 --> 03:19:05.420]  unlikely that no matter what happened there that he could have gotten
[03:19:05.420 --> 03:19:09.660]  all three so i would suspect the ballistics on that on the judge would
[03:19:09.660 --> 03:19:13.260]  be uh different from the from the ones that will be a general thing
[03:19:13.260 --> 03:19:19.900]  oh it's got fired 18 times and uh killed six and wounded the other 12
[03:19:19.900 --> 03:19:23.340]  i mean that's pretty that's precision shooting right there
[03:19:23.340 --> 03:19:29.340]  right right um uh and and far as uh you know going after our guns this i have
[03:19:29.340 --> 03:19:33.580]  a little uh a ditty here too from uh that came from a liberal station
[03:19:33.580 --> 03:19:37.980]  that was pro gun and says doctors versus gun owners says there are
[03:19:37.980 --> 03:19:42.140]  are 700 000 positions in the united states accidental
[03:19:42.140 --> 03:19:45.580]  deaths caused by physicians per year is 200 000
[03:19:45.580 --> 03:19:51.020]  seven point seven uh uh i get point stay there i don't want to cut into
[03:19:51.020 --> 03:19:54.940]  your statistics by the way that physicians killing 200 000 a year that's a
[03:19:54.940 --> 03:19:58.220]  very low number my number is more like half a million
[03:19:58.220 --> 03:20:01.500]  uh we'll be right back
[03:20:01.580 --> 03:20:05.180]  alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over
[03:20:05.180 --> 03:20:10.380]  it ended on june of 2009 the millions of americans unable to find work might not
[03:20:10.380 --> 03:20:13.580]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government
[03:20:13.580 --> 03:20:16.860]  employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse
[03:20:16.860 --> 03:20:20.300]  gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their long
[03:20:20.300 --> 03:20:23.820]  expected journey to the moon in addition to converting your shrinking
[03:20:23.820 --> 03:20:27.500]  dollars into gold and silver you should consider a food savings account from
[03:20:27.500 --> 03:20:30.780]  e-foods direct they both make fabulous investments

[03:25:18.620 --> 03:25:21.340]  this was a member of the quote ruling class
[03:25:21.340 --> 03:25:25.980]  there's only 500 and something members of congress and that message scares them
[03:25:25.980 --> 03:25:28.540]  and i'm going to talk about that coming up in the next segment
[03:25:28.540 --> 03:25:32.460]  and so for whatever reasons that this was done it was meant to spur

[03:25:36.860 --> 03:25:40.460]  that's why i believe this was staged they're like oh we've tried to kill
[03:25:40.460 --> 03:25:44.620]  school kids we've gone into mcdonald's and had our assassin's kill people
[03:25:44.620 --> 03:25:49.660]  we've had theodore kazinsky who was in cia mind control that's admitted i mean
[03:25:49.660 --> 03:25:53.020]  admitted but it's like just a little side issue
[03:25:53.020 --> 03:25:57.580]  you know we've had him go in and bomb ceo's we just can't get folks behind
[03:25:57.580 --> 03:26:00.860]  police state start killing members of congress

[03:26:10.780 --> 03:26:14.700]  the world is dangerous things like that can happen
[03:26:14.700 --> 03:26:18.780]  and being a public figure that goes with the territory you could be carjacked

[03:33:47.420 --> 03:33:54.700]  your activity your seizing on every crisis like
[03:33:54.700 --> 03:33:59.980]  tragedy vultures has become obvious to everyone
[03:33:59.980 --> 03:34:04.300]  and now we've seen this poor congresswoman
[03:34:04.300 --> 03:34:10.300]  gilford's shot but thank god she's alive and starting to recover this poor
[03:34:10.300 --> 03:34:14.860]  federal judge rolls this little girl this nine-year-old
[03:34:14.860 --> 03:34:20.060]  named green being killed and her father and mother come out and
[03:34:20.060 --> 03:34:23.500]  say don't politicize this don't use this to take
[03:34:23.500 --> 03:34:27.420]  more of our freedoms the father talked about how he travels a lot and how
[03:34:27.420 --> 03:34:30.700]  hellish the airports are and he said don't take our freedoms
[03:34:30.700 --> 03:34:35.340]  don't go after our second amendment and now aol columnist and others have
[03:34:35.340 --> 03:34:38.620]  viciously attacked the parents saying they don't deserve
[03:34:38.620 --> 03:34:43.100]  to have their little girl i can't believe i'm reading stuff like this
[03:34:43.100 --> 03:34:47.020]  the truth is the democrats predominantly and the environmental
[03:34:47.020 --> 03:34:51.260]  movement have been financing movies and tv shows
[03:34:51.260 --> 03:34:54.620]  in england and the us that show nine-year-olds
[03:34:54.620 --> 03:35:00.460]  in a school being fictitiously murdered because they don't sign on to their
[03:35:00.460 --> 03:35:03.980]  carbon taxes the truth is we're taught how worthless
[03:35:03.980 --> 03:35:09.020]  humanity is and how bad humanity is for the earth every day
[03:35:09.020 --> 03:35:15.020]  the truth is with this deranged shooter this guy
[03:35:15.020 --> 03:35:19.180]  was shooting videos of the grim reaper burning the american flag with
[03:35:19.180 --> 03:35:22.940]  devilish music in the background a day before it came out that he was into the
[03:35:22.940 --> 03:35:27.740]  occult i said this is one of these vampire obsessed nihilistic
[03:35:27.740 --> 03:35:31.740]  you know people that's into satanism and now his friends are saying
[03:35:31.740 --> 03:35:35.020]  he was nihilistic he was into death he had this
[03:35:35.020 --> 03:35:41.260]  shrine behind his house with a skull and black magic voodoo offerings of oranges
[03:35:41.260 --> 03:35:45.260]  that's what voodoo is the black magic variety of it
[03:35:45.260 --> 03:35:48.780]  or the black magic variety of sanaria this guy loved
[03:35:48.780 --> 03:35:52.860]  carl marx this guy loved anything dark and destructive
[03:35:52.860 --> 03:35:56.380]  he thought he was a woman he obviously had multiple
[03:35:56.380 --> 03:35:59.900]  personalities and that's why we need our second amendment
[03:35:59.900 --> 03:36:04.060]  to defend ourselves from people like him but now we see this full frontal
[03:36:04.060 --> 03:36:08.620]  assault by hillary and bill clinton by all these other congress people
[03:36:08.620 --> 03:36:13.180]  blaming talk radio blaming the alternative media calling for censorship
[03:36:13.180 --> 03:36:16.380]  on the web calling for people to be arrested
[03:36:16.380 --> 03:36:21.660]  who put out any symbols or say anything that could influence someone else
[03:36:21.660 --> 03:36:25.500]  to do violence that's a full frontal attack
[03:36:25.500 --> 03:36:30.780]  on the first amendment now the system is really upset and scared by this because
[03:36:30.780 --> 03:36:33.340]  a member of the power structure in fact two of them
[03:36:33.340 --> 03:36:37.340]  a congressperson was shot and seriously wounded in the head
[03:36:37.340 --> 03:36:40.940]  and a federal judge was murdered and i would add that
[03:36:40.940 --> 03:36:46.540]  judge rolls of course was the judge who was instrumental
[03:36:46.540 --> 03:36:51.100]  in defeating the brady bill the five-day waiting period
[03:36:51.100 --> 03:36:54.380]  with sheriff richard mac who we've now interviewed on the subject
[03:36:54.380 --> 03:36:59.180]  and was a staunch supporter of the second amendment so was this poor congresswoman
[03:36:59.180 --> 03:37:03.820]  she was also for controlling the border and the media is doing everything it
[03:37:03.820 --> 03:37:08.060]  can the dinosaur media to spin this and claim that
[03:37:08.060 --> 03:37:11.100]  this is what libertarians and conservatives have caused
[03:37:11.100 --> 03:37:15.100]  democracy now has now come out and said that the you know ron paul
[03:37:15.100 --> 03:37:22.220]  rand paul alex jones that we're to blame for all of this this is outrageous
[03:37:22.220 --> 03:37:25.740]  my friends this is an attack on free speech
[03:37:25.740 --> 03:37:31.100]  not just the right to keep bare arms and i want to make this clear
[03:37:31.100 --> 03:37:35.900]  i don't want a violent confrontation with the side of control government
[03:37:35.900 --> 03:37:40.620]  but both parties are predominantly controlled offshore banks
[03:37:40.620 --> 03:37:45.820]  tens of trillions of dollars have been stolen from our treasury
[03:37:45.820 --> 03:37:49.420]  henry polson did threaten marshal law to congress
[03:37:49.420 --> 03:37:52.620]  through the executive if they didn't give him unlimited trillions
[03:37:52.620 --> 03:37:56.380]  the obama people have continued what bush was up to
[03:37:56.380 --> 03:38:00.380]  the dollar is being devalued we are going into a private corporate world
[03:38:00.380 --> 03:38:02.860]  government and the media is saying that if you
[03:38:02.860 --> 03:38:05.980]  talk about that you support the cold-blooded shooting
[03:38:05.980 --> 03:38:10.860]  of that nine-year-old girl the federal judge and the congresswoman gilfords
[03:38:10.860 --> 03:38:15.020]  it's just asinine the truth is the mainstream media has been discredited
[03:38:15.020 --> 03:38:18.220]  the truth is there is a global private corporate empire that she used the
[03:38:18.220 --> 03:38:21.260]  united states as its muscle and as its credit card
[03:38:21.260 --> 03:38:25.260]  and the truth is the america people and the people of the world are waking up
[03:38:25.260 --> 03:38:28.620]  and coming together politically as congresswoman
[03:38:28.620 --> 03:38:32.300]  gilfords had said on fox just the day before she was shot in the head
[03:38:32.300 --> 03:38:37.180]  by this grim reaper nihilistic lunatic
[03:38:37.180 --> 03:38:40.460]  and i had predicted just looking at his garb and some of his other statements
[03:38:40.460 --> 03:38:43.100]  that he'd be some type of occultic devil worshiper
[03:38:43.100 --> 03:38:47.260]  that's very popular with our spoiled rotten uh youth today
[03:38:47.260 --> 03:38:51.180]  who've got a bunch of uh you know parents who did everything for them
[03:38:51.180 --> 03:38:54.460]  including wiping their hind ends when they were 10 years old
[03:38:54.460 --> 03:39:00.060]  uh i guess it was victor hugo that said uh adversity makes men and uh
[03:39:00.060 --> 03:39:04.060]  prosperity makes monsters we're entering a very decadent phase
[03:39:04.060 --> 03:39:07.740]  and that's all the more reason for the american people to be armed
[03:39:07.740 --> 03:39:11.660]  against criminals and against tyrants i am not calling
[03:39:11.660 --> 03:39:15.900]  for offensive actions against government that is the last thing we need
[03:39:15.900 --> 03:39:20.780]  but was it right for the germans in operation valkyrie in their military
[03:39:20.780 --> 03:39:24.140]  to stand up against adolf hitler our government today
[03:39:24.140 --> 03:39:27.580]  would tell you know was it right in 1989
[03:39:27.580 --> 03:39:31.020]  for the romanians to stand up against chelcescu who had tortured
[03:39:31.020 --> 03:39:35.180]  tens of thousands of people to death and imprisoned in slave camps hundreds of
[03:39:35.180 --> 03:39:37.740]  thousands would it have been right to stand up against
[03:39:37.740 --> 03:39:41.580]  stalin or lenin or malsay tongue or julius caesar
[03:39:41.580 --> 03:39:45.260]  was it right for black slaves to occasionally stand up
[03:39:45.260 --> 03:39:48.620]  when they were being beaten and beat their slave masters
[03:39:48.620 --> 03:39:51.980]  uh right back our media our government would say no
[03:39:51.980 --> 03:39:56.300]  but i go back to romania and chelcescu and the video we're showing on screen
[03:39:56.300 --> 03:39:59.980]  right now they were having a rally the people were starving there was
[03:39:59.980 --> 03:40:02.300]  incredible tyranny and he got up there at the rally
[03:40:02.300 --> 03:40:05.580]  and lectured them and the police began to beat up
[03:40:05.580 --> 03:40:09.180]  some of the people in the hundreds of thousands in the crowd
[03:40:09.180 --> 03:40:13.340]  and chelcescu said that that was a good thing and so the people rioted
[03:40:13.340 --> 03:40:17.740]  they took over the capital and they took control of chelcescu and his wife
[03:40:17.740 --> 03:40:23.900]  they had a trial and then he was executed now was it right to do that
[03:40:23.900 --> 03:40:27.580]  our government our media would say no matter what the state does
[03:40:27.580 --> 03:40:31.180]  you need to shut up and put up with it you need to put up with people every
[03:40:31.180 --> 03:40:34.300]  week being tasered to death you need to put up with cops shooting innocent
[03:40:34.300 --> 03:40:37.260]  people in the back and getting away with it you need to put up with fire and
[03:40:37.260 --> 03:40:41.100]  make stealing trillions of dollars you need to put up with the atf burning down
[03:40:41.100 --> 03:40:44.540]  weco and those little kids inside and shooting them as they tried to run out
[03:40:44.540 --> 03:40:49.580]  you need to put up with the feds staging operation
[03:40:49.580 --> 03:40:53.020]  uh gulf of tonka to get us into the vietnam war you need to put up with
[03:40:53.020 --> 03:40:57.580]  bipartisan continuity of agenda bush pushing torture and secret arrest and
[03:40:57.580 --> 03:41:01.500]  now obama doing it and appointing all these mob bosses
[03:41:01.500 --> 03:41:05.020]  like daily to chief of staff you need to sit down
[03:41:05.020 --> 03:41:08.860]  and put up with the mafia machine passing government health care
[03:41:08.860 --> 03:41:12.940]  written by the insurance companies to force you to buy overpriced care
[03:41:12.940 --> 03:41:16.140]  and put up with the death panels now being announced by bill gates
[03:41:16.140 --> 03:41:20.220]  and others you're supposed to put up with all of that while they give over
[03:41:20.220 --> 03:41:24.620]  500 waivers to obama's friends so their companies don't have to get
[03:41:24.620 --> 03:41:28.940]  insurance but you do walmart won't have to get it
[03:41:28.940 --> 03:41:32.860]  mcdonald's won't have to get it but your little company will
[03:41:32.860 --> 03:41:39.100]  no we're sick of the chicago slash new york mafia system
[03:41:39.100 --> 03:41:43.180]  we're tired of it and the globalist they don't
[03:41:43.180 --> 03:41:46.460]  want to have a peaceful restoration through the tenth amendment through the
[03:41:46.460 --> 03:41:50.540]  states through congress of our constitution because then they know
[03:41:50.540 --> 03:41:54.540]  there will be trials of the bernie made off ken lay type criminals
[03:41:54.540 --> 03:41:59.260]  that run this modern system they want to provocateur things like the
[03:41:59.260 --> 03:42:02.860]  hatari militia that turned out to be staged and these muslim groups that
[03:42:02.860 --> 03:42:06.380]  turn out to be staged over and over and over again even mainstream news and
[03:42:06.380 --> 03:42:10.060]  a raldera vera now admit that they want to preemptively
[03:42:10.060 --> 03:42:14.300]  have a shootout in this country have a violence
[03:42:14.300 --> 03:42:18.300]  type clash because they know there isn't one shell chescue
[03:42:18.300 --> 03:42:23.020]  or one adult hitler that could be removed and then everything would be okay
[03:42:23.020 --> 03:42:27.820]  this is a dictatorship of corporate criminals manipulating and controlling
[03:42:27.820 --> 03:42:32.460]  government and they're not afraid of congress people being gunned down or
[03:42:32.460 --> 03:42:35.100]  presidents being gunned down because they know their puppets
[03:42:35.100 --> 03:42:39.420]  whether it's george w bush or barack hussein obama
[03:42:39.420 --> 03:42:42.940]  they are afraid of you taking control of your government
[03:42:42.940 --> 03:42:48.140]  and your grand juries and bringing them to justice like a house of cards as more
[03:42:48.140 --> 03:42:51.260]  and more of them fall and get indicted and that's starting to happen
[03:42:51.260 --> 03:42:54.140]  as more and more of the mortgages are discovered to be fraudulent
[03:42:54.140 --> 03:42:59.580]  as courts are now ruling their system is imploding so they preemptively
[03:42:59.580 --> 03:43:03.340]  kind of like uh the famous uh oil well companies that knew how to put out a
[03:43:03.340 --> 03:43:07.020]  fire you got a big explosion going you got an oil well on fire
[03:43:07.020 --> 03:43:11.660]  you use a loaded dynamite to blast it to stop that fire
[03:43:11.660 --> 03:43:14.940]  they want to fight fire with fire they want to preemptively
[03:43:14.940 --> 03:43:18.940]  roll that stick of dynamite up there in that wheelbarrow up to the mouth of the
[03:43:18.940 --> 03:43:22.780]  big fire and use that explosion to blow out the flames
[03:43:22.780 --> 03:43:26.860]  they want to preemptively jump start an operation north woods
[03:43:26.860 --> 03:43:30.940]  like robert Shapiro has been openly talking about with obama needing a big
[03:43:30.940 --> 03:43:34.380]  terror attack needing a domestic attack so they can crack down on the
[03:43:34.380 --> 03:43:37.900]  domestic population we don't want to give them that
[03:43:37.900 --> 03:43:41.820]  sure with a stall in a hitler at chelchescu
[03:43:41.820 --> 03:43:47.420]  a a a a a people counter coup can work but not when you don't have a single
[03:43:47.420 --> 03:43:52.540]  dictatorship we've got a corrupt system the main problem is looking at us in
[03:43:52.540 --> 03:43:56.220]  the mirror that we allowed it to go this far
[03:43:56.220 --> 03:43:59.980]  it's been said many times that if the millions of gun owners
[03:43:59.980 --> 03:44:03.180]  even if one percent of the hundred million gun owners
[03:44:03.180 --> 03:44:06.700]  stood up and started fighting the government that we would defeat these
[03:44:06.700 --> 03:44:10.460]  criminals overnight that's over one million combatants
[03:44:10.460 --> 03:44:14.860]  who are lone wolf asymmetrical impossible to defeat
[03:44:14.860 --> 03:44:17.820]  there's no way an armed population can be brought into tyranny
[03:44:17.820 --> 03:44:21.980]  unless it's done through incremental corruption
[03:44:21.980 --> 03:44:25.340]  and that's why the system wants to have an armed confrontation now
[03:44:25.340 --> 03:44:31.180]  early on before everybody's awoken while they still have a chance to win it
[03:44:31.180 --> 03:44:33.980]  we need to peacefully take our republic back
[03:44:33.980 --> 03:44:37.340]  and understand that shooting and killing people is not
[03:44:37.340 --> 03:44:41.180]  the way to go because again we're not dealing with a
[03:44:41.180 --> 03:44:45.100]  chelchescu or a hitler we're dealing with an entirely corrupt system
[03:44:45.100 --> 03:44:48.460]  that is going to have to be taken back house by house
[03:44:48.460 --> 03:44:52.700]  city by city county by county state by state nation by nation
[03:44:52.700 --> 03:44:56.220]  and it's all it's that eternal struggle against good and
[03:44:56.220 --> 03:45:02.300]  evil but to the opportunistic sickos who are using these deaths
[03:45:02.300 --> 03:45:06.700]  and hyping these deaths is a pretext to attack the very heart of the first
[03:45:06.700 --> 03:45:09.740]  amendment they're openly calling for restrictions on free speech now
[03:45:09.740 --> 03:45:14.700]  and to openly attack being able to own more than 10 rounds of ammo i mean just
[03:45:14.700 --> 03:45:17.740]  amazing draconian tyrannies being announced
[03:45:17.740 --> 03:45:22.380]  this is only serving as a wake-up call this isn't 15 years ago
[03:45:22.380 --> 03:45:25.260]  where the feds could blow up oklahoma city and use it
[03:45:25.260 --> 03:45:28.620]  you know to get everybody to feel sorry for them and to and to demonize
[03:45:28.620 --> 03:45:34.540]  liberty this isn't uh you know 17 years ago uh
[03:45:34.540 --> 03:45:38.940]  when you guys staged the situation at wake-up where you could quote demonize
[03:45:38.940 --> 03:45:41.980]  a cult and we're not playing in the same ball game
[03:45:41.980 --> 03:45:45.740]  and you guys are still using the same old tricks you think we're so dumb
[03:45:45.740 --> 03:45:49.020]  you openly talk about staging stuff like we don't see it
[03:45:49.020 --> 03:45:52.460]  people are waking up and are wise to what you're doing and you need to get on
[03:45:52.460 --> 03:45:55.420]  the right side of history and for the average
[03:45:55.420 --> 03:45:58.780]  you know middle of the road liberal this is all meant to get conservatives and
[03:45:58.780 --> 03:46:02.220]  liberals fighting with each other and so that the left-right paradigm
[03:46:02.220 --> 03:46:06.300]  continues on the system knows that we're awakening and
[03:46:06.300 --> 03:46:09.340]  coming together and they're very scared of that so if they
[03:46:09.340 --> 03:46:12.460]  can get liberals and conservatives blaming each other
[03:46:12.460 --> 03:46:15.740]  for who's to blame for this obvious schizophrenic
[03:46:15.740 --> 03:46:19.900]  paranoid schizophrenic they've won we need to come together
[03:46:19.900 --> 03:46:24.220]  and to cry senseless acts of violence but stand for the bill of rights and
[03:46:24.220 --> 03:46:27.020]  constitution that so many have fought for
[03:46:27.020 --> 03:46:29.740]  and remember that you have a better chance of being struck by lightning and
[03:46:29.740 --> 03:46:33.020]  being killed by a mass shooter you have a better chance of being killed by a
[03:46:33.020 --> 03:46:36.380]  beasting than being killed by a terrorist and that this is the media
[03:46:36.380 --> 03:46:40.060]  playing this up and hyping it and trying to use this little girl
[03:46:40.060 --> 03:46:43.420]  as a martyr against the first and second amendment which are
[03:46:43.420 --> 03:46:47.580]  literally holy components of our basic canon
[03:46:47.580 --> 03:46:51.260]  that is the bill of rights i hope you'll spread this video to everyone you know
[03:46:51.260 --> 03:46:54.140]  we must offend the republic from enemies foreign and domestic
[03:46:54.140 --> 03:46:57.580]  we must offend them in the info war because the pen
[03:46:57.580 --> 03:47:01.340]  is mightier than the sword
[03:47:01.900 --> 03:47:07.020]  and that is my video announcement to the gun grabbers that they will fail
[03:47:07.020 --> 03:47:10.940]  they the the the victim disarmament crowd
[03:47:10.940 --> 03:47:14.060]  understand this and may the message be clear to you
[03:47:14.060 --> 03:47:19.020]  you will fail in your quest to disarm us you will fail in your quest to defeat
[03:47:19.020 --> 03:47:22.780]  the first amendment free speech everyone is going to redouble their efforts
[03:47:22.780 --> 03:47:26.620]  and as you try to create internet ids as you try to tax the web
[03:47:26.620 --> 03:47:30.700]  as you try to restrict free speech as you turn loose the giant cyber security
[03:47:30.700 --> 03:47:34.780]  domestic spy cores to go out and stir up trouble and infiltrate groups
[03:47:34.780 --> 03:47:39.900]  and provocateur you're only revealing to everyone what you really are
[03:47:39.900 --> 03:47:44.780]  all right let's go ahead and talk to uh jb in california jb thanks for holding
[03:47:44.780 --> 03:47:48.220]  hey alex it's really good to talk to you i really love your show
[03:47:48.220 --> 03:47:51.180]  thank you we're going to talk to you listen i'm trying to bring some free
[03:47:51.180 --> 03:47:54.940]  speech to bear on some other children's deaths and i hope you'll you'll get your
[03:47:54.940 --> 03:47:58.940]  read your listeners to pay attention to this because there's an over-the-counter
[03:47:58.940 --> 03:48:02.620]  medication that are that almost killed my child has killed others we've
[03:48:02.620 --> 03:48:05.900]  proved all this in court and when you said today earlier
[03:48:05.900 --> 03:48:09.420]  that they have to put the side effects on the label that i wish that was true
[03:48:09.420 --> 03:48:13.340]  because what they said about our the medicine she took was it was safe and
[03:48:13.340 --> 03:48:16.380]  effective she ended up blind and nearly dead
[03:48:16.380 --> 03:48:21.100]  i've got a youtube video out there it's a j4 sabrina
[03:48:21.100 --> 03:48:24.780]  and it tells about her and and others there's 60 other lawsuits and this
[03:48:24.780 --> 03:48:28.780]  medication will kill your kid and they won't die in a nice way they won't
[03:48:28.780 --> 03:48:32.300]  just die suddenly they will die slowly in a lot of pain
[03:48:32.300 --> 03:48:36.220]  so i'm hoping your free speech will help save some children
[03:48:36.220 --> 03:48:40.060]  i mean you're one of the few people out there who's even able to get this out
[03:48:40.060 --> 03:48:45.420]  well i mean they do put a lot of the side effects
[03:48:45.420 --> 03:48:49.020]  on the over-the-counter and the behind-the-counter prescription drugs
[03:48:49.020 --> 03:48:53.340]  not really certainly no i'm saying certainly there's a lot that we
[03:48:53.340 --> 03:48:56.940]  don't know about and that that's my point that hundreds of thousands die a
[03:48:56.940 --> 03:49:00.540]  year from bad drug interactions and the system isn't
[03:49:00.540 --> 03:49:04.140]  weeping and wailing and gnashing their teeth about that but then a couple you
[03:49:04.140 --> 03:49:07.420]  know six people die and act like it's the end of the world
[03:49:07.420 --> 03:49:10.700]  if they were telling the truth and and showing you how some of these little
[03:49:10.700 --> 03:49:15.100]  children are dying like i said go to j4 sabrina on youtube and you will see
[03:49:15.100 --> 03:49:19.740]  these children are dying horrible deaths and not only that but even if it's not
[03:49:19.740 --> 03:49:22.620]  listed on the label and even if they've committed fraud
[03:49:22.620 --> 03:49:25.820]  these pharmaceutical companies are not being held responsible
[03:49:25.820 --> 03:49:28.460]  we took them to court we proved that they did it
[03:49:28.460 --> 03:49:33.180]  and they were judged guilty but not liable no no i totally agree with you i
[03:49:33.180 --> 03:49:36.620]  mean it's like prozac uh which all these other major serotonin
[03:49:36.620 --> 03:49:40.700]  reuptake inhibitors are based on they admitted in 1981 their trials massive
[03:49:40.700 --> 03:49:44.620]  increase in suicide massive increase in psychotic behavior
[03:49:44.620 --> 03:49:49.340]  it puts you into a dream state it's very similar to lsd you just don't
[03:49:49.340 --> 03:49:54.460]  normally see visual hallucinations and uh it's very toxic to the brain
[03:49:54.460 --> 03:49:58.460]  and they knew that and it took us until five years ago to just get that on the
[03:49:58.460 --> 03:50:02.220]  insert that it does do that they knew that all along
[03:50:02.220 --> 03:50:05.740]  and that's what's so dangerous about the flu shots all of this stuff
[03:50:05.740 --> 03:50:11.340]  people are not being told how deadly uh big pharma is but big pharma will
[03:50:11.340 --> 03:50:15.340]  i mean a lot of their ads are having trouble when eating to urinate take this
[03:50:15.340 --> 03:50:18.540]  may cause heart attacks may cause sudden death may cause this and that
[03:50:18.540 --> 03:50:22.620]  i mean it's crazy you hear even what they admit and then to know
[03:50:22.620 --> 03:50:26.540]  that they're only mentioning a tiny fraction of what's on the actual drug
[03:50:26.540 --> 03:50:30.940]  insert and you're saying you know even more uh i'll definitely check into that
[03:50:30.940 --> 03:50:35.100]  okay please thank you thank you yeah i know i mean i mean that's why i get
[03:50:35.100 --> 03:50:38.940]  blown away just but then you know a little girl gets killed
[03:50:38.940 --> 03:50:42.380]  they again little girls are getting killed in iraq every day they don't hype
[03:50:42.380 --> 03:50:45.340]  that up it's how they pick what they want to
[03:50:45.340 --> 03:50:49.740]  hype how they were ready to hype it it's the judge they killed i mean it it's
[03:50:49.740 --> 03:50:52.540]  very suspicious i believe this was an inside job
[03:50:52.540 --> 03:50:55.100]  the way they're not releasing the video yet the way they're holding on to his

[03:54:53.660 --> 03:54:57.900]  the way the media was just ready and the way they're now blaming

[03:55:07.500 --> 03:55:11.260]  they before she got shot on fox saying get past the left right paradigm
[03:55:11.260 --> 03:55:14.940]  but it is up on info wars.com and prisonpunna.com
[03:55:14.940 --> 03:55:21.580]  i didn't get to um the democracy now but we'll play that tomorrow where they go
[03:55:21.580 --> 03:55:27.100]  after myself and ron paul uh just incredible political opportunist
[03:55:27.100 --> 03:55:30.300]  meanwhile fox news is blaming it on conspiracy theorists that's anyone that
[03:55:30.300 --> 03:55:35.100]  doesn't buy hook line and sinker whatever the media
[03:55:35.100 --> 03:55:39.740]  and the government are spewing at the population
[03:55:39.740 --> 03:55:43.020]  we've also got some other bizarre activity you know a week and a half ago
[03:55:43.020 --> 03:55:46.940]  one of the top former age to george herbert walker bush and george w
[03:55:46.940 --> 03:55:50.460]  bush they had so many powerful organizations major
[03:55:50.460 --> 03:55:53.580]  corporate boards trunk my mother's against drunk driving
[03:55:53.580 --> 03:55:56.140]  he was seen running around drugged out of his mind
[03:55:56.140 --> 03:56:02.220]  uh then uh we had uh him being found dead in the landfill
[03:56:02.220 --> 03:56:07.180]  uh well now we have ex congressional aid found dead in burning car
[03:56:07.180 --> 03:56:09.980]  that's out of politico a veteran congressional aid who
[03:56:09.980 --> 03:56:12.860]  had worked most recently as a lobbyist and was married to a
[03:56:12.860 --> 03:56:15.900]  white house legislative affairs senior official was found dead in a car
[03:56:15.900 --> 03:56:19.500]  monday behind the couple's capital honele home following a low speed car
[03:56:19.500 --> 03:56:23.180]  crash and subsequent fire that's one of the cia's favorite ways to kill the
[03:56:23.180 --> 03:56:26.060]  other governments too they smash into you put you in the car
[03:56:26.060 --> 03:56:29.660]  you're already knocked out they smashed the car set it on fire it's one of
[03:56:29.660 --> 03:56:34.140]  their favorite favorite ways to do it very very suspicious how many
[03:56:34.140 --> 03:56:37.580]  deaths are happening and what's going on uh we did
[03:56:37.580 --> 03:56:42.700]  several key search terms uh today and those should become number one
[03:56:42.700 --> 03:56:46.780]  we did that last week and and you made all three of the terms respectively
[03:56:46.780 --> 03:56:50.380]  number one number two and number three very effective
[03:56:50.380 --> 03:56:54.300]  and they kind of shut down the whole maryland bombing uh fear mongering uh
[03:56:54.300 --> 03:56:58.700]  i think that was part of it but we've got two different search terms today
[03:56:58.700 --> 03:57:02.380]  please research them now to make sure they continue to be number one
[03:57:02.380 --> 03:57:06.860]  liberal smear machine is number is the number one search those three words into
[03:57:06.860 --> 03:57:13.580]  google and yahoo liberal smear machine uh and uh
[03:57:13.580 --> 03:57:17.580]  what was the second term i was gonna use it was a gunman
[03:57:17.580 --> 03:57:22.460]  left winger gunman left winger was the uh second search term see how they like
[03:57:22.460 --> 03:57:25.420]  that because they're really trying to cover this up right now
[03:57:25.420 --> 03:57:29.260]  and again he was obviously under mind control or complete paranoid schizophrenic
[03:57:29.260 --> 03:57:32.540]  but if you have to look at the spectrum of
[03:57:32.540 --> 03:57:39.020]  20 things or so he was into 15 of them would be called liberal
[03:57:40.220 --> 03:57:46.380]  and you know communist manifesto and dressing up like a woman and uh
[03:57:46.380 --> 03:57:52.780]  you know uh voodoo and sanorrhea and just all of this chicanery and we've
[03:57:52.780 --> 03:57:56.380]  got the article liberal smear machine backfires that for gunman found to be
[03:57:56.380 --> 03:58:00.540]  a cultist hot smoking left winger but the other incredible article that
[03:58:00.540 --> 03:58:03.580]  needs to get out there to everybody to expose how evil these people are
[03:58:03.580 --> 03:58:07.180]  leftist attack parents of murdered nine-year-old unprecedented that's at
[03:58:07.180 --> 03:58:11.100]  prisonplanet.com and we've got lots of reports by curtain mo and
[03:58:11.100 --> 03:58:15.580]  paul watson coming out the report i haven't seen anybody do yet
[03:58:15.580 --> 03:58:19.500]  is all the environmental messages of killing children
[03:58:19.500 --> 03:58:22.620]  and how great it is i mean the left freaked out about this nine-year-old
[03:58:22.620 --> 03:58:25.100]  being dead well the big environmental groups government
[03:58:25.100 --> 03:58:27.340]  funded are putting out stuff showing nine-year-olds
