[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:36.320]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:36.320 --> 00:45.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the 14th day of January, 2013. We're gonna be here live, Lord
[00:45.960 --> 00:51.420]  willing, for the next three hours. And again, I am your host, Alex Jones. We do not have
[00:51.420 --> 00:55.840]  any guests today except for the Obama phone lady.
[00:55.840 --> 01:01.000]  And she is going to be in studio with us. She is here in Austin, Texas. If you go up
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.240]  to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com, you can see there that it says, Obama phone lady comes
[01:07.240 --> 01:15.240]  to Texas. And this is amazing because she's one of the most virally viewed and downloaded
[01:15.240 --> 01:18.320]  videos ever.
[01:18.320 --> 01:23.080]  And it's not just that what she's saying is ridiculous about free handouts from the government.
[01:23.080 --> 01:29.120]  I know she's listening right now, she's a very sweet lady. It's that she's very funny.
[01:29.120 --> 01:34.040]  And she's exactly what I thought she would be like when she flew in last night at about
[01:34.040 --> 01:35.040]  630.
[01:35.040 --> 01:40.760]  Her plane was late, flew in out of Cleveland via Houston and then to Austin, Texas. And
[01:40.760 --> 01:48.640]  her husband is exactly what I imagined him to be like. Just really nice, funny, smart
[01:48.640 --> 01:58.280]  people except childlike when it comes to trusting government. And she's just as funny and just
[01:58.280 --> 02:04.120]  as charming in person as she is in that video.
[02:04.120 --> 02:11.920]  That's only about a minute long, where she talks about you on social security, food stamps,
[02:11.920 --> 02:17.700]  you get Obama phone. Everybody in Cleveland got Obama phone. Well, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:17.700 --> 02:21.560]  we took her and her husband out to dinner last night and has had a great evening with
[02:21.560 --> 02:22.760]  them.
[02:22.760 --> 02:26.080]  And quite frankly, I haven't really hardly seen my children the last few days. I've been
[02:26.080 --> 02:31.200]  drinking so much over the weekend. And I wanna go home and see them tonight. But I also wanna
[02:31.200 --> 02:36.240]  take Obama phone lady out to dinner. You know what I'll do? I'll have my wife come meet
[02:36.240 --> 02:37.880]  us for dinner.
[02:37.880 --> 02:44.400]  And we'll take Obama phone lady and her husband. And we're gonna tell you her name and everything
[02:44.400 --> 02:48.480]  here on air. In fact, if you don't know who Obama phone lady is, let's go ahead and cue
[02:48.480 --> 02:51.640]  that up with audio. Can we cue that up and play the audio here in a moment?
[02:51.640 --> 03:17.440]  So, people are asking, why have you gotten Obama phone lady here? Well, number one, I
[03:17.440 --> 03:25.040]  said to listeners, there'd be a $5,000 bounty for whoever got me a hold of her. That's some
[03:25.040 --> 03:30.320]  good English there, that there would be a $5,000 bonus for whoever got us in touch with
[03:30.320 --> 03:31.320]  her.
[03:31.320 --> 03:40.400]  And then if we actually got her on air, $5,000 bounty. And I gotta talk to the guys that
[03:40.400 --> 03:45.720]  actually ran into her at a store and did this and obviously asked them if they want any
[03:45.720 --> 03:54.080]  of that bounty to go to her. But we flew her down here and she is here. And so in about
[03:54.080 --> 04:00.720]  an hour and a half from now, if we cover news and take your calls, we will have Obama phone
[04:00.720 --> 04:01.720]  lady here.
[04:01.720 --> 04:06.360]  And you notice last night when I picked her up, the video is up on infowars.com that I
[04:06.360 --> 04:12.460]  wore a sports jacket. And you notice I'm wearing one now because I've got butterflies. This
[04:12.460 --> 04:18.640]  is a big deal around here and I'm not joking. It's like the eagle has landed, okay? This
[04:18.640 --> 04:20.920]  is the kind of stuff we get excited about.
[04:20.920 --> 04:25.960]  I was not even excited about going on Piers Morgan, didn't even have butterflies. I didn't
[04:25.960 --> 04:30.380]  wear a sports jacket. For Obama phone lady, I think I'll go put a tie on. I ought to put
[04:30.380 --> 04:34.720]  some diamond cufflinks on. In fact, I'm wearing a short sleeve shirt, that's not respectful
[04:34.720 --> 04:39.600]  enough. That's actually all I had back there in my wardrobe, I sent stuff away to be cleaned.
[04:39.600 --> 04:46.920]  Anyway, she's coming. You may even get her husband in here with her. He's a character
[04:46.920 --> 04:52.640]  too, but it's a big deal. And I'm telling you, this woman could be ready for standup
[04:52.640 --> 04:58.160]  comedy on HBO right now. So who wants to manage her out there is the big question. We'll be
[04:58.160 --> 05:03.040]  right back, ladies and gentlemen. Stay with us.

[08:07.800 --> 08:17.440]  fool me once, shame on you. If you fool me you can't get fooled again.
[08:17.440 --> 08:23.920]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[08:23.920 --> 08:25.920]  to Alex Jones.
[08:25.920 --> 08:43.640]  A man's got to have a code, a creed to live by, John Wayne. And I tip my hat and take
[08:43.640 --> 08:51.040]  a toast of coffee to John Wayne from my John Wayne coffee cup that I bought at his favorite
[08:51.040 --> 08:57.280]  place in the world, Monument Valley, Utah, where he shot so many of his first westerns.
[08:57.280 --> 09:06.120]  Mm, absolutely delicious. Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday edition worldwide
[09:06.120 --> 09:09.760]  broadcast the 14th day of January 2013.
[09:09.760 --> 09:19.960]  Wow, where to begin? Where to start? If you just tuned in to the broadcast, coming up
[09:19.960 --> 09:27.160]  in the flesh and I'm still pinching myself that this isn't a dream. People on the YouTube
[09:27.160 --> 09:33.080]  video that we posted late last night that Rob Dew and John Bowne did a great job getting
[09:33.080 --> 09:36.560]  up even though he didn't get back from dinner with Obama phone lady till about 930.
[09:36.560 --> 09:41.160]  They stayed up late to edit down our picking her up at the airport and taking her out to
[09:41.160 --> 09:47.640]  dinner and some of the enjoyable antics that took place there. Don't worry, they'll be
[09:47.640 --> 09:52.600]  full behind the scenes videos in the days to come and she's gonna be in studio today
[09:52.600 --> 09:54.400]  with us on the radio show.
[09:54.400 --> 09:59.240]  And then I think I'm gonna take her out around Austin today as well and shoot some more footage
[09:59.240 --> 10:05.400]  weather. And a lot of people are obviously freaking out saying it's like reality is folding
[10:05.400 --> 10:12.960]  in on itself. She goes out and talks about Obama gave us a phone, he's gonna do more.
[10:12.960 --> 10:19.240]  Everybody in Cleveland got Obama phone. And it's not just that the video is obviously
[10:19.240 --> 10:24.840]  ridiculous, the dependency and the idea that government's there to give us freebies.
[10:24.840 --> 10:34.220]  But that she does have an electric personality. And I think this could be a story of somebody
[10:34.220 --> 10:39.480]  who literally takes that flash in the pan 15 minutes of fame and turns it into something
[10:39.480 --> 10:46.760]  bigger. I see her as a kind of a Sam Kennison style comic, because she's very funny in person,
[10:46.760 --> 10:52.560]  very witty. But again, also tough love here, I told her this last night.
[10:52.560 --> 10:56.300]  She's like, well, my son says you're a Republican, you're a big conservative, you're pro gun
[10:56.300 --> 11:01.240]  and stuff. I don't really have the Internet, so I don't know. And I came anyways cuz so
[11:01.240 --> 11:05.680]  many people after they heard I was coming on or was thinking about coming on said, yeah,
[11:05.680 --> 11:09.080]  you gotta go on the Alex Jones show in her community.
[11:09.080 --> 11:13.680]  And a lot of folks she knows said that I was a good guy. And I was honest with her. I said,
[11:13.680 --> 11:18.560]  look, it's ridiculous that you want a free phone from the president and that that's your
[11:18.560 --> 11:25.360]  idea of winning somehow when they take your whole future away with dependency and then
[11:25.360 --> 11:32.120]  basically give us baubles. It's like a free toy and a happy meal.
[11:32.120 --> 11:40.680]  But the fact from a sociological perspective, or a psychological perspective, as a sociologist
[11:40.680 --> 11:50.240]  or as someone studying culture, that she is kind of the archetypal person who really thinks
[11:50.240 --> 11:55.680]  the government cares about her and wants to help her get a leg up. There have been some
[11:55.680 --> 11:58.060]  people in government that have tried to help folks.
[11:58.060 --> 12:03.160]  There have been good people that have worked through government to help people. But the
[12:03.160 --> 12:11.040]  controlling driving force of government is domestication, enslavement, and cultural destruction.
[12:11.040 --> 12:15.720]  And no one can argue with the numbers of what welfare and big government has done, not just
[12:15.720 --> 12:22.200]  to the black community, but communities across the board. And so it is my hope, and I'll
[12:22.200 --> 12:28.880]  just be honest with you here about this, is that it is my hope to stay in contact with
[12:28.880 --> 12:34.620]  Obama phone lady, and we'll give you her full name and stuff on air when she joins us.
[12:34.620 --> 12:40.340]  And to try to basically maybe even have her as an auxiliary reporter. I haven't even told
[12:40.340 --> 12:49.840]  her this yet, I'm just saying it all on air. And to try to educate her and inform her about
[12:49.840 --> 12:55.760]  how we're all being inserted into a matrix like prison. So I wanna reach down to the
[12:55.760 --> 12:59.440]  matrix like Morpheus to her a Neo.
[12:59.440 --> 13:03.880]  Because as Eric Blair, aka George Arwell said, if there is any hope, will you guys print
[13:03.880 --> 13:11.460]  me Orwell quotes, I meant to do that. Orwell quotes on the only hope lies with the proles.
[13:11.460 --> 13:15.280]  And even though I don't subscribe to the communist ideology, the globalists are using communism
[13:15.280 --> 13:21.000]  as a template of control. And it's the general public, George Arwell talked about, he actually
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.640]  wrote nonfiction books on this subject, that obsess over lottery tickets or get rich quick
[13:26.640 --> 13:29.560]  schemes or a hope and a prayer.
[13:29.560 --> 13:34.280]  But just if Obama gets in there, he's gonna fix everything cuz the President can get it
[13:34.280 --> 13:38.680]  done. And this woman really hopes that he's gonna turn the economy around. This woman
[13:38.680 --> 13:46.680]  works for $8 an hour and can't live on that and I don't blame her in Cleveland. She goes
[13:46.680 --> 13:53.020]  and cleans houses all day for $8 an hour, no one could live on that.
[13:53.020 --> 13:58.160]  And they take taxes out of it, and she didn't even understand that. She didn't even understand
[13:58.160 --> 14:03.040]  why her paycheck's getting smaller with the payroll taxes. I mean, let me tell you something,
[14:03.040 --> 14:06.720]  my wife and other people in my family when they heard that she was coming to town last
[14:06.720 --> 14:11.260]  week, they said, listen, Alex, you're mean, you don't get her on your show and make fun
[14:11.260 --> 14:12.260]  of her.
[14:12.260 --> 14:15.760]  And I said, what do you think, I'm an idiot? I don't wanna make fun of her, sure, it's
[14:15.760 --> 14:24.240]  funny at one level, and she knows it's funny. My goal is to actually show this lady who's
[14:24.240 --> 14:29.080]  actually an interesting human being and has a lot of spirit, a lot of heart, a lot of
[14:29.080 --> 14:31.600]  guts, who's got real potential.
[14:31.600 --> 14:36.120]  I guarantee you, ladies and gentlemen, you take somebody like that lady and you put her
[14:36.120 --> 14:42.400]  on the frontier, you put her in adversity. You give her real opportunities to have a
[14:42.400 --> 14:46.640]  future and to build a better world and to not be dumbed down by the television in this
[14:46.640 --> 14:54.400]  sick culture, she would be an unbelievably powerful individual. I can see the potential
[14:54.400 --> 14:55.400]  there.
[14:55.400 --> 14:59.800]  And that's what makes me so bad about The Collectivist, is that they know human potential
[14:59.800 --> 15:05.040]  and they wanna shutter it, they wanna shut it down. While telling us big government is
[15:05.040 --> 15:16.200]  about getting Obama phone lady to her highest potential. And that is not the case. And if
[15:16.200 --> 15:22.400]  you don't know who Obama phone lady is, can we cue that up one more time?
[15:22.400 --> 15:26.120]  She's the lady who was one of the most viral videos last year. I mean, it's been seen,
[15:26.120 --> 15:30.160]  let's be conservative. There's probably 50 million views in one form or another out there,
[15:30.160 --> 15:31.840]  8 million here, 5 million there.
[15:31.840 --> 15:35.960]  Keep Obama in president, you know, he gave us a phone.
[15:35.960 --> 15:36.960]  He gave you a phone.
[15:36.960 --> 15:37.960]  He's gonna do more.
[15:37.960 --> 15:38.960]  How did he give you a phone?
[15:38.960 --> 15:46.640]  You sign up and you on full stamps, you on social security, you got low income, you disability.
[15:46.640 --> 15:47.640]  Okay, what's wrong with Rami again?
[15:47.640 --> 15:48.640]  Rami, he sucks. Hey.
[15:48.640 --> 15:49.640]  You got Obama phone?
[15:49.640 --> 15:51.640]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority got Obama phone. Keep Obama in president,
[15:51.640 --> 15:52.640]  you know.
[15:52.640 --> 16:08.600]  By the way, I put a $5,000 bounty out to find her. And I was surprised, cuz we have listeners
[16:08.600 --> 16:18.040]  in every city. We're on a couple of stations in Ohio, lot of listeners in Cleveland. And
[16:18.040 --> 16:24.040]  no one could find her until a listener ran into her in a store months and months later.
[16:24.040 --> 16:28.960]  And guess what? The Democratic Party took her, same amount of money. She was working,
[16:28.960 --> 16:35.680]  you know, paid canvasser. So we now know that. And they stuck her at a desk job and told
[16:35.680 --> 16:40.180]  her stay out of the public eye. And then they lied to her and said, because you're just
[16:40.180 --> 16:41.180]  too effective.
[16:41.180 --> 16:48.320]  I mean, see, I'm not gonna lie to this lady. I told her it's hilarious what you did. I
[16:48.320 --> 16:54.240]  don't agree with the dependency. I think if you play your cards right, and if you go to
[16:54.240 --> 17:00.200]  some small time comedy clubs and get under the right person's wing, you can develop comedy
[17:00.200 --> 17:06.140]  pieces and probably become very famous. She's got natural talent. And there's nothing I'd
[17:06.140 --> 17:07.140]  like better.
[17:07.140 --> 17:10.240]  By the way, I didn't tell her this to get her here. I told her this once I was with
[17:10.240 --> 17:13.600]  her in person. But I told her it'll take hard work. She's not gonna go right to the top
[17:13.600 --> 17:19.360]  immediately. She's funny. And my instinct about her, she's exactly what I thought she'd
[17:19.360 --> 17:28.640]  be like. Exactly what I thought she would be like.
[17:28.640 --> 17:33.560]  And her husband was exactly what I thought they'd be like. And just really funny, interesting
[17:33.560 --> 17:42.080]  people who are, again, smart at many levels, but also still buy into the fake dream. And
[17:42.080 --> 17:48.160]  that's what this is all about, the fake dream of, you go to a casino, you're gonna get rich.
[17:48.160 --> 17:52.480]  You buy a lottery ticket, you're gonna win. You get Obama in, all the problems are gonna
[17:52.480 --> 17:53.480]  be fixed.
[17:53.480 --> 17:57.360]  And I was sitting there talking to her last night. I know she's listening. I should just
[17:57.360 --> 18:01.520]  leave it all and let it be fresh when she gets here. She's like, man, I voted for him,
[18:01.520 --> 18:06.000]  voted for him twice. Things gotta get better. Obama's gonna get in trouble. If things don't
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.560]  get better, honey, things aren't gonna get better.
[18:08.560 --> 18:15.360]  This is Agenda 21 designed to destroy you. They don't bring in 30 million illegal aliens,
[18:15.360 --> 18:18.280]  so you've got a future. And they don't bring them in so they get a future. They bring them
[18:18.280 --> 18:28.760]  in to drive down the wages and make us poor as a political tool of control. And they also
[18:28.760 --> 18:33.340]  understood that, well, Obama, like Nixon, he can just pump some money out there.
[18:33.340 --> 18:36.920]  They understood Obama's got the printing press to turn up on high. And I said, have you noticed
[18:36.920 --> 18:42.900]  prices have gone up? Notice the packages of potato chips and ice cream have gotten smaller.
[18:42.900 --> 18:49.600]  Have you noticed that in almost every area, things are going up and up and up in price?
[18:49.600 --> 18:53.520]  And they're like, yeah, we have noticed that. We just can't pay our bills. Her husband works
[18:53.520 --> 19:05.080]  as a plumber 12 hours a day. She works as a maid for $8 an hour. And again, no one's
[19:05.080 --> 19:07.140]  ever taught her anything entrepreneurial.
[19:07.140 --> 19:12.120]  No one has explained to her that the maid service she contracts through, I bet money
[19:12.120 --> 19:18.120]  is getting 20, $25 an hour for. And all she's got to do is go hang up signs all around the
[19:18.120 --> 19:23.660]  area that she wants to target, saying she'll come clean houses. And she'd get all that
[19:23.660 --> 19:28.000]  clientele for herself and double or triple her money, just like that with pieces of paper
[19:28.000 --> 19:29.120]  hung up on the wall.
[19:29.120 --> 19:34.900]  No one is teaching these people anything. They don't teach any of that in school. They
[19:34.900 --> 19:48.340]  don't want you to know that. Anyways, it's going to be a study of can we help somebody?
[19:48.340 --> 19:53.240]  But it's not like the Eddie Murphy movie where they make a bet that they can't help somebody.
[19:53.240 --> 19:59.400]  I know that we can probably try to help this lady and help others by her example. We'll
[19:59.400 --> 20:03.040]  be right back. Stay with us.
[20:03.040 --> 20:07.900]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters
[20:07.900 --> 20:12.480]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on
[20:12.480 --> 20:17.420]  by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

[20:31.860 --> 20:36.620]  to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

[21:07.700 --> 21:13.260]  Pastor Ginny and that was the state I was in back in 2010. Then I learned about RNA
[21:13.260 --> 21:19.520]  drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions
[21:19.520 --> 21:24.300]  of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other
[21:24.300 --> 21:28.540]  tissues behave. I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like
[21:28.540 --> 21:34.240]  I've been conditioned to believe. I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed
[21:34.240 --> 21:39.740]  to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health and joy. Learn more about RNA

[22:32.180 --> 22:36.220]  Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk

[24:08.260 --> 24:18.420]  We're going to get into the news and open the phones up here in a moment. But first,
[24:18.420 --> 24:27.820]  here's from page 60 of 1984 written by George Orwell. If there was hope, it must lie with
[24:27.820 --> 24:35.460]  the proles, that's the common working class. Because only there in those swarming, disregarded
[24:35.460 --> 24:42.940]  masses, 85% of the population of Oceania, that's England and the US, could be forced
[24:42.940 --> 24:45.700]  to destroy the party ever be generated.
[24:45.700 --> 24:50.500]  The party could not be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if ever it had any enemies, had
[24:50.500 --> 24:55.900]  no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. Even if the legendary brotherhood
[24:55.900 --> 25:02.020]  existed as just a possibility it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever
[25:02.020 --> 25:07.080]  assemble in large numbers in more than twos and threes.
[25:07.080 --> 25:14.540]  Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflection of the voice, at the most an occasional whispered
[25:14.540 --> 25:20.300]  word. But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength, would
[25:20.300 --> 25:25.540]  have no need to conspire. They need only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse
[25:25.540 --> 25:28.140]  shaking off flies.
[25:28.140 --> 25:33.580]  If they chose, they could blow the party to pieces tomorrow morning. Surely, sooner or
[25:33.580 --> 25:46.300]  later it must come to them to do it, and yet. And he goes through the strength of the proles
[25:46.300 --> 25:52.900]  watching this grandmother out there hand washing the clothes in the slum. And the strength
[25:52.900 --> 25:58.500]  of her sunburned face, and her big muscular shoulders, and sound of children giggling.
[25:58.500 --> 26:03.900]  But the proles wouldn't spend their time studying how government or business worked. The proles
[26:03.900 --> 26:10.540]  obsessed all day about lottery tickets, and lottery systems to win, and get rich schemes,
[26:10.540 --> 26:20.220]  and pornography, and mindlessness, and entertainment put out by the party.
[26:20.220 --> 26:24.820]  Big Brother didn't even need to police the proles. They were just dumbed down, and obsessed
[26:24.820 --> 26:31.220]  with petty garbage, and didn't even exist. The party, the English Socialist Party, which
[26:31.220 --> 26:35.900]  is really a Soviet party in the book. This is what George Arwell, aka real name Eric
[26:35.900 --> 26:42.940]  Blair, who'd worked for the communist, and worked for MI6, and worked for OSS, and worked
[26:42.940 --> 26:44.860]  as an imperial policeman before that.
[26:44.860 --> 26:51.340]  And lived in the slums on purpose for years, contracting tuberculosis in Paris, and also
[26:51.340 --> 26:57.940]  in London. Wrote a bunch of non-fiction books and essays, amazing stuff. I've read basically
[26:57.940 --> 27:04.260]  all of Arwell's writings I could find in a period in my life when I was about 20. I learned
[27:04.260 --> 27:09.420]  a lot through him not having to actually go live in a slum with people with tuberculosis.
[27:09.420 --> 27:17.060]  He came from a well-to-do kind of establishment intelligentsia family.
[27:17.060 --> 27:22.100]  And he thought communism would fight the ills he saw. And then he discovered, wait a minute,
[27:22.100 --> 27:26.740]  fighting in the Spanish Civil War, that the communists were just as bad as the fascists.
[27:26.740 --> 27:36.180]  They were just criminals, using a governmental term, a political term as a cover. And then
[27:36.180 --> 27:42.740]  he went and worked at the BBC in propaganda. And the character Winston Smith is Eric Blair
[27:42.740 --> 27:49.620]  at the BBC, one of their top propagandists, taking truths and rearranging them and smashing
[27:49.620 --> 27:50.620]  them.
[27:50.620 --> 27:57.300]  And then he discovers the British government is funding Hitler, that they'd funded Hitler.
[27:57.300 --> 28:02.680]  Didn't run Hitler, they helped creating, helped put him in there. It was like a wind-up toy,
[28:02.680 --> 28:06.160]  like one of these mentally ill mass shooters. They give government funds and have a government
[28:06.160 --> 28:11.020]  psychiatrist and then, they go and attack.
[28:11.020 --> 28:16.660]  And the book talks about government-sponsored terror, how the government itself was firing
[28:16.660 --> 28:23.700]  missiles into London every day, randomly, just to scare people. And now everything else
[28:23.700 --> 28:29.160]  was squalor and rack and ruin, but the giant, pyramidal-sized buildings that look like something
[28:29.160 --> 28:35.180]  out of Blade Runner, with black helicopters coming in and out of armored command bases,
[28:35.180 --> 28:38.340]  flying around, looking through your windows and your television screens, watching and
[28:38.340 --> 28:39.380]  listening to you.
[28:39.380 --> 28:45.780]  That is now a reality. They just haven't gone to the physical end of it yet. And here's
[28:45.780 --> 28:51.360]  the good news, they are in check. And if you know chess, that means we've got them, we're
[28:51.360 --> 28:57.800]  closed to fire, we're closed to beat them. Because the average gun shows out there are
[28:57.800 --> 29:05.620]  reporting 10,000 people visiting them, organizers shocked as 10,000 attend gun show.
[29:05.620 --> 29:13.260]  Piers Morgan is now chickened out of a debate he called for, part two, round two. Senator
[29:13.260 --> 29:17.900]  Schumer is saying they'll just use executive power to basically lean on. This is what they've
[29:17.900 --> 29:21.660]  already said they do, that's why we told you this was coming. Executive orders, rule-making,
[29:21.660 --> 29:27.780]  and just tell Walmart and others not to sell semi-autos, and have the ATF come in and make
[29:27.780 --> 29:31.780]  basically nickel and dime them and white glove inspect them till they do it.
[29:31.780 --> 29:34.620]  You're saying, well, how do we have them in check? Doesn't mean we've won, they've still
[29:34.620 --> 29:39.340]  got some moves. But I mean, we're up against them, we're right on their tail. They're not
[29:39.340 --> 29:43.940]  on our tail, we're on their tail. When we come back, I'll explain to you why, go for
[29:43.940 --> 29:48.500]  some news and then take your calls. But coming up at the bottom of the next hour, one hour
[29:48.500 --> 29:52.180]  away, you will be transmitted.
[29:52.180 --> 30:02.860]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:02.860 --> 30:07.700]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters
[30:07.700 --> 30:12.280]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on
[30:12.280 --> 30:17.240]  by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods
[30:17.240 --> 30:21.460]  Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm
[30:21.460 --> 30:25.980]  by having a supply of food on hand. After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City

[30:31.660 --> 30:36.420]  to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early
[30:36.420 --> 30:41.020]  than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

[31:03.180 --> 31:07.860]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[31:07.860 --> 31:13.500]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing
[31:13.500 --> 31:18.940]  a full selection of silver-based products. Our most popular silver-based products are

[31:32.360 --> 31:37.180]  gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver
[31:37.180 --> 31:42.700]  at the surface. But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing
[31:42.700 --> 31:47.780]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the
[31:47.780 --> 31:56.180]  silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver-based
[31:56.180 --> 32:26.060]  products are best for you.
[32:56.180 --> 33:14.820]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwanted influence,
[33:14.820 --> 33:21.100]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial commons. In Dallas, Texas, three
[33:21.100 --> 33:26.340]  shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas. One man did it. First
[33:26.340 --> 33:31.780]  reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting. It is
[33:31.780 --> 33:39.980]  a big idea. A new world order. I thought that didn't exist. It was almost as if there were
[33:39.980 --> 33:59.420]  planned implosions. It just pancakes. Either you were with us or you were with the terrorists.
[33:59.420 --> 34:22.100]  And later you gave them, time Feinstein loves us. I also believe in a lot of gun owners
[34:22.100 --> 34:27.740]  cut on. Vacationant got all falloc the police and guards. It is an uncomfortable job to
[34:27.740 --> 34:29.300]  for what the central banks do.
[34:29.300 --> 34:35.500]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[34:35.500 --> 34:40.420]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[34:40.420 --> 34:49.300]  Yes, sir, I am he and it is the 14th day of January 2013.
[34:49.300 --> 34:55.260]  And if you'd like to talk about all the incredible news taking place geopolitically, domestically,
[34:55.260 --> 35:02.420]  the economy, by the way, start sending your questions in at Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[35:02.420 --> 35:08.580]  And guys, will you start printing me or ask Christie, who helps run the Twitter account
[35:08.580 --> 35:10.820]  does a great job.
[35:10.820 --> 35:16.340]  Maybe ask her to print off questions for Obama phone lady.
[35:16.340 --> 35:22.880]  Show that when Michelle, that's her first name, so that when Michelle is in here in
[35:22.880 --> 35:27.660]  about an hour from now, we can also have some of your questions for Obama phone lady who
[35:27.660 --> 35:33.420]  we've flown down to Austin, Texas, to really have the archetypal Obama supporter here in
[35:33.420 --> 35:36.280]  studio with us.
[35:36.280 --> 35:41.860]  And by the way, we've had archetypal Bush supporters on before, who thought it was conservative
[35:41.860 --> 35:45.080]  to get rid of the Bill of Rights and were pro torture.
[35:45.080 --> 35:50.500]  So they're just as nonsensical sometimes as well.
[35:50.500 --> 35:54.460]  So we look forward to having her here just because we hope to try to be able to change
[35:54.460 --> 35:55.460]  her mind.
[35:55.460 --> 35:58.540]  And it doesn't mean we want her to go support Romney.
[35:58.540 --> 36:02.660]  No, Romney sucks to quote Obama phone lady.
[36:02.660 --> 36:04.540]  The point is, is that it was a rigged game.
[36:04.540 --> 36:07.300]  So that is coming up if you just joined us.
[36:07.300 --> 36:08.880]  Yes, you heard me right.
[36:08.880 --> 36:16.220]  This is not a joke of the video of her arriving to Austin via aircraft is up on prisonplanet.com
[36:16.220 --> 36:17.220]  and infowars.com.
[36:17.220 --> 36:20.780]  In fact, have we tweeted Obama phone lady videos out?
[36:20.780 --> 36:22.060]  I don't think I've even done that.
[36:22.060 --> 36:24.180]  Will you guys tweet that out for me?
[36:24.180 --> 36:27.940]  Cuz it's hard for me to walk and chew gum.
[36:27.940 --> 36:29.460]  I've come here to do two things.
[36:29.460 --> 36:33.060]  One thing is to kick butt and the other thing is to chew bubble gum and I'm all out of bubble
[36:33.060 --> 36:34.060]  gum.
[36:34.060 --> 36:36.980]  To quote, to paraphrase Rowdy Piper, okay, I'm being silly.
[36:36.980 --> 36:42.760]  The point is, I wanna send out a tweet that Obama phone lady discovered, Obama phone lady's
[36:42.760 --> 36:45.580]  identity discovered.
[36:45.580 --> 36:47.820]  It's kind of dictation, I'm dictating the tweet there.
[36:47.820 --> 36:51.540]  Okay, you can tell I'm excited about this, even though we've got a lot of bad news and
[36:51.540 --> 36:52.540]  some good news here.
[36:52.540 --> 36:54.100]  And we're gonna be going over.
[36:54.100 --> 37:00.700]  By the way, this shirt sold out, this shirt sold out, but they had a feeling it was gonna
[37:00.700 --> 37:01.700]  sell out.
[37:01.700 --> 37:07.700]  And so there is a truck coming, but tomorrow with more of these.
[37:07.700 --> 37:10.620]  So you'll basically should be able to get it by next week.
[37:10.620 --> 37:12.420]  Get your order in now.
[37:12.420 --> 37:14.140]  We've never had a t-shirt sell like this.
[37:14.140 --> 37:20.140]  It is a come and take it AK-47 with the Texas come and take it, Texas Revolutionary War
[37:20.140 --> 37:21.140]  segment.
[37:21.140 --> 37:27.220]  It says come and take it and inside of the AK-47 is the right to keep and bear arms shall
[37:27.220 --> 37:30.300]  not be infringed.
[37:30.300 --> 37:35.100]  And then it says infoawars.com handsomely on the back.
[37:35.100 --> 37:40.540]  And we've got women asking for a woman's design, that'll take some time, but we got smalls
[37:40.540 --> 37:41.540]  for women.
[37:41.540 --> 37:45.860]  Yes, we're going to come out with some shirts for women, people been, I get requested on
[37:45.860 --> 37:46.860]  the street all the time.
[37:46.860 --> 37:52.380]  I never tell my folks, we gotta come out with women's shirts, and with the same messages,
[37:52.380 --> 37:55.280]  but that are more contour form fitting.
[37:55.280 --> 38:00.020]  My wife has said this, and so we've got to do it.
[38:00.020 --> 38:02.540]  So there I'm multitasking here on air.
[38:02.540 --> 38:05.780]  If you want the come and take it shirt, get your order in now.
[38:05.780 --> 38:11.100]  And of course, we also have the second best selling, Victory or Death with the rattlesnake
[38:11.100 --> 38:12.100]  on it.
[38:12.100 --> 38:16.940]  Very powerful, we also have a camouflage one of those, not just the black on red one.
[38:16.940 --> 38:23.860]  It's all up at infoawarsstore.com and your purchase of the books, the videos, the T-shirts,
[38:23.860 --> 38:28.300]  all of it makes this broadcast possible.
[38:28.300 --> 38:33.580]  So they're all up there on the site right now, be sure and get it today.
[38:33.580 --> 38:35.660]  And again, continue to spread the word about the transmission.
[38:35.660 --> 38:40.620]  I'm certainly risking my life, my treasure, my name, everything else in this fight.
[38:40.620 --> 38:43.780]  So I'm not saying the least you can do, we appreciate your support.
[38:43.780 --> 38:47.740]  And the point is, this isn't a game, we shouldn't take this platform for granted.
[38:47.740 --> 38:51.860]  That's why I'm working so much harder than I ever have, because we've got to make hay
[38:51.860 --> 38:52.860]  while the sun shines.
[38:52.860 --> 38:56.420]  We've got to engage the globalists while we still have a lot of freedom left.
[38:56.420 --> 39:02.900]  Now, I told you before we went to break that, people are always saying, you never give the
[39:02.900 --> 39:03.900]  number or the address out.
[39:03.900 --> 39:06.300]  You're right, not everybody's on the internet or wants to order via the internet.
[39:06.300 --> 39:10.500]  You can call and order any T-shirts or propure water filters discounted with promo code WATER
[39:10.500 --> 39:17.740]  ALL of it, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[39:17.740 --> 39:19.980]  And you can also write to us here at P.O.
[39:19.980 --> 39:23.980]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760, P.O.
[39:23.980 --> 39:27.780]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[39:27.780 --> 39:31.660]  I give that out so rarely that I don't even have it memorized.
[39:31.660 --> 39:32.660]  So P.O.
[39:32.660 --> 39:38.180]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760, and we've had that address now for about six years.
[39:38.180 --> 39:41.460]  So that'll give you an idea.
[39:41.460 --> 39:45.620]  A lot of survival stuff, the best quality stuff out there.
[39:45.620 --> 39:54.880]  We've got the very best essential oil systems put out by our friends over at Interfood.
[39:54.880 --> 39:59.980]  We've got the Army Ranger style black caps, it's come to the Oathkeeper style in fullwars.com.
[39:59.980 --> 40:00.980]  Okay, I'm done plugging.
[40:00.980 --> 40:02.980]  I just haven't been plugging much the last month.
[40:02.980 --> 40:08.660]  I've been so focused on defending the Second Amendment that I haven't even been midair
[40:08.660 --> 40:11.340]  refueling our news operation system.
[40:11.340 --> 40:16.140]  Cuz we're not like the mainstream media that gets government bailouts and tax exemptions
[40:16.140 --> 40:19.940]  and then tries to overthrow the Republic, tries to get your taxes raised cuz they get
[40:19.940 --> 40:22.020]  the corporate welfare bailout money.
[40:22.020 --> 40:24.460]  They're subsidiaries of banks that do.
[40:24.460 --> 40:25.860]  We just sell products we believe in.
[40:25.860 --> 40:29.700]  And of course, the media says that's horrible, that's evil.
[40:29.700 --> 40:36.940]  How dare us, how dare us, how dare us, how dare us, pay our own way, promoting high quality
[40:36.940 --> 40:38.480]  products at great prices.
[40:38.480 --> 40:39.480]  It's totally immoral.
[40:39.480 --> 40:45.680]  And that's what they always say at CNN, you name it.
[40:45.680 --> 40:49.340]  They always say the same thing, they say I'm evil.
[40:49.340 --> 40:53.360]  And every time the national media comes to interview me, they go, how dare you make money?
[40:53.360 --> 40:56.380]  This is a pretty big operation, you got a lot of crew members, you got a lot of equipment
[40:56.380 --> 40:57.380]  here.
[40:57.380 --> 40:58.380]  You're making money, that's bad.
[40:58.380 --> 41:01.660]  I'm like, well, did you fly here, first class?
[41:01.660 --> 41:03.740]  You did, didn't you?
[41:03.740 --> 41:04.740]  You're in New York, aren't you?
[41:04.740 --> 41:06.140]  How much you paid a year?
[41:06.140 --> 41:09.100]  Oh, a million dollars, read off a teleprompter.
[41:09.100 --> 41:11.220]  You're here lecturing me.
[41:11.220 --> 41:16.340]  Anyway, side issue, just amazing how they play these mind games with us.
[41:16.340 --> 41:19.020]  Here's the toll free number to join us.
[41:19.020 --> 41:29.540]  It's 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[41:29.540 --> 41:33.620]  Well, that high def camera's so good, you can even see the dust on top, the live on
[41:33.620 --> 41:34.620]  air right there.
[41:34.620 --> 41:35.620]  No, that's okay.
[41:35.620 --> 41:37.620]  It's not your job to clean in here.
[41:37.620 --> 41:38.620]  I think we do have a cleaning crew.
[41:38.620 --> 41:39.940]  I don't think they ever come in here though.
[41:39.940 --> 41:42.380]  I guess because they see it as like the big studio.
[41:42.380 --> 41:43.780]  Oh my gosh.
[41:43.780 --> 41:48.780]  There's like a dead fruit fly over there or something.
[41:48.780 --> 41:56.820]  We're to start here, 800-259-9231, on any issue you wish to discuss, I got a couple
[41:56.820 --> 41:57.820]  of news items.
[41:57.820 --> 42:00.620]  I want to hit them and then we're going to your phone calls.
[42:00.620 --> 42:07.980]  And let me just show folks in the document cam, hey, hey guys, we got a camera mounted
[42:07.980 --> 42:08.980]  in there.
[42:08.980 --> 42:09.980]  Can we punch that up for viewers?
[42:09.980 --> 42:11.980]  Here, come on over and say hi to folks.
[42:11.980 --> 42:14.340]  No, no, just right there in that microphone.
[42:14.340 --> 42:17.540]  Hello fans, Obama phone lady here.
[42:17.540 --> 42:18.980]  How's that audio, Genesis?
[42:18.980 --> 42:19.980]  Show today.
[42:19.980 --> 42:22.380]  You better open your phones in your head.
[42:22.380 --> 42:25.500]  Hey, can you give a shout out to everybody?
[42:25.500 --> 42:28.020]  No, go ahead.
[42:28.020 --> 42:33.780]  I'm going to give a shout out to everybody here in Austin, Texas.
[42:33.780 --> 42:35.900]  I'm on the Alex Jones show.
[42:35.900 --> 42:40.500]  I'm the Obama phone lady representing Alex Jones here today.
[42:40.500 --> 42:42.660]  And I love that guy.
[42:42.660 --> 42:44.780]  He's funny like me.
[42:44.780 --> 42:51.300]  Oh my goodness, there's no doubt, and I'm not just saying this, you could do voiceovers
[42:51.300 --> 42:52.300]  immediately.
[42:52.300 --> 42:55.740]  I'm going to work on your radio station before I leave here.
[42:55.740 --> 42:56.740]  I think you might.
[42:56.740 --> 42:58.140]  Have you heard the news?
[42:58.140 --> 43:05.140]  I'm going to officially offer you on air, at least an auxiliary paid job as a reporter.
[43:05.140 --> 43:08.780]  All right, hallelujah, yes, thank you.
[43:08.780 --> 43:12.580]  I also want to make sure you like the terms, I'm going to work it all out, but I'm very
[43:12.580 --> 43:13.580]  glad you're excited.
[43:13.580 --> 43:16.380]  I'm excited about that, I need a job.
[43:16.380 --> 43:19.020]  Darn it, May, Obama, you see what you've done?
[43:19.020 --> 43:26.620]  I'm moving up in the world, you're going to do your job, I'm going to set you down.
[43:26.620 --> 43:28.620]  What do you think of the rest of the crew?
[43:28.620 --> 43:29.620]  I love the crew.
[43:29.620 --> 43:33.300]  You got your kids out, anytime you can go to work and bring your kids, that's the job.
[43:33.300 --> 43:34.740]  That's what I'm trying to get to.
[43:34.740 --> 43:39.180]  That's right, well, don't give out too many of our security issues, but yes, no, my son,
[43:39.180 --> 43:40.180]  I'm just joking.
[43:40.180 --> 43:45.140]  Jakari, what do you think of all this, Jakari Jackson back there?
[43:45.140 --> 43:50.660]  This is quite a deal for me, Michelle and I have something in common, we just made a
[43:50.660 --> 43:57.780]  YouTube video and somebody liked our voice enough to give us a job, so I can relate to
[43:57.780 --> 44:00.500]  her on that.
[44:00.500 --> 44:02.100]  Thank you, Jesus, well.
[44:02.100 --> 44:06.500]  He's the man, he's the man, but Obama with the man with the plan, but we're going to
[44:06.500 --> 44:07.500]  see what he's going to do.
[44:07.500 --> 44:11.780]  If he don't do the right thing, I'm going to be the woman with the plan, Michelle Obama
[44:11.780 --> 44:13.580]  and Michelle Dowery.
[44:13.580 --> 44:17.740]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, all right, you think I'm joking, she's here, some people
[44:17.740 --> 44:19.380]  still think I'm joking.
[44:19.380 --> 44:23.780]  I mean, I think everybody is more freaked out about you being here in a good way than
[44:23.780 --> 44:26.260]  when I've had movie stars here walking around in the halls.
[44:26.260 --> 44:30.660]  And I got the blood of Jesus, baby, I'm here, all right?
[44:30.660 --> 44:34.860]  All right, we're very excited, ladies and gentlemen, she is in the house.
[44:34.860 --> 44:40.100]  I'll tell you, guys, why don't we get her some lunch or something, or take her back
[44:40.100 --> 44:44.940]  in the green room, because it's so exciting to have her here that I can barely even operate
[44:44.940 --> 44:45.940]  right now.
[44:45.940 --> 44:50.980]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'll tell you what, Michelle, run in here real quick.
[44:50.980 --> 44:55.980]  Run in here real quick, Michelle, come on in the studio, come on, we got to give people
[44:55.980 --> 44:58.380]  a taste of this right now.
[44:58.380 --> 45:00.820]  Come on right around here.
[45:00.820 --> 45:03.260]  That's right, no, no, come on right over here by my microphone, you're just going to pop
[45:03.260 --> 45:05.700]  in for a moment, okay, come on in.
[45:05.700 --> 45:08.900]  We've got the camera right over here, say hi to folks right there.
[45:08.900 --> 45:09.900]  Hello, folks.
[45:09.900 --> 45:12.100]  Let's go to this camera right here, guys.
[45:12.100 --> 45:14.700]  Hello, folks, I'm here today, the Obama phone lady.
[45:14.700 --> 45:17.060]  Here she is, here, here, talking the mic, oops, go ahead.
[45:17.060 --> 45:22.500]  I'm here today, you guys, I'm here in Austin, Texas, I'm at the Alex Jones show, I want
[45:22.500 --> 45:27.740]  you guys to represent, I'm here, the Obama phone lady, I arrive, I'm ready to get it
[45:27.740 --> 45:29.060]  going on, let's do it.
[45:29.060 --> 45:31.620]  All right, we'll see you in here in about an hour.
[45:31.620 --> 45:34.060]  Good job, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[45:34.060 --> 45:39.040]  That is proof of life, as they say, all right, absolutely, ladies and gentlemen, there she
[45:39.040 --> 45:40.040]  is.
[45:40.040 --> 45:46.020]  Okay, now let's shift gears into the really, really bad news.
[45:46.020 --> 45:52.140]  And again, guys, I hear another mic open now, whatever's going on, okay, got that mic shut
[45:52.140 --> 45:56.740]  down cuz you get that taken care of, you know what I'm gonna do?
[45:56.740 --> 46:08.100]  They're moving ahead right now with draconian moves, where they're just gonna tell, as I
[46:08.100 --> 46:12.940]  told you, gun manufacturers, you can't manufacture this, no law, they're just gonna say it.
[46:12.940 --> 46:16.580]  They're moving ahead with telling shops you just can't sell guns.
[46:16.580 --> 46:21.860]  And Chuck Schumer has announced that, the article is up at infowars.com.
[46:21.860 --> 46:25.300]  New York has tentative deal on gun control, they're just gonna throw anybody they want
[46:25.300 --> 46:28.880]  in the nut house, no judge, no jury, you're just going to the nut house.
[46:28.880 --> 46:32.340]  And Rahm Emanuel is announcing in the Washington Post what he said years ago, they'll just
[46:32.340 --> 46:37.860]  put you on a no gun buy list, no judge, no jury, no proof, no nothing, you just disappear.
[46:37.860 --> 46:41.540]  Like Brandon Robb, the Marine, who criticized Obama.
[46:41.540 --> 46:46.020]  And so we are going to be discussing all of that today, but let me just go ahead and go
[46:46.020 --> 46:50.100]  to your phone calls right now here, ladies and gentlemen.
[46:50.100 --> 46:53.660]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dexter in Maryland.
[46:53.660 --> 46:56.540]  Dexter, you're on the air.
[46:56.540 --> 47:01.100]  Yeah, your phone's really, really low, brother.
[47:01.100 --> 47:02.100]  Is that an Obama phone?
[47:02.100 --> 47:03.100]  Is this a little better?
[47:03.100 --> 47:04.100]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[47:04.100 --> 47:12.900]  Okay, well, first of all, congratulations for Piers Morgan interview, that was epic.
[47:12.900 --> 47:17.220]  I do believe he'll have you back around too, who could be so desperate for ratings, and
[47:17.220 --> 47:19.220]  it would be huge.
[47:19.220 --> 47:23.340]  But what I wanted to talk about was Sandy Hook.
[47:23.340 --> 47:27.420]  I'm somebody that believes that there's some fishiness there, and I'd like to go through
[47:27.420 --> 47:28.420]  a couple of things.
[47:28.420 --> 47:30.620]  I'm not sure if you've seen all these things yet.
[47:30.620 --> 47:37.620]  First, have you seen the video where the little girl's father comes out, like the first guy
[47:37.620 --> 47:39.580]  that came out to give an interview?
[47:39.580 --> 47:42.620]  Yeah, he's laughing and smiling, and he says, do I read off the card?
[47:42.620 --> 47:47.660]  And then he turns the camera and then breaks, and then sits there and looks like he's forcing
[47:47.660 --> 47:48.660]  himself to cry.
[47:48.660 --> 47:56.260]  And then it looks like bad acting from the worst soap opera you've ever seen.
[47:56.260 --> 48:02.300]  But people act strange under incredible pressure, so none of us know what he's going through.
[48:02.300 --> 48:08.260]  So my prayers go out to him and his family.
[48:08.260 --> 48:10.860]  But yeah, a lot of people are investigating the whole thing.
[48:10.860 --> 48:17.020]  Well, one thing that's weird about him is that his daughter, by the end of the day,
[48:17.020 --> 48:23.300]  she had a Facebook page up that was a tribute that was already looking for money.
[48:23.300 --> 48:27.540]  It seems kind of odd that so quickly, just a few hours after-
[48:27.540 --> 48:28.540]  Well, listen, here's the deal.
[48:28.540 --> 48:29.540]  I appreciate your call, bro.
[48:29.540 --> 48:35.380]  Look, I don't know about that, and I'm not going to talk about parents of dead kids,
[48:35.380 --> 48:36.780]  okay?
[48:36.780 --> 48:40.300]  And see, I don't know if that's true.
[48:40.300 --> 48:41.740]  That's something I haven't seen.
[48:41.740 --> 48:46.980]  And so it's just, I'm not gonna talk about somebody who lost his daughter.
[48:46.980 --> 48:51.940]  Yes, there wasn't the AR-15 inside the school, yes, it was in the car, yes, there were multiple
[48:51.940 --> 48:53.220]  shooters outside.
[48:53.220 --> 48:57.980]  Mainstream media, RT has attacked me, saying, five-year-olds said they saw multiple shooters.
[48:57.980 --> 49:02.260]  No, it's on footage from the surveillance cameras, from the helicopter they put on the
[49:02.260 --> 49:05.740]  news, showing them arresting people in the woods dressed like the supposed shooter.
[49:05.740 --> 49:06.980]  And the whole thing's suspicious, okay?
[49:06.980 --> 49:09.140]  And I'm not trying to jump on you, caller.
[49:09.140 --> 49:12.900]  It's just that there are a lot of reports out there, a lot of people questioning the
[49:12.900 --> 49:13.900]  whole thing.
[49:13.900 --> 49:17.740]  But I'm not going to sit there and go after the dad.
[49:17.740 --> 49:24.300]  It's just, I'm gonna let other people do their own research, I'm gonna leave it at that.
[49:24.300 --> 49:26.780]  Jessica in Canada, you're on the air.
[49:26.780 --> 49:28.620]  Hi, Alex.
[49:28.620 --> 49:29.620]  Hey.
[49:29.620 --> 49:34.780]  I just wanted to, you did a great job with peers, and I just wanted to bring you up to
[49:34.780 --> 49:38.620]  date on a couple of things that are happening with Agenda 21 here in Canada.
[49:38.620 --> 49:40.020]  Tell us about it.
[49:40.020 --> 49:45.940]  Well, one, our environmental commissioner here in Ontario has decided that food waste
[49:45.940 --> 49:49.340]  is an environmental problem.
[49:49.340 --> 49:52.740]  And I just noticed that the UN has taken up this issue, so they're coming after our food,
[49:52.740 --> 49:53.740]  Alex.
[49:53.740 --> 49:56.700]  No, no, they're going to, they've already done this in England, and they're going to
[49:56.700 --> 49:59.900]  tax you for everything that goes in the trash can.
[49:59.900 --> 50:04.200]  And they're going to have RFID on all the products that is scanned, this is already
[50:04.200 --> 50:10.240]  happening in London, to track, and they'll give you $3,000 fines for every attraction.
[50:10.240 --> 50:13.380]  It's already on the books in several Florida cities.
[50:13.380 --> 50:16.140]  And they go, don't worry, we'll never implement it.
[50:16.140 --> 50:20.500]  Kind of like they put it on the books under federal grants, start taking blood without
[50:20.500 --> 50:24.100]  warrants 15 years ago, now they're doing it.
[50:24.100 --> 50:28.860]  So you're absolutely right, Agenda 21 is a total surveillance grid where all the appliances
[50:28.860 --> 50:34.060]  track you, and where they tax you to the point of total bankruptcy.
[50:34.060 --> 50:37.180]  It's to make sure you stay poor.
[50:37.180 --> 50:40.700]  And that you have to go on government subsistence so they can then shoot you up with deadly
[50:40.700 --> 50:41.700]  vaccines.
[50:41.700 --> 50:46.540]  Have you looked into Idle No More, because it looks like the Tides Foundation is radicalizing
[50:46.540 --> 50:48.620]  our natives up here.
[50:48.620 --> 50:52.180]  Yeah, it's everywhere, the Tides Foundation is involved in a ton of stuff.
[50:52.180 --> 50:54.660]  Did you have anything else you wanted to add on the agenda 21?
[50:54.660 --> 50:58.580]  Nope, this is on Land Use Planner, and I've been fighting this for eight years.
[50:58.580 --> 51:01.500]  Well, good job, you give them hell.
[51:01.500 --> 51:06.820]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[51:06.820 --> 51:07.820]  Box.
[51:07.820 --> 51:10.780]  I want you to know some very important information.
[51:10.780 --> 51:15.580]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[51:15.580 --> 51:19.900]  House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[51:19.900 --> 51:25.460]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[51:25.460 --> 51:30.540]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[51:30.540 --> 51:35.700]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[51:35.700 --> 51:36.820]  normal cell.
[51:36.820 --> 51:40.580]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[51:40.580 --> 51:44.580]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[51:59.860 --> 52:00.860]  That's your immune system.
[52:00.860 --> 52:03.860]  It's the only one you've got.
[52:03.860 --> 52:08.460]  Big business has discovered the preparedness market, and that makes it difficult to know
[52:08.460 --> 52:10.660]  where to go and who to trust.

[53:02.220 --> 53:07.740]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[53:07.740 --> 53:13.640]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional
[53:13.640 --> 53:17.260]  burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[53:17.260 --> 53:22.300]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near
[53:22.300 --> 53:26.780]  a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching
[53:26.780 --> 53:29.820]  TV when I'm actually away from home.
[53:29.820 --> 53:34.420]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet, just like a light on a timer.
[53:34.420 --> 53:38.300]  And they're so easy to use, you just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[53:38.300 --> 53:42.340]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[53:42.340 --> 53:45.420]  Fake TV is only $34.95.
[53:45.420 --> 53:52.660]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to Faketv.com.
[53:52.660 --> 53:58.540]  That's 877-532-5388 or Faketv.com.
[53:58.540 --> 54:18.380]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[54:18.380 --> 54:28.660]  And he decides who to free and who to blame, everybody won't be treated all the same.
[54:28.660 --> 54:39.900]  There'll be a golden letter reaching down when the man comes around.
[54:39.900 --> 54:40.900]  We are back live.
[54:40.900 --> 54:42.540]  The hairs on your arm will stand up.
[54:42.540 --> 54:44.540]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[54:44.540 --> 54:46.540]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[54:46.540 --> 54:49.500]  George in Texas, you're on the air.
[54:49.500 --> 54:53.140]  I noticed you called in about gun control, you volunteered.
[54:53.140 --> 54:59.380]  Are you excited that they're trial ballooning executive orders, ATF rulemaking, or just
[54:59.380 --> 55:04.700]  Chuckie Schumer ordering Walmart and others to stop selling semi-autos?
[55:04.700 --> 55:09.780]  I mean, they're really trying to see if they can just sell us on being dictators.
[55:09.780 --> 55:12.840]  Yeah, I absolutely agree.
[55:12.840 --> 55:18.380]  And I first wanted to congratulate you on your appearance with Piers Morgan on CNN,
[55:18.380 --> 55:20.060]  the state-run media.
[55:20.060 --> 55:22.420]  And I believe you did exactly what it takes.
[55:22.420 --> 55:25.260]  I think they're scared because you broke the spell.
[55:25.260 --> 55:30.660]  And I think this rush and this barrage of legislation, all the draconian legislation
[55:30.660 --> 55:35.540]  that's coming out, I think it's very clear that you forced their hand.
[55:35.540 --> 55:36.540]  And I don't think they were ready.
[55:36.540 --> 55:39.460]  I think it's too early for them and that's why they're so upset.
[55:39.460 --> 55:43.460]  Well, I don't think I did it, but I'm certainly part of it, and so are you.
[55:43.460 --> 55:45.820]  We're all together in this.
[55:45.820 --> 55:48.940]  But earlier I said I would get into the victory, get into what's positive.
[55:48.940 --> 55:54.060]  I haven't really done that yet, but I've already said it before, 10 million guns sold last
[55:54.060 --> 55:55.060]  month.
[55:55.060 --> 55:56.500]  They're talking about more guns sold this month.
[55:56.500 --> 55:59.260]  They're saying soon everything will be sold out.
[55:59.260 --> 56:02.380]  There won't even be bolt action 22s.
[56:02.380 --> 56:04.620]  Everything is going to be sold out.
[56:04.620 --> 56:06.940]  The ammo is selling out everywhere.
[56:06.940 --> 56:08.540]  That's the real vote.
[56:08.540 --> 56:12.540]  America knows the government is criminal and can't be trusted.
[56:12.540 --> 56:16.460]  America knows we're going into a depression and the state run media lies.
[56:16.460 --> 56:20.900]  And we've talked about what to name the corporate globalist trader media.
[56:20.900 --> 56:21.900]  That's it.
[56:21.900 --> 56:24.340]  It's state run media.
[56:24.340 --> 56:26.580]  That's the best term for it.
[56:26.580 --> 56:31.240]  And we're dealing with a global corporate fascist state that uses socialism at the grassroots
[56:31.240 --> 56:33.540]  to control us like flypaper.
[56:33.540 --> 56:35.380]  And there is a revolt.
[56:35.380 --> 56:37.060]  People are waking up.
[56:37.060 --> 56:42.020]  And that's why they're trying to act all confident and we've got a mandate for socialism now.
[56:42.020 --> 56:43.960]  Obama wasn't really reelected.
[56:43.960 --> 56:48.140]  They had that thing fixed seven ways to Sunday, running him up against that political corpse
[56:48.140 --> 56:50.980]  Romney election.
[56:50.980 --> 56:56.960]  But even the evidence shows even though Romney was a dead horse, still he really beat Obama
[56:56.960 --> 57:00.600]  of the election fraud evidence shows and not that that would have been good.
[57:00.600 --> 57:01.920]  He's globalist as well.
[57:01.920 --> 57:04.700]  They just think Obama can con people better.
[57:04.700 --> 57:05.700]  I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[57:05.700 --> 57:08.380]  No, no, no, no, you're good.
[57:08.380 --> 57:10.140]  And you know, I'd like to make two points with you.
[57:10.140 --> 57:14.540]  I'd like you to explain to people just what a semiautomatic weapon actually is, because
[57:14.540 --> 57:19.260]  I don't think a lot of people realize that it includes pistols and handguns.
[57:19.260 --> 57:24.420]  I think they associate it with fully automatic and they associate it with assault rifles
[57:24.420 --> 57:26.420]  and they don't understand exactly what.
[57:26.420 --> 57:31.460]  Well, Feinstein has called for even revolvers to be banned before, but technically a semiauto
[57:31.460 --> 57:35.600]  is pull the trigger once a bullet fires, pull it again, it fires again.
[57:35.600 --> 57:40.340]  And they obsess over full auto that's worthless for actually killing people if you wanna be
[57:40.340 --> 57:41.340]  selective about it.
[57:41.340 --> 57:44.460]  That's what the military doesn't use full auto, unless it's a heavy machine gun with
[57:44.460 --> 57:50.300]  big boxes of ammo in emplacements to take out large numbers of infantry.
[57:50.300 --> 57:54.500]  Or sometimes even used on the ground to mark targets in a primitive way for aircraft that
[57:54.500 --> 57:55.500]  are coming in.
[57:55.500 --> 58:02.500]  They use tracers to mark targets and do other things, but that's another issue studying
[58:02.500 --> 58:04.160]  military warfare.
[58:04.160 --> 58:08.700]  The truth is, when they say ban semiautos, you don't need assault rifles and they show
[58:08.700 --> 58:14.860]  a scary looking black M16, why people think that's scary, I don't know.
[58:14.860 --> 58:18.360]  And then they are saying, let's just get rid of these, when really it gets rid of almost
[58:18.360 --> 58:21.200]  all guns, almost all shotguns, everything.
[58:21.200 --> 58:26.260]  Most guns are semiauto and they wanna get rid of them, but their new bills even get
[58:26.260 --> 58:28.980]  rid of pump shotguns.
[58:28.980 --> 58:33.100]  So I mean, they're coming for almost everything, does that answer what you wanted me to do?
[58:33.100 --> 58:37.820]  No, yeah, absolutely, and if I could, I'd like to tie that into an article you just
[58:37.820 --> 58:40.060]  had run yesterday on the death of Aaron Schwart.
[58:40.060 --> 58:41.060]  Yeah, stay there.

[59:55.940 --> 01:00:07.660]  Raging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:12.460]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:13.460]  You want answers?
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.580]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:19.780]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:23.900]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:31.420]  All right, we're taking your phone calls ahead of Obama phone lady joining us in studio.
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:35.660]  Now I'm going to have a serious talk with her.
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:43.300]  And sure, we will have her on as a example of collectivization.
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:47.940]  And at the same time, though, that she's a smart lady and has humanity in her, like all
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:52.580]  of us do, and then hopefully I can get through to her about Obama.
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.980]  So that is coming up.
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:59.300]  But Georgia and Texas, yeah, Obama killed this critic found dead in New York City, prominent
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:05.060]  American blogger, and the guy that really headed up killing SOPA, the Internet takeover,
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.460]  found hung.
[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:13.820]  And they were trying to put him in jail for 35 years for downloading some MIT policy papers,
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:18.260]  research papers that taxpayers paid for, and posting them for the public to have.
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:21.500]  Talk about military industrial complex, so they say, he committed suicide.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.500]  That's what they'll do.
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.940]  They'll indict you, say you're depressed and kill you.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:28.260]  Listen, if I ever get indicted, I'm going to fight it forever.
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.180]  I will never commit suicide.
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:33.860]  And what they do is, even though the DC madam sat on my show, she never committed suicide.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:36.940]  And then I knew behind the scenes she was being followed, being harassed.
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:41.420]  And I even had her condo manager on saying he was friends with her and that he even gave
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.420]  me her handwriting.
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:43.420]  It wasn't her.
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.020]  They put out the suicide note, wasn't even close.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:49.900]  A totally different handwriting and that she was being followed by men, was bringing stuff
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:50.900]  over to her mothers.
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:54.380]  She killed her and her mothers out in the shed.
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.420]  And she said, I'll never commit suicide.
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.740]  And then of course, somebody says, I'll never commit suicide.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:04.460]  They have a quote, friend, someone who doesn't even really know them, always comes out in
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:08.860]  the news and said, shit, she told me she was gonna commit suicide.
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:09.860]  So that's what will happen.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:16.500]  If they ever kill me, they'll have a friend come out and say, Alex told me he was.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:21.040]  And that person, that person was told by the killers and paid by the killer to do it.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:24.620]  That person, that's the person involved, okay?
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.100]  You understand that?
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.540]  Cuz that's a bunch of baloney.
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:32.700]  If I was diagnosed with cancer, I will go with Darth Vader level surgeries and everything
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:33.700]  else.
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:34.700]  Alternative, you name it, okay?
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:42.420]  I'm gonna go out of this world kicking and screaming and snapping like a crocodile, okay?
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:43.660]  Let's just get that straight.
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.940]  I'm going all the way, okay?
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:50.700]  Darth Vader level medicine, brain surgery, you name it, lungs out on the table, open
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:53.300]  heart surgery, whatever it is, I'm doing it.
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.220]  Let's get that straight.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:03:00.740]  I'm never gonna commit suicide, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never,
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.100]  never, never, never, never, never.
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.500]  And I would never murder, suicide my family.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:11.140]  That's one of their other favorites, just to wipe out a whole family.
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:15.420]  Never that ever happens, God forbid, knock on wood, pray to Jesus, it won't happen.
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:17.220]  And you know I was killed.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:20.020]  Real fast, your comments on that, George?
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:23.260]  I'm glad you said that, cuz this is really a personal issue for me.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:26.620]  The similarities between myself and Aaron Swartz, this is George from Austin.
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:29.420]  I was out at the drone mob event, you had me in studio.
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:35.300]  I did the drone peaceful protest, and I actually just made a video and uploaded it saying the
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.300]  exact same thing.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:40.100]  I took a cue from you after the Piers Morgan show, yeah, I saw your videos when you're
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.100]  in the hotel, you're being followed, I saw the security guy.
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:48.420]  And so I felt I had to make a video and post it up on YouTube saying the exact same thing.
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:53.180]  I'll never commit suicide, I love my life, I love my country, and I believe the solution
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:59.980]  to this is just to tell the truth, wake people up, political commentary, and you know, it's
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:05.260]  really sad that I'm in fear that I could end up in the exact same situation.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:09.420]  And so I posted that video up on YouTube, and I don't know if you would allow me to,
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.860]  but I'd really feel a lot safer if your listeners could go take a look at it.
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:13.860]  Sure, what's the name of it?
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:17.580]  This is your video, it's YouTube.com slash Young Truthers.
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:24.140]  All right, listen, I gotta jump, but listen, folks, the number one cause of death is automobile
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.140]  accidents.
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:29.660]  Well, not anymore now, it's suicide, people killing themselves, then it's cars.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:34.140]  You're risking your life every day driving with cars going 70 in this lane, you're going
[01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:35.140]  70 in this lane.
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:38.700]  If you hit it's 140 mile an hour, you're dead, I don't care how many seatbelts you're wearing,
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.660]  you're dead 99% of the time, okay, you're dead.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:45.620]  I drive on roads where people die every week, okay?
[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:51.340]  And I still do it cuz I like to drive, folks, take their power away, you're gonna die anyway
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:52.340]  someday.
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:55.500]  Let me tell you, they keep killing people like this, folks aren't gonna put up with
[01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:59.160]  it, and I'm not calling for that, but New World Order folks are the ones better watch
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.820]  their butts.

[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:06.820]  She's the lady who talked about Obama gave us a phone and he's going to do more.
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:07.820]  Obama phone.

[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:25.380]  Hey.
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:26.380]  Hold on.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.380]  Obama.
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.380]  You got Obama phone?
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:29.380]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority, got Obama phone.
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:30.380]  Keep Obama in, president, you know.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.380]  He gave us a phone.

[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:42.140]  By the way, guys, that's enough.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:47.120]  We are playing her out of the studio and she's right there sitting behind him.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.420]  And I gotta be honest, I mean, I'm getting goosebumps here and butterflies.
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.100]  Ma'am, can you please go to the green room?
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.860]  You're such a big star and I'm not joking for whatever reason.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:00.540]  I'm having trouble continuing the broadcast here with you in there.
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:06.100]  Do you get that chocolate shake I got you?
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:10.300]  She's awesome, absolutely awesome.
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.300]  She's right there.
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.140]  I see you, this is incredible.
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:15.140]  She's already in command.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.140]  She's, all right, you can stay there, that's fine.
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:19.940]  I just, it's, man, it is distracting.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:22.980]  I tell you, this is a real fringe benefit.
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:26.780]  It's like caviar, being able to have, that's one good thing about my job, I get to meet
[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:28.900]  interesting people.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:33.580]  And we've had a lot of famous people in this building, but I tell you, nobody like Obama
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:37.700]  phone lady, which by the way, the Democrats, she was working for them.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:42.420]  They went and put her on the desk job after that viral video you just saw.
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:47.740]  So, but we're gonna break that blockade here on air today with the Obama phone lady, but
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:51.880]  actually get down to the core of what this lady really stands for.
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:56.540]  And again, I sent the link out to the video when she was on the show at Real Alex Jones.
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:00.860]  Just go to Twitter, forward slash, Real Alex Jones, you wanna find the link to the video
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:06.800]  last night of us hanging out around Austin, Texas, that video now obviously going viral.
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:12.100]  And we're going to print, again, dozens of questions that listeners are sending in for
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:13.100]  her.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:16.820]  She'll be with us for an hour and a half while we take phone calls.
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:19.220]  We're gonna have her in studio and she's gonna do more.
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:23.580]  She's gonna answer your questions.
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:27.140]  She's gonna describe why Romney sucks and why he sucks bad.
[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:28.900]  So let's go back to your calls.
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:29.900]  You know what?
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:34.820]  Let me get one news item before I do that because I'll never get to it if I don't.
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:39.780]  Right here on the document cam if you're watching on television, radio listeners just search
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:45.300]  New York has tentative deal on gun control.
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.960]  And that's out of the Associated Press.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:54.860]  And they're going to have mental health law that allows for civil confinement of people
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:57.780]  determined to be a threat to others.
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:01.940]  And they're saying that if you criticize the government, that's a sign of mental illness.
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:05.120]  They're saying wanting to own guns is mental illness.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:11.980]  And here is a article out of the Washington Post today, where again, the so-called liberals
[01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:16.760]  or really the authoritarians, they dictate reality.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:23.260]  They say that when I went on Piers Morgan, that that was wrong, that I got in his face
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:28.100]  and that it was abnormal to yell or raise my voice.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:31.820]  Now Governor Cuomo raised his voice when he said we're gonna get the guns last week,
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:34.380]  started yelling and screaming, everybody was cheering.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:40.300]  Well that's okay, that's okay because he's calling for our rights to be taken.
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:43.580]  But when I said listen, don't try to take the guns or it'll cause a civil war, do you
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:44.660]  understand that?
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:47.360]  Ron Paul agreed with me two days later last week.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:51.580]  Just search Ron Paul says, Second Amendment is the line in the sand, attempt to take guns
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:53.900]  will cause civil war.
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:55.820]  Well, that's bad too.
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:13:00.180]  But when you read this article, whom does Alex Jones represent?
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:07.260]  They play this game of saying, mainline conservatives, Alex Jones represents you and this is bad.
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:11.180]  You're discredited now, your Second Amendment's discredited.
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:12.180]  It's a total mind game.
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:15.820]  It's like them saying, there are no bills that take any of your guns, it's a conspiracy
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:16.820]  theory.
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:19.100]  Though this bill does take your guns, it's no big deal.
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:23.300]  You're like, you just said you don't take my guns.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:30.140]  But because they're the boss, they're on the throne, up above us, in the clouds, okay,
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:37.700]  you've introduced 11 bills that some of them even take pump shotguns federally and they're
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:38.700]  at state levels.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:43.020]  And you've got state reps calling for door to door gun confiscation, mainstream news
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:45.020]  covered that yesterday.
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:49.660]  All of this is going on, the military training manuals for confiscating guns, all this is
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:53.020]  happening and they go, nobody wants your guns.
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:54.020]  Nobody's coming after your guns.
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:58.540]  And when that tank was slamming into the Waco church, and they had troops behind it firing
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:01.640]  their M16s into the building, the flare footage is clear.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.020]  They were saying, this is not an assault, come out with your hands up.
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:07.060]  And there's footage of Davidians coming out with their hands up, you can see their body
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:10.920]  resonance heat, the flare footage, and they just shoot them, they fall down, and the tank
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.740]  runs over them.
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:17.180]  But they said, this is not an assault, come out with your hands up.
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:23.180]  And when they would come out, this is too big of a distraction now, my son and Obama
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:29.500]  lady together, hey, hey, hey, hey, everybody out of the studio, seriously, out, out, okay?
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.620]  Yeah, that goes to my son, okay?
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:36.820]  It's a circus out there, man, I can't focus, there's all this stuff going on out there.
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:44.020]  Well, talk about chomping at the bit to be on the radio, that's my son.
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:46.960]  What is the point I was getting to here?
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:52.560]  They are selling everyone that they control reality.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:57.960]  And so number one, if so-called conservatives don't agree with what I say, that's fine.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:01.860]  We're not collectivist, I don't speak for you, you don't speak for me.
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:06.780]  But everybody's got to, we've got to be nice and turn some of our guns in, and we've got
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:10.500]  to not raise our voices, and we've got to, yeah.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:15.260]  How's that work for people that are constitutionalist, conservatives, libertarians, whatever you
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.260]  want to call it?
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:23.460]  I mean, Romney was for Obamacare, he wrote the thing for banning semi-autos, for open
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:31.300]  borders, for carbon taxes, should I keep going on here?
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:37.300]  And that's who they ran so he would lose, like a rigged Don King boxing match, I mean,
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.780]  come on, folks.
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:42.700]  And so I get up there and I go, listen, stop saying you don't want our guns, and stop saying
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:45.580]  this is about kids, this is about authoritarianism.
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:49.900]  You're on notice, don't start the Civil War, is that clear?
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:53.800]  You're a mouthpiece for globalist criminals, and I'm putting you on notice.
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.620]  That's exactly what, in fact, I wish I'd have been more hardcore, instead of even responding
[01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:00.740]  to anything he was saying.
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:04.980]  Now that hindsight's 20-20, I should have done more.
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:09.600]  Paul Revere wrote through the countryside when they came for the guns, saying to arms,
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:15.420]  to arms, the British are coming, the redcoats are coming, one is my land, two is my sea.
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:20.300]  Our forebears went out and killed people.
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:24.540]  I'm not calling for that, I don't want that to start, I wanna fix this peacefully.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:30.420]  But if so-called libertarians and conservatives can't handle somebody going, listen, you twit,
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:33.260]  go back to your country and stop telling me to turn my guns in.
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:43.220]  If they can't handle it, then may your chains set lightly upon you, lick the hand that feeds
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:45.420]  you, crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:48.780]  Will you guys print me the Patrick Henry, liberty or death speech?
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:53.340]  I mean, why does New Hampshire say liberty or death on the license plates?
[01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:56.620]  Why do we get a tear in our eyes at the Star Spangled Banner?
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:57.620]  What's that song about?
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:03.300]  It's about people on a fort under bombardment, not giving up.
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:08.860]  It's about ragtag farmers and people taking on a military that had defeated the Spanish,
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:13.180]  the French, the Dutch, the Portuguese, you want me to keep going here?
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:24.860]  I mean, the British Army a few years later beat Napoleon.
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:33.740]  And our ancestors literally had to go bushwhack people by the end of the war to get ammo.
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:37.460]  And they don't want you knowing about that, I'm up here just saying, hey, man, don't come
[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:41.420]  to my country and tell me turn my guns in and tell us collectively as gun owners that
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:44.420]  it's our fault somebody died.
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:46.460]  It's your fault for making that a gun free zone.
[01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:49.860]  It's your fault for advertising the place to go kill people as a school.
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:51.220]  Well, that really got to them.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:55.380]  They were going pull the plug when I said that they were no, no, no, cuz they know that
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:18:02.100]  they know for their their hype in school shootings every single day on corporate New World Order
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:10.820]  globalist run traitor media, hoping mentally ill people go into schools and shoot people.
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:14.780]  I mean, they are hyping copycatters like it's going out of style.
[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:17.840]  And I put them on notice, man, they're trying to get more kids killed.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:19.300]  They're the ones that set the whole thing up.
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:25.340]  They know full well that the drug inserts on those drugs, by the way, I've got Samjay
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:30.260]  Gupta, whoever he pronounces him the brain surgeon, Gupta and Tom Ridge.
[01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:34.460]  I saw a natural news article today, always great reporters, but I didn't see where the
[01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:40.780]  links were to Samjay Gupta and Ridge saying drugs are probably the cause of these shootings.
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:44.980]  So I went and searched what they said, it might have just been an oversight.
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:49.580]  And I actually found everything they said, I actually found the transcripts and the videos.
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:54.300]  I've got those, I told Paul Watson to add links to it.
[01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:56.500]  So good for that former head of Homeland Security.
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:57.700]  And what's going on with Tom Ridge?
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:59.900]  That guy has got like a conscience.
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:05.020]  He wrote a book saying Bush put out fake terror alerts as the pretext to take our liberties.
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:07.700]  And now he's come out and said, we gotta look at these drugs.
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:12.260]  That's the main unifying issue.
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:17.700]  I mean, good job, former head of Homeland Security Ridge.
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:19.420]  By the way, the head of Homeland Security is a puppet, folks.
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:22.180]  They usually don't even know half of what's going on.
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:25.020]  This is an outside shadow government, not the front guys, you see.
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.780]  And I'm not saying Ridge is a perfect guy.
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:31.800]  I'm seeing signs, though, that he's got a heart and a soul, and that's all I'm looking
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:32.800]  for.
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.860]  All right, we'll take some more calls and get Obama phone lady in here.
[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:42.420]  And the point is, is that they're telling you what is acceptable behavior.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:43.780]  They're telling you what reality is.
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:47.340]  They're telling you, you killed those kids collectively, so you have guilt.
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:49.220]  And that makes me angry.
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:53.740]  And they're trying to get more kids killed, okay?
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:56.740]  Now what would George Washington do?
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:59.820]  Would George Washington cower, appears Morgan?
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:03.180]  What would Thomas Paine do?
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:08.020]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:12.600]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.460]  by a disastrous economy?
[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:17.180]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:20.980]  At e Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:23.900]  life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:28.440]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:33.260]  are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:34.260]  and niece.
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:38.060]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:40.300]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

[01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:07.060]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water

[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:04.360]  What's going on with food prices?
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:08.740]  Have you noticed how your favorite ice cream is now 14 ounces instead of a pint?
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:14.580]  Round trip air fares into nine major cities has increased 44% in just one year.
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:20.820]  Ask your 18 to 25 year old what it costs to buy some nice fashionable jeans, $300?
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:26.020]  And yet not one person in a hundred realizes these prices reflect government spending and
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:28.480]  Federal Reserve Bank dollar printing.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:34.580]  Gold in the last 10 years has increased 450% while the dollar's purchasing power is declining
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.580]  daily.
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:36.940]  My name is Daniel Larson.
[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:38.900]  I work at Midas Resources.
[01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:43.500]  To learn more about how gold and silver can protect your dwindling purchasing power and

[01:22:55.660 --> 01:23:01.700]  Daniel Larson, 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:05.660]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:10.740]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:12.800]  This is really scary stuff.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:17.740]  Bates experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:22.040]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:25.700]  piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:28.580]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:32.460]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:38.140]  That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:40.940]  and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:46.700]  Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is,
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:51.700]  plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:56.300]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:57.300]  forever.
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:11.100]  And that's weirddevice.com.
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:27.500]  Coming up, we're not going to be fighting, though, but we are building it up the eye
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.060]  of the tiger.
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:37.100]  The Obama phone lady right here in Austin, Texas, rising up the thrill of the fight is
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:38.340]  the eye of the tiger.
[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:43.660]  In fact, we'll just re-intro her with this again, kind of like her royal entrance whenever
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:45.020]  she comes on the broadcast.
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:47.540]  It's the eye of the tiger.
[01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:48.540]  There it is.
[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:49.540]  Oh, yeah.
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:25:10.140]  It's the eye of the tiger.
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:11.140]  Let's go ahead.
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:14.140]  Everybody, you know you love that song, even though it's cheesy.
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:20.540]  Everybody knows when they're driving along, they turn this up.
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:21.540]  We're playing that off YouTube.
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:22.540]  It's not doing it justice.
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:23.540]  Here it is.
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:24.540]  Crank it up.
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:25.540]  Hey, she rose to the challenge.
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:36.540]  Put her down here to be with the crazy Texan.
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:48.820]  All right, Billy in California, you want to talk about Satan?
[01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:49.980]  Go ahead.
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:52.620]  You're on the air.
[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:54.620]  Thank you, Joan, for having me on right now.
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:55.620]  You bet, buddy.
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:56.620]  Yeah.
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:26:01.820]  Just just want to talk to you about Jimmy Fazil.
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:05.460]  They just recently found out in the UK articles, the UK articles that he was involved with
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:11.220]  for satanic ritualism, which is a really big shock, not to not to us, of course.
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:15.100]  But no, David, I said over a decade ago that he was a pedophile and a Satanist, and that's
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:16.100]  on record.
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:20.620]  And he said about a bunch of other people, you know, David, I worked at the BBC.
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:24.660]  You can say what you want about the guy, but, you know, like George Arwell, he worked at
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:27.100]  the highest levels of the BBC.
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:28.100]  And of course, Sevelle.
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.100]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:30.100]  That's now coming out the Satanism.
[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:31.100]  Yep.
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:36.740]  Yeah, basically, I was hoping, I know you do talk about this, you know, often about
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:41.740]  how Satanism is involved in this, and I was wondering maybe if you could do a future show
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:47.820]  really focusing on how deep Satanism has gone, you know, whether it be in Nazism, in the
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:53.580]  past, and how it's led America down this path of darkness, and just really showing
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:57.720]  people that, you know, we really need to understand that we're dealing with some super high
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:02.940]  level, dynamic activity here as it leads America down the path of destruction.
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:06.900]  Well, I mean, you could take one look at Jimmy Sevelle.
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:12.980]  I mean, I can tell pretty much if somebody's a real Luciferian, because they look like
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:13.980]  that in the eyes.
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:16.500]  I don't care if they're black, white, who they are.
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:21.260]  That's a guy that hung out with a royal family like no one else and hung out and quote supplied
[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:22.260]  things.
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:23.260]  He would brag.
[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:25.220]  I supply special things to government parties.
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:29.580]  And see, they don't trust you at the highest levels of government now, because here's the
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:30.580]  news, folks.
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.020]  They don't just hurt the children, okay?
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:40.140]  If it all comes out on this guy from my sources, they don't just watch snuff films, and we
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:41.980]  know that's a huge industry.
[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:43.840]  They produce them.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.140]  Let's put him back on screen.
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:51.940]  International Business Times, Jimmy Sevelle's satanic sex ring claim, star worship the devil.
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:54.780]  And all these top reporters are coming out and saying, yeah, he would just brag about
[01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:58.440]  worshiping the devil, how he was with the royal family.
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:02.340]  This is a guy who could get into the royal palaces, had his own keys and stuff.
[01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:05.820]  Nobody got that.
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:07.020]  And I mean, that's who they are.
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:08.020]  That's who we're fighting.
[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:10.220]  I mean, I sit here and that's why I should be so serious.
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:13.940]  I joke around and stuff because I can't be serious all the time, or I'd go crazy.
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:18.820]  But I mean, yes, we're dealing with Satanists that want to torture children to death.
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:20.400]  I mean, that's who we're fighting.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.380]  That's who runs the government.
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:25.540]  And if people don't get that, there's no future.
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:32.900]  Yeah, yeah, just basically when I talk to people about this stuff, that's eventually
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:34.980]  where I lead them to, and they don't wanna believe it.
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:38.460]  And then when they find out for themselves, they're like, wow, this is really happening.
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:39.460]  It's really in front of myself.
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:41.060]  I want people to learn to see the look.
[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:42.300]  Punch it back up.
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:43.940]  You see that guy?
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:45.260]  I have been to the court cases.
[01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:46.720]  I've covered it with a CPS.
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:48.080]  Half of them look like that.
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:52.220]  Men or women, black or white, they look just like that.
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:56.140]  When you're possessed by whatever demon is in those people, that's what it looks like
[01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:57.780]  on your screen if you're a TV viewer.
[01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:02.580]  If you don't know who Jimmy Savelle is, just search engine it and get ready.
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:10.140]  And let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that is a demon of hell, a demon of hell.
[01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:13.340]  And the only reason this is all coming out right now is the EU's blackmailing the British
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:17.220]  government to bring down England and put them into the EU.
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:21.060]  Yeah, you didn't know that's why this is all coming out right now?
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:22.340]  Even more even may come out.
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:25.260]  They may come out on the news someday and say, yeah, we chop kids' heads off and drink
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:28.500]  their blood as it sprays out of their, you know, stump.
[01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:31.500]  They'll be like, well, that's good, but I don't want to do that.
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:35.000]  Well, you're an extremist, you know, because the Aztecs cut kids' hearts out every day
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  when the sun came up.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.700]  And if you didn't think that was normal, they'd kill you.
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:39.900]  You're like, but that's crazy.
[01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:43.620]  No, when you're in the devil worshiper kingdom, you're crazy.
[01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:47.100]  See those of us that don't like all this and are like, hey, you're not getting my guns,
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:48.100]  devil worshippers.
[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:49.100]  They're like, you're mentally ill.
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:52.420]  We're going to have to put you in solitary.
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:53.700]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:56.100]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:30:03.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:08.140]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:12.720]  like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.580]  by a disastrous economy?
[01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:17.280]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:21.080]  At e foods direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:24.000]  life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.540]  After hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York city wrote, almost all of the grocery stores
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:33.360]  are closed, but I managed to get my e foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.360]  and niece.
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:38.160]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:40.400]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.740]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:10.540]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:16.580]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:17.580]  to the global takeover.
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:23.560]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarsoap.com.
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:27.220]  These are items that I did research on that I personally use.
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:32.220]  We've got the life straw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:36.940]  The Ktor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages are out
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:37.940]  in the field.
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:43.420]  Strategic relocation third edition by Joel Skousen when disaster strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:48.380]  Barrow safe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event and
[01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:51.220]  crank shortwave AM FM radios.

[01:32:58.380 --> 01:32:59.540]  We're getting prepared.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:02.020]  Are you infowarsoap.com
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:44.700]  Michelle Dowry is in studio with us, ladies and gentlemen, and we'll queue up the Obama
[01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:52.820]  phone famous audio video here in a moment for folks.
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:58.300]  So new listeners who don't know who she is can get a idea and be reminded.
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:02.140]  But when she flew into town last night, there were people at the airport taking photos shooting
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:04.100]  video of her.
[01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:07.980]  Also there were people when we went out to eat who were coming over wanting to take photographs
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:08.980]  with her.
[01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:11.640]  I mean, that's the power of YouTube.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:15.620]  And it wasn't just that it was somebody on there saying I want Obama to give me something.
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:17.280]  There's plenty of videos like that.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:19.620]  It's that she was interesting and she was funny.
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:28.420]  And so people ask why did you bring Obama phone lady down to Austin, Texas to be in
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:30.380]  studio with us?
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:34.340]  And her husband as well, who we've had a chance to hang out with, Harvey.
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:38.060]  We brought her down here because she's a phenomenon.
[01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:44.820]  And I guess the way she disappeared from being an obvious Democratic Party canvasser disappearing
[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:47.980]  that they had put her up in an office and that is indeed what she told me last night
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:50.460]  on video.
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:55.940]  And I thought, hey, let's actually hear from the person, the real person, not just a short
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:56.940]  clip.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:01.780]  Let's see what she really stands for, what she really believes in, just from a sociology
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:09.420]  perspective to really understand what is in the mind of someone who really thinks Obama's
[01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:10.420]  a great guy.
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:13.180]  There are a lot of people that think Mitt Romney was a great guy.
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:15.460]  I didn't like Mitt Romney either.
[01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:19.620]  Her son thinks that I'm a Republican because I don't like Obama.
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:22.820]  Whenever a Republican gets in office, people think I'm a Democrat because I don't like
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:23.820]  it.
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:29.660]  When Republican presidents are torturing and wars and all this, I just marvel at how when
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:34.780]  somebody's guy is in office, be they Republican or Democrat, they suddenly switch off their
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:35.780]  thinking process.
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:38.420]  And if the other party was doing that, they'd be upset.
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:43.060]  But because it's seen as their guy, well then everything is great.
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:47.420]  But here is the Obama phone lady clip.
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:48.420]  Here it is.
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:49.420]  You got Obama phone?
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:50.420]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority, got Obama phone.
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:51.420]  Keep Obama in president, you know.
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:52.420]  He gave us a phone.
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:53.420]  He gave you a phone.
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:54.420]  He's gonna do more.
[01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:55.420]  How'd he give you a phone?
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:56.420]  You sign up, you're on full stamps, you're on Social Security.
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:57.420]  You got low income, you disability.
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:35:58.420]  Hey, listen.
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:35:59.420]  Okay, what's wrong with Romney again?
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:00.420]  Romney, he sucks.
[01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:01.420]  Hey.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:14.020]  Obama.
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:15.020]  You got Obama phone?
[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:16.020]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority.
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:21.300]  Okay, now she's gonna be with us for the next hour and 20 minutes, maybe even into overdrive.
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:24.820]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, I know we've got callers on other issues holding, but you
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:28.160]  can address your question to myself.
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:33.580]  And of course, to Michelle Dowry, who is here in studio with us.
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:39.660]  But first off, Michelle, I wanna commend you for having the courage to come down here.
[01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:42.460]  Describe that thinking process and how that happened, and then tell people a little bit
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:43.460]  about yourself.
[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:48.420]  Okay, you fans, my name is Michelle Dowry, I live in Cleveland, Ohio.
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:53.220]  I work for the Obama campaign.
[01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:58.340]  The campaign was over November 11th.
[01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:04.500]  I went out and campaigned for Obama to get voters in to vote for Obama.
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:08.780]  One thing I liked what I did, this was like my second year campaigning.
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:12.980]  You know, he won this the second four years, the first four years I did it and it's the
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:13.980]  second.
[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:16.220]  A lot of people didn't know about voting.
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:19.220]  They thought if you had a warrant for your arrest, you couldn't vote.
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:22.560]  I explained to them that had anything to do with it.
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:28.180]  Some people wanted to vote, thought if they go get an ID that the police will get them,
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:29.180]  no.
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:35.580]  We had people that wasn't from this country, but they had foreign IDs, which they've been
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:37.060]  here two, three years.
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:42.300]  They need to go change it over and get a state ID to vote.
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:46.860]  It was very nice, very interesting what I did.
[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:52.580]  When you talk about people, US citizens that have been out of the country?
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:58.180]  We had people that was from overseas, a few of them that didn't even have Ohio state ID
[01:37:58.180 --> 01:37:59.780]  and been here two, three years.
[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:02.460]  So I explained- Were they US citizens?
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.300]  Yeah, they were not from Ohio.
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:06.620]  But they were US citizens.
[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:10.580]  They were US citizens now, but they didn't even take the effort to get their state ID
[01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:11.580]  yet.
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:15.980]  So I opened some doors for a couple of them people too, because once I told them how you
[01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:22.400]  had to have a state ID and a vote, they went and got a state ID and they voted.
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.180]  Let me be honest with you.
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:28.100]  The first thing that pops in some listeners minds and the first thing that pops in my
[01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:33.420]  wife's mind was, the Obama phone lady, don't be mean to her.
[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:36.220]  Obviously, I'm not here to get you here to be mean to you.
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:40.980]  In fact, contrary to that, I would like to try to see if I can communicate with you and
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:48.340]  actually show you the fact that Obama is just as bad as the Republicans, probably even worse,
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:52.220]  and that he does not have your best interest at heart and he's an incredible liar.
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:54.220]  But again, that's my view.
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:57.900]  Tell us why you like Obama.
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:00.100]  I liked Obama.
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:08.340]  I had seen him last year when and some things have went on by me being a minority and didn't
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:10.340]  know no better.
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:13.660]  I know he really didn't set the phones off.
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:21.460]  Once I spoke on that on YouTube, they showed me that it was passed, but when Obama got
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:26.140]  an election, it was Obama phones.
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:27.140]  That's how-
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:28.540]  Well, they radically increased the funding.
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:29.540]  Right.
[01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:33.100]  But he didn't put that bill out for us to get the Obama phone.
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:34.380]  That was Clinton, right?
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:35.380]  Yes.
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:36.380]  Okay.
[01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:38.740]  Did you know that my mother now calls her phone the Obama phone?
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:41.940]  Well, everybody in Cleveland calls them Obama phones.
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:44.100]  If you look on, and this is weird-
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:47.180]  No, we just call cell phones Obama phones now, period.
[01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:48.180]  Well, that's not-
[01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:52.180]  It's like people don't call search engines search engines, they call them Googles.
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:57.640]  Well, I never knew about it till I applied and I got one.
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:00.060]  So they are called Obama's phone.
[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:01.700]  He got the name for them, but he didn't-
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:04.020]  How many Obama phones do you have?
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:05.020]  One.
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:10.940]  But my sister has four or five of them, so that's what really pressed me to get them
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:13.420]  because I work, my sister don't work.
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:17.700]  She have no kids, she got four or five, she got three or four Obama phones and don't pay
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:18.700]  a bill.
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:22.140]  Here I am, I got Revo and I pay every month.
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:28.220]  Now expanding on that, do you see the danger of people getting to where they're dependent
[01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:29.220]  on the government?
[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:33.460]  Yes, I do, even myself, but I'm coming out of it.
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:34.780]  Well, you've got a job.
[01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:43.180]  Yes, I got a job, I started the day after Christmas, 26th of December.
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:50.580]  My issue is obviously government at some levels needs to be there as a safety net, but government,
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:54.100]  and I can actually after the show today show you some of their statements, about 100 years
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:58.760]  ago said, we need to take control of society, we're going to do it by making people dependent.
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:03.020]  And they didn't set up welfare and stuff to help people, they set it up to control people.
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:04.020]  Right, right.
[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:05.020]  And that's true.
[01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:08.820]  I've seen that with my own eyes in Cleveland, in Ohio.
[01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:13.660]  They set it up to control you and have some where they can feed back and get you right
[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:14.660]  in.
[01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:18.820]  I'm one of the ones, I got a child that I get child support for.
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:24.140]  And by me getting the child support, here it is, the child is 10 years old, the dad
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:28.420]  been working off and on, and we're not getting any money.
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:30.980]  And I'm asking the child support people, what you mean?
[01:41:30.980 --> 01:41:31.980]  Here he is working.
[01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:35.460]  We need to send the channel news people in there because here he is working and he keeps
[01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:38.460]  saying they're taking the money out, but we ain't getting none.
[01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:41.160]  And we haven't got any, he's 10 years old.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:45.740]  So here I am right now, where's Obama now?
[01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:51.940]  Like one thing, I'm glad he won the elections, but I want to see what he going to do.
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:56.880]  You told me that last night, what do you expect Obama to do?
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.820]  What could he do?
[01:41:58.820 --> 01:41:59.820]  What could he do?
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:00.820]  He could do a lot.
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:06.180]  He's staying with the plan on the 25th of January, but is he going to do it?
[01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:09.060]  And I know they keep saying it takes time, it takes time, it takes time.
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:14.900]  Only thing I've seen he did, they passed the election and people calling Obama phones,
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:18.220]  but for others in Ohio, I haven't seen him do too much.
[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:23.420]  He haven't even put up his office on Lee and Harvard, he's supposed to be rebuilding it
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:24.420]  and everything.
[01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:25.420]  You haven't did that yet.
[01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:27.660]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:30.340]  Have you noticed prices have gone up on most products?
[01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:31.340]  Hell yeah.
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:35.420]  Oh yeah, prices, gas, cigarettes.
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:37.700]  Do you know what the private fellow reserve is?
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:38.820]  No, I don't.
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:43.460]  Well, this country was taken over in 1913 by offshore European banks, and they've been
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:48.060]  devaluing the dollar ever since, but most of the devaluations happened in the last 15
[01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:49.620]  years or so.
[01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:55.420]  And Obama has got the printing presses turned up on high, but all that's doing is devaluing
[01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:56.420]  the dollar.
[01:42:56.420 --> 01:43:02.700]  So the president really can't do anything for the people long term.
[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:06.420]  Anything he does do will end up being turned towards bad.
[01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:09.180]  That's the problem with big government, that's why it doesn't work.
[01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:11.220]  I heard that too.
[01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:17.140]  Did you know that in communities, in the black community, that quote illegitimacy, that is
[01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:21.740]  the parents getting divorced or the dad never being there, was less than 10% back in the
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:23.420]  50s and now it's over 90%?
[01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:24.420]  Yeah.
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:28.020]  I mean, the state has taken over, but it's not just the black community, it's happening
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:29.020]  everywhere now.
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:30.020]  Right.
[01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:35.780]  I mean, it's like a plague, wherever government takes over, so I mean, what will more government
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:38.300]  money do?
[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:46.360]  Well, what I look at it is, well, what government money do is nothing, it's not doing anything.
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:52.220]  Here I am as a living sacrifice and they haven't did anything to me, feed us and get bigger
[01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:57.020]  and bigger with the food stamps, father's cash, they've been stopped the cash.
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:44:01.140]  So he's not really doing anything right now.
[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:04.900]  But how do we go from being able to feed the whole world 50 years ago to where we can't
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:06.980]  even produce our own food now?
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:10.820]  See, globalism is poverty.
[01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:16.220]  The policy is poverty, they want to make you poor so that they can control you.
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:20.180]  Do you know how horses got domesticated?
[01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:21.700]  Do you know how pigs got domesticated?
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:25.340]  Do you know how cows got domesticated?
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:27.380]  No, I don't.
[01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:31.140]  Well, it's the same way we're becoming domesticated.
[01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:34.740]  You simply set up an area and start putting food out for them, then they get used to eating
[01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:37.860]  it, then you put a fence up around it but leave a gate open, then they start going in,
[01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:40.060]  then you just go close the gate one day.
[01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:43.540]  Then you make them come to you when they're starving to get the food.
[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:47.380]  And pretty soon you're on a spit being basically roasted.
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:50.660]  That's being sent off to fight illegal wars.
[01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:57.820]  Here's an example, to get welfare, in a lot of states they try to force you to take vaccines.
[01:44:57.820 --> 01:44:59.940]  Do you know folks that are on welfare?
[01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:00.940]  Yes.
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:03.580]  Do they tell you that you've got to take vaccines?
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:04.580]  No.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:05.580]  They don't?
[01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:06.580]  No.
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:07.580]  Do you take vaccines?
[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:08.580]  No.
[01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:09.580]  You don't?
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:10.580]  No.
[01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:11.580]  Why?
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:12.580]  Vaccines?
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:13.580]  Yes.
[01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:14.580]  Fascination shots?
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:15.580]  Yeah.
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:16.580]  Because I had all my shots.
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:22.260]  What would you say if I told you that they put all sorts of deadly things in those shots?
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:24.900]  Well, that's now.
[01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:28.100]  I'm a little older, so I won't need no vaccination shots.
[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:30.620]  Well, they are starting to try to make adults take them.
[01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:32.700]  Do you know about the Tuskegee experiments?
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:35.660]  Where they put them in animals or something?
[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:39.140]  Hold on, I've got my phone going off here.
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:41.980]  Got my Obama phone going off right here.
[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:46.100]  Anyways, now we're having a serious interview here all of a sudden.
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:47.900]  You were pretty wound up last night, so was I.
[01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:49.860]  I am still wound up.
[01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:53.060]  Look, I've got so many questions here that I could ask.
[01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:55.220]  I know we've got so many callers on so many fronts.
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:58.700]  Let me just give you one example right here because I'm not here to beat you up because
[01:45:58.700 --> 01:45:59.860]  you're an Obama supporter.
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:07.060]  I mean, I get the argument of, well, the Republicans, they're torture, secret arrest, wars, lying,
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:10.940]  corporate welfare, banker bailouts.
[01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:13.380]  At least Obama says he wants to help me.
[01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:17.540]  My issue is, did you hear how they paid $22 billion to ship General Motors Cadillac and
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:19.340]  Volt plants to China?
[01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:23.780]  Now, I mean, it's one thing if they left the country.
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:26.380]  We paid to make them leave.
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:27.780]  And there's hundreds of things like that.
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:31.820]  Did you know Obama, Congress wouldn't pass a law that he's shutting down our coal power
[01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:36.580]  plants and power prices are going up everywhere?
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:38.140]  You know why that is?
[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:39.140]  No.
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:41.460]  People, I don't know.
[01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:42.920]  No, I don't.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:49.460]  My point is, Obama is a front man for some very dangerous criminal organizations.
[01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:50.900]  Have you heard of the New World Order?
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:53.380]  A little bit, I heard you talking.
[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:56.420]  Okay, these are people that want you dead.
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:59.980]  Have you heard about the tens of thousands of experiments killing US troops, killing
[01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:00.980]  foster children?
[01:47:00.980 --> 01:47:02.300]  Yeah, I heard about it.
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:05.620]  Yeah, I mean, they admit, they want you to know all day, we're the government, we kill
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:06.620]  you.
[01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:07.620]  Right.
[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:09.860]  Did you hear about the thousands of black people injected with syphilis?
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:10.860]  Yeah.
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:11.860]  That's Tuskegee.
[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:12.860]  Right.
[01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:16.700]  And the reason I raised that, not cuz you're black, but because people have heard of that.
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:17.700]  Right.
[01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:21.220]  That was a 50 year program, okay, and nobody got in trouble for that.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:22.220]  Right.
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:28.260]  Did you know the UN gave millions of kids in India vaccines last year and 60 plus thousand
[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:30.260]  of them got paralyzed?
[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:34.620]  I mean, those kids are never gonna run and play again, they're paralyzed, a lot of them
[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:35.620]  died.
[01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:37.420]  Now, did you know they put that in the back of the paper like it was like they were talking
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:41.340]  about the price of gasoline or something?
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:46.460]  Now, why would the government put US troops in chambers and nerve gas them to death?
[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:47.700]  Guys hadn't done anything.
[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:48.700]  Right.
[01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:49.700]  Black, white, kill you.
[01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:50.700]  Mm-hm.
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:51.700]  Why would we trust them?
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:54.980]  In a way, I really don't.
[01:47:54.980 --> 01:48:01.460]  As I'm a living sacrifice now here in America, and I did all this work for the help with
[01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:02.460]  Obama.
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:07.060]  You got paid a dollar sign nice and everything, but four years ago, he said what he was gonna
[01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:10.460]  do and he still ain't dead, why is it taking so long?
[01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:15.940]  He said the mothers that like me got kids, a 10 and a 15 year old, how should if I don't
[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:20.140]  have a job just getting food stamps, how could I live, how could I pay my rent?
[01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:24.620]  You know, and these are people that press for you to win.
[01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:28.980]  You know, and then I look at him like he'd be in a black president, at least he looked
[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:33.620]  out for the black minority who got you in this chair.
[01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:38.780]  You know, cuz even with me doing what I did, you know, by being a lot of big shot white
[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:44.780]  guys around, they didn't really want to see me go from canvassing on the streets to an
[01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:46.180]  office job.
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:52.080]  Do you know right before it was over, they gave me that job in office maybe a week or
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:56.660]  two at the last minute after I had already walked five or six miles?
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:58.740]  Well, see, here's the thing, you're a really nice lady.
[01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:05.760]  The way you described it to me, tell folks, I mean, tell us how they called you in after
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:08.300]  the Obama phone video went viral.
[01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:11.060]  I mean, describe that because you told me last night.
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:16.940]  Okay, well, when I got the job that I was doing walking in the field service, they called
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:20.980]  me in the office and they was like, do you know how you showed your ass?
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:26.060]  You know how I really talked to the cameraman and I said what I said.
[01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:29.020]  And I said, I said the first thing came to my heart.
[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:31.720]  And he was like, do you know that Obama didn't get the phone?
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.620]  It don't matter.
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:39.780]  You are walking around, even you, the job that I got, the phone you gave me say Obama.
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:44.740]  So if this is all what we see and know, this is what people think of that.
[01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:46.220]  And then you told me they put you in the office.
[01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:47.820]  They gave me an office job.
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:49.200]  So that you wouldn't be on the street.
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:50.200]  That I wouldn't be on the street.
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:52.100]  And then what did they tell you about that?
[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:55.980]  Well, when I got in the office job, they told me they didn't want me on the street because
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:59.060]  I had so many voters for Obama.
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:03.520]  You know, I was really going out there talking and knew because at the end of the day, turning
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:07.680]  your paperwork, I got over 75 to 100 people.
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:11.100]  But do you really believe you did such a good job, we pulled you off it?
[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:12.100]  Right.
[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:13.100]  But I don't believe that.
[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:16.340]  I believe they pulled me off because he was full of stuff too.
[01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:20.740]  Well, but see, the difference is here with me, Michelle, is I'm talking to you straight.
[01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:21.740]  Right.
[01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:24.820]  See, I don't see you as a human resource to be used.
[01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:25.820]  Right.
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:29.940]  I see you as a real person who has incredible potential.
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:30.940]  Right.
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:35.300]  And I want you to know that I have Margaret Sanger and all the documents where they said
[01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:38.800]  about 100 years ago, they said, we're going to go in and take over the black community.
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:43.300]  We're going to hire their leaders and we're going to get abortion legalized so we can
[01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:44.540]  kill these people.
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:49.620]  The Democratic Party exists to put you six feet under.
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:53.580]  The Republicans are a bunch of gangsters too, but the Democrats, a modern Democratic Party
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:55.860]  is designed to kill black people.
[01:50:55.860 --> 01:50:56.860]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:56.860 --> 01:50:57.860]  Okay.
[01:50:57.860 --> 01:50:58.860]  All right.
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:10.660]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin
[01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:16.780]  with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine and laundry service awaits.
[01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:19.660]  After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.
[01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:24.580]  You're on a golden stag safari for big game.
[01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:25.900]  But it's not Africa.
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:26.900]  It's Argentina.
[01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:33.740]  One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, huger, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:41.380]  stag deer in South America, all gold medal quality, all the action you can handle.
[01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:46.740]  Land rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food, beverages, hunting guides, ground
[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:52.260]  transportation included, and more, all more affordable than you can imagine.
[01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:57.380]  The adventure of a lifetime starts at goldenstagsafaris.com.
[01:51:57.380 --> 01:52:01.380]  The big game hunting ranch, goldenstagsafaris.com.
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:11.540]  Balance, harmony, mental alertness, physical wellbeing.
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:16.940]  If once you possess these qualities, but stress now weighs you down, you can get your mental
[01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:22.660]  edge back in a holistic approach with Nutropic Mind Power from mindregard.com.

[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:03.940]  My name is Stephen Heuer.
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:07.740]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that most brain malfunctions
[01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:11.160]  have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage.
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:15.020]  So whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:19.540]  matters like inability to focus, speak normally, or remember things, the emphasis to getting
[01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:23.220]  one's brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification.
[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:27.620]  One World Way supports your body's number one means of detoxification, which is glutathione
[01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:28.620]  production.
[01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:33.020]  My name is Angie, and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation.
[01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:37.380]  I got him on One World Way, and in two months, his constipation is gone.
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:41.540]  He's become friendlier, he can carry on a normal conversation with me, and he has made
[01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:42.540]  his first friend.
[01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:46.540]  He's doing great, and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day.
[01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:51.540]  You could offer him a present or a cake, and he would prefer the One World Way.
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:54:16.420]  Go to OneWorldWay.com, that's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com, or call 888-988-3325, that's 888-988-3325.
[01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:21.700]  She was their old Obama phone lady self.
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:24.820]  Michelle Dowry is here with us in the studio, a whole other hour coming up, and we will
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:29.340]  also open the phones up as well.
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:38.220]  But continuing here, I sent the guys over to McDonald's to get a Happy Meal, because,
[01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:41.380]  and I don't do this to be condescending, I do this to get it all out in the open.
[01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:43.300]  Wow, that's where I've never seen a Happy Meal where it's torn open.
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:47.180]  My son must have been in this, seeing it's designed to get kids to go after it.
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:49.860]  But it's the same thing with adults.
[01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:57.220]  A free phone, it's like Indians selling Manhattan for a box full of glass beads that didn't
[01:54:57.220 --> 01:55:02.520]  even cost half a pound, or British sterling.
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:04.620]  It's selling your birthright for baubles.
[01:55:04.620 --> 01:55:08.500]  The government shouldn't be the place we're getting phones from.
[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:11.380]  The government, guys, I don't think that door is completely shut.
[01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:17.340]  Can we shut that door completely, thank you.
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:20.700]  This is the type of issue that we're dealing with here.
[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:25.760]  And it is an artificial system.
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:33.140]  Not only is this meant to lure kids in, bunch of GMO crud with Monsanto on the board of
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:35.040]  this organization.
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:38.700]  And it's a Happy Meal, but really what it is, is a spider's web.
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:45.940]  So here's my issue, that's the same thing with the Obama phone, it's like a Happy Meal.
[01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:49.620]  In fact, you've got the Obama phone right there, don't you?
[01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:50.620]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:53.820]  It's like Excalibur, hold it up for the camera, people can see that.
[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:57.340]  There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:57.340 --> 01:56:02.440]  And again, just to be clear about this, the Republicans out there, half of them work for
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:05.540]  defense contractors, they're getting government money too.
[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:09.060]  I'm not here judging you because you want an Obama phone.
[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:10.500]  What about all the corporate welfare?
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:12.520]  What about the trillions in banker bailouts?
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:17.300]  Did you know for every dollar that went to banker bailouts, they had like $1 in welfare?
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:23.480]  Again, if we are gonna have a socialist system, the people are sure selling out cheap.
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:26.380]  Why didn't you like Romney?
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:28.340]  Romney was gonna take the food stamps.
[01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:34.860]  He was gonna take the stamps, he was gonna make us work for the food stamps.
[01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:35.860]  What else he said he was gonna do?
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:39.580]  He was gonna cut our hours back.
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:47.920]  In Ohio, they got the cameras, he was up on the camera with the speeding and Romney was
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:49.180]  really on it.
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:53.320]  I mean, Obama is continuing and expanding NSA spying.
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:57.620]  Obama has signed a law where they can secretly disappear American citizens and even kill
[01:56:57.620 --> 01:56:59.900]  us called the NDAA.
[01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:01.820]  He's got drone attacks going on all over the world.
[01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:04.300]  Again, I'm not saying Romney's good either.
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:08.260]  My point is they're all really bad and Obama isn't your friend.
[01:57:08.260 --> 01:57:13.860]  What do you think of Obama continuing torture?
[01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:16.020]  What do I think he's continuing to torture?
[01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:18.020]  Is that what you said?
[01:57:18.020 --> 01:57:21.620]  Yes, I mean, are you aware of his foreign policy?
[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:24.540]  A little bit.
[01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:30.300]  My point is that, I mean, do you think torture is okay?
[01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:32.420]  No.
[01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:34.420]  What about drone attacks?
[01:57:34.420 --> 01:57:35.420]  No.
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:36.420]  Where they're just bombing.
[01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:38.860]  And by the way, the countries where they're bombing, it's illegal.
[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:40.540]  There's no declaration of war.
[01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:43.800]  They're just flying around killing wherever they want.
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:47.780]  Do you think Obama really cried on TV for the dead kids at Sandy Hook?
[01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:48.780]  No.
[01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:51.260]  Do you think it was fake?
[01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:56.080]  A little bit, I mean, he got to play his part.
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:57.080]  He's the president.
[01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:02.540]  I mean, if he goes out and cry to every little situation, hell, he wouldn't have no tears
[01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:03.540]  left.
[01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:06.300]  He got to play his part too.
[01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:09.060]  The whole world is a stage, each of his players upon it?
[01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:10.060]  No.
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:12.380]  I'm not going to agree on that one.
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:15.060]  But you're saying, here's the deal, I don't play my part.
[01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:18.340]  I mean, if I cry, I really am crying.
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:21.860]  My point is they'll kill hundreds of innocent people at a wedding to get one bad guy they
[01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:23.860]  claim.
[01:58:23.860 --> 01:58:25.940]  And Obama doesn't cry for all those little kids.
[01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:29.380]  Have you seen the video of little kids in Libya and Syria with their lower jaws blown
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:31.580]  off and stuff, screaming for mommy?
[01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:32.580]  Right.
[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:34.060]  Why is Obama crying for them?
[01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:37.420]  Well, he probably felt sad and moved on.
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:39.020]  But I think he could have did more.
[01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:40.420]  Well, he is doing more.
[01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:41.420]  He's bombing more countries.
[01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:42.420]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:58.620]  Don't be one of them.

[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:04.860]  solution.
[01:59:04.860 --> 01:59:08.460]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be

[01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:14.500]  healing.

[01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:23.740]  the causes of many serious diseases such as stress, strep, pneumonia, coals, flus and
[01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:25.340]  other harmful pathogens.

[01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:34.340]  hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

[01:59:56.140 --> 02:00:07.900]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:12.780]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:13.780]  You want answers?
[02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:15.900]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:20.100]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:23.860]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:28.620]  I thought it would be fun to get the Obama phone lady in studio.
[02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:35.180]  No one knew who she was, there was that one video, then she disappeared off the radar
[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:36.180]  screen.
[02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:38.980]  Well, she's now down here with us in Austin, Texas.
[02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:40.380]  We had a great time last night.
[02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:43.620]  I don't want to say you're nervous, but you're real serious now.
[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:45.900]  During the breaks, you've been having a little bit more fun.
[02:00:45.900 --> 02:00:46.900]  I want to go to some phone calls.
[02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:52.300]  I want to go to a bunch of Twitter questions, a big stack of them that have also come in
[02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:53.300]  here.
[02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:57.180]  And I've got a bunch of other points I want to go over with you here today.
[02:00:57.180 --> 02:01:04.940]  But you were talking about the hope that Obama will do things that will make your life, other
[02:01:04.940 --> 02:01:05.940]  people's lives, better.
[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:08.420]  There's certainly nothing wrong with wanting a better life.
[02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:10.180]  What do you think Obama can do?
[02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:12.540]  He can do anything he want to do.
[02:01:12.540 --> 02:01:13.540]  He's the president.
[02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:17.020]  It might take a little time, but he can do anything.
[02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:23.180]  The president, he wanted to build me a house from the ground, he could do that.
[02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:24.340]  He's the president.
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:27.180]  But he would have to take it from somebody else to do it.
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:28.180]  Right?
[02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:29.180]  That's like anybody else.
[02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:32.480]  And then he would have to choose who got to build it, and of course, that'll be his friends.
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:36.900]  But that's okay, he's the president, he got that pool to do whatever he can do to go that
[02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:37.900]  Obama file.
[02:01:37.900 --> 02:01:39.900]  Go ahead and take it.
[02:01:39.900 --> 02:01:43.060]  All right there, hello?
[02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:45.100]  I'm on the air, I can't talk to you guys.
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:47.900]  My minutes are up my Obama phone.
[02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:55.620]  Continue, so but don't you get that kings and presidents and others would say just do
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:57.460]  it before, and it's called tyranny.
[02:01:57.460 --> 02:02:01.240]  I mean, there's got to be rules that the president just can't do whatever he wants.
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:02.240]  That's true.
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:08.060]  He's the president, can't do everything he wants to do, but you know.
[02:02:08.060 --> 02:02:09.060]  Did you see all the people?
[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:10.060]  Well, we'll talk about it later.
[02:02:10.060 --> 02:02:11.560]  Let's take some phone calls right now.
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:18.340]  Ryan in Texas, you were on the phone with the real live Obama phone lady, go ahead.
[02:02:18.340 --> 02:02:26.980]  I was wanting to really know what deep down made you support Obama.
[02:02:26.980 --> 02:02:28.740]  Deep down, why does she support Obama?
[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:33.700]  Yes, like the core reason why that makes her support Obama.
[02:02:33.700 --> 02:02:36.820]  I mean, is it reflected, Glory?
[02:02:36.820 --> 02:02:40.580]  Is it that you feel like you're part of something?
[02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:43.500]  No, I didn't feel like I was part of anything.
[02:02:43.500 --> 02:02:45.580]  I had a job to do.
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:51.780]  Now I got a job, I'm making a little money, and when I did the campaign for Obama, I made
[02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:52.780]  the big money.
[02:02:52.780 --> 02:02:59.820]  But as I was out there campaigning to get voters to vote for Obama, one thing I pressed
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:02.180]  was what kind of phone you got?
[02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:05.040]  And it was like Obama phone, how you get it?
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:06.800]  They didn't know like I didn't know.
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:12.060]  So that was wrong led me to get them out there for the vote.
[02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:15.220]  But if you really look at it, if you got a quarter, you ain't saying where the quarter
[02:03:15.220 --> 02:03:17.380]  come from, it's just a quarter.
[02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:18.860]  Just like the phones, they were free.
[02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:23.900]  No, I understand, it's Pavlovian, I mean, the government is giving you something, therefore
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:25.460]  it must be good.
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:30.260]  But take your job you've got now, did you know the payroll taxes just went way up?
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:31.660]  The amount of money they're taking out of your check?
[02:03:31.660 --> 02:03:33.540]  Remember Obama said he wouldn't raise your taxes.
[02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:37.700]  No, I didn't, I haven't got a check yet.
[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:40.860]  Well listen, we're gonna have to try to work this out cuz I'd like you to do some auxiliary
[02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:41.860]  reporting for us.
[02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:47.920]  But I first have to get you to the point where you understand, I mean, everybody's heard
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:50.180]  about government doing medical experiments on people.
[02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:52.620]  Caller, did you have anything else you wanted to add?
[02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:57.980]  Yeah, I was also wanting to know her views on the gun control bill they're trying to
[02:03:57.980 --> 02:03:58.980]  pass.
[02:03:58.980 --> 02:04:03.180]  I'm gonna ask her that when we come back from break because that's a big one and I wanna
[02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:05.580]  I want everybody to be able to respond to that.
[02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:08.620]  When we come back from break, we'll get into the gun situation, I asked her about that
[02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:09.620]  last night.
[02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:11.360]  And we'll get to some of these Twitter questions as well.
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:12.360]  Thank you for the call, Ryan.
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:17.140]  We're gonna go to Jerry and others also on the other side of this quick break and she's
[02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:18.140]  with us.
[02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:24.260]  Michelle Dowry is in studio with us and she is the Obama phone lady.
[02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:28.700]  And if you wanna see the quintessential Obama voter, I think she represents it.
[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:32.740]  She's a nice lady and I understand that this country's in a depression.
[02:04:32.740 --> 02:04:38.820]  When you get to a point where the government is there providing for you, you start having
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:39.820]  allegiance for it.
[02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:43.780]  So pretty soon the government takes from one group, gives to another, they've got them
[02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:46.940]  in a subsistence level, there's no real economy left.
[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:50.140]  Everybody's on the government plantation and game over, the globalists win.
[02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:54.420]  We'll come right back with the one, the only, the Obama phone lady is very, very somber
[02:04:54.420 --> 02:04:55.420]  in here.
[02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:57.100]  And we've got a lot of video of her behind the scenes.
[02:04:57.100 --> 02:04:59.100]  She's a crackerjack.
[02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:07.180]  Sick of the globalist, eugenicist, control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing
[02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:08.900]  as you get sick and die?
[02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:11.100]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.

[02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:37.380]  require electricity, purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:05:37.380 --> 02:05:40.540]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:44.820]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:47.580]  ProPure is the best gravity fed filter out there.
[02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:49.580]  It's what my family uses.

[02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:29.700]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority got Obama phoned, keep Obama in president,
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:30.700]  you know?
[02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:31.700]  He gave us a phone.
[02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:32.700]  He gave you a phone.
[02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:33.700]  He's going to do more.
[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:34.700]  How did he give you a phone?
[02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:39.620]  You sign up and you're on full stamps, you're on social security, you got low income, you
[02:08:39.620 --> 02:08:40.620]  got disability.
[02:08:40.620 --> 02:08:43.180]  Okay, what's wrong with Romney again?
[02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:44.180]  Let's talk about it.
[02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:49.500]  Okay, we're here with the real live Obama phone lady and now her name is revealed.
[02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:50.500]  She's that mystery person.
[02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:52.460]  I'm like, I want that lady on.
[02:08:52.460 --> 02:08:53.460]  What's her name?
[02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:55.740]  Let's find her and our listeners found her.
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:08:57.660]  Now she's since been called by The View.
[02:08:57.660 --> 02:09:01.700]  She's reportedly going to go on that soon and a bunch of other stations, but she's here
[02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:06.300]  first with us and she's a little subdued today.
[02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:09.700]  I think we had a few too many beers last night, I'm joking.
[02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:10.700]  I'm joking.
[02:09:10.700 --> 02:09:11.700]  We didn't know actually we did.
[02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:15.500]  Anyways, but she's going to be on the nightly news with us tonight as well.
[02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:17.140]  And I want to go back to your calls.
[02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:18.780]  I want to go over a whole bunch of issues.
[02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:22.580]  I want to take your Twitter questions here today.
[02:09:22.580 --> 02:09:25.940]  But you heard the last caller, but we were going to break.
[02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:32.680]  Where do you stand on the right to keep and bear arms?
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:36.160]  You're not on a Perry Mason up on the courtroom.
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:39.260]  We just want to know where you come from.
[02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:40.260]  Where do you stand on the Second Amendment?
[02:09:40.260 --> 02:09:43.260]  Where do you stand on the right to own guns?
[02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:45.300]  I'm against that.
[02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:46.480]  There you go.
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:51.680]  So you want the government to have guns, but not the people?
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:53.400]  No guns at all.
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:55.300]  Have faith in God.
[02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:58.420]  Well, God has faith in those that have faith in themselves.
[02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:05.860]  See, I mean- I'm not into the guns, you know, and to me it's a lot of nonsense with that.
[02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:08.300]  I'm not into guns with the government having them.
[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:09.300]  No.
[02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:14.460]  I mean, the government has bought 1.6 billion bullets, armored vehicles, helicopters, SWAT
[02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:15.460]  teams.
[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:19.980]  A SWAT team busted in and shot an innocent guy 16 times.
[02:10:19.980 --> 02:10:24.620]  And they said it was justified because he was reaching to turn the light on.
[02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:26.780]  And they lied and said he had four guns, which he didn't.
[02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:30.740]  Even though they got caught lying, because it's about officer safety.
[02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:31.740]  So I got an idea.
[02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:35.460]  How about everyone on Earth but police commits suicide?
[02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:40.820]  Six billion, 300 million people commit suicide, but the 15 million police are so worldwide
[02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:42.440]  for their safety.
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:45.540]  Because if they say, if they think it's their safety, they kill you?
[02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:48.460]  How about everyone on Earth commits suicide so they're safe?
[02:10:48.460 --> 02:10:51.060]  That's what the New World Order wants.
[02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:55.620]  They want to have world government to set up a medical tyranny to force cancer virus
[02:10:55.620 --> 02:10:59.540]  injections into us via vaccines, and GMO they force fetus.
[02:10:59.540 --> 02:11:02.640]  And these globalists think we're so dumb, Michelle, they've written books how they're
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:05.380]  doing it to us.
[02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:07.700]  Do you know about, I mean, you know about Tuskegee?
[02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:12.620]  Why do you trust a government that you know nerve gas for our own troops, that you know?
[02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:17.900]  Did you hear about in New York City, how they were giving little kids, mainly black kids?
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:21.020]  Cuz the government loves black kids so much, wants to give you free stuff.
[02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:22.100]  No, they're not your friends.
[02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:25.220]  I'm trying to really reach out to you here, and I understand they've shut the economy
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:26.220]  down.
[02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:28.860]  I understand things are desperate, I get all that.
[02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:30.620]  I understand that.
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:35.060]  And what I'm saying is, the New York Daily News six years ago reported they were testing
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:38.340]  pesticides on little kids till they killed them.
[02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:42.740]  Now, see, I happen to care about those kids no matter what color they are.
[02:11:42.740 --> 02:11:46.900]  They happen to be mainly black, because for some reason in the liberal intelligentsia
[02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:47.900]  it's okay.
[02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:52.780]  But some of the CPS workers blew the whistle and said, you know, these kids are dying.
[02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:54.280]  Is this okay?
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:55.280]  Should we be killing them?
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:56.280]  Cuz we're the government.
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:12:00.140]  I mean, is it okay for the government to chain little black kids down and feed pesticides
[02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:02.140]  to them?
[02:12:02.140 --> 02:12:03.140]  Bug poison.
[02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:06.820]  Now, I mean, I can show you all these articles.
[02:12:06.820 --> 02:12:10.020]  Now, does that sound like a nice group of people there?
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:11.020]  No.
[02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:17.420]  Okay, you told me, you and Harvey told me why you want the guns taken last night, and
[02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:18.420]  I understand it.
[02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:21.820]  Why don't you repeat what you said?
[02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:28.960]  Well, I don't want the guns for the president to get them.
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:33.820]  The people out here, you could buy guns on the street, you could buy them from police
[02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:34.820]  officers.
[02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:39.180]  Yeah, I know, that's where you got to get drugs and everything, the police, yeah.
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:40.660]  Right, right, right.
[02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:45.180]  And just by me being on your talk show and thinking about it, them are the biggest cruel
[02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:48.100]  people there is, you know?
[02:12:48.100 --> 02:12:54.240]  Just by you saying about the guns, the president got all these guns and protected, but what
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:56.380]  about the people that help you protect us?
[02:12:56.380 --> 02:12:57.900]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[02:12:57.900 --> 02:13:02.620]  I've talked to people at MTV, multiple people, who said in the mid 90s, they said, we're
[02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:06.060]  gonna promote this gangster rap to take over the culture.
[02:13:06.060 --> 02:13:08.660]  That's a time bomb, and the rappers are killing each other.
[02:13:08.660 --> 02:13:12.220]  They'll have $50 million in the bank, but to be a man, they'll shoot somebody.
[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:16.580]  I get, cuz that's what Harvey, your husband, was saying, he goes, look, I've had nephews
[02:13:16.580 --> 02:13:17.580]  killed.
[02:13:17.580 --> 02:13:20.080]  I get that that's terrible and horrible.
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:23.500]  And there's a lot of rappers like KRS1, who's one of my listeners, and others, and Professor
[02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:26.220]  Griff, who are saying that's wrong.
[02:13:26.220 --> 02:13:29.440]  And you know what, it is a program for blacks to kill each other.
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:35.680]  So I'm against that inner city violence, believe me, but that isn't a reason for everybody
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:38.060]  else to lose their guns.
[02:13:38.060 --> 02:13:40.500]  Take Chicago, you know they have the highest crime rate in the world?
[02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:41.980]  We're on the radio in Chicago.
[02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:43.920]  That's not for them, you're right.
[02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:46.220]  But they've taken the guns there.
[02:13:46.220 --> 02:13:49.860]  Only law abiding citizens then gave their guns up.
[02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:53.980]  So see, if I could walk through with Obama supporters, and it doesn't mean you go vote
[02:13:53.980 --> 02:13:54.980]  for Romney.
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:56.220]  They all were in so much trouble.
[02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:58.860]  Did you know the very same interest fund, both men?
[02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:01.480]  Yeah, I knew that.
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:05.460]  But then Obama, he is charming, he's like, hey, I'm gonna take care of you.
[02:14:05.460 --> 02:14:08.900]  You know what I'm gonna, did you see in the first campaign people going, thank you, Mr.
[02:14:08.900 --> 02:14:09.900]  President.
[02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:10.900]  I'm gonna get a free house.
[02:14:10.900 --> 02:14:11.900]  I'm gonna get a free car.
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:12.900]  Right.
[02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:13.900]  Right.
[02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:14.900]  And those people did not get free houses and free cars.
[02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:16.820]  He didn't do nothing for Lee and Harvard.
[02:14:16.820 --> 02:14:21.060]  He promised them people he was gonna get a big office if he win this time.
[02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:26.980]  You heard him on the news say how he come back to Cleveland and Detroit and get us low
[02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:28.940]  black minorities to vote.
[02:14:28.940 --> 02:14:34.300]  But look how we living, Lee and Harvard and Cleveland, Ohio still where his office at
[02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:35.300]  is still the same.
[02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:40.460]  Well, I mean, and again, Obama said, I will not sign the NDAA, don't worry about beating
[02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:41.660]  it.
[02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:44.700]  Because there was opposition, it was gonna get beaten, but he said, but I'm gonna veto
[02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:45.700]  it.
[02:14:45.700 --> 02:14:46.700]  So people said, well, just let it pass.
[02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:47.700]  Right.
[02:14:47.700 --> 02:14:48.700]  Then he signed it.
[02:14:48.700 --> 02:14:49.700]  Right.
[02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:50.700]  So he went against our word and signed it anyway.
[02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:52.660]  But the point is, it turned out he wrote it.
[02:14:52.660 --> 02:14:53.660]  Right.
[02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:57.460]  I mean, this guy makes, it's devilish lying.
[02:14:57.460 --> 02:15:00.300]  Okay, and Romney's a devilish liar too.
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:04.900]  The point is, is that it's how far gone we are, Michelle, is why things are getting worse
[02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:05.900]  and worse.
[02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:07.340]  Let me play you a clip here.
[02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:11.060]  This is Obama saying your payroll tax, nothing's going up.
[02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:14.660]  But you know, more than 14 taxes are going up.
[02:15:14.660 --> 02:15:17.380]  And there's a 3.8% tax on investments.
[02:15:17.380 --> 02:15:19.260]  There's another tax on payroll.
[02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:25.140]  There's taxes across the board that have gone up on almost every American, every American
[02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:26.140]  that works.
[02:15:26.140 --> 02:15:30.900]  77% of Americans got a tax increase, you can just type that into a search engine.
[02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:35.740]  Now when you get your next paycheck, I guess when you get back, I want you to notice in
[02:15:35.740 --> 02:15:38.500]  there all the little things that are taken out, okay?
[02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:39.500]  Now are you rich?
[02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:40.500]  Heck no.
[02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:43.980]  Did you know that Kennedy cut taxes by 50%?
[02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:46.780]  Do you know what happened a year later?
[02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:48.660]  Gave it back?
[02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:49.660]  Tax receipts doubled.
[02:15:49.660 --> 02:15:54.300]  Did you know the government knows if they cut taxes, there's a boom and that more money
[02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:55.940]  comes in?
[02:15:55.940 --> 02:16:00.860]  Michelle, why would they want to raise taxes?
[02:16:00.860 --> 02:16:06.540]  Why would they want to chain kids down and dump pesticide down their throat?
[02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:12.060]  See, did you see that news article about the top BBC presenter being a Satanist with kids?
[02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:14.060]  Why would he want to do that to little kids?
[02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:16.700]  He's a Satanist, that's why.
[02:16:16.700 --> 02:16:20.620]  And see, the devil comes as an angel of light.
[02:16:20.620 --> 02:16:23.220]  It's true, that's in the Bible.
[02:16:23.220 --> 02:16:26.460]  And will speak scripture, okay?
[02:16:26.460 --> 02:16:30.420]  This government is the most evil government the world's ever seen.
[02:16:30.420 --> 02:16:35.460]  Our government funded Hitler and then destroyed him.
[02:16:35.460 --> 02:16:38.600]  Our government created Lenin and Stalin.
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:39.600]  Did you know that's declassified?
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:43.300]  Do you know our government put Mao Tse Tung in?
[02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:44.660]  Declassified.
[02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:49.460]  Mao Tse Tung conservatively killed 66 million people.
[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:51.180]  The Chinese government says 80 plus million.
[02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:53.660]  Do you know how many people that is?
[02:16:53.660 --> 02:16:55.900]  A sports stadium is 100,000.
[02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:59.220]  That's almost, moreover, 140, you got.
[02:16:59.220 --> 02:17:00.820]  Yeah, 100,000 people.
[02:17:00.820 --> 02:17:04.220]  How many sports stadiums is 80 million people?
[02:17:04.220 --> 02:17:06.900]  Two, three.
[02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:08.460]  Starved to death, lined up and shot.
[02:17:08.460 --> 02:17:14.420]  Do you know our government shipped in shiploads of bullets so he could just mow them down?
[02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:17.420]  It's not our government.
[02:17:17.420 --> 02:17:23.500]  They're called eugenicists, eugenicists, they're scientific dictators.
[02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:26.700]  Obama is reading off a teleprompter.
[02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:30.660]  And we've got to realize that the entire system is evil.
[02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:31.900]  And I don't wanna sit here and preach at you.
[02:17:31.900 --> 02:17:33.200]  Let's play this first clip.
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:39.100]  This is Obama four years ago saying, I will never raise your taxes, not $1, here it is.
[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:48.740]  And I can make a firm pledge under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year
[02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:55.060]  will see any form of tax increase, not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your
[02:17:55.060 --> 02:17:59.580]  capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.
[02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:00.580]  That's a firm pledge.
[02:18:00.580 --> 02:18:04.620]  Now, guys, just cuz he's here, I know I've only got two guys who are in the job, eight
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:05.620]  people.
[02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:10.060]  Five pins, 77% of Americans got payroll tax increase.
[02:18:10.060 --> 02:18:16.100]  People making $30,000 or up, now is 30,000, 250,000?
[02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:17.100]  Is that a lie right there?
[02:18:17.100 --> 02:18:18.100]  That's a lie.
[02:18:18.100 --> 02:18:22.540]  George Herbert Walker Bush got thrown out of office for reading my lips, no new taxes.
[02:18:22.540 --> 02:18:25.140]  People tell me now, well, they just lie, it's what they do.
[02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:28.020]  Well, I know they're liars, so I'm not gonna turn my guns in.
[02:18:28.020 --> 02:18:30.140]  Let's go to the next clip here for you.
[02:18:30.140 --> 02:18:31.140]  Let's play this clip.
[02:18:31.140 --> 02:18:34.260]  This is him four years ago saying, I'm not coming after your handgun or your rifle or
[02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:35.540]  your shotgun.
[02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:36.540]  Here's that clip.
[02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:40.900]  When y'all go home and you're talking to your buddies and they say, he wants to take my
[02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:41.900]  gun away.
[02:18:41.900 --> 02:18:47.420]  You've heard it here, I'm on television, so everybody knows it.
[02:18:47.420 --> 02:18:50.140]  I believe in the Second Amendment.
[02:18:50.140 --> 02:18:54.220]  I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms.
[02:18:54.220 --> 02:18:56.520]  I will not take your shotgun away.
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:18:59.980]  I will not take your rifle away.
[02:18:59.980 --> 02:19:02.860]  I won't take your handgun away.
[02:19:02.860 --> 02:19:06.100]  Now, what does the devil do?
[02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:07.100]  What does the devil do?
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:08.100]  The devil lies.
[02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:09.100]  Lies, cheats.
[02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:11.300]  What's the devil's number one name in the Bible?
[02:19:11.300 --> 02:19:12.700]  The deceiver.
[02:19:12.700 --> 02:19:13.700]  The deceiver.
[02:19:13.700 --> 02:19:14.700]  The deceiver.
[02:19:14.700 --> 02:19:15.700]  The deceiver.
[02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:16.700]  The deceiver.
[02:19:16.700 --> 02:19:17.700]  The enemy.
[02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:20.060]  The enemy.
[02:19:20.060 --> 02:19:22.420]  I know a deceiver and an enemy when I see one.
[02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:25.420]  Now, if he just pledged to me, he wouldn't come after my guns.
[02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:31.220]  Now they got bills he supports that will make me hand in all my semi-autos, my handguns.
[02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:34.660]  Yep, he lied.
[02:19:34.660 --> 02:19:37.180]  And here's what's even worse, Michelle.
[02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:40.860]  They've all written papers in our public saying they want all our guns taken.
[02:19:40.860 --> 02:19:44.420]  And then Piers Morgan sits there and says, nobody wants your guns.
[02:19:44.420 --> 02:19:45.420]  That makes me mad.
[02:19:45.420 --> 02:19:46.940]  He's lying to my face.
[02:19:46.940 --> 02:19:47.940]  Right.
[02:19:47.940 --> 02:19:48.940]  Okay.
[02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:53.980]  Michelle, I'm going to give you some films covering eugenics and what they're really
[02:19:53.980 --> 02:19:55.540]  doing, and then we're going to have you back on.
[02:19:55.540 --> 02:19:58.660]  But when we come back, we're going to take more calls, get to more questions and more
[02:19:58.660 --> 02:19:59.660]  lies.
[02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:01.660]  For the Obama Phone Lady, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:01.660 --> 02:20:02.660]  All right.
[02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:04.660]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:04.660 --> 02:20:11.180]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we
[02:20:11.180 --> 02:20:16.180]  are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.
[02:20:16.180 --> 02:20:20.100]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[02:20:20.100 --> 02:20:22.780]  But we can't do that without your help.
[02:20:22.780 --> 02:20:28.060]  By getting the films, bumper stickers and T-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up
[02:20:28.060 --> 02:20:34.100]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:20:34.100 --> 02:20:37.560]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:43.780]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:20:43.780 --> 02:20:51.220]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[02:20:51.220 --> 02:20:52.780]  and ultimate extermination.
[02:20:52.780 --> 02:20:55.140]  The war is here.
[02:20:55.140 --> 02:20:56.980]  It's an info war.
[02:20:56.980 --> 02:21:03.700]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:21:03.700 --> 02:21:04.980]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[02:21:04.980 --> 02:21:09.540]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts
[02:21:09.540 --> 02:21:11.220]  and more into the Bokashi.
[02:21:11.220 --> 02:21:14.800]  If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or
[02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:16.540]  the smell, then check out the E.M.
[02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:19.140]  Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Tereganics.
[02:21:19.140 --> 02:21:23.700]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop
[02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:25.080]  using fertilizers.
[02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:27.500]  The E.M. Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.
[02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:31.820]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste so it
[02:21:31.820 --> 02:21:36.300]  takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens with no turning and no
[02:21:36.300 --> 02:21:37.640]  obnoxious odors.
[02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:42.180]  To learn more and order your Bokashi online, visit tereganics.com and click on the orange
[02:21:42.180 --> 02:21:43.180]  button.
[02:21:43.180 --> 02:21:51.620]  That's tereganics.com, spelled T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X dot com or call 866-369-3678.
[02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:55.140]  That's 866-369-3678.
[02:21:55.140 --> 02:21:58.780]  Recycle all your food waste in about six weeks with the Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System
[02:21:58.780 --> 02:21:59.780]  from tereganics.com.
[02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:00.780]  Tereganics.
[02:22:00.780 --> 02:22:02.960]  Life's getting better.
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:07.140]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:09.660]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:14.700]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many
[02:22:14.700 --> 02:22:17.740]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:17.740 --> 02:22:21.620]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:25.980]  Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:29.740]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[02:22:29.740 --> 02:22:31.260]  from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:35.140]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[02:22:35.140 --> 02:22:40.140]  power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:40.140 --> 02:22:41.540]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:41.540 --> 02:22:46.300]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:46.300 --> 02:22:51.100]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:51.100 --> 02:22:54.220]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:54.220 --> 02:22:58.980]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:58.980 --> 02:23:00.980]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.980 --> 02:23:03.060]  Hi there.
[02:23:03.060 --> 02:23:04.060]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:23:04.060 --> 02:23:08.300]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:23:08.300 --> 02:23:14.580]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity
[02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:19.180]  monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent, lying crooks
[02:23:19.180 --> 02:23:24.420]  that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:23:24.420 --> 02:23:29.460]  Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a coverup and you will be shocked
[02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:32.340]  to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:23:32.340 --> 02:23:37.980]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[02:23:37.980 --> 02:23:40.300]  and how you can beat them too.
[02:23:40.300 --> 02:23:44.160]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen
[02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:45.740]  in the last three months.
[02:23:45.740 --> 02:23:51.260]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect
[02:23:51.260 --> 02:23:52.260]  your home.
[02:23:52.260 --> 02:23:58.060]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:23:58.060 --> 02:24:17.340]  But again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:18.340]  She's here.
[02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:19.340]  She's the Obama lady.
[02:24:19.340 --> 02:24:22.580]  I promise we're going to your calls here in just a moment and a bunch of your tweet questions.
[02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:27.180]  But look, we're getting right down to the bottom of it here.
[02:24:27.180 --> 02:24:32.220]  You know the government's corrupt and bad, and so you're like, there's all this emotion
[02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:33.220]  about the poor kids.
[02:24:33.220 --> 02:24:37.540]  Yeah, let's turn our guns in, but you start thinking about, hey, who's really running
[02:24:37.540 --> 02:24:38.540]  things?
[02:24:38.540 --> 02:24:40.140]  Is it good to have only the government with guns?
[02:24:40.140 --> 02:24:42.580]  And then it sounds like you're starting to agree with me.
[02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:49.500]  Well, then I learned and found out and you showed me in paperwork and on TV what he said.
[02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:52.060]  You know, I don't put nothing past anybody.
[02:24:52.060 --> 02:24:58.500]  I've been a mother of five kids, single mother, and they told me if I sign my name, they're
[02:24:58.500 --> 02:25:03.340]  going to give me so much of food stamps, so much of cash.
[02:25:03.340 --> 02:25:06.740]  But then they put me on a budget and say, this is it.
[02:25:06.740 --> 02:25:12.340]  If the rent's 600, then you're only giving me 300, how am I going to make it with five
[02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:13.340]  kids?
[02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:17.780]  But see, that's the end of humanity where they break up our families and the state pays
[02:25:17.780 --> 02:25:19.780]  for things and they control everything.
[02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:24.580]  Well, you got a point there because I'm a living example right now.
[02:25:24.580 --> 02:25:25.860]  When I lost that job-
[02:25:25.860 --> 02:25:30.460]  You're a peace fellow, that's okay.
[02:25:30.460 --> 02:25:35.420]  Hey, guys, come help her, please, cuz if she had it off, then I put it back in and I don't
[02:25:35.420 --> 02:25:36.420]  really know how to do it.
[02:25:36.420 --> 02:25:40.940]  Okay, well, here I go, that's- He's going to help you, go ahead.
[02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:41.940]  It's good radio.
[02:25:41.940 --> 02:25:45.840]  By the way, you're wound up during the breaks, just be yourself, go ahead.
[02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:48.380]  I'm not telling you to be wound up, but you're wound up normally.
[02:25:48.380 --> 02:25:50.460]  It's not like you're in a courtroom or something, go ahead.
[02:25:50.460 --> 02:25:53.420]  Well, see, like I was saying, I don't hear anything.
[02:25:53.420 --> 02:25:55.260]  That's cuz we're not taking calls right now, go ahead.
[02:25:55.260 --> 02:26:00.580]  Well, see, like I was saying, listening to Alex Jones and he's telling me and I've seen
[02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:03.220]  it on the news, that's true.
[02:26:03.220 --> 02:26:09.900]  Because those people wired me up to work for $11 an hour and for a couple months, and then
[02:26:09.900 --> 02:26:11.100]  they threw me out the door.
[02:26:11.100 --> 02:26:14.620]  They got what they wanted from me and you're off.
[02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:19.140]  And that's true because even when I got a paycheck, I went to the boss and I said, you
[02:26:19.140 --> 02:26:21.820]  mean I worked and you didn't take out any taxes?
[02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:24.220]  Now, how could you do that?
[02:26:24.220 --> 02:26:29.140]  Cuz I'm working for Obama, he should get the same privileges I'm working for.
[02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:32.260]  Well, you're a contractor is why it happened.
[02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:36.260]  But I've noticed with the Obama folks, they won't even give people the tax forms cuz they're
[02:26:36.260 --> 02:26:37.820]  above the law.
[02:26:37.820 --> 02:26:42.680]  Well, we didn't get a tax form, they didn't take out any taxes, it didn't go, now I got
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:46.540]  a job that hit right to the government with the welfare.
[02:26:46.540 --> 02:26:48.920]  My stamps got cut, everything.
[02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:52.900]  When I was working for Obama, I got everything off the trip.
[02:26:52.900 --> 02:26:55.500]  That right there tell you that it's not right.
[02:26:55.500 --> 02:27:00.660]  Well, look, all I can say is they're doing everything they can to make it not pay to
[02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:01.980]  actually work.
[02:27:01.980 --> 02:27:03.860]  Or if you do work, you can't live on it.
[02:27:03.860 --> 02:27:06.300]  I can't, and that's true, sir.
[02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:11.460]  I just got a job and I'm glad I met you, Alex Jones, I just got a job.
[02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:16.220]  And I'm making a little bit, but it's not what I was making with Obama.
[02:27:16.220 --> 02:27:21.380]  When I was with Obama, I was making a nice dollar to pay my rent here after November
[02:27:21.380 --> 02:27:23.740]  was over, I'm out of a job.
[02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:27.060]  I couldn't even apply for unemployment or any of that.
[02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:31.140]  So like he was saying, like you say, Alex Jones, I believe that.
[02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:32.380]  Because when I got out of work-
[02:27:32.380 --> 02:27:34.780]  We'll fix your piece after the break, I'm sorry.
[02:27:34.780 --> 02:27:37.460]  I'll get it plugged in properly and get you audio stuff, okay?
[02:27:37.460 --> 02:27:38.460]  Keep talking?
[02:27:38.460 --> 02:27:40.980]  No, it's okay, just don't worry about it, okay?
[02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:43.340]  You just got up, got unplugged, never got plugged back in, right?
[02:27:43.340 --> 02:27:46.860]  We're gonna get you audio during the next thing, or we can just do this whole segment
[02:27:46.860 --> 02:27:49.380]  on it right now.
[02:27:49.380 --> 02:27:55.860]  Again, this is a program of domination, a program of total control.
[02:27:55.860 --> 02:28:00.820]  This is a program of domestication.
[02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:01.820]  That's what's happening.
[02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:02.980]  Let's jam a phone call in here.
[02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:05.700]  Jerry in Connecticut, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:08.020]  Hi there, Michelle.
[02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:11.780]  You should check out Dick Gregory's interview with Alex Jones.
[02:28:11.780 --> 02:28:18.060]  It'll clue you in a lot to what's really going on in the world and give you a better perspective.
[02:28:18.060 --> 02:28:22.580]  Because you know Dick Gregory, he's been around for the civil rights movement, he's been part
[02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:27.780]  of everything, he's seen everything, he's a man who knows the real world.
[02:28:27.780 --> 02:28:30.780]  He knows 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:36.100]  He knows they killed JFK, RFK, and Martin Luther King.
[02:28:36.100 --> 02:28:41.660]  And they're the people who want all the guns because they want to put us in the damn camps.
[02:28:41.660 --> 02:28:43.820]  And that's the end of the story.
[02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:49.540]  They want to make us dependent so we can't live on our own, we can't make our own money
[02:28:49.540 --> 02:28:50.540]  and stuff like that.
[02:28:50.540 --> 02:28:53.340]  And you got to realize, this is a sucker game.
[02:28:53.340 --> 02:28:54.940]  And I'll give you one good example.
[02:28:54.940 --> 02:29:03.900]  Guys who basically funded Romney and also funded Obama, Goldman Sachs, they played derivatives
[02:29:03.900 --> 02:29:06.860]  on foods around the world.
[02:29:06.860 --> 02:29:10.860]  And everybody's been screaming, every civil rights group, because they've been killing
[02:29:10.860 --> 02:29:12.420]  millions of kids.
[02:29:12.420 --> 02:29:17.420]  Because every time they push the prices of food up through their manipulation of the
[02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:23.900]  food prices, they're killing millions of kids in Africa, in Asia, and Obama says nothing.
[02:29:23.900 --> 02:29:24.900]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:28.020]  When food goes up like, this is a great call, I'm going to hold you over, sir.
[02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:30.260]  Stay right there, I'm going to come back to you, Jerry.
[02:29:30.260 --> 02:29:31.260]  He's exactly right.
[02:29:31.260 --> 02:29:36.340]  The increased food price is 30, 40% here, people just might not get as much food.
[02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:40.660]  Most people are living in a subsistence survival level, they starve to death.
[02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:44.820]  And then the answer is, oh well, there's too many people who let them die anyways.
[02:29:44.820 --> 02:29:48.860]  Okay, let's just say that's true, I don't agree with it.
[02:29:48.860 --> 02:29:51.740]  The globalists see us exactly the same as well, they want us dead.
[02:29:51.740 --> 02:29:52.740]  Stay there.
[02:29:52.740 --> 02:29:54.020]  We're on the march.
[02:29:54.020 --> 02:29:56.420]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.420 --> 02:30:04.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:42.560 --> 02:30:47.140]  natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the

[02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:23.060]  just so chillingly convincing and that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available
[02:32:23.060 --> 02:32:25.180]  at infowars.com.
[02:32:25.180 --> 02:32:28.740]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.

[02:32:42.460 --> 02:32:43.460]  that woke me up.
[02:32:43.460 --> 02:32:48.220]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[02:32:48.220 --> 02:32:51.100]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[02:32:51.100 --> 02:32:55.980]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the
[02:32:55.980 --> 02:32:58.020]  scourge that is vaccines.
[02:32:58.020 --> 02:33:14.100]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:18.900]  Go up to infowars.com, you can see some of the great Photoshop artwork by the Info Wars
[02:33:18.900 --> 02:33:20.740]  graphics team.
[02:33:20.740 --> 02:33:26.740]  It's Piers Morgan machine gunning the Bill of Rights and Constitution with an AR-15.
[02:33:26.740 --> 02:33:31.460]  Rahm Emanuel, take American people out of Second Amendment debate.
[02:33:31.460 --> 02:33:35.780]  And he is now announcing that they want to use executive orders.
[02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:38.180]  Again, they're expanding that.
[02:33:38.180 --> 02:33:43.180]  Chicago mayor limit access to guns, Chicago mayor and former Obama Chief of Staff Rahm
[02:33:43.180 --> 02:33:49.420]  Emanuel has proposed restricting the discussion over firearms ownership in America to law
[02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:50.420]  enforcement.
[02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:51.420]  I mean, what a dictator.
[02:33:51.420 --> 02:33:53.620]  Guys, will you get that audio for me?
[02:33:53.620 --> 02:33:56.300]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:33:56.300 --> 02:33:57.780]  It's up at infowars.com.
[02:33:57.780 --> 02:34:00.460]  This is just off the chart.
[02:34:00.460 --> 02:34:03.540]  And again, I covered this at the start of the show.
[02:34:03.540 --> 02:34:08.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are saying they're gonna use executive orders, rule making.
[02:34:08.460 --> 02:34:12.540]  But Schumer came out and said, we'll just order gun shops, do what we want.
[02:34:12.540 --> 02:34:15.340]  And by the way, you're like, well, they can't do that outside law.
[02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:17.460]  The ATF's already been doing that.
[02:34:17.460 --> 02:34:22.580]  So Michelle, Obama phone lady, we're gonna go back to the caller, Jerry, and then hurry
[02:34:22.580 --> 02:34:24.260]  through some others and get to some Twitter questions.
[02:34:24.260 --> 02:34:29.380]  They're gonna be on the news with us tonight for a more lively discussion.
[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:32.980]  I know we're just a little more calm here except during the breaks.
[02:34:32.980 --> 02:34:34.620]  Why are you so restrained right now?
[02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:35.620]  Which is fine.
[02:34:35.620 --> 02:34:37.820]  I mean, I guess we're having a serious discussion.
[02:34:37.820 --> 02:34:47.200]  Well, I'm phenomenal about what's going on and I thank God that I came here because I
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:50.540]  seen it with my own eyes.
[02:34:50.540 --> 02:34:56.220]  I guess, I mean, you were saying you've never seen the footage of yourself except on smartphones.
[02:34:56.220 --> 02:34:57.940]  You have a computer at home?
[02:34:57.940 --> 02:34:58.940]  No.
[02:34:58.940 --> 02:35:01.380]  So all you've got mainstream television.
[02:35:01.380 --> 02:35:04.940]  Mainstream television and my Obama phone.
[02:35:04.940 --> 02:35:05.940]  Which isn't a smartphone, right?
[02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:06.940]  It's just a regular phone.
[02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:07.940]  Regular phone.
[02:35:07.940 --> 02:35:09.220]  So yeah, cuz we couldn't send you text messages.
[02:35:09.220 --> 02:35:10.900]  So literally, what's the number?
[02:35:10.900 --> 02:35:14.940]  I saw a number like 65 million Americans only have access to a television.
[02:35:14.940 --> 02:35:17.540]  Oh, it's a lot of them.
[02:35:17.540 --> 02:35:20.780]  How many people in your community did just only have a television?
[02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:27.060]  A lot, a lot of people because- And so you didn't know he told all those lies?
[02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:28.060]  No.
[02:35:28.060 --> 02:35:29.060]  I've got a bunch of others.
[02:35:29.060 --> 02:35:34.940]  But I knew that he lied because about four years ago when I worked for the Obama campaign,
[02:35:34.940 --> 02:35:39.600]  he said he was gonna re-renovate Harvard and the Lee area.
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:42.980]  And that's where he started when I started campaigning for him.
[02:35:42.980 --> 02:35:46.580]  Here it is four years went on and now I'm at another four years.
[02:35:46.580 --> 02:35:48.060]  And that place still looks the same.
[02:35:48.060 --> 02:35:51.700]  Now they've only put a few hundred billion into infrastructure, which is if you are gonna
[02:35:51.700 --> 02:35:54.820]  have government funding, that actually gets the economy going and gives people real people
[02:35:54.820 --> 02:35:55.820]  jobs.
[02:35:55.820 --> 02:35:56.820]  Right.
[02:35:56.820 --> 02:35:58.100]  If it's not given to your select buddies only.
[02:35:58.100 --> 02:36:04.300]  But they've spent, last time I saw something like 47 trillion has been, 47 trillion, you
[02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:12.380]  have to understand the whole country's GDP is like 15, excuse me, 47 trillion.
[02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:15.700]  I think I said billion, those numbers are so big.
[02:36:15.700 --> 02:36:22.260]  He only spent a few hundred billion on infrastructure total in the last four years.
[02:36:22.260 --> 02:36:26.700]  And then 47 trillion to offshore mega banks, you're like, well, where'd that money go?
[02:36:26.700 --> 02:36:27.700]  Right.
[02:36:27.700 --> 02:36:28.700]  It went into derivatives.
[02:36:28.700 --> 02:36:31.960]  So it didn't even really go anywhere, it was propping up garbage.
[02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:34.700]  And then you're like, well, okay, well, then why are they doing it?
[02:36:34.700 --> 02:36:37.940]  Just suck real money out of the economy and get us into debt.
[02:36:37.940 --> 02:36:42.700]  See, we've been signed on, it'd be like if I put a chain on your leg, okay, that was
[02:36:42.700 --> 02:36:48.860]  impossible to get off, tied to, let's say a bowling ball that weighed 500 tons.
[02:36:48.860 --> 02:36:50.820]  Are you gonna ever be able to pull out of that?
[02:36:50.820 --> 02:36:51.820]  No.
[02:36:51.820 --> 02:36:54.740]  Okay, what if I threw you over the edge of a dock with that on your leg?
[02:36:54.740 --> 02:36:55.740]  No.
[02:36:55.740 --> 02:36:57.260]  So now you're gonna be on the bottom of the lake.
[02:36:57.260 --> 02:36:58.260]  Right, right.
[02:36:58.260 --> 02:37:00.900]  It's impossible and it's not our debt.
[02:37:00.900 --> 02:37:04.600]  So what I'm saying is, Michelle, they're predators, they're bad, they do everything they can to
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:10.220]  bankrupt you so that you've got to go to them because they want control.
[02:37:10.220 --> 02:37:16.160]  And that's true because, so for instance, how you say of control, I had a friend that
[02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:21.780]  was a school teacher and when she lost her job, she went to apply for unemployment, they
[02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:22.780]  turned her down.
[02:37:22.780 --> 02:37:25.780]  When she went to the welfare, they gave her the money.
[02:37:25.780 --> 02:37:30.340]  But by her not being, have you worked as a school teacher, now you're not working and
[02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:34.260]  you're on government assistance, do you know how low that is?
[02:37:34.260 --> 02:37:39.100]  So she dropped down that low, she started drinking beer.
[02:37:39.100 --> 02:37:43.980]  They sell beer in the store, but she would get so drinking, I guess her mind went crazy,
[02:37:43.980 --> 02:37:49.220]  but she would drink so much beer, then it got into what the system got in her life.
[02:37:49.220 --> 02:37:53.220]  And I was like, well, how could they take that quick?
[02:37:53.220 --> 02:37:59.820]  And just by her applying, losing her job, applying for the government, they contacted
[02:37:59.820 --> 02:38:04.540]  her, took her kids, put them in foster care and all that.
[02:38:04.540 --> 02:38:09.380]  And I'm like, here it is, a working woman, been a teacher for all these years, and it
[02:38:09.380 --> 02:38:12.380]  wasn't enough money after she lost the job or laid off her-
[02:38:12.380 --> 02:38:13.380]  And they took her kids.
[02:38:13.380 --> 02:38:19.580]  And they took her kids, but if you go down the lane of how she got corrupted like that,
[02:38:19.580 --> 02:38:21.660]  when she got corrupted, she started drinking.
[02:38:21.660 --> 02:38:25.100]  When she got drinking, I'm like, it gotta be helped, let's see about putting her in
[02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:26.100]  a place.
[02:38:26.100 --> 02:38:31.340]  When we tried to put her in one of those detox place, by her being on welfare, she couldn't
[02:38:31.340 --> 02:38:32.340]  get in.
[02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:37.620]  Here it is, a woman need help just cuz of her welfare, she can't get in, but it really
[02:38:37.620 --> 02:38:40.060]  hindered a friend of mine.
[02:38:40.060 --> 02:38:44.580]  And I couldn't feel that she works 12, 13 years as a school teacher.
[02:38:44.580 --> 02:38:48.140]  She bought the Samoogas house for these seven kids.
[02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:53.300]  And today, right now, all seven of her kids, they went through that stage with that, but
[02:38:53.300 --> 02:38:55.780]  they're doctors, social workers.
[02:38:55.780 --> 02:38:56.780]  They really-
[02:38:56.780 --> 02:39:03.940]  So the average foster child is on seven psychotropic drugs, about 67, 68%.
[02:39:03.940 --> 02:39:06.060]  And those drugs are designed to fry their brains.
[02:39:06.060 --> 02:39:07.060]  Right.
[02:39:07.060 --> 02:39:08.060]  Did they put the kids on drugs?
[02:39:08.060 --> 02:39:09.060]  They tried to get me.
[02:39:09.060 --> 02:39:11.940]  I got a son that was tested of HHD.
[02:39:11.940 --> 02:39:12.940]  Totally made up.
[02:39:12.940 --> 02:39:14.820]  Totally, I got a doctor.
[02:39:14.820 --> 02:39:19.740]  The gas get cut off by me, my family, and everybody going to Aknotaway, and I'm putting
[02:39:19.740 --> 02:39:20.740]  her on there.
[02:39:20.740 --> 02:39:23.300]  Aknotaway is a good doctor in Ohio.
[02:39:23.300 --> 02:39:28.980]  She knew me, my parents, my parents' parents, it's like a generation went down.
[02:39:28.980 --> 02:39:29.980]  And-
[02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:30.980]  See, that's family.
[02:39:30.980 --> 02:39:31.980]  Family is power.
[02:39:31.980 --> 02:39:32.980]  Right.
[02:39:32.980 --> 02:39:33.980]  The system wants to get rid of that.
[02:39:33.980 --> 02:39:39.900]  And they want federalized healthcare so that doctor can't do what they want, the state
[02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:40.900]  wants to be the doctor.
[02:39:40.900 --> 02:39:41.900]  See, they're gonna take-
[02:39:41.900 --> 02:39:46.340]  I believe that because the day right now, my doctor is getting old.
[02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:50.740]  Her and her husband used to take care of me, now my kids go to her.
[02:39:50.740 --> 02:39:53.460]  The husband has got a lot of arthritis going on.
[02:39:53.460 --> 02:39:55.420]  He ain't in there no more, it's just her.
[02:39:55.420 --> 02:39:58.020]  But people are smart, they're from China.
[02:39:58.020 --> 02:39:59.020]  You know what they're doing?
[02:39:59.020 --> 02:40:02.820]  They're sending a whole family to take up for what she's doing.
[02:40:02.820 --> 02:40:06.220]  The mother, first it was the husband and wife, Aknotaway.
[02:40:06.220 --> 02:40:09.500]  Now it's the kids, the husband and the wife being doctors.
[02:40:09.500 --> 02:40:13.380]  Like I told you about Alex Jones show, that little kid of yours, he's gonna be the next
[02:40:13.380 --> 02:40:15.260]  Alex Jones.
[02:40:15.260 --> 02:40:16.260]  Believe that.
[02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:18.020]  We get old, we can't keep going on and on.
[02:40:18.020 --> 02:40:19.400]  That's the plan.
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:22.620]  That's the plan, but I'm quite sure something happened to you.
[02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:25.020]  This little kid gonna be here if this what he like doing.
[02:40:25.020 --> 02:40:26.780]  That's all, you can't drag him away from it.
[02:40:26.780 --> 02:40:27.780]  No.
[02:40:27.780 --> 02:40:28.780]  He's a lot smarter than I am.
[02:40:28.780 --> 02:40:30.540]  And just like they say is what we teach them.
[02:40:30.540 --> 02:40:33.700]  I have kids now and they told me, you can't send that son.
[02:40:33.700 --> 02:40:40.060]  I got a son that I grew up on welfare and a low black minority, single parent with five
[02:40:40.060 --> 02:40:41.060]  kids.
[02:40:41.060 --> 02:40:43.100]  That's, Satan the devil is a liar.
[02:40:43.100 --> 02:40:46.700]  My son is Tyrone Mixon, he graduated from Hiram College.
[02:40:46.700 --> 02:40:50.820]  He's a social worker, a VA social worker.
[02:40:50.820 --> 02:40:51.820]  But-
[02:40:51.820 --> 02:40:54.220]  But see how he survived the system, but now he works for the system.
[02:40:54.220 --> 02:41:00.540]  Right, but only way that he got through was that for me being a low black minority with
[02:41:00.540 --> 02:41:05.960]  my low income, cuz we couldn't use the dad income cuz he worked at Chevy Boulevard.
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:09.140]  We had to use my income with my five kids.
[02:41:09.140 --> 02:41:14.260]  I couldn't understand that, but as we kept going and he went to Hiram for four years,
[02:41:14.260 --> 02:41:15.260]  we were eligible.
[02:41:15.260 --> 02:41:16.260]  All right, let's go back to the calls.
[02:41:16.260 --> 02:41:17.260]  This is amazing.
[02:41:17.260 --> 02:41:18.260]  You're getting wound up now.
[02:41:18.260 --> 02:41:21.620]  And we got a lot of great footage too, you're awesome.
[02:41:21.620 --> 02:41:25.420]  Let's go ahead and again, Obama phone lady is here.
[02:41:25.420 --> 02:41:28.740]  And some people online thought I was gonna get her here just to be mean to her.
[02:41:28.740 --> 02:41:34.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't need to be mean to people to feel powerful about myself.
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:35.080]  It is upsetting.
[02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:39.620]  You're saying I vote for Obama, I'm gonna get a free phone, he's gonna do more.
[02:41:39.620 --> 02:41:42.980]  But there was that humanity and you knew it was funny when you were saying it.
[02:41:42.980 --> 02:41:47.060]  And so yes, we're laughing, but we're not really laughing at you, we're laughing with
[02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:48.060]  you.
[02:41:48.060 --> 02:41:50.660]  What did you think I was gonna do when you got down here?
[02:41:50.660 --> 02:41:55.740]  Well, one thing about it and two for show, can't nobody make you look funny if you don't
[02:41:55.740 --> 02:41:57.340]  allow them to make you look funny?
[02:41:57.340 --> 02:42:04.120]  I knew whatever thing I did on YouTube with Obama, the people were not happy.
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:07.460]  And I don't know why, but I was happy.
[02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:12.940]  Because I was out there campaigning and when it came time for that cameraman to run up
[02:42:12.940 --> 02:42:16.460]  on me, I said, if he run up on me again, I'm talking.
[02:42:16.460 --> 02:42:18.220]  And our bosses had already told us.
[02:42:18.220 --> 02:42:19.780]  Hey, your bosses have told you?
[02:42:19.780 --> 02:42:20.780]  Sorry.
[02:42:20.780 --> 02:42:23.380]  Yeah, already told us, them cameraman's run up on you, you leave them alone.
[02:42:23.380 --> 02:42:29.140]  I said, not me, walk two miles and the man keep brushing me with a camera, he pushed
[02:42:29.140 --> 02:42:30.140]  me.
[02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:33.500]  And the next time he pushed me, I got to talking, it was more than just me talking.
[02:42:33.500 --> 02:42:36.100]  Wait a minute, that guy pushed you to get you mad.
[02:42:36.100 --> 02:42:39.740]  He pushed me, and when he pushed me, he started talking, what are you going to do?
[02:42:39.740 --> 02:42:42.780]  And Aranymi was just getting out of the truck.
[02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:44.940]  Now you call him Aranymi.
[02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:49.060]  Aranymi, Aranymo, Aranymi fool.
[02:42:49.060 --> 02:42:51.460]  Tell us about, you saw him at Aranymi, tell the story.
[02:42:51.460 --> 02:42:56.940]  Well, while I was campaigning, as you've seen on YouTube, we were walking in the circles.
[02:42:56.940 --> 02:43:02.060]  But Aranymi was standing there and just got out of a truck entering the building.
[02:43:02.060 --> 02:43:07.940]  And they told us to holler and hold our signs up and say more and more to him.
[02:43:07.940 --> 02:43:13.020]  And if I can holler at Aranymi, what about this little man with this camera behind me?
[02:43:13.020 --> 02:43:17.040]  So they kept on saying, don't talk, don't talk, keep it moving, keep it moving.
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:22.020]  It's raining, we're walking, I done walked about two miles, and then he pushed up on
[02:43:22.020 --> 02:43:24.120]  me again, and that's when I got to talking.
[02:43:24.120 --> 02:43:31.860]  But when I got to the office, the next day, they was like, we need you in the office.
[02:43:31.860 --> 02:43:33.780]  So I knew I had did something.
[02:43:33.780 --> 02:43:36.180]  That's why they called me the Obama phone lady.
[02:43:36.180 --> 02:43:39.060]  Uh-oh, now you're starting to wake up.
[02:43:39.060 --> 02:43:40.060]  Look out.
[02:43:40.060 --> 02:43:42.740]  What would you say to that camera guy if you could see him again?
[02:43:42.740 --> 02:43:48.180]  Man, where the heck you at, and why you do me like that?
[02:43:48.180 --> 02:43:49.180]  Cuz he ran off.
[02:43:49.180 --> 02:43:54.400]  Now, that cameraman who got me on YouTube, he got whatever he got, he didn't give me
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:57.140]  a name, number, card, anything.
[02:43:57.140 --> 02:43:59.820]  But I thank you for getting me where you got me today.
[02:43:59.820 --> 02:44:03.100]  In fact, when you got off the plane, you were thanking Obama.
[02:44:03.100 --> 02:44:05.900]  I mean, I guess Obama is our great provider.
[02:44:05.900 --> 02:44:09.460]  I don't know about all that right now.
[02:44:09.460 --> 02:44:10.460]  Tell me about Obama.
[02:44:10.460 --> 02:44:11.460]  You like him, don't you?
[02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:12.460]  Well, I like Obama.
[02:44:12.460 --> 02:44:14.900]  You think he's pretty handsome, don't you?
[02:44:14.900 --> 02:44:17.740]  No, I think Harvey's handsome.
[02:44:17.740 --> 02:44:20.500]  I wish Harvey, Harvey is pretty slick, actually.
[02:44:20.500 --> 02:44:21.500]  I like him.
[02:44:21.500 --> 02:44:22.500]  I love Harvey.
[02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:23.500]  He looks like he could be in movies.
[02:44:23.500 --> 02:44:24.500]  Okay.
[02:44:24.500 --> 02:44:25.500]  Kind of a cool cat.
[02:44:25.500 --> 02:44:26.500]  He is a cool cat.
[02:44:26.500 --> 02:44:27.500]  I love Harvey.
[02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:34.220]  But anyway, Obama, what I liked about Obama, and it's just for me.
[02:44:34.220 --> 02:44:39.700]  When I campaigned this year, I was out in canvassing in the world of Cleveland, and
[02:44:39.700 --> 02:44:42.140]  a lot of people didn't know a lot.
[02:44:42.140 --> 02:44:45.300]  And one thing about it, I would be like, can I take your number?
[02:44:45.300 --> 02:44:48.220]  And they'd be like, you can call me, but I can't talk back.
[02:44:48.220 --> 02:44:49.700]  I'll call you at another phone.
[02:44:49.700 --> 02:44:50.980]  I'm like, what?
[02:44:50.980 --> 02:44:51.980]  This Obama phone.
[02:44:51.980 --> 02:44:55.980]  And I was like, well, if a man gave you Obama phone, is you gonna vote for him?
[02:44:55.980 --> 02:44:56.980]  Heck yeah.
[02:44:56.980 --> 02:45:00.140]  I was like, plenty of people telling me, yeah, I'm gonna vote for Obama, but I don't even
[02:45:00.140 --> 02:45:01.140]  got a state ID.
[02:45:01.140 --> 02:45:05.740]  I had to show people how in Cleveland, you can get your birth certificate and stuff free
[02:45:05.740 --> 02:45:08.980]  to get a state ID so you can vote for Obama.
[02:45:08.980 --> 02:45:10.860]  Did you see any illegals vote?
[02:45:10.860 --> 02:45:11.860]  Illegal?
[02:45:11.860 --> 02:45:13.660]  People that aren't citizens.
[02:45:13.660 --> 02:45:15.860]  Yeah, I even got them to vote.
[02:45:15.860 --> 02:45:16.860]  No, hold on.
[02:45:16.860 --> 02:45:18.860]  Seriously, I was just joking.
[02:45:18.860 --> 02:45:19.860]  I did.
[02:45:19.860 --> 02:45:20.860]  People that wasn't in our country.
[02:45:20.860 --> 02:45:21.860]  No, no.
[02:45:21.860 --> 02:45:26.940]  I had some people, foreign people, that had a paper stating that they were here.
[02:45:26.940 --> 02:45:31.820]  They turned over from, they call them Arabs, Arabs.
[02:45:31.820 --> 02:45:34.460]  In Cleveland, we call them Arabs.
[02:45:34.460 --> 02:45:38.780]  And the Arabs on the store, they've been here two years or whatever, but they don't have
[02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:40.780]  a state driver's license or a state ID.
[02:45:40.780 --> 02:45:44.180]  You're saying in Ohio, they let people vote from other countries.
[02:45:44.180 --> 02:45:46.340]  No, they had to get a state ID.
[02:45:46.340 --> 02:45:51.460]  No, I understand, but getting the ID allowed them to vote.
[02:45:51.460 --> 02:45:52.460]  Right.
[02:45:52.460 --> 02:45:53.460]  Cuz they've been here.
[02:45:53.460 --> 02:45:58.500]  And that dude told me he'd been here three, four years and he never voted cuz he foreign
[02:45:58.500 --> 02:46:00.060]  or not from here.
[02:46:00.060 --> 02:46:01.780]  And I said, how long you been here?
[02:46:01.780 --> 02:46:02.780]  And he said two years.
[02:46:02.780 --> 02:46:04.780]  And I said- And you're sure they weren't citizens?
[02:46:04.780 --> 02:46:06.680]  No, they weren't citizens.
[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:08.700]  Not if you ain't from America.
[02:46:08.700 --> 02:46:14.460]  They had IDs from Wyoming, W-Y-O-M-I-N-G, Wyoming or-
[02:46:14.460 --> 02:46:15.460]  Yemen?
[02:46:15.460 --> 02:46:16.460]  Something like that.
[02:46:16.460 --> 02:46:20.420]  I knew they weren't cuz they talk like we talk, but they're not from here.
[02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:21.500]  All right, Michelle, I just wanna be clear.
[02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:22.500]  I like you.
[02:46:22.500 --> 02:46:24.580]  I think you're a good person.
[02:46:24.580 --> 02:46:32.420]  And I wanted to make sure earlier, just to be clear, you didn't know that people that
[02:46:32.420 --> 02:46:34.740]  are foreigners aren't allowed to vote, right?
[02:46:34.740 --> 02:46:35.740]  You didn't know that.
[02:46:35.740 --> 02:46:36.740]  No.
[02:46:36.740 --> 02:46:41.100]  But when they've been here in America so long, they could go get a state ID and vote.
[02:46:41.100 --> 02:46:43.940]  I know, so they told you that was okay at the Democratic Party.
[02:46:43.940 --> 02:46:44.940]  Yeah.
[02:46:44.940 --> 02:46:46.580]  They said, go get them a driver's license.
[02:46:46.580 --> 02:46:50.940]  They've been here for so amount of ups town cuz I had to check back with the office and
[02:46:50.940 --> 02:46:52.900]  see how they can vote.
[02:46:52.900 --> 02:46:56.900]  They're illegal American now, they've been here so long.
[02:46:56.900 --> 02:46:58.100]  So they were citizens.
[02:46:58.100 --> 02:47:01.620]  They were citizen, but they didn't know that they were citizen.
[02:47:01.620 --> 02:47:06.740]  Well, I guess they did know because they still have foreign identification, but they've been
[02:47:06.740 --> 02:47:09.300]  here a long time.
[02:47:09.300 --> 02:47:12.300]  And then you would help them go get a driver's license that allowed them to vote.
[02:47:12.300 --> 02:47:13.300]  Right.
[02:47:13.300 --> 02:47:14.300]  State ID.
[02:47:14.300 --> 02:47:15.300]  And they were able to vote.
[02:47:15.300 --> 02:47:16.300]  They've been here for up some years.
[02:47:16.300 --> 02:47:20.100]  He said he owned a store like four years, he never voted.
[02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:21.100]  And I said, well, why?
[02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:23.620]  He said he never even applied for a state ID.
[02:47:23.620 --> 02:47:26.180]  Have you heard about the problem of illegal aliens voting?
[02:47:26.180 --> 02:47:27.180]  No.
[02:47:27.180 --> 02:47:30.580]  All right, well, let's just be clear.
[02:47:30.580 --> 02:47:32.460]  You're not sure if they were citizens or not.
[02:47:32.460 --> 02:47:36.980]  I believe they were citizens because I took them to get an ID and they were able to vote.
[02:47:36.980 --> 02:47:40.220]  So they had to live here for a long time, a period of time, and just didn't know that.
[02:47:40.220 --> 02:47:42.220]  Well, you know in California, they're giving illegals IDs.
[02:47:42.220 --> 02:47:43.620]  I mean, they give them to them everywhere.
[02:47:43.620 --> 02:47:44.620]  They give them to them in Texas.
[02:47:44.620 --> 02:47:46.340]  Well, see, I didn't know that.
[02:47:46.340 --> 02:47:50.140]  In Cleveland, I know, if you ain't got a state ID, that was my job title.
[02:47:50.140 --> 02:47:52.440]  If you didn't have a state ID, you couldn't go vote.
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:55.620]  But if I can go and get you, you can go with your birth certificate in Social Security
[02:47:55.620 --> 02:47:57.500]  and get a state ID, you can vote.
[02:47:57.500 --> 02:48:00.060]  So they had birth certificates and state IDs?
[02:48:00.060 --> 02:48:01.820]  No, they didn't have state IDs.
[02:48:01.820 --> 02:48:04.760]  They had them out of town IDs.
[02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:06.100]  So they didn't have birth certificates?
[02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:08.260]  They had birth certificates, but they had been here.
[02:48:08.260 --> 02:48:09.260]  They're legal.
[02:48:09.260 --> 02:48:11.520]  They're legal to be in Ohio.
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:13.420]  But they didn't ever- They were legal immigrants.
[02:48:13.420 --> 02:48:14.420]  Right.
[02:48:14.420 --> 02:48:15.420]  They've been here a while.
[02:48:15.420 --> 02:48:16.420]  They were citizens.
[02:48:16.420 --> 02:48:17.420]  Yeah, they're citizens.
[02:48:17.420 --> 02:48:19.380]  If they're legal, they're citizens.
[02:48:19.380 --> 02:48:22.180]  They were citizens, but they didn't know nothing about getting a state ID.
[02:48:22.180 --> 02:48:23.180]  All right, that makes sense.
[02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:24.180]  Okay, they were citizens.
[02:48:24.180 --> 02:48:25.180]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[02:48:25.180 --> 02:48:26.180]  They were citizens.
[02:48:26.180 --> 02:48:27.180]  They've been here, what, three, four years?
[02:48:27.180 --> 02:48:28.180]  Yeah.
[02:48:28.180 --> 02:48:29.580]  And then they didn't ever- I've had a couple of them like that.
[02:48:29.580 --> 02:48:31.460]  I had people, girls 21.
[02:48:31.460 --> 02:48:33.660]  I had a lot of young girls.
[02:48:33.660 --> 02:48:36.820]  You know, they talking on Obama, living in the projects.
[02:48:36.820 --> 02:48:40.580]  If that phone stop your minutes, what you going to do?
[02:48:40.580 --> 02:48:41.580]  Go to a payphone.
[02:48:41.580 --> 02:48:44.140]  She had no other choice.
[02:48:44.140 --> 02:48:48.940]  But by him giving you that phone, this what I preached to him when I was in the field service.
[02:48:48.940 --> 02:48:52.460]  By him giving you that phone, do you want to give him a vote?
[02:48:52.460 --> 02:48:56.420]  She tell me, I don't know what Obama do, but you talking on his phone.
[02:48:56.420 --> 02:48:59.300]  Open your phone and tell me what it say as soon as you open it.
[02:48:59.300 --> 02:49:03.460]  She open and say, Obama, you know he's running for president right now?
[02:49:03.460 --> 02:49:04.460]  That's how I got it.
[02:49:04.460 --> 02:49:06.780]  And then you didn't even have to give me anything.
[02:49:06.780 --> 02:49:08.660]  Do you got your state ID on you?
[02:49:08.660 --> 02:49:11.540]  And they will say, yeah, all I need is the numbers.
[02:49:11.540 --> 02:49:15.900]  I can take the numbers off that state ID and give her a blue form where you can mail it
[02:49:15.900 --> 02:49:16.900]  in.
[02:49:16.900 --> 02:49:17.900]  You don't even got to go to here.
[02:49:17.900 --> 02:49:18.900]  I got warrants.
[02:49:18.900 --> 02:49:20.420]  I'm not going to the Board of Elections.
[02:49:20.420 --> 02:49:21.420]  You don't need to.
[02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:24.300]  Let me fill this paper out and the ballot going to come to your house.
[02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:27.980]  When the ballot come in, you fill it out and mail it right back.
[02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:28.980]  Wow.
[02:49:28.980 --> 02:49:29.980]  Amazing.
[02:49:29.980 --> 02:49:33.820]  Stacks of people like that in Cleveland, you know?
[02:49:33.820 --> 02:49:35.140]  Let's talk to Jerry.
[02:49:35.140 --> 02:49:37.940]  This is long folks, Obama phone lady here in studio with us.
[02:49:37.940 --> 02:49:41.020]  Jerry in Connecticut, finish up your point, my friend.
[02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:42.020]  Yeah.
[02:49:42.020 --> 02:49:45.220]  Michelle, you seem like you're a believing woman.
[02:49:45.220 --> 02:49:49.340]  You realize we're in the latter days, I'm sure you do, from all the signs and things
[02:49:49.340 --> 02:49:50.340]  like that, right?
[02:49:50.340 --> 02:49:51.340]  Right.
[02:49:51.340 --> 02:49:59.380]  Well, why don't you look up Obama and November 5th, Illinois State Lottery winning.
[02:49:59.380 --> 02:50:04.340]  If God was going to give us an indication that this man is on the wrong side of this
[02:50:04.340 --> 02:50:10.660]  battle for our souls, then look up November 5th, Illinois Lottery.
[02:50:10.660 --> 02:50:14.660]  The number that came up for the pick three, three, and this is not a, I checked this out
[02:50:14.660 --> 02:50:20.060]  myself on one of those, you know, check the numbers, you know, type of thing came up six,
[02:50:20.060 --> 02:50:21.060]  six, six.
[02:50:21.060 --> 02:50:22.060]  No, I remember.
[02:50:22.060 --> 02:50:24.900]  And then some others came up six, six, six.
[02:50:24.900 --> 02:50:25.900]  Right.
[02:50:25.900 --> 02:50:26.900]  I remember that too.
[02:50:26.900 --> 02:50:27.900]  Yeah.
[02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:33.380]  Anyway, the other thing I wanted to mention is the Tuskegee situation kept talking about
[02:50:33.380 --> 02:50:38.340]  now that guy that did that experiment and the Tuskegee, he's an equal opportunity guy.
[02:50:38.340 --> 02:50:39.620]  They didn't put him in jail.
[02:50:39.620 --> 02:50:40.620]  You know what they did?
[02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:45.700]  They took him off to one of the nuclear plants out in, I think it was in Ohio.
[02:50:45.700 --> 02:50:52.460]  And then he decided to do an experiment by releasing all those nice nuclear particles
[02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:55.580]  in the air to see how they would affect other people in the entire region.
[02:50:55.580 --> 02:50:56.580]  Isn't that nice?
[02:50:56.580 --> 02:50:58.180]  Our government is really working for us.
[02:50:58.180 --> 02:50:59.180]  Yeah, they're really good people.
[02:50:59.180 --> 02:51:01.980]  I think we should turn our guns into more calls coming up.
[02:51:01.980 --> 02:51:10.020]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you
[02:51:10.020 --> 02:51:15.300]  and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every
[02:51:15.300 --> 02:51:16.300]  front.
[02:51:16.300 --> 02:51:22.060]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[02:51:22.060 --> 02:51:23.060]  your help.
[02:51:23.060 --> 02:51:28.300]  By getting the films, bumper stickers and T-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up
[02:51:28.300 --> 02:51:34.320]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:51:34.320 --> 02:51:37.780]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:51:37.780 --> 02:51:43.980]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:51:43.980 --> 02:51:51.420]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:52.980]  and ultimate extermination.
[02:51:52.980 --> 02:51:55.340]  The war is here.
[02:51:55.340 --> 02:52:02.660]  It's an Infowar, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:52:02.660 --> 02:52:07.220]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[02:52:07.220 --> 02:52:12.300]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[02:52:12.300 --> 02:52:14.060]  This is really scary stuff.
[02:52:14.060 --> 02:52:19.300]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known.
[02:52:19.300 --> 02:52:23.600]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed
[02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:27.260]  piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[02:52:27.260 --> 02:52:30.140]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[02:52:30.140 --> 02:52:34.020]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.
[02:52:34.020 --> 02:52:39.700]  That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat
[02:52:39.700 --> 02:52:42.500]  and blows the doors off a conspiracy.
[02:52:42.500 --> 02:52:48.360]  Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is plus
[02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:53.260]  discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[02:52:53.260 --> 02:52:57.860]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone
[02:52:57.860 --> 02:52:58.860]  forever.
[02:52:58.860 --> 02:52:59.860]  Again, that's weirddevice.com.
[02:52:59.860 --> 02:53:06.340]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[02:53:06.340 --> 02:53:07.340]  Box.
[02:53:07.340 --> 02:53:10.300]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:10.300 --> 02:53:15.100]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White
[02:53:15.100 --> 02:53:19.420]  House at a time when only the president could obtain its world-class healer.
[02:53:19.420 --> 02:53:24.980]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:24.980 --> 02:53:30.040]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:35.180]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[02:53:35.180 --> 02:53:36.320]  normal cell.
[02:53:36.320 --> 02:53:40.080]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[02:53:40.080 --> 02:53:44.060]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:44.060 --> 02:53:48.420]  Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from carnivora.com.
[02:53:48.420 --> 02:53:51.980]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:53:51.980 --> 02:53:59.380]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit carnivora.com.
[02:53:59.380 --> 02:54:00.380]  Protect your immune system.
[02:54:00.380 --> 02:54:09.020]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:54:09.020 --> 02:54:12.100]  Obviously we're going to have to go into 20 minutes, 30 minutes of overdrive to get to
[02:54:12.100 --> 02:54:16.300]  all your phone calls and get to all these Twitter questions.
[02:54:16.300 --> 02:54:17.300]  There are so many.
[02:54:17.300 --> 02:54:18.940]  I mean, I've got hundreds here and they're all so good.
[02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:23.940]  I'm going to try to go through a bunch of quick questions for you and not dominate.
[02:54:23.940 --> 02:54:29.020]  Obviously on the nightly news tonight, I think David Ortiz is doing the first part, but I'm
[02:54:29.020 --> 02:54:30.820]  going to do the interview part.
[02:54:30.820 --> 02:54:33.260]  She's warmed up now, folks.
[02:54:33.260 --> 02:54:36.300]  We're going to air some excerpts to it when she got here yesterday on the nightly news,
[02:54:36.300 --> 02:54:38.020]  seven o'clock central.
[02:54:38.020 --> 02:54:41.300]  But I'm also going to cover, man, this is bad.
[02:54:41.300 --> 02:54:44.700]  I covered some of it today, but I didn't get into all of it.
[02:54:44.700 --> 02:54:47.940]  The announcement is they're just going to go with executive authority.
[02:54:47.940 --> 02:54:52.700]  Executive orders, ordering gun shops to shut down, not to sell semi-autos.
[02:54:52.700 --> 02:54:57.580]  And now Rahm Emanuel has said, citizens aren't even in the discussion about guns, the police
[02:54:57.580 --> 02:54:58.580]  are.
[02:54:58.580 --> 02:54:59.580]  Well, that's judge dread.
[02:54:59.580 --> 02:55:02.420]  I mean, it might as well just become the Soviet Union.
[02:55:02.420 --> 02:55:06.300]  And this is where big governments and big police forces always go, while we obsess over
[02:55:06.300 --> 02:55:07.300]  the police.
[02:55:07.300 --> 02:55:11.180]  There are a lot of good police and either a department's good or it's bad.
[02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:16.080]  There's hardly ever an in between, but the feds want bad departments like the Chicago
[02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:23.180]  mob run Rahm Emanuel system and Rahm Emanuel is a despicable person.
[02:55:23.180 --> 02:55:28.260]  Here is the mayor of Chicago, very dangerous person, saying that he wants the American
[02:55:28.260 --> 02:55:31.540]  people to not be able to have any input on their guns.
[02:55:31.540 --> 02:55:34.060]  Hey, punk, it's called the Second Amendment, here it is.
[02:55:34.060 --> 02:55:39.140]  One, it's all about criminal access, it's not about gun control, it's about criminal
[02:55:39.140 --> 02:55:40.860]  access to guns.
[02:55:40.860 --> 02:55:42.740]  That changes the debate.
[02:55:42.740 --> 02:55:48.900]  Two, put the police chief in the law enforcement community front and center, everybody else
[02:55:48.900 --> 02:55:53.540]  from politician to whatever, take a back seat, because the police chiefs have a credibility
[02:55:53.540 --> 02:55:57.420]  and authority and a voice on this, which is why they're all there.
[02:55:57.420 --> 02:56:01.380]  I do believe as it relates to both the type of weapon being an assault weapon in this
[02:56:01.380 --> 02:56:07.300]  case or the assault magazine, as Mike has, I think, strenuously focused us on message
[02:56:07.300 --> 02:56:13.580]  on that, because the difference between a magazine that holds 10 and a magazine that
[02:56:13.580 --> 02:56:17.980]  holds 20 or 30 is a lot of different type of damage that's done.
[02:56:17.980 --> 02:56:23.820]  And those are the three things I do think you can change this debate.
[02:56:23.820 --> 02:56:27.660]  I also think the country's in a different place like it was when we did Brady.
[02:56:27.660 --> 02:56:33.940]  Man, the older he gets, he looks like a twin brother of Bloomberg.
[02:56:33.940 --> 02:56:36.180]  I was just sitting there looking at him.
[02:56:36.180 --> 02:56:40.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, you just heard him say, now by the way, in major polls, 98% you can
[02:56:40.460 --> 02:56:43.100]  pull this up of police are pro-Second Amendment.
[02:56:43.100 --> 02:56:45.980]  Most of the police chiefs are anti-Second Amendment because they're getting federal
[02:56:45.980 --> 02:56:46.980]  money.
[02:56:46.980 --> 02:56:52.700]  And there is a guy up there who's an Israeli officer, by the way, it's just unbelievable,
[02:56:52.700 --> 02:56:57.540]  saying, by the way, our tax money pays to get Israel guns, which I'm all for citizens
[02:56:57.540 --> 02:57:00.620]  having guns wherever, Switzerland, Israel, wherever.
[02:57:00.620 --> 02:57:04.220]  And then he doesn't want us to have guns, he wants us to be like Chicago where the citizens
[02:57:04.220 --> 02:57:05.340]  don't have guns.
[02:57:05.340 --> 02:57:07.100]  What do you think of that?
[02:57:07.100 --> 02:57:08.820]  I think that sucks.
[02:57:08.820 --> 02:57:12.160]  Well, there you go, you're becoming an info warrior.
[02:57:12.160 --> 02:57:14.920]  He gets to have guns and bodyguards, but we don't?
[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:15.920]  We need the same thing.
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:18.420]  And you say we need a Second Amendment bad.
[02:57:18.420 --> 02:57:21.300]  We need a Second Amendment bad.
[02:57:21.300 --> 02:57:22.300]  That's true.
[02:57:22.300 --> 02:57:23.300]  How about an Obama gun?
[02:57:23.300 --> 02:57:26.540]  He gave me an M4, he gonna do more.
[02:57:26.540 --> 02:57:30.980]  That would be constitutional if the government issued us all weapons.
[02:57:30.980 --> 02:57:34.300]  I'm serious, that's what taxes are for.
[02:57:34.300 --> 02:57:39.860]  The state should be taking taxes out to issue everybody that wants to be in the state militia,
[02:57:39.860 --> 02:57:42.780]  we should have grenade launchers, everything.
[02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:46.420]  You know Switzerland has that, they don't have any crime, almost none.
[02:57:46.420 --> 02:57:48.660]  That makes sense though.
[02:57:48.660 --> 02:57:51.060]  Absolutely, we're the people, we're the government.
[02:57:51.060 --> 02:57:56.820]  That's right, we got you in there, right, give us some, keep us safe, you feel me?
[02:57:56.820 --> 02:57:59.260]  You think anybody's gonna be messing around, everybody's armed?
[02:57:59.260 --> 02:58:00.260]  No.
[02:58:00.260 --> 02:58:02.860]  No, they're not.
[02:58:02.860 --> 02:58:06.780]  And of course, then all the tough guys will leave their guns at home, Bill, don't take
[02:58:06.780 --> 02:58:08.140]  your guns to town.
[02:58:08.140 --> 02:58:09.140]  Right.
[02:58:09.140 --> 02:58:11.940]  You know that song Johnny Cash?
[02:58:11.940 --> 02:58:18.800]  Don't take your guns to town, Bill, leave your guns at home, son.
[02:58:18.800 --> 02:58:19.800]  It's Obama lady.
[02:58:19.800 --> 02:58:23.620]  The Obama lady in town, Austin, Texas right here.
[02:58:23.620 --> 02:58:25.820]  Can you say I got me an Obama M4?
[02:58:25.820 --> 02:58:28.020]  What's that?
[02:58:28.020 --> 02:58:29.700]  That's an M16.
[02:58:29.700 --> 02:58:33.820]  I got me an Obama M4, and he's gonna do more, he's gonna get me a grenade launcher under
[02:58:33.820 --> 02:58:36.740]  it.
[02:58:36.740 --> 02:58:41.140]  Say hello to my little friend, Overdrive, your calls, tweet questions and more, stay
[02:58:41.140 --> 02:58:42.140]  with us.

[02:58:53.580 --> 02:58:58.580]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[02:58:58.580 --> 02:59:03.160]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[02:59:03.160 --> 02:59:05.020]  by a disastrous economy?
[02:59:05.020 --> 02:59:07.740]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

[02:59:14.460 --> 02:59:19.000]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores
[02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:23.820]  are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[02:59:23.820 --> 02:59:24.820]  and niece.
[02:59:24.820 --> 02:59:28.620]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[02:59:28.620 --> 02:59:30.860]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

[03:00:27.460 --> 03:00:30.140]  We're going to them right now.
[03:00:30.140 --> 03:00:35.100]  And who is that first caller?
[03:00:35.100 --> 03:00:38.060]  Abdel in Arizona, you're on the air.
[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:39.060]  Welcome.
[03:00:39.060 --> 03:00:40.940]  You're on the phone with Obama lady.
[03:00:40.940 --> 03:00:43.180]  How are you doing, Alex?
[03:00:43.180 --> 03:00:44.180]  Good, man.
[03:00:44.180 --> 03:00:45.180]  What's on your mind?
[03:00:45.180 --> 03:00:46.180]  Nothing much.
[03:00:46.180 --> 03:00:48.700]  I just wanted to say hello to you and to Obama lady.
[03:00:48.700 --> 03:00:53.740]  Here in Tucson, everybody calls it the same thing like we've been calling it since they
[03:00:53.740 --> 03:00:54.740]  came out.
[03:00:54.740 --> 03:01:00.540]  So it's kind of a spontaneous thing, I would believe to call the phone from the phone.
[03:01:00.540 --> 03:01:01.540]  Yeah.
[03:01:01.540 --> 03:01:03.980]  So yeah, I'm now everybody I know is calling their phone, the Obama phone.
[03:01:03.980 --> 03:01:04.980]  Yeah.
[03:01:04.980 --> 03:01:09.860]  It seems like anything that comes, socialist will go ahead and call it the Obama and whatever
[03:01:09.860 --> 03:01:10.860]  it is.
[03:01:10.860 --> 03:01:14.060]  And on that note, you know, I'm a long time listener.
[03:01:14.060 --> 03:01:16.300]  I've been following you for about nine, 10 years.
[03:01:16.300 --> 03:01:21.140]  I've had my own MK ultra experience here in Tucson that, you know, I would be for a different
[03:01:21.140 --> 03:01:26.740]  call or whatnot, but yeah, you know, that's the thing is that even with me knowing the
[03:01:26.740 --> 03:01:30.940]  whole situation with the new world order and everything, I still voted for him twice.
[03:01:30.940 --> 03:01:32.820]  And I consider myself a libertarian.
[03:01:32.820 --> 03:01:33.820]  I follow Ron Paul.
[03:01:33.820 --> 03:01:37.020]  So that's how powerful and how dangerous he is.
[03:01:37.020 --> 03:01:38.020]  Even me knowing better.
[03:01:38.020 --> 03:01:40.420]  I still go ahead and vote for him.
[03:01:40.420 --> 03:01:42.140]  That does sound like mind control.
[03:01:42.140 --> 03:01:44.500]  My thing is you've got to call the whole thing as a fraud.
[03:01:44.500 --> 03:01:48.020]  It's like when I got in, here's Morgan's face and said, look, the scams over, man, you want
[03:01:48.020 --> 03:01:49.020]  my guns.
[03:01:49.020 --> 03:01:51.020]  Shut up and stop saying, you know, they're like, well, you just want your guns.
[03:01:51.020 --> 03:01:52.020]  We want something reasonable.
[03:01:52.020 --> 03:01:53.020]  We just want some reasonable.
[03:01:53.020 --> 03:01:54.020]  Here's the bill.
[03:01:54.020 --> 03:01:55.020]  Gonna turn your guns in.
[03:01:55.020 --> 03:01:56.020]  I'm like, shut up.
[03:01:56.020 --> 03:01:57.020]  Stop lying to my face.
[03:01:57.020 --> 03:01:58.020]  You punk.
[03:01:58.020 --> 03:01:59.020]  Good job on that.
[03:01:59.020 --> 03:02:00.020]  So that was awesome.
[03:02:00.020 --> 03:02:01.020]  I got really excited.
[03:02:01.020 --> 03:02:02.020]  I got it.
[03:02:02.020 --> 03:02:03.020]  You know, the electric Liberty, you like to say kind of, you know, transcends through
[03:02:03.020 --> 03:02:04.020]  the television.
[03:02:04.020 --> 03:02:05.020]  And a lot of people saw that.
[03:02:05.020 --> 03:02:06.020]  God bless you.
[03:02:06.020 --> 03:02:07.020]  I appreciate you holding to say that.
[03:02:07.020 --> 03:02:08.020]  What would you say to Piers Morgan?
[03:02:08.020 --> 03:02:09.020]  Red coat.
[03:02:09.020 --> 03:02:10.020]  What would you say to him coming over our country and saying, turn your guns in?
[03:02:10.020 --> 03:02:11.020]  I'm like, shut up.
[03:02:11.020 --> 03:02:12.020]  Shut up.
[03:02:12.020 --> 03:02:13.020]  Shut up.
[03:02:13.020 --> 03:02:14.020]  Shut up.
[03:02:14.020 --> 03:02:15.020]  Shut up.
[03:02:15.020 --> 03:02:16.020]  Shut up.
[03:02:16.020 --> 03:02:17.020]  Shut up.
[03:02:17.020 --> 03:02:18.020]  Shut up.
[03:02:18.020 --> 03:02:19.020]  Shut up.
[03:02:19.020 --> 03:02:20.020]  Shut up.
[03:02:20.020 --> 03:02:21.020]  Shut up.
[03:02:21.020 --> 03:02:22.020]  Shut up.
[03:02:22.020 --> 03:02:23.020]  We got to keep it simple.
[03:02:23.020 --> 03:02:24.020]  All of us are still in the country and say.
[03:02:24.020 --> 03:02:25.020]  And turn your guns in.
[03:02:25.020 --> 03:02:26.020]  Stop lying.
[03:02:26.020 --> 03:02:27.020]  Take that stuff back to where you come from.
[03:02:27.020 --> 03:02:29.340]  If you could be saved with a gun, we need to be saved with ours.
[03:02:29.340 --> 03:02:30.340]  That's right.
[03:02:30.340 --> 03:02:32.780]  So now you're being converted.
[03:02:32.780 --> 03:02:38.840]  The Obama phone lady is now Obama M4 lady.
[03:02:38.840 --> 03:02:42.240]  Protect me with Obama gun, Obama grenade.
[03:02:42.240 --> 03:02:45.740]  Protection just like him.
[03:02:45.740 --> 03:02:46.780]  There you go.
[03:02:46.780 --> 03:02:47.780]  Common Sense.
[03:02:47.780 --> 03:02:48.780]  That's right.
[03:02:48.780 --> 03:02:54.340]  What do you think of Rahm Emanuel saying, let's take the gun laws out of the hands of
[03:02:54.340 --> 03:02:57.640]  the people and just let the paramilitary take our guns?
[03:02:57.640 --> 03:02:58.640]  No.
[03:02:58.640 --> 03:03:03.660]  Doesn't Rahm Emanuel look like a bad guy out of a cartoon, like out of a-
[03:03:03.660 --> 03:03:04.660]  He look like he drunk.
[03:03:04.660 --> 03:03:08.180]  He look like he drinks, he's a little buzzin'.
[03:03:08.180 --> 03:03:09.180]  Well he is a crazed maniac.
[03:03:09.180 --> 03:03:10.740]  You know, he's a ballet dancer.
[03:03:10.740 --> 03:03:11.740]  Is he?
[03:03:11.740 --> 03:03:18.180]  Well, I wouldn't listen to nothing he say, any man step on they tiptoes a fool and don't
[03:03:18.180 --> 03:03:25.100]  walk on tiptoes and get sewer and plumbing.
[03:03:25.100 --> 03:03:27.060]  You like real men, don't you?
[03:03:27.060 --> 03:03:28.060]  Yeah.
[03:03:28.060 --> 03:03:31.300]  I want to punk Obama, you punk.
[03:03:31.300 --> 03:03:37.700]  I think Obama's doing the punking of us.
[03:03:37.700 --> 03:03:38.700]  He already did.
[03:03:38.700 --> 03:03:46.580]  Look how those kids got killed in that school and he wasn't, I mean the tears look like,
[03:03:46.580 --> 03:03:52.260]  you know, just dripping, but if I was a president and the man killed them kids like that, do
[03:03:52.260 --> 03:03:54.340]  you know what I would have did?
[03:03:54.340 --> 03:03:55.340]  Huh?
[03:03:55.340 --> 03:03:56.340]  What?
[03:03:56.340 --> 03:04:00.340]  I would have punked his ass by the balls, right in front of America.
[03:04:00.340 --> 03:04:03.740]  I would have hung them straight up, see what you did?
[03:04:03.740 --> 03:04:09.100]  Now look here, and all the boys there with the fruit rolls in their babies.
[03:04:09.100 --> 03:04:14.620]  Could you imagine coming home, and I got five kids, I sent my kid thinking he's safe in
[03:04:14.620 --> 03:04:15.620]  school.
[03:04:15.620 --> 03:04:20.380]  Well hey, it's the government that advertises the place to go kill people is at a school
[03:04:20.380 --> 03:04:24.460]  and then they take all the guns out and don't let the principals or anybody have guns.
[03:04:24.460 --> 03:04:28.020]  The answer is they have instant access pistol safes that are biometric, you lay your hand
[03:04:28.020 --> 03:04:29.020]  on it and it pops open.
[03:04:29.020 --> 03:04:30.380]  I got them at home.
[03:04:30.380 --> 03:04:35.420]  And I've also got a type of code into it, bam, bam, bam, boom, drawer pops open.
[03:04:35.420 --> 03:04:36.420]  But you know what?
[03:04:36.420 --> 03:04:38.220]  I'm really getting on you now.
[03:04:38.220 --> 03:04:42.580]  I'm on the Alex Jones show now, because what you're saying is true.
[03:04:42.580 --> 03:04:47.860]  Now I'm in Ohio, and I'm born and raised in the Heights, Cleveland Heights.
[03:04:47.860 --> 03:04:50.340]  In Cleveland Heights, you got metal detectors and all that.
[03:04:50.340 --> 03:04:51.980]  Hold on, I want to hear this when we get a break.
[03:04:51.980 --> 03:04:53.540]  All the breaks are at the end of the hour, start of the hour.
[03:04:53.540 --> 03:04:55.500]  She's like, what's going on with all these ads during the break?
[03:04:55.500 --> 03:04:56.580]  It's commercial radio.
[03:04:56.580 --> 03:04:58.640]  Most radio has 16 minutes of ads.
[03:04:58.640 --> 03:04:59.640]  We only have 14.
[03:04:59.640 --> 03:05:00.640]  I'm letting the audience know.
[03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:02.940]  We'll be right back with Obama phone.
[03:05:02.940 --> 03:05:05.180]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:05.180 --> 03:05:11.460]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we
[03:05:11.460 --> 03:05:16.460]  are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.
[03:05:16.460 --> 03:05:22.100]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[03:05:22.100 --> 03:05:23.100]  your help.

[03:05:34.360 --> 03:05:37.820]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:37.820 --> 03:05:44.020]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:44.020 --> 03:05:51.500]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[03:05:51.500 --> 03:05:52.980]  and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:52.980 --> 03:05:55.380]  The war is here.
[03:05:55.380 --> 03:06:04.780]  It's an Infowar, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:04.780 --> 03:06:08.840]  You've come to expect winter specials from Herbal Healer Academy, and we're not going

[03:06:59.180 --> 03:07:03.140]  natural healthcare industry.
[03:07:03.140 --> 03:07:05.380]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[03:07:05.380 --> 03:07:06.380]  Answer this.
[03:07:06.380 --> 03:07:10.580]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into
[03:07:10.580 --> 03:07:15.180]  thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is
[03:07:15.180 --> 03:07:19.460]  recommended by many police departments and sells for less than $35?
[03:07:19.460 --> 03:07:22.060]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[03:07:22.060 --> 03:07:26.420]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S. homes will have a break-in, with burglars usually
[03:07:26.420 --> 03:07:30.880]  picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[03:07:30.880 --> 03:07:35.780]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching
[03:07:35.780 --> 03:07:38.860]  TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[03:07:38.860 --> 03:07:41.860]  It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.
[03:07:41.860 --> 03:07:46.580]  And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure
[03:07:46.580 --> 03:07:48.860]  house or one that's been ransacked.
[03:07:48.860 --> 03:07:54.140]  Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV.
[03:07:54.140 --> 03:07:57.820]  That's 877-532-5388.
[03:07:57.820 --> 03:08:00.060]  Or go to faketv.com.
[03:08:00.060 --> 03:08:02.900]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[03:08:02.900 --> 03:08:13.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, directly from Cleveland, Ohio.
[03:08:13.060 --> 03:08:40.020]  All right, we had a good time last night.
[03:08:40.020 --> 03:08:42.700]  A lot of folks will ask, hey, we've had all this hardcore news.
[03:08:42.700 --> 03:08:43.700]  All this stuff's going on.
[03:08:43.700 --> 03:08:45.060]  Why is the Obama phone lady here?
[03:08:45.060 --> 03:08:47.660]  And some thought, oh, he's gonna get her there and be mean to her.
[03:08:47.660 --> 03:08:49.980]  No, I said, I bet she's a really interesting lady.
[03:08:49.980 --> 03:08:52.380]  I could just tell from that video.
[03:08:52.380 --> 03:08:56.040]  And I wanna try to say, listen, I get that Romney's not good either.
[03:08:56.040 --> 03:08:58.800]  But let's just admit Obama doesn't care about us.
[03:08:58.800 --> 03:09:02.860]  Let's just admit he's bought and paid for by a corrupt special interest.
[03:09:02.860 --> 03:09:06.340]  Let's just admit they're trying to divide and conquer us.
[03:09:06.340 --> 03:09:09.840]  And while we've been sitting here, I've been convincing you on the Second Amendment.
[03:09:09.840 --> 03:09:11.420]  I've been convincing you on a bunch of other stuff.
[03:09:11.420 --> 03:09:14.420]  And you were saying before the break, and we're going back to calls and Twitter questions
[03:09:14.420 --> 03:09:15.420]  here.
[03:09:15.420 --> 03:09:18.460]  And again, if you don't know who she is, folks, you know the thing about Obama.
[03:09:18.460 --> 03:09:20.580]  I'm an Obama phone lady.
[03:09:20.580 --> 03:09:23.100]  He gave us, well, repeat yourself there so they know who you are.
[03:09:23.100 --> 03:09:24.100]  I'm an Obama phone lady.
[03:09:24.100 --> 03:09:27.380]  He gave us a phone and he's gonna do more.
[03:09:27.380 --> 03:09:30.380]  And now you're saying the government should actually only tax us to give us M-16s.
[03:09:30.380 --> 03:09:33.900]  Oh, he should give me a gun and some grenades.
[03:09:33.900 --> 03:09:38.140]  You know, you taking it away, but we need our force here too.
[03:09:38.140 --> 03:09:40.180]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:09:40.180 --> 03:09:42.620]  No, but seriously, you wanted to say something about the Second Amendment.
[03:09:42.620 --> 03:09:47.500]  I was pointing out that they've made the schools victim disarmament zones, then they advertise
[03:09:47.500 --> 03:09:48.500]  for crazy people.
[03:09:48.500 --> 03:09:49.660]  Hey, don't just kill yourself.
[03:09:49.660 --> 03:09:52.160]  The option is going down to a school and do it.
[03:09:52.160 --> 03:09:54.500]  That's what the real tough guys do.
[03:09:54.500 --> 03:09:58.860]  I think that sucks because here we is, I got kids.
[03:09:58.860 --> 03:10:02.060]  I put my kids in school and the first thing I think they're safe.
[03:10:02.060 --> 03:10:03.660]  They're at school.
[03:10:03.660 --> 03:10:06.520]  When I was growing up, they didn't have all this going on.
[03:10:06.520 --> 03:10:11.940]  And I'm really believing you, the government, you gotta have control of it.
[03:10:11.940 --> 03:10:15.820]  You know, that guy killed those kids in that school just recently.
[03:10:15.820 --> 03:10:20.380]  If I was the president, I would put him on a bus and put his whole body up there, hung
[03:10:20.380 --> 03:10:23.380]  him upside down, straight out.
[03:10:23.380 --> 03:10:24.380]  And they're gonna do it.
[03:10:24.380 --> 03:10:28.180]  He's gonna do it in jail and they're gonna take 15 years to give them time and just sit
[03:10:28.180 --> 03:10:29.180]  and rot.
[03:10:29.180 --> 03:10:30.300]  I'm gonna rot all right.
[03:10:30.300 --> 03:10:32.220]  Killed those innocent kids.
[03:10:32.220 --> 03:10:34.340]  But see, they use that and dangle them out in front of us.
[03:10:34.340 --> 03:10:37.340]  And meanwhile, the president signs weekly the death orders where they'll blow up a whole
[03:10:37.340 --> 03:10:41.340]  apartment building or a whole village or a whole wedding to get one guy who hadn't even
[03:10:41.340 --> 03:10:45.660]  been convicted, illegally bombing another country and they blow those little kids arms
[03:10:45.660 --> 03:10:46.660]  and legs off.
[03:10:46.660 --> 03:10:47.940]  And Obama didn't cry about that.
[03:10:47.940 --> 03:10:49.340]  My point is that they're cold blooded.
[03:10:49.340 --> 03:10:53.780]  Did you know our government runs Al Qaeda in Libya and Syria now publicly?
[03:10:53.780 --> 03:10:56.900]  And Obama went in and murdered Gaddafi.
[03:10:56.900 --> 03:11:00.420]  And again, he wasn't a perfect guy, but compared to Al Qaeda, he'd been friends with the West
[03:11:00.420 --> 03:11:01.420]  for about a decade.
[03:11:01.420 --> 03:11:02.420]  You know, Gaddafi was-
[03:11:02.420 --> 03:11:07.060]  I believe that, I believe he just did that to get where he got, where he's at.
[03:11:07.060 --> 03:11:09.980]  He did that to talk to the people just like when I did.
[03:11:09.980 --> 03:11:14.620]  I didn't know what Alex Jones teaching me about what's on TV.
[03:11:14.620 --> 03:11:15.940]  But I seen it with my own eyes.
[03:11:15.940 --> 03:11:18.700]  You pulled it up on YouTube or the TV thing.
[03:11:18.700 --> 03:11:19.700]  Obama line?
[03:11:19.700 --> 03:11:20.700]  Right, and it came up.
[03:11:20.700 --> 03:11:23.620]  That was Obama saying what he won't do with the taxes.
[03:11:23.620 --> 03:11:28.420]  Here I am just got a job as a maid and my first check is eating me to taxes, eating
[03:11:28.420 --> 03:11:30.460]  the hell out of me.
[03:11:30.460 --> 03:11:31.460]  First check.
[03:11:31.460 --> 03:11:32.460]  It's going up.
[03:11:32.460 --> 03:11:33.460]  It's going up.
[03:11:33.460 --> 03:11:34.460]  But-
[03:11:34.460 --> 03:11:35.460]  He said he wouldn't do that.
[03:11:35.460 --> 03:11:38.140]  I seen it right here on your show, Alex Jones' show.
[03:11:38.140 --> 03:11:39.820]  He said he wouldn't take the taxes.
[03:11:39.820 --> 03:11:44.980]  But exactly, but just 20 years ago, if a president did that, they got run out on a rail.
[03:11:44.980 --> 03:11:45.980]  Right.
[03:11:45.980 --> 03:11:47.980]  There's some, you want to cover some code for you, honey?
[03:11:47.980 --> 03:11:49.060]  You bet.
[03:11:49.060 --> 03:11:50.060]  And let's go to calls.
[03:11:50.060 --> 03:11:51.060]  I'm going to quit hogging her here.
[03:11:51.060 --> 03:11:52.060]  This is-
[03:11:52.060 --> 03:11:53.060]  Yeah, let's call some calls.
[03:11:53.060 --> 03:11:54.060]  Let's go to Mike in Tennessee.
[03:11:54.060 --> 03:11:57.540]  You're on the air listing on 1600 WMQM.
[03:11:57.540 --> 03:11:58.540]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:11:58.540 --> 03:12:00.540]  Good afternoon, Alex and Michelle.
[03:12:00.540 --> 03:12:06.380]  First, I just real quickly want to say, Michelle, if you haven't seen the Obama deception documentary,
[03:12:06.380 --> 03:12:11.900]  I highly recommend that Alex gets you a copy of that as well as all of his other documentaries,
[03:12:11.900 --> 03:12:16.620]  a year subscription to his magazine, as well as access to InfoWars TV that she can view
[03:12:16.620 --> 03:12:20.020]  from any computer anywhere, including the public libraries.
[03:12:20.020 --> 03:12:21.020]  Absolutely.
[03:12:21.020 --> 03:12:25.020]  In fact, you see that magazine there, that was the December issue that we finished the
[03:12:25.020 --> 03:12:26.460]  last week of November.
[03:12:26.460 --> 03:12:30.320]  It says this man wants your guns and it says he's going to use executive orders to come
[03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:31.320]  after our guns.
[03:12:31.320 --> 03:12:32.320]  How do you think I knew that?
[03:12:32.320 --> 03:12:34.180]  Because I'm not smart.
[03:12:34.180 --> 03:12:35.580]  They told us they would do all this.
[03:12:35.580 --> 03:12:36.580]  They said that.
[03:12:36.580 --> 03:12:41.260]  I've just seen them said it on the TV and Alex Jones show that he wouldn't raise our
[03:12:41.260 --> 03:12:42.260]  taxes.
[03:12:42.260 --> 03:12:45.420]  Exactly, but back then it was only in policy reports.
[03:12:45.420 --> 03:12:50.580]  See, they're in policy reports like we don't even exist because they know the paid off
[03:12:50.580 --> 03:12:53.780]  media will never go show their real plans.
[03:12:53.780 --> 03:12:55.660]  So see, that's why I get so mad.
[03:12:55.660 --> 03:12:59.740]  I know their whole plan because they wrote it down.
[03:12:59.740 --> 03:13:01.460]  This is not rocket science.
[03:13:01.460 --> 03:13:03.780]  I know what I'm talking about because they told me.
[03:13:03.780 --> 03:13:05.300]  It's like a confession letter.
[03:13:05.300 --> 03:13:09.500]  It's like a killer who videotapes themselves chopping up some kid and I've got the video
[03:13:09.500 --> 03:13:10.500]  and I'm like, look, he did it.
[03:13:10.500 --> 03:13:11.500]  Here's the video.
[03:13:11.500 --> 03:13:12.980]  Oh, shut up, conspiracy theorist.
[03:13:12.980 --> 03:13:13.980]  I'm sorry.
[03:13:13.980 --> 03:13:14.980]  Go ahead.
[03:13:14.980 --> 03:13:15.980]  Anything else, Mike?
[03:13:15.980 --> 03:13:21.780]  Michelle, I'm 51 and I grew up in Memphis, Tennessee and I grew up in a neighborhood
[03:13:21.780 --> 03:13:25.740]  that had black fathers and white fathers that went to work.
[03:13:25.740 --> 03:13:29.660]  Some were carpenters, some were dentists, some were trash men.
[03:13:29.660 --> 03:13:33.780]  They came home every night to a house with a wife who'd beat the fool out of the young
[03:13:33.780 --> 03:13:37.740]  boys if they got out of line and if they were at the neighbor's home, the neighbor's mom
[03:13:37.740 --> 03:13:39.980]  would get a hold of you, call your mother.
[03:13:39.980 --> 03:13:43.260]  When you got home, she would get you and when dad got home, it was all over.
[03:13:43.260 --> 03:13:47.420]  The way they stole your birthright was they took the fathers out of the home, replaced
[03:13:47.420 --> 03:13:51.420]  them with a welfare check and they- Hallelujah, hallelujah.
[03:13:51.420 --> 03:13:52.420]  You're exactly right.
[03:13:52.420 --> 03:13:56.820]  And by the way, Margaret Sanger said, we're going to get these black weeds.
[03:13:56.820 --> 03:13:57.820]  This is a quote.
[03:13:57.820 --> 03:14:01.260]  We're going to pay off black leaders and we're going to break up their families and we're
[03:14:01.260 --> 03:14:05.020]  going to get them dependent and we're going to chop them up, okay?
[03:14:05.020 --> 03:14:06.860]  And that's what goes on.
[03:14:06.860 --> 03:14:10.260]  And what they've done, like Tony Brown says in Tony Brown's journal on PBS, what they've
[03:14:10.260 --> 03:14:12.320]  done to the black community is the model for everybody.
[03:14:12.320 --> 03:14:17.300]  They just went after you because people would say, well, they don't have rights because
[03:14:17.300 --> 03:14:19.940]  they use prejudice to hit you from both sides.
[03:14:19.940 --> 03:14:24.580]  The open prejudice, but then the fake liberals, that's their plan.
[03:14:24.580 --> 03:14:29.820]  And so my whole point is, is that they've gone from 10% illegitimacy to 90 plus percent
[03:14:29.820 --> 03:14:30.820]  illegitimacy.
[03:14:30.820 --> 03:14:34.620]  And Dr. Spock in those books, they said, don't spank your kids.
[03:14:34.620 --> 03:14:36.660]  They said, let your kids do what they want.
[03:14:36.660 --> 03:14:38.860]  So they'll be out of control.
[03:14:38.860 --> 03:14:42.020]  So now they get tasered and shot by the cops.
[03:14:42.020 --> 03:14:48.220]  Now their father figure is a big fat fake gangster, like Freeway Ricky Ross, not the
[03:14:48.220 --> 03:14:49.740]  real Freeway Ricky.
[03:14:49.740 --> 03:14:52.780]  Rick Ross, the fake guy, not even a real gangster.
[03:14:52.780 --> 03:14:55.140]  By the way, he runs and hides from real gangsters.
[03:14:55.140 --> 03:14:59.040]  He's up there saying the tough thing to do, kill, steal, do all this.
[03:14:59.040 --> 03:15:00.740]  People think that's what we're supposed to do.
[03:15:00.740 --> 03:15:05.660]  You basically put on a gangster uniform for the cops now to alert who are trained on you.
[03:15:05.660 --> 03:15:07.680]  They're like attack dogs trained to get a rabbit.
[03:15:07.680 --> 03:15:12.220]  You put on a rabbit's uniform to be sent to a prison where they then put everybody racially
[03:15:12.220 --> 03:15:16.680]  in their gangs to create a race system of divide and conquer.
[03:15:16.680 --> 03:15:21.460]  The real colleges in America are the prisons designed, what this guy's saying right here,
[03:15:21.460 --> 03:15:24.660]  to destroy the birthright, to destroy the father.
[03:15:24.660 --> 03:15:27.760]  And they've now done it, and they're doing it to everybody.
[03:15:27.760 --> 03:15:29.320]  And that's what Obama's there to do.
[03:15:29.320 --> 03:15:34.220]  You know Obama got all the money increased to make sure they abort more people.
[03:15:34.220 --> 03:15:35.900]  And folks say, well, look how bad the communities are.
[03:15:35.900 --> 03:15:37.000]  Let's abort these people.
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:38.300]  See how they've sold us on that?
[03:15:38.300 --> 03:15:41.180]  He says, hey, let's kill people.
[03:15:41.180 --> 03:15:44.340]  Because if we kill an old lady and don't give her healthcare, we can hire teachers.
[03:15:44.340 --> 03:15:48.300]  Now we've got the idea of killing people to get a job, when all we ever needed was liberty
[03:15:48.300 --> 03:15:51.340]  and freedom and self-sufficiency.
[03:15:51.340 --> 03:15:53.760]  But now we've had the self-sufficiency destroyed.
[03:15:53.760 --> 03:15:56.560]  Now they've got us right where they want us, Michelle.
[03:15:56.560 --> 03:15:57.560]  They think they do.
[03:15:57.560 --> 03:15:58.620]  Anything else, caller?
[03:15:58.620 --> 03:16:00.180]  You're laying out the genius here.
[03:16:00.180 --> 03:16:01.180]  Mike.
[03:16:01.180 --> 03:16:06.020]  Their biggest fear is independence and people taking individual responsibility.
[03:16:06.020 --> 03:16:10.900]  And once you give up the Obama phone bobble, you take back your rightful place as a sovereign
[03:16:10.900 --> 03:16:14.300]  human being, a child of God, they lose.
[03:16:14.300 --> 03:16:15.940]  Right, they lose.
[03:16:15.940 --> 03:16:16.940]  That's right.
[03:16:16.940 --> 03:16:23.860]  Remember, the slicker devil, I mean Mitt Romney's trying to talk to mainline, middle class people,
[03:16:23.860 --> 03:16:24.860]  whatever color they are.
[03:16:24.860 --> 03:16:26.660]  He's like, I don't care about 47%.
[03:16:26.660 --> 03:16:27.660]  They're gonna do whatever.
[03:16:27.660 --> 03:16:30.980]  He goes, I'll keep your taxes low.
[03:16:30.980 --> 03:16:32.840]  But his plan was to raise them too.
[03:16:32.840 --> 03:16:36.560]  He's there to con the middle class and the white people and the wealthy black folks and
[03:16:36.560 --> 03:16:41.380]  all the people that have made some money, okay, that get the government in their friend.
[03:16:41.380 --> 03:16:45.860]  But just he'll tell them what they wanna hear, and then they can put Obama in and say it's
[03:16:45.860 --> 03:16:50.180]  a defeat for the ideas Mitt Romney put out that weren't his real plans.
[03:16:50.180 --> 03:16:51.180]  Right.
[03:16:51.180 --> 03:16:55.680]  You see, it wasn't just rigged in getting Obama in, okay?
[03:16:55.680 --> 03:17:00.000]  It was rigged in that they ran somebody who was a phony up against him to begin with.
[03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:02.780]  Because they want you to believe in the system.
[03:17:02.780 --> 03:17:06.140]  Cuz it's not enough for them to distill your future.
[03:17:06.140 --> 03:17:07.660]  They want you to beg for it.
[03:17:07.660 --> 03:17:08.660]  You understand that?
[03:17:08.660 --> 03:17:09.660]  Right, right, right.
[03:17:09.660 --> 03:17:10.660]  I do believe that.
[03:17:10.660 --> 03:17:12.220]  Cuz it's free will universe.
[03:17:12.220 --> 03:17:13.220]  Right.
[03:17:13.220 --> 03:17:16.380]  And I'm not trying to preach at you, but I wanted to get you here because I could tell
[03:17:16.380 --> 03:17:17.380]  you were an interesting lady.
[03:17:17.380 --> 03:17:18.380]  Right.
[03:17:18.380 --> 03:17:20.620]  And I really wanted to communicate with you at point blank range.
[03:17:20.620 --> 03:17:21.860]  And I'm glad you did.
[03:17:21.860 --> 03:17:22.860]  Sir, good points.
[03:17:22.860 --> 03:17:24.700]  Let's get another caller here in overdrive.
[03:17:24.700 --> 03:17:27.340]  We're gonna skip this network break coming up.
[03:17:27.340 --> 03:17:28.980]  Key in New York, you're on the air.
[03:17:28.980 --> 03:17:29.980]  Go ahead.
[03:17:29.980 --> 03:17:32.660]  Hey, how are you doing, Michelle?
[03:17:32.660 --> 03:17:33.660]  Hey, how are you?
[03:17:33.660 --> 03:17:34.660]  Doing good.
[03:17:34.660 --> 03:17:36.100]  What's going on, Alex?
[03:17:36.100 --> 03:17:37.500]  Worldwide broadcast, my friend.
[03:17:37.500 --> 03:17:38.500]  What's on your mind?
[03:17:38.500 --> 03:17:40.500]  Yo, you know something, Michelle?
[03:17:40.500 --> 03:17:43.620]  The only reason why you're there is to be clowned.
[03:17:43.620 --> 03:17:45.820]  That's the only reason why you're there.
[03:17:45.820 --> 03:17:53.780]  Before you got there, they played that soundbite of yours over and over and over again to clown
[03:17:53.780 --> 03:17:54.780]  you.
[03:17:54.780 --> 03:18:00.260]  And the reason why he's trying to get you to say things is because he needs audio so
[03:18:00.260 --> 03:18:03.940]  that he can play that back and clown you again when you leave.
[03:18:03.940 --> 03:18:08.260]  Now, hold on just a second, Key.
[03:18:08.260 --> 03:18:09.260]  Ain't nobody gonna-
[03:18:09.260 --> 03:18:10.260]  No, no, but hold on.
[03:18:10.260 --> 03:18:15.460]  When we called her, and when she got off the plane, I said, I think it's funny.
[03:18:15.460 --> 03:18:19.540]  And we did make jokes about it because it's funny, but it's also sad.
[03:18:19.540 --> 03:18:23.960]  And I said that at the time we aired it, if you go back to the first times we aired it,
[03:18:23.960 --> 03:18:29.420]  and I said I thought she was an interesting lady and was talented and funny.
[03:18:29.420 --> 03:18:31.460]  And I've said, I bet that lady's a character.
[03:18:31.460 --> 03:18:35.820]  So we've got her here, and I clown around some too.
[03:18:35.820 --> 03:18:42.460]  So all I'm saying is don't misrepresent what I actually stand for and what I believe in.
[03:18:42.460 --> 03:18:48.700]  I mean, it is horrible that they're trying to domesticate us, and I'm here actually trying
[03:18:48.700 --> 03:18:52.740]  to reach out to her to try to explain to her why we need a Second Amendment and things
[03:18:52.740 --> 03:18:54.860]  like that, okay?
[03:18:54.860 --> 03:18:58.920]  And obviously, I said I want that lady on the show months ago, and then I made kind
[03:18:58.920 --> 03:19:02.260]  of a joke about it saying, okay, a bounty to get her on if somebody can find her.
[03:19:02.260 --> 03:19:03.260]  And we got her on.
[03:19:03.260 --> 03:19:05.340]  Is this not interesting radio, sir?
[03:19:05.340 --> 03:19:10.820]  No, he's a chronic clown, and I can prove it to you that he isn't what he purports to
[03:19:10.820 --> 03:19:11.820]  be.
[03:19:11.820 --> 03:19:12.820]  You call him Obama, punk.
[03:19:12.820 --> 03:19:13.820]  Well, check this out.
[03:19:13.820 --> 03:19:14.820]  Alex said that you had 1776 all in Piers Morgan's space.
[03:19:14.820 --> 03:19:15.820]  Oh, you're not going to take our guns because this is going to happen.
[03:19:15.820 --> 03:19:30.820]  All of a sudden, Alex said if the ATF shows up at his house, he's not going to shoot back.
[03:19:30.820 --> 03:19:36.060]  But the Ruby Ritz cats, they went for this.
[03:19:36.060 --> 03:19:40.100]  Now they died, but they did what they said they were going to do.
[03:19:40.100 --> 03:19:45.660]  But Alex said no, he's just driving to his knees.
[03:19:45.660 --> 03:19:46.660]  You know what?
[03:19:46.660 --> 03:19:47.660]  You know what?
[03:19:47.660 --> 03:19:55.780]  You're wrong, and I appreciate your call, and I am here on the front lines trying to
[03:19:55.780 --> 03:20:00.720]  peacefully cause a cultural revolution 1776 worldwide.
[03:20:00.720 --> 03:20:06.340]  And I know that they want to come set me up, and so I've always said the same thing.
[03:20:06.340 --> 03:20:10.380]  If you come for the guns, it's going to cause a revolution.
[03:20:10.380 --> 03:20:13.300]  But I'm not going to give them an excuse before that happens.
[03:20:13.300 --> 03:20:16.460]  A, I want to stop it, and I've been clear about that.
[03:20:16.460 --> 03:20:22.700]  B, I am trying to fix things peacefully, and I'm not going to give them the excuse.
[03:20:22.700 --> 03:20:25.940]  I have said I'm not turning my guns in, period.
[03:20:25.940 --> 03:20:28.880]  I don't care what phony executive orders they do.
[03:20:28.880 --> 03:20:32.500]  But I've also said that I'm not going to open the door for them, that if they do come to
[03:20:32.500 --> 03:20:36.460]  my house and kill me, to sit there and have me shooting my mouth off, that I'm going to
[03:20:36.460 --> 03:20:38.140]  do this and that to the cops.
[03:20:38.140 --> 03:20:41.520]  If they do come and kill me, it'll be in cold blood, and I'll be a martyr.
[03:20:41.520 --> 03:20:42.520]  That's the opposite.
[03:20:42.520 --> 03:20:44.780]  I mean, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:20:44.780 --> 03:20:46.780]  On the air, I don't have bodyguards.
[03:20:46.780 --> 03:20:48.220]  I go out and do all this.
[03:20:48.220 --> 03:20:52.580]  I deal with this, and you're calling up saying that basically I'm a coward.
[03:20:52.580 --> 03:20:55.420]  And anyone listening knows that that's not the case.
[03:20:55.420 --> 03:20:59.260]  I mean, I march into the lion's den and get in people's face.
[03:20:59.260 --> 03:21:04.260]  And I mean, it's just amazing, instead of just making fun of this lady from afar, I
[03:21:04.260 --> 03:21:05.260]  got her.
[03:21:05.260 --> 03:21:06.260]  Did I not tell you last night?
[03:21:06.260 --> 03:21:07.740]  What did I tell you when you got off the plane?
[03:21:07.740 --> 03:21:09.180]  Well, it's not about what you said.
[03:21:09.180 --> 03:21:12.180]  I've been did it before I got to the Alex Jones show.
[03:21:12.180 --> 03:21:18.580]  I even had my TV show in Cleveland, Ohio, Channel 19, and I turned them down.
[03:21:18.580 --> 03:21:23.260]  But one thing about it, and two for show, if you see it with your own eyes and then
[03:21:23.260 --> 03:21:25.740]  you know what you did, you know it's a game.
[03:21:25.740 --> 03:21:29.220]  He did that probably to get me out there to get the voters to vote for him.
[03:21:29.220 --> 03:21:32.940]  No, I know, but I mean, obviously, it's hilarious.
[03:21:32.940 --> 03:21:33.940]  I mean, I'm-
[03:21:33.940 --> 03:21:35.700]  I mean, I think it's funny because it's-
[03:21:35.700 --> 03:21:39.620]  But I mean, I said on air, I said you could do voiceovers.
[03:21:39.620 --> 03:21:40.620]  I mean, that's like a-
[03:21:40.620 --> 03:21:41.620]  I could be a comedian.
[03:21:41.620 --> 03:21:42.620]  That's like a Muppet character.
[03:21:42.620 --> 03:21:44.100]  I mean, I'm gonna be honest with you, right?
[03:21:44.100 --> 03:21:45.820]  I'm telling you where your talents are.
[03:21:45.820 --> 03:21:48.420]  When you get upset and talk, I mean, it sounds like a Muppet.
[03:21:48.420 --> 03:21:52.060]  I mean, you could go make money as a Muppet.
[03:21:52.060 --> 03:21:53.060]  Okay.
[03:21:53.060 --> 03:21:54.060]  You could play with that.
[03:21:54.060 --> 03:21:58.500]  Well, but listen, the point is I do, the thing is I do Marvin the Martian voices.
[03:21:58.500 --> 03:21:59.500]  Right.
[03:21:59.500 --> 03:22:00.500]  I can do Muppet voices.
[03:22:00.500 --> 03:22:03.340]  I mean, I'm saying, I said at the time, that's an interesting lady.
[03:22:03.340 --> 03:22:07.560]  There's plenty of people on the news saying I want Obama in cuz I want free stuff.
[03:22:07.560 --> 03:22:09.100]  We played like 10 clips of that.
[03:22:09.100 --> 03:22:13.380]  None of those got 20 million views because they didn't have that spark.
[03:22:13.380 --> 03:22:14.380]  That's the spark.
[03:22:14.380 --> 03:22:22.740]  And everybody told me, even when I got on YouTube, first thing they said, wow, you were
[03:22:22.740 --> 03:22:23.740]  so funny.
[03:22:23.740 --> 03:22:24.740]  The way you said it.
[03:22:24.740 --> 03:22:28.580]  Tell me your phone and you can do more.
[03:22:28.580 --> 03:22:32.780]  You know, that was- But didn't I tell you that I thought it was
[03:22:32.780 --> 03:22:34.260]  funny and that I disagreed with it?
[03:22:34.260 --> 03:22:35.260]  Oh, yeah.
[03:22:35.260 --> 03:22:36.780]  And I told John to tell you that on the phone.
[03:22:36.780 --> 03:22:39.300]  Well, see, when I- What did we tell you about getting the, I mean, we were honest about
[03:22:39.300 --> 03:22:40.300]  it.
[03:22:40.300 --> 03:22:41.300]  Right.
[03:22:41.300 --> 03:22:43.980]  The point is my attacker is always obsessed on saying, I'm not bona fide.
[03:22:43.980 --> 03:22:45.060]  I'm not real.
[03:22:45.060 --> 03:22:46.420]  I'm disingenuous.
[03:22:46.420 --> 03:22:51.020]  When it's the opposite- It's real as an Alex Jones show.
[03:22:51.020 --> 03:22:52.020]  You're real?
[03:22:52.020 --> 03:22:53.300]  Well, that's what I like is things that are real.
[03:22:53.300 --> 03:22:58.700]  Then if you don't know a man like you showed me sitting in his office-
[03:22:58.700 --> 03:22:59.700]  Well, exactly.
[03:22:59.700 --> 03:23:02.740]  And I mean- They wasn't going to raise and cut my tax.
[03:23:02.740 --> 03:23:04.460]  You know why you're here?
[03:23:04.460 --> 03:23:10.300]  Because when I'm at literally having Thanksgiving or Christmas, we're sitting around talking
[03:23:10.300 --> 03:23:11.300]  about you.
[03:23:11.300 --> 03:23:12.300]  Uh-huh.
[03:23:12.300 --> 03:23:14.060]  And everybody- I'm the only one.
[03:23:14.060 --> 03:23:15.900]  Everybody's talking about the bomber phone lady.
[03:23:15.900 --> 03:23:17.100]  That's why I'm- I know.
[03:23:17.100 --> 03:23:19.780]  So the guy's trying to make it some evil thing to get you here.
[03:23:19.780 --> 03:23:20.780]  A lot of people is.
[03:23:20.780 --> 03:23:23.060]  A lot of people saying, I showed my butt doing this.
[03:23:23.060 --> 03:23:24.940]  Well, the point is, is that so what?
[03:23:24.940 --> 03:23:25.940]  You were in the arena.
[03:23:25.940 --> 03:23:26.940]  Wait a minute.
[03:23:26.940 --> 03:23:27.940]  You were on the field.
[03:23:27.940 --> 03:23:34.940]  If I die tomorrow, my grandkids can go on YouTube and say, my granny did something on
[03:23:34.940 --> 03:23:36.780]  YouTube, Obama phone lady.
[03:23:36.780 --> 03:23:38.140]  Well, let me be clear too.
[03:23:38.140 --> 03:23:43.300]  I don't- The family I come from, my family's all like, you better be nice to that lady.
[03:23:43.300 --> 03:23:44.300]  And I'm like, how dare you?
[03:23:44.300 --> 03:23:46.220]  You heard me on the phone with my wife last night.
[03:23:46.220 --> 03:23:47.220]  Right.
[03:23:47.220 --> 03:23:49.340]  Don't say I'm on purpose trying to be mean to her.
[03:23:49.340 --> 03:23:53.380]  I mean, I said, obviously, obviously, I don't agree with what they've done.
[03:23:53.380 --> 03:23:55.820]  I don't agree with getting free Obama phones.
[03:23:55.820 --> 03:23:58.060]  It's selling our souls so cheaply.
[03:23:58.060 --> 03:24:00.480]  I'm here telling you honestly, I think this is horrible.
[03:24:00.480 --> 03:24:02.740]  And you're here understanding what I'm saying.
[03:24:02.740 --> 03:24:05.580]  And we're trying to figure out ways for- But you just said it-
[03:24:05.580 --> 03:24:08.420]  I fight as hard as I can to try to keep jobs in this country.
[03:24:08.420 --> 03:24:13.300]  I've napped in- Well, just now you showed that clipping of- and that's so true.
[03:24:13.300 --> 03:24:19.380]  Looks like he just showed us how we get a, what you call it, Happy Meal, a cheeseburger
[03:24:19.380 --> 03:24:20.380]  and a fry.
[03:24:20.380 --> 03:24:23.620]  I'm black, low clap, low po.
[03:24:23.620 --> 03:24:24.620]  Obama lady.
[03:24:24.620 --> 03:24:30.180]  Instead of buying a Happy Meal, a cheeseburger and a fry for two bucks, that toy that probably
[03:24:30.180 --> 03:24:36.540]  get a million of them, pay one price, throw it in the bag, and the kid is happy.
[03:24:36.540 --> 03:24:37.540]  That's example.
[03:24:37.540 --> 03:24:39.180]  Same thing for me.
[03:24:39.180 --> 03:24:44.660]  They threw me a Obama phone, and more than us, there's so many minorities that I helped
[03:24:44.660 --> 03:24:50.180]  sign up to vote for Obama about that Obama phone, that they didn't even come from Obama.
[03:24:50.180 --> 03:24:55.420]  So I made myself look stupid because when I was canvassing, they didn't tell me about
[03:24:55.420 --> 03:24:56.420]  the Obama phone.
[03:24:56.420 --> 03:25:01.780]  If I never went to a canvas for Obama, first thing everybody I know say, they call him
[03:25:01.780 --> 03:25:03.020]  Obama phone.
[03:25:03.020 --> 03:25:04.020]  Exactly.
[03:25:04.020 --> 03:25:07.460]  What they want is they want to get everybody on the dole so these big mega banks can skim
[03:25:07.460 --> 03:25:09.620]  and decide where the contracts go.
[03:25:09.620 --> 03:25:10.900]  It's all mafia.
[03:25:10.900 --> 03:25:12.660]  Let me go over some of these questions and people are gonna kill me.
[03:25:12.660 --> 03:25:14.300]  I've got a whole, where do they go?
[03:25:14.300 --> 03:25:15.300]  Here they are.
[03:25:15.300 --> 03:25:18.260]  These are Twitter questions from real Alex Jones.
[03:25:18.260 --> 03:25:21.820]  Why and what made you go on the Alex Jones show?
[03:25:21.820 --> 03:25:24.380]  Why did you say no to the other shows, but you said yes to ours?
[03:25:24.380 --> 03:25:30.480]  Well for one, I said yes to Alex Jones show because when you called me and talked to me,
[03:25:30.480 --> 03:25:33.900]  there was a man that approached, excuse me, approached me.
[03:25:33.900 --> 03:25:39.980]  So you had already been looking for me and here I am in Cleveland and you're in Texas.
[03:25:39.980 --> 03:25:44.260]  They was right there in Cleveland looking for me and no one came to me like you did
[03:25:44.260 --> 03:25:45.260]  Alex Jones.
[03:25:45.260 --> 03:25:49.660]  And I don't care how stupid the video look or whatever they said about the video.
[03:25:49.660 --> 03:25:54.540]  You was the first one made me feel welcome and to learn more about what's going on.
[03:25:54.540 --> 03:25:56.180]  Well the thing is you're a real person.
[03:25:56.180 --> 03:25:57.820]  You're funny, you're talented.
[03:25:57.820 --> 03:25:58.820]  You have that pizazz.
[03:25:58.820 --> 03:26:01.740]  But yeah, it's horrible what's happening, how they're buying us off with this stuff
[03:26:01.740 --> 03:26:05.100]  and trying to make us dependent where there are no jobs, so you got to go on welfare.
[03:26:05.100 --> 03:26:06.100]  This is all we talk about.
[03:26:06.100 --> 03:26:10.900]  I mean, here I am talking about let's not let the eugenicists target black people.
[03:26:10.900 --> 03:26:15.060]  And this guy calls up and says, you're clowning this lady.
[03:26:15.060 --> 03:26:16.220]  And obviously we're all-
[03:26:16.220 --> 03:26:19.660]  But I wanted to say what I really wanted to tell him and you wouldn't let me tell him.
[03:26:19.660 --> 03:26:20.660]  What was that?
[03:26:20.660 --> 03:26:21.660]  Go ahead.
[03:26:21.660 --> 03:26:25.780]  Well if he wanted to clown me, but you got to also look at it is same thing they did
[03:26:25.780 --> 03:26:29.820]  it to get his votes and like you did about the bag they threw the toy in.
[03:26:29.820 --> 03:26:30.820]  We're all getting clowned.
[03:26:30.820 --> 03:26:32.180]  We're all getting clowned.
[03:26:32.180 --> 03:26:35.820]  I'm the Obama phone lady and if I got clowned by that, guess what?
[03:26:35.820 --> 03:26:38.700]  I'm going to get what I need to get through.
[03:26:38.700 --> 03:26:39.700]  That's the main thing.
[03:26:39.700 --> 03:26:41.540]  And to know the right from the wrong-
[03:26:41.540 --> 03:26:43.940]  Only people that don't get clowned are folks that don't ever do anything.
[03:26:43.940 --> 03:26:44.940]  Right.
[03:26:44.940 --> 03:26:45.940]  And see, I do a lot.
[03:26:45.940 --> 03:26:46.940]  I'm right now.
[03:26:46.940 --> 03:26:50.500]  Like I said, I'm a single parent with five kids.
[03:26:50.500 --> 03:26:52.580]  I do a lot and I need to get through a lot.
[03:26:52.580 --> 03:26:55.220]  I'm 47 years old, how long we last?
[03:26:55.220 --> 03:26:57.400]  We don't last long.
[03:26:57.400 --> 03:27:01.420]  And I don't care what you said about that call because whatever it took on you two,
[03:27:01.420 --> 03:27:02.420]  you seen it.
[03:27:02.420 --> 03:27:04.260]  And if I look like that much of a fool, where you at?
[03:27:04.260 --> 03:27:05.660]  You're a fool with me.
[03:27:05.660 --> 03:27:09.860]  But again, there's lots of people begging for, you know, saying I got this free thing.
[03:27:09.860 --> 03:27:10.980]  Those didn't get popular.
[03:27:10.980 --> 03:27:11.980]  It's because it's funny.
[03:27:11.980 --> 03:27:14.180]  Here, here, and it's funny because the way you deliver it.
[03:27:14.180 --> 03:27:15.180]  Now there's another one.
[03:27:15.180 --> 03:27:17.940]  Why do you think he's paying for that phone?
[03:27:17.940 --> 03:27:21.060]  Do you think it's fair that they take money from somebody else?
[03:27:21.060 --> 03:27:22.060]  No, I don't.
[03:27:22.060 --> 03:27:26.100]  They could have used that money to give me a gun and a grenade to help save my soul.
[03:27:26.100 --> 03:27:29.300]  If it wasn't for me, it'd blow me down.
[03:27:29.300 --> 03:27:30.940]  The Obama phone, lady.
[03:27:30.940 --> 03:27:32.980]  Here's something else.
[03:27:32.980 --> 03:27:33.980]  Oh my gosh.
[03:27:33.980 --> 03:27:35.180]  You got to be like that.
[03:27:35.180 --> 03:27:37.740]  You see how that caller just did us?
[03:27:37.740 --> 03:27:38.740]  Here's that same question.
[03:27:38.740 --> 03:27:39.740]  Do you want a free firearm?
[03:27:39.740 --> 03:27:40.900]  I hadn't even read these yet.
[03:27:40.900 --> 03:27:44.140]  How do you feel about the tax increases on more than 77 percent of Americans?
[03:27:44.140 --> 03:27:45.460]  We already talked about that.
[03:27:45.460 --> 03:27:48.860]  Why are you, who are you going to vote for in 2016?
[03:27:48.860 --> 03:27:50.420]  It darn sure won't be Obama.
[03:27:50.420 --> 03:27:51.420]  I don't know.
[03:27:51.420 --> 03:27:53.460]  They're talking about a third term for him.
[03:27:53.460 --> 03:27:55.020]  Well, I don't think he's going to last that long.
[03:27:55.020 --> 03:27:57.500]  I mean, Rahm Emanuel says we don't even need voters anymore.
[03:27:57.500 --> 03:27:58.500]  Right.
[03:27:58.500 --> 03:27:59.500]  We just, the police will now run things.
[03:27:59.500 --> 03:28:00.500]  Right.
[03:28:00.500 --> 03:28:04.740]  And I do believe that because where I live at and where I was at, the police is running
[03:28:04.740 --> 03:28:05.740]  it.
[03:28:05.740 --> 03:28:06.740]  And I've seen it with my own eyes.
[03:28:06.740 --> 03:28:11.980]  And I'm glad you brought a lot to my attention about that because I've just moved from Cleveland
[03:28:11.980 --> 03:28:12.980]  Heights to Cleveland.
[03:28:12.980 --> 03:28:15.460]  Cleveland, you can walk outside butt naked.
[03:28:15.460 --> 03:28:19.920]  You go to Cleveland Heights, they're going to arrest you, say you raped somebody because
[03:28:19.920 --> 03:28:21.380]  you're butt naked.
[03:28:21.380 --> 03:28:23.740]  The police is running it all.
[03:28:23.740 --> 03:28:26.220]  You know, years ago, my father dead and gone.
[03:28:26.220 --> 03:28:30.340]  He told me it was going to people, it was going to be people on the devices on the TV
[03:28:30.340 --> 03:28:32.540]  that they can look through you and see where you at.
[03:28:32.540 --> 03:28:36.100]  I believe that because now they got them things they put on kids' leg and they look through
[03:28:36.100 --> 03:28:37.100]  the TV.
[03:28:37.100 --> 03:28:38.100]  No, no, no.
[03:28:38.100 --> 03:28:39.100]  Your Obama phone tracks everywhere you go.
[03:28:39.100 --> 03:28:40.100]  I believe that.
[03:28:40.100 --> 03:28:41.820]  They dial in and listen to you.
[03:28:41.820 --> 03:28:43.300]  No, it's horrible.
[03:28:43.300 --> 03:28:46.180]  They control you because they give you so many minutes a month.
[03:28:46.180 --> 03:28:47.180]  Do something.
[03:28:47.180 --> 03:28:50.460]  Here's another caller, the most incredible voice.
[03:28:50.460 --> 03:28:56.100]  Are you getting job offers for TV, radio, voiceovers, et cetera?
[03:28:56.100 --> 03:28:59.820]  It says you way better than Piers Morgan.
[03:28:59.820 --> 03:29:00.820]  Thanks for the comment.
[03:29:00.820 --> 03:29:03.620]  By the way, folks, I'm telling you, she needs her agent.
[03:29:03.620 --> 03:29:04.620]  She needs to do voiceovers.
[03:29:04.620 --> 03:29:06.660]  I guess I'm able because I'm trying to help her.
[03:29:06.660 --> 03:29:08.660]  Send me an agent out.
[03:29:08.660 --> 03:29:10.660]  Have you heard about FEMA camps?
[03:29:10.660 --> 03:29:12.020]  Yes, I did.
[03:29:12.020 --> 03:29:13.580]  I used FEMA before.
[03:29:13.580 --> 03:29:17.220]  FEMA is the one to help you if you say your flood is in the basement.
[03:29:17.220 --> 03:29:19.260]  But they're also the shadow government.
[03:29:19.260 --> 03:29:20.820]  They're with the government.
[03:29:20.820 --> 03:29:22.540]  Do you take the flu shot?
[03:29:22.540 --> 03:29:23.540]  No.
[03:29:23.540 --> 03:29:24.540]  Why?
[03:29:24.540 --> 03:29:25.540]  I got faith in God.
[03:29:25.540 --> 03:29:26.540]  Oh, yeah.
[03:29:26.540 --> 03:29:28.540]  Well, it never even protects you anyways.
[03:29:28.540 --> 03:29:29.540]  Right.
[03:29:29.540 --> 03:29:30.540]  Take it.
[03:29:30.540 --> 03:29:33.220]  We're going to do more of these questions tonight on the TV show.
[03:29:33.220 --> 03:29:34.220]  All right now.
[03:29:34.220 --> 03:29:35.940]  Let you get some late lunch.
[03:29:35.940 --> 03:29:36.940]  All right.
[03:29:36.940 --> 03:29:42.860]  And we're going to go back to retransmission covering news from the earlier broadcast here
[03:29:42.860 --> 03:29:43.860]  and I'll be back tomorrow.
[03:29:43.860 --> 03:29:45.620]  Live 11 a.m. Central.
[03:29:45.620 --> 03:29:47.060]  A lot more tonight.
[03:29:47.060 --> 03:29:51.140]  7 o'clock central, prisonplanet.tv with Obama Phone Lady.
[03:29:51.140 --> 03:29:52.140]  All right.
