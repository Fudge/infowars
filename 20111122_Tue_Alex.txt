[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:30.240]  Texas Alex Jones still on the road ladies and gentlemen coming to you by
[00:30.240 --> 00:34.000]  telephone apologize for that the Skype does not work everywhere with the
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.320]  modern miracles of technology or not everywhere but I am making my way back
[00:38.320 --> 00:45.560]  to Austin Texas and will be in studio very very soon it of course is the 22nd
[00:45.560 --> 00:52.600]  day of November 2011 we're going to be alive here for the next three hours at
[00:52.600 --> 00:59.040]  least we've got Greg Palace joining us in the second hour today former federal
[00:59.040 --> 01:04.880]  white-collar crime investigator I want to get his take on the whole MF global
[01:04.880 --> 01:08.840]  situation he was talking about these brokerage firms about to go completely
[01:08.840 --> 01:12.640]  mellow up just two weeks ago with us on air so I thought why not get him back up
[01:12.640 --> 01:16.520]  now and then the reason I've been hammering this MF global situation so
[01:16.520 --> 01:23.120]  much is because it ties into everything I'll guarantee you back in the 1980s
[01:23.120 --> 01:26.480]  somebody came up missing with a hundred million dollars I don't care who they
[01:26.480 --> 01:29.840]  were if they got caught publicly taking it they were gonna at least get a few
[01:29.840 --> 01:36.640]  years in jail like the Keating five that McCain was involved in now nothing
[01:36.640 --> 01:41.320]  happens and they're doing things that make the Keating five look like angels
[01:41.320 --> 01:48.400]  like like like choir boys like the Salvation Army it is so incredible
[01:48.400 --> 01:52.680]  by the way it's finally really starting to get out there the New York Times has
[01:52.680 --> 01:56.120]  the headline MF global trustees a shortfall could exceed 1.2 billion
[01:56.120 --> 01:59.920]  has reported yesterday the New York Times is now being forced to kind of get

[08:30.120 --> 08:36.480]  Watson we've also got Greg Pallist investigative journalist who is going to
[08:36.480 --> 08:41.080]  be joining us coming up in the second hour as well he was formerly a federal
[08:41.080 --> 08:46.520]  crime white-collar crime investigator at the highest levels of corporate crime so
[08:46.520 --> 08:53.120]  he's a perfect expert the BBC reporter to come on with us today and break down
[08:53.120 --> 08:58.120]  EMF global and other unravelings that are taking place why is this such a big
[08:58.120 --> 09:02.640]  deal they wouldn't have the head of the biggest derivatives group that claims
[09:02.640 --> 09:08.680]  they have 800 trillion in assets you are me right running around demonizing
[09:08.680 --> 09:13.640]  Gerald Salente and others for criticizing EMF global you wouldn't have
[09:13.640 --> 09:20.280]  Forbes magazine coming out and putting out reports concerning our reports here
[09:20.280 --> 09:24.800]  if this wasn't a big issue the establishment understands it the drug
[09:24.800 --> 09:29.880]  report today has a headline where's the money core sign former governor of New
[09:29.880 --> 09:35.240]  Jersey it's now over 1.2 billion they're not saying how much over 1.2
[09:35.240 --> 09:39.960]  billion and the fact that they would take this out of segregated accounts and
[09:39.960 --> 09:45.960]  the fact that they don't care if the public knows about this shows a new
[09:45.960 --> 09:56.040]  level in bold grand mega galactic level arse larceny it is unspeakably huge and
[09:56.040 --> 10:04.720]  it shows how incredibly reckless these people have gotten and it shows that if
[10:04.720 --> 10:09.040]  they can take now over 50,000 account holders money and just say you're not
[10:09.040 --> 10:13.120]  getting anything when it was their segregated accounts and it's clearly a
[10:13.120 --> 10:17.640]  federal crime and international crime it shows they will take any body's
[10:17.640 --> 10:22.480]  accounts and that will bring the entire financial system down which is what the
[10:22.480 --> 10:26.480]  globalist wants they can just offer their new world government system so Rick
[10:26.480 --> 10:29.640]  Powell is coming up in second hour today Aaron Dykes at the bottom of the hour
[10:29.640 --> 10:32.880]  with a whole bunch of news he's gonna rattle off a whole bunch of key
[10:32.880 --> 10:36.560]  information that he thinks should be front and center will get his perspective

[10:40.680 --> 10:48.960]  Michael Moore blames Hollywood Homeland Security propaganda of course that's
[10:48.960 --> 10:54.160]  just me being being sarcastic folks all of this homeland security activity is a
[10:54.160 --> 10:59.640]  bunch of security theater to basically train everyone to accept a total police
[10:59.640 --> 11:03.520]  state but going back to the actual headline Michael Moore blames homeland
[11:03.520 --> 11:10.320]  security for pepper spray brutality we have another one here massive hydro

[11:57.920 --> 12:02.520]  wouldn't be worried about this it's all coming up but first joining us with a
[12:02.520 --> 12:08.280]  quick report is Paul Joseph Watson his report is right in the center of the
[12:08.280 --> 12:13.320]  drugs report drug report calm today Egypt secret police renames itself
[12:13.320 --> 12:19.120]  homeland security notorious human rights abusers draws inspiration from U.S.

[12:22.200 --> 12:27.000]  and then he's got to get ready to host the nightly news tonight we've had Mike
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.920]  Adams last night we've had Aaron Dyke's doing a great job they're all doing a
[12:30.920 --> 12:35.200]  fabulous job and now Paul Watson from England tonight will host a 30 minute
[12:35.200 --> 12:40.000]  transmission of M4s nightly news seven o'clock Central Prison Planet TV and
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  don't forget that 15-day free trial ends at the end of the month if you want to
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.920]  support us now with the time we have a bunch of other specials too we started
[12:46.920 --> 12:51.320]  the yearly special we only do in late November December where you can get
[12:51.320 --> 12:56.680]  almost half off it's what 5.3 months off the year when you buy a year you get
[12:56.680 --> 13:00.820]  5.3 months or almost half off on the early membership right now at
[13:00.820 --> 13:06.840]  prisonplanet.tv let's go now to Paul Watson all over the world Paul the
[13:06.840 --> 13:10.920]  United States and England as well now the vanguard of high-tech police state
[13:10.920 --> 13:15.600]  torture and stealing and evil because we're run by the mega banks is now
[13:15.600 --> 13:20.480]  being used by the Communist Chinese by the Egyptian brutal forces by many
[13:20.480 --> 13:25.760]  others and say hey America does it so new dark age dawning give America can be
[13:25.760 --> 13:32.080]  fully taken over and turned into this engine of pure evil Paul Watson well I
[13:32.080 --> 13:35.840]  mean Mike Adams talked about it last night on the nightly news they called
[13:35.840 --> 13:40.920]  it trickle down tyranny in reference to how you know we had this TSA member and
[13:40.920 --> 13:45.440]  care home workers abusing people deemed inferior to them so it's not only
[13:45.440 --> 13:51.560]  trickle down it's trickle global and you had this notorious it was called state
[13:51.560 --> 13:57.160]  security Egyptian secret police basically they were implicated in the
[13:57.160 --> 14:01.880]  imprisonment and torture of anti-mubarak activists before that
[14:01.880 --> 14:08.000]  dictator fell and now that the same military hunter is still in control in
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.080]  anticipation of these elections it was basically a footnote in the Financial
[14:13.080 --> 14:17.960]  Times yesterday they've renamed it it was called state security they've
[14:17.960 --> 14:24.080]  renamed it homeland security it says quote under the auspices of the Ministry
[14:24.080 --> 14:29.320]  of Interior the 100,000 strong state security service has been renamed
[14:29.320 --> 14:34.520]  homeland security and personnel moved around the Financial Times reported so
[14:34.520 --> 14:38.200]  they're taking their inspiration from big sis they're trying to give their
[14:38.200 --> 14:43.040]  secret police torture squad which spies on protesters just like homeland
[14:43.040 --> 14:50.000]  security some sense of legitimacy in this reshuffle reshuffling of the deck
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.400]  chairs so it just it just illustrates Paul I want you to continue but let's be
[14:54.400 --> 14:59.800]  fair now we don't know now we know this is big America's run by the bankers by
[14:59.800 --> 15:04.080]  the globalist it's not fair to say America is running Egypt we've all just
[15:04.080 --> 15:08.360]  been hijacked by the same global technocratic management system but let's
[15:08.360 --> 15:14.840]  be fair they we stolen here in the US from Hitler and then they've stolen it
[15:14.840 --> 15:19.040]  from us in Egypt so let's be fair we didn't invent the wheel here
[15:19.040 --> 15:25.360]  homeland or right security Gestapo checkpoints black uniforms surveillance
[15:25.360 --> 15:31.880]  citizens buys Hitler Hitler did that and then let's let's let's not talk about
[15:31.880 --> 15:36.560]  about the US government or where it gets it's it's it's it's it's marching
[15:36.560 --> 15:40.840]  orders from modeling off of Hitler than the Stasi later so let's not talk bad
[15:40.840 --> 15:44.840]  about them and then also expanding on that Paul what do you make of Michael
[15:44.840 --> 15:48.520]  Moore actually a blind hog finding an acre in her broken clock being right
[15:48.520 --> 15:52.040]  twice a day he's come out and said which is admitted weeks ago we reported
[15:52.040 --> 15:57.840]  homeland security is directing all the attacks on Occupy Wall Street all over
[15:57.840 --> 16:01.160]  the country whether you love Occupy or hate it the point is they tell the
[16:01.160 --> 16:04.560]  homeless to go there they release the criminals to go there to make it look
[16:04.560 --> 16:09.040]  bad and now all my security is directing the attacks on it because George
[16:09.040 --> 16:16.560]  Soros and Obama couldn't co-opt it well precisely and that's why the military
[16:16.560 --> 16:22.520]  hunter in Egypt has directly pointed out the work of US law enforcement
[16:22.520 --> 16:28.040]  authorities in dealing with these OWS protesters they said that the quote firm
[16:28.040 --> 16:32.480]  stance justified their actions against the Egyptian protesters they killed
[16:32.480 --> 16:37.680]  obviously dozens tortured thousands more over the past few days alone so again
[16:37.680 --> 16:43.160]  they're setting the example and brutal third world military dictatorship so
[16:43.160 --> 16:47.280]  following course and yeah that's right Moore's come out today and said that it's
[16:47.280 --> 16:53.960]  basically a Tiananmen Square moment for the Occupy Wall Street movement
[16:53.960 --> 17:00.860]  beating people in fetal positions and saying that's resisting when they're
[17:00.860 --> 17:05.000]  assaulting you all the common law all the federal rulings say you have a right
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.200]  to defend yourself against an assault by anybody but instead now while they
[17:09.200 --> 17:13.520]  assaults you you can't even cover your baby as a pepper spray it or that's
[17:13.520 --> 17:17.560]  assaulting them don't worry though all of you fools and psychos serving the
[17:17.560 --> 17:22.440]  evil system it's gonna suck you dry as well you're gonna be judged by opening
[17:22.440 --> 17:28.200]  this gate to hell I want you to know that Watson continue but I mean Alex
[17:28.200 --> 17:32.880]  they were blocking a path just like the the Chinese guy was blocking the tank
[17:32.880 --> 17:36.680]  in Tiananmen Square I mean should he have been moaned down there are comments
[17:36.680 --> 17:40.520]  on the government today would literally slip that guy's throat if you had a
[17:40.520 --> 17:45.720]  child with it bash its brains out and then charge the child with assault but
[17:45.720 --> 17:49.880]  I've read comments on neocom websites where it's like yes spray the spray the
[17:49.880 --> 17:53.480]  damn hippies they were blocking the path so does that mean that guy should have
[17:53.480 --> 17:58.080]  been turned into pulp by the Communist Chinese tank to be fair it's split
[17:58.080 --> 18:02.080]  50-50 with it with these neocons some of them were saying yeah but even if you
[18:02.080 --> 18:05.720]  disagree with the protest as it sets a horrible example which is exactly right
[18:05.720 --> 18:09.360]  we don't agree with every grievance that they've uttered and in fact they've
[18:09.360 --> 18:12.760]  blocked us from their own official website that doesn't mean we're not
[18:12.760 --> 18:17.400]  gonna speak out against flagrant that's right that's the George Soros group on
[18:17.400 --> 18:21.480]  record with that site trying to control that diverse group and so of course they
[18:21.480 --> 18:26.400]  banned info wars dot com and Alex Jones and then mixed in David Duke to make us
[18:26.400 --> 18:30.200]  look bad I mean look that isn't exactly just because their leadership is
[18:30.200 --> 18:33.560]  authoritarian doesn't mean we're authoritarian just because everybody else
[18:33.560 --> 18:37.200]  is turning to evil and turning to stomping on our way of life and the
[18:37.200 --> 18:43.200]  Republic doesn't mean we stop on it well that's right I mean just as the OWS
[18:43.200 --> 18:47.800]  protesters can be manipulated so are those in Egypt I mean it's it's the same
[18:47.800 --> 18:53.040]  April 6 youth movement Muhammad El Baraday you know international crisis
[18:53.040 --> 18:57.240]  group that are trying to get in power so they're trying to replace a hardcore
[18:57.240 --> 19:01.320]  arcane dictatorship with a soft touchy-feely dictatorship but again that
[19:01.320 --> 19:05.080]  doesn't mean you support the brutal crackdown on protesters that we've seen
[19:05.080 --> 19:09.280]  over the past few days so it's important to make that distinction but what is
[19:09.280 --> 19:15.440]  also interesting Alex is that Ron Paul actually got occupied yesterday a CNN
[19:15.440 --> 19:20.640]  clips just emerged Ron Paul's given a town hall speech and he gets disrupted
[19:20.640 --> 19:25.240]  by Occupy Wall Street protesters who start chanting you know we are the 99%
[19:25.240 --> 19:30.240]  I mean the protest in a guy who's took no money from Wall Street while the polls
[19:30.240 --> 19:34.520]  show that half of them plan to vote for Barack Obama who of course his entire
[19:34.520 --> 19:38.880]  administration is funded by Wall Street so the term Occupy Wall Street is a
[19:38.880 --> 19:43.600]  cutout for the Democrats to claim anybody who ever protests the banking
[19:43.600 --> 19:48.760]  corruption is on their side then they could send their operatives after their
[19:48.760 --> 19:51.720]  real enemy and that right there just proves that large segments of it are
[19:51.720 --> 19:55.960]  Soros Rod Paul one more segment on this situation that Aaron Dykes is coming up

[24:11.960 --> 24:16.080]  well Wednesday I hope everybody has a great Thanksgiving coming up we have a
[24:16.080 --> 24:19.640]  lot to be thankful for private property rights the family the second
[24:19.640 --> 24:23.360]  amendment and the United States has not been perfect but it's been the best
[24:23.360 --> 24:27.160]  there's been when it comes to liberty and freedom literally the pioneer it's a
[24:27.160 --> 24:31.680]  true shame to see it becoming a pioneer in corruption and oppression and new
[24:31.680 --> 24:36.680]  forms of technocratic evil I saw an article or one of England's top judges
[24:36.680 --> 24:40.840]  admits that they're getting rid of the entire English common law and Magna Carta
[24:40.840 --> 24:45.560]  which is the model of the US system and the model worldwide of freedom and going
[24:45.560 --> 24:50.600]  to an EU UN model by the way they've got what 31 declarations of human rights
[24:50.600 --> 24:55.040]  but in the last articles they state that you don't have any rights of the UN
[24:55.040 --> 24:59.560]  says notice they're invading all these countries in the name of people's rights
[24:59.560 --> 25:03.920]  and then putting in even more dictatorial regimes you see they want a
[25:03.920 --> 25:10.200]  brutal oligarchy where you can't even pick off a single leader and where you
[25:10.200 --> 25:13.640]  don't have one big ego to deal with but just a bunch of criminals that work for
[25:13.640 --> 25:17.640]  you kind of like we have now with our corrupt Congress that's what's being
[25:17.640 --> 25:23.720]  set up in Egypt going back to Paul Watson Watson witnessing all of this
[25:23.720 --> 25:27.640]  happened no one can deny now even people who have who are totally literate
[25:27.640 --> 25:34.280]  historically that this is an out-of-control globally directed corporate
[25:34.280 --> 25:42.120]  creeped out control freak really insane tyranny where they destroy the world
[25:42.120 --> 25:46.400]  system as they gobble it up and they just hope that a bunch of paramilitary
[25:46.400 --> 25:51.000]  police having their own world destroyed their own future destroyed are gonna
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.400]  follow orders and beat everybody in the head and just hope everybody's watching
[25:54.400 --> 26:00.120]  NASCAR and football and soccer drooling I don't think they're gonna get away
[26:00.120 --> 26:03.440]  with it I mean their old tricks don't work anymore Paul
[26:03.440 --> 26:09.720]  well it's amazing isn't it that when the police beating people up in Syria the
[26:09.720 --> 26:15.000]  humanitarian crusaders mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton called on Assad to step
[26:15.000 --> 26:20.960]  down we had Libyan they were still being called protesters by the media even as
[26:20.960 --> 26:25.040]  they commandeered fighter jets and rocket propelled grades they were being
[26:25.040 --> 26:30.920]  harshly treated of course we had that invasion but when dozens are killed and
[26:30.920 --> 26:35.960]  thousands are tortured on the streets of Cairo you know Obama and Hillary there's
[26:35.960 --> 26:40.600]  barely a whimper where's where's the NATO backed humanitarian intervention there
[26:40.600 --> 26:45.760]  was the humanitarian intervention in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia when protesters
[26:45.760 --> 26:52.120]  are getting their heads cracked there on a daily basis shot there yeah it does
[26:52.120 --> 27:00.120]  make our news when they just shoot a crowd it's like every day and it barely
[27:00.120 --> 27:08.520]  makes the news but I mean $1.3 billion in aid in 2010 alone to Egypt's ruling
[27:08.520 --> 27:13.200]  military hunter kind of explains why Obama and Clinton aren't that concerned
[27:13.200 --> 27:18.280]  about dead protesters on the streets of Cairo so again it illustrates the
[27:18.280 --> 27:23.000]  hypocrisy and then even if they do get rid of the military dictatorship you've
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.720]  got El Berardi and all these other you know CFR globalists waiting to swoop in
[27:27.720 --> 27:32.200]  and give them a massage or visitors of the Bilderberg group at our lateral
[27:32.200 --> 27:35.640]  Commission CFR you're not supposed to mention that because the anointed
[27:35.640 --> 27:40.120]  mainstream media said we're not supposed to talk about international bankers and
[27:40.120 --> 27:44.320]  cartels that's a conspiracy theory sure they're just announcing in Time magazine
[27:44.320 --> 27:48.960]  and Financial Times of London that it's a quote global Goldman Sachs banking
[27:48.960 --> 27:54.320]  dictatorship and our media almost congratulates them oh good job you took
[27:54.320 --> 27:57.920]  everything down wow you're really control all the governments but then when
[27:57.920 --> 28:01.600]  we say we don't want to live under these bankers it's like shut up it doesn't
[28:01.600 --> 28:06.640]  exist you insane person you cause the White House shooting well I mean
[28:06.640 --> 28:11.520]  precisely and they still go on about Bilderberg and how it has no power even
[28:11.520 --> 28:17.080]  after the former NATO secretary secretary general will place from Belgium
[28:17.080 --> 28:21.720]  Willy Klase came out and said that they go to Bilderberg they get their orders
[28:21.720 --> 28:24.720]  and then they carry them out in their different spheres of influence so they
[28:24.720 --> 28:29.480]  admit it that Bilderberg members admit it and yet it's still a conspiracy theory
[28:29.480 --> 28:33.960]  and you're a dangerous extremist if you believe in it well Paul you turn out so
[28:33.960 --> 28:37.560]  many prolific articles that we need to get you or Kurt or Steve or Aaron or
[28:37.560 --> 28:41.840]  somebody to do an article saying you know you know is it still bad to talk
[28:41.840 --> 28:46.240]  about global government are we allowed to and just be sarcastic and show like
[28:46.240 --> 28:50.440]  10 articles were insiders admit there's a global corporate government and then
[28:50.440 --> 28:54.680]  10 examples under it or five or whatever of them currently saying it doesn't
[28:54.680 --> 29:00.440]  exist have you seen the video the old guy that comes up against mad because I'm
[29:00.440 --> 29:05.480]  videotaping the UN marker and then saying America's being taken over at the
[29:05.480 --> 29:10.600]  Grand Canyon yeah I mean these people it's like you don't get a medal when
[29:10.600 --> 29:14.520]  you're right folks you get attacked Paul briefly what's coming up tonight on the

[33:46.680 --> 33:52.240]  some of the news that we have gotten into coming up insight this is from
[33:52.240 --> 33:58.280]  Reuters farm belt rage over MF global could chill markets we've been saying
[33:58.280 --> 34:04.880]  that for several weeks now oh but we're bad the media says of course anger
[34:04.880 --> 34:12.680]  rises as MF global client see funds frozen oh so that's just some of what
[34:12.680 --> 34:20.000]  is going on right now that we're going to be breaking down Obama has pardoned
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.280]  dope dealers well Clinton did that too and these are gangsters Chicago Jewel
[34:24.280 --> 34:28.400]  thief is pardoned and they see it's only the general public that has a book
[34:28.400 --> 34:33.260]  thrown at them for no reason political fixer and Obama pal Tony Resco
[34:33.260 --> 34:40.240]  sentence today anti-Obama sales outpace pro-Obama four-fold an online
[34:40.240 --> 34:44.720]  clothier we've got all those articles by the way if you want to support us in our
[34:44.720 --> 34:49.600]  news operation we've got plenty of t-shirts and materials exposing Obama as
[34:49.600 --> 34:54.480]  a puppet at info wars.com and of course we have the Obama deception on DVD
[34:54.480 --> 35:00.280]  anybody can watch it in decent quality on YouTube or Google video over 35
[35:00.280 --> 35:03.800]  million views total out there that we know of not counting BitTorrents and
[35:03.800 --> 35:08.200]  other systems but we do have a concerted effort to demonize the Obama
[35:08.200 --> 35:11.800]  deception it's part of a whole history of this and it shows actually how weak
[35:11.800 --> 35:16.120]  these globalist are so after we cover some of the news we're there and I'm
[35:16.120 --> 35:19.800]  getting into the latest on MF Global then I'm getting into the fact that
[35:19.800 --> 35:25.160]  they've tried to basically connect us to the latest reported shooter who his
[35:25.160 --> 35:29.200]  friends said Bobby was Jesus and thought Obama was the Antichrist we don't
[35:29.200 --> 35:32.720]  think Obama's the Antichrist we think he's a teleprompter reading Harvard
[35:32.720 --> 35:36.920]  lawyer puppet nobody just like George W. Bush the rest of them he's a front man
[35:36.920 --> 35:40.720]  we're concerned with the Rockefellers the Rothschilds the Saxe-Coburg gothers
[35:40.720 --> 35:45.080]  the Dutch royal family we're concerned with the Fortune 100 that's anti free
[35:45.080 --> 35:48.480]  market we're gonna be breaking all that down but this is it this affects the
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.120]  entire First Amendment that is how they're this is the tactic that will be
[35:52.120 --> 35:55.160]  used to go after a free speech so we'll talk about that with Aaron but
[35:55.160 --> 35:58.480]  speaking of supporting the broadcast when you support our local AM and FM
[35:58.480 --> 36:03.440]  affiliates by going to their sponsors and supporting them or becoming a
[36:03.440 --> 36:08.000]  sponsor of your local business of that station it helps us reach millions of
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.720]  people who have not heard the truth who've never actually understood this
[36:11.720 --> 36:17.400]  information it also helps us reach still millions more who didn't think the New
[36:17.400 --> 36:21.360]  World Order was real but now see it all coming true and are ready to listen and
[36:21.360 --> 36:26.240]  ready to take action it is so valuable to the future of humanity that we're on
[36:26.240 --> 36:30.440]  all these AM and FM stations so please support them also support our national
[36:30.440 --> 36:35.760]  sponsors and support the sponsors that you see at info wars calm and prison
[36:35.760 --> 36:39.280]  planet calm and remember they're trying to bring on the internet kill switch
[36:39.280 --> 36:41.960]  they're trying to bring in the copyright stuff where there's no judge no
[36:41.960 --> 36:45.600]  jury they just shut you down for no reason I mean that's even members of
[36:45.600 --> 36:48.760]  Congress that's even seen at saying it's the end of the internet and free
[36:48.760 --> 36:56.760]  spaces we know it they're trying to pass all of this right now this is real so
[36:56.760 --> 37:03.800]  email the URL Twitter info wars you'll pound info wars now we've learned more
[37:03.800 --> 37:07.800]  about Twitter that's how you actually do it you pound info wars and then that
[37:07.800 --> 37:13.000]  gets everybody else to link up to it and get it out to everybody it is so
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.760]  important to fight these mafias it's so important that if we're gonna go head up
[37:17.760 --> 37:26.760]  against the globalist we go 110% 110% that means all out not holding back you
[37:26.760 --> 37:31.440]  know growing up I thought 110% was a stupid term it really is more than that
[37:31.440 --> 37:36.680]  you want to go 200% you want to go 300% you want to go 400% because what you
[37:36.680 --> 37:41.920]  think is 100% the mind has governors in it just like a race car will have a
[37:41.920 --> 37:45.920]  governor or a city bus will have a governor that city bus could probably
[37:45.920 --> 37:50.000]  go 100 miles an hour but it's governed back to 55 miles an hour most 18
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.120]  wheelers can go 100 miles an hour but they're governed back to 65 miles an
[37:54.120 --> 38:00.760]  hour back when the speed limit was 55 it was they were governed to 56 you have a
[38:00.760 --> 38:05.560]  governor and the globalists actually use those governors they manipulate you
[38:05.560 --> 38:09.280]  and then teach you to stand down and not be involved and not be informed you've
[38:09.280 --> 38:15.120]  got to go 110% and when you learn you can go 10% over 100 you're gonna find you
[38:15.120 --> 38:20.000]  can go 120% you can go 130% that's why they do hypnotism with athletes they
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.680]  found it really works they can take some guy can usually only bench press 500
[38:23.680 --> 38:29.160]  pounds he can suddenly bench press 600 pounds under hypnosis again you can
[38:29.160 --> 38:32.880]  consciously and I'm not saying I've excelled at anything you just got to
[38:32.880 --> 38:36.080]  believe that you can take action you've got to understand that you've got to know
[38:36.080 --> 38:41.120]  you have power everything the globalists do is so is is is social conditioning
[38:41.120 --> 38:47.000]  psychological psi-op warfare to teach you you're a piece of garbage the system
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.280]  is scared of the Obama deception look at the fact of everything they've done to
[38:51.280 --> 38:54.360]  attack it over the last three years I'll get to that later the point is we're

[40:20.520 --> 40:24.240]  small because it's that spirit of resistance that will grow into a mighty
[40:24.240 --> 40:29.840]  oak it's the mustard seed you take action a little things doors open this is

[41:04.280 --> 41:09.240]  same thing you got to get on the horse you're never gonna learn how to drive a
[41:09.240 --> 41:13.440]  tractor till you get on the tractor the globalist want to keep you in a little

[41:18.960 --> 41:23.680]  go to info wars calm the articles we did last night about how they're trying to

[41:37.280 --> 41:41.320]  Aaron Dykes Aaron oh you've got a cornucopia of news you take the helm
[41:41.320 --> 41:46.080]  because I'll interrupt if I don't actually sit back here for the next 10
[41:46.080 --> 41:50.120]  minutes you take a step into break with the news and analysis and then I'm gonna
[41:50.120 --> 41:54.120]  come back and tell folks about the Obama situation and the MF global I know
[41:54.120 --> 41:57.360]  you've got some MF global there so we want to get to that oh all these people
[41:57.360 --> 42:01.080]  saying Salente deserve to have his private account taken because he was in
[42:01.080 --> 42:04.680]  being you know it was he was money he'd gotten in derivatives that was or not
[42:04.680 --> 42:09.640]  derivatives in the in the in the future that was he is under law oh now they're
[42:09.640 --> 42:14.520]  saying they're gonna take the farmers the farmers stuff oh I guess they are
[42:14.520 --> 42:17.920]  gonna deserve it too and then all of you when you lose your bank accounts that are
[42:17.920 --> 42:21.360]  you all for this stuff I guess you're gonna deserve it as well or when they
[42:21.360 --> 42:26.120]  devalue our dollar more I guess I guess all of us deserve it well I guess in a
[42:26.120 --> 42:30.680]  sick way we do for living in denial and letting a bunch of crooks get control of
[42:30.680 --> 42:35.320]  us and teach us it's okay for them to grab our children's genitals and by the
[42:35.320 --> 42:43.200]  way there's more TSA in the news more TSA pedophiles more TSA rapes more evil
[42:43.200 --> 42:48.240]  just oozing out of the big sewer line that is the federal government and all
[42:48.240 --> 42:52.840]  the trash and nobody control freaks they've hired as an army of darkness as
[42:52.840 --> 42:57.480]  our founding fathers warned of new offices and swarms of agents to eat out
[42:57.480 --> 43:02.280]  our sustenance eat out our substance the baton is handed to Aaron Dykes Aaron
[43:02.280 --> 43:07.320]  give us a news breakdown yeah hi Alex I mean first what you're talking about
[43:07.320 --> 43:12.680]  about power on that spiritual and higher level it really factors in because so
[43:12.680 --> 43:17.320]  much of this new world order system is that general generic pressure in whatever
[43:17.320 --> 43:22.960]  our capacity is to roll over to absorb into that Borg system and it's really so
[43:22.960 --> 43:27.040]  many times when we say no that we have that power it's not when you put on a
[43:27.040 --> 43:31.680]  TSA uniform and scream at people I have the power it's when you actually stand
[43:31.680 --> 43:36.800]  up for something that matters for a principal or what have you and all that
[43:36.800 --> 43:40.760]  power in the uniform really goes to the system it doesn't go to the individual
[43:40.760 --> 43:45.600]  and just joining that system is how we become so vulnerable I mean it's very
[43:45.600 --> 43:49.720]  evident in the economic problems we face because they've asked us all over
[43:49.720 --> 43:54.840]  decades of globalization to bind together under that fascist branch to
[43:54.840 --> 43:58.920]  leverage our debts together to interconnect the world at such a level
[43:58.920 --> 44:03.200]  that no one can even understand the level of financial fraud going on because
[44:03.200 --> 44:07.320]  of all the derivatives and cross bets and and credit default swaps and all the
[44:07.320 --> 44:12.640]  other complicated mechanisms that are threatening the system now Alex and you
[44:12.640 --> 44:17.960]  see that here again with times headline can the US Federal Reserve help save
[44:17.960 --> 44:22.920]  Europe's banks and those of us who've been following the news have known for
[44:22.920 --> 44:27.240]  some time that the Federal Reserve has been secretly giving money to Europe and
[44:27.240 --> 44:31.440]  their top banks but that had to come out through a lot of pressure on the Federal
[44:31.440 --> 44:35.960]  Reserve here politically in the US and yet here it is just casually admitted
[44:35.960 --> 44:39.640]  that the US Federal Reserve has been pumping billions of dollars into
[44:39.640 --> 44:43.800]  Europe's banking system in recent weeks to help stabilize the continent's
[44:43.800 --> 44:49.080]  financial crisis and it goes on to how there's an agreement signed between the
[44:49.080 --> 44:54.000]  New York Fed and the European Central Bank to swap dollars at a fixed exchange
[44:54.000 --> 44:58.640]  rate and how they want that Federal Reserve quote big bazooka on the table
[44:58.640 --> 45:01.640]  so they don't have to use it that's the same thing they said about the new
[45:01.640 --> 45:07.040]  financial vehicle they want set up in Europe under Merkel and Sarkozy they
[45:07.040 --> 45:11.600]  want an unlimited financial bazooka that they can use it will they just want an
[45:11.600 --> 45:16.360]  unlimited pile of money and something you've talked about recently Alex has
[45:16.360 --> 45:20.960]  ever a Palpatine would say unlimited power and remember this is a class of
[45:20.960 --> 45:24.800]  criminals Aaron here I am interrupting as you're addressing me and bring up
[45:24.800 --> 45:28.400]  these points once you go back to your next one is that remember it's all a
[45:28.400 --> 45:33.960]  bunch of crooks like Corzine and and and Madoff and and Ken Lay who came up with
[45:33.960 --> 45:40.080]  all of this crud it's just a bunch of crooks like you know the head of Italy
[45:40.080 --> 45:45.760]  Barleson who just had to step down look at them they're all a bunch of crooks
[45:45.760 --> 45:51.280]  it's simple they're crooks homeland security is their stick-up squad like
[45:51.280 --> 45:56.280]  bank robbers come in a bank well these guys have an army of moron idiots that
[45:56.280 --> 45:58.600]  actually think they're the good guys and don't know they're working for the
[45:58.600 --> 46:02.600]  actual terrorists to any can't argue with that they put the underwear bomber on
[46:02.600 --> 46:06.600]  the plane they put al-qaeda in charge of Libya you people out there that won't
[46:06.600 --> 46:10.160]  wake up the fact that our government is a bunch of murdering criminals are gonna
[46:10.160 --> 46:14.320]  let these people totally take over we're all in danger haven't you idiots
[46:14.320 --> 46:23.800]  figured this out yet I'm just getting so angry now I agree Alex and how sad is
[46:23.800 --> 46:27.600]  it that all the secret police that have unfortunately been trained by elements
[46:27.600 --> 46:32.720]  of the US government you know ties back to even the Nazi regime are now taking
[46:32.720 --> 46:38.080]  the moniker homeland security it's just a bad sign to pass that baton of undue
[46:38.080 --> 46:42.720]  secret police power and then even adopt the names and share them throughout the
[46:42.720 --> 46:46.480]  generations as you know homeland security goes back to the Nazi regime as
[46:46.480 --> 46:51.200]  well but but getting back to the European financial news of the current day
[46:51.200 --> 46:55.480]  it's also interesting that Bloomberg has the headline Kissinger's favorite
[46:55.480 --> 47:00.360]  communist paves the way for Mario Monti to govern Italy and it talks about the
[47:00.360 --> 47:05.440]  aging president Giorgio Napolitano largely a figurehead who nonetheless
[47:05.440 --> 47:10.880]  cleared the way for the Bilderberg technocrat yeah looter Mario Monti who's
[47:10.880 --> 47:15.160]  totally used to be part of Goldman Sachs are related to it like so many other
[47:15.160 --> 47:20.080]  important people in this system and the other article I had next to me got into
[47:20.080 --> 47:24.480]  how the European Central Bank head I think that's Draghi has connected to
[47:24.480 --> 47:29.520]  Goldman Sachs and all these other key figures even as you have MF global also
[47:29.520 --> 47:34.240]  with Corzine formerly head of Goldman Sachs now kind of the canary in the
[47:34.240 --> 47:38.880]  cold mine for all the missing money that is yet to come I think really paving the
[47:38.880 --> 47:42.600]  way for the next giant global collapse of so many others have said on this
[47:42.600 --> 47:47.160]  program but the fact that Kissinger has this favorite communist kind of gives
[47:47.160 --> 47:51.600]  away a lot of his past activity in Italy where you know secret police type
[47:51.600 --> 47:56.520]  activity repressed a lot of the legitimate government there and many
[47:56.520 --> 48:00.160]  aspects of that foreign policy became a client-state deal now it's still
[48:00.160 --> 48:06.160]  happening today with the same banker crew running the scene I don't know if
[48:06.160 --> 48:11.260]  you're still ready there to go Alex but the independent has the headline what
[48:11.260 --> 48:16.400]  price the new democracy Goldman Sachs conquers Europe and it gets into what I
[48:16.400 --> 48:20.240]  was just talking about how senior advisors at Goldman Sachs are in charge
[48:20.240 --> 48:25.040]  of the Western nation they're bringing up there Mario Monti and gets into what
[48:25.040 --> 48:30.040]  they're calling the Goldman Sachs project in Europe pointing out like I said
[48:30.040 --> 48:36.040]  also the European Central Bank head also from ex Goldman Sachs management you've
[48:36.040 --> 48:41.080]  also got the former IMF monetary funds European division run by a Goldman
[48:41.080 --> 48:46.080]  Sachs man Antonio Borges he just resigned but there are others as well it's a
[48:46.080 --> 48:50.880]  pretty lengthy article we're not going to cover it all here today but just look
[48:50.880 --> 48:54.880]  at the bait and switch putting the pressure on all these European nations
[48:54.880 --> 49:00.520]  that they owe this debt when in fact it was created really a created pretext and
[49:00.520 --> 49:04.440]  problems set up by the banks somewhere from yesterday's stack they had an
[49:04.440 --> 49:08.840]  article from back in August talking about why isn't Iceland more in the news
[49:08.840 --> 49:13.440]  at a great example of a small country that said no to the banker debt they
[49:13.440 --> 49:17.280]  tried to saddle them on and they did go through some tough times but they've
[49:17.280 --> 49:21.440]  basically come out of it just by saying no to the banks and essentially raising
[49:21.440 --> 49:25.280]  the question why aren't more of these other small European countries saying
[49:25.280 --> 49:30.000]  no to this fraudulent debt that has been piled on them so frustrated Aaron that's
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.400]  why I'm so frustrated we are here at the crossroads now they're making their bold
[49:35.400 --> 49:42.480]  in insanely out of control insanely naked hubris filled arrogance
[49:42.480 --> 49:51.360]  Hutzpah Ravada a plum filled macho in our face over the top arrogant con artist
[49:51.360 --> 49:56.880]  move with just flagrant stealing and tyranny and classical corruption and
[49:56.880 --> 50:03.240]  torture and evil and and treason right out in front of us and the public some
[50:03.240 --> 50:06.400]  of them are awake but the security forces are just a bunch of treasonous
[50:06.400 --> 50:10.400]  miscreants and we are going over the side of the cliff right now we've still
[50:10.400 --> 50:14.400]  got time to turn back and it's so easy just to see these crooks for who they
[50:14.400 --> 50:18.920]  are if we were like the Icelanders who who are highly educated and informed on
[50:18.920 --> 50:22.240]  average and intellectual they are one of the most highly educated groups in the

[54:19.440 --> 54:24.520]  of this is coming when I think about how right we've been and how right we're
[54:24.520 --> 54:30.520]  going to be about the next phases of this situation and getting briefly into
[54:30.520 --> 54:37.880]  this whole Obama deception situation the FBI visited our office a week before it
[54:37.880 --> 54:41.680]  was scheduled to be released and kept asking about the Obama deception then
[54:41.680 --> 54:46.960]  they were calling people on extensions before and after that asking about the
[54:46.960 --> 54:52.120]  Obama deception when I had I had you know the office manager Tim Frosier come in
[54:52.120 --> 54:57.240]  he manages the back shipping office area and he came up to you know the FBI is
[54:57.240 --> 55:01.600]  calling asked me about Obama deception and stuff and where they could send
[55:01.600 --> 55:04.680]  something we know what our proper address is and I'm like why are you
[55:04.680 --> 55:10.560]  sure it's the FBI so I call the number it's the official FBI office this is out
[55:10.560 --> 55:16.280]  of San Francisco and they wouldn't tell me why the FBI was coming just that they
[55:16.280 --> 55:21.680]  be showing up the next day and they had a subpoena and so then the FBI shows up
[55:21.680 --> 55:26.400]  with an Austin cop and won't say what it's really about but then I and then
[55:26.400 --> 55:33.200]  it leaves and then the other FBI agent calls back and says don't talk about it
[55:33.200 --> 55:38.480]  you know you know you know there's a gag order read that order and then I go on
[55:38.480 --> 55:41.920]  air and I say well I'm told not to talk about this but the FBI was here coming
[55:41.920 --> 55:46.720]  out the Obama deception I said I'm gonna go ahead and release it a couple days
[55:46.720 --> 55:50.280]  early because I don't know what's going on now it turned out it was over somebody
[55:50.280 --> 55:54.000]  threatened police on my website in the comments and later that came out the
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.400]  Associated Press I didn't even know what it was about they wouldn't tell me but
[55:59.400 --> 56:04.240]  they were using it as an excuse to ask about the Obama deception and we got the
[56:04.240 --> 56:11.600]  site hacked and the video removed where it said removed by user anybody who has a
[56:11.600 --> 56:15.960]  YouTube account knows they never restored that we raised came on it and
[56:15.960 --> 56:19.320]  they went in and did an investigation and did it to say yes it was entered by
[56:19.320 --> 56:23.880]  someone else and erased and they restored it first time that's ever happened
[56:23.880 --> 56:29.720]  we've had a bunch of other dirty tricks involving it I've had nightline come
[56:29.720 --> 56:33.000]  down and say won't your film cause violence aren't you concerned when the
[56:33.000 --> 56:38.000]  whole film is against violence it's about Obama being a puppet this is the
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.880]  type of film that would make somebody not want to attack Obama you know
[56:41.880 --> 56:45.080]  generally a schizophrenic type that thinks they're Jesus and he's the devil
[56:45.080 --> 56:49.720]  I've had schizophrenics like that on me before they're Christ I'm the devil I've
[56:49.720 --> 56:53.200]  got to die it's just some type of art type and that's what they alleged this
[56:53.200 --> 56:58.240]  guy was doing and now I've seen videos of him yeah totally crazy and a year ago
[56:58.240 --> 57:01.560]  at some party he watched the Obama deception I've read his material it's
[57:01.560 --> 57:05.120]  all about how we're seeing this video it's all about how Obama's the devil and
[57:05.120 --> 57:09.680]  he's Christ and he's Jesus and he's gonna get him if you believe that Obama
[57:09.680 --> 57:14.560]  wasn't even there what happened but might be a false flag I don't know they
[57:14.560 --> 57:19.320]  love to blame stuff on crazy people because they can't talk straight the
[57:19.320 --> 57:23.640]  issue is they've done this down dozens and dozens of times connecting
[57:23.640 --> 57:28.560]  anything to me if somebody falls and slips and they blame it on me I mean I'm
[57:28.560 --> 57:32.200]  like a banana peel or something and it's because they're scared of us we know
[57:32.200 --> 57:36.000]  we're on the White House enemies list that came out a few years ago and it
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.560]  just shows how scared they are of the truth and I've seen all these people on
[57:40.560 --> 57:45.560]  our YouTube channel saying yeah I agree with Alex let's let's get Obama
[57:45.560 --> 57:51.320]  rest in peace Obama try with with clear spam accounts probably Democratic
[57:51.320 --> 57:56.560]  operatives just to associate violence with that particular 9.5 million viewed
[57:56.560 --> 58:01.080]  one which is really scaring the establishment I'm gonna come back with
[58:01.080 --> 58:04.400]  MF global with Greg Palace huge developments on that front and I'll be
[58:04.400 --> 58:08.120]  back with us in the third hour I could be riding shotgun with palace off and on
[58:08.120 --> 58:12.840]  but what's your comments on this whole Obama deception situation Aaron well
[58:12.840 --> 58:17.240]  I'm flabbergasted but of course again it's about who is behind the throne and
[58:17.240 --> 58:20.560]  we know who that are it's not it's not vague it's specific it's council and
[58:20.560 --> 58:24.080]  foreign relation builder burgers and others were part of this new world order
[58:24.080 --> 58:29.000]  conspiracy that's what the film is really about and that's the focus of it
[58:29.000 --> 58:32.440]  and they don't like that they don't like it as people think they're going to hear
[58:32.440 --> 58:37.240]  about Obama and they actually ride out about the new world order get it out to
[58:37.240 --> 58:40.920]  everybody they're scared of this stuff it's like

[59:51.920 --> 01:00:06.160]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:13.520]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:21.800]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:29.000]  okay my friends Greg Palace is coming up to break down the incredible
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.840]  developments with MF global I mean do people realize how big this is that the
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:38.480]  company could just say we're keeping 1.2 million or more of people's private
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.280]  segregated accounts and that the media hasn't really made a big deal about it
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:47.040]  I mean it's finally starting to get attention but if you look at how many
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.800]  people in the Republican and Democratic parties but particularly the Democratic
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:57.640]  parties are just out-and-out villainous street type criminals a lot of
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.640]  Republican leaders they do it through big giant global contracts howler
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.480]  murder and stuff like that it's just as corrupt or more so but with the
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:10.120]  Democrats it's a it's a gutter type thing like with Bill Clinton you know
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:14.040]  being out of me in Arkansas flying the cocaine in and he was there with his
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:18.600]  limo taking delivery and he'll overseeing who would be murdered and
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:23.360]  personally raping the women and here's another headline political fixer and
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:32.200]  Obama pal Tony Resco gets 10 years in jail isn't that precious you know Obama
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:40.400]  Parton dope dealers Chicago jewel thief pardon Nancy Pelosi is using Occupy
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.200]  Wall Street to raise cash when she's totally controlled by the corrupt
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.840]  elements of Wall Street they're using big government control and selective
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.560]  enforcement to shut down their competition see it's not either you're
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.560]  for free market let banks run over you and let them get make her bailouts
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.560]  Margaret's very free market to jump and make her bailouts to many line
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:06.360]  conservative say it's mega banks waging war against the real economy here's
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:11.160]  another one where's the cash core sign you know again the is the New York
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.720]  Times saying where is the 1.2 billion plus and well if I have global
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:21.000]  shortfall doubles to over 1.2 billion anger raises as clients he funds a
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:28.360]  frozen farm belt rage that's right farm belt rage well don't worry that the
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.680]  farm belts is going to be imploded and taken over and bankrupted because they've
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.040]  now got the rural affairs council under the Department of Defense and owned
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:41.840]  homeland right security land security I mean that is going to keep everybody
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:46.160]  just incredibly safe everything's going to be wonderful and so what if they
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.240]  don't pay people back and destroys confidence when the markets implode
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:54.240]  even more the makers will just take that over it's all part of the fun command
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.040]  destruction or creative destruction as they call it does it look creative to
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:02.280]  you the economy falling apart and singing into a depression does to them
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:08.520]  farm belt rage over MF global could show markets when the CME group pledged
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:12.640]  300 million of its own money to help former MF global customers get their
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:18.680]  cash back faster the exchange was likely thinking of customers like Kansas
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:25.760]  cattle rancher Tim Ritzky yeah that's right the CME group has already kicked
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:32.200]  in 300 million but it's above 1.2 billion I'm afraid and the CME group we
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:37.520]  we've reissued their press releases from a year ago promising that they had all
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.640]  these hundreds of trillions and assets and everything was guaranteed while

[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.760]  more carrying our articles a couple times a week they've got one up there
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:27.360]  today where the Paul Watson wrote for info wars dot com right the middle of
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.440]  the drug report the biggest news website in the world hands down drives more
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:38.400]  news traffic than the New York Times and Twitter combined and Google got a love
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:42.800]  it and it's wonderful that drudge carries a lot of our news information so
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.520]  we return the favor right back at him if you go over there and the other great
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:52.200]  folks that don't work with him now we're going to be getting to palace in a
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.640]  moment but again if you go to info wars dot com you can find the story but if you
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.600]  go to the middle of drudge you can see the article where the dreaded secret
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:05.120]  police that worked for the military dictatorship in Egypt get rid of the old
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:09.120]  boss bring in the new boss even worse are now saying they're going to call
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:13.360]  themselves homeland security and rationalizing their activities pointing
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:18.840]  at u.s. police and their brutal crackdowns on occupy wall street that
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.360]  is a diverse group but even if you disagree with occupy wall street they
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.680]  have a right to protest and demonstrate now I'm going to talk to Greg in this
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:30.280]  segment the next but then we're going to take him up to the 51 break we're going
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:36.280]  to take calls but only on the global derivatives meltdown only on the brokerage
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:42.440]  firms only on credit swiss coming out and predicting bank runs and the
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.920]  possible end of the euro the destruction of confidence is what we're
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:50.560]  talking about in great palace I'm so glad we've got him his new book just
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:55.960]  debuted last week it's amazing shooting up the best-selling list we're going to
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:00.640]  be breaking that down as well before he leaves us but he was a former top federal
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.840]  white collar crime investigator just like william k black who's in my film
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.680]  fall the republic and he said a year and a half ago he said this is an order of
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:12.760]  magnitude that means ten times bigger than the biggest SNL scam we've ever
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:17.640]  seen the difference now is they're not just selling Ponzi schemes they're
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:22.440]  stealing money directly out of the account so he's a BBC ABC reporter best
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:26.400]  selling author multi-times over former federal investigator and I'm just
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.760]  lauding our guest because he's predicted everything that's come true that's the
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.960]  kind of guess we have on here I have a whole chapter in my book to send to
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:37.000]  tyranny where we it's a transcript of my interview with him in 2002 looking out
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.640]  of the future with derivatives and breaking down what's now happened the
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:44.680]  model of the global banks imploding third world countries through fraud buying
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:49.320]  off their politicians going ahead and killing the gooses that lay golden eggs
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.720]  so you control it if you kill and eat the goose you know nobody else is going
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:56.880]  to get the golden eggs so they're going for red meat not gold eggs they don't
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.960]  want a free market they don't want true freedom they don't want stability and
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:03.880]  here's Reuters what we told you about I'm gonna get Greg Palace's take on this
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:10.680]  farm belt rage over MF global could chill markets and it quotes all of these
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:15.160]  farmers and ranchers that bet on the different commodities because they're
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.240]  experts in it and I've got family that's been involved in cattle futures and corn
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:22.960]  futures and do pretty good in it they're not involved in it now because they know
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:26.560]  you can get burned even when you've already taken the money put in your
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:32.160]  account it's your money you even put in many cases they're taking these accounts
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:37.200]  there's the keyword that are segregated now just a week and a half ago the head
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.800]  of the CFTC who we now learn was involved in MF global has had to
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:45.840]  accuse himself with core sign he came out and said this looks you know criminal
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:50.280]  blah blah blah now now there was a week-long cover-up where they didn't
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.640]  want to discuss it now the New York Times is covering it today it's over 1.2
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:59.880]  billion up from 600 million and the CME group has had to dump 300 million in
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:06.560]  this ladies and gentlemen could be the the the the spark that lights off of the
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:11.760]  fireworks factory as they say and joining us to break this down how big
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:16.200]  this could be you think we're in a depression now folks why would the
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:21.960]  banksters destroy confidence like this Greg Pallas who understands their
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:27.280]  kleptocracy their kleptocratic psychology because he studied them and put a
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:34.040]  lot of them in jail joins us Greg is is this the beginning of a wild orgy of
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:39.320]  corruption or have we seen the worst no this is the beginning of the exposure
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:44.000]  of some of the wild orgy of corruption it's there okay let's remember when
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.640]  you're talking about MF capital and you're talking about John Corzine this
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:54.720]  was the guy who was CEO of Goldman Sachs so in other words this is the guy that
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:59.040]  lit the fuse and began the fires that of course blew up his company not that
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.000]  he cares he was already worth about a quarter billion dollars so if you're
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.640]  if you're out there don't wring out your hanky for John Corzine you know that
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:12.360]  just a billion bucks is disappearing a lot of it farmers money because they're
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:16.400]  in the come out it because it's commodities and you're right and so
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:20.640]  what I did in vultures picnic and by the way I just so you know Alex one I want
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:25.040]  to thank you I know they think that that the listeners out there in in the
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:30.120]  middle of America are illiterate but actually you put vultures picnic on the
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.440]  Times bestseller was that Alex so thank you much but I have to change the name
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.720]  from vultures picnic to job creators picnic you know people like John
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:43.920]  Corzine right but here's one of things I uncovered there these guys Goldman and
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.720]  the and the big banks we're running this scam where they're working with the
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.440]  euro countries especially Greece secretly working with the governments in
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:57.680]  the central bankers to pull money out of their of the central banks to convert
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:01.880]  the currencies into yen's dollars move them around where they were euros at
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:07.040]  first put them back in and supposedly these big operators like Goldman were
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.440]  taking billions and billions and billions of dollars of losses well that's
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:15.320]  on the cover on the surface and of course the tarp program you are now
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.960]  paying for all their losses Goldman Sachs was turned into a commercial bank
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:25.560]  with public guarantees in 24 hours this usually takes 10 years and you have to
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:29.320]  show a strong balance sheet Goldman Sachs says we're bankrupt make us a
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.840]  commercial bank and bail us out they do that in 24 hours so he so they're
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:36.560]  showing losses but they weren't there those losses weren't there they had
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:40.200]  secret agreements with the Greek government they had secret agreements
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:44.880]  with other with Italian and Spanish governments in which Goldman and the
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:49.760]  other banks losses but particularly Goldman would be made up Goldman would
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:56.320]  be basically paid off secretly and in addition Goldman got about 300 million
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.920]  that's a 340 million dollars of fees that's about a third of a billion
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:05.120]  dollars of fee for this scam the purpose was by the way so that these
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:09.160]  governments could say that their deficits were less than 3% which is what
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.520]  they need to be in the eurozone but of course being the eurozone is like you
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:18.680]  know want it to be in the in the leper colony but nevertheless so you have to
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:22.640]  you have to understand that what's happening the world financial markets it
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:28.520]  would be wrong to think of this as a financial disaster first it is a crime
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:32.360]  scene and like many crime scenes where there's bleeding bodies where there's
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:36.800]  blown up buildings where there's arson and this is financial arson yeah there's
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:44.640]  destruction but it there is very to use the foggy term financial downturn big
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:49.560]  recession is missing the point what we have now is a world is is a finance
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:54.000]  community which is a crime scene because you know when I was a fraud
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.680]  investigator I mean what's what's strange to me I don't know what you know I
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:02.080]  mean I've seen the bottom I've seen some pretty bad stuff Alex after all I did
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.920]  racketeering investigations but this type of stuff we used to cuff people for I
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:12.840]  mean guys like Corzine guys like blank fine from Goldman involved me when they
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.880]  got caught in this game we used to like cuff these guys and read them their
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:19.720]  rights and walk them out of the buildings like Ivan Boski I mean Boski
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:23.040]  was this a Girl Scout compared to these guys and he didn't take down entire
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:28.480]  nations that's a question Bernie made off go to jail for only 50 75 billion or so
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:33.280]  some say 100 billion when these guys are involved in destroying and tying up
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:37.600]  trillions I mean was he kind of an outside player I mean he was the guy
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:44.920]  that and you know chemical the Nasdaq well let's not forget that made off was
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:50.320]  covering for others like Paulson okay and he had guys there were investors in
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.960]  made-offs funds who were earning 200 and 300 percent when everyone else was
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.280]  getting was getting hosed because obviously the bill a few billionaires
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:06.200]  knew so either he took the fall for them or basically the 1% of the 1% was
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:12.120]  going down he was their toy boy he was just a tool someone got that money in it
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.760]  and take a look it wasn't made off that money that money went somewhere it
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.480]  didn't just go vanish into outer space you know they say they lost the money
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:24.320]  wasn't lost believe me someone found it it went somewhere and that's and the
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:31.040]  guys who got the money are giggling are giggling okay and there were there's at
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:36.440]  least four arbitrageers that you can name who got the money from that scam so
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:41.280]  why are they giving it up only one woman yeah I mean how much confidence is
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:47.920]  this going to destroy well they'll confidence destruction because it
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:50.760]  creates more of what's called volatility in the markets which increases the
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:55.600]  value of derivatives so volatility destruction is part of the game that's
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.000]  the problem so yeah it's going to increase because what's happening just
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.880]  like the oil market where they like it bouncing up and down volatility if
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:06.320]  you're in the derivatives selling game which is the derivatives like credit
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.000]  default swaps it's like selling fire insurance but it's like arson is
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.800]  selling fire insurance the banks that are selling it like oldness so they

[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:57.760]  Greg going into break I asked the question how far will it go I understand
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:02.160]  the command destruction the volatility the insiders like volatility because it
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:07.240]  it's like a rig casino they know what's going to happen but a certain point we're
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:13.400]  now getting past you know mega minions mega gophers like Madoff up to supermenians
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:17.480]  like Corzine who then works for the Rockefeller the Rothschilds the Dutch
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:21.720]  royalty the British royalty the the Saudi royalty folks like that now we're
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:25.080]  getting up to the I mean are they just going to take everybody's money and
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:30.720]  that's just the way it is and and I guess Homeland Security standing by
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:34.720]  well I thought that there was kind of a bottom to what these guys would do but I
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:38.960]  just you know and let me be commercial reminder that my new book is vultures
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:42.360]  picnic and if go to vultures picnic org you can get some of this info
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:47.800]  including by the way that the secrets memo between Tim Geithner secretary of
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:53.440]  the Treasury and Larry Summers our economics are who should be called the
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:58.760]  you know the typhoid Mary of economics I want you to go and see that at vultures
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:03.720]  picnic org and you'll see what's going on these guys really have no bottom when
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:08.120]  you look at that that was a memo and by the way I got that memo verified by the
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.960]  head the director general the world trade organization self cuz you know my
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:16.880]  position with BBC I can get to anyone in the world basically and they verified
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:21.600]  this stuff this they don't spit these guys without asking the banks and there
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:27.640]  was Corzine's name don't there there is no financial international policy made
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:33.000]  in the United States Geithner tells Summers call Corzine this is the guy
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.760]  that just took us down for a billion bucks and believe me he ain't gonna be
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:40.560]  wearing pinstripes and ain't happening so I thought that there was a bottom till
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:44.680]  I've seen the latest documents the latest material these guys are going for broke
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:49.160]  we go broke and they clean up they set the fire in Greece and now they are
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.080]  buying up the Greek water systems the Greek ports like
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:56.800]  Feslanica you know like these are famous you know old names and you saw the film
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:01.240]  300 or something you know ancient stuff that they're buying up the beaches right
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:05.880]  so now they're moving on to Italy they're moving out to Portugal Spain you
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:08.280]  know they've tried that they're doing this thing all over the world and of
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:12.280]  course picking up oil properties absolutely everywhere you set the world
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:17.440]  on fire you have the you're the last guy standing with the cash you clean up and
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:21.560]  pick up everything at the fire sale the number one thing that's happening these
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:26.760]  so-called austerity programs that are the result of this massive volatility and
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:31.680]  explosion cost of derivatives the austerity programs begin with privatization
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:37.960]  selling off of public properties you know that man these guys to clean it up
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:42.000]  and it you know they're going to be the landlords of the planet they'll have
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.240]  everything you know we're just going to be living on their planet that's it and
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:49.840]  you can see setting up this total police state surveillance grid it's
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:54.520]  standardized worldwide and now Greg I guess they can't call people like myself
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:58.880]  a cook they admit in the time magazine Wall Street Journal financial times of
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:03.400]  London London independent London telegraph oh it's a banking dictatorship by
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:07.480]  Goldman Sachs who goes in and takes over governments and takes decades to do it
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:10.760]  and makes money on the way up with derivatives and makes money on the way
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:14.880]  down and thank God they're there running everything it's a global corporate
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.640]  government I mean wow and I guess they just think it will just go on forever
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:28.560]  Greg yeah I think one of things that we have to recognize is that I can you hear
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:39.080]  me yes sir okay sorry I was losing out there okay all right yeah I came back
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:43.360]  into you wait this is can you I'm sorry can you hear me now I just want to make
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:52.400]  sure yes go ahead Greg lose Alex all right what's happened is that the that in
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:57.960]  the cradle of democracy Greece when the president of Greece said well we should
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:03.360]  let the people vote on the bankers proposal the US and international press
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:08.800]  went completely hog nuts wild how dare you let people vote on the fate of their
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:12.520]  economy and they got rid of the elected president and they put in a guy who was a
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:16.640]  Goldman Sachs advisor completely elected the same thing happened in Italy I
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:20.400]  wasn't the fan of barrel of stony but at least he was an elected president now
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:24.920]  you have can you imagine the bankers are literally picking presidents it's it's a
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:28.960]  financial coup d'etat and and we're being told that this is a good idea
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:34.640]  because only the unelected have the guts to tell us that we have to cut you know
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:39.360]  that we have to cut government and cut well that we are old
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:42.800]  authoritarianism I want you to finish up with that talk about austerity in Greece

[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:09.320]  century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:13.520]  off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:18.680]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:23.480]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:27.840]  citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:33.120]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:37.360]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:40.920]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:46.160]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:51.840]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Yet your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:12.840]  All right, Al Kielts here on the road back in Austin tomorrow about to have a
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:18.400]  marathon drive back. Greg Palast, former and federal organized crime
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:23.760]  racketeering investigator turned journalist with BBC ABC News best-selling
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:28.800]  author joins us and don't forget right now they're trying to blame us for the
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:32.000]  guy that shot up the White House who's schizophrenic who thinks he's the Christ
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.760]  reportedly because he supposedly watched the Obama deception a year ago at the
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:41.120]  party so we got to restrict that free speech boy let me tell you be sure and
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:44.480]  get that film out to everybody as well because it doesn't really it gets into
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:48.120]  Obama but it shows how he's just a teleprompter reader for the big mega banks
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:51.840]  and derivatives kingpins bankrupting the planet now I'm gonna go to your calls
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:56.280]  Frank Kyle, Lenin Craig, Tom and others here in just a moment but let me just go
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:59.680]  back to what Greg's saying and give him about five minutes of the floor to
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:08.280]  really flesh this out understand I have heard Bloomberg radio I have heard you
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:13.280]  name it as CNBC I say heard because I listen to them on XM I don't watch a
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:17.560]  bunch of TV but I listen to TV on radio I have heard them all in the last few
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:21.840]  months demonized freedom demonized people being able to vote anywhere in
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:25.880]  Europe demonize the Germans who might not want to go along with bankrolling all
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:30.800]  of this I've seen them demonized and I've heard them with with assurance say
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:34.880]  don't worry they'll do the right thing with the European bureaucracy it's
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.480]  got expert you know bankers in there from Goldman Sachs they know what to do
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:42.480]  and they sell it like Europe's falling apart because none of them ever work
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:47.080]  or they're lazy idiots and they're all just sitting around drinking coffee all
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:52.960]  day or you know sopping up olive oil on their you know bag heads these people
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.360]  they're not doing anything yeah look look at Europe folks look at the
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:35:02.040]  production look what they built that's a lie okay that's a lie so so continuing
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:09.120]  I've done the math but they've admitted this Iceland 91% of the debt not out by
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:13.160]  the people they said no for over a year finally got the documents turned out it
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:17.880]  was all basically the bank's own debt that they've got their own operatives in
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:23.400]  government to sign on to same thing in Ireland same thing in Greece and it's
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:28.920]  so over the top that the criminals that engineered the derivative fraud get the
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:33.960]  government's to sign on to it and then spin golly it that oh this is me this is
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:37.920]  because you've got you know you know too many weeks off a year and because your
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:42.280]  Social Security is too big I've always been against big government because then
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.280]  they hold people hostage for the benefits and steal most of it but then
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:50.280]  people still back the stealing because they've been made dependent that's why
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:54.400]  I've always been against it but the point is tens of trillions of taxpayer
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:58.960]  money backing up these derivatives in bailouts you never hear that discussed
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:03.720]  all you hear by the fake neocons is how this is great free market and anybody
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:09.040]  that doesn't like the bailouts is a commie no no the fascistic groups are up
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:13.200]  there using the public's wealth and fake privatization pushed by fake
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:18.360]  libertarians it's not privatization Dan Rhodes over for nothing to a foreign
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:22.800]  corporation like Centra so they can slap toll roads on it at five times what
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:28.160]  it's worth gang raping you financially Greg Palace explained to them what
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:32.880]  austerity means in Argentina in in in all these formerly wealthy countries
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:37.040]  moving over to Europe what's coming what they're going to do because we've seen
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:42.720]  this handbook before what is austerity before we go to these calls okay well
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:47.280]  we saw it in in Argentina and by the way I checked the inside documents I got
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:49.880]  from the IMF the World Bank worked with the big banks I checked it with Joe
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:54.520]  Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize in economics and was the chief economist
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:58.600]  the World Bank he's got to come out of the cold he verified this stuff is real
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:01.800]  they had planned in that there's going to be that that they were going to squeeze
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:05.320]  down the people take away as you say their benefits and you know kick up the
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:10.640]  price of of food and we ended up with riots in Argentina the riots allowed
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:14.800]  for for a repression that's what they want they want the riots so the tanks
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:19.320]  can roll it's in the plan and when I say I don't say that stuff lightly Alex I
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:25.680]  put this stuff at the top the BBC nightly news no they're very very yeah
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:30.640]  they write the riot into document Joe Stiglitz called the IMF riot and he said
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:34.000]  it was right there they because they want that right so then they bring in the
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.800]  tanks and then they impose the so-called austerity what does austerity mean
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.880]  means they cut all your government benefits they take the money out of
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.840]  your pension funds this is not about whether you think government pension
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:46.000]  funds are a good idea this is about looting them whether it's good or bad
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.240]  they get looted okay that's let's keep in mind what this is about a lot of so-called
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:52.920]  conservatives are going to say correct just briefly oh good cut off the welfare
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:57.640]  queen folks there they took Gerald Salente's account that was his they're
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:02.840]  going to rob everyone and they're gonna not send the welfare queen the money
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:06.320]  they're gonna riot and burn the cities and then they're gonna use that to take
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:12.160]  everybody's liberty this is a blueprint listen to Greg Paulus yes so then what
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:14.840]  they did they started selling off everything in sight they had a state
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:19.240]  oil company which is bought by the Spanish Spanish Repsol now we did a
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:23.280]  calculation with some other economists and if the Spanish if the Argentine
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:28.040]  government had never been forced to basically give away their massive oil
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:34.360]  fields and oil company they'd be they would right now have no debt at all but
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:38.120]  instead they were they were gun to their head they gave up the oil company they
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:43.960]  sold the Buenos Aires oil system excuse me water system was water system to Enron
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:48.200]  to Enron had a water unit and of course the first thing Enron did was jack up
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:52.920]  water prices 400% and then there was no water and then of course Enron
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:57.560]  evaporates with with the water money of course that's the game that's being
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:02.760]  played they ruined this there were doctors I was getting calls from
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:07.440]  Argentina I knew some doctors and teachers who were hunting in the alleys
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:13.080]  and garbage cans looking for food until they said enough and the people stood up
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.680]  and democratically elected a leader we saw this in Ecuador where they were
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:21.360]  ruined and then the Indians came out of the hills burning the town's starving
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:25.720]  starving and in Ecuador in Brazil and Argentina they said enough they elected
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:32.220]  officials who just told these financial jackals you may not operate here stick
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:36.800]  your your so-called the debts and get out of here and they reverse the
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:41.040]  privatizations they took back their own oil companies kept the wealth for
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:45.680]  themselves and now Brazil Ecuador Argentina these are the economies that
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:48.960]  are growing at 8% a year these these economies are booming because they told
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:51.960]  the jackals to get the hell out and and I gotta tell you in Brazil I've got a
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:40:00.560]  document from the European community and our endorsed by our secretary of
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:06.240]  state which is a plan to fight to destroy the Brazilian economy through a trade
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:12.480]  war because Brazil refuses to accept derivatives trades from JP Morgan JP
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:16.920]  Morgan wants to operate in Brazil the Brazilian government said we don't allow
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:21.520]  toxic financial assets we don't allow gambling with banking money and the US
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:24.480]  and the European community have now said well you know what if you don't let in
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:28.720]  these bankers with their toxic assets if you don't decriminalize your banking
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:31.920]  system like we've done we're not going to buy your orange juice so I can buy your
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:35.840]  ethanol we're gonna just wipe you out and I have to say that Brazil stood
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:41.120]  strong on this they said you know what go ahead do you know make our day and
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:45.880]  they have been growing at 8% a year they are booming and they just say you
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:52.640]  know you know you we're not inviting we're not inviting disease in here
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:56.240]  including financial diseases you know and that's but now in Europe that
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:00.760]  they're not doing that they're letting the if you read vultures picnic the
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:04.200]  chapter called the generalism of globalization you can see in fact the
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:07.120]  vulturespictic.org you can see a little film called the generalism of
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:10.680]  globalization where I'm in the room with the head of WTO and we're going over
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:14.200]  these documents these inside documents and he is saying well yeah he's trying
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:16.920]  to explain them away of course there's always an explanation Alex there's always
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:21.840]  an explanation the Frenchman is sitting there going we are not the evil cabal
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:25.000]  of bankers well he's head of credit me and a is the biggest French bank you
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.480]  know so it's not a cabal but if they're just secretly meeting and burning down
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:32.920]  the world for us in Europe the people are not standing up but each of these
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:36.880]  nations has two political major parties the Socialist Party the Christian
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:41.400]  Democratic Party of each nation they're all hand-in-hand you can't put a you
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:45.200]  know stick a dime between these two parties and they're all completely mobbed
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:50.360]  up with the banks like Goldman you know both Greek parties conducted this fraud
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:55.080]  with Goldman Sachs both of them they're both dirty on this so when it came up
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:59.240]  for when there was a panic that the God forbid the Greek people should be allowed
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:03.120]  to vote in the cradle of democracy the two parties which are involved in the
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:09.040]  fraud said no no no vote we're just gonna pick this golden consultant to be the
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.560]  president the guys doesn't even live in Greece he's from the he's from the states
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.680]  he's an American you know I mean it's ridiculous you know and out of care if
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:20.800]  he's American or Greek or whatever he is he's a banker and he's not elected and
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:24.840]  you know they a fear democracy but I'm telling you that what happened if you
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:29.480]  read Vulture's picnic in I met with the president of Ecuador about this he's an
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:31.960]  economist by the way he taught at University of Illinois he said I'm not
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:36.680]  gonna let these jackals rip our country apart I you know I showed him the
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:40.400]  documents from the IMF he said I thought this was happening I thought there was a
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:45.240]  conspiracy here it is he made those documents public in Ecuador our state
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:49.240]  department went completely wild over him doing that but he said you know what I
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:54.520]  see the documents now you guys take your bankers and and go fly and his economy
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:58.960]  is soaring they were right there Greg incredible info and I want to go to
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:01.520]  collars but obviously we're gonna have to get you back up in the next week or
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:05.000]  two because there's so much to cover and I want to get into how we beat these
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.360]  people perhaps as we take a few calls and and and where you see things going if
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:14.920]  we don't stand up against them but going back to what you just pointed out to
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:19.640]  hear so-called media in the United States especially the financial news
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:27.400]  actually demonizing anybody who is for the people running their own
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:31.480]  governments and admitting it's a new government where bankers are appointed
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:36.160]  over your country and then now it's not even an issue that shows you what they
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:39.640]  want to set up here with the super committees and everything else it is a
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:45.760]  hundred percent pure confirmation of just how dangerous this system is Greg
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:48.520]  yeah where's the super committee in the Constitution I thought we're supposed to
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:52.400]  elect our Congress I mean I didn't vote for no super committee did you I don't
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.760]  remember them on the ballot I mean what is this new thing that now let's turn
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:01.720]  over we're now going to be turning over our finances to unelected committees
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:08.480]  groups you know it's it's deeply dangerous it's deeply dangerous and
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:13.040]  it's financially destructive the nations which chose democracy in Latin
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:18.760]  America are financially economically soaring the nations which have chose
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:27.920]  breakers dictatorship are dying the issue is this is in our face the
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:32.200]  Constitution says bills come out of the house introduced by individual members
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:35.920]  and they go through a committee process now they take six house six Senate and
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:39.880]  the president say we don't need that and now they're gonna run the farm bill and
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:44.120]  now they've got the Pentagon and Homeland Security running the rural affairs and
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:47.920]  now they're suddenly federal police everywhere running the occupied tax
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:52.200]  let's go to calls but I want to get your get your take after that on those
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:55.880]  subjects Greg Palace investigative journalist is our guest Frank in Canada
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:57.240]  thanks for holding her on the air
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:01.960]  hey good afternoon gentlemen just two questions if I may please first of all
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:06.320]  with regards to to the markets I mean the markets are predicated on a certain
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:10.400]  amount of stability and if we've taken a look at you know the artificially low
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:14.640]  interest rates and quantitative easing as a kind of artificial way to prop up
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:20.000]  the market then wouldn't this be counter to that top 1% that owns 80% of the
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.360]  wealth and assets in the markets would this not serve basically counter to
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:29.000]  productive to their interest they want to keep the quantitative easing in to
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.600]  prop up the general market so they can control the ups and downs and siphon off
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:38.160]  money because they're involved in total insider accounting level of fraud it's
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:44.160]  total insider it's beyond insider Greg do you concur with that well yeah I mean
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:48.320]  take a look at that when you talk about the very low interest rates that's what
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:52.000]  they're borrowing now we're borrowing at they are borrowing at the Fed window in
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.080]  some cases that actually negative interest rate but roughly normally about
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:58.680]  a quarter percent interest is what the big banks are paying 100% basically
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:03.800]  nothing and then they are lending to us look at your credit card rates here at
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:08.320]  29% in some cases look at what they're charging the European Union they're
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:13.080]  they're charging Italy like 9% interest and they're getting it at a quarter
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:19.480]  percent interest the spread is insane look at how they're moving to get rid
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:23.280]  of our credit rating you'll guide her saying it never happened knowing that
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:26.960]  we're planning it they're maneuvering us just like a third-world country in the
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:32.560]  complete receivership well yeah and what's happening is that we have to so
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:38.080]  we are lending them money at a quarter percent and then we're borrowing it back
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:42.600]  at massive interest rates I mean what keep in mind that the banks today are
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:46.080]  holding a trillion and a half US banks are holding more than trillion and a
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:51.160]  half dollars in cash assets what the heck is going on that's our money we
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:55.480]  guarantee their fiat currency that they loan it back to us at interest Frank does
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:58.680]  that answer your question what's your other one it does thank you and another
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:02.560]  question for both you gentlemen please with regards to the Occupy movement no
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:06.920]  matter what we may think about that on its effective as they're not mr. Salente
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:11.640]  you know eluded to something a few days ago which I think you know maybe a way
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:16.600]  of looking at this he was talking about the idea of a boycott that if we if we
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:21.480]  just buy local or in fact in many cases not support the system by either a
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:25.480]  withdrawing our funds from the economic system yeah that's just one of the
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:29.920]  defense says yeah just buying staples and then taking the money out of the
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:34.080]  financial system the way we know it I mean that that would cause the so-called
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:37.880]  elites a lot of infighting wouldn't you gentlemen agree or briefly get
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:41.520]  solution ideas from Greg and we'll go to Kyle and others quickly quickly
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:47.160]  what our selection and particularly how about this true local sustainability I
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:51.280]  mean it's not even so much a solution it's a survival tactic we're gonna have
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:58.040]  to do this well I think the first simple step is most most of America in
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:01.960]  places of Texas California New York have community credit unions these are not
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:07.440]  for profit banks that by law must loan all their money into the community move
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:11.680]  your money there don't buy don't feed the snakes that bite you I have my money
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:18.240]  at the at the New York Community Credit Union Lowryside People's Federal they
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:22.400]  were the ones that by the way are occupy Wall Street's banker and they're the
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:26.080]  ones that Goldman Sachs is trying to shut down because they're there so that's
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:30.880]  the interesting thing these guys like Goldman and Capital One is gone on a
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:34.680]  war path against the community credit unions which means that they're probably
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:38.080]  a very good idea a good place to put your money they're safe and they're
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:44.880]  insured there and they loan into the community they do not do their prohibitive
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:49:01.880]  instead of just being even in local banks I'm gonna move mainly into credit unions with the info wars piggy bank thank you Frank Kyle in Oregon got quick question go ahead Kyle thanks for calling sounds like somebody's vacuuming or something Kyle
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:15.520]  you for so much to relate to you in terms of the biggest threat you know to our

[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:47.840]  investigative journalists ever I'm gonna ask my question I'd like to just add a
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:54.640]  comment go ahead off that off that first question about the interest rates this
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:59.080]  is a corporate takeover there's no other reason for the destabilizing of
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:03.880]  governments and nation-states corporations are taking over they're
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:07.960]  doing it by a decrease in interest rate Bernanke's decreasing the value of the
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:13.960]  dollar to increase exports that's what he says of course we have no exports you
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:18.360]  don't have to get away with that you guys know that they're taking this system
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:23.360]  down pillar by pillar excuse me they're taking they're doing they're killing two
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:27.960]  birds at one stone they're consolidating the power slowly and in the cover of
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:32.320]  darkness this MF global reminds me of Lehman this time it's the hedge fund
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.800]  collapse look for Jeffries and black rock finally agree with you what's your
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:40.040]  question for Greg's you can answer when we come back from break it's a very
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:43.960]  broad question mr. Paulist where are we going more specifically what will
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:48.680]  finance and the economy look like in the future well that depends on these
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:52.880]  people win but yeah let's look to the future with Greg Palace straight ahead

[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:17.080]  gorgeous I love this for a public no wonder the globalist want to bankrupt it
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:21.840]  and steal all the private property raise property taxes and siphon that out
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:25.880]  through county and city investments to be stolen by the globalist Greg Palis is
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:28.760]  our guest in this little five-minute segment the next five-minute segment
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:32.880]  and we've got a lot of news and key analysis with Aaron Dykes coming up in
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:37.360]  the third hour today Greg that's pretty much the same question I asked earlier
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:42.080]  but you didn't get to answer because we ran out of time going into a break what
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:49.560]  is the financial future going to look like a if we're able to just imprison
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:54.280]  these guys and turn this around or be if they just have their way and keep
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:59.600]  driving forward or is it gonna be a mix of the two I mean is is Argentina the
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:05.720]  type of situation we're looking at well it's kind of up to us in the case of
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:09.680]  Argentina things hit rock bottom as they did in Ecuador people you know like I
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:13.480]  say teachers eating out of garbage cans so people went into the streets banging
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:16.880]  pots and pans and saying that they weren't gonna work it's all done they
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:21.720]  they have to eat and democracy took over in the economy sword they told the banks
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:25.720]  to go buzz off and that's that I mean that and the guy is screaming about it
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:29.440]  by the way the number one you know my book vultures picnic the number one
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:33.240]  vulture finance here in America is guiding Paul Singer by the way he was
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:38.480]  just named as Mitt Romney's top economic advisor hello so what's gonna
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:41.720]  happen and that doesn't mean that Obama is going to be a better choice because
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:48.000]  his top economic advisor is Robert Rubin you know city bank and they got
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.120]  both parties I just wanted to make it official tell you it's a fish yes well
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:57.400]  now that the Uber the uber vulture who is screaming bloody murder about
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:56:02.200]  Argentina telling the banks telling him to take his bonds and fly with them the
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:07.520]  vulture Ecuador did the same thing and you know cuz democracy took hold it was
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:10.840]  pretty painful people went into the streets were burning down the capital
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:14.360]  the Indians came out of the mountains but they said we're gonna vote our way
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:19.080]  to freedom we're not going to you know we're not going to say oh we'll just
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:23.080]  turn over the banks because we know how difficult it is we are out of control we
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:26.680]  spend too much money and the money really should go to the bankers but
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:32.080]  unfortunately I see in Europe there seems to be no organized dissenting force
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:40.200]  and so where is America are we going to be maybe this is good maybe this is
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:44.960]  good to let them go all the way and really show people what Bankster global
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:48.400]  is tearing he is before people finally wake up we'll take another call here
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:53.000]  Craig in Connecticut you're on the air with Greg Palace go ahead Craig great
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:58.120]  thanks Alex and hi Greg how are you quick question for you you could be doing
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:03.960]  a lot of analogies to the case with Madoff to MF global I think one key
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:08.080]  difference that I'm seeing right now is that the trustee Irving Picard for the
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:13.840]  for the bankruptcy with Madoff he's been doing a phenomenal job in tracing the
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:18.320]  assets where they went clawing them back from people who had the sweetheart
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:22.320]  deals do you guys have any insight in terms of the trustee that's that's here
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:26.560]  is he a globalist is the trustee to be trusted you know if you know it's all
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:31.000]  going to talk to Salente and others and now two three weeks into this they're
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.720]  saying we're not going to discuss where the money is and you're just you know
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:39.240]  not going to get it back but then we saw that kind of reverse with the CMT group
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:43.480]  come in and in dump 300 million in but that's not going to satisfy people
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:48.040]  because this is a lot bigger amount Greg Palace
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:53.280]  well actually that's one of the things I'm very concerned about is who exactly
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:57.720]  is going to be on top of this ship there's two types of trustees you're
[01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:01.440]  right Picard at the on the Madoff deal I think he's he shocked everyone but
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:04.160]  actually saying wait a minute there's some guys you got some sweetheart deals
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:06.920]  and he's trying to claw him back he doesn't have much legal authority to do
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:11.920]  that just keep in mind and he's only been only one of the big billionaires has
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:15.000]  given back the money actually the guy who died his wife gave it back and she
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.800]  didn't want blood money but in the case of MF global I'm worried we're going to
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:22.640]  end up with something like the BP situation where the number where the
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:28.040]  trustees this guy Ken Feinberg who's usually uses their big trustee and he's
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:33.600]  known otherwise known as the reptile now when they stay there let's hear about
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:37.520]  the reptile on the other side great question caller great question from
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:40.560]  Craig more calls for it

[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:56.600]  something else was shown in their poll we'll tell you about that coming up
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:01:03.080]  Ron Paul is number one in one category we'll tell you about that coming up we've
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:09.200]  commissioned polls before I should do another Zogby or something finishing you
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:12.760]  were talking about Greg can answer the callers question
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:23.480]  was asking about the the individual charged with doling out the funds from
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:28.280]  the bankruptcy and we were saying that you do know the MO on this guy well I
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:33.200]  mean what I'm saying is that this guy's halfway in between there was a very the
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:40.600]  the very good one the card at handling the Madoff deal but he still he has no
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:44.000]  real power he hasn't been able to get any real money except from one of the
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.120]  billionaires widows because guy died but the other the other thieves are still
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:52.360]  holding on and saying that's your tough problem buddy then there's the trustee
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:57.320]  like we have on BP Ken Feinberg known as the reptile right Obama made a big deal
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:00.720]  all I've got 20 billion dollars for you the guy hasn't even handed out five and
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:05.000]  that's always gonna give out they made sure that deal was cut that deal was
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.680]  cut to make sure the people on the Gulf got shafted read I have a section by
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:13.720]  the call Mr. Fairness in go Vultures picnic I say when the energy finance
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:17.560]  combine needs a screwdriver needs us needs to screw the public they hire a
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:22.080]  screwdriver and the Wall Street Journal calls it Mr. Fairness that's the type of
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:28.080]  guy you get now this guy Giddens who is handling the MF the the the Corzine
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:34.880]  operation he handled Lehman brothers and I can tell you has someone who had
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:39.080]  some Lehman in my in my pension fund I ain't seen it because one thing he
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:44.760]  didn't do is that one of the that Barclays literally stole about eight
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:48.640]  billion dollars in the collat and the day of the collapse of Lehman brothers
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:52.640]  just cut off eight billion dollars in securities and I haven't seen this guy
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:57.760]  say hey guys excuse me that eight billion eight years could you please put it back
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:05.520]  see that's incredible I don't trust this guy to do anything even private ones
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:10.760]  like yours and somehow this is free market and beautiful this is criminality
[02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:14.840]  and just because they've got most the regulators in their pockets I don't see
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:19.600]  them being invincible in the final equation and wouldn't the world be a
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:24.120]  better place without this how many of these vultures are there I mean isn't
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:27.680]  there just a couple hundred top ones I don't rough top former head of the
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:34.120]  Kissinger group said there's six thousand superclass that's about right I
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:38.280]  would say in vultures picnic that that there's about two dozen really top
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:44.000]  guys like this guy singer who is worth about four billion bucks who's now the
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:49.160]  Romney top economic advisors this is what we want and and again I don't want to
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:52.360]  say it's it's just the Republicans because you got the you got the the
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:56.920]  deregulators that decriminalizes like Robert Rubin who really ran the show
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:04:02.080]  and still is a shadow force directing the philosophy of Obama Rubin bankrupted
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:05.840]  Citibank and got a hundred and ten million dollar bonus for it you know so
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:09.440]  I would say you know you know if you if you look in vultures pick that you get
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:13.000]  kind of list I actually want people to get to actually get the names of these
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.760]  guys and see how they operate rather than just talk about the general class
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:22.520]  TV but of course you're not this information though is getting out to
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:25.880]  the alternative media that is more and more becoming the dominant media and
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:29.360]  that's why they're now moving in with all these attacks on free speech that's
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:33.160]  why they're acclimating us that not only torture is good but getting rid of free
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:37.200]  speech in America is good and getting rid of voting in Europe is good it's
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:41.440]  truly an attempt to convert us into a global corporate dictatorship Greg

[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:37.040]  edition we've got the final 52 minutes of this worldwide broadcast today I'll be
[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:43.120]  back in Austin tomorrow afternoon I'm about to pull up stakes here and my
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:47.320]  investigation and boy we discovered a lot out here just amazing be back in
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:51.080]  central Texas soon enough joining you via phone normally on the road I'd be
[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:55.520]  joining you with crystal clear skype but here in the high desert the internet is
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:09:01.120]  pretty much non-existent we are going to get to Tom Patrick O'Brien Kyle Mike and
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:06.400]  others I'm gonna eject here in about 10 minutes in hand the baton over to Aaron
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:14.920]  Dykes in full wars dot com video editor researcher and host also the nightly news
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:18.920]  we're gonna also right now some of the other news developments that have
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:21.720]  unfolded but the bottom of the hour he'll go to your calls for those of you
[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:27.480]  holding and then interspersed from the other news I've not covered yet but Gary
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:33.880]  Franchi restore the Republic doing an amazing job he of course also hosts the
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:39.520]  reality report I think it's twice a week on television Gary Franchi contacted
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:43.240]  this morning he's conducted his own poll he's gone out and hired a polling
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:46.760]  company anybody can do this and I think it's a great idea to actually hire
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:51.000]  companies and then ask real questions quite hard beside me though they wouldn't
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:54.520]  even let me ask the questions I particularly wanted to ask that's how
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:10:01.440]  political these groups are but what Franchi found basically integrates in
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:06.480]  with what other scientific polls have found but he asked another question that
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:10.560]  hasn't been asked when he asked the question about who would you you know
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:17.440]  vote for it was Herman Cain and then in Iowa and then of course it was Ron Paul
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:21.320]  and that's what a poll showed last week he's number two same thing in New
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:25.000]  Hampshire he's not just number number number three he's number two they've
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.400]  been desperately ignoring him or he'd be number one he's the doctor with the
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:33.600]  medicine this Republic needs he's a historian he's an economist he's a
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:37.640]  doctor he's got the facts he predicted everything that was going to happen
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:42.680]  through history through understanding but Franchi had another question asked as
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:48.680]  well so here joining us to go over that and Aaron Dyches with us also and we'll
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:52.320]  continue the interview after I leave with Gary Franchi is Gary Franchi
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:56.680]  Gary tell us how you did the poll who did it and read the folks breaking it
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:00.840]  here I appreciate you doing that we'll get an article out and I would imagine
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:03.400]  folks are gonna be interested to see it we'll be sure to link to your final
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:06.880]  organization and what you're doing the great ads you're producing are some of
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:10.840]  the best fact even better than some of the Ron Paul campaign official stuff I've
[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:15.480]  seen with your super pack you're certainly kicking globalist tail so so
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:24.600]  tell us about the new poll breaking here well last week Bloomberg was the
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:30.320]  big story that there was a dead heat in Iowa well this week things have
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:35.040]  completely changed what we've been able to discover through an independent
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:39.280]  polling company called tele-research out of Indiana
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:48.000]  that's a respected group please continue so what we discovered was not only is
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:53.720]  there a three-way dead heat for the lead among Republicans we factored in we
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:58.600]  asked the pollers we asked the people taking the poll if you were Republicans
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:03.560]  or independence and if they would actually reelect Obama now if they said
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:07.240]  no we said okay well then would you consider voting in the Republican
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:13.040]  caucus and if you did who would you vote for Ron Paul came in overwhelming over
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:21.400]  the top with a four-point lead over common case okay that means the margin of
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:26.720]  error was three percent so even if the worst-case scenario Ron Paul is one
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:32.080]  point lead best case scenario seven point lead in Iowa there is a by the way
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:36.560]  I got to stop you this this integrates in with national polls showing Ron Paul
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:40.920]  dead heat or three to five points there's a spectrum of scientific polls
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:46.720]  Zogby Gallup you name it he's either dead heat or three four or five points
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:50.520]  ahead of Obama when they run those two head up against each other this is a
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:57.720]  big news please continue so basically Ron Paul leads at 25% with an
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:03.320]  approximate four-point advantage over Gingrich and Herman Cain okay now
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:08.440]  there is another question that we asked we said look I want to know where the
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:12.840]  national security concerns are of the people of Iowa you know as you know
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:16.960]  tonight there is the same end debate about national security that's the whole
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:22.720]  purpose so we asked this question we said where where where do your concerns
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:29.040]  lie Iran China Russia Iraq you know and one one of the answers was
[02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:37.520]  interventionist foreign policy that came in at what am I know about 25% of all
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:42.400]  respondents said that interventions foreign policy is the greatest threat to
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:51.960]  national security Alex it's a big story to give us the poll first so I do
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:55.480]  believe I'm not there I'm in southern Utah but I believe we have the poll
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:59.080]  there so we're gonna try to put that on screen or if Aaron has it there in
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:03.760]  studio we can zoom in on that Gary start at the top of the poll and just read
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:07.960]  through the results again tell folks the company and then and then run through
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:12.760]  this breaking news here well basically the company was tell a research corporation
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:17.320]  out of Indiana and what you're getting Alex you're getting the early results
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:22.120]  we're gonna have a full spectrum detailed analysis of the whole breakdown of
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:26.720]  the survey tomorrow we haven't even had time to digest all the results but the
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:30.640]  horse race questions are in the foreign policy questions are in and the
[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:36.400]  definitive data comes back Ron Paul is the leading candidate and he is going to
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:41.800]  take Iowa because of the crossover no other candidates Alex no other candidates
[02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:47.320]  have crossover appeal Ron Paul is the only candidate that can actually take
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:53.560]  votes from Obama incredible a spay Aaron has the and why did they saw me that's
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:56.760]  how it was the one day I got the big first general ones and then I got all
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:15:01.640]  these this whole booklet of detailed breakdowns and women this men that black
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:06.200]  Hispanic Native American I mean yeah they break it down just into ridiculous
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:10.440]  minutia for the focus groups and people and see we're doing what the big guys do
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:14.000]  we're going out and doing our own polls I should do more of this I'm glad
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:19.400]  Francis doing it I've got to this for Ron Paul back in the last election four
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:24.160]  years ago so great job I think it cost us $5,000 but this is you know really gets
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:30.760]  the word out but Aaron's got it Aaron read that preliminary data that or not
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:34.440]  implement or that that that first run of data with the big horse race questions
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:41.440]  read that on there I have says new Iowa poll places Ron Paul firmly in first with
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:47.760]  25% congressman Ron Paul is leading by a significant margin in Iowa according to
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:53.600]  results from a new tele-research poll Revolution pack supported the presidential
[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:58.200]  candidate Ron Paul by conducting the poll and it gets into how disaffected
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:02.640]  Democrats and independents were also included in the poll with a very large
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:07.560]  sample size of 2,900 I believe the standard polls only use a thousand
[02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:13.360]  normally Alex thousand one yeah and that includes also in this 2,900 samples
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:21.120]  700 likely Republican caucus goers so that is an across-the-boards sampling of
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:24.200]  the Iowa voters I want to be specific though
[02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:30.600]  Frenchy Gary Frenchy joining us for for the Republic org to be clear you did
[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:34.720]  poll Republicans by themselves then you did a general poll and found he was
[02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:39.280]  even over the top he's in a dead heat with Republicans not second place dead
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:43.480]  heat but we now know other side of a poll they claim he's second place that's how
[02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:47.960]  they spin them our own internal info shows he's way over the top is number
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:53.960]  one but you're saying Republicans he is dead heat but you're saying that with
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:59.120]  across the board he's winning yeah just to be clear restore the Republic did not
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:02.760]  commission the poll it was the super pack about the revolution pack that
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:05.960]  commissioned the poll plug-in the fact that you also run restore the
[02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:11.160]  Republic yeah and what what's interesting here is that like you just
[02:17:11.160 --> 02:17:15.200]  noted thousand is generally that the sample looks up sample size we went
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:22.640]  beyond that we got almost 20 2,900 actual respondents we we've actually
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:27.560]  significantly won up to the Bloomberg survey because we have actually more
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:33.760]  Republican caucus goers and we like you just mentioned we asked we had a jump
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:39.160]  question that asked those those affected Democrats and independents who they
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:42.680]  would then vote for if they were to participate and like I said the
[02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:46.680]  overwhelming response Ron Paul with the crossover vote if the Republicans
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:50.480]  need to hear this they need to pay attention to these numbers if it's a
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:54.080]  party game and they want to play a party game and they really want to win this is
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:57.540]  the man his name is Ron Paul he can take it all the way to the White House and
[02:17:57.540 --> 02:18:02.360]  he can restore this Republic and he can bring back Liberty America Alex absolutely
[02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:07.680]  and look folks we need to help Ron Paul he can't get it all done himself and I'm
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:12.000]  glad you've done the scientific poll I see the headline now at info wars com
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:23.080]  scientific poll Ron Paul Ron Paul beats Obama in general election in tie or in
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:29.160]  dead heat with with with with Cain and Gennrich I mean that's it

[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:36.020]  tomorrow on his way back we thought we still had Gary Franchi but he will be
[02:24:36.020 --> 02:24:41.760]  popping in later on the infowars nightly news tonight and it's a very
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:46.160]  interesting poll he's conducted we've done this before at Alex's office as he
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:51.120]  mentioned with Zogby back in the 2008 when Ron Paul really did have a name
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:57.200]  recognition issue thus we did a blind biography poll and Ron Paul did very
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:02.280]  well better than and many national polls based on a reading of his credentials
[02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:05.920]  and the rest of it what I found interesting though was a personal
[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:11.520]  insight into how political these polls become even though they are scientifically
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:15.840]  crafted in that case I specifically remember whoever had written the
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:20.480]  biography for Mitt Romney it was written very loaded it called him a hero of the
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:24.880]  Olympics and and really praised him in ways that it didn't praise the other
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:29.040]  candidates at a time when Mitt Romney was topping all those polls even though
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:33.680]  that didn't play out whatsoever in the 2008 so-called elections which are
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:38.000]  obviously manipulated behind the scenes so it's encouraging that Ron Paul is
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:43.600]  showing up in a more balanced poll that surveys not only likely Republican
[02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:47.920]  caucus goers but the quote-unquote disaffected independents and Democrats
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:52.920]  and that's really what they always try to sell is the crossover mainstream middle
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:57.560]  of the road appeal between both parties saying that someone too far to the
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:02.640]  right or left would marginalize in a general election but Ron Paul is a
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:07.480]  different kind of candidate he's out of the box of that strictly left right line
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:13.320]  paradigm system largely because of his national and international foreign
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:17.080]  policy issues well domestic policy and international and especially his
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:21.480]  understanding of economic issues he really has the cloud in this issue and
[02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:26.160]  it's interesting that so many people would identify with the interventionist
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:29.920]  foreign policy as part of the major problem of course it is elections are
[02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:35.320]  never run on moral issues but if you have moral issues in the race certainly
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:41.440]  our great expenditure and our wanton killing overseas is not something we
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:45.880]  want to be engaged in and all the other candidates particularly in both parties
[02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:51.280]  well particularly in both parties that is are totally online with going along
[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:54.720]  with all the globalist intervention recommendations you've heard people like
[02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:59.320]  Herman Cain and the debates identifying how he would simply go along with his
[02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:04.280]  advisors people like Henry Kissinger he talks to behind the scenes Mitt Romney
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:07.760]  totally part of the system ready to go along with the war against Iran or
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:11.840]  whomever and that really goes for almost all the candidates certainly you've
[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:17.200]  seen President Obama expanding into more and more adventurous territories
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:23.720]  overseas even as the Arab Spring unfolded and blossomed into tyrannies
[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:29.360]  everywhere and wars in many places so we hope that doesn't continue to grow now
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:33.040]  we are going to take your calls on the other side of this break I want to give
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:38.880]  the number out right now it's 1-800-259-9231 but right now we'll go
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:44.520]  ahead and go to Tom in Arizona are you there Tom great show those polls were
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:50.280]  wonderful news my comment is from your previous guest Greg tell you that I
[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:54.120]  used to work as a broker for one of the top three commercial banks back in the
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:59.720]  late 90s and early 2000s after we had a big merger the new company came in with
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:04.080]  a new option for your 401k if you kept the old one you'd have the same
[02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:08.160]  investment options however you would lose some of the benefits such as taking a
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:11.400]  loan against the 401k and that sort of thing however if you went to the new
[02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:14.880]  one they restored all the benefits in other words you could take a loan
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:19.360]  against your 401k the same investment options your statement would reflect
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:25.200]  those investments however by going to the new one the bank was then had the
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:32.880]  rights to take those funds and invest it any way they wanted to my opinion they
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:39.920]  leveraged everything this is no different than Bernie made off right yeah
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:45.560]  go ahead and the other thing I think your listeners need to know is who is
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:50.120]  Finra the regulatory agency over your broker over MF global in the whole works
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:54.720]  who are supposed to see oversee all this if you go to glue Google and bring
[02:28:54.720 --> 02:29:02.960]  from and look to see what the panel is Finra regulatory agency it's a board
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:07.840]  member of people from Wall Street who are regular who are regulating
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:14.320]  themselves that's why this stuff is happening they are protecting the big
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:18.360]  institutions your little broker is not allowed to do what these big brokers can
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:23.640]  do these big institutions and they in my opinion they're going to keep you in
[02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:28.160]  these markets and they're going to keep selling you short naked short selling
[02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:34.240]  you and it's just fraud all the way around I agree it's animal behavior
[02:29:34.240 --> 02:29:37.520]  coming up on the break I'll let you get a final word in on the other side but
[02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:41.920]  yeah I know we talked to William K. Black interviewed him for Obama deception
[02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:45.640]  and follow the Republic he talked about Bush calling off all the regulators
[02:29:45.640 --> 02:29:50.280]  apparently Obama has gone even further stay tuned more calls ahead and we'll
[02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:56.080]  get into where on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN

[02:32:58.040 --> 02:33:05.040]  others don't
[02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:35.320]  the last two decades have really seen the gates of hell open up financially in
[02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:39.400]  terms of breaking down the wall of Glass-Steagall that separated commercial
[02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:43.640]  and investment banking and it's just gotten progressively worse from there
[02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:48.320]  there are numerous presidents and on this deterioration of regulation
[02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:55.760]  including both Bush's Clinton and Obama himself and I know that after 9-11 Bush
[02:33:55.760 --> 02:34:00.560]  reportedly had according to the expert on the matter William K. Black he had a
[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:05.040]  very significant portion of the regulators called off from investigating
[02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:09.880]  financial fraud particularly on places like Wall Street and the related spheres
[02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:15.360]  and I understand that that trend has gotten even worse under Obama clearly
[02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:20.360]  one of the most transparent Wall Street candidates even as he appeals to much of
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:26.160]  his base on the basis of tackling the big business interest it's all the fraud of
[02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:30.640]  course but we were speaking with Tom in Arizona and he was on this point of
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:35.720]  regulation Tom yes I just want to kind of finish up on it but the regulators are
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:40.000]  stacked against the common folk in the in the United States the only thing
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:44.360]  that's keeping this thing together the whole economy's a Ponzi scheme it's the
[02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:48.040]  ability of Bernanke to print money out of thin air we saw what Bernie Sanders
[02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:52.600]  when he when he audited the Fed and found an additional 16,000 16 trillion
[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:57.320]  dollars which nobody knows people they have leveraged everything out there
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:02.960]  what you see on your state really there that's why this endless printing of
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:07.160]  money to keep fooling you has to continue until one day I don't know when
[02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:12.240]  it's going to be but it's going to end that's all I got to say go Ron Paul
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:16.520]  okay thanks Tom we're going to jam in some more calls in just a few moments
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:22.840]  here the call in number is 1-800-259-9231 to join us but of course we do
[02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:26.600]  rely on your support here at Info Wars and we have a lot of important
[02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:30.200]  specials right now in time for the holiday season I know a lot of people
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:33.880]  get caught up in the gift-giving of Christmas and other holidays at this
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:39.840]  time of year so maybe it's appropriate that Info Wars has a 99-95 special for
[02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:44.000]  all 18 of Alex's films it's really more than 18 I think if you count them right
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:48.400]  things like the police state trilogy with three films in one set and stuff
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:53.280]  like dark secrets with two films one an update on the other but it's a great
[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:57.040]  gift it comes in the plastic wrap package it's something nice and
[02:35:57.040 --> 02:36:00.680]  attractive you can give to friends families neighbors even strangers and
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:05.160]  they'll wonder what is this stuff and hopefully they'll watch it and have an
[02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:09.760]  awakening from that point on Obama deception is still so powerful the system
[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:13.720]  has to demonize it and come after it that's just one of the powerful films you
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:18.600]  get in that pack and the whole deal is whether you love or hate Obama you watch
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:23.200]  the film but you really learn about the globalist behind the throne the true
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:27.840]  system that has hijacked our country and the rest of the globe and taking it
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:31.840]  over through these puppet presidents the way they sell you an image remember
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:36.520]  these elections are nothing more than just the marketing of candidates it's no
[02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:41.520]  different than the commercials you see on TV for products Coke and Pepsi style a
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:45.040]  false left right opposition making it feel like you have a choice when you're
[02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:49.800]  really buying into an overall controlled system where in the case of food
[02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:53.840]  products nutrition and health isn't taken into consideration just the appeal
[02:36:53.840 --> 02:36:59.840]  the image behind the product never mind the substance now to plug another part
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:04.160]  of our special until the end of November you could sign up for a 15-day free
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:09.240]  trial of prisonplanet.tv if you wondered what is up with the info wars nightly

[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:15.680]  in Oregon let's see what you bring to the table Kyle
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:21.720]  Hi guys so much to your credit you have for I wish I could be a guest on the show one day
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:26.800]  I do have a question and I'm sure you can answer for Alex Jones or on behalf of
[02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:32.600]  the production in terms of vaccinations outside of our children being walking
[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:37.040]  debt I think the vaccines are the number one threat to our children my
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:42.000]  children hasn't received all of his shots so in turn my family is shunning me
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:47.520]  literally my father has forsaken me because of the argument my fiance and I
[02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:53.280]  argue over the vaccines that he really would not will not get is there any
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:39:01.120]  solid answer as to what one can do you know in parenthood besides moving off of
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:09.520]  the grid outside of you know sheltering or hiding one's own family from vaccines
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:14.960]  or forced inoculations does anyone with someone like yourself have an answer as
[02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:21.520]  to how to avoid how to you know get your child into school without vaccines and
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:26.760]  such well as far as the school issue the perception that it is a law is a hoax at
[02:39:26.760 --> 02:39:30.360]  least in almost every place I've read about among other things they have a
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:34.720]  waiver for religious exemption but I think it also covers ideological
[02:39:34.720 --> 02:39:40.640]  exemption but as far as dealing with your family and your fiance or spouse as
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:43.400]  well as your parents I mean I haven't been through that myself I'm not a
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:47.600]  parent yet but obviously that could be a big issue you want to try to show them
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:51.720]  the package inserts and bring them the truth but just remember it's your child's
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:56.320]  life at stake it's your family at stake it is your life it's not the federal
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:40:01.240]  government it's not the big systems life to play games with and that stuff has
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:05.120]  been shown to be very dangerous there's numerous health effects there's articles
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:09.280]  all over info words dot com and natural news I'm not an expert in that area so I
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:14.080]  can't speak too much on it as far as awakening the family to those issues I
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:18.080]  think it's probably something that takes time but look how many more vaccines
[02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:23.480]  they give out now than they did a decade or two decades ago exactly and so are
[02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:32.920]  there any vaccines left that that you shouldn't be so fearful of well that's
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:36.520]  going to be a case-by-case I mean it has to do with the ingredients and also the
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:40.760]  way it was developed a lot of the things it's supposed to protect you against
[02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:45.920]  knowingly bro change and mutate over time so that's one reason why it's hard to
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:50.480]  target with mass vaccinations but the other side of it is the thimerosal and
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:54.880]  the other ill ingredients that they throw in there as kind of a sociological
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:58.240]  goodie you've heard Alex on this issue before I mean I would just encourage you
[02:40:58.240 --> 02:41:02.960]  to research it because I can't tell you some silver bullet key here any other
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:10.520]  words Kyle yes well I appreciate that I'll have one comment on the wrong poll
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:18.200]  campaign when one hears about a secession or when people in such a state
[02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:25.480]  as Texas speak of a secession and I think that leads kind of to an option of
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:29.720]  just declaring because with the bloodlines of the human body with
[02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:37.160]  Dick Cheney being related to Bush or how do you want to look at it I think at
[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:42.200]  some point we should all just claim one poll as our president because when the
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:46.320]  media over every single channel says he can't become president he won't be
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:50.360]  president he's not going to have to be president well actually in terms of
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:54.880]  bloodlines and such maybe that is the case and maybe it's time for us just to
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:58.920]  claim him as our president I think that's a great idea I mean to me that
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:04.080]  fits in with with what I think is the archetypal theme of I am Spartacus when
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:09.880]  Spartacus led the slave rebellion in Rome prior to the Caesars they went
[02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:12.680]  looking for him in the countryside at least as depicted in the movie I'm not
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:16.720]  sure if it's entirely historically accurate but they began to say where is
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:20.080]  Spartacus where is he and all the commoners stood up and said I am
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:23.960]  Spartacus no I'm Spartacus in other words who you gonna take are you free
[02:42:23.960 --> 02:42:27.680]  humanity are we gonna stand up for ourselves and declare that we're not
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:31.760]  part of this takeover system we see through it and people like Ron Paul
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:35.960]  represent the idea of that true freedom and that's why so many people have
[02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:39.840]  gathered to support him I think it's a great idea to declare Ron Paul is my
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:45.000]  president I think they have bumper stickers to that effect already I've
[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:50.560]  got a note here vaccine not one vaccine has ever been tested with concern to
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:55.520]  cancer not sure what the source is on that but I mean yeah do your own research
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:00.480]  there's all kinds of shenanigans and ill plans with the vaccines I don't want to
[02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:04.240]  get any more into that today though Patrick in New York let's see what you
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:12.000]  have thanks for the call there good how are you not bad you know I just want to
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:17.400]  talk about you know the educational especially college you know I'm in
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:22.120]  college I'm in community college and you know I noticed I'm taking a world
[02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:27.320]  politics class and it is the biggest propaganda lies that I have ever heard in
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:31.600]  my life and somebody that's awake to this can obviously see it like the whole
[02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:35.920]  textbook the whole entire textbook just talks about you know solutions it says
[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:41.760]  like you know it says our problems like as the war as to our economic crisis and
[02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:46.480]  every solution that the book gives is overgovernment and it's just you know I
[02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:50.160]  think it's absolutely sickening and I keep on pointing this out in class and
[02:43:50.160 --> 02:43:54.120]  my professor just is like he's like no no no you don't know what you're talking
[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:59.960]  about and he tries to like stop me from saying like what from essentially
[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:04.560]  speaking my mind on these topics and he just keeps on going on with the you know
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:09.880]  global governance is good you know trust the UN goes in a great detail about how
[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:14.240]  great the UN is and how great the EU is when in fact the EU is going under and
[02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:19.280]  right right before us I just want to know what you think about that well
[02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:23.160]  that is a big issue Patrick I mean the history of education in the way it
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:26.840]  developed particularly in the 20th century is surprisingly shocking but
[02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:31.160]  you could trace it back to as Charlotte Israbe pointed out in our recent special
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:35.600]  which you can find up on present planet TV the extent to which skull and bones
[02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:40.600]  and other elitist families the Rockefeller Foundation and more really
[02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:45.080]  brought to life the modern education system which did away largely with the
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:48.880]  classical education and brought in what you can call in many different ways
[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:53.600]  conditioning and training and then more broadly they found the textbooks and
[02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:57.440]  influenced the people who write for the textbooks the same people bankrolling
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:01.400]  the whole global government project and they want to pitch it as inevitable they
[02:45:01.400 --> 02:45:05.600]  want to make solutions seem simple and easy to understand they want to promote
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:11.080]  this whole global society where everyone has these shared values and so forth and
[02:45:11.080 --> 02:45:14.280]  it's definitely indoctrination in these schools even if for well-meaning
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:19.520]  reasons in some cases there's a lot of good teachers in the system but they are
[02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:23.880]  required to read from the textbooks and and we showed you chapters on September
[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:28.120]  11th over the years in grade school and more on the other hand I went through
[02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:33.880]  UT's school of government and yeah I would have to concur it is full of
[02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:38.480]  globalist propaganda I'll keep it short for time's sake any other things
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:45.360]  Patrick you know I just want to say I didn't see Charlotte Israbe you know I
[02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:50.840]  did see her her work and I was interested by it you know and always
[02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:55.040]  like a personal story with me no I you know ever since I was a young child you
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:59.360]  know I always I went to school you know and like when I was really little like
[02:45:59.360 --> 02:46:03.400]  I would I was always interested in learning I love learning I was never the
[02:46:03.400 --> 02:46:06.720]  person to do homework because I didn't want to I didn't want to submit to
[02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:11.680]  authority figures that's the main thing and like I would you know I wouldn't do
[02:46:11.680 --> 02:46:14.920]  any homework you know I'd probably fool around a little bit and then when test
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:18.760]  on game I get like high grade you know I'm not trying to do my own order or
[02:46:18.760 --> 02:46:23.320]  anything but like no drug teaches completely up the wall because the main
[02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:28.320]  reason is you know I had a problem with authority and that's basically with the
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:33.360]  American educational system is it's more about submitting to authority I feel
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:37.920]  than to actually about learning yeah certainly and I've seen people who
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:42.360]  perform well in school as well as those who did poorly all rolled over by the
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:46.800]  system and intimidated out of the great potential we have in ourselves I mean I
[02:46:46.800 --> 02:46:49.860]  don't want to get too much more into it today but I certainly have a lot of
[02:46:49.860 --> 02:46:54.320]  thoughts on that subject O'Brien are you calling with the 1984 moniker or is that
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:47:01.240]  your real name yes it is my real name welcome to the program thank you I had a
[02:47:01.240 --> 02:47:10.440]  question for the other gas but I guess I could ask you well how do we prepare for
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:16.760]  the but it's hard for the time hard times ahead that that will be coming down the
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:18.960]  pike
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:26.440]  no yeah well I mean that's a complicated issue I'm not really coming from a
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:30.000]  financial expert point of view but you want to try to limit your exposure to
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:34.720]  what we know or fraudulent systems and try to make preparations in case you lose
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:39.800]  a job or have no opportunities in the coming markets I mean there's a lot more
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:43.960]  you could read on it gold and silver are a good thing to get a hold of as a
[02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:48.120]  reserve but yeah you want to try to disconnect yourself from the parts that
[02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:52.320]  are falling apart and try to find opportunity where you can I think Jordan
[02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:57.560]  let's take your I'm sorry Justice in Michigan let's take your call now
[02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:04.540]  hi how you doing very good I've come up with a great idea for the movement
[02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:13.200]  over the rubber whatever I know Alex says ideas are bulletproof I've come up
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:18.400]  with a social network just for us I've made it I built it I put it together it's
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:25.440]  those tons of improvised material others and the address is Patriot spot dot
[02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:30.120]  wall FM if anybody would like to join there and check it out they're welcome
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:39.120]  to join just I want to make another tool I want to help I want to we need unity we
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:45.280]  cannot win this without unity and this is a place together yeah right like mines
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:48.240]  have to get together so tell us real quickly where that is and then let's
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:56.880]  move on it's a picture it dot wall dot FM okay thanks a lot and now let's go to
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:03.400]  Jordan in Texas welcome hey Aaron how's it going I was a good idea for you know
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:08.680]  this thing I'm from Paul you know because as he's getting closer to winning
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:11.440]  I believe the GOP debate and everything I think you're really getting pretty
[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:15.000]  close so I think what we need to start doing start occupying the mainstream
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:20.480]  media's phone lines and their physical buildings or as my friend would say the
[02:49:20.480 --> 02:49:24.320]  shame stream media I really think we need to start occupying the phones and
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:27.800]  that's the mainstream media so we can start demanding that Ron Paul gets
[02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:31.040]  more than just 89 seconds or a few minutes because they give him a few
[02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:34.040]  minutes they give everybody else like 10 12 minutes and we start demanding that
[02:49:34.040 --> 02:49:37.360]  Ron Paul gets more time because he's getting closer to winning this thing
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:41.800]  absolutely and obviously they have been trying to black him out from media
[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:47.040]  coverage in many ways in this cycle and in the 2008 cycle it hasn't stopped him
[02:49:47.040 --> 02:49:52.360]  but it has probably slowed him and regardless of Ron Paul's position in
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:56.360]  this race the whole system is fraudulent anyway they write the election laws to
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:49:59.720]  favor the two parties they put in these sham candidates who they know are going
[02:49:59.720 --> 02:50:04.600]  to go along with the establishment agenda the global government agenda the
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:07.880]  lobbyist agenda and a whole lot more which all becomes interrelated
[02:50:07.880 --> 02:50:11.760]  certainly we should hit the mainstream media let them know that this election
[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:15.760]  is different there are real issues in that election and Ron Paul represents
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:19.480]  those ideas I think it's a good idea to get that out for sure anything else
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:24.880]  Gregory I'm Jordan gonna confuse you no man that's it all right have a good one

[02:54:24.560 --> 02:54:29.360]  breaking news the new Iowa poll that places Ron Paul firmly in first with
[02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:34.520]  25% that's right when they do honest polling it produces a lot better
[02:54:34.520 --> 02:54:38.720]  results for our kind of candidates then when you see the mainstream people
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:43.640]  spinning and massaging the data to their own purposes but that's the way
[02:54:43.640 --> 02:54:47.920]  elections go they call it fighting dirty we just want to let people know that
[02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:52.520]  Ron Paul does have support because of the ideas he supports not because he's
[02:54:52.520 --> 02:54:58.840]  some kind of you know just figurehead leader like all the other candidates you
[02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:04.760]  know also in the news here on November 22nd the day of JFK's assassination 38
[02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:10.960]  years ago in 1963 you have articles like this one in New York Magazine what
[02:55:10.960 --> 02:55:16.760]  killed JFK not who but what and people like Chris Matthews who brought you the
[02:55:16.760 --> 02:55:21.440]  rise of the right wing and otherwise try to demonize the severe right wing
[02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:26.240]  hatred of Democratic presidents he brought this point up to in relation to
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:30.880]  Obama let's cue some of that clip now let me finish tonight with this on a
[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:35.240]  Friday morning in the fall of 1963 an American president traveled through
[02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:39.840]  Texas trying to figure the state out what made Dallas so right-wing he kept
[02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:43.160]  asking the two men in the car with him that drizzly Friday morning in November
[02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:46.920]  why were they attacking him as a traitor why were they spitting on his
[02:55:46.920 --> 02:55:50.800]  people one of his hosts Congressman Jim Wright of Fort Worth laid it out on the
[02:55:50.800 --> 02:55:55.200]  right-wing press in Dallas Governor John Connolly the other politician in the
[02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:58.920]  car with him the visiting president chalked it up to the economy unlike a
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:02.880]  city like Fort Worth a city of stockyards and factory floors where the
[02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:06.680]  visiting president had just gotten warmly cheered the city of Dallas was
[02:56:06.680 --> 02:56:09.960]  filled with white collar office buildings people there all wanted to make
[02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:13.640]  it to the higher floor wanted to move up to their insurance and financial
[02:56:13.640 --> 02:56:17.600]  companies they were voting the way their bosses voted voting their aspirations
[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:21.560]  to get to the next floor who knows what makes one city so different from another
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:25.160]  politically Jack Kenny was just trying to sort it all out that morning he was
[02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:28.640]  living the life of an American politician trying to figure things out
[02:56:28.640 --> 02:56:32.520]  politically trying to figure out what was in the water down there in Dallas
[02:56:32.520 --> 02:56:37.080]  that made some people so viciously right-wing okay there you have it and
[02:56:37.080 --> 02:56:41.760]  the insinuation that it was something in the water that made people so viciously
[02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:45.840]  right-wing and this is just more of the talking point using JFK as a bouncing
[02:56:45.840 --> 02:56:52.200]  board for the larger attempt to demonize free speech and try to pin a lot of the
[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:56.460]  extremist action on the rhetoric from various circles you've seen it most
