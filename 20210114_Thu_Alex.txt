[00:00.000 --> 00:17.000]  I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of the past week.
[00:17.000 --> 00:23.680]  As I have said, the incursion of the U.S. Capitol struck at the very heart of our republic.
[00:23.680 --> 00:30.280]  It angered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum.
[00:30.280 --> 00:32.480]  I want to be very clear.
[00:32.480 --> 00:38.480]  I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week.
[00:38.480 --> 00:44.800]  Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement.
[00:44.800 --> 00:50.160]  Making America great again has always been about defending the rule of law, supporting
[00:50.160 --> 00:55.760]  the men and women of law enforcement, and upholding our nation's most sacred traditions
[00:55.760 --> 00:57.360]  and values.
[00:57.360 --> 01:04.200]  Mob violence goes against everything I believe in and everything our movement stands for.
[01:04.200 --> 01:09.900]  No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence.
[01:09.900 --> 01:17.720]  No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag.
[01:17.720 --> 01:23.160]  No true supporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their fellow Americans.
[01:23.160 --> 01:28.360]  If you do any of these things, you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking
[01:28.360 --> 01:32.040]  it, and you are attacking our country.
[01:32.040 --> 01:34.680]  We cannot tolerate it.
[01:34.680 --> 01:41.960]  Tragically over the course of the past year, made so difficult because of COVID-19, we
[01:41.960 --> 01:46.660]  have seen political violence spiral out of control.
[01:46.660 --> 01:53.680]  We have seen too many riots, too many mobs, too many acts of intimidation and destruction.
[01:53.680 --> 01:55.440]  It must stop.
[01:55.440 --> 02:04.440]  Whether you are on the right or on the left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never
[02:04.440 --> 02:07.720]  a justification for violence.
[02:07.720 --> 02:11.760]  No excuses, no exceptions.
[02:11.760 --> 02:15.200]  America is a nation of laws.
[02:15.200 --> 02:20.960]  Those who engaged in the attacks last week will be brought to justice.
[02:20.960 --> 02:27.960]  Now I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of ways to ease
[02:27.960 --> 02:34.440]  tensions, calm tempers, and help to promote peace in our country.
[02:34.440 --> 02:41.080]  There has been reporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days, both
[02:41.080 --> 02:46.280]  here in Washington and across the country.
[02:46.280 --> 02:53.080]  I have been briefed by the U.S. Secret Service on the potential threats.
[02:53.080 --> 02:59.380]  Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful and peaceful way.
[02:59.380 --> 03:02.400]  That is your first amendment right.
[03:02.400 --> 03:09.160]  But I cannot emphasize that there must be no violence, no law-breaking, and no vandalism
[03:09.160 --> 03:10.960]  of any kind.
[03:10.960 --> 03:17.080]  Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement.
[03:17.080 --> 03:24.960]  I have directed federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order.
[03:24.960 --> 03:32.560]  In Washington, D.C., we are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city
[03:32.560 --> 03:38.280]  and ensure that a transition can occur safely and without incident.
[03:38.280 --> 03:44.440]  Like all of you, I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last
[03:44.440 --> 03:45.440]  week.
[03:45.440 --> 03:50.960]  I want to thank the hundreds of millions of incredible American citizens who have responded
[03:50.960 --> 03:55.520]  to this moment with calm moderation and grace.
[03:55.520 --> 04:00.440]  We will get through this challenge just like we always do.
[04:00.440 --> 04:08.240]  I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent
[04:08.240 --> 04:10.080]  days.
[04:10.080 --> 04:12.920]  These are tense and difficult times.
[04:12.920 --> 04:19.920]  The efforts to censor, cancel, and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong.
[04:19.920 --> 04:21.720]  And they are dangerous.
[04:21.720 --> 04:28.640]  What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence one another.
[04:28.640 --> 04:36.920]  All of us can choose, by our actions, to rise above the ranker and find common ground and
[04:36.920 --> 04:39.040]  shared purpose.
[04:39.040 --> 04:45.440]  We must focus on advancing the interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle
[04:45.440 --> 04:58.640]  vaccines, defeating the pandemic, rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security.
[04:58.640 --> 05:01.320]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[05:01.320 --> 05:03.240]  You got to pray to God and get your soul ready.
[05:03.240 --> 05:06.880]  You got to be prepared to physically defend yourself and your family.
[05:06.880 --> 05:11.400]  You've also got to get things that allow you and your family to not be dependent on the
[05:11.400 --> 05:12.400]  system.
[05:12.400 --> 05:14.200]  That's why they want to bankrupt the economy.
[05:14.200 --> 05:19.040]  It's why they want to destroy the infrastructure of this nation because they want all of us
[05:19.040 --> 05:22.760]  on our knees so they can dictate our surrender to them.
[05:22.760 --> 05:27.240]  Info Wars is a critical organization in the fight against the globalist.
[05:27.240 --> 05:31.040]  If you gave us straight up donations, that would be great because our work is important.
[05:31.040 --> 05:32.040]  We appreciate it.
[05:32.040 --> 05:36.800]  But we bring you great products so that you get high quality products at the same time
[05:36.800 --> 05:39.240]  as supporting the Info War by 360 win.
[05:39.240 --> 05:44.600]  Well, we've only got a few days left to get 2020 prices before the prices go up on high
[05:44.600 --> 05:51.080]  quality storeable food with huge discounts as big as $850 discount on a year supply of
[05:51.080 --> 05:53.720]  food at infowarstore.com.
[05:53.720 --> 06:20.720]  So take advantage of these sales right now at infowarstore.com while you still can.
[06:20.720 --> 06:34.560]  Just 24 hours after Twitter permanently suspended President Donald Trump, Google, Apple and
[06:34.560 --> 06:40.400]  Amazon have now all banned Parlor from their app stores, which experts say could destroy
[06:40.400 --> 06:42.280]  the company financially.
[06:42.280 --> 06:47.080]  Before its removal, Parlor surged to number one in Apple's app store with one and a half
[06:47.080 --> 06:49.600]  million downloads on Saturday alone.
[06:49.600 --> 06:55.360]  We are competing with other platforms who have decided that they want to surveil the
[06:55.360 --> 07:00.800]  people on their platform 24 seven without any particular suspicion.
[07:00.800 --> 07:06.160]  And you know, on the one hand, people don't like to live in the world of Orwell's 1984.
[07:06.160 --> 07:10.720]  And then on the other hand, a lot of people seem to want to pressure social media to do
[07:10.720 --> 07:15.880]  more to moderate, as they call it, content on their platforms.
[07:15.880 --> 07:18.400]  But that would require 24 hour surveillance.
[07:18.400 --> 07:22.200]  So we don't think that that is consistent with the principles of America.
[07:22.200 --> 07:26.840]  If they could destroy anybody, if they did this to any app, any company, it would completely
[07:26.840 --> 07:27.920]  destroy them.
[07:27.920 --> 07:31.880]  And we're going to try our best, you know, to get back online as quickly as possible,
[07:31.880 --> 07:35.840]  but we're having a lot of trouble because every vendor we talk to, you know, says they
[07:35.840 --> 07:40.200]  won't work with us because if the Apple doesn't approve and Google doesn't approve, you know,
[07:40.200 --> 07:41.200]  they won't.
[07:41.200 --> 07:51.720]  The Internet is on fire as the global big tech cartel announces an iron grip on speech
[07:51.720 --> 07:53.720]  and that they will shut down anyone and everyone.
[07:53.720 --> 07:59.600]  This does not submit to their tyranny and that any company is trying to form competition
[07:59.600 --> 08:04.520]  will be shut down by the telecoms working with big tech.
[08:04.520 --> 08:07.560]  This is beyond monopoly.
[08:07.560 --> 08:09.360]  This is beyond cartel behavior.
[08:09.360 --> 08:15.880]  This is organized mass racketeering, completely illegal, completely naked.
[08:15.880 --> 08:18.400]  Republicans have no way to communicate.
[08:18.400 --> 08:23.360]  If it doesn't even matter if you're Republican or conservative, if you don't want to be regulated
[08:23.360 --> 08:29.400]  by left wingers that are at Twitter and Facebook and Instagram, where you get shadow ban, nobody
[08:29.400 --> 08:34.360]  gets to see you, nobody gets to see you, they get to decide what's violent or not violent.
[08:34.360 --> 08:36.080]  It's preposterous.
[08:36.080 --> 08:43.040]  So I don't know where the hell the Department of Justice is at right now or the FBI.
[08:43.040 --> 08:49.440]  This is clearly a violation of antitrust, civil rights, the RICO statute.
[08:49.440 --> 08:55.360]  There should be a racketeering investigation on all the people that coordinated this attack
[08:55.360 --> 09:02.640]  on not only a company, but on all of those like us, like me, like you Maria, I have three
[09:02.640 --> 09:07.480]  million followers on parlor tonight.
[09:07.480 --> 09:12.240]  I will no longer be able to communicate with those people, but they've already been censoring
[09:12.240 --> 09:15.960]  Senate hearings proving election fraud several weeks ago.
[09:15.960 --> 09:17.240]  So why not?
[09:17.240 --> 09:23.880]  On August 3rd, 2020, after a rushed special session, Nevada legislators made drastic changes
[09:23.880 --> 09:28.960]  to the state's election law by adopting a bill known as AB4.
[09:28.960 --> 09:31.680]  The vulnerabilities of this statute were obvious.
[09:31.680 --> 09:37.000]  They provided for universal mail voting without sufficient safeguards to authenticate voters
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.480]  or ensure the fundamental requirement that only one ballot was sent to each legally qualified
[09:43.480 --> 09:44.480]  voter.
[09:44.480 --> 09:49.680]  The globalists were beta testing and building this and micro testing it in authoritarian
[09:49.680 --> 09:56.720]  dictatorships, fascist communist systems, very poor areas of the world, prisons, mental
[09:56.720 --> 10:00.640]  institutions, and then in academic institutions, colleges.
[10:00.640 --> 10:05.920]  But now they're externalizing their total authoritarian control grid into everything.
[10:05.920 --> 10:08.520]  So they're going from beta.
[10:08.520 --> 10:13.920]  The Nazis were beta from 1933 to 1940.
[10:13.920 --> 10:17.480]  And then, you know, for five years, they were operational and things were really bad.
[10:17.480 --> 10:20.400]  So I knew everything that was coming because they were building it.
[10:20.400 --> 10:23.440]  They were spending hundreds of billions of dollars preparing it.
[10:23.440 --> 10:26.080]  But it's one thing to know they're going to do it and warn you.
[10:26.080 --> 10:32.440]  It's another thing that once you hit operational and now we've gone over operational, it just
[10:32.440 --> 10:33.640]  implodes.
[10:33.640 --> 10:35.640]  You just drop off the edge of the cliff.
[10:35.640 --> 10:39.200]  What the hell are you doing to this woman?
[10:39.200 --> 10:41.200]  You operate in your own law.
[10:41.200 --> 10:42.200]  Is this disgusting?
[10:42.200 --> 10:43.200]  What are you doing?
[10:43.200 --> 10:44.200]  What are these poor women doing?
[10:44.200 --> 10:45.200]  I'm staying on a bed.
[10:45.200 --> 10:46.200]  I'm staying on a bed.
[10:46.200 --> 10:47.200]  Why is that guy behind her back?
[10:47.200 --> 10:48.200]  You've got to choose your side.
[10:48.200 --> 10:56.800]  Or use the rocket analogy.
[10:56.800 --> 11:00.920]  You're now going straight up because they load the rocket, they put the fuel in it,
[11:00.920 --> 11:04.520]  they prepare it, they've got the avionics, they've got the gyros, they've got the directional
[11:04.520 --> 11:05.520]  systems.
[11:05.520 --> 11:10.840]  And then they hit the countdown, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, primary ignition blast
[11:10.840 --> 11:11.840]  off.
[11:11.840 --> 11:13.840]  So it's blast off, baby.
[11:13.840 --> 11:20.360]  All right, everybody is coming to a head very, very quickly.
[11:20.360 --> 11:26.120]  We are witnessing a globalist purge against America as they install their puppet dictator,
[11:26.120 --> 11:27.120]  Joe Biden.
[11:27.120 --> 11:31.840]  They plan to then bring us into a total depression that we are designed to never come out of.
[11:31.840 --> 11:35.240]  They have launched official Bolshevik training.
[11:35.240 --> 11:36.800]  In fact, I didn't see it in my stack.
[11:36.800 --> 11:42.560]  Please print me infowars.com, the latest, where they are now officially teaching first
[11:42.560 --> 11:47.800]  graders about radical race theory that whites are inherently bad.
[11:47.800 --> 11:52.680]  This is literal Hitler training just in the reverse.
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.400]  And Chinese Americans are freaking out because they go, we fled China.
[11:57.400 --> 11:59.200]  This is Mao.
[11:59.200 --> 12:04.760]  This is bad.
[12:04.760 --> 12:06.280]  I've been here since very early this morning.
[12:06.280 --> 12:07.680]  I've been doing a lot of research.
[12:07.680 --> 12:14.320]  And then we had the FBI contact us just about 30 minutes ago.
[12:14.320 --> 12:17.920]  And then I found out why Roger Stone is in hiding.
[12:17.920 --> 12:19.840]  It was worse than we thought.
[12:19.840 --> 12:24.320]  Somebody came to his house and then waited for his wife, who's handicapped and hearing-impaired
[12:24.320 --> 12:26.240]  and beat her up.
[12:26.240 --> 12:28.560]  So she's been in the hospital.
[12:28.560 --> 12:32.560]  And they also, since Michael Laura Loomer's house tried to kidnap her.
[12:32.560 --> 12:35.080]  And so this is the Bolshevik takeover.
[12:35.080 --> 12:36.800]  Everybody just needs to understand that.
[12:36.800 --> 12:38.640]  You need to know that.
[12:38.640 --> 12:43.280]  And they are actively trying to say that we masterminded the attack at the Capitol with
[12:43.280 --> 12:44.800]  the U.S. military.
[12:44.800 --> 12:47.440]  So that's the line they're going with now.
[12:47.440 --> 12:49.440]  Unbelievable.
[12:49.440 --> 12:52.520]  The headline infowars.com is confirmed.
[12:52.520 --> 12:57.000]  January 6th, Capitol attack was Reichstag 2.0.
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.880]  If you don't know about the Reichstag attack, we're going to be covering that when we come
[13:03.880 --> 13:11.320]  back, because right in that printer, snuggled in that warm printer, is the little printout
[13:11.320 --> 13:16.520]  where I'm going to read you about what happened in the Reichstag attack.
[13:16.520 --> 13:17.840]  But that's what this is.
[13:17.840 --> 13:19.360]  This is a Reichstag attack.
[13:19.360 --> 13:22.080]  It happened right when Hitler got elected.
[13:22.080 --> 13:23.080]  He was very unpopular.
[13:23.080 --> 13:25.000]  They thought he'd stolen the election.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.680]  And he firebombed that bitch.
[13:27.680 --> 13:34.920]  And they found Marinus Wanderloob, a mentally retarded man, and said that he firebombed
[13:34.920 --> 13:36.680]  it for the Communist.
[13:36.680 --> 13:39.120]  So this is how this works.
[13:39.120 --> 13:44.020]  The left is now doing this to the right, even the Nazis were national socialists.
[13:44.020 --> 13:45.960]  So that's how you do it, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:45.960 --> 13:52.440]  And of course, you notice everything I've told you is now mainstream news.
[13:52.440 --> 13:54.560]  Everything I've told you is now mainstream news.
[13:54.560 --> 13:58.360]  This was not Trump's speech, and he ordered people to go down there and do this before
[13:58.360 --> 14:04.280]  he even spoke and said, be peaceful, which they don't show you because he's blackballed.
[14:04.280 --> 14:07.240]  They even banned his speeches on his YouTube channel because you can actually go see what
[14:07.240 --> 14:08.240]  he said.
[14:08.240 --> 14:09.240]  So that's the key to censorship.
[14:09.240 --> 14:10.560]  They don't just silence you.
[14:10.560 --> 14:12.640]  They then can lie about you.
[14:12.640 --> 14:18.000]  They're now going, oh my gosh, investigators, FBI believes it was led by a sophisticated
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  group.
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.000]  Really?
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.520]  Like the Southern Primary Law Center?
[14:21.520 --> 14:22.520]  Really?
[14:22.520 --> 14:34.360]  Oh, now they're saying the Capitol Police were aiding the right-wingers, bullcrap, bullcrap.
[14:34.360 --> 14:38.120]  They ordered the hires up to stand down after the police were attacked by antifa and others
[14:38.120 --> 14:40.240]  for hours.
[14:40.240 --> 14:43.960]  Once they got their footage, they ordered the police to open the gates, the people came
[14:43.960 --> 14:45.440]  in so they could be set up.
[14:45.440 --> 14:47.040]  We have it now.
[14:47.040 --> 14:51.080]  And the Capitol Police were not involved, nor was the commander that committed suicide
[14:51.080 --> 14:52.680]  who was ordered to do it.
[14:52.680 --> 14:56.960]  Everything he really committed suicide, I got a bridge I'm willing to sell you, called
[14:56.960 --> 14:58.960]  the Brooklyn Bridge.
[14:58.960 --> 15:03.200]  So it's all coming up as everything converges.
[15:03.200 --> 15:05.920]  In fact, I'm not scared at all.
[15:05.920 --> 15:06.920]  I'm very honored.
[15:06.920 --> 15:07.920]  I'm a patriot.
[15:07.920 --> 15:08.920]  I'm an American.
[15:08.920 --> 15:13.680]  And I've not disgraced my ancestors that were incredible Americans and Texans.
[15:13.680 --> 15:15.080]  And we're in the middle of this fight now.
[15:15.080 --> 15:16.480]  And they committed the crimes.
[15:16.480 --> 15:17.720]  They tricked the crowd.
[15:17.720 --> 15:19.240]  They yelled fire in the theater.
[15:19.240 --> 15:20.640]  They caused the stampede.
[15:20.640 --> 15:22.480]  They used and programmed the cutars.
[15:22.480 --> 15:27.000]  They had the antifa operatives detonate the operation.
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.120]  And you guys did it.
[15:28.120 --> 15:31.560]  The deep state, the same ones that protect Epstein, the same ones that destroy our borders,
[15:31.560 --> 15:36.280]  the same ones that let child molesters go, the same ones that it's on them.
[15:36.280 --> 15:38.280]  It's on you and your little Hitler operation.
[15:38.280 --> 15:41.320]  That's why they had their people trying to burn it down, but nobody would, or it would
[15:41.320 --> 15:44.520]  have been the Reichstag for real if those pipe bombs went off.
[15:44.520 --> 15:46.720]  But they didn't.
[15:46.720 --> 15:47.720]  God is with us.
[15:47.720 --> 15:51.440]  Now's the time to be praying, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:51.440 --> 15:57.080]  I'm Alex Jones, this is The Impulse.
[15:57.080 --> 16:00.440]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[16:00.440 --> 16:04.760]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[16:04.760 --> 16:09.480]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[16:09.480 --> 16:13.680]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[16:13.680 --> 16:18.360]  Recent studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly
[16:18.360 --> 16:24.080]  lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque,
[16:24.080 --> 16:30.520]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[16:30.520 --> 16:37.160]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[16:37.160 --> 16:41.760]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[16:41.760 --> 16:47.520]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[16:47.520 --> 16:50.360]  facts that pertain to reality.
[16:50.360 --> 17:20.320]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[17:20.320 --> 17:27.320]  This is economic domination, this is economic war, we are being consolidated, we are being
[17:27.320 --> 17:28.320]  taken over.
[17:28.320 --> 17:32.440]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states, they're consolidating
[17:32.440 --> 17:37.600]  power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal and then
[17:37.600 --> 17:41.200]  consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property.
[17:41.200 --> 17:45.320]  This gives a monopolistic takeover, that's what the great reset is, cloud swab and these
[17:45.320 --> 17:47.240]  other criminals admit it.
[17:47.240 --> 17:52.680]  That's what social distancing is, so your business is only at 25% for several more years, no small
[17:52.680 --> 17:54.480]  businesses will be there.
[17:54.480 --> 17:59.840]  This is a master plan, say no.
[17:59.840 --> 18:17.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:17.800 --> 18:39.440]  That was the day, February 27th, 1933, Adolf Alois Hitler had narrowly won the presidency
[18:39.440 --> 18:47.400]  of Germany, but von Hindenburg was not stepping down as the chancellor, the most powerful
[18:47.400 --> 18:55.720]  position in the Weimar Republic in the twilight of its days before the rise of the leader
[18:55.720 --> 19:00.280]  or the furor.
[19:00.280 --> 19:07.280]  But days after the election that Hitler won by a very slight margin, fire bombs hit the
[19:07.280 --> 19:14.960]  capital and was blamed on his enemies, the communists.
[19:14.960 --> 19:20.880]  And now the old Jackabins are turning around and doing it to America.
[19:20.880 --> 19:24.880]  Here's the headline of the live show, breaking January 6th, capital attack was deep state
[19:24.880 --> 19:32.040]  orchestrated Reichstag fire 2.0.
[19:32.040 --> 19:36.120]  Now you notice that we are eight days after this happened.
[19:36.120 --> 19:41.000]  I was there, but I took my time doing my research, I saw the paramilitary groups, oh in general
[19:41.000 --> 19:46.240]  McInerney of the Air Force, three-star general or whatever it says, oh special operations
[19:46.240 --> 19:53.040]  was there, look those are obviously special operations, yeah.
[19:53.040 --> 19:57.800]  And now the left was going to try to impeach and then have Trump remove the Senate, but
[19:57.800 --> 20:01.480]  that all fell apart because the house is just an indictment.
[20:01.480 --> 20:04.080]  Constitution says once Trump's out of office, they can't have the trial, they don't have
[20:04.080 --> 20:05.080]  time.
[20:05.080 --> 20:09.320]  They can't instantly go from, oh Trump did it and made his supporters do it to, oh wait,
[20:09.320 --> 20:14.800]  all these paramilitary people were seen going in, not just Antifa, with the earpieces and
[20:14.800 --> 20:24.480]  in shape and working in unison, oh, it's Alex Jones' security team, they're behind it all.
[20:24.480 --> 20:32.280]  The FBI called us this morning, yes, oh, we orchestrated everything, I mean, wow, we've
[20:32.280 --> 20:39.440]  really got them now, the idea that they know, everybody knows paramilitary went in there
[20:39.440 --> 20:43.360]  and they're trying to blame the Capitol Police, that's CNN, Associated Press.
[20:43.360 --> 20:50.160]  The Capitol Police, the Democrats are saying orchestrated this with info wars to try to
[20:50.160 --> 20:55.520]  get Pelosi arrested, they run their deep state Q op, they've got real soldiers go in, make
[20:55.520 --> 21:00.000]  sure security drops, it's meant to be blamed on Trump, but then people got video of it
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.280]  also, it's coming out, so you turn around, I have the articles and you blame the Capitol
[21:04.280 --> 21:08.800]  Police folks, the Capitol Police are just like regular cops, they're all following the rules,
[21:08.800 --> 21:13.040]  they all take orders, they do a good job, they're nice people, they're a bunch of more
[21:13.040 --> 21:18.520]  listeners, do you think they were involved in a mass conspiracy with info wars?
[21:18.520 --> 21:19.520]  No.
[21:19.520 --> 21:27.800]  I mean, wow, I've hit twilight zone, twilight zone, like in the world of twilight zone,
[21:27.800 --> 21:31.200]  or something even weirder, like imagine what people in twilight zone, when they watch the
[21:31.200 --> 21:35.040]  twilight zone, it must be even weirder, or like in the twilight zone of the twilight
[21:35.040 --> 21:36.040]  zone.
[21:36.040 --> 21:44.840]  Yeah, we'd like you to come in and talk about your people in the military have quite distinguished
[21:44.840 --> 21:49.600]  records that work there, and we noticed this and that, yeah, we'll just know about what
[21:49.600 --> 21:58.160]  you know about what happened in there, wow, wow, ladies and gentlemen, because we're the
[21:58.160 --> 22:04.360]  ones saying on air, paramilitary, not just regular soldiers, I've seen the look that
[22:04.360 --> 22:08.600]  all of it, they're trying to look non-conspicuous, they stick out like sore thumbs, and then
[22:08.600 --> 22:16.280]  that idiot McInerney is like, that's the Q4, the Pelosi's laptop, they were in there
[22:16.280 --> 22:21.640]  running it, they were in there bringing the weapons, they were in there staging it.
[22:21.640 --> 22:25.440]  They tried to get the Q-tards up to actually try to kidnap some of the members of Congress,
[22:25.440 --> 22:28.440]  but it didn't work.
[22:28.440 --> 22:33.280]  That's why they had retired officers from Texas and Tennessee that got arrested, but
[22:33.280 --> 22:38.000]  with zip ties, who were honorably discharged, who believed they were there to actually save
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.560]  America.
[22:40.560 --> 22:44.240]  Watch the movie Arlington Road, how they set up Jeff Bridges at the end, that's exactly
[22:44.240 --> 22:48.320]  how they run these ops, they actually did that with McVeigh, he didn't want the bombing
[22:48.320 --> 22:51.600]  to happen, so they drugged him up and set him up for it, said, we'll kill your family
[22:51.600 --> 22:58.240]  if you don't take the blame, and they all had useful idiots with them, Antifa and other
[22:58.240 --> 23:04.920]  groups, the Boogaloo's, but see, they don't want the Boogaloo's busted, no, no, no, because
[23:04.920 --> 23:12.960]  that leads back to the FBI and the CIA, and he's, no, no, no, it's in the news, it's the
[23:12.960 --> 23:21.280]  Capitol Police, why they wonder why the Capitol Police gave tours and gave people maps, they
[23:21.280 --> 23:27.920]  hand them out to the front, oh, look, these congressmen gave a turd, Ali Alexander, and
[23:27.920 --> 23:34.960]  this former federal prosecutor, this woman that just got elected, she saw them with Alexander,
[23:34.960 --> 23:39.360]  and she wants them all arrested, and she saw, and then they put a photo out in the Daily
[23:39.360 --> 23:45.440]  Mail of me at the Georgia Capitol going, and it shows us doing a group photo with my head
[23:45.440 --> 23:49.240]  security guy, trying to tell the crowd how to have a nice group photo, brought to the
[23:49.240 --> 23:54.080]  Capitol by the state rep, all peaceful, all nice, how we do it, and that's like, look
[23:54.080 --> 24:04.000]  at the proof of them casing the U.S. Capitol, are these the men behind the pipe bombs?
[24:04.000 --> 24:10.480]  And the weird fetishizing tyranny leftists are just on Twitter, just arrest Jones, get
[24:10.480 --> 24:17.720]  him, so I guess I'm the new Richard Joule, I mean, that's where this is going, folks,
[24:17.720 --> 24:22.960]  I went and tried to stop it, I went and got there as it already kicked off and tried to
[24:22.960 --> 24:28.760]  get on their main PA system that I knew they had to say, get on the PA, put me on the PA,
[24:28.760 --> 24:31.840]  I'll tell them, get out of here, we've been set up, don't be part of this, leave the Capitol
[24:31.840 --> 24:36.520]  now, every one of them would have done what I told them, every person in there knows my
[24:36.520 --> 24:41.360]  voice, I said, it's very distinctive, get me on the PA now, they didn't listen to me
[24:41.360 --> 24:46.040]  because they were paralyzed because their boss had been ordered to stand down and he's dead
[24:46.040 --> 24:50.640]  now so we can't talk to him, he got shot.
[24:50.640 --> 24:56.880]  So again, I'm going to tell you right now, this is Reichstag, Reichstag, Reichstag, Reichstag
[24:56.880 --> 25:10.160]  2.0, period, unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable, this is the real world, you cannot make this
[25:10.160 --> 25:21.080]  up and Roger Stone, a man ran over his wife and she got back up and he knocked her over
[25:21.080 --> 25:29.760]  again and he knocked her over again, so Roger now is going into hiding, this isn't a joke,
[25:29.760 --> 25:41.200]  his wife is in the hospital to have emergency surgery because a man beat his wife up, just
[25:41.200 --> 25:45.520]  randomly in their little condo area, nobody's around, she's walking the dog, a dude pulls
[25:45.520 --> 25:49.880]  up on a bike and starts knocking him over, she gets up, he knocks her over repeatedly,
[25:49.880 --> 25:56.920]  that's the left for you folks, that's where we are right now, is beating up 75 year old
[25:56.920 --> 26:00.640]  or whatever she is, she's older than Roger, look how old his wife is, still looks great
[26:00.640 --> 26:05.000]  for 70 something years old, my God, his daughter's not bad looking either, I mean that like God
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.080]  made beautiful women, I'm not hitting on them, I'm married, I'm saying nice ladies and this
[26:10.080 --> 26:16.480]  is just out of control ladies and gentlemen, absolutely out of control, let me tell you,
[26:16.480 --> 26:21.280]  when they beat my wife up, you're going to get your head removed, but notice Roger wasn't
[26:21.280 --> 26:26.760]  there when they beat his wife up, so that's where we are right now and I told you, I said
[26:26.760 --> 26:35.920]  I saw professional looking military people running this, I told you, with antifa and
[26:35.920 --> 26:41.800]  now they're like, oh yeah, there was a secret group with the capital police, give me a break,
[26:41.800 --> 26:46.640]  they were working for the globalists, they stood the game, they ordered the stand down,
[26:46.640 --> 26:50.160]  capital police were set up in this, they didn't do anything, now they've killed the deputy
[26:50.160 --> 26:55.360]  that was in charge, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[26:55.360 --> 26:59.440]  I want to warn all patriots in the United States and across the world, let's think of
[26:59.440 --> 27:04.640]  my voice, I'm Alex Jones, I've been in this fight 27 years and I've studied every angle
[27:04.640 --> 27:11.240]  of their operations and I'm here to tell you as clear as day, they have organizations on
[27:11.240 --> 27:17.600]  message boards and other groups, posing as patriot leaders and posing as President Trump,
[27:17.600 --> 27:22.440]  anonymously telling you to have arm marches in all 50 states coming up on the 20th and
[27:22.440 --> 27:28.440]  before that, you are being set up, I was there in D.C. with a million peaceful people and
[27:28.440 --> 27:34.560]  I watch antifa and other leftist groups, poses our people and set us up, thank God the patriots
[27:34.560 --> 27:40.440]  did not engage in the rioting, so only a few people did it, so the thing was a misfire,
[27:40.440 --> 27:45.520]  it was a dud, but the left is hungry to declare all Trump supporters terrorist and they're
[27:45.520 --> 27:50.240]  planning terrorist attacks and mass shootings on the 20th to blame the American people,
[27:50.240 --> 27:55.160]  do not be part of it, we are peaceful, we are not violent.
[27:55.160 --> 28:00.400]  Now is the time to get prepared, you gotta pray to God and get your soul ready, you gotta
[28:00.400 --> 28:05.080]  be prepared to physically defend yourself and your family and you've also got to get
[28:05.080 --> 28:09.440]  things that allow you and your family to not be dependent on the system, that's why they
[28:09.440 --> 28:13.720]  want to bankrupt the economy, it's why they want to destroy the infrastructure of this
[28:13.720 --> 28:18.840]  nation because they want all of us on our knees so they can dictate our surrender to
[28:18.840 --> 28:19.840]  them.
[28:19.840 --> 28:24.400]  Info wars is a critical organization in the fight against the globalist and if you gave

[29:58.040 --> 30:12.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:12.440 --> 30:18.160]  Cyrus Jones.
[30:18.160 --> 30:41.400]  My dad's grandmother was 103, her name was Moon Jones, pretty wild at the time, that
[30:41.400 --> 30:51.040]  makes him pretty wild, welcome back ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide,
[30:51.040 --> 30:56.080]  John Rappaport has been in this game a long time, kind of the Obi-Wan Kenobi of investigative
[30:56.080 --> 30:57.080]  journalist.
[30:57.080 --> 31:01.720]  I was watching this guy 30 years ago before I even got on air, we had major films out,
[31:01.720 --> 31:07.480]  interviews, you name it and he was an investigative researcher for the biggest news programs in
[31:07.480 --> 31:08.480]  the country.
[31:08.480 --> 31:17.680]  And I saw him yesterday when he was doing the fourth hour, he blew it away the way he described
[31:17.680 --> 31:22.160]  the psyops, how they're trying to cause these uprisings this weekend, it's the modern
[31:22.160 --> 31:26.640]  Reichstag 2.0, but it didn't go off like they wanted last Wednesday, so now they want the
[31:26.640 --> 31:31.240]  really big event, so they've gone and beaten up Roger Stone's wife, she was walking the
[31:31.240 --> 31:39.240]  dog, she's in the hospital, beat the hell out of her, and she's got to have surgery,
[31:39.240 --> 31:43.480]  and they had the FBI call us and say, yeah, we want you to come in for questioning about
[31:43.480 --> 31:47.520]  running the attack on the Capitol, now the official story is it was coordinated, first
[31:47.520 --> 31:51.720]  it was Trump's speech caused it, but now we know that before, we know who did it, Antifa
[31:51.720 --> 31:55.440]  was some paramilitary groups all together, which you're going to turn out to be feds
[31:55.440 --> 31:59.160]  with idiots they provocateur to be part of it, the Q people.
[31:59.160 --> 32:02.520]  And so I'm just very honored, people ask how am I taking this, I feel great man, I'm a
[32:02.520 --> 32:07.120]  patriot, I'm a good father, I've told the truth, I love America, and the fact that this
[32:07.120 --> 32:13.840]  global enemy controlled by the Communist Chinese wants to pin this on me, and wants to, and
[32:13.840 --> 32:20.160]  it has to beat Roger Stone's wife up, I mean that's who you are, fine, God is on our side,
[32:20.160 --> 32:25.440]  and you have God to deal with, and so, and I know the average person in the bureaucracy
[32:25.440 --> 32:29.600]  is not our enemy, they're saying the Capitol police have the articles right here, are being
[32:29.600 --> 32:34.800]  investigated for aiding and abetting, because they gave some of the stop the steal people
[32:34.800 --> 32:40.080]  tours, they're supposed to with congressmen, you think we went, you think we ran that,
[32:40.080 --> 32:46.000]  that's ridiculous, so that's what they're trying right now, and now saying, oh, it's
[32:46.000 --> 32:52.720]  a coordinated attack of the right wing, because they now know we know, this is Reichstag 2.0,
[32:52.720 --> 32:59.000]  Reichstag fire, the Reichstag fire, German fire, was a arson attack on the Reichstag
[32:59.000 --> 33:03.760]  government building, the Capitol, home of the government parliament, German parliament
[33:03.760 --> 33:08.960]  in Berlin on Monday the 27th, February 1933, precisely four weeks after Adolf Hitler was
[33:08.960 --> 33:15.320]  sworn in as chancellor of Germany, Hitler's government stated that, and it goes on, Marinus
[33:15.320 --> 33:21.040]  van der Leub and all the rest of it, so Hitler first only got elected president, it wasn't
[33:21.040 --> 33:24.800]  enough, and then there was, people were fighting over him, trying to become the Fuhrer, and
[33:24.800 --> 33:32.720]  have the former head of the Weimar Republic stepped down, and so they had to stage this
[33:32.720 --> 33:38.960]  event, that came out in the Nuremberg trial, so here we are, Reichstag 2.0, an incredible
[33:38.960 --> 33:44.440]  time to be alive, and John Rappaport's here with us to kind of recap what he said yesterday,
[33:44.440 --> 33:49.200]  and give us the latest developments, what do you make, what do you make of this insanity
[33:49.200 --> 33:51.240]  right now, John?
[33:51.240 --> 33:58.720]  Hi Alex, well as I described yesterday, this is a typical intelligence agency operation,
[33:58.720 --> 34:04.160]  look, the brutal lockdowns all over the world, the COVID lockdowns are meant, as we've been
[34:04.160 --> 34:09.520]  saying, to destroy economies, destroy hundreds of millions of lives, bring people to their
[34:09.520 --> 34:16.960]  knees and so on and so forth, so now, because of how they're characterizing the Capitol
[34:16.960 --> 34:25.720]  break-in on January 6th, they're now saying, well that equals any kind of protest that,
[34:25.720 --> 34:34.240]  quote, these people are going to try, against COVID, against the lockdowns, against masks,
[34:34.240 --> 34:41.080]  against the restrictions, it's all the same thing folks, it's a giant PSYOP equals sign
[34:41.080 --> 34:49.080]  planted in the public mind, to make the public believe that, hey, these 150 business owners
[34:49.080 --> 34:54.880]  that were just driven into bankruptcy, and are gathering near some governor's office
[34:54.880 --> 35:00.320]  to protest the lockdowns and the destruction of the economy, no, no, no, no, no, no, they're
[35:00.320 --> 35:08.440]  really, you see, the insurrectionists, the same insurrectionists as broke into the Capitol
[35:08.440 --> 35:15.040]  on January 6th, and they're revolutionaries that are very, very dangerous and they all
[35:15.040 --> 35:16.040]  have to be arrested.
[35:16.040 --> 35:21.320]  So this is used to put us into an actual emergency, which they're now basically announcing?
[35:21.320 --> 35:31.440]  Absolutely, it's, again, this equals that, equals this, equals that, it's just, we've
[35:31.440 --> 35:37.200]  got to lock down everything, and they're announcing it, that they're raising the levels of the
[35:37.200 --> 35:42.180]  lockdowns, it's worse than ever with the fake case numbers and all of that that we've described
[35:42.180 --> 35:44.120]  over and over again.
[35:44.120 --> 35:51.160]  But they know that the population is being driven closer and closer to the wall, the wall
[35:51.160 --> 35:57.800]  of destitution, no money, no resources, no anything, it's like having a dry tender forest
[35:57.800 --> 35:58.800]  in the middle of the summer.
[35:58.800 --> 36:03.040]  And it'll be a favor, let's pull back to the 35,000 foot, this is all the great reset,
[36:03.040 --> 36:07.120]  it's been a few minutes on that, this is all meant to happen, I mean, they've dialed all
[36:07.120 --> 36:08.120]  this up.
[36:08.120 --> 36:13.120]  Oh yeah, of course, they dialed it up a long time ago, they had to dial it up a long time
[36:13.120 --> 36:19.000]  ago, you don't just do this off the shelf and, you know, six months, it's like we drive
[36:19.000 --> 36:25.720]  the economies into total dissolution, destroy hundreds of millions of lives, put people
[36:25.720 --> 36:32.000]  in a completely suicidal state, and then we move in and we say, we're here to rescue
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.560]  you.
[36:33.560 --> 36:39.720]  We didn't do this, we're here to rescue you, currency reset, you're now on the dole, everybody's
[36:39.720 --> 36:40.720]  going to be saved.
[36:40.720 --> 36:44.240]  That'll deserve just announced universal basic income?
[36:44.240 --> 36:49.720]  Exactly, just enough to survive as long as you behave, as long as you do everything we
[36:49.720 --> 36:55.120]  tell you to do, otherwise the checks don't come in, you know, Chinese communist model,
[36:55.120 --> 37:00.760]  this is the whole, it's the China model from the beginning, that was the plan.
[37:00.760 --> 37:04.360]  We reset, technology moving in.
[37:04.360 --> 37:09.880]  I recently read a fantastic article in the Atlantic about the details, the devil is always
[37:09.880 --> 37:16.640]  in the details, of the staggering system of surveillance that China is bringing in in
[37:16.640 --> 37:20.880]  their own country and exporting to other countries.
[37:20.880 --> 37:30.200]  They are intent by 2030 on being able to cover in real time in China, every inch of square
[37:30.200 --> 37:34.120]  space indoors and outdoors in the entire country.
[37:34.120 --> 37:39.720]  Well, the quote by the government official that runs the AI social credit score is, if
[37:39.720 --> 37:44.200]  you don't do what we want, you will not be able to take one half step outside your house.
[37:44.200 --> 37:46.760]  Right, exactly.
[37:46.760 --> 37:47.840]  How could you?
[37:47.840 --> 37:51.680]  You won't have any money, you won't have any access to your bank account.
[37:51.680 --> 37:54.880]  What's this latest thing from Kurt Schilling?
[37:54.880 --> 38:02.120]  All of a sudden, just because he's a Trump supporter, he's a hero baseball player and
[38:02.120 --> 38:07.520]  so on and so forth, he says that AIG just cut off his insurance policies.
[38:07.520 --> 38:12.080]  And it just said to a bunch of mainline conservative talk shows, notice they've moved on past Alex
[38:12.080 --> 38:17.320]  Jones, they're now hitting mainline conservatives, they've done nothing to show, oh, turn to us,
[38:17.320 --> 38:19.360]  they're hitting them because they think they're weak.
[38:19.360 --> 38:25.240]  Absolutely, and they're saying, if you issue one word about stolen election or election
[38:25.240 --> 38:30.720]  fraud from this point on, you're fired, you're off the network, cumulus network basically
[38:30.720 --> 38:33.040]  said that gigantic number.
[38:33.040 --> 38:35.520]  You know, so they're just trying to shut down.
[38:35.520 --> 38:39.360]  And remember, Democrats challenged elections, everybody's supposed to be challenged elections,
[38:39.360 --> 38:42.360]  but now YouTube has officially said, if you challenge it, you'll be banned.
[38:42.360 --> 38:47.560]  Facebook has to, so the very group saying challenge election says, but if it's for Trump or Republican,
[38:47.560 --> 38:48.560]  you can't.
[38:48.560 --> 38:53.000]  He is total authoritarianism, total authoritarianism.
[38:53.000 --> 39:00.200]  And on top of that, if you challenge the election, well, you're really an insurrectionist.
[39:00.200 --> 39:02.320]  You want to overthrow the government.
[39:02.320 --> 39:04.240]  You're a revolutionary.
[39:04.240 --> 39:10.360]  You should be, you know, punished, put in jail, prosecuted, etc., etc., etc.
[39:10.360 --> 39:18.160]  These are the themes they play to equate in the mind, oh, this guy's on the major radio
[39:18.160 --> 39:19.160]  station.
[39:19.160 --> 39:20.880]  He's talking still about the stolen election.
[39:20.880 --> 39:26.400]  Well, he must be just like the people who broke into the Capitol on January 6th.
[39:26.400 --> 39:27.960]  He's an insurrectionist.
[39:27.960 --> 39:28.960]  He's a criminal.
[39:28.960 --> 39:30.120]  He should be cut off.
[39:30.120 --> 39:31.760]  He should be prosecuted.
[39:31.760 --> 39:33.640]  He should never get a job again.
[39:33.640 --> 39:36.080]  His bank account should be closed, etc., etc.
[39:36.080 --> 39:37.360]  John Radford, stay there.
[39:37.360 --> 39:41.280]  No more fake news.com or come right back and get your take on what we should do.
[39:41.280 --> 39:44.640]  How do we should fight back as I really respect you, you're one of the smart people we know.
[39:44.640 --> 39:45.640]  That's who our guest stars.
[39:45.640 --> 39:48.640]  The people out there, we're going to cover it all on the other side.
[39:48.640 --> 39:55.160]  I'm telling you, though, folks, rolling over to this is not the way to get out of it.
[39:55.160 --> 39:59.920]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling products and
[39:59.920 --> 40:04.160]  floors are no longer available, and I thought that Paula Block might be gone forever, but
[40:04.160 --> 40:09.840]  after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us.
[40:09.840 --> 40:11.960]  The rest, they hope, in a few months comes in.
[40:11.960 --> 40:17.760]  It's a proprietary system using specially-fed quail and their eggs.
[40:17.760 --> 40:23.000]  It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more, so get your
[40:23.000 --> 40:29.200]  Paula Block back in stock at infowarstore.com today, and, by the way, activated charcoal
[40:29.200 --> 40:31.720]  toothpaste sold out for months is now back in stock as well.

[40:36.120 --> 40:38.480]  charcoal toothpaste at infowarstore.com today.
[40:38.480 --> 40:42.400]  Again, our activated charcoal toothpaste doesn't have additives.
[40:42.400 --> 40:43.400]  It's concentrated.
[40:43.400 --> 40:44.400]  People love it.
[40:44.400 --> 40:45.400]  It's amazing.
[40:45.400 --> 40:48.480]  There's no toothpaste out there like it, and Paula Block is a proprietary as well.
[40:48.480 --> 40:50.480]  They're back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[40:50.480 --> 40:51.480]  infowarstore.com.
[40:51.480 --> 41:00.760]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search into the term, Davos Group, Technocracy or
[41:00.760 --> 41:01.760]  Technocrats.
[41:01.760 --> 41:09.440]  You will get Klaus Schwab and Sean Codd, Yunker and all the New World Order globalists like
[41:09.440 --> 41:14.760]  Gigi Pink saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments, that they
[41:14.760 --> 41:18.560]  want businessmen, technocrats over them, and that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[41:18.560 --> 41:22.840]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to
[41:22.840 --> 41:23.840]  bankrupt you and make you poor.
[41:23.840 --> 41:28.880]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is, but you see, he believes because he's
[41:28.880 --> 41:32.880]  hidden it playing you and you're not speaking out against it that he has a right to do it
[41:32.880 --> 41:33.880]  to you.
[41:33.880 --> 41:34.880]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[41:34.880 --> 41:36.880]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[41:36.880 --> 41:39.880]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[41:39.880 --> 41:43.880]  That means worldwide neo feudalism in his own works.
[41:43.880 --> 41:48.880]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you before
[41:48.880 --> 41:49.880]  you take those shots.
[41:49.880 --> 41:52.880]  You might just want to find out who this villain is.
[41:52.880 --> 41:54.880]  All right.
[41:54.880 --> 41:57.880]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[41:57.880 --> 42:00.880]  You've got to pray to God and get your soul ready.
[42:00.880 --> 42:03.880]  You've got to be prepared to physically defend yourself and your family.
[42:03.880 --> 42:08.880]  You've also got to get things that allow you and your family to not be dependent on the
[42:08.880 --> 42:09.880]  system.
[42:09.880 --> 42:11.880]  That's why they want to bankrupt the economy.
[42:11.880 --> 42:15.880]  It's why they want to destroy the infrastructure of this nation because they want all of us
[42:15.880 --> 42:19.880]  on our knees so they can dictate our surrender to them.
[42:19.880 --> 42:23.880]  Info Wars is a critical organization in the fight against the globalist.
[42:23.880 --> 42:27.880]  If you gave us straight up donations, that would be great because our work is important.

[43:29.880 --> 43:33.880]  But the new website is the resistance.video.
[43:33.880 --> 43:35.880]  The resistance.video.
[43:35.880 --> 43:40.880]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.880]  So the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[43:45.880 --> 43:50.880]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at the resistance.video.

[43:53.880 --> 43:55.880]  The resistance.video.
[43:56.880 --> 44:00.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:00.880 --> 44:07.880]  We are back live broadcasting for a lot of time on this, but we need funding to operate.
[44:07.880 --> 44:09.880]  And we got great products.
[44:09.880 --> 44:12.880]  And it could be the last time you can get an info war T shirt.

[44:30.880 --> 44:32.880]  Polyblock back in stock X2 back in stocks.
[44:32.880 --> 44:36.880]  We're about to tell you back in stock 50% off all those specials have to end next week.
[44:36.880 --> 44:38.880]  And people ask how are you handling this Jones?
[44:38.880 --> 44:39.880]  I've been steadfast.
[44:39.880 --> 44:40.880]  I've been a good guy.
[44:40.880 --> 44:46.880]  The weirdest thing is I just have anxiety about I better do a good job to fight this and stop it.
[44:46.880 --> 44:50.880]  And so at least we woke up a lot of the public, but it's here now.
[44:50.880 --> 44:52.880]  I was talking to rabbit port investigative journalist during the break.
[44:52.880 --> 44:53.880]  He said, yeah, it's here.
[44:53.880 --> 44:54.880]  I mean, it's on.
[44:54.880 --> 45:00.880]  And the whole thing at the Capitol, the provocateur desperate action like their Russia gate, like their Ukraine gate.
[45:00.880 --> 45:01.880]  It is falling apart.
[45:01.880 --> 45:03.880]  They're now I have CNN.
[45:03.880 --> 45:07.880]  They're investigating the Capitol police.
[45:07.880 --> 45:10.880]  That they they staged the attack because they stood down.
[45:10.880 --> 45:11.880]  They kill the head cop.
[45:11.880 --> 45:13.880]  They ordered to stand down.
[45:13.880 --> 45:17.880]  Now they say the Capitol police let this happen because they're not going to say Trump inside of it.
[45:17.880 --> 45:20.880]  Now there's a criminal terrorist conspiracy rappel board.
[45:20.880 --> 45:21.880]  But then we look at the video.
[45:21.880 --> 45:25.880]  It's guys with earpieces, obviously professional, not us.
[45:25.880 --> 45:27.880]  Did they hire a mercenary group?
[45:27.880 --> 45:28.880]  I don't know.
[45:28.880 --> 45:30.880]  But the idea that I did it is insane.
[45:30.880 --> 45:32.880]  You're a smart guy, a thin slicer.
[45:32.880 --> 45:34.880]  What do you make of what's happening right now?
[45:34.880 --> 45:36.880]  Yeah, I mean, you were there, Alex.
[45:36.880 --> 45:39.880]  But to me, it looks like one of these Nixon match operations.
[45:39.880 --> 45:43.880]  You had Antifa posing as Trumpers.
[45:43.880 --> 45:48.880]  You had paid infiltrators, a sort of like intelligence agency types.
[45:48.880 --> 45:51.880]  You had the Capitol police standing down.
[45:51.880 --> 45:55.880]  You had, you know, it was like, here's the open door.
[45:55.880 --> 45:57.880]  We want this break in.
[45:57.880 --> 46:08.880]  It has to happen because we got it on the drawing board and we're going to capitalize on the Capitol break in and turn it into the Capitol police.
[46:08.880 --> 46:17.880]  And turned it into an incredible, you know, wall to wall thing that we cover every day on and on and on.
[46:17.880 --> 46:25.880]  And we're going to suck more and more people into it and accuse them of being, you know, complete criminals and so on and so forth.
[46:25.880 --> 46:47.880]  I mean, you guys ran the story and I did a two on this 1983 bomb in the Capitol set off by this all female group called M19 with Susan Rosenberg, who turns up all these years later on the board of 1,000 currents.
[46:47.880 --> 46:51.880]  That is the funding group for Black Lives Matter.
[46:51.880 --> 47:02.880]  Oh, wow, you know, and then 1,000 currents removes the list of the board of directors on the website tries to scrub it out as if, ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[47:02.880 --> 47:06.880]  I mean, these things are years and years and years into planning.
[47:06.880 --> 47:10.880]  This wasn't like the day before somebody said, hey, I got an idea.
[47:10.880 --> 47:15.880]  Let's have a Capitol break in and we can parlay this into destroying all Trumpers.
[47:15.880 --> 47:18.880]  But it definitely disintegrated very, very quickly.
[47:18.880 --> 47:22.880]  And now I know probably Kushner brought this to Trump.
[47:22.880 --> 47:23.880]  It was his idea for the six.
[47:23.880 --> 47:25.880]  We're told, I'm sure we'll help the president.
[47:25.880 --> 47:26.880]  We'll have peaceful rallies.
[47:26.880 --> 47:29.880]  And the whole thing was to set Trump up, but it didn't work.
[47:29.880 --> 47:31.880]  And then they wanted me to lead it.
[47:31.880 --> 47:33.880]  I mean, give me and then Roger had a bad feeling.
[47:33.880 --> 47:34.880]  He didn't take part in it.
[47:34.880 --> 47:36.880]  Wow, this is crazy, brother.
[47:36.880 --> 47:40.880]  And then they were going to blame the whole thing on you.
[47:40.880 --> 47:41.880]  Right.
[47:41.880 --> 47:44.880]  Oh, they've got the API called wants us to come in right now.
[47:44.880 --> 47:52.880]  That the FBI saying, did you lead this after the Wall Street Journal retracted it?
[47:52.880 --> 47:56.880]  Well, that's why that's why they're so upset.
[47:56.880 --> 48:00.880]  And I just can't believe how criminal these people are.
[48:00.880 --> 48:08.880]  I mean, why the hell would I want when I have nothing to peaceful rallies all my life to like go storm the Capitol and look like an idiot and go to prison?
[48:08.880 --> 48:09.880]  Why would Trump want that?
[48:09.880 --> 48:11.880]  The idea that we have a motive is ridiculous.
[48:11.880 --> 48:15.880]  It's like saying I have a motive to chop my penis off.
[48:15.880 --> 48:19.880]  Yeah, it's like we want to commit suicide.
[48:19.880 --> 48:25.880]  So this is the way we've chosen, you know, I don't mean necessarily physical suicide, but.
[48:25.880 --> 48:27.880]  Cultural political suit.
[48:27.880 --> 48:28.880]  Exactly.
[48:28.880 --> 48:29.880]  No, I want to win.
[48:29.880 --> 48:30.880]  I want my country back.
[48:30.880 --> 48:31.880]  I don't want to be exactly.
[48:31.880 --> 48:33.880]  I'm not a jihadi.
[48:33.880 --> 48:34.880]  Exactly.
[48:34.880 --> 48:40.880]  The idea is to win the idea is to overcome the evil forces, not to do something.
[48:40.880 --> 48:46.880]  So incredibly insane that it just destroys the whole, you know, the whole.
[48:46.880 --> 48:47.880]  So what is your prediction?
[48:47.880 --> 48:50.880]  Because obviously that a lot of America's pissed.
[48:50.880 --> 48:51.880]  They saw the left burning things.
[48:51.880 --> 48:55.880]  Some people are being manipulated by this acute operation.
[48:55.880 --> 48:58.880]  They they're planning Cruck mom shootings this weekend.
[48:58.880 --> 48:59.880]  I know they are.
[48:59.880 --> 49:01.880]  We have the intel in the next week.
[49:01.880 --> 49:03.880]  You can just see it written on the wall.
[49:03.880 --> 49:04.880]  Oklahoma City 2.0.
[49:04.880 --> 49:06.880]  Reichstag 2.0.
[49:06.880 --> 49:09.880]  What do you think's coming up this weekend in the next week?
[49:09.880 --> 49:14.880]  I'm beginning to believe that because of what you're exposing here.
[49:14.880 --> 49:20.880]  And what a few other people are exposing that there's now thinking that maybe this is not
[49:20.880 --> 49:27.880]  going to be a great idea to suddenly stage all of these other, you know, false flags
[49:27.880 --> 49:31.880]  because you got to have secrecy and you got to have.
[49:31.880 --> 49:36.880]  Believability in order to just keep on staging one false flag after another.
[49:36.880 --> 49:42.880]  And if you look at info wars and a few other places and you see, wow, we're being exposed
[49:42.880 --> 49:43.880]  here completely.
[49:43.880 --> 49:46.880]  I mean, they're calling it like it is.
[49:46.880 --> 49:52.880]  Maybe we shouldn't be doing all of this because frankly, we're not very good at it.
[49:52.880 --> 49:58.880]  And number two, if we get exposed on one after another after another, this whole operation
[49:58.880 --> 49:59.880]  could fall apart.
[49:59.880 --> 50:01.880]  Maybe we should back off here.
[50:01.880 --> 50:07.880]  So I'm not so sure that they're really going to follow up here with one insane false flag
[50:07.880 --> 50:08.880]  after another.
[50:08.880 --> 50:12.880]  I totally agree with what you're saying because no one is buying this.
[50:12.880 --> 50:13.880]  Everyone is seeing through this.
[50:13.880 --> 50:15.880]  And like I said, I don't know who these groups are.
[50:15.880 --> 50:20.880]  They're professional military dressed up and they've arrested a few of the low levels that
[50:20.880 --> 50:26.880]  were just patsies or decoys like spies like us, but there was real professional mechanized
[50:26.880 --> 50:27.880]  groups there.
[50:27.880 --> 50:30.880]  This didn't come out of the organic population or out of Trump.
[50:30.880 --> 50:32.880]  This came out of the deep state.
[50:32.880 --> 50:36.880]  And I think they're really scared that this was supposed to be a lot bigger, a lot worse
[50:36.880 --> 50:38.880]  to smoke screen their operatives.
[50:38.880 --> 50:42.880]  But now everyone's watching all the video and figuring this out.
[50:42.880 --> 50:43.880]  Yeah.
[50:43.880 --> 50:49.880]  They're very slow to catch on to the video hunters, the video hunters who are everywhere.
[50:49.880 --> 50:51.880]  You know, look at this frame.
[50:51.880 --> 50:52.880]  Who is this guy?
[50:52.880 --> 50:54.880]  Where did he come from?
[50:54.880 --> 50:58.880]  Oh, I saw him at a protest in Arizona and I took his picture.
[50:58.880 --> 51:02.880]  Here he is with a giant, whatever, Q sign.
[51:02.880 --> 51:04.880]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, here's another guy.
[51:04.880 --> 51:07.880]  Who is this guy standing next to him?
[51:07.880 --> 51:09.880]  Oh, well, he was arrested over here.
[51:09.880 --> 51:11.880]  You know, all of this comes tumbling out.
[51:11.880 --> 51:13.880]  I arrested and let go.
[51:13.880 --> 51:17.880]  They've got this handful leader that you mentioned saying burn the Capitol down on video.
[51:17.880 --> 51:19.880]  He was released.
[51:19.880 --> 51:20.880]  Yeah.
[51:20.880 --> 51:24.880]  You know, it's like the Keystone cops.
[51:24.880 --> 51:27.880]  They just can't do anything but screw it up.
[51:27.880 --> 51:30.880]  They don't really know how to do it.
[51:30.880 --> 51:34.880]  This is, I mean, even if you look at the Reichstag fire of 1933.
[51:34.880 --> 51:36.880]  It didn't go the way the Germans.
[51:36.880 --> 51:38.880]  Well, it's a fire drill.
[51:38.880 --> 51:39.880]  It's insane.
[51:39.880 --> 51:41.880]  I didn't know what to do trying to stop it.
[51:41.880 --> 51:43.880]  It was like, I mean, you're in a mob of 200,000 people.
[51:43.880 --> 51:45.880]  There's no, I mean, it's crazy.
[51:45.880 --> 51:46.880]  Yeah.
[51:46.880 --> 51:51.880]  And you read accounts of people or listen to people who were actually there at the Capitol
[51:51.880 --> 51:55.880]  that day, among the million or two million, whatever it was.
[51:55.880 --> 52:00.880]  And all they talk about is how peaceful it was, how friendly everybody was,
[52:00.880 --> 52:05.880]  how everybody was, you know, out there enjoying themselves.
[52:05.880 --> 52:09.880]  Because that was the ocean of people not seeing the hundred or so that went in.
[52:09.880 --> 52:11.880]  Exactly.
[52:11.880 --> 52:16.880]  You know, that's the reality and the truth of it and people know it.
[52:16.880 --> 52:19.880]  Even people on the left know it.
[52:19.880 --> 52:22.880]  You know, geez, I mean, this is, yeah, look at this.
[52:22.880 --> 52:30.880]  Okay, so all of a sudden, when I saw this on television, these people walking between the polls,
[52:30.880 --> 52:37.880]  you know, it was like, okay, they're taking, they're taking a tour of the Capitol and the cops are leading them.
[52:37.880 --> 52:39.880]  This is unbelievable.
[52:39.880 --> 52:43.880]  I mean, is this a break in or did they buy tickets to this?
[52:43.880 --> 52:48.880]  You know, is there a tour guide who's explaining what these statues are?
[52:48.880 --> 52:52.880]  It's all very peaceful and leading right up to the door of the chamber.
[52:52.880 --> 52:59.880]  And then all of a sudden, you know, the publicity on this is, oh, they would have destroyed the Capitol and killed everybody
[52:59.880 --> 53:03.880]  if we hadn't intervened and they're the insurrectionists.
[53:03.880 --> 53:08.880]  And then, you know, the legislatures get up on their high horse and all of a sudden...
[53:08.880 --> 53:09.880]  Exactly.
[53:09.880 --> 53:16.880]  Maybe a few hundred people, yes, went in and maybe a dozen got violent and then the cops shot them and killed them.
[53:16.880 --> 53:20.880]  I mean, literally, this is a joke, but here's the deal.
[53:20.880 --> 53:23.880]  They had pipe bombs, Q was there, they're people.
[53:23.880 --> 53:24.880]  They meant this to be a lot bigger.
[53:24.880 --> 53:26.880]  It just didn't go off.
[53:26.880 --> 53:27.880]  Didn't go off.
[53:27.880 --> 53:33.880]  And all of a sudden, everybody's talking about the sanctity of the people's house,
[53:33.880 --> 53:39.880]  as if the business that goes on in the Senate and the House of Representatives is absolutely safe.
[53:39.880 --> 53:41.880]  All they're doing is selling the country out to the globalists.
[53:41.880 --> 53:42.880]  Oh, our holy house.
[53:42.880 --> 53:46.880]  When they're burning your house out in Kenosha or your car dealership in Portland, that's okay.
[53:46.880 --> 53:47.880]  When your restaurants get...
[53:47.880 --> 53:51.880]  Your books are being burned in Portland, that's okay, but now the sanctity of the house.
[53:51.880 --> 53:52.880]  Exactly.
[53:52.880 --> 53:54.880]  The sanctity of the house.
[53:54.880 --> 53:57.880]  You can riot and burn in loose cities across America.
[53:57.880 --> 53:59.880]  We're never going to call that insurrection.
[53:59.880 --> 54:01.880]  Absolutely not.
[54:01.880 --> 54:07.880]  This is all very highly legitimate and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[54:07.880 --> 54:14.880]  You know, these communities and inner cities are the pawns in this game.
[54:14.880 --> 54:16.880]  They're being taken for a ride.
[54:16.880 --> 54:18.880]  You want to know the truth?
[54:18.880 --> 54:27.880]  If Antifa and BLM had their heads on straight, they would be out in the streets protesting drug cartels and banks, maybe,
[54:27.880 --> 54:35.880]  because those are the people that are using them to distribute gangs, to distribute the drugs all over the country.
[54:35.880 --> 54:37.880]  This is what these gangs are destroying.
[54:37.880 --> 55:06.880]  John Ronald-Mortz, stay there. We're right back in two minutes.
[55:07.880 --> 55:09.880]  We'll see you in the next video.
[55:37.880 --> 55:48.880]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare.
[55:48.880 --> 55:52.880]  The United Nations, the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big farmer,
[55:52.880 --> 55:57.880]  are all pushing the covers of the most deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold,
[55:57.880 --> 56:01.880]  but if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it.
[56:01.880 --> 56:03.880]  That's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing homes.
[56:03.880 --> 56:10.880]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said
[56:10.880 --> 56:15.880]  that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones, are basically bioweapons and are super deadly,
[56:15.880 --> 56:22.880]  and now they're having to resuscitate people that die, basically, when they take it, just like newborn babies, they give vaccines.
[56:22.880 --> 56:25.880]  They have to resuscitate them all the time, or a lot of times they just let them die.
[56:25.880 --> 56:27.880]  And that's on the record. It does that.
[56:27.880 --> 56:53.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:57.880 --> 57:03.880]  John Rappaport is our guest. We need to get him back up for a commercial free interview.
[57:03.880 --> 57:06.880]  Maybe this Saturday he'll do it. I'll come in and do it like a two-hour live show.
[57:06.880 --> 57:08.880]  Two to four p.m. if he wants to do it.
[57:08.880 --> 57:11.880]  Best to get a journal. Smart guy. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[57:11.880 --> 57:16.880]  In closing, yesterday you laid it out. Now they're planning these false flags.
[57:16.880 --> 57:18.880]  They're priming everybody. They're so desperate.
[57:18.880 --> 57:22.880]  Hitler really wasn't popular when he stole the election in 1933.
[57:22.880 --> 57:24.880]  Biden isn't popular when he stole the election.
[57:24.880 --> 57:29.880]  The globalists repeat what works. They're very OCD.
[57:29.880 --> 57:34.880]  But again, we've entered a new paradigm. What other great knowledge, the four or five minutes we have left,
[57:34.880 --> 57:38.880]  you want to impart to the audience, John Rappaport?
[57:38.880 --> 57:43.880]  Well, I think you can see in the very basis of the Constitution, you have the right to live.
[57:43.880 --> 57:45.880]  You have the right to earn a living.
[57:45.880 --> 57:52.880]  The whole idea was freedom of the individual to earn a living by his own hand.
[57:52.880 --> 57:59.880]  So now people have to open up the economy any way they possibly can.
[57:59.880 --> 58:05.880]  This way, that way, upside down, sideways, backwards, in pockets and places,
[58:05.880 --> 58:09.880]  which is already happening all over the country. They're just not publicizing it.
[58:09.880 --> 58:15.880]  Because the lockdowns are the way to destroy and lead us into phase two,
[58:15.880 --> 58:18.880]  which is the massive globalist technocracy.
[58:18.880 --> 58:25.880]  And so if the economy just keeps on going, because individuals, people who are free,
[58:25.880 --> 58:34.880]  who know they're free, and find a way somehow, ingeniously, to keep this economy open,
[58:34.880 --> 58:41.880]  which they are doing, expand that, expand that, expand that, until there's nothing that these people can do,
[58:41.880 --> 58:43.880]  because there's too many others.
[58:43.880 --> 58:47.880]  That's right. Only go to the mom and pops, go to the farm, start your own business,
[58:47.880 --> 58:50.880]  and realize they're trying to put you under siege in their own words,
[58:50.880 --> 58:54.880]  to consolidate, to bankrupt you, to go on a universal guaranteed income,
[58:54.880 --> 58:59.880]  to then dictate where you can spend that money and how you live your life, the final takeover.
[58:59.880 --> 59:05.880]  Exactly. Exactly. It's like, you can only spend your money here.
[59:05.880 --> 59:08.880]  We hypnotize you over and over again. You can only spend your money here.
[59:08.880 --> 59:13.880]  No, you can't. You can spend it wherever you can. Find a way to spend it.
[59:13.880 --> 59:20.880]  During the Great Depression, one of the great parts of unwritten history is the millions of people in America
[59:20.880 --> 59:25.880]  who found a way to keep their economy locally going, because what did they do?
[59:25.880 --> 59:27.880]  They looked around and they said, hey, guess what?
[59:27.880 --> 59:33.880]  We still have all the same natural resources we had yesterday before the banks were closed and crashed.
[59:33.880 --> 59:38.880]  Exactly. The bankers cut things off to consolidate, so people just said, we'll just barter.
[59:38.880 --> 59:45.880]  Yeah, we'll just barter. We'll invent our own currencies, and they did 3,000 currencies across America
[59:45.880 --> 59:52.880]  that were invented by people in order to keep the economy open, because they said, hey, if New York wants to crash,
[59:52.880 --> 59:58.880]  if the stock market wants to be engineered and the Federal Reserve wants to inflate, deflate...
[59:58.880 --> 1:00:02.880]  But isn't that it? Like, they're imploding their own blue cities to make us implode,
[1:00:02.880 --> 1:00:05.880]  but if we recognize that and don't give in, they fail.
[1:00:05.880 --> 1:00:08.880]  I mean, they're really involved in a desperate gambit here.
[1:00:08.880 --> 1:00:12.880]  They are. They're absolutely. I mean, I think about New York.
[1:00:12.880 --> 1:00:19.880]  You know, I mean, you think this is easy? That they're really going to destroy New York completely?
[1:00:19.880 --> 1:00:26.880]  I mean, I've lived in New York for a long time. I was born in New York. I don't care what's happening now.
[1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:32.880]  That's a very hard place to completely wipe out, and they think they're doing it.
[1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:35.880]  That's exactly what the Blasio Cuomo with the rest of us is doing.
[1:00:35.880 --> 1:00:39.880]  But notice Cuomo starting to back off now, because he knows he's reaping a whirlwind.
[1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:45.880]  Exactly. He's trying to say, okay, so now... wait a minute now, actually we can start reopening this and that.
[1:00:45.880 --> 1:00:53.880]  Yeah, because you drive people close enough to the wall, things are going to happen. You can't predict.
[1:00:53.880 --> 1:01:00.880]  It can only go on for so long before the people say, well, I've got nothing to lose now. I want my freedom.
[1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:08.880]  Awesome. We love you. No more fake news.com. 30 second closing comment.
[1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:15.880]  You're doing a fantastic thing here, Alec. You've been doing it for a long time. I don't know how. I really don't.
[1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:20.880]  I'm speaking honestly here. I'm not trying to blow smoke.
[1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:30.880]  I'm just carrying on this battle, this war against the forces of evil, because that's what they are. That's what they've been doing.
[1:01:30.880 --> 1:01:36.880]  And I remember talking to you on the phone about 25, 27 years ago. You called me up one day after I was on a show.
[1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:41.880]  You said, we got to talk about this stuff, and that's how we met. That's what we did.
[1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:46.880]  And, you know, it's unbelievable to me.
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:52.880]  I love you, John. We're in this together. We'll talk to you soon. There goes John Rabaport. We got a victim of the system coming up.
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:02:00.880]  Now is the time to get prepared. You got to pray to God and get your soul ready. You got to be prepared to physically defend yourself and your family.
[1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:06.880]  And you've also got to get things that allow you and your family to not be dependent on the system.
[1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:11.880]  That's why they want to bankrupt the economy. It's why they want to destroy the infrastructure of this nation,
[1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:16.880]  because they want all of us on our knees so they can dictate our surrender to them.
[1:02:16.880 --> 1:02:20.880]  Info Wars is a critical organization in the fight against the globalist.
[1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:25.880]  And if you gave us straight up donations, that would be great because our work is important. We appreciate it.
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:33.880]  But we bring you great products so that you get high quality products at the same time as supporting the Info War 360 win.
[1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:41.880]  Well, we've only got a few days left to get 2020 prices before the prices go up on high quality storeable food with huge discounts,
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:47.880]  as big as $850 discount on a year's supply of food at infowarstore.com.
[1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:54.880]  So take advantage of these sales right now at infowarstore.com while you still can.
[1:02:54.880 --> 1:03:05.880]  So I would say, you know, if anything that's happening at CNN and anybody who buys your book, it's really just one of those things that is dividing our nation.
[1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:13.880]  And I don't believe in dividing our nation. It hurts our great nation. And so CNN is really the enemy of the truth.
[1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:15.880]  And that's my opinion. Thank you.
[1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:21.880]  No American is an enemy of another American. No news outlet is an enemy of America.
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:41.880]  No news outlet is an enemy of America. No news outlet is an enemy of America.
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:43.880]  They came in peace.
[1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:23.880]  No news outlets in the enemy of America. Bill Gates loves you. Take the vaccine. Don't run. CNN's your friend.
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:26.880]  This is CNN.
[1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:34.880]  Congresswoman, I understand though you have something pressing, something important and something new you'd like to share with everybody.
[1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:42.880]  Yes, I would like to announce on behalf of the American people, we have to make sure that our leaders are held accountable.
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:54.880]  We cannot have a president of the United States that is willing to abuse the power of the office of the presidency and be easily bought off by foreign governments,
[1:04:54.880 --> 1:05:08.880]  foreign Chinese or Chinese energy companies, Ukrainian energy companies. So on January 21st, I will be filing articles of impeachment on Joe Biden.
[1:05:08.880 --> 1:05:18.880]  Wow. Articles of impeachment on Joe Biden on his first full day as president. I'm looking at Hunter Biden right now, so we're talking about Joe.
[1:05:18.880 --> 1:05:28.880]  Obviously, we know Hunter's got issues as well. How is that going to work? You are a freshman. You're in the minority.
[1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:34.880]  What will happen next? Is this symbolic or can you really do something about this?
[1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:50.880]  Well, like I said, I'm a big believer in having people in office that are actually willing to do the job. And I can't imagine people in this country being so fearful of a future of a Biden presidency that they may be willing to
[1:05:50.880 --> 1:06:04.880]  commit violence like they did in the Capitol here in Washington, D.C. We cannot have that. I do not condone that violence. The American people need hope. They need to know that there are Republicans in Congress that are willing to stand up and fight for them,
[1:06:04.880 --> 1:06:14.880]  regardless of being in a minority, regardless of having all at odds against us against me or against anyone in Congress. We have to hold people accountable.
[1:06:14.880 --> 1:06:24.880]  Joe Biden is on record on the phone saying that he would withhold a billion dollars of foreign aid if he didn't get his way with these deals with his son, Hunter.
[1:06:24.880 --> 1:06:34.880]  And there's an ongoing investigation with Hunter Biden's laptop into being bought and paid for by Chinese, communist Chinese energy companies.
[1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:45.880]  This is a dangerous threat to our country when we have a man that will be holding the power of the presidency, but will so easily and is on record for abusing power.
[1:07:05.880 --> 1:07:20.880]  All right, I thought about this guy a couple days ago because he's one of the only people to get caught up in an FBI setup sting and not end up dead or in prison for life.
[1:07:20.880 --> 1:07:34.880]  And so I'm not going to get into our whole backstory or the rest of it, but I know when I see a federal operation. And so I don't know, eight, nine, 10 years ago, whatever it was, I saw Santelian. I thought that's all the funding when he was doing all of it. I thought this is a setup.
[1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:43.880]  And he could get really pissed. I'm not a fed. Don't you call me that. I was like, okay, well, if you're not a fed, you're being run by them. Then they tried to set him up three times. They tried to put him in prison.
[1:07:43.880 --> 1:07:53.880]  And once I saw him put him in prison and read the court service, okay, the guys in the city got set up, but he survived the Bundy stuff or several rounds, other rounds. He can tell you what this is all about.
[1:07:53.880 --> 1:08:03.880]  You know, I'm shown to your back live. And since I talked to him yesterday on his own show, it's not a drama thing. I don't want to make a big deal about it.
[1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:15.880]  I was like, we want you and your security people to come in for questioning. You know, we're all friendly here. We know you didn't do anything. We know you were there trying to stop it, Alex, but we have anonymous tips that you were running the attack inside the cap.
[1:08:15.880 --> 1:08:26.880]  We want to talk to you. I'm like, okay, well, you can just talk to you just talk to my lawyers. So this is where we're at. This is Reichstag 2.0. This just happened this morning.
[1:08:26.880 --> 1:08:36.880]  Roger Stone didn't want to make a big deal about it because his wife knows he has a temper issue like I do. She got beat up two nights ago. She's in the hospital now outside their house.
[1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:45.880]  The guy ran over with a bike. It's in a condo area. Nobody's around. Got over and pushed her down two more times, 74 years old, beat her up.
[1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:49.880]  And she finally told Roger I'm hurt. I got in the hospital. The guy beat me up.
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:57.880]  He was on there and said, yes, some guy ran into her and knocked her over. She didn't want him to go crazy. Well, they actually beat the living hell out of her.
[1:08:57.880 --> 1:09:05.880]  They got beat the living hell out of her. So that's where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen. So Roger's in hiding. He's going to come on the night and emergency transmission.
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:12.880]  We're going to tape and then we're going to post it to Band-Aid video while he still can. But I want you to know this is a communist global takeover.
[1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:22.880]  Okay. But here's the craziness. There now, I showed you the headlines. AP, Reuters, CNN. Oh, the Capitol Police are involved with the right wing terrorists.
[1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:32.880]  So the Capitol Police know they were ordered to stand down. Capitol Police know military came in. The same type, classes rescue teams, special forces that the FBI has.
[1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:38.880]  Same type. I saw the videos. I know those guys. I know what they look like. And he's experienced this.
[1:09:38.880 --> 1:09:46.880]  And so he saw it. Well, now they're trying to go, oh, Trump didn't inside it as a speech. There was a plan terror group.
[1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:55.880]  You mean provocateur groups. You mean groups led by the feds. So Pete Santelli's here. Pete live.TV. We've had quite the history and I appreciate him.
[1:09:55.880 --> 1:10:03.880]  He's been through a lot. He's here with us. This is a short segment. I have you for the rest of the hour, but I got to work in a lot of the other breaking stuff here that's happening.
[1:10:03.880 --> 1:10:15.880]  But I want to warn people not to be part of violence or if you go out just to cover something, you could be set up. So spend just three minutes on what happened to you just briefly and what woke you up.
[1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:22.880]  You know, you were mentioning that that they were contacting you and asking you questions about your potential involvement.
[1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:34.880]  And I'm here to tell you that at no point in time that I ever break the law through the Bundy Ranch and the Mallier thing, what ended up happening is that they at the FBI.
[1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:41.880]  Now, I'm going to say some things that are disparaging towards the the upper echelon of the FBI, of course, rank and file or they're just doing their job.
[1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:57.880]  But I have personal firsthand knowledge that the FBI is corrupt at the highest end. They fabricated a 302 report stating that they had a witness that said that I conspired to take over the Mallier National Wildlife Refuge.
[1:10:57.880 --> 1:11:05.880]  Well, guess what? The worst thing they ever did was to scoop up an investigative journalist because we pieced together a case that exposed them.
[1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:13.880]  We caught them. The witness said that they didn't say that. And I also had an alibi. So my point is, Alex, if they want you, they're going to get you.
[1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:30.880]  And ultimately, this is what they're going to do. That domestic terrorism designation that everyone is under that umbrella, they use that not just to demonize people, but to give the FBI and the DOJ the legal authorization to surveil everybody.
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:35.880]  They're going to surveil everybody. They're going to listen in and then they're going to cherry pick and build a conspiracy case.
[1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:43.880]  This is what will happen to anybody that they want to pursue, like they did with me back in January of 2016, is they will get you off the street.
[1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:52.880]  I was actually held as a political prisoner for 619 days. Now, remember, our system says that we're innocent until proven guilty.
[1:11:52.880 --> 1:12:04.880]  They'll declare it to be a complex case. They'll declare you or anyone else to be a domestic terrorist that they want to scoop up. And you'll be held for two years plus awaiting trial.
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:10.880]  Fully innocent, but essentially they're holding you because you're a danger to society. That happened to me.
[1:12:10.880 --> 1:12:19.880]  Now, fortunately, I won. I refused to plead out early. That's what people do. They get scared away. I had four multiple life sentences.
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:26.880]  That's why they have a 97% success rate in the federal judiciary. I said, no, we're going to go to trial after two years.
[1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:37.880]  And essentially we won two federal trials in Oregon and in Nevada, exposing what I'm going to talk about today, which is the most important information.
[1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:42.880]  And I've listened to you for two decades, most important information that I could ever speak.
[1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:49.880]  Oh, believe me, I want to hear it. I'm in the crosshairs of this thing. They're measuring my supermax right now. We're right back.
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:23.880]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is. It is the destruction of society as we know it. It is making the population poor.
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:34.880]  By design, so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family. They're destroying civilization, rebuild it in their dystopic image.
[1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:46.880]  We are fighting this at infowars.com and newswars.com. We are fighting for a pro-human future and we need you to get the facts, to research and share with others and join the fight. God bless you.
[1:13:46.880 --> 1:14:05.880]  Visit us, spread the word, at infowars.com. Three, two, one. Here we go.
[1:14:17.880 --> 1:14:24.880]  25% off at infowars.com. Hollenblock again is available in this one minute ad. I don't have time to tell you all about it.
[1:14:24.880 --> 1:14:34.880]  But believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally, unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache.
[1:14:34.880 --> 1:14:42.880]  This is naturally occurring. It's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us.
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:48.880]  You chew up the pills, they taste great. It's available again at infowars.com. Hollenblock.
[1:14:53.880 --> 1:14:57.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:14:57.880 --> 1:15:18.880]  So Joe Biden steals this big election. It's a Chocom agent. What are they going to do?
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:25.880]  Well, Hitler stole an election and 33 wasn't popular, called the Reichstag Fire. They used that to bring in martial law.
[1:15:25.880 --> 1:15:29.880]  And the Gestapo. So Pete Stantelli is a Marine Corps veteran journalist.
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:36.880]  Patriot got sucked in to covering a lot of big events, a lot of big national events, a lot of land battles.
[1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:42.880]  And got set up and while awaiting trial, spent 600 plus days in jail, but didn't roll over.
[1:15:42.880 --> 1:15:53.880]  So with your knowledge, your background of the infiltrators of how they work, of what happens, tell people you're viewing what's currently happening and your expert observations.
[1:15:53.880 --> 1:16:00.880]  Okay, now January 6th, our Commander-in-Chief, my Commander-in-Chief, your Commander-in-Chief, called us to go to a peaceful protest in Washington, D.C.
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:12.880]  I didn't hesitate, but I knew full well what we were potentially in for. The best thing that we could have ever had was a million and a half people like we did standing shoulder to shoulder peacefully
[1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:17.880]  so that our elected officials would be held to account after a 1 p.m. vote.
[1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:27.880]  But I knew full well, with full situational awareness, especially with the experience that I had in 2014 with Bundy Ranch, 2016 with Malier,
[1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:36.880]  is that not just Antifa slash BLM, but I'm here to tell you this and I have legal proof of this. I was in charge of all the discovery.
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:43.880]  I did not know about what I'm about to share until after I saw how the FBI operates.
[1:16:43.880 --> 1:16:52.880]  The people right next to you that are most trusted, let's say security, because I'll use an example, January 2016,
[1:16:52.880 --> 1:17:02.880]  the man that led Levois Fennecombe and that convoy into his demise was actually the head of security for the team.
[1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:13.880]  He was the most trusted person. He was given upwards of $100,000 by the FBI to lead them into an ambush in a dead zone.
[1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:21.880]  The Oregon State troopers were there. So what I'm here to tell you is that the people that are around you, even your most trusted,
[1:17:21.880 --> 1:17:28.880]  are going to be the most likely confidential human sources and the most likely operatives.
[1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:34.880]  We have a million and a half people who are the operatives out there. Now, when I look back at Bundy Ranch, Bundy Ranch,
[1:17:34.880 --> 1:17:41.880]  and the reason why they won that trial is because it was an entrapment. They lured all the patriots to go get the cattle,
[1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:48.880]  although the protest, it wasn't even a standoff. It was a protest where Clive and Bundy asked the sheriff to come to the stage
[1:17:48.880 --> 1:17:54.880]  and to address the people and he was going to demand that the sheriff protect life, liberty and property.
[1:17:54.880 --> 1:18:05.880]  This is April 2014. The goons that we're talking about that have infiltrated our government, these leftist communist subverters of our Constitution,
[1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:14.880]  literally worked since January of 2014 all the way to April of 2014 to set up this entrapment.
[1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:23.880]  They had 1,000 online covert investigators. They had basically tried to provoke by showing pictures of MRAPs that were being staged.
[1:18:23.880 --> 1:18:27.880]  But it didn't go the way they wanted. Why at the end did it blow up in their face?
[1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:35.880]  Well, it blew up in their face because they only presented because they cherry-picked. They only present, for instance, my words on my radio show
[1:18:35.880 --> 1:18:43.880]  where I said, we're going to stand and fight and then they leave that in the indictment and they leave out the part where I said,
[1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:50.880]  we're going to stand and fight for our constitutional rights and we're even going to be protective of federal law enforcement.
[1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:57.880]  They do that to me. I'm like, we need to peacefully fight with the spirit of 1776. It's like, we need to fight 1776.
[1:18:57.880 --> 1:19:03.880]  Yeah, right. They will cherry-pick your words. They'll put that in the indictment. Of course, they'll do that with everybody.
[1:19:03.880 --> 1:19:07.880]  But ultimately, they set the stage for all of this. This is what they do, Alex.
[1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:13.880]  January 6th, I believe, is a test run for what I'm really concerned about.
[1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:17.880]  And this is why this is the most important information I can relay is because it was a test run.
[1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:23.880]  They wanted to see how they could manipulate with a couple of antifa people breaking the window, affecting your crime,
[1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:28.880]  and then exploiting the emotions that we know exist to lure people in.
[1:19:28.880 --> 1:19:33.880]  I believe that this is a test run for what is to come.
[1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:37.880]  They reverse engineer an indictment. They already have their indictment.
[1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:41.880]  They already know who they're going to go get. They're going to reverse engineer it.
[1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:49.880]  You and I know what the Higalian dialectic is. They're going to create the crisis environment to where people are so emotionally charged
[1:19:49.880 --> 1:19:55.880]  that they're going to be brought into a scenario, I believe, I see every single sign, and we need to be alert to it,
[1:19:55.880 --> 1:20:01.880]  that on January 20th, our commander-in-chief hasn't called us to a peaceful protest to Washington, D.C.
[1:20:01.880 --> 1:20:05.880]  He just said, wherever you protest, protest peacefully.
[1:20:05.880 --> 1:20:12.880]  I believe that they're setting the stage. The FBI said that they forewarned the Capitol Police that there were going to be some agitators coming in.
[1:20:12.880 --> 1:20:16.880]  How do they know that? Because those agitators worked for the FBI.
[1:20:16.880 --> 1:20:22.880]  They had let the Capitol Police's guard down. They allowed this thing to take place.
[1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:27.880]  They had their operatives breaking the window, and then obviously the emotion involved in just walking in.
[1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:36.880]  Three years ago from 2018, but it was from 2015, the headline of Info Wars was Obama planned martial law in Maryland,
[1:20:36.880 --> 1:20:42.880]  and the documents were there where they planned to go provocateur and get it to be triggered.
[1:20:42.880 --> 1:20:46.880]  We actually have the anti-fidocamers. That's what they do.
[1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:54.880]  Alex, I'm going to use just another example, but I want to really get to present it because that's what impacts every single one of your viewers
[1:20:54.880 --> 1:20:57.880]  and every single American's lives right now.
[1:20:57.880 --> 1:21:04.880]  Have full situational awareness in that they will set the stage that if a Reichstag is to occur,
[1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:09.880]  if a major crisis is to occur, it's because they've already prescripted it.
[1:21:09.880 --> 1:21:15.880]  They need to do a gun grab, and they can't just say, well, Joe Biden's against guns, he's going to come door to door and confiscate them.
[1:21:15.880 --> 1:21:22.880]  No, they need a crisis to say, oh my goodness, they want to cause half of the people that own guns to turn them in voluntarily.
[1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:26.880]  Why? Because we're being subjected to psychological warfare.
[1:21:26.880 --> 1:21:33.880]  They need to create a very traumatic situation to where people will die because of guns that were involved,
[1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:39.880]  either in D.C. or at the state houses, and thereby everybody needs to turn in their guns voluntarily.
[1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:46.880]  Half of the people will, the other half will be used in the media to further traumatize the American public
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:50.880]  and demonize anybody that should go anywhere near a gun, of course.
[1:21:50.880 --> 1:21:56.880]  I say, do what you do. I'm not going to tell somebody to not go to an open carry protest.
[1:21:56.880 --> 1:21:57.880]  Make a decision on your own.
[1:21:57.880 --> 1:22:00.880]  The point is, the globalists are trying to have a major set up right now.
[1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:03.880]  It's clear they're doing it, and they want to have a mass shooting.
[1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:05.880]  They want a black church blown up.
[1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:07.880]  I mean, you can write the script, a truck bombing federal building.
[1:22:07.880 --> 1:22:09.880]  This is the time they're going to do it.
[1:22:09.880 --> 1:22:12.880]  The fact that we're talking about it may stop them from doing it.
[1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:17.880]  Alex, you and I know there's two things as far as mind control is concerned.
[1:22:17.880 --> 1:22:24.880]  We're talking about two things. One being sex is a great way to mind control people using sex.
[1:22:24.880 --> 1:22:30.880]  And the second thing is death, trauma-based mind control.
[1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:35.880]  When people die, like on 9-11, we're ready to surrender to the Patriot acts.
[1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:43.880]  That's right. We have human drives of sex, food, and war killing, and then that's how they manipulate us.
[1:22:43.880 --> 1:22:50.880]  Yes, they're getting ready. I believe we need to be aware of what we have the potential to see on January 20th.
[1:22:50.880 --> 1:22:53.880]  January 6th being the test run.
[1:22:53.880 --> 1:23:00.880]  They've already used an entire week of just conditioning everyone that if you're a Trump supporter, you're a domestic terrorist.
[1:23:00.880 --> 1:23:05.880]  In the court of public opinion, you look at somebody that's a Trump supporter.
[1:23:05.880 --> 1:23:09.880]  You've now been told over the past week or so that they're a domestic terrorist.
[1:23:09.880 --> 1:23:15.880]  This next phase, they could literally finish off everyone's minds that are vulnerable to this.
[1:23:15.880 --> 1:23:18.880]  I agree. Let's talk about that. I'm not trying to attack the Q people.
[1:23:18.880 --> 1:23:25.880]  A lot of nice people got into it, but it claims responsibility for all knowledge about the globalist and then claims it's in charge.
[1:23:25.880 --> 1:23:27.880]  Some competition with the Q thing. That's what it always spends.
[1:23:27.880 --> 1:23:31.880]  Oh, you don't like our big secrets. No. You're leading people in to trust the plan. Trump's invincible.
[1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:34.880]  Oh, now forget Trump. Cuse the boss.
[1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:42.880]  And then it leads these people into following anti-fund of the capital. Pete Santillis, our guest, infowars.com, newswars.com, tomorrow is Tuesday.
[1:23:42.880 --> 1:23:47.880]  Ezra LeVan will be joining us and Matt Brackett. Stay with us.
[1:23:47.880 --> 1:23:52.880]  I want to warn all patriots in the United States and across the world that listen to my voice.
[1:23:52.880 --> 1:23:58.880]  I'm Alex Jones. I've been in this fight 27 years and I've studied every angle of their operations.
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:09.880]  And I'm here to tell you as clear as day. They have organizations on message boards and other groups posing as patriot leaders and posing as President Trump,
[1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:15.880]  anonymously telling you to have arm marches in all 50 states coming up on the 20th and before that.
[1:24:15.880 --> 1:24:20.880]  You are being set up. I was there in D.C. with a million peaceful people.
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:25.880]  And I watched Antifa and other leftist groups pose to our people and set us up.
[1:24:25.880 --> 1:24:30.880]  Thank God the patriots did not engage in the rioting, so only a few people did it.
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:34.880]  So the thing was a misfire. It was a dud.
[1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:37.880]  But the left is hungry to declare all Trump supporters terrorist.
[1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:42.880]  And they're planning terrorist attacks and mass shootings on the 20th to blame the American people.
[1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:47.880]  Do not be part of it. We are peaceful. We are not violent.
[1:24:47.880 --> 1:24:52.880]  Now is the time to get prepared. You got to pray to God and get your soul ready.
[1:24:52.880 --> 1:24:55.880]  You got to be prepared to physically defend yourself and your family.
[1:24:55.880 --> 1:25:01.880]  And you've also got to get things that allow you and your family to not be dependent on the system.
[1:25:01.880 --> 1:25:03.880]  That's why they want to bankrupt the economy.
[1:25:03.880 --> 1:25:06.880]  It's why they want to destroy the infrastructure of this nation.
[1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:11.880]  Because they want all of us on our knees so they can dictate our surrender to them.
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:16.880]  Info Wars is a critical organization in the fight against the globalist.

[1:27:05.880 --> 1:27:11.880]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[1:27:17.880 --> 1:27:22.880]  Alright so most of you that tune in to regular listeners know who Pete Santillius and Alex Jones your host
[1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:26.880]  but he was involved as an investigative journalist and the whole Bundy thing and so much more.
[1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:32.880]  Not set up for terrorism basically but they had dropped the case later as it was all fraud
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:35.880]  and he's warning you about what you're seeing right now.
[1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:38.880]  How are they going to put in, divide them, just stole the election?
[1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:40.880]  How are they going to get away with this?
[1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:42.880]  We're going to stage events.
[1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:49.880]  They try to say that Trump attacked the capitol but the attack didn't happen like the provocateurs wanted because the Trump supporters fought back.
[1:27:49.880 --> 1:27:53.880]  It's not understanding that shadowy military groups were involved under Trump's control.
[1:27:53.880 --> 1:27:55.880]  Now they're going with that angle, that's going nowhere.
[1:27:55.880 --> 1:27:59.880]  Why the hell would Trump discredit himself like this?
[1:27:59.880 --> 1:28:03.880]  So Pete, getting into the modern situation, what's currently happening?
[1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:05.880]  I'm going to shut up this nine-minute segment left.
[1:28:05.880 --> 1:28:10.880]  You've got the floor from your experience as one of the people that's been through this as a journalist and as a political prisoner.
[1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:13.880]  What are you expecting? What would you look out for?
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:25.880]  You know, of course, I'm all about optimism and constitutionality and hoping that President Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act
[1:28:25.880 --> 1:28:30.880]  but I'm also, as an investigative journalist, I have an obligation to tell everyone the truth.
[1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:32.880]  And the truth is, I don't have any evidence of that.
[1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:35.880]  I can hope for that but we have no evidence of it.
[1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:43.880]  So what psychological impact does that have on my fellow Americans, on our fellow Americans, is that you're put into,
[1:28:43.880 --> 1:28:52.880]  this could be potentially as part of that psychological warfare to put everybody into a catatonic slumber,
[1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:58.880]  to let your guard down, thinking that President Trump is going to save us with some sort of an executive order.
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:02.880]  And it could be also disinformation coming through channels like the cue boards.
[1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:06.880]  I love the cue pages. I am one of those people that would go to the cue board,
[1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:11.880]  receive an article that I had never seen because of the censorship in the mainstream media.
[1:29:11.880 --> 1:29:15.880]  But ultimately, there's also the potential for disinformation coming my way.
[1:29:15.880 --> 1:29:17.880]  So you have to not let your guard down.
[1:29:17.880 --> 1:29:25.880]  Everyone needs to think right now, what if President Trump has been powered down by the global elite?
[1:29:25.880 --> 1:29:29.880]  We know how powerful they are. Trillions and trillions of dollars are at stake.
[1:29:29.880 --> 1:29:34.880]  So what if, in fact, the exact opposite happens as far as mass arrests?
[1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:41.880]  What if on January 21st or on the 20th, Joe Biden is sworn in, on the 21st,
[1:29:41.880 --> 1:29:48.880]  there are mass arrests of anyone that has been declared to be a domestic terrorist that supports President Donald J. Trump.
[1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:53.880]  We already know from Larry Grathwall, who infiltrated the weather underground,
[1:29:53.880 --> 1:29:57.880]  that this has been decades in the making. They have every bit of plans,
[1:29:57.880 --> 1:30:00.880]  and you're hearing them right out in the open, Project Veritas.
[1:30:00.880 --> 1:30:02.880]  They said, we're going to put people in reeducation camps.
[1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:09.880]  They've literally been planning for decades for this moment in time to where we will be on the defensive,
[1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:14.880]  and of course, to this thing where these leftists who are now in power that Larry Grathwall was speaking to
[1:30:14.880 --> 1:30:19.880]  when they were college graduates and students talking about putting people in reeducation camps,
[1:30:19.880 --> 1:30:25.880]  and also those that can't be reeducated, they were planning to kill tens of millions of us.
[1:30:25.880 --> 1:30:32.880]  You have to think about that possibility and how we as a peace-loving, God-loving American populace
[1:30:32.880 --> 1:30:35.880]  defend ourselves in that eventuality.
[1:30:35.880 --> 1:30:40.880]  Fortunately, we do have our Second Amendment to defend our families,
[1:30:40.880 --> 1:30:48.880]  and I want to encourage our lawful, of course, and constitutional authority to defend our nation,
[1:30:48.880 --> 1:30:54.880]  to defend our families. But right now, you are being you, all of us, are being subjected to psychological warfare.
[1:30:54.880 --> 1:31:00.880]  Do not let your guard down and expect the exact opposite of what you've been hoping for.
[1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:03.880]  That way, you're well-prepared. And that's why I'm putting this message out,
[1:31:03.880 --> 1:31:05.880]  because I'll give you a couple of examples.
[1:31:05.880 --> 1:31:08.880]  We love law enforcement. We back to blue.
[1:31:08.880 --> 1:31:16.880]  Could you imagine that I was in Burns, Oregon, and I found out that the FBI was actually in their rental vehicles.
[1:31:16.880 --> 1:31:21.880]  They were dressed up as militia, and they went to the armory surveilling it,
[1:31:21.880 --> 1:31:26.880]  and then telling the population that the militia is looking to do really bad things in Burns, Oregon.
[1:31:26.880 --> 1:31:29.880]  That was manufactured by the Federal Bureau of Investigations.
[1:31:29.880 --> 1:31:33.880]  Now, what I'm telling you, they were caught by the local fire chief.
[1:31:33.880 --> 1:31:38.880]  He actually ran the plates of those that were surveilling the local armory,
[1:31:38.880 --> 1:31:43.880]  and he determined that those vehicles were rented by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[1:31:43.880 --> 1:31:45.880]  So we exposed that in January 2016.
[1:31:45.880 --> 1:31:52.880]  So for those of us that back to blue, we love the blue, you need to know that within the FBI, rank and file are great,
[1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:56.880]  but at the upper echelon, they're controlling, they're compartmentalizing.
[1:31:56.880 --> 1:32:00.880]  They are going to set up, and I'm telling you this right now.
[1:32:00.880 --> 1:32:04.880]  Not only am I saying that there's a potential for them to set this up, I've watched them do it,
[1:32:04.880 --> 1:32:08.880]  where hundreds of people almost died in 2014.
[1:32:08.880 --> 1:32:15.880]  One person actually did die as a result of this entrapment and this ambush of Lvoi Phenigum.
[1:32:15.880 --> 1:32:18.880]  They shot and killed them, and they also will cover it up.
[1:32:18.880 --> 1:32:24.880]  We had FBI agents firing provocative rounds in 2016, and then covering it up.
[1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:30.880]  What I want everybody to understand right now is that your most trusted people that you have around you
[1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:38.880]  are going to be the ones that you will be shocked that they're actually working for this entity.
[1:32:38.880 --> 1:32:40.880]  There's trillions of dollars at stake.
[1:32:40.880 --> 1:32:46.880]  Your security person may be paid $100,000 to set you up to gather enough information
[1:32:46.880 --> 1:32:52.880]  in order for you to make a statement on recording and essentially be used in an indictment.
[1:32:52.880 --> 1:32:54.880]  Here's my best advice to everybody.
[1:32:54.880 --> 1:32:56.880]  We're peace-loving, law-abiding citizens.
[1:32:56.880 --> 1:33:02.880]  The number one indication that you're around somebody that's about to entrap you and set you up
[1:33:02.880 --> 1:33:05.880]  is that they suggest unlawful activity or any violence.
[1:33:05.880 --> 1:33:07.880]  They stand out like a sore thumb.
[1:33:07.880 --> 1:33:11.880]  And with your permission, Alex, I want to show you something because I knew,
[1:33:11.880 --> 1:33:14.880]  and I had my attorney, by the way, on the ground, because I know what they do.
[1:33:14.880 --> 1:33:15.880]  We were in Washington, D.C.
[1:33:15.880 --> 1:33:18.880]  I know better that if they're going to bring an indictment, I can't stop it,
[1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:23.880]  but I'd like to get a third trial having one up against these goombas.
[1:33:23.880 --> 1:33:26.880]  These guys right here were Antifa.
[1:33:26.880 --> 1:33:27.880]  They were in the crowd.
[1:33:27.880 --> 1:33:30.880]  We had a couple hundred thousand people surrounding us.
[1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:31.880]  I walked right up to them.
[1:33:31.880 --> 1:33:32.880]  I confronted them.
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:34.880]  I got full facial shots.
[1:33:34.880 --> 1:33:36.880]  These Antifa people were in the crowd.
[1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:39.880]  There were 20 of them that had surrounded us.
[1:33:39.880 --> 1:33:42.880]  Everybody needs to have A, situational awareness.
[1:33:42.880 --> 1:33:45.880]  B, recognize that they will stand out like a sore thumb.
[1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:49.880]  If you go to a protest at your state capitol, you'll know who they are.
[1:33:49.880 --> 1:33:50.880]  You need to record them.
[1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:52.880]  You need to document it.
[1:33:52.880 --> 1:33:53.880]  It's crazy.
[1:33:53.880 --> 1:33:55.880]  They can be black, white, Hispanic, old, young.
[1:33:55.880 --> 1:33:56.880]  They stick out.
[1:33:56.880 --> 1:33:57.880]  They're evil.
[1:33:57.880 --> 1:33:58.880]  They stand out.
[1:33:58.880 --> 1:34:00.880]  These guys right here, you know what I did?
[1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:01.880]  I walked past them.
[1:34:01.880 --> 1:34:02.880]  I said, how do you spell MAGA?
[1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:04.880]  And they were repulsed by that.
[1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:07.880]  That reaction in and of itself told me that these guys stood out
[1:34:07.880 --> 1:34:10.880]  because we patriots that are out there were waving flags.
[1:34:10.880 --> 1:34:11.880]  We're happy.
[1:34:11.880 --> 1:34:12.880]  We're glad to be there.
[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:14.880]  These guys stood out, and they will.
[1:34:14.880 --> 1:34:15.880]  Well, that's another thing.
[1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:17.880]  You saw the patriots were all wearing bright colors.
[1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:20.880]  The main group that attacked was all wearing black with pink accents
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:22.880]  that lets them know they're an antifa.
[1:34:22.880 --> 1:34:23.880]  That's exactly right.
[1:34:23.880 --> 1:34:30.880]  Now, these provocateurs at Bundy Ranch, there were people like Jared Miller.
[1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:32.880]  He's a felon, a drug addict.
[1:34:32.880 --> 1:34:35.880]  He's running around asking where he can get an AK-47.
[1:34:35.880 --> 1:34:37.880]  They stand out like a sore thumb.
[1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:43.880]  At Malier National Wildlife Refuge, eight protesters took over the refuge.
[1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:44.880]  Nobody was there.
[1:34:44.880 --> 1:34:47.880]  No federal agents were there.
[1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:51.880]  I joke about it, and I say 15 of those people were FBI informants
[1:34:51.880 --> 1:34:53.880]  and confidential human sources.
[1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:54.880]  And they're not agents.
[1:34:54.880 --> 1:34:55.880]  They're actually...
[1:34:55.880 --> 1:34:56.880]  Oh, yeah, that's the joke.
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:34:59.880]  They say clan rallies like 80% FBI.
[1:34:59.880 --> 1:35:00.880]  They are.
[1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:01.880]  Now, why are they?
[1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:03.880]  Are they investigating?
[1:35:03.880 --> 1:35:06.880]  This is where we need reform, Alex, but we'll set that aside.
[1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:07.880]  No, they're leading the groups.
[1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:08.880]  They're leading them.
[1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:10.880]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:12.880]  They're entrapping people.
[1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:16.880]  Every single patriot hearing my voice right now, as soon as you hear somebody suggest
[1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:21.880]  violence or any unlawful activity, you need to call them out.
[1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:25.880]  Let the entire crowd know that those guys are provocateurs.
[1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:26.880]  They're gonna...
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:28.880]  Yeah, they want this fight with patriots.
[1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:30.880]  They want to outlaw being pro-Trump.
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:31.880]  And you're right.
[1:35:31.880 --> 1:35:35.880]  Biden has said we will destroy the Second Amendment and the NRA.
[1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:36.880]  This is how they...
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:41.880]  He wants to come into office with his new 9-11, but it's patriots doing stuff.
[1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:45.880]  So, it doesn't matter if you're a local police officer or a local citizen or an FBI agent
[1:35:45.880 --> 1:35:47.880]  that isn't corrupt, document what's happening.
[1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:51.880]  It was FBI agents that actually exposed Oklahoma City as an inside job along with local police.
[1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:53.880]  You know, this is a good and evil fight.
[1:35:53.880 --> 1:35:55.880]  There's good people that are in your church.
[1:35:55.880 --> 1:35:56.880]  There's bad people.
[1:35:56.880 --> 1:35:57.880]  There's good people in your school.
[1:35:57.880 --> 1:35:58.880]  There's bad people.
[1:35:58.880 --> 1:35:59.880]  There's good and bad.
[1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:01.880]  It's good and bad.
[1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:04.880]  So how was I involved with winning two...
[1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:08.880]  By the way, most attorneys can't even say that they've won two federal trials in the federal
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:09.880]  court system.
[1:36:09.880 --> 1:36:11.880]  Tell us how you did it when we come back.
[1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:13.880]  Pete Santelli is our guest.
[1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:14.880]  PeteLive.tv.
[1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:16.880]  You've got to go to break with the satellites here.
[1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:22.880]  And then we've got Ezra Levant from Canada to give us his take on all this insanity
[1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:25.880]  and just how crazy it's all getting and what he thinks we should do.
[1:36:25.880 --> 1:36:26.880]  Please don't forget our websites.
[1:36:26.880 --> 1:36:31.880]  It's newswars.com, infowars.com, and band.video.
[1:36:31.880 --> 1:36:33.880]  They've all been under massive hack attack.
[1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:40.880]  They've stayed up thanks to your support at infowarsstore.com.
[1:36:40.880 --> 1:36:48.880]  Hey Alex, how you doing man?
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:51.880]  Is this the guy that called in about living defense?
[1:36:51.880 --> 1:36:52.880]  Yes sir.
[1:36:52.880 --> 1:36:53.880]  Yes sir.
[1:36:53.880 --> 1:36:57.880]  I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment
[1:36:57.880 --> 1:36:59.880]  of living defense in from Utah.
[1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:03.880]  I said man, I've got to get on that show and give him an update.
[1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:09.880]  I said if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones show, I'm going to tell the world about
[1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:12.880]  living defense and what it did for me personally.
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:18.880]  Now look, I'm 64 years old going on 20 thanks to this infowarsstore product.
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:21.880]  And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night.
[1:37:21.880 --> 1:37:23.880]  So I'm doing what I can brother.
[1:37:23.880 --> 1:37:29.880]  So my contention is why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting
[1:37:29.880 --> 1:37:31.880]  couple bottles of living defense.
[1:37:31.880 --> 1:37:34.880]  Now you got to follow that up with the micro-ZX.
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:35.880]  I learned that.
[1:37:35.880 --> 1:37:38.880]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:39.880]  We didn't know.
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:40.880]  We didn't screen your call.
[1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:41.880]  We had no idea.
[1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:44.880]  And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about living defense.
[1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:45.880]  Living defense.
[1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:46.880]  Living defense.
[1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:50.880]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:55.880]  redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United
[1:37:55.880 --> 1:37:59.880]  Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:00.880]  a chip under your skin.
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:02.880]  It's all now completely official.
[1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:08.880]  Part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and Cloud Schwab, all officially written
[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:12.880]  about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them,
[1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:14.880]  Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, it's here.
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:20.880]  And only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject
[1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:21.880]  it all.
[1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:27.880]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse, evil, and stopping
[1:38:27.880 --> 1:38:28.880]  abortion.
[1:38:28.880 --> 1:38:30.880]  We must start valuing human life again.
[1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:37.880]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:40.880]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:47.880]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:29.880]  Thank you.

[2:48:10.080 --> 2:48:38.080]  Thank you.
[2:48:38.080 --> 2:49:06.080]  Thank you.
[2:49:06.080 --> 2:49:32.080]  Thank you.
[2:49:32.080 --> 2:50:00.080]  Thank you.

[2:54:12.080 --> 2:54:40.080]  Thank you.
[2:54:40.080 --> 2:55:08.080]  Thank you.
[2:55:08.080 --> 2:55:36.080]  Thank you.
[2:55:38.080 --> 2:56:04.080]  Thank you.
[2:56:04.080 --> 2:56:32.080]  Thank you.
[2:56:32.080 --> 2:57:00.080]  Thank you.
[2:57:00.080 --> 2:57:28.080]  Thank you.
[2:57:28.080 --> 2:57:56.080]  Thank you.
[2:57:56.080 --> 2:58:24.080]  Thank you.
[2:58:24.080 --> 2:58:52.080]  Thank you.
[2:58:52.080 --> 2:59:20.080]  Thank you.
[2:59:20.080 --> 2:59:48.080]  Thank you.
[2:59:48.080 --> 3:00:16.080]  Thank you.
[3:00:16.080 --> 3:00:44.080]  Thank you.
[3:00:44.080 --> 3:01:12.080]  Thank you.
[3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:40.080]  Thank you.
[3:01:40.080 --> 3:02:08.080]  Thank you.
[3:02:08.080 --> 3:02:36.080]  Thank you.
[3:02:36.080 --> 3:03:04.080]  Thank you.
[3:03:04.080 --> 3:03:32.080]  Thank you.
[3:03:32.080 --> 3:04:00.080]  Thank you.
[3:04:00.080 --> 3:04:28.080]  Thank you.
[3:04:28.080 --> 3:04:56.080]  Thank you.
[3:04:56.080 --> 3:05:24.080]  Thank you.
[3:05:24.080 --> 3:05:52.080]  Thank you.
[3:05:52.080 --> 3:06:20.080]  Thank you.
[3:06:20.080 --> 3:06:48.080]  Thank you.
[3:06:48.080 --> 3:07:16.080]  Thank you.
[3:07:16.080 --> 3:07:44.080]  Thank you.
[3:07:44.080 --> 3:08:10.080]  Thank you.
[3:08:10.080 --> 3:08:38.080]  Thank you.
[3:08:40.080 --> 3:08:48.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:48.080 --> 3:09:12.080]  I was on the hill by the Washington Monument last week.
[3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:20.080]  At the time, it didn't occur to me until a few moments after he was going into the crowd, but I saw one of these Antifa guys, I would swear to it.
[3:09:20.080 --> 3:09:22.080]  And I would pick him out of a lineup.
[3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:30.080]  I was up on the hill holding up a big flagpole and, you know, Gadsden and a Trump flag on it.
[3:09:30.080 --> 3:09:40.080]  And a guy went by that was exactly in and it sounds like unbelievably close to the to the mark.
[3:09:40.080 --> 3:09:48.080]  He was wearing the exact uniform that had supposedly been put out on Antifa websites the week before for infiltrators.
[3:09:48.080 --> 3:09:56.080]  He was fairly short, maybe five, eight stocky, you know, well built guy, maybe late 20s, early 30s.
[3:09:56.080 --> 3:10:00.080]  And he was wearing the red MAGA hat backwards.
[3:10:00.080 --> 3:10:10.080]  He was he was wearing camo, like fatigue pants cut off about at the knee like raggedy not hemmed or anything.
[3:10:10.080 --> 3:10:12.080]  That's all cool right then.
[3:10:12.080 --> 3:10:18.080]  But he was wearing black sneakers and black socks, like over the calf like grandpa socks.
[3:10:18.080 --> 3:10:20.080]  Now the last time I've seen that was in California.
[3:10:20.080 --> 3:10:22.080]  It was sort of a gang thing.
[3:10:22.080 --> 3:10:30.080]  Guys would wear like basketball shorts with the socks all the way up practically to the matching the shorts.
[3:10:30.080 --> 3:10:32.080]  Not something I've seen a conservative wear ever.
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:34.080]  Honestly, maybe it's just because it was cold.
[3:10:34.080 --> 3:10:48.080]  But the guy was was also another identifier was he was he had a Trump flag like a five foot red Trump flag tied to the back corner of his backpack so that a corner of it was dragging on the ground.
[3:10:48.080 --> 3:10:50.080]  Like he just didn't notice.
[3:10:50.080 --> 3:10:58.080]  I don't think you know in retrospect I don't think any Trump supporters walking around dragging the Trump flag on the ground.
[3:10:58.080 --> 3:11:02.080]  And as he passed me I said man you're hardcore wearing shorts.
[3:11:02.080 --> 3:11:10.080]  And he turned quickly suspiciously and out and I noticed the little pink tape marks on his backpack.
[3:11:10.080 --> 3:11:16.080]  Like if you took a piece of pink tape or ribbon and tied it in a few places on you.
[3:11:16.080 --> 3:11:19.080]  And that is absolutely an identifier for that day.
[3:11:19.080 --> 3:11:35.080]  It's similar to the Secret Service wearing a lapel button or lapel pin that only they know about that they can change that morning so that nobody can just like you know throw one of these in their ear put on a suit and act like Secret Service because they won't have the right identifier.
[3:11:35.080 --> 3:11:38.080]  Well the identifier on that day was the pink tape.
[3:11:38.080 --> 3:11:53.080]  And I saw it a few a few places around D.C. and in fact when I got off the metro I took the metro the yellow line from L'Enfant Plaza when we got off the metro in Alexandria.
[3:11:53.080 --> 3:12:03.080]  Actually when we were getting excuse me when we were getting on the metro you have to wait for people to get off the guy a guy that got off which he would have just come from the capital area.
[3:12:03.080 --> 3:12:11.080]  If he had just gotten on and gotten off there he slammed into me I was wearing a Trump hat he slammed into me and my seal buddy we both slammed him right back.
[3:12:11.080 --> 3:12:24.080]  And this dude who was wearing like a black overcoat and a backpack like a black like trench coat and a wool and a black cap he had pink tape on his backpack.
[3:12:24.080 --> 3:12:35.080]  Okay so he saw waiting at the Plaza these you know Trump Trump people and he decided to give us the elbow getting off you know here's this old guy with gray hair.
[3:12:35.080 --> 3:12:44.080]  So he almost got slammed into the tracks and then he passed my friend who wasn't wearing a Trump hat who gave him a body check also.
[3:12:44.080 --> 3:12:54.080]  So that was two cases where we saw ourselves and we weren't even like at the Capitol where we saw the pink identifiers this is trade craft okay folks.
[3:12:54.080 --> 3:12:57.080]  This is just so you can look for it in the future.
[3:12:57.080 --> 3:12:58.080]  All right.
[3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:08.080]  Now these these two videos which I cannot recommend highly enough the Michael Yon interview with Joshua Phillips and the analysis of Ashley Babbitt video.
[3:13:08.080 --> 3:13:21.080]  Please share them it's not enough to tell your normie neighbor or family member hey I saw a video it's in and out you've got a you've got a copy and paste the URLs.
[3:13:21.080 --> 3:13:23.080]  You have to share them.
[3:13:23.080 --> 3:13:25.080]  It's not enough anymore.
[3:13:25.080 --> 3:13:28.080]  If you're still on Facebook I quit on December 31.
[3:13:28.080 --> 3:13:32.080]  If you hit the share button on Facebook and you're a conservative.
[3:13:32.080 --> 3:13:34.080]  That's just the memory hole.
[3:13:34.080 --> 3:13:39.080]  All right that's just the throttle shadow band button that's the sucker button.
[3:13:39.080 --> 3:13:41.080]  It doesn't do anything.
[3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:50.080]  If you want to share anything you have to copy URLs and paste them somewhere where for sure your friends and contacts will see it.
[3:13:50.080 --> 3:13:57.080]  I personally recommend that everybody make a hard copy like your own blog role.
[3:13:57.080 --> 3:14:05.080]  Don't wait for for the good stories to come to you for by being shared because if you're on social media they won't be.
[3:14:05.080 --> 3:14:10.080]  Now now there is one outpost of social media left and that's gab.
[3:14:10.080 --> 3:14:17.080]  And this is what like you know Levant and Santilli we're talking about we have to build our own up from the ground.
[3:14:17.080 --> 3:14:20.080]  I saw a Barnes video.
[3:14:20.080 --> 3:14:25.080]  John super lawyer John Barnes who's worked for Info Wars.
[3:14:25.080 --> 3:14:39.080]  He considers Info Wars to be like the the the classic epitome of how to do it when Info Wars was thrown off of YouTube and they tried to you know do a parlor on Info Wars.
[3:14:39.080 --> 3:14:50.080]  Alex built the entire system from the ground up including banned that video with so that it can't be just taken out by our enemies and this is a model going forward.
[3:14:50.080 --> 3:14:55.080]  You know gab did a similar thing and and gab has its own servers.
[3:14:55.080 --> 3:15:04.080]  I mean it was so naive for parlor to trust an Amazon you know complete enemy territory to host their servers.
[3:15:04.080 --> 3:15:13.080]  You just can't do that and we need to expect over the next over the coming weeks we need to expect more and more suppression.
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:16.080]  Trump is still the nominal president.
[3:15:16.080 --> 3:15:21.080]  Biden's not even in the White House and they're already shutting down our communications channels.
[3:15:21.080 --> 3:15:23.080]  It's only going to get worse.
[3:15:23.080 --> 3:15:34.080]  I strongly suggest that either you know on a list on your phone if you can trust your phone is going to still work or on a you know on an actual on an actual notepad.
[3:15:34.080 --> 3:15:41.080]  But write down the blogs that you want to see every day and physically go visit them.
[3:15:41.080 --> 3:15:46.080]  Now American thinker today took down comments.
[3:15:46.080 --> 3:15:52.080]  The Federalist blog a couple months ago took down comments because this is the way that they attacked parlor.
[3:15:52.080 --> 3:15:56.080]  They said oh you're not monitoring your you're not monitoring your comments enough.
[3:15:56.080 --> 3:15:58.080]  So they just eliminated it.
[3:15:58.080 --> 3:16:05.080]  So anywhere on the Internet that you have a blog that still allows comments especially look for them.
[3:16:05.080 --> 3:16:13.080]  That's a way to communicate from platform to platform to platform their town hall dot com still allows comments.
[3:16:13.080 --> 3:16:15.080]  And so does front page Mag.
[3:16:15.080 --> 3:16:20.080]  Some will allow comments with embedded URLs for hyperlinks.
[3:16:20.080 --> 3:16:28.080]  What I'm talking about is as patriots as they try to play whack-a-mole and cut off our communications channels.
[3:16:28.080 --> 3:16:43.080]  We need to do whatever we can to not be totally isolated so that we can still find the the like little air holes like a like a seal or a seal under the ice has to like know where the air holes are right.
[3:16:43.080 --> 3:16:49.080]  You can't be stuck too far from an air hole or you drown even a seal will drown.
[3:16:49.080 --> 3:16:51.080]  I'm talking about a marine mammal.
[3:16:51.080 --> 3:17:01.080]  But we need to find our own communication air holes while it lasts. Info wars and band video is around the top of the entire list.
[3:17:01.080 --> 3:17:06.080]  But certainly get on gab and please excuse gab for the delays.
[3:17:06.080 --> 3:17:11.080]  They've had something like you know a thousand percent sign up since parlor went dark.
[3:17:11.080 --> 3:17:20.080]  So just to keep gab on the air is an amazing feat considering you know that they've they've just gotten millions of people signing up a day.
[3:17:20.080 --> 3:17:25.080]  You have to give them credit. And if you can send them some money because it isn't free.
[3:17:25.080 --> 3:17:37.080]  This is now a matter of patriotism. It's not a matter of people trying to make money on it. It's patriotism.
[3:17:37.080 --> 3:17:59.080]  Anybody listening to my voice simply search into the term Davos group technocracy or technocrats. You will get Clow Schwab and Sean Podge Younger and all the new order globalist like he's being saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments that they want businessmen technocrats over.
[3:17:59.080 --> 3:18:09.080]  And that's who Clow Schwab is. You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor. You might want to find out who this super villain is.
[3:18:09.080 --> 3:18:15.080]  He believes because he's hidden playing you and you're not speaking out against it that he has a right to do it to you.
[3:18:15.080 --> 3:18:19.080]  You might want to find out who he works for. He works directly for Prince Charles.
[3:18:19.080 --> 3:18:26.080]  He developed since the 80s the plan for global sustainability. That means worldwide neo feudalism in his own words.
[3:18:26.080 --> 3:18:34.080]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you for you take those shots. You might just want to find out who this villain is.
[3:18:34.080 --> 3:18:36.080]  All right.
[3:18:36.080 --> 3:18:45.080]  Now is the time to get prepared. You got to pray to God and get your soul ready. You got to be prepared to physically defend yourself and your family.
[3:18:45.080 --> 3:19:01.080]  You've also got to get things that allow you and your family to not be dependent on the system. That's why they want to bankrupt the economy. It's why they want to destroy the infrastructure of this nation because they want all of us on our knees so they can dictate our surrender to them.
[3:19:01.080 --> 3:19:16.080]  Info wars is a critical organization in the fight against the globalist. And if you gave us straight up donations that would be great because our work is important. We appreciate it. But we bring you great products so that you get high quality products at the same time as supporting the
[3:19:16.080 --> 3:19:32.080]  Info War 361. Well we've only got a few days left to get 2020 prices before the prices go up on high quality storeable food with huge discounts as big as $850 discount on a year supply of food at infowarstore.com.
[3:19:32.080 --> 3:19:47.080]  So take advantage of these sales right now at infowarstore.com while you still can.
[3:19:47.080 --> 3:20:07.080]  The resistance.video. The resistance.video. Info wars.com. News wars.com. Band.video. And hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned. That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[3:20:07.080 --> 3:20:22.080]  The store ofs and bill gates and the globalists are on our tail. But the new website is the resistance.video. The resistance.video. They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[3:20:22.080 --> 3:20:39.080]  So the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is that the resistance.video. Share the link. The resistance.video. The resistance.video.
[3:20:39.080 --> 3:20:56.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:56.080 --> 3:21:13.080]  Okay folks. I think that it's I think that it's amazing watching how Alex has been a step ahead. Parlers supposedly has is almost was almost a billion dollar company. It's hard to hard to imagine.
[3:21:13.080 --> 3:21:28.080]  Huge backing smart people patriots like Dan Bongino behind it. And they just got smashed flat. They may never come back they say now. So when you're watching info wars.
[3:21:28.080 --> 3:21:38.080]  You're watching one of the last freedom channels out there. And it's not free building your own infrastructure from the dirt up. It is not free.
[3:21:38.080 --> 3:21:53.080]  And that's the point of the info wars store. There's no corporate sponsorship here obviously. We're the enemy of the globalists. So we have to bootstrap every inch of this every single inch.
[3:21:53.080 --> 3:22:11.080]  Or there's no channel. So if you if you just want to see it all go dark just let it go and it won't be here and it might not be here no matter what but it at least if it if it's shut down it's it shouldn't be because nobody would fund it.
[3:22:11.080 --> 3:22:22.080]  If it's shut down it's going to be because you know the the communists the globalists they just can't tolerate it and they find some legal some legal excuse to do it.
[3:22:22.080 --> 3:22:33.080]  You know that the next the next week is going to be maybe more interesting than the last week. We've seen the barricades going up around Washington.
[3:22:33.080 --> 3:22:53.080]  Not not before the you know not before Trump's speech only after. And one of the proofs that we can show that is a proof that last week was a setup is that it was at the Capitol was only ringed with those lame bicycle rack fences.
[3:22:53.080 --> 3:23:08.080]  And the there weren't riot police even staged or ready. This is in a way like a sucker setup the way that Ashley Babbit was led to her death by these antifa scum.
[3:23:08.080 --> 3:23:19.080]  The fact that they only had the bicycle rack or rack fences around the Capitol. That is the proof. It's like the what's the evidence of fraud in the election the biggest one.
[3:23:19.080 --> 3:23:30.080]  They kicked out all the observers. If it's an honest election you don't kick out all of the Republican observers or keep them at binocular range where they can't see a thing.
[3:23:30.080 --> 3:23:46.080]  The proof that the Capitol Hill was a setup was that there was no security. You've got at least 100000 to up to a half million people that are a mile away and you don't have security it's because you want an incident.
[3:23:46.080 --> 3:23:58.080]  Now there's talk about perhaps that one that on the day before the the Capitol incident. There were groups that were led by by congressmen on special tours.
[3:23:58.080 --> 3:24:07.080]  And if if if that turns out to be so it's going to be highly problematic, especially if there are people like.
[3:24:07.080 --> 3:24:18.080]  Like John Earl Sullivan taking a tour because Ashley Babbit where she was led to those doors. She would have never found that in a million years.
[3:24:18.080 --> 3:24:29.080]  Those people got there in the front. They were like pathfinders. They weren't just milling along with a herd. They didn't follow people into the Capitol.
[3:24:29.080 --> 3:24:39.080]  They went in there like a shot. That's the only way that you get a group of say a dozen people not counting the law enforcement that was there on the outside.
[3:24:39.080 --> 3:24:50.080]  You've got a dozen people at least half of them. I'm considering Antifa and Ashley Babbit who they're psyching up to go through the window and get shot.
[3:24:50.080 --> 3:24:58.080]  It's the same thing on the outside where they had no fencing. This is to me the evidence that it was a setup.
[3:24:58.080 --> 3:25:08.080]  Now they're turning DC into martial law like escape from New York style dystopia with National Guard 12,000 National Guard.
[3:25:08.080 --> 3:25:15.080]  I've heard maybe more more than we have in Afghanistan and Iraq to give it that look like oh my goodness.
[3:25:15.080 --> 3:25:21.080]  Those Trump supporters, they could do anything. They're going to attack. Look, we're being set up.
[3:25:21.080 --> 3:25:30.080]  Santilli was exactly right. They're talking about IEDs and they're talking about possibly mass shooters.
[3:25:30.080 --> 3:25:40.080]  Why would they want to do a mass shooter? Because it's one thing it's easy. The trigger man usually gets away because he's not where it happens.
[3:25:40.080 --> 3:25:47.080]  Somebody with an IED has to actually place it and in Washington every foot is going to be under camera surveillance.
[3:25:47.080 --> 3:25:54.080]  But a shooter can do a lot of damage and then what's going to happen? There goes the Second Amendment.
[3:25:54.080 --> 3:26:09.080]  They're psyching up the American people just like Santilli said. They're doing the psychological preparation for normal Americans that these evil right wingers are just too dangerous to let them have guns anymore.
[3:26:09.080 --> 3:26:15.080]  This was the first book that I wrote, Enemies, Foreign and Domestic.
[3:26:15.080 --> 3:26:21.080]  It starts with a false flag shooting at a stadium for the purpose of getting rid of the Second Amendment.
[3:26:21.080 --> 3:26:27.080]  Now, why do I talk about false flags? Why do we talk about false flags so much?
[3:26:27.080 --> 3:26:32.080]  It's because it's the antidote. It's the medicine to prevent them from doing it.
[3:26:32.080 --> 3:26:42.080]  If it's a total surprise, people will believe it. If we're already talking about something being set up as a false flag, the narrative won't work as well.
[3:26:42.080 --> 3:26:52.080]  Ezra Levant, who I consider a patriot and a genius Canadian, but a patriot for freedom, he was talking about how they cement the narrative.
[3:26:52.080 --> 3:27:02.080]  They've got to get their narrative out and by the time that the counter narrative comes out, in people's minds, the facts are established.
[3:27:02.080 --> 3:27:11.080]  Biden won fair and square. Trump supporters left the Trump speech and righted and attacked the Capitol. These are big lies.
[3:27:11.080 --> 3:27:18.080]  And if they do a mass shooting or have an IED go off, they're going to try to establish the false narrative right away.
[3:27:18.080 --> 3:27:24.080]  They'll probably have a Patsy set up, in fact, or just a fake Patsy.
[3:27:24.080 --> 3:27:34.080]  But they're going to at all costs blame conservatives for whatever happens before, during, or after the inauguration.
[3:27:34.080 --> 3:27:38.080]  Please don't be a sucker. Don't go to any of these events.
[3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:55.080]  The January 17th deal, which is supposed to happen at all the state capitals, if you can't pick that out as either Antifa and or FBI setting up a disinformation program, a honey trap, a buffalo jump.
[3:27:55.080 --> 3:28:03.080]  If you can't spot that from a mile away, please learn about these things. This is a setup.
[3:28:03.080 --> 3:28:17.080]  If you're going to confront tyranny, don't do it anymore at the Capitol, where the government, the rising tyranny has every advantage imaginable.
[3:28:17.080 --> 3:28:28.080]  Don't be a buffalo and run off a cliff just because somebody waves a flag or sets a fire near a cliff. Be smarter than that.
[3:28:28.080 --> 3:28:35.080]  If we're going to confront tyranny, we're going to have to do it on our own terms, on our own ground, and in our own way.
[3:28:35.080 --> 3:28:42.080]  And at least for the next couple of weeks, it's going to be primarily about keeping information channels open.
[3:28:42.080 --> 3:28:47.080]  That's why I spoke about writing down the blogs that allow you to comment.
[3:28:47.080 --> 3:28:54.080]  As they nail shut our ability to communicate, the remaining outposts will be more and more important.
[3:28:54.080 --> 3:29:00.080]  Band.video now, resistance.video or every URL that follows.
[3:29:00.080 --> 3:29:06.080]  Register. It's okay, people say, oh, I'm afraid of registering. I have to give some information or this.
[3:29:06.080 --> 3:29:14.080]  Look, you have to have a way to communicate. If you're afraid of getting on the radar, it's too late. You already are.
[3:29:14.080 --> 3:29:21.080]  Just by your credit card purchases and your website browsing history, they've already got you bracketed.
[3:29:21.080 --> 3:29:30.080]  They've already got your coefficient. Your social credit score is nailed to your face.
[3:29:30.080 --> 3:29:37.080]  When you go in public, if it's downtown and you're on the facial recognition, they've got your social credit score.
[3:29:37.080 --> 3:29:42.080]  So please don't worry about one more risk of signing up to comment.
[3:29:42.080 --> 3:29:45.080]  The more people commenting, the better it is for everybody.
[3:29:45.080 --> 3:29:53.080]  The more people are cowed and intimidated into silence, the closer we come to becoming the Soviet Union.
[3:29:53.080 --> 3:30:02.080]  That's the goal of all of this, is to just beat us down into silence, where we're afraid to indicate what our politics are.
[3:30:02.080 --> 3:30:09.080]  That's when they win. They win when we are cowed into submission and silence.
[3:30:09.080 --> 3:30:16.080]  That's when it's over. So you have to continue to resist, but don't be stupid about it.
[3:30:16.080 --> 3:30:44.080]  If somebody is going to wear their empty plate carrier and carry a club to a capital, they're idiots and they're hurting our side.
[3:30:44.080 --> 3:30:47.080]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[3:30:47.080 --> 3:30:53.080]  Where did it come from?
[3:30:53.080 --> 3:31:15.080]  We can't survive without pure, clean drinking water. So make sure that it's always available to you with the Alexa Pure water filtration system.
[3:31:15.080 --> 3:31:29.080]  Yummy in my tummy. Bring the purest, most refreshing water to your home by ordering the Alexa Pure water filtration system today from InfowarsStore.com.
[3:31:29.080 --> 3:31:35.080]  InfowarsStore.com. Other systems just don't compare.
[3:31:35.080 --> 3:31:49.080]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare. The United Nations, the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big farmer are all pushing the COVID's most deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold.
[3:31:49.080 --> 3:31:55.080]  But if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it. That's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing homes.
[3:31:55.080 --> 3:32:07.080]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones, are basically bioweapons that are super deadly.
[3:32:07.080 --> 3:32:16.080]  And now they're having to resuscitate people that die basically when they take it, just like newborn babies, they give vaccines. They have to resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just let them die.
[3:32:16.080 --> 3:32:25.080]  And that's on the record. It does that. Guillain-Marais, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases, but they tell you, safe and effective. No one's getting hurt. It's a conspiracy theory.
[3:32:25.080 --> 3:32:36.080]  And then all the fine princesses can kill you absolutely deadly. So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe. They do it.
[3:32:36.080 --> 3:32:50.080]  Now is the time to get prepared. You got to pray to God and get your soul ready. You got to be prepared to physically defend yourself and your family. And you've also got to get things that allow you and your family to not be dependent on the system.
[3:32:50.080 --> 3:33:00.080]  That's why they want to bankrupt the economy. It's why they want to destroy the infrastructure of this nation because they want all of us on our knees so they can dictate our surrender to them.
[3:33:00.080 --> 3:33:10.080]  InfoWars is a critical organization in the fight against the globalist. And if you gave us straight up donations, that would be great because our work is important. We appreciate it.

[3:34:58.080 --> 3:35:05.080]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[3:35:28.080 --> 3:35:44.080]  This is my final segment this hour and the times being what they are. I never know if I'll be back because the channel might go dark or who knows what can happen.
[3:35:44.080 --> 3:36:01.080]  Now, you know, if you're a faithful watcher of InfoWars and the videos on replay and also, you know, Paul Joseph Watson Summit News and InfoWars website, you're pretty far ahead of the curve.
[3:36:01.080 --> 3:36:14.080]  And we've been talking about a concept for months called accelerationism. And I finally heard it mentioned, you know, not on mainstream media, heaven forbid, that'll be, you know, weeks or months or never.
[3:36:14.080 --> 3:36:24.080]  But another one of the top political shows, maybe the top political show on the internet is Steve Bannon's War Room Pandemic.
[3:36:24.080 --> 3:36:35.080]  This morning, they brought up the concept of accelerationism and they defined it roughly as, you know, neither from the right nor from the left.
[3:36:35.080 --> 3:36:48.080]  But those people who feel that there is no norm, there's no way back to normal through the process that we have to trigger a civil war, a hot kinetic civil war.
[3:36:48.080 --> 3:37:01.080]  And those on the right feel that out of this hot kinetic civil war, we'll get some kind of a general Pinochet or Franco and we'll win from the right.
[3:37:01.080 --> 3:37:15.080]  The left feels that by accelerating to a civil war, they're going to create the conditions where they can impose full out communist tyranny, gulags, purges, everything.
[3:37:15.080 --> 3:37:25.080]  So in a sense, the left extreme radical accelerationists and the right extreme radical accelerationists are allied in this cause.
[3:37:25.080 --> 3:37:36.080]  Then you can also just throw in evil anarchists that aren't motivated as much by a political outcome as just wanting to see everything burn.
[3:37:36.080 --> 3:37:43.080]  That's just the pure evil anarchists and there's some of that in the right and the left accelerationists.
[3:37:43.080 --> 3:37:59.080]  Anybody who wants to see the United States slip into a civil war, which I described now as the worst elements of Weimar Germany, the economy, the crazy politics,
[3:37:59.080 --> 3:38:14.080]  times former Yugoslavia breaking up into a civil war, multiple civil wars, times Rwanda for the racial aspect of any civil war as it would happen in the United States.
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:23.080]  Anybody who thinks it will be great to live through Weimar Germany times Yugoslavia times Rwanda is insane.
[3:38:23.080 --> 3:38:28.080]  So we need to do everything that we possibly can to avoid it.
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:33.080]  Now that said, I'm not willing to become a slave under communism.
[3:38:33.080 --> 3:38:41.080]  Before that happens, before an iron curtain falls over America, myself and millions of others, we will fight.
[3:38:41.080 --> 3:38:49.080]  But nobody should be gleeful about attempting to trigger a civil war, intentionally triggering it.
[3:38:49.080 --> 3:39:02.080]  I forget if it was an hour ago or in the Ezral event, they showed the Larry Grathwall tape.
[3:39:02.080 --> 3:39:15.080]  He was undercover with the Weather Underground when they said they were willing to see 25 million Americans put in death camps just basically disappeared
[3:39:15.080 --> 3:39:19.080]  if that's what it took to impose their beautiful communist utopia.
[3:39:19.080 --> 3:39:23.080]  And have no doubt, the number is higher now.
[3:39:23.080 --> 3:39:25.080]  They're not joking.
[3:39:25.080 --> 3:39:33.080]  The generation of Bill Ayers, who was one of the people at that Weatherman convention.
[3:39:33.080 --> 3:39:42.080]  He is a peer of Bob Avakian who runs Revcom.us which is upstream from Antifa and BLM.
[3:39:42.080 --> 3:39:55.080]  They stay on the legal and theoretical side so that they can have a website and they can avoid FBI penetration and arrest because they're just theoretical communists.
[3:39:55.080 --> 3:40:09.080]  But they are upstream, believe me, they're upstream from Antifa and BLM and small offshoots like John Earl Sullivan's Insurgents USA.
[3:40:09.080 --> 3:40:11.080]  They're the theoreticians.
[3:40:11.080 --> 3:40:14.080]  They're now in their late 70s and early 80s.
[3:40:14.080 --> 3:40:17.080]  They're atheist communists.
[3:40:17.080 --> 3:40:31.080]  They believe when they breathe their last on this earth, their worm food, that the only eternal reward for them will be to see communism imposed on America.
[3:40:31.080 --> 3:40:34.080]  And if America falls, the world falls.
[3:40:34.080 --> 3:40:36.080]  We are the last citadel.
[3:40:36.080 --> 3:40:40.080]  So these communist atheists are going for broke.
[3:40:40.080 --> 3:40:46.080]  They don't want to feel that their 75 or 80 years on this planet were in vain.
[3:40:46.080 --> 3:40:51.080]  They want to see the hammer and sickle over the United States.
[3:40:51.080 --> 3:40:59.080]  Now it may be a while or it may be a red, white and blue flag with a white hammer and sickle where the stars are now.
[3:40:59.080 --> 3:41:01.080]  But that is their vision.
[3:41:01.080 --> 3:41:03.080]  Make no mistake about it.
[3:41:03.080 --> 3:41:14.080]  Why so many of the Democrats are completely happy to literally sleep with the Chinese communists, take money from them, take sex from them, sell out their country.
[3:41:14.080 --> 3:41:18.080]  Because in their heart, they are communists.
[3:41:18.080 --> 3:41:26.080]  Whether they call themselves Democrats, Democratic socialists, socialists or communists, we know where they're coming from.
[3:41:26.080 --> 3:41:29.080]  And we know where they want to take this country.
[3:41:29.080 --> 3:41:41.080]  But nobody should be gleeful about the prospect of stumbling into a hot civil war, especially not being buffalo jumped into being the villains at the outset of it.
[3:41:41.080 --> 3:41:45.080]  If it's going to happen, let it come from the left.
[3:41:45.080 --> 3:41:48.080]  Let them continue to repress us and shut us down.
[3:41:48.080 --> 3:41:53.080]  Don't be stupid and offer them an excuse on a silver platter.
[3:41:53.080 --> 3:41:59.080]  If there's going to be some atrocity, let it clearly come from the left.
[3:41:59.080 --> 3:42:02.080]  Don't be suckered into anything.
[3:42:02.080 --> 3:42:04.080]  Let's keep the moral high ground.
[3:42:04.080 --> 3:42:07.080]  That's an important concept.
[3:42:07.080 --> 3:42:11.080]  The war that we're in now is called fourth generation warfare.
[3:42:11.080 --> 3:42:14.080]  It's not tanks and missiles anymore.
[3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:20.080]  It's TV networks and websites and YouTube channels and alternative video channels.
[3:42:20.080 --> 3:42:23.080]  That's the new order of battle.
[3:42:23.080 --> 3:42:33.080]  And keeping, as far as the narrative, the public narrative goes, keeping the moral high ground, so to speak, is a super critical element.
[3:42:33.080 --> 3:42:43.080]  We lost the moral high ground last week because we were suckered and tricked into a classic honey trap buffalo jump.
[3:42:43.080 --> 3:42:53.080]  And I hope that the FBI gets to the bottom of what happened in the capital, especially the Ashley Babbitt situation with the broken windows.
[3:42:53.080 --> 3:43:02.080]  If there's no investigation of that by the FBI, well, let's face it, they're not an objective outfit anymore.
[3:43:02.080 --> 3:43:05.080]  They're just the stasi for the deep state.
[3:43:05.080 --> 3:43:13.080]  Those bricks that were left off at all the cities over the summer of riots have the FBI cracked that tough case yet?
[3:43:13.080 --> 3:43:21.080]  I mean, people order pallets of bricks and have them dropped off on the routes of marches that were never announced.
[3:43:21.080 --> 3:43:25.080]  How does that happen? And the FBI can't figure it out?
[3:43:25.080 --> 3:43:30.080]  Well, anyway, I may not be back who knows what happens in a week.
[3:43:30.080 --> 3:43:38.080]  But I say we stick with our narrative, never surrender, stick with Trump one.
[3:43:38.080 --> 3:43:41.080]  Don't give them any of the moral high ground.
[3:43:41.080 --> 3:43:46.080]  And I thought of another saying today that might fit well on a bumper sticker.
[3:43:46.080 --> 3:43:50.080]  You know, they say elections have consequences. Obama said that.
[3:43:50.080 --> 3:43:53.080]  I say stolen elections have consequences.
[3:43:53.080 --> 3:44:02.080]  And after January 20th, if and when Biden is installed, I'm taking the American flag down from outside of my house.
[3:44:02.080 --> 3:44:09.080]  I bought a big bumper sticker magnet, a big American flag magnet.
[3:44:09.080 --> 3:44:12.080]  I'm going to put it on the back of my car upside down.
[3:44:12.080 --> 3:44:21.080]  I think that we're, you know, we're we're just if we just passively go into this stolen government saying, well, what can we do?
[3:44:21.080 --> 3:44:26.080]  We're I'm still going to salute the flag and pretend everything's great. No, I'm not.
[3:44:26.080 --> 3:44:36.080]  Everything's not great and we can never quit and never do what they want us to do, which is is say like they were trying to get Jim Jordan to say yesterday.
[3:44:36.080 --> 3:44:40.080]  Just say it. It was a fair election. We'll call off the dogs if you admit it.
[3:44:40.080 --> 3:44:44.080]  There was no fraud. Say it. Say it. No, we're never going to say it.
[3:44:44.080 --> 3:44:48.080]  It was stolen and I don't care how they repeat the big lie.
[3:44:48.080 --> 3:44:52.080]  We thought with our own eyes, we're never going to just surrender.
[3:44:52.080 --> 3:44:57.080]  We're going to go into this tyranny as resistors and as dissidents.
[3:44:57.080 --> 3:45:00.080]  So don't quit. Keep up the fight.
[3:45:00.080 --> 3:45:03.080]  And if I see you next week, that'll be great.
[3:45:03.080 --> 3:45:11.080]  And if I don't, as I say now, may we meet in the forest but never in the gulag.
[3:45:11.080 --> 3:45:23.080]  And if we meet in the forest, it'll be with guns in our hands.
