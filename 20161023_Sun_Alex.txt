[00:00.000 --> 00:26.400]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:26.400 --> 00:36.960]  On Sunday, October 23, 2016, we're two weeks out from this historic election and as a man,
[00:36.960 --> 00:44.040]  as someone who loves justice, as someone who is addicted to freedom, I quite frankly have
[00:44.040 --> 00:52.640]  trouble dealing with the incredible energies that we see unfolding around us in this dimension.
[00:52.640 --> 00:59.240]  Donald Trump is giving speeches that are so Americana, that are so based in human liberty
[00:59.240 --> 01:06.640]  that they bring tears to your eyes and none of it is being shown on the national news.
[01:06.640 --> 01:11.160]  We come back from break in the words of Matt, one of our producers, that brought tears to
[01:11.160 --> 01:13.960]  his eyes.
[01:13.960 --> 01:18.800]  The Trump effect, Trump versus the establishment, we're going to play this little six minute
[01:18.800 --> 01:24.960]  video at least twice tonight, with the speeches he's giving across this country, from Gettysburg
[01:24.960 --> 01:28.080]  to you name it.
[01:28.080 --> 01:35.040]  And we see what the entire global power structure is doing to shut down Trump, it is unprecedented.
[01:35.040 --> 01:41.120]  It really is a final chance before the abyss, because globalism is an admitted system that
[01:41.120 --> 01:48.760]  is anti-human, anti-freedom, anti-prosperity, and we see all these powerful interests turning
[01:48.760 --> 01:53.200]  us against ourselves, all of them dumbing us down, all of them admitting their plan
[01:53.200 --> 01:59.240]  is total control, and pushing this narrative that the age of humanity is over, the free
[01:59.240 --> 02:06.080]  will doesn't exist, truly, the power structure that has hijacked our country and the world
[02:06.080 --> 02:13.000]  is satanic, and truly, regardless of who Donald Trump the man is, he is a bellwether, an
[02:13.000 --> 02:19.200]  archetype, a figurehead of our age, and of choice.
[02:19.200 --> 02:22.560]  We have his full speech in Gettysburg, the last 10 minutes, like 30 minutes long, is
[02:22.560 --> 02:27.480]  extremely powerful, I'm going to air that in this first hour as well.
[02:27.480 --> 02:33.760]  I got up this morning to show my ignorance, and I knew they were talking about the merger,
[02:33.760 --> 02:41.760]  but they announced it this morning, AT&T wants to merge with Time Warner, as if they don't
[02:41.760 --> 02:48.520]  already have a monopoly, they want to do that, this is just emblematic of the age we live
[02:48.520 --> 02:51.520]  in.
[02:51.520 --> 02:58.720]  And we have the 15th data dump of the Podesta emails in the last 20 days or so, just confirming
[02:58.720 --> 03:06.360]  that Hillary knew they'd be blamed for working for Putin, so she blamed Trump for working
[03:06.360 --> 03:11.120]  with Putin, with no evidence, when her and Podesta have gotten massive amounts of money
[03:11.120 --> 03:12.120]  from them.
[03:12.120 --> 03:16.800]  And again, I told you, I never lionized Russia, Russia is looking out for its interest, but
[03:16.800 --> 03:20.800]  to blame Trump for being a Russian agent when Hillary is sold out of the communist Chinese,
[03:20.800 --> 03:28.400]  the Saudi Arabians, the EU, the Russians, I mean, you name it, she sold out to him,
[03:28.400 --> 03:32.800]  the woman didn't just sell the White House furniture, or the White House plates, or
[03:32.800 --> 03:39.440]  Cutlery, or Silverware, or paintings, she stole the State Departments, I mean, this
[03:39.440 --> 03:45.920]  is a true criminal, this is who the social engineers would visit upon us, who would engage
[03:45.920 --> 03:54.120]  in any crime you could ever imagine, an empty, soulless vessel of tyranny.
[03:54.120 --> 03:59.960]  We've got the mainstream media pushing massive inflation this next year, global financial
[03:59.960 --> 04:04.600]  meltdowns, we knew that was coming, we've got the Soros group accused of violating Arizona
[04:04.600 --> 04:10.840]  election law, we've got the UN quote, goes all in for unlimited quote migration, that
[04:10.840 --> 04:16.560]  means open borders, it's all coming up today.
[04:16.560 --> 04:20.800]  There's a big report up on InfoWars.com, we may not have time to actually air, but it's
[04:20.800 --> 04:28.360]  on the site, it's 18 minutes long, and it's unprecedented proof of Hillary and the Democrats
[04:28.360 --> 04:30.840]  already stealing the election.
[04:30.840 --> 04:36.400]  Plus, Project Veritas on Friday called us all panicked, that the feds were after them
[04:36.400 --> 04:39.800]  all the rest, they kind of backed off that now, but what we've been talking to them,
[04:39.800 --> 04:44.280]  they may want to come on and make a statement, we'll see what happens on that front, but
[04:44.280 --> 04:48.720]  these are very, very important times we all live in right now.
[04:48.720 --> 04:54.680]  This is a crossroads in the future of humanity, and everybody at a gut and instinctual level,
[04:54.680 --> 04:57.960]  a spiritual level, intellectual level knows that.
[04:57.960 --> 05:03.000]  A staunch anti-Federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution fearing it would
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.920]  become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created
[05:06.920 --> 05:10.160]  it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[05:10.160 --> 05:13.120]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[05:13.120 --> 05:17.440]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you were to become
[05:17.440 --> 05:21.680]  a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[05:21.680 --> 05:24.600]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[05:24.600 --> 05:29.040]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure
[05:29.040 --> 05:32.680]  when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[05:32.680 --> 05:37.120]  Today, everything the government does at every level is concealed from us.
[05:37.120 --> 05:40.840]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives
[05:40.840 --> 05:41.840]  are allowed to see.
[05:41.840 --> 05:45.760]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its
[05:45.760 --> 05:48.480]  youth, the language of America was different.
[05:48.480 --> 05:50.320]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[05:50.320 --> 05:56.320]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[05:56.320 --> 06:24.320]  For more information, visit our website at www.Renfeworst.com, I'm David Knight.
[06:26.320 --> 06:38.760]  All right, I'm going to open up this Sunday broadcast with a very, very important video
[06:38.760 --> 06:42.720]  that we've just posted, it's infowars.com, I'm going to tweet it out at real life shows
[06:42.720 --> 06:45.680]  as well and on our Facebook.
[06:45.680 --> 06:51.480]  It's the Trump Effect, Trump the Establishment is the name of the video, most powerful Trump
[06:51.480 --> 06:54.240]  video to date in my view.
[06:54.240 --> 06:57.560]  We're going to air this six minute video and then come back with the latest news, but
[06:57.560 --> 07:02.400]  the entire global corrupt power structure is against Donald Trump right now.
[07:02.400 --> 07:07.600]  If we claim we're against the corrupt power structure, how would we not support Donald
[07:07.600 --> 07:10.040]  Trump is the simple question.
[07:10.040 --> 07:14.560]  We have his report in Gettysburg yesterday, it's incredible, we have so much today, but
[07:14.560 --> 07:20.760]  this really is Americanism versus globalism right now, and here is the report.
[07:20.760 --> 07:27.960]  Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new
[07:27.960 --> 07:31.760]  government controlled by you, the American people.
[07:31.760 --> 07:37.960]  The Washington establishment and the financial and media corporations that funded exist for
[07:37.960 --> 07:42.880]  only one reason to protect and enrich itself.
[07:42.880 --> 07:47.080]  The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election.
[07:47.080 --> 07:52.200]  For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interest,
[07:52.200 --> 07:57.920]  they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind.
[07:57.920 --> 08:05.800]  Our campaign represents a true existential threat like they haven't seen before.
[08:05.800 --> 08:11.960]  This is not simply another four year election, this is a crossroads in the history of our
[08:11.960 --> 08:20.000]  civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our
[08:20.000 --> 08:21.000]  government.
[08:21.000 --> 08:27.680]  The political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for
[08:27.680 --> 08:35.880]  our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies
[08:35.880 --> 08:40.240]  that have bled our country dry.
[08:40.240 --> 08:46.360]  Our political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs
[08:46.360 --> 08:51.400]  as they flee to Mexico, China, and other countries all around the world.
[08:51.400 --> 08:57.360]  It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed
[08:57.360 --> 09:02.760]  our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets
[09:02.760 --> 09:08.800]  of a handful of large corporations and political entities.
[09:08.800 --> 09:16.120]  This is a struggle for the survival of our nation, and this will be our last chance to
[09:16.120 --> 09:17.120]  save it.
[09:17.120 --> 09:21.280]  This election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the
[09:21.280 --> 09:27.960]  illusion of democracy, but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests
[09:27.960 --> 09:31.160]  rigging the system, and our system is rigged.
[09:31.160 --> 09:33.480]  This is reality.
[09:33.480 --> 09:39.880]  You know it, they know it, I know it, and pretty much the whole world knows it.
[09:39.880 --> 09:44.480]  The Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure.
[09:44.480 --> 09:49.600]  We've seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in
[09:49.600 --> 09:56.680]  secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to
[09:56.680 --> 10:03.880]  enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends, and her donors.
[10:03.880 --> 10:08.040]  Honestly, she should be locked up.
[10:08.040 --> 10:14.000]  The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media, the press.
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.520]  Let's be clear on one thing, the corporate media in our country is no longer involved
[10:19.520 --> 10:20.520]  in journalism.
[10:20.520 --> 10:26.640]  They're a political, special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial
[10:26.640 --> 10:35.160]  entity with a total political agenda, and the agenda is not for you, it's for themselves.
[10:35.160 --> 10:41.200]  Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe.
[10:41.200 --> 10:49.120]  They will lie, lie, lie, and then again, they will do worse than that.
[10:49.120 --> 10:52.280]  They will do whatever is necessary.
[10:52.280 --> 10:55.040]  The Clintons are criminals, remember that.
[10:55.040 --> 11:01.720]  This is well documented, and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive
[11:01.720 --> 11:09.560]  cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation
[11:09.560 --> 11:13.120]  in order to keep the Clintons in power.
[11:13.120 --> 11:18.800]  They knew they would throw every lie they couldn't make, and my family and my loved ones.
[11:18.800 --> 11:23.320]  They knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me.
[11:23.320 --> 11:29.240]  Nevertheless, I take all of these slings and arrows gladly for you.
[11:29.240 --> 11:34.360]  I take them for our movement so that we can have our country back.
[11:34.360 --> 11:35.880]  I knew this day would arrive.
[11:35.880 --> 11:38.720]  It's only a question of when.
[11:38.720 --> 11:45.360]  And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.
[11:45.360 --> 11:49.840]  The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you.
[11:49.840 --> 11:54.160]  The only force strong enough to save our country is us.
[11:54.160 --> 11:59.320]  The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American
[11:59.320 --> 12:00.320]  people.
[12:00.320 --> 12:06.040]  Our great civilization has come upon a moment of reckoning.
[12:06.040 --> 12:08.160]  I didn't need to do this, folks, believe me.
[12:08.160 --> 12:11.480]  I built a great company, and I had a wonderful life.
[12:11.480 --> 12:16.720]  I could have enjoyed the fruits and benefits of years of successful business deals and
[12:16.720 --> 12:21.400]  businesses for myself and my family, instead of going through this absolute horror show
[12:21.400 --> 12:27.400]  of lies, deceptions, malicious attacks, who would have thought?
[12:27.400 --> 12:35.600]  I'm doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel so strongly that it's
[12:35.600 --> 12:41.240]  my turn to give back to the country that I love.
[12:41.240 --> 12:49.440]  I'm doing this for the people and for the movement, and we will take back this country
[12:49.440 --> 12:56.840]  for you, and we will make America great again.
[12:56.840 --> 13:02.280]  Hashtag Trump establishment.
[13:02.280 --> 13:06.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, the elite would never allow somebody to do something like this.
[13:06.520 --> 13:08.520]  This is outside the box.
[13:08.520 --> 13:09.520]  That's why they're thrown in.
[13:09.520 --> 13:13.360]  Everything they've got, both political parties, the entire power structure, all the foreign
[13:13.360 --> 13:18.520]  banks, all the foreign governments, the Pope, the Communist Chinese, the Saudi Arabians,
[13:18.520 --> 13:21.000]  the kitchen sink.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.400]  They've thrown everything but the Easter Bunny at Donald Trump because they've stolen
[13:25.400 --> 13:26.400]  this country.
[13:26.400 --> 13:27.400]  We've been conquered by economics.
[13:27.400 --> 13:28.800]  We've been sold out.
[13:28.800 --> 13:33.640]  We've been used to build a world government, and they know Donald Trump just wants a fair
[13:33.640 --> 13:35.160]  deal for America.
[13:35.160 --> 13:38.200]  That brings down their whole system.
[13:38.200 --> 13:41.040]  They are panicking.
[13:41.040 --> 13:42.440]  They are crapping their pants.
[13:42.440 --> 13:44.840]  They have pulled out all their stops.
[13:44.840 --> 13:50.000]  The Brexit, the UK is pulling out of the EU, Russia is pulling out of it.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.640]  All these other countries, Australia is pulling out of carbon taxes, and globalism, Catalonia
[13:54.640 --> 13:55.640]  is pulling out of Spain.
[13:55.640 --> 13:59.160]  Iceland is pulling out of the EU.
[13:59.160 --> 14:04.200]  Latin American countries are waking up, and the New World Order is panicking right at
[14:04.200 --> 14:10.200]  the point that they plan to bring us all into a worldwide depression to bankrupt everyone
[14:10.200 --> 14:11.720]  that could solid a control.
[14:11.720 --> 14:13.920]  These banks don't want prosperity.
[14:13.920 --> 14:16.120]  They want total control.
[14:16.120 --> 14:24.560]  And you see Hillary, the poster child, they had two different CNN focus group polls where
[14:24.560 --> 14:31.680]  they voted 10 to 5 and 8 to 5, two different videos I have today, and CNN just cuts the
[14:31.680 --> 14:32.680]  feed.
[14:32.680 --> 14:36.960]  They go to their focus group, so we've got how many for Trump, okay, 10, how many for
[14:36.960 --> 14:42.680]  Hillary, 5, how many independents, 5, they cut when 10 are for Trump.
[14:42.680 --> 14:45.840]  I've got another video, same deal.
[14:45.840 --> 14:47.880]  The internal polls show him 15 points ahead.
[14:47.880 --> 14:49.160]  There is a landslide.
[14:49.160 --> 14:50.760]  Hillary has no crowds.
[14:50.760 --> 14:54.120]  She has nothing, but they're panicking.
[14:54.120 --> 14:56.400]  They plan to steal the election.
[14:56.400 --> 14:59.960]  They're trying to think of you as soft-minded, weak-minded, selling you.
[14:59.960 --> 15:01.800]  This doesn't mean Trump's perfect, no.
[15:01.800 --> 15:03.360]  But he's not out to get the country.
[15:03.360 --> 15:06.240]  The globalists stole this nation.
[15:06.240 --> 15:08.040]  They've taken control of it.
[15:08.040 --> 15:09.040]  They've consolidated control.
[15:09.040 --> 15:11.040]  But here's the goodness.
[15:11.040 --> 15:16.400]  Whether they steal the election or whether a Trump wins or whether he loses, nationalism,
[15:16.400 --> 15:20.240]  awareness of the private federal reserve, awareness of these big banking combines is
[15:20.240 --> 15:22.760]  now public.
[15:22.760 --> 15:25.960]  And there's no putting that back in the bottle.
[15:25.960 --> 15:30.800]  That genie is out, Pandora's box is open, that train left the station.
[15:30.800 --> 15:34.240]  Now, not this segment, but next, I'm going to open the phones up and take your phone
[15:34.240 --> 15:37.320]  calls throughout the three quarters of the broadcast.
[15:37.320 --> 15:41.120]  When we come back, I've got more clips here, as they desperately try to start a race war
[15:41.120 --> 15:44.600]  on this country and have all these football players take an eater on the National Anthem
[15:44.600 --> 15:46.680]  and folks, you know, do this.
[15:46.680 --> 15:50.400]  It's just all distraction, so we all fight with each other so we don't notice the big
[15:50.400 --> 15:51.400]  banks what they're up to.
[15:51.400 --> 15:56.080]  We've also got other big clips as well and more Trump speeches straight ahead, but history's
[15:56.080 --> 15:57.080]  happening.
[15:57.080 --> 16:00.760]  Electrify your day with secret 12.
[16:00.760 --> 16:02.280]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[16:02.280 --> 16:06.240]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.

[18:58.040 --> 19:00.040]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[19:00.040 --> 19:04.040]  Will you and your family be financially protected if there's another economic meltdown?
[19:04.040 --> 19:08.040]  Like many experts, I believe another devastating crash is coming.
[19:08.040 --> 19:10.040]  I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[19:10.040 --> 19:13.040]  Don't wait for another crisis that could wipe out your hard-earned money.
[19:13.040 --> 19:18.040]  Do what I did and call United States Gold Vault at 844-541-ALAX.
[19:18.040 --> 19:20.040]  It's a company I trust.
[19:20.040 --> 19:26.040]  They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs that could help safeguard your money in an economic meltdown.
[19:26.040 --> 19:29.040]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[19:29.040 --> 19:33.040]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move.
[19:33.040 --> 19:39.040]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting finances.
[19:39.040 --> 19:46.040]  Don't delay, call 844-541-ALAX now and get a rugged, double-locked bank bag to securely store your coins.
[19:46.040 --> 19:47.040]  Absolutely free.
[19:47.040 --> 19:52.040]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[19:52.040 --> 19:55.040]  I personally own these survival packs and you should too.
[19:55.040 --> 20:10.040]  Call 844-541-ALAX now.
[20:26.040 --> 20:32.040]  So last segment we aired a very powerful compilation of Trump speeches.
[20:32.040 --> 20:36.040]  Talking about where America is and what we've gone through and basically what the stakes are.
[20:36.040 --> 20:40.040]  But he gave a speech a few days ago in Gettysburg.
[20:40.040 --> 20:43.040]  It's about 35 minutes long and there are some of it now and some of it in the next segment.
[20:43.040 --> 20:49.040]  I don't normally come on the show and just share Trump speeches, but Trump is promoting true Americana.
[20:49.040 --> 20:51.040]  He believes America is smart.
[20:51.040 --> 20:53.040]  He believes America understands what's happening.
[20:53.040 --> 20:56.040]  He believes America sees through the mainstream media.
[20:56.040 --> 21:00.040]  He really believes that you're not under their control.
[21:00.040 --> 21:06.040]  And I talked to people all over the place in Austin, which is a liberal town, almost no one is voting for Hillary.
[21:06.040 --> 21:10.040]  They know the nomination was stolen from Bernie Sanders.
[21:10.040 --> 21:12.040]  They're awake.
[21:12.040 --> 21:14.040]  So again, isn't that the Trump is perfect?
[21:14.040 --> 21:19.040]  Instead, he represents what made this country great.
[21:19.040 --> 21:21.040]  Here's Donald Trump.
[21:21.040 --> 21:25.040]  Our infrastructure is in such trouble.
[21:25.040 --> 21:32.040]  We've doubled our national debt to $20 trillion under President Obama.
[21:32.040 --> 21:39.040]  In less than eight years, $10 trillion has been added.
[21:39.040 --> 21:40.040]  Think of it.
[21:40.040 --> 21:42.040]  And we haven't fixed anything.
[21:42.040 --> 21:43.040]  We haven't fixed anything.
[21:43.040 --> 21:44.040]  What have we done?
[21:44.040 --> 21:48.040]  Our roads are broken, our bridges, our tunnels, our hospitals, our schools.
[21:48.040 --> 21:54.040]  And we have $20 trillion in debt, all time high.
[21:54.040 --> 21:55.040]  That's true.
[21:55.040 --> 21:59.040]  Our VA hospitals are in bad shape, and our VA is in very, very bad shape.
[21:59.040 --> 22:00.040]  And we will fix that.
[22:00.040 --> 22:08.040]  We are going to work on fixing that because our veterans have not been treated properly.
[22:08.040 --> 22:13.040]  We have illegal immigrants that are treated far better, in many instances, than our veterans.
[22:13.040 --> 22:17.040]  And we're not going to have that.
[22:17.040 --> 22:36.040]  The Choice and Education Opportunity Act redirects education dollars to give parents the right to send their kid, their children, to public, private, charter, magnet, religious, or home schools of their choice.
[22:36.040 --> 22:48.040]  And so importantly, we're going to end Common Core and bring education supervision to local communities.
[22:48.040 --> 22:50.040]  We do so badly on education.
[22:50.040 --> 22:58.040]  If you look at the lists, and you see Sweden, Norway, Denmark, China, different countries at the top, you see us at the bottom.
[22:58.040 --> 23:05.040]  And yet, by far, per pupil, more money than anybody, and it's not even close.
[23:05.040 --> 23:09.040]  We spend more money per pupil than anybody, not even close.
[23:09.040 --> 23:10.040]  We're at the bottom of the list.
[23:10.040 --> 23:15.040]  Other countries spending far less per pupil are at the top of the list.
[23:15.040 --> 23:19.040]  So obviously, our current system is not working.
[23:19.040 --> 23:24.040]  We will change it, and we will make it good.
[23:24.040 --> 23:31.040]  It expands vocational and technical education, which we've totally forgotten about in this country,
[23:31.040 --> 23:36.040]  and make two and four-year colleges more affordable.
[23:36.040 --> 23:42.040]  Have you ever gone to school and you've been with people that aren't good students, but they can fix an engine,
[23:42.040 --> 23:48.040]  or they can build a wall, or they can do things that you wouldn't even think about?
[23:48.040 --> 23:50.040]  Because we can use some of the ones that build the wall.
[23:50.040 --> 23:52.040]  We're going to need them.
[23:52.040 --> 23:56.040]  We're going to need them.
[23:56.040 --> 24:00.040]  We're going to need them.
[24:00.040 --> 24:04.040]  But did you ever see that, how they're genius at fixing a car?
[24:04.040 --> 24:05.040]  They can do anything.
[24:05.040 --> 24:07.040]  But history, not so good.
[24:07.040 --> 24:09.040]  Physics, not so good.
[24:09.040 --> 24:12.040]  We have to open vocational again.
[24:12.040 --> 24:13.040]  Those are the people.
[24:13.040 --> 24:17.040]  These are great people.
[24:17.040 --> 24:26.040]  The Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act.
[24:26.040 --> 24:32.040]  Fully repeal Obamacare and replace it with health savings accounts.
[24:32.040 --> 24:33.040]  So we can do that.
[24:33.040 --> 24:36.040]  The health savings accounts, it's one way.
[24:36.040 --> 24:37.040]  There are numerous ways.
[24:37.040 --> 24:39.040]  But this is one very good way.
[24:39.040 --> 24:45.040]  The ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, which we have to do because that's competition.
[24:45.040 --> 24:51.040]  The politicians won't let go of it because the insurance companies, they don't want competition.
[24:51.040 --> 24:52.040]  But we'll open it up.
[24:52.040 --> 24:53.040]  Believe me, we'll get rid of that.
[24:53.040 --> 24:58.040]  I've been saying it for years and let states manage Medicaid funds.
[24:58.040 --> 25:01.040]  It will be so good.
[25:01.040 --> 25:05.040]  Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA.
[25:05.040 --> 25:08.040]  There are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval.
[25:08.040 --> 25:14.040]  And we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.
[25:14.040 --> 25:19.040]  I mean, they're looking at drugs that are looking very good.
[25:19.040 --> 25:25.040]  And you have terminal patients that it's over, these people.
[25:25.040 --> 25:26.040]  They're dying.
[25:26.040 --> 25:28.040]  They want to get the drug.
[25:28.040 --> 25:30.040]  They won't be living much longer.
[25:30.040 --> 25:33.040]  And we study it for years and years.
[25:33.040 --> 25:37.040]  At some point, they have to do what they have to do.
[25:37.040 --> 25:38.040]  They have to do it properly.
[25:38.040 --> 25:43.040]  But we have 4,000 different drugs and products waiting in line for approval.
[25:43.040 --> 25:45.040]  And we can't get them approved.
[25:45.040 --> 25:48.040]  We're going to speed up that process very significantly.
[25:48.040 --> 25:54.040]  Affordable Child Care and Elder Care Act allows Americans to deduct child care
[25:54.040 --> 26:00.040]  and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site
[26:00.040 --> 26:03.040]  and so important child care services.
[26:03.040 --> 26:07.040]  You see that with a couple of companies and it's such a great thing to see.
[26:07.040 --> 26:11.040]  And it creates tax free dependent care savings accounts for both young
[26:11.040 --> 26:17.040]  and elderly dependents with matching contributions for low income families.
[26:17.040 --> 26:30.040]  And illegal immigration act fully funds the construction of a wall
[26:30.040 --> 26:32.040]  on our southern border.
[26:32.040 --> 26:33.040]  Don't worry about it.
[26:33.040 --> 26:38.040]  Remember, I said Mexico's paying for the wall with the full understanding
[26:38.040 --> 26:43.040]  that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States
[26:43.040 --> 26:46.040]  for the full cost of such a wall.
[26:46.040 --> 26:48.040]  We're going to have the wall.
[26:48.040 --> 26:50.040]  Mexico's going to pay for the wall.
[26:50.040 --> 26:57.040]  Mexico's, by the way, I met with the President of Mexico two and a half months ago.
[26:57.040 --> 26:59.040]  Wonderful meeting, wonderful person.
[26:59.040 --> 27:04.040]  But I told him it's a two-way highway, not a one-way highway.
[27:04.040 --> 27:07.040]  We have our people.
[27:07.040 --> 27:09.040]  We have to take care of our people.
[27:09.040 --> 27:10.040]  We have to protect our people.
[27:10.040 --> 27:12.040]  So it's got to be a two-way street.
[27:12.040 --> 27:16.040]  Otherwise, it's going to be a whole different deal.
[27:16.040 --> 27:21.040]  But it establishes a two-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence.
[27:21.040 --> 27:26.040]  These are people coming in illegally for illegally re-entering the United States
[27:26.040 --> 27:32.040]  after a previous deportation and a five-year mandatory minimum
[27:32.040 --> 27:37.040]  for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions,
[27:37.040 --> 27:43.040]  multiple misdemeanor convictions, or two or more prior deportations.
[27:43.040 --> 27:47.040]  So when somebody comes in, we send them out.
[27:47.040 --> 27:50.040]  They come back in, they go to prison for quite a while.
[27:50.040 --> 27:54.040]  They come back, they come back again, they go five years.
[27:54.040 --> 27:58.040]  Because what's happening is they're coming back ten times.
[27:58.040 --> 28:05.040]  And I could go case after case, they come back, look at what happened in San Francisco.
[28:05.040 --> 28:09.040]  Five times he came back on the fifth time he killed Kate.
[28:09.040 --> 28:10.040]  Five times.
[28:10.040 --> 28:11.040]  But so many others.
[28:11.040 --> 28:13.040]  One ten times came back.
[28:13.040 --> 28:15.040]  Killed somebody after ten times.
[28:15.040 --> 28:18.040]  When they get deported, they stay out otherwise.
[28:18.040 --> 28:19.040]  We're going to come back with the rest of this,
[28:19.040 --> 28:23.040]  but it's nothing against Mexico or China or Russia or anybody.
[28:23.040 --> 28:25.040]  Tuberculosis is coming in.
[28:25.040 --> 28:27.040]  AIDS is coming in.
[28:27.040 --> 28:30.040]  Drug-resistant bacteria are coming in.
[28:30.040 --> 28:32.040]  We have leprosy coming back in.
[28:32.040 --> 28:35.040]  Nobody lets people in that have committed crimes.
[28:35.040 --> 28:38.040]  If I want to fly out of Cancun, they check my license to make sure I'm out of criminal.
[28:38.040 --> 28:40.040]  That's fine, that's their country.
[28:40.040 --> 28:41.040]  Mexico.
[28:41.040 --> 28:43.040]  So they demonize trouble bringing this up.
[28:43.040 --> 28:45.040]  And this is just common sense you're hearing.
[28:45.040 --> 28:49.040]  Meanwhile, the big money is financing race war in this country.
[28:49.040 --> 28:53.040]  We are 15 days out from this historic election.
[28:53.040 --> 28:57.040]  More of this speech than your phone calls coming up on this Sunday edition.
[28:57.040 --> 29:02.040]  Brainforce, it's completely different. Try a bottle of it. Rob Doe joins us.
[29:02.040 --> 29:05.040]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[29:05.040 --> 29:06.040]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[29:06.040 --> 29:10.040]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[29:10.040 --> 29:13.040]  I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down.
[29:13.040 --> 29:15.040]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[29:15.040 --> 29:17.040]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[29:17.040 --> 29:20.040]  I got my bottle of Brainforce right there. I popped two of them.
[29:20.040 --> 29:24.040]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind of clears up.
[29:24.040 --> 29:27.040]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it.
[29:27.040 --> 29:32.040]  Read about it. Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[29:32.040 --> 29:37.040]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[29:37.040 --> 29:39.040]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[29:39.040 --> 29:41.040]  but I probably could not have done it without Brainforce.
[29:41.040 --> 29:43.040]  I went home about 6.45 this morning.
[29:43.040 --> 29:47.040]  Took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brainforce and came in.
[29:47.040 --> 29:53.040]  You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com
[29:53.040 --> 29:57.040]  or call 888-253-3139.
[29:59.040 --> 30:02.040]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in,
[30:02.040 --> 30:06.040]  one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about in the debates or anywhere
[30:06.040 --> 30:11.040]  is the vulnerability of the power grid, the potential for power grid chaos,
[30:11.040 --> 30:17.040]  EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms.
[30:17.040 --> 30:19.040]  All a very real threat to our grid.
[30:19.040 --> 30:22.040]  My friend's chaos is already here and it's going to get a lot worse.
[30:22.040 --> 30:25.040]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have
[30:25.040 --> 30:28.040]  a way to produce their own supply of backup electricity.
[30:28.040 --> 30:32.040]  Now, I've got the perfect power-solar generator system in my house.
[30:32.040 --> 30:34.040]  The Solutions from Science system.
[30:34.040 --> 30:36.040]  Simply put, this thing is amazing.
[30:36.040 --> 30:39.040]  Solutions from Science only makes the best equipment.

[31:58.040 --> 32:02.040]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from InfoWareShore.com.
[32:02.040 --> 32:05.040]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists
[32:05.040 --> 32:10.040]  to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[32:10.040 --> 32:14.040]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at InfoWareShore.com
[32:14.040 --> 32:18.040]  is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals,
[32:18.040 --> 32:21.040]  and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.

[32:25.040 --> 32:29.040]  like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[32:29.040 --> 32:33.040]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[32:33.040 --> 32:37.040]  with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process
[32:37.040 --> 32:39.040]  designed for maximized effects.
[32:39.040 --> 32:43.040]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[32:43.040 --> 32:48.040]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived
[32:48.040 --> 32:50.040]  or of the highest quality lab standard.
[32:50.040 --> 32:53.040]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure.

[33:27.040 --> 33:31.040]  877-789-2539 is the toll-free number to join us.
[33:31.040 --> 33:34.040]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment on the election,
[33:34.040 --> 33:36.040]  the world economy, the situation with Russia,
[33:36.040 --> 33:39.040]  the top British general saying the U.S. is already at war with Russia.
[33:39.040 --> 33:42.040]  That was a Friday article at InfoWareShore.com.
[33:42.040 --> 33:47.040]  877-789-2539, first-time callers in the first round.
[33:47.040 --> 33:53.040]  877-789-2539, your call is coming up in the next segment.
[33:53.040 --> 33:56.040]  I don't know if I can just fill the show full of clips,
[33:56.040 --> 33:58.040]  but these Donald Trump speeches are powerful.
[33:58.040 --> 34:00.040]  They are Americana.
[34:00.040 --> 34:03.040]  Hey, if you want to live in North Korea or communist China
[34:03.040 --> 34:06.040]  or former Soviet Russia getting a time machine, go back 20 years.
[34:06.040 --> 34:08.040]  This is what made America great.
[34:08.040 --> 34:10.040]  This is what Donald Trump is promoting.
[34:10.040 --> 34:15.040]  This is what Donald Trump is standing for.
[34:15.040 --> 34:20.040]  Kennedy cut taxes in the standard tax bracket from poor to middle class
[34:20.040 --> 34:25.040]  by 50% tax receipts doubled in the next couple of years.
[34:25.040 --> 34:30.040]  We cut taxes, more money comes in, but the social engineers don't want that.
[34:30.040 --> 34:32.040]  They want control.
[34:32.040 --> 34:35.040]  And so the entire media, everybody else screwing us,
[34:35.040 --> 34:38.040]  is telling us we can't have Donald Trump.
[34:38.040 --> 34:41.040]  What a referendum on America.
[34:41.040 --> 34:46.040]  If America doesn't choose Trump, I don't know what they're choosing
[34:46.040 --> 34:50.040]  because even if you don't like some of what Trump stands for
[34:50.040 --> 34:54.040]  and neither do I at some level, Hillary is the establishment.
[34:54.040 --> 34:57.040]  And Hillary has the media and corporations behind her.
[34:57.040 --> 35:00.040]  Aren't you tired of grease skids towards tyranny?
[35:00.040 --> 35:04.040]  With Trump, it will gum the whole system up and slow stuff down.
[35:04.040 --> 35:08.040]  Gridlock's what made this country great.
[35:08.040 --> 35:10.040]  We don't need thousands of more laws.
[35:10.040 --> 35:12.040]  We don't need more regulations for special interests.
[35:12.040 --> 35:15.040]  Here's Trump at Gettysburg.
[35:15.040 --> 35:17.040]  What happened in San Francisco?
[35:17.040 --> 35:21.040]  Five times he came back on the fifth time he killed Kate.
[35:21.040 --> 35:23.040]  Five times, but so many others.
[35:23.040 --> 35:27.040]  One ten times came back, killed somebody after ten times.
[35:27.040 --> 35:29.040]  When they get deported, they stay out.
[35:29.040 --> 35:33.040]  Otherwise, they have very serious prison terms.
[35:33.040 --> 35:34.040]  They will stay out.
[35:34.040 --> 35:37.040]  Once you do that, they will stay out.
[35:37.040 --> 35:39.040]  Right now, they have no consequence.
[35:39.040 --> 35:41.040]  They have no consequences.
[35:41.040 --> 35:46.040]  Also, reforms on visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying
[35:46.040 --> 35:50.040]  and to ensure open jobs are offered to American lawyers.
[35:50.040 --> 35:52.040]  Many of the killers could just go to Mexico, whoever they want to.
[35:52.040 --> 35:54.040]  Crazy America, but I'm not going anywhere.
[35:54.040 --> 35:59.040]  Number eight, restoring community safety act reduces surging crime,
[35:59.040 --> 36:03.040]  drugs and violence by creating a task force on violent crime,
[36:03.040 --> 36:08.040]  and increasing funding for programs that train and assist your local police
[36:08.040 --> 36:15.040]  who are doing such a great job, believe me.
[36:15.040 --> 36:19.040]  We increase the resources for federal law enforcement agencies
[36:19.040 --> 36:22.040]  and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs
[36:22.040 --> 36:27.040]  and put violent offenders behind bars or out of our country
[36:27.040 --> 36:34.040]  and into the country where they came from.
[36:34.040 --> 36:38.040]  Restoring National Security Act, which rebuilds our military
[36:38.040 --> 36:43.040]  by eliminating the defense sequester, which has been very tough on our military,
[36:43.040 --> 36:46.040]  and expanding military investment.
[36:46.040 --> 36:52.040]  Now, at no time, practically, do we need a military like right now.
[36:52.040 --> 36:57.040]  We don't want to use it, but it's peace through strength.
[36:57.040 --> 37:00.040]  We need a strong military.
[37:00.040 --> 37:06.040]  Our military is so terribly depleted.
[37:06.040 --> 37:11.040]  It also provides our great veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment
[37:11.040 --> 37:14.040]  or attend a private doctor of their choice.
[37:14.040 --> 37:18.040]  If they're waiting online, and I have the plan up,
[37:18.040 --> 37:23.040]  and we've gotten, as you know, tremendous support from veterans,
[37:23.040 --> 37:28.040]  from law enforcement, from veterans, from the military, tremendous support.
[37:28.040 --> 37:33.040]  But if they're waiting online, and you see it, 22 suicides a day.
[37:33.040 --> 37:35.040]  People don't even believe it, 22 a day.
[37:35.040 --> 37:40.040]  But if they're waiting online for seven days, six days, nine days,
[37:40.040 --> 37:46.040]  they can't get to see a doctor, and a simple procedure or a simple prescription
[37:46.040 --> 37:51.040]  can solve their problem, and they become very sick, and they die.
[37:51.040 --> 37:53.040]  They die waiting online.
[37:53.040 --> 37:58.040]  We're going to give them the power to go across the street to a local doctor,
[37:58.040 --> 38:01.040]  a private doctor, a public hospital, or a private hospital,
[38:01.040 --> 38:06.040]  all looking to help and all looking to do business, and we'll pay the bill.
[38:06.040 --> 38:12.040]  So much cheaper, but much more importantly, the veterans will finally be taken care of properly,
[38:12.040 --> 38:14.040]  because what they're going through now is unacceptable.
[38:14.040 --> 38:25.040]  Also, we're going to protect our vital infrastructure from the new thing.
[38:25.040 --> 38:27.040]  It's called cyber attack.
[38:27.040 --> 38:33.040]  It establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country
[38:33.040 --> 38:36.040]  support our people and our values.
[38:36.040 --> 38:40.040]  We want people that love our country or can love our country,
[38:40.040 --> 38:44.040]  and people that will love our citizens.
[38:44.040 --> 38:51.040]  We want people that can love us, and there are ways through talent of determining that,
[38:51.040 --> 38:54.040]  and other countries do, but we don't.
[38:54.040 --> 38:57.040]  Just come on in, folks, come on in.
[38:57.040 --> 39:00.040]  Clean up corruption in Washington Act.
[39:00.040 --> 39:07.040]  Enact tough new ethic reforms to reduce the corrupting influence of special interests
[39:07.040 --> 39:11.040]  and donors on our politics.
[39:11.040 --> 39:18.040]  On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our country,
[39:18.040 --> 39:24.040]  secure our communities, and honesty to our government.
[39:24.040 --> 39:29.040]  This is my pledge to you, and if we follow these steps,
[39:29.040 --> 39:35.040]  we will once more have a government of, by, and for the people.
[39:35.040 --> 39:41.040]  And, importantly, we will make America great again.
[39:41.040 --> 39:44.040]  Believe me. Thank you. Thank you.
[39:44.040 --> 39:47.040]  Thank you very much.
[39:47.040 --> 39:53.040]  If you go back 200 years ago, the major British newspapers wrote about the American problem.
[39:53.040 --> 39:57.040]  Now, about World War I, the British royalty and the British power structure
[39:57.040 --> 40:02.040]  had kind of gotten control of our country, the council and farm relations at Bradstreet in New York.
[40:02.040 --> 40:05.040]  I'm not blaming the British, they're not the power structure today,
[40:05.040 --> 40:08.040]  but it was a model of control of the British Empire that we're now under.
[40:08.040 --> 40:12.040]  This is what globalism is, but now it's corporations, not British royalty, running it.
[40:12.040 --> 40:14.040]  But they took it over. This is all public.
[40:14.040 --> 40:17.040]  If you just research mainline political science, this is well known.
[40:17.040 --> 40:20.040]  Just the public's not informed about it.
[40:20.040 --> 40:23.040]  And they said, we're in competition with the American system.
[40:23.040 --> 40:26.040]  We can't deal with this. So the answer was take it over.
[40:26.040 --> 40:29.040]  Now, they got off the American system by World War I
[40:29.040 --> 40:35.040]  and the Germans had developed all these thousands of patents on chemicals and on industry.
[40:35.040 --> 40:40.040]  You name it. So Germany was taking over, not through colonialism,
[40:40.040 --> 40:43.040]  through politics and through military, but through innovation.
[40:43.040 --> 40:47.040]  The Austrian Hungarian Empire, bigger than Germany, but Germany later.
[40:47.040 --> 40:52.040]  And so they started World War I with the Germans by assassinating their crown prince, Fred Ferdinand.
[40:52.040 --> 40:55.040]  Look it up. That's all public.
[40:55.040 --> 41:01.040]  So there's a system that's anti free market, this anti renaissance that's been running for over 100 years,
[41:01.040 --> 41:08.040]  longer than that, but big time 100 years that wants to shut down competition.
[41:08.040 --> 41:11.040]  And Trump gets that and he knows that.
[41:11.040 --> 41:14.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can't hold America down.
[41:14.040 --> 41:17.040]  China's had 10% growth rates for 50 years.
[41:17.040 --> 41:20.040]  We used to have 50% growth rates. I mean, 10% growth rates.
[41:20.040 --> 41:24.040]  So they've cut China's growth rate to like seven. They cut ours to like one.
[41:24.040 --> 41:28.040]  We should have 10% growth rates every year.
[41:28.040 --> 41:35.040]  But instead they've trained us to have 1% or 2% and China have 7%.
[41:35.040 --> 41:39.040]  We've been totally screwed over and Trump understands this.
[41:39.040 --> 41:44.040]  Trump knows that we've been brought down to 1% growth rate on a 7% or 10% growth rate.
[41:44.040 --> 41:49.040]  That's how you can actually grow an economy is having growth rates like that.
[41:49.040 --> 41:52.040]  That's what creates wealth. They want to post industrial world.
[41:52.040 --> 41:56.040]  They've sold the idea of liberals that being poor and being austere is cool.
[41:56.040 --> 42:02.040]  Okay, fine. If the elite do that too, then I can hear the argument, but it's not that.
[42:02.040 --> 42:05.040]  It's a way to totally consolidate controls.
[42:05.040 --> 42:07.040]  We're going to come back from break and take your phone calls.
[42:07.040 --> 42:14.040]  Gary and Mark and Darrell and Matt and Larry and Josh and Owen and others that are patiently holding.
[42:14.040 --> 42:16.040]  It's all free number to join us.
[42:16.040 --> 42:19.040]  This is the Sunday show number. We produce everything in house.
[42:19.040 --> 42:26.040]  During the weekdays is 877-789 Alex 877-789-2539.
[42:26.040 --> 42:29.040]  I'm going to come back and take your call one after the other.
[42:29.040 --> 42:36.040]  Then I have several special reports on the economy, on world military developments and more that are coming up.
[42:36.040 --> 42:41.040]  But bottom line, most big elites can't innovate with science or technology.
[42:41.040 --> 42:47.040]  They just innovate by buying off governments and passing regulations to shut down their competition.
[42:47.040 --> 42:50.040]  And Donald Trump is trying to break that right now.
[42:50.040 --> 42:55.040]  And if we don't take this as a godsend and let Donald Trump, we deserve what we get.
[42:55.040 --> 43:21.040]  Plus they're planning to steal it.
[43:21.040 --> 43:26.040]  Oh yeah.
[43:26.040 --> 43:28.040]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[43:28.040 --> 43:31.040]  It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand paul reveres.
[43:31.040 --> 43:37.040]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[43:37.040 --> 43:40.040]  And beef was for supper.
[43:40.040 --> 43:46.040]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[43:46.040 --> 43:51.040]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin.
[43:51.040 --> 43:54.040]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue?

[44:54.040 --> 44:58.040]  Check it out for yourself today.
[44:58.040 --> 45:03.040]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[45:03.040 --> 45:08.040]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[45:08.040 --> 45:13.040]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[45:13.040 --> 45:21.040]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[45:21.040 --> 45:28.040]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[45:28.040 --> 45:29.040]  These are all parasites.
[45:29.040 --> 45:32.040]  Tell us about that all of a sudden. There's so many things that are in it.
[45:32.040 --> 45:36.040]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[45:36.040 --> 45:40.040]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[45:40.040 --> 45:43.040]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[45:43.040 --> 45:46.040]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarsteam.com.
[45:46.040 --> 45:49.040]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.

[45:55.040 --> 45:58.040]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[45:58.040 --> 46:06.040]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[46:06.040 --> 46:08.040]  Dr. Group, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[46:08.040 --> 46:14.040]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[46:14.040 --> 46:20.040]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[46:20.040 --> 46:23.040]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[46:23.040 --> 46:25.040]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[46:25.040 --> 46:29.040]  It shows the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[46:29.040 --> 46:34.040]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It works like an antioxidant.
[46:34.040 --> 46:37.040]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[46:37.040 --> 46:41.040]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.

[47:16.040 --> 47:26.040]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[47:46.040 --> 47:52.040]  I'm going to do one or two or three or four or five or six, but three.
[47:52.040 --> 47:58.040]  Faces regulatory cloud with elections looming, more and more media industry consolidation.
[47:58.040 --> 48:04.040]  Renovation of the web. And you've got Hillary in multiple national polls, two to five points behind.
[48:04.040 --> 48:08.040]  L.A. Times. You name it.
[48:08.040 --> 48:15.040]  Trump up two points nationwide while Clinton campaigned as if the race is already won.
[48:15.040 --> 48:20.040]  That's the IBD TIPP presidential election tracking poll.
[48:20.040 --> 48:25.040]  We've got Associated Press polls. We've got Bloomberg polls.
[48:25.040 --> 48:29.040]  We've got L.A. Times polls showing her behind two to five points.
[48:29.040 --> 48:33.040]  Trump two to five points ahead.
[48:33.040 --> 48:41.040]  Meanwhile, Goldman CEO, Blank Find is supportive of Clinton.
[48:41.040 --> 48:47.040]  Silicon Valley all in. Basically 100% of those donations are going to Clinton.
[48:47.040 --> 48:51.040]  But you're against the establishment. It's wire against Trump.
[48:51.040 --> 48:53.040]  Silicon Valley's all in though.
[48:53.040 --> 49:00.040]  Meanwhile, billboard in Austin, Texas encourages illegal aliens to get a sugar daddy in the U.S.
[49:00.040 --> 49:06.040]  to not be deported and the U.N. plan for unlimited migration is promoted.
[49:06.040 --> 49:12.040]  Again, we're not against anybody, no matter where you're from in the world, but we can't sit here and pay for it all.
[49:12.040 --> 49:15.040]  We're going bankrupt as part of the program.
[49:15.040 --> 49:24.040]  Meanwhile, the video's coming up the next hour. Hillary breaks into bizarre laughter over her stamina.
[49:24.040 --> 49:28.040]  And Biden, a new video wants to kick Trump's ass.
[49:28.040 --> 49:33.040]  I wonder where the Secret Service is there responding to that.
[49:33.040 --> 49:41.040]  But I want to go to Mark and Matt and Josh and Chris and Todd and Al killer and Gary and everybody else here in just a moment.
[49:41.040 --> 49:44.040]  But I got to tell you something.
[49:44.040 --> 49:49.040]  It really is crazy to see how Americana Trump is.
[49:49.040 --> 49:54.040]  And to see how patriotic he's been.
[49:54.040 --> 49:57.040]  And to see all he's gone through.
[49:57.040 --> 50:03.040]  And to see the establishment media unified demonizing Trump.
[50:03.040 --> 50:10.040]  When when Hillary gets in the special interest and the control media have griefed skids to do whatever they want.
[50:10.040 --> 50:15.040]  And these people are known for robbing everyone.
[50:15.040 --> 50:19.040]  Frankly, I'm worried about a Trump presidency because the establishment will hit him with everything they've got.
[50:19.040 --> 50:25.040]  But what about a Hillary? I mean, doesn't everybody instinctively know she stole the election from Sanders?
[50:25.040 --> 50:32.040]  Don't they know she's out to get us and her own emails and WikiLeaks admit she wanted Obamacare to bankrupt the country.
[50:32.040 --> 50:36.040]  I mean, she wants us poor.
[50:36.040 --> 50:39.040]  She wants us under her control. She's a monster.
[50:39.040 --> 50:45.040]  So if we let them steal this election, we go along with this. We deserve what we're getting.
[50:45.040 --> 50:47.040]  15 days out for the election right now.
[50:47.040 --> 50:54.040]  15 days on info wars.com and prison planet.com are fighting it at the very tip of the spear.
[50:54.040 --> 50:58.040]  They're announcing web censorship. Internet censorship coming next year.
[50:58.040 --> 51:01.040]  They're already engaged in it. Incredible things are happening.
[51:01.040 --> 51:03.040]  They're trying to start wars.
[51:03.040 --> 51:08.040]  We have metal maniacs running things and we need to stand together and say no to this bottom line.
[51:08.040 --> 51:11.040]  All right, who should I go to first?
[51:11.040 --> 51:16.040]  There are a lot of colors. Who'd you say?
[51:16.040 --> 51:20.040]  Okay, Mark and Oregon, you're on the air. Mark, go ahead.
[51:20.040 --> 51:21.040]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[51:21.040 --> 51:22.040]  I'm all right.
[51:22.040 --> 51:29.040]  Alex, the way they're going to steal this election is by what they've already been doing and that is keeping the polls very close.
[51:29.040 --> 51:34.040]  So it'll be totally believable when they steal the election and the computerized voting.
[51:34.040 --> 51:39.040]  No, I totally agree. Trump and internal polls and their own polls have been five to 15 points ahead. It varies.
[51:39.040 --> 51:44.040]  And so they keep keeping them close to create that illusion. She has no crowds. She has no support.
[51:44.040 --> 51:48.040]  She has no small donations. She's a total hoax.
[51:48.040 --> 51:52.040]  The BuzzFeed poll actually pulled two and a half million people.
[51:52.040 --> 51:58.040]  And what they found was it's 70% for Trump, 30% for Clinton.
[51:58.040 --> 52:06.040]  But now, Alex, if Donald Trump, if you can get word to him somehow, if Donald Trump would set up his own independent polls,
[52:06.040 --> 52:11.040]  or hire pollsters who are bona fide and certified and honest to bring out the real numbers,
[52:11.040 --> 52:16.040]  I think this is the exact remedy to the way they're going to steal this election.
[52:16.040 --> 52:19.040]  I agree. I mean, look, look, I'm not saying the LA Times polls is perfect,
[52:19.040 --> 52:24.040]  but he's always been ahead in that at least five points, two to three, five, six, seven points.
[52:24.040 --> 52:29.040]  Look at this clip. I've seen two different focus groups on CNN where they go to the people to raise their hands
[52:29.040 --> 52:34.040]  and 10 raise their hands for Trump, five for Hillary, four or five for independence.
[52:34.040 --> 52:38.040]  It happened twice this weekend and they cut the feed when it happened.
[52:38.040 --> 52:42.040]  So since you mentioned that, here's a clip. Undecided voters weigh in on debate.
[52:42.040 --> 52:46.040]  The video is up on m4s.com. Here it is.
[52:46.040 --> 52:50.040]  Did this debate help any of you decide on a candidate?
[52:50.040 --> 52:56.040]  And if so, how many of you have decided now to vote for Hillary Clinton?
[52:56.040 --> 52:57.040]  Five?
[52:57.040 --> 53:03.040]  Five of you. Okay. How about, did this debate help you decide to vote for Donald Trump?
[53:03.040 --> 53:04.040]  Ten of you.
[53:04.040 --> 53:05.040]  That's your love.
[53:05.040 --> 53:12.040]  You're already. Gary Johnson or Jill Stein, did it make you want to vote for any of them or undecided?
[53:12.040 --> 53:15.040]  Okay, well, that's what I was going to ask you next. Who is still undecided here? How many?
[53:15.040 --> 53:19.040]  One, two, three, four, five, six of them still undecided.
[53:19.040 --> 53:23.040]  So they say it's 10 to five. It's actually 11 to five.
[53:23.040 --> 53:26.040]  So this happens over and over and over again, Mark.
[53:26.040 --> 53:32.040]  Alex, the only remedy to this is to have polls which are independent of the mass media
[53:32.040 --> 53:35.040]  that's also putting Hillary Clinton in the White House if they can.
[53:35.040 --> 53:37.040]  I can't think of anything else.
[53:37.040 --> 53:42.040]  You mean the mainstream media that's been caught lying on polls and caught taking questions from her
[53:42.040 --> 53:48.040]  and caught in WikiLeaks being run by her? You mean we should trust a fox to guard a henhouse?
[53:48.040 --> 53:52.040]  We trusted as much as we would rat poison in our dinner, Alex.
[53:52.040 --> 53:54.040]  They're out to put this monster in the White House.
[53:54.040 --> 53:59.040]  As I see it, Alex, the only way to stop them is to put out some legitimate polls out there.
[53:59.040 --> 54:03.040]  And Donald Trump has the resources to do this. I wish you'd pass it on to him
[54:03.040 --> 54:06.040]  because they're going to steal the election just as sure as possible.
[54:06.040 --> 54:12.040]  He's going to have poll watchers out everywhere, but great point. Great point, Mark and Oregon.
[54:12.040 --> 54:16.040]  She's going to get four to five Supreme Court justices in. This is the end of America.
[54:16.040 --> 54:19.040]  That's why they're planning to steal. That's why they don't care.
[54:19.040 --> 54:25.040]  She's wildly unpopular. They don't care because even though America gave the globalists the engine of all their power,
[54:25.040 --> 54:28.040]  they still want to mount its head on the wall.
[54:28.040 --> 54:31.040]  And so this is about being conquered. This is about being pissed on.
[54:31.040 --> 54:37.040]  They're doing it. Great point, Mark. Daryl in Oklahoma, you're on the air. Go ahead, Daryl.
[54:37.040 --> 54:40.040]  Thank you, Alex. I appreciate you having me on.
[54:40.040 --> 54:47.040]  Hey, real quick, I wanted to talk about this Evan McMullen, the independent presidential candidate who is being...
[54:47.040 --> 54:52.040]  Oh, yeah. Out of Utah being pushed by everybody to try to spoil things. Yeah.
[54:52.040 --> 54:59.040]  He's on the ballot in 11 states and his website says by election day that he'll be arriving in 31 more states.
[54:59.040 --> 55:03.040]  Yeah, that's MPR pushing him. Total Rockefeller Garbage.
[55:03.040 --> 55:07.040]  Yeah, but my thoughts about it are this.
[55:07.040 --> 55:15.040]  What if they use him as part of the voter fraud and say that he pulled some of the votes from Trump in certain states?
[55:15.040 --> 55:18.040]  That is exactly what they're doing. It's a total hoax.
[55:18.040 --> 55:26.040]  I've seen him on ABC News, MPR, New York Times, all the enemy publications are pushing him like this plausible reason this happened.
[55:26.040 --> 55:31.040]  And when he goes on shows, all he does is attack Trump. Total Hillary Shill.
[55:31.040 --> 55:33.040]  He's former CIA.
[55:33.040 --> 55:34.040]  I know. Oh, it's...
[55:34.040 --> 55:36.040]  Yeah, he worked for him. I mean, he's probably...
[55:36.040 --> 55:45.040]  I know, I know. Listen, listen. Half the movies that come out, whether it's with The Rock, or you name it, or this new movie about the neighbors or whatever.
[55:45.040 --> 55:50.040]  I saw it last night is how the CIA is wonderful. The CIA is foreign banks around the country.
[55:50.040 --> 55:55.040]  So they have all this PR publication. It's just absolutely totally sick.
[55:55.040 --> 56:05.040]  Yeah, it really is. And I want to ask all the listeners and all the Trump supporters to do one thing from now until the election is passed.
[56:05.040 --> 56:09.040]  If you don't have a Trump shirt, every day you can wear something red.
[56:09.040 --> 56:18.040]  And on election day, show up dressed in red if you don't have your Trump shirt. That way, when they pan the crowds and lines and they see all that red,
[56:18.040 --> 56:24.040]  they're going to show who to vote for before they go in. They don't have to walk up and ask everybody. It's going to be over.
[56:24.040 --> 56:32.040]  By the way, Darrell, I don't know who had this idea. Do you know who had the other red shirts?
[56:32.040 --> 56:33.040]  Do you know who had the idea, Darrell?
[56:33.040 --> 56:35.040]  No, no, no. I'm just suggesting myself.
[56:35.040 --> 56:39.040]  No, no, no, but I'm trying to give credit to whoever did it. I appreciate your call.
[56:39.040 --> 56:49.040]  What I'm saying is everybody for months has been saying, we're red, 15 days, 14 days now, when you're at the polling place so the news cameras can't ignore the power of it.
[56:49.040 --> 56:53.040]  I totally agree. I just don't know who came up with the idea. I want to give them credit.
[56:53.040 --> 56:58.040]  We are putting out a shirt. You can order right now, but it'll be too much four or five days.
[56:58.040 --> 57:07.040]  That is, Donald Trump is my president. Trump is my president and under it, you know, it says, you know, basically info wars.com legalized freedom on the back of the shirt.
[57:07.040 --> 57:19.040]  And we're doing that to spread the word and let folks know, hey, we're aware of what happened because whether it's a focus group or a poll, you name it, Trump's two to one ahead, but they keep claiming he's going to lose.
[57:19.040 --> 57:22.040]  So we have the shirt. Trump is my president.
[57:22.040 --> 57:31.040]  Hillary for president was a giant meme. That is a limited edition. It's about to end info wars store.com and the profit we make off this obviously funds this operation.
[57:31.040 --> 57:42.040]  So we do need your support info wars store.com or call toll free 888-253-3139. I'll be back tomorrow, by the way, 11am to 3pm on the weekday show.
[57:42.040 --> 57:52.040]  But a second hour is happening right now. Stay with us back in 70 seconds.

[59:25.040 --> 59:34.040]  In short, the major media is being covertly manipulated by well financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion in an unnatural direction that only serves establishment agendas.

[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:36.040]  We can put this up for TV viewers. I want to put it on screen. It's an image of Uma Abedin with Hillary Clinton. And then she's talking to her press secretary who we caught last week on tape.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:49.040]  Putting into his phone what the question should be and handing into a reporter. And I'm like we're really ruled by some weirdo Islamist woman who's a hypocrite who thinks lesbians should be executed executed her mother.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:01:00.040]  But then she's girlfriends reportedly with Hillary. And this this weird old deformed crone is ruling over us and all of us are cowards and we all bow down to it.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:09.040]  In what twisted dimension. Did we get to this point. Can we put that on screen. Trump Trump up to.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.040]  He's going to try to show it.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:17.040]  But that's the reality as a society of what we face.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:28.040]  We are ruled over by absolute scum because we have become a bunch of pacifists that just put up with the establishment line.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:37.040]  It's on screen now. Let's talk to Matt in Oklahoma. Matt you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.040]  Hey yeah I called the Florida.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:46.040]  It was division of elections and they were saying that after you vote you could show your ID.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:54.040]  To like see what exactly what your vote went to like which candidate and stuff like that. And that was something I never knew of.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:02:01.040]  The other thing is I was wondering to stop the still.org was still a good thing. I gave some money and yeah.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:06.040]  Roger Stone has got poll watchers nationwide. Go out and do it yourself. Shoot video. Put it on YouTube.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:11.040]  You know it's not about where you do it. It's the fact that you do do it.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.040]  You know YouTube Google get the information out.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.040]  Expose what's happening. That's what's going to scare them.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:22.040]  There now came out in Reuters on Friday and said you're a Russian agent if you allege voter fraud.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:28.040]  So you catch people going polling place polling place voting. It's not that you're an American exposing fraud. You're a Ruski.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:31.040]  Well the good news is nobody's going to buy that.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:39.040]  Yeah it's like don't question authority. Why do we have to gain from cheating you and it's like really. Yeah.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:45.040]  Well all I want to say is Trump is way ahead major polls. They're going to try to steal it from him. They're panicking.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.040]  What is your gut tell you is going to happen.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:57.040]  Yeah basically I guess we're just going to have to prove it. You know I guess I mean yeah we're just going to have you to prove it.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:03.040]  And I think we need to think ahead be proactive and not just wait till something happens and whatnot.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:09.040]  But yeah thanks for that and just let people know maybe if there's ways they can find out if you want to get to another call.
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.040]  I really appreciate it man.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.040]  I appreciate it brother. Thank you man.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:23.040]  Here's my question to listeners and viewers especially Democrats. Is there any level of corruption Hillary couldn't stoop to that you wouldn't accept.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:28.040]  Because I hate the Republican Party. I love the fact that Trump's an insurrectionist taking it over.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:36.040]  Is there any level you wouldn't stoop to to feel like you're part of the power structure and.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.040]  Why are you signing on to Hillary.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.040]  Why do you think she supports you when she doesn't.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:49.040]  She's all about betraying her constituents. She has no code of honor or ethics.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:53.040]  We got Josh and we got Chris and we got a bunch of other folks I'm going to go to.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:04:03.040]  The toll free number when we come back is 877-789 Alex 877-789 Alex but I really just want to ask her supporters.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:11.040]  Is there any level you wouldn't accept because you believe you're part of her power structure.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:18.040]  I want to talk to Bernie supporters. I mean why do you support her when she clearly stole the nominations from him.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:27.040]  I'd love to hear you call in and school me how Hillary working for all the big banks all the big establishment corporations all the big money is good.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:34.040]  And you claim your anti establishment. Big question. Very easy question to answer.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:40.040]  The phones are open. We don't screen your calls. I want to hear from you to defend this.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.040]  Listen I'm smart. I'm going to be okay either way.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.040]  Man the general public is going to get really hurt by this lady.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:52.040]  And she says she's coming out of the free press. She says she wants to launch all these wars.
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:57.040]  Is that something you really support. Infowars.com
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:29.040]  That could help safeguard your money in an economic meltdown. I'm talking real money not paper or worthless stocks.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:34.040]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold proving that gold is on the move.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:40.040]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting finances.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:48.040]  Don't delay call 844-541 Alex now and get a rugged double locked bank bag to securely store your coins absolutely free.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:53.040]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:06:00.040]  I personally owe me survival packs and you should too. Pick up the phone and call 844-541 Alex now.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:11.040]  Residence to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:15.040]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:20.040]  Hillary Clinton is manifestly a murdering horrible kingpin.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:27.040]  This launched endlessly legal wars helped pass the laws that gave us the derivatives, the banking scams.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:31.040]  She's coming after our guns in her own WikiLeaks memo.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:36.040]  She says she was to give us dumb and bankrupt and stupid.
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:39.040]  And so if we go along with that, that's our fault.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:44.040]  If you've heard this information, if you looked it up and found out that's true, what you could do in five seconds.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:47.040]  Just type in WikiLeaks, keep the public dominant in the dark.
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:53.040]  Then why would you support your own demise because you're too big a coward to face up to it.
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:07:05.040]  Cowards cuddle up. They cozy up to tyranny, to tyranny, to oppression, to domination, to control.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:09.040]  Because they believe it gives them power over it to submit to it.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.040]  That is a delusion.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:16.040]  You give in to tyranny, you give into oppression, it's because you've rolled over.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:24.040]  And Hillary is a monstrous creature with all these hordes of evil people behind her believing they've got a limited power.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:31.040]  But meanwhile, across the world, countries that were once under our control through peaceful means are turning against us
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.040]  because America is now known as an agent of evil.
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.040]  We've lost our soft power.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:44.040]  God help us when the dollar devalues George Soros admittedly that runs Hillary has tried to devalue the pound and the dollar for 40 years.
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:49.040]  He's tried to bring us down in a pissing contest to mount our head on the wall.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:52.040]  And we're so close to falling right now.
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:59.040]  And he finances all the leftist groups who sit there and lick their lips and can't wait till their bank accounts are worthless.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:05.040]  My God, the way they take these people with Stockholm syndrome and turn them into their own servants,
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:11.040]  their own agents of demise makes my head spin.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:16.040]  We've got a bunch of loaded phone callers here.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:24.040]  Let's talk to Josh in Montana. You're on the air, Josh.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.040]  How are you?
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:27.040]  I'm all right. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.040]  I understand.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:36.040]  Listen, man, I want to say God bless you and your crew. And the question that I have for you today is,
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:44.040]  after knowing these globalist playbooks that you have dissected countless times,
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:59.040]  what can they do or have they done that totally shocks you that you cannot foresee happening?
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:10.040]  What has happened that just totally blows your mind from someone who understands the playbook itself? Please go.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:15.040]  That's a really great question, Josh. I want to ask you what shocks you in a moment.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:23.040]  But first off, it shocks me that they don't understand that what they do to the general public ends up blowing back on them.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:29.040]  And they have such venom towards humanity that that's what shocks me over and over again.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:35.040]  The depths to which they will go out of their way, even if it would help them to do good,
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:40.040]  they'll go out of their way to do bad because that's their nature.
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:47.040]  I think the genetic engineering, the cross animal human hybrids, just the abominable things they do,
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:55.040]  I think that's what shocks me is that they go out of their way to do things that even hurt them and their families
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.040]  because they're so committed to evil and anti-human behavior.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:09.040]  You know, why is that their nature? And sort of going off of your Ms. Abedine rant there just for a moment,
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:16.040]  I don't know if you've got a chance to catch the Showtime interview that was aired, I believe yesterday,
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.040]  with the entire Anthony Wiener debacle.
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:25.040]  No, I know. She was married to Wiener. Wiener's wife is Hillary Clinton's concubine.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:35.040]  Jones, as I can tell you, in that documentary itself, it said clearly that Hillary Clinton gave her a choice.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:42.040]  Either A, leave him, or B, join her future run for presidential candidate.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:47.040]  I mean that was aired and it almost blew my mind. I could not believe that.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.040]  Well, part of evil is they throw it in our face.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:57.040]  They just hammer us in our face that all these crooked, hunchback, weird, demonic, ugly people rule over us.
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.040]  This is about ugly, bad people ruling good. That's what...
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:07.040]  You know, what's in their nature to ultimately self-destruct?
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:14.040]  Well, when you're a hunchback bug-eyed demon like Hillary Clinton that smells like a dead body since you're a kid,
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.040]  all you want to do is screw everybody and burn the country down.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:22.040]  These are sloths. These are stinkers. These are demons. These are pig creatures.
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:28.040]  You just have to understand, they are fallen. This is their nature. This is the paradigm they build.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:32.040]  They're dung beetles. I think you've answered your own questions, my friend.
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.040]  I've fallen, honestly. They have doubled down.
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.040]  Oh, they wanted to blow the planet up.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:43.040]  But listen, they get off at night thinking about nuclear war and everybody dying, okay?
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:48.040]  And as soon as they're old enough and they're in control of nuclear weapons, they come into Hillary and say,
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:53.040]  you're dying of a brain tumor, well, she is dying of a brain tumor. She'll launch the nuclear weapons.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:12:01.040]  She wants to kill the entire planet. And people make jokes about that, but she wants to kill everybody as part of a tombstone to her.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:08.040]  It's all about her power. And the Liberals would love to kill their families and burn the whole planet up if they could do it for Hillary.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:12.040]  They want... They want the planet to be her tombstone, brother.
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.040]  Let's be real on a humanistic level.
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:16.040]  I'm serious. Why do you...
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.040]  Why not blow the planet up for Hillary? Are you against feminists?
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:22.040]  Why not kill every man, woman, and child on the earth for her?
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:27.040]  They said communists attacked the local cat sanctuary that saves abandoned cats in Austin.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:33.040]  They tried to blow it up, basically, and, you know, attacked it because they said, don't take care of cats.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:39.040]  That's baby boomer, piece of crap. You know, liberalism. You understand, sir? These people want death.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.040]  Okay, now you sound like a racist.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:45.040]  No, no, no. I mean, serious. It was in the paper yesterday. I couldn't believe it.
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:51.040]  They have a thing called the Cat Cafe where you go buy coffee and donuts and pay for homeless cats.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.040]  We've actually gone there and donated to help homeless cats.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:57.040]  I mean, I don't want to brag that I'm that weird, but that's the kind of stuff I do.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:01.040]  I like cats. I like dogs. I've given over $1,000 to Cat Cafe.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:08.040]  They had communists put super glue on the locks, you know, spray paint it, knock the windows out, come and protest it.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:13.040]  And the paper actually said, no, this is evil. This is a neighborhood thing that helps things.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:19.040]  This is bad. The communists are correct. We cannot take care of cats because they don't want love in the world, sir.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:23.040]  They want death. They want destruction. They want hate. They want red sickles.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:35.040]  So this is evil manifest. So this Trump presidency is not only a question of American forwardment.
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:41.040]  Not America. Exactly. Trump isn't perfect, but he's not suicidal and he isn't out to rob you and your family.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:44.040]  He wants you to have prosperity. Trump is not out to get you.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:48.040]  But I mean, I cannot make up how nasty these people are, okay?
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:52.040]  They want poverty. They want you broke. They want you unhappy. They're demons.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.040]  I completely agree.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:57.040]  Communists, sir. I'm not lying. Google it. This sounds crazy.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:02.040]  Attack the Cat Cafe that takes care of abandoned cats two days ago, okay?
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.040]  The communists are so hardcore that they were drawn towards someone taking care of something innocent.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:14.040]  Just like the communists attacked me, the same communists protesting an abortion worry of, you know, last year.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:20.040]  The same people showed up to say, don't take care of cats. Euthanize them because they just don't want people loving.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:27.040]  You understand? Whether it's a cat or a baby, it doesn't matter. You understand their spirit? These people are literally demons.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:31.040]  I do. And the same message that brought your producer to tears.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:40.040]  Honestly, I got to tell you, I really wish that Trump had been doubling down on this message that he's been given the past few days.
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:49.040]  The past few days, I've heard more clear, honest intention from Trump than I've heard his entire candidacy.
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:53.040]  That's because he's not listening to anybody but himself now. Let me show you.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:58.040]  A year after Jumpling Shop was raised, Vandals damaged Blue Cat Cafe.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:04.040]  And then it goes on. Austin, America statesman, the cat sanctuary attacked by communists.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.040]  I mean, you cannot make up how evil they are. Okay?
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:16.040]  I get it. I totally get that. Now, okay, for your listeners, at this critical moment in time where the debates are done,
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:28.040]  the public opinion is starting to form a biased opinion towards Trump. What do the supporters need to do to make sure that this...
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:34.040]  I mean, I think you say to liberals, I mean, the entire big banking structure and all the bad guys are supporting Hillary.
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.040]  How the hell could you not support Trump?
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:39.040]  I completely concur.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:44.040]  Let me tell you about Trump. His own people can't stand him. He is his own guy.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:49.040]  That's why the elite hate him. He really is his own guy. He means well. He is a loose cannon.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:16:15.040]  But I'll take a loose cannon over pure evil any day. I mean, we have communists, folks, attacking animal sanctuaries in Austin. Okay?
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:25.040]  We use milk thistle, folvic acid, orange peel, zeolites and others. Deep cleanse doesn't hold back.

[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:14.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.040]  Long way to the top.
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:20.040]  You want to be in a free country.
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:30.040]  Live from the infowarsteam.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:35.040]  By the way, I'm not mad at Project Veritas. They're amazing.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:39.040]  But Friday, Rob Duke comes in and goes, the feds are after them. They're like coming after them.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:43.040]  Horrible stuff's happening. They want to come on. They're in an emergency.
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:47.040]  They think that James O'Keeffe's in danger. Well, where's James O'Keeffe?
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:52.040]  Well, he's in the air right now. They were wanting to give us an exclusive on Monday with this new big video.
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:58.040]  Their last stuff totally dominated and was Democratic top operatives admitting election fraud,
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:01.040]  admitting that they're busing people in and stealing elections.
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.040]  So I'm like, okay, great. Do I announce it? He goes, oh, no, I talked to him.
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:06.040]  Announce they're coming on sometime today.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:12.040]  So then I go on here and I say, okay, James O'Keeffe's coming on with this big giant announcement and they're after him.
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:16.040]  And I hear, well, it's going to be one of his backup people. He's showing the air. We're not sure now.
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:20.040]  And then now they've been threatened more and a bunch of crazy stuff's going on.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:23.040]  And I'm not going to get into stuff I've been told.
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:26.040]  And then I get her today and I'm like, okay, I'm ready to have them on and talk about what happened to him.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:31.040]  Well, they want to come on and just talk about their stories, not what's currently happening.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:36.040]  And I said, no, I said, I want to tell the listeners what happened to him or I want to be told what's going on
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:40.040]  because I don't want you to sit here and say, oh my God, they're under attack and then just forget it.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:46.040]  Okay, so I love James O'Keeffe. I love the work you're doing. He's incredible. He's the gold standard.
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.040]  We're going to find out in the next few days what's going on, but make no mistake.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:53.040]  We get attacked. They get attacked. They're amazing. I'm not blaming them for being all flustered.
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:58.040]  They've never called me. I've known them like seven, eight years or longer than that.
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:04.040]  They've never acted like this. They're not drama queens. This is so bad. Whatever's going on, they won't tell us.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:07.040]  And they're all freaked out running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:14.040]  So I've got James cell. I've called it. I've got their other numbers and I'm just getting the run around.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:21.040]  So I guess they're ready to come on. I mean, I could have his number two on and just interrogate him on here,
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:26.040]  but I'm not going to do that. I told him, try to find out, talk to him, say, what's going on?
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:29.040]  What do they want to cover? Can they tell us what's happening? They don't have them on.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:34.040]  Because again, I keep just relaying to my people, ask them that and they go, well, we're not going to talk about it.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:39.040]  Okay. Well, I don't know what's going on then. I just, all I can do is just say what's happening.
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:45.040]  I can't sit here and just leave it all open or talk about what they did.
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:53.040]  I mean, I've got all these videos where they have top Democrats admitting total election fraud, just bombshell, gold standard information.
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:57.040]  We've played it. We've talked about it. My God, I've said donate to them. What else can I do?
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:02.040]  They're under attack. They're totally freaked out. I'm not supposed to tell you what they've told me.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:09.040]  So I'm sitting here. I'm not going to hear this stuff and then sit here and have a regular interview about your content.
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:17.040]  Just not happening. It's not happening because I'm too freaked out about the press in this country and where it's under attack.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:23.040]  That's the big issue. We know Hillary's a crook. My God, you know, I'll be honest. I'm going to be honest.
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:30.040]  I come ashamed of this country. Okay. We have seen persecutions of the press that we don't see in China.
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:38.040]  We have seen evil. We have seen triplicate WikiLeaks of them saying keep the public dumb, keep them the dark, rip them off, make them poor.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:47.040]  That pisses me off. Nothing pisses me off more than trying to make people poor.
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:54.040]  That fundamentally gets me in a fighting mood and we have it from WikiLeaks. We have it from the emails.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:24:04.040]  We have it from Veritas. We have it up one side and down the other. It's like God is giving us every chance we've got to say no to this.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:14.040]  And we're not saying no. You know, I went to Google Trends this weekend because I was told one of our videos was like number six and it was like election fraud or something.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:25.040]  It was like number six, but everything above it and below it, like 30 deep and five up was this college team and that college team and this NFL team and that NFL team.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:39.040]  And it's not that I'm against an NFL team, but man, when they're getting ready to point five Supreme Court justices, when they're coming after the guns, when they're coming after your families, when we defeat the globalists, we can watch some football games.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:49.040]  Okay. But not when the whole country is being fed feet first into a GD wood chipper.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:25:04.040]  So that's where I stand. And I'm not bitching. I'm not on some high horse. It's just, I can't tell you how many times somebody I know gets beat up, gets audited, gets assaulted and they go, I can't talk about it.
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:20.040]  They'll get me more. I'm just like, that's why they're winning. That's why they're winning. You tell me all the stuff that happens to you and then I can't go in the air and tell people it pisses me off because I've already been through it.
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:32.040]  I understand it. The way you get out of it is admitting it and shooting up the bat signal to the American people that you're under attack. You do not beat this by rolling over to it.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:42.040]  So I have to sit here on air knowing the stuff I know and just act all normal and act all cool because people tell me stuff in confidence and I have to sit here and don't talk about it and it pisses me off.
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:52.040]  Makes me really angry because I'm sick of being run by crooks and I can't believe my fellow countrymen and women put up with this level BS.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:26:10.040]  I mean, I look at Hillary Clinton and I'm like, what a joke. What a frickin' archetypal joke running our lives, screwing us over on video, admitting she wants to eff us and our families, admitting she wants to make us poor, admitting she wants to have all this bad will against us.
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:28.040]  Like, what is this creepazoid, freakazoid grand asshole? I mean, I'm sorry, but sometimes French is only the words I've got. What is this witch and her flying monkeys doing running my life?
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:34.040]  Why do we put up with this? And then I ask, maybe we're worse than her. Maybe that's it.
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:44.040]  And then maybe I should just sorenara and just shut this down because I don't say that for effect. I mean, every day I just sit here because I'm willing to face them down to death.
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:27:00.040]  I'm willing to do anything to fight these people, but I sit here and I go, why am I doing this when the public doesn't give a damn about their birthright and everything being stolen right in front of them and the screwing over of people and the lying and the cheating and the sick offense?
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:09.040]  Because that's what gets to me. I'm going to be honest with you. I mean, if we were dealing with enemies that were like 14 foot tall, 14 foot tall, really bad ass, I could deal with this.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:26.040]  We've been conquered by a bunch of hunchback, weak, ugly, bug-eyed pieces of filth. And that's what gets to me is that we're conquered by a bunch of trash that thinks it's better than us because it's willing to piss on everybody and screw everybody over.
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:38.040]  That's what really fundamentally gets to me at the end of the day. And then you get somebody like Donald Trump who's so prideful and so manly and so good that he wants to compete in the real world and dominate.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:45.040]  He doesn't want to make people poor. He doesn't want to piss down your back. He doesn't want to dominate you. He doesn't want to sell you out.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:28:00.040]  And you're so bound to slavery and so beat up and so, so, so trashy. I don't mean you the listeners, but you know who I'm talking about, that you reject a God sent gift.
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:15.040]  And then I sit back and I go, well, then these people don't deserve support. Do you know what's scary? The dumbasses that go along with this are so stupid, they won't even know they've lost when they've lost.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:30.040]  And then I realized why I do what I do. There are good people spotted through this German, Chinese, Jewish, Christian, Latin American, I don't care, knew it, who don't want to be slaves and who love God and love freedom.
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:39.040]  And they don't know what's going on. And so they're just trying to be good people. You know what? That's why I'm going to fight evil because I will lose my soul if I don't face this down.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:49.040]  And so it doesn't matter if most of you don't listen. This isn't for you. This broadcast is for those that hear the truth and who want freedom. And you've got to commit it for me.
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:29:11.040]  I'm never giving up. I'm never giving in. I'm never backing out. I'm 110% in.
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:29.040]  In the history of M4's life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality and so many others.
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:38.040]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:52.040]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products. The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard. That means it's clean. That means it's pure.
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:58.040]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion. Take action now before we sell out.
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:08.040]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war. A 360 win.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:22.040]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarsore.com. Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:34.040]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50. Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:41.040]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:58.040]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com, this is a sure win. 10% off on auto ship. Win, win, win at infowarslife.com. Free shipping on orders above $50. And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:02.040]  There was a mighty nation blessed above all of Korea.
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:11.040]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America, he's always defended the Second Amendment.
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:18.040]  Let me just read a little thing here from the agenda 21, the American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world. Individual rights will have to take a backseat to the collective.
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:22.040]  Well, you know what the next move is going to be, don't you? It's going to be coming after you're done.
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.040]  Oh yeah.
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:27.040]  I take it ain't going to sit well down my way. At all. It ain't going to sit well.
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.040]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:32.040]  It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand paul reviewers.
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:38.040]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.040]  And beef was for supper.
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:47.040]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:51.040]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, special ops general Jerry Boykin.
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:55.040]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue?
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:58.040]  Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:01.040]  Brain Force, it's completely different. Try a bottle of it.
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:06.040]  Rob Doe joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:07.040]  Tell us what Brain Force did.
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:10.040]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:14.040]  I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down.
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.040]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.040]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.040]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there. I popped two of them.
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:25.040]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, everything just kind of clears up.
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:28.040]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it.
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:32.040]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:37.040]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:39.040]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.040]  but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:45.040]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep,
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:48.040]  got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:53.040]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:57.040]  or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:27.040]  So, I'll be honest with people.
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:30.040]  I was brought up a Christian, didn't like establishment churches,
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:33.040]  but the older I get, I see God's plan.
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:36.040]  And if you show the Bible, it says that God will always show you
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:41.040]  what's really going on before you're judged to give you a chance to turn back.
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:46.040]  And you've got what's crazy is, because I have a good memory, a decent memory,
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:49.040]  and it's probably being pointed out by the press, not just us.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:55.040]  They'll have WikiLeaks two months ago with Hillary sending protesters,
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:58.040]  dressed up as Bernie Sanders supporters to attack Trump supporters.
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:02.040]  That way she can demonize Trump supporters and Sanders supporters.
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:07.040]  And then now you've got the witnesses coming out and the videos coming up.
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:12.040]  So, what's crazy is, we don't just have WikiLeaks,
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:16.040]  we have the videos of it happening and then the people that were involved
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:19.040]  admitting they were involved, and then prosecutors coming out
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:22.040]  and pointing out what's going on, it's wild.
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:25.040]  We have the emails, then we have the video of it happening.
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:28.040]  I've got to tell you, you know, the Chicago police tell you,
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:31.040]  yeah, Alex, yesterday, they had people hired, they bust in,
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:34.040]  they attacked our officers, they were brought in by MoveOn.org,
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:37.040]  and George Soros and Media Matters and the blah, blah, blah.
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:40.040]  And then three months later, four months later, it's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.040]  You're like, whoa.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:45.040]  I mean, I've got to be honest, police got problems
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:47.040]  I speak out against them when they do bad stuff,
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:50.040]  but we've never been given bad info about the cops.
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:52.040]  It's kind of an sickening.
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:56.040]  I mean, it's like, wow, I've never gotten such intel the last few years.
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:59.040]  It's like, on, on, on, on, on, on, on.
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:02.040]  It's like Roger Stone, all he gives us is good info,
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.040]  because he gets bad info one time, it's kind of like us.
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.040]  People don't listen anymore.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:12.040]  And I'm not in an ass-kicking contest or ass-kissing contest with the police.
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:17.040]  It's just that they got their own problems, but they're not out to get the country.
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:19.040]  That's what I'm saying about Trump.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:21.040]  This is an outside globalist takedown, folks.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:25.040]  We can have our differences on race and religion and where we live or whatever.
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:26.040]  I get it.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:30.040]  There's real beefs, but this is a takedown of the country, folks.
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:33.040]  This is world government.
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:40.040]  And you've got George Soros, this master demon, a real Nazi collaborator,
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:44.040]  a real guy that wants to implode our economy, involved in so much of this.
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.040]  I'm not trying to single him out.
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:48.040]  He brags each time he's behind it.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:51.040]  He's so arrogant.
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:52.040]  I've got three clips.
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:56.040]  Hillary, violent operatives, unmasked on video at the scene of the crime.
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:58.040]  Because they're demonizing James O'Keeffe,
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:02.040]  because they gave him a trespassing charge for exposing government corruption once big deal.
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:04.040]  The guy that serves the Congressional Medal of Honor,
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:09.040]  and then they sit there and go through these pieces like he is exposing things that don't exist.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:11.040]  He's admitted this is happening.
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.040]  Here's the first clip.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.040]  You know, I know nothing about this.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:18.040]  I'm not, you know, I can't go to conspiracy theories.
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.040]  Oh, yeah.
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.040]  First, let's look at a couple emails.
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:23.040]  Remember Zulema Rodriguez?
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:26.040]  Here she is bragging about shutting down the Trump rally in Chicago,
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:29.040]  where people, including police officers, were hurt.
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:35.040]  So, me and I did the Chicago Trump event when we shut down the light bulb.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.040]  Yeah.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:43.040]  One thing that stands out is she claims to speak to Hillary's campaign and the DNC every day at one o'clock.
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:47.040]  I just had a call with the campaign and the DNC.
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:49.040]  Every day at one o'clock.
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:55.040]  Now let's go to WikiLeaks and take a look at an email found in the batch of leaked DNC emails.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:57.040]  This one from May 2016.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:01.040]  Here we find an email sent by Robert Cramer, who is featured in both videos,
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:08.040]  to another DNC worker, reminding her about the one o'clock Trump rapid response phone call that must be made,
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:12.040]  discussing an upcoming Trump and Pence rally.
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:16.040]  This matches the activities he described in the hidden camera footage.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:23.040]  But it doesn't stop there.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:28.040]  Digging into the elections commission payroll records online, which is not leaked information,
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:33.040]  but material that is openly available, we find payments made to Zulema Rodriguez,
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:38.040]  directly by Hillary's campaign, right around the time of the Chicago riots.
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:44.040]  This shatters the big media lie that these people are not directly involved or controlled by Hillary's campaign.
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:50.040]  Bob Cramer, who sent the email discussing the calls and resigned after this video came out,
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:54.040]  met with Obama regularly and has visited the White House hundreds of times,
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:58.040]  which is verifiable through the White House visitor logs.
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:00.040]  And now the cherry on top.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:05.040]  Here we have footage of Zulema at the Chicago rally that was shut down due to violence,
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:08.040]  clearly working very hard for $1,500.
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:12.040]  And then more footage in Arizona where protesters shut down the highway,
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.040]  as she also boasted about in the video.
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:19.040]  Here it appears she's faking a medical emergency for the cameras.
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:22.040]  Now, remember in March we had the police sources were on tape.
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:28.040]  We played it last week saying move on.org George Soros because we have from the Chicago police
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:31.040]  who got hit upside the head with crowbars bottles.
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:36.040]  One guy as job broken, literally jaw surgery.
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:39.040]  I mean, what are we supposed to put up with this country?
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:45.040]  Hit upside the head by crowbars by some fricking Nazi collaborating bastard.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:49.040]  And it's all confirmed the money, everything we haven't tripled at the emails,
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:52.040]  the federal funding, the FBI files, it all connects.
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:54.040]  Let's go to the next clip.
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.040]  Let me tell you, you break my jaw. I'm coming after you, man.
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.040]  I'm not putting up with this crap.
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:00.040]  Where is the Chicago PD putting up with this?
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:04.040]  Where are you putting up with one breaking your jaw of an officer?
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:07.040]  If a normal citizen did that, it'd be attempted murder charges.
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:09.040]  It should be.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:13.040]  And again, if those were just regular citizens, I would call for charges,
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:16.040]  but wouldn't be so upset. It's foreign globalist.
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:19.040]  Stand up against an attack against our country.
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:22.040]  This is like the maximum level here.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:27.040]  This pisses me off so bad that I can barely do this show anymore
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.040]  because it's so obvious that fricking Hillary Clinton, man,
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:33.040]  and a goddamn George Soros.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:38.040]  Excuse me. I don't mean to talk like that, but I am fed up.
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:40.040]  Here's the second clip. Here it is.
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:42.040]  Now, another very interesting email.
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:46.040]  This conversation between various DNC workers on May 10th
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:49.040]  discusses phrases in language they intend to put on signs
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:52.040]  to maximize outrage among Trump supporters,
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:57.040]  like GOP plus Trump, dangerous, divisive, and deceitful.
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:00.040]  And once again, Mr. Creamer makes an appearance,
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:03.040]  and they discuss the fact that they have been speaking to him
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:06.040]  about planning an incident at an upcoming Trump event.
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:11.040]  Now, let's go to a clip posted by CNN just a day after this conversation.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:14.040]  Pay attention to the signs in the background.
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:21.040]  If that wasn't enough, see if you can spot someone who looks familiar here.
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:25.040]  Does anybody recognize him? Let me jog your memory.
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:28.040]  There he is. There he is. There he is.
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:33.040]  So what was going on for the past hour was a very, very limited meeting.
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:36.040]  So I'm basically deputy rapid response director.
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:37.040]  Aaron Black.
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:39.040]  DNC for all things Trump on the ground.
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:41.040]  This guy is Aaron Black.
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:44.040]  He works full-time for Creamer at Democracy Parkers.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:49.040]  He directs the spontaneous protests at Trump and Pence events.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:53.040]  There's also an article from six months ago published by ABC News
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:56.040]  that at the time had no hard evidence behind it,
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:59.040]  where somebody speaks out about being hired to incite violence
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:02.040]  at a Trump rally responding to an ad on Craigslist.
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:06.040]  It's just another piece to put on the growing pile of evidence
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:11.040]  that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC are in fact tampering with the election.
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:14.040]  Now that the pieces of the puzzle are falling into place,
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:18.040]  there's no reason why this story should not be the number one story in America right now.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:23.040]  The narrative that Project Veritas is producing misleading out-of-context
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:26.040]  and edited footage is blatantly proven false.
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:27.040]  That's right.
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.040]  And that is the idea the media and the White House are pushing.
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:32.040]  They've gotten the federal elections commission numbers.
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:34.040]  They've done their own Wiki links.
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.040]  They've cross-reverenced it all. These videos are powerful.
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:39.040]  Proof Project Veritas is right.
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:42.040]  I'm going to put an article out tonight and a video showing all of this,
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.040]  but this is amazing.
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:47.040]  That's what makes me so angry is that they're really persecuting Veritas right now.
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:51.040]  They don't know how to respond to it, but we'll be covering it obviously tomorrow.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.040]  They're ready to come on the day,
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:55.040]  but I want them to just say what's happening to them or I'm not doing it.
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:57.040]  That's just where I stand right now because they need to just go ahead
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.040]  and talk about what's happening to them.
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:02.040]  Now, speaking of supporting a broadcast,
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:05.040]  we're going to come back and play some more clips and go to your phone calls
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:08.040]  with a prosecutor talking about how criminal Hillary is and what they're doing.
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:11.040]  But before I go any further, we've got brain force, incredible,
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:17.040]  new tropic, just known supplements, herbs that boost brain function normally
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:19.040]  and actually with God's own herbs.

[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:33.040]  Living Defense.
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:35.040]  Parasite Cleanze is back in.
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:37.040]  Amazing herbs will flush out your body.
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:40.040]  This is sold out routinely because it's so hard to keep in stock.
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:42.040]  infowarslife.com, Living Defense.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:46.040]  Now, back in the last run ever of Hillary for Prison Shirts.
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:48.040]  When these are sold out, they're sold out.
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:51.040]  It's our third and final round of Hillary for Prison Shirts
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:53.040]  and your funding supports this broadcast.
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:55.040]  infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:43:23.040]  We'll be back on all the shows.
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:26.040]  Number four, Mexico also has restrictive gun laws
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:27.040]  just like Chicago.
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:30.040]  Yet over 160,000 people have been murdered in the country's drug war
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:32.040]  since 2007.
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:34.040]  The only people who are actually stopping the Mexican cartels
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:37.040]  are private citizens who are openly defying Mexico's gun laws
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:39.040]  to form self-defense militias.
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:42.040]  Number five, President Obama has been arming and funding
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:45.040]  ISIS-linked Syrian rebels for quite some time.
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:47.040]  In fact, Obama approved the re-arming of the so-called
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:49.040]  moderate rebels on October 1st.
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:52.040]  The same day he called for gun control in response to the
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:54.040]  community college shooting up in Oregon.
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:57.040]  You can find out more at infowars.com to get Daniels reporting.
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:01.040]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:04.040]  nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:07.040]  Dr. Group, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:10.040]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex,
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:13.040]  because I think it's very, very important.
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:16.040]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates,
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:19.040]  we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:22.040]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:24.040]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:28.040]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:31.040]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:33.040]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:36.040]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:39.040]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:40.040]  It's in powder form.
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.040]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.040]  I take this. This is the product that I take.

[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:53.040]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how young Jebedee and the products
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:55.040]  at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.040]  Check it out for yourself today.
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:00.040]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:01.040]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:02.040]  Why is this so good?
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:08.040]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:13.040]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:20.040]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:25.040]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:28.040]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:29.040]  These are all parasites.
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:30.040]  Tell us about all the stuff I said.
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:32.040]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:33.040]  You have the neem in there.
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:36.040]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:39.040]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.040]  All right.
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:42.040]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:45.040]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:46.040]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:49.040]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:52.040]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslives.com.
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:54.040]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:47:22.040]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:31.040]  I'm always honest with you.
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:34.040]  I'm honest with myself for how he did.
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:38.040]  We're in deep trouble, but we're devastating the enemy.
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:41.040]  Humanity is awakening in such a big way.
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:45.040]  And if they try to steal this election, what you're currently doing,
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:47.040]  it's going to blow up in their face even bigger.
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:49.040]  We don't need to be violent.
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:50.040]  That's a whole other show.
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:51.040]  I'm going to talk about tomorrow.
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:53.040]  What happens if they steal the election?
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:56.040]  Because Trump's way ahead, we're trying to say how dare him question an election
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:58.040]  when all the Democrats do his question elections.
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:01.040]  It's such an incredible time to be alive right now.
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:04.040]  I'm going to go to a few more of your phone calls here on the time we have left.
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:08.040]  But we have a former federal prosecutor, Joe DiGenova,
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:13.040]  believes the recent project we're a tough video about James O'Kee featuring DFC contractors
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:17.040]  exploiting their dirty practices to foment violence at Trump rallies
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:22.040]  is a prima facie or on its face case for federal and state criminal activity.
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:24.040]  It's racketeering.
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:25.040]  It's organized crime.
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:26.040]  It's intimidation.
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:30.040]  It's the Ku Klux Klan attacking blacks to try to vote.
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:33.040]  It is textbook, so here's the clip.
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:37.040]  What's really fascinating about the James O'Kee's video,
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:42.040]  which has the two people discussing how they are going to cause disruptions
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:46.040]  at Trump rallies and try to get the media to blame Trump,
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:50.040]  this was an official action of the Democratic Party through its surrogates
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:54.040]  to publicly disrupt the activities of the Republican Party.
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:56.040]  Certified racketeering, organized crime.
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:01.040]  I happen to believe that since they were inciting violence that they committed crimes
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:04.040]  and I believe that there were both state and federal crimes.
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:06.040]  First of all, they were interfering with the federal election.
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:07.040]  No doubt.
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:11.040]  I think, and they were purposely trying to create violence, I think on its face.
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:14.040]  Notice when we did this, we said don't disrupt.
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:20.040]  I think there should be federal investigations and state investigations
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:22.040]  of all the people on those videos.
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:26.040]  They should subpoena all of their records of payment, who was involved, how it was known.
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:29.040]  I'm not holding my breath given this United States Justice Department,
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:32.040]  which is the most political and politically corrupt in history.
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:36.040]  But anybody with an ounce of brains will see that this was not just,
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:41.040]  this was not Dick Tuck doing a prank on a train,
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:45.040]  you know, putting alcohol in somebody's drink instead of water.
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:48.040]  This was somebody trying to injure people.
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.040]  Trying to create violence where...
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:52.040]  Yeah, they said go and start a riot.
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:54.040] ...injured property might be destroyed.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.040]  These are crimes and it needs to be dealt with that way.
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:01.040]  That tape is absolutely prima facie evidence of criminal activity.
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:02.040]  On its face.
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:03.040]  It needs to be investigated.
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:06.040]  And I haven't heard a peep out of the United States Justice Department.
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:11.040]  They continue to embarrass me as a former United States Attorney and a former Senior Justice Department official.
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:16.040]  I'm embarrassed by Loretta Lynch and her conduct of the business of the Department of Justice.
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:19.040]  And of course, very embarrassed by the director of the FBI.
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:22.040]  He still has FBI agents all over this right now.
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:27.040]  But of course, he's too busy explaining why he didn't investigate Hillary.
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:31.040]  I don't know what James O'Keefe's next video is that's coming out,
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:35.040]  but I understand it's going to be a doozy and I'm looking forward to viewing it.
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:37.040]  By the way, I don't want to be a drama queen here.
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:39.040]  They wanted us to put it out on Monday.
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:41.040]  And we're like absolutely we're honored.
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:45.040]  He's given us exclusive before and then like he's in the air and they're freaking out.
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:46.040]  Oh my God, the federal government after us.
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:48.040]  We're going to give you the codes to this new video.
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:50.040]  Tell people and then everything's silent.
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:51.040]  We'll see what happens.
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:52.040]  They wanted to come on today, but not O'Keefe.
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:56.040]  I said, look, let me know so I can tell me what's going on or I'm not doing it.
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:58.040]  I'm not pissing on them.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:59.040]  They're incredible people.
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:03.040]  I just want to find out what's going on because I don't want to half-ass this with folks.
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:09.040]  But when you're up there persecuting the press and when you're going after people
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:12.040]  and when you're trying to cause riots and when you're trying to beat people up,
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:15.040]  that's racketeering to shut down free speech.
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:16.040]  That's organized crime.
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:22.040]  We said, as I always pointed out, we're going because they've done this to their events.
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:25.040]  He settled rape cases in legal lawful areas.
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:28.040]  If you believe what I'm saying to stand up and say Bill Clinton's a rapist,
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:32.040]  do not get in fights, do not climb over railings, do not cause a problem.
[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:34.040]  See, that's the difference and I made this up front.
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:35.040]  I'm not defending myself now.
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:37.040]  I said this at the beginning.
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:39.040]  That's the difference between us and them.
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:45.040]  They say, go to an event, cause a fight, and then don't tell people who you were.
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:47.040]  No.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:49.040]  We don't want to cause a fight.
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:55.040]  We want to block the media that will not allow the truth to come out.
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:59.040]  That's what we're doing because I check with lawyers.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:02.040]  They're like, yeah, just don't call for violence and don't call for shutting the event down.
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:03.040]  Absolutely, that's racketeering.
[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:06.040]  But can we go and say, hey, Bill Clinton's a rapist?
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:07.040]  If you believe that, absolutely.
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:09.040]  In a legal and lawful area in a crowd, that's fine.
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:11.040]  When they tell you you're disrupting, go out, that's fine.
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:12.040]  Do that.
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:15.040]  They've clearly committed these crimes, folks.
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:19.040]  The reason I bring up my own case is I bring up what we do behind the scenes
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.040]  to make sure we're following the law.
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:24.040]  They go like 10 times what we do.
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:26.040]  And we're doing this in response to them.
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:29.040]  It's like, they punch us, we slap them back.
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:32.040]  You're like, hey, you better stop.
[01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:35.040]  I won't take a few phone calls here, but obviously the show's coming up tomorrow.
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:40.040]  We've got 14 days left tomorrow, 15 days right now.
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:42.040]  I almost said the crew's doing an amazing job.
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:43.040]  I'm so honored to be here.
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:46.040]  It is twilight zone, though, at this point.
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:49.040]  Because we've got the emails.
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:50.040]  We've got the injunctions.
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:51.040]  We've got the witnesses.
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:52.040]  We've got everything.
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:56.040]  They are taking the country down.
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:53:00.040]  And we don't want a civil war.
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:02.040]  They think they may get a civil war.
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:06.040]  Here's the most important thing I've said in 22 years on air.
[01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:11.040]  The globalists are going to sit offshore in their luxury mansions while we kill each other.
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.040]  We don't want that.
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:17.040]  We want to identify the globalists, identify their programs, say no to it.
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:23.040]  And then if they steal the election and stuff goes on, we don't go out and burn down buildings.
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:29.040]  We don't go out and shoot some poor cop who's making 30 grand a year, 40 grand a year.
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:33.040]  We just politically get more involved because they're the ones just crediting themselves.
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:36.040]  They want to trick us into some type of fight.
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:40.040]  The local government, even the average FBI agent, it's not our enemy.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:42.040]  And don't say that because I don't want to have a war with them.
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:43.040]  I'm scared.
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:44.040]  Give me a break.
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:45.040]  I'm scared of anything.
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:47.040]  Everybody knows that.
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:48.040]  They're not the enemy.
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:52.040]  The FBI and the local police are more awake than the general public to what's going on.
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.040]  We have been overtaken by criminals.
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:55.040]  They're trying to stop it.
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:57.040]  You just saw that former prosecutor.
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:59.040]  Do we go shoot him because he's a former Fed?
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:01.040]  No, he's our ally.
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:07.040]  We take the country back, not because we're on a high horse, not because we have all the answers,
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:12.040]  but because we want to process and we're out for good.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:19.040]  And we will defeat a Nazi collaborating piece of crap like George Soros any day.
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:25.040]  That's why they're funding Black Lives Matter and communist groups who are causing riots
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:28.040]  and attacking stuff in Austin as we speak.
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:30.040]  I mean, this is happening today.
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:33.040]  They've got a destabilization program going on.
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:38.040]  And we've just got to get the word out, not be idiots, and not if they steal the election,
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:42.040]  go crazy and start burning stuff or blowing shit up, excuse me.
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:43.040]  Delay that, delay that.
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:44.040]  Sorry.
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:46.040]  This has just gotten so real, folks.
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:50.040]  So down to the wire, Americans don't kill Americans.
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:52.040]  We educate other Americans.
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:53.040]  We stand up for what's right.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:59.040]  Somebody tries to push us around, tries to take us to some political prison, then we fight.
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:01.040]  But not because we wanted to, we had to then.
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:04.040]  We're taking high road all the way.
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:09.040]  And if they want to meet us on that high road and start a fight, we're ready to win it.
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:11.040]  But not out of something we wanted to do.
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:14.040]  If you want us to stomp your ass, we'll do it.
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:19.040]  We've been preparing for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years with other patriots.
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.040]  And we weren't looking for trouble.
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:24.040]  You look for trouble, you came to the right place.
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:28.040]  But the people ought to be looking for trouble are the ones that want to spend this country over a barrel
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:29.040]  and have their way with it.
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:30.040]  It's not happening.
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:32.040]  Now, I know we got loaded phones the amount of time.
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:33.040]  I apologize to everybody.
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:35.040]  Call back tomorrow, 11 AM, 3 PM.
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:36.040]  I'll take your calls.
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:39.040]  We've got a great crew, great group of people in there.
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:44.040]  And look, it's not that we're rocket scientists.
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:48.040]  I'm not perfect, but I'm not out to screw you.
[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:51.040]  I don't want to rob you and your family.
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:53.040]  I want prosperity.
[01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:55.040]  I want Renaissance.
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:59.040]  And I know you want that too, no matter what color you are or where you came from.
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:02.040]  But you got to realize the enemy's not like you.
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:09.040]  And your biggest blind spot, my biggest blind spot is we think because we want prosperity and a fair shake that they're like us.
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:12.040]  They're not like us.
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:15.040]  And we're going to have to kick their ass.
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:20.040]  Now, I would say make economic decisions, cultural decisions that circumvent them.
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:28.040]  But if they want to get down in the weeds and they want to have a face to face fight, they're going to lose.
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:30.040]  So I'm not looking for trouble.
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:33.040]  I'm not a guy that shoots his mouth off, but let me tell you something.
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:38.040]  We've done stuff that if they want a physical fight, we're going to beat their ass into the ground.
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:42.040]  We're going to hammer them into the wall.
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:43.040]  Let's not go there.
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:45.040]  Let's not play that game.
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:52.040]  Let's do everything we can to affect change now peacefully and politically to turn us around.
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:59.040]  And then if they want trouble, we're not going to have some dumb civil war with a local cops our enemy or a local FBI agents or enemy.
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:01.040]  It's going to be the politician.
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:04.040]  It's going to be people with a voting record that's against this country.
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:14.040]  It's going to be people that sold this nation out and then they will respect you and they will fear you because they know you're coming right at their neck.
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:17.040]  A lot of people looking for a fight.
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:24.040]  And in the end, they're going to get the fight they're looking for.
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:28.040]  They can already feel our hands going around their necks right now.
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:30.040]  That's why they're so scared.
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:32.040]  It's a spiritual fight.
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:34.040]  It's a fight they've lost before.
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:35.040]  They'll lose it again.
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.040]  Lord willing, I'll see you at 11 a.m. tomorrow.
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:40.040]  Central, 12 noon Eastern in FullWars.com.
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:42.040]  Fabulous job crew and listeners.
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:59.040]  We couldn't do it without you.
