[00:00.000 --> 00:19.760]  What a time to be alive, what a time to be on the front lines to fight for human liberty.
[00:19.760 --> 00:25.680]  I just want listeners again to pull back, take in a deep breath and think about what
[00:25.680 --> 00:30.720]  the world would be like without you because so many listeners of this show talk about
[00:30.720 --> 00:35.160]  Alex Jones and yes we've pissed off the globalist and yes they see us as the number one threat
[00:35.160 --> 00:39.880]  but I'm only a small part of this overall organization, it is the viewers, it is the
[00:39.880 --> 00:44.560]  listeners, it is the word of mouth, it is the guest, it is the callers, it is the special
[00:44.560 --> 00:49.320]  reports and it's the clips of the globalist and their own criminal statements past, present
[00:49.320 --> 00:54.040]  and in the future we're going to be playing that really is the cherry on top that exposes
[00:54.040 --> 00:58.440]  these people because they're so arrogant, they go out and give speeches, they go out
[00:58.440 --> 01:02.920]  and write books, they put up policy reports, white papers and then totally contradict what
[01:02.920 --> 01:07.800]  they actually say they're doing when they're around each other to us and so that's why
[01:07.800 --> 01:12.880]  they want to silence us is because they don't ever want us to be able to bring context to
[01:12.880 --> 01:17.680]  their overall long-term agenda and what their real goals are of tyranny, post-adjustable
[01:17.680 --> 01:26.880]  world and population collapse, so they really are absolute tyrants, absolute villains by
[01:26.880 --> 01:32.600]  any historical yardstick and what we do here at Info Wars is promote classical freedom
[01:32.600 --> 01:39.960]  and all the things that make civilization successful and safe and prosperous and so
[01:39.960 --> 01:44.080]  it's not that we're heroes here, it's just that we're common sense and want a livable
[01:44.080 --> 01:50.520]  future where we can raise children and not live in some type of nightmare hellscape so
[01:50.520 --> 01:53.880]  I'm very thankful I've got Elon Musk attacking me, I'm very thankful I've got the head of
[01:53.880 --> 01:58.800]  Pfizer Borla attacking me, I'm very thankful I have the ADL Democratic Party literally
[01:58.800 --> 02:02.120]  saying I'm the most dangerous evil person in the world when everybody who's got a brain
[02:02.120 --> 02:07.320]  knows that's a lie but what I am dangerous to is these eugenicists, these transhumanists,
[02:07.320 --> 02:13.160]  these pedophile protectors, these people frying us with deadly 5G and all the poisonous shots
[02:13.160 --> 02:17.400]  and the rest of it, so I am just honored to be in the position I'm in and so many people
[02:17.400 --> 02:20.040]  call into the show and also on the street and say how are you taking it, we feel so
[02:20.040 --> 02:25.240]  sorry for you, listen I chose this job, I chose to take them on, I believe in humanity,
[02:25.240 --> 02:28.320]  I believe in myself, I believe in you because I believe in God and I believe in common sense
[02:28.320 --> 02:33.440]  and history and I had a gut level instinct to just to understand and know that if we
[02:33.440 --> 02:37.200]  continue to persevere and fight we would end up winning and that's starting to happen,
[02:37.200 --> 02:40.880]  things are still incredibly negative but I just want you to remember how incredibly
[02:40.880 --> 02:46.880]  important you are, you are the little actions you take every day to spread the word or to
[02:46.880 --> 02:51.240]  pray for an awakening or to support info wars or to just be a good father, a good mother,
[02:51.240 --> 02:57.520]  a good boss, a good employer, a good neighbor, a good farmer, a machine worker, it doesn't
[02:57.520 --> 03:02.880]  matter, all of you are the little people and all of us are little in the scope of things
[03:02.880 --> 03:09.120]  but working together we do massive things together, so I want to tell you we have some
[03:09.120 --> 03:13.240]  big interviews coming up today, it's a special rebroadcast and then I'll be back on Saturday
[03:13.240 --> 03:17.800]  and back on Sunday with live broadcast, we've been broadcasting 7 days a week live but I
[03:17.800 --> 03:22.640]  wanted to give our incredible crew off Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, hopefully when you're
[03:22.640 --> 03:27.120]  listening to this this is taped, a nuclear war hasn't started, they've certainly been
[03:27.120 --> 03:33.160]  trying to do that but the good news is the AP reported others got fired for lying about
[03:33.160 --> 03:36.640]  Russian supposedly attacking Poland with a missile or missiles and there's been a lot
[03:36.640 --> 03:39.840]  of other good news as well and our enemies being forced out of the open because we've
[03:39.840 --> 03:43.960]  been exposing their agenda, they're now being enforced to externalize it and try to spin
[03:43.960 --> 03:49.080]  it and sugarcoat it like it's good but as again people go back and find the history
[03:49.080 --> 03:57.360]  of this and the present operations and realize what's coming next, time is on our side, time
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.960]  is not on Satan's time, that's what the Bible says that in Revelation that the devil sends
[04:01.960 --> 04:07.680]  the beast with a wrath because he knows his time is short and the time for these people
[04:07.680 --> 04:10.680]  is very, very short ladies and gentlemen.
[04:10.680 --> 04:14.120]  So thank you all for your support, just want to add that we're going to run the huge blowout

[06:09.280 --> 06:21.480]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[06:21.480 --> 06:40.280]  Well, we were supposed to already be off the air and the deep state threw everything they
[06:40.280 --> 06:47.480]  had at Info Wars in the last five years but thanks to you, the listeners and viewers of
[06:47.480 --> 06:55.720]  this transmission and this great crew and our amazing guest and my determination given
[06:55.720 --> 07:02.680]  to me by God, my will, given to me by my Heavenly Father, we are still on air and in many ways
[07:02.680 --> 07:11.480]  more influential and more powerful, all glory to God than we've ever been before.
[07:11.480 --> 07:21.720]  Whoo, the Republicans would win every Senate seat that's up for a vote right now.
[07:21.720 --> 07:27.440]  They would win basically every house seat that there wasn't systemic fraud that's been
[07:27.440 --> 07:33.200]  documented but the red wave's so big I do predict even when they try to stop the ballots
[07:33.200 --> 07:38.200]  in the next few weeks and shut things down that it's not going to work and the Republicans
[07:38.200 --> 07:45.280]  will narrowly take the Senate and will get a big win in the House.
[07:45.280 --> 07:54.800]  Even the Washington Post predicts in the Senate, 54 Republican wins against 46 Democrats in
[07:54.800 --> 08:06.080]  the House, 246 Republicans versus 189 Democrats and I think that is a very conservative estimate
[08:06.080 --> 08:14.760]  if it wasn't for the fraud but I think you'll actually see less than this because the power
[08:14.760 --> 08:19.360]  structure's not completely unified and there's a lot of Democrats and insidious machines
[08:19.360 --> 08:23.080]  that are going to steal the election even if the higher ups aren't wanting that and
[08:23.080 --> 08:28.520]  what I'm saying is to be very clear, the deep state doesn't want a big Republican majority
[08:28.520 --> 08:31.880]  because they want to be able to still control things and run things and they're scared
[08:31.880 --> 08:37.760]  of a new populist beachhead and caucus-forming, they want to work with the neocons and the
[08:37.760 --> 08:43.120]  deep state Democrats and the rhinos but they don't want too big a Republican victory but
[08:43.120 --> 08:47.520]  they're going to allow somewhat of a victory A because they're such a tsunami it's hard
[08:47.520 --> 08:55.840]  to steal but B they want to blame Republicans for the diesel shortages and the power outages
[08:55.840 --> 09:00.240]  and the depression that we are accelerating over the edge into.
[09:00.240 --> 09:04.440]  So that's my best analysis and calculus of what's about to happen.
[09:04.440 --> 09:10.720]  If they didn't steal a bunch of the election, different races tonight with the replay what
[09:10.720 --> 09:20.040]  they did two years ago, you would see a massive realignment, the biggest political slaughter,
[09:20.040 --> 09:24.120]  nonviolent slaughter, metaphoric slaughter we've ever seen since we've had voting in
[09:24.120 --> 09:27.560]  this country the last 250 years.
[09:27.560 --> 09:33.440]  This ladies and gentlemen is the new world order fighting for its life.
[09:33.440 --> 09:43.160]  That said, they'll mitigate it with fraud and the Republicans will not get enough in to
[09:43.160 --> 09:49.560]  have a swing vote of patriots in the house that will be able to not just block deep state
[09:49.560 --> 09:54.480]  legislation but it will be able to push good legislation to bring the globalist justice
[09:54.480 --> 09:58.840]  on a raft of issues like gain of function bio weapons and open borders and human smuggling
[09:58.840 --> 10:05.600]  and fentanyl and just all the things that are going on around the country.
[10:05.600 --> 10:10.600]  And we see a complete replay of two years ago, ABC News and all the other globalist mouthpieces
[10:10.600 --> 10:15.080]  are saying oh it'll look like Republicans are winning massively but expect a lot of those
[10:15.080 --> 10:19.680]  races to go for Democrats so you can see the scripting and you can see the scripting in
[10:19.680 --> 10:24.720]  the last speech of Biden well he's done a bunch of speeches last few days with the big one
[10:24.720 --> 10:30.320]  last Friday where he said we can't have them attacking democracy why they want to hurt
[10:30.320 --> 10:34.280]  us and they want to put us in camps and they want to kill our kids you've heard that talking
[10:34.280 --> 10:40.120]  point just totally made up and that if you challenge the election you are a terrorist
[10:40.120 --> 10:45.160]  but they're going to challenge the election and are challenging the election and Politico
[10:45.160 --> 10:51.640]  out there saying they think the RNC is trying to steal races with the voting machines so
[10:51.640 --> 10:58.200]  total oxymoronic murder of common sense, murder of logic, upside down world, you can't talk
[10:58.200 --> 11:02.480]  about election fraud, you can't question elections, you shouldn't investigate even though the
[11:02.480 --> 11:09.040]  State Department for 80 years or more has sent delegates around the world to observe
[11:09.040 --> 11:13.880]  elections and grade them and if you compare our elections to other countries we have
[11:13.880 --> 11:20.240]  amongst some of the worst elections in the world for international watchdog groups so
[11:20.240 --> 11:27.000]  oh don't trust foreign elections but you can trust ours and don't ask any questions ABC
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.480]  News says Red Mirage will look like big Republican win but vote count could take weeks early
[11:33.480 --> 11:40.320]  election night results might not indicate final tallies for weeks ABC News and it goes
[11:40.320 --> 11:46.600]  on and on and on with Michigan Democrat officials saying expected to take weeks and the White
[11:46.600 --> 11:51.640]  House press secretary will play in a moment saying it could take weeks and Federman saying
[11:51.640 --> 11:55.960]  it could take weeks and a federal judge ruling that yes they've got account ballots that
[11:55.960 --> 12:02.240]  are mislabeled or torn up or have the wrong dates on them it goes on and on and let's
[12:02.240 --> 12:09.400]  look at some of those headlines dealing with the quote outages and things voting machines
[12:09.400 --> 12:15.680]  down in New Jersey's Mercer County where we just always seem to see the swing vote for
[12:15.680 --> 12:20.000]  Democrats in a state that's normally Democrat swinging heavily Republican just like New
[12:20.000 --> 12:26.440]  York Michigan pollster does expect Red Mirage an election night but Democrat victories Fox
[12:26.440 --> 12:32.880]  dem campaign sounds along about Red Mirage Axios Trump calls on Republicans to go out
[12:32.880 --> 12:37.680]  and vote crush the communists in the ballot box love that rhetoric it's absolutely true
[12:37.680 --> 12:43.360]  election day tabulators across Maricopa County again that key place it keeps happening where
[12:43.360 --> 12:47.440]  the Republicans win in all the other counties but not there oh and in Maricopa County they're
[12:47.440 --> 12:56.160]  not working again tabulators in Texas and key Democrat control areas not working again
[12:56.160 --> 13:02.720]  just like before votes in Kierazona counties are being misread of course accidentally for
[13:02.720 --> 13:07.280]  the Democrats here we go again Dominion machines in Mercer New Jersey experiencing
[13:07.280 --> 13:11.800]  programming glitch it's happening again in New York City polling stations with a pipe
[13:11.800 --> 13:17.360]  bomb threat the same as a broken water main that didn't actually happen there in Atlanta
[13:17.360 --> 13:24.320]  a last minute change is already delaying vote counting in Philadelphia judge denies requests
[13:24.320 --> 13:30.200]  to question military ballots in Wisconsin 68% say they'll be thinking about inflation
[13:30.200 --> 13:36.800]  a lot when casting their ballots Governor which Whitmer got confronted about her lockdowns
[13:36.800 --> 13:43.240]  she just said her headphones didn't work anymore Biden pledged to shut down coal plants pushed
[13:43.240 --> 13:49.000]  about media says the White House press secretary and more gas lighting here's the press secretary
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.680]  talking about it may take a while to actually tell you who won the election because again
[13:54.680 --> 13:58.800]  they only have so many votes in warehouses pre filled out they only got so many bullets
[13:58.800 --> 14:03.480]  in their gun to steal key areas and the party bosses wanted to be able when the rubber meets
[14:03.480 --> 14:07.760]  the road as they'll have enough votes to seal it everywhere to pick the key places where
[14:07.760 --> 14:12.440]  they do want to keep their operatives in place here it is it took two weeks to call every
[14:12.440 --> 14:17.920]  state in modern elections more and more ballots are being cast in early voting and also by
[14:17.920 --> 14:24.200]  mail and many states don't start counting those ballots until after the ballots after
[14:24.200 --> 14:29.480]  pardon me after the polls closed on November 8th so you heard the president say this the
[14:29.480 --> 14:34.520]  other night he has been very clear on this as well we may not know all the winners of
[14:34.520 --> 14:40.400]  elections for a few days it takes time to count all legitimate ballots in a legal and orderly
[14:40.400 --> 14:46.760]  manner that's how that's how this is supposed to work and it's important for us so that's
[14:46.760 --> 14:52.000]  how it's supposed to work you know about 50 years ago 80 years ago 100 years ago every
[14:52.000 --> 14:58.480]  little precinct would count the ballots they would then phone it in or call it in or before
[14:58.480 --> 15:02.680]  we really even had telephones they would then go down to the city square area they would
[15:02.680 --> 15:06.000]  then tabulate them all together you'd have poll watchers that would go and make sure
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.760]  that number that was at the precinct was correct we had pretty fair elections on average still
[15:09.760 --> 15:15.400]  some problems but now with all the computers and all the fancy gadgetry well we just can't
[15:15.400 --> 15:21.280]  know for weeks that's just the way it works ladies and gentlemen now a big part of this
[15:21.280 --> 15:26.160]  activism exposing these people is never giving up even when they steal elections and coming
[15:26.160 --> 15:31.600]  back and enforcing the issue as it angers voters who don't give up and only double down
[15:31.600 --> 15:35.160]  and that's what scares them they want you to give up never give up and they also don't
[15:35.160 --> 15:39.720]  want you to say hey there's live real coverage of what's going down what they don't want
[15:39.720 --> 15:43.520]  you to know about the election as they try to replay of the theft of two years ago here's
[15:43.520 --> 15:49.160]  the forbidden link Alex Jones and info wars dot com and info wars dot com forward slash

[16:57.560 --> 17:05.440]  for your support god bless in arizona I think we watched the election be stolen slowly stolen
[17:05.440 --> 17:11.960]  day by day counting these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take
[17:11.960 --> 17:18.480]  our election seriously when we we just it's election month Alex it's not election day
[17:18.480 --> 17:25.080]  and that's the problem and everything changed after COVID-19 they illegally changed state
[17:25.080 --> 17:32.240]  elections mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people
[17:32.240 --> 17:36.680]  well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious country when we have elections
[17:36.680 --> 17:41.240]  that can be stolen like this and I believe that just like I believe the election was
[17:41.240 --> 17:46.800]  stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media
[17:46.800 --> 17:52.560]  and the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity and question the the
[17:52.560 --> 17:58.040]  fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election deniers we're
[17:58.040 --> 18:04.760]  election realists the tip of the spear throughout this entire process the only thing that made
[18:04.760 --> 18:09.760]  any republican victories tonight possible the only thing that made any resistance to the
[18:09.760 --> 18:15.520]  war machine machine possible the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns
[18:15.520 --> 18:19.960]  and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and and the forced vaccines and the dangerous
[18:19.960 --> 18:26.160]  drugs possible that made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support
[18:26.160 --> 18:31.240]  info wars despite the massive law fair being waged against info wars despite the media
[18:31.240 --> 18:37.520]  defamatory libelist campaign against info wars the ordinary people the everyday people
[18:37.520 --> 18:42.320]  that buy products that make their own lives healthier wealthier and wiser is what keeps
[18:42.320 --> 18:47.840]  info wars on the air and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era
[18:47.840 --> 18:53.240]  in an age of totalitarian oppression so continue to do it go to places like info wars store

[23:08.400 --> 23:12.400]  they're going to try to spin their attempted steal tonight that's why we're not just going
[23:12.400 --> 23:17.520]  to chronicle like we're passive observers here what they're trying to do to us we're going to be
[23:17.520 --> 23:22.400]  tracking it with your calls from what you've seen at the polls or what you're witnessing in key
[23:22.400 --> 23:29.520]  battleground states like michigan like pennsylvania like wisconsin like arizona we are going to be

[23:36.800 --> 23:43.760]  the night not just the special guests that are joining us and i may even do something tonight
[23:43.760 --> 23:49.200]  where we don't even get your name or where you're calling from and we just air you live on air uh
[23:49.200 --> 23:52.240]  that's something i used to do a long time ago when i was running the show with only one border
[23:52.240 --> 23:58.480]  operator that's real talk radio right there uh but that'll be later into the uh wee hours
[23:58.480 --> 24:03.120]  of the evening and it won't be fully decided tonight uh because they don't care republicans
[24:03.120 --> 24:06.480]  win about five ten points they're just they've got warehouses full of fake ballots they're going to go
[24:06.480 --> 24:09.200]  cram them in they're going to pull in with trucks the middle of the night when it's closed they're
[24:09.200 --> 24:12.560]  going to cover the windows up again they're going to say water mains broke again when they don't
[24:12.560 --> 24:16.240]  they're going to try to steal it i mean this is a hardcore criminal group uh they're going to try
[24:16.240 --> 24:20.480]  to intimidate and attack and sue anybody that challenges it but it doesn't matter in the end
[24:20.480 --> 24:27.440]  we're winning and you see the whole world turning against the new world order but i want to cover the
[24:27.440 --> 24:33.680]  tactics with david eich who's been listed as a level three terrorist you know i saw that last
[24:33.680 --> 24:39.280]  week when it broke and then i went and looked at the actual eu letter and it said well he believes
[24:39.280 --> 24:44.240]  the government's corrupt and planning to put you in camps and that's scary and can make people not
[24:44.240 --> 24:50.240]  like the government so he's banned from europe for two years that's the model for the rest of the world
[24:50.960 --> 24:54.880]  but then they're doing everything david eich says they're doing this ties in everything we've been
[24:54.880 --> 25:02.480]  covering that's next segment then as i said uh later in the next hour we'll open the phones up
[25:02.480 --> 25:07.760]  we'll have another guest pop in from australia in 30 minutes um we'll take calls again then
[25:08.320 --> 25:12.720]  mike adams is loaded for bear with critical information breaking news that he's tracking
[25:12.720 --> 25:17.280]  in the fourth hour and then elin shroyer the war room is just loaded with guests and we're taking
[25:17.280 --> 25:23.280]  calls all the latest numbers and then at about six central we'll start getting a real clear picture
[25:23.280 --> 25:31.840]  of what's going on and i'm going to be here from about 6 30 right through to 2 a.m. tonight
[25:31.840 --> 25:36.480]  elin shroyer and harissa smith are going to be in another studio and every 15 minutes we're going
[25:36.480 --> 25:41.120]  to cut to them and they're going to give us news and analysis and the latest breaking information
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.440]  and that's critical so starting at 6 p.m. tonight we'll air a few reports and a few promos and a
[25:47.440 --> 25:54.080]  few special reports and maybe a few ads but it's going to be very commercial light i would imagine
[25:54.080 --> 25:59.520]  you'll probably get three minutes of ads an hour again everybody's addicted to podcasts and so am i
[25:59.520 --> 26:03.280]  was one of the first podcasters out there i've always done a podcast you know on top of the show
[26:03.280 --> 26:08.080]  till they ban me off most podcasting but we're still on air because of our great amnf affiliates
[26:08.080 --> 26:14.400]  first 14 minutes it adds an hour standard talk radio but when we shift into our coverage tonight
[26:14.400 --> 26:21.200]  at 6 p.m. we're going to go very commercial light and our affiliates everywhere are not just welcome

[27:14.720 --> 27:20.240]  them so bad when our broadcast was the biggest thing in the world in 2016 and why we became public

[34:39.680 --> 34:48.000]  them to use mind control and fear and to quote brainwash the public and then we told you this
[34:48.000 --> 34:55.520]  over a decade ago but it's now come out mainstream news that the cia and fbi here domestically

[36:11.200 --> 36:17.360]  loss and demonization now david ike's been singled out for the next level declaring someone a
[36:17.360 --> 36:24.880]  terrorist and an official eu document us covered response table of national security council run
[36:24.880 --> 36:33.360]  by the pentagon mainstream news we're going to be getting to all of that coming up it ties into
[36:33.360 --> 36:44.000]  operation lockstep from 2011 run by the rockefeller foundation and here's even the nih saying the us
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.040]  department of state is policing the population they're going to use viruses for control that's
[36:49.040 --> 36:59.200]  the government itself and it goes on and on and on and that ties in to the big event that just
[36:59.200 --> 37:05.440]  happened to david ike david ike bam from european union countries for two years that's how terrified
[37:05.440 --> 37:10.880]  the cult is of him they went on to list him as a level three terrorist the transcript david ike
[37:10.880 --> 37:15.520]  dot com of it we went and transcribed it ourselves we believe that we wanted to have it ourselves
[37:15.520 --> 37:21.920]  and indeed from the eu via the netherlands they say you question government you say that we are
[37:21.920 --> 37:28.400]  tyrants that's not allowed you're a level three terrorist deep state operative argues to use same
[37:28.400 --> 37:33.360]  technologies using this radical islam to take down conservative americans gateway pundit and
[37:33.360 --> 37:38.560]  here's the actual article fox news former cia intelligence officers just using counterterrorism
[37:38.560 --> 37:46.400]  strategies against right wing americans it's already been going on remember to investigate parents at
[37:46.400 --> 37:51.760]  the school board meetings over critical race theory and transgenderism turned out the just
[37:51.760 --> 37:58.880]  department ran that it wasn't a request of the schools that's what we're talking about with david
[37:58.880 --> 38:04.880]  ike and how it ties in to the disinformation governance board they claim that they shut down
[38:04.880 --> 38:10.080]  no it's still operating and they say in their own documents that we covered last week it's illegal
[38:10.080 --> 38:15.760]  what they're doing but they've got to keep it secret and so the think tanks it says the adl
[38:15.760 --> 38:21.440]  they name them give them the government the order then the government creates a secret
[38:21.440 --> 38:27.360]  government order that's illegal and then has the adl tell along with a handful of other think tanks
[38:28.320 --> 38:34.640]  and and watchdog groups and fact checkers what big tech and the media does i mean this is
[38:36.080 --> 38:41.680]  chinese communist level so namidae joins us to talk about this historic event and i don't want to
[38:41.680 --> 38:46.720]  say i'm envious or jealous but he's i mean you know how dangerous somebody is to the cult as he
[38:46.720 --> 38:52.400]  calls them by how much they're attacked well this is a new level uh three years ago zuckerberg said
[38:52.400 --> 38:57.040]  i'm the most banned person in the world he said i'm now what you call a dangerous person and that
[38:57.040 --> 39:01.760]  violence is allowed to be called for against me but no one is allowed to say anything positive
[39:01.760 --> 39:06.560]  that's the actual rules of facebook well david ike has now reached a level above that he's listed
[39:06.560 --> 39:12.560]  as a terrorist the type one tries to blow up or shoot people for political aims the type two supports
[39:12.560 --> 39:18.160]  them but type three just says bad things about the system and encourages terrorists well under that
[39:18.960 --> 39:23.600]  rubric all of us are terrorists aren't we david ike of david ike dot com the iconic
[39:24.240 --> 39:29.680]  a long time top broadcast in the uk till he had his epiphany in the early 90s then became
[39:29.680 --> 39:34.240]  the greatest challenger of the cult along with myself since then but he's been around longer
[39:34.240 --> 39:38.880]  than i have we're kind of the two-headed monster according to new world order and he joins us now
[39:38.880 --> 39:46.480]  david you are now officially listed as a type three terrorist because you said the government
[39:46.480 --> 39:53.200]  is authoritarian which they're proving they are thank you for joining us hello alex well the thing is
[39:53.200 --> 40:03.760]  that um what kind of level of moron does it take for you to say things about what's happening and
[40:03.760 --> 40:13.040]  what the plan is for those things to then unfold in front of people's eyes and they then say it's
[40:13.040 --> 40:21.520]  a conspiracy theory i mean the level of moron needed to process that into a conclusion is just
[40:21.520 --> 40:30.400]  beyond my imagination what happened alex is that i was asked to go and speak wait for it at a peace
[40:30.400 --> 40:38.560]  rally in amsterdam which i was very happy to do and this is the sequence that happens it's the same
[40:38.560 --> 40:47.360]  sequence that uh led to me being banned from australia in 2019 first of all you're invited to speak
[40:47.360 --> 40:56.640]  okay and then uh you get usually an ultra zionist organization in this case an organization called
[40:56.640 --> 41:03.440]  city in australia it was one called the anti defamation commission these are man and a dog
[41:03.440 --> 41:09.200]  organizations and they start kicking off that you're going to say this and you're going to say that
[41:09.200 --> 41:14.160]  well you're actually not going to say it and they bloody well know it and what happens then is the
[41:14.160 --> 41:22.080]  media pick it up and in in the netherlands the entirety of the media went absolutely off their
[41:22.080 --> 41:31.440]  heads was everywhere television radio national newspapers that this uh anti-semite was going
[41:31.440 --> 41:39.360]  to come and speak um in amsterdam uh what happens then is the morons kick in these are the woker
[41:39.360 --> 41:46.480]  morons these are the anti fascist fascists and the anti hate haters they kick off and they say we've
[41:46.480 --> 41:52.480]  got to stop this because we're anti anti fascist right okay look in the mirror if you want to see
[41:52.480 --> 41:59.040]  a fascist mate and then um the government come in and the politicians of course desperate to
[41:59.040 --> 42:06.160]  virtue signal they say oh yes we mustn't have this man he's spewing hatred evidence evidence we don't
[42:06.160 --> 42:13.200]  need evidence just spewing hatred and then um the the government uh in general the netherlands
[42:13.200 --> 42:18.000]  government and this happened in australia and they said we've got to stop this man that is in
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.840]  some way or other david david stay there i went to you legs i wanted to set this up you'll have
[42:21.840 --> 42:26.080]  plenty of time next hour and next segment stay there let me give me the floor when we come back
[42:26.080 --> 42:29.760]  but i want to just preface it because what you just said is exactly what they do here and everywhere
[42:29.760 --> 42:36.720]  else the adl group really runs the government literally it's in the documents they they then go
[42:36.720 --> 42:40.800]  create the complaint in the media and then the government responds but in the documents it's really
[42:40.800 --> 42:45.200]  the adl ordering the government to do it then they have the adl make the complaint then the
[42:45.200 --> 42:49.440]  government makes the order we'll be right back with david ike i mean it's in the documents folks
[42:49.440 --> 42:55.680]  it's the adl i mean they literally are the thought police so dangerous most of things the nazis in
[42:55.680 --> 43:05.440]  our lifetimes we'll be right back until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world believe
[43:05.440 --> 43:11.760]  that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors
[43:11.760 --> 43:18.560]  they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold weather or
[43:18.560 --> 43:25.200]  catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3 you see
[43:25.200 --> 43:32.320]  the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting enough sun
[43:32.320 --> 43:37.120]  you will not produce vitamin d3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start
[43:37.120 --> 43:42.080]  replicating and taking your body over so now it's more important than ever because the winter's here

[44:58.640 --> 45:04.560]  your bottle today so when i first started taking survival shield basically i was 275 pounds i was
[45:04.560 --> 45:10.000]  overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.160]  dr grip on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[45:14.160 --> 45:18.800]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too you
[45:18.800 --> 45:22.640]  had you know with a deeper source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and
[45:22.640 --> 45:28.880]  man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you
[45:28.880 --> 45:34.000]  know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.400]  couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements
[45:38.400 --> 45:43.360]  they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knock out it literally
[45:43.360 --> 45:47.840]  like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to
[45:47.840 --> 45:52.400]  get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is
[45:52.400 --> 45:57.840]  to take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so much for calling god
[45:57.840 --> 46:06.560]  speed in arizona i think we watched the election be uh stolen slowly stolen day by day counting
[46:06.560 --> 46:13.840]  these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when
[46:13.840 --> 46:20.720]  we we just it's election month alex it's not election day and that's the problem and everything
[46:20.720 --> 46:28.720]  changed after covid-19 they illegally changed state elections mailing ballots to anyone and everyone
[46:28.720 --> 46:34.000]  and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people well this isn't any way to run an election we're
[46:34.000 --> 46:39.440]  in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this and i believe that just
[46:39.440 --> 46:44.960]  like i believe the election was stolen in 2020 and i have no problem saying that and it's it is
[46:44.960 --> 46:50.560]  so absurd for the media and the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity
[46:50.560 --> 46:56.720]  and question the the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election
[46:56.720 --> 47:10.800]  deniers we're election realists leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[47:15.680 --> 47:25.840]  back to live coverage going through past midnight tonight with steve bannon roger stone olyn schreuer
[47:25.840 --> 47:31.360]  robert barnes so many others ali alexander in studio right through midnight tonight i'm going
[47:31.360 --> 47:35.840]  to be up here from like 6 30 on through midnight i'm gonna be here obviously uh till uh past two
[47:35.840 --> 47:41.200]  o'clock today mike adams is going to be coming in as well so much more but what david ike is telling
[47:41.200 --> 47:45.840]  you is the future under the global social credit score for everybody he's been listed as a quote
[47:45.840 --> 47:53.040]  level three terrorist of the e u band from going to a peace rally uh obviously he's not anti-semitic
[47:53.040 --> 47:57.920]  he's not anti-human anyway all completely made up so how this works is globalist bodies create
[47:57.920 --> 48:04.400]  the policy the wef says we're going to censor our opposition puts out policy papers then usually
[48:04.400 --> 48:09.040]  adl affiliations of an ibrewth around the world that's just who does it it's on record you said all
[48:09.040 --> 48:15.680]  of the news they come in and have policy that then government implements then government covertly
[48:16.320 --> 48:21.760]  goes and tells big tech and others follow the orders of the adl when they complain that's in
[48:21.760 --> 48:26.240]  the documents in the intercept document that we've been covering for a week and a half here
[48:26.240 --> 48:31.440]  david ike just lived through it and the next level of the control so so david we got to the
[48:31.440 --> 48:36.480]  point of the governments then who are behind it working through these groups say oh my gosh we've
[48:36.480 --> 48:41.600]  got the media freaking out they've all libeled you calling you a nazi which is upside down world
[48:41.600 --> 48:46.640]  you're loved by everybody across the board and then the government lists you as a terrorist
[48:46.640 --> 48:52.640]  and what's even more insane is what they call being a terrorist is questioning them so please continue
[48:54.160 --> 49:01.840]  yeah so you reached the point as i was saying where they have wound up the the moronic
[49:02.960 --> 49:10.800]  wokers the anti fascist fascists and the anti hate haters and what happens because you know
[49:10.800 --> 49:18.400]  obviously i'm talking across a range a tapestry of subjects um you get other groups coming in and
[49:18.400 --> 49:25.920]  so in the end there were three counter protests that were going to be in the dam square in um
[49:25.920 --> 49:33.120]  amsterdam um protesting against me there was the city one and they were going to blow whistles
[49:33.120 --> 49:39.680]  and bang drums to drown me out if i got in there then there was another anti fascist fascist group
[49:39.680 --> 49:44.320]  and then extinction rebellion was going to be there because i'm challenging you because climate
[49:44.320 --> 49:50.240]  change um and of course what they're trying to do is silence you you're saying actually there is
[49:50.880 --> 49:55.600]  an agenda or a conspiracy to silence people having a different opinion and then they go
[49:55.600 --> 50:00.800]  improve your right by telling you you're wrong and so we reached the point then where the government
[50:00.800 --> 50:05.840]  had their excuse this is where it's all leading to and so they call the police in and the police say
[50:05.840 --> 50:10.560]  oh we're a bit worried we're a bit worried about these counter protests and you know there might
[50:10.560 --> 50:15.280]  be trouble and so they say well there might be trouble because of you know the way people are
[50:15.280 --> 50:22.400]  acting towards you well yeah thanks to you and they say um we have got to protect the the people
[50:22.400 --> 50:27.280]  from from harm and possible violence and which is not going to come from me it's going to come from
[50:27.280 --> 50:33.920]  the protesters and so they ban you but it went more than that because we got a letter as i mean
[50:33.920 --> 50:39.040]  i've been here before i was sitting in a hotel in los angeles four hours before heading to
[50:39.040 --> 50:47.440]  australia in 2019 to do a six city tour when i got this um a letter from the immigration
[50:47.440 --> 50:51.920]  ministry in australia bloke called david korman saying actually we're going to revoke your visa
[50:51.920 --> 50:57.120]  you're not coming in anymore and the same thing basically happened i was sitting in in the on the
[50:57.120 --> 51:02.800]  kent coast before i was going to go through the next day the channel tunnel to uh to anster dam
[51:02.800 --> 51:10.640]  and uh suddenly this thing arrives this letter arrives and um it says that um not only are you
[51:10.640 --> 51:17.600]  not allowed to come into amsterdam but you're banned for two years from what they call the shengen group
[51:17.600 --> 51:25.200]  of countries 26 countries in europe and and not only in in the european union um that uh worked
[51:25.200 --> 51:32.160]  together and if one banshee they all ban you right so um i thought it was a joke for a start and i
[51:32.160 --> 51:38.400]  hopes um that they were going to ban me from 26 countries and i hear today alex it's more than
[51:38.400 --> 51:44.320]  that because other countries they're not actually in the shengen group also follow the shengen what
[51:44.320 --> 51:52.240]  they call a shengen information system sis um definitions of of undesirable people and they
[51:52.240 --> 51:58.080]  banned them as well including the united states so um it's uh it's an international an international
[51:58.080 --> 52:06.480]  no travel database for your peace movement pro-human anti-terrory uh views yeah i'm i'm actually
[52:06.480 --> 52:14.400]  pretty much confined to the uk now um because of having uh the view that um a few people are
[52:14.400 --> 52:20.080]  controlling the world to a very sinister end at that very end that's unfolding all around us i mean
[52:20.080 --> 52:29.920]  hello and uh so one of the things in that letter uh from the uh the dutch government was that i mean
[52:29.920 --> 52:34.000]  they went in they went in and started talking about all your saying that you know some of these
[52:34.000 --> 52:39.040]  people are reptiles and all that stuff all that dehumanizes them and it said that what you're doing
[52:39.040 --> 52:48.160]  and what you're saying um is um challenging the legitimacy of people in authority oh really well
[52:48.160 --> 52:54.720]  i thought challenging the legitimacy of people in power was what they called freedom and a basic
[52:54.720 --> 53:01.360]  human right to question governments but no questioning governments now um has you were
[53:01.360 --> 53:05.760]  silenced and banned and for a very simple reason i mean there's a very good things about this
[53:06.720 --> 53:12.720]  and that is you know you can see where the real power is i mean these people control the banking
[53:12.720 --> 53:18.960]  system the government system they control the corporations the major corporations they control
[53:18.960 --> 53:24.720]  the media they control silicon valley and yet they're frightened of a few people standing up and
[53:24.720 --> 53:30.480]  pointing out what they're doing so you know for them to be terrified of people like me to the
[53:30.480 --> 53:36.000]  point they have to go to these incredible lengths i just shows you where the real power is if people
[53:36.000 --> 53:43.840]  would just uh wake up stiffen their backbone and say no we're not cooperating with you without our
[53:43.840 --> 53:52.160]  cooperation or mass they couldn't do this it it really is crazy to go back and read your books
[53:52.160 --> 53:57.840]  from 30 years ago in my my films and work from over 25 years ago and it's all come true exactly
[53:57.840 --> 54:01.440]  like we said because we're just going off their own documents i mean they're admitting at the
[54:01.440 --> 54:07.360]  wef they want to silence all political opposition they're talking about the one in guardian arresting
[54:07.360 --> 54:12.400]  people that question man-made global warming you got all the elites flying to these un climate
[54:12.400 --> 54:17.120]  summits on private jets you've got extinction rebellion harassing blue-collar workers getting
[54:17.120 --> 54:22.320]  their jobs but but never going and harassing the elites and openly being funded by the most
[54:22.320 --> 54:27.920]  powerful families on earth i mean they're out in the open saying they want to depopulate us they're
[54:27.920 --> 54:32.000]  out in the open saying they want control of our bodies to put things in us it's confirmed the
[54:32.000 --> 54:36.400]  shots don't work it's confirmed they're killing us i mean it's just we're inside the new world
[54:36.400 --> 54:43.360]  order david what comes next well i tell you what um when the big pennies drop they dropped for me
[54:43.360 --> 54:50.320]  a long time ago is when you realize alex that you're living in a lunatic asylum that's basically
[54:50.320 --> 54:57.200]  what it is and so you've got um uh weight people who can see the lunacy and you've got loads of
[54:57.200 --> 55:02.400]  actual lunatics that can't see it and think they are they're credible they they think they're
[55:02.400 --> 55:09.520]  challenging the system for instance when they are demanding everything the system wants and so um
[55:10.320 --> 55:15.600]  you know it that this cult as i call it this global cult with all its different expressions
[55:15.600 --> 55:23.920]  like the world economic forum that doesn't concern me anything like as much as the morons and i keep
[55:23.920 --> 55:29.840]  using that word because it's appropriate in the population because the number of people in full
[55:29.840 --> 55:35.760]  knowledge of what they're doing compared with the global population now about to pass eight billion
[55:36.480 --> 55:43.840]  is tiny and they couldn't do what they're doing and they couldn't do what they want to do unless
[55:43.840 --> 55:54.720]  a vast tract of moronic members of the population i mean the woken mentality is a classic would one
[55:54.720 --> 56:01.360]  just believe what they're told without question and just behave as they're told this is what
[56:01.360 --> 56:06.640]  extinction rebellion and all these people are doing this the so-called um liberals they're
[56:06.640 --> 56:15.200]  actually fascistic not liberal um they they are um campaigning and seeking to silence um on the
[56:15.200 --> 56:22.800]  basis of what these uh billionaires and this cabal wants they're playing their essential part in it
[56:22.800 --> 56:29.280]  and without those morons it wouldn't it wouldn't be possible without the moronic people who were
[56:29.280 --> 56:36.160]  shouting anti-fascist of me the moronic people in this city ultraseinist organization the moronic
[56:36.160 --> 56:42.800]  people in extinction rebellion it would not have been possible to justify my ban not only from the
[56:42.800 --> 56:48.640]  netherlands but so many other countries it's the morons that are the problem that you know the
[56:48.640 --> 56:55.120]  cult uh um is trying to impose it but without the morons it can't happen and we need to call
[56:55.120 --> 57:00.480]  these people out and not be cowed by them and again for those who don't know they're a literal
[57:00.480 --> 57:05.440]  death cult funded by the most rich people on earth saying we all need to die and the public
[57:05.440 --> 57:08.240]  needs to recognize that we're going to go to break come right back but i want to ask you the big
[57:08.240 --> 57:13.840]  question damon ike i don't agree with david uh you know rockfeller i don't agree with bill
[57:13.840 --> 57:19.520]  gates and claus schwaub we should just kill everybody but if the public's that dumb and
[57:19.520 --> 57:24.880]  is caught in this trance through their social Darwinistic worldview people deserve it except
[57:24.880 --> 57:29.040]  children don't deserve it they don't deserve to be injected with deadly shots if some leftist idiot
[57:29.040 --> 57:33.040]  wants to take poison shots and die that's their issue but the children don't deserve it we'll come
[57:33.040 --> 57:37.040]  right back on the other side and talk about where this is all headed with the iconic david ike of

[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.880]  that next segment what that means he also wants to get an elon musk and twitter but right now i
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:37.680]  wanted you to briefly in the short segment talk about all the demonization all the attacks we've
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:44.480]  experienced more support than ever more love than ever i went out for my wife's 44th birthday to a
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:50.640]  very popular restaurant that liberals go to i was mobbed by men and women particularly i guess
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.640]  people love the villain media says the villain not trying to brag but it was a little crazy
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.200]  how many women were literally like i was Elvis Presley something's happening this is not working
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:06.640]  david are you experiencing when i'm experiencing oh exactly and uh what's happened in the Netherlands
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:12.320]  is you know i was pretty known in the in the Netherlands a bit notorious and also very very
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:18.080]  popular with a lot of people because of what i've been saying all these decades um but what the media
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:22.960]  have done and the government has done is just make me one of the most famous people in the
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:27.680]  Netherlands in fact probably the most famous in many ways over the last two weeks because i was
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:33.760]  it was everywhere and by the way while i was everywhere being demonized in the media not one
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:40.640]  of those media organizations ever contacted me to ask for a comment there are all these discussions
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:48.480]  on their radio and television programs and their newspaper stuff not once was i asked for um for
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:54.400]  a comment uh because they want to demonize you and you've experienced this in the court cases they
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:59.200]  want to demonize you but they don't want you to have a platform to say what you what you're you
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:04.080]  um you you you are saying and they don't want people to hear so what are they because we're not
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:07.520]  bragging more probably than ever it just shows the public's not buying it what do they do with
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.280]  the paradox as they try to silence us and only makes us bigger the Streisand effect
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:18.720]  yeah well this is what what's happened in and i've had many many messages like this um people
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:24.720]  in the Netherlands that didn't really know about me or even know of me were say hold on a minute
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:30.640]  what is this guy saying that's getting this massive kind of reaction what's going on and they look
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:36.400]  at what you're saying and they go oh my god i can see why they want to ban him now and it gets
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:41.760]  bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger the more they try to demonize you the more people are
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:47.040]  attracted to ask the question well what's he saying then and then they see what you're saying and
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.760]  more and more people start to see stuff they wouldn't otherwise have seen i could have gone into
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:58.960]  Amsterdam on uh on the weekend i could have spoken for half an hour in front of a group of people
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:04.400]  in the square and i would have gone home but instead i've been all over the Netherlands
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:11.520]  if that's all over the world this story has been covered all over the world and so um in a way
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:17.920]  it's almost like a panic we've got to silence them but but if we try to do it in this panic
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:27.040]  extreme massively over the top way with you and then with me here um then you're going to alert
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:33.280]  people to see that actually there's something going on and when then people start to realize
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:38.800]  that you've been saying that current events were coming for decades then they start to get even more
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:46.640]  interested so um it's it's almost what's that old saying uh no publicity is bad publicity well that's
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:53.600]  in so many ways um what we're looking at because the people who demonize you and and and attack
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:04:00.880]  and abuse you they're not going to listen to you anyway but in doing so you alert more people who
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:06.160]  do have a mind of their own and they start to see stuff they wouldn't have looked at before so it's
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:13.680]  there's many positives uh to this as well beautifully said David wow when we come back
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.360]  we're gonna get into that big question i posed before the break about we don't want to kill
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.840]  the dumb dumb masses but the globalist social darlinism is if they don't know we're killing
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.520]  them they deserve it how do we deal with that paradox then you want to talk about elon musk
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.760]  i wanted to get you on about elon musk we got some big twitter news with you and elon musk

[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:46.720]  information war it's alex jones
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:07:09.760]  all right we have coming up after david leaves us massive news of election fraud by the democrats
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:15.040]  across the country video of it machine shutting down on the key districts democrats saying it'll
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:20.960]  go for weeks so much more but david ike is target number one right now for the new world order
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:28.880]  listed by the EU as a level three terrorist for calling for peace in an end to war and banned
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:33.840]  from entering the continent of europe for two years and i asked you at the end of the last hour
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:39.440]  david for stations that just joined us in lizards that just tuned in you were talking about how you
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.520]  got to be a complete moron to not see the world government the tyranny and the deadly shots and
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:48.320]  the surveillance and the control now and the very fact that these are tyrants we're dealing with the
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:53.760]  bad guys so then doesn't the public going along with deserve it but the children don't deserve it
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:58.000]  and most the public's still in a trance but i saw national polls the democrats even did
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.120]  they're shocked by it 44 percent of voters think they're shadow evil cabals are running things
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:08.880]  50 plus percent of republicans 37 percent of democrats 40 plus percent of independents so
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:14.560]  there's a real awakening happening but there's still those that are in a trance it seems there's a
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:21.200]  splitting apart right now so how do we deal with the social darwin idea that those in the public
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:25.760]  that fail the iq test and go and take the shot and get sick and die well in a way the
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:30.400]  globals are doing us a favor but that's buying into their mindset they're trying to dumb everybody
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:36.240]  down how do we thread the needle on that concept well you see there's a massive um
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:43.840]  parting of the ways um but it doesn't uh have to be you know this group is going that way and
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:52.080]  that group's going that way there can be a movement from from the group that is responsible for what's
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:58.320]  going on and they are um to the ones that are awakening to it because if you break it down
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:05.040]  there's three types of people and two of them are responsible for this tyranny yes this
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:11.920]  cult is trying to impose it but they can't without these two groups one is that which just believes
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:19.680]  what they're told without question so you have the global warming human cause climate change
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:25.920]  believers who are just repeating what they've been told to believe then they don't have a mind of
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:31.200]  their own they don't think they don't question they don't research they repeat and this um
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:37.440]  unquestioning group that just do whatever they're told without uh thinking or questioning we saw
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.760]  that classically in covid that's what they are they are repeaters they haven't got an original
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.840]  thought in their head because they haven't had a thought in their head that someone else hasn't
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:53.760]  put there and then you've got another second group also responsible for what's happening and how
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:10:01.040]  it's possible and they do see it they do see some of it and they absolutely don't want to do what
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:07.200]  they're told but they're terrified of not doing what they're told to do and so they do it and
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:14.320]  these two groups have been responsible for every tyranny in history because fascism is not brought
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:20.080]  in by fascist communism whatever you want to talk uh call it uh because there's never enough of them
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:27.440]  fascism and communism is brought in by the public's acquiescence to the communists and the fascists
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:34.000]  and and these are the two groups that have got us where we are now then the third group which is
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:42.160]  getting bigger it is um are those that can see it they're the real renegades the ones that can see it
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:48.560]  and they're seeing more of it as this as we move forward and they're not prepared to cooperate with
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:55.840]  it they're not prepared to to um just believe it without question and they're not prepared to have
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:02.640]  their backbone vibrating like a jelly um and and therefore do what they really don't want to do
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:09.360]  because they're frightened and not doing it this is this is the renegade group that is the only group
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:15.760]  that can bring this down because it's the only group that will act in ways that remove the cause of
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:23.200]  the problem and the cause of the problem is human acquiescence in the form of unquestioning um
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:30.800]  obedience and belief and the other one in fear of not doing what you're told the only group
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:36.480]  that can bring this down or any other tyrannian history it's the group that's brought down every
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:43.360]  tyrannian history those that see it and are not bloody having it and that's why no matter what they
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:49.920]  throw at me throw at you and all the rest of it we must get stronger as a result of it not weaker
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:59.120]  because as they throw this um abuse and this attempt to silence us they're telling us they're
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:06.400]  frightened of us and they're frightened of us because they know their narrative is unsustainable
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:15.040]  in terms of credibility they have no narrative stand up to public debate not the climate changes
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:22.240]  not the the wokers not the transgender activists not the uh the world economic forum it will not
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:29.200]  stand up to scrutiny and debate and because they fear that and they know that they have to stop the
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:36.880]  debate and that's what they're doing with this hysterical um censorship the more hysterical
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:45.360]  the censorship gets they're just betraying how frightened they are of um other forms of information
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:52.560]  that unravel and destroy what they're trying to get people to believe at the bottom line of all
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:59.840]  this that the stadium in which this is all played out is human perception that's what they have to
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:07.280]  control to get billions of people to do what they want so human perception authority knows best I
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:13.600]  must believe what authority says a human perception oh well I don't want to do it but what the
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:20.480]  consequences are not doing it human perception I can see it and I'm not bloody having it and they
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:26.400]  are the perceptions that we're looking at and the third one is the only one that can bring this down
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:35.680]  perfectly said David I I've got a lot of other questions for you in general but we're just three
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:40.800]  minutes to break obviously we know the republican party isn't perfect they got a lot of evil people
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:45.120]  at the top but there is a populist movement taking it over another populist movement in Brazil and
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:52.240]  sweden everywhere else the systems after it what do you make of the midterms here and and and the
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:56.720]  already evidence is coming out of mounting fraud what's your gut level view on that
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:04.080]  well um you're not supposed to say it but anyway I couldn't care less I mean it's obvious that the
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:10.960]  last presidential election was stolen I mean how you get more votes than for Biden than any other
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:16.320]  presidential candidate in history where he's clearly senile and hardly left his bunker for
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:21.760]  the entire election campaign I mean hello I mean how much evidence do you need beyond that even
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:30.560]  it's ridiculous and so when you are doing things um and you're pushing an agenda which actually even
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:37.040]  a lot of democrats have started to go well hold on a minute this is the best stream now in it um you
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:44.960]  you um have to um manipulate elections you have to use fear and uh all the rest of the techniques
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:52.640]  that they use because you're losing the population the population doesn't want what you're doing
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.480]  you look at what's happening not just in the united states but around the world
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:03.840]  where inflation and energy prices and food prices and all these things are making the basic survival
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:11.440]  of families and people nigh impossible and ever more so the world economic forum controlled
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:19.920]  Netherlands which is why this has happened to me uh run by this uh w e f agent called um

[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:18.480]  any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and and the
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:24.800]  forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible it made any resistance to it possible was people
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:30.560]  continuing to support info wars despite the massive law fair being waged against info wars
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:37.360]  despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against info wars the ordinary people the everyday
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:42.880]  people that buy products that make their own lives healthier wealthier and wiser is what keeps info
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:49.040]  wars on the air and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era in an age of
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:54.400]  totalitarian oppression so continue to do it go to places like info wars store dot com go to the
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:20:00.240]  places like save info wars continue to keep info wars alive because in the process you're
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:10.240]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:21.760]  it's election day 2022 as the american people attempt to rash control of their country from the
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:28.720]  wf and the new world order the national polls show close to half the americans know there's a new
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:34.640]  world order and it's their enemy so it'll be 78 make no mistake we're winning but the enemy is
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:42.800]  going to double down david ike listed last week as a terrorist in the e u for calling for peace
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:48.400]  and justice joins us exclusively and we're very honored to have him david you were getting into
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:51.680]  the netherlands and they're war on farmers they're war on food production what that means for the
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:56.560]  world and this deep population agenda and then your new prime minister they already had one for
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:00.720]  a few months shoveled her around now they've got another one this guy's a total globalist calling
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:07.840]  for s e g's carbon taxes uh just absolute nightmare talk about the w e f and how that which is really
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:13.120]  run by the builder group now they put these puppets in as claus Schwab says we penetrate the cabinets
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:22.080]  yeah i mean what's happening is you know i've come on this show alex with you so many times over
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:28.240]  the decades and we've talked about how a few people are controlling the direction of human society
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:35.600]  and the closer they come to their end goal the more they have to put themselves on public display
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:42.160]  and the world economic forum i mean if anyone looks at that i i was reading the other day
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:49.040]  oh no the world economic forum it's a conspiracy theory oh really so you have young leader schools
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:57.280]  run by that forum and that guy claus Schwab um and they just happen to turn up in positions of power
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:03.600]  all over the world like trudo and arden in new zealand and macron in france and on and on it goes
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:08.160]  and then the w e f brags that they control everything on and then you get banned from europe
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:14.800]  for saying it it's i mean it's ridiculous i mean it talk about on public display i mean the netherlands
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:24.080]  this guy mark rutter is a total agent for the world economic forum in britain now we have another
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:31.360]  in rishi sunak and the chancellor of the ex jecker guy called jeremy hunt is the same and they are
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:39.840]  going to push this world economic forum agenda the great reset in britain at a very fast pace now
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:48.800]  as these other clones around the world um are doing and so um you you look at the um the people
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:55.520]  that run the so-called individual countries and as you know i was saying in a speech um on line to
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:02.320]  people in the netherlands over the weekend these people like rutter and trudo and macron they're
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:11.680]  not your prime minister or president they're not their agents of this central cabal and they therefore
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:19.040]  represent the interests and the agenda of that cabal which is why they do so many things constantly
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:25.760]  that are against the interests of the people of the country that's why they do it oh well why are
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:32.800]  they doing that why is this guy rutter um trying to destroy hundreds and hundreds of dutch farmers
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:38.240]  i mean why would he do that in which it makes no sense well it does when you realize he's not the
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:45.200]  prime minister of the netherlands he's the agent in the netherlands for the world economic forum so
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:52.080]  that's why he's doing it world economic forum wants to destroy farming they then he destroys farming
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:58.880]  and when the penny drops that these leaders we've got now as i say sunak in britain and and in the
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:04.560]  wings is a guy called kia starmer leader of the labor party if he gets in and there is a chance
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:11.760]  at some point then he'll turn um britain into what the democrats have turned america into
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:17.760]  because the democrats are totally controlled by this cult and that's why they have devastated
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:23.680]  destroyed america that's why they've opened the southern border that's because they want to change
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:29.280]  the demographic of america as they're changing the demographic of europe that's why they have um
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:37.840]  a targeted fossil fuels to destroy access to energy and push the price up massively of what
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:45.360]  you do have access to it's about dismantling western society well global society too but western
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:50.400]  society and by the way we've got all the energy heads in europe the eu the uk everywhere the us
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:54.560]  saying we're we're we're involved in the transition but they're not even giving us something to
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:59.440]  transition to so what's the end game of their collapse of civilization and how is it going for
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:09.280]  them well the the point being that if you want to introduce a totally different system in the world
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:15.920]  you've got to dismantle and destroy the one that went before i call it creative destruction
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:22.640]  you have a status quo and then you destroy that status quo and create another that's what happened
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:29.120]  with the first world war for instance then you had the second world war and the status quo changed
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:35.280]  again and you had all these global institutions like the imf the world bank the britain woods
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:42.960]  agreement and all that stuff and and and you go on destroying status quos uh at nine 11 massively
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:51.120]  destroyed a status quo in uh in in america all going forward towards what is called this great
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:59.120]  reset which is basically we're not basically it's a global centralized tyranny in which the entirety
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:08.240]  of uh humankind will be connected to a um an ai artificial intelligence system which will do all
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:15.520]  their thinking for them they won't have to manipulate um information any longer once that happens
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:24.160]  because people's perceptions will come direct through ai and uh this is what's unfolding in
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:31.440]  front of our eyes while people are watching the sport or or campaigning to stop me having any uh
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:37.360]  uh platform to speak and it's unbelievable absolutely what do you make of the new uk prime
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:45.200]  minister the level of moron it takes not to see it now is absolutely extraordinary and you can only
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:51.840]  say they have to be and they are under a form of mass mind control and mass psychosis it's the only
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:57.360]  way of explaining it when it's here in your face and you can't see it then uh you're obviously not
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:02.720]  in control of your own mind in any way shape or form david i want to talk elon mus next segment
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:10.560]  but just briefly the new uk prime minister what do you make of him oh he's he's an absolute uh uh
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:19.280]  gopher for this um for this agenda you go um into his family through his wife and and you go into the
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:27.680]  very uh companies i think they call it infosys which um are providing the very technology
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:34.880]  for this um social credit system he's into it up to his neck that's why they they've managed to
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:40.960]  manipulate him in there through a number of others another uh johnson and then this is trust lady
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:46.640]  that that stayed around for five minutes that's that's what they're doing they they get their people
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:53.840]  and they put them in positions of power what we have alex now in britain is rishi sunak
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:28:00.720]  who was the chancellor of the ex jecker that devastated the british economy when he was um
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:08.800]  the chancellor through the covid era and now he's saying we've got to have pain and cutbacks and
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:15.600]  tax increases and cutting benefits of various kinds because we've got a massive economic problem
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:23.120]  yes which you bloody cause me this is what they do they create the problem and then somehow
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:28.720]  they put themselves forward as the person to solve the problem that they've created exactly how
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:33.680]  this system was perfect example is the un world lockdowns hundreds of millions starving to death
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:37.920]  and then they say there's a global starvation problem david ike david ike dot com alex jones
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:44.160]  then full wars dot com spread those links we come back you've got a lot to say about elon musk and
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:50.720]  so we're going to be going over all that with david ike straight ahead because he sold as the savior
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:55.040]  but what's really going on with elon musk we'll discuss it on the other side stay with us
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:06.320]  until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and died in
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:12.720]  many cases in the winter because of something called vapors they associated these poisonous
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:19.120]  vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:27.200]  what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:33.200]  produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3 and
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:37.920]  then it's very easy for viruses and other things you start replicating and taking your body over
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:42.720]  so now it's more important than ever because the winter's here to take high quality vitamin d3 and

[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:00.800]  gonna have a whole bunch of other big guests tonight you don't want to miss this broadcast but
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:08.080]  david ike is our guest david you've been a big critic of ilan musk and i want to hope and believe
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:16.560]  he's a good guy then you balance out some of the bad things he's done the good things it's it pretty
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:24.400]  much a wash in my view but definitely he's promoting globalism in many ways and now that he's taken
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:28.320]  over twitter i'll give him some time but you've got some twitter news on that front but you put a
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:37.920]  meme out last week cult owned ilan musk is free speech hero some questions you see the cult of
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:47.440]  driverless vehicle agenda the cult of 5g 6g 7g from space smart grid the neural link brain
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:54.800]  ships with ai to control our minds why would cult owned twitter sell to musk well they acted like
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:35:02.320]  they fought it but what is your view is he knew or 2.0 more sophisticated acts like he's our friend
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:07.920]  but he isn't what do you think's really going on with ilan musk i wouldn't try i wouldn't trust
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:14.080]  him to tell by the time in a room full of clocks mate um his grandfather was um the head of the
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:21.600]  technocracy movement and the technocracy party in america in a canada rather in the 1930s um
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:27.760]  just as uh you know bezos was connected with his grandfather to the forerunner of darpa
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:33.520]  i mean these people don't get uh to their billionaire status by accident they get there because
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:39.760]  of what they're doing and those um examples i gave you i mean it's quite simple it's never
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:45.280]  mind this i'm not i'm not interested in what you're saying mate i'm interested in what you're doing
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:54.080]  by their actions shall you see them and uh you look at the uh the tesla agenda electric cars
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:36:01.120]  driverless cars that's absolutely straight off the script of the cult because a driverless car
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:06.560]  is not taken to its destination by you if it's the wrong destination you're not going there
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:12.400]  because the computer is going to decide where you can and cannot go and and you cannot have
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:17.680]  driverless cars with petrol engines and diesel engines you've got to it's got to be electrical
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:23.760]  and that's that so he's pushing that agenda then um he's putting up these low orbit satellites in
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:32.400]  vast and increasing numbers to fire um 5g etc etc at the at the earth and that's to create
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:38.800]  every inch of the planet being hit by what they call the cloud and it's the cloud that people
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:45.840]  are supposed to be connected to not least by the uh nanotechnology self replicating in the body of
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:53.920]  those who've been vaccinated so um it's he's pushing that agenda of the the driverless cars
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:37:00.480]  he's fronting up the agenda for the smart grid the cloud without which it wouldn't be possible
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:08.880]  you can't cover the whole earth with um 5g towers but you can from space and then he's talking about
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:16.960]  oh yeah well AI could be the end of humanity yes mate yes it could so why are you starting
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:24.320]  a company called Neuralink to connect um computers to the human brain why are you doing that
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:32.960]  i've been pointing out for decades that the agenda is to move people into tiny tiny micro houses
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:41.360]  micro homes um and and um out of the way we live now and he's pushing micro homes and producing
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:49.360]  micro homes everywhere you look with musk you're looking at the script of this global cult and so
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:54.640]  so when he's talking about free speech and he's going to take over twitter and he's going to do
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:38:01.760]  this that the other i don't believe it it's all that again you know when uh he he took over uh
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:09.200]  my son gareth was was told well you know first of all uh you need to um uh ask them to reinstate
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:16.960]  your um your dad's um account which was taken down in 2020 um but but that's going to take a while
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:24.080]  so the best thing to do is just just to start a new account so so he did a david eye official it
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:33.600]  lasted 12 hours and it was down and we heard today a few hours ago that uh twitter have said that
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:40.320]  they are not going to reinstate my account that was taken down in 2020 because i um breached their
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:48.880]  rules as a result of uh questioning the whole covid hoax so um i'm not going back on twitter uh and
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:56.560]  anyone else who's saying anything i mean let's just let's just just take a calm look at this twitter
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:06.000]  was owned by the cultists and that's why twitter has been such a dramatic sensor of um information
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:14.720]  that is challenging the cult agenda so why would they not only why would they sell to elon musk
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:20.080]  why would they threaten to go to court to make him buy it when he was apparently going on
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:27.280]  not so sure now with the bots and stuff why does a cult owned organization are they going to the
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:31.680]  censoring on behalf of the cult are they going to say oh we're going to sell it to someone
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:37.200]  who'll put free speech back is anyone having a laugh and the other kind of back no i agree and
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.200]  i'm not defending him but remember he he said we shouldn't get rid of humans we need to have a
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.680]  higher birth rate he said don't take the case he said he's not going to take the covid shot he
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:51.520]  doesn't trust it he does all that stuff i'm not interested in that i'm interested in action
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:59.600]  and and that's what i i i look at him about anyone can say that but actually playing it out
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:06.880]  no i hear you i'm just playing devil's advocate yeah i know you are but the thing about musk
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:14.480]  is that um he's pushing the the agenda on every level but we're asked to believe that
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:19.600]  when it comes to free speech at destruction which is the very foundation of how this agenda is
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:24.880]  coming in so it can't be exposed but he's gonna take a totally different so let me ask this question
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:28.640]  where's the globalist average people just say screw you we're taking your rides
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:32.400]  we're killing everybody world government why is he acting like he's against it
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:42.160]  well if you um want um to control a game then and you want to know what the outcome is going to be
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:46.160]  what the score is going to be before the first board you're saying he's being set up his loyal
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:51.280]  opposition it's no good i don't think he's being set up i think he knows exactly what he's doing
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:56.480]  you you have to control not one side no i don't think he's being set up i mean he they're setting
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:02.480]  him up as the loyal opposition yeah well yeah that but in part that that's that's what we're
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:08.400]  talking about you know the the the free speech friend well he's not my speech for his friend
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:13.600]  obviously but the other thing the other backstop that they have you see because the the coal owns
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:19.840]  governments and the european union is already kicking off um they are um pushing back against
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:23.200]  twitter and saying oh no you know you can't do this you're not going to be allowed to do this
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:27.280]  you know the people aren't going to be allowed to do that so he's got that backstop to say well
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:32.560]  i really wanted free speech but of course i can't you know now uh because of the you know what
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:37.760]  governments and what have you were doing i mean he's got ways of um explaining it away but he's
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:43.920]  he's not got ways of explaining away the fact that he's um stopping people questioning the
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:48.320]  seriously he's kind of the next level of the new world order he acts like he's our friend but he is
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:54.880]  yeah well you know and you know you know my views on on donald trump i mean i think what donald
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:42:01.360]  trump said uh recently uh when he called de santis de sanctimonious was an absolute bloody
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:07.600]  disgrace we supposed to be coming together and in supporting each other you know it's not about
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:14.880]  you mr trump it's not about your power and your ego it's about bringing this down and de santis
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:22.880]  did not um trigger or support and promote operation warp speed that has killed so many people with a
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:28.800]  fake vaccine and destroyed the health of even more he was pushing back on lockdown he's pushing back
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:32.480]  on the way i'm not saying de santis is perfect i want to talk about him when you come back it's
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:37.840]  true that the talking point is that de santis is spelling bones we looked it up he's not a spelling
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:42.720]  bones member that's being put out it's not true david i stand there we'll talk about trump you read
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:48.000]  my mind i was about to say what about trump and you said trump that is wild so we're definitely
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.400]  synced up david i can stay right there and then we got all the election news a bunch of stuffs
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:43:00.320]  built up here a bunch of video clips and so much more stay with us in arizona i think we watched
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:08.560]  the election be uh stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:15.760]  absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we we just it's election month alex it's not
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:23.120]  election day and that's the problem and everything changed after covet 19 they illegally changed
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:29.760]  state elections mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:34.480]  to people well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious country when we have
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:39.440]  elections that can be stolen like this and i believe that just like i believe the election
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:45.280]  was stolen in 2020 and i have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media and
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:51.440]  the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity and question the the fact that
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:57.600]  elections shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election realists

[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:42.480]  so i don't put my trust in leaders especially on have a long track record well there are good
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:46.720]  people on this planet there's not just evil so we shouldn't give up hope but it's the individual
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:53.600]  action that really changes the world but i was literally we didn't talk before the broadcast
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:58.000]  but that's what david on for weeks before even got listed as a terrorist by the uu
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.480]  and then he agreed last week to come on today i was literally about to say
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:07.920]  trump versus the sanis he goes let's take trump and the sanis out of a thousand topics
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:11.840]  he went right there so i'm not naive but i hear the saying oh the sanis of skull and bones but
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:17.280]  looked it up didn't wasn't skull and bones it's not true not saying the sanis is perfect i'm not
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:22.720]  naive but yeah trump like oh the sanctimonious over there i'm not wedded to trump i'm not the
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:27.280]  trump cult i think trump did some good things i don't think he's working for him but i think he's
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:32.720]  very egotistical and can be manipulated so i want david ike's take on ron the sanis versus
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:40.320]  donald trump or you see this going well i mean i've been uh less than a trump fan since he was
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:47.360]  running for office you know when when he was being promoted as the the maverick president well he
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:52.960]  started off with the best part of 20 candidates against him to win the republican nomination
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:59.440]  and we were told that he uh was not wanted by the republican party and that he was a maverick
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:03.840]  and an outsider and all that well you look at his background he's not he's not an outsider
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:10.320]  but he he got the um he got the nomination and when he got the nomination i thought this guy's
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:18.480]  gonna win uh because at the same time you had wiki leaks um revealing documents and emails that
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:25.520]  showed that the democratic party was stitching it up for hillary clinton um and uh making sure that
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:34.000]  she was going to be the candidate uh and and and the rest were not going to make it um and so if
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:39.760]  they could do it and they did quite clearly um then the republican party could have done it
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:45.280]  if they really wanted to stop trump there would be many ways they could have stopped trump but
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:52.160]  they didn't and he got in and he's been used that was used to divide america i'm not saying he knows
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:58.720]  that but that he he's been used to divide america and so you've got this real division now between
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:06.720]  anti trump and pro trump and i look and you know it i keep saying about you know by their
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:15.280]  action shall they you know them um it was blatantly obvious to um anyone looking on that this fake
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:22.720]  vaccine was going to be um a bio weapon obvious that it was going to be devastating in terms of
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:28.480]  fatality and health exactly what it's become and so we had operation warp speed which prompt
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:36.560]  chump promoted and um is still um saying get vaccinated the last i heard him um despite the the
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:41.200]  figures and the data for the deaths and the destroyed health that we've seen so i look at
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:46.480]  that and i think well either he knows what he's doing or he doesn't know what he's doing either
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:52.880]  way i don't want him as president personally because um i think we can do better and then i i looked
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:51:01.040]  at um uh ron de santis and like i said earlier you look at what he does he uh has um he was the
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:07.360]  one that kept florida open as one of the most open states in america during the coveted fascist
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:15.120]  lockdowns um he has pushed back on mandates for the fake vaccine he's he's said through his um
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:22.080]  medical team that the children etc shouldn't have this vaccine etc and he's he's pushed back and
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:30.400]  and it invoked laws to to stop the sexualization of children and the um the gender activist
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:37.920]  programming of children and the mutilation of um and sterilization of children in the name of
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:46.400]  transgender he's done all this he's not talked about it he's done it he highlighted um the the
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:52.240]  southern border uh and the abomination that happened the illegals and martha's vineyard
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:55.920]  don't know and i agree that de santa said you look at her report cards doing way better than
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:02.000]  trump sorry go ahead this is a guy who does things and i i don't know he's he's total background
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:08.960]  or anything like that i but i'm just looking on and i'm thinking trump talks de santis does
[01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:14.160]  and therefore i know who i'd prefer to be uh president of the united states because if the
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:22.480]  democrats aren't completely trump uh uh um the cult owned the point being though that america
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:28.160]  is a one-party state just like britain is but there are elements within the republican party
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:34.640]  especially new people coming in tonight hopefully to get elected i think uh kerry lake in uh arizona
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:38.480]  uh he's a breath of fresh air in in so many ways that other beats yet so let me ask this
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:42.240]  will be five months the next hour but but if you do it but let me let me ask this now with six
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:48.960]  minutes to break when i look at china with half their country had a lockdown for two and a half years
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:55.120]  uh something like 400 million under lock now they're building these giant camps everywhere
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:53:00.000]  putting everybody in them they're building other similar un directed camps all over the western
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:05.520]  world and i looked at that last night and i said what are they planning what are they knows coming
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:10.320]  then i read the comments almost every comment is what is china knows coming i'm not saying they're
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:14.160]  trying to protect the people i'm not saying the chinese comments are good but is something about
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:19.280]  to metamorphosize out of the virus or is something even bigger about to come i mean what is china
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:26.160]  spending trillions on is it slave training to lock them down gut level david iker at a
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:34.800]  discernment level what is going on well i mean i've been saying for so so long um decades if
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:41.760]  you want to see the what's planned for the west tomorrow look at china today what's uh happened
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:49.200]  with the mal revolution which is i i say was a cult revolution and the reason for it was to
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:55.280]  create a um i said david rongefeller said the cia ran it it's all been it's a hundred percent globalist
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:54:05.200]  yeah so china was the chinese revolution with mal was to create a a society a controlled
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:15.120]  society within which you could incubate a system of total human mass control which when it's
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:21.680]  perfected and incubated you then play out across the world so if you look at what's happening or
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:30.640]  has happened since the coveted hoax as i would suggest um the west has become more and indeed
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:36.800]  the rest of the world too but particularly the west more and more and more like china and that's
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:45.920]  because the chinese perfected incubated system of control not least using um ai for uh real time
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:54.720]  surveillance is coming westward so anything they're doing now in china the reason to watch it
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:55:01.920]  like a hawk is because whatever's happening there is planned here so china today the west tomorrow
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:10.320]  they're perfecting this system so people those with um uh vibrating jelly like backbones that can
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:15.920]  see that it's not what they want but they're terrified of actually uh doing anything about it
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:23.280]  if you think it's bad now look at china now and where that's going because that's come in here
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:32.160]  if you go on um refusing to stand up and be counted david what else you imparted a lot of
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:34.800]  really hardcore knowledge today what else do you want to get across people
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:46.160]  well you know i keep coming back to this this this theme that i've been going on about all
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:55.200]  these years we're just about to pass eight billion people a few cannot control them without the
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:56:03.360]  acquiescence and these the um the the way that the people just um do what they're told and the
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:07.600]  power structure scared of you and myself and a few others which means we're the antidote
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:18.480]  yeah but look at it people you know you're frightened to to take this on well look at how
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:25.360]  frightened this system is of these individuals who do take it on and and do communicate what they
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:32.000]  don't want to hear just think what it would be like if more and more of the the rest of the
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:38.320]  population started doing the same and saying we're not having it we're not cooperating no
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:44.640]  we're not doing what you say anything you're telling us to do which is about um enslaving us and
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:50.880]  further destroying uh what's left of freedom we are not cooperating you're not going to
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:56.480]  enslave our kids for the rest of their lives and our grandkids you're not going to do it
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:03.120]  we're not going to have it and if people in enough numbers just did that the game would be over
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:10.720]  the game is played in the human mind that's why everything's about psychological manipulation
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:17.520]  we take our minds back we take our backbones back and we say we're not having it and it's over even
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:22.560]  at this stage it's over all right david stay there do five more minutes back in two minutes i want to

[02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:14.720]  but nowhere else david ike i was asked here in the break what is most important in the closing
[02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:24.560]  comments you said this election tonight david ike yeah it's it's a really big day uh for america
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:30.880]  this because if the democrats that are completely controlled and owned by this cult i mean great
[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:36.480]  chunks of the republican party are also but there are people within the republican party
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:43.120]  who who can see some of it and are prepared to push back against it but if the democrats go on
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:49.920]  in power for much longer then america will be finished they'll complete the job that they've
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:58.320]  set out when biden uh officially came to power to do the southern border the economy uh energy
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:05.760]  everything that it's about destroying america that's what they're there to do and so tonight is um
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:15.360]  it's vital that that power is taken away and we have others who are looking at this in a in a
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:24.080]  different way and and if the republicans do get decent good people into office today the first
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:32.480]  thing they should start doing is getting rid of that bloody useless useless cult owned republican
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:38.720]  leadership on capitol hill because that at that point where the democrats meet the republican
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:45.520]  leadership they are the same bloody party i mean someone told me that liz cheney was a republican
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:51.680]  i laughed i mean she's a cultist that's why she has been pushing what she's been pushing
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:02:00.000]  she's not a republican she's a one-party stator just like so many of them and so today um it's
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:05.280]  so important that the democrats lose power i mean you know i i don't operate in the political level
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:12.560]  of you know it's all you know a game but in this case getting uh resting power from the democrats
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:22.960]  is absolutely uh vital and again as in 20 in 2020 you're going to have as we are already seeing it
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:29.120]  would seem you're gonna have a massive massive effort to scam this election because they've
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:35.040]  lost the people in terms of the majority they have and so the only way they can do it is to scam it
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:42.560]  and um they'll they'll have this organization to do so in place for a long time
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:53.440]  and so uh yeah that's um that's what i would say to um to people in america that um you know looking
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:03:01.760]  from afar it's not my country if the democrats continue in power then it's it's going to be
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:06.560]  uh at the end of america and then if you're like me you can go on for an hour i stepped away to the
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:11.280]  printer machine 30 feet away while you were talking to articles i'm printing i was listening to you
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:19.200]  intently to my earpiece uh so so so so in closing this is a human beachhead against tyranny
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:23.680]  there's a global awakening are you overall optimistic with a minute and a half left about
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:30.320]  humanity's awakening and you talked about time frames on my show 15 years ago should it be a big
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:37.120]  away thing in 2016 a counter strike in 2020 and by 2026 or so we'd know whether we'd beat him or not
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:43.200]  do you still stand by those numbers that have already come through so far i absolutely do and
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:50.880]  you know it's it's about perspective too i mean i remember what it was like in 1990 91 92 93 and
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:58.160]  on through the 90s and across the millennium uh in terms of getting interest in uh this information
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:04.640]  and people becoming aware that actually the world wasn't like they thought it was but today it's it's

[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:29.520]  six o'clock seven o'clock eight o'clock so we see the machines go down and the classic
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:35.600]  fraud the key battleground areas where democrats are losing it's happening the last three four hours
[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:43.520]  i have endless videos endless news reports in pennsylvania in michigan in arizona in georgia
[02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:52.240]  in wisconsin everywhere where republicans are winning in massive numbers as the polls showed
[02:06:52.240 --> 02:07:00.720]  the machines are all failing and falling apart here's a short clip out america of a county that
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:07.040]  key area that turns the state blue everything else is red you can vote democrat but not republican
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:12.080]  and this is what they're confirming so the glitches are you can only vote democrat to turn the voters
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:16.880]  away so they go away then they turn the machines back on and god knows what they've done here it is
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:25.520]  what i'll say i i don't understand what you just said okay okay with with this election
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:30.720]  you can vote in any precinct you said the republican side is not what we i don't have
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:35.600]  stats so we are closed right now so for the democrat i can vote democrat they vote democrat
[02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:43.040]  but not republican that republic i'm sorry okay all right thank you so you can vote democrat
[02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:49.280]  but you can't vote republican we have dozens of videos same thing happening and that's why
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:54.480]  biden said don't get mad don't be a terrorist you're gonna lose and featherman said i don't
[02:07:54.480 --> 02:08:01.600]  care if i'm ten points behind in polls i'm gonna win tonight and their computer system that monitors
[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:06.880]  at the state level to make sure people don't vote multiple times it went down as well so that's
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:12.640]  coming up after our guest leaves us but i i pledged here and then after this hour it's
[02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:17.200]  going to be all election news right past midnight tonight i pledged to myself not to get distracted
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:24.560]  from the big issues and that is whether you are in germany or whether you're in sweden or whether
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:31.920]  you're in the u.s or canada or australia it's all the same numbers a whole stack of news on this
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:37.280]  bombshell government reports cupboard shots causing massive infertility miscarriages and
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:43.920]  stillbirths and the numbers all track the same whether it's germany sweden the united states
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:51.440]  and in places like israel and australia where it's even higher uptake of the shot the numbers
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:55.680]  are even higher 82 of pregnant women who got vaccinated for covid during first and second
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:02.880]  trimesters suffered miscarriages new england journal of medicine it goes on and on so joining
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:07.680]  us as a former member of hardlement in australia george christensen is up the middle of the night
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:14.640]  in australia valiantly fought against him just got targeted removed from office by him and he's
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:19.760]  he's here with us to talk about the numbers that aren't debatable this is all confirmed it's not a
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:25.040]  theory to talk about the numbers of stillbirths and miscarriages in australia because again we're
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:29.280]  all interconnected this is happening to everybody where they rolled this out george thank you so
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:35.760]  much for joining us well thank you very much alex and we're certainly hoping here in australia that
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:41.040]  there's a victory for freedom in your midterm elections over there i know that's very important
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.720]  well tell us what you're seeing in australia with stillbirths and miscarriages
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:53.760]  yeah look the australian bureau of statistics collects data on various different things and
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:10:00.720]  one of them that they collect is on births and there's a chart which is just come to light
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:09.280]  in recent days which shows on average every month there is between roughly 23 to 25 000
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:16.560]  births and that's been going on for a long long time alex down here but interestingly the data
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:24.240]  only goes up until november of 2021 now december rather of 2021 and what we see in november and
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:32.640]  december are two substantial drops in november of 2021 the birth rate goes from 23 000 which is
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:39.280]  ordinary in october that's sort of on the lower end of normal but it drops in november of 2021
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:47.840]  down to 18186 births now that's a 25 drop and a shocking in itself but then in december
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:59.280]  the record that they've got there is 6659 births so a drop from an ordinary rate of 23 to say 25
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:08.000]  26 000 births per month to 6659 births as recorded by the australian bureau of statistics that's a
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:15.360]  72 decrease in births and surprise surprise i'm seeing nothing about this in the mainstream
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:22.720]  media no discussion around uh nothing from the abs is to explain and what staggering is whether
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:28.640]  you're in israel australia canada the u.s germany sweden uk it's it the the graphs are almost identical
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:34.400]  i mean we've never seen a drop in 100 years since statistics like this well that's right it's
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:40.880]  extraordinary now look i have some people who are statisticians and economists that have looked over
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:47.600]  this and they've said to me to be careful with the with the december data which is extremely low
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:57.520]  but they said that the november data the 18186 or 25 drop on on the lower end of normal they said
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:04.800]  that that is the one to look at that that's still a massive drop 25 reduction in the birth rate in
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:12.400]  one month and then we go into that 72 reduction which could be alex that there is more data to
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:22.320]  come in but i'm a bit suspect about that claim because you know we're now here in november 2022
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:29.120]  and you would think that the data for december 2021 for births would all be there in the official
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:34.960]  statistical agency for the nation of australia but that's where we have it and it look this this
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:41.760]  goes to uh other things which i became aware of as a member of parliament and it only confirms my
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:49.280]  suspicions i knew of a doctor in brisbane his name was dr luke mclendon uh he wasn't just any
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:54.720]  old doctor he was a specialist in fertility health uh in fact he was the president of the
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:01.840]  australian institute for restorative reproductive medicine uh he was fired from brisbane's martyr
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:08.080]  hospital and there's a lot of questions about why he was fired before he was fired i actually met
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:14.880]  with him and he told me that he was doing research into the cohort of women uh that he works with
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:21.840]  as a doctor and that cohort of women is people who or women who if they haven't had a baby and
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:26.720]  they've been trying to have a baby for over 12 months they're put into a particular subset
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:34.560]  within the sort of fertility health sector and that subset subset normally has a miscarriage
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:39.520]  rate of around 13 to 15 percent and that's something that's known internationally with this
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:46.080]  particular subset uh but when he's or post vaccination in australia you've got to remember
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:52.000]  our vaccination rates were said to be up around 96 percent for the adult population so a lot of
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:57.120]  jabbed people out there uh and and they said you know there's no issues go and get it if you're
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:05.600]  pregnant so he looked at his cohort of patients and he saw that the number had jumped from 15 percent
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:11.680]  to almost half of his patients that were having miscarriages he dug into the data a bit deeper
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:16.960]  alex and what he found was when he separated the vaccinated from the non-vaccinated patients
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:24.240]  that amongst the unvaccinated it was the normal 15 percent miscarriage rate amongst the vaccinated
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:32.400]  women that miscarriage rate went up to 75 percent now he has the data well that's what the new england
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:38.480]  journal of medicine showed 82 percent i mean this is the biggest naked scandal it's not even not
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:45.360]  hidden they admit it how would they think they'd get away with this george well just like this guy
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:49.360]  they've they've fired him they've they've swept it under the carpet they've stopped his research
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:55.600]  and stopped him from being able to uh publish as a credential doctor i guess so you know that they're
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:01.760]  trying to sweep it under the carpet but as i said with the data from the abs we've heard absolutely
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:09.040]  nothing about the 25 drop in the birth rate in november 2021 we've heard nothing about the 72
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:16.560]  percent drop in december 2021 so it really is bizarre and i don't know alex how long this sort
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:23.120]  of silence from government from big corporate media how long it can go on for but because
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:29.440]  with shows like yours with an array of of new independent media coming onto the market including
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:35.280]  here in australia uh this information is getting out there and it's there right there nation first

[02:20:59.840 --> 02:21:06.400]  country and people not able to vote and so much more this is a revolution a peaceful revolution
[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:12.800]  they're trying to block it george christensen 35 000 foot view of australia the main battleground
[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:20.880]  an island prison colony uh rising from the ashes back to its previous tyranny from from the great
[02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:27.040]  decades and decades of freedom you've had to some extent what has happened since all the draconian
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:32.880]  forced injections and police beating people up and banning demonstrations are australians
[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:36.400]  is brushing themselves off and forgetting what happened to them so they can come back and do it
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:40.720]  again or or are they angry what's what's happening to bring the criminals to justice
[02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:45.920]  well there's a large number of people that have just unfortunately brushed themselves
[02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:52.480]  off and tried to forget about it but on the positive side i mean amongst the freedom movement as we
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:58.720]  call it here in australia amongst that freedom movement there's been a coalescing and this is
[02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:04.720]  good to see they're out in force now in state elections which we've got coming up to try and
[02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:11.840]  oust those leaders those political leaders that actually rode roughshod over people's rights
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:19.360]  such as victoria's daniel andrews he's definitely in the firing line so to speak he was the one
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:26.640]  who authorized police officers to go and shoot projectiles at people bashed little old ladies
[02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:31.920]  in the street that sort of thing choke women you know who weren't wearing masks this sort of thing
[02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:38.080]  was beyond the pale so people are now trying to get their their payback at the ballot box and
[02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:44.240]  buying being active in elections so that's really good to see alex but yeah sadly there are a lot
[02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:50.960]  of people who just tried to put it down the memory hole unfortunately that that sort of
[02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:56.160]  attitude has a way of coming back to bite you because in the media just recently what we've
[02:22:56.160 --> 02:23:01.440]  had is speculation that there could be another round of lockdowns before christmas and that
[02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:07.760]  was speculated by none other than the chief health officer for australia so here we go again
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:13.600]  perhaps but i think that there'll be so much pushback on that if it was to happen that it
[02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:19.920]  might just break the back of the whole medico tyranny that's been going on and and so they
[02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:25.360]  probably won't go there because they know that there will be immense pushback and you've also
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:30.800]  got just like the netherlands the wef agenda of banning cows and sheep because of their evil
[02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:37.600]  methane gases they let off what's happening there yeah well the same that the government here is
[02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:47.920]  signed up signed up completely to the climate change cult they have agreed to to ban or to
[02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:54.640]  significantly lower methane emissions that is going to definitely impact on australian livestock
[02:23:54.640 --> 02:24:00.000]  australian cattle australian sheep what have you the farmers out there are incredibly worried the
[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:04.160]  government hasn't said how this is going to happen yet but we've seen how it's happened in other
[02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:10.800]  countries and how it's happened in other countries is by the culling of the herd uh and so whether
[02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:16.000]  or not we're going to have farmers uh have their livestock head limited uh they'll have to go out
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:21.440]  and actually shoot those animals or or euthanasium some way uh that potentially is on the cards
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:25.360]  they're the government saying they're not going to do that but i just don't understand how they're
[02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:30.800]  going to meet those methane because they're saying the the farts are bad well that's always
[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:35.040]  been part of our atmosphere we've always had bovine the buffalo every country has its own you
[02:24:35.040 --> 02:24:40.080]  know animals roaming around they're literally just listing what we put off as creatures on the
[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:45.200]  planet is bad to outlaws and regulators and say we're criminals i mean this is this is preposterous
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:50.880]  well i want us to eat bugs alex and down under here we we actually are eating bugs i mean
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:55.920]  in schools and this wasn't even communicated properly to parents but there are a whole host of
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:25:01.200]  schools where they same thing with the netherlands same thing with canada they just feed them bugs at
[02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:06.560]  lunch and don't ask the parents that's right that's what happened down here it was exposed uh
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:12.800]  a whole heap of schools where the kids through their canteen were being fed uh bug-based foods uh
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:17.920]  that is disgusting uh the parents should have been informed but more than just being disgusting
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:25.120]  there's health issues because we know that there's uh that these bugs are are unhealthy that they
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:31.200]  have um potentially cancer causing side effects uh from eating it on a long-term basis so uh the
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:36.240]  fact that this is being done to school kids just shows the evil intent here i mean they can't do
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:41.360]  it to the populace so we'll prep the youngsters uh in this well that's right for those that don't know
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:48.240]  the exoskeleton of bugs is highly carcinogenic and toxic toxic unless your gut's designed as an
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:52.880]  insectivore and not many creatures are humans don't eat bugs because we're not designed to
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:26:01.760]  do we have a revulsion of it because it's toxic and they made those kids do it alexa made uh
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:06.960]  you know innocent kids across australian schools eat their stuff uh without their parents knowing
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:11.680]  and uh and and yet uh we haven't had all hell break loose in a populace so i'm going to tell you
[02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:16.160]  if it was one of my children that was uh going to school where that's happened the the principal
[02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:20.800]  probably wouldn't be standing so so how are the going back to my previous question how angry are
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:24.560]  australians i mean is there any pushback against the criminals and what they've done
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:31.280]  oh i think that the yes there is i mean there's a lot of pushback there are a lot of people that
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:37.840]  want to see some form of justice whether we see that or not yet is yet to be seen uh there was
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:44.000]  a small inquiry that was held into covid it did find that there was a serious government
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:48.960]  overreach so that's a good thing are any heads going to roll over it no so there's been a
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:56.320]  continual call for a royal commission our royal commission has wide-ranging powers they can recommend
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:27:01.760]  charges uh be be put against people and so uh you know there's a lot of us that are still
[02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:06.960]  pushing for something like that but the problem with it is alex that uh we we move away from one
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:13.600]  problem and then another another problems put before us right now the government is using
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:20.720]  a whole spate of very conveniently timed cyber attacks or hacks on big businesses
[02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:26.320]  to push for a digital identity system to be introduced in a compulsory way here in australia
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:31.520]  and so that's the next fight that's looming for freedom here and you know we we've had all of these
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:36.160]  major hacks that have happened in a very short period of time it's very strange how that happens
[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:39.680]  and of course the government then stands up and says we'll be your white knight we'll protect
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:45.200]  you australian public we'll we'll get all of your data and we'll we'll put it into a into a hub for
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:52.240]  safekeeping uh we'll make you do it compulsorily uh and it sort of beggars belief because if they
[02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:57.360]  can hack these major companies i think they could hack the australian government as well and get all
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:02.400]  the data that's kept centrally so it doesn't make sense it's not about protecting people this is about
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:07.760]  again trampling over our freedoms trampling over our privacy it's about big government big
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:13.840]  brother alex that's all we can see so uh to answer your question the movement is angry the movement
[02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:18.880]  is out there punching on in elections the movement is uh wanting to take down some of the people
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:24.560]  responsible for this medico tyranny we saw in australia but the movement's also going to be aware
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:28.640]  of the challenges that are coming around the corner and they're constantly coming out as alex
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:35.360]  well i really want to appreciate you george christensen for what you're doing and we're
[02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:39.760]  all australian what you've gone through it's like we're all north korean anybody under tyranny
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:44.400]  is going to be us tomorrow we're all communist chinese because that really is the model for the
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:49.760]  planet uh and we really appreciate you sir thank you so much for everything you do we'll put your
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:55.600]  sub stack up on screen because it's so incredibly important and i hope everybody uh we'll visit
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:29:02.880]  your site nationfirst.substack.com until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world believe
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:09.200]  that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors
[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:16.080]  they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold weather or
[02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:22.720]  catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3 you see
[02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:29.840]  the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting enough sun
[02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:34.640]  you will not produce vitamin d3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:39.600]  replicating and taking your body over so now it's more important than ever because the winter's here
[02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:44.800]  to take high quality vitamin d3 and we have the best with our vitamin d3 gummies with calcium

[02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:08.960]  victories tonight possible the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible
[02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:14.320]  the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school
[02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:20.240]  shutdowns and and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible it made any resistance
[02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:26.320]  to it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite the massive lawfare being
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:32.480]  waged against info wars despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against info wars the
[02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:37.520]  ordinary people the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier
[02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:43.360]  wealthier and wiser is what keeps info wars on the air and what that does is keep the populist
[02:30:43.360 --> 02:30:49.760]  message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression so continue to do it go to places like
[02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:55.200]  infowarstore.com go to the places like save info wars continue to keep info wars alive
[02:30:55.200 --> 02:30:58.720]  because in the process you're keeping american liberty alive.
[02:30:58.720 --> 02:31:05.680]  in arizona i think we watched the election be uh stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these
[02:31:05.680 --> 02:31:12.160]  mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[02:31:12.160 --> 02:31:19.040]  when we we just it's election month alex it's not election day and that's the problem and
[02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:26.480]  everything changed after covid-19 they illegally changed state elections mailing ballots to anyone
[02:31:26.480 --> 02:31:31.680]  and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people well this isn't any way to
[02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:36.720]  run an election we're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this
[02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:41.680]  and i believe that just like i believe the election was stolen in 2020 and i have no
[02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:46.880]  problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media and the democrats to attack us
[02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:53.760]  that question our election integrity and question the the fact that elections um shouldn't be run
[02:31:53.760 --> 02:32:00.160]  the way they are we're not election deniers we're election realists everybody that's watching this
[02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:06.160]  needs to support alex jones needs to support info wars and band dot video you know the bible says

[02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:29.760]  well they were running a replay of two years ago using mail-in mallets to steal the election
[02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:37.040]  they're doing that but they hit us with the electronic voting machines today in michigan
[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:50.160]  in pennsylvania in wisconsin in arizona in new jersey in texas in new york in california

[02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:31.120]  about to take over from democrats that's where all the malfunctions are the machines either
[02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:35.120]  won't work after people vote so they leave and all their votes don't count and they don't even
[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:39.120]  know they just leave and don't know it's all not counted oh you just voted for three hours four

[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:12.400]  pick county as a team and we're very excited about how things are going today on election day
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:19.600]  we had all 223 vote centers have opened we've already had over 45 000 people who have checked in
[02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:25.360]  and and already voted today we did want to come out and discuss one issue that's going on out there
[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:32.320]  in about 20 percent of the vote centers again we have 223 vote centers across the county in about
[02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:39.600]  20 percent of those when people will go and they try and run the ballot through this tabulator
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:46.960]  maybe one out of every five or so of those ballots they're not going through we've got about 20 percent
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:53.360]  of the locations out there where there's an issue with the tabulator where some of the ballots that
[02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:58.640]  after people have voted them they try and run them through the tabulator and they're not going through
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:04.960]  well stop right there as soon as it sees you vote republican it kicks out a certain percentage
[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:09.600]  just to make sure the democrats win because the red wave is about 25 30 points above the
[02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:14.480]  dims so they just pre-program and it's very liberal it's very loving and just like your
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:21.520]  pcr test and then bye bye republicans haha liberal go back to the club and we also have a redundancy
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:27.440]  in place if you can't put the ballot in the tabulator then you can simply place it here
[02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:34.400]  in where you see the number three and this is a secure box where those ballots will be kept
[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:41.680]  for later this evening they said it may take weeks then your ballot goes to a special area
[02:39:41.680 --> 02:39:48.320]  in maricopa county for special work to be done on it see if they didn't have enough mail-ins to
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:55.680]  steal it not this good man's involved he's a liberal loving person then they just you know
[02:39:55.680 --> 02:40:01.440]  how it works continue for later this evening where we'll bring him in here to central count
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:07.600]  to tabulate them oh function much like early voting functions in that we would get your ballot back
[02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:12.800]  once we've signature verified it we would send it to our central tabulators ballots that are in
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:17.840]  here will already be in effect signature verified so we won't need to confirm identity
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:23.040]  but we will central tabulate them this is actually what the majority of arizona counties do on
[02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:28.960]  election day all the time and pause it's supposedly the computer that tabulates it oh but not just
[02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:34.880]  pennsylvania multiple states have the computer system that validates it's a real ballot those
[02:40:34.880 --> 02:40:40.960]  were turned off yesterday by ax i mean it was a failure it was a failure let's go back to it
[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:46.400]  i want to say that everybody wants to make sure that it beats and everything is fine can you repeat
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:50.880]  that i can promise you can you start from the beginning repeat that so what happens is we have
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:58.400]  two tabulators one of the tabulators is not working okay the other tabulator is taking about 75
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:05.920]  percent successful so 25 percent of them have been misread isn't it funny that all these voting
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:12.480]  locations magically 25 percent are failing when a machine fails it does its own thing they don't
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:19.760]  all do the same thing unless they're what do machines do what happened they get programmed
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:26.480]  programmed you don't get the same error and a bunch of different machines unless they were
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:33.120]  programmed and then it's not an error continue everybody wants to make sure that it reads and
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:37.120]  everything is fine can you repeat that i can promise you can you start from the beginning
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:42.960]  repeat that so what happens is we have two tabulators one of the tabulators is not working
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:50.480]  okay the other tabulator is taking about 75 percent successful so 25 percent of them are being
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:56.640]  misread and it couldn't be a printer issue um or it could be the tabulator itself so when it's
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:02.240]  misread you have an option to put it into what's called box three and it gets read whether it goes
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:07.200]  down it kind of gets read manually or whether it gets reset it into our tabulator where did you
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:13.440]  decay to get read no so no one's trying to i want to be i want to be a trillion percent clear
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.680]  these campaign workers these poll workers are great people they're not involved in the fraud
[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:22.720]  they're just told oh all the machines in the county have 25 percent failure totally impossible
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:27.200]  what's their program and they're just told the official story so the media will be like
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:32.400]  evil right wingers claim this poor guy stole it no this guy didn't do that he sees everything
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:36.880]  breaking everybody's pissed off he's there to volunteer he's a good guy probably republican
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:45.600]  he walks out and tells everybody this it's ridiculous absolutely ridiculous you know
[02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:49.680]  they've clocked car companies a few times pre-crop ramming their computers to fail at a certain
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:59.840]  point and they got caught because it's pre-programmed it's pre-programmed until about 150 years ago
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:06.720]  cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter
[02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:14.080]  because of something called vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course
[02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:19.680]  it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a
[02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:28.640]  lack of vitamin d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're
[02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:33.840]  not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3 and then it's very easy for viruses
[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:38.320]  and other things you start replicating and taking your body over so now it's more important than ever

[02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:29.120]  you could have
[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:46.480]  in modern elections more and more ballots are being cast in early voting and also by mail
[02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:52.640]  and many states don't start counting those ballots until after the ballots uh after pardon me after
[02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:58.240]  the polls close on november 8th so you heard the president say this the other night he has been
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:04.560]  very clear on this as well we may not know all the winners of elections for a few days it takes
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:10.640]  time to count all legitimate ballots in a legal and orderly manner that's how the that's how this
[02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:16.640]  is supposed to work and it's important for us all right we're going to go to carry lake here in
[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:21.680]  just a moment she's live in a press conference talking about this but again they always do tricks
[02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:26.480]  they didn't mainly show the election machines and i told you that two years ago we were right
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:32.960]  some of that went on they did it with mass mail-in ballots of dead people and folks that moved out
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:40.480]  of state facebook and google on record spent over 700 million together to to collate those numbers
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:45.280]  and send those outs they have databases to then fill out the ballots that came out this time they're
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:50.400]  hitting you with mail in but the landslide's so big they can't beat it with that they barely beat
[02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:56.000]  trump before so now they've got to have the machines all fail all the battleground states
[02:48:56.800 --> 02:49:02.480]  all the battleground states michigan wisconsin pennsylvania uh arizona georgia it's happening
[02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:07.360]  uh in key cities they're democrat controlled uh it's happening in texas it's it's it's happening
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:14.160]  in california and in red areas the few red areas left they are stealing it and they're using the
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:19.520]  computers to do it by making them fail then it holds up the election then all those ballots
[02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:25.600]  slide in to god knows what they're about to do so never seen this many computer failures
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:29.680]  they told you it was gonna get held up and it is and then when you get angry
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:34.080]  they're gonna stage a false flag i was talking this morning while i was hiking
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:40.960]  to a fellow that used to do this in third world countries for the cia that used to manipulate
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:45.040]  elections used to manipulate enemies they were targeting and uh here let me just
[02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:50.960]  just left my phone in my office i was gonna read you the text he sent me about the article about
[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:56.800]  the cia saying they want to target american citizens uh that was in uh abc news and fox news
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:01.600]  and the new york times they said it's clear they're getting ready to steal it with the machines
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:05.600]  and the mail ins and then they're gonna stage terror attacks and blaming on us after they do it
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:10.480]  and that's we now are very clear where we're at with biden's speech that don't get violent when
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:16.240]  uh you think we stole it they steal it then they blow stuff up blaming on us we're here they're
[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:23.200]  doing it it's done so there you are and we've we've been foreshadowing this we we look at
[02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:28.160]  their propaganda told what they were doing but now it's very clear we are against violence we're
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:32.400]  not blowing anything up but they keep telling you hey the right way or is going to blow stuff up
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:37.120]  okay we're really going to win this election and when we do win it they're going to blow stuff up
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:43.520]  no we're not blowing anything up you murdering criminals but they have pre-programmed
[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:47.520]  every bit of it let's go to carry lake and when she's covering live right now
[02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:52.080]  mix arizona where gubernatorial candidate carry lake is on the ground they're talking
[02:50:52.080 --> 02:50:56.560]  and we're going to dip in and listen here to the candidate tabulate is not working they told me to
[02:50:56.560 --> 02:51:02.320]  put my my ballot into a box and they would drive it downtown to count it this is not normal stuff
[02:51:02.320 --> 02:51:07.040]  we don't have to have elections run this way we switched from a republican area to vote we
[02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:12.320]  came right down to the heart of liberal phoenix to vote because we wanted to make sure that we had
[02:51:12.320 --> 02:51:18.960]  good machines and guess what they've had zero problems with their machines today not one machine
[02:51:18.960 --> 02:51:24.960]  spit out a ballot here today not one in a very liberal area so we were right to come and vote in
[02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:32.240]  a liberal area they gotta fix this problem this is a competency i hope it's not malice but we're
[02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:37.200]  going to fix it we're going to win and when we win there's going to be come to jesus for elections
[02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:49.120]  in arizona there's going to be a come to jesus next your attorney i've mentioned maybe a possible
[02:51:49.120 --> 02:51:54.480]  silver lining with the issues that you will be able to move about town and kind of shake hands
[02:51:54.480 --> 02:51:57.920]  and talk to some of the people in mind you do elaborate on your plan for later today after
[02:51:57.920 --> 02:52:02.240]  we leave we're going to go encourage people to stay in line we are going to vote and we are going
[02:52:02.240 --> 02:52:08.320]  to stay in line and the people of arizona would walk over hot coals and they would walk over broken
[02:52:08.320 --> 02:52:13.600]  glass to vote today and i know that they can stand in line for a couple hours if they have to i know
[02:52:13.600 --> 02:52:17.920]  they'll stand in line for eight hours if they have to and they will vote and on my message to the
[02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:23.200]  people of arizona is do not get out of line until you have cast your vote do not get out of line
[02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:27.440]  until you've cast your vote things are looking very good for us they may be trying to slow
[02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:32.480]  a red tsunami but it's coming and we are going to take back arizona and i know that people are
[02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:39.200]  out voting take a little bit of food wear comfortable shoes take some water and just stay in line arizona
[02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:44.720]  and vote vote vote we got a vote today first question names and who are you with
[02:52:44.720 --> 02:52:59.920]  i don't know what the problems are going to be i don't know what the problems are going to be
[02:52:59.920 --> 02:53:05.680]  but i know that people are feeling disenfranchised today i saw a woman walk away from line a line
[02:53:05.680 --> 02:53:10.880]  today i'll stop right there we're going to come back to her in the next segment then mike adams
[02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:14.960]  takes over he's covering all the election is straight ahead and then i'll ensure you're three to six
[02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:22.560]  p.m. then i'm back right through midnight folks it's the same problem all over the key battleground
[02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:33.440]  states they've done it again and you'll see the headlines jones preposterously claims there's fraud
[02:53:33.440 --> 02:53:41.600]  when they're doing it again that leads me to this point i didn't plug once when david ike was on last
[02:53:41.600 --> 02:53:51.440]  hour we're not going to be on air unless we've got your support other people aren't going to take on

[03:00:12.400 --> 03:00:19.280]  failing and shutting off they're only doing it in republican precincts to make the voters go away
[03:00:19.280 --> 03:00:25.120]  and to capture the ballots so they can do whatever they want with them this is historic let's go back
[03:00:25.120 --> 03:00:29.760]  to carry lake uh she's still live on there but we backed up to where she was when we went to break
[03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:35.520]  here it is cast your ballot they counted it right there in the small precinct and you knew the
[03:00:35.520 --> 03:00:41.120]  results the night of the election we can't keep having elections run this way we're gonna have
[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:45.760]  hillary clinton losing her mind with him and she's another election denier she's already predicting

[03:01:01.920 --> 03:01:08.400]  a question kelly o grady with fox news thanks for taking the question um you've said before that
[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:13.120]  you've wanted secretary hobbs your opponent to recuse yourself does this intensify that feeling
[03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:18.480]  and will you accept it if she doesn't i think she should have recused herself she's unethical
[03:01:18.480 --> 03:01:23.040]  she's incompetent um but you know we've been asking her to do that since july of last year
[03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:28.960]  apparently she hasn't done so uh we're just gonna see where things go carry the question here yesterday
[03:01:28.960 --> 03:01:35.280]  you said stay in line we're gonna do it pause i've forgotten that the woman she's running against
[03:01:35.280 --> 03:01:42.160]  just runs the elections uh katie hobbs i mean you can't make i forgot about that go back to it
[03:01:43.760 --> 03:01:47.120]  anything could happen and here we are what is your advice to voters out there who are watching this
[03:01:47.120 --> 03:01:52.480]  press conference live saying where do i go how do i make sure my vote counts my advice is stay in

[03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:18.480]  mike adams for the rest of the hour is about to take over natural news dot com we got three
[03:02:18.480 --> 03:02:24.480]  minutes to break mike this is insane all over the country key battlegrounds the machines go down
[03:02:24.480 --> 03:02:30.000]  and republican districts wow they are no wonder biden said they're gonna get mad and blow stuff up
[03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:35.840]  they're gonna steal it in front of us or try and then false flag and claim we did it well this is
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:40.480]  one of the scenarios we've been very concerned about where they they go overboard in rigging
[03:02:40.480 --> 03:02:47.680]  the election in a new way that's not anticipated by the gop and then of course they have uh operators
[03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:53.280]  ready to try to start violence i'm talking about you know deep state operators people dressed up
[03:02:53.280 --> 03:02:58.240]  as maga to try to you know simulate violence or even cause violence and then the media will be there
[03:02:58.240 --> 03:03:04.240]  to blame it on maga candidates while people like you and i are calling for peace we call for peace
[03:03:04.240 --> 03:03:09.120]  we just want our democracy we want the people's voice to be heard and we are the american people
[03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:15.760]  are being terrorized by a corrupt cabal of criminals who just will not let go of power no
[03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:21.840]  matter what and by the way alex even if republicans win big and sweep the senate and the house
[03:03:21.840 --> 03:03:27.520]  i'm warning that we should be ready for america to be terrorized by the biden regime for the next
[03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:33.280]  two years as punishment for disobedience that's my take on it i agree but i look they've already
[03:03:33.280 --> 03:03:36.240]  gone for broke they're not going to give up they're you're trying to steal the whole thing
[03:03:36.240 --> 03:03:39.760]  and then they're going to stage stuff we've got to have camera people in every major city
[03:03:39.760 --> 03:03:44.320]  and a key battleground areas to show who these people really are this is do or die time right now
[03:03:44.320 --> 03:03:49.280]  mike we've got to document everything if you are voting and there's some shenanigans going on
[03:03:49.840 --> 03:03:54.960]  you need to start documenting what's happening you can declare this is a crime scene i'm documenting
[03:03:54.960 --> 03:03:59.840]  a crime scene you can call for law enforcement officer to come to the scene and document what

[03:04:09.920 --> 03:04:15.040]  are in fact a prosecutable crimes and we need to hold them accountable this time uh you know
[03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:21.920]  look the american people want hope not fear and i realized that was obama's campaign slogan you know
[03:04:21.920 --> 03:04:28.560]  so long ago in 2008 but now real hope is voting against the democrats voting for g.o.p control

[03:06:23.200 --> 03:06:28.720]  dot video and also info wars dot com i'm going to be joined at the bottom of this hour by special
[03:06:28.720 --> 03:06:34.560]  guest james white from northwest liberty news with political analysis and what we know so far
[03:06:34.560 --> 03:06:39.200]  about what's happening across the country but just to bring you up to speed here there are voting
[03:06:39.200 --> 03:06:44.560]  machine failures being reported across many states many precincts but they appear to be
[03:06:45.120 --> 03:06:50.640]  experiencing failures in republican dominated regions especially in arizona we just saw a
[03:06:50.640 --> 03:06:56.640]  clip from carrie lake there who looks like she's going to win if the election is allowed to take
[03:06:56.640 --> 03:07:02.320]  place so what it looks like right now even though this is preliminary information a lot more data
[03:07:02.320 --> 03:07:09.440]  will be coming in is that voting machine failures are taking place in strong republican districts
[03:07:09.440 --> 03:07:16.640]  in order to halt republican votes so that's the current scenario and we urge all observers we urge
[03:07:16.640 --> 03:07:23.040]  all attorneys lawyers with the gop to start digging into this immediately because it looks
[03:07:23.040 --> 03:07:29.200]  like the steel is on a lot of these races are extremely tight just a couple of points for
[03:07:29.200 --> 03:07:36.400]  example black masters versus mark kelly in arizona or even look at the os featherman race in pennsylvania
[03:07:36.400 --> 03:07:42.720]  they are pretty tight and if they steal or i should say if the democrats manage to suppress
[03:07:42.720 --> 03:07:48.640]  just even five percent of the republican votes then they will be able to steal those elections
[03:07:48.640 --> 03:07:53.840]  and steal those positions in the united states senate so we will keep you posted here on info
[03:07:53.840 --> 03:08:01.040]  wars dot com and remember there's election night coverage this evening it's live and info wars is
[03:08:01.040 --> 03:08:06.800]  covering it i know war room i know brandon howes is doing coverage a bunch of people i know we're
[03:08:06.800 --> 03:08:12.400]  doing coverage as well so the independent media is doing massive coverage of this i may even be
[03:08:12.400 --> 03:08:17.600]  popping in later here on info wars dot com this evening schedule permitting i'm going to be manning
[03:08:17.600 --> 03:08:23.360]  the studio all night long and providing commentary let me bring in something different that you
[03:08:23.360 --> 03:08:28.720]  haven't heard about these elections probably and there's a new factor in this that has never
[03:08:28.720 --> 03:08:35.680]  been present before in previous elections it is the fact that the democrat party committed to some
[03:08:35.680 --> 03:08:43.040]  degree vaccine suicide this is the first election in america that has been held following a vaccine
[03:08:43.040 --> 03:08:49.440]  genocide event where hundreds of millions of people were injected with a biological weapon
[03:08:49.440 --> 03:08:55.440]  system that was designed to cause infertility stillbirths spontaneous abortions and in some
[03:08:55.440 --> 03:09:03.200]  cases fatalities and democrats took this vaccine compared to conservatives at about a two to one
[03:09:03.200 --> 03:09:08.560]  ratio that's a rough ratio not exact but it's pretty close and what that means is that the
[03:09:08.560 --> 03:09:14.400]  democrats have to work overtime to try to steal this election for the simple reason that many of
[03:09:14.400 --> 03:09:20.160]  their own people are dead because they took these injections that killed them they died from the
[03:09:20.160 --> 03:09:25.360]  clots they died from the neurological problems they died from heart attacks and myocarditis
[03:09:25.920 --> 03:09:31.920]  and so the democrats have killed off many of their own people and the actual number is difficult to
[03:09:31.920 --> 03:09:38.960]  ascertain but there are rigorous estimates that say that right now in america well over one million
[03:09:38.960 --> 03:09:45.040]  people have been killed by these so-called vaccine injections since they began now i know the mainstream
[03:09:45.040 --> 03:09:50.880]  media is going to argue with that number but we'll say it's 1.5 million just as a round number here
[03:09:51.520 --> 03:09:56.800]  to demonstrate something really important now the actual number might be 800 000 might be 1.2
[03:09:56.800 --> 03:10:02.880]  million might be more than 1.5 but if it's roughly two to one democrats versus republicans who took
[03:10:02.880 --> 03:10:09.120]  the vaccine then if there are a total of about 1.5 million people who died from this and not
[03:10:09.120 --> 03:10:14.160]  considering independence just for this simple thought experiment you could say that potentially
[03:10:14.160 --> 03:10:19.920]  as many as one million democrats were killed by this vaccine and about a half a million republicans
[03:10:19.920 --> 03:10:25.520]  were killed by this vaccine again these are just rough numbers this is a a thought experiment but
[03:10:25.520 --> 03:10:32.480]  it it reaches a very important point the democrats have to then rig elections to overcome the missing
[03:10:32.480 --> 03:10:39.440]  people that are literally dead and why because the democrats censored those of us who were trying to
[03:10:39.440 --> 03:10:45.680]  save everybody's lives from these injections including the lives of democrats so understand
[03:10:45.680 --> 03:10:52.720]  folks that alex jones tried to save the lives of democrats and so did i and not just democrats but
[03:10:52.720 --> 03:10:58.000]  we try to save the lives of everyone independence and libertarians and conservatives republicans
[03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:04.160]  democrats everybody even uh you know political agnostic people who don't vote we want you to live
[03:11:04.880 --> 03:11:09.520]  and so we were censored and we found out that that censorship was carried out
[03:11:09.520 --> 03:11:16.720]  via collusion between the white house and big tech in a rampant and illegal slash unconstitutional
[03:11:16.720 --> 03:11:25.200]  manner so it was in fact the censorship by big tech run by leftists that caused voices that would
[03:11:25.200 --> 03:11:31.600]  save democrats lives to be suppressed which is why more democrats are dead today and not voting
[03:11:31.600 --> 03:11:36.640]  although you might argue that that never stopped democrats from voting before just being dead
[03:11:36.640 --> 03:11:42.080]  but it's harder when there are more of them dead but we try to save their lives again alex jones
[03:11:42.080 --> 03:11:46.160]  tried to save their lives i try to save their lives dr peter mccullough tried to save their
[03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:52.560]  lives there's so many other people who have appeared on this program such as uh p chambers and and
[03:11:52.560 --> 03:11:58.880]  just many other amazing people dr joseph mccullough and many others so if the democrats lose this
[03:11:58.880 --> 03:12:04.560]  election for that reason and many more they only have themselves to blame if they find themselves
[03:12:04.560 --> 03:12:10.320]  in a position where they can't out cheat the number that they're missing and also the growing
[03:12:10.320 --> 03:12:15.520]  backlash against the democrat agenda that is punishing america through what we can only call
[03:12:15.520 --> 03:12:20.800]  acts of terrorism against the infrastructure shutting down oil and coal shutting down
[03:12:20.800 --> 03:12:26.080]  effectively transportation because of fuel scarcity shutting down the food system and
[03:12:26.080 --> 03:12:30.960]  causing the dollar to lose value because of endless money printing causing food inflation
[03:12:30.960 --> 03:12:38.560]  fuel and for inflation and then also now housing price collapse and also land prices are collapsing
[03:12:38.560 --> 03:12:43.760]  in some areas and the stock market is down substantially from the beginning of the year
[03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:49.120]  so while costs are going up prices are going up people's assets are falling and this is due
[03:12:49.120 --> 03:12:54.560]  to democrat policies so the backlash against the democrats is going to be absolutely enormous
[03:12:54.560 --> 03:13:00.560]  it may be beyond the threshold of democrat cheating that's yet to be seen but it shows
[03:13:00.560 --> 03:13:05.760]  why the cheating is so desperate now there's a possible silver lining in all of this that i
[03:13:05.760 --> 03:13:12.400]  want to mention because the cheating has to be so blatant and just so desperate it's far more
[03:13:12.400 --> 03:13:18.880]  likely today in 2022 the democrats are going to get caught cheating compared to the way they pulled
[03:13:18.880 --> 03:13:24.560]  it off in 2020 which was basically a surprise attack through a rapid expansion of a cheating
[03:13:24.560 --> 03:13:29.520]  mechanism that was not widely anticipated by conservatives but since that time if you think
[03:13:29.520 --> 03:13:34.880]  about it people like steve bannon at the war room and here infowars.com all the amazing
[03:13:34.880 --> 03:13:40.640]  hosts over shroyer and harrison and alexon and so many others have been able to sound the alarm
[03:13:40.640 --> 03:13:46.960]  so the gop is awake and aware of what might be attempted here so the fact i should say the the
[03:13:46.960 --> 03:13:53.360]  likelihood that democrats are going to get caught this time is extremely high in fact if you go on
[03:13:53.360 --> 03:13:58.400]  to the gateway pundit right now look at jim hoft and his coverage in real time looking at what's
[03:13:58.400 --> 03:14:03.520]  happening across the country he's got a tips email that's going there people are reporting tips from
[03:14:03.520 --> 03:14:08.960]  all over america of some of the machine failures and some of what they what appears to be cheating
[03:14:08.960 --> 03:14:14.080]  taking place all across this country in other words conservatives now have an infrastructure
[03:14:14.080 --> 03:14:20.640]  to spot the cheating to publicize it to cover it and to fight back against it now in 22 more than
[03:14:20.640 --> 03:14:26.640]  in any election previous to this in addition something like 24 states have passed additional
[03:14:26.640 --> 03:14:31.920]  election integrity laws that have been put in place making it more difficult for democrats to
[03:14:31.920 --> 03:14:36.640]  cheat of course they can still cheat in their dem controlled areas but even then there's going to
[03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:43.360]  be a lot more scrutiny so i would say that right now where we stand even with the cheating the
[03:14:43.360 --> 03:14:49.760]  massive outpouring backlash against the democrats agenda which includes child grooming and pedophilia
[03:14:49.760 --> 03:14:56.320]  and genital mutilations and food inflation fuel inflation scarcity of falling asset values and
[03:14:56.320 --> 03:15:02.640]  all of this the backlash is so massive that we may yet pull this thing off despite the cheating
[03:15:03.200 --> 03:15:08.720]  and that's what we are praying for and by the way we should also thank god and thank you for all
[03:15:08.720 --> 03:15:14.320]  your prayers out there that we made it to this day without a massive false flag event canceling
[03:15:14.320 --> 03:15:20.160]  the election because that was always a possibility and i've been told from sources that those efforts
[03:15:20.160 --> 03:15:26.000]  were underway and they were shut down internally because there is a kind of civil war behind the
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:30.400]  scenes and there are a lot of people in the system that are fed up with the corruption
[03:15:30.400 --> 03:15:36.880]  and they too want to take america back just like you and i do so this could be an amazing historic
[03:15:36.880 --> 03:15:42.400]  day for america and we're going to cover it all right here live on info wars dot com i'll be back
[03:15:42.400 --> 03:15:46.960]  with more commentary and remember this evening coverage all this evening right here on band

[03:15:56.560 --> 03:16:01.280]  look at that everybody else is just like yellow or clear and that's because it's been denatured
[03:16:01.280 --> 03:16:08.080]  it's been worked out we didn't do that you think i would metaphysically tell you something this is
[03:16:08.080 --> 03:16:14.560]  the very best i can get i'd rather go to hell and do that i will only give you the maximum best info
[03:16:14.560 --> 03:16:22.000]  the maximum truth the maximum product because i want that good will what i do to you i do to
[03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:27.760]  myself don't you get the big secret you ever seen fish oil look like that no you never seen that have
[03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:35.760]  you and this little jewel right here is solid liquid consciousness
[03:16:39.120 --> 03:16:46.720]  look it up find out how even the fda and the government admits fish oil is incredible the
[03:16:46.720 --> 03:16:52.400]  number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil just like our
[03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:58.000]  informations dynamites or our products in four store dot com in arizona i think we watched the
[03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:06.000]  election be uh stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely
[03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:13.040]  absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we we just it's election month alex it's
[03:17:13.040 --> 03:17:20.000]  not election day and that's the problem and everything changed after covet 19 they illegally
[03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:27.280]  changed state elections mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots
[03:17:27.280 --> 03:17:32.000]  to people well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious country when we have
[03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:36.960]  elections that can be stolen like this and i believe that just like i believe the election
[03:17:36.960 --> 03:17:42.800]  was stolen in 2020 and i have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media and
[03:17:42.800 --> 03:17:48.960]  the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity and question the the fact that
[03:17:48.960 --> 03:17:55.120]  elections shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election realists
[03:17:56.320 --> 03:18:02.480]  i'm dr peter mccullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the wellness company

[03:19:54.320 --> 03:20:04.160]  for your support leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:20:10.640 --> 03:20:17.840]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[03:20:17.840 --> 03:20:29.280]  it's mike adams so one of the strategies to out game the cheating mechanism by the democrats
[03:20:29.280 --> 03:20:36.720]  is to vote on election day and because of a great many people who were sharing that strategy
[03:20:37.280 --> 03:20:42.560]  on the war room and even on info wars and other broadcasts it turns out that a lot of
[03:20:42.560 --> 03:20:48.000]  conservatives waited they did not participate in early voting or mail in voting because they knew
[03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:54.240]  that that actually provides the democrat algorithms with the data points that they need to rig the
[03:20:54.240 --> 03:21:00.800]  cheat in advance so instead they're voting today on election day and i have yet to vote today i'm
[03:21:00.800 --> 03:21:06.880]  going to do that nothing's going to stop me from voting that's for sure but millions of people all
[03:21:06.880 --> 03:21:12.800]  across the country doing the same thing as a result the turnout that's happening today and
[03:21:12.800 --> 03:21:17.360]  we're getting early numbers out of florida and other areas show that the democrat i'm sorry the
[03:21:17.360 --> 03:21:22.800]  republican turnout is off the charts and as an example of that even in miami dade county which
[03:21:22.800 --> 03:21:30.320]  of course is a you know traditionally blue democrat leaning county in florida the republican turnout
[03:21:30.320 --> 03:21:37.440]  is more than 10 000 ahead in terms of total votes cast compared to democrats and that's in a blue
[03:21:37.440 --> 03:21:44.880]  county now on top of that i can assure you that there are hardly any republicans that are not
[03:21:44.880 --> 03:21:50.160]  voting republican i mean almost every republican is is going to vote against the democrats and yet
[03:21:50.160 --> 03:21:55.680]  at the same time there's no question that there are many registered democrats who will vote republican
[03:21:55.680 --> 03:22:01.200]  why because well there's a kind of civil war in the democrat party and a lot of what you might
[03:22:01.200 --> 03:22:07.760]  call mainstream democrats or classical liberals are fed up with how radical the democrat party
[03:22:07.760 --> 03:22:15.120]  has become especially with kind of the aoc camp and a push for transgenderism on children chemical
[03:22:15.120 --> 03:22:21.360]  castrations and genitalia mutilations and drag queen story time in schools and things like that
[03:22:21.360 --> 03:22:27.280]  it is really offensive to common sense people whether they are democrats or republicans
[03:22:27.280 --> 03:22:33.040]  to exploit and abuse children in that manner and to end up having children having their
[03:22:33.040 --> 03:22:39.360]  uh reproductive organs surgically cut off effectively maiming children for life in order
[03:22:39.360 --> 03:22:45.760]  to achieve some kind of you know progressive uh inclusive agenda that's nothing it's not inclusive
[03:22:45.760 --> 03:22:52.400]  it's abusive so the point is oh and by the way i should mention there are a lot of gays who are
[03:22:52.400 --> 03:22:58.480]  walking away from the democrat party as well for a lot of the same reasons there's a group called
[03:22:58.480 --> 03:23:05.200]  the gays against groomers for example and i think their slogan is lgb without the t and you know
[03:23:05.200 --> 03:23:10.960]  they're they used to be embraced and accepted of just being gay as part of the democrat party
[03:23:10.960 --> 03:23:16.240]  but now if they're gay and white then they can even be ostracized by the democrats and they're
[03:23:16.240 --> 03:23:21.440]  not on board with all the transgenderism and grooming and so on and uh they they are walking
[03:23:21.440 --> 03:23:27.520]  away from the democrat party uh so we're also seeing hispanics moving strongly against the
[03:23:27.520 --> 03:23:34.720]  democrats because hispanics by the way have very strong family values and most of them are catholic
[03:23:34.720 --> 03:23:39.760]  in terms of their religious affiliation and they want strong families and they want to protect
[03:23:39.760 --> 03:23:45.040]  their children from predators because they you know many of them are very much aware of how the
[03:23:45.040 --> 03:23:49.440]  southern border is used to traffic children they don't want their children to be subjected
[03:23:49.440 --> 03:23:53.840]  to those kinds of risks and they don't want their children to be turned into transgenders and have
[03:23:53.840 --> 03:23:59.600]  their their genitalia mutilated so hispanics are rejecting the democrat party as well and then there
[03:23:59.600 --> 03:24:06.160]  are black americans and black americans my sense is that many of them feel abandoned by the democrats
[03:24:06.160 --> 03:24:10.480]  they were promised many things that the the democrats always make promises during election
[03:24:10.480 --> 03:24:14.880]  season oh well you know we'll take care of you we'll remember you we'll we'll clean up your
[03:24:14.880 --> 03:24:22.400]  neighborhoods and then the democrats betray black americans by being soft on crime defunding police
[03:24:22.400 --> 03:24:28.400]  and by the way most black americans want a reasonable police presence in their communities
[03:24:28.400 --> 03:24:33.280]  to push back against the violent crime that is rising like never before and then you've got the
[03:24:33.280 --> 03:24:40.000]  crazies like kathy hokel current governor of new york she may very well lose to lee zelden she just
[03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:46.000]  the other day called any talk of violent crime rising in new york she said it was a conspiracy
[03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:51.920]  theory so yeah if you get stabbed in new york that's a conspiracy theory now according to hokel
[03:24:51.920 --> 03:24:56.400]  or if you get shot or mugged or raped on the streets of new york city oh you're a conspiracy
[03:24:56.400 --> 03:25:01.680]  theorist even though you were the victim of the crime that's how insane it is so that's why so many
[03:25:01.680 --> 03:25:07.440]  people are walking away moving away rejecting the democrat party and this explains why there will be
[03:25:07.440 --> 03:25:13.760]  so many democrats voting republican so in other words what i'm saying is that even if you look at
[03:25:13.760 --> 03:25:19.600]  the aggregate number of votes cast by the two political parties in all the elections across
[03:25:19.600 --> 03:25:25.360]  the country that alone even though it's already strongly favoring republicans compared to the
[03:25:25.360 --> 03:25:31.840]  turnout you know two years ago that doesn't even capture the level of frustration with the biden
[03:25:31.840 --> 03:25:38.160]  regime and the level of rejection of the democrats including by democrats themselves and when this
[03:25:38.160 --> 03:25:45.120]  is all said and done you're going to see a kind of civil war in america but a civil war inside the
[03:25:45.120 --> 03:25:51.760]  democrat party as the blame game begins and you have the nancy polosi camp kind of the old school
[03:25:51.760 --> 03:25:58.080]  democrats at a kind of war you know behind the scenes political war with the aoc camp
[03:25:58.080 --> 03:26:04.560]  which is uh we might call them the green taliban you know the the greeny climate cultists the
[03:26:04.560 --> 03:26:12.320]  radicals in the democrat party that war is going to be a site to behold of course that's assumed
[03:26:12.320 --> 03:26:17.520]  that assumes that republicans actually sweep victories today and take both the house and the
[03:26:17.520 --> 03:26:23.680]  senate which i still think is likely despite the cheating but this civil war inside the democrat party
[03:26:24.640 --> 03:26:31.120]  is going to be fireworks because you're going to see whether the democrats will choose a future
[03:26:31.120 --> 03:26:37.120]  that is in line with the american people and reasonable common-sense values such as you're
[03:26:37.120 --> 03:26:42.400]  protecting families and children or whether they go all full-blown marxists and communists and just
[03:26:42.400 --> 03:26:46.960]  say they want to power their way through this and demand obedience and punish anybody who
[03:26:46.960 --> 03:26:52.960]  disagrees that has been the path of the democrats for the last you know two years or so not longer
[03:26:53.520 --> 03:26:58.960]  but they're about to get slapped hard by the american voter with a message that says we reject
[03:26:58.960 --> 03:27:05.680]  this we reject you the biden regime the democrats and your insanity your insane policies against
[03:27:05.680 --> 03:27:11.280]  children and your controlled demolition of the economy and where democrats really went wrong
[03:27:11.280 --> 03:27:16.400]  in this although you might say it's too early you know for a post election analysis but let me tell
[03:27:16.400 --> 03:27:22.640]  you where i think they went way wrong in all of this they tried to take down the food system
[03:27:22.640 --> 03:27:29.440]  and the energy system and they didn't realize the repercussions that it would have they had no idea
[03:27:29.440 --> 03:27:33.920]  that the barges would get stuck in the mississippi river because of geoengineering and weather control
[03:27:33.920 --> 03:27:39.120]  systems they didn't think through the fact that if there's not enough diesel then people don't get
[03:27:39.120 --> 03:27:44.960]  food on a timely basis and then food prices go sky high because diesel is used in farming and agriculture
[03:27:44.960 --> 03:27:50.400]  and it's typical of democrats to not think about the repercussions of their actions after all
[03:27:50.960 --> 03:27:56.240]  they lash out emotionally and irrationally and they lack any real understanding of economics
[03:27:56.240 --> 03:28:02.400]  politics history or humanity as a whole so this is the way they behave like petulant children
[03:28:02.960 --> 03:28:07.920]  and those children are about to get slapped hard today by the american voter so the number one
[03:28:07.920 --> 03:28:12.640]  thing that you can do today is make sure you go out and vote and encourage everyone around you to

[03:33:30.640 --> 03:33:34.080]  real quick here and then we're going to jump in with james white from northwest liberty news with
[03:33:34.080 --> 03:33:39.440]  additional election analysis based on what's happening right now in real time two things
[03:33:39.440 --> 03:33:47.760]  worth mentioning number one there is a kind of a crypto bitcoin meltdown of sorts or mini meltdown
[03:33:47.760 --> 03:33:52.160]  taking place right now that is completely unrelated to the election so there's nothing
[03:33:52.160 --> 03:33:56.960]  election related there's something happening between i think finance and and another coin i don't
[03:33:56.960 --> 03:34:01.760]  know if it's ft t or who it is there was a liquidity question there's been a little bit of concern
[03:34:01.760 --> 03:34:08.560]  there but bitcoin is down to a very close to 18 000 right now and there's a lot of you know
[03:34:08.560 --> 03:34:14.240]  a lot of people watching a lot of people concerned about that situation i just encourage you you know
[03:34:14.240 --> 03:34:20.000]  so look at it closely you know before you make any decisions obviously i'm not advising you to do
[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:27.600]  anything one way or another and i do think that everybody needs a a safe place to get out of
[03:34:27.600 --> 03:34:33.600]  the fiat currency dollars dollars in my opinion because of what's happening with south arabia
[03:34:33.600 --> 03:34:38.720]  now choosing china as its priority trading partner you have the bricks nations you have the belt and
[03:34:38.720 --> 03:34:45.200]  road initiative that we've covered on other episodes but the dollar ultimately not today but but the
[03:34:45.200 --> 03:34:50.720]  dollar is doomed the dollar is going to vanish it could be you know months away it could be a couple
[03:34:50.720 --> 03:34:57.120]  of years away could be real soon we don't know for sure but you got to have a safe place for your
[03:34:57.120 --> 03:35:01.440]  assets outside the dollar but do your own research do your own homework talk to your own financial
[03:35:01.440 --> 03:35:05.920]  advisors get informed because the reason i even mentioned this today is because depending on how
[03:35:05.920 --> 03:35:11.280]  this election goes and whether the radical leftists and the biden regime are going to try to carry out
[03:35:11.280 --> 03:35:16.320]  some kind of false flag operation after this there could be violence that they set into motion
[03:35:16.880 --> 03:35:20.720]  there could be a lot of instability following this and i've even predicted there could be
[03:35:21.440 --> 03:35:26.800]  attacks against america's infrastructure such as false flag cyber attacks on the banking and
[03:35:26.800 --> 03:35:34.800]  financial system following this election remember as i said when americans reject the regime the
[03:35:34.800 --> 03:35:40.640]  regime will punish americans in the same way that america punished germany by destroying the Nord
[03:35:40.640 --> 03:35:46.720]  Stream pipelines which provide energy to germany and western europe the same regime is willing to
[03:35:46.720 --> 03:35:52.320]  carry out acts of terrorism against the domestic infrastructure in america that keeps this country
[03:35:52.320 --> 03:35:58.080]  running so keep those things in mind all right now we're going to bring in uh james white from
[03:35:58.080 --> 03:36:04.000]  northwest liberty news and he is um he's a host on on my platform as well and i just i just know
[03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:09.840]  that he's a really well-informed guy welcome james it's great to have you on mic thanks for having
[03:36:09.840 --> 03:36:13.920]  me on the broadcast i appreciate you and i appreciate the uh the folks over at info wars thanks so
[03:36:13.920 --> 03:36:20.560]  much yeah absolutely uh you're you're online here with the best of the best i mean info wars has
[03:36:20.560 --> 03:36:26.320]  been leading this charge uh for two years to take america back but give us your estimate right now
[03:36:26.320 --> 03:36:30.880]  james of where you think we stand based on the news that you've heard this morning i think you
[03:36:30.880 --> 03:36:36.720]  already broadcast your own show just about an hour ago so what can you tell us so here's what
[03:36:36.720 --> 03:36:41.760]  i think is going on mic i think that uh the 2020 election i think the steel was they tried to do the
[03:36:41.760 --> 03:36:47.280]  steel sort of uh in secret if you will without people finding out i think now they're making it
[03:36:47.280 --> 03:36:51.680]  they're doing it just the opposite my thought is you know what's the only one of the only
[03:36:51.680 --> 03:36:56.560]  institutions that they have left that they can go to and that's the court systems i think what they're
[03:36:56.560 --> 03:37:01.920]  going to do is they're going to try to make it so haywire and so people are going to be so um
[03:37:01.920 --> 03:37:05.920]  they're not going to have any confidence at all in in the vote that they're going to try to get
[03:37:05.920 --> 03:37:09.600]  into the courts i think that's really one of the only things they have left is to try to get to the
[03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:15.280]  courts and you saw this featherman guy that's going against os he said that before he even the
[03:37:15.280 --> 03:37:21.280]  before the the box the ballot box is even open he's already talking about he bringing up lawsuits
[03:37:21.280 --> 03:37:24.080]  i think that's what they're going to do i think they're going to use law fair which is what they
[03:37:24.080 --> 03:37:30.240]  do a lot yeah featherman said that he thought he was going to have some miraculous comeback today
[03:37:30.240 --> 03:37:36.640]  which is i think just code words for uh incredible cheating you know i mean after that debate between
[03:37:36.640 --> 03:37:42.400]  featherman and os how could any rational person vote for featherman at all i mean he he's i feel
[03:37:42.400 --> 03:37:47.440]  sorry for the guy he needs medical assistance he needs time to recover and heal from his stroke
[03:37:47.440 --> 03:37:52.320]  but he is not of the state of mind with proper cognition to be able to represent the american
[03:37:52.320 --> 03:37:59.600]  people in the united states senate uh clearly dr os is the uh straightforward choice in in that role
[03:37:59.600 --> 03:38:04.560]  now os is leading in the polls though do you think james that they can cheat enough to overcome that
[03:38:04.560 --> 03:38:13.040]  lead but yeah i think they can i mean i think they're gonna try um that that is uh again like i
[03:38:13.040 --> 03:38:17.440]  i don't believe that for years and years i don't believe that some of these people that are in power
[03:38:17.440 --> 03:38:21.440]  now would have got that got in power unless they cheated i think they've been doing it for a long
[03:38:21.440 --> 03:38:26.320]  time maybe 20 years i think you become very good at it i think uh now i think people are becoming
[03:38:26.320 --> 03:38:31.760]  wise and i think the whole con is about the crumble uh because the people being conned realize now
[03:38:31.760 --> 03:38:36.720]  that they're being conned and the con can't continue when the people wake up so uh yeah i think
[03:38:36.720 --> 03:38:41.680]  they're gonna try to steal it in several places and we're getting reports and i think in uh texas
[03:38:41.680 --> 03:38:47.520]  in arizona i heard new jersey and maybe even pennsylvania that they're having trouble with the
[03:38:47.520 --> 03:38:53.360]  machines i think um you know we have yeah it's huge trouble as many as 20 of the machines in
[03:38:53.360 --> 03:38:57.840]  some districts are are being reported as not scanning some ballots and you know guess whose
[03:38:57.840 --> 03:39:04.080]  ballots they won't scan properly right it's not hard to figure that out but well we've got other
[03:39:04.080 --> 03:39:10.080]  news here that actually go ahead mike i was this no no you got it i didn't realize i had a roger roots
[03:39:10.080 --> 03:39:14.880]  on earlier on my on my second hour and he has ran under the libertarian party here in montana
[03:39:14.880 --> 03:39:20.480]  several times he usually gets about three or four percent of the vote when he runs we have a candidate
[03:39:20.480 --> 03:39:28.240]  here in uh john lamb here in montana running for the us congress in polling he is getting 21 percent
[03:39:28.240 --> 03:39:34.160]  of the vote with the youth they did a youth poll for that in the in the schools 21 percent i talked
[03:39:34.160 --> 03:39:39.680]  to roger who's again a constitutional lawyer he said that no no libertarian candidate's ever got
[03:39:39.680 --> 03:39:46.080]  over 12 percent ever in any election any state this could be a literally nationwide uh nation
[03:39:46.080 --> 03:39:51.120]  national news here in montana if this uh this libertarian candidate gets more than 12 percent
[03:39:51.120 --> 03:39:56.800]  it looks like he's going to going to so is it understood that most of those youth votes would
[03:39:56.800 --> 03:40:01.840]  otherwise be democrat votes if not for this libertarian candidate no there were there were
[03:40:01.840 --> 03:40:06.080]  democrats state there was a ryan zinke is one of the other guys running he's running and there's
[03:40:06.080 --> 03:40:11.280]  also a democrat running they had all three of those uh folks on the list and the democrat did get
[03:40:11.280 --> 03:40:16.400]  quite a few votes among the younger children but uh it's really notable that the libertarian got
[03:40:17.280 --> 03:40:22.320]  12 21.8 percent amongst the high schoolers that's just unheard of i don't think anybody's
[03:40:22.320 --> 03:40:28.800]  ever heard of libertarians getting that kind of uh that kind of coverage well and now that that
[03:40:28.800 --> 03:40:34.080]  can work for or against the gop by the way libertarians can often take votes away from the gop
[03:40:34.080 --> 03:40:41.680]  in other races and you know we just have to watch this very carefully for the rigging now i i
[03:40:41.680 --> 03:40:45.920]  believe your theory is that then the democrats are going to be able to rig this at such a large
[03:40:45.920 --> 03:40:52.480]  level that they force uh court cases over this which will drag out the certification of the
[03:40:52.480 --> 03:40:58.880]  results potentially from you know days or weeks but then the courts themselves are often rigged
[03:40:58.880 --> 03:41:04.240]  by you know partisan left-wing democrats who will not follow the law is is that is that your
[03:41:04.240 --> 03:41:09.280]  contention and and by the way i mean that didn't the pennsylvania supreme court recently rule that
[03:41:09.280 --> 03:41:13.920]  certain ballots cannot be counted but seems like in the in the county districts they're gonna ignore
[03:41:13.920 --> 03:41:19.920]  the supreme court of the state what's your take whether it's lawlessness i mean here in montana
[03:41:19.920 --> 03:41:25.520]  for example we had election uh we had election bills that were that were passed by the legislature
[03:41:25.520 --> 03:41:31.440]  signed by the governor right and he sent to the supreme court and they overturned the election
[03:41:31.440 --> 03:41:35.760]  that would have strengthened the election integrity here in montana was overturned by the by the
[03:41:35.760 --> 03:41:39.520]  supreme court and what frustrates me and a lot of other people here mike is we're supposed to have
[03:41:39.520 --> 03:41:44.400]  three co-equal branches of government so we had two of the three branches here in montana the
[03:41:44.400 --> 03:41:49.600]  legislative branch and the executive branch both were on board with these with these uh these bills
[03:41:49.600 --> 03:41:53.840]  that would have protected voting in montana it gets kicked over to the supreme court the other
[03:41:53.840 --> 03:41:59.200]  apparent co-equal branch and they squashed the whole thing so something has to be done here not
[03:41:59.200 --> 03:42:04.000]  only here in montana but across the country with the the court system it's it's absolutely it's
[03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:09.120]  absolutely corrupt and and not all judges want to paint a wide brush but a lot of them sadly
[03:42:09.120 --> 03:42:14.720]  and keeps in key positions too that's the bad part but is this perhaps a strategy by democrats to
[03:42:14.720 --> 03:42:22.560]  try to provoke anger by conservatives online and then the deep state can piggyback on that anger
[03:42:22.560 --> 03:42:28.000]  with uh you know dressed up operatives who are pretending to be maga terrorists and then they
[03:42:28.000 --> 03:42:33.680]  can carry out their pre-planned acts of violence and we would see the doj and biden declare an
[03:42:33.680 --> 03:42:38.880]  insurrection maybe the insurrection act and then try things like gun confiscation is that even in
[03:42:38.880 --> 03:42:43.680]  the works we only have a few seconds but go ahead well i mean it that depends upon the sheriffs
[03:42:43.680 --> 03:42:47.360]  mike you know i've had you know sheriff mac i've had sheriff mac on my program many times
[03:42:47.360 --> 03:42:51.120]  we have some constitutional sheriffs here in montana but it just really comes down to the
[03:42:51.120 --> 03:42:54.800]  we're going to break james sorry to cut you off uh stay with us we'll be right back after this break

[03:43:52.960 --> 03:43:59.120]  thank you so much for your support god bless so when i first started taking survival shield
[03:43:59.120 --> 03:44:04.640]  basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely
[03:44:04.640 --> 03:44:09.360]  holding on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got
[03:44:09.360 --> 03:44:14.320]  was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you
[03:44:14.320 --> 03:44:17.920]  came out with that shield you had you know with a deep burn source you know and i got really excited
[03:44:17.920 --> 03:44:23.680]  about that so i took it and man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my
[03:44:23.680 --> 03:44:29.280]  brain was enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the
[03:44:29.280 --> 03:44:34.480]  course of the next couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your
[03:44:34.480 --> 03:44:39.200]  supplements they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout
[03:44:39.200 --> 03:44:43.920]  it literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is
[03:44:43.920 --> 03:44:48.480]  we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to
[03:44:48.480 --> 03:44:53.680]  do that is to take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so much for
[03:44:53.680 --> 03:45:02.480]  your call and godspeed until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world believe that people
[03:45:02.480 --> 03:45:09.040]  got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors they associated
[03:45:09.040 --> 03:45:15.680]  these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill
[03:45:15.680 --> 03:45:23.840]  that killed people what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3 you see the sun via your skin
[03:45:23.840 --> 03:45:30.080]  helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin
[03:45:30.080 --> 03:45:34.960]  d3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body
[03:45:34.960 --> 03:45:40.320]  over so now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin d3
[03:45:40.320 --> 03:45:45.120]  and we have the best with our vitamin d3 gummies with calcium for better upload into your body

[03:45:59.040 --> 03:46:03.760]  why is this taking so long in france they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day
[03:46:03.760 --> 03:46:09.680]  why can't we do this here the answer is fraud and corruption if we don't fix the system it doesn't
[03:46:09.680 --> 03:46:14.560]  matter whether republican nominees donald trump or governor de sanctimonious they're going to deny
[03:46:14.560 --> 03:46:20.160]  us michigan they're going to deny us pennsylvania they're going to deny us arizona and i can't come
[03:46:20.160 --> 03:46:27.680]  to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where i believe there is an america first majority
[03:46:27.680 --> 03:46:34.800]  in every single one of them so we need to keep fighting for reform of the system tucker carlson
[03:46:34.800 --> 03:46:39.280]  said this better last night than anything else communications are the reason why we didn't well
[03:46:39.280 --> 03:46:45.120]  that's why info wars dot com is so damn important that's why they're so desperate to take you off
[03:46:45.120 --> 03:46:51.840]  the air alex people need to get behind info wars this alternative media that we work so hard to
[03:46:51.840 --> 03:46:59.120]  bring you is vitally important we need more of this communications not less leading a frontal
[03:46:59.120 --> 03:47:21.200]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones you found it the tip of the spear it is
[03:47:21.200 --> 03:47:31.600]  the alex jones show with mike adams all right during every break today i am furiously responding
[03:47:31.600 --> 03:47:37.840]  to tax of intel and tips that are coming in just to my phone from people and uh... here's one in
[03:47:37.840 --> 03:47:45.200]  virginia the red precincts are voting they're having turnout at levels that are approaching
[03:47:45.200 --> 03:47:49.520]  a presidential election and yet these are the midterms normally you don't have anywhere near
[03:47:49.520 --> 03:47:55.040]  that level of turnout but in the county's uh... cold pepper spots of ania and green
[03:47:55.040 --> 03:48:00.960]  are reporting near presidential level turnout according to a tweet that i just got and we've
[03:48:00.960 --> 03:48:07.120]  got james white here joining us from northwest liberty news uh... james what you're seeing some
[03:48:07.120 --> 03:48:11.360]  of these numbers as well i know you reported on this earlier today what what are you hearing
[03:48:11.360 --> 03:48:15.360]  what's the latest you have on turnout and the implications for this election
[03:48:15.360 --> 03:48:21.520]  then so in florida and uh... if there's a twitter feed going around by uh... scott presser or
[03:48:21.520 --> 03:48:26.320]  presser i believe and he's done a lot of great work uh... registering folks and uh... in all the
[03:48:26.320 --> 03:48:32.400]  major counties in in in florida the republicans are leading by quite a bit miami date which i
[03:48:32.400 --> 03:48:38.320]  believe is traditionally been sort of a democrat of county is uh... turning strong uh... towards
[03:48:38.320 --> 03:48:42.640]  republicans uh... mike i think people are i just fed up and i think they knew that let's
[03:48:42.640 --> 03:48:47.440]  i say go back to my earlier my earlier point i believe that they realize that they're not
[03:48:47.440 --> 03:48:51.200]  going to get the popular vote so they're gonna have to try to go to the courts now something
[03:48:51.200 --> 03:48:57.200]  just got released here on zero hedge uh... trump calls for action over protest protest
[03:48:57.200 --> 03:49:02.000]  protest is the headline trump calls for action over complete voter integrity disaster
[03:49:02.000 --> 03:49:06.640]  that you thought you mentioned earlier about false flags they could use the now they that
[03:49:06.640 --> 03:49:11.520]  now is the time when they may launch these false flags acting as trump supporters
[03:49:11.520 --> 03:49:16.960]  and point back to this this article that i just uh... talked about and say look trump called
[03:49:16.960 --> 03:49:22.400]  for people to rise up and now they're committing you know uh... a terrorist act because trump is
[03:49:22.400 --> 03:49:29.360]  once again like january six of course don't don't fall for another january six setup folks out there
[03:49:29.360 --> 03:49:37.040]  what you need to do is document everything record video document don't show up with firearms don't
[03:49:37.040 --> 03:49:41.840]  show up dressed in camo because we want to know if anybody showing up at the polling
[03:49:41.840 --> 03:49:48.080]  areas dressed in camo those are feds okay hundred percent feds what you need to do is be cool
[03:49:48.080 --> 03:49:53.760]  be chill and just record everything and then use the platforms that are out there
[03:49:53.760 --> 03:49:57.600]  you know all the free speech video platforms rumble bitch shoot you know my platform bright
[03:49:57.600 --> 03:50:03.680]  town and others wherever you can post odyssey whatever gab i mean get the truth out there
[03:50:03.680 --> 03:50:07.200]  so that other people can start to aggregate this information and that can be evidence
[03:50:07.200 --> 03:50:11.040]  used by law enforcement fact i'm sorry to interrupt james but i just want to urge people
[03:50:11.600 --> 03:50:13.120]  be peaceful in all this but go ahead
[03:50:14.640 --> 03:50:19.200]  no right this is uh... just updated president former president trump is called for protest
[03:50:19.200 --> 03:50:23.440]  over voting irregularities irregularities people in the specifically mentioned detroit
[03:50:23.440 --> 03:50:27.440]  where they people showed up to vote and they said that you've already voted in detroit
[03:50:27.440 --> 03:50:32.720]  this is after last night they detected some nefarious activity going on in an you know
[03:50:32.720 --> 03:50:37.520]  in an undisclosed location empty warehouse they're right close to the to the main election
[03:50:37.520 --> 03:50:43.040]  center there in detroit mike it's just again they don't think they can win unless they cheat
[03:50:43.040 --> 03:50:48.160]  because they don't have better ideas they they hate you can tell they hate this country i think
[03:50:48.160 --> 03:50:53.120]  that's pretty obvious i think people have had enough i think the again the con is running
[03:50:53.120 --> 03:50:56.480]  and that's where the most dangerous that's when they're the most dangerous picture right now but
[03:50:56.480 --> 03:51:02.400]  the democrats want an insurrection attempt by conservatives that's very clear and they're
[03:51:02.400 --> 03:51:06.880]  they're going to try to bait conservatives into that kind of action i mean i essentially the
[03:51:06.880 --> 03:51:12.080]  democrats are going to i think blatantly cheat at such a degree that everybody knows they're
[03:51:12.080 --> 03:51:16.480]  cheating and they're basically saying what are you going to do about it and then they hope
[03:51:16.480 --> 03:51:23.040]  that a few nutjobs or feds will pick up guns or something and do something crazy and people
[03:51:23.040 --> 03:51:27.760]  you need to resist that you need to work this through the courts you need to work this through
[03:51:27.760 --> 03:51:35.120]  evidence and due process and the truth will come out so i know you agree with that james i i just
[03:51:35.120 --> 03:51:41.120]  i'm i just need to reiterate that multiple times right and don't believe you know i guess i would
[03:51:41.120 --> 03:51:45.600]  say don't believe anything that you see on television like not even fox news and a lot of people
[03:51:45.600 --> 03:51:50.800]  probably across over and watch fox news they're no better than the rest they just they're just
[03:51:50.800 --> 03:51:57.280]  the gatekeepers for the right so go to places like info wars mike adams you know natural news
[03:51:57.280 --> 03:52:01.520]  and other places to get your news because we're coming to a time i believe when that's going to
[03:52:01.520 --> 03:52:06.400]  be a very very valuable commodity is truthful information and it's going to be i mean harder
[03:52:06.400 --> 03:52:10.480]  and harder to find well said and speaking of that what what's your main website for northwest
[03:52:10.480 --> 03:52:15.680]  liberty news northward so many news dot com northward so many news dot com what i'm really

[03:52:49.840 --> 03:52:53.600]  and and you so uh that's what i'm really most excited about is the solution series right now

[03:52:59.600 --> 03:53:04.960]  across independent media the the true media in america and i was just coordinating during the
[03:53:04.960 --> 03:53:09.680]  break uh ova schreuer is going to pop in on my network later tonight because we're we're doing
[03:53:09.680 --> 03:53:13.920]  live coverage info wars doing live coverage i'll probably pop back in here on info wars

[03:53:19.840 --> 03:53:23.760]  people i've got an vanderstiel popping in and things like that but everybody's working together
[03:53:24.320 --> 03:53:29.360]  and we're all supporting each other through this because we know that's it you know we we hang
[03:53:29.360 --> 03:53:33.920]  together or we hang separately right that's and that's the attitude and folks you know
[03:53:34.800 --> 03:53:39.120]  there's so much support that's come out in favor of info wars and i believe the website save
[03:53:39.120 --> 03:53:44.960]  info wars dot com is where you can donate to info wars and you can also support the info wars store
[03:53:44.960 --> 03:53:48.960]  that's info wars store dot com i apologize i'm not familiar with the current specials happening
[03:53:48.960 --> 03:53:53.920]  there but there's always different specials but folks this is this is it this is game time
[03:53:53.920 --> 03:53:58.240]  like we pull together and help each other and overcome this tyranny and the cheating
[03:53:58.240 --> 03:54:04.480]  and we can bring this constitutional republic you know back from the dead we can resurrect it
[03:54:04.480 --> 03:54:10.400]  back from the dead peacefully without having bloodshed or violence or anything like that and
[03:54:10.400 --> 03:54:14.880]  i see that info wars store has the uh early black friday sale going on so that's that's what you
[03:54:14.880 --> 03:54:21.120]  can check out there but it's you know it's just it's truly it's truly amazing and we just sent out
[03:54:21.680 --> 03:54:26.160]  i don't know we sent out a hundred thousand dollars for the checks recently to independent
[03:54:26.160 --> 03:54:32.480]  media outlets uh gary haven gave us a donation to distribute to other people in this space
[03:54:32.480 --> 03:54:37.760]  and i just got a text from uh he probably won't mind that i say uh shan over at sgt report he got
[03:54:37.760 --> 03:54:42.240]  the check he you know he was just thanking us for the donation we we've sent out checks to all kinds
[03:54:42.240 --> 03:54:46.800]  of people this is what it's going to take folks we work together to take this country back uh back
[03:54:46.800 --> 03:54:51.520]  to you james i can too want to say i've been sitting on my broadcast recently because people
[03:54:51.520 --> 03:54:56.160]  that have committed crimes of course deserve to be punished for the crimes but people that
[03:54:56.160 --> 03:55:01.440]  maybe you got crossways with or you didn't see eye eye on things and maybe you had words
[03:55:01.440 --> 03:55:06.720]  we're gonna have to get to a point where we we reconcile and we forgive um you know as i said
[03:55:06.720 --> 03:55:11.120]  if people can have committed crimes and and they the stuff that you know after they go through due
[03:55:11.120 --> 03:55:15.120]  process if it's determined they committed crimes they should be punished for those crimes but you
[03:55:15.120 --> 03:55:19.760]  know families have gotten fractured friends have gotten fact fractured you know people in
[03:55:19.760 --> 03:55:24.000]  churches have gotten fractured over in the last couple three years over the scandemic i just
[03:55:24.000 --> 03:55:28.800]  think we need to get to a point where we reach some level of forgiveness and and have to just
[03:55:28.800 --> 03:55:33.040]  you know you can't hold on to that stuff forever because it just it tears you up on the inside
[03:55:33.040 --> 03:55:38.720]  so that's why i know that's that's the christian thing to do james but also i want to say i believe
[03:55:38.720 --> 03:55:44.880]  a lot of these left-wing authoritarians they are incapable of empathy they are incapable of apology
[03:55:44.880 --> 03:55:49.680]  and they're they only want amnesty now because they got caught and they will abuse you the
[03:55:49.680 --> 03:55:53.920]  first chance they get they frankly they will murder you the first chance they get if they can
[03:55:53.920 --> 03:55:57.760]  take your guns away and then call you terrorists which is pretty much the plan that's unfolding
[03:55:57.760 --> 03:56:04.000]  right now so i mean i agree with you in principle forgiveness can be part of the thing down the
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:08.960]  road but they've got to apologize they got to be prosecuted they got to serve their time
[03:56:09.600 --> 03:56:12.640]  for the crimes they committed against our children our families our businesses our
[03:56:12.640 --> 03:56:18.560]  country our constitution all that stuff i'm not forgiving them one minute until they face the
[03:56:18.560 --> 03:56:22.880]  music for what they did to us well those aren't really the people i was referring to i was referring
[03:56:22.880 --> 03:56:27.840]  to more like your friends and family in your close knit group of folks that don't want to see you dead
[03:56:27.840 --> 03:56:31.920]  you know and those other people you're right i agree with you yeah i'm talking about the
[03:56:31.920 --> 03:56:38.880]  authoritarian tyrants right on i'm with you no no argument there yeah the forgiveness doesn't
[03:56:38.880 --> 03:56:44.400]  come that easily i mean sure i'll i'll read scripture and it'll say forgive everybody but
[03:56:44.400 --> 03:56:48.240]  guess what they also need to own up to what they did but anyway that that's an interesting
[03:56:48.240 --> 03:56:52.320]  philosophical discussion uh in about a minute we have left what's your summary for what today's
[03:56:52.320 --> 03:56:57.520]  going to look like well you know i think today is going to go the way of you know i think there's
[03:56:57.520 --> 03:57:00.400]  too many people coming out i don't think they can they can fully steal it they're gonna they're
[03:57:00.400 --> 03:57:04.880]  gonna try to in some locations and they're gonna do a pretty decent job but what concerns me is
[03:57:05.520 --> 03:57:09.200]  you know a repeat of what happened a couple of years ago burning down cities pulling people out
[03:57:09.200 --> 03:57:13.440]  of vehicles uh you know that type of stuff is that what's going to happen is that how they're
[03:57:13.440 --> 03:57:18.320]  going to react to i think probably one of the most colossal losses in the history of politics
[03:57:18.320 --> 03:57:22.880]  coming up here um how are the how are those radical on the left gonna gonna act i mean they
[03:57:22.880 --> 03:57:27.280]  i think it could be very very dicey in the next four or five days i think we really need to
