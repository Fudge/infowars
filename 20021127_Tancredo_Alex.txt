[00:00.000 --> 00:07.200]  communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:10.640 --> 00:16.000]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen as we blast out worldwide defending this constitutional republic
[00:16.720 --> 00:23.360]  from enemies foreign and domestic there are only a few congressmen that have a good voting record
[00:23.360 --> 00:29.840]  one of them is Ron Paul of course Bob Smith is one of the few good senators we've got as you just heard
[00:29.920 --> 00:34.560]  blocking the republicans passing an incredible god grab bill that they passed out of the house
[00:34.560 --> 00:43.360]  two weeks ago we are now joined by congressman Tom Tancredo of Colorado and he's going to need
[00:43.360 --> 00:49.280]  your help in the next election he beat his opponent the democrat by 37 points a lot of
[00:49.280 --> 00:55.680]  democrats voted for him which outraged Lord Bush according to roll call a newspaper here also
[00:55.680 --> 01:00.880]  Newsmax GOP targets pro-borders Tancredo representative Tom Tancredo the nation's most outspoken
[01:00.880 --> 01:05.680]  opponent of the invasion of legal of illegal aliens is being targeted for defeat not by the
[01:05.680 --> 01:11.360]  democrats but by the GOP establishment Ron Paul's had the same problems probably means he'll win by
[01:11.360 --> 01:17.040]  by 40 points next time but we'll see joining us and I know he's very busy before they leave for
[01:17.040 --> 01:22.800]  the thanksgiving recess is the congressman welcome sir for having me on I appreciate it
[01:23.600 --> 01:28.960]  absolutely sir why is it every time somebody does the basic stuff for America they get attacked by
[01:28.960 --> 01:34.640]  Lord Bush yeah I think the problem is really a guy by the name of Carl Rove to tell you the truth
[01:35.600 --> 01:42.240]  you know Carl gets up every single day he's the political watchdog in the white house and his he
[01:42.240 --> 01:48.080]  says you know what do I do today to get my boss re-elected and that's all he thinks about and
[01:48.080 --> 01:51.440]  probably that's all he should think about it that's you know what he's supposed to do but
[01:51.440 --> 01:56.880]  the reality is that he is I think a little more aggressive when it comes to
[01:59.040 --> 02:05.680]  well being willing to overlook what should be some basic policy principles that we should stand on
[02:05.680 --> 02:12.080]  regardless of what happens politically and so I really think he's much more of the problem
[02:12.080 --> 02:19.520]  than the president himself but you know the the this issue is one that I'm certainly not going
[02:19.520 --> 02:24.160]  to go away from no matter what happens no matter what they do no matter how if they you know they
[02:24.160 --> 02:28.640]  are looking to try to run a primary against me they're looking for people out here to actually
[02:28.640 --> 02:34.240]  run in a primary they know they probably cannot defeat me in a general election with a democrat
[02:34.240 --> 02:38.160]  but they are looking for somebody else to do it and I don't care if I have to fight a primary
[02:38.160 --> 02:43.360]  every two years I don't care what happens this issue is bigger than you know a bridge in my
[02:43.360 --> 02:48.160]  district or something like that to fight about this is the this is the future of the country
[02:48.160 --> 02:54.560]  well it is I had uh congressman-elect Gil Halva on yesterday and he came right out and he said
[02:54.560 --> 03:01.680]  I'm a member of Metcha I believe Texas to California belongs to Aslan he said he said that
[03:01.680 --> 03:07.120]  this is a reality we've got to face it I said well we get we're getting border patrol shot forest
[03:07.120 --> 03:12.800]  service officers killed FBI agents brains being bashed in one in a coma I said if I try to go
[03:12.800 --> 03:17.040]  across the border Mexican troops will shoot me and he just said well that doesn't really matter
[03:17.040 --> 03:23.680]  I mean this guy he's being destroyed and the globalists want an open border oh absolutely
[03:23.680 --> 03:28.640]  they do um remember I think I may have mentioned this last time I was on your show but I it's
[03:28.640 --> 03:36.160]  worth perhaps repeating when I was in Mexico I'm speaking to the then head of the newly created
[03:36.160 --> 03:44.160]  agency called the ministry for Mexicans living in the United States and the guy his name is Juan
[03:44.160 --> 03:52.640]  Hernandez Mr Hernandez is a citizen of Mexico and a citizen of the United States born in Texas
[03:52.640 --> 03:59.600]  he now or was at the time anyway sitting on the cabinet of a foreign government Mexico and
[04:00.160 --> 04:04.960]  when we talked about this issue with him he explained that that part of his responsibility
[04:04.960 --> 04:09.280]  was to make sure that as many Mexican nationals came into the United States as possible while
[04:09.280 --> 04:15.360]  they're setting up offices in Houston in Chicago at an old train station this is a big operation
[04:15.360 --> 04:20.720]  it is a big operation and their purpose I said you know what what is it you're trying to accomplish
[04:20.720 --> 04:25.440]  and he says well you know congressman is pretty simple you know as many if we can get a large
[04:25.440 --> 04:29.920]  population of Mexican nationals living in the United States it will influence your policy
[04:29.920 --> 04:34.800]  vis-a-vis Mexico and he said there is also the aspect of the money that they sent home which is
[04:34.800 --> 04:42.400]  now 30% of the GDP in Mexico can you imagine that 30% of the GDP comes from Mexican nationals
[04:42.400 --> 04:46.720]  outside of Mexico sending money back home and then we've got these local political bosses that
[04:46.720 --> 04:52.160]  want to have racial politics so they want the entire third world south of the border to come
[04:52.160 --> 04:58.640]  up here another 15 to 20 million bursas you're down there I mean he went on to say
[04:59.440 --> 05:06.880]  um this is a direct quote that I always say is one of the most candid statements I've heard from
[05:06.880 --> 05:14.320]  a Mexican official he said congressman it's not two countries it's just a region
[05:16.080 --> 05:21.520]  now that was his honest assessment it is an assessment that is by the way held by many
[05:21.520 --> 05:26.720]  people and Mexico and even in the United States and that's the whole united nations line that's
[05:26.720 --> 05:32.320]  right and bush is just going along with this in fact uh Gil halva who we had on yesterday the new
[05:32.320 --> 05:37.680]  congressman from Arizona he said look all we're doing is legalizing a reality he wants total
[05:37.680 --> 05:43.280]  like an amnesty now bush has said he wants amnesty how do we stop this because we know according to
[05:43.280 --> 05:49.360]  gallup polls 80 of americans 80 plus percent want the borders control want illegals deported
[05:49.360 --> 05:54.560]  most hispanics do as well they're trying to make it a racial issue it's not a racial issue how do
[05:54.560 --> 06:00.320]  we effectively force congress to carry out the constitution and the will of the people I'll tell
[06:00.320 --> 06:04.400]  you right now that I believe that we have our caucus the immigration reform caucus which I
[06:04.400 --> 06:10.080]  started several years ago has grown to the point where we have become effective in doing one thing
[06:10.080 --> 06:16.080]  and that is stopping the attempt stopping the momentum heading toward open borders I cannot tell
[06:16.080 --> 06:20.640]  you that I have been able to reverse that but I can tell you that I believe we have been able to
[06:20.640 --> 06:26.560]  stop it and I think we will be able to stop it because the majority the last time we had a vote
[06:26.560 --> 06:32.320]  on this a majority of republicans in our conference voted with me to stop the amnesty now that was
[06:32.320 --> 06:38.480]  being pushed by the president of the united states you can imagine how much guts that took for I mean
[06:38.480 --> 06:44.400]  honest to god for for uh over 100 members of the republican caucus to support our efforts to stop
[06:44.400 --> 06:50.080]  it I think we can here's our danger our danger isn't so much in the congress because honestly I
[06:50.080 --> 06:56.000]  think we can stop the movement toward amnesty but what's going to happen is that they are going to
[06:56.000 --> 07:03.040]  achieve it state by state city by city municipality by municipality through the matricula card
[07:03.040 --> 07:07.520]  distribution are you familiar with this well yeah now they hand out the mexican id card about
[07:07.520 --> 07:13.040]  dozens of us cities from san francisco to houston are saying they will accept that also houston
[07:13.040 --> 07:18.880]  chronicle reported along with christian science monitor that since 96 the irs issues tax id
[07:18.880 --> 07:24.720]  numbers under any fictitious name is that anybody whether they're russian mexican or chinese can go
[07:24.720 --> 07:30.640]  and get a fake social security card then get a bank account then get welfare well here's the
[07:30.640 --> 07:34.720]  point congressman i'm sure you may i know you've made this point they're telling americans to
[07:34.720 --> 07:39.680]  accept military occupation to accept northcom and and the total information awareness surveillance
[07:39.680 --> 07:44.640]  network but at the same time our borders are to be wide open and the government's handing out fake
[07:44.640 --> 07:49.200]  ids isn't that incredible it isn't our government this is the government of mexico that's through
[07:49.200 --> 07:54.000]  their counselor office but through the irs they also give them you're right you're right that is
[07:54.000 --> 07:59.440]  absolutely accurate i'm telling you that this is the most bizarre system and situation i've ever
[07:59.440 --> 08:04.480]  seen in my life we're sending military people across the world to defend other borders we refuse
[08:04.480 --> 08:09.520]  to put them on our own we are fearful of actually stopping the flow of illegal immigrants into this
[08:09.520 --> 08:15.360]  country because the the political ramifications of that might be harmful to some people i'll tell
[08:15.360 --> 08:24.960]  you right now that leaving this country vulnerable as we are undeniably there isn't a human being on
[08:24.960 --> 08:30.320]  the planet who doesn't understand the porous natures of our border and the danger that that
[08:30.320 --> 08:36.800]  poses and yet and yet even with that knowledge we refuse to do anything significant to stop it
[08:36.800 --> 08:41.840]  i think that is honestly despicable i don't know any other word to describe it because
[08:41.840 --> 08:46.560]  you you're looking at a situation where are the federal government's primary responsibility the
[08:46.560 --> 08:51.040]  one thing we are supposed to do is to protect the lives of property the people of the country all
[08:51.040 --> 08:57.200]  the other garbage we get involved with is all extraneous now you know go find me the department
[08:57.200 --> 09:01.760]  of education in the constitution or the health and human services none of it is there none of it do we
[09:01.760 --> 09:06.960]  need well it's we need one thing protect our borders and and we can't even won't even do that
[09:06.960 --> 09:11.760]  well it's all getting radically expanded and uh it's only going to get worse we're going to be
[09:11.760 --> 09:17.120]  held hostage by these foreign groups that are here with their local political leaders who have a stake
[09:17.120 --> 09:22.720]  in expanding this the corporations want to lower wages uh this is coming to a head though i mean
[09:22.720 --> 09:28.240]  look you won by 37 percent roll call reported that you were only one of 10 other congressmen
[09:28.240 --> 09:34.800]  and a win by this type of majority um this shows that your view is actually popular even with most
[09:34.800 --> 09:40.160]  immigrants who have now become uh citizens isn't this about globalism though and merging us into
[09:40.160 --> 09:45.680]  one pan-american region you know i've already said that oh absolutely you know they it's called uh
[09:45.680 --> 09:51.920]  the free trade area of the americas now and this is uh something that is designed to essentially
[09:51.920 --> 09:59.040]  eliminate the borders um allow for the quote free flow of goods and services and people not to be
[09:59.040 --> 10:05.840]  you know hindered by such a anachronistic concept as a border and you know even after 911 you think
[10:05.840 --> 10:09.840]  is are there still people on this planet who honestly believe that that aren't being chased
[10:09.840 --> 10:17.440]  around with somebody with a net i cannot believe that anyone in their right mind now well thinks
[10:17.440 --> 10:22.480]  that borders that borders aren't meaningful well you say that it seems crazy but not if
[10:22.480 --> 10:27.360]  terrorism is just an excuse to get more control let's take a quick call congressman tom tancredo
[10:27.360 --> 10:31.520]  john in illinois you're on the air with the congressman go ahead quickly thanks alex uh
[10:31.520 --> 10:37.520]  briefly i talked to my kindle county sheriff here in illinois and told him about the border problem
[10:37.520 --> 10:41.200]  and he kind of shrugged his shoulders and said well there's not really much we can do about it
[10:41.680 --> 10:47.280]  uh and that uh it's no big deal because uh we're all immigrants anyways how do i deal with the
[10:47.280 --> 10:52.640]  republican sheriff like yeah what do we do about this capitulation to the six and a half billion
[10:52.640 --> 10:58.080]  third world populations coming here the 400 million from the south well you know i don't
[10:58.080 --> 11:04.640]  know how long you have to talk to him to explain the real problems we face but the reality is that
[11:04.640 --> 11:09.280]  we're all a nation of immigrants but when our grandfathers came here how many of them asked
[11:09.280 --> 11:15.360]  to have dual citizenship status for starters how many of them said that the u.s belongs to the
[11:15.360 --> 11:19.440]  aztecs how many of them said they actually didn't even want to be part of america that they wanted
[11:19.440 --> 11:23.520]  to maintain their their tongue their language and their political affiliation with their
[11:23.520 --> 11:29.840]  old country none of them well you know one percent maybe i don't know but today six million americans
[11:29.840 --> 11:36.000]  living here right now with dual citizenship um the idea that we tell people all the time that
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.040]  their children should should if they come here with a different language should retain that
[11:41.040 --> 11:44.800]  language congressman we've got a break i understand you're busy if you've got to go you've got to go
[11:44.800 --> 11:48.640]  can you stay with us for 10 more minutes yes sir all right stay right there appreciate that
[11:48.640 --> 11:53.600]  we'll be right back after this quick break uh with the congressman if you'd like to get involved 800
[11:53.600 --> 12:03.600]  2599231 tom dancritos joining us
[12:03.600 --> 12:15.280]  so we have our illustrious republican congress that passed hr 4757 our lady of peace act
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.600]  the most draconian gun control bill since the 1968 gun control act and now this headline gop
[12:21.600 --> 12:29.680]  targets pro borders tan credo basics ladies and gentlemen if you try to sneak into other countries
[12:29.680 --> 12:34.640]  they will shoot you especially mexico and now we have mexican troops shooting up
[12:34.640 --> 12:40.880]  border patrol vehicles on a weekly basis we have massive drug dealing incredible corruption an
[12:40.880 --> 12:46.320]  outbreak of hemorrhagic fever over the texas border last week that's akin to ebola drug
[12:46.320 --> 12:53.520]  resistant tb russian mafia taking over los angeles asian triads on the east and west coast where does
[12:53.520 --> 12:59.200]  it end and the media balkanizing everybody with this multiculturalism and that's the point you
[12:59.280 --> 13:04.240]  were trying to make congressman the last segment was we do see a balkanization these people are
[13:04.240 --> 13:09.040]  not trying to go into the melting pot are they they are not they they do not come here for this
[13:09.040 --> 13:14.880]  that reason even they do not come here when you ask them you know we will we would talk to to
[13:14.880 --> 13:21.120]  border patrol people and ins agents at length and they'll say you know most of these folks aren't
[13:21.120 --> 13:25.920]  coming here to be americans they they are coming here to get a job get some money eventually you
[13:25.920 --> 13:30.560]  know send it back home maybe return but the reality is they're not interested in becoming
[13:30.560 --> 13:36.160]  americans and this is different this is not that you know you're this is not your father's
[13:36.160 --> 13:43.360]  immigration plan it is a new phenomenon and it's something that is going to destroy this country
[13:43.360 --> 13:48.000]  i say this over and over again that massive immigration into this country will determine
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.520]  not just what kind of country we are that is balkanized divided or united it will determine
[13:53.520 --> 13:58.800]  whether we will be a country at all and i believe that with all my heart and i will therefore never
[13:58.800 --> 14:03.280]  surrender this fight and i don't care who my opposition is and i don't care how powerful they
[14:03.280 --> 14:08.880]  are this is something that is goes to the core of our existence and of our continued well-being
[14:08.880 --> 14:13.440]  well congressman you say it's political expediency the republicans and democrats do this but
[14:13.440 --> 14:20.000]  look at the numbers uh you won by 37 over your opponent i've seen the polls i already mentioned
[14:20.320 --> 14:26.000]  80 plus percent of americans know this is a problem it goes across racial lines so it shows
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.080]  that it's actually an establishment move to balkanize to subdivide to divide and conquer
[14:32.080 --> 14:37.440]  this country yes and here's what they think i believe you know you have to see yourself why
[14:37.440 --> 14:43.440]  why would people who ostensibly go out and ask for votes and try their best to figure out which
[14:43.440 --> 14:48.400]  way the wind is blowing on any particular issue before they take a stand why would they not
[14:49.280 --> 14:53.600]  understand what you just said eighty percent of the people want some control over these borders
[14:53.600 --> 14:58.320]  and why wouldn't they vote that way and i tell you what i think is that is going on here
[14:59.680 --> 15:03.600]  for a lot of them for a lot of folks i mean you know these are just what i'm going to talk about
[15:03.600 --> 15:09.360]  now are people that don't necessarily have a hidden agenda they just want to get re-elected
[15:09.360 --> 15:13.600]  okay and they think to themselves they can have it both ways they can tender to an immigrant
[15:13.600 --> 15:20.640]  community for votes while at the same time um assuaging the the concerns of the people who do
[15:20.640 --> 15:24.560]  bring this issue up because they think well you know it's not their number one issue it's down
[15:24.560 --> 15:30.480]  there three or four layers and and as long as it doesn't as long as it's never presented to them as
[15:30.480 --> 15:36.880]  being they will ignore that constituent well i agree with you but i listen to talk radio all
[15:36.880 --> 15:41.920]  over the country i've done 500 interviews in the last 14 months this is the number one issue i just
[15:41.920 --> 15:46.080]  wish that people you know somehow that's got to be communicated to the people who are running for
[15:46.080 --> 15:52.240]  office there it's the number one issue then why would the guy that you just um i forgot his name
[15:52.240 --> 15:59.120]  i'm sorry the new newly elected howler how the why how in the world is i think is he from southern
[15:59.120 --> 16:06.800]  arizona yes you know this is amazing i went to visit a huge chunk of his district his new you
[16:06.800 --> 16:13.680]  know it's it is his new district i remember now it's been redistricted um and the the incumbent
[16:13.680 --> 16:19.440]  congressman is still there a democrat liberal has simply uh lost that part this guy took on took it
[16:19.440 --> 16:27.280]  on but a big chunk of his district is the uh an indian reservation the tona autumn indian
[16:27.280 --> 16:33.680]  reservation where they are begging for help where 1500 people a day come across and the newspapers
[16:33.680 --> 16:40.480]  in mexico city use horrible racial terms towards the indians yes oh absolutely they let me tell you
[16:41.120 --> 16:47.520]  mexico has a caste system that would make ours look like a a cakewalk real quick one quick call
[16:47.520 --> 16:53.120]  congressman we'll let you go here okay wayne in texas you're on the air go ahead quickly wayne
[16:53.120 --> 16:59.840]  go ahead wayne hi alex yeah here's my question for the congressman um there's two issues that
[16:59.840 --> 17:05.040]  i think could galvanize public support that is uh learning more about the criminal statistics
[17:05.040 --> 17:09.840]  about the murderers and rapists half of the los angeles county jail illegals yeah exactly but you
[17:09.840 --> 17:14.960]  know that's not that the media covers it up the mainstream media and also the money spent on
[17:14.960 --> 17:20.240]  housing food stamps and utility bills or whatever that comes out of our taxes let me get a quick
