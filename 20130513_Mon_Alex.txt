[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:27.320]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27.320 --> 00:37.160]  This is going to be an ultra-important radio broadcast today, the 13th of May, 2013. I am
[00:37.160 --> 00:44.120]  your host, Alex Jones. We've got Paul Joseph Watson at the bottom of the hour, and I read
[00:44.120 --> 00:48.080]  the special report that he put together with some of my notes that were added to it. That's
[00:48.080 --> 00:53.600]  why it's Paul Watson and Alex Jones. And I just called him up about 10 minutes ago and
[00:53.600 --> 01:00.080]  I said, please add some of these hardcore points to the article that we have sources
[01:00.080 --> 01:06.680]  that said we need to go check out Google's connection to Bilderberg years ago. And those
[01:06.680 --> 01:12.400]  same sources said, hey, this is a special meeting going on. You need to go check out
[01:12.400 --> 01:18.560]  the Grove Hotel, Northwest of London, because something big is happening there. And then
[01:18.560 --> 01:26.000]  Watson stumbled with our Info Wars Auxiliary reporter with him into the middle of something
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  very big and got a lot of key data from multiple high-level people there at the meeting. Because
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.960]  they think the public is so stupid, they're hiding this in plain view. Guard Shacks being
[01:35.960 --> 01:41.680]  built, Google people scaring around. Google starts meeting there next week. This is where
[01:41.680 --> 01:47.480]  they met to plan the Arab Spring. That's now been admitted. They were bragging about that.
[01:47.480 --> 01:55.040]  And the torch is being passed by David Rockefeller and others to Schmidt of Google. And they're
[01:55.040 --> 02:03.040]  moving totally to the technocracy. So this is a big deal. This really adds to the years
[02:03.040 --> 02:08.440]  of research we've done on Bilderberg, intensely for the last decade, and tracking them to
[02:08.440 --> 02:13.920]  Switzerland and documenting a bunch of Google execs, including Schmidt there, leading some
[02:13.920 --> 02:21.960]  of the meetings inside all of this information coming up today with Paul Joseph Watson at
[02:21.960 --> 02:29.360]  the bottom of the hour. And then Catherine Albrecht, Dr. Catherine Albrecht, technology
[02:29.360 --> 02:37.360]  expert, consumer advocate, she is going to be joining us to talk about Google. I set
[02:37.360 --> 02:40.520]  her up last week, but basically canceled her, had her on for like 10 minutes instead of
[02:40.520 --> 02:48.040]  an hour because of Benghazi Gate on Thursday, moving her to this week to talk about Google.
[02:48.040 --> 02:51.280]  And sure, we know Google's big. We know that they want to be the internet. We know that
[02:51.280 --> 02:58.640]  they're dominating on so many fronts. But do we really understand it is to be the technocracy,
[02:58.640 --> 03:02.960]  the digital skin? It's the group allowed to break into your computer without warrants
[03:02.960 --> 03:08.800]  and steal all your data. It's the group sharing all of your data. It's the group created by
[03:08.800 --> 03:16.600]  the CIA and National Security Agency. It will absorb the old real web, the organic web,
[03:16.600 --> 03:23.000]  and force you onto its controlled web. That's part of the internet to plan. Oh, you can
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.120]  be on the old internet that's falling apart and shut down, but Google won't let you access
[03:27.120 --> 03:32.280]  internet to run by them and the government globally governments with a hundred times
[03:32.280 --> 03:36.600]  faster internet. That's what they're designing. That's what they're setting up. That's what
[03:36.600 --> 03:43.960]  they're rolling out. So bottom of the hour, Google Berg. This is the most important meeting
[03:43.960 --> 03:53.960]  of Bilderberg in its 60 plus years since they first met in 1954 officially. And that too
[03:53.960 --> 04:00.280]  had a bunch of lead up meetings, meetings during and meetings after this is a mega jumbo real
[04:00.280 --> 04:07.320]  lining metamorphosis technocratic meeting. And at the meeting, they have a sculpture
[04:07.320 --> 04:14.120]  of a human skeleton being absorbed by a computer. That photo is up on info wars.com. The article
[04:14.120 --> 04:23.720]  is red linked Google Berg Google merges with Bilderberg Google Berg Google taking over
[04:23.720 --> 04:32.000]  the planet. Google Berg global elite transforms itself from into technocratic revolution.
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.760]  Google Berg global elite transforms itself for technocratic technotronic technocratic
[04:37.760 --> 04:45.920]  revolution. Authoritarian anti democratic power networks are being rebranded as trendy
[04:45.920 --> 04:54.560]  philanthropic style groups. And again, Watson has been working on this article for days.
[04:54.560 --> 05:02.160]  We'll be right back. Ladies and gentlemen, on the other side, introducing pro one all

[07:05.640 --> 07:10.920]  and floods raged across the US costing us 20 billion and lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[07:10.920 --> 07:15.200]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight
[07:15.200 --> 07:20.480]  out of mind and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.

[08:08.560 --> 08:25.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[08:25.640 --> 08:35.320]  Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us. It is the 13th day of May 2013.
[08:35.320 --> 08:42.200]  We are going to be here for the next three hours. We have big breaking Bilderberg slash
[08:42.200 --> 08:49.040]  Google global governance news. We have Bill Gates who frequently attends Bilderberg but
[08:49.040 --> 08:57.000]  also the head of Google. Eric Schmidt also has been videotaped attending as well as
[08:57.000 --> 09:04.200]  Zuckerberg the head of Facebook planning that pump and dump two years ago in Switzerland
[09:04.200 --> 09:10.400]  with the stock. But from our sources and on the ground confirmation we have confirmed
[09:10.400 --> 09:17.960]  that Google is basically running Bilderberg 2013 and meeting several weeks in advance
[09:17.960 --> 09:28.960]  at the same hotel where Project X of the OSS was run during World War II. Now why do globalists
[09:28.960 --> 09:33.000]  not meet at government compounds? Because that could be under surveillance. Government
[09:33.000 --> 09:40.040]  people could blow the whistle. When you have these criminal networks meeting they do it
[09:40.040 --> 09:48.960]  outside of government but use local police as their security force. And the mayor of
[09:48.960 --> 09:54.280]  the local town of Wadford northwest of London it's an elitist area has come out and said
[09:54.280 --> 09:59.120]  oh horrible protesters I'm sure they'll be violent horrible people I've got our quotes
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.440]  there in the paper but I still feel honored that we're prestigious enough to host this
[10:04.440 --> 10:11.120]  Bilderberg group conference. So she's saying it's prestigious horrible rabble coming to
[10:11.120 --> 10:17.280]  protest it she hopes they can be stopped Wadford mayor Bilderberg protesters can and do cause
[10:17.280 --> 10:22.400]  violence and disturbance and that's the actual quote and then she goes on to say oh thank
[10:22.400 --> 10:29.000]  goodness we're we're prestigious enough venue it's quote very good the Grove has been deemed
[10:29.000 --> 10:39.000]  a prestigious enough venue for us to be able to host it but it's horrible that vicious
[10:39.000 --> 10:46.520]  people from all over the world are going to be traveling here as royalty and world leaders
[10:46.520 --> 10:53.520]  meet in secret with robber barons carving up the world oh it's so terrible that anyone
[10:53.520 --> 11:02.240]  that an alternative press dare cover it so see she's in the local paper going oh yeah
[11:02.240 --> 11:06.960]  you know global governments coming here to meet in town horrible rabble I guess she didn't
[11:06.960 --> 11:12.280]  get to memo Bilderberg group doesn't exist the New York Times says when I covered it
[11:12.280 --> 11:16.320]  five years ago when no one could find Obama in DC with Hillary we knew they were there
[11:16.320 --> 11:20.680]  secret service came in we confirm we were there I called the press the mainstream president
[11:20.680 --> 11:30.040]  they said we're not coming to that the epoch Times covered it and that was it and so the
[11:30.040 --> 11:33.840]  New York Times a year later came out and said oh there's a film about it called New World
[11:33.840 --> 11:42.720]  Order Alex Jones was in a in a hotel parking lot imagining global elite were meeting imagine
[11:42.720 --> 11:47.720]  he imagined there were two billion bullets he imagined the IRS was persecuting tea party
[11:47.720 --> 11:53.320]  groups and patriot groups he imagined government documents four years ago given to him by state
[11:53.320 --> 11:58.240]  police and federal marshals more than eight different documents where they said returning
[11:58.240 --> 12:03.840]  veterans gun owners libertarians conservatives would be the new terror threat not al-Qaeda
[12:03.840 --> 12:10.080]  of course it all turned out to be real documents and it's now mainstream news I imagined it
[12:10.080 --> 12:17.480]  all I imagined the sun came up this morning so Paul Watson is going to be joining us and
[12:17.480 --> 12:24.400]  we're going to be breaking down the biggest developments in Bilderberg's official history
[12:24.400 --> 12:32.440]  since 1954 oh and I'm afraid that even if corporate dinosaur media doesn't cover it
[12:32.440 --> 12:41.600]  here in the United States I'm afraid it will end up getting covered oh I'm afraid so and
[12:41.600 --> 12:47.080]  that will only hurt your credibility that much worse so please do what you always do
[12:47.080 --> 12:53.160]  and be conceded be arrogant and and treat your readers and your viewers like their morons
[12:53.160 --> 13:00.840]  Pierce Morgan and Rachel Maddow and watch your audiences dwindle by the week Rachel your
[13:00.840 --> 13:07.960]  audience was 800,000 a year ago it's 400,000 now oh just a year ago Pierce Morgan your
[13:07.960 --> 13:14.880]  audience was a million now it's 400,000 trending to be 300,000 in a month at the current plunge
[13:14.880 --> 13:22.000]  rate oh you're hemorrhaging out but it kind of feels good though they're in the last
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.920]  minutes politically of your of your waning star because of the endorphins flow and you
[13:28.920 --> 13:37.840]  kind of enter a type of rapture politically as you die politically it's like roaches
[13:37.840 --> 13:42.840]  if you spray them with poison they run around euphorically for a few seconds before flopping
[13:42.840 --> 13:51.720]  on their backs oh Pierce Morgan hopes for CNN talk show to rebound like a dead cat bounce
[13:51.720 --> 13:56.160]  after getting beaten up in the ratings it was like an explosion when I went on a show
[13:56.160 --> 14:02.080]  January 7th suddenly two million viewers they only had about 600,000 then they get a few
[14:02.080 --> 14:06.720]  months before that a million and it exploded and for about a week or so he had a million
[14:06.720 --> 14:15.680]  and then 800,000 700,000 600,000 500,000 400,000 like an explosion like he was an attack frigate
[14:15.680 --> 14:21.320]  orbiting above our city and we blasted it with heavy guns and it exploded everyone look
[14:21.320 --> 14:33.000]  look at the oh he's big there's Morgan is big he's big again as he exploded oh and then
[14:33.000 --> 14:39.000]  they declared their victory over this in the dying dinosaur media they declared their
[14:39.000 --> 14:46.200]  victory and danced in an imaginary victory dance spiking a football in the end zone
[14:46.200 --> 14:54.200]  as they burned oh there'll be more fireworks for these people but listen the globalist
[14:54.200 --> 14:58.600]  are capable of staging a big terror attack bringing in martial law they're capable of
[14:58.600 --> 15:04.440]  launching a big war they didn't get into power because they weren't willing to do desperate
[15:04.440 --> 15:10.560]  things and weren't bold so they could release a bio weapon and pose as saviors and use the
[15:10.560 --> 15:17.560]  martial law clamp down all the stuff they've put in place is so they can clamp down if
[15:17.560 --> 15:21.240]  we ever start defeating them as the big New Brzezinski has said as Hillary Clinton has
[15:21.240 --> 15:30.600]  said they're losing the info war and what are they going to do as we kamikaze into them
[15:30.600 --> 15:36.960]  politically like an x-wing going into the main deck of the executor star destroyer total
[15:36.960 --> 15:47.640]  nerd analogy total nerd allegory and and that's the secret fortune favors the bold our fortune
[15:47.640 --> 15:53.880]  is not eating GMO our fortune is having national sovereignty our fortune is in is energizing
[15:53.880 --> 16:00.080]  families and men and women and children to have success but that's the fortune we seek
[16:00.080 --> 16:05.640]  not dumb the whole world down and cut off resources so you you genesis can play god
[16:05.640 --> 16:09.320]  by the way it's in mainstream news and I'm gonna get into all the other big big news
[16:09.320 --> 16:15.320]  on the IRS targeting tea parties this could be bigger than Benghazi Benghazi continuing
[16:15.320 --> 16:22.440]  to melt down I mean this is a real this is what a coup d'etat or a counter coup in the
[16:22.440 --> 16:29.040]  establishment looks like against Obama and again it's not because the establishment
[16:29.040 --> 16:34.160]  wants to give us a victory this is happening it's because they know that they've committed
[16:34.160 --> 16:39.800]  and accelerated their program too fast and even sectors of the establishment are scared
[16:39.800 --> 16:46.000]  of Obama and the hardcore technocrats because the hardcore technocrats hate humanity so
[16:46.000 --> 16:53.080]  much and are such psychopathic control freaks that large sectors of the establishment realize
[16:53.080 --> 16:59.640]  oh my god this isn't business as usual keeping the masses down and centralizing control this
[16:59.640 --> 17:05.000]  really is a crazy eugenics plan to bring in world government and exterminate 80 plus
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.640]  percent of the population and they also see how France and other European countries are
[17:10.640 --> 17:14.800]  about ten years ahead of the United States and England in the globalist takeover and
[17:14.800 --> 17:20.480]  they see how even billionaires are being arrested and having their stolen wealth stolen by other
[17:20.480 --> 17:25.240]  globalist and so they're figuring out oh my gosh when we get rid of checks and balances
[17:25.240 --> 17:31.200]  oh my gosh when we get rid of any type of due process we're gonna be the first people
[17:31.200 --> 17:40.000]  up on the chomping block you could have two globalists left on earth in a palace a technotronic
[17:40.000 --> 17:46.440]  technocratic palace and they would try to kill each other it is the nature of these
[17:46.440 --> 17:53.200]  people and so there is a worldwide battle for the heart and soul of humanity going on
[17:53.200 --> 18:00.880]  it's happening all over the planet it's happening in communist China it's happening in authoritarian
[18:00.880 --> 18:05.760]  Israel it's happening in authoritarian Saudi Arabia it's happening in authoritarian England
[18:05.760 --> 18:11.720]  it's happening in authoritarian United States of America and you are the resistance oh by

[24:26.480 --> 24:32.480]  media alternately says it doesn't exist or you're you're insane if you protest it that
[24:32.480 --> 24:37.360]  it does exist but that world elites should be able to meet the secret with your elected
[24:37.360 --> 24:44.880]  politicians who will then sign over your assets to them but here's the headline Google

[25:38.720 --> 25:44.240]  carve up the world I mean they had meetings in turkey we got some of the minutes of about
[25:44.240 --> 25:48.000]  how they were going to shut down power plants all over the United States five years ago
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.600]  and they did it and they had the big global power company heads there literally deciding
[25:53.600 --> 25:58.120]  what companies weren't part of the inside group to be shut down all the insiders were
[25:58.120 --> 26:03.840]  given waivers people outside the insiders had their plants shut down and you got higher
[26:03.840 --> 26:11.760]  power prices oh see how money's made it's made by shutting down your competition that's
[26:11.760 --> 26:16.760]  what Bilderberg's about oh but they're all secret and undoubtedly the British cops will
[26:16.760 --> 26:24.120]  be bugging their eyes out at us how dare you try to come here and cover this criminal meeting
[26:24.120 --> 26:28.360]  and I'll go hey cops you notice your money doesn't go as far hope you enjoy having your
[26:28.360 --> 26:33.280]  pension funds taken and I'll pull up on an iPad articles about British civil servant

[26:42.720 --> 26:47.520]  yes you're absolutely right they're criminals you will figure it out and it's better to
[26:47.520 --> 26:54.720]  figure it out now before they fully robbed all of us instead of late later now speaking
[26:54.720 --> 26:59.680]  of that I have told you we've not tooted our horn yet we ought to dig the articles up
[26:59.680 --> 27:05.160]  I have told you for over a decade this doesn't matter when Republicans are in office is the
[27:05.160 --> 27:12.600]  bureaucracy is a bunch of collectivist most people in government as you know are communist
[27:12.600 --> 27:16.680]  or socialist they don't understand they work for big mega offshore banks they just know
[27:16.680 --> 27:21.440]  they get their chicken feet and I have known pastors that have been audited because they
[27:21.440 --> 27:28.000]  criticize any type of socialism or abortion I have known authors that have been audited
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.920]  and told you should I mean I text Mars back when he was you know kind of like a mainline
[27:33.920 --> 27:38.200]  Republican I was writing articles and about Hillary Clinton and bestselling books like
[27:38.200 --> 27:44.000]  big sis is watching and they came and audited him and shut him down basically and said hey
[27:44.000 --> 27:51.080]  you shouldn't talk bad about Clinton this is back in the late 1990s and so many people
[27:51.080 --> 27:56.040]  say hey I don't want to mess with the government I'll get audited when you act like that it's
[27:56.040 --> 28:02.880]  over folks when you act like that you have no future when you get start start controlling
[28:02.880 --> 28:07.200]  what you say because the government might come after you everyone then shuts up and
[28:07.200 --> 28:13.120]  goes along and then you get a tyranny freedom is when you stand up against these people
[28:13.120 --> 28:17.640]  and the illegitimate collection agency for the private Federal Reserve we didn't even
[28:17.640 --> 28:23.640]  have an income tax till 1913 most Americans weren't even eligible to pay it till the 1950s
[28:23.640 --> 28:28.200]  they didn't build the nation it destroyed the nation now now now let's go to these articles
[28:28.200 --> 28:34.960]  because this people are saying hey this could be a distraction from Benghazi gate and that's
[28:34.960 --> 28:40.480]  not what's happening Benghazi gates out there bigger than ever this is because everybody

[35:24.640 --> 35:30.600]  to make stuff up and because they've written the tax laws where they can say whatever they
[35:30.600 --> 35:36.680]  want you know if you're a big globalist you pay zero taxes but if you try to actually
[35:36.680 --> 35:44.280]  hire people and build a news organization well they rake you over the coals and it just goes
[35:44.280 --> 35:51.960]  on to admit this is the Washington Post going oh yeah I guess if you talk about the Constitution
[35:51.960 --> 35:59.320]  the IRS comes after you gee that sounds like a free country doesn't it yeah folks they teach
[35:59.320 --> 36:06.400]  the police that Christians are terrorist and that they've got to quote prepare to confiscate
[36:06.400 --> 36:12.040]  their guns that made the state police a month ago flip out and go public in Colorado see
[36:12.040 --> 36:16.640]  they went too far imagine FEMA meetings and the Christians we may have to confiscate their
[36:16.640 --> 36:25.320]  guns and mass and the state police were in the local news saying is this a joke are you
[36:25.320 --> 36:31.840]  joking with us no no no no no no no no state police all over the country you've been federalized
[36:31.840 --> 36:38.560]  and you've signed on now to go after people that are real Americans so you're either going
[36:38.560 --> 36:44.400]  to follow your orders and be on the wrong side of history or you're going to do something
[36:44.400 --> 36:53.240]  about it and that just means say no blow the whistle speak out remember they had all those
[36:53.240 --> 36:56.760]  sheriffs in Colorado they're really trying to use Colorado as a test bed and they said
[36:56.760 --> 37:01.120]  oh we're not going to enforce the state law and so they introduced a bill that said well
[37:01.120 --> 37:05.720]  we'll have the secret service come in and enforce this and go after sheriffs and then
[37:05.720 --> 37:10.440]  everybody got upset about that so they ran headlines saying conspiracy theorist say the
[37:10.440 --> 37:15.320]  secret service will go after sheriffs you mean the bill they're trying to pass in the
[37:15.320 --> 37:24.200]  Colorado State House sponsored and pushed by the Justice Department we got foreign governments
[37:24.200 --> 37:29.320]  foreign corporations and the federal government that's a foreign corporation basically now
[37:29.320 --> 37:34.800]  an occupied group try and they've got bills introduced in Texas to guarantee 90% occupancy
[37:34.800 --> 37:42.680]  and private presence it's a business and this could bring them down ladies and gentlemen
[37:42.680 --> 37:48.840]  but again I saw an article going Obama doesn't care if there's controversy he doesn't care
[37:48.840 --> 37:54.640]  that's them trying to act you know tough with bravada there's the Fox News headline Colorado
[37:54.640 --> 37:59.400]  sheriffs plan lawsuit challenging state gun control laws oh really will the secret service
[37:59.400 --> 38:10.320]  where black sunglasses and suits aren't you scared of 007 sheriffs it's all a facade of
[38:10.320 --> 38:14.000]  crooks they've committed so many crimes in the federal government ladies and gentlemen
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.120]  that's why they're so dangerous because they're going to go for it all because they either
[38:17.120 --> 38:23.200]  all go to prison or they take over you understand this is committed this is this is like when
[38:23.200 --> 38:26.600]  you get in a fight in a parking lot or something you're not looking for it but the guys looking
[38:26.600 --> 38:33.120]  for it he punches you upside the head you're in a fight folks okay and get in a fetal position
[38:33.120 --> 38:37.320]  and sticking your thumb in your mouth and the other thumb somewhere else is not I guess
[38:37.320 --> 38:43.600]  that could be the new national sign actually one thumb here and the other I mean look that
[38:43.600 --> 38:48.520]  is not going to deliver you to Valhalla so I'm going to cover this more in the next hour
[38:48.520 --> 38:54.480]  with Catherine Aldrich Obamacare taxpayers must report personal health info to IRS oh
[38:54.480 --> 38:59.840]  now remember they denied death panels they denied IRS it's all in the bill now they're
[38:59.840 --> 39:03.520]  saying yeah we're going to pass your health care health records around whoever wants them
[39:03.520 --> 39:10.000]  and it turns out in the campaign tax info was illegally used against candidates especially
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.720]  tea party libertarians all over America gee the White House run media matters who isn't
[39:15.720 --> 39:20.200]  pertinent and doesn't have an audience but it's important because it is admittedly written
[39:20.200 --> 39:25.640]  by the White House that's White House talking points they say let's break in to alternative
[39:25.640 --> 39:32.560]  media and destroy it they think you're so dumb they publicly parade around talking about
[39:32.560 --> 39:39.560]  espionage they're listening to me right now they publicly engage in espionage against
[39:39.560 --> 39:45.440]  the free press of this republic they're in the Washington Post going yeah we target
[39:45.440 --> 39:52.960]  people that talk about the Constitution the Constitution is America the Constitution is
[39:52.960 --> 39:59.160]  the Republic the Constitution binds down the government declaration of independence demonized
[39:59.160 --> 40:05.760]  by FEMA Bill of Rights Constitution all of it these people are the enemy ladies and gentlemen
[40:05.760 --> 40:11.880]  do they need to wear foreign uniforms before you figure that out it's not rhetoric when
[40:11.880 --> 40:16.000]  I say they're spying on you it's not rhetoric when I say they're persecuting people it's
[40:16.000 --> 40:25.880]  not rhetoric the best place to get the coverage on IRS gate on enemies list gate is drudgereport.com
[40:25.880 --> 40:33.320]  let's punch it up a new enemies list that's the top headline IRS begins targeting conservatives
[40:33.320 --> 40:39.960]  in March of 010 that's what the inspector general says try 30 years ago probe expands
[40:39.960 --> 40:47.680]  the groups opposed to government teaching constitution yeah yeah don't have groups teaching that
[40:47.680 --> 40:54.400]  security scrutiny deeper than thought kept shifting targets agency accused of leaking
[40:54.400 --> 41:01.560]  confidential tax documents during election you could they did it publicly flashback Romney
[41:01.560 --> 41:10.640]  donor vilified by Obama campaign then subjected to two audits and then they've got Democrats
[41:10.640 --> 41:14.960]  bragging and defending it saying it's a good idea and statements they've made about how
[41:14.960 --> 41:18.800]  they need to use the IRS on it hell I just remembered saying that we're going to Paul
[41:18.800 --> 41:26.680]  Watson with the biggest report ever I just remembered they have talked about on MSNBC
[41:26.680 --> 41:33.680]  when I've seen them using the IRS against Tea Party groups and how it's wrong that their
[41:33.680 --> 41:43.320]  tax exempt and promoting their political view about the Constitution you punks I mean look
[41:43.320 --> 41:47.720]  it's like Fast and Furious they bragged about Fast and Furious two years before it broke
[41:47.720 --> 41:53.160]  and then said they never had the press conferences where they all admitted to the program that's
[41:53.160 --> 42:02.800]  how dumb they think you are
[42:02.800 --> 42:09.920]  ladies and gentlemen the the administration is going down unless they stage a terror attack
[42:09.920 --> 42:15.000]  Rand Paul declares Obama is working with anti-American globalist basically overthrow America yes
[42:15.000 --> 42:23.120]  yes yes yes yes that is what is going to beat them the truth their attack is so outrageous
[42:23.120 --> 42:30.280]  so over the top when Catherine Albert about 15 after let her know even Watson till then
[42:30.280 --> 42:35.040]  their attack is so naked so brazen so out in the open that people don't respond to it properly
[42:35.040 --> 42:39.120]  because it's it's hard to believe it's happening and they're like oh he's discredited no he's
[42:39.120 --> 42:43.600]  not discredited his star politically is shooting up like a rocket because he's telling it like
[42:43.600 --> 42:48.640]  it is same thing Ted Cruz and they go oh Ted Cruz is discrediting conservatives and libertarians
[42:48.640 --> 42:53.720]  no he's not he's energizing them whatever they tell you is discrediting that's what you've
[42:53.720 --> 42:59.560]  got to go with oh don't be associated with Alex Jones that guy's discredited oh yeah
[42:59.560 --> 43:07.720]  I'm real discredited there's also an article on drudgereport.com about a giant drill they're
[43:07.720 --> 43:13.040]  doing at an amusement park FEMA for martial law and there's another article drudge was
[43:13.040 --> 43:19.320]  linked to from mfallwars.com dealing with more drills training where tea partiers and parents
[43:19.320 --> 43:25.760]  and homeschoolers are going to attack public schools how do you demonize a group well you
[43:25.760 --> 43:34.360]  just go train the police they're bad so that's all coming up we're going to look at how they
[43:34.360 --> 43:40.480]  use your data and and why is Google at the heart of Bilderberg the shadow corporate illegal
[43:40.480 --> 43:46.760]  crony capitalist anti-free market group why are they at the heart of it I'll tell you
[43:46.760 --> 43:52.800]  why they're at the heart of it because they are the unofficial NSA where they're getting
[43:52.800 --> 44:04.260]  people to opt in to waving their rights and being spied on but even when you have the
[44:04.260 --> 44:09.240]  privacy settings and tell Google no it's on record hacking into everybody's computer
[44:09.240 --> 44:14.800]  and stealing all your data photos passwords mobile cars driving around their NSA vehicles
[44:14.800 --> 44:21.360]  really globalist private corporate NSA fraudulent felony every millisecond committing systems
[44:21.360 --> 44:28.320]  worldwide on record driving around with backdoors built into Apple built into Microsoft built
[44:28.320 --> 44:37.360]  into everything but some of the other systems like Linux and they're going around jacking
[44:37.360 --> 44:43.320]  and stealing everything and then they don't get in trouble for it but see oh it's don't
[44:43.320 --> 44:49.160]  be evil a cute little Google and Google has you know hippies working there and and metrosexual
[44:49.160 --> 44:54.340]  trendies and and and they've got ping pong and they've got foosball and they've got video
[44:54.340 --> 44:59.600]  games and they're always looking at movies coming out with comedians about how Google's
[44:59.600 --> 45:08.800]  friendly and they drink beer and have fun and oh they're sweetie pies all to be non-threatening
[45:08.800 --> 45:13.400]  that's their uniform while they're really the technocrats able to predict what mass movements
[45:13.400 --> 45:19.680]  are going to do and that's why now punching it up on screen for TV viewers every radio
[45:19.680 --> 45:24.400]  listener has got to go to info wars.com and get this article out to everyone they know
[45:24.400 --> 45:30.760]  is when we get news this big we don't ever tend to really hype it up like we should and
[45:30.760 --> 45:36.080]  if you don't hype something up nobody pays attention to it this is big our sources for
[45:36.080 --> 45:39.880]  years and we've gone to Switzerland and confirmed it and some of it's come out at Davos it's
[45:39.880 --> 45:46.520]  come out in the news that Google was more and more of being absorbing Bilderberg and
[45:46.520 --> 45:53.080]  that the old Robert Baron technocrats David Rockefeller the Big New Brzezinski the CFR
[45:53.080 --> 46:02.120]  passing things on to the technocrats and people like Eric Schmidt and if you go to info wars.com
[46:02.120 --> 46:07.280]  we have photos we have video from there at the Grove Resort and hotel where they ran
[46:07.280 --> 46:12.480]  major OSS operations in World War two you name it we're Bilderberg four years ago three
[46:12.480 --> 46:18.680]  years ago every year plans Arab Springs and revolutions they need people power so they
[46:18.680 --> 46:24.960]  are creating the system to track control surveil you and know your dreams to them see trends
[46:24.960 --> 46:30.640]  and pre-program you all packages if it's non-threatening and trendy because look Warren Buffett's
[46:30.640 --> 46:35.920]  got an ice cream cone and look Google's drinking beer and they've got guys with metrosexual
[46:35.920 --> 46:40.720]  you know rainbow socks on so but being behind closed doors folks they're they're globalist
[46:40.720 --> 46:48.200]  operatives saluting in military formation that's our intel from inside Microsoft from
[46:48.200 --> 46:53.120]  inside Google inside all of it these are military operations I mean I know people that have
[46:53.120 --> 46:59.320]  been in the meetings there are top generals in their cybersecurity all of it this is unbelievable
[46:59.320 --> 47:04.040]  and I told Watson three weeks ago I said you've got to get there because they're already setting
[47:04.040 --> 47:09.200]  up and he was visiting family in France for a couple weeks working from France and then
[47:09.200 --> 47:14.280]  he got back and he finally got there and it was the mother load of the employees managers
[47:14.280 --> 47:18.640]  because they it's all hiding in plain view the public is in such a trance they don't
[47:18.640 --> 47:23.280]  see guard shacks being set up and checkpoints and they're just like oh yes we stage the
[47:23.280 --> 47:27.960]  Arab Spring here we're bringing in global government we have recordings of this oh
[47:27.960 --> 47:33.120]  yes Google runs Bilderberg and we're so important the mayor's in the news going oh I'm so glad
[47:33.120 --> 47:39.400]  Bilderberg's coming here we're so prestigious oh protesters are so evil Paul Watson this
[47:39.400 --> 47:44.120]  segment next segment for 15 minutes the next hour you've got the floor as we expose this
[47:44.120 --> 47:48.560]  I know you've got part two tomorrow but we've got the agenda everything and this is confirming
[47:48.560 --> 47:53.080]  what our sources told us really three years ago two years ago a year ago and three weeks
[47:53.080 --> 47:57.960]  ago and I'm so glad you got over there to report on this in the photos and video or
[47:57.960 --> 48:03.520]  up on info wars.com I know I'm ranting here but I mean look at look at look at the IRS
[48:03.520 --> 48:09.520]  with our health records now and spying on people and imagine Google makes them you know look
[48:09.520 --> 48:17.400]  like look like babies look like amoebas compared to a t-rex in the damage they can do Paul
[48:17.400 --> 48:18.400]  Watson.
[48:18.400 --> 48:25.480]  Well that's right Alex I mean Google really is setting itself up as you know the B system
[48:25.480 --> 48:31.480]  and we went to the Grove Hotel in Hertfordshire on Friday expecting to dig up some dirt about
[48:31.480 --> 48:36.680]  Bilderberg we actually ended up uncovering an even bigger story which is the fact as
[48:36.680 --> 48:43.360]  he said Bilderberg along with other high profile networks are being merged into Google and
[48:43.360 --> 48:49.200]  in fact we discovered that the Google Zeitgeist conference which has been described by the
[48:49.200 --> 48:56.520]  London Independent as a cuddlier version of the Bilderberg group is taking place in about
[48:56.520 --> 49:03.400]  a week's time I think it begins at the same location as Bilderberg does just 10 days after
[49:03.400 --> 49:07.920]  it and again there's that meme there's that meme it's cuddly they're breaking into your
[49:07.920 --> 49:13.640]  computers it's run by by the Pentagon and Northcom and foreign governments we've got
[49:13.640 --> 49:17.000]  your medical records we're going to use them we're going to steal your bank accounts too
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.000]  we want to know where all your money's at NSA admits they're spying on us without warrants
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.240]  through Google but it's it's cuddly Paul.
[49:26.240 --> 49:32.680]  Well here's the fact I mean Schmidt was obviously a major donor to Obama's political campaigns
[49:32.680 --> 49:37.360]  they actually offered him the position of Treasury Secretary turned it down he was a
[49:37.360 --> 49:43.600]  major advisor to Obama's political campaign and in Britain Google representatives have
[49:43.600 --> 49:52.400]  met with the current conservative government 23 times since 2010 so both in America and
[49:52.400 --> 49:58.640]  in Britain the Google government relationship is cosier than ever and in fact David Cameron
[49:58.640 --> 50:02.920]  four years before he became Prime Minister addressed the Google Zeitgeist conference
[50:02.920 --> 50:10.640]  in 2006 Chancellor George Osborne visited and gave a speech at Google Zeitgeist in 2011
[50:10.640 --> 50:16.480]  two weeks later he was in Switzerland at the Bilderberg conference in San Marit so the crossover
[50:16.480 --> 50:22.640]  is clear Bill Clinton a major Google Zeitgeist speaker of course he was at the 91 Bilderberg
[50:22.640 --> 50:28.120]  meeting they groomed him before he became president and just it goes on and on Prince
[50:28.120 --> 50:34.200]  Charles the memberships at the top are basically the same so this is why we say Bilderberg is
[50:34.200 --> 50:40.120]  being merged into Google that's why we coined the term Googleberg and it's it's all part
[50:40.120 --> 50:45.640]  of this technocratic revolution that Eric Schmidt brags about at these Google Zeitgeist
[50:45.640 --> 50:50.080]  conference and they also bragged that they're going to have web IDs and taxes selectively
[50:50.080 --> 50:55.800]  enforced to shut down their competition and ban people off the web that are troublemakers
[50:55.800 --> 51:01.120]  and Paul again our sources and we confirmed this in Switzerland because from this last
[51:01.120 --> 51:07.080]  year more and more the old attendees are dying or leaving and it is Google it is Facebook
[51:07.080 --> 51:12.840]  it is Apple and now from our sources they said go there there basically it's a mega
[51:12.840 --> 51:17.640]  Bilderberg meeting meetings before during and after and they're passing the torch to
[51:17.640 --> 51:24.840]  Google this is this is a big deal and now you were able to confirm from our source what's
[51:24.840 --> 51:30.040]  on the agenda and we also indexed that with some WikiLeaks information I mean this is
[51:30.040 --> 51:37.040]  big well exactly we've got the agenda and we've also got reports like the one out of
[51:37.040 --> 51:41.760]  the London Telegraph which described Google Zeitgeist as quote one of the most high powered
[51:41.760 --> 51:45.360]  gatherings of business leaders thinkers and those that are considered to generally shape
[51:45.360 --> 51:50.920]  the global future another report compared it to the Davos Economic Forum which just happened
[51:50.920 --> 51:56.960]  in January so this is a major major conference it's almost exactly the same as Bilderberg
[51:56.960 --> 52:03.120]  it's close to the public the hotel has to organize with state security to protect the
[52:03.120 --> 52:07.960]  function the public can't allow it anywhere near it and yet hardly anybody knows about
[52:07.960 --> 52:13.240]  it people have started to lift the veil from Bilderberg which is probably why they're trying
[52:13.240 --> 52:19.840]  to merge it into these as you said you know trendy metrosexual groups I called it the
[52:19.840 --> 52:26.360]  rebranding of authoritarian anti-democratic power networks into trendy philanthropic
[52:26.360 --> 52:31.680]  style forums because that's exactly what it is if you go and watch the Google Zeitgeist
[52:31.680 --> 52:36.480]  speeches there's a YouTube channel where they release what they want to put out there it's
[52:36.480 --> 52:43.480]  basically Eric Schmidt saying look we know people are constantly glued to their smartphones
[52:43.480 --> 52:47.480]  but that's not enough I mean even though all the studies show it's making people desperately
[52:47.480 --> 52:53.280]  unhappy it's literally rewiring their brains he says that's not enough and he wants a complete
[52:53.280 --> 52:58.120]  transhumanist future where forget Google Glass there's going to be a Google chip implanted
[52:58.120 --> 53:02.680]  in your brain he wants cars that drive themselves obviously tracking your every movement
[53:02.680 --> 53:08.320]  oh yeah this gives them total control and tell folks the photos you and others took
[53:08.320 --> 53:13.080]  I've got them on screen for TV viewers of the transhumanist dead body being taken over
[53:13.080 --> 53:17.600]  by the robot and the message of the sculpture is that the old human is dead and then the
[53:17.600 --> 53:23.000]  machine rewires as it kills humanity this is the technocratic plan and this is where
[53:23.000 --> 53:28.360]  they like to meet I mean this is unbelievable all the videos and photos you've got in your
[53:28.360 --> 53:37.200]  report at mfallwars.com well it's the hotel is surrounded by vast sprawling estate 300
[53:37.200 --> 53:44.640]  acres and 18 whole golf course and these beautiful gardens but they're full of these weird statues
[53:44.640 --> 53:50.520]  as you mentioned one is a half human half skeleton crawling out of a pond there are
[53:50.520 --> 53:56.640]  other kind of transhumanist statues in that garden and just the whole place is very strange
[53:56.640 --> 54:02.600]  to say the least it's extremely ornate and beautiful inside we managed to get a look
[54:02.600 --> 54:06.880]  at some of the conference rooms actually in the major conference room in the hotel you
[54:06.880 --> 54:10.760]  could see they were rigging up something in the roof they were obviously setting it up
[54:10.760 --> 54:16.520]  for a major conference which is probably the Google zeitgeist but one of the hotel managers
[54:16.520 --> 54:22.560]  actually told us that they've got four or five major conferences coming up in May June
[54:22.560 --> 54:27.200]  and July one's Google one's Bilderberg we don't know what the others are but this seems to
[54:27.200 --> 54:33.840]  be a central hub for the elite's agenda in Britain it's literally about a 15 minute drive
[54:33.840 --> 54:39.520]  from Heathrow airport so the word we got is that is that look at this it's bigger than
[54:39.520 --> 54:45.320]  Bilderberg there's a merger and that they're basically permanently moving into that area
[54:45.320 --> 54:53.040]  because it's surrounded by the old OSS MI6 command bases in the area basically that entire
[54:53.040 --> 54:59.840]  area is has been a globalist command base all along yeah in fact on their own website
[54:59.840 --> 55:06.880]  they brag about how people have been eating and mating there for 9000 years so it's obviously
[55:06.880 --> 55:14.040]  a very sacred place for them and it's it's a routine horn of celebrities and global elitist
[55:14.040 --> 55:20.480]  in fact it's it's renowned as a place where celebrities and politicians go to not be bothered
[55:20.480 --> 55:26.120]  in fact when we went there the entire Manchester City football team was staying the night before
[55:26.120 --> 55:33.080]  the FA Cup final which is Britain's version of the Super Bowl for soccer so rich very rich
[55:33.080 --> 55:38.040]  people I mean the presidential suite is 1000 pounds a night that's you know 1700 dollars
[55:38.040 --> 55:44.400]  a night it's a major sprawling complex it's completely different to Chantilly or Sam Moritz
[55:44.400 --> 55:50.880]  which were relatively small in comparison and the access is basically terrible in terms
[55:50.880 --> 55:57.040]  of a protester from the viewpoint of a protester because there's two long driveways on both
[55:57.040 --> 56:03.200]  the front and back entrances and it's very difficult to not only get near the hotel but
[56:03.200 --> 56:08.160]  there are few areas to stand around it as they there was in Sam Moritz there was a huge
[56:08.160 --> 56:12.720]  embankment which you could get 300 protesters on looks like we're just going to have to
[56:12.720 --> 56:17.840]  stand along the side of the road it's not going to be great in terms of congregation
[56:17.840 --> 56:23.760]  but that's why they've chosen this venue because of its remoteness and because of the the terrible
[56:23.760 --> 56:27.840]  access for anybody who tries to get near it to protest now now Paul that's the difference
[56:27.840 --> 56:32.000]  between half empty half full I agree with you but that actually makes it better because
[56:32.000 --> 56:37.200]  you've only got two entrances the back entrance is the shorter one we'll be able to station
[56:37.200 --> 56:44.280]  reporters on both ends of that and then that makes it harder for them to get past us without
[56:44.280 --> 56:49.800]  us getting video we've also got to get the red filters for all the cameras folks so you
[56:49.800 --> 56:54.560]  can shoot through the tent or your cameras won't won't catch them but if you put a red
[56:54.560 --> 56:59.600]  filter over your camera you will have them just a little tip to all the demonstrators
[56:59.600 --> 57:06.720]  and people and I've never seen such pre-demonization by the mayor this woman saying yeah there's
[57:06.720 --> 57:14.320]  a royal with the lucky to have them coming here but the rabble undoubtedly will be violent scum
[57:14.320 --> 57:18.240]  protesters I mean I can't believe she's in the plus I thought Bilderberg didn't exist
[57:18.240 --> 57:23.040]  usually they just say that there's insane people imagining the helicopters landing
[57:23.040 --> 57:30.160]  in the troops this insane schizophrenics have come to town but instead she's like a rabble
[57:30.160 --> 57:37.360]  I'm so glad to thank God we're elite enough to have them though I'm so honored I'm sorry
[57:37.360 --> 57:44.520]  Paul I'm shifting into my Englishness for a moment well I mean she's come out and basically
[57:44.520 --> 57:50.020]  demonized the protesters as being violent there's never been a violent incident at a
[57:50.020 --> 57:53.960]  Bilderberg protest there was some weird thing in Switzerland where they tried to frame up
[57:53.960 --> 57:58.040]  some people for a bomb threat which turned out to be nonsense that was stage that was
[57:58.040 --> 58:01.480]  stage by their people yeah that was an excuse to move everybody back and they'll do that
[58:01.480 --> 58:06.080]  here too it's for your safety get back now mate I'll have to arrest you have you deported

[58:53.840 --> 58:58.400]  into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research
[58:58.400 --> 59:03.240]  led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[59:03.240 --> 59:08.120]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[59:08.120 --> 59:13.760]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves
[59:13.760 --> 59:19.560]  fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out

[1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:53.600]  listeners bill berg group is one of the top globalist crime syndicate meeting places where
[1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:58.920]  they buy and sell our politicians in violation of federal law the grove hotel set to host
[1:00:58.920 --> 1:01:04.440]  bill berg outside london one of the most elite hotels in the world watson went stayed there
[1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:10.440]  friday night and she talks about how i'm worried about violence these protesters are always
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:17.160]  violent she goes i'm i feel lucky that we're elitist enough to have them i'm concerned
[1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:22.120]  about the use of police resources but it's good the grove has been deemed a prestigious
[1:01:22.120 --> 1:01:28.840]  enough venue oh so we so they've gone from bill berg not existing to this prestigious enough
[1:01:28.840 --> 1:01:35.400]  perhaps i can chew on the on the uh on the skin growths of david rockefeller's big toe
[1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:42.600]  the mayor probably wants to suck on david rockefeller's toes i'm sorry folks a little humor
[1:01:43.160 --> 1:01:48.360]  i'm sorry let's go back to paul watson paul i cannot say how big this is i mean we've got
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:53.480]  their agenda early our sources have been confirmed it's a giant google nest you said you saw them
[1:01:53.480 --> 1:01:58.840]  uh you know shedding up garden nest and uh they talked a lot to you the first day you got a lot
[1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:03.480]  of intel then they obviously had under surveillance and freaked out the next day uh you've got a lot
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:09.800]  of this recorded too if anybody doubts it well yeah isn't it ironic that the whatford mayor is
[1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:16.040]  talking about violence when the president of the supreme court of italy and the guy who investigated
[1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:21.320]  the assassination attempt on the pope came out a few weeks ago and said the builder group
[1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:27.240]  is involved in terrorist attacks in gladio i've got the evidence whatford observers not talking
[1:02:27.240 --> 1:02:33.000]  about that are they they're talking about non-existent violence from peaceful protest shut your mouth
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:42.760]  rabble you will kneel to the queen now and groom the stool why don't you beg to groom the queen

[1:02:53.800 --> 1:03:01.240]  i'm sorry go ahead um the the other thing obviously is when we talk to this hotel manager
[1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:08.840]  he bragged about the fact that google recruited and met and planned with these same people who
[1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:14.600]  worked for google one of them was called weyell go nim who started the phony contrived color
[1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:20.920]  revolutions the arab spring in tunisia and egypt so this is the central hub where they plan all
[1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:26.680]  their social media manipulations and these phony revolutions around the globe and they're quite
[1:03:26.680 --> 1:03:31.880]  happy to brag about it apparently well let's not forget too i got thrown a day early out of the
[1:03:31.880 --> 1:03:38.600]  bill de berg hotel in virginia last year and uh it doesn't matter though because we've got so many
[1:03:38.600 --> 1:03:44.760]  great auxiliar reporters that uh that you've been working with for years there uh that uh they're
[1:03:44.760 --> 1:03:48.760]  not going to stop us getting the information out and again if they try to block me coming into
[1:03:48.760 --> 1:03:52.440]  england it only makes it a bigger story i actually hope i get to come see you hang out see all the

[1:03:56.600 --> 1:04:03.240]  events to it uh but uh you know we win either way the only way we lose paul is by not engaging these
[1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:10.600]  people well exactly which is why we need uh as many people out there as possible but we've also
[1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:16.280]  got some of the leap to gender that they're going to be talking about uh which focuses mainly on
[1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:22.760]  iran and syria obviously they're talking about airstrikes on iran's nuclear facilities within
[1:04:22.760 --> 1:04:28.760]  three years if terran doesn't give up its nuclear program they're also obviously talking about
[1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:32.040]  arming the syrian they want to stay there come back i'm gonna give you the floor for five minutes

[1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:47.400]  and tying it all into the irs enemies listgate where the washington post is being forced to
[1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:55.160]  report yes it's true inspector general report the irs was ordered to quote target people
[1:08:55.160 --> 1:09:02.840]  that promote the constitution that is the essence of treason to to attack the constitution
[1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:10.520]  is the lawful framework of government so if you promote the law you promote justice you're targeted
[1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:16.200]  it sounds like the devil if the devil was in control i want you to target people that support
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:24.680]  the rule of law and justice get them get them now drive them into submission this is the twilight
[1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:31.240]  zone level of garbage we deal with paul watson has broken i asked him three weeks ago to get
[1:09:31.240 --> 1:09:36.520]  down there he got down there this weekend our sources years ago we confirmed it in switzerland
[1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:40.600]  and saint mereds said look they've already merged with google it's going to be public soon they're
[1:09:40.600 --> 1:09:45.960]  going to transform themselves into this technocracy they're going to sell it as if it's trendy and
[1:09:45.960 --> 1:09:50.440]  they're just going to hide this new system in plain view they're going to tax the web control it
[1:09:51.640 --> 1:09:57.160]  this is the future we sent paul and another reporter in not going to name all the reporters
[1:09:57.160 --> 1:10:01.560]  because i don't want them getting uh you know identified and shut down we try to go back into
[1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:07.400]  the hotel and outside london we're probably the most expensive and elitist hotels in the world to
[1:10:07.400 --> 1:10:13.880]  grove they are having the google meetings before and after and daring bill deberg so it's totally
[1:10:14.680 --> 1:10:18.840]  transforming itself into googleberg and this is private corporate interest
[1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:23.560]  shedding the agenda and running our governments they're the ones that control the central banks
[1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:30.680]  they're the ones calling for a 100 trillion every decade in new taxes paid in carbon taxes to them
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:36.520]  they're the people trying to organize and run your life they're the ones that want to reduce
[1:10:36.520 --> 1:10:41.640]  population numbers we've got articles on that today paul watson tell us what we learned from our
[1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:48.200]  sources in the inside the grove but also outside confirming in just triplicate the intel we had
[1:10:48.200 --> 1:10:53.960]  and documents we have tell people what's in the report up at info wars dot com on googleberg
[1:10:53.960 --> 1:11:03.160]  and where all this is going well first off um the actual it's not that snobby inside the hotel the
[1:11:03.160 --> 1:11:08.040]  actual staff are really friendly so i'm guessing when bill deberg members are rude to them which
[1:11:08.040 --> 1:11:13.320]  they habitually are then they'll want to you know come back to us and maybe tell us about it but we
[1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:18.840]  got on well with all the staff they were really nice so it's not a snobby as you'd imagine but with
[1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:24.680]  regards to google and bill deberg there's two terms that they're throwing around right now which
[1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:30.280]  they'll be throwing around at the bill deberg conference one is cyber resilience which means
[1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:36.280]  cyber security which means more state control over the internet of course all the major cyber
[1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:41.160]  attacks have been launched by the us and israel and then used as a reason for cyber security
[1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:45.480]  legislation even though they're behind the attacks another one they're talking about is
[1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:52.360]  quote digital wildfires they're scared stiff about losing control over the flow of information
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:57.320]  and they're actually talking about setting up a ministry of truth for the internet which was
[1:11:57.320 --> 1:12:04.680]  the same thing advocated by bill clinton um bill deberg and google zeitgeist member back in 2011
[1:12:04.680 --> 1:12:09.800]  so they want an organization that vets what can be published on the internet as news
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:15.880]  as part of this agenda to stomp out the quote digital wildfire and by the way google delisted us
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:22.120]  from google news what four years ago so uh and they've been all sorts of stuff to try to delist
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:27.080]  us they're now trying to say that uh our sites can't be you know visited they're not safe when it
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:33.320]  turns out it's google software doing it i mean these people are simply amazing and they're they
[1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:40.200]  want to be the internet they want to decide that's their answer to the to the people's revolution
[1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:46.600]  of information is total control it is outrageous all of the press should be there and if the press
[1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:51.640]  isn't there or the press doesn't cover this then they're part of the problem i mean this is so
[1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:56.920]  outrageous to have these technocrats meeting with government trying to take over the web and dominate
[1:12:56.920 --> 1:13:03.480]  it and and google has committed so many crimes it's incredible paul yeah and then the media comes out
[1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:08.200]  and said oh it's just a talking shot well that's not correct because the former nato secretary
[1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:15.480]  general willy clays admitted in 2010 that bill deberg attendees discuss and come to a consensus
[1:13:15.480 --> 1:13:22.440]  and then they're told to implement those decisions in their relative spheres of influence so they
[1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:26.120]  go there they agree what they're going to do and then they implement it and he admitted that in
[1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:32.840]  2010 and he was a member also of course etienne davignon bragged about how the euro single currency
[1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:39.240]  was a brainchild of bill deberg in fact documents going back as far as 1955 confirmed that not only
[1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:45.960]  the eu but the single currency itself which wasn't even introduced until 92 was an idea
[1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:52.520]  formally introduced in banknotes and coins in 2002 they were talking about it in 1955 a year
[1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:57.320]  after they first met so don't tell me that they don't have power and influence and then they don't
[1:13:57.320 --> 1:14:04.120]  implement it because we've got numerous examples where they do and we've documented them you're
[1:14:04.120 --> 1:14:09.320]  absolutely right watson uh wow now as soon as you leave us here in a few minutes we're getting
[1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:16.120]  kathryn albert on but anything else uh you'd like to point out that's in this big report with videos
[1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:21.320]  photos uh this is a major investigative report you should probably just add a note at the top
[1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:26.360]  by the way this is culminate years of investigative researching and reporting as i don't people just
[1:14:26.360 --> 1:14:33.640]  think oh it's another article this is groundbreaking this is the technocratic group that wants to
[1:14:33.640 --> 1:14:40.200]  control and dominate our future horrible authoritarians trying to pose as non-threatening liberals
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:45.400]  when they're anything but uh and and and i know you've got more parts coming out in the next few
[1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:51.320]  days but it's time to really call on everybody worldwide to travel there to peacefully protest
[1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:56.280]  and to outnumber the provocateurs and to really by the way there's never been violence
[1:14:56.280 --> 1:15:00.120]  but if they if something happens you know it's staged the way this mayor is talking i mean this
[1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:07.080]  is really creepy well exactly and i mean there are several more videos to come we've got walk
[1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:12.440]  through the hotel we got more videos of the outside but with regard to the agenda and they're
[1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:17.800]  probably going to talk about the revolution of 3d printing and again ways to control it after the
[1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:22.840]  shutdown of defense distributor just a few days ago because they don't want that democratization
[1:15:22.840 --> 1:15:27.880]  of production they don't want people printing off their own weapons their own tools they're going to
[1:15:27.880 --> 1:15:34.760]  talk about the threat of a global pandemic caused in part by rising resistance to antibiotics
[1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:39.880]  but you know given the role of pharmaceutical corporations like Baxter and others which are
[1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:44.760]  represented at Bilderberg you're talking about a global pandemic then they're going to be the
[1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:50.520]  first suspects because they routinely accidentally release viruses in labs then try and send them
[1:15:50.520 --> 1:15:55.960]  out all over the world and it gets buried it gets hushed up so they're talking about global pandemic
[1:15:55.960 --> 1:16:00.280]  they're talking about bombing Iran's nuclear facilities within the next three years kiss
[1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:06.760]  injuries pushing for that and then you remember in 2011 before the fall of Gaddafi Bilderberg
[1:16:06.760 --> 1:16:11.400]  gave the final green light to go into Tripoli with the Al Qaeda terrorists they were supporting
[1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:16.680]  and getting that done it happened three months after Bilderberg 2011 so they're obviously going
[1:16:16.680 --> 1:16:21.960]  to talk about arming the Syrian rebels and trying to topple Bashar al-Assad in Syria
[1:16:21.960 --> 1:16:26.680]  because the Syrian military has been winning major battles in the past few weeks and it looks like
[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:32.920]  the tide is going against the FSA Obama backed terrorists so they're going to
[1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:38.040]  make of this headline this satellite telegraph under the black flag of al-Qaeda the Syrian
[1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:42.760]  city ruled by gangs of extremists and admits our government and others put al-Qaeda in charge
[1:16:43.800 --> 1:16:50.360]  and again it was Google helped fund and run the Arab Spring from this very hotel that they use as
[1:16:50.360 --> 1:16:55.160]  a command base Paul Watson we're going to get you back on tomorrow with part two of the report
[1:16:55.160 --> 1:17:00.440]  this is a groundbreaking report listeners please get it out to everyone let's bring in Catherine
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:03.640]  Albright Catherine we're going to break here in a few minutes it'll be with us for the rest of the
[1:17:03.640 --> 1:17:10.680]  hour this is breaking news our source gave us we went there we confirmed it got incredible intel
[1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:16.760]  because Google and Bilderberg used this as a substation now in Watford England confirming
[1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:23.320]  so much now on the heels of the IRS spying this really shows how these technocrats use
[1:17:23.960 --> 1:17:28.360]  their surveillance of us against the American people as a tool of tyranny I guess it's been
[1:17:28.360 --> 1:17:33.640]  said many times if you don't have your privacy there's no chance you can be a free person well
[1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:38.040]  and that's why I always say privacy is not an end it's a means and and the end is really
[1:17:38.040 --> 1:17:43.560]  freedom and they know that and for them taking away your privacy is is not an end notice how they
[1:17:43.560 --> 1:17:50.200]  get privacy and taxpayer paid for security as if we're terrorist but then we can't have any privacy
[1:17:50.200 --> 1:17:54.760]  yeah that's a good point isn't it so yeah but I think they recognize if they take away our privacy
[1:17:54.760 --> 1:17:58.760]  that they can also take away our freedom because that's really they go hand in hand I mean their
[1:17:58.760 --> 1:18:04.840]  what the privacy in and of itself isn't worth too much unless it leads to you having a a better
[1:18:04.840 --> 1:18:08.120]  life that's not under the thumb of somebody else which is why we all want to hang on to it
[1:18:09.720 --> 1:18:13.960]  well sure and they want to know what you think what you're into so they can tailor their propaganda
[1:18:15.320 --> 1:18:20.280]  absolutely that way you know it's a great example of that in spy chips our book we talked about how
[1:18:20.280 --> 1:18:25.720]  the the soft drink companies want to put actually was proctoring gamble wants to put a reader device
[1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:29.640]  in your fridge so they can tell when you drink the last coke so that they can run an ad on
[1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:35.320]  your television for Pepsi and once the cable TV you know they just send an ad going hey the person
[1:18:35.320 --> 1:18:39.160]  on you know with this account number needs to have an ad for Pepsi right now and then they
[1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:43.640]  can follow up and see how well the ad worked because they're and then that conditions you that
[1:18:43.640 --> 1:18:48.600]  it's all non-threatening as the former CI director said you're you know your refrigerator spying on
[1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:53.560]  you they're just mainlining it like it's cute and funny and that's what our inside sources have
[1:18:53.560 --> 1:18:59.560]  told us and then they actually do that in via PR confirming our sources they're like oh we're sweet
[1:18:59.560 --> 1:19:06.440]  though when we spy on you it's it's it's market research because and it it starts up with products
[1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:10.440]  and then it works its way into worldviews because what you do when as soon as you can figure out
[1:19:10.440 --> 1:19:14.040]  alright you're in the market for soda let me see if i can get you to switch to Pepsi let me try
[1:19:14.040 --> 1:19:18.440]  these five different ads oh that one worked okay so now i know in the future anybody with your
[1:19:18.440 --> 1:19:22.680]  demographics i'll run that ad look how effective that is and they can follow up and see if it worked
[1:19:22.680 --> 1:19:27.640]  and you can do the same thing with people's political views their worldviews the things they care about
[1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:32.040]  you you see gia a whole bunch of people are having this one particular view let's try feeding them
[1:19:32.040 --> 1:19:37.640]  a set of ads feeding them content on television feeding them a certain google results feeding them
[1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:42.760]  in in a particular way to mold their minds and then we can follow up and then they can slowly
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:47.800]  to the do they go to the websites now we want them to go to do they make the changes we want them to make
[1:19:48.760 --> 1:19:53.640]  okay absolutely we're gonna break down why google and stuff now only shows you what it

[1:24:03.820 --> 1:24:13.620]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:24:13.620 --> 1:24:15.660]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:24:15.660 --> 1:24:18.860]  I've realized why this radio show is successful.
[1:24:18.860 --> 1:24:20.260]  It's because I'm real.
[1:24:20.260 --> 1:24:22.020]  Despite all of my hyperventilating,
[1:24:22.020 --> 1:24:25.460]  all of my getting excited, people know it's real.
[1:24:25.460 --> 1:24:28.260]  And I think about Google and all the crimes they've committed,
[1:24:28.260 --> 1:24:29.180]  all the things they've done,
[1:24:29.180 --> 1:24:31.340]  all the dirty tricks they've played on me,
[1:24:31.340 --> 1:24:34.420]  over the years, and I don't mean all the Google employees,
[1:24:34.420 --> 1:24:35.620]  but the people at the very top of it.
[1:24:35.620 --> 1:24:36.980]  And then I know who they are.
[1:24:36.980 --> 1:24:38.140]  I know their plan.
[1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:39.700]  I've read the internet two meetings
[1:24:39.700 --> 1:24:41.420]  for like 15 years online.
[1:24:41.420 --> 1:24:42.540]  I've tracked them.
[1:24:42.540 --> 1:24:44.580]  I've interviewed all the experts.
[1:24:44.580 --> 1:24:46.780]  And then I hear Catherine Albrecht bringing stuff up
[1:24:46.780 --> 1:24:49.940]  and I start literally stuttering and jibbering
[1:24:49.940 --> 1:24:52.460]  because it's making me so mad.
[1:24:52.460 --> 1:24:54.380]  It'd be like if I went to my neighbor's house and went,
[1:24:54.380 --> 1:24:57.060]  hey, there's guys in your backyard,
[1:24:57.060 --> 1:24:58.900]  you know, Robin, you're shed,
[1:24:58.900 --> 1:25:01.140]  you know, stealing all your lawn equipment.
[1:25:01.140 --> 1:25:02.460]  And he said, well, how do you know that?
[1:25:02.460 --> 1:25:04.220]  Well, I mean, they got a truck, they're loading it up.
[1:25:04.220 --> 1:25:05.700]  Did you sell that to somebody?
[1:25:05.700 --> 1:25:08.380]  I know we're being robbed, okay?
[1:25:08.380 --> 1:25:12.380]  And I'm sitting here watching it year after year,
[1:25:12.380 --> 1:25:13.900]  decade after decade.
[1:25:14.980 --> 1:25:16.860]  And now they're talking about how they're gonna censor
[1:25:16.860 --> 1:25:18.100]  the web and control us.
[1:25:18.100 --> 1:25:21.660]  In the news, not just for my Bilderberg sources.
[1:25:21.660 --> 1:25:25.860]  And they're using all our data and they're surveilling us
[1:25:25.860 --> 1:25:30.500]  and they are tracking us and they're bad guys.
[1:25:30.500 --> 1:25:32.140]  People are like, well, what do I have to hide?
[1:25:32.140 --> 1:25:33.740]  Well, you don't want bad guys to know
[1:25:33.740 --> 1:25:35.820]  when you've left your house so they can rob you.
[1:25:35.820 --> 1:25:36.660]  It's the same thing.
[1:25:36.660 --> 1:25:38.220]  These are bad guys.
[1:25:39.100 --> 1:25:41.540]  This is short segment, long segment up, coming up.
[1:25:41.540 --> 1:25:45.100]  Catherine, how big is this tied into the IRS though?
[1:25:45.100 --> 1:25:47.700]  Because if people think the IRS targeting folks
[1:25:47.700 --> 1:25:49.980]  that quote, promote the Constitution,
[1:25:49.980 --> 1:25:51.820]  that's in the Washington Post today.
[1:25:51.820 --> 1:25:54.580]  See, that's a bad guy, that's a bad government
[1:25:54.580 --> 1:25:56.820]  because the Constitution binds them down.
[1:25:56.820 --> 1:25:59.940]  It's like WikiLeaks has the quote of Kissinger
[1:25:59.940 --> 1:26:02.860]  in a letter at Bilderberg saying,
[1:26:02.860 --> 1:26:04.260]  the illegal we do immediately,
[1:26:04.260 --> 1:26:06.100]  the unconstitutional takes longer.
[1:26:06.100 --> 1:26:08.380]  These are criminals.
[1:26:08.380 --> 1:26:11.260]  So of course they're saying, go after people
[1:26:11.260 --> 1:26:13.900]  that wanna bind us down with law.
[1:26:13.900 --> 1:26:17.260]  Catherine Albert, again, Harvard educated doctor
[1:26:17.260 --> 1:26:21.260]  of science and technology and policy joins us.
[1:26:21.260 --> 1:26:23.900]  How big is this IRS thing tied into this?
[1:26:23.900 --> 1:26:26.060]  Well, where are you gonna find the people?
[1:26:26.060 --> 1:26:28.540]  You know, this is really what it comes down to today
[1:26:28.540 --> 1:26:31.060]  because in three generations ago,
[1:26:31.060 --> 1:26:33.500]  even one generation ago, if you wanted to figure out
[1:26:33.500 --> 1:26:36.220]  who are all the groups who hold these particular views,
[1:26:36.220 --> 1:26:39.220]  then you would go to, I don't know, the IRS, the FBI,
[1:26:39.220 --> 1:26:42.980]  the NSA, the CIA, the local police department.
[1:26:42.980 --> 1:26:44.700]  Where do you go today if you wanna figure out
[1:26:44.700 --> 1:26:46.380]  who believes what or who thinks what
[1:26:46.380 --> 1:26:48.060]  or who holds what views?
[1:26:48.060 --> 1:26:51.180]  You would be stupid to go anywhere other than Google
[1:26:51.180 --> 1:26:52.980]  because what Google really is,
[1:26:52.980 --> 1:26:55.780]  and this is when it finally hit me, Alex,
[1:26:55.780 --> 1:26:58.940]  and all of a sudden like all these years have been kind of
[1:26:58.940 --> 1:27:00.780]  trying to understand what Google's all about,
[1:27:00.780 --> 1:27:03.740]  just crystallized for me, is back in the 1980s,
[1:27:03.740 --> 1:27:05.780]  I have an undergraduate degree in marketing,
[1:27:05.780 --> 1:27:08.220]  international marketing, and this was before the internet,
[1:27:08.220 --> 1:27:10.220]  and all my professors said, you're never gonna be,
[1:27:10.220 --> 1:27:12.060]  you know, your biggest challenge in marketing
[1:27:12.060 --> 1:27:14.500]  is market research because people won't tell you
[1:27:14.500 --> 1:27:15.700]  what they're thinking about, right?
[1:27:15.700 --> 1:27:17.380]  So if I were to call up somebody
[1:27:17.380 --> 1:27:18.500]  listening to the show right now and say,
[1:27:18.500 --> 1:27:20.700]  hey listen, I'm a market researcher,
[1:27:20.700 --> 1:27:22.060]  just have a bunch of questions for you,
[1:27:22.060 --> 1:27:23.340]  do you have 20 minutes for me?
[1:27:23.340 --> 1:27:24.460]  They'd say, first of all, no.
[1:27:24.460 --> 1:27:27.140]  And I'd say, no, no really, just bear with me please.
[1:27:27.140 --> 1:27:28.860]  Do you have erectile dysfunction,
[1:27:28.860 --> 1:27:30.220]  ever fought with your spouse?
[1:27:30.220 --> 1:27:33.780]  Do you have any sexually transmitted diseases,
[1:27:33.780 --> 1:27:38.140]  dealing with bankruptcy, maybe you've got a kid
[1:27:38.140 --> 1:27:39.100]  that's on drugs?
[1:27:39.100 --> 1:27:40.700]  You would say, take a hike,
[1:27:40.700 --> 1:27:42.140]  I'm not answering any of that stuff,
[1:27:42.140 --> 1:27:43.220]  it's under your business.
[1:27:43.220 --> 1:27:44.820]  So what Google has hit on,
[1:27:44.820 --> 1:27:46.460]  and once I finally understood this,
[1:27:46.460 --> 1:27:48.500]  all of a sudden everything clicked into place,
[1:27:48.500 --> 1:27:50.700]  is Google is not a search engine.
[1:27:50.700 --> 1:27:53.540]  They are not an information provider.
[1:27:53.540 --> 1:27:55.500]  They're a market research company.
[1:27:55.500 --> 1:27:57.420]  And back in the 80s, we couldn't figure out
[1:27:57.420 --> 1:27:59.660]  how to get the market research information,
[1:27:59.660 --> 1:28:01.580]  but Google hit on the most brilliant thing
[1:28:01.580 --> 1:28:04.260]  that has ever, it blows my mind,
[1:28:04.260 --> 1:28:07.900]  I sit here in awe of just the genius evil of these guys.
[1:28:07.900 --> 1:28:08.980]  What they did was they said,
[1:28:08.980 --> 1:28:11.700]  well, I know how we can get people to tell us everything,
[1:28:11.700 --> 1:28:13.100]  like whether they've had an abortion
[1:28:13.100 --> 1:28:14.900]  or a miscarriage or a fight,
[1:28:14.900 --> 1:28:17.620]  or if they had their deepest darkest secrets,
[1:28:17.620 --> 1:28:18.740]  they wouldn't tell anybody.
[1:28:18.740 --> 1:28:20.620]  What we do is we just put a little window
[1:28:20.620 --> 1:28:23.340]  on everybody's computer in the privacy of their own homes
[1:28:23.340 --> 1:28:24.700]  with the shades drawn,
[1:28:24.700 --> 1:28:26.540]  and then we let them type into it
[1:28:26.540 --> 1:28:27.820]  everything about themselves,
[1:28:27.820 --> 1:28:29.300]  and then we just capture it all.
[1:28:29.300 --> 1:28:30.140]  And I'm sure somebody said,
[1:28:30.140 --> 1:28:31.460]  well, how are you gonna get them to do that?
[1:28:31.460 --> 1:28:32.300]  And they said, well,
[1:28:32.300 --> 1:28:34.860]  why don't we just answer all their questions?
[1:28:34.860 --> 1:28:36.700]  So the thing people need to understand,
[1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:39.180]  when you log on, and it's not just Google,
[1:28:39.180 --> 1:28:40.020]  it's Yahoo and Bing,
[1:28:40.020 --> 1:28:41.500]  because Microsoft's in on this too,
[1:28:41.500 --> 1:28:42.780]  they're all part of it,
[1:28:42.780 --> 1:28:45.140]  that when you log on and you ask a question,
[1:28:45.140 --> 1:28:46.900]  that they are not your mom.
[1:28:46.900 --> 1:28:48.700]  They do not, I mean, ask yourself,
[1:28:48.700 --> 1:28:51.500]  why are they answering all my questions for free?
[1:28:51.500 --> 1:28:52.660]  They're not your mom.
[1:28:52.660 --> 1:28:54.500]  They have no reason to wanna give you anything.
[1:28:54.500 --> 1:28:57.500]  They do it because they want to know what's on your mind.
[1:28:57.500 --> 1:28:59.860]  Now, once they do that for market research purposes,
[1:28:59.860 --> 1:29:01.260]  because that's basically what they do,
[1:29:01.260 --> 1:29:02.540]  they sell us to marketers.
[1:29:02.540 --> 1:29:06.060]  So I've got a brand new neon pencil
[1:29:06.060 --> 1:29:07.580]  that glows rainbow colors,
[1:29:07.580 --> 1:29:09.500]  and I wanna know everybody who's interested
[1:29:09.500 --> 1:29:11.380]  in rainbow colors who's ever bought a pencil,
[1:29:11.380 --> 1:29:12.420]  and Google goes, oh yeah,
[1:29:12.420 --> 1:29:14.060]  I can give you that narrow little niche.
[1:29:14.060 --> 1:29:17.100]  And again, the globalist for experts, Catherine,
[1:29:17.100 --> 1:29:19.740]  because they always fund their criminal operations
[1:29:19.740 --> 1:29:21.140]  with a free market thing,
[1:29:21.140 --> 1:29:23.820]  but that's only one sector, as you know,
[1:29:23.820 --> 1:29:24.900]  of what they're really doing.
[1:29:24.900 --> 1:29:27.260]  You read more of the internal corporate minutes
[1:29:27.260 --> 1:29:29.060]  of Google and others that have leaked.
[1:29:29.060 --> 1:29:30.420]  I know you know about these.
[1:29:30.420 --> 1:29:33.500]  They call it over-the-horizon time prediction,
[1:29:33.500 --> 1:29:35.060]  or a crystal ball,
[1:29:35.060 --> 1:29:37.780]  and they now brag that they can tell the future
[1:29:37.780 --> 1:29:40.300]  with an individual 93% of the time,
[1:29:40.300 --> 1:29:43.180]  with mass groups 98% of the time.
[1:29:43.180 --> 1:29:45.540]  They know you're gonna pull over at that steakhouse
[1:29:45.540 --> 1:29:47.020]  before you do.
[1:29:47.020 --> 1:29:49.980]  This is literally the eye of Sauron.
[1:29:49.980 --> 1:29:51.380]  We're on the march.
[1:29:51.380 --> 1:29:53.860]  The empire's on the run.
[1:29:53.860 --> 1:29:56.900]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:56.900 --> 1:30:23.900]  We're on the march.
[1:30:23.900 --> 1:30:50.580]  We're on the march.
[1:30:50.580 --> 1:30:55.100]  See them on the web, www.5starsoap.com,
[1:30:55.100 --> 1:31:01.100]  or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[1:31:01.100 --> 1:31:04.540]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms,
[1:31:04.540 --> 1:31:06.780]  but if you don't have a home security system,
[1:31:06.780 --> 1:31:08.300]  then you're missing a critical weapon
[1:31:08.300 --> 1:31:10.580]  in your arsenal for home protection.
[1:31:10.580 --> 1:31:12.340]  When you're sleeping or away from home,
[1:31:12.340 --> 1:31:14.420]  who's watching out for intruders?
[1:31:14.420 --> 1:31:16.020]  Check out Simply Safe.
[1:31:16.020 --> 1:31:18.420]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system
[1:31:18.420 --> 1:31:20.460]  that is completely wireless.
[1:31:20.460 --> 1:31:23.180]  Go to GetSimplySafe.com.
[1:31:23.180 --> 1:31:25.940]  Simply Safe is independent and off the grid.
[1:31:25.940 --> 1:31:27.300]  It runs on battery power,
[1:31:27.300 --> 1:31:30.260]  so even if the grid goes down, you're protected.
[1:31:30.260 --> 1:31:31.900]  It's completely customizable,
[1:31:31.900 --> 1:31:34.500]  so you can use it in your home, business, boat,
[1:31:34.500 --> 1:31:36.940]  trailer, storage unit, or shed.
[1:31:36.940 --> 1:31:39.260]  GetSimplySafe.com.
[1:31:39.260 --> 1:31:41.620]  Simply Safe is also ridiculously easy
[1:31:41.620 --> 1:31:43.980]  to install yourself in under 20 minutes,
[1:31:43.980 --> 1:31:46.660]  so there's no need to let a stranger into your home.
[1:31:46.660 --> 1:31:48.300]  If you move or need to relocate,
[1:31:48.300 --> 1:31:50.740]  you can take the system with you wherever you go.
[1:31:50.740 --> 1:31:52.100]  You aren't always at home,
[1:31:52.100 --> 1:31:53.860]  but Simply Safe will stand guard,
[1:31:53.860 --> 1:31:57.740]  protecting your property 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[1:31:57.740 --> 1:32:00.260]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.
[1:32:01.260 --> 1:32:02.380]  I had tried everything.
[1:32:02.380 --> 1:32:04.740]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[1:32:04.740 --> 1:32:06.380]  I was lifting weights and jogging,
[1:32:06.380 --> 1:32:07.820]  but nothing was working.
[1:32:07.820 --> 1:32:09.860]  My body was literally starving
[1:32:09.860 --> 1:32:12.700]  for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[1:32:12.700 --> 1:32:14.380]  And as soon as I had that,
[1:32:14.380 --> 1:32:18.140]  I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously
[1:32:18.140 --> 1:32:19.580]  and be satisfied.
[1:32:19.580 --> 1:32:21.340]  Now, there are hundreds of great products
[1:32:21.340 --> 1:32:24.580]  at InfowarsTeam.com, but I want to point out the three
[1:32:24.580 --> 1:32:29.580]  that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[1:32:30.780 --> 1:32:33.340]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine,
[1:32:33.340 --> 1:32:35.300]  Holland Burst, and Rebound.
[1:32:35.300 --> 1:32:37.020]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine
[1:32:37.020 --> 1:32:38.540]  and other products every day,
[1:32:38.540 --> 1:32:41.540]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[1:32:41.540 --> 1:32:43.020]  Now, that's results.
[1:32:43.020 --> 1:32:45.100]  I want to challenge my listeners
[1:32:45.100 --> 1:32:47.420]  to go to InfowarsTeam.com
[1:32:47.420 --> 1:32:49.860]  and to order just three of their products.
[1:32:49.860 --> 1:32:51.380]  And you will see the changes
[1:32:51.380 --> 1:32:54.220]  in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite
[1:32:54.220 --> 1:32:55.500]  almost immediately.

[1:32:58.100 --> 1:33:00.100]  InfowarsTeam.com.
[1:33:01.540 --> 1:33:04.420]  ["Defending the Republic"]
[1:33:04.420 --> 1:33:09.300]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[1:33:09.300 --> 1:33:11.260]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:11.260 --> 1:33:18.260]  ["Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic"]
[1:33:18.820 --> 1:33:21.300]  All right, Catherine Albrecht is our guest.
[1:33:21.300 --> 1:33:22.580]  It's also important to remember
[1:33:22.580 --> 1:33:24.620]  we are not funded by the globalist.
[1:33:24.620 --> 1:33:27.460]  We are not funded by the Bilderberg group.
[1:33:27.460 --> 1:33:30.620]  We are not funded by the New World Order.
[1:33:30.620 --> 1:33:33.180]  We are funded by our sponsors
[1:33:33.180 --> 1:33:34.660]  that are mainly made in America,
[1:33:34.660 --> 1:33:36.980]  high quality companies.
[1:33:37.900 --> 1:33:40.580]  We are funded by you spreading the word.
[1:33:40.580 --> 1:33:44.220]  We are funded by you buying books, t-shirts, and videos.
[1:33:44.220 --> 1:33:46.140]  By the way, I had them go out on the streets of Austin
[1:33:46.140 --> 1:33:47.500]  and pull another 1,000,
[1:33:47.500 --> 1:33:50.140]  as I put 80,000 on the streets of Central Texas,
[1:33:50.140 --> 1:33:53.660]  of the May magazine as it sold out so quick,
[1:33:53.660 --> 1:33:56.860]  the ones that we sell in bulk at cost or for the subscription.
[1:33:56.860 --> 1:33:58.460]  We've had so many subscriptions come in
[1:33:58.460 --> 1:33:59.540]  that we're running out of the ones
[1:33:59.540 --> 1:34:01.220]  we held back for subscriptions,
[1:34:01.220 --> 1:34:02.700]  the next 12 issues,
[1:34:02.700 --> 1:34:06.460]  the May issue getting into false flags, sold out.
[1:34:06.460 --> 1:34:08.460]  So we held back some to sell them as singles,
[1:34:08.460 --> 1:34:09.700]  but those sold out.
[1:34:09.700 --> 1:34:12.580]  So now I've sent the crew out to grab a bunch off the street
[1:34:12.580 --> 1:34:13.740]  that we put out last week.
[1:34:13.740 --> 1:34:15.420]  Most were already gone.
[1:34:15.420 --> 1:34:17.340]  So we've got a little under a thousand left
[1:34:17.340 --> 1:34:20.580]  you can buy individually
[1:34:20.580 --> 1:34:23.580]  with the three free bumper stickers inside each one.
[1:34:23.580 --> 1:34:24.900]  And then on top of it,
[1:34:24.900 --> 1:34:27.300]  I guess it's free if you pick it up on the street.
[1:34:27.300 --> 1:34:30.460]  And then we're also going to,
[1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:33.300]  again, hold some more of those back
[1:34:33.300 --> 1:34:36.660]  for people that subscribe at infowarstore.com

[1:34:49.580 --> 1:34:52.380]  that's filled with graphics and documentation.

[1:36:12.540 --> 1:36:14.900]  All right, going back to Dr. Catherine Albrecht
[1:36:14.900 --> 1:36:18.580]  to talk to your host right here on this network,
[1:36:18.580 --> 1:36:21.340]  continuing to look at what the IRS is doing.
[1:36:21.340 --> 1:36:25.260]  Again, if the IRS and Obama are in trouble
[1:36:25.260 --> 1:36:28.460]  using data to persecute people
[1:36:28.460 --> 1:36:30.180]  and using it against political candidates,
[1:36:30.180 --> 1:36:32.820]  imagine what's going on with Google
[1:36:32.820 --> 1:36:35.180]  and their whole history 14 years ago
[1:36:35.180 --> 1:36:38.740]  set up by the NSA and CIA, that's a fact.
[1:36:39.540 --> 1:36:41.100]  But when I started covering that,
[1:36:41.100 --> 1:36:43.660]  they delisted me from Google News,
[1:36:43.660 --> 1:36:46.700]  which again, is the future everyone is going to face
[1:36:46.700 --> 1:36:48.020]  if we let them convert
[1:36:48.020 --> 1:36:50.580]  to their technocratic takeover.
[1:36:50.580 --> 1:36:53.700]  So Catherine, getting into this and where this is going
[1:36:53.700 --> 1:36:57.220]  and ways to defeat them and all the other facets to this,
[1:36:57.220 --> 1:36:59.780]  thank you for joining us, break that down.
[1:36:59.780 --> 1:37:01.820]  Well, you know, it's interesting because
[1:37:01.820 --> 1:37:04.900]  what used to be really hidden 10, 15 years ago
[1:37:04.900 --> 1:37:07.060]  when the internet was first coming to life
[1:37:07.060 --> 1:37:09.620]  is now not only obvious
[1:37:09.620 --> 1:37:11.660]  because you and I have been talking about it for years,
[1:37:11.660 --> 1:37:13.500]  but now they're coming out and saying it.
[1:37:13.500 --> 1:37:16.260]  And I don't mean to just pick on Google,
[1:37:16.260 --> 1:37:17.860]  Google certainly deserves it,
[1:37:17.860 --> 1:37:19.300]  but I think we also need to take a look
[1:37:19.300 --> 1:37:20.900]  at what's going on with Yahoo and Bing,
[1:37:20.900 --> 1:37:23.580]  which is Microsoft, which is Bill Gates, who's got,
[1:37:23.580 --> 1:37:26.820]  I mean, you've done a great job of informing people
[1:37:26.820 --> 1:37:29.100]  about all the stuff Bill Gates is up to
[1:37:29.100 --> 1:37:30.180]  all over the world.
[1:37:30.180 --> 1:37:32.900]  So it's all kind of part of the same thing.
[1:37:32.900 --> 1:37:34.100]  Let me point something out
[1:37:34.100 --> 1:37:36.340]  that I'm sure you have millions of listeners right now
[1:37:36.340 --> 1:37:38.540]  who have Yahoo email accounts.
[1:37:38.540 --> 1:37:41.380]  And on June 1st, all of those millions of listeners
[1:37:41.380 --> 1:37:43.380]  in like two weeks here are gonna have to sign up
[1:37:43.380 --> 1:37:45.660]  for the new version of Yahoo Mail.
[1:37:45.660 --> 1:37:47.900]  And I just wanna read this one sentence
[1:37:47.900 --> 1:37:51.140]  off of Yahoo's new webpage here.
[1:37:51.140 --> 1:37:53.860]  Do I have to upgrade to the new version of Yahoo Mail?
[1:37:53.860 --> 1:37:54.900]  Listen to what they say.
[1:37:54.900 --> 1:37:57.700]  When you upgrade, you'll be accepting our communications
[1:37:57.700 --> 1:37:59.820]  in terms of service and privacy policy.
[1:37:59.820 --> 1:38:03.820]  This includes the acceptance of automated content scanning
[1:38:03.820 --> 1:38:07.860]  and analyzing of your communications content.
[1:38:07.860 --> 1:38:10.020]  Now, this is the kind of thing that would have been buried.
[1:38:10.020 --> 1:38:13.420]  This is like paragraph two of their main page of, hey, upgrade.
[1:38:13.420 --> 1:38:15.860]  So it's no longer even hidden.
[1:38:15.860 --> 1:38:17.460]  That's the part that's blowing my mind.
[1:38:17.460 --> 1:38:20.140]  Alex is, you and I have been pulling this stuff
[1:38:20.140 --> 1:38:22.180]  out of the shadows and showing it to people for years
[1:38:22.180 --> 1:38:24.060]  and people like, oh, they'd never do that.
[1:38:24.060 --> 1:38:26.060]  I had one person, I remember when I was doing
[1:38:26.060 --> 1:38:27.900]  my doctoral research, I asked people,
[1:38:27.900 --> 1:38:29.420]  do you know what the supermarket card is for?
[1:38:29.420 --> 1:38:30.860]  Do you know that every time you scan a thing
[1:38:30.860 --> 1:38:33.300]  at your grocery store, they make a record of what you buy
[1:38:33.300 --> 1:38:36.140]  and they can tell exactly the health profile
[1:38:36.140 --> 1:38:37.540]  of your family because of it?
[1:38:37.540 --> 1:38:39.020]  And I had people look me in the eye and say,
[1:38:39.020 --> 1:38:40.420]  that's not true, I don't believe it.
[1:38:40.420 --> 1:38:42.660]  That's conspiracy theory, I don't buy it.
[1:38:42.660 --> 1:38:44.180]  They're not the CIA.
[1:38:44.180 --> 1:38:46.300]  And I've got incontrovertible proof
[1:38:46.300 --> 1:38:47.540]  that that's exactly what they do.
[1:38:47.540 --> 1:38:49.340]  And now they're coming out and saying it openly.
[1:38:49.340 --> 1:38:50.660]  That's what they wanna do.
[1:38:50.660 --> 1:38:52.500]  So now you've got articles in the Wall Street Journal
[1:38:52.500 --> 1:38:53.820]  of the New York Times saying, yes, well,
[1:38:53.820 --> 1:38:56.300]  since we have these nutritional health profiles
[1:38:56.300 --> 1:38:57.700]  on every household in America,
[1:38:57.700 --> 1:38:59.300]  we're gonna tie that in with Obamacare
[1:38:59.300 --> 1:39:02.660]  and use it, the frequent shopper cards to monitor your health.
[1:39:02.660 --> 1:39:04.780]  Well, it's now the same thing with the email.
[1:39:04.780 --> 1:39:06.820]  They're now coming right out on Yahoo.
[1:39:06.820 --> 1:39:09.180]  And then I wanna get into this Google patent
[1:39:09.180 --> 1:39:11.700]  that we were talking about behind the scenes here.
[1:39:11.700 --> 1:39:14.580]  The Google has now filed a patent to do the same thing,
[1:39:14.580 --> 1:39:16.900]  saying that not only are we gonna be reviewing
[1:39:16.900 --> 1:39:18.820]  all your email, which they do through Gmail.
[1:39:18.820 --> 1:39:19.780]  It's in the fine print.
[1:39:19.780 --> 1:39:21.340]  Every single email you send or receive,
[1:39:21.340 --> 1:39:24.500]  they are analyzing, just like Google here, content scanning
[1:39:24.500 --> 1:39:27.220]  and analyzing your communications content.
[1:39:27.220 --> 1:39:30.260]  But in real time, this Google patent,
[1:39:30.260 --> 1:39:32.740]  if you type something that they don't like,
[1:39:32.740 --> 1:39:34.620]  right there as you're typing it,
[1:39:34.620 --> 1:39:37.620]  it will stop you from literally typing the words.
[1:39:37.620 --> 1:39:39.180]  Like a screen will pop out of a little box.
[1:39:39.180 --> 1:39:40.020]  Unbelievable.
[1:39:40.020 --> 1:39:41.460]  Oh, it's already like iPhones,
[1:39:41.460 --> 1:39:46.300]  won't let you send a cuss word or even say double E hockey
[1:39:46.300 --> 1:39:47.180]  sticks.
[1:39:47.180 --> 1:39:50.340]  I mean, this is the nanny state
[1:39:50.340 --> 1:39:53.660]  on steroids and there's the headline exclusive.
[1:39:53.660 --> 1:39:57.700]  Google CIA, invest a future of web monitoring.
[1:39:57.700 --> 1:39:59.220]  And folks show people the headlines,
[1:39:59.220 --> 1:40:00.900]  so I can tell them the source on that.
[1:40:00.900 --> 1:40:03.100]  That's Wired Magazine.
[1:40:03.100 --> 1:40:07.380]  I mean, these guys are out in the open on their power trip,
[1:40:07.380 --> 1:40:10.940]  building this artificial control grid environment,
[1:40:10.940 --> 1:40:14.120]  just like they game the stock market with instant trading.
[1:40:14.120 --> 1:40:15.620]  They're doing the same thing here.
[1:40:15.620 --> 1:40:17.860]  This has got to stop.
[1:40:17.860 --> 1:40:21.100]  So can you imagine that you, not only would they know
[1:40:21.100 --> 1:40:24.420]  if you were typing something bad in their minds, right?
[1:40:24.420 --> 1:40:25.900]  I believe in the Constitution.
[1:40:25.900 --> 1:40:27.300]  No, no, you can't say that.
[1:40:28.500 --> 1:40:30.180]  That merely writing the letters,
[1:40:30.180 --> 1:40:32.500]  C-O-N-S-T-I-T, they go, nope.
[1:40:32.500 --> 1:40:34.900]  And then a little nanny window would pop up.
[1:40:34.900 --> 1:40:36.340]  This is what they've patented now
[1:40:36.340 --> 1:40:37.940]  with the US Patent and Trademark Office.
[1:40:37.940 --> 1:40:40.180]  It's a formally officially signed,
[1:40:40.180 --> 1:40:42.580]  sealed and delivered document from Google.
[1:40:42.580 --> 1:40:45.020]  And what they want to be able to do is say,
[1:40:45.020 --> 1:40:47.620]  no, as you're typing the words that we don't like,
[1:40:47.620 --> 1:40:48.900]  a little window pops up and says,
[1:40:48.900 --> 1:40:50.100]  we're sorry, you can't say that.
[1:40:50.100 --> 1:40:52.100]  You're gonna have to rephrase it or just delete it
[1:40:52.100 --> 1:40:53.420]  or just not say it at all.
[1:40:53.420 --> 1:40:56.260]  So not only are they watching or planning to watch,
[1:40:56.260 --> 1:40:58.380]  well, already today they're reading and watching
[1:40:58.380 --> 1:41:01.660]  every single Google Gmail you send or receive.
[1:41:01.660 --> 1:41:03.820]  Even if you don't have a Google account, by the way,
[1:41:03.820 --> 1:41:06.860]  if you send an email to somebody with a Gmail account,
[1:41:06.860 --> 1:41:10.620]  you agree contractually to their terms of service,
[1:41:10.620 --> 1:41:11.740]  even though you haven't even read them
[1:41:11.740 --> 1:41:12.820]  because it didn't even cross your mind
[1:41:12.820 --> 1:41:14.380]  because you're not the one with the account.
[1:41:14.380 --> 1:41:16.460]  But if I send an email to somebody
[1:41:16.460 --> 1:41:17.940]  who has a Gmail account and it says,
[1:41:17.940 --> 1:41:19.140]  hi, my name's Catherine Albrecht,
[1:41:19.140 --> 1:41:22.180]  here's my social security number for whatever reason, right?
[1:41:22.180 --> 1:41:24.740]  Maybe they're a banker, maybe they're my doctor, whatever.
[1:41:24.740 --> 1:41:27.940]  Then at that point, Google says, we own that information
[1:41:27.940 --> 1:41:29.100]  and they'll strip it right out,
[1:41:29.100 --> 1:41:31.380]  even though it's my doctor's Gmail account,
[1:41:31.380 --> 1:41:32.660]  they'll strip out my information,
[1:41:32.660 --> 1:41:35.020]  take my social security number right out of that email
[1:41:35.020 --> 1:41:37.220]  and pop it in the Catherine Albrecht account.
[1:41:37.220 --> 1:41:38.980]  And you may say, well, why would Catherine Albrecht
[1:41:38.980 --> 1:41:40.220]  have a Google account?
[1:41:40.220 --> 1:41:41.460]  I have news for people.
[1:41:41.460 --> 1:41:44.860]  Every single person on this globe has a Google account.
[1:41:44.860 --> 1:41:46.420]  They have one for all of us.
[1:41:46.420 --> 1:41:48.580]  Every person they can find, every house,
[1:41:48.580 --> 1:41:51.260]  every front of your home, they do Google Street View.
[1:41:51.260 --> 1:41:53.980]  They have a picture of the curtains hanging in your window.
[1:41:53.980 --> 1:41:58.980]  And this is beyond 1984 because they admit their surveilling
[1:41:58.980 --> 1:42:02.900]  and creating detailed psychological algorithm profiles
[1:42:02.900 --> 1:42:04.260]  of everybody.
[1:42:04.260 --> 1:42:07.900]  And it's beyond 1984 because your smartphone,
[1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:12.300]  your appliances, the smart meters all surveil you.
[1:42:12.300 --> 1:42:14.260]  And if you don't let them put the smart meter on your house,
[1:42:14.260 --> 1:42:16.300]  they come and try to arrest you.
[1:42:16.300 --> 1:42:19.820]  And then they brag and call themselves technocrats
[1:42:19.820 --> 1:42:22.020]  and talk about how they're gonna merge with machines
[1:42:22.020 --> 1:42:23.340]  and become God.
[1:42:23.340 --> 1:42:26.140]  They are literally on insane power trips.
[1:42:26.140 --> 1:42:27.620]  It's crazy, right?
[1:42:27.620 --> 1:42:31.900]  And you're of course referring to Sergei and Larry saying,
[1:42:31.900 --> 1:42:33.060]  what do you want Google to become?
[1:42:33.060 --> 1:42:35.260]  And their answer was like the mind of God.
[1:42:35.260 --> 1:42:37.140]  And then the guy that they just hired
[1:42:37.140 --> 1:42:40.820]  to head up their entire IT is the man Ray Kurzweil
[1:42:40.820 --> 1:42:44.420]  who believes that in 2045, humanity will merge
[1:42:44.420 --> 1:42:46.900]  with our machines and we'll have a singularity
[1:42:46.900 --> 1:42:49.820]  at which point humanity will become immortal.
[1:42:49.820 --> 1:42:51.620]  And by the way, it's not just Kurzweil,
[1:42:51.620 --> 1:42:54.620]  he's their guru and goes to the globalist meetings
[1:42:54.620 --> 1:42:56.980]  and they believe it's actually gonna be sooner.
[1:42:56.980 --> 1:42:59.660]  They just put that number out there, they say,
[1:42:59.660 --> 1:43:02.020]  so we don't get freaked out.
[1:43:02.020 --> 1:43:05.260]  Human culture is already over as we knew it because of TV.
[1:43:05.260 --> 1:43:07.900]  Now I go out in public, no one's talking,
[1:43:07.900 --> 1:43:10.780]  they're all on their smartphones, myself included.
[1:43:10.780 --> 1:43:14.460]  But at least I'm talking to people about the matrix
[1:43:14.460 --> 1:43:16.740]  and how to fight it using the system.
[1:43:16.740 --> 1:43:20.380]  I'm not saying that's okay, they are just,
[1:43:20.380 --> 1:43:23.300]  parents don't even talk to their kids now.
[1:43:23.300 --> 1:43:26.580]  In between the TV, the video games and the smartphones,
[1:43:26.580 --> 1:43:29.180]  the language is shrinking, Catherine.
[1:43:29.180 --> 1:43:31.860]  Where do you see this all ultimately going?
[1:43:31.860 --> 1:43:34.220]  Well, you know, this is enslaving technology.
[1:43:34.220 --> 1:43:36.860]  I mean, I've got an article here about when they hired
[1:43:36.860 --> 1:43:38.500]  Ray Kurzweil into Google.
[1:43:38.500 --> 1:43:41.060]  Ray Kurzweil plans to create a mind at Google
[1:43:41.060 --> 1:43:42.460]  and have it serve you.
[1:43:42.460 --> 1:43:44.060]  So this is this plan that there's gonna be
[1:43:44.060 --> 1:43:46.820]  this artificial intelligence, something else he said
[1:43:46.820 --> 1:43:49.060]  is that our technology will be in a very short time
[1:43:49.060 --> 1:43:52.220]  a billion times more powerful than it is today.
[1:43:52.220 --> 1:43:53.900]  And it's gonna become so overwhelming
[1:43:53.900 --> 1:43:55.900]  that we will not be able to comprehend it.
[1:43:55.900 --> 1:43:57.620]  And the only way we're gonna be able to catch up
[1:43:57.620 --> 1:43:59.660]  is by uploading ourselves into it,
[1:43:59.660 --> 1:44:02.980]  by actually dumping these packages of meat called bodies
[1:44:02.980 --> 1:44:07.980]  and becoming one with this technological web
[1:44:07.980 --> 1:44:08.820]  and how we say it.
[1:44:08.820 --> 1:44:09.940]  Well, listen, this is in my book,
[1:44:09.940 --> 1:44:10.900]  The Sentent to Charity.
[1:44:10.900 --> 1:44:14.980]  There was a 1970, 77 Pentagon document
[1:44:14.980 --> 1:44:17.140]  with the World Federation of Scientists overseeing it.
[1:44:17.140 --> 1:44:19.980]  It was declassified in 2001
[1:44:19.980 --> 1:44:21.940]  and then reclassified the next year.
[1:44:21.940 --> 1:44:26.060]  But they say we're all going to be in these tank pods
[1:44:26.060 --> 1:44:29.740]  hooked into wires and it will power ourselves
[1:44:29.740 --> 1:44:31.860]  and it'll end all war and people are gonna wait a minute.
[1:44:31.860 --> 1:44:33.020]  That's the matrix.
[1:44:33.020 --> 1:44:36.800]  The matrix is actually a movie talking about
[1:44:36.800 --> 1:44:39.580]  what they planned in the 70s.
[1:44:39.580 --> 1:44:40.420]  Isn't it crazy?
[1:44:40.420 --> 1:44:43.740]  I know, and so keep listening to Alex, everybody,
[1:44:43.740 --> 1:44:46.900]  because he gets this stuff years before anybody else does.
[1:44:46.900 --> 1:44:48.140]  Well, no, I mean, I'm not bragging about it.
[1:44:48.140 --> 1:44:48.980]  No, no, no, no, but it's true.
[1:44:48.980 --> 1:44:49.820]  I don't get it.
[1:44:49.820 --> 1:44:50.940]  They declassified it.
[1:44:50.940 --> 1:44:54.740]  I mean, they're gonna put us in tank pods.
[1:44:54.740 --> 1:44:55.580]  Yeah.
[1:44:55.580 --> 1:44:56.740]  I mean, they're crazy.
[1:44:56.740 --> 1:44:58.340]  And the reason that you get that
[1:44:58.340 --> 1:45:00.740]  is because you got your nose to the ground
[1:45:00.740 --> 1:45:02.620]  and they tell us these things.
[1:45:02.620 --> 1:45:05.340]  They come out and actually say, here's what we're gonna do.
[1:45:05.340 --> 1:45:08.340]  And initially they say it in places that are hard to find
[1:45:08.340 --> 1:45:10.660]  and you gotta really look and you gotta be aware.
[1:45:10.660 --> 1:45:12.700]  And then if you cover it and then if you cover it,
[1:45:12.700 --> 1:45:14.300]  the media says you're a liar,
[1:45:14.300 --> 1:45:16.180]  knowing people won't go find where you got it.
[1:45:16.180 --> 1:45:17.020]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[1:45:17.020 --> 1:45:17.860]  That's right.
[1:45:17.860 --> 1:45:18.700]  No, it's true.
[1:45:18.700 --> 1:45:19.540]  It's true.
[1:45:19.540 --> 1:45:20.380]  And then they try to say, no, you're a conspiracist
[1:45:20.380 --> 1:45:24.260]  or you're creating outrageous scenarios to scare people.
[1:45:24.260 --> 1:45:25.540]  And then two, three years later,
[1:45:25.540 --> 1:45:27.980]  they put it right on their homepage like Google's doing
[1:45:27.980 --> 1:45:29.020]  or like Yahoo is doing.
[1:45:29.020 --> 1:45:29.860]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1:45:29.860 --> 1:45:31.780]  Eight years ago, Watson wrote about their patent
[1:45:31.780 --> 1:45:34.060]  to have a camera and microphone listened to you
[1:45:34.060 --> 1:45:35.340]  with keyword software.
[1:45:35.340 --> 1:45:38.540]  And now everywhere I know says that it must be listening
[1:45:38.540 --> 1:45:40.500]  because it knows what they're doing
[1:45:40.500 --> 1:45:42.420]  from what they're talking about in the room.
[1:45:42.420 --> 1:45:44.580]  And now Google admits it.
[1:45:45.780 --> 1:45:47.100]  See, there you have it.
[1:45:47.100 --> 1:45:49.900]  And like once again, this Yahoo mail,
[1:45:49.900 --> 1:45:53.500]  this includes your acceptance of automated content scanning
[1:45:53.500 --> 1:45:56.020]  and analyzing your communication content.
[1:45:56.020 --> 1:45:58.420]  Who looks at that and goes, oh, okay.
[1:45:58.420 --> 1:46:02.600]  I mean, let's try this back to the IRS issue.
[1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:06.420]  So we know because of this IRS thing that governments,
[1:46:06.420 --> 1:46:07.860]  and this is what they've always done,
[1:46:07.860 --> 1:46:10.380]  they like identifying their opponents
[1:46:10.380 --> 1:46:12.140]  so that they can then single them out
[1:46:12.140 --> 1:46:13.900]  and punish them and harm them.
[1:46:13.900 --> 1:46:16.620]  And it may be that they punish them with an IRS audit,
[1:46:16.620 --> 1:46:18.340]  which is pretty darn punishing.
[1:46:18.340 --> 1:46:19.820]  Or it may be that they punish them
[1:46:19.820 --> 1:46:21.620]  with the black limo drives up at night
[1:46:21.620 --> 1:46:23.700]  and disappears half your family members,
[1:46:23.700 --> 1:46:27.500]  but governments punish people who oppose their regime.
[1:46:27.500 --> 1:46:29.500]  And this is the problem that you have.
[1:46:29.500 --> 1:46:32.460]  When you are letting them know every correspondent
[1:46:32.460 --> 1:46:34.020]  that you have, when you're letting them know
[1:46:34.020 --> 1:46:36.180]  every personal thought, because you're sending it all
[1:46:36.180 --> 1:46:37.900]  through these email programs,
[1:46:37.900 --> 1:46:41.380]  or you're typing all your searches into these search boxes,
[1:46:41.380 --> 1:46:44.820]  then it absolutely is inevitable
[1:46:44.820 --> 1:46:46.660]  that the government is gonna say, okay,
[1:46:46.660 --> 1:46:49.680]  well, today it was the people who liked the Constitution.
[1:46:49.680 --> 1:46:51.380]  Tomorrow, I wanna know everybody
[1:46:51.380 --> 1:46:53.040]  who has a brain in their head.
[1:46:53.040 --> 1:46:54.140]  Let's identify them all.
[1:46:54.140 --> 1:46:56.020]  You know, that's what they did in Cambodia.
[1:46:56.020 --> 1:46:59.300]  Pol Pot killed all of the people with college degrees.
[1:46:59.300 --> 1:47:00.460]  And when he was done,
[1:47:00.460 --> 1:47:02.580]  he killed all the people with high school diplomas.
[1:47:02.580 --> 1:47:03.700]  And when he was done,
[1:47:03.700 --> 1:47:05.500]  he killed all the people who wore glasses
[1:47:05.500 --> 1:47:07.180]  because he figured that meant that they could read.
[1:47:07.180 --> 1:47:09.820]  And when he was done, he killed everybody who could read.
[1:47:09.820 --> 1:47:11.540]  And when he was finally done
[1:47:11.540 --> 1:47:14.100]  and had killed one quarter of the population of Cambodia
[1:47:14.100 --> 1:47:16.780]  in the 1970s, at that point, he said, okay,
[1:47:16.780 --> 1:47:19.500]  now let's modernize the country and build dams and bridges.
[1:47:19.500 --> 1:47:21.540]  And of course, he had all these illiterate peasants
[1:47:21.540 --> 1:47:22.980]  trying to build dams and they all broke.
[1:47:22.980 --> 1:47:24.540]  And it was a disaster.
[1:47:24.540 --> 1:47:28.460]  But that's, he identified his opponents at some future.
[1:47:28.460 --> 1:47:31.620]  It's at an eventual point as anybody smart
[1:47:31.620 --> 1:47:34.300]  because he knew that what he was doing was so evil
[1:47:34.300 --> 1:47:36.260]  that anybody with any intelligence at all
[1:47:36.260 --> 1:47:37.100]  would oppose him.
[1:47:37.100 --> 1:47:38.740]  And so he just killed them all.
[1:47:38.740 --> 1:47:41.340]  So this is why you don't wanna let government know
[1:47:41.340 --> 1:47:43.700]  your every viewpoint, your every attitude,
[1:47:43.700 --> 1:47:46.540]  even if it's innocuous, like I wear glasses,
[1:47:46.540 --> 1:47:47.740]  keep it to yourself
[1:47:47.740 --> 1:47:49.660]  because they're gonna use it against you.
[1:47:49.660 --> 1:47:50.740]  It's just, it's inevitable.
[1:47:50.740 --> 1:47:51.740]  It's how they work.
[1:47:53.380 --> 1:47:55.060]  So crazy, crazy stuff.
[1:47:55.060 --> 1:47:56.300]  Well, Catherine, you've got the floor
[1:47:56.300 --> 1:47:58.140]  because if I interrupt here,
[1:47:58.140 --> 1:48:00.460]  I mean, I'm gonna run over you, keep going, keep rolling.
[1:48:00.460 --> 1:48:01.860]  Yeah, so let me jump in.
[1:48:01.860 --> 1:48:03.220]  And I know that your listeners,
[1:48:03.220 --> 1:48:05.020]  because we've been talking about this a couple of times
[1:48:05.020 --> 1:48:07.420]  about, well, for a couple of, well, now,
[1:48:07.420 --> 1:48:09.980]  two years since we've been building StartMail
[1:48:09.980 --> 1:48:14.260]  is we need to be developing tools to have alternatives.
[1:48:14.260 --> 1:48:16.340]  And the tools that I work on,
[1:48:16.340 --> 1:48:19.460]  startpage.com, xquik.com, startmail.com,
[1:48:19.460 --> 1:48:21.300]  that's the stuff I'm trying to contribute.
[1:48:21.300 --> 1:48:23.060]  But you have brilliant listeners out there
[1:48:23.060 --> 1:48:26.980]  with backgrounds in computers and engineering and technology.
[1:48:26.980 --> 1:48:30.180]  And we've got a lot of smart people on our team.
[1:48:30.180 --> 1:48:32.660]  I was really encouraged by something I heard
[1:48:32.660 --> 1:48:33.860]  out of Austin, Texas,
[1:48:33.860 --> 1:48:36.340]  which I know you have everything to do with this.
[1:48:36.340 --> 1:48:38.380]  Somebody was telling me that they did a poll in Austin
[1:48:38.380 --> 1:48:42.380]  and 29% of Austin, Texas residents identified,
[1:48:42.380 --> 1:48:45.980]  not as Republicans or Democrats or independents,
[1:48:45.980 --> 1:48:48.140]  but as members of the Liberty Movement.
[1:48:48.140 --> 1:48:51.140]  And that's absolutely, your voice and my voice,
[1:48:51.140 --> 1:48:53.100]  we're broadcasting through Austin.
[1:48:53.100 --> 1:48:55.740]  29% of people is a revolution.
[1:48:55.740 --> 1:48:59.860]  So let's take that 29%, 30%, a third of America
[1:48:59.860 --> 1:49:02.780]  is now caught on, woken up and alive
[1:49:02.780 --> 1:49:04.220]  and paying attention to this stuff.
[1:49:04.220 --> 1:49:06.260]  And we are in an information war.
[1:49:06.260 --> 1:49:08.420]  Let's get those people out there, first of all,
[1:49:08.420 --> 1:49:11.220]  getting off of these bad tools and onto the good tools.
[1:49:11.220 --> 1:49:13.300]  And then second of all, building them.
[1:49:13.300 --> 1:49:15.460]  Let's build a new DNS server.
[1:49:15.460 --> 1:49:16.620]  Let's build, you know,
[1:49:16.620 --> 1:49:18.820]  that doesn't transmit every website you go to,
[1:49:18.820 --> 1:49:19.660]  to big brother.
[1:49:19.660 --> 1:49:21.180]  Let's build a...
[1:49:21.180 --> 1:49:22.940]  And by the way, we've got to do this soon
[1:49:22.940 --> 1:49:24.180]  because you were gonna be on last week,
[1:49:24.180 --> 1:49:25.740]  but we had breaking news.
[1:49:25.740 --> 1:49:29.780]  Google has delisted us off Google News years ago.
[1:49:29.780 --> 1:49:31.580]  Now they're putting out fake reports
[1:49:31.580 --> 1:49:33.380]  on drudge and info wars.
[1:49:33.380 --> 1:49:35.300]  And even CNET News had to admit,
[1:49:35.300 --> 1:49:37.780]  it's Google software, we're not even running.
[1:49:37.780 --> 1:49:39.180]  Google is lying.
[1:49:39.180 --> 1:49:40.980]  This is exactly what they're calling for
[1:49:40.980 --> 1:49:42.580]  what Paul Watson was saying.
[1:49:42.580 --> 1:49:43.900]  They're minutes at Bilderberg,
[1:49:43.900 --> 1:49:46.980]  they're planning to try to bring in a blacklist
[1:49:46.980 --> 1:49:49.180]  like the D notices they have in England
[1:49:49.180 --> 1:49:51.620]  to block our sites off the web.
[1:49:51.620 --> 1:49:54.140]  So can we talk about that in the filter bubble
[1:49:54.140 --> 1:49:55.700]  because they go hand in hand?
[1:49:55.700 --> 1:49:57.220]  So most people don't realize
[1:49:57.220 --> 1:49:58.820]  that there's this thing called a filter bubble,
[1:49:58.820 --> 1:50:00.540]  which is, you know, you think that Google
[1:50:00.540 --> 1:50:01.620]  is just gonna give you the truth
[1:50:01.620 --> 1:50:02.580]  about everything all the time
[1:50:02.580 --> 1:50:04.180]  because we view them like I said earlier,
[1:50:04.180 --> 1:50:05.220]  like mom, right?
[1:50:05.220 --> 1:50:06.980]  You go to your mom, hey, why is this guy blue?
[1:50:06.980 --> 1:50:09.620]  And she'll do her best to give you the answer.
[1:50:09.620 --> 1:50:12.620]  You go to Google though and you say, why is this guy blue?
[1:50:12.620 --> 1:50:16.020]  And they take a look at your past history and say,
[1:50:16.020 --> 1:50:18.060]  well, let's see, what kind of being the answer
[1:50:18.060 --> 1:50:19.660]  do we think you're looking for?
[1:50:19.660 --> 1:50:21.460]  And if we think that you're looking for,
[1:50:21.460 --> 1:50:23.900]  and the reason this filter bubble is so important,
[1:50:23.900 --> 1:50:27.260]  they give you the answers that they think you are seeking
[1:50:27.260 --> 1:50:28.700]  based on your previous searches,
[1:50:28.700 --> 1:50:30.940]  based on their understanding of the little tiny bubble
[1:50:30.940 --> 1:50:32.820]  of demographics that they put you in.
[1:50:32.820 --> 1:50:35.020]  And the problem that this creates, Alex,
[1:50:35.020 --> 1:50:36.660]  is that when you and I go online
[1:50:36.660 --> 1:50:38.900]  and we look up, for example, Monsanto, right?
[1:50:38.900 --> 1:50:42.780]  Or Monsanto GMO, if we go onto Google and do that,
[1:50:42.780 --> 1:50:45.140]  you and I are both gonna get a whole list of things
[1:50:45.140 --> 1:50:45.980]  telling you how fair it is.
[1:50:45.980 --> 1:50:47.540]  They admitted social engineering
[1:50:47.540 --> 1:50:48.900]  to put us in our own bubble,
[1:50:48.900 --> 1:50:51.700]  and then phase two is they start twisting
[1:50:51.700 --> 1:50:53.860]  what's in that bubble as well.
[1:50:53.860 --> 1:50:56.740]  This is literally digital prisons.
[1:50:56.740 --> 1:50:59.180]  Google folks is the beast system.
[1:50:59.180 --> 1:51:01.380]  Google is evil incarnate.

[1:51:56.860 --> 1:52:00.780]  BigBurkyWaterFielders for the love of clean water.
[1:52:00.780 --> 1:52:02.300]  In the last two years alone,
[1:52:02.300 --> 1:52:04.820]  the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[1:52:04.820 --> 1:52:08.300]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S.,
[1:52:08.300 --> 1:52:10.540]  costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone.
[1:52:10.540 --> 1:52:13.180]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country
[1:52:13.180 --> 1:52:14.540]  in more than 50 years.
[1:52:14.540 --> 1:52:16.620]  You may think out of sight, out of mind,
[1:52:16.620 --> 1:52:18.380]  and so you don't think you will be affected.
[1:52:18.380 --> 1:52:19.780]  The fact is, you are.
[1:52:19.780 --> 1:52:20.780]  We all are.
[1:52:20.780 --> 1:52:23.460]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[1:52:23.460 --> 1:52:25.620]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature,
[1:52:25.620 --> 1:52:27.700]  but you can control your food prices
[1:52:27.700 --> 1:52:29.700]  by freezing the cost and availability

[1:53:00.140 --> 1:53:02.460]  What's more amazing than a Swiss Army knife?

[1:53:04.020 --> 1:53:07.300]  It's 11 functions rolled into one pocket-sized tool,

[1:53:09.700 --> 1:53:10.860]  a can opener, too.
[1:53:10.860 --> 1:53:12.220]  It even has a wrench.
[1:53:12.220 --> 1:53:14.500]  It lays flat, fits right in your wallet.
[1:53:14.500 --> 1:53:16.900]  A survival multi-tool for your wallet.

[1:53:19.980 --> 1:53:21.700]  and built to last yours free.

[1:53:29.900 --> 1:53:31.520]  Bills in front of Congress right now
[1:53:31.520 --> 1:53:34.140]  could take away your right to keep and bear arms.
[1:53:34.140 --> 1:53:37.020]  If Obama has his way, all guns will be either banned,
[1:53:37.020 --> 1:53:40.380]  restricted, or confiscated, possibly by executive order.
[1:53:40.380 --> 1:53:42.740]  The best way to keep your guns is to hide them.
[1:53:42.740 --> 1:53:45.340]  What Obama can't find, Obama can't take away.
[1:53:45.340 --> 1:53:47.740]  You can protect your guns from any threat.

[1:53:59.340 --> 1:54:19.100]  You know what Hank Hill says about Google, don't you?
[1:54:19.100 --> 1:54:21.820]  That Google is just plain evil.
[1:54:21.820 --> 1:54:25.500]  I'll do a very good, a very good Hank Hill.
[1:54:25.500 --> 1:54:28.420]  We were just talking about Hank Hill during the break.
[1:54:28.420 --> 1:54:30.260]  I'll be gone like I said.
[1:54:32.060 --> 1:54:33.860]  You know, I try to joke around about this stuff.
[1:54:33.860 --> 1:54:35.100]  This is ultra creepy.
[1:54:35.100 --> 1:54:36.940]  They plan to dominate the future.
[1:54:36.940 --> 1:54:38.740]  This is the future of warfare.
[1:54:38.740 --> 1:54:40.980]  They are robbing you of your privacy,
[1:54:40.980 --> 1:54:42.780]  and they think it's all a big joke.
[1:54:43.860 --> 1:54:46.540]  And it is a nightmare fight we're talking about.
[1:54:46.540 --> 1:54:49.100]  Catherine Albrecht's our guest in this segment and the next.
[1:54:49.100 --> 1:54:51.300]  And Richard Belzer's gonna be joining us
[1:54:51.300 --> 1:54:53.540]  because he was on, during the Boston bombing
[1:54:53.540 --> 1:54:56.560]  when it happened, when we said, okay, if there's drills,
[1:54:56.560 --> 1:54:58.940]  if there's stand downs, if the Patsies are connected
[1:54:58.940 --> 1:55:03.260]  to the FBI and CIA, you know it's a staged event.
[1:55:03.260 --> 1:55:05.140]  And then all of that happened.
[1:55:05.140 --> 1:55:07.300]  And now we know it was a staged event.
[1:55:07.300 --> 1:55:09.900]  And just like I told you, the IRS is persecuting people
[1:55:09.900 --> 1:55:11.300]  before this came out.
[1:55:11.300 --> 1:55:13.640]  I know a bunch of people being persecuted.
[1:55:14.820 --> 1:55:16.300]  I've had a little bit of it.
[1:55:17.100 --> 1:55:18.900]  I've talked to people inside the IRS,
[1:55:18.900 --> 1:55:21.940]  their biggest IRS center in the countries here in Austin,
[1:55:21.940 --> 1:55:23.500]  like two miles from where I sit.
[1:55:23.500 --> 1:55:28.500]  And again, Google makes the IRS look like angels
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:31.720]  because they are something from 1913.
[1:55:31.720 --> 1:55:34.660]  And it is just incredible how they've now come out and go,
[1:55:34.660 --> 1:55:37.100]  the IRS is watching your bank account without warrants.
[1:55:37.100 --> 1:55:39.260]  Oh, the Defense Department is watching everything
[1:55:39.260 --> 1:55:40.420]  you do in real time.
[1:55:40.420 --> 1:55:43.260]  And they're building all sorts of NSA bases everywhere
[1:55:43.260 --> 1:55:44.740]  with Google built next door.
[1:55:44.740 --> 1:55:46.460]  Google is their front.
[1:55:46.460 --> 1:55:49.060]  Google is so they're not under government oversight.
[1:55:49.060 --> 1:55:50.460]  Google was set up.
[1:55:50.460 --> 1:55:52.740]  Catherine Albrecht getting into how they try to put us
[1:55:52.740 --> 1:55:55.380]  into these reservations and how important it is
[1:55:55.380 --> 1:55:58.260]  to break out of that, to use other search engines
[1:55:58.260 --> 1:56:01.300]  like startpage.com, it's quick.
[1:56:01.300 --> 1:56:05.020]  But whatever you do, just get away from the big guys.
[1:56:05.020 --> 1:56:06.460]  Get away from them now.
[1:56:06.460 --> 1:56:08.860]  What else do we do to fight these people?
[1:56:08.860 --> 1:56:11.020]  Well, I think first we have to understand it
[1:56:11.020 --> 1:56:13.860]  because when I was talking about this Monsanto example,
[1:56:13.860 --> 1:56:15.020]  and if I could just finish the example,
[1:56:15.020 --> 1:56:17.460]  it might clarify some things for some listeners
[1:56:17.460 --> 1:56:19.260]  who may not understand how this works.
[1:56:19.260 --> 1:56:22.940]  If you and my, let's say my father-in-law,
[1:56:22.940 --> 1:56:27.940]  both log on to google.com and you both type in Monsanto GMO
[1:56:28.980 --> 1:56:32.740]  food, you're gonna get page after page after page
[1:56:32.740 --> 1:56:37.060]  of links to like RT.com and, you know,
[1:56:37.060 --> 1:56:40.260]  all these environmentalworkinggroup.com,
[1:56:40.260 --> 1:56:42.260]  all these different groups that are gonna tell you
[1:56:42.260 --> 1:56:46.060]  about how bad the genetic modification is, right?
[1:56:46.060 --> 1:56:47.380]  You've seen them, I've seen them.
[1:56:47.380 --> 1:56:48.820]  Because it knows you're already awake,
[1:56:48.820 --> 1:56:49.940]  so it lets you see that.
[1:56:49.940 --> 1:56:51.580]  Daddy ain't gonna get any of that.
[1:56:51.580 --> 1:56:52.420]  That's right.
[1:56:52.420 --> 1:56:54.900]  Now, when my father-in-law logs on,
[1:56:54.900 --> 1:56:57.180]  he's gonna get a bunch of investment links
[1:56:57.180 --> 1:56:59.540]  that say, hey, Monsanto's stock is up
[1:56:59.540 --> 1:57:02.820]  due to their GMO advancement in Africa.
[1:57:02.820 --> 1:57:06.380]  Or they might get a link that says GMO crops
[1:57:06.380 --> 1:57:10.780]  are breaking new ground and improving health worldwide.
[1:57:10.780 --> 1:57:15.460]  Or GMO crops are praised by ambassadors so and so of,
[1:57:15.460 --> 1:57:16.300]  you know, Monsanto.
[1:57:16.300 --> 1:57:19.020]  The Supreme Court rules in favor of Monsanto today.
[1:57:19.020 --> 1:57:20.060]  They are, yes.
[1:57:20.060 --> 1:57:22.540]  And so what this does, though,
[1:57:22.540 --> 1:57:26.060]  is it creates this notion for us,
[1:57:26.060 --> 1:57:28.340]  and this is really important to understand this,
[1:57:28.340 --> 1:57:30.340]  for those of us who are awake,
[1:57:30.340 --> 1:57:33.060]  it creates the impression that everybody else sees
[1:57:33.060 --> 1:57:36.540]  and knows what we know, but they just don't care.
[1:57:36.540 --> 1:57:39.180]  And so we then say, well, don't you guys care
[1:57:39.180 --> 1:57:40.620]  about what Monsanto's doing?
[1:57:40.620 --> 1:57:41.740]  And they look at you and they're like,
[1:57:41.740 --> 1:57:43.220]  yeah, they're doing GMO stuff.
[1:57:43.220 --> 1:57:44.900]  And you're like, but don't you care?
[1:57:44.900 --> 1:57:46.820]  And they say, no, it's great.
[1:57:46.820 --> 1:57:49.500]  And so because the information they're being fed
[1:57:49.500 --> 1:57:51.340]  is information about how great it is,
[1:57:51.340 --> 1:57:54.180]  oh yeah, they've introduced vitamin B into the rice.
[1:57:54.180 --> 1:57:56.580]  And they do that on YouTube now, run by Google,
[1:57:56.580 --> 1:57:58.260]  and every ad company we use,
[1:57:58.260 --> 1:58:00.980]  Google ends up buying, they're creating this oligopoly,
[1:58:00.980 --> 1:58:01.860]  and you're absolutely right.
[1:58:01.860 --> 1:58:03.820]  That's why you've gotta send links to people.
[1:58:03.820 --> 1:58:06.100]  You've gotta show it to them on your smartphone.
[1:58:06.100 --> 1:58:06.940]  That's great.
[1:58:06.940 --> 1:58:09.340]  You've got to be active, folks.
[1:58:09.340 --> 1:58:11.940]  Don't just fight in the technocracy.
[1:58:11.940 --> 1:58:13.500]  Fight physically.
[1:58:13.500 --> 1:58:15.100]  Because they're ghettoizing us.
[1:58:15.100 --> 1:58:16.740]  And so if they ghettoize you,
[1:58:16.740 --> 1:58:18.780]  and the people that you're trying to reach
[1:58:18.780 --> 1:58:22.260]  are seeing a completely different picture of reality,
[1:58:22.260 --> 1:58:23.980]  then you are not gonna be able to reach them.
[1:58:23.980 --> 1:58:25.300]  You're not gonna be able to talk to them.
[1:58:25.300 --> 1:58:27.740]  And the last thing in the world you gotta say to somebody
[1:58:27.740 --> 1:58:29.620]  is, oh, just Google it.
[1:58:29.620 --> 1:58:34.500]  Now explain how the Romans use ghettos and others.
[1:58:34.500 --> 1:58:38.300]  The ghettoization of Google, the Nazi command base.
[1:58:38.300 --> 1:58:39.140]  Stay with us.
[1:58:39.140 --> 1:58:41.460]  Wow.
[1:58:41.460 --> 1:58:44.900]  You are listening to GCN.

[1:59:07.420 --> 1:59:10.140]  are the 32-ounce nano-silver solutions,
[1:59:10.140 --> 1:59:12.980]  our two-ounce nano-silver nasal applicators,
[1:59:12.980 --> 1:59:16.060]  as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[1:59:16.060 --> 1:59:20.140]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[1:59:20.140 --> 1:59:23.660]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents,
[1:59:23.660 --> 1:59:27.140]  which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[1:59:27.140 --> 1:59:29.740]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel
[1:59:29.740 --> 1:59:32.980]  using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera
[1:59:32.980 --> 1:59:35.540]  to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin
[1:59:35.540 --> 1:59:38.340]  while delivering the silver more effectively.

[2:00:06.100 --> 2:00:10.380]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:10.380 --> 2:00:11.980]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.980 --> 2:00:13.500]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.500 --> 2:00:17.660]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:17.660 --> 2:00:23.860]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:23.860 --> 2:00:25.660]  All right, Katherine Albrecht's been on with us
[2:00:25.660 --> 2:00:27.300]  since he's only scratched on the surface.
[2:00:27.300 --> 2:00:30.580]  I mean, she's a doctor of Harvard studying science,
[2:00:30.580 --> 2:00:32.860]  technology, consumer affairs.
[2:00:32.860 --> 2:00:34.780]  And it is a revolution against humanity.
[2:00:34.780 --> 2:00:38.340]  Technology is an incredibly empowering thing.
[2:00:38.340 --> 2:00:41.980]  Like a gun can be used to hunt, protect yourself, whatever.
[2:00:41.980 --> 2:00:45.020]  But in the hands of bad guys, it's super bad.
[2:00:45.020 --> 2:00:46.580]  Well, this makes guns look tame.
[2:00:46.580 --> 2:00:48.700]  This makes bio weapons look tame
[2:00:48.700 --> 2:00:50.340]  because they're able to track humans,
[2:00:50.340 --> 2:00:52.140]  study humans and control us.
[2:00:52.140 --> 2:00:55.060]  The globalists see themselves as a breakaway society
[2:00:55.060 --> 2:00:59.140]  and they're creating these internet ghettos the last year
[2:00:59.140 --> 2:01:02.940]  where they're killing the viral spread of liberty messages
[2:01:02.940 --> 2:01:06.860]  by only serving you your own YouTube videos.
[2:01:06.860 --> 2:01:08.580]  I mean, I could tell my wife did a few searches
[2:01:08.580 --> 2:01:10.660]  on the computer in our bedroom on tap dancing.
[2:01:10.660 --> 2:01:13.380]  She likes to dance tango, tap dancing.
[2:01:13.380 --> 2:01:14.780]  She does it all.
[2:01:14.780 --> 2:01:17.500]  And now, you know, I'm on there and it's tap dancing stuff
[2:01:17.500 --> 2:01:20.420]  everywhere instead of just anti-New World Order stuff.
[2:01:20.420 --> 2:01:22.980]  Now, I do such wide searches that mine isn't as bad,
[2:01:22.980 --> 2:01:26.900]  that I go to family's houses or I get other people's computers
[2:01:26.900 --> 2:01:29.620]  and you can see also what they're into.
[2:01:29.620 --> 2:01:31.780]  And again, that is trying to keep,
[2:01:31.780 --> 2:01:33.500]  this is an ancient tactic.
[2:01:33.500 --> 2:01:35.980]  Catherine Albert in closing, explain this to people.
[2:01:35.980 --> 2:01:37.500]  CatherineAlbert.com.
[2:01:37.500 --> 2:01:40.700]  Yeah, so it's critical that people understand this
[2:01:40.700 --> 2:01:42.940]  because they're using the tools that we think
[2:01:42.940 --> 2:01:45.220]  open up our vistas to really close them.
[2:01:45.220 --> 2:01:47.260]  And you've mentioned StartPage,
[2:01:47.260 --> 2:01:50.300]  which is the private search engine that I have to develop
[2:01:50.300 --> 2:01:52.180]  that lets you get to Google results
[2:01:52.180 --> 2:01:55.180]  without actually being tracked and monitored by Google.
[2:01:55.180 --> 2:01:56.780]  And it breaks you out of the filter bubble
[2:01:56.780 --> 2:01:58.140]  because when you go to StartPage,
[2:01:58.140 --> 2:02:00.140]  let's say you search for Monsanto,
[2:02:00.140 --> 2:02:03.780]  we give you just the generic Monsanto results
[2:02:03.780 --> 2:02:05.620]  because they don't have your tracking cookies
[2:02:05.620 --> 2:02:07.060]  and your history, they don't even know who you are.
[2:02:07.060 --> 2:02:09.260]  So they have to just serve you the generic results.
[2:02:09.260 --> 2:02:12.220]  So sometimes it's interesting just experimentally
[2:02:12.220 --> 2:02:13.820]  to go and see what does Google consider
[2:02:13.820 --> 2:02:16.500]  to be the generic results on TopicX.
[2:02:16.500 --> 2:02:18.740]  And remember, even if you turn Google off
[2:02:18.740 --> 2:02:20.580]  and say don't have cookies,
[2:02:20.580 --> 2:02:22.140]  they break that on record.
[2:02:22.140 --> 2:02:24.420]  And I mean, this is a criminal group.
[2:02:24.420 --> 2:02:25.700]  Yeah, no, it's wild.
[2:02:25.700 --> 2:02:26.860]  And this is what they do.
[2:02:26.860 --> 2:02:28.580]  They figure out ways to get more information
[2:02:28.580 --> 2:02:30.380]  than you know that they're getting.
[2:02:30.380 --> 2:02:32.060]  I mean, that's what they're brilliant at.
[2:02:32.060 --> 2:02:33.740]  But the other thing I want to remind people,
[2:02:33.740 --> 2:02:35.060]  and we don't talk about it very often
[2:02:35.060 --> 2:02:36.820]  when I come on the show, but ixquik,
[2:02:36.820 --> 2:02:40.180]  which is I-X-Q-U-I-C-K, ixquik.com,
[2:02:40.180 --> 2:02:43.860]  returns search results from everybody but Google.
[2:02:43.860 --> 2:02:46.020]  And the reason I really like ixquik
[2:02:46.020 --> 2:02:47.900]  is that there's times when you know
[2:02:47.900 --> 2:02:49.980]  that you're not getting the result you should be getting
[2:02:49.980 --> 2:02:51.260]  or you're not being told something
[2:02:51.260 --> 2:02:52.540]  you should be getting told.
[2:02:52.540 --> 2:02:54.740]  And if you look on Google, you don't find it
[2:02:54.740 --> 2:02:56.220]  because they know your history.
[2:02:56.220 --> 2:02:58.540]  You go to star page, you don't find it potentially
[2:02:58.540 --> 2:03:00.500]  because star page is giving you Google results
[2:03:00.500 --> 2:03:01.580]  which we get from Google.
[2:03:01.580 --> 2:03:03.300]  We just strip out the privacy staff,
[2:03:03.300 --> 2:03:05.740]  but we're giving you a straight feed from them.
[2:03:05.740 --> 2:03:09.020]  And then if you're not finding it still, go to ixquik.
[2:03:09.020 --> 2:03:11.060]  And I found an incredible result.
[2:03:11.060 --> 2:03:13.620]  When I go to ixquik.com and I search for something
[2:03:13.620 --> 2:03:15.620]  that I'm just not finding, all of a sudden I get
[2:03:15.620 --> 2:03:17.020]  all these links and results
[2:03:17.020 --> 2:03:19.140]  like the whole first page is different.
[2:03:19.140 --> 2:03:21.220]  And I'm like, where is all this stuff been all my life?
[2:03:21.220 --> 2:03:22.740]  Like where was this hiding?
[2:03:22.740 --> 2:03:25.540]  So I would encourage people to, first of all,
[2:03:25.540 --> 2:03:27.620]  stop, you know, pull the Google needle out of your arm,
[2:03:27.620 --> 2:03:29.220]  switch to start page as your homepage
[2:03:29.220 --> 2:03:30.820]  if you like the Google results.
[2:03:30.820 --> 2:03:32.460]  And then when you really want to go deeper,
[2:03:32.460 --> 2:03:34.300]  go to ixquik or make it your homepage.
[2:03:34.300 --> 2:03:35.740]  They're both great.
[2:03:35.740 --> 2:03:37.500]  The other thing I want to tell people is
[2:03:37.500 --> 2:03:42.060]  we have start mail is now in internal beta testing.
[2:03:42.060 --> 2:03:43.980]  We're about to get you your free account, Alex.
[2:03:43.980 --> 2:03:44.820]  I can't wait.
[2:03:44.820 --> 2:03:46.820]  I'm so excited because fully encrypted,
[2:03:46.820 --> 2:03:47.940]  we're talking off the chart.
[2:03:47.940 --> 2:03:50.500]  Nobody, even us can read anything
[2:03:50.500 --> 2:03:51.700]  that you write through start mail.
[2:03:51.700 --> 2:03:53.140]  So all these people out here who are like,
[2:03:53.140 --> 2:03:54.380]  well, thanks, Catherine.
[2:03:54.380 --> 2:03:57.020]  You just told me my Yahoo account's gonna get read
[2:03:57.020 --> 2:03:58.180]  and my Gmail's getting read.
[2:03:58.180 --> 2:04:00.940]  So what the heck are you gonna propose as a solution?
[2:04:00.940 --> 2:04:01.900]  We're building it.
[2:04:01.900 --> 2:04:02.860]  It's built.
[2:04:02.860 --> 2:04:04.500]  It's startmail.com.
[2:04:04.500 --> 2:04:05.940]  There's a place on there where people,
[2:04:05.940 --> 2:04:08.180]  Alex Jones listeners can go and sign up
[2:04:08.180 --> 2:04:09.660]  as beta testers on there.
[2:04:09.660 --> 2:04:11.300]  And it is, it's done.
[2:04:11.300 --> 2:04:12.740]  It's made, it's here.
[2:04:12.740 --> 2:04:13.740]  I'm so excited.
[2:04:13.740 --> 2:04:15.460]  I've been testing it out, kicking the chires.
[2:04:15.460 --> 2:04:16.300]  I love it.
[2:04:16.300 --> 2:04:18.020]  And we're talking about a user bulk
[2:04:18.020 --> 2:04:19.500]  that is so well encrypted.
[2:04:19.500 --> 2:04:22.180]  As I said, even we cannot read the email
[2:04:22.180 --> 2:04:24.300]  of people who send email in our system.
[2:04:24.300 --> 2:04:25.900]  And that's the kind of thing we need to see,
[2:04:25.900 --> 2:04:29.700]  not just in search engines, like StartPage and Xquik
[2:04:29.700 --> 2:04:32.340]  and StartMail, but we need to see it in everything.
[2:04:32.340 --> 2:04:33.180]  Absolutely.
[2:04:33.180 --> 2:04:36.180]  Google is trying to shut down the real alternative media.
[2:04:36.180 --> 2:04:38.900]  We have to have an exodus away from all their systems
[2:04:38.900 --> 2:04:40.620]  as much as we can.
[2:04:40.620 --> 2:04:42.660]  They're like half the web now, so it's hard.
[2:04:42.660 --> 2:04:45.260]  So that we build alternatives to them
[2:04:45.260 --> 2:04:47.460]  that they are forcing us.
[2:04:47.460 --> 2:04:49.420]  Necessity is the mother of invention.
[2:04:49.420 --> 2:04:52.180]  Katherine Albrecht will talk to you again very, very soon.
[2:04:52.180 --> 2:04:53.060]  Thank you so much.
[2:04:53.060 --> 2:04:53.820]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:04:53.820 --> 2:04:54.540]  Always a pleasure.
[2:04:54.540 --> 2:04:55.860]  Always a pleasure having you.
[2:04:55.860 --> 2:04:57.620]  All right, we got Richard Bells are coming up,
[2:04:57.620 --> 2:04:59.380]  and I'm going to recap the top stories
[2:04:59.380 --> 2:05:00.940]  and hit some breaking news.
[2:05:00.940 --> 2:05:02.900]  In the last two years alone, the US
[2:05:02.900 --> 2:05:05.020]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[2:05:05.020 --> 2:05:08.500]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the US,
[2:05:08.500 --> 2:05:10.740]  costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[2:05:10.740 --> 2:05:13.420]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country
[2:05:13.420 --> 2:05:14.780]  in more than 50 years.
[2:05:14.780 --> 2:05:16.860]  You may think out of sight out of mind,
[2:05:16.860 --> 2:05:18.700]  and so you don't think you will be affected.
[2:05:18.700 --> 2:05:20.100]  The fact is, you are.
[2:05:20.100 --> 2:05:21.100]  We all are.
[2:05:21.100 --> 2:05:23.780]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[2:05:23.780 --> 2:05:25.940]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature,
[2:05:25.940 --> 2:05:28.060]  but you can control your food prices
[2:05:28.060 --> 2:05:30.700]  by freezing the cost and availability of your food
[2:05:30.700 --> 2:05:32.340]  supply with eFoodsDirect.
[2:05:32.340 --> 2:05:33.700]  Be prepared before you need it.
[2:05:33.700 --> 2:05:37.180]  With nutrient-dense food, you can store for up to 25 years.
[2:05:37.180 --> 2:05:39.580]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[2:05:39.580 --> 2:05:41.540]  Do what I've done and get your own supply
[2:05:41.540 --> 2:05:44.100]  of the best horrible foods out there from eFoodsDirect.

[2:06:19.860 --> 2:06:22.740]  more effective than colloidal or ionic silver
[2:06:22.740 --> 2:06:26.140]  and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.
[2:06:26.140 --> 2:06:29.380]  Supernatural silver is scientifically supported,
[2:06:29.380 --> 2:06:32.060]  highly effective, and perfect for everyday use
[2:06:32.060 --> 2:06:33.940]  inside the body as well as out.
[2:06:33.940 --> 2:06:36.340]  The science digest journal says silver
[2:06:36.340 --> 2:06:38.340]  is our mightiest germ fighter.
[2:06:38.340 --> 2:06:40.740]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging
[2:06:40.740 --> 2:06:42.580]  as a wonder of modern medicine.
[2:06:42.580 --> 2:06:46.580]  Supernatural silver is the number one choice of thousands

[2:08:00.100 --> 2:08:08.100]  It began with the forging of the great rings.
[2:08:08.100 --> 2:08:12.100]  Three were given to the elves, immortal, wisest,
[2:08:12.100 --> 2:08:14.100]  and fairest of all beings.
[2:08:14.100 --> 2:08:19.100]  Seven to the dwarf lords, great miners,
[2:08:19.100 --> 2:08:22.100]  and craftsmen of the mountain halls.
[2:08:22.100 --> 2:08:27.100]  Seven to the dwarf lords, great miners,
[2:08:27.100 --> 2:08:31.100]  and craftsmen of the mountain halls.
[2:08:31.100 --> 2:08:35.100]  And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men
[2:08:35.100 --> 2:08:41.100]  who, above all else, desire power.
[2:08:41.100 --> 2:08:43.100]  For within these rings was bound the strength
[2:08:43.100 --> 2:08:47.100]  and will to govern each race.
[2:08:47.100 --> 2:08:51.100]  But they were all of them deceived,
[2:08:51.100 --> 2:08:54.100]  for another ring was made.
[2:08:54.100 --> 2:08:58.100]  In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom,
[2:08:58.100 --> 2:09:01.100]  the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret
[2:09:01.100 --> 2:09:05.100]  a master ring to control all others.
[2:09:05.100 --> 2:09:08.100]  And into this ring he poured his cruelty,
[2:09:08.100 --> 2:09:14.100]  his malice, and his will to dominate all life.
[2:09:14.100 --> 2:09:25.100]  One ring to rule them all.
[2:09:45.100 --> 2:09:52.100]  Ever staring, a lidless eye wreathed in flame.
[2:09:52.100 --> 2:09:54.100]  It knows all your medical conditions,
[2:09:54.100 --> 2:09:56.100]  your history, where you eat,
[2:09:56.100 --> 2:09:59.100]  what size and color underwear your wife wears,
[2:09:59.100 --> 2:10:02.100]  what type of sex you're into.
[2:10:02.100 --> 2:10:04.100]  But you can trust the Bilderberg grip
[2:10:04.100 --> 2:10:06.100]  that created Google and runs it.
[2:10:06.100 --> 2:10:10.100]  You can trust them all to have your data.
[2:10:10.100 --> 2:10:12.100]  You can trust your child to be raised
[2:10:12.100 --> 2:10:16.100]  by the smartphone built in Chinese slave grids.
[2:10:16.100 --> 2:10:19.100]  You can trust the New World Order
[2:10:19.100 --> 2:10:22.100]  to put you in a technotronic ghetto
[2:10:22.100 --> 2:10:24.100]  and destroy your mind.
[2:10:24.100 --> 2:10:26.100]  And you can trust Bill Gates
[2:10:26.100 --> 2:10:30.100]  to take all the vaccines he has for you and your family.
[2:10:30.100 --> 2:10:34.100]  You can trust Monsanto with Bill Gates on the board
[2:10:34.100 --> 2:10:36.100]  with the great food they produce
[2:10:36.100 --> 2:10:38.100]  that kills the rodents that are fed it
[2:10:38.100 --> 2:10:40.100]  and the honeybees that eat it.
[2:10:40.100 --> 2:10:43.100]  You can trust the New World Order
[2:10:43.100 --> 2:10:47.100]  because it's come to bring you life and prosperity.
[2:10:47.100 --> 2:10:51.100]  So drink deep from the sodium hydrofluorosilic acid
[2:10:51.100 --> 2:10:53.100]  that comes out of your temp water.
[2:10:53.100 --> 2:10:56.100]  Don't read the Harvard study about it lowering your IQ
[2:10:56.100 --> 2:11:00.100]  and fertility and seven-fold increase in bone cancer
[2:11:00.100 --> 2:11:02.100]  and kidney cancer.
[2:11:02.100 --> 2:11:07.100]  Drink deeply from the delicious water of life
[2:11:07.100 --> 2:11:11.100]  given to you by your loving world government.
[2:11:11.100 --> 2:11:13.100]  And when you say a prayer at night,
[2:11:13.100 --> 2:11:19.100]  thank Google and thank the IRS for spying on you
[2:11:19.100 --> 2:11:23.100]  and using the data to persecute American scum
[2:11:23.100 --> 2:11:25.100]  that promote the Constitution.
[2:11:25.100 --> 2:11:28.100]  And thank the government God
[2:11:28.100 --> 2:11:31.100]  that it's training that homeschoolers are terrorists
[2:11:31.100 --> 2:11:33.100]  and drills nationwide.
[2:11:33.100 --> 2:11:37.100]  Kneel before the great all-seeing eyes of Google.
[2:11:37.100 --> 2:11:39.100]  Ever-watching.
[2:11:39.100 --> 2:11:42.100]  Ever-chronically.
[2:11:42.100 --> 2:11:44.100]  Ever-tracking.
[2:11:46.100 --> 2:11:49.100]  And I think you should go out to known criminal groups
[2:11:49.100 --> 2:11:51.100]  and give them your credit card numbers and everything else
[2:11:51.100 --> 2:11:54.100]  and tell them when you're going to be home and when you're not.
[2:11:54.100 --> 2:11:56.100]  We should just publish all that.
[2:11:56.100 --> 2:11:59.100]  Look at how common criminals use Facebook to rob people.
[2:11:59.100 --> 2:12:02.100]  When you go look at all our new Christmas stuff
[2:12:02.100 --> 2:12:05.100]  and today, woo-hoo, we're going to Cancun.
[2:12:05.100 --> 2:12:07.100]  We're going to be gone for a week.
[2:12:07.100 --> 2:12:10.100]  And then they find out off the data on the photos
[2:12:10.100 --> 2:12:13.100]  where you live that do location pinning.
[2:12:13.100 --> 2:12:16.100]  It's meant for big brother, but other criminals can use it.
[2:12:16.100 --> 2:12:19.100]  And then they rob your house.
[2:12:19.100 --> 2:12:21.100]  Yeah!
[2:12:21.100 --> 2:12:24.100]  What do you got to hide, baby?
[2:12:25.100 --> 2:12:27.100]  The last time he was on with us,
[2:12:27.100 --> 2:12:30.100]  the time before last, we were talking about spy grids
[2:12:30.100 --> 2:12:34.100]  and all of a sudden, into the view came Christopher Walken.
[2:12:34.100 --> 2:12:37.100]  No, I'm not joking, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:12:37.100 --> 2:12:40.100]  Sauntering into view came Christopher Walken
[2:12:40.100 --> 2:12:43.100]  like an angel flapping down from heaven
[2:12:43.100 --> 2:12:47.100]  to give us red wine and chicken recipes.
[2:12:47.100 --> 2:12:51.100]  And he was there and he pointed out he has no computers in his house,
[2:12:51.100 --> 2:12:53.100]  no cell phones, no nothing.
[2:12:53.100 --> 2:12:56.100]  And I realized the only way in the future to do that is to have that.
[2:12:56.100 --> 2:12:58.100]  But you wouldn't be able to buy a washing machine in the future
[2:12:58.100 --> 2:13:01.100]  that doesn't have spy tech hooked into the smart meter,
[2:13:01.100 --> 2:13:05.100]  listening and watching and tracking everything you do.
[2:13:05.100 --> 2:13:09.100]  Oh, the government loves you and your children.
[2:13:09.100 --> 2:13:13.100]  And your little dog too, of course.
[2:13:13.100 --> 2:13:15.100]  Just ask Diane Feinstein.
[2:13:15.100 --> 2:13:17.100]  And Reno.
[2:13:17.100 --> 2:13:22.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have huge breaking Google news up on infowars.com.
[2:13:22.100 --> 2:13:24.100]  They are becoming Bilderberg,
[2:13:24.100 --> 2:13:29.100]  the passing of the torch of Satanic Prometheus, of anti Prometheus,
[2:13:29.100 --> 2:13:32.100]  is being transferred right now.
[2:13:32.100 --> 2:13:35.100]  UK newspaper creates illegal 3D guns,
[2:13:35.100 --> 2:13:40.100]  sneaks it onto trains and aircraft so they can demonize it.
[2:13:40.100 --> 2:13:41.100]  That's all breaking.
[2:13:41.100 --> 2:13:46.100]  Bilderberg 2.0, the new technocratic construct in the works.
[2:13:46.100 --> 2:13:50.100]  France's socialist government moves to impose smartphone tax.
[2:13:50.100 --> 2:13:56.100]  Global Berg, global elite, transforms itself for technocratic revolution.
[2:13:56.100 --> 2:14:01.100]  That's the big breaking story with videos and photos of the Google complex
[2:14:01.100 --> 2:14:04.100]  at a former OSS spy base.
[2:14:04.100 --> 2:14:09.100]  US consumers can blame Walmart for the new online sales tax when it passes.
[2:14:09.100 --> 2:14:14.100]  FEMA to stage massive drill at Pennsylvania amusement park today.
[2:14:14.100 --> 2:14:16.100]  That's on the left-hand side of drugsreport.com.
[2:14:16.100 --> 2:14:19.100]  Also at infowars.com.
[2:14:19.100 --> 2:14:23.100]  Washington Post blames gangland shooting on Second Amendment.
[2:14:23.100 --> 2:14:24.100]  I predicted it'd be gangland.
[2:14:24.100 --> 2:14:26.100]  Indeed, that's what it was.
[2:14:26.100 --> 2:14:28.100]  By the way, Watson should probably add the fact that they admit
[2:14:28.100 --> 2:14:32.100]  woundings from guns down 69% since 93.
[2:14:32.100 --> 2:14:34.100]  Guests from guns down 39%.
[2:14:34.100 --> 2:14:36.100]  Violent crime down 49%.
[2:14:36.100 --> 2:14:40.100]  The main factor, just departments own numbers, gun ownership increasing.
[2:14:40.100 --> 2:14:44.100]  But the average American believes that there is more gun crime
[2:14:44.100 --> 2:14:47.100]  than there ever has been because of perception.
[2:14:47.100 --> 2:14:50.100]  Just like you have the perception that Google's not evil
[2:14:50.100 --> 2:14:53.100]  because they got pretty colors and say they're not evil.
[2:14:53.100 --> 2:14:57.100]  And they have a campus with guys that drink beer and play ping-pong
[2:14:57.100 --> 2:14:59.100]  and have socks that don't match.
[2:14:59.100 --> 2:15:03.100]  And they got Hollywood movies coming out about how, you know,
[2:15:03.100 --> 2:15:06.100]  you go and you join the Google team.
[2:15:06.100 --> 2:15:10.100]  I mean, what bull?
[2:15:10.100 --> 2:15:14.100]  I'm convinced if Hitler would have worn rainbow uniforms
[2:15:14.100 --> 2:15:17.100]  and handed kids teddy bears before they shot them in the head.
[2:15:17.100 --> 2:15:19.100]  I'm not being sarcastic.
[2:15:19.100 --> 2:15:21.100]  Our media would have saluted them and said,
[2:15:21.100 --> 2:15:24.100]  how dare you not love Hitler?
[2:15:24.100 --> 2:15:27.100]  If Stalin would have worn maybe a pink uniform
[2:15:27.100 --> 2:15:31.100]  and walked around like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[2:15:31.100 --> 2:15:34.100]  Then everything would be fine because I'm telling you,
[2:15:34.100 --> 2:15:39.100]  if a tank ran up to your house and had like lucky charms colors on it
[2:15:39.100 --> 2:15:42.100]  and like, and if the military dressed like leprechauns
[2:15:42.100 --> 2:15:45.100]  and showed up at your house and said, bring your children out,
[2:15:45.100 --> 2:15:47.100]  line them up, we're going to shoot them.
[2:15:47.100 --> 2:15:49.100]  Parents would come out and kill their children in front of them.
[2:15:49.100 --> 2:15:52.100]  I'm not kidding. I mean, it's incredible.
[2:15:52.100 --> 2:15:56.100]  As long as Eric Schmidt, okay, I'm having a moment.
[2:15:56.100 --> 2:15:58.100]  I'm going to stop right now.
[2:15:58.100 --> 2:16:00.100]  See, this stuff crashes in on me, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:16:00.100 --> 2:16:03.100]  It really crashes in on me and it's absurdist.
[2:16:03.100 --> 2:16:06.100]  Reality is absurdist, so I start getting absurdist
[2:16:06.100 --> 2:16:07.100]  and I'm out of control.
[2:16:07.100 --> 2:16:09.100]  I got all this news coming up this hour.
[2:16:09.100 --> 2:16:13.100]  I've got just, this is serious.
[2:16:13.100 --> 2:16:16.100]  I've got drills all over the country.
[2:16:16.100 --> 2:16:21.100]  We're homeschoolers where they have drills where people attack the public school
[2:16:21.100 --> 2:16:24.100]  and they'll come in with guns and point them at seven-year-old kids
[2:16:24.100 --> 2:16:25.100]  and say, we're going to kill you.
[2:16:25.100 --> 2:16:28.100]  We're homeschoolers against the federal government.
[2:16:28.100 --> 2:16:31.100]  In Michigan, you name it, and then the parents freak out
[2:16:31.100 --> 2:16:34.100]  and they go, oh, sorry, it's a federal grant to do this.
[2:16:34.100 --> 2:16:36.100]  They just had another one last week unannounced
[2:16:36.100 --> 2:16:38.100]  and I'm not just saying this for effect.
[2:16:38.100 --> 2:16:41.100]  It's true with people going to the bathroom in their pants
[2:16:41.100 --> 2:16:44.100]  when men come in and say, we're going to kill you
[2:16:44.100 --> 2:16:49.100]  and they engage in massive reeducation camp behavior in America.
[2:16:49.100 --> 2:16:53.100]  The schools are reeducation camps.
[2:16:53.100 --> 2:16:59.100]  Richard Belzer, of course, is a researcher and his author
[2:16:59.100 --> 2:17:01.100]  before he became a movie star and TV star.
[2:17:01.100 --> 2:17:06.100]  And belzerbook.com, iBels.com, his new book,
[2:17:06.100 --> 2:17:08.100]  one of the New York Times bestseller list,
[2:17:08.100 --> 2:17:10.100]  and I think it's the best JFK book out in over a decade,
[2:17:10.100 --> 2:17:13.100]  because it chronicles all the witnesses that were killed to cover it up.
[2:17:13.100 --> 2:17:15.100]  And that's the real proof of what happened,
[2:17:15.100 --> 2:17:17.100]  but we're not so much getting into that today.
[2:17:17.100 --> 2:17:20.100]  He was on with us for like an hour and a half extended overdrive interview.
[2:17:20.100 --> 2:17:22.100]  He's always got to guess late.
[2:17:22.100 --> 2:17:24.100]  I want guests that also want to be able to talk,
[2:17:24.100 --> 2:17:26.100]  so it kind of split it up.
[2:17:26.100 --> 2:17:28.100]  And he was there when the bombing happened
[2:17:28.100 --> 2:17:30.100]  and we basically predicted everything that would then unfold,
[2:17:30.100 --> 2:17:34.100]  that there'd be drills, that the Patsy's would be connected to the NSA and CIA,
[2:17:34.100 --> 2:17:38.100]  all of it, but who would know that we would route the story so quickly
[2:17:38.100 --> 2:17:40.100]  and it would blow up in spectacular fashion.
[2:17:40.100 --> 2:17:42.100]  So you've heard my Google ranting.
[2:17:42.100 --> 2:17:45.100]  You've heard all of it coming out here.
[2:17:45.100 --> 2:17:47.100]  I am in overload.
[2:17:47.100 --> 2:17:49.100]  I mean, my brain has already been rewired, man,
[2:17:49.100 --> 2:17:52.100]  and let me tell you, it's wired against this stuff.
[2:17:52.100 --> 2:17:55.100]  A lot of people get rewired to submit to the tyranny.
[2:17:55.100 --> 2:17:58.100]  I'm wired into the tyranny, but it's like torture,
[2:17:58.100 --> 2:18:01.100]  you know, pain amplifiers or something.
[2:18:01.100 --> 2:18:06.100]  But it's not really like a pain, it's more of an enraged aphrodisiac
[2:18:06.100 --> 2:18:10.100]  of like a caged animal struggling against his incineration.
[2:18:10.100 --> 2:18:12.100]  Do you see what I'm saying, Richard Belzer?
[2:18:12.100 --> 2:18:14.100]  I see exactly what you're saying.
[2:18:14.100 --> 2:18:19.100]  The synaptic aspects of our brain are being overloaded with information
[2:18:19.100 --> 2:18:24.100]  that people like you and I have known for a long time
[2:18:24.100 --> 2:18:27.100]  and were frustrated when we try to tell other people,
[2:18:27.100 --> 2:18:31.100]  I've been censored for years, Alex, I can't tell you how.
[2:18:31.100 --> 2:18:34.100]  I've had plugs pulled on me and I was taken off panels.
[2:18:34.100 --> 2:18:37.100]  You've been talking about this stuff since the 70s.
[2:18:37.100 --> 2:18:39.100]  Yeah, you know, it's interesting.
[2:18:39.100 --> 2:18:42.100]  Your last guest made a very chilling astute observation
[2:18:42.100 --> 2:18:47.100]  about how a different age group is fed different information.
[2:18:47.100 --> 2:18:52.100]  Like her father would not know that Monsanto was the devil,
[2:18:52.100 --> 2:18:56.100]  but younger people who are more tech savvy are more into that.
[2:18:56.100 --> 2:18:58.100]  So they give them their information.
[2:18:58.100 --> 2:19:02.100]  That is really starting to get scary.
[2:19:02.100 --> 2:19:05.100]  In the 1950s, our government in the 50s
[2:19:05.100 --> 2:19:08.100]  had a thing called Operation Mockingbird.
[2:19:08.100 --> 2:19:12.100]  They were already working on looking at us through televisions.
[2:19:12.100 --> 2:19:14.100]  And that was cathode ray tubes.
[2:19:14.100 --> 2:19:18.100]  Now, of course, you know, they could see us when our TVs are off.
[2:19:18.100 --> 2:19:21.100]  Now they just hide the camera in plain view.
[2:19:21.100 --> 2:19:24.100]  Yeah, and you said before, you know, Hitler wore flowers.
[2:19:24.100 --> 2:19:28.100]  You know, Hitler didn't have to wear flowers for the bankers
[2:19:28.100 --> 2:19:32.100]  in the United States and the Haramans and Prescott Bush
[2:19:32.100 --> 2:19:36.100]  and John Kennedy's father and the Duponts.
[2:19:36.100 --> 2:19:38.100]  You know, Hitler declared war on us.
[2:19:38.100 --> 2:19:40.100]  We didn't declare war on Germany.
[2:19:40.100 --> 2:19:44.100]  I have nightmares wondering how long we would have waited
[2:19:44.100 --> 2:19:46.100]  before we declared war on Hitler.
[2:19:46.100 --> 2:19:48.100]  I mean, he was in Paris in 1940.
[2:19:48.100 --> 2:19:50.100]  We still weren't at war with them.
[2:19:50.100 --> 2:19:52.100]  We were helping Hitler throughout the war.
[2:19:52.100 --> 2:19:55.100]  I want to talk about that when we come back as we've written about it.
[2:19:55.100 --> 2:19:58.100]  It's on record, but also it shows the normalcy bias.
[2:19:58.100 --> 2:20:24.100]  We're faced by our own Hitler today.

[2:21:01.100 --> 2:21:04.100]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book,
[2:21:04.100 --> 2:21:06.100]  Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[2:21:06.100 --> 2:21:09.100]  I want you to know some very important information.
[2:21:09.100 --> 2:21:13.100]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent
[2:21:13.100 --> 2:21:16.100]  directly to the White House at a time when only the president
[2:21:16.100 --> 2:21:18.100]  could obtain this world-class healer.
[2:21:18.100 --> 2:21:22.100]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world
[2:21:22.100 --> 2:21:24.100]  to keep people healthy.
[2:21:24.100 --> 2:21:27.100]  Now, you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs
[2:21:27.100 --> 2:21:31.100]  with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond
[2:21:31.100 --> 2:21:35.100]  to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[2:21:35.100 --> 2:21:38.100]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up
[2:21:38.100 --> 2:21:42.100]  your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[2:21:42.100 --> 2:21:47.100]  Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com.
[2:21:47.100 --> 2:21:54.100]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.
[2:21:54.100 --> 2:21:58.100]  Protect your immune system. It's the only one you've got.
[2:21:58.100 --> 2:22:02.100]  There is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[2:22:02.100 --> 2:22:05.100]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs
[2:22:05.100 --> 2:22:09.100]  by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[2:22:09.100 --> 2:22:14.100]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce nano-silver solutions,
[2:22:14.100 --> 2:22:17.100]  our two-ounce nano-silver nasal applicators,
[2:22:17.100 --> 2:22:20.100]  as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[2:22:20.100 --> 2:22:24.100]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[2:22:24.100 --> 2:22:28.100]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents,
[2:22:28.100 --> 2:22:32.100]  which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[2:22:32.100 --> 2:22:35.100]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel
[2:22:35.100 --> 2:22:38.100]  using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera
[2:22:38.100 --> 2:22:41.100]  to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin
[2:22:41.100 --> 2:22:44.100]  while delivering the silver more effectively.
[2:22:44.100 --> 2:22:48.100]  Visit www.silverlungs.com
[2:22:48.100 --> 2:22:50.100]  and click on our store page
[2:22:50.100 --> 2:22:53.100]  to find what silver-based products are best for you.
[2:22:53.100 --> 2:23:12.100]  That's www.silverlungs.com
[2:23:23.100 --> 2:23:33.100]  www.silverlungs.com
[2:23:53.100 --> 2:24:01.100]  www.silverlungs.com
[2:24:24.100 --> 2:24:28.100]  I mean, I covered the fact that the West funded Hitler 18 years ago
[2:24:28.100 --> 2:24:31.100]  when I first got on air, Anthony Sutton was really the first to expose it
[2:24:31.100 --> 2:24:34.100]  because he was able to get into congressional files.
[2:24:34.100 --> 2:24:37.100]  But there were a lot of bomber pilots
[2:24:37.100 --> 2:24:42.100]  who complained over the fact they couldn't bomb Ford and General Motor factories
[2:24:42.100 --> 2:24:44.100]  all over Germany.
[2:24:44.100 --> 2:24:48.100]  And so they would fly and bomb the same factory over and over again
[2:24:48.100 --> 2:24:51.100]  that was already destroyed, but they couldn't bomb these others.
[2:24:51.100 --> 2:24:55.100]  And back at the time, it was called Rumors.
[2:24:55.100 --> 2:24:59.100]  And it just shows how even as the war went, the West was making money off of it.
[2:24:59.100 --> 2:25:02.100]  Just like the globalist fund Al Qaeda,
[2:25:02.100 --> 2:25:05.100]  but then also said we've got to give our rights up because of Al Qaeda.
[2:25:05.100 --> 2:25:08.100]  Richard Belzer, you've gone off into that area, author Richard Belzer.
[2:25:08.100 --> 2:25:11.100]  I want to get back into the Boston bombing with you, the book,
[2:25:11.100 --> 2:25:16.100]  all the IRS spying on groups that promote the Constitution.
[2:25:16.100 --> 2:25:19.100]  It's like, oh, it's not just the Tea Party or Libertarians.
[2:25:19.100 --> 2:25:22.100]  It's if you promote the Constitution, we're coming after you.
[2:25:22.100 --> 2:25:24.100]  I mean, that is absurdist.
[2:25:24.100 --> 2:25:27.100]  That's exactly what bad guys would do.
[2:25:27.100 --> 2:25:30.100]  Actually repellent and sickening.
[2:25:30.100 --> 2:25:34.100]  You know, there was a play by T.S. Eliot called Murder in the Cathedral
[2:25:34.100 --> 2:25:40.100]  where the king wanted to get rid of the bishop who was in his way.
[2:25:40.100 --> 2:25:44.100]  And he said, who will rid me of this priest?
[2:25:44.100 --> 2:25:50.100]  So like he didn't say kill the priest, but of course his underlings killed Beckett.
[2:25:50.100 --> 2:25:55.100]  And now the president or whoever, let's say anyone up there can say,
[2:25:55.100 --> 2:26:00.100]  who will rid me of this group, whether it's left or right?
[2:26:00.100 --> 2:26:04.100]  It's ironic that they want to suppress patriotism.
[2:26:04.100 --> 2:26:06.100]  That's really chilling.
[2:26:06.100 --> 2:26:08.100]  So it's like now they have the IRS.
[2:26:08.100 --> 2:26:11.100]  They don't have to kill you or poison you.
[2:26:11.100 --> 2:26:14.100]  They can, you know, like Nixon had an enemies list.
[2:26:14.100 --> 2:26:20.100]  Every president can use this chilling device, which is probably illegal anyway.
[2:26:20.100 --> 2:26:23.100]  IRS is probably technically extortion anyway.
[2:26:23.100 --> 2:26:29.100]  But to use it as a threat, even if it wasn't Obama,
[2:26:29.100 --> 2:26:33.100]  it's people within his administration of a like mind.
[2:26:33.100 --> 2:26:37.100]  So, you know, it's really scary.
[2:26:37.100 --> 2:26:42.100]  I mean, I know you and I have seen a lot in our day and we seem to be a little bit ahead of the curve.
[2:26:42.100 --> 2:26:46.100]  But since the Boston bombing, the constellation of events,
[2:26:46.100 --> 2:26:50.100]  and the Googleization of the Bilderbergers,
[2:26:50.100 --> 2:26:58.100]  and the parsing of information to various age and demographic groups through computers,
[2:26:58.100 --> 2:27:01.100]  is we, you know, you saw Oblivion, right?
[2:27:01.100 --> 2:27:02.100]  Yes.
[2:27:02.100 --> 2:27:08.100]  An absolutely brilliant movie where the, you know, the face on the screen
[2:27:08.100 --> 2:27:10.100]  finally at the end says, I'm your God,
[2:27:10.100 --> 2:27:14.100]  which is what these Google and these banking people say.
[2:27:14.100 --> 2:27:18.100]  And you notice it's an upside down black pyramid that looks like the Google Eye.
[2:27:18.100 --> 2:27:22.100]  I mean, look, I said on there you may have missed it,
[2:27:22.100 --> 2:27:24.100]  but in fact, I like the fact you didn't hear me say it,
[2:27:24.100 --> 2:27:26.100]  so listeners can hear you say it and agree,
[2:27:26.100 --> 2:27:30.100]  because you minds that love liberty think alike.
[2:27:30.100 --> 2:27:32.100]  Yes.
[2:27:32.100 --> 2:27:35.100]  I mean, this is some of the most anti-illuminati, anti-tyranny propaganda I've ever seen.
[2:27:35.100 --> 2:27:37.100]  I mean, what did you make of that?
[2:27:37.100 --> 2:27:40.100]  I'm surprised they were able to get Oblivion out.
[2:27:40.100 --> 2:27:45.100]  Well, I think, you know, it was shocking that Oliver Stone got to make his movie,
[2:27:45.100 --> 2:27:46.100]  but it got out.
[2:27:46.100 --> 2:27:48.100]  Once in a while it happens.
[2:27:48.100 --> 2:27:54.100]  I think Oblivion might have been a little bit dense for the studio executives
[2:27:54.100 --> 2:27:57.100]  and they didn't realize what it was really.
[2:27:57.100 --> 2:28:00.100]  And kudos to Tom, whatever you think of him.
[2:28:00.100 --> 2:28:01.100]  I agree.
[2:28:01.100 --> 2:28:03.100]  Tom, I think he's a great guy.
[2:28:03.100 --> 2:28:05.100]  You know, his religion is his business.
[2:28:05.100 --> 2:28:07.100]  You're saying you know him, you think he's a great guy?
[2:28:07.100 --> 2:28:09.100]  Oh, I've met him. I've been with him a few times.
[2:28:09.100 --> 2:28:10.100]  Yeah.
[2:28:10.100 --> 2:28:17.100]  He's a real gentleman, and he's a real, as a Yiddish expression, mensch.
[2:28:17.100 --> 2:28:18.100]  You know, he's like a good guy.
[2:28:18.100 --> 2:28:19.100]  Yeah, mensch, yeah.
[2:28:19.100 --> 2:28:23.100]  Yeah, and he was very nice to my daughter and son-in-law,
[2:28:23.100 --> 2:28:25.100]  and I was with him a few times.
[2:28:25.100 --> 2:28:30.100]  And you could just see that, you know, he's not as huge as he is.
[2:28:30.100 --> 2:28:31.100]  He carries it well.
[2:28:31.100 --> 2:28:35.100]  But I think him making this movie, him in particular,
[2:28:35.100 --> 2:28:38.100]  he's an iconic figure who's very controversial.
[2:28:38.100 --> 2:28:41.100]  And if you noticed recently, there was a poll came out
[2:28:41.100 --> 2:28:46.100]  and said that he was like the least admired celebrity or something.
[2:28:46.100 --> 2:28:49.100]  It came out right around the time the movie came out.
[2:28:49.100 --> 2:28:56.100]  So, you know, it's like they're preemptively trying to discredit him personally
[2:28:56.100 --> 2:29:00.100]  because that movie may have hinted at something that people don't want people to know.
[2:29:00.100 --> 2:29:02.100]  Oh, it's hardcore.
[2:29:02.100 --> 2:29:07.100]  I mean, at so many levels, it's got the archetypes all exposed,
[2:29:07.100 --> 2:29:10.100]  the compartmentalization, how people working for the system
[2:29:10.100 --> 2:29:12.100]  are really destroying themselves.
[2:29:12.100 --> 2:29:14.100]  I mean, it's a very deep movie.
[2:29:14.100 --> 2:29:17.100]  Yeah, and you know, what started scaring me a few years ago
[2:29:17.100 --> 2:29:22.100]  by a book online and then the next time I'd buy a book,
[2:29:22.100 --> 2:29:24.100]  hey, Richard, you might like this.
[2:29:24.100 --> 2:29:26.100]  I'm like, whoa, you know what I mean?
[2:29:26.100 --> 2:29:32.100]  They immediately jump into your taste and every aspect of your being.
[2:29:32.100 --> 2:29:35.100]  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't tell my dad the stuff I'm doing on computers,
[2:29:35.100 --> 2:29:38.100]  my own private stuff, my mother, my wife.
[2:29:38.100 --> 2:29:41.100]  Why the hell does Google and Schmidt get to sit there
[2:29:41.100 --> 2:29:45.100]  and see everything I'm into or anything I'm investigating?
[2:29:45.100 --> 2:29:50.100]  Stay there, Richard Belzer's our guest and his Skype video's down, so...
[2:29:50.100 --> 2:29:52.100]  We're on the march.
[2:29:52.100 --> 2:29:54.100]  So there won't be any Christopher Walken.
[2:29:54.100 --> 2:30:23.100]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:24.100 --> 2:30:50.100]  We're on the march.

[2:33:01.100 --> 2:33:27.100]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:27.100 --> 2:33:32.100]  We'll talk some about his book. It's on the New York Times bestseller list before he leaves us.
[2:33:32.100 --> 2:33:42.100]  And I will try to take a bunch of calls tomorrow. I've kind of been hogging the show with all these guests, like Paul Watson, Dr. Catherine Albrecht, and now Richard Belzer on the show with us.
[2:33:42.100 --> 2:33:51.100]  But I'm glad this story got some attention via DrudgeReport.com last night and this morning, because this is a big story.
[2:33:51.100 --> 2:33:57.100]  Homeland Security funded exercises portrayed homeschoolers as terrorists.
[2:33:57.100 --> 2:34:10.100]  And then in the article, it goes through some of the newest drills where, quote, angry parents attack the school and then other drills where, going back for years, but it's still going on,
[2:34:10.100 --> 2:34:23.100]  they train where, quote, homeschoolers are in a mock attack and tell the elementary students they're attacked by a fictitious radical group called WACOs against schools and education who believe everyone should be homeschooled.
[2:34:23.100 --> 2:34:27.100]  That's what the children are told as guns are pointed at them.
[2:34:27.100 --> 2:34:40.100]  And then in the new training video in Seattle, Sergeant Dan Passion says, well, we're having such a big problem with this all across America is why we're doing this drill.
[2:34:40.100 --> 2:34:46.100]  Yeah, of parents attacking schools and homeschoolers attacking schools. Amazing.
[2:34:46.100 --> 2:35:05.100]  I've got a bunch of other news. I'm going to try to run through some of the headlines, but this big IRS enemies list deal where the Washington Post has to admit that, OK, it was it was any group quote promoting the Constitution probe expands the groups opposed to government who teach the
[2:35:05.100 --> 2:35:16.100]  Constitution. IRS charging groups that criticize the government. And then it goes on to say or promoted the Constitution promoted the Constitution.
[2:35:16.100 --> 2:35:24.100]  People could say, well, the founders, they still had slaves, but the Constitution's interpretation expanded to where then it got banned.
[2:35:24.100 --> 2:35:31.100]  They tried to ban it when they first created the Constitution 1798, but it took 60 something years to do it.
[2:35:31.100 --> 2:35:37.100]  And it's the idea of liberty. Why are they demonizing it? Because it creates checks and balances on government.
[2:35:37.100 --> 2:35:45.100]  By the way, Richard Belzer's book hit list is the new one, an in depth investigation into the mysterious deaths of witnesses to JFK assassination.
[2:35:45.100 --> 2:35:56.100]  Very strong in his last book, dead wrong, straight facts on the country's most controversial cover ups. Richard Belzer and David Wayne, both available at info store.com.
[2:35:56.100 --> 2:36:01.100]  You know, Richard, I'm here asking the questions instead of that. Where do you want to go with all this news?
[2:36:01.100 --> 2:36:07.100]  I mean, we've now discovered from our source and then gone there and proved it that Bilderberg is merging with Google.
[2:36:07.100 --> 2:36:18.100]  Of course, a big giant Internet takeover grid. You've got the best of times, worst of times, people are really waking up or they're getting deeper into the trance.
[2:36:18.100 --> 2:36:29.100]  You talk to a lot of heavy hitters. I'm seeing, you know, incredibly demonizing messages out of Hollywood for liberty, but also a lot of positive messages that more positive than I used to see.
[2:36:29.100 --> 2:36:33.100]  What's going on in the world from your perspective?
[2:36:33.100 --> 2:36:48.100]  Well, a lot of people are walking in their sleep and refuse to even entertain some of the even not as dark stuff that you and I get into because you and I have a passion for the truth.
[2:36:48.100 --> 2:37:02.100]  As you know, we don't have to make anything up. And when I talk to, you know, some of my people in the industry who are powerful and smart and they, a lot of them resist the notion of these
[2:37:02.100 --> 2:37:15.100]  conspiracies and murders and coverups in the government. But now these corporations and the government, they have to openly talk about it because now 1984 goes both ways with the Internet.
[2:37:15.100 --> 2:37:26.100]  So, you know, we're right on their heels. You know, for them to say anybody's talking about the Constitution, that's right left center. That's the American citizenry.
[2:37:26.100 --> 2:37:33.100]  They're declaring war on everyone. Don't think it's just the Tea Party or just, you know, guns rights groups.
[2:37:33.100 --> 2:37:46.100]  And, you know, the civil rights movement was kind of sabotage. Hoover would have black agents infiltrate a civil rights nonviolent group, incite them to violence to discredit them.
[2:37:46.100 --> 2:37:56.100]  And then when it went to trial, and that person was indicted, they, you know, go into session into the judge's chambers in case thrown out because national security.
[2:37:56.100 --> 2:38:07.100]  So we have to be very careful, as you know, better than anyone about any event that happens where it's like, you know, the Boston Marathon 911.
[2:38:07.100 --> 2:38:17.100]  I mean, it just keeps on spilling out the information. The initial story is always wrong, and then something else comes out.
[2:38:17.100 --> 2:38:24.100]  And then it's, you know, I've been studying the Kennedy murder for 50 years, and we're still finding stuff out about it.
[2:38:24.100 --> 2:38:35.100]  So, but the difference between now and then is we have the technology, we have the tools, your newsletters and your show makes people tell other people.
[2:38:35.100 --> 2:38:42.100]  And, you know, we have to, it's like, we started as families and then tribes and villages.
[2:38:42.100 --> 2:38:50.100]  But now it's this global, dark global force that has named themselves. The masks are off.
[2:38:50.100 --> 2:39:00.100]  You know, the mega banks, the banksters as you've coined them, and the oil companies and communications, you know, styles.
[2:39:00.100 --> 2:39:02.100]  Richard, why do you think...
[2:39:02.100 --> 2:39:05.100]  I'm sorry, Andrew, you're about to say something about this. Go ahead.
[2:39:05.100 --> 2:39:13.100]  Why do you think they're getting so brazen? Is that an attempt to just normalize things because they've failed at covering it up and then they give us your quote?
[2:39:13.100 --> 2:39:22.100]  No, I think you're right on the money. They're normalizing it. But how dare they go into a school and draw guns for a drill?
[2:39:22.100 --> 2:39:28.100]  I mean, that's as bad as making kids duck under a desk when they would be incinerated.
[2:39:28.100 --> 2:39:36.100]  I remember as a child, I mean, I'm old, so, you know, going into the basement and kneeling against a wall and making us pray.
[2:39:36.100 --> 2:39:43.100]  And I was looked at my friend, I mean, he's like, you know, fifth grad, I don't know, really young kids saying, what are they talking about?
[2:39:43.100 --> 2:39:48.100]  You know, this isn't going to do anything. And I knew that as a child.
[2:39:48.100 --> 2:39:55.100]  But they're reshaping language and making, and they're soft, it's a soft dictatorship.
[2:39:55.100 --> 2:40:05.100]  This country literally, by definition, is a fascist country now, because it's a country for the corporation, not the individual, as defined by Mussolini.
[2:40:05.100 --> 2:40:17.100]  And if you look at every Supreme Court decision in memory, every time there's a lawsuit against a corporation or a landlord or a boss, the individual rarely wins.
[2:40:17.100 --> 2:40:25.100]  And that's why I think the government's getting a little scared, because people are outraged.
[2:40:25.100 --> 2:40:30.100]  And, you know, the gun issue is an issue that everyone is emotional about and has feelings about.
[2:40:30.100 --> 2:40:35.100]  And you can't demonize every single person who owns a gun.
[2:40:35.100 --> 2:40:39.100]  First of all, it's physically impossible to take guns away from everyone.
[2:40:39.100 --> 2:40:48.100]  And second of all, everyone has the right, I mean, it's a question of the permutations of the law and to what degree the government can impose its will.
[2:40:48.100 --> 2:40:55.100]  And I'll tell you one more thing, Alex, if I may, one of the most important things about this country is the right to privacy.
[2:40:55.100 --> 2:41:02.100]  Jefferson and Adams, particularly Jefferson, that is something I personally cherish.
[2:41:02.100 --> 2:41:11.100]  And I cherish it for my family. And, you know, the godfather, you know, when Michael says to, first Don Corleone, he says to Sonny,
[2:41:11.100 --> 2:41:15.100]  never tell anyone outside the family what you're thinking. You know what I mean?
[2:41:15.100 --> 2:41:24.100]  And now Google is our family. We're supposed to tell them what we're thinking, this faceless corporate fascist entity that's not even a corporation anymore.
[2:41:24.100 --> 2:41:30.100]  It's a monster. I guess they're going to cut off my Skype or something.
[2:41:30.100 --> 2:41:35.100]  No, no, I totally agree with you. Your Skype did break up for a moment. Richard Belzer is our guest.
[2:41:35.100 --> 2:41:39.100]  Let me just give you an example of what you're talking about in the listeners.
[2:41:39.100 --> 2:41:47.100]  Punch my computer up on screen, please. New York Times two hours ago, Monsanto wins case on genetically altered soybeans.
[2:41:47.100 --> 2:41:59.100]  Now, you read the first paragraph and it says, oh, well, they won a victory saying farmers can't mix their seeds in with other seeds
[2:41:59.100 --> 2:42:06.100]  and say they own it. But that's not actually what the case was because I've been following it for two years and had the lawyers on about it.
[2:42:06.100 --> 2:42:16.100]  Plants don't have one daddy, one mommy. Plants can be one tenth of one percent, another plant of the same, you know, general variety.
[2:42:16.100 --> 2:42:24.100]  And so Monsanto pollen, whether it's corn, soybean, you name it, blows around and you get some of its genetics into other people
[2:42:24.100 --> 2:42:29.100]  and they can go prove I bought my seeds here. They're heirloom. They're not Monsanto.
[2:42:29.100 --> 2:42:35.100]  Almost every Mexican corn variety, there's thousands, has been infected by one form of BT corn.
[2:42:35.100 --> 2:42:43.100]  Now, Monsanto then goes and soothes the Mexican farmers, soothes the canola farmers in Canada, soothes the soybean farmers in North Dakota.
[2:42:43.100 --> 2:42:49.100]  They go and pull the plant, test it. They go on your property and say, it's one percent Monsanto.
[2:42:49.100 --> 2:42:57.100]  You go, but I bought the seeds. Well, it doesn't matter. You infringe on our patent when they're the ones that have dumped toxic waste on you.
[2:42:57.100 --> 2:43:06.100]  The Supreme Court rules they can do this and ensue you when they contaminate you or their seeds get in grain elevators mixed in.
[2:43:06.100 --> 2:43:14.100]  And then the article deceives and makes it sound like the people were stealing Monsanto seeds.
[2:43:14.100 --> 2:43:16.100]  Now, is that not Richard Incredible?
[2:43:16.100 --> 2:43:23.100]  Well, to patent food, Alex, you know, that's where riots start.
[2:43:23.100 --> 2:43:31.100]  When you start controlling food, I think this is really, it's like with the stem cell research.
[2:43:31.100 --> 2:43:41.100]  I don't think there's anything wrong if a woman gives birth and she donates her umbilical cord and someone can use the cells from that to regenerate their heart
[2:43:41.100 --> 2:43:46.100]  or to help, you know, an injured spine. There's nothing wrong with that.
[2:43:46.100 --> 2:43:50.100]  But you know, in America, in this country, there's five patents on stem cells.
[2:43:50.100 --> 2:43:54.100]  You can't use the whole stem cell. You can only use factors of it.
[2:43:54.100 --> 2:44:01.100]  It's crazy how these corporations are actually getting into our cells, into our food.
[2:44:01.100 --> 2:44:05.100]  Oh, it's worse than that. Richard, as you know, they ruled what six years ago. People can type it in.
[2:44:05.100 --> 2:44:13.100]  People will go in for cancer gene treatment and they'll say, oh, well, you gave a blood donation to this blood bank 20 years ago.
[2:44:13.100 --> 2:44:20.100]  A company bought that. They type tested and then patented your individual protein structures.
[2:44:20.100 --> 2:44:25.100]  You have to pay $100,000 extra to have this now. They own your genetics.
[2:44:25.100 --> 2:44:42.100]  Yeah, there's a famous case of a woman who was used. They used her blood and it was used in a way that it was introduced into like thousands of other people have an element from this woman's blood.
[2:44:42.100 --> 2:44:45.100]  They didn't tell her. They didn't tell her family. They only found out later.
[2:44:45.100 --> 2:44:53.100]  God knows what, you know, if God forbid, if you have to go to a hospital and they draw your blood and they take tests, where does that information go?
[2:44:53.100 --> 2:45:05.100]  And Alex, I don't need to be morbid, but my sister-in-law went into the hospital last November and died of something she didn't go in for.
[2:45:05.100 --> 2:45:24.100]  You know, it's like she got an infection in the hospital and I wanted my brother to sue and on the death certificate it said, unidentifiable, undiagnosable causes. How dare they to protect themselves from libel?
[2:45:24.100 --> 2:45:31.100]  So these people are lured up. They twisted the law on torture.
[2:45:31.100 --> 2:45:38.100]  Exactly. So where does it all go? We're ready to give up all our rights because of three people dead at the stage Boston bombing.
[2:45:38.100 --> 2:45:44.100]  You've got a government with a history of it, but then it's bad to say, hey, they may have done it again, even though they're known perpetrators.
[2:45:44.100 --> 2:45:47.100]  And then you've got, let's be conservative.
[2:45:47.100 --> 2:45:48.100]  Sure.
[2:45:48.100 --> 2:45:55.100]  Half a million people dying from flesh-eating bacteria or hospital staff infections a year in this country alone. It's growing.
[2:45:55.100 --> 2:46:04.100]  You've got, from one in 25,000, and of course my numbers higher, they say like 200 and something thousand die from it, but the numbers I'm getting is they keep lying on the certificates.
[2:46:04.100 --> 2:46:12.100]  It may be three times higher. So when I say 500,000, the number may be like a million. It's kind of like adverse effects from vaccines, maybe one report out of 100.
[2:46:12.100 --> 2:46:20.100]  So they say it's 290 something thousand from flesh-eating bacteria or other infections that are caused by these hospitals.
[2:46:20.100 --> 2:46:25.100]  So let's just say it's a million. I just said 500. People say, where do you get these numbers? But it expands on that.
[2:46:25.100 --> 2:46:31.100]  You've got hundreds of thousands from drug interactions, hundreds of thousands from mistakes, but no one's fear-mongering.
[2:46:31.100 --> 2:46:36.100]  Hey, the hospital's deadly dangerous. They're not going to fix the problems. They just paper over it.
[2:46:36.100 --> 2:46:44.100]  So how far can the BS go when the establishment's lawyered up, but that still won't protect them from reality?
[2:46:44.100 --> 2:46:51.100]  Well, this is why our heads are exploding, Alex, because we know that people are giving up their freedom unknowingly.
[2:46:51.100 --> 2:46:55.100]  People are self-censoring. That's the most chilling kind of censorship to me.
[2:46:55.100 --> 2:47:03.100]  When you think of something, you say, I better not say it. Self-censorship. That's how scary things are, how repressive.
[2:47:03.100 --> 2:47:08.100]  But fortunately, we have the internet and you have your show and you're reaching millions of people,
[2:47:08.100 --> 2:47:16.100]  and we just have to keep beating the drums and protecting our families and getting real personal because the macrocosm is so overwhelming.
[2:47:16.100 --> 2:47:22.100]  People, it's so complex and overwhelming that people can't really wrap their brains around it.
[2:47:22.100 --> 2:47:27.100]  That's why your show is so important and I want to volunteer. I'm going to France.
[2:47:27.100 --> 2:47:34.100]  I'd like to check in once in a while as your French correspondent and let you know what the European papers are saying.
[2:47:34.100 --> 2:47:40.100]  Absolutely, absolutely. Look, when you wake up at 7am or 6am, whatever it is, and you're lying there awake,
[2:47:40.100 --> 2:47:44.100]  or when you get home at night and you're laying in bed, you're meditating, you're thinking,
[2:47:44.100 --> 2:47:52.100]  where do you see things going in your mind's eye? 35, 40 years of researching this, where do you think it's going?
[2:47:52.100 --> 2:48:00.100]  I have to tell you, Alex, I'm almost at a loss for words because I'm deep into my Kennedy research
[2:48:00.100 --> 2:48:06.100]  and I'm finding things out that I thought I should have known and now this stuff is all piling up
[2:48:06.100 --> 2:48:12.100]  and it seems like things are speeding up towards everything that we feared,
[2:48:12.100 --> 2:48:18.100]  but it's disguised through corporations making it soft kill.
[2:48:18.100 --> 2:48:31.100]  I think I see it all going really dark unless we, the people, just shooting back non-violently through information.
[2:48:31.100 --> 2:48:38.100]  See, that's my frustration exactly. I feel people calling and thanking me or you're thanking me and it's actually torturing me
[2:48:38.100 --> 2:48:43.100]  because I will be calm at night or calm driving into work and have a million points I want to make
[2:48:43.100 --> 2:48:49.100]  that are so piercing and important to warn people and then I get on air and we cover most of it,
[2:48:49.100 --> 2:48:55.100]  but still you're on air and you lose part of your IQ or whatever, but my point is we're not doing enough.
[2:48:55.100 --> 2:49:02.100]  I know this is super dark and bad. I know it's accelerating and I feel like I should be doing more, Richard,
[2:49:02.100 --> 2:49:08.100]  but I don't know what that lever is to get us out of this and then as things get confirmed, people say,
[2:49:08.100 --> 2:49:13.100]  I bet you're feeling pretty good. Everything's coming true like you said it would. I'm like, no.
[2:49:13.100 --> 2:49:18.100]  Hey, I bet you're feeling good. Your show's getting bigger. Hey, Richard, your book's on The New York Times bestseller.
[2:49:18.100 --> 2:49:24.100]  I bet you're feeling good and you're like, I guess in a way people are waking up, but no. No. I mean, why? It's like...
[2:49:24.100 --> 2:49:32.100]  You know what, Alex? I think part of the solution would be film and documentary.
[2:49:32.100 --> 2:49:42.100]  That's very powerful stuff and the way to do it is through popular entertainment. That's how people learn.
[2:49:42.100 --> 2:49:50.100]  Some documentaries have had some very chilling thin blue line and silence in the house of God.
[2:49:50.100 --> 2:49:56.100]  There's certain documentaries, a fog of war. I'm working on one now about the 50th anniversary,
[2:49:56.100 --> 2:50:03.100]  and I'm going to tie in the Nazi connection in our history since World War II. It's going to be very expansive.
[2:50:03.100 --> 2:50:08.100]  I wouldn't mind interviewing you and then you have approval over what I...
[2:50:08.100 --> 2:50:12.100]  Oh, I don't care. Whatever. No, man, I trust you. I mean, hell, I let the enemy interview me.
[2:50:12.100 --> 2:50:14.100]  I mean, they're going to do what they're going to do. No, no.
[2:50:14.100 --> 2:50:24.100]  That's true. No, but you're doing the right thing. TV, internet, radio, newsletters, your films.
[2:50:24.100 --> 2:50:31.100]  Just keep pounding away. You know, it was a handful of guys in a room that started the American Revolution
[2:50:31.100 --> 2:50:36.100]  and they were all rich landowners. So, you know, but we have technology.
[2:50:36.100 --> 2:50:42.100]  We don't have the millions of dollars in the slaves, but we do have technology as one of our weapons.
[2:50:42.100 --> 2:50:45.100]  And you just, you know, loud and clear, loud and clear.
[2:50:45.100 --> 2:50:48.100]  Well, again, freedom for one group at first, then it's spread to others.
[2:50:48.100 --> 2:50:51.100]  That's why freedom is everybody's greatest possession.
[2:50:51.100 --> 2:50:55.100]  Richard Belzer is our guest. We're kind of doing a ghost dance here on air,
[2:50:55.100 --> 2:51:01.100]  but I think this ghost dance is going to turn out good if everybody takes action.
[2:51:01.100 --> 2:51:06.100]  Hi, my name is Stephen Hewer. As a degree nutritionist, my first priority is for you to get healthy.
[2:51:06.100 --> 2:51:11.100]  That won't happen if I make wrong recommendations or cause you to spend money on supplements you don't need.
[2:51:11.100 --> 2:51:14.100]  After 20 years working with thousands of products and thousands of people,
[2:51:14.100 --> 2:51:23.100]  I know for the most part what does and does not work. One World Way is the first and only unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows on the market.
[2:51:23.100 --> 2:51:30.100]  It retains substances that no other whey protein powder has. These nutritive compounds supply life-giving nutrition.
[2:51:30.100 --> 2:51:33.100]  Your body merely needs the right conditions to make great health happen.
[2:51:33.100 --> 2:51:38.100]  Due to low-quality foods, toxicity and aging, having great health is more of an effort than ever.
[2:51:38.100 --> 2:51:48.100]  One World Way is the superfood of the century and when added to your diet, it promotes energy, detoxification, muscle gains, fat loss and overall radiant health.
[2:51:48.100 --> 2:52:11.100]  Call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com. That's OneWorldWHEY.com.
[2:52:18.100 --> 2:52:22.100]  A simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[2:52:22.100 --> 2:52:27.100]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[2:52:27.100 --> 2:52:34.100]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[2:52:34.100 --> 2:52:42.100]  At only $29.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping.
[2:52:42.100 --> 2:52:55.100]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com. That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.
[2:52:55.100 --> 2:53:20.100]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[2:53:25.100 --> 2:53:50.100]  Fake TV, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping.

[2:59:52.100 --> 2:59:55.100]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[2:59:55.100 --> 3:00:01.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[3:00:01.100 --> 3:00:10.100]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[3:00:10.100 --> 3:00:12.100]  You want answers?
[3:00:12.100 --> 3:00:14.100]  Well, so does he.
[3:00:14.100 --> 3:00:18.100]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[3:00:18.100 --> 3:00:23.100]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:00:23.100 --> 3:00:31.100]  By the way, I get in contact with from time to time or run into really interesting people.
[3:00:31.100 --> 3:00:41.100]  And we're probably going to be getting on the show one of the greatest comedic geniuses of all time.
[3:00:41.100 --> 3:00:45.100]  I'll just leave it at that, who is a longtime listener of the show.
[3:00:45.100 --> 3:00:49.100]  And I'm really looking forward to that.
[3:00:49.100 --> 3:00:54.100]  Speaking of comedic genius, not only has he been a journalist, movie star, TV star.
[3:00:54.100 --> 3:01:00.100]  Richard Belzer is in Scarface, ladies and gentlemen, as the comedian at the Coco Cabana or whatever it's called.
[3:01:00.100 --> 3:01:04.100]  So that right, the Babylon Club, excuse me.
[3:01:04.100 --> 3:01:07.100]  That's right, the Babylon Club.
[3:01:07.100 --> 3:01:11.100]  So you got to be envious of that and the whole shootout scene with Tony Montana.
[3:01:11.100 --> 3:01:12.100]  Tony Montana.
[3:01:12.100 --> 3:01:13.100]  Oh my gosh.
[3:01:13.100 --> 3:01:19.100]  How cool is that getting to work with the master Oliver Stone that wrote that?
[3:01:19.100 --> 3:01:22.100]  Well, I auditioned for Oliver Stone.
[3:01:22.100 --> 3:01:28.100]  He was he was the writer, but he was in the room when I auditioned for the part with the director and the producer.
[3:01:28.100 --> 3:01:34.100]  And what it was was, it was all these comedians in the waiting room to go into audition.
[3:01:34.100 --> 3:01:39.100]  And they were making these comedians do their act and do a joke.
[3:01:39.100 --> 3:01:44.100]  And so when I went in, I said, I don't work in offices. If you come down to this nightclub, I'd be glad to do my acting.
[3:01:44.100 --> 3:01:47.100]  And the producer said, no, no, Richard, just do your act.
[3:01:47.100 --> 3:01:49.100]  You know, like I saw you do in the club.
[3:01:49.100 --> 3:01:52.100]  I said, with all due respect, I can't.
[3:01:52.100 --> 3:01:55.100]  This is not where I do my act.
[3:01:55.100 --> 3:01:57.100]  And they were like all looking at each other.
[3:01:57.100 --> 3:02:01.100]  And then next day I got a call that I got the part.
[3:02:01.100 --> 3:02:07.100]  So I'm not advising people to not audition when they audition, but.
[3:02:07.100 --> 3:02:11.100]  Well, you were obviously called there because they already wanted you and they liked the fact that you went. No.
[3:02:11.100 --> 3:02:15.100]  Yeah, Marty. Yeah, Marty, the producer.
[3:02:15.100 --> 3:02:18.100]  You know, I just saw this headline, Alex, which is really funny.
[3:02:18.100 --> 3:02:24.100]  IRS acted alone in targeting criteria for political groups.
[3:02:24.100 --> 3:02:28.100]  Oh, I'm sure they did that all on their own, even though they'd all go to jail if they didn't.
[3:02:28.100 --> 3:02:32.100]  Unbelievable. Oh, I guess Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone too.
[3:02:32.100 --> 3:02:34.100]  Yeah, right. All three of them.
[3:02:34.100 --> 3:02:44.100]  I spoke to Chris the other day, you know, when Chris Walken works, they give him a phone he can throw away.
[3:02:44.100 --> 3:02:50.100]  So that so they can just, you know, tell him when to be at work because he, as you know, he's not on any Google map.
[3:02:50.100 --> 3:02:53.100]  He doesn't have a cell phone. He doesn't have a computer.
[3:02:53.100 --> 3:02:59.100]  I have to call three different numbers to leave them a message, which I think is cool.
[3:02:59.100 --> 3:03:01.100]  He's the only person on earth. I know that's not.
[3:03:01.100 --> 3:03:06.100]  Well, obviously he's super politically, you know, wired and knows what's going on, but he's super private.
[3:03:06.100 --> 3:03:08.100]  I don't want you to give up any state secrets here.
[3:03:08.100 --> 3:03:13.100]  We can put video of you guys on the show for TV viewers last time you were on two times ago.
[3:03:13.100 --> 3:03:21.100]  But he's unpolitical. The point is, it's like every time I start ranting and I, you know, I've known Chris for 30, 40 years, you know,
[3:03:21.100 --> 3:03:26.100]  I would start ranting like in the 80s, for instance, you know, about something Reagan did or whatever.
[3:03:26.100 --> 3:03:32.100]  And he'd sit there and listen and listen. And then he would just turn to me and say, hasn't it always been like that?
[3:03:32.100 --> 3:03:37.100]  And then 10 years later, I'd be ranting about George Bush senior, you know, hasn't it?
[3:03:37.100 --> 3:03:41.100]  You know, so every 10 years, Chris reminds me that nothing has changed.
[3:03:41.100 --> 3:03:44.100]  You know, I agree with him, but it's getting worse now.
[3:03:44.100 --> 3:03:48.100]  And we're approaching a Stalin or Hitler level deal. I mean,
[3:03:48.100 --> 3:03:53.100]  Well, what's different now is the technology. Human nature is the same.
[3:03:53.100 --> 3:04:00.100]  Sociopaths will always gravitate towards power and the sociopaths will get together and pick the meanest one.
[3:04:00.100 --> 3:04:06.100]  But now we have the tools to hopefully identify them and call them out.
[3:04:06.100 --> 3:04:12.100]  But, you know, this report just came out, Alex, 500 plus pages and no one was indicted.
[3:04:12.100 --> 3:04:16.100]  And, you know, Obama's a war criminal. Bush is a war criminal.
[3:04:16.100 --> 3:04:23.100]  You know, by the by definition in this report, you condoning torture and that just went out.
[3:04:23.100 --> 3:04:26.100]  Hey, hey, you know what? I was so wound up earlier. I was running over you.
[3:04:26.100 --> 3:04:30.100]  If you got to go, you got to go. You want to continue one more segment to get into that report?
[3:04:30.100 --> 3:04:36.100]  I'm here. Yeah, let's pull up the bipartisan report that Bush junior and Obama are war criminals.
[3:04:36.100 --> 3:04:42.100]  And there's been no coverage because the next day after it came out, the Boston bombing happened.
[3:04:42.100 --> 3:04:47.100]  Ah, oh, oh, yes. Oh, that's right. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
[3:04:47.100 --> 3:04:53.100]  So we'll pull up that war criminal report and do one more segment with Richard Belzer because he's absolutely right.
[3:04:53.100 --> 3:05:21.100]  What happens if they get caught but don't get in trouble? That emboldens them. Oh my gosh. We'll be right back.
[3:05:24.100 --> 3:05:31.100]  You will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[3:05:31.100 --> 3:05:35.100]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[3:05:35.100 --> 3:05:41.100]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[3:05:41.100 --> 3:05:54.100]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[3:05:54.100 --> 3:06:01.100]  The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[3:06:01.100 --> 3:06:06.100]  What do you do when your propane runs out and you don't have a large amount of wood for cooking?
[3:06:06.100 --> 3:06:17.100]  That's when you need a Grover Rocket Stove from Stockstorage.com. The Grover Rocket Stove starts easily with any combustible material like junk mail, small twigs, leaves, weeds or dry sage brush.

[3:07:01.100 --> 3:07:11.100]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years. We have an alarm system and all of our doors have dead bolts. They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about five minutes.
[3:07:11.100 --> 3:07:17.100]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes but they were long gone with our TV jewelry and my guns.
[3:07:17.100 --> 3:07:27.100]  I kept thinking what if my family had been home? The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door and that dead bolts alone don't stop intruders.
[3:07:27.100 --> 3:07:39.100]  The officer told me to go to EasyArmor.net if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder. EasyArmor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins.
[3:07:39.100 --> 3:07:45.100]  I was surprised at how little EasyArmor costs and I installed EasyArmor in about 30 minutes.
[3:07:45.100 --> 3:07:55.100]  Visit EasyArmor.net. That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R.net or call 888-58 Armor. That's 888-582-7667.
[3:07:55.100 --> 3:08:16.100]  EasyArmor.net. Ultimate Door Security made easy.
[3:08:16.100 --> 3:08:32.100]  Okay, to illustrate how Google can censor results on two different computers last night and then again today, I tried to search Bush Obama ordered torture, Bush Obama committed torture.
[3:08:32.100 --> 3:08:40.100]  Can we punch up the screen here? Yeah, it's 208 central time. We're into Overdrive right now with Richard Belzer, author, comedian, movie star, TV star, you name it.
[3:08:40.100 --> 3:08:46.100]  But all around really smart informed guy since the 70s exposing the conspiracies of corruption.
[3:08:46.100 --> 3:08:56.100]  But look, I type in Obama Bush committed torture and I get global research. I get democracy now before its nose and fall wars.
[3:08:56.100 --> 3:09:03.100]  Look, Huffington Post, okay. Now again, this originally happened in the New York Times.
[3:09:03.100 --> 3:09:12.100]  Day before the bombing. Bush Obama committed torture. New York Times. I put in New York Times.
[3:09:12.100 --> 3:09:20.100]  And I finally get an April 16th article barely mentioning the article from the 14th the day before the bombing.
[3:09:20.100 --> 3:09:32.100]  And it goes on to show the task force led by a Republican and a Democrat for the congressional committee found that they ordered them to do it and it still continues.
[3:09:32.100 --> 3:09:36.100]  You know, you don't see zero dark 30 that's a bunch of torture porn.
[3:09:36.100 --> 3:09:40.100]  And then they have Obama on the TV set in that going, I've now ordered torture to stop.
[3:09:40.100 --> 3:09:46.100]  And then in the movie, they go, we can't torture to keep you safe anymore because Obama ordered torture to stop.
[3:09:46.100 --> 3:09:56.100]  Folks, they're torturing people all over the place. And I mean putting them in small cages too small for them, waterboarding them, burying them alive, electroshock, drugs.
[3:09:56.100 --> 3:10:02.100]  That's all been declassified really by whistleblowers. Not even declassified. They're trying to arrest people that exposed it.
[3:10:02.100 --> 3:10:09.100]  But it's been confirmed raping people's kids in front of them. Army report. Just type in army report on Abu Ghraib torture.
[3:10:09.100 --> 3:10:16.100]  They did stuff in there. I can't even say on air with small children and battery acid.
[3:10:16.100 --> 3:10:20.100]  Large objects by battery acid. You can figure it out if you want to.
[3:10:20.100 --> 3:10:26.100]  And then you see movies like Hostel and Saw and I know the Saw producer, Mark Berg.
[3:10:26.100 --> 3:10:33.100]  Not a bad guy, but they're making money off this where it's desensitizing people, showing all the torture, the cutting up.
[3:10:33.100 --> 3:10:40.100]  I mean, I went to a horror movie with my dad, Evil Dead, the remake.
[3:10:40.100 --> 3:10:48.100]  I thought, well, I want to see this. And I went to it and they were really violent chopping people up, graphic stuff, and people were laughing in the audience.
[3:10:48.100 --> 3:10:52.100]  And it was not a comedy like the first one.
[3:10:52.100 --> 3:10:58.100]  I mean, I like that army of darkness comedy. You know, some of those, who's that guy, the dark-haired actor? I forget his name.
[3:10:58.100 --> 3:11:04.100]  Bruce Campbell. That's pretty funny stuff. But this was not funny and people were laughing at it.
[3:11:04.100 --> 3:11:10.100]  And my point is we're losing our humanity. Now, Richard Belzer, I'll give you the floor in the last 10 minutes here of this segment.
[3:11:10.100 --> 3:11:16.100]  But, you know, getting at this, because you mentioned this last segment is why I held you over and I appreciate you holding over with us.
[3:11:16.100 --> 3:11:22.100]  It comes out that, okay, Bush ordered it. And then when they got caught, they sent people to prison that followed the orders.
[3:11:22.100 --> 3:11:23.100]  Right.
[3:11:23.100 --> 3:11:30.100]  And then now they're continuing it and they're expanding it and they're not even torturing real Al Qaeda.
[3:11:30.100 --> 3:11:35.100]  They run them. They're doing it for fake confessions to have show trials.
[3:11:35.100 --> 3:11:44.100]  I mean, and now they're saying, oh, the one brother that lived, he confessed in his bed while under sedation, but we don't have proof of that.
[3:11:44.100 --> 3:11:52.100]  I mean, right there, the guy walks, you can't get a fair trial. They go, well, he's a terrorist, so he doesn't. No more due process.
[3:11:52.100 --> 3:11:59.100]  Well, you know, they said it wasn't even clear. He may have shot himself in the neck or he was shot by the police.
[3:11:59.100 --> 3:12:03.100]  And how do you have a gun battle with a guy who doesn't have a gun?
[3:12:03.100 --> 3:12:07.100]  Oh, he climbed out of there unhurt and they cut his throat out. I mean, it's incredible.
[3:12:07.100 --> 3:12:20.100]  And we're supposed to believe that he confessed, you know, it's just, it's such an insult. That's why, you know, you and I could probably get part of our anger is the patronization and the utter contempt for the American people.
[3:12:20.100 --> 3:12:27.100]  The founders felt that an informed citizen's degree was really a key to, you know, picking your leaders.
[3:12:27.100 --> 3:12:41.100]  And they've really bastardized and diluted, you know, our country was a great idea, but it's been appropriated by these thugs who now have technology on their side.
[3:12:41.100 --> 3:12:50.100]  That's why we have to be really vigilant. You know, like you said, you know, our refrigerators now know what we eat. Jesus. I mean, God.
[3:12:50.100 --> 3:13:01.100]  And you have a groundbreaking multi-year investigation by partisan whistleblowers risk their lives and they go, okay, you tortured, you ordered it, you're war criminals.
[3:13:01.100 --> 3:13:13.100]  It's indisputable, premeditated, you lied and they don't get in trouble for that. Benghazi, IRS gate. I mean, these people make Nixon.
[3:13:13.100 --> 3:13:19.100]  It's just incredible. I mean, how much, how much can they get away with Richard? Are they above the law?
[3:13:19.100 --> 3:13:33.100]  You know, literally, yes. You know, Nixon got caught, but he got caught. He was busted not for any reasons like secretly bombing Cambodia or, you know, any of that stuff.
[3:13:33.100 --> 3:13:42.100]  He just went into the wrong place. He threatened the CIA. He was going to sick the FBI on the CIA about the JFKs. So that's why they got rid of him.
[3:13:42.100 --> 3:13:45.100]  It was nothing to do with how bad a president he was.
[3:13:45.100 --> 3:13:48.100]  Yeah, he got too big for his britches and tried to act like the president.
[3:13:48.100 --> 3:13:54.100]  He didn't threaten the CIA. Look what happens. You know, John Kennedy saw that the CIA went beyond its charter.
[3:13:54.100 --> 3:14:05.100]  They lied to him about the Bay of Pigs and they started to warn Vietnam and because they're making tons of money in Vietnam and he said, I'm getting out, you know, he also was going to change the Federal Reserve.
[3:14:05.100 --> 3:14:15.100]  You know, Kennedy took Eisenhower very seriously and there's a key word in Eisenhower's speech, his farewell speech when he warned us about the military industrial complex.
[3:14:15.100 --> 3:14:26.100]  And Alex, I just found out from Walt Brown, a great researcher, that originally in this speech, Eisenhower was going to say military congressional complex.
[3:14:26.100 --> 3:14:34.100]  And Richard Nixon convinced Eisenhower to take that out because it would estrange, you know, the party.
[3:14:34.100 --> 3:14:43.100]  No, no, I actually saw that in the Frontline episode. That's actually on record. Nixon wrote him letters as Vice President saying, do not do this. Don't tie.
[3:14:43.100 --> 3:14:56.100]  And the full speech he talks about a technocratic elite, a scientific elite that's running it to where they control all the science and then it's a technocratic dictatorship.
[3:14:56.100 --> 3:15:08.100]  Yeah, that's right. Literally. And he actually used the word spiritual in this speech, you know, that it affects every phase of our lives, you know, both economic and political and spiritual.
[3:15:08.100 --> 3:15:19.100]  So here's a five-star general who saw the World War II, who liberated the camps, who became president, was too moderate for whoever was, you know, the permanent national service.
[3:15:19.100 --> 3:15:28.100]  Well, if you watch the full speech, somebody drops a book or something, slams, and he jumps, they had just come to him and said, let's blow up base's emblaiment on Cuba to invade.
[3:15:28.100 --> 3:15:32.100]  And he just fired a bunch of people. And so that's why he was so freaked out.
[3:15:32.100 --> 3:15:42.100]  He was like, they want to blow up army bases and blame it on the Soviets and have a nuclear war, but they respected him enough to not kill him because he's been the supreme Allied commander.
[3:15:42.100 --> 3:15:51.100]  You have done your research. That's it. Kennedy was respected Eisenhower and was actually trying to continue the cleanup that he tried to do.
[3:15:51.100 --> 3:16:02.100]  Well, and actually, the CIA tried to sabotage a Russian ship in the bay off of Cuba to embarrass Kennedy, but it backfired.
[3:16:02.100 --> 3:16:08.100]  They lied to him. He didn't call off the airstrikes. General Cobble called off the airstrikes.
[3:16:08.100 --> 3:16:14.100]  And Kennedy said, if you destroy all the 10 of their planes in Cuba, then, you know, then you got something going.
[3:16:14.100 --> 3:16:22.100]  But they lied to him. They blackmailed him. And that's when he fired Dulles and realized, whoa, you know, he was in deep generals lied to him.
[3:16:22.100 --> 3:16:26.100]  CIA lied to him because Kennedy was rich. He was insulated and kind of naive.
[3:16:26.100 --> 3:16:31.100]  And he thought, OK, I'm going to make peace in the world. I'm going to, you know, have civil rights.
[3:16:31.100 --> 3:16:35.100]  I'm going to take care of the elderly. I'm going to let free enterprise rain.
[3:16:35.100 --> 3:16:40.100]  You know, he lowered taxes were really high in his day. He cut him by half. Yeah, I cut him by 30.
[3:16:40.100 --> 3:16:47.100]  So I mean, he he was, you know, just he took on steel. He took on banks, took on oil.
[3:16:47.100 --> 3:16:53.100]  He took on the Pentagon. I mean, you know, come on, it's like and then his brother took him on and they killed him.
[3:16:53.100 --> 3:16:58.100]  Oh, yeah. His brother said that the first thing Bobby Kennedy did after Jack Kennedy was murdered.
[3:16:58.100 --> 3:17:02.100]  He called John Napoleon and said, you bastards killed my brother, meaning the CIA.
[3:17:02.100 --> 3:17:07.100]  And then in a speech, he said, I can't find out who really did it until I become president.
[3:17:07.100 --> 3:17:13.100]  Of course, that painted a target on his back. And then he had the police report where Sirhan Sirhan's arm is pinned.
[3:17:13.100 --> 3:17:17.100]  He doesn't shoot him. We know the CIA skunkworks worker that did it.
[3:17:17.100 --> 3:17:24.100]  The police reports even admit that he was shot in the back and the temple. Yeah.
[3:17:24.100 --> 3:17:32.100]  Yeah. Thane Caesar, who worked for Wacken Hut, as you know, that security firm was standing right behind.
[3:17:32.100 --> 3:17:37.100]  And Sirhan was about eight feet away, so he couldn't have had powder burns.
[3:17:37.100 --> 3:17:42.100]  And they took 14 bullets out of that pantry. Sirhan's gun had eight bullets in it.
[3:17:42.100 --> 3:17:52.100]  Bobby Kennedy had powder burns on his. And if you notice, Bobby turned around and grabbed the tie and ripped it off of the guy behind him because he knew who shot him.
[3:17:52.100 --> 3:17:59.100]  And what's heartbreaking among other things is Bobby Kennedy's last words were, is everybody okay?
[3:17:59.100 --> 3:18:06.100]  He was concerned about other people. Whatever his politics, that's where he went at his last moment.
[3:18:06.100 --> 3:18:12.100]  Well, I mean, I've seen the photos of his jacket had like giant blast holes in it and burn holes.
[3:18:12.100 --> 3:18:15.100]  I mean, he was clearly shot at point-mike range in the back.
[3:18:15.100 --> 3:18:20.100]  Yeah. Well, some people think he was definitely shot in the temple because there's powder burns on his hair.
[3:18:20.100 --> 3:18:25.100]  And then other people said he was also shot. But, you know, they shot him.
[3:18:25.100 --> 3:18:29.100]  You know, I'm going from memory, but I had to like Jim Marsden folks on.
[3:18:29.100 --> 3:18:33.100]  And I mean, I think he was also shot in the back. Yeah, like you were saying.
[3:18:33.100 --> 3:18:42.100]  But am I wrong about it being shot? Plus, it was the London Guardian, the photos of the three known CIA guys, very high level in the audience that day at the hotel.
[3:18:42.100 --> 3:18:43.100]  Have you seen that?
[3:18:43.100 --> 3:18:45.100]  The Ambassador Hotel, yes.
[3:18:45.100 --> 3:18:46.100]  Unbelievable.
[3:18:46.100 --> 3:18:52.100]  I don't think he was shot in the back, Alex. It was in the temple because there was powder burns on his hair.
[3:18:52.100 --> 3:18:56.100]  But who knows, you know, I mean, we do know that Sir Han did not shoot him.
[3:18:56.100 --> 3:19:00.100]  We do know that Sir Han was hypnotized.
[3:19:00.100 --> 3:19:11.100]  A tape was leaked of a, you know, in hypnotism, there's a thing called the key where you can unlock the subject and they'll reveal why, how they were, you know, what they were supposed to do.
[3:19:11.100 --> 3:19:20.100]  And Sir Han was clearly hypnotized and, you know, had no idea that he didn't remember these shots, Bobby Kennedy.
[3:19:20.100 --> 3:19:25.100]  It's incredible. It's incredible. And it's just so amazing.
[3:19:25.100 --> 3:19:30.100]  And then now these people want to get rid of our families and our private property and our liberty.
[3:19:30.100 --> 3:19:35.100]  Also, they can run everything. They're going to destroy the human species so they can be in control.
[3:19:35.100 --> 3:19:42.100]  You know, what fascinates me is the ultra-riches obsession with thinning the herd.
[3:19:42.100 --> 3:19:56.100]  Like, that is, since, you know, the turn of the century, there's been this thing and I think it hints at a soft eugenics which America started with, you know...
[3:19:56.100 --> 3:20:12.100]  It does. Richard Belzer, amazing having you on. Folks, get the book in FullWareStore.com. Hit list.
