[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:32.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:32.320 --> 00:33.720]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33.720 --> 00:34.720]  Welcome.
[00:34.720 --> 00:40.280]  We're two days out from the anniversary of the revolution that created the Constitutional
[00:40.280 --> 00:45.760]  Republic, which for all intents and purposes, this may be one of the last true, fourth of
[00:45.760 --> 00:59.320]  two lies we have when there is even any vestige, any sliver, any crumbs or scraps of this nation's
[00:59.320 --> 01:06.040]  sovereignty that is left intact.
[01:06.040 --> 01:08.680]  It's very, very sad to see the Republic falling.
[01:08.680 --> 01:14.440]  So I want to, today, later in the show, and tomorrow, I will be live, seems like everybody
[01:14.440 --> 01:19.880]  I know in other businesses are shut down the day before Fourth of July, I guess, because
[01:19.880 --> 01:24.800]  the fourth doesn't fall during the week, but we will be live here tomorrow.
[01:24.800 --> 01:30.320]  And I want to discuss some today and open the phones up what the Constitutional Republic
[01:30.320 --> 01:37.480]  means to you versus living under a global corporate empire, a global corporate tyranny,
[01:37.480 --> 01:44.280]  a world government administered by a bunch of control freak eugenicists.
[01:44.280 --> 01:47.000]  And how do we restore the Republic?
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.800]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us, and we'll take calls in this hour,
[01:54.800 --> 01:57.640]  the second hour, the third hour, the fourth hour.
[01:57.640 --> 02:01.680]  You know, I normally have Wayne Madsen on every two, three, four months, but lately he's
[02:01.680 --> 02:06.960]  been coming on every few weeks because he's breaking so many huge news stories, and I've
[02:06.960 --> 02:09.800]  also found over the years that Wayne is a very good source.
[02:09.800 --> 02:17.160]  In fact, I've never seen him be wrong on a host of issues, and he called the fact day
[02:17.160 --> 02:23.040]  one that the swine flu was manufactured, that's now mainstream media, even admitting
[02:23.040 --> 02:28.360]  that, and just a lot of other big reports that he's broken.
[02:28.360 --> 02:32.600]  He went on Russia today, again, that he's actually a contributor on, he's a contributor
[02:32.600 --> 02:37.520]  on quite a few different TV programs here in the United States and worldwide, and talked
[02:37.520 --> 02:44.360]  about a secret document he's seen, a source he's talked to confirming that Taliban were
[02:44.360 --> 02:52.680]  brought into the United States-controlled areas of Iraq to kill U.S. forces.
[02:52.680 --> 02:56.960]  Now that sounds just absolutely amazing.
[02:56.960 --> 03:00.840]  It sounds like wild baloney.
[03:00.840 --> 03:06.320]  It sounds like, well, more than baloney, it sounds like BS, there's just no other word
[03:06.320 --> 03:12.160]  to describe it, but it's not when you know the history and the facts.
[03:12.160 --> 03:15.920]  So I called him this morning on short notice, he gets off the subway in about 30 minutes,
[03:15.920 --> 03:21.760]  he's in D.C., and he'll join us via cell phone for about 10 minutes to break this down, and
[03:21.760 --> 03:34.080]  then I got Paul Watson coming on because my film Terror Storm, made in 2006, Terror Storm,
[03:34.080 --> 03:39.360]  a history of government-sponsored terror, happens to have the government documents and
[03:39.360 --> 03:50.760]  mainstream news articles, mainstream news articles admitting that British SAS or the
[03:50.760 --> 04:00.320]  armed special air services of MI-6, their frontline covert commandos, Delta Force is
[04:00.320 --> 04:07.560]  the same strata, the Delta Force squadrons here in the United States are the U.S. doppelganger
[04:07.560 --> 04:12.600]  or copy of the British model, the Israelis imitate the British SAS as well, it's kind
[04:12.600 --> 04:27.280]  of the mark to meet in special forces in intelligence, Saboteur hit team commandos were caught machine
[04:27.280 --> 04:37.120]  gunning Iraqi trips, U.S. trips, sniping at British trips in fake beers, and I want to
[04:37.120 --> 04:46.600]  go over the scores of confirmed cases where the United States, Israel, Germany, England
[04:46.600 --> 04:52.280]  and others have been caught staging terror attacks against our own forces, if you have
[04:52.280 --> 04:57.560]  a son or daughter killed in Iraq, there's a very good chance they were blown to bits
[04:57.560 --> 05:00.640]  by CIA.
[05:00.640 --> 05:04.440]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly

[06:01.160 --> 06:14.600]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear, the
[06:14.600 --> 06:19.720]  Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[06:19.720 --> 06:29.040]  of the American people, if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[06:29.040 --> 06:35.920]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,

[07:01.280 --> 07:05.840]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions, if you're going into a battle and
[07:05.840 --> 07:09.560]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[07:09.560 --> 07:14.800]  My answer would be all I can get, in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[07:14.800 --> 07:16.640]  food is your only ammunition.
[07:16.640 --> 07:17.880]  How much do you want?
[07:17.880 --> 07:18.880]  When do you want it?
[07:18.880 --> 07:20.920]  Now or after the battle starts?
[07:20.920 --> 07:22.040]  When will you need it?
[07:22.040 --> 07:24.160]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[07:24.160 --> 07:25.520]  Will there be any food?
[07:25.520 --> 07:26.960]  Will it make your children sick?
[07:26.960 --> 07:31.120]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[07:31.120 --> 07:32.280]  and be immunized?
[07:32.280 --> 07:36.040]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[07:36.040 --> 07:39.640]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[07:39.640 --> 07:40.880]  How much will you need?
[07:40.880 --> 07:41.880]  We don't know.
[07:41.880 --> 07:42.880]  How much do you want?
[07:42.880 --> 07:43.880]  All you can get.
[07:43.880 --> 07:44.880]  I'm Alex Jones.
[07:44.880 --> 07:52.560]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
[07:52.560 --> 08:00.760]  out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[08:00.760 --> 08:19.480]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:19.480 --> 08:26.920]  It of course is Thursday, July 2, 2009.
[08:26.920 --> 08:31.000]  Coming up, we've got investigative journalist Wayne Madsen popping in again today dealing
[08:31.000 --> 08:38.480]  with Taliban al-Qaeda being shipped in to Iraq to kill U.S. troops and other coalition
[08:38.480 --> 08:44.760]  forces as a pretext to keep U.S. military forces in Iraq.
[08:44.760 --> 08:49.360]  This has actually been confirmed by the Times of London and London Guardian that British
[08:49.360 --> 09:00.080]  SAS, Special Air Services, was caught attacking and killing Iraqi forces, coalition forces,
[09:00.080 --> 09:08.120]  and so we'll be breaking all of that down, this history of the war machine, even staging
[09:08.120 --> 09:12.000]  military attacks against itself when there are none.
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.480]  See, their war machine business has to have wars.
[09:18.480 --> 09:20.920]  And so they go out and create the enemies.
[09:20.920 --> 09:23.400]  They come out and finance the terrorist.
[09:23.400 --> 09:25.080]  This is not my opinion.
[09:25.080 --> 09:37.600]  Harats, Jerusalem Post, UPI AP, you can just Google, you can just search engine, fake al-Qaeda
[09:37.600 --> 09:42.840]  or Israel founded Hamas, and you'll be reading Jewish newspapers.
[09:42.840 --> 09:46.760]  This is not Alex Jones saying this.
[09:46.760 --> 09:50.120]  Now there are real terror groups.
[09:50.120 --> 09:57.560]  That's why they founded Hamas to counterbalance Hezbollah playing the Shiite off against
[09:57.560 --> 10:02.000]  the Sunni, the Sunni off against the Shiite.
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.240]  The Muslim extremist, Wahhabist, are the favorites of British intelligence that have been working
[10:08.240 --> 10:13.200]  with them for hundreds of years out of what a Saudi Arabian today, the British government
[10:13.200 --> 10:18.440]  set up the House of Saudi, famous case of Lawrence of Arabia, but they were there hundreds
[10:18.440 --> 10:24.640]  of years before that working with them there in the key caravan rounds.
[10:24.640 --> 10:27.440]  This is how empires work.
[10:27.440 --> 10:32.320]  And many of the Muslim extremists out on Jihadi when they blow themselves up have no idea
[10:32.320 --> 10:37.200]  it's all part of the great game, but they're being handled by imams that are actually on
[10:37.200 --> 10:43.200]  British intelligence, U.S. intelligence, Israeli intelligence payroll.
[10:43.200 --> 10:46.360]  But this is how the Cloak and Dagger sophistication operates.
[10:46.360 --> 10:51.040]  This is where these religious zealots, useful idiots, come in handy.
[10:51.040 --> 10:55.120]  So they've used the Muslim extremists to attack the Serbs when the Serbs defended themselves.
[10:55.120 --> 10:59.680]  They were demonized internationally and then invaded and blown to bits and a new government
[10:59.680 --> 11:00.680]  installed.
[11:00.680 --> 11:05.080]  And I'm not taking sides on Muslim crow out Serb.
[11:05.080 --> 11:08.760]  I'm simply stating admitted fact.
[11:08.760 --> 11:15.720]  I always get threats from Croats and Muslims when I talk about the Serbs defending themselves.
[11:15.720 --> 11:18.880]  I mean, the Serbs certainly ran around and engaged in ethnic cleansing as well.
[11:18.880 --> 11:23.080]  But if you look at the UN's own numbers, they admit the Croats killed more Serbs and Serbs
[11:23.080 --> 11:24.080]  killed Croats.
[11:24.080 --> 11:26.040]  But I don't, I don't, I'm not Croat.
[11:26.040 --> 11:28.040]  I'm not Serb.
[11:28.040 --> 11:29.040]  Okay.
[11:29.040 --> 11:33.520]  I don't have a dog in this fight, as they say, a dog in the hunt.
[11:33.520 --> 11:34.760]  I'm just stating facts.
[11:34.760 --> 11:42.880]  They use the KLA, CIA funded congressional reports, Alfons de Motto Senate report admits
[11:42.880 --> 11:45.400]  all of this on record.
[11:45.400 --> 11:50.960]  They use the Muslim extremists, the Wahhabist jihadis brought in in 79 to attack the Russian
[11:50.960 --> 11:53.560]  back government in Afghanistan on record.
[11:53.560 --> 11:56.320]  Brzezinski wrote a book last year bragging about it.
[11:56.320 --> 11:59.040]  We talked about it before he'd blabbed.
[11:59.040 --> 12:00.040]  They're proud of themselves.
[12:00.040 --> 12:04.680]  Of course, he also brags how the US funded Pol Pot that killed 3 million people, 30% of
[12:04.680 --> 12:10.480]  the population in Cambodia.
[12:10.480 --> 12:20.200]  I mean, this is absolutely sickening, disgusting behavior that is going on.
[12:20.200 --> 12:24.640]  And they use the Muslim extremists to overthrow nations or destabilize nations in Africa, in
[12:24.640 --> 12:26.480]  Asia.
[12:26.480 --> 12:33.320]  They have CIA front newspapers put out Mohammed cartoons, making fun of him with a bomb on
[12:33.320 --> 12:37.280]  his head, none of the things, and then hype up a few controlled Muslim groups to start
[12:37.280 --> 12:44.120]  the riots, the Euro trash, then all get out in the streets and riot right along with it.
[12:44.120 --> 12:53.680]  Then Europe gets Muslim foe and Islam foe and goes along with crackdown police state systems.
[12:53.680 --> 13:01.960]  They bring in Sarkozy, but don't stop pumping in the Muslims at record rates.
[13:01.960 --> 13:02.960]  It's a dialectic.
[13:02.960 --> 13:04.960]  They control both sides.
[13:04.960 --> 13:08.400]  They control the synthesis.
[13:08.400 --> 13:13.760]  So that is coming up with Wayne Madsen and Paul Watson and T minus about 16 minutes here
[13:13.760 --> 13:16.760]  today.
[13:16.760 --> 13:20.240]  And Kurt Nemo wrote a great story two days ago when this was first on Russia today, and
[13:20.240 --> 13:21.240]  I kind of missed it.
[13:21.240 --> 13:27.440]  Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes, write so many great articles that
[13:27.440 --> 13:28.880]  I've missed some of them.
[13:28.880 --> 13:35.320]  So I hope you don't miss them every day up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[13:35.320 --> 13:40.560]  But here is the story that Kurt did, Paul Watson's beefing it up, kind of with some
[13:40.560 --> 13:48.080]  of the history of all the mainstream media admissions, government admissions of, oh yeah,
[13:48.080 --> 13:54.600]  the SAS was out staging a terrorist shooting coalition forces and bombing coalition forces
[13:54.600 --> 14:00.240]  dressed up like Muslims with fake beards and turbines on their heads.
[14:00.240 --> 14:06.480]  They got caught doing it and then British troops attacked the official Iraqi jail run
[14:06.480 --> 14:13.880]  by the coalition, killing a bunch of people to get them out.
[14:13.880 --> 14:19.080]  So we'll go over some of that report coming up.
[14:19.080 --> 14:21.680]  It's titled Madsen.
[14:21.680 --> 14:27.520]  Taliban imported to conduct false flag terrorism in Iraq.
[14:27.520 --> 14:30.360]  That's a good headline, but to really get people's attention in the full magnitude,
[14:30.360 --> 14:37.440]  I would have said US government importing Taliban to Iraq to kill US troops.
[14:37.440 --> 14:40.040]  See, get it through your head, folks.
[14:40.040 --> 14:46.000]  These are totally ruthless people that run things and they take our farm boys and our
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.240]  inner city boys and well-meaning patriotic Americans that love the red, white and blue
[14:51.240 --> 14:56.160]  and get a tear in their eye when they hear the Star Spangled Banner.
[14:56.160 --> 15:01.360]  In all of our country's great history and you're used by these corporate slugs who
[15:01.360 --> 15:05.680]  try to one up each other on how much they hate this country and hate sovereignty and
[15:05.680 --> 15:10.040]  the very group using you to take over the world is destroying our liberties and freedoms
[15:10.040 --> 15:13.240]  here on the home front.
[15:13.240 --> 15:17.240]  And I know a lot of you driving along in your cars right now, hearing this for the first
[15:17.240 --> 15:23.720]  time, but I know if you've been in Iraq, it's called a rumor with the troops that the intelligence
[15:23.720 --> 15:26.600]  agencies are running attacks on you.
[15:26.600 --> 15:27.600]  There's no rumor.
[15:27.600 --> 15:35.600]  In fact, urban mainstream articles with the Marines and the army have caught spooks from
[15:35.600 --> 15:40.960]  the US, Israel and England staging attacks.
[15:40.960 --> 15:45.480]  And there have been hundreds of cases in the news when US forces catch Taliban in al-Qaeda
[15:45.480 --> 15:49.520]  in Iraq attacking US troops and British troops and others.
[15:49.520 --> 15:50.720]  And then they're told to release them.
[15:50.720 --> 15:53.240]  In fact, Paul, I know you're listening right now.
[15:53.240 --> 15:56.600]  Let's create like a master article, even if it's just links.
[15:56.600 --> 16:00.000]  Give us that Financial Times of London and AP.
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  One headline was Airlift of Evil 2002.
[16:03.000 --> 16:07.200]  Newsweek also did a report that whitewashed it and said, oh yeah, tens of thousands of
[16:07.200 --> 16:18.200]  Taliban and al-Qaeda cream, the cream leadership flown out to safety into Pakistan to then
[16:18.200 --> 16:23.200]  build an army to menace the Pakistani government to bring it down.
[16:23.200 --> 16:26.280]  Then they're going to move them into Kashmir, then they're going to move them into India.
[16:26.280 --> 16:30.440]  They are the shock brigade of the new world order.
[16:30.440 --> 16:31.440]  Well paid.
[16:31.440 --> 16:37.000]  They're warlord leaders, paid in gold, paid in diamonds, just live in giant palaces built
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.720]  all over Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[16:40.720 --> 16:42.840]  Now that's been in the news.
[16:42.840 --> 16:47.160]  They're running the OPM as well, and they are the force to take over Central Asia.
[16:47.160 --> 16:52.240]  They are the great sword of the new world order, the cemetery.
[16:52.240 --> 17:00.840]  And so they're moved as a, as a Rook, as a key piece on the table.
[17:00.840 --> 17:06.680]  I would say more important than a Rook, almost a queen, like they really are a queen.
[17:06.680 --> 17:11.600]  They can move with that of any piece.
[17:11.600 --> 17:15.400]  They move in Eastern Europe, they move in Central Europe, they move in far Asia, they
[17:15.400 --> 17:22.040]  move in Africa, they move in Central Asia, and they were flown out to safety.
[17:22.040 --> 17:25.760]  I just keep remembering all these mainstream admissions, but all hidden in plain view like
[17:25.760 --> 17:32.160]  it's no big deal about U.S. Special Forces colonels and generals angry.
[17:32.160 --> 17:37.320]  Non-generals paid in gold, Special Forces catch them in the caves, catch them attacking
[17:37.320 --> 17:39.200]  U.S. Forces.
[17:39.200 --> 17:40.600]  They come out with their hands up.
[17:40.600 --> 17:48.760]  The CIA orders the drones not to attack, orders the predators not to attack, orders the reapers
[17:48.760 --> 17:50.040]  not to attack.
[17:50.040 --> 17:55.160]  They come out, hands up, they're taken to the base, they're loaded on C-130s with giant
[17:55.160 --> 18:03.160]  chest of gold and cash and diamonds and flown out to destabilize the next country, the black
[18:03.160 --> 18:06.280]  op force of hell.
[18:06.280 --> 18:10.320]  And this is the big dirty secret that gets the globalists hopping mad at me.
[18:10.320 --> 18:12.800]  This is when I get the death threats, this is when I talk about this.
[18:12.800 --> 18:20.240]  They can't stand you learning about it.
[18:20.240 --> 18:24.520]  Over and over again, look at the White House, two and a half years ago, 2007, three years
[18:24.520 --> 18:28.240]  after we broke the news and then New Yorker Magazine reported on it.
[18:28.240 --> 18:33.160]  But we were the first to talk about it.
[18:33.160 --> 18:34.760]  Remember?
[18:34.760 --> 18:39.680]  Remember what happened?
[18:39.680 --> 18:45.520]  Four different terrorist groups, three of them, Wahhabia, Stalkidah, out of Iraq and
[18:45.520 --> 18:53.120]  Saudi Arabia, officially funded by the CIA, inside Iran, blowing up school bus, attacking
[18:53.120 --> 19:00.000]  schools, bombing mosques, bombing dams, trying to get the Iranians to start a fight in Iraq.
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.520]  Across the border, where Al Qaeda sits.
[19:03.520 --> 19:04.960]  We've listed the groups, the names.
[19:04.960 --> 19:09.400]  Then the White House came out and said, yeah, we're using these groups to destabilize Iran
[19:09.400 --> 19:10.480]  with military strikes.
[19:10.480 --> 19:18.720]  They're backed up by U.S. special forces inside the country, marking targets.
[19:18.720 --> 19:27.000]  Al Qaeda openly working in the number three in Al Qaeda, their commander.
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.960]  Meanwhile, we told you in 2002 in road to tyranny that they would then in Afghanistan
[19:30.960 --> 19:36.760]  grab innocent 14-year-old goat herders and take them to Abu Ghraib, pick them to Camp
[19:36.760 --> 19:39.240]  X-ray, take them to other black sites for torture.
[19:39.240 --> 19:44.920]  Meanwhile, real Taliban in Al Qaeda sit there in armored fortresses, waging their war against
[19:44.920 --> 19:47.200]  the Pakistani government.
[19:47.200 --> 19:51.720]  They are the knife, the globalist hold of the throat of the Pakistani government.
[19:51.720 --> 19:53.800]  We'll be right back.
[19:53.800 --> 19:54.800]  Stay with us.
[19:54.800 --> 20:04.080]  Other news straight ahead, then we'll get back into this key subject.
[20:04.080 --> 20:05.760]  News Flash.
[20:05.760 --> 20:08.040]  Unemployment is soaring over 10%.
[20:08.040 --> 20:13.880]  The dollar is plummeting, and banks are beginning to close their doors.
[20:13.880 --> 20:18.440]  Global experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression.
[20:18.440 --> 20:22.040]  The world is on the brink of total meltdown.
[20:22.040 --> 20:27.320]  Unless you expect the government to bail you out, you must be able to grow your own healthy
[20:27.320 --> 20:28.320]  food.
[20:28.320 --> 20:29.320]  News Flash.
[20:29.320 --> 20:35.560]  Survivalistseeds.com has just released a brand new heirloom seed pack at a dramatically reduced
[20:35.560 --> 20:36.560]  price.
[20:36.560 --> 20:37.560]  Dramatically reduced.
[20:37.560 --> 20:42.720]  So you and your family have a long-term food solution.
[20:42.720 --> 20:46.560]  The choice between starvation and freedom is made by you.
[20:46.560 --> 20:47.560]  Right now.
[20:47.560 --> 20:48.560]  Right now.
[20:48.560 --> 20:49.560]  Go to survivalistseeds.com.
[20:49.560 --> 20:52.720]  That's survivalistseeds.com.
[20:52.720 --> 20:55.720]  Because you are almost out of time.
[20:55.720 --> 20:56.720]  Time.
[20:56.720 --> 21:00.240]  Survivalistseeds.com.
[21:00.240 --> 21:04.440]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth
[21:04.440 --> 21:06.960]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[21:06.960 --> 21:12.000]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many
[21:12.000 --> 21:15.040]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[21:15.040 --> 21:19.320]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[21:19.320 --> 21:23.240]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[21:23.240 --> 21:27.000]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[21:27.000 --> 21:28.280]  from Jekyll Island.
[21:28.280 --> 21:32.400]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[21:32.400 --> 21:33.400]  power.
[21:33.400 --> 21:37.280]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[21:37.280 --> 21:38.800]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[21:38.800 --> 21:43.560]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[21:43.560 --> 21:48.400]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[21:48.400 --> 21:51.480]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[21:51.480 --> 21:56.280]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[21:56.280 --> 22:00.240]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[22:00.240 --> 22:06.360]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[22:06.360 --> 22:10.840]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[22:10.840 --> 22:12.160]  us would like to see.
[22:12.160 --> 22:17.320]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[22:17.320 --> 22:18.720]  of the American people.
[22:18.720 --> 22:23.080]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[22:23.080 --> 22:28.160]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[22:28.160 --> 22:36.240]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[22:36.240 --> 22:39.840]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[22:39.840 --> 22:46.760]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[22:46.760 --> 22:52.240]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in super
[22:52.240 --> 22:54.920]  high quality at presentplanet.tv.
[22:54.920 --> 22:59.400]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[22:59.400 --> 23:04.600]  We are surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight
[23:04.600 --> 23:07.520]  into our bodies, take a deep breath.
[23:07.520 --> 23:12.720]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone
[23:12.720 --> 23:14.040]  entering your lungs?
[23:14.040 --> 23:15.560]  Have a glass of water.
[23:15.560 --> 23:20.360]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other
[23:20.360 --> 23:21.360]  chemicals?
[23:21.360 --> 23:22.360]  Of course you can't.
[23:22.360 --> 23:26.080]  The air that you breathe and the water you drink should help maintain good health, not
[23:26.080 --> 23:27.400]  take away from it.
[23:27.400 --> 23:32.520]  Airinaqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and water, and they know exactly
[23:32.520 --> 23:35.960]  how to help you rid your home or office of these toxins.

[23:56.960 --> 24:25.360]  Purify your life today.
[24:27.880 --> 24:35.160]  I'm here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time back
[24:35.160 --> 24:37.760]  from 9 to midnight.
[24:37.760 --> 24:42.000]  Central Standard Time, in fact, 9 to 1 a.m.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.840]  I keep forgetting we had it a fourth hour a year ago.
[24:44.840 --> 24:52.560]  That's not my fault though, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:52.560 --> 24:59.800]  You do a radio show from 11 to 2 for 11 years, and then you add another hour, you just keep
[24:59.800 --> 25:00.800]  forgetting.
[25:00.800 --> 25:06.880]  I wonder how many years it'll take me to stop saying 9 to midnight, 9 to 1 a.m. Central.
[25:06.880 --> 25:07.880]  That's just reared on the network.
[25:07.880 --> 25:15.000]  It's re-streamed continually at prisonplanet.tvinfowars.com, and don't forget the free podcast
[25:15.000 --> 25:16.640]  right there on the side as well.
[25:16.640 --> 25:21.840]  Look, I know it's painful for a lot of veterans and people to hear me come on air and say
[25:21.840 --> 25:25.000]  the Taliban and al-Qaida work for the U.S. government.
[25:25.000 --> 25:32.520]  It is all hidden in plain view, A.P. Reuters, Times of London, London Guardian, Haritz,
[25:32.520 --> 25:40.720]  Jerusalem Post, UPI, and Paul Watson is putting a master link article up in the next few minutes
[25:40.720 --> 25:46.440]  at prisonplanet.com, and he will be on whether to talk about it.
[25:46.440 --> 25:50.160]  But it's just like people that can't believe that Madoff, the news is now reporting, stole
[25:50.160 --> 25:54.040]  171 billion.
[25:54.040 --> 25:58.200]  I kept saying the real numbers, we were getting over 100 billion, not 50 billion.
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.800]  Well the feds, I guess that's the right hand of Madoff, the left hand stole it, now it
[26:02.800 --> 26:09.640]  goes back to the right hand of the Madoff types, 171 billion plus is what's been grabbed
[26:09.640 --> 26:11.640]  out of his assets.
[26:11.640 --> 26:16.160]  Oh, I thought it was only 50 billion in a Ponzi scheme.
[26:16.160 --> 26:18.280]  See, he's kind of the fall guy.
[26:18.280 --> 26:23.600]  I would imagine we'll hear that Madoff has cancer soon, and that's why they've decided
[26:23.600 --> 26:28.320]  to, you know, for his family and the globalist and the new world order friends he has, that
[26:28.320 --> 26:31.640]  he'll take the hit for the team.
[26:31.640 --> 26:36.520]  And our guests have said that the money's been fenced out of the United States from
[26:36.520 --> 26:41.280]  the stupid slaves that invested as they think of us to offshore banks.
[26:41.280 --> 26:44.520]  But I'm sorry, I have to correct.
[26:44.520 --> 26:49.800]  The media was saying 50 billion, and we said more like 100 billion, I'm sorry, 171 billion.
[26:49.800 --> 26:54.640]  But see, they got to say 50 billion so you never get paid back, see.
[26:54.640 --> 27:00.080]  There's plenty of money for the investors, but you're not going to get it.
[27:00.080 --> 27:04.040]  If you get anything, you're going to get a sent to a forced labor camp.
[27:04.040 --> 27:05.040]  How's that sound?
[27:05.040 --> 27:08.840]  See, the bankers are bankrupting everything by design.
[27:08.840 --> 27:13.760]  They've stolen 14.8 trillion, and we haven't got new numbers in two months, seven months
[27:13.760 --> 27:21.760]  into the bailout, it was 14.8 trillion, and I'm sure it'll probably be 20 trillion next
[27:21.760 --> 27:23.680]  time we hear it.
[27:23.680 --> 27:28.120]  Next time they release the numbers, I'm just throwing it out there, you know, 20 trillion,
[27:28.120 --> 27:36.360]  what, 19.7, 20.1 trillion, I don't know, it's 14.8 trillion two months ago.
[27:36.360 --> 27:40.720]  But we're online now to hear, and of course they'll say we won't say where the 14.8 trillion
[27:40.720 --> 27:45.680]  or 20 trillion or whatever it's going to be went.
[27:45.680 --> 27:49.720]  They're online every time we get the numbers for it to be 12 months out from the October
[27:49.720 --> 27:54.520]  3rd takeover for it to be 26 trillion.
[27:54.520 --> 27:58.320]  But we know it's 14.8 trillion last time they told us.
[27:58.320 --> 28:04.000]  But they tell Congress, sit down, shut up, we're not telling you where the money is.
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.280]  And if you get too uppity, we'll just stage a nuke attack.
[28:08.280 --> 28:11.680]  I think I've got that clip coming up later.
[28:11.680 --> 28:17.560]  On Glenn Beck, he has the quote, been lauding hunter, yes, it's kind of like hunting for
[28:17.560 --> 28:20.520]  your pocket watch in your pocket.
[28:20.520 --> 28:22.440]  Isn't it globalist?
[28:22.440 --> 28:23.440]  Isn't it Spooks?
[28:23.440 --> 28:28.000]  So we're going to play that later.
[28:28.000 --> 28:35.360]  Glenn Beck, yes, it would be, if America isn't nuked, al-Qaeda will get us, America will
[28:35.360 --> 28:41.520]  fall, kind of like, we should pull up the clips of the five big TV generals still secretly
[28:41.520 --> 28:42.920]  on Pentagon payroll that came out.
[28:42.920 --> 28:46.920]  I told you before, and they were on payroll, clearly, meeting with Rumsfeld going, if we
[28:46.920 --> 28:49.400]  don't have another big attack, we're not going to get this mission done.
[28:49.400 --> 28:52.440]  And you know what Rumsfeld, yeah, 9-11 sure helped us.
[28:52.440 --> 28:54.080]  Hmm, I wonder what we need to do.
[28:54.080 --> 28:59.160]  I mean, they are one millimeter from on tape saying, let's hit these bastards again, that'll
[28:59.160 --> 29:03.160]  teach them to submit to us.
[29:03.160 --> 29:08.680]  In fact, maybe Watson should add that to this Taliban al-Qaeda works for the U.S. government
[29:08.680 --> 29:14.640]  story, because this is right out in plain view.
[29:14.640 --> 29:21.520]  And now, all over the press club, there's sources saying to Madsen and others that troops
[29:21.520 --> 29:29.080]  continue to catch them over there, that the troops are wives to it.
[29:29.080 --> 29:35.520]  But it's confirmed this is going on, we're gonna go live at prisonplanet.tv, gonna give
[29:35.520 --> 29:40.760]  you a big three and a half hours live today on this Thursday, and then I'll be live tomorrow.
[29:40.760 --> 29:45.920]  Look, we got to stop being suckers, folks, the people running our country don't care
[29:45.920 --> 29:50.920]  about our sovereignty, in fact, they hate it and want to get rid of it, comprende?
[29:50.920 --> 29:54.720]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:54.720 --> 30:00.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.360 --> 30:04.320]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us
[30:04.320 --> 30:07.520]  in the truth movement for years, InnerHealth Botanicals.
[30:07.520 --> 30:11.720]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[30:11.720 --> 30:16.960]  My wife just loves the stuff, and now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood
[30:16.960 --> 30:21.000]  his Editors' Choice Award, or Best Superfood of 2009.
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.920]  InnerFood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[30:23.920 --> 30:25.640]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[30:25.640 --> 30:30.400]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[30:30.400 --> 30:33.240]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[30:33.240 --> 30:38.320]  Try the Nutra Cafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the
[30:38.320 --> 30:39.320]  immune system.
[30:39.320 --> 30:43.520]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great, and take it from me, folks, it really does
[30:43.520 --> 30:44.520]  taste great.
[30:44.520 --> 30:46.400]  Don't forget to try their other great products.

[31:01.040 --> 31:05.280]  It is a big idea, a New World Order.
[31:05.280 --> 31:09.920]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[31:09.920 --> 31:12.240]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[31:12.240 --> 31:15.840]  Could their objective be world domination?
[31:15.840 --> 31:19.000]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[31:19.000 --> 31:24.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating
[31:24.000 --> 31:29.360]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[31:29.360 --> 31:34.800]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[31:34.800 --> 31:38.720]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[31:38.720 --> 31:41.360]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[31:41.360 --> 31:42.360]  Most people have no idea.
[31:42.360 --> 31:43.360]  They're not after money.
[31:43.360 --> 31:44.360]  They have all the money they need.
[31:44.360 --> 31:45.360]  They're after power.
[31:45.360 --> 31:46.680]  That's their affidavit.
[31:46.680 --> 31:52.520]  Builder in-game on DVD at www.prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right
[31:52.520 --> 31:58.080]  now at www.prisonplanet.tv in-game, a blueprint for global enslaved.
[31:58.080 --> 31:59.240]  You have been warned.
[31:59.240 --> 32:04.400]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[32:04.400 --> 32:06.960]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[32:06.960 --> 32:07.960]  He was devastated.
[32:07.960 --> 32:12.240]  But it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone
[32:12.240 --> 32:16.640]  and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[32:16.640 --> 32:21.440]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood
[32:21.440 --> 32:22.960]  and own your own business.
[32:22.960 --> 32:25.560]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[32:25.560 --> 32:31.240]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people
[32:31.240 --> 32:35.640]  on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[32:35.640 --> 32:40.200]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing
[32:40.200 --> 32:44.520]  of helpful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive
[32:44.520 --> 32:46.440]  compounding monthly income.
[32:46.440 --> 32:48.920]  chocolate.ownmyself.com
[32:48.920 --> 32:50.400]  And check out the opportunity.
[32:50.400 --> 32:53.160]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com
[32:53.160 --> 32:57.320]  It takes very little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[32:57.320 --> 33:25.880]  Or chocolate.ownmyself.com
[33:25.880 --> 33:31.260]  All right, we are live simulcasting at prismplanet.tv, the syndicated radio transmission from our
[33:31.260 --> 33:33.080]  studios here in Austin, Texas.
[33:33.080 --> 33:39.040]  We will be live coming up Friday the day before the 4th of July and I'll be live this Sunday
[33:39.040 --> 33:45.240]  4-6pm for the abbreviated transmission as we do every Sunday, central standard time.
[33:45.240 --> 33:49.720]  The next month or so, I'm going to move out of the MZ studios into these studios on Sunday
[33:49.720 --> 33:57.760]  so we can also simulcast live at prismplanet.tv for all of the viewers out there.
[33:57.760 --> 34:03.240]  I want to go ahead now and go to a clip of Wayne Madsen on Russia today two days ago
[34:03.240 --> 34:09.680]  making what on the surface sounds like an outlandish claim that Taliban slash al-Qaeda
[34:09.680 --> 34:16.280]  is being shipped in from Afghanistan to kill U.S. forces and engage in crisis creation
[34:16.280 --> 34:18.040]  in Iraq.
[34:18.040 --> 34:22.640]  But did you know that the times of London and others have admitted that British SAS
[34:22.640 --> 34:29.480]  was caught dressed up like Taliban attacking Iraqi and U.S. and British forces back in
[34:29.480 --> 34:30.480]  2006?
[34:30.480 --> 34:31.480]  That's in my film Terror Storm.
[34:31.480 --> 34:35.040]  So I want to go over some of that history today.
[34:35.040 --> 34:38.040]  But here is Wayne Madsen on Russia today.
[34:38.040 --> 34:43.640]  The investigative journalist in the United States claims American intelligence sent Afghan
[34:43.640 --> 34:49.880]  mercenaries into Iraq in order to attack the country's civilians and military personnel.
[34:49.880 --> 34:54.640]  Wayne Madsen says the Afghans were recruited from Taliban ranks and were paid for their
[34:54.640 --> 34:55.640]  services.
[34:55.640 --> 34:58.040]  Wayne Madsen joins us now live from Washington, D.C.
[34:58.040 --> 35:00.720]  Mr. Madsen, you're putting your head where above the parapet here.
[35:00.720 --> 35:06.240]  These are serious allegations that Americans are paying for attacks on their own military
[35:06.240 --> 35:07.320]  personnel.
[35:07.320 --> 35:09.560]  What is your evidence here?
[35:09.560 --> 35:17.640]  Well, a very credible Western intelligence source who was stationed in Iraq in 2007 reports
[35:17.640 --> 35:24.920]  that during that year a 40-foot-long tractor trailer was stopped on the Karate Bridge in
[35:24.920 --> 35:27.860]  Baghdad by Iraqi police officers.
[35:27.860 --> 35:33.720]  When they looked in the back of the trailer, they found 30 to 40 Taliban guerrillas who
[35:33.720 --> 35:39.360]  said that they were brought in by the United States to stir up trouble in Iraq to attack
[35:39.360 --> 35:42.000]  civilians and coalition forces.
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.680]  When the Iraqi police attempted to detain them for further questioning, the U.S. military
[35:47.680 --> 35:50.320]  commanders told them to let them go.
[35:50.320 --> 36:00.320]  In addition to that, I received a two-page list of Iraqi members of the Muqtada al-Sadar
[36:00.320 --> 36:06.920]  Madi army who were being supplied with materials to make these improvised explosive devices,
[36:06.920 --> 36:09.720]  roadside bombs.
[36:09.720 --> 36:13.120]  The list contained their cell phone numbers, their locations.
[36:13.120 --> 36:18.640]  When this list was turned over to U.S. forces to take action, nothing was done because at
[36:18.640 --> 36:25.120]  the time, General David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in Baghdad, had signed
[36:25.120 --> 36:31.640]  a cease-fire agreement six months earlier with Muqtada al-Sadar's Madi army and decided
[36:31.640 --> 36:37.400]  he didn't want to upset that cease-fire by taking action against al-Sadar and no action
[36:37.400 --> 36:38.400]  was taken.
[36:38.400 --> 36:46.440]  So here we have two cases of the U.S. basically not only looking the other way, but actively
[36:46.440 --> 36:52.720]  participating in this violence by bringing in Taliban guerrillas from Afghanistan.
[36:52.720 --> 36:57.360]  You're a former naval officer yourself, you've also worked in security, you've got a good
[36:57.360 --> 36:59.760]  idea to the background here.
[36:59.760 --> 37:04.760]  Why would the U.S. that want to further inflame violence and terrorism in Iraq?
[37:04.760 --> 37:13.720]  Well, we just have to look at the whole panoply of crimes of the Bush and Cheney administration,
[37:13.720 --> 37:21.040]  everything from torture to the phony intelligence that got us into the war in Iraq to see that
[37:21.040 --> 37:28.840]  there were geopolitical and oil and energy interests that were preeminent to keep U.S.
[37:28.840 --> 37:34.480]  forces inside Iraq and what better way than to generate these what are known as false
[37:34.480 --> 37:36.560]  flag terror attacks.
[37:36.560 --> 37:41.720]  Of course there had never been an entity called al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia, but there certainly
[37:41.720 --> 37:48.960]  seemed to have been one that was quite active after U.S. forces occupied the nation.
[37:48.960 --> 37:54.480]  So I believe that this is just a classic false flag terror attack.
[37:54.480 --> 38:00.080]  We know that the U.S. has had a long history with the Taliban going back to the war in
[38:00.080 --> 38:02.120]  Afghanistan against the Soviet Union.
[38:02.120 --> 38:07.680]  Robin Cook, the late British Foreign Secretary, pointed out that al-Qaeda was nothing more
[38:07.680 --> 38:15.320]  than a CIA database of people who funders and people, mercenaries that they could use
[38:15.320 --> 38:19.160]  against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.
[38:19.160 --> 38:21.560]  So we have a track record here.
[38:21.560 --> 38:24.840]  Mr. Mapps, you're also claiming that U.S. officials turned a blind eye to attacks.
[38:24.840 --> 38:26.160]  They knew it was going to happen.
[38:26.160 --> 38:28.680]  You intimated to that earlier.
[38:28.680 --> 38:30.160]  How much of what's going on then?
[38:30.160 --> 38:35.520]  In your view, do you think it's being orchestrated?
[38:35.520 --> 38:41.280]  I think a lot of it is being orchestrated because the U.S., although the Obama administration
[38:41.280 --> 38:46.760]  is now withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraqi cities, we know that from statements made
[38:46.760 --> 38:53.200]  by top U.S. military commanders that U.S. troops may remain in Iraq for a number of
[38:53.200 --> 38:58.400]  years in these forward-operating bases located out of the city, but it looks like the United
[38:58.400 --> 39:03.080]  States has no interest in leaving Iraq.
[39:03.080 --> 39:08.120]  You can see the rest of it up on infowars.com or WayneMadsonreport.com or also Russia Today.
[39:08.120 --> 39:11.000]  Now look, we posted this two days ago.
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  Kurt Nemo wrote a story called Madsen.
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.280]  Madsen imported to conduct false flag terrorism in Iraq.
[39:18.280 --> 39:23.600]  And Kurt wrote a nice story, but kind of a standalone story about Madsen's claims.
[39:23.600 --> 39:27.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, they used radical Muslims to attack the Serbs, the CIA did.
[39:27.840 --> 39:31.520]  They used them to attack the Russians and the Russian-backed government in Afghanistan
[39:31.520 --> 39:35.280]  in 79 to elicit the full invasion, to draw the men.
[39:35.280 --> 39:37.680]  Brzezinski wrote about that in Braggs.
[39:37.680 --> 39:43.400]  They caught the British SAS in 2006 dressed up like Arabs, shooting at U.S., British,
[39:43.400 --> 39:46.240]  and Iraqi forces in Bazaar.
[39:46.240 --> 39:49.720]  We're going to put up some photos of them caught with the fake beards.
[39:49.720 --> 39:50.960]  This is admitted.
[39:50.960 --> 39:57.960]  The Israel, Heretz has the headlines, Israel created fake al-Qaeda, staged fake attacks,
[39:57.960 --> 40:01.760]  in Israel as a pretext to end peace deals.
[40:01.760 --> 40:05.520]  This was being done in Iraq, the IEDs, to blame it on Iran.
[40:05.520 --> 40:09.520]  They kept trying to frame Iran, and they kept coming out in the news that it was U.S. made
[40:09.520 --> 40:12.160]  weapons, the components.
[40:12.160 --> 40:16.160]  Now I want you to know if you're listening, there's a good chance there was some real
[40:16.160 --> 40:23.240]  Amuzhahideen, as they're called, or the military calls them, Hajis, trying to kill you in Iraq.
[40:23.240 --> 40:24.920]  But a lot of that was over turf.
[40:24.920 --> 40:30.080]  Most of the killings were al-Qaeda brought in, and they're using the same al-Qaeda out
[40:30.080 --> 40:31.560]  of Western Iraq on record.
[40:31.560 --> 40:36.560]  The White House admits this to attack Iran for the last five years, and the White House
[40:36.560 --> 40:38.480]  has admitted that.
[40:38.480 --> 40:41.480]  Number three in al-Qaeda works for the CIA, so I want to bring Wayne Madsen up and work
[40:41.480 --> 40:48.000]  for the NSA, and many other federal secretive agencies, syndicated columnists, and write
[40:48.000 --> 40:49.840]  for some of the biggest publications in the country.
[40:49.840 --> 40:56.040]  I wanted to have him on because he put out stuff that is a new development about, basically,
[40:56.040 --> 41:01.400]  Hajis being brought in, Jihadis being brought in out of Afghanistan, the same group they
[41:01.400 --> 41:06.640]  brought into Pakistan, and the airlift of evil after the U.S. took over Afghanistan.
[41:06.640 --> 41:09.000]  That was a stage takeover, 2001.
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.600]  That was in the times of London.
[41:10.600 --> 41:12.960]  So this is all really hidden in plain view.
[41:12.960 --> 41:15.600]  Wayne Madsen, break down the facts here for us.
[41:15.600 --> 41:23.320]  Well, I was told by a very credible source that in 2007, a 40-foot-long tractor trailer
[41:23.320 --> 41:26.440]  was stopped on the Karate Bridge in Baghdad.
[41:26.440 --> 41:31.480]  And when the Iraqi police looked in the back, they found about 30 to 40 Taliban fighters
[41:31.480 --> 41:32.480]  from Afghanistan.
[41:32.480 --> 41:37.720]  They said they were brought in by the United States to create mayhem.
[41:37.720 --> 41:41.960]  When the U.S. forces showed up, they told the Iraqis, let these people go.
[41:41.960 --> 41:48.920]  So here we have, again, another one of these cases, from, like I say, a very credible source.
[41:48.920 --> 41:57.160]  I was also told and shown a list of members of Muqtada al-Saudar's Medi army that were
[41:57.160 --> 41:58.480]  constructing these IEDs.
[41:58.480 --> 42:03.440]  And again, nothing was done to shut down what was called a bomb-making cell.
[42:03.440 --> 42:09.080]  Again, in the Karate district of Baghdad, the same location where the Taliban were stopped.
[42:09.080 --> 42:18.360]  So we have at least two well-documented cases where U.S. forces interceded to basically
[42:18.360 --> 42:21.320]  look the other way and take no action against them.
[42:21.320 --> 42:22.920]  Well, it's more than that, Wayne.
[42:22.920 --> 42:23.920]  Right.
[42:23.920 --> 42:27.360]  I mean, if you're saying they're bringing in Taliban, which has been confirmed separately
[42:27.360 --> 42:33.360]  in the past, and they're using those Wahhabis-connected people out of the west of Iraq to attack
[42:33.360 --> 42:38.360]  the Iranians, you're saying they're also funding Shiite al-Saudar?
[42:38.360 --> 42:39.360]  Yes, absolutely.
[42:39.360 --> 42:48.120]  Now, that's not to say that Iran's government was involved, but certainly there was an active
[42:48.120 --> 42:51.680]  war by the United States in allowing some of this stuff to go on.
[42:51.680 --> 42:57.080]  And how many U.S. troops and coalition forces, and let's not forget the Iraqi civilians who
[42:57.080 --> 43:01.160]  were killed in these explosions, these car bombs, these roadside bomb attacks.
[43:01.160 --> 43:03.520]  Why would they want to do this?
[43:03.520 --> 43:07.840]  Why would they want mayhem as a pretext to keep the forces there and then stop the stage
[43:07.840 --> 43:10.240]  bombings and say, oh, look, the surge worked?
[43:10.240 --> 43:15.760]  Well, of course, what we heard from the people like Cheney and the Neocons was we can't pull
[43:15.760 --> 43:21.960]  out because, look, we got al-Qaeda now called al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a group that never
[43:21.960 --> 43:23.880]  existed before we got there.
[43:23.880 --> 43:28.680]  I would also note that the Neocons and the Bush administration always said that these
[43:28.680 --> 43:33.160]  irregular forces, these insurgents, were coming across from Syria.
[43:33.160 --> 43:37.200]  And I was told by very good sources that they were coming from Saudi Arabia.
[43:37.200 --> 43:42.040]  That was the border that they were crossing, and not Syria, because they needed an excuse
[43:42.040 --> 43:48.680]  to try to hit Damascus and occupy Syria after they did that to Iraq.
[43:48.680 --> 43:53.920]  Wayne Madsen, this is just, just adds to the mountain of evidence.
[43:53.920 --> 43:55.280]  I mean, you're an expert on this.
[43:55.280 --> 43:59.320]  When you go back and talk about with Brzezinski, and he's written two books bragging about
[43:59.320 --> 44:05.600]  it himself, bragging how they use these Wahhabis mainly, but you're saying also Shiites, there's
[44:05.600 --> 44:11.200]  evidence to always stage events all over the world to destabilize their topple governments.
[44:11.200 --> 44:16.760]  And tie that into what happened in Basra with the SAS caught dressed up as a Wahhabis running
[44:16.760 --> 44:19.760]  around shooting at British and Iraqi forces.
[44:19.760 --> 44:20.760]  Right.
[44:20.760 --> 44:25.520]  And I would also note that today in the Financial Times, Brzezinski's got a column where he's
[44:25.520 --> 44:31.120]  urging Obama to take a tough stance when he meets with the President Medvedev in Moscow
[44:31.120 --> 44:32.240]  very soon.
[44:32.240 --> 44:37.720]  And I would note that we were also behind some of the Chechen drills that were attacking
[44:37.720 --> 44:43.400]  Russian forces in that country that were linked to Turkey, which is a NATO country, and also
[44:43.400 --> 44:44.560]  to Saudi Arabia.
[44:44.560 --> 44:51.320]  So this not only happened in Iraq, but also in Bosnia and Chechnya.
[44:51.320 --> 44:58.320]  And I was recently told that by another credible source that there are now election monitors
[44:58.320 --> 45:04.040]  in Afghanistan from Bosnia, some of these people were linked to the Bosnian Muslim forces,
[45:04.040 --> 45:09.320]  some of whom were working quite closely with bin Laden when he was active in that Bosnian
[45:09.320 --> 45:10.320]  civil war.
[45:10.320 --> 45:14.800]  You know, we've got Bosnians going to Afghanistan, Taliban going to Iraq.
[45:14.800 --> 45:19.680]  It looks like, you know, some people just been playing some pretty bloody games here.
[45:19.680 --> 45:23.120]  Without getting too much into your sources, I mean, most of this has already made stream
[45:23.120 --> 45:24.120]  news.
[45:24.120 --> 45:25.960]  This is just another case that you're going over.
[45:25.960 --> 45:29.760]  And I've talked to the troops that have talked about how they catch or kill these Wahhabis
[45:29.760 --> 45:34.640]  and then get in trouble and are told to stop it and the Marines have caught Israelis and
[45:34.640 --> 45:38.520]  others as well carrying out these type of attacks dressed up like Arabs.
[45:38.520 --> 45:44.840]  But the big question here is, why are you being given more of this information now?
[45:44.840 --> 45:47.880]  Is this coming from military people, intelligence people?
[45:47.880 --> 45:49.200]  Are they angry?
[45:49.200 --> 45:50.600]  Are the troops angry?
[45:50.600 --> 45:56.520]  How many of the troops know that the entire terror threat is basically manufactured?
[45:56.520 --> 46:02.040]  Well, a lot of them, I think a lot of them do, I would add another to the mix.
[46:02.040 --> 46:05.640]  These private security contractors have gotten a bumlap.
[46:05.640 --> 46:10.520]  Look, in some cases, like with Blackwater, they deserve it, but not all of them are bad
[46:10.520 --> 46:11.520]  people.
[46:11.520 --> 46:12.520]  They saw this firsthand.
[46:12.520 --> 46:15.920]  A lot of these are ex-military activity types themselves.
[46:15.920 --> 46:22.240]  They saw it, and they're really upset with what's going on now, what they saw, and you
[46:22.240 --> 46:26.880]  know, just the fact that the U.S. looked the other way, and in some cases, actively promoted
[46:26.880 --> 46:27.880]  this violence.
[46:27.880 --> 46:32.240]  But, I mean, take the British S.A.S. troops I've got on screen right there.
[46:32.240 --> 46:36.080]  It's Paul's first article at Prison Planet, but it then came out in the times of London
[46:36.080 --> 46:40.240]  that indeed they were doing this, and they were caught by Iraqi police, and then there
[46:40.240 --> 46:44.720]  was an attack with tanks against the police station to free them.
[46:44.720 --> 46:46.400]  How do you get an S.A.S. officer?
[46:46.400 --> 46:52.440]  I know S.A.S. officers got caught running the IRA and staging a lot of attacks as a pretext
[46:52.440 --> 46:58.120]  of continued occupation of Ireland, but how do you get U.S. forces, British forces, Israeli
[46:58.120 --> 47:02.400]  forces, to bring in Taliban and al-Qaeda to kill our own troops?
[47:02.400 --> 47:07.200]  I mean, that is just, I guess these are just total sociopaths?
[47:07.200 --> 47:08.200]  I'm not sure they all are.
[47:08.200 --> 47:12.760]  Some of them, obviously, didn't know the difference between right and wrong, but what steps that
[47:12.760 --> 47:18.160]  we know with the torture cases and the murder of a detainee, the orders were coming from
[47:18.160 --> 47:19.160]  very high.
[47:19.160 --> 47:22.320]  They were coming out of Cheney's office, they were coming out of Rumsfeld's office,
[47:22.320 --> 47:25.440]  so if you're given an order, you know, you face two options.
[47:25.440 --> 47:30.040]  You either follow the order or you get tagged as a whistleblower and you may wind up as
[47:30.040 --> 47:31.040]  a victim yourself.
[47:31.040 --> 47:33.320]  Yeah, we know, they fragged.
[47:33.320 --> 47:37.760]  How many army investigators and marine investigators, just of corruption, have been killed?
[47:37.760 --> 47:39.520]  I lost count.
[47:39.520 --> 47:44.360]  The worst one, of course, was Colonel Ted Weston who was the top ethics professor at
[47:44.360 --> 47:50.920]  West Point who brought up issues about the fraud with a contractor and they said he shot
[47:50.920 --> 47:54.280]  himself to death right before he was supposed to come back to the United States.
[47:54.280 --> 47:59.120]  I talked to his family and they told me they said, flat out, that did not happen with Colonel
[47:59.120 --> 48:00.120]  Weston.
[48:00.120 --> 48:02.040]  He's just one of many.
[48:02.040 --> 48:04.280]  Here's the question, Wayne, are the criminals winning?
[48:04.280 --> 48:06.840]  We know they shipped in tens of billions in cash.
[48:06.840 --> 48:08.920]  They gave privates 30 grand a year.
[48:08.920 --> 48:13.920]  They gave colonels millions a year, generals untold amount to be part of the corruption.
[48:13.920 --> 48:18.440]  Then they said, now do these dirty deeds for no money or we're going to burn you.
[48:18.440 --> 48:23.640]  Has that corruption they tried to work, has that been successful in turning our military
[48:23.640 --> 48:27.000]  into a complete demon force to now be used here domestically?
[48:27.000 --> 48:32.480]  Well, they prosecuted a few of these con men and these fraudsters, but not many.
[48:32.480 --> 48:37.200]  When you look at the amount of money when they were kicking around bundles with a hundred
[48:37.200 --> 48:41.880]  dollar bills, we don't know where all that money went, but we know it was billions involved
[48:41.880 --> 48:46.320]  and we still have no effort to go after the people at the top.
[48:46.320 --> 48:50.560]  The burning mood ops and the skillings that were involved in this fraud have never really
[48:50.560 --> 48:51.960]  been brought to justice.
[48:51.960 --> 48:59.640]  I've never seen a CEO, one of these contracting organizations, from KBR, Halliburton, to Kaki
[48:59.640 --> 49:03.200]  and the rest prosecuted.
[49:03.200 --> 49:07.960]  In closing, Wayne, we appreciate you spending time with us once you have a great Fourth of
[49:07.960 --> 49:12.480]  July coming up for the Republic.
[49:12.480 --> 49:17.040]  When you get attacked for going on Russia today and breaking this news, I just want
[49:17.040 --> 49:19.240]  to point out that people attacking are completely ignorant.
[49:19.240 --> 49:26.280]  I mean, it's all over the news, the airlift of evil flying Taliban out to menace Pakistan
[49:26.280 --> 49:27.680]  now to destabilize them.
[49:27.680 --> 49:33.520]  I mean, it is really a open secret that radical jihadis work for the globalist.
[49:33.520 --> 49:35.680]  I mean, what do you say to your critics?
[49:35.680 --> 49:36.680]  They're just ignorant.
[49:36.680 --> 49:41.160]  Well, listen, if they want to wallow in their ignorance, that's fine.
[49:41.160 --> 49:43.120]  I would say I don't think all of them are ignorant.
[49:43.120 --> 49:48.920]  Some of them are actually, I've felt this all along when I break stories like this.
[49:48.920 --> 49:55.160]  You know, the attacks are coming from the usual suspects, the neocon think tanks, the
[49:55.160 --> 49:57.960]  Soros funded media outlets, I'm used to it.
[49:57.960 --> 50:02.720]  I got a thick skin when it comes to this, you know, but if they want to, if people want
[50:02.720 --> 50:04.000]  to be ignorant, that's one thing.
[50:04.000 --> 50:10.600]  But I think a lot of this criticism is coming from people who are just paid disinformation
[50:10.600 --> 50:12.000]  artists and provocateurs.
[50:12.000 --> 50:17.680]  Well, we know the Intel Center got caught uploading Al Qaeda videos with the Al Qaeda
[50:17.680 --> 50:21.360]  logo in the same video layer as the Intel Center's logo.
[50:21.360 --> 50:24.360]  And these are former black ops chiefs from the Pentagon and CIA.
[50:24.360 --> 50:29.320]  I mean, the secrets getting out of who really runs Al Qaeda and who's really killing our
[50:29.320 --> 50:30.560]  people.
[50:30.560 --> 50:32.260]  And I just appreciate your courage, Wayne.
[50:32.260 --> 50:33.260]  Have a great weekend.
[50:33.260 --> 50:34.260]  You too.
[50:34.260 --> 50:35.260]  Thank you.
[50:35.260 --> 50:36.260]  All right.
[50:36.260 --> 50:37.260]  There goes Wayne Madson.
[50:37.260 --> 50:39.200]  Paul Watson's doing a big detailed report kind of the history of this.
[50:39.200 --> 50:42.600]  All mainstream news, but all a piece here, a piece there.
[50:42.600 --> 50:46.680]  He's coming up the next couple of segments to run through some of the history of this.
[50:46.680 --> 50:51.960]  Then we're going to open the phones up for all of you out there on this, what feels like
[50:51.960 --> 50:52.960]  a Friday edition.
[50:52.960 --> 50:53.960]  I'm going to be here live tomorrow.

[51:00.720 --> 51:05.440]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground
[51:05.440 --> 51:06.760]  up shells?
[51:06.760 --> 51:07.760]  Think about that.
[51:07.760 --> 51:10.560]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[51:10.560 --> 51:13.680]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[51:13.680 --> 51:18.800]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Choose for Health, a delicious tasting
[51:18.800 --> 51:23.960]  chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.

[51:29.800 --> 51:31.280]  The choice is yours.

[52:00.600 --> 52:02.040]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.

[52:05.800 --> 52:07.400]  and struggling to make payments.
[52:07.400 --> 52:11.880]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number, due to a declining economy and credit
[52:11.880 --> 52:12.880]  crisis.

[52:17.880 --> 52:19.480]  by calling the bailout group.

[52:26.720 --> 52:30.400]  Folks if you are struggling with credit card debt and those excessive interest payments,

[53:01.600 --> 53:06.200]  Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing
[53:06.200 --> 53:10.160]  the US and the world, and for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need
[53:10.160 --> 53:11.560]  for preparedness.
[53:11.560 --> 53:16.040]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated
[53:16.040 --> 53:18.040]  foods for almost 40 years.

[53:22.720 --> 53:27.600]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with doubly-nammeled cans and nitrogen

[54:20.600 --> 54:24.960]  a great way to be walking billboards to get the truth out about the globalist takeover
[54:24.960 --> 54:31.440]  and that people are waking up to it and fighting it and HR 1207 now with, what did I hear last
[54:31.440 --> 54:32.440]  night?
[54:32.440 --> 54:41.200]  249 sponsors, look at that, infowars.com, great new design that Jenae Meadows did, Jenae
[54:41.200 --> 54:42.200]  is just awesome.
[54:42.200 --> 54:47.080]  Got the Minuteman down in the lower left and right hand corner, got the Minuteman down
[54:47.080 --> 54:55.920]  at the bottom, says save the USA, infowars.com and the country is being captured by the globalist
[54:55.920 --> 54:56.920]  right now.
[54:56.920 --> 55:02.040]  I mean, we really are falling to the new world order, look at that, infowars.com Minuteman
[55:02.040 --> 55:07.880]  on the back and it's kind of got that 70's retro look, you cannot beat this design, it's

[55:30.000 --> 55:35.320]  of July resolution to wake up somebody every week, to reach out to somebody every day.
[55:35.320 --> 55:39.120]  So get the books and videos at infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[55:39.120 --> 55:43.360]  Okay, for a couple of seconds we're going to have Paul Watson on, then open phones throughout
[55:43.360 --> 55:47.720]  the transmission today and a bunch of other news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[55:47.720 --> 55:52.760]  I told you it's in the bill, the subsections, people are going over the 30 hundred pages,
[55:52.760 --> 55:57.760]  home inspections, Austin already passed that, they're already having the counties and cities
[55:57.760 --> 56:02.280]  do it, home, the bastards are going to be in all our houses and if we don't, they're
[56:02.280 --> 56:06.360]  going to send armed police, they're coming, the control freaks are here, that's the whole
[56:06.360 --> 56:11.360]  carbon tax bill, this is the Soviet Union but not Soviet Union for the people as the
[56:11.360 --> 56:15.040]  communists push it, big bankers making all of us slaves.
[56:15.040 --> 56:20.040]  Paul Watson, you got a big report coming out in the next 30 minutes or so at prisonplanet.com
[56:20.040 --> 56:26.880]  boiling down the history of Taliban, al-Qaeda and other Muslim terror groups openly working
[56:26.880 --> 56:32.360]  for the U.S., Israel and England and then now more and more confirmed reports added
[56:32.360 --> 56:38.800]  to all the others of special forces aiding and abetting al-Qaeda and Taliban.
[56:38.800 --> 56:48.040]  That's right, Alex, and the latest thing that came out on this subject is a former
[56:48.040 --> 56:56.320]  Taliban chief who was allied to the Taliban, the same Taliban tribe that was blamed for
[56:56.320 --> 57:04.120]  the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, he defected from this tribe after he said they were carrying
[57:04.120 --> 57:09.040]  out mosques, bombings and killing civilians and he came out and said that this tribe was
[57:09.040 --> 57:16.560]  working directly with the U.S. intelligence establishment to destabilize Pakistan and
[57:16.560 --> 57:22.520]  a few days after that he was shot dead, so this is coming from a former Taliban member
[57:22.520 --> 57:27.400]  who defected because they were carrying out bombings and killing civilians and he said
[57:27.400 --> 57:32.280]  they were working with the CIA and he wound up dead a few days later.
[57:32.280 --> 57:34.760]  So that ties into what?
[57:34.760 --> 57:41.880]  Oh, I forgot about that one that just happened, but we have SAS, British Special Air Services,
[57:41.880 --> 57:47.200]  caught running around with fake beards, machine gunning and bombing troops in Iraq saying
[57:47.200 --> 57:52.560]  they're, I mean, this is saying Iran's doing it, I mean, it's wrong to kill our troops
[57:52.560 --> 57:57.320]  and I know that's not patriotic nowadays to not blow up our own troops and I'm sorry
[57:57.320 --> 58:00.040]  if the military hates me because I don't want to kill you.
[58:00.040 --> 58:02.760]  I can't believe it's turned into this, Paul.
[58:02.760 --> 58:08.240]  Well, I mean, we've warned ever since the war began just after it finished that the
[58:08.240 --> 58:15.000]  agenda was not to make the country peaceful and stable, it was to create chaos and to
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.720]  vulcanize the country and break it off into small pieces and that's been the plan since
[58:19.720 --> 58:20.720]  the 80s at least.
[58:20.720 --> 58:23.720]  You're a real expert on this, stay there.
[58:23.720 --> 58:28.160]  I'm going to come back, I'm going to sit back, watch and run through the history of how Al-Qaeda,
[58:28.160 --> 58:32.360]  Taliban and some of the Shiite as well are the sore of the new world order.
[58:32.360 --> 58:36.200]  More and more I realize they are the key, they're going to use those these guys that
[58:36.200 --> 58:42.600]  he stabilized and take over the planet, stay with us.
[58:42.600 --> 58:50.680]  Thank you for listening to GCN, be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:50.680 --> 58:55.120]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[58:55.120 --> 58:56.120]  this summer.
[58:56.120 --> 59:00.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[59:00.000 --> 59:04.560]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[59:04.560 --> 59:05.800]  allows you to have.
[59:05.800 --> 59:10.960]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[59:10.960 --> 59:15.560]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded especially
[59:15.560 --> 59:17.500]  with the high demand summer months ahead.
[59:17.500 --> 59:21.040]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[59:21.040 --> 59:24.720]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[59:24.720 --> 59:29.240]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[59:29.240 --> 59:33.400]  Folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from science,
[59:33.400 --> 59:35.080]  a long time sponsor of ours.
[59:35.080 --> 59:42.640]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com, remember the government
[59:42.640 --> 59:44.120]  doesn't own the sun yet.

[59:53.440 --> 1:00:05.200]  Raging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.200 --> 1:00:09.960]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:09.960 --> 1:00:10.960]  You want answers?
[1:00:10.960 --> 1:00:20.400]  Well so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas,
[1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:24.400]  Alex Jones.
[1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:31.400]  Your phone calls are coming up out broadcast today, I've got stacks of off the chart important
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:32.400]  news.
[1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:37.160]  The feds are going to grab hundreds of parks in California, that states completely imploding
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:40.000]  by design.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:44.400]  Open home inspections of your houses by the control freak brigades under the green bill.
[1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:49.040]  They're saying it's going to go ahead and pass the Senate probably, that's in Bloomberg.
[1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:53.720]  The health care bill, no one's allowed to see it, Obama won't give details, he's been
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:56.120]  caught lying about everything, it's just getting crazy.
[1:00:56.120 --> 1:01:01.920]  Paul Watson continuing with this hidden and plain view that Taliban al-Qaeda are used to
[1:01:01.920 --> 1:01:06.160]  attack Iran, they're used to attack our troops in Iraq, they're used to attack and destabilize
[1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:13.080]  the Pakistanis, they were flown out after the Afghan takeover by the CIA in 2001-2002,
[1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:17.520]  that's on record, the airlift of Ebel flying them out, the general's getting mad.
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:22.640]  I mean when are we going to admit that these Muslim extremists are the pretext to destabilize
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:26.680]  and take over countries and then they pull out and the globalists have a pretext to go
[1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:31.560]  in and take things over, that the globalists have bought off these tribal warlords and
[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:34.840]  that they've got these cult-like followers that'll do whatever they're told in these
[1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:40.080]  clans and if we don't wake up and they keep using these people to scare us into submission
[1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:46.080]  and kill our troops, I mean this is outrageously asinine that then we're bad for reporting
[1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:47.720]  the facts here.
[1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:56.440]  It's amazing Alex, I mean it's on the record that these terrorists, these al-Qaeda, whatever
[1:01:56.440 --> 1:02:03.360]  you want to call them, they've been moved around the globe since the end of the 70s
[1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:09.560]  to every single area where the United States has a war and where the CIA needs their help
[1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:18.640]  in destabilizing a country. From the Afghanistan war, they were moved to Bosnia just after
[1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:25.080]  the war started in Bosnia in 1992 to help with that campaign, then after that ended
[1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:35.640]  in 95, following the NATO bombing of Serbia and Yugoslavia in 99, they were hired then
[1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:41.880]  to train the KLA, the Kosovo Liberation Army, and the ethnic Albanian to...
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:46.840]  All on record, none of this is our opinion folks, go ahead.
[1:02:46.840 --> 1:02:54.520]  There's a headline out of the National Post, Canada, US supported al-Qaeda cells during
[1:02:54.520 --> 1:03:00.880]  Balkan wars and that runs through the evidence of how they moved them from Afghanistan to
[1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:07.640]  Bosnia to Serbia and now they've moved them back to Afghanistan and then Pakistan in the
[1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:08.640]  time since.
[1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:15.080]  Meanwhile, all these David Horowitz neocons get up and say give up all your rights, al-Qaeda
[1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:20.440]  will get you, they all know good and well, this is such a sick joke how on the chess
[1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:25.880]  board this key piece is used to menace everybody into going along with the new world order.
[1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:31.080]  That's right, they're the pawns of the new world order on the chess board.
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:38.520]  You've got Iran, which is another situation altogether in the covert black operation
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:43.920]  which was put in place to destabilize Iran and achieve regime change.
[1:03:43.920 --> 1:03:47.320]  This was leaked in 2007.
[1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:54.200]  It was announced that the CIA would be funding the Iranian militant group, Jundullah, which
[1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:58.400]  has carried out terrorist attacks in Iran to destabilize Iran.
[1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:04.520]  This group was formally headed by the alleged, obviously we know he wasn't the mastermind
[1:04:04.520 --> 1:04:06.400]  but he was one of the pastives.
[1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:11.760]  The alleged 9-11 mastermind, the person that the US government has masterminded 9-11, Khalid
[1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:18.120]  Sheikh Mohammed, he was the leader of this organization and now the CIA is funding it
[1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:27.720]  to carry out attacks in Iran, notably an attack on May 29 right before this whole controversy
[1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:34.320]  about the Iranian election happened where a mosque was bombed in Iran that killed 25
[1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:38.120]  people and it turned out that Jundullah were behind it.
[1:04:38.120 --> 1:04:39.120]  Stay there.
[1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:41.840]  Let's do five more minutes and finish up with this on the other side then your phone
[1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:42.840]  calls.
[1:04:42.840 --> 1:04:47.320]  Paul Watson, he's the editor and chief over at PrisonPlanet.com.
[1:04:47.320 --> 1:04:51.880]  He's with us and he's doing a big master article about all this that will be up the
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:56.880]  next hour where it just shows the mainstream news, CIA's admission.
[1:04:56.880 --> 1:04:57.880]  This is a fact.
[1:04:57.880 --> 1:05:00.320]  Now Haida is New World Order.
[1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:01.680]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:03.720]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[1:05:03.720 --> 1:05:04.720]  Well you should.
[1:05:04.720 --> 1:05:09.240]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[1:05:09.240 --> 1:05:10.240]  That's right.
[1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:15.000]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:18.600]  Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.

[1:05:27.200 --> 1:05:31.280]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels
[1:05:31.280 --> 1:05:34.360]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:38.760]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor
[1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:39.840]  attitudes.

[1:06:00.560 --> 1:06:01.560]  Hello friends.

[1:06:02.560 --> 1:06:06.040]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:07.040]  important than ever.
[1:06:07.040 --> 1:06:09.800]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.

[1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:16.800]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:20.760]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in
[1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:22.360]  the final equation but you.

[1:06:56.480 --> 1:07:00.720]  The first step is getting storable food.

[1:07:09.120 --> 1:07:10.120]  of dollars.

[1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:00.600]  Call today.
[1:08:00.600 --> 1:08:06.520]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:08.520]  a war on for your mind.
[1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:16.000]  Even if you're a good old boy who's been in black ops and staged air attacks to beat
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:22.080]  the commies 34 years ago, you should know things are out of control.
[1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:26.560]  The looting, the stealing, the grabbing the pension funds, the killing our own troops,
[1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:31.520]  firing al-Qaeda, using them in the Balkans in the early 90s and the late 90s against
[1:08:31.520 --> 1:08:36.880]  Serbia, using them in Africa, using them against the Russians in 79, staging the attacks to
[1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:39.040]  bring them in to get the war going.
[1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:44.560]  Brzezinski brags, Russia didn't invade, it was started with them.
[1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:49.160]  We get head on 9-11, they have the staged attacks, the Taliban and al-Qaeda would tell
[1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:55.880]  young people get in the front line, then the U.S. would shelve the front lines and not
[1:08:55.880 --> 1:08:59.840]  the main emplacements and the troops wondered why, then they would go pick up the Taliban
[1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:04.480]  and al-Qaeda, pay them, the troops, all witnesses, this was in San Francisco Chronicle, times
[1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:08.920]  of London, headline, air lift of evil, that Google air lift of evil, flying Taliban out
[1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:09.920]  to safety.
[1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:13.880]  I know Paul is doing a story, but let's put that original times of London up for people.
[1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:17.680]  All flown out over the mountains into Pakistan, they'd done their job of playing the part
[1:09:17.680 --> 1:09:18.680]  of boogeyman.
[1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:25.760]  Now they start the new attack on the Pakistani government to destabilize it to where any
[1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:30.040]  time the globalists want, they can overthrow that nation and have a crisis, then diminish
[1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:33.320]  India and China.
[1:09:33.320 --> 1:09:37.360]  So it's the grand chess board and Brzezinski and others write books bragging how they're
[1:09:37.360 --> 1:09:38.360]  doing this.
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:39.360]  This is all public.
[1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:42.280]  It's very, very funny to them.
[1:09:42.280 --> 1:09:46.400]  Now Paul, you were going through some of the latest history of this and some of the other
[1:09:46.400 --> 1:09:47.840]  points in a big article.
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:51.240]  Do you know the title of this master article you're going to put out when I say master
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:55.440]  article is going to have kind of the whole history in there, kind of a lexicon or encyclopedia
[1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:56.440]  of this?
[1:09:56.440 --> 1:09:58.000]  When is that going up today at prismplina.com?
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.960]  It's going to go up as soon as I've had my dinner, I think.
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:03.960]  Okay, good.
[1:10:03.960 --> 1:10:05.960]  It's taking a while to put together.
[1:10:05.960 --> 1:10:06.960]  Absolutely.
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:08.520]  Now I'm going to sit back for five minutes.
[1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:11.440]  Start at the beginning, because you've been interrupted a few times by breaks.
[1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:16.840]  Start at the beginning of what Al Qaeda, Taliban are used for worldwide, who they are, and
[1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:18.800]  just run through the gamut of what they're doing.
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:23.920]  And then that data article will be up there at, I know it's already midnight over there
[1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:28.760]  where you're at, so it'll be up there about, I guess, one o'clock Greenwich mean time about,
[1:10:28.760 --> 1:10:29.760]  but go ahead.
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:33.800]  No, actually, I guess it'll be up about seven or eight o'clock Greenwich mean time.
[1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:34.800]  Go ahead.
[1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:40.400]  Well, it's 10 past six now, so yeah, probably about eight o'clock.
[1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:44.520]  Al Qaeda, the Taliban, all these groups, and it's not all one group, obviously Al Qaeda
[1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:51.240]  is a Western creation, the name is, but all these Sunni extremist terrorist groups are
[1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:56.600]  the pawns of the New World Order, they moved around the global chessboard to the different
[1:10:56.600 --> 1:11:01.760]  countries where the New World Order wants to destabilize governments and initiate regime
[1:11:01.760 --> 1:11:02.760]  change.
[1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:07.480]  It's funny, because there's a board game called The War on Terror, which has come out in the
[1:11:07.480 --> 1:11:08.920]  last few years.
[1:11:08.920 --> 1:11:15.920]  And in the game, you can play as the New World Empire and you have to maneuver terrorists
[1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:21.120]  around on this map of the world and you can only invade countries where your terrorists
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:24.920]  are on the border of that country, so you have to move them into that country.
[1:11:24.920 --> 1:11:29.200]  So they're even throwing it in our face with that huge board game being promoted all over
[1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:30.200]  TV with ads.
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:34.760]  You're saying even in that, it's the New World Order Empire and Al Qaeda is the fiery
[1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:37.560]  sword of absolute victory.
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:43.360]  You hire the Al Qaeda and move them into different countries, but it's based on fact, because
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:50.960]  we've just mentioned from being in Afghanistan to fight the Soviets, they then move them
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:55.040]  into Bosnia in 1992 to fight that war.
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:12:00.760]  After that, they were moved into Serbia, Yugoslavia to fight that war and to train the KLA, the
[1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:05.760]  Albanians, were trained in Afghanistan by a solid involved and with the help of the CIA.
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:07.400]  That's on the record.
[1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:13.280]  And then after that, they were moved back into Afghanistan for the attack after 9-11.
[1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:17.880]  And now they've been moved into Pakistan and along the line, you see the fingerprints
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:24.920]  of their activities also there in Iran under the auspices of John Duller, which was announced
[1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:32.520]  in the 2007 White House program to destabilize Iran, that they would be funding John Duller,
[1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:38.640]  which is an Iranian militant terrorist group formerly led by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:46.320]  And in fact, just yesterday in an Iranian court case, a guy called Abdul Hamid Rigi,
[1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:52.280]  who was described as a senior member of the John Duller terrorist group, confessed in
[1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:59.120]  court that the group had been trained and financed by the U.S. and the Zionists.
[1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:04.240]  So he's there admitting in court that they're getting funding from the CIA in Israel.
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:07.800]  And that was announced by the White House itself, but it's not as if it's some kind
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:10.760]  of confession obtained from torture.
[1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:13.160]  He's saying it in an Iranian courtroom.
[1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:19.800]  Let's be clear, Israeli papers admit this, British papers, U.S., none of this is even
[1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:20.800]  our opinion.
[1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:27.720]  Well, and then you've got the Taliban, the former Taliban member, the defector saying
[1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:32.960]  that he got out because he found out it was all being run by the CIA in Israel and that
[1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:36.880]  they were killing civilians in order to destabilize countries.
[1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:41.040]  He got out, he said that, and three days later he was shot dead.
[1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:46.720]  So you've got defectors coming out, you've got members coming out and saying this.
[1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:51.320]  And then you have the actual events that have their fingerprints all over them, the Mosque
[1:13:51.320 --> 1:13:57.960]  bombing in Iran on May 29th, just before the election controversy in Iran.
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:04.600]  You've got the Samara Mosque bombing in Iraq in February 2006, which had all the fingerprints
[1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:05.760]  of an inside job.
[1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:10.480]  Well, that was in mainstream news that U.S. and British forces went in for hours, wired
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:13.760]  the building in front of everybody and blew it up and said, I'll kind of did it.
[1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:14.760]  Yeah.
[1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:19.120]  I mean, that's even Ray McGovern said that that was, it was obvious that they did it
[1:14:19.120 --> 1:14:20.120]  basically.
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:25.840]  And for what reason, I mean, you've got this propaganda about Iraqis regaining their sovereignty
[1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:30.640]  just because some U.S. troops have pulled out the cities, which by the way, if there's
[1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:36.000]  any kind of emergency, all the Iraqi puppet government does is ask them for help and they
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:37.800]  come right back in.
[1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:42.960]  You've got at least 55 fully operational military bases, U.S. military bases throughout
[1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:43.960]  the whole country.
[1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:49.480]  You've still got 130,000 U.S. military personnel that will remain.
[1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:54.880]  And the top commanders have said on the record that even after the supposed full withdrawal
[1:14:54.880 --> 1:14:59.800]  date, which is set to be sometime in 2011, that they're not going anywhere.
[1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:01.120]  Of course, they're not going to pull out.
[1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:02.120]  They've captured the country.
[1:15:02.120 --> 1:15:04.280]  It's a launch pad for their future wars.
[1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:09.640]  And they need it to be unstable to a certain extent to give them justification to remain.
[1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:12.680]  And that was always the public plan.
[1:15:12.680 --> 1:15:17.600]  You know, you have the public plan for the military, not really public to the general
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:22.400]  public, though it's declassified, that they plan to use it and always stay there and break
[1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:26.600]  it in three regional parts controlled by a U.S. controlled central government.
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:29.240]  And now they just move on down the chessboard.
[1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:33.000]  And if Americans need to be angry and think we need to stay there, they'll blow up a few
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:37.600]  U.S. troops with the imaginary guys with big beards and turbines who openly are brought
[1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:38.600]  in by the government.
[1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:39.600]  I mean, it's sick.
[1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:40.600]  Yeah.
[1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:47.080]  And they'll create media events to reinforce it in people's minds that it's a black and
[1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:52.480]  white situation, that there's good guys and bad guys like this U.S. soldier that's supposedly
[1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:58.040]  being captured today by the Taliban, and the Taliban are working with the U.S. to do all
[1:15:58.040 --> 1:15:59.040]  this.
[1:15:59.040 --> 1:16:05.680]  I mean, you've also got the M.K.L., the Mojahedin Calc Organization, which was trained in Iraq
[1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:12.360]  and is now being used by the CIA in Iran and was used with these recent riots and protests
[1:16:12.360 --> 1:16:13.600]  to radicalize that.
[1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:19.400]  Well, that's my point is the White House is on record funding Wahhabi al-Qaeda, number
[1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:21.760]  three in al-Qaeda, to attack Iran.
[1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:26.960]  And they think our public's so dumb, they say Iran is al-Qaeda and attacking Iraq when
[1:16:26.960 --> 1:16:34.800]  Iran's a Shiite system, the opposite of al-Qaeda, the opposite of Wahhabi, the opposite of Sunni.
[1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:41.200]  And they're on record with British SAS staging terror attacks in the times of London, caught
[1:16:41.200 --> 1:16:43.640]  attacking bases in Basra.
[1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:48.040]  And it's just on record, this is all staged.
[1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:50.440]  And the public needs to understand that.
[1:16:50.440 --> 1:16:55.920]  It's tough though, Alex, when a good portion of them don't even know who the vice president
[1:16:55.920 --> 1:16:58.160]  is to explain all these things, isn't it?
[1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:03.240]  I mean, that's what benefits the Anglo-American establishment in all this.
[1:17:03.240 --> 1:17:05.760]  People can only understand it in black and white terms.
[1:17:05.760 --> 1:17:12.480]  Well, Paul, where are they from your study planning to use their al-Qaeda brigades to
[1:17:12.480 --> 1:17:13.960]  destabilize areas?
[1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:16.280]  We know they want Pakistan under their control.
[1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:18.240]  They're menacing the legitimate government.
[1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:22.200]  When the president was being confronted on NBC, the president of Pakistan a few weeks
[1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:24.160]  ago, we played the clip here.
[1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:26.400]  The reporters said, why are you funding al-Qaeda and Taliban?
[1:17:26.400 --> 1:17:29.360]  The guy laughed and said, they've always worked for you.
[1:17:29.360 --> 1:17:31.360]  You've got them trying to overthrow our government right now.
[1:17:31.360 --> 1:17:32.720]  How dare you?
[1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:36.400]  And the reporter kind of just shut up and looked embarrassed because the reporters all
[1:17:36.400 --> 1:17:37.400]  know this.
[1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:40.720]  This is such a sick joke.
[1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:46.960]  They use these people in Serbia, in Africa, in Asia, just all over the place.
[1:17:46.960 --> 1:17:49.360]  They use them here to take all our liberties and freedoms.
[1:17:49.360 --> 1:17:54.200]  And on record, they're being protected by the U.S. government, and the biggest piece
[1:17:54.200 --> 1:18:00.320]  of evidence is the airlift of evil, AP, London Guardian, UPI, flying them out at the end
[1:18:00.320 --> 1:18:05.000]  of the Afghan takeover, 2002, generals would catch them, and they'd say, oh, they actually
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:18.800]  worked for us, and the CIA would order them paid, put on C-130s, and flown out to Pakistan.
[1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:23.520]  And no, you guys put another Times of London article up, that's a 2007 about rendition.
[1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:29.200]  The headline is, Airlift of Evil, Paul, have it in his story, go ahead and close it.
[1:18:29.200 --> 1:18:30.200]  MSNBC.
[1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:32.440]  MSNBC's got it too.
[1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:34.320]  Try MSNBC, Airlift of Evil.
[1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:36.480]  Go ahead, Paul, closing comments on this.
[1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:42.480]  Well, as everyone seems to say, the ultimate goal is to get on the border with China, and
[1:18:42.480 --> 1:18:47.640]  China was concerned that that would be done through the U.S. supporting South Korea in
[1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:52.840]  attacking North Korea, but they've already got their terrorists in Pakistan, which is
[1:18:52.840 --> 1:18:57.760]  bordered with China, albeit in the Tibetan region, but it's bordered with China.
[1:18:57.760 --> 1:19:04.920]  So the CIA has already got their men on the border with China, and that could be the next
[1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:10.640]  destabilization campaign in the next 10 years or so after they've wrapped up Pakistan in
[1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:14.480]  Iran, which is their current theater of operations, obviously.
[1:19:14.480 --> 1:19:17.680]  And human life means nothing to the globalists.
[1:19:17.680 --> 1:19:18.680]  It's all cold-blooded.
[1:19:18.680 --> 1:19:19.680]  How do we win?
[1:19:19.680 --> 1:19:22.880]  Oh, we blow up our own troops and say the Muslims did it, so we have a pretext to stay
[1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:23.880]  there.
[1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:27.200]  And the troops go, I love the government killing me, it's freedom.
[1:19:27.200 --> 1:19:29.760]  And we need to get this information out to people.
[1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:31.280]  Well, great job, Paul.
[1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:35.280]  And again, we'll be looking for that article up at PrismPlanet.com the next few hours.
[1:19:35.280 --> 1:19:36.280]  Thanks, Mike.
[1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:37.280]  You bet.
[1:19:37.280 --> 1:19:43.760]  I can imagine a headline, Western governments funding al-Qaeda to kill U.S. troops.
[1:19:43.760 --> 1:19:48.360]  The history of radical Muslims working for the West to destabilize the planet.
[1:19:48.360 --> 1:19:49.760]  I think that'd be a good headline.
[1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:52.680]  Well, come back, go to your phone calls, big news blitz coming up.
[1:19:52.680 --> 1:19:55.480]  Got another guest in the next hour.
[1:19:55.480 --> 1:19:56.480]  We'll look at Texas independence.
[1:19:56.480 --> 1:19:57.920]  It's really starting to gain steam.
[1:19:57.920 --> 1:19:58.920]  Stay with us.
[1:19:58.920 --> 1:20:03.200]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[1:20:03.200 --> 1:20:07.160]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching, a storm that will affect
[1:20:07.160 --> 1:20:08.560]  you and everybody you know.
[1:20:08.560 --> 1:20:09.560]  Here's the story.
[1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:12.960]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million
[1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:14.240]  new people free care.
[1:20:14.240 --> 1:20:15.480]  Now here's the bad news.
[1:20:15.480 --> 1:20:19.080]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free
[1:20:19.080 --> 1:20:20.880]  services and procedures.
[1:20:20.880 --> 1:20:22.760]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[1:20:22.760 --> 1:20:27.240]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[1:20:27.240 --> 1:20:31.400]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the
[1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:32.960]  healthcare services.
[1:20:32.960 --> 1:20:34.960]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:38.760]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness
[1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:43.640]  course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own
[1:20:43.640 --> 1:20:44.640]  home.
[1:20:44.640 --> 1:20:48.240]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and is flat out the best course
[1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:49.240]  of its kind.
[1:20:49.240 --> 1:20:53.360]  I recommend you visit this important new website at makeherbalmedicines.com.

[1:21:01.680 --> 1:21:06.240]  Hi this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:09.920]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:12.480]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count.
[1:21:12.480 --> 1:21:17.320]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets
[1:21:17.320 --> 1:21:19.400]  and escape the paper markets.
[1:21:19.400 --> 1:21:23.680]  The only real option is precious metals for your retirement, your kids' education or
[1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:28.440]  just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down.
[1:21:28.440 --> 1:21:32.320]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package and I'd like to discuss
[1:21:32.320 --> 1:21:36.120]  a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[1:21:36.120 --> 1:21:46.120]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237 extension 128 that's 800-686-2237 extension 128 and
[1:21:46.120 --> 1:21:50.040]  together we can develop a make sense program before the clock runs out.
[1:21:50.040 --> 1:21:57.120]  Once more John Swenson at 800-686-2237 extension 128 and take charge of your future and thank
[1:21:57.120 --> 1:22:01.120]  you.
[1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:06.600]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:10.120]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:15.880]  It's known as the Builder Bird but their objective being world domination.
[1:22:15.880 --> 1:22:19.040]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:24.960]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:29.400]  of humanity is at hand.
[1:22:29.400 --> 1:22:34.880]  Over the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:38.840]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:22:38.840 --> 1:22:41.400]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:44.560]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[1:22:44.560 --> 1:22:45.560]  They're after power.
[1:22:45.560 --> 1:22:46.560]  That's their happenings.

[1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:00.480]  You have been warned.
[1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:04.080]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary
[1:23:04.080 --> 1:23:05.520]  to maintain good health.
[1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:10.720]  With so many places to choose from, deciding where and what to buy can be a lengthy, frustrating
[1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:11.720]  process.

[1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:47.640]  Good.
[1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:48.640]  Welcome.
[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:52.760]  I just wanted to say you do a great job, I've been listening to you for a long time.
[1:24:52.760 --> 1:24:57.320]  I just wanted to get into a bit of news that's going on in Australia.
[1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:04.280]  Basically, if people go to the ABC.net catalyst, they'll find that Australia is actually making
[1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:11.720]  a universal flu vaccine and they even bloat that it will actually cause a massive immune
[1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:12.720]  response.
[1:25:12.720 --> 1:25:18.840]  I'll talk to Dr. Carly about it and she's looking into it.
[1:25:18.840 --> 1:25:24.440]  I saw that story, how are they going to have a universal flu vaccine that they force everybody
[1:25:24.440 --> 1:25:25.440]  to take?
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:29.760]  They're also saying it's not just universal injection, they're claiming that they have
[1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:35.240]  some new vaccines that are master vaccines or you're going to have to take three vaccines,
[1:25:35.240 --> 1:25:39.600]  but then they admit it's already mutated, it doesn't even protect you, but they're
[1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:41.840]  going to forcibly inject you.
[1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:46.440]  It just makes no sense unless you know it's about eugenics and there's something else
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:48.320]  in there they want to put into you.
[1:25:48.320 --> 1:25:56.080]  Yeah, well, they say that, they even say that it's virtually, it's not even able to do anything
[1:25:56.080 --> 1:26:01.160]  in vaccines, they don't even actually create the immune response to fix it.
[1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:06.640]  And then they say later on that, this will, taking this will give you the immune response,
[1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:13.320]  so they pretty much cancel each other out.
[1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:21.760]  It's amazing, it's now the last seven years and counting that they admit that they got
[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:23.040]  the flu vaccine wrong.
[1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:28.160]  That is they try to guess how it's going to mutate and put kind of a spectrum of different
[1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:32.320]  mutations in there and hope that it gives you some type of immunity, then they admit
[1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:36.800]  it, they haven't gotten it right, it doesn't even protect you and then you can look at
[1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:37.800]  all the studies.
[1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:43.560]  In fact, Google it for folks on screen at prismplanet.tv.
[1:26:43.560 --> 1:26:49.400]  Flu vaccine Alzheimer's and you'll see all the articles and studies where it doubles or
[1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:54.520]  triples or quadruples depending on how many different flu shots you get getting Alzheimer's.
[1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:59.400]  And now they're saying every school child mandatory to take flu shots every year and
[1:26:59.400 --> 1:27:05.400]  then Obama says three flu shots every year when three flu shots doubles your chances
[1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:11.360]  of Alzheimer's and suddenly all these young people are getting juvenile Alzheimer's and
[1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:16.400]  they go, that's normal, you're senile now, you're 12, you know, you're not able to remember
[1:27:16.400 --> 1:27:21.360]  your mommy's name now, that's what old age is, it's all part of the eugenics.
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:25.880]  Now there it is, all the mainstream news, flu shots linked to Alzheimer's and other flu
[1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:30.640]  facts and we'll go over some but there it is on screen for you.
[1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:35.480]  Thank you caller from Australia, just take the shots, you won't remember anybody anymore
[1:27:35.480 --> 1:27:40.400]  if you take enough of them and you can just die of brain damage.
[1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:41.400]  How's that sound?
[1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:47.280]  That would be to prove you love the government and everything's fine, everything's normal.
[1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:52.160]  Chris in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:58.480]  Using the term interdependence that Barack Obama used on June 4th in Cairo, Egypt, he
[1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:05.000]  used it in the context of a world order and the term interdependence most people don't
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  understand, it was written about by the CFR, the Tri-Lateral Commission, David Broderick.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:13.280]  I've got to be honest, I'm having real trouble understanding what you're saying.
[1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:15.280]  Pardon me.
[1:28:15.280 --> 1:28:16.280]  Chris?
[1:28:16.280 --> 1:28:26.880]  Yes, the CFR, Tri-Lateral Commission, David Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger,
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:30.880]  they've all written about interdependence as a pretext of the solution to international
[1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:32.040]  conflicts.
[1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:37.000]  So what Obama said on June 4th in Egypt, he said, quote, given our interdependence,
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:41.240]  any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably
[1:28:41.240 --> 1:28:42.240]  fail.
[1:28:42.240 --> 1:28:46.160]  So whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners of it, our problems must
[1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:47.160]  be dealt with.
[1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:49.760]  Through partnership, progress must be shared, end quote.
[1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:54.480]  And the idea that they write about is that if they can make the regional bloc government
[1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:59.600]  specialize in a certain industry or area, then they won't be able to, or an oligarch,
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:03.660]  for example, or home rule won't be as likely to succeed.
[1:29:03.660 --> 1:29:09.800]  So that's the pretext that they use to fight international conflicts is that if they impose
[1:29:09.800 --> 1:29:15.240]  the interdependence, then well, these nations won't be sovereign or likely to express their
[1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:16.240]  interests.
[1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:17.240]  They've got to make everybody weak.
[1:29:17.240 --> 1:29:21.400]  They've got to have, make them have little wars with each other so nobody gets strong
[1:29:21.400 --> 1:29:26.360]  because if you have a strong Iraq, a strong Serbia, a strong Pakistan, they might actually
[1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:29.120]  be able to have sovereignty and make their own decisions.
[1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:33.600]  But if we can hire al-Qaeda to go destabilize them, then they can fall apart.
[1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:34.600]  Really great point.
[1:29:34.600 --> 1:29:36.600]  Anything else, Chris?
[1:29:36.600 --> 1:29:37.600]  Okay.
[1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:38.600]  Thank you, Chris.
[1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:42.520]  Glad you got off the speakerphone because we really want to be able to hear you guys.

[1:32:58.200 --> 1:33:05.200]  To prove your life today.
[1:33:05.200 --> 1:33:24.880]  Coming up, Len Beck has the CIA operative, the supposed Al-Qaeda hunter on.
[1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:28.920]  They said a nuke needs to go off in America to get the American people's attitude straight
[1:33:28.920 --> 1:33:31.720]  about the world empire.
[1:33:31.720 --> 1:33:34.200]  Here they are admitting the motive to stage 9-11.
[1:33:34.200 --> 1:33:38.360]  In your face, we have all these top generals on record saying, we sure need another 9-11.
[1:33:38.360 --> 1:33:42.440]  That sure helped us and those neocons, those headlines a few years ago about we need another
[1:33:42.440 --> 1:33:43.440]  9-11 now.
[1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:46.560]  Then people ask, well, why would they stage a terror attack?
[1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:51.200]  Well, why would Hitler fire bomb his own Reichstag to declare martial law a few months
[1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:53.600]  after being elected?
[1:33:53.600 --> 1:33:59.040]  In February 27th, 1933, why would they attack their own military basic Gliwitz to blame
[1:33:59.040 --> 1:34:00.040]  on the Poles?
[1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:07.800]  It's called a frame up, folks, and if they'll hire Taliban and Al-Qaeda to attack U.S. forces
[1:34:07.800 --> 1:34:12.880]  that's on record confirmed, then they'll do anything.
[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:13.880]  So that's coming up as well.
[1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:17.720]  Also, I want to show a video and I'll break it down for the radio audience coming up later
[1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:21.640]  in the next hour.
[1:34:21.640 --> 1:34:33.880]  NASA has released satellite images and done a composite of the Arctic and Antarctic ice
[1:34:33.880 --> 1:34:40.440]  from 1979 on, from satellite, and in the summer it gets small, in the winter it gets big,
[1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:41.440]  it does this.
[1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:46.320]  It gets big, it gets small, it gets big, it gets small.
[1:34:46.320 --> 1:34:52.440]  But see Al Gore goes and shows video footage of glaciers falling in the Arctic or Antarctic
[1:34:52.440 --> 1:34:54.160]  and says, look, it's melting.
[1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:55.160]  They're icebergs.
[1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:57.920]  Yes, there were icebergs a million years ago, too.
[1:34:57.920 --> 1:34:59.800]  There were icebergs that hit the Titanic.
[1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:01.960]  It wasn't global warming.
[1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:03.400]  They break off every year.
[1:35:03.400 --> 1:35:08.600]  See, it rains on the land and builds up, then that has pressure on it.
[1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:15.300]  The glaciers slide out as it warms each year in the spring and summer and then that breaks
[1:35:15.300 --> 1:35:18.240]  off into the ocean.
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:21.360]  And then Al Gore says, look, the polar bear is drowning.
[1:35:21.360 --> 1:35:23.240]  He's out on an iceberg.
[1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:25.240]  He broke away and he's going to die.
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:29.880]  No, they swim out to those and hunt seals.
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:36.440]  And they've had to admit now that polar bears are the best land animal swimmer.
[1:35:36.440 --> 1:35:38.520]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:40.480]  They're counting on you to be stupid.
[1:35:40.480 --> 1:35:42.080]  They treat you like you're very dumb.
[1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:44.200]  You're not stupid.
[1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:48.440]  You don't have to get pimp-gamed here and scammed anymore.
[1:35:48.440 --> 1:35:51.600]  You can stop being a fool.
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:57.320]  But they teach the children in school polar bears are dying and grounding and they cry.
[1:35:57.320 --> 1:35:58.320]  It's all over TV.
[1:35:58.320 --> 1:36:00.920]  Every time I watch a nature show, I seem to see about the polar bears grounding.
[1:36:00.920 --> 1:36:05.200]  Folks, the polar bear numbers have gone from 30 something thousand to 44,000 just in North
[1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:06.200]  America.
[1:36:06.200 --> 1:36:07.800]  They're all over the place.
[1:36:07.800 --> 1:36:11.600]  The archaeology shows their numbers go up when it gets warmer.
[1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:13.320]  But I'm going to cover that next hour.
[1:36:13.320 --> 1:36:14.320]  I said, I take your calls.
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:18.640]  It's just, I'm sure you ladies and gentlemen, they can swim.
[1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:23.840]  I'll assure you icebergs are normal.
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:26.360]  Know that's hard to believe.
[1:36:26.360 --> 1:36:28.680]  I'm surprised they're saying seals are drowning too.
[1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:32.000]  I mean, seals swim, dolphins swim.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.280]  I know that's hard to believe right now.
[1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:38.920]  All right, let's go ahead here, a little bit of satire, folks, but the public, I mean,
[1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:39.920]  it's not satire.
[1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:41.840]  The public believes they can't swim.
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:43.440]  Tell us in Detroit, you're on the air.
[1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:44.440]  Thanks for holding.
[1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:45.940]  Hi, Alex.
[1:36:45.940 --> 1:36:48.840]  I had a question or a couple of questions.
[1:36:48.840 --> 1:36:53.160]  When do you think they're going to implement the full volunteer service act and how can
[1:36:53.160 --> 1:36:56.800]  we resist for our children?
[1:36:56.800 --> 1:37:02.440]  Well, they passed the give act, but took out the provisions where it said absolute mandatory
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:07.680]  service when you get out of high school for a year in a new paramilitary force as the
[1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:12.080]  body chief of staff on record says it will be in uniform, but it still says they're set
[1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:16.600]  up the board to prepare compulsory service and they've got a bunch of other bills.
[1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:20.080]  I was looking at this just Monday for a film I'm making.
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:24.520]  I saw six different new bills or was it, it was, you know, a six because I got a folder
[1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:29.760]  out there with them that, that, that say compulsory service, just like they have the hate crimes
[1:37:29.760 --> 1:37:35.120]  act and the cyber bullying act with the exact same language about if something hurts someone's
[1:37:35.120 --> 1:37:37.800]  feelings, the feds come arrest you.
[1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:40.480]  In fact, I'll read that since I mentioned it in a moment.
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:42.480]  And so it's going on now.
[1:37:42.480 --> 1:37:44.640]  They have city year.
[1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:48.160]  They have year up.
[1:37:48.160 --> 1:37:54.520]  They have the kids at public schools everywhere, must go work before and after school and during
[1:37:54.520 --> 1:37:55.520]  school.
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:37:57.240]  They don't get taught reading, writing or arithmetic.
[1:37:57.240 --> 1:38:02.240]  They go and they plant gardens as service for the school to sell the food as if the schools
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:03.980]  don't have enough money.
[1:38:03.980 --> 1:38:07.880]  Just like China where they got to work in the fireworks factories or in the textiles.
[1:38:07.880 --> 1:38:11.280]  They're now introducing service means you're a slave to them.
[1:38:11.280 --> 1:38:14.400]  Not you go down and help people at the soup kitchen.
[1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:17.760]  So that's going on.
[1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:20.080]  And so it's happening.
[1:38:20.080 --> 1:38:24.080]  The hate crime wasn't that initially started by the militant homosexuals.
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:25.080]  Yes.
[1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:26.080]  Silence.
[1:38:26.080 --> 1:38:27.080]  People.
[1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:28.080]  Yes.
[1:38:28.080 --> 1:38:32.760]  They see the way this is always phrased, whether you're for that or not, it's best to approach
[1:38:32.760 --> 1:38:38.240]  the debate from it's always about, oh, we need freedom to do what we want.
[1:38:38.240 --> 1:38:42.600]  Well, people then, if you disagree with them, you know, even on popular speech, it's people's
[1:38:42.600 --> 1:38:45.960]  right to, you know, say if you do that, you're going to hell.
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:49.280]  But no, they, they, they're trying to pass laws and they've actually arrested a lot of
[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:50.280]  pastors.
[1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:54.240]  It's better than news and Philadelphia and other places at public parades.
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:57.720]  They're not allowed to have a sign saying what you're doing is bad and they're arrested
[1:38:57.720 --> 1:39:01.560]  and charged with hate speech and in some cases go to prison now.
[1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:05.480]  And so, uh, yes, let me, and I appreciate your call.
[1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:10.280]  Let me just read from the hate crime bill introduced by representative Linda Sanchez
[1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:13.400]  that has passed the house and has set to pass the Senate.
[1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:16.400]  See everything they've tried for years is now passing.
[1:39:16.400 --> 1:39:19.800]  And I had read an earlier version that didn't have this language.
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:26.240]  It was just, we're going to say certain groups are more protected than others.
[1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:30.360]  So if a white guy kills a white guy, you're not going to get that much prison time.
[1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:33.320]  But if a white guy kills a black guy, you're going to get a lot more prison time.
[1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:36.600]  Or if a black guy kills a white guy, you're going to get more prison time if it's racially
[1:39:36.600 --> 1:39:42.560]  motivated or if a black guy kills a black guy, it's not as bad as a white guy killing
[1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:47.160]  a black guy, which, you know, and they always use the Texas case of them dragging the black
[1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:48.160]  guy to death.
[1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:49.160]  They all got death penalty.
[1:39:49.160 --> 1:39:54.280]  I mean, what else are they supposed to get, you know, well, the hate crime on top of it.
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:55.280]  I mean, it's pointless.
[1:39:55.280 --> 1:40:02.360]  They all got the death penalty, what else are you supposed to do?
[1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:05.240]  But you notice it was in the Associated Press, but nowhere else.
[1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:09.560]  Then some black guys grabbed a drunk homeless white guy and drug him to death.
[1:40:09.560 --> 1:40:13.160]  And it didn't even hardly make the news because, and then they didn't get charged with hate
[1:40:13.160 --> 1:40:15.120]  crimes.
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:16.760]  And I think they got the death penalty too.
[1:40:16.760 --> 1:40:22.960]  So the issue here, you can pull that effect, pull up Jasper, Texas, blacks, pull, it'll
[1:40:22.960 --> 1:40:26.640]  only be on the Nazi websites, but then they'll have links to the AP.
[1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:28.000]  You can see that people don't see.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:32.040]  Why do you know about the black guy getting drugged to death, but not the old drunk white
[1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:33.040]  guy?
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:39.240]  Both of them old winos, old black drunk guy, old white drunk guy, well, I mean, they're
[1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:40.240]  both human beings.
[1:40:40.240 --> 1:40:46.080]  They're all, they're both old drunk guys, old ex, you know, ex cons or whatever.
[1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:51.300]  You know, that's the point here is that I thought it was bad enough, but I was focusing
[1:40:51.300 --> 1:40:56.120]  just on the cyber bullying because I never seen language that said, you have no more
[1:40:56.120 --> 1:40:57.320]  free speech.
[1:40:57.320 --> 1:41:04.200]  But what is in the hate crimes bill that's passed the house is the exact same wording
[1:41:04.200 --> 1:41:07.320]  in the cyber bullying.
[1:41:07.320 --> 1:41:13.200]  And it says, whoever transmits an interstate or foreign commerce, any communication internet
[1:41:13.200 --> 1:41:17.240]  with the intent to coerce, intimidate, harass or cause substantial emotional distress to
[1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:23.440]  a person using electronic means, so emotional distress to support severe repeated, these
[1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:29.640]  are commas or hostile behavior shall be fined under this title or in prison, not more than
[1:41:29.640 --> 1:41:30.640]  two years or both.
[1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:36.200]  There's just a bigger penalty in the cyber bullying than in this communication means
[1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:40.840]  electronic transmission between or among points specific by the user information of
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:41.840]  the user.
[1:41:41.840 --> 1:41:46.760]  So it's got a cyber bullying section in it to try to coerce a politician devoting a particular
[1:41:46.760 --> 1:41:51.280]  way or repeatedly blogging using a hostile tone.
[1:41:51.280 --> 1:41:56.600]  I mean, folks, this, this, this, this, this is Soviet Union end of First Amendment.
[1:41:56.600 --> 1:41:59.000]  And I had my cyber bullying here.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  Where is that?
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:05.040]  Now, now, in case you don't believe me, it's not just Alex Jones saying this.
[1:42:05.040 --> 1:42:11.160]  Here is ABC News seven anti cyber bullying legislation threat to free speech.
[1:42:11.160 --> 1:42:14.720]  I mean, it period says no more free speech.
[1:42:14.720 --> 1:42:18.880]  And the feds say we don't even need somebody to file a complaint saying you're blogging
[1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:24.040]  or your email or your phone call Hector feelings.
[1:42:24.040 --> 1:42:25.440]  We're going to decide.
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:30.520]  Yeah, here's the cyber bullying act.
[1:42:30.520 --> 1:42:34.000]  Corporate media exploits teen idle to push cyber bullying.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  Where's the subsection?
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.520]  Oh, that's not the article with the subsection.
[1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:40.000]  Oh, that doesn't matter.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:41.480]  I've read it on air over and over again.
[1:42:41.480 --> 1:42:43.600]  It's got the exact same words.
[1:42:43.600 --> 1:42:49.280]  Okay, uh, let's go ahead and talk to Steven in Florida, Steven.
[1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:50.280]  You're on the air.
[1:42:50.280 --> 1:42:51.280]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[1:42:51.280 --> 1:42:54.280]  How are you?
[1:42:54.280 --> 1:42:55.280]  Good.
[1:42:55.280 --> 1:42:56.280]  Okay.
[1:42:56.280 --> 1:42:57.280]  Off speaker phone.
[1:42:57.280 --> 1:42:58.280]  Uh, I read it.
[1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:03.280]  I wrote a dissertation with regards to what the fourth of July means to me.
[1:43:03.280 --> 1:43:08.720]  But listening to everyone and listening to you, what you have presented, it shows that
[1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:17.680]  this is what we stand for the anti establishment of these goons telling us what to do, removing
[1:43:17.680 --> 1:43:23.840]  our liberties, removing, oh, we're, we're all men are created equal.
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:28.960]  We have, we have the robber crime class who's stolen everything and now they're putting
[1:43:28.960 --> 1:43:33.760]  a police state in to protect themselves and they use terrorist to menace us.
[1:43:33.760 --> 1:43:37.920]  Oh, we're taking your rights because Al Qaeda and you're like, wait, your hands in the sock
[1:43:37.920 --> 1:43:38.920]  puppet.
[1:43:38.920 --> 1:43:39.920]  You're Al Qaeda.
[1:43:39.920 --> 1:43:40.920]  Shut up.
[1:43:40.920 --> 1:43:45.840]  You know, it's just incredible how I grew up in a family that was a Holocaust survivors
[1:43:45.840 --> 1:43:52.000]  and what I've heard stories growing up and the way that they have described the programs
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:58.320]  and the way that the Nazis have infiltrated communities, loving caring communities and
[1:43:58.320 --> 1:44:05.600]  actually torn them apart piece by piece by piece to where there was nothing.
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:09.240]  These people had nothing to substantiate in existence.
[1:44:09.240 --> 1:44:10.240]  And here we are today.
[1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:11.240]  That's right.
[1:44:11.240 --> 1:44:16.520]  First they break down your society, bankrupt the economy, then you have to go to the government
[1:44:16.520 --> 1:44:21.440]  ghettos or the FEMA center because you're so broke, then they start coming in and arresting
[1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:24.800]  people selectively, then they just ship everybody off.
[1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:25.800]  That is all right.
[1:44:25.800 --> 1:44:31.040]  We're already the most imprisoned society in world history here in the U.S.
[1:44:31.040 --> 1:44:36.560]  In my fourth of July, I'm going to be sharing it with my friends that are citizens and sovereign
[1:44:36.560 --> 1:44:43.200]  citizens of this great nation and we will celebrate what we have thrived to provide
[1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:44.920]  for our children.
[1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:51.160]  And it's regardless of color, creed, skin color, it doesn't matter.
[1:44:51.160 --> 1:44:56.000]  Here in Islam and a Jew can get together and they can have a barbecue and they have nothing
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.840]  to discuss except maybe the baseball game.
[1:44:58.840 --> 1:45:03.440]  Exactly, the elite, exactly, and God bless you, sir.
[1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:07.880]  And what the elite want to do is they want to fund different bad groups in every religious
[1:45:07.880 --> 1:45:11.600]  or racial or national group to play us off against each other.
[1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:16.760]  This is a system of divide and conquer called the great game, and that's why we can't let
[1:45:16.760 --> 1:45:21.520]  them get us fighting with each other at each other's throats over all these issues.
[1:45:21.520 --> 1:45:26.280]  We need to stand up and say a Liberty culture, a bill of rights, a Constitution, we're all
[1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:30.960]  for it, and everybody has these basic rights because they always have an excuse, oh, we're
[1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:33.960]  only taking this group's rights, we're only taking that group's rights.
[1:45:33.960 --> 1:45:34.960]  It's very, very dangerous.
[1:45:34.960 --> 1:45:37.280]  Thanks for telling us what this fourth of July means to you.
[1:45:37.280 --> 1:45:38.280]  I agree with you.
[1:45:38.280 --> 1:45:42.080]  Okay, quickly, Alex in North Carolina, go ahead, Alex.
[1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:43.080]  Hello.
[1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:45.080]  Hey, go ahead.
[1:45:45.080 --> 1:45:50.000]  Hello, I'm Alex, a longtime listener, first-time caller.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:53.120]  Good to have you on board.
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:56.760]  Have you heard about the legal action taken against?
[1:45:56.760 --> 1:45:59.320]  I appreciate your call, sir, I really do.
[1:45:59.320 --> 1:46:06.400]  We can't allow people to have websites that have my picture and basically like it's me
[1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:10.240]  and it's my site, and then it has links to other things that aren't us.
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:15.800]  And so we've got to launch a whole program of dozens and dozens of sites that hold out
[1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:19.560]  that they are us and are not.
[1:46:19.560 --> 1:46:20.560]  It's just that simple.
[1:46:20.560 --> 1:46:25.680]  I can't separately let people come on my site on the message board and advertise selling
[1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:30.760]  my films for $1 on my own site, kind of turned a blind eye to people doing that.
[1:46:30.760 --> 1:46:33.280]  When they do it on my own site, then I ban it, they get mad.
[1:46:33.280 --> 1:46:36.560]  That's a separate group in people.
[1:46:36.560 --> 1:46:41.640]  You can't have advertising rates in my face and say advertise on my site, as if it's
[1:46:41.640 --> 1:46:44.800]  my site when it's not my site, okay?
[1:46:44.800 --> 1:46:47.160]  Or then we're not even going to be able to have our sites.
[1:46:47.160 --> 1:46:48.800]  I don't know how to explain that to people.
[1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:50.920]  So I really appreciate your call.
[1:46:50.920 --> 1:46:55.960]  And we've been way too lenient with people until folks then start believing that we're
[1:46:55.960 --> 1:46:58.360]  here like a doormat to be walked on.
[1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:00.520]  I'm not an enemy of anybody out there.
[1:47:00.520 --> 1:47:02.160]  I'm not, you know, any of this.
[1:47:02.160 --> 1:47:04.720]  It's just that it's all going to stop.
[1:47:04.720 --> 1:47:09.080]  And a lot of people are going to have me, you know, stand up for my name and my voice
[1:47:09.080 --> 1:47:13.360]  and who I am because it's not that all these groups are bad, but it's that if I let everybody
[1:47:13.360 --> 1:47:21.160]  do this, there are a lot of sites, not the one you mentioned, that put my stuff up there
[1:47:21.160 --> 1:47:26.800]  and then link to white supremacist stuff or link to weird occult stuff or link to, and
[1:47:26.800 --> 1:47:29.480]  then they hold out as if they're me.
[1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:33.800]  And then there's a person who used to work in this office who we've now gone to several
[1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:38.600]  events and watched them go around saying he still works with us and that, and that he's
[1:47:38.600 --> 1:47:40.640]  holding out that he represents us.
[1:47:40.640 --> 1:47:42.600]  I've got to do something about that.
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:47.200]  I mean, it's a whole issue because it's a way of the establishment can come after me.
[1:47:47.200 --> 1:47:48.200]  Okay.
[1:47:48.200 --> 1:47:51.480]  With the Poplowski thing and all of this, I got to be careful folks.
[1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:54.040]  And so people could take that person all day they want.
[1:47:54.040 --> 1:47:57.720]  Somebody puts a side up where it looks like me acts like me says, advertising the Alex
[1:47:57.720 --> 1:47:58.720]  Jones show.
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:47:59.720]  I'm going to stand up against it.
[1:47:59.720 --> 1:48:05.480]  I mean, look, I even turned a blind eye a few years ago to people started radio networks.
[1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:09.080]  Ted Anderson was so nice that he said, yeah, you can carry our internet stream.
[1:48:09.080 --> 1:48:14.520]  Then we have sponsors calling going, Hey, I'm already sponsoring your show.
[1:48:14.520 --> 1:48:16.040]  You know, we're not going to sponsor you anymore.
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:19.080]  We'd go, what do you mean we're already sponsoring our show?
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:22.000]  Well, we're on this network that, you know, that's you, right?
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:25.960]  We'll know that's a little internet thing, but you're fine to sponsor there if you'd
[1:48:25.960 --> 1:48:28.520]  like, but we're, we're the big show.
[1:48:28.520 --> 1:48:29.920]  And then the little guys would get mad.
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:34.360]  It's like, you gave us your show and let us make money on your back and that's not enough.
[1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:35.960]  Give us everything.
[1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:39.920]  So no, we're going to protect our name and who we are and what we're doing and people
[1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:40.920]  won't take it personal.
[1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:44.560]  We try to ask people nicely and if they don't stop, we go after them.
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:47.080]  And I've asked Ted to go after people for this.
[1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:53.480]  Ted is just such a nice guy, but we can't let people represent themselves as us period.
[1:48:53.480 --> 1:48:55.920]  So no, no, no hurt feelings to anybody.
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:48:57.320]  That's just the way it works.
[1:48:57.320 --> 1:48:59.760]  This is a syndicated radio transmission.
[1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:03.880]  Hey, I don't go around pretending I'm other people.
[1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:06.080]  I don't go in the air and pretend I'm Rush Limbaugh.
[1:49:06.080 --> 1:49:07.080]  What would you do?
[1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:09.660]  What happened if I set up a Rush Limbaugh site and acted like it was an official Rush
[1:49:09.660 --> 1:49:11.040]  Limbaugh site?
[1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:12.040]  It's over.
[1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:13.040]  It stops.
[1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:19.360]  Let's go ahead and, uh, I mean, hell, I've had all these literal hordes of carpet baggers
[1:49:19.360 --> 1:49:20.600]  moved down here to Austin.
[1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:21.600]  Some of them aren't that bad.
[1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:22.600]  Some of them are.
[1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:25.240]  And I let them into my life and then it's like, Alex, you need to just go jump off a
[1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:26.240]  cliff.
[1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:27.240]  We're going to become you now.
[1:49:27.240 --> 1:49:28.560]  And I'm like, well, no, I'm going to keep who I am.
[1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:29.960]  No, no, you're a murderer.
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:30.960]  You're a drug dealer.
[1:49:30.960 --> 1:49:31.960]  You're a criminal.
[1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:32.960]  You're this and that.
[1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:33.960]  You know what?
[1:49:33.960 --> 1:49:34.960]  Bam.
[1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:35.960]  I smash you.
[1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:36.960]  And then he's bad.
[1:49:36.960 --> 1:49:38.440]  He did something to us.
[1:49:38.440 --> 1:49:40.320]  No, you're not here to take me over.
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:41.320]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:49:41.320 --> 1:49:42.320]  I'm me.
[1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:43.320]  You're not me.
[1:49:43.320 --> 1:49:44.320]  You understand that?
[1:49:44.320 --> 1:49:45.800]  I'm risking my life for this.
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:46.800]  I'm real.
[1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:49.520]  That's why I'm successful.
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:50.520]  You're not me.
[1:49:50.520 --> 1:49:51.520]  Go do yourself.
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:54.120]  Go do your own thing.
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:58.160]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[1:49:58.160 --> 1:50:01.240]  Who's up next here?
[1:50:01.240 --> 1:50:02.480]  Franklin in New Mexico.
[1:50:02.480 --> 1:50:03.480]  Go ahead.
[1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:04.480]  Franklin.
[1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:05.480]  You're on the air.
[1:50:05.480 --> 1:50:06.480]  How are you doing, sir?
[1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:07.480]  Good.
[1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:09.240]  I found something on the Internet.
[1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:13.000]  I think you might be interested in.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:21.600]  It's a national exercise that I guess the latest version started on June 17.
[1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:22.600]  Yeah.
[1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:27.760]  No, it's a foreign troop exercise official FEMA with foreign troops from the United
[1:50:27.760 --> 1:50:31.640]  Kingdom, Mexico, Canada, Germany, Israel right here.
[1:50:31.640 --> 1:50:32.640]  Stay there.
[1:50:32.640 --> 1:50:33.640]  I'll come back to you on the other side.
[1:50:33.640 --> 1:50:35.720]  There it is.
[1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:39.000]  FEMA National Level Exercise 2009.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:40.920]  A lot more coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:50:40.920 --> 1:50:42.840]  I am Alex Jones.
[1:50:42.840 --> 1:50:51.040]  This is my radio show right here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:50:51.040 --> 1:50:52.040]  I am Alex Jones.
[1:50:52.040 --> 1:50:53.040]  Not always other people.
[1:50:53.040 --> 1:50:59.120]  We'll be right back.
[1:50:59.120 --> 1:51:03.040]  On German schedules, overdoses, diseases, health Hope disease is on the rise.
[1:51:03.040 --> 1:51:07.640]  Clawed arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[1:51:07.640 --> 1:51:08.640]  by you.
[1:51:08.640 --> 1:51:09.840]  But the symptoms are there.
[1:51:09.840 --> 1:51:13.080]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops.
[1:51:13.080 --> 1:51:16.940]  Poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you
[1:51:16.940 --> 1:51:18.000]  that something is wrong.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:22.940]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[1:51:22.940 --> 1:51:23.980]  across America.

[1:51:59.080 --> 1:52:05.160]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:52:05.160 --> 1:52:09.680]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[1:52:09.680 --> 1:52:11.000]  us would like to see.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:16.160]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:52:16.160 --> 1:52:17.160]  of the American people.
[1:52:17.160 --> 1:52:21.880]  While Obama's already fudging, it's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:52:21.880 --> 1:52:27.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:35.120]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:52:35.120 --> 1:52:38.680]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[1:52:38.680 --> 1:52:45.600]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:52:45.600 --> 1:52:53.800]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[1:52:53.800 --> 1:52:58.360]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:52:58.360 --> 1:53:01.640]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[1:53:01.640 --> 1:53:05.560]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[1:53:05.560 --> 1:53:09.280]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[1:53:14.040 --> 1:53:18.360]  water, remove dangerous chlorine fluoride and contaminants from municipal water.
[1:53:18.360 --> 1:53:22.680]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for
[1:53:22.680 --> 1:53:24.440]  rainwater collection systems.

[1:54:08.600 --> 1:54:12.320]  Okay, that last caller didn't hold over, I want him to be able to finish his point.
[1:54:12.320 --> 1:54:17.240]  Let me tell you about a few of the sponsors we've got, and we've got a guest coming up
[1:54:17.240 --> 1:54:21.400]  about 15-20 minutes with Texas Independence, find out what that's all about.
[1:54:21.400 --> 1:54:24.720]  I'm for Texas Sovereignty under Ninth and Tenth Amendment.
[1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:25.960]  I don't know about secession.
[1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:30.720]  You know, it's fun to say that, but there's actually a few wrinkles to that.
[1:54:30.720 --> 1:54:33.520]  So we'll debate it, we'll discuss it coming up.
[1:54:33.520 --> 1:54:41.640]  I'm going to have Heidi Montog and Spencer Pratt back on because it made it in, I don't
[1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:45.760]  know, seven or eight big tabloids in the cover of Us Magazine and a bunch of other places
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:49.840]  that they were on the show and said 9-11 was an inside job a few days ago.
[1:54:49.840 --> 1:54:51.240]  So I thought we'd have them on.
[1:54:51.240 --> 1:54:52.240]  Why?
[1:54:52.240 --> 1:54:57.760]  Because they're waking up and they're big pop stars out there and we've got all these
[1:54:57.760 --> 1:55:05.120]  young people and tweenies and teenagers and all the glamour folks tuning in and we love
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:06.120]  the new listeners.
[1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:13.320]  We'll go anywhere, like Russian TV, Chinese TV, Japanese television, Mexican television.
[1:55:13.320 --> 1:55:19.080]  And I'm there folks, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, Jonesreport.com.
[1:55:19.080 --> 1:55:22.840]  We should create a list of our official sites and frequently ask questions.
[1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:26.120]  We need to do that because we're really becoming a global phenomenon and we've got a lot of
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:28.200]  stuff to deal with.
[1:55:28.200 --> 1:55:29.200]  Okay.
[1:55:29.200 --> 1:55:33.880]  I want to tell you about, I just got a hit there.
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:35.400]  We still connected to the network?
[1:55:35.400 --> 1:55:36.400]  Okay.
[1:55:36.400 --> 1:55:38.080]  A lot of stuff going on today.
[1:55:38.080 --> 1:55:43.080]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's show possible.
[1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:50.760]  One of them is Home Gain and you can go to infowars.com and click on max the little orange
[1:55:50.760 --> 1:55:57.800]  gorilla to find out more about Home Gain.
[1:55:57.800 --> 1:55:59.680]  And they got a lot of different free functions.
[1:55:59.680 --> 1:56:02.920]  Everything's free on the site, H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[1:56:02.920 --> 1:56:05.840]  They got street view where you can look at your house at street level and take a virtual
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:08.000]  walk to the neighborhood you're interested in.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:12.440]  My favorite is the home sale maximizer to help you determine which home improvements
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:21.760]  can most increase your home's value and I'll keep this world from dragging me down.
[1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:23.480]  They're having some fun today, folks.
[1:56:23.480 --> 1:56:42.960]  Let me tell you.
[1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:59.960]  Well, I want to make you everybody aware who I am.
[1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:17.960]  Well, I'll put the wall back down No, I won't back down
[1:57:17.960 --> 1:57:25.960]  You could stand me up at the gates of hell But I won't back down
[1:57:25.960 --> 1:57:33.960]  No, I'll stand my ground Wall be turned around
[1:57:33.960 --> 1:57:42.960]  And I'll keep this world from dragging me down Gonna stand my ground
[1:57:42.960 --> 1:57:46.960]  And I won't back down
[1:57:46.960 --> 1:57:58.960]  Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out Hey, yeah
[1:57:58.960 --> 1:58:02.960]  You know, it is a miracle, and I'll see you with problems we have
[1:58:02.960 --> 1:58:07.960]  Because I'm down here in Austin, Texas, the main network of the satellite uplinks are in Minnesota
[1:58:07.960 --> 1:58:12.960]  And I'm simulcasting live TV here as well
[1:58:12.960 --> 1:58:17.960]  And we're number one on the Internet with audio streams and getting close to being number one on podcasting
[1:58:17.960 --> 1:58:20.960]  So I want to thank the great crews on both ends
[1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:26.960]  I was just getting a lot of feedback and chatter in my ear, so I ducked out for a minute or two while we figured that out
[1:58:26.960 --> 1:58:29.960]  Okay, we're going to start the next hour, we'll get our guests on at 8 after
[1:58:29.960 --> 1:58:34.960]  I'm going to come back, get some of the news that's coming up, though, in this next little segment
[1:58:34.960 --> 1:58:36.960]  Then we'll get our guests on in your calls
[1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:41.960]  Thank you for listening to GCN
[1:58:41.960 --> 1:59:08.960]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today
[1:59:08.960 --> 1:59:14.960]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high-demand summer months ahead
[1:59:14.960 --> 1:59:17.960]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[1:59:17.960 --> 1:59:21.960]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages
[1:59:21.960 --> 1:59:26.960]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:59:26.960 --> 1:59:32.960]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours
[1:59:32.960 --> 1:59:38.960]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com

[2:00:04.960 --> 2:00:09.960]  You want answers? Well, so does he

[2:00:13.960 --> 2:00:20.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[2:00:20.960 --> 2:00:24.960]  We got a guest popping in in the next segment and talking about Texas independence
[2:00:24.960 --> 2:00:26.960]  What does this group stand for?
[2:00:26.960 --> 2:00:30.960]  You'll be learning just as I am coming up in the next segment
[2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:36.960]  Then, Murdoch CEO, labels bloggers political extremists, says we should go to jail
[2:00:36.960 --> 2:00:41.960]  Just like we do, I guess, in China or in other countries, so very sickening
[2:00:41.960 --> 2:00:45.960]  And speaking of that, Gates approves creation of New Cyber Command
[2:00:45.960 --> 2:00:49.960]  They always announce it after it's built, built down in San Antonio to snoop your email
[2:00:49.960 --> 2:00:52.960]  Openly to attack websites and blogs
[2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:57.960]  And some military commanders on the news have said to kill U.S. journalists domestically
[2:00:57.960 --> 2:01:02.960]  They say that's the new freedom. Defense Secretary Robert Gates formally ordered the creation Tuesday
[2:01:02.960 --> 2:01:06.960]  Of a new military cyber command that will coordinate the Pentagon's efforts to defend its networks
[2:01:06.960 --> 2:01:09.960]  And conduct cyber warfare themselves
[2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:13.960]  They will conduct cyber warfare against us
[2:01:13.960 --> 2:01:16.960]  They say their target is anti-New World Order people
[2:01:16.960 --> 2:01:19.960]  That report how the Pentagon hires al-Qaeda to kill our own troops
[2:01:19.960 --> 2:01:21.960]  I'm sorry we're just murdering the troops
[2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:25.960]  Oh, but you're such a good American, American flag
[2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:30.960]  Sent care packages of the troops along with the Taliban IED
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:35.960]  And the mainstream newspapers in San Antonio
[2:01:35.960 --> 2:01:39.960]  Try to go film the giant cyber command base from just city streets
[2:01:39.960 --> 2:01:41.960]  And goons illegally run out and arrest them
[2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:44.960]  I mean, that's America. You have a right to have goons arrest you
[2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:47.960]  Feds may grab California parks
[2:01:47.960 --> 2:01:51.960]  Grants land at risk, California parks close
[2:01:51.960 --> 2:01:55.960]  Dow slides almost 200 plus points
[2:01:55.960 --> 2:01:56.960]  Give me the latest numbers on that
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:01:57.960]  I don't want to get to that later
[2:01:57.960 --> 2:01:58.960]  Dow plunging
[2:01:58.960 --> 2:02:02.960]  Senate may pass U.S. climate bill but reject the U.N. treaty to it
[2:02:02.960 --> 2:02:04.960]  Yeah, so it can all be selectively enforced
[2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:06.960]  Kerry says Bloomberg
[2:02:06.960 --> 2:02:10.960]  Bureau of Cratch will carry out mandatory home inspections under climate bill
[2:02:10.960 --> 2:02:12.960]  That is coming up
[2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:16.960]  Farmers to rally in Fresno over water as they turn their water off
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:19.960]  Saying it's for endangered fish all about driving you off the property
[2:02:19.960 --> 2:02:21.960]  After the bankers get it, they'll turn the water back on
[2:02:21.960 --> 2:02:24.960]  A motion but few details in Obama's health care pitch
[2:02:24.960 --> 2:02:26.960]  That is coming up
[2:02:26.960 --> 2:02:28.960]  Let me try to tell you about that sponsor
[2:02:28.960 --> 2:02:31.960]  I was unable to tell you about because the
[2:02:31.960 --> 2:02:33.960]  Some of the network feeds cut out
[2:02:33.960 --> 2:02:35.960]  We were still on air on some, but I just
[2:02:35.960 --> 2:02:37.960]  Didn't want to just talk to part of the people
[2:02:37.960 --> 2:02:39.960]  So we went to rebroadcast for about a minute
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:42.960]  Homegain, I want to tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors

[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:33.960]  Survivalseedbank.com
[2:03:33.960 --> 2:03:34.960]  Fabulous, folks
[2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:37.960]  Everybody should have seeds, water, firearms, food
[2:03:37.960 --> 2:03:39.960]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds
[2:03:39.960 --> 2:03:43.960]  Means having the ability to grow a little supply of nutrient-dense food
[2:03:43.960 --> 2:03:44.960]  To feed your loved ones
[2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:46.960]  There have been times in American history, pilgrims, for example
[2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:49.960]  When seeds had the highest value of any bartered item
[2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:51.960]  Even silver or gold
[2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:53.960]  There's a war on against hybrid seeds
[2:03:53.960 --> 2:03:57.960]  Waged by the global elite who want to control us by controlling the food supply
[2:03:57.960 --> 2:04:00.960]  Governments are storing seeds, the UN is storing seeds
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:03.960]  Globals have every stripe are storing seeds, they're the Arctic Circle
[2:04:03.960 --> 2:04:05.960]  Why do you think this is? You know why
[2:04:05.960 --> 2:04:07.960]  Control and power
[2:04:07.960 --> 2:04:10.960]  Solutions from science is trying to get seeds out of the globalist hands
[2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:12.960]  And into the hands of the people
[2:04:12.960 --> 2:04:15.960]  One seed bank at a time, one family at a time
[2:04:15.960 --> 2:04:17.960]  A survival seed bank from Solutions from Science
[2:04:17.960 --> 2:04:21.960]  Contains enough open-bollinated seeds to plant a full-acre crisis garden
[2:04:21.960 --> 2:04:24.960]  The globalist, ladies and gentlemen, don't own all the seeds yet
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:27.960]  But they're trying to get your Survivalseedbank today

[2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:42.960]  And go to our next guest
[2:04:42.960 --> 2:04:44.960]  For about a segment or two
[2:04:44.960 --> 2:04:47.960]  Then, huge news blitz and more of your phone calls
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:50.960]  And we have Spencer Pratt and Heidi
[2:04:50.960 --> 2:04:52.960]  Pratt popping back in
[2:04:52.960 --> 2:04:55.960]  With all the big headlines our interview made here two days ago
[2:04:55.960 --> 2:04:57.960]  Stay with us
[2:04:57.960 --> 2:04:58.960]  This is Alex Jones
[2:04:58.960 --> 2:05:00.960]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[2:05:00.960 --> 2:05:01.960]  Well, you should

[2:05:10.960 --> 2:05:12.960]  At Front Sight Firearms Training Institute
[2:05:12.960 --> 2:05:15.960]  And secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit
[2:05:15.960 --> 2:05:17.960]  All for pennies on the dollar

[2:05:24.960 --> 2:05:27.960]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained
[2:05:27.960 --> 2:05:30.960]  To levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards
[2:05:30.960 --> 2:05:34.960]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality
[2:05:34.960 --> 2:05:36.960]  Or drill instructor attitudes

[2:08:23.960 --> 2:08:26.960]  We really need to be hit by Al Qaeda
[2:08:26.960 --> 2:08:29.960]  To get the American people to go along with this New World Order
[2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:32.960]  In fact, let's pull up some of those old articles
[2:08:32.960 --> 2:08:35.960]  Headline columnist says we need another 9-11
[2:08:35.960 --> 2:08:37.960]  Our 9-11 was good for America
[2:08:37.960 --> 2:08:39.960]  I want to have some of the background stuff
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:40.960]  This is a theme
[2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:44.960]  You can also Google Pentagon Generals
[2:08:44.960 --> 2:08:46.960]  Pentagon PR Generals
[2:08:46.960 --> 2:08:47.960]  The retired generals
[2:08:47.960 --> 2:08:49.960]  Who turned out were secretly on payroll
[2:08:49.960 --> 2:08:51.960]  In an audio tape with Rumsfeld saying
[2:08:51.960 --> 2:08:54.960]  9-11 sure helped us, we sure need another attack
[2:08:54.960 --> 2:08:57.960]  Without that we can't have our New World Order
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:00.960]  So that is coming up with a lot of other news as well
[2:09:00.960 --> 2:09:04.960]  Daniel Miller has gotten some national news coverage
[2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:07.960]  The president of the Texas Nationalist Movement
[2:09:07.960 --> 2:09:09.960]  Now I want to be clear
[2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:12.960]  The national media has said that when I call for states' rights
[2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:13.960]  Nineteenth Amendment
[2:09:13.960 --> 2:09:15.960]  Who constituted the federal government
[2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:16.960]  It's out of control
[2:09:16.960 --> 2:09:19.960]  Now dominated by foreign office corporations
[2:09:19.960 --> 2:09:21.960]  So we have to get control of the feds
[2:09:21.960 --> 2:09:23.960]  But I also see the globalists
[2:09:23.960 --> 2:09:25.960]  They create global regions
[2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:27.960]  And then balkanize within the regions
[2:09:27.960 --> 2:09:30.960]  The original unions to weaken the original governments
[2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:32.960]  They don't want national governments
[2:09:32.960 --> 2:09:34.960]  They don't want sovereign governments
[2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:36.960]  They want to balkanize and break those up
[2:09:36.960 --> 2:09:38.960]  Into smaller pieces in larger regions
[2:09:38.960 --> 2:09:40.960]  This is the great game, divide and conquer
[2:09:40.960 --> 2:09:42.960]  Balkanization
[2:09:42.960 --> 2:09:45.960]  So again, big global new regions
[2:09:45.960 --> 2:09:48.960]  Where big global authorities control them
[2:09:48.960 --> 2:09:49.960]  And they're broken up
[2:09:49.960 --> 2:09:51.960]  Now I'm obviously had family
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:52.960]  The Texas Revolution
[2:09:52.960 --> 2:09:53.960]  My family, the Heirs family
[2:09:53.960 --> 2:09:55.960]  Raised Colonel Travis' son
[2:09:55.960 --> 2:09:57.960]  And they were in the battle of San Jacen
[2:09:57.960 --> 2:09:58.960]  And all that stuff
[2:09:58.960 --> 2:09:59.960]  And I love Texas
[2:09:59.960 --> 2:10:01.960]  And the U.S. doesn't really exist anymore
[2:10:01.960 --> 2:10:03.960]  It is the fall of the republic
[2:10:03.960 --> 2:10:05.960]  You can really say it's pretty much gone
[2:10:05.960 --> 2:10:07.960]  They pass all these new bills
[2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:08.960]  For socialized healthcare
[2:10:08.960 --> 2:10:10.960]  And green taxes and carbon taxes
[2:10:10.960 --> 2:10:12.960]  And hate speech laws
[2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:14.960]  And federalization of all water
[2:10:14.960 --> 2:10:16.960]  Above ground and below ground
[2:10:16.960 --> 2:10:18.960]  All that's happening right now
[2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:20.960]  A total blanket amnesty
[2:10:20.960 --> 2:10:22.960]  Then you might as well have Texas break off
[2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:25.960]  But again, that'll probably be dominated by some thugs
[2:10:25.960 --> 2:10:27.960]  Whenever you start seeing Perry
[2:10:27.960 --> 2:10:29.960]  Start saying he might want secession
[2:10:29.960 --> 2:10:31.960]  And then people connected to black ops
[2:10:31.960 --> 2:10:33.960]  Saying you got to look out
[2:10:33.960 --> 2:10:35.960]  Now I'm not saying the folks pushing for it
[2:10:35.960 --> 2:10:36.960]  Aren't great people
[2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:39.960]  And I think it's their right to secede
[2:10:39.960 --> 2:10:40.960]  If Texans want to do it
[2:10:40.960 --> 2:10:42.960]  I just as a Texan have a right to say
[2:10:42.960 --> 2:10:44.960]  I want to look at this closely
[2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:46.960]  Also, we're going to have secession
[2:10:46.960 --> 2:10:48.960]  I think the Republic of Texas did it wrong
[2:10:48.960 --> 2:10:50.960]  People announcing themselves presidents
[2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:51.960]  From west Texas
[2:10:51.960 --> 2:10:53.960]  And if somebody had a bass boat
[2:10:53.960 --> 2:10:55.960]  They would call themselves admiral
[2:10:55.960 --> 2:10:56.960]  And I'm almost not joking
[2:10:56.960 --> 2:10:58.960]  People in military outfits
[2:10:58.960 --> 2:11:00.960]  And weird, you know, their attachés
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:02.960]  Running around like, you know
[2:11:02.960 --> 2:11:04.960]  There were no privates in this thing
[2:11:04.960 --> 2:11:06.960]  It was all just a military president
[2:11:06.960 --> 2:11:09.960]  And, you know, really pretty ridiculous
[2:11:09.960 --> 2:11:10.960]  In my opinion
[2:11:10.960 --> 2:11:12.960]  And then the Republic of Texas people get mad
[2:11:12.960 --> 2:11:14.960]  Because I wouldn't salute them
[2:11:14.960 --> 2:11:15.960]  I'd be in an event
[2:11:15.960 --> 2:11:17.960]  And they'd show up festooned with five stars
[2:11:17.960 --> 2:11:19.960]  And I wouldn't bow to the emperor
[2:11:19.960 --> 2:11:21.960]  And I would then be bad
[2:11:21.960 --> 2:11:27.960]  But, you know, if it was a famous Indian fighter
[2:11:27.960 --> 2:11:31.960]  Or something who'd fought with President Jackson
[2:11:31.960 --> 2:11:33.960]  Like Sam Houston
[2:11:33.960 --> 2:11:35.960]  And of course he just called himself a general at first
[2:11:35.960 --> 2:11:36.960]  And later got elected
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:38.960]  And they had an election
[2:11:38.960 --> 2:11:40.960]  So, you know, again
[2:11:40.960 --> 2:11:42.960]  Will the media make us look ridiculous
[2:11:42.960 --> 2:11:43.960]  Through all of this?
[2:11:43.960 --> 2:11:44.960]  Let's talk to Daniel Miller
[2:11:44.960 --> 2:11:46.960]  And he's the president
[2:11:46.960 --> 2:11:48.960]  Of Texas Nationalist Movement
[2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:50.960]  I'm glad he's the president of the movement
[2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:52.960]  And not announcing himself the president
[2:11:52.960 --> 2:11:54.960]  You don't have any guys in bass boats
[2:11:54.960 --> 2:11:56.960]  Do you announcing themselves as admirals?
[2:11:56.960 --> 2:11:58.960]  No, we don't have anybody
[2:11:58.960 --> 2:12:00.960]  That are announcing themselves as admirals
[2:12:00.960 --> 2:12:02.960]  But I would guess that we probably
[2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:04.960]  Have quite a few bass boats
[2:12:04.960 --> 2:12:06.960]  Amongst our membership
[2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:08.960]  Well, listen, well, listen
[2:12:08.960 --> 2:12:10.960]  TV, I think you're a great guy
[2:12:10.960 --> 2:12:12.960]  And, you know, articulate and well-spoken
[2:12:12.960 --> 2:12:14.960]  Instead of guys spitting tobacco
[2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:15.960]  Announcing that the president
[2:12:15.960 --> 2:12:17.960]  You're supposed to kneel to them
[2:12:17.960 --> 2:12:18.960]  Total insanity
[2:12:18.960 --> 2:12:19.960]  Tell us what's going on
[2:12:19.960 --> 2:12:20.960]  Tell us about your movement
[2:12:20.960 --> 2:12:22.960]  Well, Alex, you know, we are
[2:12:22.960 --> 2:12:24.960]  We are the Texas Nationalist Movement
[2:12:24.960 --> 2:12:26.960]  And we're dedicated to securing
[2:12:26.960 --> 2:12:28.960]  And preserving the cultural, political
[2:12:28.960 --> 2:12:30.960]  And economic independence of Texas
[2:12:30.960 --> 2:12:32.960]  And, you know, for anyone who's been
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:33.960]  Listening to your program
[2:12:33.960 --> 2:12:35.960]  Any length of time whatsoever
[2:12:35.960 --> 2:12:37.960]  They're going to understand exactly
[2:12:37.960 --> 2:12:39.960]  Why it is that Texas wants to stand up
[2:12:39.960 --> 2:12:40.960]  On its own
[2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:42.960]  If we're going to preserve those things
[2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:44.960]  That made the Constitution great
[2:12:44.960 --> 2:12:46.960]  That made, you know, the United States
[2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:47.960]  Of America great
[2:12:47.960 --> 2:12:49.960]  Then this is what we're going to have to do
[2:12:49.960 --> 2:12:51.960]  We're going to have to establish
[2:12:51.960 --> 2:12:53.960]  Texas as a bastion of freedom and independence
[2:12:53.960 --> 2:12:55.960]  And then work our way out from there
[2:12:57.960 --> 2:12:59.960]  Well, if secession was done
[2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:01.960]  As limited for reentry into the
[2:13:01.960 --> 2:13:03.960]  Real union when it was reestablished
[2:13:03.960 --> 2:13:05.960]  That would be better
[2:13:05.960 --> 2:13:07.960]  The White Constitution
[2:13:07.960 --> 2:13:09.960]  Arrest the governor, arrest the bankers
[2:13:09.960 --> 2:13:10.960]  You know, not let them run it
[2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:11.960]  And then we got our own oil
[2:13:11.960 --> 2:13:13.960]  We've got everything from swamps
[2:13:13.960 --> 2:13:15.960]  To pine woods, to prairie
[2:13:15.960 --> 2:13:17.960]  To farmland, to mountains
[2:13:17.960 --> 2:13:19.960]  This, this, you know, Texas is
[2:13:19.960 --> 2:13:21.960]  What is biggest France
[2:13:21.960 --> 2:13:23.960]  What, the eighth biggest economy
[2:13:23.960 --> 2:13:25.960]  In the world, California's the seventh
[2:13:25.960 --> 2:13:27.960]  And it's about to totally implode
[2:13:27.960 --> 2:13:29.960]  I agree, if we're not going to fall
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:31.960]  To the parasites like California
[2:13:31.960 --> 2:13:33.960]  If it was done right
[2:13:33.960 --> 2:13:35.960]  It would be a good thing
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:37.960]  But so, so, so tell us about your plan
[2:13:37.960 --> 2:13:39.960]  Tell us about your idea
[2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:41.960]  Tell us about your group
[2:13:41.960 --> 2:13:43.960]  Well, you know, let me, let me address
[2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:45.960]  Something that you just, that you just mentioned
[2:13:45.960 --> 2:13:47.960]  Because I think that is, you know
[2:13:47.960 --> 2:13:49.960]  For folks like us that have engaged
[2:13:49.960 --> 2:13:51.960]  In the protection of the Constitution
[2:13:51.960 --> 2:13:53.960]  For years now, you know
[2:13:53.960 --> 2:13:55.960]  That's a legitimate concern
[2:13:55.960 --> 2:13:57.960]  You know, what happens if, you know
[2:13:57.960 --> 2:13:59.960]  We get to the other side of this independence
[2:13:59.960 --> 2:14:01.960]  And we wind up with the same old
[2:14:01.960 --> 2:14:03.960]  General Sam Jr. in the driver's seat
[2:14:03.960 --> 2:14:05.960]  And that is entirely dependent
[2:14:05.960 --> 2:14:07.960]  Upon the people
[2:14:07.960 --> 2:14:09.960]  You know, Article 1, Section 2 of the
[2:14:09.960 --> 2:14:11.960]  Texas Constitution says that all political powers
[2:14:11.960 --> 2:14:13.960]  Are inherent in the people
[2:14:13.960 --> 2:14:15.960]  I mean, that's a sentiment that was echoed
[2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:17.960]  In the Declaration of Independence
[2:14:17.960 --> 2:14:19.960]  It is a foundational principle
[2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:21.960]  Both that led the 13 colonies
[2:14:21.960 --> 2:14:23.960]  To secede from Great Britain
[2:14:23.960 --> 2:14:25.960]  Led Texas to secede from Mexico
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:27.960]  And it's, you know, part of the contract
[2:14:27.960 --> 2:14:29.960]  Between Texas and the rest of the states
[2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:31.960]  Of the Union
[2:14:31.960 --> 2:14:33.960]  So this concept of all political power
[2:14:33.960 --> 2:14:35.960]  Being inherent in the people
[2:14:35.960 --> 2:14:37.960]  Is not just some kind of dusty old principle
[2:14:37.960 --> 2:14:39.960]  It really is a call to action
[2:14:39.960 --> 2:14:41.960]  For all of those people out there
[2:14:41.960 --> 2:14:43.960]  That believe in the principles
[2:14:43.960 --> 2:14:45.960]  Of freedom and rights
[2:14:45.960 --> 2:14:47.960]  To get involved
[2:14:47.960 --> 2:14:49.960]  And the only thing that is going to prevent
[2:14:49.960 --> 2:14:51.960]  This march toward globalism
[2:14:51.960 --> 2:14:53.960]  Is for people that listen to your program
[2:14:53.960 --> 2:14:55.960]  People that listen to other programs
[2:14:55.960 --> 2:14:57.960]  People that believe in these principles
[2:14:57.960 --> 2:14:59.960]  Of freedom and independence
[2:14:59.960 --> 2:15:01.960]  To stand up and take action
[2:15:01.960 --> 2:15:03.960]  Well, tell us a little bit about yourself
[2:15:03.960 --> 2:15:05.960]  In the group itself
[2:15:05.960 --> 2:15:07.960]  Sure, we are the largest
[2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:09.960]  And the oldest organization
[2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:11.960]  Dedicated to Texas independence
[2:15:11.960 --> 2:15:13.960]  And the principles of freedom
[2:15:13.960 --> 2:15:15.960]  We have been engaged in this debate
[2:15:15.960 --> 2:15:17.960]  For a very long time
[2:15:17.960 --> 2:15:19.960]  And beyond that, in the more recent examples
[2:15:19.960 --> 2:15:21.960]  We were very active
[2:15:21.960 --> 2:15:23.960]  In working on getting HCR 50 pass
[2:15:23.960 --> 2:15:25.960]  Which is the sovereignty
[2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:27.960]  With resolution here in Texas
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:29.960]  Now, I'm going to tell you right now
[2:15:29.960 --> 2:15:31.960]  That they needed a lot more teeth than it really had
[2:15:31.960 --> 2:15:33.960]  But given that we're having a smooth
[2:15:33.960 --> 2:15:35.960]  Feed a lot of these guys in the legislature
[2:15:35.960 --> 2:15:37.960]  It was definitely an accomplishment
[2:15:37.960 --> 2:15:39.960]  For those that don't know
[2:15:39.960 --> 2:15:41.960]  Texas did pass the resolution
[2:15:41.960 --> 2:15:43.960]  Saying we're not under federal control
[2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:45.960]  And the states created the feds
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:47.960]  Yeah, and it basically
[2:15:47.960 --> 2:15:49.960]  Just was a reminder
[2:15:49.960 --> 2:15:51.960]  Which I guess is the best
[2:15:51.960 --> 2:15:53.960]  That we could hope for out of some of these guys
[2:15:53.960 --> 2:15:55.960]  In the legislature
[2:15:55.960 --> 2:15:57.960]  Seeing as how they were more fixated
[2:15:57.960 --> 2:15:59.960]  On trying to get toll roads passed
[2:15:59.960 --> 2:16:01.960]  Than anything else
[2:16:01.960 --> 2:16:03.960]  But it was a step in the right direction
[2:16:03.960 --> 2:16:05.960]  So that we have some sort of
[2:16:05.960 --> 2:16:07.960]  Measuring stick to hold these guys accountable
[2:16:07.960 --> 2:16:09.960]  Because at the point
[2:16:09.960 --> 2:16:11.960]  That the federal government oversteps
[2:16:11.960 --> 2:16:13.960]  Its constitutional authority
[2:16:13.960 --> 2:16:15.960]  Which guaranteed it's done
[2:16:15.960 --> 2:16:17.960]  Many many times since the house
[2:16:17.960 --> 2:16:19.960]  Passed that resolution
[2:16:19.960 --> 2:16:21.960]  Then the legislators are all of a sudden
[2:16:21.960 --> 2:16:23.960]  Not made it, I mean was it just pillow talk?
[2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:25.960]  And that's in essence
[2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:28.960]  What the whole crux of HCR 50 was
[2:16:28.960 --> 2:16:30.960]  Well that would be an amazing
[2:16:30.960 --> 2:16:32.960]  Exactly, that would be an amazing message
[2:16:32.960 --> 2:16:34.960]  For the globalist because there is no
[2:16:34.960 --> 2:16:36.960]  Federal republic anymore
[2:16:36.960 --> 2:16:39.960]  Is to have Texas and a few other states break off
[2:16:39.960 --> 2:16:41.960]  And then that would really get everybody's attention
[2:16:41.960 --> 2:16:43.960]  That hey, the feds are illegitimate
[2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:45.960]  They're out of control
[2:16:45.960 --> 2:16:47.960]  Imagine how great Texas would be
[2:16:47.960 --> 2:16:49.960]  With a 100 mile an hour speed limit
[2:16:49.960 --> 2:16:51.960]  Down to almost nothing
[2:16:51.960 --> 2:16:53.960]  All the business would move in here
[2:16:53.960 --> 2:16:55.960]  Oh, you know open
[2:16:55.960 --> 2:16:57.960]  Vermont
[2:16:57.960 --> 2:16:59.960]  Second amendment, you know open carry
[2:16:59.960 --> 2:17:01.960]  Just, I mean just
[2:17:01.960 --> 2:17:03.960]  Oh, I'd love it, absolutely
[2:17:03.960 --> 2:17:05.960]  I mean I want wild west
[2:17:05.960 --> 2:17:07.960]  Libertarian all the way
[2:17:07.960 --> 2:17:09.960]  This place, it would just be awesome
[2:17:09.960 --> 2:17:11.960]  Well, Alex let me throw this at you
[2:17:11.960 --> 2:17:13.960]  Because I think this is important
[2:17:13.960 --> 2:17:15.960]  For you to understand about
[2:17:15.960 --> 2:17:18.960]  What this means and for all the listeners out there
[2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:21.960]  Is this means for the first time ever
[2:17:21.960 --> 2:17:24.960]  That people here in Texas have a say
[2:17:24.960 --> 2:17:26.960]  In how they are governed
[2:17:26.960 --> 2:17:28.960]  You know we have dealt with
[2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:30.960]  People are concerned about global encroachment
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:32.960]  In the United States government
[2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:34.960]  Folks it's here, I mean it's here
[2:17:34.960 --> 2:17:36.960]  We're already conquered, that's a fact
[2:17:36.960 --> 2:17:38.960]  Yeah, I mean you know
[2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:40.960]  We're gonna get the country back, we gotta admit
[2:17:40.960 --> 2:17:42.960]  We are totally controlled by offshore banks
[2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:44.960]  Yeah, there's no doubt about it
[2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:46.960]  I mean anyone who thinks that the globalists
[2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:48.960]  Are going to take over the United States
[2:17:48.960 --> 2:17:50.960]  Needs to wake up and realize that it's been done
[2:17:50.960 --> 2:17:52.960]  You know the United States, the bankers
[2:17:52.960 --> 2:17:54.960]  The globalists, I mean the United States
[2:17:54.960 --> 2:17:56.960]  Is the muscle for these guys
[2:17:56.960 --> 2:17:58.960]  And this is really kind of
[2:17:58.960 --> 2:18:00.960]  The big issue that we have and
[2:18:00.960 --> 2:18:02.960]  As Texans we have to make a determination
[2:18:02.960 --> 2:18:04.960]  Is that something that we want to
[2:18:04.960 --> 2:18:06.960]  To stand for or do we want
[2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:08.960]  To go off on our own path
[2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:10.960]  You know when the Titanic is sinking
[2:18:10.960 --> 2:18:12.960]  That furniture's sliding off the deck
[2:18:12.960 --> 2:18:14.960]  And you've got a good lifeboat over here
[2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:16.960]  And you know honestly it's got a speedboat
[2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:18.960]  Given the statistics for Texas
[2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:20.960]  And its economic viability
[2:18:20.960 --> 2:18:22.960]  Do you want to sit down and argue
[2:18:22.960 --> 2:18:24.960]  About the color of the drapes in the ballroom
[2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:26.960]  Of the Titanic or do you want to get the heck off the ship
[2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:28.960]  Well my only concern is
[2:18:28.960 --> 2:18:30.960]  The media will put a bunch of lunatics and camo
[2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:32.960]  Waving guns around with gold crowns
[2:18:32.960 --> 2:18:34.960]  On their heads, I mean just
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:36.960]  Total white trash and air-dwells
[2:18:36.960 --> 2:18:38.960]  Not all of them but a lot of them
[2:18:38.960 --> 2:18:40.960]  And then say that's who we are
[2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:42.960]  How are you gonna try to
[2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:44.960]  Be a, well you know Alex
[2:18:44.960 --> 2:18:46.960]  It's by doing things exactly
[2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:48.960]  Like this, you know talking
[2:18:48.960 --> 2:18:50.960]  On your program because I know
[2:18:50.960 --> 2:18:52.960]  You are not that, you know
[2:18:52.960 --> 2:18:54.960]  I know that that's not what you are
[2:18:54.960 --> 2:18:56.960]  And I know that your listeners are not that
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:18:58.960]  And I know that by and large
[2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:00.960]  There are a lot of people out there
[2:19:00.960 --> 2:19:02.960]  That are, you know they are
[2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:04.960]  Professionals I can tell by looking at our membership
[2:19:04.960 --> 2:19:06.960]  You know from all socioeconomic groups
[2:19:06.960 --> 2:19:08.960]  From all various political backgrounds
[2:19:08.960 --> 2:19:10.960]  You know these guys understand
[2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:12.960]  That Texas independence
[2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:14.960]  Is the best thing for Texas
[2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:16.960]  So you know when they want to
[2:19:16.960 --> 2:19:18.960]  When the media, the spin doctors
[2:19:18.960 --> 2:19:20.960]  Up there in the federal city
[2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:22.960]  Decide that they want to paint us
[2:19:22.960 --> 2:19:24.960]  With a brush that's extremist
[2:19:24.960 --> 2:19:26.960]  Then what we do is we reinforce
[2:19:26.960 --> 2:19:28.960]  That we are engaging in a peaceful
[2:19:28.960 --> 2:19:30.960]  Political process
[2:19:30.960 --> 2:19:32.960]  Well I tell you, I mean you've seen the polls
[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:34.960]  From 60 to 30% depending
[2:19:34.960 --> 2:19:36.960]  On how it's asked, want to secede
[2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:38.960]  And my point is that the republic's already gone
[2:19:38.960 --> 2:19:40.960]  Texas has no choice
[2:19:40.960 --> 2:19:42.960]  And in a way
[2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:44.960]  It'd be better if a good group like yours did it
[2:19:44.960 --> 2:19:46.960]  Instead of the globalist breaking us off
[2:19:46.960 --> 2:19:48.960]  As part of Mexico
[2:19:48.960 --> 2:19:50.960]  And a part of Auslan
[2:19:50.960 --> 2:19:52.960]  And the Lurie Conquista
[2:19:52.960 --> 2:19:54.960]  Stay there sir, we'll also give folks your website
[2:19:54.960 --> 2:20:22.960]  On the other side of this quick break as well
[2:20:24.960 --> 2:20:48.960]  So what are you waiting for?
[2:20:48.960 --> 2:20:58.960]  Go to pepperspray.com
[2:20:58.960 --> 2:21:00.960]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources
[2:21:00.960 --> 2:21:02.960]  July 2nd 2009
[2:21:02.960 --> 2:21:04.960]  Goal opened this morning at 9.32.30
[2:21:04.960 --> 2:21:06.960]  A one ounce gold coin to be purchased for
[2:21:06.960 --> 2:21:10.960]  9.59.11, 4.79.55 for a half ounce
[2:21:10.960 --> 2:21:12.960]  And 2.39.78 for a quarter ounce
[2:21:12.960 --> 2:21:16.960]  That's 9.59.11, 4.79.55 and 2.39.78
[2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:18.960]  How is it that we the people
[2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:20.960]  Grow the cotton, weave it into fabric
[2:21:20.960 --> 2:21:22.960]  Engrave the ink, embed the strips
[2:21:22.960 --> 2:21:24.960]  And fibers that protect it from counterfeit
[2:21:24.960 --> 2:21:26.960]  Then cart the money off to a privately owned bank
[2:21:26.960 --> 2:21:28.960]  To have it lent back to us at interest
[2:21:28.960 --> 2:21:30.960]  Forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt
[2:21:30.960 --> 2:21:32.960]  Is this capitalism or was Jefferson
[2:21:32.960 --> 2:21:34.960]  Correct when he said
[2:21:34.960 --> 2:21:36.960]  A central bank issuing a public currency
[2:21:36.960 --> 2:21:38.960]  Is a greater menace to the liberties of the people
[2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:40.960]  In a standing army
[2:21:40.960 --> 2:21:42.960]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar
[2:21:42.960 --> 2:21:44.960]  Inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works
[2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:46.960]  Call for your copy
[2:21:46.960 --> 2:21:48.960]  1-800-686-2237
[2:21:48.960 --> 2:21:50.960]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[2:21:50.960 --> 2:21:52.960]  Call 800-686-2237
[2:21:52.960 --> 2:21:54.960]  That's 800-686-2237
[2:21:58.960 --> 2:22:00.960]  In the New World Order's war against humanity
[2:22:00.960 --> 2:22:02.960]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[2:22:02.960 --> 2:22:04.960]  We've got to give them a steak
[2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:06.960]  In creating the kind of world order
[2:22:06.960 --> 2:22:08.960]  That I think all of us would like to see
[2:22:08.960 --> 2:22:10.960]  The Obama deception
[2:22:10.960 --> 2:22:12.960]  Completely destroys the myth
[2:22:12.960 --> 2:22:14.960]  That Obama is working for the best interest
[2:22:14.960 --> 2:22:16.960]  Of the American people
[2:22:16.960 --> 2:22:18.960]  Well, Obama's already fudging
[2:22:18.960 --> 2:22:20.960]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election
[2:22:20.960 --> 2:22:22.960]  If you have a demagogue
[2:22:22.960 --> 2:22:24.960]  With a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[2:22:24.960 --> 2:22:26.960]  Who is imposing the program
[2:22:26.960 --> 2:22:28.960]  Of a group of extreme bankers
[2:22:28.960 --> 2:22:30.960]  And finance oligarchs
[2:22:30.960 --> 2:22:32.960]  That's fascism
[2:22:34.960 --> 2:22:36.960]  It's not about left to right
[2:22:36.960 --> 2:22:38.960]  It's about a one-world government
[2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:40.960]  This film documents who Obama works for
[2:22:40.960 --> 2:22:42.960]  The lies he is told
[2:22:42.960 --> 2:22:44.960]  And his real agenda

[2:24:14.960 --> 2:24:16.960]  TexasNationalist.com
[2:24:16.960 --> 2:24:18.960]  Here's the website
[2:24:18.960 --> 2:24:20.960]  TexasNationalist.com
[2:24:20.960 --> 2:24:22.960]  We're gonna keep our guests about five minutes into the next segment
[2:24:22.960 --> 2:24:24.960]  And then I'll do that news blitz
[2:24:24.960 --> 2:24:26.960]  But I'm gonna have to tell you, I've looked at their site
[2:24:26.960 --> 2:24:28.960]  I like their principles, I like their ideas
[2:24:28.960 --> 2:24:30.960]  Ever since I grew up
[2:24:30.960 --> 2:24:32.960]  It was we're our own country with a lone star
[2:24:32.960 --> 2:24:34.960]  We entered by treaty
[2:24:34.960 --> 2:24:36.960]  Not by annexation
[2:24:36.960 --> 2:24:38.960]  Not as a territory
[2:24:38.960 --> 2:24:40.960]  But we entered by treaty
[2:24:40.960 --> 2:24:42.960]  And then didn't relinquish any of our rights
[2:24:42.960 --> 2:24:44.960]  And so Texas is special
[2:24:44.960 --> 2:24:46.960]  And it's a great state
[2:24:46.960 --> 2:24:48.960]  But I know the globalists
[2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:50.960]  Want to destroy the republic
[2:24:50.960 --> 2:24:52.960]  So I also have a love of the United States
[2:24:52.960 --> 2:24:54.960]  I know we're not perfect, but I'm red, white and blue folks
[2:24:54.960 --> 2:24:56.960]  But that doesn't exist anymore
[2:24:56.960 --> 2:24:58.960]  And I believe we need
[2:24:58.960 --> 2:25:00.960]  To have Texas stand up and declare sovereignty
[2:25:00.960 --> 2:25:02.960]  And through states' rights
[2:25:02.960 --> 2:25:04.960]  States' rights is a national power
[2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:06.960]  It's a confederation
[2:25:06.960 --> 2:25:08.960]  We can declare sovereignty
[2:25:08.960 --> 2:25:10.960]  The equivalent of secession
[2:25:10.960 --> 2:25:12.960]  And say no to the globalist
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:14.960]  What is your plan, sir?
[2:25:14.960 --> 2:25:16.960]  What is your plan to go out
[2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:18.960]  And reach out to Texans
[2:25:18.960 --> 2:25:20.960]  And to tell them the truth
[2:25:20.960 --> 2:25:22.960]  And then how will we break these bonds
[2:25:22.960 --> 2:25:24.960]  Or reestablish
[2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:26.960]  Our sovereignty above the feds?
[2:25:26.960 --> 2:25:28.960]  Well, Alex, we're doing that right now
[2:25:28.960 --> 2:25:30.960]  I'll tell you
[2:25:30.960 --> 2:25:32.960]  One of the things is
[2:25:32.960 --> 2:25:34.960]  And I'm going to tell you right now
[2:25:34.960 --> 2:25:36.960]  I'm not a fan
[2:25:36.960 --> 2:25:38.960]  Of Rick Perry
[2:25:38.960 --> 2:25:40.960]  But one thing happened
[2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:42.960]  That really got this said in the minds of people
[2:25:42.960 --> 2:25:44.960]  That one of the biggest obstacles
[2:25:44.960 --> 2:25:46.960]  That we've had to overcome in the past
[2:25:46.960 --> 2:25:48.960]  Is the feeling
[2:25:48.960 --> 2:25:50.960]  On the part of people that secession
[2:25:50.960 --> 2:25:52.960]  Or independence
[2:25:52.960 --> 2:25:54.960]  Was unlawful
[2:25:54.960 --> 2:25:56.960]  And it was one of the major hurdles
[2:25:56.960 --> 2:25:58.960]  That we had to clear in the minds of people
[2:25:58.960 --> 2:26:00.960]  They believed secession was treason
[2:26:00.960 --> 2:26:02.960]  And when Perry came out
[2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:04.960]  And said we could secede
[2:26:04.960 --> 2:26:06.960]  They went, wow, that's a great point
[2:26:06.960 --> 2:26:08.960]  Yeah, it basically removed the taboo
[2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:10.960]  This went from being talked about
[2:26:10.960 --> 2:26:12.960]  And hushed whispers in the backs of rooms
[2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:14.960]  To being talked about in cafes
[2:26:14.960 --> 2:26:16.960]  And restaurants and at dinner tables
[2:26:16.960 --> 2:26:18.960]  All across Texas
[2:26:18.960 --> 2:26:20.960]  It removed that first stumbling block
[2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:22.960]  So now
[2:26:22.960 --> 2:26:24.960]  What we're doing is
[2:26:24.960 --> 2:26:26.960]  We're organizing to mobilize
[2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:28.960]  And that's really what this is about
[2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:30.960]  Our chapters are forming
[2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:32.960]  In counties all throughout Texas right now
[2:26:32.960 --> 2:26:34.960]  Because we understand totally
[2:26:34.960 --> 2:26:36.960]  That there's going to be
[2:26:36.960 --> 2:26:38.960]  An organized effort
[2:26:38.960 --> 2:26:40.960]  To not only get this message across
[2:26:40.960 --> 2:26:42.960]  But ultimately speaking, the people of Texas
[2:26:42.960 --> 2:26:44.960]  Are going to have to have them say a yes
[2:26:44.960 --> 2:26:46.960]  Because of article one, section two
[2:26:46.960 --> 2:26:48.960]  Well, Daniel, let me guess your strategy
[2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:50.960]  I haven't really looked into it, but I would imagine
[2:26:50.960 --> 2:26:52.960]  Take the anti toll road movement
[2:26:52.960 --> 2:26:54.960]  Which they, even in the
[2:26:54.960 --> 2:26:56.960]  Dallas Morning News said
[2:26:56.960 --> 2:26:58.960]  Could cause rebellion
[2:26:58.960 --> 2:27:00.960]  In the state and has already created
[2:27:00.960 --> 2:27:02.960]  Massive unrest, that's a quote
[2:27:02.960 --> 2:27:04.960]  And that's true
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:06.960]  As people learn that a Spanish company
[2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:08.960]  Isn't just getting the land for basically nothing
[2:27:08.960 --> 2:27:10.960]  For buying off politicians
[2:27:10.960 --> 2:27:12.960]  But ten miles on each side of every road
[2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:14.960]  That they're going to take it and not even give you
[2:27:14.960 --> 2:27:16.960]  Proper value
[2:27:16.960 --> 2:27:18.960]  And you've got Texas landowners getting this
[2:27:18.960 --> 2:27:20.960]  Texas Bill of Rights letter from the state
[2:27:20.960 --> 2:27:22.960]  Which says you don't have any rights
[2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:24.960]  We can take your land, you take our first offer
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:26.960]  Or we just take it in six weeks
[2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:28.960]  To six months
[2:27:28.960 --> 2:27:30.960]  You take that movement because the globalists
[2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:32.960]  Aren't going to stop looting us
[2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:34.960]  And you start educating and you capture
[2:27:34.960 --> 2:27:36.960]  The attention of the anti toll road movement
[2:27:36.960 --> 2:27:38.960]  This could happen
[2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:40.960]  Yeah, I mean, and we're seeing that right now
[2:27:40.960 --> 2:27:42.960]  You know, what we saw was
[2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:44.960]  When these tea parties and the things
[2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:46.960]  Things like that rolled around
[2:27:46.960 --> 2:27:48.960]  It really flushed a lot of people out
[2:27:48.960 --> 2:27:50.960]  Because people are pretty angry
[2:27:50.960 --> 2:27:52.960]  About what's going on and they have been for a long time
[2:27:52.960 --> 2:27:54.960]  And it kind of flushed them out
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:27:56.960]  But the one thing that it did was
[2:27:56.960 --> 2:27:58.960]  While everyone were at these
[2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:00.960]  Various tea parties, these various events
[2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:02.960]  Venting about the
[2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:04.960]  Hell that the federal government is putting
[2:28:04.960 --> 2:28:06.960]  One of us through, the one thing
[2:28:06.960 --> 2:28:08.960]  That was lacking at virtually
[2:28:08.960 --> 2:28:10.960]  Every one of those was a solution
[2:28:10.960 --> 2:28:12.960]  And this is what people need to understand
[2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:14.960]  The common element among
[2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:16.960]  All of these problems that these people are upset about
[2:28:16.960 --> 2:28:18.960]  Is federal government
[2:28:18.960 --> 2:28:20.960]  The federal control, this relationship
[2:28:20.960 --> 2:28:22.960]  Between the states that has grown
[2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:24.960]  Into Frankenstein's monster
[2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:26.960]  And the way that here in Texas
[2:28:26.960 --> 2:28:28.960]  That we solve those problems is we remove
[2:28:28.960 --> 2:28:30.960]  The federal government from the picture
[2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:32.960]  You know, my daddy was an iron worker
[2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:34.960]  For five years, Alex, I mean
[2:28:34.960 --> 2:28:36.960]  He was a hard working blue collar guy
[2:28:36.960 --> 2:28:38.960]  And he taught me a principle
[2:28:38.960 --> 2:28:40.960]  He said the best government is the one
[2:28:40.960 --> 2:28:42.960]  That you gotta drive the shortest distance to
[2:28:42.960 --> 2:28:44.960]  To beat the crap out of somebody
[2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:46.960]  If they cross you and try to step on your rights
[2:28:46.960 --> 2:28:48.960]  Yeah
[2:28:48.960 --> 2:28:50.960]  So, you know, this is in essence
[2:28:50.960 --> 2:28:52.960]  What we're talking about
[2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:54.960]  We return the power back to Texas
[2:28:54.960 --> 2:28:56.960]  You know, the 10th amendment is a good gateway for that
[2:28:56.960 --> 2:28:58.960]  It is a good gateway
[2:28:58.960 --> 2:29:00.960]  But ultimately what we're going to have
[2:29:00.960 --> 2:29:02.960]  Is we, when Texas gains its independence
[2:29:02.960 --> 2:29:04.960]  When we start down this path
[2:29:04.960 --> 2:29:06.960]  If anyone, if anyone out there
[2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:08.960]  Thinks that other states are not
[2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:10.960]  Going to follow suit, they are deluding themselves
[2:29:10.960 --> 2:29:12.960]  At this point
[2:29:12.960 --> 2:29:14.960]  And to piggyback on something you said a while ago
[2:29:14.960 --> 2:29:16.960]  You talked about the Azulon movement
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:18.960]  And Reconquisa, you know, in essence
[2:29:18.960 --> 2:29:20.960]  With what the globalists are doing
[2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:22.960]  Texas independence is an inevitability
[2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:24.960]  And I say that a lot
[2:29:24.960 --> 2:29:26.960]  But Texas independence is an inevitability
[2:29:26.960 --> 2:29:28.960]  Hard explain it to us
[2:29:28.960 --> 2:29:30.960]  You know, explain it on the other side
[2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:32.960]  Look at California
[2:29:32.960 --> 2:29:34.960]  Totally federalized, totally bankrupt
[2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:36.960]  It's got a foreigner
[2:29:36.960 --> 2:29:38.960]  Who says he wants to be Hitler running it
[2:29:38.960 --> 2:29:40.960]  Looks like a complete clown
[2:29:40.960 --> 2:29:42.960]  The feds are taking it over
[2:29:42.960 --> 2:29:44.960]  It's either they take us over or we declare our sovereignty
[2:29:44.960 --> 2:29:46.960]  Unfortunately, you're probably right
[2:29:46.960 --> 2:29:48.960]  The question is how are we going to do it
[2:29:48.960 --> 2:29:50.960]  We're on the march
[2:29:50.960 --> 2:29:52.960]  The Empire's on the run
[2:29:52.960 --> 2:29:54.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[2:30:22.960 --> 2:30:24.960]  It would be impossible to blend this up

[2:30:56.960 --> 2:30:58.960]  You should consider buying
[2:30:58.960 --> 2:31:00.960]  A solar power generator this summer
[2:31:00.960 --> 2:31:02.960]  Number 1, new climate legislation
[2:31:02.960 --> 2:31:04.960]  Could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:31:04.960 --> 2:31:06.960]  Number 2, our new energies are
[2:31:06.960 --> 2:31:08.960]  Wants to control how much power
[2:31:08.960 --> 2:31:10.960]  Your electric company allows you to have
[2:31:10.960 --> 2:31:12.960]  It's true, total government control
[2:31:12.960 --> 2:31:14.960]  Of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:31:14.960 --> 2:31:16.960]  Technology is coming
[2:31:16.960 --> 2:31:18.960]  Number 3, in some areas of the country
[2:31:18.960 --> 2:31:20.960]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:31:20.960 --> 2:31:22.960]  Especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[2:31:22.960 --> 2:31:24.960]  Number 4, the hurricane and dangerous
[2:31:24.960 --> 2:31:26.960]  Summer storm season is here again
[2:31:26.960 --> 2:31:28.960]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
