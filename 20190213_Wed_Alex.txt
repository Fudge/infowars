[00:00.000 --> 00:07.400]  It's February 13th on this Wednesday Global Transmission, huge broadcast coming up.
[00:07.400 --> 00:12.220]  But first, let's take a closer look while reporters are on the ground when Pito O'Rourke
[00:12.220 --> 00:13.720]  was spewing his pure BS.
[00:13.720 --> 00:20.960]  But a young man who's got very little going for himself, except he's got a great first
[00:20.960 --> 00:27.520]  name, he is, he challenged us.
[00:27.520 --> 00:35.040]  So we have, let's say, 35,000 people tonight, and he has 200 people, 300 people, not too
[00:35.040 --> 00:36.440]  good.
[00:36.440 --> 00:42.520]  Of course, following the El Paso, Texas Beto vs. Trump challenge, numbers for those in
[00:42.520 --> 00:45.240]  attendance were all over the map.
[00:45.240 --> 00:52.080]  Claims from 65 people to over 10,000 are floating around for the turnout for Beto O'Rourke.
[00:52.080 --> 00:57.440]  However, video from Beto's speech shows a very sparse crowd.
[00:57.440 --> 01:02.360]  In fact, C-SPAN mysteriously dropped their coverage of the Beto O'Rourke rally at the
[01:02.360 --> 01:06.440]  last minute, while Trump's numbers were blatantly obvious.
[01:06.440 --> 01:13.360]  Thank you very much, El Paso, thank you very much.
[01:13.360 --> 01:19.920]  Unlike Beto's rally, Trump's rally was infiltrated by flare-ups of anti-Trump protesters.
[01:19.920 --> 01:27.000]  Is there any place that's more fun to be than a Trump rally?
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.720]  In fact, the Gateway Pundit reported that the Latino man that reportedly violently attacked
[01:32.720 --> 01:38.440]  the BBC reporter in the nest of the mainstream media may have been doing what is known as
[01:38.440 --> 01:44.040]  bird-dogging, a far-left tactic where you pretend to be a Trump supporter, as he still
[01:44.040 --> 01:49.480]  had a tag on his MAGA hat and he was awkwardly disappeared right after the incident.
[01:49.480 --> 02:16.640]  Of course, the media will run with this as they continue to blame Trump for every conceivable
[02:16.640 --> 02:22.560]  thing under the sun, for instance, impeachment zealot Al Green's insistence that Trump is
[02:22.560 --> 02:28.800]  responsible for Virginia Governor Northam and his Attorney General's blackface embarrassment,
[02:28.800 --> 02:32.520]  but President Trump addressed that issue with clarity.
[02:32.520 --> 02:46.640]  Democrats are also pushing extreme, late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from
[02:46.640 --> 02:51.200]  their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth.
[02:51.200 --> 02:52.880]  What's that all about?
[02:52.880 --> 03:00.240]  So in Virginia, the governor, he's gotten a little publicity lately, I like him, keeps
[03:00.240 --> 03:05.880]  us out of the papers, I like to find a few more guys like this one.
[03:05.880 --> 03:10.720]  He almost moonwalked, his wife stopped him, darling, darling, it would be inappropriate.
[03:10.720 --> 03:20.520]  But the governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the
[03:20.520 --> 03:27.920]  world and wrap the baby and make the baby comfortable and then talk to the mother and
[03:27.920 --> 03:34.680]  talk to the father and then execute the baby, execute the baby.
[03:34.680 --> 03:42.160]  Millions of innocent, beautiful babies are counting on us to protect them, and we will.
[03:42.160 --> 03:47.440]  In fact, if you look at McCallan, if you look at San Diego, if you look at all points in
[03:47.440 --> 03:53.600]  between, the U.S. cities of the U.S.-Mexico border are far safer than the U.S. cities
[03:53.600 --> 03:57.760]  deeper in the interior of the United States of America.
[03:57.760 --> 04:02.920]  It all came down to the wall, and Beto and his supporters are on the wrong side of that
[04:02.920 --> 04:08.720]  wall and history and the truth and the border for that matter, as the majority of Beto's
[04:08.720 --> 04:16.040]  supporters were holding Mexican flags.
[04:16.040 --> 04:21.580]  What happened in El Paso was a preview of what's to come as 2020 draws closer.
[04:21.580 --> 04:28.080]  We can surely expect the Democrats to roll out more deception and a contempt for common
[04:28.080 --> 04:29.080]  sense.
[04:29.080 --> 04:54.260]  John Bowne reporting.
[04:59.080 --> 05:16.180]  My leaps and my bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[05:16.180 --> 05:21.940]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[05:21.940 --> 05:26.380]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in
[05:26.380 --> 05:28.820]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[05:28.820 --> 05:35.420]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[05:35.420 --> 05:38.300]  and beyond system in the world.
[05:38.300 --> 05:40.700]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[05:40.700 --> 05:45.260]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packets to mix in with fruit
[05:45.260 --> 05:47.740]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[05:47.740 --> 05:51.580]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half packet the
[05:51.580 --> 05:55.580]  first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you
[05:55.580 --> 05:57.580]  into overdrive.
[05:57.580 --> 06:04.580]  Go to TurboForce and enforcelive.com.
[06:04.580 --> 06:15.460]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[06:15.460 --> 06:32.460]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial commentaries.
[06:32.460 --> 06:49.460]  It's a big idea, a new world order.
[06:49.460 --> 07:06.960]  It's made it to be free of charge.
[07:06.960 --> 07:17.220]  In fact, they ad vinegar orders.
[07:17.220 --> 07:21.520]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in America.
[07:21.520 --> 07:23.580]  This is global governance at last.
[07:23.580 --> 07:24.580]  Is it one world?
[07:24.580 --> 07:26.080]  The central bank is in charge.
[07:26.080 --> 07:30.220]  Aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[07:30.220 --> 07:32.220]  1776 will commence again!
[07:32.220 --> 07:36.220]  If you're proud to take our firearms, do you understand?
[07:36.220 --> 07:45.220]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[07:45.220 --> 07:47.220]  Waging war on corruption.
[07:47.220 --> 07:49.220]  It's Alex Jones.
[07:49.220 --> 07:53.220]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[08:01.220 --> 08:04.220]  Coming to you from Austin, Texas.
[08:04.220 --> 08:06.220]  Right here on Planet Earth.
[08:06.220 --> 08:09.220]  It's Wednesday, February 13, 2019.
[08:09.220 --> 08:12.220]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[08:12.220 --> 08:20.220]  Promoting a pro-liberty, pro-truth, pro-human, pro-family, pro-god, pro-beyond-the-stars future.
[08:20.220 --> 08:22.220]  Globalist.
[08:22.220 --> 08:25.220]  Promoting the exact opposite.
[08:25.220 --> 08:33.220]  Well, I'm particularly focused today and I've got a particularly powerful mapped out transmission for you.
[08:33.220 --> 08:39.220]  I don't think anybody that's been listening lately can deny the broadcast have been particularly piercing.
[08:39.220 --> 08:44.220]  But the guests, the research, the reports, everything, because the times demanded.
[08:44.220 --> 08:51.220]  Many a historian and many an individual like Winston Churchill pointed out that a lot of times it's not that a person's that great,
[08:51.220 --> 08:56.220]  but that they are getting incredible times and they step up making themselves great.
[08:56.220 --> 09:01.220]  And that's where we all are deciding whether we're going to be bystanders to tyranny and be run over by it,
[09:01.220 --> 09:05.220]  whether we're going to be part of the animating contest of Lieberta.
[09:05.220 --> 09:09.220]  Leo Zagami with unbelievable developments inside the Vatican.
[09:09.220 --> 09:12.220]  Even one guardian says the Vatican is set to collapse.
[09:12.220 --> 09:14.220]  Four in five priests are gay.
[09:14.220 --> 09:21.220]  They're reporting that up to 20 to 30% are pedophiles and that is basically now a giant sex cult.
[09:21.220 --> 09:23.220]  That's what took it over.
[09:23.220 --> 09:24.220]  Confirming everything we break down.
[09:24.220 --> 09:27.220]  He'll be joining us from Rome, Mike Adams as well.
[09:27.220 --> 09:32.220]  A bunch of special reports and some surprise guests will probably be popping in if not today, tomorrow.
[09:32.220 --> 09:34.220]  I'm going to leave it at that for you.
[09:34.220 --> 09:41.220]  Let me just give you a little preview of what's on the menu today.
[09:41.220 --> 09:43.220]  Trump is expected.
[09:43.220 --> 09:47.220]  We were told this morning to sign the bipartisan bill, but he said, no, I haven't seen it yet.
[09:47.220 --> 09:58.220]  And reportedly, as we speak, noon Eastern, the bill is being transmitted to the White House for the president to look at it.
[09:58.220 --> 10:04.220]  So Reuters and others were reporting earlier that he was expected.
[10:04.220 --> 10:08.220]  Now Reuters is reporting and it's up on infowars.com.
[10:08.220 --> 10:16.220]  Trump noncommittal on weak funding for the border wall says we'll get the 23 billion needed total from other pots of money.
[10:16.220 --> 10:19.220]  It may not even need to declare an emergency.
[10:19.220 --> 10:23.220]  Well, we'll see what happens with that.
[10:23.220 --> 10:26.220]  We'll be detailing it more coming up.
[10:26.220 --> 10:29.220]  Just more upside down world statements by Democrats.
[10:29.220 --> 10:31.220]  We're going to get to, you know, Beto.
[10:31.220 --> 10:37.220]  I'm sorry, Peter O'Rourke, the carpet backer here in Texas with his Bernie Sanders, Connecticut accent.
[10:37.220 --> 10:39.220]  Nothing is being from Connecticut.
[10:39.220 --> 10:41.220]  It's funny.
[10:41.220 --> 10:43.220]  He's got a Connecticut accent.
[10:43.220 --> 10:46.220]  He is Vermont accent, I guess.
[10:46.220 --> 10:55.220]  He is running around saying that walls kill people and walls are immoral while he's all encircled by a wall and armed police in El Paso.
[10:55.220 --> 10:59.220]  Where he gave a speech while now,
[10:59.220 --> 11:09.220]  Congresswoman Indez, who was very close to being convicted for having sex reportedly with 13, 14-year-old girls in the Dominican Republic and other areas.
[11:09.220 --> 11:11.220]  So he doesn't even know what criminal activity is.
[11:11.220 --> 11:14.220]  He says classifying drunk drivers as criminal is wrong.
[11:14.220 --> 11:16.220]  Yes, you heard me right.
[11:16.220 --> 11:18.220]  That video is coming up.
[11:18.220 --> 11:19.220]  It's just insane.
[11:19.220 --> 11:21.220]  And then Ted Cruz's really great idea.
[11:21.220 --> 11:23.220]  Really great idea.
[11:23.220 --> 11:32.220]  Asset for which are seizure in general, inside conus and against citizens is unconstitutional and very dangerous and out of control.
[11:32.220 --> 11:35.220]  And I want it reformed until people are convicted.
[11:35.220 --> 11:37.220]  Then it's constitutional.
[11:37.220 --> 11:43.220]  But on the border, Katie bar the door.
[11:43.220 --> 11:45.220]  That's where you're supposed to seize illegal stuff.
[11:45.220 --> 11:48.220]  And it's just a procedure and that would fund it.
[11:48.220 --> 11:57.220]  I mean, 14 billion in the coffers and different assets of El Chapo, that'll fund most of the wall right there.
[11:57.220 --> 12:08.220]  Now, I'm going to make an announcement right now that if people let this sink in, we'll change the future destiny, not just of this nation, but the world.
[12:08.220 --> 12:17.220]  It's so huge, but at the same time, it's so incredibly simple that it boggles the mind that people don't understand this.
[12:17.220 --> 12:21.220]  And I know most of you will understand it and already understand it once I say it.
[12:21.220 --> 12:31.220]  But it's such a simple idea and such a true idea, but it's not grasped by most of us, including myself.
[12:31.220 --> 12:38.220]  When we go and spend money with big globalist, anti-American anti-family corporations.
[12:38.220 --> 12:45.220]  We are amassing power for them and allowing them to dictate our lives, but they already control almost everything.
[12:45.220 --> 12:50.220]  So it's hard to not go to big establishment corporations.
[12:50.220 --> 12:52.220]  It's hard to make the right decisions.
[12:52.220 --> 12:57.220]  I do a lot of research now about where our crew goes, what hotels they stay at, what we do.
[12:57.220 --> 13:01.220]  Just trying to make sure we can find companies that are neutral and aren't anti-American.
[13:01.220 --> 13:03.220]  And Americans have voted.
[13:03.220 --> 13:05.220]  The Super Bowl was down 35%.
[13:05.220 --> 13:07.220]  The NFL is down 45% total.
[13:07.220 --> 13:11.220]  Same thing with the Oscars are down 80% in the last decade.
[13:11.220 --> 13:14.220]  The Emmys, the Grammys.
[13:14.220 --> 13:18.220]  The left is committing cultural and political suicide in front of all of us.
[13:18.220 --> 13:21.220]  So we voted culturally by tuning out.
[13:21.220 --> 13:23.220]  Problem is they just target our kids in the school.
[13:23.220 --> 13:34.220]  So what I'm getting at here is what you do with your word of mouth and what you do with your financial decisions you make is one of the most powerful votes you have.
[13:34.220 --> 13:46.220]  And the left is using boycotts and harassment and brigading and censorship and intimidation and antifa to try to crush nationalists from simply trying to be able to live our lives the way we wish.
[13:46.220 --> 13:49.220]  And they're using our open free society against us.
[13:49.220 --> 13:57.220]  But I was just sitting back last night thinking about the fact that they have all these Washington Posts and all these New York Observer and all these articles saying,
[13:57.220 --> 14:07.220]  Alan Jones is evil, he sells coffee, he sells horrible foods, he sells high quality supplements like fish oil, which everybody knows is great and turmeric.
[14:07.220 --> 14:14.220]  But they demonize that while every grocery store sells stuff that's adulterated and not as good and Whole Foods does and Amazon does.
[14:14.220 --> 14:26.220]  But Jeff Bezos' own Washington Post then attacks me and says, oh look, snake oil, even though a bunch of our products are private labeled highest quality that's actually sold in Whole Foods.
[14:26.220 --> 14:33.220]  That is where we get our private labeled products, some of which aren't proprietary or private labeled because they're high quality, it's sold by them.
[14:33.220 --> 14:36.220]  So they just don't want us funding ourselves.
[14:36.220 --> 14:46.220]  And if you'll simply get the Wake Up America coffee of your coffee drinkers and sign up for auto ship, if you'll simply sign up for auto ship every month for the global silver iodine fortified toothpaste, it'll change the world.
[14:46.220 --> 14:48.220]  It's just things you need over and over again.
[14:48.220 --> 14:51.220]  And then we can fight Soros and Hillary and hold the line.
[14:51.220 --> 14:55.220]  But that said, and I'll talk more about it later.
[14:55.220 --> 15:01.220]  The average protein bar sold at Whole Foods or even a gas station is about 450.
[15:01.220 --> 15:03.220]  They're adulterated, they're full of crap.
[15:03.220 --> 15:09.220]  We went out to some of the top firms, got beds, put out very tasty, delicious, had focus groups, test them.
[15:09.220 --> 15:20.220]  We actually went out and did marketing in multiple cities to see what was the tastiest, best, healthiest protein bar that we can sell to you at regular price for $3.
[15:20.220 --> 15:27.220]  Discounted out of the gates, it's $2.40, a pack of 12.
[15:27.220 --> 15:30.220]  This is our newest product at M4sLife.com.
[15:30.220 --> 15:33.220]  Now the media will say protein food is evil in the snake oil.
[15:33.220 --> 15:36.220]  But you get 12 bars, 15 grams of protein each one.
[15:36.220 --> 15:38.220]  Vanilla coconut is my favorite.
[15:38.220 --> 15:41.220]  We have the other right here as well.
[15:41.220 --> 15:44.220]  M4sLife protein bar, peanut butter and chocolate.
[15:44.220 --> 15:55.220]  This is a high end, high end protein bar of the highest quality at M4sLife.com for about half the price of major competitors.
[15:55.220 --> 15:59.220]  And then your funding supports the M4, a total 360 win.

[19:20.220 --> 19:30.220]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours,
[19:30.220 --> 19:40.220]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy, and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[19:40.220 --> 19:48.220]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com and get supermail vitality before it's gone. This is actually our last run of supermail vitality.

[19:57.220 --> 20:00.220]  From InfoWarsStore.com
[20:27.220 --> 20:31.220]  Now you're standing there sometimes
[20:31.220 --> 20:36.220]  You better let me live somewhere
[20:36.220 --> 20:40.220]  Hide what you have to hide
[20:40.220 --> 20:44.220]  And tell what you have to tell
[20:44.220 --> 20:48.220]  You'll see your problems multiply
[20:48.220 --> 20:50.220]  And you can tell
[20:50.220 --> 20:56.220]  While everybody else in the media is keeping their head down, we're charging forward.
[20:56.220 --> 20:58.220]  We're delivering the goods
[20:58.220 --> 21:05.220]  Because we can't let the women and children down
[21:05.220 --> 21:08.220]  There's still got to be men
[21:08.220 --> 21:10.220]  The globalist fear men
[21:10.220 --> 21:16.220]  Everything they do is to target men, to dumb them down, to confuse them, to arrest their development
[21:16.220 --> 21:21.220]  Because men carry the will to defend the species
[21:21.220 --> 21:25.220]  Women are the species and our union is holy
[21:25.220 --> 21:29.220]  And the enemy is attacking that with everything it's got
[21:29.220 --> 21:32.220]  Attacking this planet we're on
[21:32.220 --> 21:37.220]  The fallen one that fell to terra firma is amongst us
[21:37.220 --> 21:42.220]  Make no mistake, you can see the shape of what's already here and the shape of things to come
[21:42.220 --> 21:47.220]  Not of this world
[21:47.220 --> 21:51.220]  But the God of this world, little G
[21:51.220 --> 21:54.220]  Alright, here's what I want to do
[21:54.220 --> 22:00.220]  Next segment, I've had time to sit back and watch Howard Schultz
[22:00.220 --> 22:04.220]  And I didn't want to say this a few weeks ago, but I'm sure of it now
[22:04.220 --> 22:08.220]  And I know what his plan is, we'll get to that next segment
[22:08.220 --> 22:16.220]  Also, we're going to look at how that ties in with...
[22:16.220 --> 22:22.220]  We'll also look at how that ties into Bill Gates pushing for, quote, higher taxes on the rich
[22:22.220 --> 22:26.220]  Which when you realize the scam he's running, it's just outrageous
[22:26.220 --> 22:28.220]  That's coming up
[22:28.220 --> 22:42.220]  Also, I keep warning everybody that they had 50-50 votes on the Democratic Party Telecommunications Commission
[22:42.220 --> 22:45.220]  And on the FCC to start regulating the internet
[22:45.220 --> 22:52.220]  And they had 10 different senators, remember a few years ago, call for regulating Drudge Report and M4 Wars and Breitbart, saying just shut us down
[22:52.220 --> 22:55.220]  Because our speech is political, they say that's a political gift
[22:55.220 --> 22:57.220]  They can all be political all day
[22:57.220 --> 23:04.220]  Well, Democrat who sought to regulate Drudge running to represent Silicon Valley and California Senate
[23:04.220 --> 23:09.220]  So we're going to look at that as well
[23:09.220 --> 23:12.220]  And we're going to get into the latest, what appears to be a false flag
[23:12.220 --> 23:17.220]  I mean, I said the day it came out a week and a half ago, I said this sounds like a total false flag
[23:17.220 --> 23:24.220]  In the middle of a blizzard, it's 20 below when this happened, or even more below
[23:24.220 --> 23:27.220]  I was like, I'm seeing numbers even higher than that
[23:27.220 --> 23:36.220]  And two dudes in MAGA hats and ski masks attacked some guy who's got a hit TV show for total PR
[23:36.220 --> 23:39.220]  But there's cameras all over that area, dumbass
[23:39.220 --> 23:44.220]  So the police have you coming out of the building, going to your car, no one attacked you
[23:44.220 --> 23:50.220]  And I'm telling you, 99% of these race attacks and all this turn out to be fake
[23:50.220 --> 23:53.220]  But the Democrats keep doing it because it creates the victimology
[23:53.220 --> 24:02.220]  Did you hear the Air Force Academy or West Point or any of these groups the last couple years where people spray paint inward everywhere
[24:02.220 --> 24:12.220]  Or right on the vending machines, no inwards allowed, and then it's liberal black students doing it?
[24:12.220 --> 24:18.220]  That's how you're somebody in the leftist world, is you make yourself a victim
[24:18.220 --> 24:24.220]  So Empire Star, Jesse Mullet's story falling apart, we're going to look at that
[24:24.220 --> 24:30.220]  But it just never ends, it's like, Trump had to do an early state of the union because they were saying he was anti-Semitic
[24:30.220 --> 24:35.220]  Because he said, well, I hear this was probably staged by somebody to blame conservatives
[24:35.220 --> 24:41.220]  Because why would conservatives be in New Jersey tumping over Jewish headstones and spray painting swastikas on synagogues
[24:41.220 --> 24:45.220]  And it was the leftist Jew blaming Trump for it, and Trump was right
[24:45.220 --> 24:50.220]  It barely got any coverage even in local New Jersey news
[24:50.220 --> 24:57.220]  99% of the time, folks, these attacks are staged
[24:57.220 --> 25:03.220]  So we're going to get to that, but let me get to this first
[25:03.220 --> 25:06.220]  Let me get to this first
[25:06.220 --> 25:14.220]  Because we saw Peter O'Rourke, I'm sorry, Beto O'Rourke says that walls in lives are immoral and evil
[25:14.220 --> 25:19.220]  While he's behind a wall and police guarding him, we showed that yesterday, it's up on infowords.com
[25:19.220 --> 25:29.220]  Now, Democrat Senator Bob Menendez, who got indicted for underage girls and all this stuff and got found not guilty by the swamp jury
[25:29.220 --> 25:35.220]  The point is, he is flying and having sexual underage girls, so I guess he doesn't know what crime is
[25:35.220 --> 25:40.220]  He attacks Trump for classifying drunk driving illegals as criminal
[25:40.220 --> 25:42.220]  A, you're an illegal alien, you're here illegally
[25:42.220 --> 25:48.220]  When you fly down to Puerto Vallarta or Cancun, they say, what hotel are you staying at?
[25:48.220 --> 25:53.220]  And you tell them, and then you check off a card
[25:53.220 --> 25:56.220]  And then, a lot of the times, they call the hotel and check
[25:56.220 --> 26:01.220]  And when you get there, just like Interpol, they take your passport, they scan it
[26:01.220 --> 26:08.220]  They run you for any criminal warrants, you're being totally watched in Mexico, and then you go to your hotel room
[26:08.220 --> 26:15.220]  They're saying people with diseases, you name it, don't even get tested, you're in the country
[26:15.220 --> 26:19.220]  So you're already here committing a felony
[26:19.220 --> 26:24.220]  Oh, by the way, I've got friends and people I know, they're like, oh, Cancun's so great
[26:24.220 --> 26:28.220]  Or Eastland Maharas is so great, or any of those places
[26:28.220 --> 26:32.220]  I've been going to Cancun's, there were like 10 hotels, there were like 500
[26:32.220 --> 26:37.220]  And you stay there too, they could call in the hotel
[26:37.220 --> 26:40.220]  And they're like, Senor, please come down, there's like security waiting
[26:40.220 --> 26:45.220]  At the hotel, like, your flight was supposed to be yesterday, Southwest, back to Dallas
[26:45.220 --> 26:50.220]  People are like, oh, I thought we said, we need to talk to you now, no, now
[26:50.220 --> 26:55.220]  And they run you into a room and say, and they're like, we're going to give you a $2,000 fine
[26:55.220 --> 26:59.220]  And you're on the next plane out of here
[26:59.220 --> 27:05.220]  But we're like, oh, you got diseases, everything, just come on in, do whatever you want, this is crazy
[27:05.220 --> 27:09.220]  And now Mexico has allowed them to break the southern border completely
[27:09.220 --> 27:13.220]  And then Menendez, he's not the Dominican Republic, the 15-year-old girls
[27:13.220 --> 27:20.220]  He is now up here saying to say that someone already illegally who's arrested drunk driving, they're not a criminal
[27:20.220 --> 27:25.220]  This is the upside-down world, New York just said you can stab a baby to death, and it's not a crime
[27:25.220 --> 27:28.220]  Go ahead and roll it, here it is
[27:28.220 --> 27:37.220]  Zero tolerance policy that has turned everyone, regardless of their record, into a criminal
[27:37.220 --> 27:43.220]  For example, if you cross the border undocumented, he has now made you a criminal
[27:43.220 --> 27:48.220]  He is creating that problem by turning people away who legitimately seek asylum
[27:48.220 --> 27:56.220]  If a person has a driving while under the influence violation, he is now making that, saying that that's a criminal
[27:56.220 --> 28:02.220]  What we have seen in the past under, for example, President Obama, that violent criminals, yes
[28:02.220 --> 28:05.220]  We want to see those persons not only arrested in the table
[28:05.220 --> 28:10.220]  It's a total lie, in San Francisco the illegal alien shoots the woman in the back
[28:10.220 --> 28:15.220]  Shut it off please, an illegal alien shoots the woman in the back and it's not a problem
[28:15.220 --> 28:17.220]  Kills her, they're like, look, you go free
[28:17.220 --> 28:25.220]  So the guy's a total lying fraud, Obama let tens of thousands of children across unaccompanied into the U.S. who are put into sex slavery
[28:25.220 --> 28:31.220]  Which I'm sure Bob Menendez absolutely loves because if he doesn't look like a pedophile, Brian Stelter doesn't either
[28:31.220 --> 28:37.220]  Not saying Brian Stelter is a pedophile, saying he looks like something that would scare the hell out of me in the dark alley
[28:37.220 --> 28:43.220]  But Bob Menendez narrowly escaped all his pedophilia by the swamp jury not convicting him
[28:43.220 --> 28:46.220]  But he looks like a big old Bob Big Boy, man
[28:46.220 --> 28:49.220]  You can imagine those portal girls, those slave dungeons
[28:49.220 --> 28:53.220]  And here comes Bob Menendez into the room, toddling forward
[28:53.220 --> 28:54.220]  Stay with us
[28:54.220 --> 29:06.220]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you

[33:34.220 --> 33:40.220]  Totally committed, absolutely love it, but I don't want to lose, that means hey
[33:40.220 --> 33:45.220]  I personally don't want to be wiped out by the globalists, but we're already winning the war
[33:45.220 --> 33:48.220]  If I got to lose the battle myself, I'm ready to do it
[33:48.220 --> 33:51.220]  But I do want to swing for the fences
[33:51.220 --> 33:56.220]  When you pray for us, when you spread the word about the show and you financially buy great products that you already need,
[33:56.220 --> 34:01.220]  360 win, without you we wouldn't be here
[34:01.220 --> 34:07.220]  You know, we've got just some insane things to cover here
[34:07.220 --> 34:12.220]  My problem is, I have too much amazing news
[34:12.220 --> 34:18.220]  Don't stop at the top
[34:18.220 --> 34:29.220]  I want the listeners to understand, the globalists believe that two individuals
[34:29.220 --> 34:33.220]  In their own admissions, in their own white papers, in their own secret reports
[34:33.220 --> 34:38.220]  That two people were the catalyst to boost Trump into office
[34:38.220 --> 34:43.220]  Their names are Matt Drudge and Alex Jones
[34:43.220 --> 34:46.220]  Now that's not bragging to say that
[34:46.220 --> 34:50.220]  The globalists were able to track that and that's true
[34:50.220 --> 34:58.220]  And you notice, my brand of nationalism and anti-globalism is now the brand of the globe
[34:58.220 --> 35:01.220]  And the globalists themselves are backtracking
[35:01.220 --> 35:06.220]  So we've won devastating victories
[35:06.220 --> 35:09.220]  Devastating victories
[35:09.220 --> 35:13.220]  There's a Guardian, how Drudge report ushered in the age of Trump
[35:13.220 --> 35:16.220]  So when I sit there and I talk about that, it's not about going, oh hey
[35:16.220 --> 35:20.220]  I just won the Indianapolis whatever, or oh I just won the football game
[35:20.220 --> 35:24.220]  I'm not somebody spiking a football in the end zone
[35:24.220 --> 35:31.220]  I am under siege, use the Vietnam analogy, we're like a fire base
[35:31.220 --> 35:34.220]  A square, a big triangle base, they're both sizes
[35:34.220 --> 35:37.220]  Out in enemy territory, surrounded with rockets landing and blowing up
[35:37.220 --> 35:41.220]  And we've had major victories, we've devastated enemy offensive
[35:41.220 --> 35:48.220]  But if you don't fly over in C-130s and dump, the support to us, we're done
[35:48.220 --> 35:52.220]  So I'm going to get to a bunch of news here in just a moment
[35:52.220 --> 35:55.220]  But right now, let me just boil it down and codify it
[35:55.220 --> 35:59.220]  We sell products because they took our sponsors away over the years
[35:59.220 --> 36:02.220]  They harassed us, they did all of it, they tried to take our bank accounts away
[36:02.220 --> 36:06.220]  So I said, hey, it's best just to control products and make sure it's the best
[36:06.220 --> 36:09.220]  And to sell it to people and have them have a great response
[36:09.220 --> 36:13.220]  To become customers, not just listeners, and then it's a symbiotic relationship
[36:13.220 --> 36:17.220]  And earlier I talked about, you know, why do you go to a globalist hotel?
[36:17.220 --> 36:20.220]  Why do we go to the NFL? Why do we watch Hollywood movies?
[36:20.220 --> 36:23.220]  More and more you're not doing it, it's why they're down 35-40%
[36:23.220 --> 36:26.220]  They're going bankrupt just because you've pulled back
[36:26.220 --> 36:32.220]  And all these fits we're seeing are their attempt to dominate us back under their control
[36:32.220 --> 36:35.220]  That's what all this is
[36:35.220 --> 36:40.220]  So we produce and go to the top companies and make the best fish oil
[36:40.220 --> 36:44.220]  Or the best neutropic or the best pre-workout total energy like turbo force
[36:44.220 --> 36:48.220]  Which the sale, by the way, ends this week 50% off on brain force
[36:48.220 --> 36:52.220]  33% off on turbo force when you get them together
[36:52.220 --> 36:55.220]  But it's so fundamental that literally
[36:55.220 --> 37:00.220]  If just a fraction more of this audience, despite all the attacks and the demonization
[37:00.220 --> 37:02.220]  And the boycotts and the harassment and the fake lawsuits
[37:02.220 --> 37:06.220]  If you just commit to say, hey, I'm going to get my coffee from m4store.com
[37:06.220 --> 37:09.220]  And sign up for auto-ship, you know, additional 10% off
[37:09.220 --> 37:14.220]  Or I'm going to sign up every month to get the Coil Silver I-9 Fortified
[37:14.220 --> 37:18.220]  Fluoride Free Toothpaste Super Blue
[37:18.220 --> 37:24.220]  If you just do that, it literally buys war bonds against these people and we can defeat them
[37:24.220 --> 37:26.220]  Now, I'm so excited about this
[37:26.220 --> 37:30.220]  Because they taste so good, they're so great, they're such high quality
[37:30.220 --> 37:40.220]  And I can't wait to hear them try to demonize that we're selling high quality infused protein bars
[37:40.220 --> 37:46.220]  We went to, again, three of the top manufacturers in the country
[37:46.220 --> 37:51.220]  We said we want to up the protein level, up the quality, even though you're already topped the line
[37:51.220 --> 37:53.220]  And we're going to lower the price
[37:53.220 --> 37:57.220]  Because the average protein bar is cost in these places a dollar to produce or less
[37:57.220 --> 38:00.220]  And they're selling the high end ones for six, seven dollars at Whole Foods
[38:00.220 --> 38:08.220]  So this is a high end protein bar, M4's live protein bar, two different flavors
[38:08.220 --> 38:12.220]  At regular price in the packs of 12, it's three dollars
[38:12.220 --> 38:15.220]  15 grams of protein and so much more
[38:15.220 --> 38:21.220]  These are super high quality, no fillers, nothing
[38:21.220 --> 38:26.220]  But under the discount we've got going, it's 40% off when you get two boxes
[38:26.220 --> 38:30.220]  Instead of 25% off, it's like two dollars and 40 cents
[38:30.220 --> 38:34.220]  I want you to, everybody's like a run around the office since these came in about two weeks ago
[38:34.220 --> 38:37.220]  We're launching them today and they're like, this is the best protein bar I've ever taken
[38:37.220 --> 38:42.220]  Why is it so good? And I said, because I already go to the top people and I say let's go up even more
[38:42.220 --> 38:45.220]  I don't need five or seven times markup
[38:45.220 --> 38:50.220]  At regular sales price, there's a 200% markup, we discount it, it's like 100% markup
[38:50.220 --> 38:54.220]  I guess 40%, it's like 120% markup, whatever it comes out to
[38:54.220 --> 39:00.220]  I personally like vanilla coconut, I love coconut, there was all these flavored options we had
[39:00.220 --> 39:04.220]  I love vanilla and coconut together, one of my favorite pies and my favorite cakes
[39:04.220 --> 39:08.220]  It's so good, it'll blow you away, meal replacement, you name it, on the go
[39:08.220 --> 39:12.220]  This is next level, and then a lot of people like chocolate, I like chocolate
[39:12.220 --> 39:16.220]  I like it with peanut butter so much, I mean it's okay, I like Reese's Pieces but it's not my favorite
[39:16.220 --> 39:20.220]  But this is really good, I'm trying to put down the product down, this is my favorite for vanilla coconut
[39:20.220 --> 39:27.220]  Peanut butter chocolate, 12 pack ladies and gentlemen, it comes down the discount to $2.40 a bar
[39:27.220 --> 39:32.220]  Competing bars are five, six, seven dollars a piece of this quality
[39:32.220 --> 39:37.220]  No fillers, no nothing, it's what I give to my family, we have a lot of protein bars at the house
[39:37.220 --> 39:42.220]  High end ones, they're all gone now, my kids love these in the last two weeks since they were there
[39:42.220 --> 39:45.220]  They absolutely can't believe how good they are
[39:45.220 --> 39:50.220]  So in FullWarsLife.com, in FullWarsShore.com, and shoppin' with the good guys

[40:08.220 --> 40:14.220]  He sells coffee and toothpaste, brushing your teeth is bad and he sells pure clean protein bars
[40:14.220 --> 40:17.220]  They taste incredibly good, they taste like candy bars

[40:31.220 --> 40:38.220]  This is how you fund the info war, instead of going and paying more for bars that aren't even as good in many cases

[41:18.220 --> 41:22.220]  Before we were de-platformed everywhere, I'd plug once an hour for like a minute
[41:22.220 --> 41:29.220]  And that was because the audience was so huge, and it's still giant, but they have cut us down to the core
[41:29.220 --> 41:33.220]  You know, 300 or whatever, you know, in those hardcore the most focused
[41:33.220 --> 41:36.220]  And in ways, there's huge viral videos that happen and things
[41:36.220 --> 41:40.220]  I mean, the legend of infowars is better than ever, but that isn't what matters
[41:40.220 --> 41:43.220]  I want to reach people at point blank range to wake them up
[41:43.220 --> 41:48.220]  The globalists are scared of me talking to somebody, because they know people instinctively go
[41:48.220 --> 41:52.220]  This guy's telling the truth, this guy's for real, this guy is in it to win it
[41:52.220 --> 41:54.220]  I'm on your side, I am
[41:54.220 --> 41:57.220]  And you know, I'm not bragging about it, they tried to hire me at Fox
[41:57.220 --> 42:00.220]  They tried to hire me at Clear Channel and much other places
[42:00.220 --> 42:04.220]  They sent in top TV executives three different times, you know, Roger Ellsbury died
[42:04.220 --> 42:06.220]  Wanted to launch something new, but he was too sick to do it
[42:06.220 --> 42:11.220]  And then you said, listen, you got the highest Q's scores we've ever seen
[42:11.220 --> 42:15.220]  Better than Bill Hammer or whatever, that guy supposedly has them off the charts
[42:15.220 --> 42:19.220]  And they just said, we're ready, we want to do it, but we need to do what we say
[42:19.220 --> 42:23.220]  I never did it, and I'm not saying I'm that great, I don't know why I have those IQ scores
[42:23.220 --> 42:28.220]  But I legitimately, well I do, I legitimately believe in you, I believe in me
[42:28.220 --> 42:31.220]  I believe we're in this together and I want to win

[46:07.220 --> 46:11.220]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper
[46:11.220 --> 46:13.220]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for
[46:13.220 --> 46:18.220]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions
[46:18.220 --> 46:22.220]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals
[46:22.220 --> 46:25.220]  Taking those God-given rights from us as individuals
[46:25.220 --> 46:31.220]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now
[46:31.220 --> 46:33.220]  We have seen what they want to do
[46:33.220 --> 46:35.220]  They called it UN Agenda 21
[46:35.220 --> 46:37.220]  Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda
[46:37.220 --> 46:40.220]  They want everybody off of the rural lands
[46:40.220 --> 46:42.220]  They want people out of the suburbs
[46:42.220 --> 46:44.220]  They want to pack everybody into the cities
[46:44.220 --> 46:48.220]  Because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone

[47:51.220 --> 47:55.220]  I like smoking life, man
[47:55.220 --> 47:58.220]  You know, I like Roger as a friend
[47:58.220 --> 48:02.220]  But he doles out exclusives to like, you have some to Fox News
[48:02.220 --> 48:04.220]  Some to Daily Caller
[48:04.220 --> 48:06.220]  And he works here
[48:06.220 --> 48:08.220]  I pay his salary
[48:08.220 --> 48:12.220]  And I've been checking both my phones here
[48:12.220 --> 48:19.220]  Jack the Sobit called us for comment on this like 10 minutes ago
[48:19.220 --> 48:23.220]  Roger Stone is going to go to the woodshed here pretty soon
[48:23.220 --> 48:29.220]  Roger Stone has filed lawsuit against Robert Mueller
[48:29.220 --> 48:33.220]  Which he should, CNN, clearly is there being coordinated by the FBI
[48:33.220 --> 48:35.220]  He has the screenshots where the CNN screwed up and said
[48:35.220 --> 48:37.220]  Comment on your indictment
[48:37.220 --> 48:39.220]  Which the idiot reporters
[48:39.220 --> 48:42.220]  One thing about these traders is they are stupid
[48:42.220 --> 48:44.220]  They sent him the day before
[48:44.220 --> 48:46.220]  He didn't really know what to do with it, he saw it the next day
[48:46.220 --> 48:52.220]  You've been indicted, what do you make of this for the grand jury even building?
[48:52.220 --> 48:54.220]  So that's incredible
[48:54.220 --> 48:58.220]  So this is not being picked up yet
[48:58.220 --> 49:02.220]  So this is a global exclusive in the United States District Court
[49:02.220 --> 49:04.220]  For the District of Columbia
[49:04.220 --> 49:08.220]  Filed a day, Roger Stone's motion
[49:08.220 --> 49:13.220]  Requesting a show cause order
[49:13.220 --> 49:15.220]  So it's on Gateway upon it
[49:15.220 --> 49:18.220]  Well that's good, Gateway upon it can hire Roger
[49:18.220 --> 49:20.220]  I think re-apprentice is a great job
[49:20.220 --> 49:23.220]  In fact, Roger Stone now works for the Gateway upon it, which is good
[49:23.220 --> 49:25.220]  I like the work they do, they're very prolific
[49:25.220 --> 49:27.220]  They're bulldogs, I really like them
[49:27.220 --> 49:31.220]  So there you go here at the M4s Command Center
[49:31.220 --> 49:34.220]  Roger Stone has been charged with Congress
[49:34.220 --> 49:36.220]  It goes on from there about how they staged the whole deal
[49:36.220 --> 49:38.220]  Which is a great point
[49:38.220 --> 49:41.220]  And show the cause of how you trampled his rights to do this
[49:41.220 --> 49:45.220]  So there you go and there is the document right there
[49:45.220 --> 49:47.220]  You know, people call us to find out what Roger's up to
[49:47.220 --> 49:50.220]  And I just, I can't tell you, I don't know
[49:50.220 --> 49:54.220]  So Roger Stone now works for the Gateway upon it ladies and gentlemen
[49:54.220 --> 49:57.220]  Seriously, has about 10 seconds ago
[49:57.220 --> 50:00.220]  I'm like, Roger, get a job with the Gateway upon it now
[50:00.220 --> 50:04.220]  Cause, here let me check my other phone
[50:04.220 --> 50:06.220]  I don't want to go off half-cocked here
[50:06.220 --> 50:10.220]  Maybe he called this other phone and gave them, gave me the exclusive
[50:10.220 --> 50:12.220]  Nope, doesn't look like it
[50:12.220 --> 50:14.220]  Hey guys, this plug isn't working in here
[50:14.220 --> 50:16.220]  You guys get this phone and plug it in for me
[50:16.220 --> 50:19.220]  God, I might want to mess around here, boy, I gotta tell you
[50:19.220 --> 50:22.220]  Alright, let's just move off the Roger Stone news
[50:22.220 --> 50:25.220]  And the whole Russiagate thing coming to its end
[50:25.220 --> 50:27.220]  And the rest of it
[50:27.220 --> 50:29.220]  No indictments of anybody with Russia
[50:29.220 --> 50:32.220]  Senate Intelligence Committee, no Russian connections, of course
[50:32.220 --> 50:35.220]  But they're about, you got this big lawyer for Trump saying
[50:35.220 --> 50:38.220]  Oh, I bet Mueller doesn't even put out a report or make a statement
[50:38.220 --> 50:41.220]  That's cause Congress is gonna keep the Russiagate fake thing going
[50:41.220 --> 50:44.220]  As Schiff has said in the House
[50:44.220 --> 50:47.220]  Judiciary Committee
[50:47.220 --> 50:49.220]  That's what's going on there
[50:52.220 --> 50:55.220]  Because then he just kinda, the fact that there was no Russian
[50:55.220 --> 50:58.220]  He just kinda, oh, it's the vehicle
[50:58.220 --> 51:01.220]  Russiagate's the vehicle to illegally spy
[51:01.220 --> 51:03.220]  And the vehicle discredits the election
[51:03.220 --> 51:06.220]  And it's the vehicle, it's the delivery system
[51:06.220 --> 51:09.220]  To get the dragnet of dirt on Trump associates
[51:09.220 --> 51:12.220]  For income taxes, you name it, to now get to that point
[51:14.220 --> 51:17.220]  And so, that's where all this is going
[51:20.220 --> 51:22.220]  Now let me do this
[51:22.220 --> 51:26.220]  I said I'd get to it this segment, but I just got derailed by that
[51:28.220 --> 51:30.220]  I know what's going on with Howard Schultz
[51:30.220 --> 51:33.220]  And it's as plain as the nose on an Easter Bunny's face
[51:33.220 --> 51:36.220]  So we're gonna be looking at that
[51:36.220 --> 51:39.220]  Bloomberg's $500 million anti-Trump moonshot
[51:40.220 --> 51:43.220]  We're gonna tie that in where nobody deserves to be this rich
[51:43.220 --> 51:45.220]  Bill Gates, what's that really mean?
[51:46.220 --> 51:48.220]  That's all coming up
[51:49.220 --> 51:52.220]  So we'll be breaking it down
[51:52.220 --> 51:55.220]  Oh, more Californians consider fleeing the state
[51:55.220 --> 51:57.220]  That's all the start
[51:59.220 --> 52:01.220]  Of the next hour
[52:01.220 --> 52:04.220]  And we're gonna get to all of it here today, ladies and gentlemen
[52:06.220 --> 52:09.220]  And we're also going to get into
[52:12.220 --> 52:15.220]  This whole stack of news about George Soros admitting
[52:15.220 --> 52:18.220]  That the EU is on the verge of collapsing and panicking
[52:18.220 --> 52:20.220]  That their whole world government's in trouble
[52:20.220 --> 52:22.220]  So just remember that, we've just got to hold the line
[52:22.220 --> 52:24.220]  As patriots, a few more years
[52:24.220 --> 52:28.220]  The left's uncloaking and saying we want to kill babies after they're born
[52:28.220 --> 52:30.220]  We love devil worship
[52:30.220 --> 52:32.220]  We hate America, we've got articles here
[52:32.220 --> 52:35.220]  We want to ban the American flag
[52:35.220 --> 52:37.220]  And we want to change George Washington University
[52:37.220 --> 52:39.220]  Because he's a bad person
[52:39.220 --> 52:41.220]  And we want everything free
[52:41.220 --> 52:43.220]  And you don't have to work if you don't want to
[52:43.220 --> 52:45.220]  That's their death throes
[52:45.220 --> 52:48.220]  That's their political floundering
[52:49.220 --> 52:51.220]  That's going on
[52:51.220 --> 52:53.220]  That's all that's happening
[52:53.220 --> 52:55.220]  Period
[52:55.220 --> 52:57.220]  And so
[52:57.220 --> 52:59.220]  We have to understand that
[52:59.220 --> 53:01.220]  Don't give into their death throes
[53:01.220 --> 53:03.220]  Don't give into their temper tantrum
[53:03.220 --> 53:05.220]  Spread the word word of mouth
[53:05.220 --> 53:07.220]  Spread the word via text message, via email
[53:07.220 --> 53:09.220]  Call and talk radio, call and c-span
[53:09.220 --> 53:12.220]  Do satirical things on Facebook and Twitter
[53:12.220 --> 53:15.220]  Because the left is so brain damaged and so mentally ill
[53:15.220 --> 53:18.220]  Mark dies, which will play that segment
[53:18.220 --> 53:21.220]  He put out a satirical video
[53:21.220 --> 53:24.220]  Which was clear, saying oh my gosh
[53:24.220 --> 53:26.220]  Her thing is so kooky, saying ban airplanes
[53:26.220 --> 53:29.220]  And ban cows farting and kill all cows
[53:29.220 --> 53:32.220]  And Cory Booker right now saying ban all meat
[53:32.220 --> 53:35.220]  Since it's so crazy, let's say
[53:35.220 --> 53:37.220]  Everyone must collect their urine
[53:37.220 --> 53:39.220]  To make coffee at the office
[53:39.220 --> 53:41.220]  And a free massage chair
[53:41.220 --> 53:43.220]  Why not, saying everything's free, we don't have to work
[53:43.220 --> 53:45.220]  He said it with satire and a joke
[53:45.220 --> 53:47.220]  Let's see if they endorse this
[53:47.220 --> 53:50.220]  They all went oh, Cortez didn't put this on her website
[53:50.220 --> 53:52.220]  And then used this as an example
[53:52.220 --> 53:55.220]  Not what she actually put that was just as ridiculous
[53:55.220 --> 53:57.220]  But a lot of leftists saw it
[53:57.220 --> 53:59.220]  And actually endorsed it thinking yeah
[53:59.220 --> 54:01.220]  I want a massage chair
[54:01.220 --> 54:03.220]  It's like they're autistic or something
[54:03.220 --> 54:06.220]  I don't mean that meanly, it's like they don't get humor
[54:06.220 --> 54:09.220]  They don't understand humor, they don't get it
[54:09.220 --> 54:12.220]  Like I'm gonna play a clip coming up next hour
[54:12.220 --> 54:14.220]  Of Joe Rogan
[54:14.220 --> 54:17.220]  That according to the leftist yardstick
[54:17.220 --> 54:19.220]  He should be banned from everything on the planet
[54:19.220 --> 54:21.220]  And even though I'm mad at Joe
[54:21.220 --> 54:23.220]  And even though he's gone on with the establishment against me
[54:23.220 --> 54:25.220]  And I play this clip that is
[54:25.220 --> 54:27.220]  Shocking
[54:27.220 --> 54:29.220]  In the current lens, it's humor
[54:29.220 --> 54:32.220]  You know, it's humor I wouldn't engage in
[54:35.220 --> 54:38.220]  But it's covered in the first amendment
[54:38.220 --> 54:40.220]  I'm not endorsing what he said
[54:40.220 --> 54:42.220]  But I don't think he should be de-platformed for it
[54:42.220 --> 54:44.220]  But he's like oh, de-platform Alex
[54:44.220 --> 54:47.220]  You know, a few months ago, a few weeks ago
[54:47.220 --> 54:49.220]  You know, because he did this horrible thing
[54:49.220 --> 54:51.220]  Questioning big, giant media events
[54:51.220 --> 54:53.220]  Now he's backed off that, which is great
[54:53.220 --> 54:55.220]  But then I start thinking wait a minute
[54:55.220 --> 54:57.220]  There's clips of Joe
[54:57.220 --> 54:59.220]  Saying things that I won't even repeat
[54:59.220 --> 55:01.220]  I'm gonna play the clip
[55:01.220 --> 55:02.220]  Because they'll say I said it
[55:02.220 --> 55:04.220]  That's how deceptive the media is
[55:04.220 --> 55:06.220]  But oh, I bet
[55:06.220 --> 55:08.220]  Because if you can go back six years
[55:08.220 --> 55:10.220]  Ten years, fifteen years
[55:10.220 --> 55:12.220]  Twenty years, thirty years
[55:12.220 --> 55:14.220]  On what somebody did
[55:14.220 --> 55:16.220]  And interpreted however you want
[55:16.220 --> 55:18.220]  And then de-platformed them
[55:18.220 --> 55:20.220]  Well, then imagine
[55:20.220 --> 55:24.220]  Is that why Joe has been acting so incredibly
[55:24.220 --> 55:26.220]  Compromised down on his knees
[55:26.220 --> 55:30.220]  To Silicon Valley, on his knees to Jack Dorsey
[55:30.220 --> 55:32.220]  On his knees doing all this
[55:32.220 --> 55:35.220]  So that's coming up next hour as well
[55:37.220 --> 55:39.220]  And we're gonna get into Ted Cruz's plan
[55:39.220 --> 55:41.220]  It's constitutional for acid formative seizure
[55:41.220 --> 55:43.220]  On the border that would totally pay for the wall
[55:43.220 --> 55:45.220]  Beyond that, pay for drug rehab
[55:45.220 --> 55:50.220]  And, you know, disease mitigation and testing
[55:50.220 --> 55:52.220]  I mean, hell, that's what Ellis Island did
[55:52.220 --> 55:53.220]  Was test for diseases
[55:53.220 --> 55:56.220]  Great idea of Senator Ted Cruz
[55:56.220 --> 55:58.220]  Probably the smartest guy in the Senate
[55:58.220 --> 56:00.220]  I think one of the smartest guys, you know
[56:00.220 --> 56:02.220]  I mean, Rand Paul him, it's kind of hard to guess
[56:02.220 --> 56:03.220]  Which one is smartest
[56:03.220 --> 56:05.220]  But they're both real treasures
[56:05.220 --> 56:08.220]  And so we'll be looking at all that coming up
[56:08.220 --> 56:09.220]  And in this great headline
[56:09.220 --> 56:12.220]  U.S. Hungary determined to protect Christianity
[56:12.220 --> 56:14.220]  Worldwide
[56:14.220 --> 56:16.220]  Because Christianity is under attack
[56:16.220 --> 56:18.220]  Number of Christians being killed over years
[56:18.220 --> 56:19.220]  Double the U.N. admits
[56:19.220 --> 56:21.220]  And Soros and others are pushing that whole plan
[56:21.220 --> 56:22.220]  So it's all coming up
[56:22.220 --> 56:24.220]  And open phones next hour
[56:24.220 --> 56:28.220]  And then, Leo Zagami from Rome
[56:28.220 --> 56:31.220]  On the huge scandals at the Vatican
[56:31.220 --> 56:33.220]  That threaten to bring down the whole New World Order
[56:33.220 --> 56:34.220]  Because here's the thing
[56:34.220 --> 56:36.220]  They use the infiltration of the Vatican
[56:36.220 --> 56:38.220]  With pedophile rings to get control of it
[56:38.220 --> 56:39.220]  That's been admitted, even the Guardian
[56:39.220 --> 56:40.220]  Well, the Guardian
[56:40.220 --> 56:42.220]  But the same networks keep breaking
[56:42.220 --> 56:44.220]  The Guardian, but the same networks
[56:44.220 --> 56:46.220]  Keep blackmailing, keep controlling
[56:46.220 --> 56:47.220]  And blackmailing each other
[56:47.220 --> 56:49.220]  There's no honor amongst thieves
[56:49.220 --> 56:51.220]  So I'm not anti-Catholic
[56:51.220 --> 56:53.220]  I'm not anti-Vatican
[56:53.220 --> 56:54.220]  You know, we probably wouldn't have civilization
[56:54.220 --> 56:55.220]  In the west today
[56:55.220 --> 56:56.220]  The Vatican had to come along
[56:56.220 --> 56:57.220]  Certainly had its own problems
[56:57.220 --> 56:59.220]  And the Orthodox Church got its problems
[56:59.220 --> 57:01.220]  But I think it's a good group of people over
[57:01.220 --> 57:03.220]  In Eastern Europe, other areas
[57:03.220 --> 57:04.220]  In Greece
[57:04.220 --> 57:05.220]  But regardless
[57:05.220 --> 57:07.220]  What the Vatican is today
[57:07.220 --> 57:10.220]  Is 180 degrees
[57:10.220 --> 57:12.220]  That's what the Vatican was 100 years ago
[57:12.220 --> 57:14.220]  I mean, it's anti-Christian, anti-western
[57:14.220 --> 57:15.220]  Anti-child
[57:15.220 --> 57:18.220]  And that's because the devil took it over
[57:18.220 --> 57:20.220]  So let's just stop the debate
[57:20.220 --> 57:22.220]  Whether it was ever good or ever bad
[57:22.220 --> 57:24.220]  It's bad now
[57:24.220 --> 57:26.220]  And who's the group the media defends
[57:26.220 --> 57:27.220]  The corrupt Vatican?
[57:27.220 --> 57:28.220]  What do they attack?
[57:28.220 --> 57:32.220]  Independent, real, Orthodox Catholic schools
[57:32.220 --> 57:34.220]  That have good wholesome people
[57:34.220 --> 57:35.220]  Like the Covington kids
[57:35.220 --> 57:37.220]  That's who they hate more than anybody
[57:37.220 --> 57:39.220]  So they haven't completed their takeover
[57:39.220 --> 57:40.220]  Of Christianity yet
[57:40.220 --> 57:41.220]  But they're trying
[57:41.220 --> 57:42.220]  Stay with us
[57:42.220 --> 57:44.220]  Hour two straight ahead
[57:44.220 --> 57:47.220]  I'm Alex Jones, the dreaded info warrior
[57:58.220 --> 58:00.220]  By leaps and by bounds
[58:00.220 --> 58:03.220]  The number one best-selling supplement family
[58:03.220 --> 58:04.220]  In the world
[58:04.220 --> 58:07.220]  Is energy drinks and energy supplements
[58:07.220 --> 58:09.220]  But they are riddled with dyes
[58:09.220 --> 58:11.220]  And toxins and synthetic caffeine
[58:11.220 --> 58:12.220]  And other chemicals
[58:12.220 --> 58:14.220]  That sure get you a quick boost
[58:14.220 --> 58:16.220]  But burn out in just a few hours
[58:16.220 --> 58:17.220]  And have terrible side effects
[58:17.220 --> 58:19.220]  We have developed hands down
[58:19.220 --> 58:20.220]  From our research
[58:20.220 --> 58:23.220]  The most powerful, healthy energy drink
[58:23.220 --> 58:26.220]  Pre-workout and beyond system in the world
[58:26.220 --> 58:28.220]  There's nothing else like it
[58:28.220 --> 58:29.220]  You must experience it
[58:29.220 --> 58:31.220]  It is a total game changer
[58:31.220 --> 58:32.220]  And it comes in easy to use
[58:32.220 --> 58:34.220]  Packets to mix in fruit juice
[58:34.220 --> 58:36.220]  Or water, whatever you'd like
[58:36.220 --> 58:37.220]  Warning, though
[58:37.220 --> 58:38.220]  It's very, very strong
[58:38.220 --> 58:39.220]  It lasts up to 10 hours
[58:39.220 --> 58:41.220]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it
[58:41.220 --> 58:43.220]  Because Turboforce is named Turboforce
[58:43.220 --> 58:46.220]  Because it will take you into overdrive
[58:46.220 --> 58:47.220]  Turboforce
[58:47.220 --> 58:48.220]  At M4sLive.com
[58:50.220 --> 58:52.220]  At M4s, we're always looking

[58:55.220 --> 58:56.220]  Highest-rated products
[58:56.220 --> 58:58.220]  That we can then private label and sell
[58:58.220 --> 59:00.220]  Well, there is a national company
[59:00.220 --> 59:01.220]  Who has FDA approval
[59:01.220 --> 59:02.220]  To sell their wound gel
[59:02.220 --> 59:04.220]  That is the strongest out there
[59:04.220 --> 59:05.220]  And we private label it
[59:05.220 --> 59:08.220]  And we sell it for $10 less online
[59:08.220 --> 59:11.220]  Than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens
[59:11.220 --> 59:12.220]  We also have another product
[59:12.220 --> 59:14.220]  Also produced by the same company
[59:14.220 --> 59:16.220]  Immune Gargle
[59:16.220 --> 59:18.220]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel
[59:18.220 --> 59:20.220]  And a lot of the immune gargle
[59:20.220 --> 59:22.220]  We're gonna go from full price

[59:41.220 --> 59:43.220]  Immune Boost Special
[59:43.220 --> 59:44.220]  It's super blue

[59:48.220 --> 59:50.220]  At M4sLive.com
[59:53.220 --> 59:56.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.220]  When Alexandria Crazy Eyes Cortez
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.220]  Released her new green deal
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.220]  Some of the proposals are so insane
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.220]  That many thought that they had to be a joke
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:09.220]  But the part about stopping cows from farting
[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:12.220]  And giving money to those who were unwilling to work
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.220]  Were actually in the plan
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:16.220]  So I decided to create some satirical screenshots
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:19.220]  Adding that we would all get a free massage chair
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:22.220]  That the farmers needed an adequate supply of
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:23.220]  Brondo
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.220]  Because it's got what plants crave
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:27.220]  And that we would have to make our coffee
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:29.220]  From recycled urine
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.220]  When I first posted them online
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:32.220]  I said, spread it around guys
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.220]  Let's see if AOC will fact check this
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.220]  Adding the hashtag Green New Deal
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:39.220]  With a winking emoji
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:41.220]  But certainly she wouldn't be so foolish
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.220]  To fact check what should be an obvious joke
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.220]  Right?
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.220]  Oh wait, what's this?
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.220]  She literally quote tweeted someone
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.220]  Who posted the screenshots
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:51.220]  Adding, when your Green New Deal legislation
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:52.220]  Is so strong
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.220]  That the GOP has to resort
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.220]  To circulating false versions
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.220]  It's not a fake version
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:01.220]  It's called satire which, according to the dictionary
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.220]  Which you've obviously never cracked open
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:06.220]  Says is the use of irony, sarcasm, and ridicule
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:10.220]  In exposing, denouncing, or deriding someone
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.220]  And this one all I did is take the actual text
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.220]  From her website
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:17.220]  Offering people great jobs, vacations, free food
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.220]  And literally free money
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.220]  For those who are unwilling to work
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:23.220]  And I just added that we don't get a free massage chair
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.220]  Oh it gets even better
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:26.220]  Then her advisor went on Tucker Carlson
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:28.220]  And was asked about some of the crazy stuff
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.220]  That's in the plan
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:32.220]  And he said that those are just some of the proposals
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.220]  From the fake screenshots going around
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.220]  Professor, thanks very much for coming on
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:38.220]  So this is the obvious question
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.220]  Why would we ever pay people who are quote
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:42.220]  Unwilling to work?
[01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:44.220]  We never would, right?
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:46.220]  And AOC has never said anything like that
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.220]  I think you're referring to some sort of document
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:50.220]  That some, I think some doctor's document
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.220]  That somebody other than us has been circulating
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:54.220]  I thought that came right from her
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.220]  That was in the background or from her office
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:57.220]  Is my understanding
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.220]  No, no, she's actually tweeted it out
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:00.220]  To laugh at it
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.220]  If you look at her latest tweets
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:03.220]  It seems that apparently some Republicans
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.220]  Have put it out there
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.220]  I don't know the details
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:06.220]  Oh good, well then and then
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:07.220]  Thank you for correcting me
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.220]  I mean because it looks like
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.220]  It seemed a little more ridiculous
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:12.220]  Now this guy lied to Tucker Carlson
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.220]  And later admitted that he lied
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.220]  And Tucker took him for his word
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.220]  Because those parts of the proposal
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.220]  Do seem like parodies
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:21.220]  But those parts are actually real
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:23.220]  This caused a lot of confusion
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.220]  Leading the Washington Post to ask
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:28.220]  What's actually in the Green New Deal
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:29.220]  From Democrats
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:30.220]  What happened here was
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:32.220]  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.220]  Deleted the original version
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.220]  That she posted on her website
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.220]  About the cow farts
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.220]  And giving people money
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.220]  Who were unwilling to work
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:42.220]  Because so many people were ridiculing her
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.220]  And then she said that those parts
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.220]  Were just from the fake screenshots
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.220]  Thankfully the internet way back machine
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:50.220]  Has the archive of the original version
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.220]  Which shows that they are lying
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:54.220]  The Washington Post even said
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:57.220]  That it was misleading for Ocasio-Cortez
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.220]  To mention the quote
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:01.220]  Doctored materials as she responds
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:02.220]  To these attacks
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:05.220]  Most of the criticism she is responding to
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:08.220]  Was based on documents from her office
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:12.220]  Not fake plans for recycling urine
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:14.220]  Even Snopes fact-checked my memes
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:16.220]  Asking does the Green New Deal
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:20.220]  Proposal include a recycling urine provision?
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.220]  Claim the Green New Deal
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:24.220]  Legislation of 2019
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.220]  Includes a provision requiring men
[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:29.220]  To recycle their urine to use for coffee
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.220]  We have discovered that this is false
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.220]  A screenshot supposedly showing a section
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.220]  Of the proposed Green New Deal
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.220]  Legislation introduced by Alexandria
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:40.220]  Ocasio-Cortez began to circulate
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:41.220]  On social media
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:43.220]  The odd provision seemingly
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.220]  Requiring men to recycle their urine
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.220]  To be used in preparing coffee or juice
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.220]  Was not a genuine section of the Green New Deal
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.220]  The image was created by
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:56.220]  YouTube conspiracy theorist Mark Dice
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:00.220]  Who posted it on both his Twitter and Facebook accounts
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:04.220]  And urged his reader to spread the fake document
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:06.220]  It said it was obvious that it was a joke
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:07.220]  I said it was a joke
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:09.220]  And I even joked how funny it would be
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.220]  If Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.220]  Fact-checked the joke which she did
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:16.220]  Making this joke a grand slam
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.220]  If you guys saw the supposed screenshots
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.220]  On my social media and thought that they were real
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:22.220]  I apologize and I won't hold it against you
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:25.220]  Because the Green New Deal was that crazy
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:28.220]  By the way, Snopes calls me a YouTube conspiracy theorist
[01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:31.220]  Because they literally got their information from me
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:34.220]  From Wikipedia, the place where even fifth graders
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:36.220]  Know not to use as a source
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:38.220]  I still can't believe that she actually took the bait
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:40.220]  And in the words of the great Hannibal Smith
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:42.220]  I love it when a plan comes together
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:44.220]  But we are up against the mass psychosis
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:46.220]  That's either caused by liberalism
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:05:15.220]  Or liberalism is the effect of that psychosis
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:18.220]  And that's it for today's video
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.220]  Thanks for watching
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:20.220]  I hope you enjoyed it
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:46.220]  I hope you enjoyed it
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:50.220]  Get pure energy on tech and take advantage of old and new
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:52.220]  Info Wars powerhouse formulas
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:54.220]  With the brain synergy combo
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:58.220]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:18.220]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:28.220]  Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:31.220]  All right, I don't want to attack
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:36.220]  One of the biggest podcasters in UFC color commentators
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:40.220]  And I got to send movies, TV shows, fear factor, name it
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:42.220]  Joe Rogan
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:46.220]  But when Joe decided to join Soros
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:50.220]  And then build these glass houses where I'm a bad guy
[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:51.220]  He's a good guy
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:54.220]  Well, I started doing homework
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:57.220]  And looking into Joe
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.220]  So at the bottom of the hour
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:00.220]  This has gotten no attention
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:03.220]  But if you think wearing blackface is bad
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:07.220]  If you think dressing up in a KKK outfit is bad
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:09.220]  Which I think it's the context it's in
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:10.220]  I mean, I'm not defending it
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:14.220]  I've never done that
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:16.220]  If you think that
[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:22.220]  Then what Joe did is like capital murder
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:25.220]  So the video is coming up at the bottom of the hour
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:30.220]  Just to show how if you're a leftist
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:33.220]  You can do whatever you want and say whatever you want
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:35.220]  But if you're not
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.220]  You're held another standard
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:40.220]  So I'm not calling for Joe to lose his sponsors
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.220]  Or be removed from the air
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:46.220]  I'm simply showing Joe what it's like
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:51.220]  When somebody starts coming after you
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.220]  Because, you know, if Joe wants to sit there
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:55.220]  While he thinks they're shoving me under the water
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:08:01.220]  He's up there on the bank kind of peeing down on me
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:05.220]  Well, I'm going to reach up and drag him down with me
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:08.220]  Because that's fair, right?
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:11.220]  Because if I said the stuff
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.220]  If we're going to play a Joe Rogan saying
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:16.220]  I would be off the air
[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:18.220]  But see, he's this anointed person
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.220]  He's friends with Jack Dorsey
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:21.220]  So he's allowed to
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:25.220]  Well, we'll see about that
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:29.220]  We'll see about that coming up
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:31.220]  And again, I don't do this to be mean
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:34.220]  I just can't lay down
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:39.220]  And, you know, I said that's the bottom of the hour
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.220]  I have this tendency where I say
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.220]  I'm about to cover something
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.220]  And then I go right into it immediately
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:48.220]  And that just shows others
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:50.220]  A lot of planning goes in the broadcast
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:52.220]  And I always throw my own planning to the wayside
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:54.220]  As soon as they get on air
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:57.220]  Let's drill down into the situation
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:00.220]  And by the way, we're watching in there diligently
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.220]  Like laser beams
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.220]  Is Trump going to approve
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.220]  But I think it's a bad border deal overall
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.220]  Yeah, it's a compromise
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:08.220]  Pelosi said zero
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.220]  It's only a seven-month deal
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.220]  It starts the wall, blah, blah, blah
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:13.220]  Yeah, but then it's got too much docket in it
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:14.220]  We're watching that
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:15.220]  Because first they said Trump would approve it
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:17.220]  Then he said they wouldn't
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:18.220]  Then he said he might
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.220]  We're watching that
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.220]  Like laser beams
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:25.220]  And we're going to let you know about that
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:32.220]  Coming up in the next segment
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:34.220]  But right now
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:42.220]  Let's go ahead
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:46.220]  And get to this news
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:49.220]  Howard Schultz rips the Green New Deal
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.220]  We have a video clip we're going to play in a moment
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.220]  It's not realistic
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.220]  So look at the demographics
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:55.220]  Look at the numbers
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:10:00.220]  Now some say Ross Perot was working for Clinton
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:02.220]  And then he got his first six billion from EDS
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:04.220]  And told both what they wanted to hear
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:08.220]  But it was all just fake populism
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.220]  Trump's delivered on real populism so far
[01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:11.220]  At least partially
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:13.220]  So I don't think Trump's a shill
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.220]  But he's starting to slide over
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:17.220]  With some of the things he's doing
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:19.220]  Into a trajectory that's not good
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.220]  Banning bump stocks
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.220]  And that's a bunch of hype
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.220]  You know, saying okay, we'll do DACA
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.220]  Things like that
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:27.220]  But Howard Schultz is a big leftist
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:28.220]  A big liberal
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:30.220]  Hell, Starbucks today is the one
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:31.220]  That when whites come to buy coffee
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:33.220]  They go, let's talk about how you're evil
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.220]  Because you're white
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:38.220]  I mean, this is reeducation camp stuff
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:41.220]  And so Howard Schultz
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:44.220]  And the demographics knows that there is a
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:46.220]  Really bad leftist vein
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:49.220]  That's the real goal of the Democrats
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:50.220]  To live in luxury
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:52.220]  But to say they're socialist and communist
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.220]  And promise free healthcare
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:54.220]  Free education
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:55.220]  Don't have to work
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.220]  I mean, wow, that's a
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:58.220]  That'd be a great civilization
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.220]  Free healthcare
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:00.220]  Free education
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:01.220]  That'll work if you don't want to
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.220]  But those are quotes
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:03.220]  Oh, and we get rid of all the cows
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:04.220]  And Cory Booker's joined
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:05.220]  And said
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:06.220]  Meat eaters, your days are numbered
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.220]  Oh, and cheese too
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.220]  We're gonna tell you what to eat
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:12.220]  What a great group of people
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.220]  It's all Bloomberg crap
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.220]  The great technocrat
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:19.220]  So Howard Schultz
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.220]  Is doing all of this
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:24.220]  To have the Democrats
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:25.220]  Attack him
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.220]  And they're all playing along
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:36.720]  You siphon away nationalist and conservative and Reagan Democrat votes that are socially
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.880]  liberal but physically conservative, it's all meant to do that.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:48.840]  It's all meant, Howard Schultz 100% is meant to siphon away votes in the Rust Belt and other
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.640]  areas from Reagan Democrats away from Trump.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:53.640]  It's that simple.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:58.300]  These whole modus operandi have the Democrats attacking out of the gates, how they're so
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:05.420]  upset at him, how dare him, it's as phony as a $3 bill.
[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:10.700]  And then he comes out to Cortez promising, you know, just everything's free, everything's
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:15.300]  wonderful, just play video games all day, don't worry.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:21.820]  But if a producer doesn't pay their taxes, will swat team you, they know that that's
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.020]  where they're taking it.
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:26.060]  So the Republicans can run against that, so they bring in a Democrat in the middle to
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:30.140]  act like, oh, the Democrats are bad and so the Republicans, I'm the guy, he gets the
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:34.460]  moderate vote that would go with Trump, the nationalist vote that would go with Trump,
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:40.500]  the Reagan Democrat vote that would go with Trump, and then they siphon away a few points,
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:45.140]  all he needs like five points probably, and Donald Trump loses 2020.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:47.100]  That's what old Howard Schultz is doing.
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:51.180]  He thinks he's smarter than everybody, he thinks we don't see through it.
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:55.660]  Now I don't know if Ross Perot was doing that, but he had that net effect.
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:59.780]  But George R. Walker would have been bad anyway, so it didn't matter, it's a moot point.
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:01.900]  But this is a little different, isn't it?
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.420]  So here is Herr Schultz.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:11.740]  When I read the proposed bill in terms of the Green New Deal, and I read that in by 2030,
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:17.820]  they're suggesting that every building in America becomes clean energy, conforms to
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:18.920]  clean energy.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:23.300]  Just to put that in perspective, because it's not realistic, that would mean that between
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:31.020]  two and three thousand buildings a day would have to be reconstructed to conform to what
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:32.020]  they're saying.
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:37.100]  And so let's be sensible about what we're suggesting, let's not just throw stuff against
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:42.180]  the wall because it's a good slogan or we get a press release, let's be truthful.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:50.620]  But when I see politicians start throwing things out that I know is not realistic, that
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:53.020]  is not being honest with the American people.
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:14:00.860]  But I think it's immoral to suggest that we can tally up 20, 30, 40, 50 trillion dollars
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:05.620]  of debt to solve a problem that could be solved in a different way.
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:09.900]  It's not that they're disingenuous, I think they're well-intentioned, this is not personal,
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:14.100]  I just don't agree, this is the right way to approach things.
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:20.380]  Okay, meanwhile, Michael Bloomberg pledges 500 million to unseat Trump in 2020, and then
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:23.620]  this is where you really learn the scam.
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:29.580]  Nobody deserves to be this rich, Bill Gates, who's put over a hundred billion dollars of
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:34.540]  money into a tax-free foundation where he then gets the profits out.
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:40.420]  Just like Bezos and all these groups set it up where they pay basically no taxes, but
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:45.620]  then they lobby and say, I'm so rich, I don't pay taxes, we need to hire taxes on the middle
[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:50.220]  class knowing that through government contracts gets funneled to him and vertically integrates
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.220]  the society.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.940]  So that's how the scam works.
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:58.140]  Bill Gates claimed he had paid too little tax, it did not deserve to be so rich.
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:05.820]  The 63-year-old worth 73 billion pounds, 96 billion dollars, said he and other business
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:08.220]  barons should have to contribute more.
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:09.820]  That's why he puts his money in tax-free foundations.
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:15.460]  In an interview with the mail, he said, I'd pay more than 10 billion in taxes, but I should
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:16.460]  pay more.
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:19.580]  Really, well, then you should have just paid instead of putting a tax-free foundation.
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:25.340]  I, more than follow the law, but I think things should be more progressive on you, making
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:26.620]  a hundred thousand a year.
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:30.180]  The father of three made his fortune after founding Microsoft and it goes on from there.
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:35.260]  I mean, what a load of garbage.
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:44.820]  What absolute tyranny these people are engaged in and how stupid they think we all are.
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:48.180]  All right, we'll come back with even more news.

[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:32.140]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:33.700]  I sued the IRS in one.
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:36.660]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.

[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:19.900]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:24.380]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:26.820]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:33.420]  We have developed hands down from our research the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:36.260]  and beyond system in the world.

[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:04.700]  Wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights.

[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:10.060]  damage.
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:15.140]  We took on Hillary Clinton, we stopped her, we got a nationalist in.
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:17.060]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:22.500]  We are winning but those of us who are at the very front line at the tip of the spear

[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:34.260]  This is about who wants it most and you know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:35.380]  they've taken, everything.
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:39.340]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands, I need financial support and I got products
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:40.900]  you and your family need.

[01:19:56.180 --> 01:20:01.580]  your support is beyond critical, thank you.
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:05.580]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:19.580]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:25.580]  When you wake up in the morning and the light has hurt your head, do you get sensitive
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:30.580]  about the fact that people say you'll never take a serious controversy?
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:35.420]  Well, I have an answer to that, I said now, tell me the last time that Jack Benny, Red
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:42.300]  Skelton, Benny Comedian, used his show to do serious issues.
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.420]  That's not what I'm there for, can't they see that?
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:49.300]  But your neither they think that just because you have a tonight show that you must deal
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:52.940]  in serious issues, that's a danger, it's a real danger.
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:58.100]  Once you start that, you start to get that self-important feeling that's what you say
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:02.220]  has great import and you know, strangely enough, you could use that show as a form, you could
[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:31.220]  sway people and I don't think you should as an entertainer.
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:38.220]  I followed her all night in a funky finally vise and her sweater's kinda tight.
[01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:43.220]  She had a waistcoat struck that was as sweet as molasses.
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:22:00.220]  Now what really knocked me out was her cheap sunglasses.
[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:15.180]  I have too much news to get to and too many clips and too much new stuff breaking at infowars.com
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:20.180]  and newswars.com, just remember, the globalists work around the clock to try to stop people
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:24.860]  visiting those sites when you spread the word about them, you frustrate their entire plan
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.260]  and I salute you.
[01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:33.060]  I want to get into Donald Trump Jr. saying to youth, reject your loser teachers pushing
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:39.060]  socialism and he got attacked all over the news for saying socialism's a loser.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:43.260]  That's like saying, you know, jumping off a 50 foot balcony and breaking both your legs
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:50.600]  is a loser move or injecting heroin is a loser move or I mean, any of this stuff is
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:56.700]  loser moves and they try to ridicule and bully everyone to not have free speech, but first
[01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:01.260]  this, which really concerns me living in Austin, Texas.
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:03.660]  People ask me all the time, why do you live in Austin, Texas?
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:07.300]  Well, my grandmother and my grandfather are from here.
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.220]  I grew up outside Dallas.
[01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:15.700]  My family's been in Texas since Washington on the Brazos 1820s and we were on both sides
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:21.140]  of the family involved the founding of the nation of Texas and you know, had ancestors
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:25.860]  that were the highest levels, the government of Texas fought and died in the wars for Texas
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:32.820]  and then, you know, after that, the horrible civil war, but I'm not evacuating Austin just
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:39.260]  because we now have poop all over the streets like San Francisco or Seattle and needles
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:42.420]  and the things that come with it.
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:46.900]  I believe we can turn this around, but they plan to turn the state blue and I, I sit back
[01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:50.060]  and I get confused like, why do you leave Seattle?
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:52.300]  Why do you leave Portland, Oregon?
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:54.380]  Why do you leave Los Angeles, California?
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:56.820]  Why do you leave San Francisco, California?
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:58.980]  And then why do you come here?
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:02.340]  And I've literally, it's happened to my ex-wife.
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:04.540]  It's happened to my wife.
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:07.940]  It's happened to me where they like, you got four kids and you're in Whole Foods.
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:10.460]  They come over and say they're pissed because they don't have kids.
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:14.460]  They're not happy and they're not good looking like my wife and part of it's just, she's
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:15.460]  good looking.
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:23.380]  She's a sexy lady, but they're angry at this level of wealth, physical genetic wealth.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:32.180]  And so most Californians at Flea, I know them and my kids go to school and then I'll be
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:35.740]  around these parents like, we don't really like you, but we like your daughter.
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:42.740]  I'm like, oh, who's the Alex Jones you don't like, like the one you hear about on the news?
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:53.220]  And it's just the arrogance, the sanctimoniousness, the elitism of these people because, you know,
[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:57.020]  it's a way over-inflated because Democrats get around their income tax with property
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:25:00.380]  tax write-offs that Trump got rid of, like the servicers are mad at that.
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:02.600]  That's the biggest screw you a Democrat's ever.
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:08.340]  Every blue state has property taxes, you know, that people hide all their stuff in the property
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:10.100]  taxes and they write it off.
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:12.180]  That's how the scam works.
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:13.180]  Trump's ending that.
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.340]  One of the good things he's done.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:20.460]  I love sticking it to him, but they can sell some $5 million, three bedroom, four bedroom,
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:23.620]  move here and buy a Ponderosa, a big old ranch.
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:34.300]  The problem is I bought nine acres in a ranch house and a casita, a cottage for a million
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:35.300]  dollars.
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:39.900]  And that's what the note was by the time I got divorced, it was worth like two and a half
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:40.900]  million dollars.
[01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:42.140]  Now it's worth like four million dollars.
[01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:43.140]  I don't have it.
[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:44.140]  My ex-wife does.
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:46.820]  But that's the type in 10 years, what's happened to property.
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:49.860]  I can't buy that now.
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:51.100]  I can't sign the note.
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:55.620]  I mean, Joe's is incredibly rich, 40 million gross sales.
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:57.460]  Yeah, half that's product cost.
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:02.260]  Then all the employees and the bandwidth, I'd be happy to make a bunch of money.
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:08.420]  I'd love to say we've got an extra 20 million, we're expanding and kicking their ass.
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:09.980]  But that's not how it works.
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:14.820]  I'm spending money I made five years ago right now, which is fine because it's all about
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:15.820]  the mission.
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:20.940]  And I believe we're going to come through this, but I've literally had Democrats.
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:28.460]  Repeatedly, at the grocery store and at a hamburger place where you pull through Pete
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:34.820]  Terry's, thought about before F-150, they'll walk right in front of you when you're already
[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:35.820]  rolling.
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:36.820]  And you'll stop.
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:40.900]  And when you stop and say sorry as a Texan, just like they all say F U Alex Jones, they
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:45.580]  go F U and F your big truck.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:48.700]  And so one time I pulled over and got out because I was going to get my hamburger.
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:51.100]  And I went, Hey, that's no need for that.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:52.980]  They go, Let me guess, you're all for California.
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:56.900]  There's a big group up and picking their hamburgers up at the little window there.
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:57.900]  Pete Terry says little window.
[01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:58.900]  You pick them up.
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:26:59.900]  They're like, Of course we are.
[01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:00.900]  You Texas scum.
[01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:03.700]  And I was like five years ago because my son was with me.
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:06.060]  We've gone to Barton Springs to swim.
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:13.220]  And all I'm getting at is just getting worse and worse now where you walk into a restaurant
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:17.420]  or anywhere, you got your good looking wife, you got your good looking kids, man, and these
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:21.620]  people have envy because they all look like they're going to be white, black, Hispanic.
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:23.980]  They look like they've been shot with a mutation rate.
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:25.420]  They look mentally retarded.
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:26.780]  They look crazy.
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:27.780]  They look demonic.
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:28.780]  They're pissed.
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:29.780]  None of them.
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:30.780]  And they're just struck.
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:33.780]  They hardly walk and they just look at somebody.
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:41.980]  I'm not Mr. Mr. When the beauty pageant, but I'm a man and they smell it like I'll have
[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:42.980]  let this go.
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:46.700]  I was like at a Dick's Sporting Goods about a month ago and some guy walks in and goes,
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:47.700]  oh, you walk around.
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:48.700]  That's some liberal thing.
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:52.260]  It's happened three times now, twice in front of my wife.
[01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:55.260]  Once in Fredericksburg, once in a grocery store, happened to me in a Dick's Sporting Goods
[01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:56.260]  by myself.
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:28:00.620]  I mean, they're trying to, you buy some workout clothes because my other ones got holes in
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:01.620]  them.
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:04.220]  And this guy walks over and goes, are you some kind of strong man?
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:10.180]  And I'm like, no, I don't show my, oh, you just walk around like you're really tough.
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:12.860]  And he was like some six foot three dude.
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:13.860]  I'm like five, 11.
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:15.940]  I'm like, he was just getting like bike rider type.
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:16.940]  No, man.
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:17.940]  I don't think I'm tough.
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:18.940]  He goes, oh, really?
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:19.940]  Well, just thought you'd think you're somebody.
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:24.820]  And I was just looking at him, but see, it's the thing, it's the spiritual thing.
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:27.020]  So here's the headlines.
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:34.100]  More Californians CNBC reports are considering fleeing the state as they blame sky high costs
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:35.100]  survey finds.
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:36.100]  Well, don't worry.
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:37.980]  The new governor is a psychotic.
[01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:39.820]  He's got a tax.
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:44.500]  Americans continue their march to low tax states, the hill.
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:48.900]  So that's all I'm getting at is it's like, just stay in your hell.
[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:50.540]  Just stay in your cesspit.
[01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:52.100]  Stay away from me.
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:53.100]  I trigger them though.
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:54.100]  I trigger them.
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:55.100]  I trigger them.

[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:02.540]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:04.100]  I sued the IRS in one.

[01:29:58.620 --> 01:29:59.620]  It's simple.
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:02.380]  If you want to beat the globalist, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:05.060]  doing Bitcoin pumping doms with Jack Dorsey.
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:07.540]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:11.180]  I'm not sitting here selling you late-term abortion and all the great it is.
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:14.140]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:17.900]  What is the top tumor that's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory and what's
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:19.220]  the best lab in the country?
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:20.300]  Okay, they're the highest rate.
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:21.940]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:25.980]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product and bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:30.660]  I'm like, what's the highest you could do a month later, 90, 95%?
[01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:31.660]  No one's ever done it.
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:32.820]  I said, how much did that cost for a bottle?
[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:34.140]  It cost $10.
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:35.580]  No one's ever done that, sir.
[01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:37.860]  The average competitor's 3% to 5%.
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:38.860]  The top brand's 50%.
[01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:41.380]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:44.740]  I mean, you understand, like, that's like our information's explosive?

[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:56.300]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over like one of these devil worshipers?

[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:11.780]  When he goes wiggling through the grass, it tickles his underneath
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:18.780]  Well Sneaky Snake drinks root beer and he just makes me sick
[01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:24.780]  When he is not dancing, he looks just like a stick
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:31.780]  Now he doesn't have any arms or legs, you cannot see his ears
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:37.780]  And while we are not looking, he's stealing all of our beer
[01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:44.780]  And then Sneaky Snake goes dancing, wiggling and a hissing
[01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:51.780]  Sneaky Snake goes dancing, giggling and a kissing
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:36:06.780]  And then Sneaky Snake goes dancing, wiggling and a hissing

[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:54.280]  Why why aren't why aren't they allowed to talk to me?
[01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:59.400]  Okay, then I suggest that you should probably keep your mouth shut and let them do what they want
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:04.000]  Okay, are you gonna be rude?
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  No
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:10.080]  Yes, I record every interaction I have on a college campus
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:19.000]  What am I gaining what is your game from all this I'm just talking to students and getting their opinions
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.680]  I want to ask them questions. We're making videos. What is your game?
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:26.200]  Like what are you? It's my job keeping from this money
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:32.840]  You get paid to do this. Yes by who can I ask like who wants you to be doing this? Oh?
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:39.040]  My god, it's a scam. She's like running a scam. Oh, do you enjoy doing this? I do
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:45.560]  Don't you have a degree from Kent? I do and this is what you choose to do with it. Yes. This is your choice
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:53.120]  Yes, this isn't this women's empowerment. You can do whatever you want and feminism and supporting women's rights to God engage in free speech
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:38:00.760]  You have such a platform that you could be doing great things with I think promoting gun rights is a great thing to use my platform for
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:06.720]  College campus. Yes. I don't honestly. I have no problem with gun rights. I just think this is a little crazy
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:12.320]  What what's so crazy about that you're standing around college campuses talking about it?
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:17.920]  Like aren't there better places to be speaking about? No college campuses are the perfect place to talk about gun rights
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:22.240]  Because one in five women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:28.880]  That is your choice, but don't take their choice away from me to be able to defend myself against a rapist on campus
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:34.320]  Don't be selfish. He's telling me this. Yeah, I'm I'm really confused why you think
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:41.200]  Giving people guns is the right idea. I don't even think people I never said we should I didn't say we should give people guns
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.440]  Defend myself. I said you should have the choice
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:47.480]  The choice is a little bit different than are you pro-choice?
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:53.240]  Of course, I am so why don't you don't I don't you respect my right to choose what firearm I have
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:59.280]  You can have whatever firearm you want, but walking around a college campus promoting it
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:06.160]  It's probably one of the worst ways to get the message. I'm sorry. You feel that way. That's disappointing that are you a feminist?
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:10.960]  Does it matter? It does matter. No, it does. You're not a feminist
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:18.280]  Those are not it's not feminist fallacy to try and convince your argument and you're wrong
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:23.400]  I'm right, but thank you for your opinion. I appreciate it. I told you she was too close-minded
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:30.240]  You're very aggressive about you're the one that was shouting at me. You want to talk about an aggressive
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.880]  That's some feminism
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:36.640]  Do I need to introduce myself? Do you want me to say my pronouns too while I'm at it?
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:39.080]  Are you a feminist after you just know?
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:48.240]  So you're trying to use people's own opinions against them. Yes, I want to see your I want you to see your hypocrisy
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.480]  in your own arguments
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:55.280]  Do you see any hypocrisy in your own arguments? What what hypocrisy I mean if you're trying to find
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:02.000]  You're saying women should you're trying to say women should be able to protect themselves at their right, but you aren't a feminist
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:04.680]  Yeah, I do not
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:10.840]  Associate with the feminist of today. I don't associate with that. I believe in equality and equal rights for everyone
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:15.000]  But today's feminist. I don't support what they do
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:20.880]  I don't support a lot of feminists. We see at the women's march. They don't support what I support. They support abortion
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:26.000]  I don't support that. No, they're pro-choice the choice. They should have their choice as well. Do you not agree with that?
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:33.120]  I don't think people have the choice to kill others. I don't think that's are you trying to say that early abortion is
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.160]  killing I
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.240]  Think once it has a heartbeat it is murder
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:43.960]  Are also no because you have to have a fertilized. No, I don't know. It's not you have to have a fertilized egg
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:49.600]  It has to be attached inside the uterine wall for it to start developing into a baby
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:55.240]  So are you trying to say that if a woman gets raped that it is not her choice to get an abortion? That is what I'm saying. Oh
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:00.480]  There's really a lot of hypocrisy in what you say then okay, I
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:06.040]  Appreciate your opinions in gun rights, but they don't get a choice in their own bodies
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:08.800]  But they get it's not your body their guns are good
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:13.040]  You know what will protect against someone getting raped and they don't have to have an abortion a gun
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:19.200]  Yes, why if they get knocked upside the head and they can't use a gun then what what's your all right? Thank you
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:24.240]  I don't think too wrong to make a right just because someone was raped doesn't mean that baby should be murdered. Oh
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:26.680]  Wow
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:33.680]  I'm like blown away. I've never I didn't know you were this crazy. I know it's so crazy to not support murder
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:36.120]  It would have known. Oh, wow
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:42.560]  Wow, I gotta go. Wow you I know facts scare people weird epiphany look at this
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:57.360]  Oh my god, did you hear her? She just said the sky is blue
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:03.920]  She just said like if someone stabs an unborn baby and kills it they should go to jail
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:09.360]  But New York just legalized it. This is upside down echo chamber cuckoo land
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:17.480]  Where Caitlyn Bennett is out there alma mater saying they're killing babies after they're born the governor of Virginia's saying
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:22.240]  He doesn't back down on it. Who cares if he wore the stupid blackface. I wouldn't do that
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:25.120]  I think it's distasteful, but killing babies
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:31.160]  After they're born is next level and it means nothing
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:36.480]  And this is what you pay for this is what America this is how you bring down America
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:39.840]  So you bring down a free country say it undermined a Christian nation
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.360]  It's how you conquer people
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:48.640]  Now I went off half-cocked her like I gave them bad directions all my fault. We come back though Joe Rogan makes
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:43:03.240]  Stuff beyond blackface stuff. I mean this is next level Joe Rogan. Well, what's gonna happen with this major scandal?
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:08.200]  By leaps and by bounds
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:10.520]  The number one best-selling
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:15.000]  Supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:22.400]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:25.440]  But burnout in just a few hours and have terrible side effects

[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:45.880]  Package to mix in the fruges or water whatever you'd like warning though. It's very very strong
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:47.200]  It lasts 10 hours
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:52.760]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you into

[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:00.540]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:09.940]  Censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored the most buried the most suppressed and
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:13.580]  That's the videos where you saw in
[01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:16.580]  2016 election night all the arrogant
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:21.860]  Leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt-hurt when Trump won
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:27.780]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did
[01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:32.900]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in fours down
[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.940]  This is a fight about taking your speech away
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:41.300]  Not just my speech about taking your very sovereignty away. This country is in a war
[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:44.260]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done

[01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:08.140]  This fear of the leftist and the globalist
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:11.420]  You'll be censored if you don't lay down to them
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:14.620]  Real fear is laying down and what comes after
[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:21.660]  All right, I don't want to attack my old friends of 21 years Joe Rogan
[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:24.940]  But in the last decade or so we grew apart
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:30.980]  I didn't go to UFC matches didn't go to most of his comedy shows didn't hang out with him four or five times a year like
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:34.980]  I've done since 1998. I might see him once a year. He might call me a few times a year
[01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:36.980]  I might call him a few times a year
[01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:41.380]  And then my listeners told me why are you saying Joe's a good guy?
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:48.660]  He's having all these globalists on these CIA people on he's pushing censorship and then I
[01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:51.300]  Got sued for Sandy Hook
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:57.900]  Because my listeners question the official story the internet did I looked at yet and said I
[01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:05.260]  Could see how folks think it stays or some anomalies, but over the years. I couldn't say definitively. So I said, okay the shooting happened
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:08.620]  They're just using the shooting to demonize
[01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:14.700]  All gun owners and that's wrong. That's not letting a good crisis
[01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:21.060]  Go to waste the words of Roman annual Obama's former Chief of Staff and the Chicago mayor who's outgoing
[01:49:22.260 --> 01:49:26.020]  But then I began to see him with Jack Dorsey on and promoting
[01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:30.700]  Square cash and not explaining that that's his company or that Joe is being sponsored by it
[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:35.060]  Or that they're making Bitcoin the main functioning system of that and not the other
[01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:38.180]  Cryptocurrencies and seeing a global government the global currency
[01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:43.860]  So I got critical of Joe about that and then I got sent this clip of
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:47.980]  Joe this is got to be five six years ago and
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:50.900]  I'm not even gonna say what's on the tape
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:54.500]  Because corporate media is so deceptive
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:50:02.060]  Established media they won't take what I said and put it out that he said well, that's their problem. Yeah, man. Let me tell you something
[01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:06.540]  I said Hillary was responsible for hundreds of thousands of dead and in Libya in the Middle East and
[01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:12.860]  Tens of thousands of women and children to sex slavery and torture to death and Megan Kelly on Fox edited in with another tape of me
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:14.860]  talking about pizza game and
[01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:20.820]  It's in a lawsuit an edited tape now once we get there that'll be a big issue, but I'm talking about Iraq
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:24.860]  I'm talking about Syria. I'm talking about Libya. They edited that in with other tape. It's crazy
[01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:30.780]  So I've just learned that I'm not gonna say what Joe said here
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:37.500]  I'm gonna play what Joe said and I'm gonna make clear. I don't endorse this but I want to be a thousand percent clear after that a
[01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:40.420]  trillion percent
[01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:42.420]  Joe's a comedian and
[01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:48.980]  Joe is not a racist and Joe is a very very private person
[01:50:48.980 --> 01:50:57.420]  But I'm gonna unleash this controversy because Joe has to see what it's like when things are cherry-picked
[01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:01.820]  You know, I don't want to get into Joe's private life
[01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:11.460]  But Joe has raved his wife who's had children with black children Joe loves black people
[01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:15.700]  Yeah, overall that he was a very loving person
[01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:19.940]  He doesn't like racist. He doesn't like bullies. I think Joe's been a good person
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:24.100]  That's why it's so hurtful and then no one knows that he is adopted black children
[01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:33.700]  Doesn't matter Joe if I went on air and said the things you said in a comedy piece I
[01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:43.500]  Would be finished I had a four-star platinum rating with banks until three months ago. I
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:50.420]  Had the lowest charge back for customers. I had the highest rate. No one's ever seen somebody
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:53.700]  That gets charged a percent and a half
[01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:06.380]  That was because ten years ago people try to order stuff and charge back it to hurt our score
[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:08.220]  We just say we'll eat charge backs
[01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:10.220]  We have the highest
[01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:12.540]  Platinum rating you can get
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:16.980]  Now we have an F rating. No judge. No jury. We're getting ready to follow lawsuits
[01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:24.100]  There's a special corporate secret group that puts the designations on it's very serious towards interference issue
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:28.740]  But imagine that Joe I have perfect credit perfect corporate credit perfect
[01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:31.980]  Banking credit perfect
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:36.980]  Perfect never took a loan five-star everything perfect
[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:43.900]  Almost no one has it. In fact, they believe I may have the most perfect credit ever seen seriously. It's that sick
[01:52:46.620 --> 01:52:53.540]  But I'm being unpersoned Joe I'm being destroyed and then you sit there and compare black people to planet of the apes
[01:52:56.060 --> 01:53:01.900]  Beyond blackface and that's supposedly a okay and look you're a comedian. I know you're not a racist
[01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:07.100]  We're all Simeon. I mean, I mean I look like a gorilla. I'll stand there with my clothes off today
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:12.740]  But why it's like God you look like a gorilla. I'm like, yeah, I'm not trying to look like I've got this giant 20-inch neck and this huge chest
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:17.940]  I'm not bragging my chest is as big as Schwarzenegger's in his prime. It's ridiculous. I look like a gorilla
[01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:21.980]  I walk like a gorilla. We're all Simeon. Of course white people look like gorillas
[01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:25.140]  Of course black people are gorillas, but we're in that family
[01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:28.020]  We're the super IQ super gorilla
[01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:35.180]  Jacked into God, but the point is Joe you can't have the whole leftist thing and then eat the cake too, bro
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:37.940]  You can't do it man
[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:44.060]  You can't live like that you can't judge me and then take out a context
[01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:48.340]  What I've done like you're high and mighty when this is in your life and this is the thing comedians now know
[01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:51.420]  Then go back to stuff 10 years old
[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:57.940]  20 years old 25, I don't like the governor north of him. He's just killed babies after they're born. That's why I hate him
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:05.980]  But what do you think went on in the south 25 27 30 years ago in Democrats? Of course they dress up like that. That's all they do
[01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:09.500]  One time I got invited to a Halloween party
[01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:14.260]  And I showed up like 10 years ago. It was all white people dressed up like black people
[01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:18.020]  They said oh, it's just fun where I'm fun. I said I'm getting out of here, man
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:24.540]  Because I don't want to have some celebration thinking I'm better than somebody like I saw blacks making fun of white people
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:28.580]  I see her a bunch of damn racist. I'm sick of it. I believe in Martin Luther King. I
[01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:33.700]  Believe in what people stand for what they do is how they're judged
[01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:42.280]  Not off what color they are and all this anti-white racism crap. I stand against it, but let me tell you if I said what Joe said
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:50.040]  He was all for my deplatforming before now these under the heat is like well leave Alex won't take fine great Joe
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:52.040]  I'm just letting you know something
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:58.240]  That I know you're not a racist and I know you do comedy because you think it's funny your interracial jokes
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:03.560]  Which are true like the most the interracial porn gets bought in the south and funny your older jokes about oh look at that
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:06.800]  But that white woman. Oh, that's funny stuff, man
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:13.440]  And I agree comedy should be comedy, but the left wants to project racism on everything and you want to cuddle up to it
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:15.440]  So feel what it's like Joe
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:22.960]  Here's Joe talking about going to see Planet of the Apes movie and then he gets in a black neighborhood
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:28.280]  Well, just here for yourself. Here it is. There's Planet of the Apes man
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:29.240]  We're gonna go see Planet of the Apes
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:33.840]  So I look on the iPhone app and it says okay take me to this one and the guy goes okay
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:37.360]  He goes out in a good neighborhood. He's like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah guy barely speaks English
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:43.460]  Hey, Texas there we get out and we're giggling. Oh, he's he plays we walk into Planet of the Apes
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:51.440]  We walked into Africa dude. We walked in the door and there was no white people. There was no white people
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:55.880]  Joe Rogan just said black people are apes
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:56:07.720]  Well, I guess what's the in-between size mesomorphs like we got big muscles. We're not a big torso short legs. I mean I I
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:10.400]  Mean blood there's some black people
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:16.160]  Like Joe saying look like me and look like an eighth or something. They're super tall and don't the point is there's white people
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:19.960]  Look like that because we are simian, but the point is is that
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:25.920]  You can't sit there and say I went to a black neighborhood on my iPhone app
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:29.240]  And they and I was in Planet of the Apes saying black people are apes
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:37.040]  Joe Rogan just said black people are apes just like Watson the former head of the Cold Springs Harbor Group said blacks aren't human
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:39.040]  They're apes
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:45.800]  Well, they're apes then how can we breed with them Joe and are you saying your daughter is an ape
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:49.920]  Hey, man, it's you up on your sanctimonious hours there, bro
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:57.560]  Why frankly I am like an ape I can pull somebody's head off. I've got ape-like strength
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:03.680]  I'll beat some big old black guys asses too thought they could kick my ass they found out who the real ape was
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:10.800]  I'm King Kong, baby. I'm not ashamed of my simian nature, but you can't sit there and
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:15.160]  And pull crap like that and say crap like that in a glass house
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.160]  It's and basically I mean you heard it geez geez
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:31.600]  Snake farm just damn nasty
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:38.440]  So there you go Joe Rogan says black people look like apes and black neighborhoods are Planet of the Apes

[01:59:53.760 --> 02:00:06.960]  I'm no stranger to the rain
[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:16.480]  I'm a friend of thunder friend. Is it any wonder a lot of me
[02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:35.520]  You know species means you can have sex with somebody and they have and you have a baby
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:41.880]  Who can then have babies you can have a horse and a mule
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:44.880]  They can have sex they can't have babies
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:50.880]  You can have a horse and a donkey have sex and they have a mule
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:54.880]  It's a hybrid the species is so close, but it can't have a baby
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:01:00.880]  So I'm gonna tag this song we post this info wars calm blast Joe Rogan video. I don't take pleasure
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:18.880]  In going after Joe Rogan, but he wants to sit up there and sanctimoniously say that Nazi collaborator George Soros was a victim of the Nazis when he went on 60 minutes at NPR and said it was happy making best time of his life exhilarating. These are quotes Joe
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:22.880]  He's funding the Nazi EU
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:26.880]  And then let's play the clip again. He says
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:31.880]  Six seven years ago on his Apple app. He's going to see planet of the apes and directs him to this good neighborhood
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:41.880]  So it's very elitist to like oh, I want a good neighborhood. It says it's a good place and I go and it's black people
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:47.880]  And it's planet of the apes
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:55.880]  Of the apes well if you think about apes you've got apes with pink skin brown skin black skin
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:01.880]  They're not humans and those apes species can't make babies together. We're our own amazing species
[02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:14.880]  And the genetics of a white person versus a black person aren't even 1% different
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:22.880]  And by issue ish
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:26.880]  Doesn't matter Asians on average can't process alcohol
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:33.880]  Asians have different structures their spine humans are different. We are diverging species, but we're still the same species
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:41.880]  And I'm not some virtuous signaler here who's guilty to be white
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:51.880]  Being a northern European I am endowed on average with the highest IQ of any group of people on the planet
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:54.880]  Now that doesn't mean on a curve document cam shop, please
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:57.880]  You know on these bell curves they do
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:04.880]  That doesn't mean that on average white people or Japanese are right up there have the highest IQ
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:11.880]  It doesn't mean there aren't black people that are up there too. It means on average there are more Japanese and more whites that are on that curve
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:18.880]  And people can say well or Russians or whoever you want to say use it or say well, that's the test
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:20.880]  It doesn't matter where people make it spaceships and computers
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:29.880]  It's in the West, but that isn't meaning then we hate black people
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:33.880]  Because there are black people statistically they're as smart as anybody on the planet
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:44.880]  It means on average whites have the highest IQ on average white people have the highest IQ
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:46.880]  Have the highest IQ on average
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:55.880]  Well you better have an IQ if you were spending hundreds of thousands of years in frozen wasteland at the top of the planet
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:00.880]  Because if you went to bed if you got back in your cave 10 minutes too late you were dead in a doornail
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:08.880]  In Africa and other areas in the equatorial regions it was about how strong you were how fast you were
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:17.880]  How cunning you were not about long-term strategic thinking
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:28.880]  So when I sit here and I criticize Joe for calling black people apes dude we are apes
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:34.880]  And I know you know that it doesn't mean we're not divine and God made us an image there's other things
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:43.880]  The point is is that you get away with that when it's not even accurate and people don't call you on that
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:47.880]  But at the same time then let's not hate white people
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:05:04.880]  Let's thank white people for electricity and airplanes and medicine
[02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:13.880]  By leaps and by bounds the number one best selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements
[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:20.880]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost
[02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:23.880]  But burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects

[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:28.880]  4 out of 5 Catholic priests are gay so homosexuals make up 3% of the population and I don't hate anybody
[02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:36.880]  I don't judge anybody okay I've been on the earth 45 years I've seen some things I've done some things I'm not judging anybody
[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:43.880]  I mean I've paid for abortions back when I was a teenager and I repented to God for it been fighting ever since
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:51.880]  I've killed my children I think on a scale of 1 to 10 that's like a 7 you know 2 dudes together is like a 3
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:58.880]  I'm not judging anybody but I'm telling you the realization of what's right and what's wrong is important
[02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:08.880]  London Guardian article 1 out of 5 Vatican priests gay so what happens is you get a system where no women are allowed
[02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:19.880]  Where the family isn't there and this is what it's going to draw a giant bathhouse and then you have the blackmail
[02:07:19.880 --> 02:07:28.880]  But let me tell you something I know who Leo Zagami was 15 years ago and the only reason I knew who he was is like all over the internet
[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:37.880]  He's a liar he's bad he's evil he's this he's that and then about 8 years ago I read I can't remember a couple of his books he's written on 15 books or something
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:44.880]  He correct me when I'm wrong but a lot of them and I was like well there's going to be a Jesuit black pope and then like 6-7 years ago
[02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:50.880]  It's going to be the current pope out of South America and he's going to use pedophilia blackmail to get in control
[02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:58.880]  And Pope Francis and then it all came true and then there's HD video this we never made a film we got so busy we put it out
[02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:05.880]  YouTube deleted it got like 5 million views I met the Vatican with him and his book is lightning striking the Vatican
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:09.880]  And we're there and they've got the secret police there and everything and I've already gone to the Vatican
[02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:15.880]  He's taken me in castles and show me all the secrets all sudden this storm appears on nowhere and I mean my wife was there then girlfriend
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:19.880]  She was like this is this a movie it was like boiling blue clouds and
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:25.880]  Lightning striking and it's on video we've got it somewhere we should reupload it because YouTube took it down 5 million views
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:31.880]  And then Zagami off record took me to a bunch of castles and secret society stuff
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:36.880]  She's been in the real Illuminati and came out of it and exposed it and so let me tell you
[02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:41.880]  Back then I was like okay. This sounds crazy this guy. Nobody's more accurate Leo Zagami
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:46.880]  And then he said they the deputy Pope the post best friend in Australia
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:51.880]  He's the main runner of thousands of kids he gets arrested for kidnapping over a hundred kids secret trial
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:55.880]  I'm telling you you're Leo Zagami folks. This is not talk
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:02.880]  This is somebody goes from aristocratic family friends of Berlusconi. He knows what he's talking about
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:08.880]  And he can really tell you what's going on because now again the pedophiles take over the Vatican
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:14.880]  Because I'm not here saying Catholics are evil or have been bad in real history. It's a complex organization. It's like anything
[02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:19.880]  Like Oliver Cromwell turned started out good and turned out bad things are complex, but
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:24.880]  This hasn't been a reformation in the Catholic Church. This has been a takeover
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:30.880]  By the true Satanist who won a blaspheme in the church like Pennsylvania where they you know pinned
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:35.880]  Priest have sex with an eight-year-old boy and get in the sacrament, you know in his mouth and his rear end
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:40.880]  I don't be gross or with a family audience. This is Satanism is about blasphemy
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:44.880]  And so now they use the Satanism the blackmailing your control
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:51.880]  But now it's undermining it as well because they can't stop blackmailing each other and Leo Zagami joins us because he's got gay drama
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:58.880]  Explodes in Vatican as Pope Francis prepares to defrock Archbishop McCratt it so joining us is
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:02.880]  Leo Zagami of Leo Zagami calm not gonna go over his whole bio would take hours
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:08.880]  But let me tell you you want somebody who's got their pulse. I don't just for many guests. I'm telling you this guy
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:12.880]  Has got his pulse on what's happening Leo. Thanks for joining us
[02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:16.880]  Hello Alex and it's always a pleasure to be with you
[02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:20.880]  I am afraid that we are all being persecuted me included
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:26.880]  But we are here to report on the latest scandal which is hitting the Vatican very hard and it's basically
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:30.880]  Archbishop McCarrick soon to be defrock
[02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:35.880]  So he's basically gonna go back to the state of a normal human being
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:43.880]  Without the protection of the Vatican but at this point there is a coup d'etat in the Vatican because he's a lover
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:50.880]  Who is still in control cardinal father decides that maybe they should not totally defrock
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:54.880]  I mean there is a lot of tension going on right while we are talking
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:59.880]  In these hours Alex this is current is not even breaking news on the media
[02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:04.880]  I mean everybody is waiting for Pope Francis to defrock Archbishop McCarrick
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:12.880]  But in the meantime of course cardinal father who is responsible for the deacres theory of family and life
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:15.880]  And this guy was living with McCarrick
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:20.880]  I mean it's not just the guy who was living they were living in the same flat for seven years
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:28.880]  And and and all this basically brings us to the decadence of this a Catholic church that we have been talking about for
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:34.880]  For many years which is by the way, I don't get into the Virgin Mary on pastries and things you don't either
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:38.880]  I met the I met Rome for a week. I'm I meet you the day before meeting the next day
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:44.880]  We go to the Vatican. There's no rain. You're talking for 30 minutes clouds appear and just like your book lightning strikes it
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:47.880]  For only the second time you've seen while we're there we have video of this
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:49.880]  We're trying to what was that
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:55.880]  Well Alex in the Vatican there is a lot of black magic and a lot of magic
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:00.880]  This is a holy place since ancient Rome even before the Vatican came along
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:06.880]  Energy's manifest very strong right there when we were in front of that obelisk
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:09.880]  There is some very powerful energies
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:13.880]  So what was the cult that was there out in swamps with the Romans?
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:18.880]  Well, there there was the Mitraic Cal Mithra
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:24.880]  Yes, they had their own cave there and they of course made the sacrifices
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:33.880]  The thing is that the church has been hijacked by Satanists in 1963 officially when they celebrated the black mass right inside the Vatican
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:36.880]  I mean that was the moment in which
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:41.880]  Let's explain Satan loves the rituals in the church explain that
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:46.880]  Yes, well at that point there was a rat singer who was
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:52.880]  Not yet, of course Pope Ratzinger, but he was an important figure already
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:13:02.880]  As somebody who was celebrating the mass with other key figures of the Roman black aristocracy and of the church
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:09.880]  I mean these people really enthroned Satan and from then on they started a new satanic era
[02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:14.880]  That will manifest with the visit of the pope to New York
[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:20.880]  For the first time a pope goes to New York and it's even in Rosemary's babies film
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:24.880]  This citation of the pope being in New York at one point
[02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:27.880]  Ratzinger now is
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:30.880]  So now here's the question now they're in crisis
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:35.880]  Am I right to say the blackmail they use to get full control is now threatening them is that accurate?
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:39.880]  Well, of course they're all blackmailing each other because they don't know how to get out of it
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:45.880]  I mean the fact that in the last 24 hours we've been waiting for this announcement of the defrocking of
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:54.880]  of attribution mechanic is symptomatic of the fact that attribution mechanic is one of the key people in the US to run the pedophile rings
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:58.880]  And we'll cover that next segment, but let me ask you this just a few months ago
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:03.880]  You said Pope Francis will stop the pedophile investigation in the US
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:07.880]  He indeed did that and almost had no news coverage. What happened there?
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:15.880]  Well, he used the excuse of calling on all the Cardinals to Rome for the end of this month
[02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:21.880]  So now we are about to encounter the biggest event in recent Vatican history
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:27.880]  From the 20th of February when there will be this synod on the abuse of minors
[02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:35.880]  And then at that point on the 25th and 26th instead there will be a workshop on robotics
[02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:43.880]  which is the preparatory stage of the 2020 artificial intelligence meeting in the Vatican
[02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:47.880]  in which cyber Satan will be officially bored
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:53.880]  Which is what Revelation says will be like this 25 foot projection of Antichrist the beast that's seen everywhere
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:15:00.880]  Yes, and of course the mark of the beast, the microchipping will be imposed by the robots
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:05.880]  That's why Abu Dhabi's experimentation with the Robocops has been so important
[02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:09.880]  And that's why the Pope went there to kickstart Islam
[02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:13.880]  And let's be clear, you're an expert on Islam because you infiltrated it
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:17.880]  When we come back, the globalists admit they don't want humans' little question orders
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:21.880]  That's why they're already putting trans people in the military all of it to kill morale
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:25.880]  The age of the machines is here because they'll follow orders
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:29.880]  Absolutely, and they have to be blind orders because they're going to be knocking on your door and say
[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:33.880]  Are you microchipped? Yes or no? That's it
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:36.880]  Yeah, Pull Up China has its new killer bots
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:38.880]  But if you don't have the chip, they kill you, that's mainstream news
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:41.880]  You take a chip in China and if you don't, the robot kills you
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:46.880]  Little drones, little helicopters with grenade launchers and shotguns
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:53.880]  You don't have it? We'll be right back with Leo Zagami, the antichrist is about to be born upon us
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:20.880]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:23.880]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:48.880]  It hit me when I was arrested

[02:22:45.880 --> 02:22:48.880]  Look, you're getting into all the facts, all the issues, all the people
[02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:56.880]  You literally, 15 years ago when I first read your work, 10 years ago when I first heard of having you on
[02:22:56.880 --> 02:23:02.880]  You were so confident, you laid it all out, it all came true, so let me ask you this
[02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:05.880]  Or have you lost your crystal ball, and I'm saying sometimes I have as well
[02:23:05.880 --> 02:23:10.880]  What's coming next, Leo Zagami?
[02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:18.880]  There is a connection that I found out which we'll explain where we're going next
[02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:23.880]  Hello?
[02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:28.880]  They're punching some buttons in there, I don't know what's going on, but you're on air, go ahead, please continue
[02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:33.880]  Okay, there is a direct connection that will explain where we're going in the future
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:40.880]  Because I found this incredible link between the Jesuits, Cardinal Parolin, the Secretary of State
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:45.880]  The Giorgio Bassi from the Academy of the Illuminati, John Podesta and Moscow
[02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:53.880]  And a particular office in Moscow of this group that wants to dominate the world
[02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:57.880]  Which is called the International Organization for the Destinies of the World
[02:23:57.880 --> 02:24:00.880]  Behind the real Russian collusion
[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:10.880]  They are the ones who are plotting for the return in power of people from the Democratic Party that they have always worked with
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:18.880]  And of course where we're going is towards a demonic situation in which the artificial intelligence takes over
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:23.880]  We get silence, they place in power all these people that are just robots
[02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:27.880]  Because we have seen that the left wing just acting as robots
[02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:33.880]  And of course the demonic forces will prosper and take over the system if we don't stop them
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:40.880]  So we are at a crucial point in history and you have said this over and over again on your show
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:46.880]  And I also endorse your products because you're doing a great job in surviving with infowars
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:52.880]  And we are trying to survive because this is still a voice of freedom, but we don't know for how long
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:57.880]  Because this legion of demons is growing more and more powerful each day
[02:24:57.880 --> 02:25:02.880]  And they control the artificial intelligence, they control Silicon Valley
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:07.880]  So for how long are we going to be allowed to even talk on the World Wide Web?
[02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:12.880]  Is this a matter of time? So this is where we are going Alex
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:14.880]  That was my next question
[02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:21.880]  They lied at Congress, they lied, total censorship is taking place, total attacks, they're openly trying to sexualize children
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:25.880]  Pedophilia is being announced in the news is a good thing, there's a coming out
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:30.880]  I see that as a sign of weakness, but as you said the enemy does control the technocracy
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:38.880]  The absolute control of the technocracy because I have evidence in my new book, Volume 6.66
[02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:46.880]  That John Podesta met with Pierre Giorgio Bassi to discuss some very delicate matters that regard alien life
[02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:55.880]  That apparently these aliens who are demonic aliens are feeding information to Moscow
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:58.880]  That they can then use to take over the planet
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:01.880]  This is what is happening, the Jesuits are in on it
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:08.880]  Cardinal Parolin sent the head of the Jesuit Astronomical Observatory to Moscow
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:13.880]  Flupier Giorgio Bassi to discuss this whole thing because
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:16.880]  I want to stop right there, I got Stuart Rhodes coming up, I want to do five more minutes with you
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:19.880]  Because here's the deal, I'm a Christian, I believe in God
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:24.880]  But I don't ever see the flying saucer, I don't get into Bigfoot, Tuba Cabras, Easter Bunnies
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:29.880]  Kebler Elves, Santa Claus or Socialism Working, I don't believe in it
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:34.880]  But when you study San Francisco and you study the CIA, they're taking drugs
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:38.880]  They believe inter-dimensionally to talk to aliens in another dimension, that's their cult
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:43.880]  Then you look exactly, you're saying Moscow and they believe they're in contact
[02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:47.880]  Well then why is the US been given all the advanced technology?
[02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:51.880]  But when you talk to the average elitist, the average billionaire, I've talked to some of them
[02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:56.880]  Like Elon Musk has come out against all this, they believe they're in contact with off-world
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:00.880]  Or inter-dimensional entities, and so you're bringing up this bombshell information
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:02.880]  Because that's what this all comes down to
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:08.880]  There is a specific group that is called the Expert Management Unit of General Staff
[02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:15.880]  And there is actually an academic, important academic in Russia called Natalia Beketeva
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:20.880]  And then there is Lieutenant General Alexi Savin, these people with the Jesuits
[02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:25.880]  They are doing and working for the real Russian collusion with these demonic forces
[02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:28.880]  And I have the evidence for it now
[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:32.880]  Hold on, you've said so much has been true over the years about the Vatican, you've been trolled by them
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:35.880]  And I'm not even defending Russia, he said Russia was good with Berlusoni
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:39.880]  What about San Francisco and how they think they're working with the off-world influence?
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:44.880]  They're already controlled Alex, they have completely submitted
[02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:51.880]  That's why John Podesta and all those people have already made a deal with Silicon Valley, Obama
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:55.880]  Wait, what you're saying, the Russians are now making the deal with the off-world group?
[02:27:55.880 --> 02:28:00.880]  Yeah, of course, that's what they're doing and we have the evidence here
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:04.880]  I'm not talking about conspiracy theories, I have evidence that I'm showing in my new book
[02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:08.880]  Which is called Volume 6.66 and it's gonna create a stand
[02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:12.880]  Because this evidence has accurate sources, very accurate
[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:15.880]  We're not just bragging, there is serious journalism
[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:18.880]  Well, let's be clear, we're on a planet in deep space
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:22.880]  Whether you believe in the entities of the devil or God or not, the elites believe
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:25.880]  From skull and bones to all these groups, to Aleister Crowley
[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:29.880]  That they're getting divine influence from angels or entities
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:35.880]  And then the stuff they get, like Darwin had hallucinations that became everything
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:42.880]  So did Galton, Biometrics, the DNA, they were given, I would not say divine, but demonic inspiration
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:47.880]  And so what we're talking about is what the elite believe, doesn't mean we believe it, doesn't mean it's all real
[02:28:47.880 --> 02:29:06.880]  This is their religion, so I'm gonna get Leo Zagami's take on that when we come back, stay with us
[02:29:17.880 --> 02:29:20.880]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:23.880]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't
[02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:48.880]  It hit me when I was arrested
[02:29:48.880 --> 02:29:54.880]  Call right now, before it's too late, 800-213-9264
[02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:24.880]  That sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects
[02:30:24.880 --> 02:30:33.880]  We have developed, hands down, from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world
[02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:38.880]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it, it is a total game changer
[02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:43.880]  And it comes in easy to use, packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like
[02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:48.880]  So it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half pack at the first time you take it
[02:30:48.880 --> 02:30:52.880]  Because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive
[02:30:52.880 --> 02:30:55.880]  TurboForce, at M4sLife.com
[02:30:55.880 --> 02:31:03.880]  At M4s, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell
[02:31:03.880 --> 02:31:09.880]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there
[02:31:09.880 --> 02:31:16.880]  And we private label it and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens
[02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:21.880]  We also have another product also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle
[02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:25.880]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle
[02:31:25.880 --> 02:31:34.880]  We're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at M4sLife.com and M4sTour.com
[02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:44.880]  This is a limited time immune boost special. It's super blue, silver immune gargle and super silver wound dressing for 40% off at M4sTour.com
[02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:55.880]  Again, this is a limited time immune boost special. It's super blue, silver immune gargle and super silver wound dressing for 40% off at M4sTour.com
[02:31:55.880 --> 02:32:00.880]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now
[02:32:00.880 --> 02:32:09.880]  InfoWords is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate
[02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:14.880]  People say, why would you start a fight with them? Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground
[02:32:14.880 --> 02:32:19.880]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this. So we've already had incredible success
[02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:27.880]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target
[02:32:27.880 --> 02:32:33.880]  And if you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at M4sTour.com
[02:32:33.880 --> 02:32:38.880]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win
[02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:44.880]  We have huge sales at M4sTour.com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you
[02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:48.880]  Despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market
[02:32:48.880 --> 02:32:52.880]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and the Globalist may win
[02:32:52.880 --> 02:32:57.880]  This is M4s Darkness Hour. We do your support. I'm counting on you
[02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:27.880]  Strange days have found us
[02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:29.880]  Strange days
[02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:35.880]  Strange days have tracked us down
[02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:37.880]  Well, they've tracked us down
[02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:44.880]  They're going to destroy
[02:33:44.880 --> 02:34:02.880]  We're on a planet in deep space on a tiny little galaxy out of the trillions
[02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:04.880]  Two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm
[02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:10.880]  Leo Sagan invests something off the researcher in Rome is our guest finishing up with him
[02:34:10.880 --> 02:34:21.880]  Just the fantastical nature of mainstream news admitting that the Vatican is a giant homosexual orgy facility
[02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:30.880]  With a bunch of dead kids getting raped and every major diocese from Austin, Texas to Boston, Massachusetts to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
[02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:35.880]  Is just a giant cult, an army that took over the church
[02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:43.880]  And now it's all coming out. What are they going to do? I think their answer is bring in a war, bring in tyranny, bring in suppression
[02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:47.880]  I think we're seeing their answer and like you said, what is the secret society nature?
[02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:55.880]  If the devil's fallen, not of this world, but now the God of this world, what does the God of this world want? What's the end game?
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:35:06.880]  They wanted the birth of the Antichrist. The Anno Satane 1 was 1966. They were overdue the arrival of the Antichrist
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:15.880]  This is not a joke. The Vatican has been reformed to facilitate the demons. In 1999 they even reformed their own exorcism right
[02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:22.880]  So now they are like giving just a couple of signs of the cross instead of 14 or 12 more
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:30.880]  And they have reformed the whole Catholic liturgy to facilitate this demonic possession of our society
[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:37.880]  Because the right of exorcism is the only right that can stop these creatures, these demons that talk with Russia, facilitate Russia
[02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:43.880]  But Russia then plays both sides of the game and of course then you are tricked in it
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:51.880]  Because behind there is these demonic forces and they are with the Vatican totally in league together
[02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:56.880]  So they have transformed the Vatican in this gay pedophile sect
[02:35:56.880 --> 02:36:02.880]  So then they can welcome the Antichrist and they have done it already Alex in 1963
[02:36:02.880 --> 02:36:06.880]  And Father Malachi Martin was a victim of these demons
[02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:13.880]  We are fighting a war here with entities that are not of this world that possess our politicians, our religious leaders
[02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:17.880]  This has to be taken very seriously before it gets out of control
[02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:25.880]  Because the moment the artificial intelligence plan gets everything, then Cyber Satan will simply enslave this race
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:28.880]  So we need to understand this
[02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:39.880]  So we have an omnipresent system, temporarily interfaced with a spiritual system, finally giving the demonic projection real world eyes and ears
[02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:45.880]  Yes, for them God is dead, Satan lives
[02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:51.880]  These are fallen Satanists, Pope Francis is a perfectly possessed person
[02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:59.880]  He is basically controlled by a demon and every time the camera goes slightly offset and you basically catch him off guard
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:04.880]  Maybe doing a photo, you can see the demon in his eyes
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:12.880]  Pope Francis is possessed, this means that the Catholic Church is literally the biggest church of Satan
[02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:17.880]  You said the Catholic Church has become the seat of Satan
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:25.880]  Yes, and then of course they endorse the satanic temple in the US that can be pro-abortion, abortions and of course they need...
[02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:32.880]  And by the way, Leo, as you said, make no mistake, you have Governor of Virginia saying we kill babies after they're born
[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:36.880]  You have New York celebrating and cackling like witches
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:41.880]  This is all lesser magic, as they call it, in our face celebrating the killing
[02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:50.880]  It's Moloch all over again, they need the soul of these infants, they can do it with abortion, they can do it with rituals
[02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:57.880]  Exactly, so what does the souls, what does oppressing children give them? Why are they so oppressed with the innocent?
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:38:03.880]  Because they are offering them to the gods, so the gods then intergive them power
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:11.880]  So they are enslaved by these demons, by these alien demons, because they have to sacrifice if they want to maintain this power
[02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:13.880]  We have to stop these guys...
[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:17.880]  Just like the Babylonians, just like the Aztecs, just like the Druids
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:23.880]  Why do groups get in control that just demand more dead children? It's just something gets controlled and demands dead kids
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:26.880]  Why would humans want to kill their own children? We wouldn't
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:32.880]  Alex, they do it for power, these are not, you know, these are people who stop in front of nothing
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:39.880]  500 years ago, Katerina de Medici sacrificed a child celebrating the first black mass in Paris
[02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:46.880]  that became the worldwide capital of Satanism, because her own son was here and then she had other problems
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:54.880]  So okay, she celebrated with a Catholic priest because the real black mass can only be celebrated by a Catholic priest
[02:38:54.880 --> 02:39:00.880]  People don't understand this, but even Alistair Crowley said it, even Antoine Levé, if you want the argument
[02:39:00.880 --> 02:39:06.880]  They have to have the blasphemy of it done in the church by a priest, that is the perfect inversion
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:16.880]  Of course, because if you are not a holy person, if you have not been blessed with the lineage of Saint Peter and of Jesus
[02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:19.880]  then you're just a normal person, you're normal folk, you know?
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:25.880]  That's why today is very important for them to save Mechariq from being completely defrocked
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:31.880]  because he celebrates satanic masses, the moment they defrock him, Mechariq can't celebrate them anymore
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:37.880]  So they are Mechariq, maybe your career as a Satanist is finished altogether
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:40.880]  Who knows, this is what is happening in the land
[02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:44.880]  We're going to have you back up soon and Stuart Roosevelt, he's got huge news coming up next segment
[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:52.880]  Then we've got other big guests today, but I see the Satanists are on the offense, but they also seem very scared right now
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:56.880]  Do you agree with that A and B? Why are they so scared?
[02:39:56.880 --> 02:40:04.880]  They're scared because of course we are finally seeing them clearly, clearly and more clearly because they can't hurt themselves
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:15.880]  In Italy there was a festival called Sarremo Festival, they even had the courage of saying five times Satan in a kind of, it was supposed to be a comedy sketch
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:26.880]  And instead at one point they said satana, satana, satana, satana and it's now all over the news, even the Vatican had to criticize this festival of Sarremo for invoking Satan
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:33.880]  I mean in Italy when invoking Satan on public TV, this is crazy, this is insane Alex
[02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:38.880]  Well we had the head of the U say Satan rejects you, breaks it
[02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:48.880]  We go to pro-live events and people show up and say we love Satan, it's so crazy, Leo Zagami, LeoZagami.com, great job, we'll talk to you soon my friend

[02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:02.880]  We're going to go to break, we're going to come back with Stuart Rhodes, I just want to remind listeners ladies and gentlemen that
[02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:10.880]  Hey I don't complain about it, but this is a real war, this isn't like your average show, like oh we're the cutting edge, oh the tip of the spear, oh support us
[02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:16.880]  We are in absolute contention in war with the globalists
[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:21.880]  We are taking them on at point length range and

[02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:18.880]  Hell the media demonized that, oh he sells protein bars now, that's not allowed

[02:43:54.880 --> 02:43:59.880]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship
[02:43:59.880 --> 02:44:07.880]  And I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed
[02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:17.880]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant, leftist authoritarians, like the young turds and others
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:20.880]  Get so butt-hurt when Trump won
[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:26.880]  They don't want us to have that victory, they don't want us to remember what political action did
[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:30.880]  And that's why the globalist, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:37.880]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away
[02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:39.880]  This country is in a war
[02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:44.880]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos

[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:21.880]  Live from Austin, Texas Broadcasting Worldwide
[02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:25.880]  It's Alex Jones
[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:31.880]  You know, Michael Moore looks like a big fat degenerate
[02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:37.880]  Beyond a pedophile, he looks like Hansel and Gretel which would eat kids, I'm not saying he does
[02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:47.880]  And people like, so those other hoes, Ryan Stelter, I mean they just look like a creepy dishonorable son of a bitch
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:53.880]  And their actions prove that, but look at this photo, you're a TV viewer, radio listeners all describe it
[02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:59.880]  Cortez living in luxury Navy Yard apartment building and every photo, every video, every frame
[02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:06.880]  She's like this crazed mindless 60 IQ vessel
[02:48:06.880 --> 02:48:12.880]  So when Trump says we're going to stop child kidnapping and 3,000 women from sex slavery, she shakes her head
[02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:14.880]  So did Camilla Harris
[02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:17.880]  And you think, well that's an idiot, don't want to follow that, no
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:21.880]  She's triggering the losers
[02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:27.880]  And you look at that, there's nothing but a crazed method molly head lust for power
[02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:29.880]  Period
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:37.880]  Stewart Rhodes founder of Oathkeepers was down in South Texas, our crew was there as well and the Southern Poverty Law Center
[02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:43.880]  With billions, not just a half billion, before let's billions, offshore of this big foreign intelligence group
[02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:49.880]  They said you're racist as a veterans group because you own guns, you can't have guns, you're a good slave
[02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:54.880]  The founder of extremist arm militia had a front row seat at Trump's rally
[02:48:54.880 --> 02:49:00.880]  Stewart Rhodes is loaded up wherever you're at, tell us where you're at, I see you in a car about this latest demonization
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:06.880]  You know Cortez can have armed guards, Bito, Pato, I'm sorry, Bito or Rourke, he can have them
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:10.880]  But if you're armed yourself, well you're a bad person
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:17.880]  Well it was actually media matters and pretty clearly their whole point is to attack us
[02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:27.880]  And they say falsely claim that we are promoting white supremacist theories and talking points
[02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:34.880]  And really what they want to do is target us and pay us as white nationalists or white supremacists which we are not
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:35.880]  And then through that attack
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:39.880]  Just so you know Southern Poverty Law Center said stuff too but you're right on that front
[02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:42.880]  But at a certain point who cares what these criminals say
[02:49:42.880 --> 02:49:47.880]  Well we better care because if they say you're bad, you lose your bank account, you lose your website
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:50.880]  I mean you talk about Nazis, these people are criminal
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:55.880]  Well then also they're defaming us, I mean personally I'm very insulted by this
[02:49:55.880 --> 02:50:02.880]  My family on my mother's side, I'm a court of Mexican and my family on her side you know pick grapes and asparagus
[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:08.880]  Or migrant farm workers in California, I'm the furthest thing from a white nationalist or white supremacist
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:12.880]  So they have them smearly like this, it's definitely
[02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:16.880]  Well you're right Stuart, I'm interrupting because your skype's been breaking up when it comes back
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:17.880]  We'll go back to you
[02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:25.880]  So what do you make of this where this lordly group with all this money offshore says you're a bad person and then you're unperson
[02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:27.880]  What do we do to this group legally or lawfully?
[02:50:27.880 --> 02:50:29.880]  I think Trump should take action, this is clear
[02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:38.880]  You're a constitutional lawyer, you're a Yale graduated guy, as a lawyer this is cut and dry I think
[02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:44.880]  Well we need to sue him and this is what we should be doing, same thing the Covington Catholic kids do
[02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:50.880]  And the same thing that was done by the moderate Muslim activists in
[02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:54.880]  And again, the beauties of skype are amazing
[02:50:54.880 --> 02:50:59.880]  If you're a radio listener you're like why does Jones keep interrupting Stuart, go to camera, side of camera please
[02:50:59.880 --> 02:51:04.880]  Stuart, skype is locking up so every time the skype locks up I pop back in
[02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:07.880]  You were saying same with the Covington kids, go ahead
[02:51:09.880 --> 02:51:13.880]  Yes, I mean the answer is to sue them, that's what we need to start doing
[02:51:13.880 --> 02:51:19.880]  All of us that are on the political right, the only attack the left has against us is a false accusation
[02:51:19.880 --> 02:51:24.880]  That if you're a patriot, if you advocate for enforcing our laws and securing our borders
[02:51:24.880 --> 02:51:27.880]  That you are a racist or must be a racist
[02:51:27.880 --> 02:51:32.880]  You know that stadium was filled, at least about a quarter of the people there were brown
[02:51:35.880 --> 02:51:38.880]  Now the skype breaks up and that's what panics the left
[02:51:38.880 --> 02:51:44.880]  Is that the biggest victory was saying Tea Party's all racist but now is minorities come to these events Stuart
[02:51:44.880 --> 02:51:49.880]  It's really freaking them out that like oh my god, everybody loves each other here, we just love America
[02:51:52.880 --> 02:51:58.880]  Exactly, in complete solidarity, ironically, unlike the left, you know, we don't care about skin color
[02:51:58.880 --> 02:52:06.880]  Yesterday I was down in Eagle Pass, I was giving a tour by a local who was just a Marine Corps American veteran
[02:52:06.880 --> 02:52:10.880]  He's as brown as can be and yet he's a brother patriot and a brother veteran
[02:52:10.880 --> 02:52:17.880]  So it's very offensive to all of us in Oathkeepers to have them insinuate that we care a damn about racial background or cut
[02:52:17.880 --> 02:52:22.880]  We care about ideology, so while your skype breaks up if you can hear me Stuart Rose, founder of Oathkeepers.org
[02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:24.880]  Let me ask you this question, Stuart
[02:52:24.880 --> 02:52:30.880]  What are they going to do with even the skewed polls, Trump rises to 55, 56, 57%
[02:52:30.880 --> 02:52:36.880]  With all their attacks that's not working, him letting blacks out of prison for longer sentences
[02:52:36.880 --> 02:52:41.880]  Trump cutting taxes on poor people, raising them on actually middle class and rich
[02:52:41.880 --> 02:52:43.880]  That's pretty damn classical liberal actually
[02:52:43.880 --> 02:52:46.880]  It's kind of JFK, it's like JFK's president part two
[02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:52.880]  And as Trump tries to end these wars, how are they going to deal with the fact the public sees through it?
[02:52:56.880 --> 02:53:02.880]  They're going to have a hard time because he is actually carrying out real social justice
[02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:09.880]  They always like to talk about being social justice warriors, well like you said, he's bringing jobs back, he's employing people
[02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:14.880]  He's letting all kinds of people out of prison but predominantly blacks and minorities who get slammed through the legal system
[02:53:14.880 --> 02:53:17.880]  And that is a travesty, but he's the one who's freeing them
[02:53:17.880 --> 02:53:25.880]  And I think you should go one step further and he should advocate for legalization of marijuana and let all of the nonviolent drug of...
[02:53:28.880 --> 02:53:30.880]  He should start being social justice, but keep winning
[02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:34.880]  That's right, well Stuart, I'm told you're going to be in Austin the next few days
[02:53:34.880 --> 02:53:39.880]  It's Wednesday now, but Thursday, Friday you're welcome in studio, so we're not doing this over the Skype, okay?
[02:53:44.880 --> 02:53:47.880]  I'll take that as a 10-4
[02:53:47.880 --> 02:53:49.880]  Thank you, Stuart
[02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:52.880]  So many times when Skype's growing up, listeners are like, stop interrupting
[02:53:52.880 --> 02:53:57.880]  And when it freezes, they don't talk for two seconds, I take over and then it's backed up
[02:53:57.880 --> 02:54:00.880]  And they hear me five seconds later and they're talking over me
[02:54:00.880 --> 02:54:03.880]  And I'm not bitching, it's technology, it's technology
[02:54:03.880 --> 02:54:06.880]  And it's compression, it's better, it'll get better
[02:54:06.880 --> 02:54:09.880]  But it's like on a walkie-talkie, walkie-talkie is like almost lifetime, like record 1-9
[02:54:09.880 --> 02:54:13.880]  I'm driving down, so it's got a smoky on somebody's tail
[02:54:13.880 --> 02:54:17.880]  This is not like that, it's like, it gets compressed, so somebody can be 10 seconds behind
[02:54:17.880 --> 02:54:20.880]  And I'm just trying to talk to them, but listeners are like, why are you interrupting them?
[02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:23.880]  Because they're video freezes
[02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:27.880]  And I can't put out dead air
[02:54:27.880 --> 02:54:32.880]  I've gotten better about not erupting on Skype
[02:54:32.880 --> 02:54:34.880]  I've tried my best
[02:54:34.880 --> 02:54:39.880]  But yeah, it's media matters, that's where it saw us
[02:54:39.880 --> 02:54:44.880]  Southern Poverty Law Center's put them out too
[02:54:44.880 --> 02:54:51.880]  The founder of this extremist armed militia
[02:54:51.880 --> 02:54:56.880]  Had a front-row seat at the Trump rally
[02:54:56.880 --> 02:54:59.880]  Meanwhile, Stuart Rhodes is an army veteran
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:03.880]  Combat veteran, work for Ron Paul, is a constitutional lawyer
[02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:07.880]  Top of his class at Yale, won big awards at Yale, has no criminal record
[02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:10.880]  But see, they don't tell you like
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:14.880]  Top of his class Yale graduate army veteran is a militian person
[02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:18.880]  No, it's like, oh my god, there were these crazy white supremacists
[02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:23.880]  Running around with forked tails, foaming at their mouths
[02:55:23.880 --> 02:55:26.880]  And they don't tell you, Stuart Rhodes' mama is a Mexican
[02:55:26.880 --> 02:55:28.880]  It's all crap
[02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:33.880]  And the globalists are trying to collapse the country right now
[02:55:33.880 --> 02:55:36.880]  And it really just comes down to something that simple
[02:55:36.880 --> 02:55:39.880]  You know, I can sit here and talk about this all day
[02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:41.880]  And I can sit here and try to market things better
[02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:46.880]  And I can sit here and try to be even more compelling and whatever
[02:55:46.880 --> 02:55:51.880]  There are a bunch of cold-blooded rich people that think you're stupid
[02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:55.880]  And they think just join with the establishment, train everybody to be slaves
[02:55:55.880 --> 02:56:00.880]  Consolidate power, build a world government, take the advanced technology for ourselves
[02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:04.880]  Because everybody can't get life extension and then kill everybody
[02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:08.880]  Well, that sounds like some recipe for doom to me
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:14.880]  It doesn't sound like some recipe for victory
[02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:18.880]  It doesn't sound like freedom to me
[02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:29.880]  I mean, mainstream news admits 4 out of 5 Vatican priests are gay
[02:56:29.880 --> 02:56:35.880]  So the once Christian church is now a bathhouse
[02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:37.880]  It's now a gay bar
[02:56:37.880 --> 02:56:40.880]  And listen, I'm not attacking gay bars
[02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:50.880]  I'm just saying, wow, what group has this desire to run every facet of our lives?
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:54.880]  Because I don't care if it's heterosexual or homosexual
[02:56:54.880 --> 02:56:59.880]  When you start trying to get kids pants down around their ankles
[02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:07.880]  That's when I start to go into Hulk mode or King Kong mode
[02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:12.880]  And so we've all in the West given the left so much acquiescence
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:15.880]  So much line, like a fish on the line
[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:19.880]  That we just let them run out and run out and run out
[02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:26.880]  And there's weird palaces in Rome with a bunch of pedophiles screwing kids
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:31.880]  And we're supposed to just well let them do that or they'll come after you
[02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:36.880]  There is a God in heaven, but this planet is infested by evil
[02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:40.880]  And it's time that the whole planet has a big giant exorcism
[02:57:40.880 --> 02:58:06.880]  We'll be right back with our number four, stay with us
[02:58:11.880 --> 02:58:15.880]  We have developed hands down from our research
[02:58:15.880 --> 02:58:21.880]  The most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world
[02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:24.880]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it
[02:58:24.880 --> 02:58:28.880]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:31.880]  Packets to mix with fruit juice or water, whatever you like
[02:58:31.880 --> 02:58:34.880]  Warning though, it's very very strong, it lasts 10 hours
[02:58:34.880 --> 02:58:36.880]  So take a half packet the first time you take it
[02:58:36.880 --> 02:58:41.880]  Because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive
[02:58:41.880 --> 02:59:07.880]  TurboForce and EnforceLive.com
[02:59:12.880 --> 02:59:15.880]  Happies can be an important part of your daily supplement routine
[02:59:15.880 --> 02:59:18.880]  With poor diet and the constant on and off of your work life
[02:59:18.880 --> 02:59:23.880]  It's more important than ever to support your body in the fight against stress
[02:59:23.880 --> 02:59:28.880]  With powerful ingredients combined to help support the mind and body

[03:00:11.880 --> 03:00:15.880]  Austin, Texas Broadcasting Worldwide
[03:00:15.880 --> 03:00:44.880]  Alex Jones
[03:00:44.880 --> 03:00:48.880]  Mike Adams is about to take over for this, you know, our naturalnews.com
[03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:51.880]  I tried to cover this yesterday when Gavin McGinnis was in
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:56.880]  And we cursorily went over it, but this is the main focus of what Mike's about to cover
[03:00:56.880 --> 03:01:02.880]  But imagine Apple, now that they banned us for having the number one app in news
[03:01:02.880 --> 03:01:06.880]  That's our punishment for being number one, their curation
[03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:10.880]  What's popular is banned, what the people want is banned
[03:01:10.880 --> 03:01:15.880]  Freedom is banned to say you can't talk about devil worship
[03:01:15.880 --> 03:01:22.880]  A bunch of things that Mike's going to list coming up
[03:01:22.880 --> 03:01:25.880]  It shows how weak they are actually
[03:01:25.880 --> 03:01:29.880]  But maybe we're weak, maybe we've put up with so much, we'll put up with anything
[03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:32.880]  Here's another article at naturalnews.com
[03:01:32.880 --> 03:01:35.880]  We're going to post infowars.com, you better believe it
[03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:41.880]  That's how Alexandria, Cortez's green new deal
[03:01:41.880 --> 03:01:44.880]  Will unleash a catastrophic food collapse
[03:01:44.880 --> 03:01:48.880]  And Venezuela's style of masturbation across America
[03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:53.880]  That's not alarmist, it's worse than that
[03:01:53.880 --> 03:01:56.880]  But then when you look at socialist and globalist
[03:01:56.880 --> 03:02:00.880]  And the weird crazed thing they're involved in
[03:02:00.880 --> 03:02:06.880]  You go, oh my god, this is a program literally to destroy the planet
[03:02:06.880 --> 03:02:10.880]  And when you look at that, I don't say this is an elitist
[03:02:10.880 --> 03:02:16.880]  When you look at that low IQ or e-hum Omar
[03:02:16.880 --> 03:02:19.880]  When you look at these people, you think, oh, you know, no, no
[03:02:19.880 --> 03:02:22.880]  These people are mindless morons
[03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:25.880]  But then that enters the equation
[03:02:25.880 --> 03:02:28.880]  Why then aren't intelligent people in charge helping everyone
[03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:32.880]  Because we're giving them complex arguments
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:35.880]  And oh, I'm not being elitist, this is just true
[03:02:35.880 --> 03:02:39.880]  We're dialed into stuff that's not on their plane
[03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:42.880]  But in Somalia, they don't let a woman even leave the house
[03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:47.880]  They sell bloom in the sex slaves, Cortez, I mean, she's
[03:02:47.880 --> 03:02:50.880]  These people are monsters
[03:02:50.880 --> 03:02:52.880]  And Mike Adams of naturalnews.com
[03:02:52.880 --> 03:02:56.880]  They use our open free society against us
[03:02:56.880 --> 03:03:00.880]  What do we do when faced with a cancer like this?
[03:03:00.880 --> 03:03:04.880]  Well, first of all, we continue to publish the truth
[03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:07.880]  We don't back down, we don't compromise, that's number one
[03:03:07.880 --> 03:03:10.880]  But we also have to expose the dangers to our democracy
[03:03:10.880 --> 03:03:15.880]  Of the censorship that's being systematically rolled out by the tech giants
[03:03:15.880 --> 03:03:21.880]  And we have to urge the president to understand that if we do not halt this censorship
[03:03:21.880 --> 03:03:25.880]  And allow public debate, then our democracy, it's over
[03:03:25.880 --> 03:03:31.880]  And Trump will not win the 2020 election if this level of censorship continues
[03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:36.880]  The very pillar of democracy and voting depends on people being able to debate
[03:03:36.880 --> 03:03:39.880]  It depends on being able to hear ideas that you don't agree with
[03:03:39.880 --> 03:03:42.880]  Sure, exactly, whoever censoring is the tyrant
[03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:46.880]  So we come back and ask the question now
[03:03:46.880 --> 03:03:49.880]  It's a paradox, I like a lot of what Trump's doing
[03:03:49.880 --> 03:03:51.880]  And I don't want to attack him, I get he's under attack
[03:03:51.880 --> 03:03:53.880]  But he won't listen if we don't attack
[03:03:53.880 --> 03:03:57.880]  He, by not going after the censorship, that's more important than the border right now
[03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:01.880]  Because if we don't have speech, we ain't got nothing
[03:04:01.880 --> 03:04:06.880]  Yeah, look, the radical left has built a wall around our minds
[03:04:06.880 --> 03:04:10.880]  And that wall is fully funded and nothing is allowed to get through that wall
[03:04:10.880 --> 03:04:12.880]  It's the social media content wall
[03:04:12.880 --> 03:04:14.880]  It's like China's wall
[03:04:14.880 --> 03:04:16.880]  It's the Great Wall of China
[03:04:16.880 --> 03:04:17.880]  Great firewall
[03:04:17.880 --> 03:04:19.880]  The Great Firewall, right
[03:04:19.880 --> 03:04:25.880]  So this, walls are being used by the tech giants to stop us from learning information
[03:04:25.880 --> 03:04:30.880]  And yet then they oppose the wall of physical invasion of America
[03:04:30.880 --> 03:04:35.880]  Because they want America to be invaded and overrun while the people are kept in the dark about the truth
[03:04:35.880 --> 03:04:39.880]  Well, that's what's incredible is that things are so epic, Mike Adams
[03:04:39.880 --> 03:04:44.880]  I don't even have words to describe it, I mean, things are so insane
[03:04:44.880 --> 03:04:46.880]  I just, it's all happening right now
[03:04:46.880 --> 03:04:48.880]  This is the big choice right now
[03:04:48.880 --> 03:04:51.880]  Because Mike Adams takes over in 60 seconds

[03:06:29.880 --> 03:06:32.880]  And ban cows and ban airplanes
[03:06:32.880 --> 03:06:35.880]  But there's an anti-human agenda at foot
[03:06:35.880 --> 03:06:42.880]  A deindustrialization program that shut down our planetary boost phase to the stars of beyond
[03:06:42.880 --> 03:06:46.880]  Mike Adams of naturalnews.com is about to take over

[03:09:08.880 --> 03:09:10.880]  And thanks for hosting, my friend
[03:09:10.880 --> 03:09:12.880]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex
[03:09:12.880 --> 03:09:16.880]  And by the way, you know, what you're doing with offering these various products
[03:09:16.880 --> 03:09:22.880]  You're really revolutionizing the entire business model of where people get the daily consumption products that they need
[03:09:22.880 --> 03:09:24.880]  You know, people do vote with their dollars
[03:09:24.880 --> 03:09:29.880]  And they go out every day to a grocery store or convenience store or a retailer like Walmart, for example
[03:09:29.880 --> 03:09:31.880]  And they buy things every day that they need
[03:09:31.880 --> 03:09:36.880]  Well, as you keep rolling out products and your team is doing such an amazing job of doing that
[03:09:36.880 --> 03:09:39.880]  You know, people are going to keep shifting to you
[03:09:39.880 --> 03:09:44.880]  And you know, your long-term strategy, it's obvious, this isn't insider information
[03:09:44.880 --> 03:09:47.880]  It's just to offer more and more products that people use every day
[03:09:47.880 --> 03:09:50.880]  And so people can vote for freedom and vote for liberty
[03:09:50.880 --> 03:09:53.880]  You know, I find it astonishing that they attack you for selling water filters
[03:09:53.880 --> 03:09:56.880]  I mean, who doesn't want clean water?
[03:09:56.880 --> 03:10:00.880]  And we know what's in the water, it's the pharmaceuticals, it's atrazine
[03:10:00.880 --> 03:10:03.880]  David Hogg says, I'm secretly promoting it
[03:10:03.880 --> 03:10:07.880]  No, I'm saying the water's poisonous, here's great filters
[03:10:07.880 --> 03:10:08.880]  Well, exactly
[03:10:08.880 --> 03:10:16.880]  I mean, the scientific literature which I review every day is filled with stories about the toxic chemicals that are in tap water
[03:10:16.880 --> 03:10:20.880]  Not just well water, but tap water, municipal water, it's filthy
[03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:23.880]  It's contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals
[03:10:23.880 --> 03:10:26.880]  Anybody drinking tap water is being brain poisoned
[03:10:26.880 --> 03:10:31.880]  And I'm wondering if these radical leftists and these gun control whack jobs
[03:10:31.880 --> 03:10:35.880]  If they are actually suffering serious clinical brain damage
[03:10:35.880 --> 03:10:39.880]  Because they aren't filtering their water because now they're opposed to clean water
[03:10:39.880 --> 03:10:42.880]  Because Alex Jones sells water filters
[03:10:42.880 --> 03:10:43.880]  It's astonishing
[03:10:43.880 --> 03:10:49.880]  I mean, they will do anything to spite Trump or anything to spite Alex Jones, right?
[03:10:49.880 --> 03:10:52.880]  Even if it means poisoning themselves or murdering their own babies
[03:10:52.880 --> 03:10:55.880]  In the case of, you know, opposing President Trump
[03:10:55.880 --> 03:10:57.880]  These leftists will do absolutely anything
[03:10:57.880 --> 03:11:00.880]  Well, that's like enclosing
[03:11:00.880 --> 03:11:04.880]  Trump wants to pull out of these wars, suddenly Democrats are pro-war
[03:11:04.880 --> 03:11:06.880]  Yeah, exactly
[03:11:06.880 --> 03:11:08.880]  Exactly, so the mask is coming off
[03:11:08.880 --> 03:11:12.880]  Democrats whom I have described as a death cult
[03:11:12.880 --> 03:11:19.880]  They are now pro-baby murder, pro-dirty water, pro-war and colonization
[03:11:19.880 --> 03:11:24.880]  They are anti-environment, they want to pollute the skies with the geo-engineering
[03:11:24.880 --> 03:11:26.880]  I mean, the list goes on and on, Alex
[03:11:26.880 --> 03:11:29.880]  It's so insane, it's so out of control
[03:11:29.880 --> 03:11:32.880]  And I don't mean this literally, this is a metaphor
[03:11:32.880 --> 03:11:36.880]  But if an alien-invading force were to try to come to Earth as a metaphor
[03:11:36.880 --> 03:11:40.880]  And destroy this planet, they would do exactly what the Democrats are doing
[03:11:40.880 --> 03:11:43.880]  It's that bad, it's beyond terrorism
[03:11:43.880 --> 03:11:45.880]  It's like planet destruction
[03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:48.880]  It's like Death Star level death cult
[03:11:48.880 --> 03:11:50.880]  This is what the Democrats have become
[03:11:50.880 --> 03:11:55.880]  And then you look at Democrats no matter what color they are, they look like mutated idiots
[03:11:55.880 --> 03:11:58.880]  They act in bumbling morons
[03:11:58.880 --> 03:12:03.880]  Like Alexandria Cortez literally is like a lobotomized weasel
[03:12:03.880 --> 03:12:05.880]  You know, and I'm going to get into that today
[03:12:05.880 --> 03:12:08.880]  Thanks for, I think your team just posted my story
[03:12:08.880 --> 03:12:14.880]  It's a detailed analysis of how the AOC Green New Deal would collapse the national food supply
[03:12:14.880 --> 03:12:18.880]  And lead to mass starvation, Venezuela-style mass starvation
[03:12:18.880 --> 03:12:22.880]  What I'm going to do in this hour, Alex, is go through the details
[03:12:22.880 --> 03:12:26.880]  The mathematical calculations, the agricultural use of fossil fuels
[03:12:26.880 --> 03:12:32.880]  And really explain, so people understand how the Green New Deal is a mass starvation
[03:12:32.880 --> 03:12:37.880]  Total societal collapse, a collapse of the GDP, a collapse of the food supply
[03:12:37.880 --> 03:12:40.880]  Venezuela-style authoritarian corruption
[03:12:40.880 --> 03:12:43.880]  Cracked down the end of food abundance in America
[03:12:43.880 --> 03:12:45.880]  So I'm going to go through that today
[03:12:45.880 --> 03:12:48.880]  I've also got news about the FBI now
[03:12:48.880 --> 03:12:54.880]  Looks like they have taken new action of talk to FFL dealers in America
[03:12:54.880 --> 03:13:00.880]  Where they are now gathering information that can be used for a gun confiscation master list
[03:13:00.880 --> 03:13:03.880]  And so I'm going to present that information
[03:13:03.880 --> 03:13:08.880]  Very interested to hear from some of your listeners there who may be FFL dealers themselves
[03:13:08.880 --> 03:13:11.880]  And see if they're also hearing the same information
[03:13:11.880 --> 03:13:15.880]  I also talk about, as you mentioned, Alex, the Apple censorship
[03:13:15.880 --> 03:13:19.880]  The threats that we have received directly from Apple
[03:13:19.880 --> 03:13:22.880]  Where they are now emailing us at naturalnews
[03:13:22.880 --> 03:13:28.880]  They're emailing us screenshots of collections of articles that they say we cannot publish
[03:13:28.880 --> 03:13:32.880]  Or they will ban our app from iPhones and Apple devices
[03:13:32.880 --> 03:13:39.880]  And it's a game that they're playing, they won't tell us what keywords that they don't want
[03:13:39.880 --> 03:13:44.880]  So what they do is they send us screenshots, collections of articles, and say, well, these are offensive
[03:13:44.880 --> 03:13:46.880]  You have to get rid of these
[03:13:46.880 --> 03:13:48.880]  And we've tried a couple iterations with them
[03:13:48.880 --> 03:13:53.880]  We would take certain words out of the search results and things, and we'd send them back
[03:13:53.880 --> 03:13:54.880]  Okay, check it out
[03:13:54.880 --> 03:13:58.880]  But imagine, in the digital era, you're a newspaper that will access to their platform
[03:13:58.880 --> 03:14:00.880]  They say, this isn't allowed
[03:14:00.880 --> 03:14:04.880]  They're lying to Congress saying, we're not censoring, here it all is
[03:14:04.880 --> 03:14:05.880]  Yeah, exactly
[03:14:05.880 --> 03:14:11.880]  One of the explanations from the Apple R&D person was astonishing
[03:14:11.880 --> 03:14:16.880]  We were asking them, wait a minute, what's the reasoning behind all of this?
[03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:23.880]  And they literally said that, well, we don't allow articles that are intended to promote disgust
[03:14:23.880 --> 03:14:28.880]  Disgust, D-I-S-G-U, you know, a disgusting
[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:33.880]  If you're disgusted by killing a newborn baby, or you're disgusted by Hitler, that's not allowed
[03:14:33.880 --> 03:14:37.880]  They want you all pacified, nothing but good news, go to sleep
[03:14:37.880 --> 03:14:38.880]  You got it
[03:14:38.880 --> 03:14:41.880]  So if you love abortion, you're okay
[03:14:41.880 --> 03:14:46.880]  If you say, well, abortion is the murder of a child that could live outside the womb
[03:14:46.880 --> 03:14:50.880]  This is a massacre, this is the disassembling of the limbs of a human child
[03:14:50.880 --> 03:14:53.880]  They'll say, well, that's disgusting, you can't say that
[03:14:53.880 --> 03:14:55.880]  Well, wait a second
[03:14:55.880 --> 03:14:59.880]  All your other approved channels are saying that Trump is an evil demon or whatever
[03:14:59.880 --> 03:15:02.880]  Isn't that intended to create disgust?
[03:15:02.880 --> 03:15:05.880]  You're saying is we can't raise the alarm
[03:15:05.880 --> 03:15:08.880]  The left could demonize families, health, everything
[03:15:08.880 --> 03:15:11.880]  Cell phones, you know, radiation, it's all good
[03:15:11.880 --> 03:15:16.880]  But if we say it's a problem, it's warning people, they're saying it's illegal
[03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:18.880]  So truth is hate speech
[03:15:18.880 --> 03:15:23.880]  A true clinical detailed analysis of abortion is now hate speech
[03:15:23.880 --> 03:15:27.880]  But murdering babies is love and acceptance and progressivism
[03:15:27.880 --> 03:15:30.880]  If you say there are only two genders, gender is binary
[03:15:30.880 --> 03:15:32.880]  Oh, that's hate speech
[03:15:32.880 --> 03:15:38.880]  Even though that's the truth of biology that has been evident since the beginning of mankind
[03:15:38.880 --> 03:15:42.880]  You know, but if you say that, you are an evil person now according to Apple
[03:15:42.880 --> 03:15:45.880]  It's an attack on reality and attack on free speech
[03:15:45.880 --> 03:15:48.880]  My cat takes over, naturalnews.com
[03:15:48.880 --> 03:15:50.880]  Straight ahead, this is the info war
[03:15:50.880 --> 03:16:14.880]  We are all in your hands for the links
[03:16:21.880 --> 03:16:28.880]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world
[03:16:28.880 --> 03:16:31.880]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars
[03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:37.880]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken
[03:16:37.880 --> 03:16:41.880]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire
[03:16:41.880 --> 03:16:44.880]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.880 --> 03:16:47.880]  The deep state began with World War I
[03:16:47.880 --> 03:16:52.880]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books
[03:16:52.880 --> 03:16:56.880]  Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse

[03:20:23.880 --> 03:20:29.880]  Alright welcome back Mike Adams, stepping in here as the guest host for the rest of this hour here on the Alex Jones Show
[03:20:29.880 --> 03:20:34.880]  I've got a detailed analysis to go over with you today about the Green New Deal
[03:20:34.880 --> 03:20:39.880]  And how it would lead to a catastrophic food collapse across America
[03:20:39.880 --> 03:20:43.880]  Mass starvation, Venezuela style mass starvation
[03:20:43.880 --> 03:20:50.880]  With accompanying economic collapse, the outbreaks of infectious disease, civil unrest, total chaos
[03:20:50.880 --> 03:20:55.880]  Total collapse across America, so this is the result that would happen
[03:20:55.880 --> 03:21:00.880]  If they ban fossil fuels and ban the combustion engine, and to understand this is very simple
[03:21:00.880 --> 03:21:04.880]  We can start with understanding how fossil fuels are used in food production
[03:21:04.880 --> 03:21:10.880]  So this story is up on Infowars.com, now there's a detailed infographic that's part of this story
[03:21:10.880 --> 03:21:13.880]  I encourage you to check out the infographic, feel free to share it
[03:21:13.880 --> 03:21:15.880]  But let's start with some basics
[03:21:15.880 --> 03:21:25.880]  Green energy, solar and wind power is effective at powering things that are connected to the grid, hardwired to the grid
[03:21:25.880 --> 03:21:32.880]  So you can augment the power grid with green energy if you're powering homes or businesses
[03:21:32.880 --> 03:21:38.880]  Because homes and businesses stand still, right? They don't run around the farm field
[03:21:38.880 --> 03:21:42.880]  They don't roll down the highway, except if you're moving a mobile home or something
[03:21:42.880 --> 03:21:46.880]  Almost all homes and businesses and commercial buildings are of course standing still
[03:21:46.880 --> 03:21:51.880]  So the grid is easy to connect to them, and it's easy to feed that grid with green energy
[03:21:51.880 --> 03:21:59.880]  But for mobile equipment, which is what's used in agriculture, tractors, harvesters, combines
[03:21:59.880 --> 03:22:08.880]  Big rigs that deliver fuel, food processing, equipment that's mobile, all these things cannot be powered by solar or wind
[03:22:08.880 --> 03:22:14.880]  It's a simple reason that batteries don't have the energy density that's necessary to power these devices
[03:22:14.880 --> 03:22:18.880]  We did some interesting math on this, you'll love this comparison
[03:22:18.880 --> 03:22:24.880]  A hundred horsepower tractor, just take a hundred horsepower tractor, which is not even that powerful of a tractor
[03:22:24.880 --> 03:22:27.880]  It's kind of a mid-sized tractor
[03:22:27.880 --> 03:22:37.880]  To power that tractor with a solar panel, you would have to attach to the top of that tractor 5,000 square feet of solar panels
[03:22:37.880 --> 03:22:40.880]  5,000 square feet
[03:22:40.880 --> 03:22:51.880]  We did the math on that, it's based on an average of 15 watts per square foot of solar PV panels
[03:22:51.880 --> 03:22:57.880]  So if you do that, if you do the math, then it's 70 feet by 70 feet square
[03:22:57.880 --> 03:23:05.880]  And that's how big of a massive solar array you would have to put on top of a tractor in order to power that tractor
[03:23:05.880 --> 03:23:10.880]  With the same energy as a 100 horsepower diesel engine
[03:23:10.880 --> 03:23:15.880]  Now of course, if you're a farmer, if you know anything about agriculture, you know you can't drive around with a tractor
[03:23:15.880 --> 03:23:21.880]  With a 70 foot wide and a 70 foot long solar panel attached to the top of it
[03:23:21.880 --> 03:23:24.880]  Why? Well, for one reason, it would tip over
[03:23:24.880 --> 03:23:30.880]  And for a second reason, you go on the slightest incline and it would also tip over, or from the wind
[03:23:30.880 --> 03:23:37.880]  You couldn't even get close to any tree or any obstacle that is, because you couldn't get within 35 or 40 feet of any obstacle
[03:23:37.880 --> 03:23:40.880]  Because you have this 70 foot wide solar panel
[03:23:40.880 --> 03:23:44.880]  But even worse, the panel couldn't really be tilted at the right angle
[03:23:44.880 --> 03:23:48.880]  So you could only farm in the summer, not the spring and not really the fall
[03:23:48.880 --> 03:23:55.880]  And you couldn't really farm in northern latitudes, because you don't have much sunlight and you can't run your tractor after dark
[03:23:55.880 --> 03:23:57.880]  Now think about this
[03:23:57.880 --> 03:24:07.880]  See, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks in fairy tales and delusions and crazy, you know, dreams and leprechauns and unicorns
[03:24:07.880 --> 03:24:10.880]  I'm talking to you in reality here
[03:24:10.880 --> 03:24:13.880]  I'm a food scientist, I run a food science lab
[03:24:13.880 --> 03:24:15.880]  We can do the math on this
[03:24:15.880 --> 03:24:19.880]  So I went to the, it's called the U.S. Energy Information Administration
[03:24:19.880 --> 03:24:23.880]  And we looked up the fossil fuel use in agriculture
[03:24:23.880 --> 03:24:31.880]  Turns out that there are 500 trillion BTUs of energy expended to grow food crops
[03:24:31.880 --> 03:24:33.880]  Not even counting livestock
[03:24:33.880 --> 03:24:36.880]  Just the food crops every year in America
[03:24:36.880 --> 03:24:39.880]  And those are numbers from I think 2012, so it's much larger
[03:24:39.880 --> 03:24:42.880]  Now, 500 trillion BTUs
[03:24:42.880 --> 03:24:44.880]  That comes from fossil fuels
[03:24:44.880 --> 03:24:46.880]  Because obviously you have to have all that equipment
[03:24:46.880 --> 03:24:48.880]  You have to have the transportation equipment
[03:24:48.880 --> 03:24:51.880]  You have to have, you know, the tractors and everything else I mentioned
[03:24:51.880 --> 03:24:58.880]  Livestock production requires another 300 trillion BTUs of fossil fuel energy
[03:24:58.880 --> 03:25:02.880]  Now, I mean, most of it is fossil fuels
[03:25:02.880 --> 03:25:07.880]  A small part of that is electricity but almost all of it is fossil fuels
[03:25:07.880 --> 03:25:13.880]  Because fossil fuels, again, power things that are not connected to the grid
[03:25:13.880 --> 03:25:18.880]  Now how are you going to replace that with green energy
[03:25:18.880 --> 03:25:23.880]  Because Ocasio-Cortez wants to say that no more fossil fuels in 10 years
[03:25:23.880 --> 03:25:26.880]  And by the way, that means no more combustion engines
[03:25:26.880 --> 03:25:29.880]  So here's a question for sensible people
[03:25:29.880 --> 03:25:34.880]  How are you going to sail ships that carry containers across the ocean
[03:25:34.880 --> 03:25:38.880]  Without combustion engines and ship fuel?
[03:25:38.880 --> 03:25:41.880]  Does she want us to go back to wooden ships with sails?
[03:25:41.880 --> 03:25:46.880]  Is the Green New Deal really basically, should we just call it the 1700s?
[03:25:46.880 --> 03:25:50.880]  Again, let's relive the 1700s because that's what she wants
[03:25:50.880 --> 03:25:52.880]  Wooden ships with sails
[03:25:52.880 --> 03:25:56.880]  But, you know, it's insane
[03:25:56.880 --> 03:25:59.880]  You don't even have commercial jets under this scenario either
[03:25:59.880 --> 03:26:02.880]  So how are you going to fly food, you know, seafood that's flown in
[03:26:02.880 --> 03:26:04.880]  How are you going to fly that?
[03:26:04.880 --> 03:26:08.880]  How are you going to produce any food at all without combustion engines?
[03:26:08.880 --> 03:26:11.880]  And the answer is, you can't
[03:26:11.880 --> 03:26:17.880]  No ships, no planes, no tractors, no long-haul rigs on the highways
[03:26:17.880 --> 03:26:20.880]  I know they're experimenting with some battery-powered trucks
[03:26:20.880 --> 03:26:22.880]  But their range is almost nothing
[03:26:22.880 --> 03:26:25.880]  And they're not in mass production, not even close
[03:26:25.880 --> 03:26:30.880]  And you can never have enough battery energy density in tractors and agricultural equipment
[03:26:30.880 --> 03:26:32.880]  Because the energy density is just not there
[03:26:32.880 --> 03:26:37.880]  Unless you have a quantum leap in battery technology, you can't do that
[03:26:37.880 --> 03:26:43.880]  So food production, by my estimates, would plummet as much as 80%
[03:26:43.880 --> 03:26:49.880]  In the United States, within 12 months after the Green New Deal goes into effect
[03:26:49.880 --> 03:26:55.880]  If you ban combustion engines, you cause a near-total collapse of food production in America
[03:26:55.880 --> 03:27:01.880]  Even worse, you can't even import food from China or South America
[03:27:01.880 --> 03:27:05.880]  A lot of food comes from South America, especially during the winter months in America
[03:27:05.880 --> 03:27:07.880]  How does that get here?
[03:27:07.880 --> 03:27:13.880]  By expending fossil fuels for diesel trucks or ships to bring that food to us
[03:27:13.880 --> 03:27:17.880]  But according to Ocasio-Cortez, you can't use combustion engines
[03:27:17.880 --> 03:27:24.880]  Would she also ban food imports that rely on the use of fossil fuels to power those ships and trucks and planes?
[03:27:24.880 --> 03:27:30.880]  Or is Ocasio-Cortez's idea that only America would ban combustion engines
[03:27:30.880 --> 03:27:33.880]  But all the other countries in the world can continue to use them
[03:27:33.880 --> 03:27:35.880]  Because trust me, they would
[03:27:35.880 --> 03:27:38.880]  China is not stupid enough to ban combustion engines
[03:27:38.880 --> 03:27:41.880]  Russia is not stupid enough to ban combustion engines
[03:27:41.880 --> 03:27:45.880]  And by the way, does Ocasio-Cortez's ban, does it also include the military?
[03:27:45.880 --> 03:27:55.880]  Would she say that the military will not be allowed to operate tanks, planes, transport trucks, armored personnel carriers, logistics deliveries
[03:27:55.880 --> 03:27:58.880]  All fuel depots should be shut down?
[03:27:58.880 --> 03:27:59.880]  Is this her plan?
[03:27:59.880 --> 03:28:02.880]  Because it's a plan of lunacy
[03:28:02.880 --> 03:28:06.880]  These are idiotic, moronic ideas from the radical left
[03:28:06.880 --> 03:28:08.880]  They are beyond stupid
[03:28:08.880 --> 03:28:11.880]  They show a level of economic illiteracy
[03:28:11.880 --> 03:28:13.880]  That is astonishing
[03:28:13.880 --> 03:28:14.880]  It is stunning
[03:28:14.880 --> 03:28:18.880]  And it really underscores the need for basic IQ testing from members of Congress
[03:28:18.880 --> 03:28:21.880]  If you don't IQ test these people from now on
[03:28:21.880 --> 03:28:25.880]  How do you make sure you don't get another Ocasio-Cortez in the mix?
[03:28:25.880 --> 03:28:27.880]  She wants to destroy America
[03:28:27.880 --> 03:28:28.880]  She's got a plan to do it
[03:28:28.880 --> 03:28:31.880]  And other Democrats have signed on to that plan
[03:28:31.880 --> 03:28:33.880]  They are a death cult
[03:28:33.880 --> 03:28:40.880]  And they will not stop until they absolutely gut this country and bring down an apocalyptic collapse upon us
[03:28:40.880 --> 03:28:43.880]  And this is more straight ahead, that's not the end of this story
[03:28:43.880 --> 03:28:46.880]  Stay with us here on The Alex Jones Show, this is Mike Adams filling in

[03:30:59.880 --> 03:31:01.880]  There is no un-continuum
[03:31:01.880 --> 03:31:03.880]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future

[03:31:10.880 --> 03:31:13.880]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases
[03:31:13.880 --> 03:31:16.880]  And God knows what are going to look back and say
[03:31:16.880 --> 03:31:18.880]  We struggled here, we made it
[03:31:18.880 --> 03:31:20.880]  And that's really where this goes
[03:31:20.880 --> 03:31:22.880]  God's got a big war for you, Reddy
[03:31:22.880 --> 03:31:24.880]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton
[03:31:24.880 --> 03:31:26.880]  And Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong
[03:31:26.880 --> 03:31:29.880]  Are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[03:31:29.880 --> 03:31:31.880]  Because God wants warriors that are smart
[03:31:31.880 --> 03:31:34.880]  And are ready to build things and are also ready to fight
[03:31:34.880 --> 03:31:36.880]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight
[03:31:36.880 --> 03:31:37.880]  Put on your back
[03:31:37.880 --> 03:31:39.880]  And I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future
[03:31:39.880 --> 03:31:42.880]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built
[03:31:42.880 --> 03:31:44.880]  I want to go to the next level
[03:31:44.880 --> 03:31:47.880]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced
[03:31:47.880 --> 03:31:49.880]  Not these devil worshipers, they're cold and failed
[03:31:49.880 --> 03:31:51.880]  And feels like being in a tomb
[03:31:51.880 --> 03:31:53.880]  I want life, I want Jesus
[03:31:53.880 --> 03:31:59.880]  Wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights
[03:31:59.880 --> 03:32:02.880]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest
[03:32:02.880 --> 03:32:05.880]  And who's ready to do the damage
[03:32:05.880 --> 03:32:07.880]  We took on Hillary Clinton
[03:32:07.880 --> 03:32:09.880]  We stopped her, we got a national stand
[03:32:09.880 --> 03:32:12.880]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now
[03:32:12.880 --> 03:32:14.880]  We are winning
[03:32:14.880 --> 03:32:16.880]  But those of us who are at the very front line
[03:32:16.880 --> 03:32:19.880]  At the tip of the spear are under unprecedented attack
[03:32:19.880 --> 03:32:21.880]  So I come to you each day
[03:32:21.880 --> 03:32:24.880]  And try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition
[03:32:24.880 --> 03:32:26.880]  This is about who wants it most
[03:32:26.880 --> 03:32:29.880]  And you know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors
[03:32:29.880 --> 03:32:30.880]  They've taken everything
[03:32:30.880 --> 03:32:32.880]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands
[03:32:32.880 --> 03:32:34.880]  I need financial support and I got products
[03:32:34.880 --> 03:32:36.880]  You and your family need
[03:32:36.880 --> 03:32:38.880]  It's very simple, thousands of great products
[03:32:38.880 --> 03:32:40.880]  Whatever is award winning, whatever is best selling
[03:32:40.880 --> 03:32:42.880]  What folks love, what I love
[03:32:42.880 --> 03:32:44.880]  We bring it to you at m4shore.com
[03:32:44.880 --> 03:32:47.880]  So please go to m4shore.com today
[03:32:47.880 --> 03:32:49.880]  Look at all the great products
[03:32:49.880 --> 03:32:51.880]  Because we're in your hands, I'm in your hands
[03:32:51.880 --> 03:33:17.880]  And your support is beyond critical, thank you
[03:33:17.880 --> 03:33:20.880]  One thing that we know about Democrats
[03:33:20.880 --> 03:33:22.880]  Is not only are they economically illiterate
[03:33:22.880 --> 03:33:24.880]  And scientifically illiterate
[03:33:24.880 --> 03:33:26.880]  They're also illiterate about history
[03:33:26.880 --> 03:33:28.880]  They never study history
[03:33:28.880 --> 03:33:30.880]  That's not even taught in the liberal schools anymore
[03:33:30.880 --> 03:33:34.880]  They just teach social justice, victimhood, cry bully behavior
[03:33:34.880 --> 03:33:36.880]  And so when you look at this green new deal
[03:33:36.880 --> 03:33:38.880]  From Ocasio-Cortez
[03:33:38.880 --> 03:33:41.880]  You understand that she has no knowledge
[03:33:41.880 --> 03:33:45.880]  Of history and the rise of food production
[03:33:45.880 --> 03:33:47.880]  And agricultural mechanization
[03:33:47.880 --> 03:33:49.880]  I'm going to cover that just briefly here
[03:33:49.880 --> 03:33:51.880]  Let's take a little history journey together
[03:33:51.880 --> 03:33:54.880]  If you go back to the 1700s and earlier
[03:33:54.880 --> 03:33:59.880]  Much of the world was based on an agrarian society
[03:33:59.880 --> 03:34:01.880]  An agrarian structure where a very high percentage
[03:34:01.880 --> 03:34:04.880]  Of the population was engaged in food production
[03:34:04.880 --> 03:34:06.880]  Because food production was not automated
[03:34:06.880 --> 03:34:10.880]  There were not fossil fuel powered combustion engines
[03:34:10.880 --> 03:34:13.880]  They had early steam tractors and things like that
[03:34:13.880 --> 03:34:15.880]  In the 1800s, some experimental tractors
[03:34:15.880 --> 03:34:19.880]  But most of the power there was animal power, horsepower
[03:34:19.880 --> 03:34:21.880]  And oxen
[03:34:21.880 --> 03:34:23.880]  When I was in Peru a few years ago
[03:34:23.880 --> 03:34:26.880]  I actually got to see people planting potatoes
[03:34:26.880 --> 03:34:30.880]  At high altitude just by having these incredible beasts
[03:34:30.880 --> 03:34:34.880]  These ox pulling wooden plows
[03:34:34.880 --> 03:34:36.880]  And that's a hard way to grow food
[03:34:36.880 --> 03:34:38.880]  There's nothing easy about that
[03:34:38.880 --> 03:34:40.880]  And because it's difficult to grow food
[03:34:40.880 --> 03:34:44.880]  In an agrarian non-mechanized kind of society
[03:34:44.880 --> 03:34:46.880]  You don't have enough abundant food
[03:34:46.880 --> 03:34:49.880]  For a population explosion to occur
[03:34:49.880 --> 03:34:53.880]  This is why there was no population explosion on Earth
[03:34:53.880 --> 03:34:57.880]  From AD year one
[03:34:57.880 --> 03:35:01.880]  All the way up to frankly about the mid 1700s
[03:35:01.880 --> 03:35:03.880]  Or late 1700s
[03:35:03.880 --> 03:35:05.880]  The real explosion has only taken place
[03:35:05.880 --> 03:35:08.880]  In the last 100 plus years
[03:35:08.880 --> 03:35:09.880]  A little bit more than 100 years
[03:35:09.880 --> 03:35:12.880]  Because of the mechanization of food production
[03:35:12.880 --> 03:35:16.880]  And so as combustion engines came into play
[03:35:16.880 --> 03:35:19.880]  With tractors in the early part of the 20th century
[03:35:19.880 --> 03:35:21.880]  Especially where they really started to catch on
[03:35:21.880 --> 03:35:25.880]  And you had farming become more and more efficient
[03:35:25.880 --> 03:35:28.880]  Where instead of one person as in the 1700s
[03:35:28.880 --> 03:35:32.880]  One person could maybe produce food for two or three people
[03:35:32.880 --> 03:35:34.880]  So you could literally have half of society
[03:35:34.880 --> 03:35:36.880]  Involved in food production
[03:35:36.880 --> 03:35:38.880]  Well now because of the mass mechanization
[03:35:38.880 --> 03:35:40.880]  And automation of agriculture
[03:35:40.880 --> 03:35:43.880]  You only have maybe one farmer out of 100 people
[03:35:43.880 --> 03:35:47.880]  So one farmer can feed the other 99 out of 100 people
[03:35:47.880 --> 03:35:51.880]  Because you have this magnification of your time
[03:35:51.880 --> 03:35:53.880]  And your effort
[03:35:53.880 --> 03:35:56.880]  Because diesel fuel and fossil fuels contain energy
[03:35:56.880 --> 03:36:00.880]  Obviously and this energy replaces horses
[03:36:00.880 --> 03:36:02.880]  Which is why we still use the term horse power
[03:36:02.880 --> 03:36:04.880]  By the way I mean a lot of millennials don't even know
[03:36:04.880 --> 03:36:05.880]  Why we have that term
[03:36:05.880 --> 03:36:07.880]  Because the power used to be horses
[03:36:07.880 --> 03:36:10.880]  Even grinding and milling grains was done by horses
[03:36:10.880 --> 03:36:14.880]  Or mules that would pull a grinding wheel
[03:36:14.880 --> 03:36:17.880]  A large operation in a circle
[03:36:17.880 --> 03:36:21.880]  To put that energy into the grinding or milling operation
[03:36:21.880 --> 03:36:24.880]  A lot of people don't even realize the history of food production
[03:36:24.880 --> 03:36:26.880]  But the short version here is
[03:36:26.880 --> 03:36:28.880]  It's only because of fossil fuels now that we can produce
[03:36:28.880 --> 03:36:30.880]  Massive amounts of food
[03:36:30.880 --> 03:36:32.880]  And that led to the population explosion
[03:36:32.880 --> 03:36:35.880]  That has taken place over the last 100 years
[03:36:35.880 --> 03:36:39.880]  So the only reason that we have this high number of people
[03:36:39.880 --> 03:36:42.880]  On the planet currently and continuing to grow
[03:36:42.880 --> 03:36:45.880]  Is because of the very same combustion engines
[03:36:45.880 --> 03:36:48.880]  That Ocasio-Cortez wants to outlaw
[03:36:48.880 --> 03:36:50.880]  She wants to ban them
[03:36:50.880 --> 03:36:54.880]  The result would be a collapse of modern society
[03:36:54.880 --> 03:36:56.880]  Back to the 1700s
[03:36:56.880 --> 03:37:01.880]  In that scenario you would see massive widespread starvation
[03:37:01.880 --> 03:37:04.880]  A catastrophic collapse of the food supply
[03:37:04.880 --> 03:37:07.880]  And all the disease and societal collapse
[03:37:07.880 --> 03:37:10.880]  And social unrest, lawlessness, political collapse
[03:37:10.880 --> 03:37:13.880]  The United States of America would collapse
[03:37:13.880 --> 03:37:16.880]  And it would make America vulnerable to invasion by other countries
[03:37:16.880 --> 03:37:18.880]  Here's another note
[03:37:18.880 --> 03:37:20.880]  You notice that even with the climate taxes
[03:37:20.880 --> 03:37:22.880]  And the climate change pushers
[03:37:22.880 --> 03:37:25.880]  They always want to say, well America should lead the way
[03:37:25.880 --> 03:37:29.880]  So let's crack down on CO2 emissions for America only
[03:37:29.880 --> 03:37:31.880]  Let's tax America
[03:37:31.880 --> 03:37:33.880]  Let's block America's industry
[03:37:33.880 --> 03:37:36.880]  These laws never apply to China or India
[03:37:36.880 --> 03:37:39.880]  Where the vast amount of pollution is actually taking place
[03:37:39.880 --> 03:37:43.880]  I mean China pollutes far more than the United States now
[03:37:43.880 --> 03:37:46.880]  In terms of the quality and quantity of its toxins
[03:37:46.880 --> 03:37:48.880]  That it's releasing into the atmosphere
[03:37:48.880 --> 03:37:50.880]  And India as well
[03:37:50.880 --> 03:37:53.880]  Well think about this green new deal from AOC
[03:37:53.880 --> 03:37:56.880]  This is also something to apply only to America
[03:37:56.880 --> 03:37:59.880]  Ocasio-Cortez wants to cripple America only
[03:37:59.880 --> 03:38:02.880]  To make America non-competitive
[03:38:02.880 --> 03:38:05.880]  To crush America's GDP
[03:38:05.880 --> 03:38:09.880]  To decimate America's farming and agricultural operations
[03:38:09.880 --> 03:38:11.880]  To eliminate the food supply
[03:38:11.880 --> 03:38:13.880]  To starve the population
[03:38:13.880 --> 03:38:17.880]  But she would not demand banning combustion engines in China
[03:38:17.880 --> 03:38:19.880]  Or Mexico, for that matter
[03:38:19.880 --> 03:38:21.880]  Or any other country in the world
[03:38:21.880 --> 03:38:25.880]  So this is yet again targeting America for specific destruction
[03:38:25.880 --> 03:38:27.880]  Essentially, if I were to summarize this
[03:38:27.880 --> 03:38:29.880]  I would say that the green new deal
[03:38:29.880 --> 03:38:33.880]  Is the blueprint of a massive Democrat-led act of
[03:38:33.880 --> 03:38:37.880]  Economic terrorism against the United States of America
[03:38:37.880 --> 03:38:42.880]  It is economic terrorism being led by a death cult
[03:38:42.880 --> 03:38:44.880]  That we call Democrats
[03:38:44.880 --> 03:38:46.880]  They are a death cult
[03:38:46.880 --> 03:38:48.880]  Now, Cory Booker today
[03:38:48.880 --> 03:38:50.880]  I believe this was today, maybe it was yesterday
[03:38:50.880 --> 03:38:54.880]  He said that we cannot support livestock anymore on this planet
[03:38:54.880 --> 03:38:59.880]  Once again, showing Cory Booker's incredible ignorance about agriculture
[03:38:59.880 --> 03:39:01.880]  I live in Texas
[03:39:01.880 --> 03:39:04.880]  And we see a lot of cows all over the place
[03:39:04.880 --> 03:39:09.880]  And I take care of donkeys on my ranch as well
[03:39:09.880 --> 03:39:13.880]  And I have Nigerian dwarf goats and free-range chickens as well
[03:39:13.880 --> 03:39:15.880]  I harvest my own chicken eggs
[03:39:15.880 --> 03:39:18.880]  And we do a lot of things around animals
[03:39:18.880 --> 03:39:23.880]  Now, if you start to observe cattle and cattle operations
[03:39:23.880 --> 03:39:29.880]  You come to realize that, in fact, cows are one of the most efficient producers of food
[03:39:29.880 --> 03:39:31.880]  Requiring the fewest inputs
[03:39:31.880 --> 03:39:36.880]  Cows can turn horrible land into food
[03:39:36.880 --> 03:39:40.880]  Because cows, obviously, they will roam around on their own
[03:39:40.880 --> 03:39:43.880]  They will go out and find the weeds and find the grass
[03:39:43.880 --> 03:39:45.880]  They'll even go find their own water
[03:39:45.880 --> 03:39:47.880]  You've got to give them a tank to drink from
[03:39:47.880 --> 03:39:49.880]  But they'll make their way to that water
[03:39:49.880 --> 03:39:51.880]  And then they'll go back out and harvest more food
[03:39:51.880 --> 03:39:58.880]  Cows can turn land that is essentially useless into usable food
[03:39:58.880 --> 03:40:00.880]  And I'm talking about free-range cows here
[03:40:00.880 --> 03:40:03.880]  Not like CAFO cattle factory operations
[03:40:03.880 --> 03:40:09.880]  Which I oppose in principle because of the extreme dirtiness and cruelty of it
[03:40:09.880 --> 03:40:11.880]  But I'm talking about free-range cows
[03:40:11.880 --> 03:40:15.880]  Which are really, frankly, quite clean in what they're consuming
[03:40:15.880 --> 03:40:17.880]  And they're very, very efficient
[03:40:17.880 --> 03:40:22.880]  You can unleash cows in West Texas or parts of Nevada or Utah
[03:40:22.880 --> 03:40:26.880]  Or even parts of Arizona where you can't grow anything else
[03:40:26.880 --> 03:40:29.880]  You can't grow soybeans, you can't grow corn, you can't grow wheat
[03:40:29.880 --> 03:40:31.880]  Oats, nothing
[03:40:31.880 --> 03:40:35.880]  It's useless land for vegetable crops or fruit crops
[03:40:35.880 --> 03:40:37.880]  But you can unleash cows on that land
[03:40:37.880 --> 03:40:41.880]  And those cows will go out and gather the energy and create the food
[03:40:41.880 --> 03:40:45.880]  And that's why cows are actually one of the most, believe it or not
[03:40:45.880 --> 03:40:49.880]  Eco-friendly sources of food production
[03:40:49.880 --> 03:40:51.880]  That's why if you look at the statistics that I quoted
[03:40:51.880 --> 03:40:54.880]  What is it? The U.S. Energy Information Administration
[03:40:54.880 --> 03:40:58.880]  There are more BTUs of energy that go into vegetable production
[03:40:58.880 --> 03:41:01.880]  Than into livestock production
[03:41:01.880 --> 03:41:03.880]  That's not a mistake, it's not a typo
[03:41:03.880 --> 03:41:07.880]  It's because livestock, when they're handled in a more free-range way
[03:41:07.880 --> 03:41:09.880]  Or a more sustainable way
[03:41:09.880 --> 03:41:12.880]  Actually are very, very efficient converters
[03:41:12.880 --> 03:41:15.880]  Of land and sunlight energy through plants
[03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:18.880]  Into food supply for humans
[03:41:18.880 --> 03:41:20.880]  Cattle are sustainable
[03:41:20.880 --> 03:41:23.880]  And yet these toxic agricultural practices
[03:41:23.880 --> 03:41:25.880]  That are spraying glyphosate
[03:41:25.880 --> 03:41:28.880]  And spraying atrazine all over the vegetable crops
[03:41:28.880 --> 03:41:31.880]  And destroying the soils and causing massive erosion
[03:41:31.880 --> 03:41:33.880]  Those are not sustainable
[03:41:33.880 --> 03:41:35.880]  Cory Booker is exactly wrong
[03:41:35.880 --> 03:41:37.880]  It's the vegetable farming
[03:41:37.880 --> 03:41:41.880]  The crop farming in America that is poisoning the soils
[03:41:41.880 --> 03:41:44.880]  Destroying the microbes, eroding the soils
[03:41:44.880 --> 03:41:47.880]  While it's actually the cattle operations, the free-range ones
[03:41:47.880 --> 03:41:49.880]  That don't erode the soil
[03:41:49.880 --> 03:41:51.880]  That actually are sustainable
[03:41:51.880 --> 03:41:54.880]  And that require very, very few inputs to produce food
[03:41:54.880 --> 03:41:57.880]  So you see, once again, these people, these Democrats
[03:41:57.880 --> 03:41:59.880]  Have no understanding of agriculture
[03:41:59.880 --> 03:42:01.880]  They don't know how anything works
[03:42:01.880 --> 03:42:04.880]  They don't understand history, they don't understand science
[03:42:04.880 --> 03:42:06.880]  They don't understand energy density
[03:42:06.880 --> 03:42:08.880]  They think you can put batteries in everything
[03:42:08.880 --> 03:42:10.880]  And power the world with batteries
[03:42:10.880 --> 03:42:13.880]  And power tractors that you can use to produce food
[03:42:13.880 --> 03:42:16.880]  I mean, there are toy tractors for your children to ride
[03:42:16.880 --> 03:42:19.880]  They're toys, they don't produce the food supply for America
[03:42:19.880 --> 03:42:23.880]  Diesel engines produce the food supply for America
[03:42:23.880 --> 03:42:25.880]  And if you don't understand that, you know, I'm sorry
[03:42:25.880 --> 03:42:27.880]  But you need to get educated
[03:42:27.880 --> 03:42:30.880]  So once again, we need a basic IQ test
[03:42:30.880 --> 03:42:32.880]  For members of Congress
[03:42:32.880 --> 03:42:34.880]  It's the lack of intelligence
[03:42:34.880 --> 03:42:36.880]  How we get people like Cory Booker
[03:42:36.880 --> 03:42:39.880]  Or Ocasio-Cortez or others who are just
[03:42:39.880 --> 03:42:41.880]  Sorry, but they're completely illiterate
[03:42:41.880 --> 03:42:44.880]  When it comes to reality, they live in dream worlds
[03:42:44.880 --> 03:42:46.880]  We love more straight ahead
[03:42:46.880 --> 03:42:48.880]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones show
[03:42:48.880 --> 03:43:10.880]  We'll be right back
[03:43:19.880 --> 03:43:23.880]  We have developed hands down from our research
[03:43:23.880 --> 03:43:26.880]  The most powerful, healthy energy drink

[03:43:32.880 --> 03:43:34.880]  It is a total game changer
[03:43:34.880 --> 03:43:36.880]  And it comes in easy to use
[03:43:36.880 --> 03:43:38.880]  Packets to mix in with fruit juice or water

[03:43:39.880 --> 03:43:41.880]  Warning though, it's very, very strong
[03:43:41.880 --> 03:43:42.880]  It lasts 10 hours

[03:45:53.880 --> 03:45:54.880]  It's simple
[03:45:54.880 --> 03:45:55.880]  If you want to beat the globalist
[03:45:55.880 --> 03:45:57.880]  If you want to take on the new world order
[03:45:57.880 --> 03:45:59.880]  I'm not doing Bitcoin pumping dumps
[03:45:59.880 --> 03:46:00.880]  With Jack Dorsey
[03:46:00.880 --> 03:46:02.880]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures
[03:46:02.880 --> 03:46:04.880]  I'm not sitting here, you know
[03:46:04.880 --> 03:46:05.880]  Selling you late term abortion
[03:46:05.880 --> 03:46:06.880]  And all the great it is
[03:46:06.880 --> 03:46:07.880]  I just go out and say
[03:46:07.880 --> 03:46:09.880]  What is the top heart pill?
[03:46:09.880 --> 03:46:10.880]  What is the top tumor
[03:46:10.880 --> 03:46:11.880]  It's the best seller
[03:46:11.880 --> 03:46:13.880]  Because it's anti-inflammatory
[03:46:13.880 --> 03:46:15.880]  And what's the best lab in the country?
[03:46:15.880 --> 03:46:16.880]  Okay, they're the highest rated
[03:46:16.880 --> 03:46:18.880]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[03:46:18.880 --> 03:46:20.880]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product and bottle
[03:46:20.880 --> 03:46:22.880]  But that's still incredible, sir
[03:46:22.880 --> 03:46:24.880]  I'm like, what's the highest you could do
[03:46:24.880 --> 03:46:26.880]  Month later, 90, 95%
[03:46:26.880 --> 03:46:27.880]  No one's ever done it
[03:46:27.880 --> 03:46:28.880]  I said, how much does that cost for a bottle?
[03:46:28.880 --> 03:46:30.880]  That costs $10, no one's ever done that
[03:46:30.880 --> 03:46:32.880]  Sir, the average competitor's
[03:46:32.880 --> 03:46:33.880]  3 to 5%
[03:46:33.880 --> 03:46:34.880]  The top brand's 50%
[03:46:34.880 --> 03:46:36.880]  I'm like, we're going to have
[03:46:36.880 --> 03:46:37.880]  95% curcuminoid
[03:46:37.880 --> 03:46:38.880]  I mean, you understand
[03:46:38.880 --> 03:46:40.880]  Like our information's explosive
[03:46:40.880 --> 03:46:41.880]  Our fish oil
[03:46:41.880 --> 03:46:43.880]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best
[03:46:43.880 --> 03:46:44.880]  My children take it
[03:46:44.880 --> 03:46:46.880]  You think I'm going to give you fish oil
[03:46:46.880 --> 03:46:48.880]  That isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[03:46:48.880 --> 03:46:50.880]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over
[03:46:50.880 --> 03:46:51.880]  Like one of these devil worshippers?
[03:46:51.880 --> 03:46:52.880]  Never
[03:46:52.880 --> 03:47:20.880]  Alright, Mike Adams back again here today
[03:47:20.880 --> 03:47:22.880]  Today on The Alex Jones Show
[03:47:22.880 --> 03:47:23.880]  Last segment for the day
[03:47:23.880 --> 03:47:24.880]  Thank you for joining me
[03:47:24.880 --> 03:47:27.880]  Going to break down Apple's censorship attack
[03:47:27.880 --> 03:47:29.880]  On natural news today
[03:47:29.880 --> 03:47:31.880]  Alex was right when he said
[03:47:31.880 --> 03:47:33.880]  That Infowars was the test case
[03:47:33.880 --> 03:47:35.880]  So when Infowars was being de-platformed
[03:47:35.880 --> 03:47:37.880]  By everybody
[03:47:37.880 --> 03:47:38.880]  Really, I think these tech companies
[03:47:38.880 --> 03:47:39.880]  Were trying to see
[03:47:39.880 --> 03:47:41.880]  Can they get away with it?
[03:47:41.880 --> 03:47:43.880]  Would there be any pushback from the president
[03:47:43.880 --> 03:47:45.880]  Or the FTC or the DOJ
[03:47:45.880 --> 03:47:46.880]  Or members of Congress?
[03:47:46.880 --> 03:47:48.880]  Would there be any pushback?
[03:47:48.880 --> 03:47:50.880]  Of course they created this narrative
[03:47:50.880 --> 03:47:52.880]  To first discredit Alex Jones
[03:47:52.880 --> 03:47:54.880]  And then censor him
[03:47:54.880 --> 03:47:56.880]  By justifying that censorship
[03:47:56.880 --> 03:47:58.880]  By saying essentially, oh look, he's a bad person
[03:47:58.880 --> 03:48:00.880]  He said this and this and this
[03:48:00.880 --> 03:48:02.880]  Of course they were dishonest
[03:48:02.880 --> 03:48:04.880]  In their attacks, but this is their pattern
[03:48:04.880 --> 03:48:05.880]  This is what they do
[03:48:05.880 --> 03:48:07.880]  First they lie and smear and discredit
[03:48:07.880 --> 03:48:09.880]  And then they censor
[03:48:09.880 --> 03:48:11.880]  But they've been accelerating that game now
[03:48:11.880 --> 03:48:14.880]  To the point where inside companies
[03:48:14.880 --> 03:48:16.880]  Like Apple and Twitter
[03:48:16.880 --> 03:48:19.880]  They just skip the discrediting step now
[03:48:19.880 --> 03:48:21.880]  They just ban you for any reason
[03:48:21.880 --> 03:48:23.880]  And as Apple has done to us now
[03:48:23.880 --> 03:48:25.880]  In natural news, they started sending us
[03:48:25.880 --> 03:48:27.880]  Demand emails, Apple demanding
[03:48:27.880 --> 03:48:29.880]  That we stop publishing articles
[03:48:29.880 --> 03:48:32.880]  On abortion or Satanism
[03:48:32.880 --> 03:48:34.880]  Exposing the evils of Satanism
[03:48:34.880 --> 03:48:37.880]  And how it has invaded
[03:48:37.880 --> 03:48:40.880]  The psyche of many people in America
[03:48:40.880 --> 03:48:42.880]  Especially leftists
[03:48:42.880 --> 03:48:44.880]  They said that we have to stop
[03:48:44.880 --> 03:48:46.880]  Publishing articles about censorship
[03:48:46.880 --> 03:48:49.880]  So literally Apple is sending us
[03:48:49.880 --> 03:48:51.880]  A censorship demand letter
[03:48:51.880 --> 03:48:54.880]  Demanding that we stop writing about censorship
[03:48:54.880 --> 03:48:58.880]  Think about the levels of Orwellian evil
[03:48:58.880 --> 03:49:00.880]  Found in that nested loop
[03:49:00.880 --> 03:49:01.880]  It's insane
[03:49:01.880 --> 03:49:03.880]  They said we can't write about
[03:49:03.880 --> 03:49:04.880]  Infowars being censored
[03:49:04.880 --> 03:49:06.880]  They said we can't write about
[03:49:06.880 --> 03:49:08.880]  Migrants carrying infectious disease
[03:49:08.880 --> 03:49:10.880]  Into the United States
[03:49:10.880 --> 03:49:12.880]  Just think about this
[03:49:12.880 --> 03:49:14.880]  NaturalNews.com
[03:49:14.880 --> 03:49:16.880]  We're primarily a health site
[03:49:16.880 --> 03:49:18.880]  But a health freedom pro-liberty site as well
[03:49:18.880 --> 03:49:20.880]  It is our duty to talk about
[03:49:20.880 --> 03:49:22.880]  Infectious disease being brought into America
[03:49:22.880 --> 03:49:24.880]  It's our duty to talk about
[03:49:24.880 --> 03:49:26.880]  Drug-resistant tuberculosis
[03:49:26.880 --> 03:49:28.880]  Carried by illegal immigrants
[03:49:28.880 --> 03:49:30.880]  Across the border
[03:49:30.880 --> 03:49:32.880]  It's our duty to talk about the fact that
[03:49:32.880 --> 03:49:34.880]  Most of the measles outbreaks in America
[03:49:34.880 --> 03:49:36.880]  Happen among children
[03:49:36.880 --> 03:49:38.880]  Who have already been vaccinated
[03:49:38.880 --> 03:49:40.880]  With the MMR vaccine
[03:49:40.880 --> 03:49:42.880]  This is our duty
[03:49:42.880 --> 03:49:44.880]  And Apple says no, we demand that you
[03:49:44.880 --> 03:49:46.880]  Do not talk about these topics
[03:49:46.880 --> 03:49:49.880]  Or we will ban your app
[03:49:49.880 --> 03:49:51.880]  Just like they did to Infowars
[03:49:51.880 --> 03:49:54.880]  But the reason that they're giving is nonsense
[03:49:54.880 --> 03:49:56.880]  They say that our articles might create
[03:49:56.880 --> 03:49:58.880]  A reaction of disgust
[03:49:58.880 --> 03:50:00.880]  In the minds of somebody
[03:50:00.880 --> 03:50:01.880]  Well, who?
[03:50:01.880 --> 03:50:03.880]  Well, apparently the incredible liberal
[03:50:03.880 --> 03:50:05.880]  Crybullies who work at Apple
[03:50:05.880 --> 03:50:07.880]  That's who's offended by these
[03:50:07.880 --> 03:50:09.880]  That's who feels disgusted by it
[03:50:09.880 --> 03:50:11.880]  Because these people are all Satanists
[03:50:11.880 --> 03:50:13.880]  These people are all abortionists
[03:50:13.880 --> 03:50:15.880]  These people are the people
[03:50:15.880 --> 03:50:17.880]  Who want to poison your water supply
[03:50:17.880 --> 03:50:19.880]  Because they are opposed to water filters now
[03:50:19.880 --> 03:50:21.880]  Because Infowars sells water filters
[03:50:21.880 --> 03:50:23.880]  So think about this
[03:50:23.880 --> 03:50:25.880]  This demonic left
[03:50:25.880 --> 03:50:27.880]  They are opposed to life
[03:50:27.880 --> 03:50:29.880]  And health
[03:50:29.880 --> 03:50:31.880]  And clean water and nutrition
[03:50:31.880 --> 03:50:33.880]  They are all pro-pharma
[03:50:33.880 --> 03:50:35.880]  They want to drug your children
[03:50:35.880 --> 03:50:37.880]  With psychiatric drugs
[03:50:37.880 --> 03:50:39.880]  And survive the abortion mass murder attempt
[03:50:39.880 --> 03:50:40.880]  Of course
[03:50:40.880 --> 03:50:42.880]  So they want to murder your children
[03:50:42.880 --> 03:50:44.880]  But if you change your mind
[03:50:44.880 --> 03:50:45.880]  And don't want to murder them
[03:50:45.880 --> 03:50:47.880]  They want to drug your children into oblivion
[03:50:47.880 --> 03:50:50.880]  Then they want to poison you through all adulthood
[03:50:50.880 --> 03:50:52.880]  Apple is all pro-chemotherapy
[03:50:52.880 --> 03:50:54.880]  Toxic chemical weapons
[03:50:54.880 --> 03:50:56.880]  That cause utter destruction across the human body
[03:50:56.880 --> 03:51:00.880]  Heart damage, brain damage, kidney damage, liver damage
[03:51:00.880 --> 03:51:02.880]  Chemotherapy causes cancer to come back
[03:51:02.880 --> 03:51:03.880]  Stronger than ever
[03:51:03.880 --> 03:51:06.880]  Apple is pro-chemotherapy
[03:51:06.880 --> 03:51:09.880]  I mean, is there any destructive poison
[03:51:09.880 --> 03:51:11.880]  Or destructive propaganda
[03:51:11.880 --> 03:51:14.880]  Or destructive violent practice
[03:51:14.880 --> 03:51:16.880]  That Apple opposes?
[03:51:16.880 --> 03:51:18.880]  Apple seems to be interested
[03:51:18.880 --> 03:51:22.880]  In just mass destruction, death, and human suffering
[03:51:22.880 --> 03:51:24.880]  And that's why they are offended by my articles
[03:51:24.880 --> 03:51:26.880]  Which say, wait a minute
[03:51:26.880 --> 03:51:28.880]  Let's protect life here
[03:51:28.880 --> 03:51:30.880]  Let's do something amazing
[03:51:30.880 --> 03:51:32.880]  And not murder children after they're born
[03:51:32.880 --> 03:51:35.880]  How about we don't drug our children
[03:51:35.880 --> 03:51:38.880]  So that they turn into suicidal school shooters
[03:51:38.880 --> 03:51:41.880]  You know, hopped up on anti-depressants
[03:51:41.880 --> 03:51:43.880]  How about we have clean water
[03:51:43.880 --> 03:51:47.880]  How about we use nutrition to prevent and reverse cancer
[03:51:47.880 --> 03:51:51.880]  Diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, dementia
[03:51:51.880 --> 03:51:54.880]  Why don't we turn to high powered nutritional supplements
[03:51:54.880 --> 03:51:57.880]  To support and enhance cognitive function
[03:51:57.880 --> 03:52:00.880]  Without using toxic pharmaceutical medications
[03:52:00.880 --> 03:52:02.880]  These are the ideas that I stand for
[03:52:02.880 --> 03:52:04.880]  And also health freedom
[03:52:04.880 --> 03:52:06.880]  You know, health freedom
[03:52:06.880 --> 03:52:08.880]  Your right to say no to vaccines
[03:52:08.880 --> 03:52:12.880]  You know, your right to choose natural medicine
[03:52:12.880 --> 03:52:14.880]  Your right to say no to your doctor
[03:52:14.880 --> 03:52:16.880]  No to a pharmaceutical
[03:52:16.880 --> 03:52:19.880]  And instead use a natural method to protect and enhance your health
[03:52:19.880 --> 03:52:22.880]  But these ideas are offensive to Apple
[03:52:22.880 --> 03:52:24.880]  And apparently offensive to Tim Cook
[03:52:24.880 --> 03:52:26.880]  Makes me wonder what kind of philosophy
[03:52:26.880 --> 03:52:28.880]  Tim Cook actually has as the leader of Apple
[03:52:28.880 --> 03:52:32.880]  Surely he's aware that Apple is demanding
[03:52:32.880 --> 03:52:34.880]  That natural news be censored
[03:52:34.880 --> 03:52:36.880]  What does Tim Cook believe in?
[03:52:36.880 --> 03:52:38.880]  If he doesn't believe in protecting life
[03:52:38.880 --> 03:52:40.880]  And natural health and preventing disease
[03:52:40.880 --> 03:52:43.880]  And ending human suffering, what does he believe in?
[03:52:43.880 --> 03:52:46.880]  Well, it wouldn't be hard to assume that
[03:52:46.880 --> 03:52:49.880]  At least if his staff is following his direction here
[03:52:49.880 --> 03:52:53.880]  That maybe he believes in allowing Satan to rule over the earth
[03:52:53.880 --> 03:52:56.880]  That he believes in silencing voices of truth and reason
[03:52:56.880 --> 03:53:00.880]  That he believes in spreading evil through Apple
[03:53:00.880 --> 03:53:03.880]  Through all Apple devices that people carry in their hands
[03:53:03.880 --> 03:53:05.880]  Like Mark of the Beast items
[03:53:05.880 --> 03:53:11.880]  An evil fake news deception propaganda screen
[03:53:11.880 --> 03:53:14.880]  Run by Apple, ruled by evil
[03:53:14.880 --> 03:53:18.880]  Controlled by those who want to murder their own children
[03:53:18.880 --> 03:53:20.880]  And would think nothing about murdering yours
[03:53:20.880 --> 03:53:22.880]  That's what Apple has become
[03:53:22.880 --> 03:53:24.880]  It's very sad
[03:53:24.880 --> 03:53:27.880]  It's very sad that we live in a world like this
[03:53:27.880 --> 03:53:33.880]  Where evil has now taken over Google, Apple, Twitter, YouTube
[03:53:33.880 --> 03:53:35.880]  Facebook, Snapchat, all of it
[03:53:35.880 --> 03:53:38.880]  Now consumed by evil
[03:53:38.880 --> 03:53:40.880]  It's extraordinary
[03:53:40.880 --> 03:53:44.880]  And if you're looking for answers to this
[03:53:44.880 --> 03:53:46.880]  I've mentioned this before
[03:53:46.880 --> 03:53:48.880]  But you need...
[03:53:48.880 --> 03:53:51.880]  Number one, you need to pray for protection
[03:53:51.880 --> 03:53:53.880]  We literally need to pray for protection
[03:53:53.880 --> 03:53:58.880]  And we need to double down on our own good morality
[03:53:58.880 --> 03:54:00.880]  Our own philosophy of protecting children
[03:54:00.880 --> 03:54:04.880]  Our philosophy of printing the truth
[03:54:04.880 --> 03:54:07.880]  Our philosophy of protecting access to natural medicine
[03:54:07.880 --> 03:54:12.880]  That, let's face it, has been on this planet for as long as human beings have been alive
[03:54:12.880 --> 03:54:18.880]  It's no coincidence that hemp, for example, grows like a weed everywhere
[03:54:18.880 --> 03:54:22.880]  And happens to be biocompatible with the human body
[03:54:22.880 --> 03:54:27.880]  The endocannabinoid system is designed into the human body
[03:54:27.880 --> 03:54:33.880]  The genetic blueprint designed for humans by an intelligent designer, by the way
[03:54:33.880 --> 03:54:36.880]  That blueprint is compatible with cannabis
[03:54:36.880 --> 03:54:38.880]  It's irrefutable
[03:54:38.880 --> 03:54:43.880]  There are endocannabinoid receptors on many, many organs throughout our body
[03:54:43.880 --> 03:54:46.880]  And in fact, if you consume omega-3 fatty acids
[03:54:46.880 --> 03:54:51.880]  Your body creates a trace amount of cannabinoids right in your own body
[03:54:51.880 --> 03:54:57.880]  You make medicine inside your body when you consume omega-3s, which come from fish oils, by the way
[03:54:57.880 --> 03:54:59.880]  You make your own medicine
[03:54:59.880 --> 03:55:06.880]  And yet, evil apple, evil Google, evil YouTube wants to ban any talk about this natural medicine
[03:55:06.880 --> 03:55:11.880]  Nutritional supplements, protecting life, the divinity of...
[03:55:11.880 --> 03:55:14.880]  And the blessing of our life, all of our lives
[03:55:14.880 --> 03:55:18.880]  And our children being born alive as divine beings, conscious beings
[03:55:18.880 --> 03:55:21.880]  To help create a brighter future for humanity
[03:55:21.880 --> 03:55:23.880]  Apple is opposed to all of that
[03:55:23.880 --> 03:55:29.880]  Apple is infused with intense Satanism and evil destruction and darkness
[03:55:29.880 --> 03:55:33.880]  And they are cutting off the most important voices of our time
[03:55:33.880 --> 03:55:38.880]  The voices that can bring you truth and inspiration, healing
[03:55:38.880 --> 03:55:41.880]  Those voices are the independent media
[03:55:41.880 --> 03:55:45.880]  And that's who's being shut off because evil is taking over the tech giants
[03:55:45.880 --> 03:55:47.880]  It's disgusting
[03:55:47.880 --> 03:55:51.880]  You know, it's funny, they censor us and say that our articles create disgust
[03:55:51.880 --> 03:55:54.880]  And yet, their own actions at Apple are disgusting
[03:55:54.880 --> 03:55:59.880]  They are not... I mean, they are disgusting people who run that show
[03:55:59.880 --> 03:56:02.880]  And in some ways, I don't even consider them to be human
[03:56:02.880 --> 03:56:04.880]  Because they've lost all human compassion
[03:56:04.880 --> 03:56:06.880]  They don't even care about their own babies
[03:56:06.880 --> 03:56:10.880]  They would stand by and literally support the serial murder of their own children
[03:56:10.880 --> 03:56:13.880]  That's who they have become, and that's what we are up against, folks
[03:56:13.880 --> 03:56:15.880]  So I just want to encourage you
[03:56:15.880 --> 03:56:21.880]  Number one, I thank you for your support for Infowars, for Natural News, for all of us in the independent media
[03:56:21.880 --> 03:56:24.880]  Your support is crucial in this time
[03:56:24.880 --> 03:56:27.880]  The economic sabotage has been intense
[03:56:27.880 --> 03:56:31.880]  The censorship continues to be ramped up against us all
[03:56:31.880 --> 03:56:35.880]  And yet, somehow I feel like we will be victorious in this
[03:56:35.880 --> 03:56:38.880]  Because the light always wins, truth always wins out
[03:56:38.880 --> 03:56:40.880]  And God is literally on our side
[03:56:40.880 --> 03:56:43.880]  Because we are fighting to protect babies
[03:56:43.880 --> 03:56:47.880]  We are fighting to protect life, we are fighting to protect our ecosystem, our planet
[03:56:47.880 --> 03:56:51.880]  And we need your support in order to do that
[03:56:51.880 --> 03:56:53.880]  Just to wrap this up today
[03:56:53.880 --> 03:56:55.880]  Support the Infowars...
[03:56:55.880 --> 03:56:59.880]  They work hard to put out so many incredible products
[03:56:59.880 --> 03:57:03.880]  And many of them I've tested in my lab, and I keep meaning to tell Alex
[03:57:03.880 --> 03:57:06.880]  I'm going to come in, I've got Glyphazate certification testing
[03:57:06.880 --> 03:57:08.880]  For some of Infowars' top products
[03:57:08.880 --> 03:57:10.880]  I need to come in and actually just hand over the report
[03:57:10.880 --> 03:57:12.880]  Because we've done the Glyphazate testing on those
[03:57:12.880 --> 03:57:14.880]  And it's all clean
[03:57:14.880 --> 03:57:17.880]  But we're so busy, we don't even have time
[03:57:17.880 --> 03:57:20.880]  I rarely even talk to Alex except here on the show, by the way
[03:57:20.880 --> 03:57:23.880]  But support our efforts, and we will fight for you
[03:57:23.880 --> 03:57:25.880]  We will fight for life
[03:57:25.880 --> 03:57:27.880]  We will fight for divinity
[03:57:27.880 --> 03:57:32.880]  We will fight for truth and freedom and liberty in every way possible
[03:57:32.880 --> 03:57:34.880]  We are 100% committed to it
[03:57:34.880 --> 03:57:36.880]  And they're not going to shut us down
[03:57:36.880 --> 03:57:38.880]  No matter what they try, we are here to fight for you
[03:57:38.880 --> 03:57:40.880]  And fight for the future of humanity
