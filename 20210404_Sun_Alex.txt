[00:00.000 --> 00:24.880]  Did you know that thousands of insects and plants have been genetically engineered in
[00:24.880 --> 00:30.280]  the last decade and released in the open air, that then go out and breed with the other insects
[00:30.280 --> 00:39.080]  and sterilize them? Did you know that? They also created all sorts of other insects like
[00:39.080 --> 00:47.840]  mosquitoes, Bill Gates did, he funded it, that go out and breed with other mosquitoes.
[00:47.840 --> 00:55.440]  To supposedly make those mosquitoes become sterile and die, but really all it did was
[00:55.440 --> 01:01.920]  mutate the mosquitoes and make them much more deadly to humans. I'm sure that was just a
[01:01.920 --> 01:08.240]  mistake. No, all this has been tested many times over many years before it's released.
[01:08.240 --> 01:14.080]  If anything, these globalists are control freaks. So here on this Easter Sunday broadcast,
[01:14.080 --> 01:17.900]  we talk about the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, something Google
[01:17.900 --> 01:25.920]  won't promote. Go to Google's front page right now, please. For any unheard of person, organization
[01:25.920 --> 01:33.400]  or religion or group, they'll put up the Google Doodle, but nothing on probably the most holy
[01:33.400 --> 01:39.880]  day in the Christian religion. Billions of Christians worldwide, nothing about Christianity
[01:39.880 --> 01:46.680]  on the Google front page. You just go right to the Google.com front page. And you can
[01:46.680 --> 01:53.360]  see right there, ladies and gentlemen, that there's nothing there. They put up stuff for
[01:53.360 --> 02:00.480]  Islam, the Buddhist, Satanism and everything in between, but not for Christianity. So ask
[02:00.480 --> 02:05.520]  yourself, why is that? Well, they see Christianity as bad. They see Christianity as the enemy.
[02:05.520 --> 02:14.440]  They discriminate against Christianity because Google is inherently evil. Christianity warns
[02:14.440 --> 02:21.200]  about a worldwide mark of the beast. Christianity warns about assisted to buy and sell. Christianity
[02:21.200 --> 02:26.480]  warns about what's now unfolding. Oh, they've bought off most of the churches. I'm not saying
[02:26.480 --> 02:29.760]  you're going to find Christ in those churches, but I'm talking about what's really in the
[02:29.760 --> 02:34.120]  Bible, what's really unfolding, what's really happening. Again, I want to thank you all for
[02:34.120 --> 02:43.240]  joining us on this Sunday, April 4th, 2021 transmission. And I intend to really lay out
[02:43.240 --> 02:49.760]  incredible information today. We came in yesterday and shot a special emergency Saturday transmission.
[02:49.760 --> 02:54.440]  Every show is pretty much an emergency now. Hell, we're calling this an emergency transmission
[02:54.440 --> 02:59.200]  Sunday broadcast because everybody else is getting shut down, including the real president,
[02:59.200 --> 03:07.520]  Donald John Trump. And if we don't recognize that we are in an emergency, if we don't recognize
[03:07.520 --> 03:12.120]  that we're in a crisis, we'll just keep acting like everything is the way it was before and
[03:12.120 --> 03:19.920]  calmly go into that dark night. But I'm not going down without a serious cultural, spiritual,
[03:19.920 --> 03:25.080]  historical, financial, and then they assault us physical fight. So I want you to watch
[03:25.080 --> 03:33.000]  the special report we shot yesterday, Emergency Saturday Broadcast World Shocked by SPARS 2025,
[03:33.000 --> 03:42.600]  2028 document. And it's got close to 700,000 views. And that's great. It needs a billion
[03:42.600 --> 03:47.680]  views. In fact, no doubt if a billion people watch this, our problems would all basically
[03:47.680 --> 03:54.120]  end with the current problem globalist at least. You know, I've seen Event 201 and I've
[03:54.120 --> 04:01.760]  seen Operation Northwoods and I've seen Operation Lockstep and boy, I've seen a lot. But when
[04:01.760 --> 04:15.760]  I read SPARS 2025, 2028, which is really 2020, 2023. And the exact parallels, the same names
[04:15.760 --> 04:21.720]  of the viruses, everything, it was amazing. And of course, it was the Rockefeller Foundation
[04:21.720 --> 04:27.680]  funding John Hopkins. It is every time. You know, again, I had the former head of two
[04:27.680 --> 04:33.000]  major US intelligence agencies asked me about a month ago. How did you know all this in
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.560]  a video you did 10 years ago? And I said, Well, I read it on a Rockefeller document.
[04:36.560 --> 04:39.920]  He goes, Well, there's a lot of Rockefeller documents. Well, I know which ones are important.
[04:39.920 --> 04:44.280]  I know how to tell what's in path with their plan. So we're going to lay out that level
[04:44.280 --> 04:48.200]  of breaking knowledge about what's coming next straight ahead. So hopefully we can stop
[04:48.200 --> 04:52.520]  it this time. You know, we're intelligent. We're motivated. We can stop this. We've got
[04:52.520 --> 04:56.720]  to wake up. We've got to realize this is the reality.
[04:56.720 --> 05:04.160]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there about looking at
[05:04.160 --> 05:08.360]  the world from the perspective of the globalist, that the public so dumbed down that they don't
[05:08.360 --> 05:11.840]  care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're
[05:11.840 --> 05:17.040]  sterilizing them, then they deserve to be killed. Yes, that's the position of the globalist.
[05:17.040 --> 05:21.680]  They play God. And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to
[05:21.680 --> 05:26.480]  us. You know, I've told you that the globalist who tried to hire me, they tried to get me
[05:26.480 --> 05:31.920]  to join them. But metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit. I'm connection
[05:31.920 --> 05:36.600]  with God. And I know that God does not like that. So I cannot join the enemy. But I'll
[05:36.600 --> 05:42.040]  tell you at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system,
[05:42.040 --> 05:45.920]  believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power on it. Whether you're just a
[05:45.920 --> 05:51.960]  steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God. And treating other
[05:51.960 --> 05:56.520]  people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the universe
[05:56.520 --> 06:09.920]  doesn't like. That's a fact.
[06:09.920 --> 06:16.920]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[06:16.920 --> 06:24.000]  All right, here's the way to think about it. Here's the way to try to get my point across
[06:24.000 --> 06:29.440]  from this live easier transmission, which is only here. Thanks to your support, your
[06:29.440 --> 06:38.360]  graces and good Lord above as well. Imagine if you learned aliens around the planet and
[06:38.360 --> 06:44.200]  you were suddenly able to read their language and read their text and read their compendium
[06:44.200 --> 06:49.440]  of communication and you saw how they were controlling you. You saw how they were manipulating
[06:49.440 --> 06:56.120]  your science. You saw how they were slowly but surely bending your species and turning
[06:56.120 --> 07:01.640]  you into something else, something ugly, something stupid, something controllable, really just
[07:01.640 --> 07:05.000]  because they were jealous of you.
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.720]  Why you might actually do something about that. You might actually have will. You might
[07:09.720 --> 07:15.320]  actually want to control your own destiny. You might actually feel threatened by that.
[07:15.320 --> 07:20.480]  And it's in the resistance to that that you would find who you are. But if you don't have
[07:20.480 --> 07:26.520]  a desire to resist that, even in the hypothetical example I just gave, that you don't have consciousness.
[07:26.520 --> 07:32.440]  You are in a sleep state or maybe you're totally turned over to the spirit and are actually
[07:32.440 --> 07:39.120]  believing in your own destruction because you have some form of self-loathing.
[07:39.120 --> 07:47.200]  But this is not the fanciful aliens of Hollywood we're talking about. This is the globalist
[07:47.200 --> 07:52.600]  that in their own publications, countless publications like Brave New World revisited
[07:52.600 --> 08:01.040]  and the statements of Ray Kurzweil and so many others say, we believe humanity has fallen
[08:01.040 --> 08:07.320]  and failed and ugly because they think that of themselves and we are going to accelerate
[08:07.320 --> 08:13.400]  mass mutations in the population and massive degradation and we believe out of that will
[08:13.400 --> 08:17.920]  rise the Uber mention.
[08:17.920 --> 08:21.600]  And it is true that that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger, but these people
[08:21.600 --> 08:28.720]  are projecting their own hatred of themselves on to us and then using that excuse that they're
[08:28.720 --> 08:34.080]  trying to save humanity and trying to make us go through this metamorphosis as really
[08:34.080 --> 08:38.200]  just an excuse to carry out their incredibly sadistic activities.
[08:38.200 --> 08:44.080]  So, my broadcast is not here for people that want to live in La La Land. It's not here
[08:44.080 --> 08:49.520]  for people that just want to have the normal political kind of sports like news where we
[08:49.520 --> 08:57.160]  just battle left, right. This is about transcendence and a resurrection of the human spirit towards
[08:57.160 --> 09:04.040]  God's will and God's destiny, but God is free will. You must choose that.
[09:04.040 --> 09:10.080]  So let me give you the newsflash and just here's a quick example of this. I went on
[09:10.080 --> 09:17.800]  air yesterday for two hours and posted a key report that's gone viral at Band-Aught Video,
[09:17.800 --> 09:27.560]  Emergency Saturday broadcast, World Shocked by Spars 2025-2028 document. And in that,
[09:27.560 --> 09:32.720]  I show you a Rockefeller Foundation funded, Bill and Melinda Gates funded, Davos Group,
[09:32.720 --> 09:36.920]  UN funded document. I show you where they fund it and everything. Every damn thing I
[09:36.920 --> 09:51.120]  say, I show you. And in that, they admit their whole plan.
[09:51.120 --> 09:55.360]  And so then I thought when I was doing that show yesterday, I said, let me just mention
[09:55.360 --> 10:02.640]  how the University of Texas down the street from where I'm broadcasting in the ATX, decades
[10:02.640 --> 10:09.640]  ago produced mass production of a genetically engineered fly, already existed, that lays
[10:09.640 --> 10:17.800]  an egg on a fire ant's head and then its larvae goes in and eats the fire ant's brain. Or
[10:17.800 --> 10:21.800]  let me talk about how they take baby carb and put some chemicals in the water that make
[10:21.800 --> 10:27.560]  them all sterile, then the carb grow up and eat the hydrilla in the water but don't reproduce.
[10:27.560 --> 10:33.720]  Or I just mentioned that and what was great was, then I saw the comments at man.videoinfo
[10:33.720 --> 10:40.000]  wars saying, oh my gosh, we hadn't looked all this up. That's on John Hopkins' website
[10:40.000 --> 10:51.720]  because now everybody's checking John Hopkins. And it's gene drives pursuing opportunities
[10:51.720 --> 11:08.240]  minimizing risk. And so later in the broadcast, I'm going to cover some of this for you. Now
[11:08.240 --> 11:19.000]  this is just John Hopkins talking about putting chemicals in the water to sterilize the males,
[11:19.000 --> 11:26.160]  releasing biologicals that re-engineer. They have live viruses that re-engineer your DNA.
[11:26.160 --> 11:32.720]  They've got the CRISPR editing system, they've got it all. They can control you now completely.
[11:32.720 --> 11:41.040]  And the general public sits there like children and says, oh my gosh, Alex Jones is incredible.
[11:41.040 --> 11:49.840]  How did he know they were putting chemicals in the water to make the frogs gay when it's
[11:49.840 --> 11:55.000]  actually going on and they now admit it all? Because these documents existed 15 years ago
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.720]  and I said that they've now just gone completely operational. And when I said make the frogs
[11:59.720 --> 12:04.520]  gay, I did that on purpose, knowing they would attack me for it, believing in the future
[12:04.520 --> 12:15.520]  you would find these documents. But it's like the pinball wizard thing of the who. It's
[12:15.520 --> 12:20.080]  not like I did it on purpose. It's more of an idiot savant thing. I know how to manipulate
[12:20.080 --> 12:25.680]  these people with the truth. I don't do it with lies. But now everybody's like, oh Alex
[12:25.680 --> 12:31.960]  Jones is right. New York Times. The everyday chemicals that might be leading us to our
[12:31.960 --> 12:41.360]  extinction. Bill Gates wants to deploy genetically modified mosquitoes to inject vaccines and
[12:41.360 --> 12:51.120]  force you to take live nanotech vaccines. That is a decade old article. So here's what's
[12:51.120 --> 12:58.000]  happening. I'm just here on air covering the whole real world, the way it really works.
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.000]  The scientists have been recruited. They're in charge. They are building a world of post
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.840]  human. To do that, they've got to destabilize things, cut resources off, get you to take
[13:08.840 --> 13:14.160]  gene therapy vaccines that sterilize you. And all the numbers coming out showing these
[13:14.160 --> 13:20.120]  new vaccines, gene therapy, reduced fertility, attack placenta. But on top of that, that's
[13:20.120 --> 13:27.240]  not enough to sterilize you. The studies currently coming out about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines
[13:27.240 --> 13:34.200]  admit, and I'll show these to you, that it's causing protein blooms in the brain, similar
[13:34.200 --> 13:46.080]  to prions, spongiform encephalopathy. You have the public nomenclature term is mad cow. But
[13:46.080 --> 13:57.160]  let's just say convulsing, becoming numb, dying. It's a protein that eats your brain.
[13:57.160 --> 14:03.000]  So that's where we are. And they said in a report four years ago, put up with the Rockefeller
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.660]  Foundation with Bill and Melinda Gates through John Hopkins, that they would do the mass
[14:08.660 --> 14:18.720]  inoculation to respond to the virus they were going to release from a lab. And that then
[14:18.720 --> 14:24.520]  when you took the vaccine six months to a year later, it would start eating your brain.
[14:24.520 --> 14:29.360]  And the collapse of civilization will then ensue. And who is the most vaccinated country
[14:29.360 --> 14:34.520]  in the world, the United States, who's the next most vaccinated Europe, which statistically
[14:34.520 --> 14:41.080]  had the ethos of freedom, the highest IQs, and had a chance to hold the planet up, instead
[14:41.080 --> 14:45.400]  they're taking out the brain trust right now. And then we're all going to have to take care
[14:45.400 --> 14:52.000]  of our families that took the vaccine as they become progressively mentally retarded.
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.160]  And that will then collapse society. We've been hit. And already almost half the public
[14:57.160 --> 15:03.760]  is taking the vaccine. The public gets 60% or so to take it. And we're going to be taking
[15:03.760 --> 15:10.200]  care of all these folks. And then again, they even talk about how to manage that the news,
[15:10.200 --> 15:14.760]  how to control that the news. And so people ask, how am I doing? How am I taking this?
[15:14.760 --> 15:19.880]  I mean, we're all going down together. It's like on the Titanic, we're going under. And
[15:19.880 --> 15:24.960]  and I mean, we just we're not designed for this high tech stuff. We're not designed to
[15:24.960 --> 15:30.640]  take on globalist or the sophisticated. We're not designed to take on treachery. This this
[15:30.640 --> 15:36.240]  is incredible. The one thing you've got is a memory. So when you notice like your dad
[15:36.240 --> 15:39.360]  or your mom or your neighbor, like people are dying all around you, which is already
[15:39.360 --> 15:42.800]  happening. I know a bunch of people already died from the vaccine myself personally. And
[15:42.800 --> 15:45.440]  the families are like, well, don't talk about it. Yeah, they took it and died. But please
[15:45.440 --> 15:49.800]  be private Alex, you know, we're not sure this was it, you know, it's like, I'm bad
[15:49.800 --> 15:53.080]  that I know they're failing or died from it. So it's everybody's going to be quiet and
[15:53.080 --> 15:58.440]  die. So it's okay. Let's just all die. It's okay. Let's die.
[15:58.440 --> 16:04.880]  The equation is very simple. The mega banks control the media. They control big pharma.
[16:04.880 --> 16:12.000]  They control academia. They control the military industrial complex. They control big tech.
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.520]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established
[16:16.520 --> 16:24.400]  absolute total despotism and dehumanization. It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom
[16:24.400 --> 16:28.720]  that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens
[16:28.720 --> 16:35.120]  them. So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted, turned it upside
[16:35.120 --> 16:42.640]  down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[16:42.640 --> 16:47.080]  that threatens their monopolies of control. That's why they target info wars because we
[16:47.080 --> 16:52.840]  understand the key to the feeding of the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote
[16:52.840 --> 16:58.120]  info wars and add that video. So we double your efforts. We're all in this together.
[16:58.120 --> 17:12.920]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[17:12.920 --> 17:27.040]  Info wars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective. The
[17:27.040 --> 17:35.800]  great awakening is here. Go to banned.video. Download the videos and share. Support the
[17:35.800 --> 17:58.440]  information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[17:58.440 --> 18:03.000]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world. They are creating insecurity, crying,
[18:03.000 --> 18:09.160]  war and famine. All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves
[18:09.160 --> 18:14.440]  and our family's sakes but also our community. And citizensstronghold.com is the best place
[18:14.440 --> 18:19.000]  to go to get high quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find. Again,
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.920]  this is high quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find. We've worked
[18:22.920 --> 18:26.960]  with them for years, but they can never supply enough to our audience. They have massively
[18:26.960 --> 18:31.160]  expanded their factories. It's made right here in America and they're ready to ship
[18:31.160 --> 18:36.280]  it to you right now. Citizensstronghold.com. When you go there, put in promo code ALICE
[18:36.280 --> 18:40.200]  and get 10% off on your purchases. They have it for children, they have it for women, they
[18:40.200 --> 18:44.920]  have it for men. They have bat packs that then unfold and are full top body armor. They've
[18:44.920 --> 18:50.120]  got it all right now ready to ship to you 10% off. And the globalists are coming to try
[18:50.120 --> 18:54.920]  to stop the sale of it soon. That's why you need to get it now at citizensstronghold.com.
[18:54.920 --> 19:01.160]  Promo code ALICE and get 10% off. I don't like coming to you and saying this could be
[19:01.160 --> 19:05.160]  our last broadcast. Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have
[19:05.160 --> 19:09.960]  I said that. But let me tell you, the new world order is breathing down our neck. The big
[19:09.960 --> 19:13.200]  globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut
[19:13.200 --> 19:18.240]  us down. So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local station
[19:18.240 --> 19:23.240]  you're listening to as well. At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can
[19:23.240 --> 19:28.800]  and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money
[19:28.800 --> 19:33.880]  that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing. I need your help more than ever now.
[19:33.880 --> 19:38.640]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us. So
[19:38.640 --> 19:43.600]  pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can and buy great
[19:43.600 --> 19:48.880]  products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com. Whether
[19:48.880 --> 19:54.280]  it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul.
[19:54.280 --> 20:01.600]  All of it empowers humanity. All of it is pro-human and pro-God. Thank you so much.
[20:01.600 --> 20:19.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:19.880 --> 20:43.080]  All right, so I'm not here on air trying to be negative on Easter, but everyone is trained
[20:43.080 --> 20:51.840]  to recognize football and Hollywood and all this mainstream stuff. And so when we say
[20:51.840 --> 20:59.040]  there's a scientific dictatorship carrying out covert manipulation of human evolution
[20:59.040 --> 21:02.840]  towards a post-human world, and I have all their literature, all their admissions, all
[21:02.840 --> 21:09.680]  their state of people go, that's not what I want to hear. But now you see every institution
[21:09.680 --> 21:16.200]  from the baseball leagues to the football leagues to Hollywood is just anti-God, anti-family,
[21:16.200 --> 21:23.120]  totally destructive, anti-free speech, anti-regular voting, anti-everything because this group
[21:23.120 --> 21:34.200]  is evil, ladies and gentlemen. So imagine I'm back in 2010, read Operation
[21:34.200 --> 21:40.860]  Lockstep on air about the beginning of martial law. Now they would first release a simulant
[21:40.860 --> 21:45.920]  virus, create fear, lock things down, then later release a more deadly virus once we
[21:45.920 --> 21:49.920]  had submitted and been locked down properly. But they would lock us down, take the lock
[21:49.920 --> 21:56.800]  down off, then launch a new stronger attack. And people saw me talk about that 10 years
[21:56.800 --> 22:00.880]  later. They went, oh my God, this guy has a crystal ball. No, it was in the documents.
[22:00.880 --> 22:05.360]  Well, now we have a 2017 document. And again, I'll be honest with you, I try to read all
[22:05.360 --> 22:10.520]  these CFR and Trilateral Commission and John Hopkins and Rockefeller documents, but I
[22:10.520 --> 22:18.400]  can't even keep track of them all. But I'm here reading all this like spars pandemic
[22:18.400 --> 22:25.360]  2028, and it's even worse. I'll cover it coming up next segment and show you the exact parallels
[22:25.360 --> 22:32.760]  of how it's actually real time. 2025 is actually 2020. 2028 is actually 2023. And it's all
[22:32.760 --> 22:40.600]  in real time. But first, let me just do this. Let me play this clip from 11 years ago, 2010,
[22:40.600 --> 22:45.360]  just a few minutes long, then I'll play Greg Reese's newest report. We're about to premiere
[22:45.360 --> 22:49.760]  just dealing with Bill Gates wants control of everything because he's the front man of
[22:49.760 --> 22:55.080]  all the robber bearing money of all the elites that put their money into eugenics to carry
[22:55.080 --> 22:59.640]  this out, which is actually on record. Historically, there's Pulitzer prize winning books about
[22:59.640 --> 23:05.600]  this, that his family runs it, but the average person doesn't read that they don't even know.
[23:05.600 --> 23:12.960]  Or they pretend they're like part of the system. So here it is. Here's Chris Clip 15
[23:12.960 --> 23:18.440]  from 11 years ago, for your mind. I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information
[23:18.440 --> 23:24.800]  that's powerful. And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute. Because
[23:24.800 --> 23:31.680]  I've had chills since last night. This just confirms everything else. We've already researched
[23:31.680 --> 23:39.680]  a Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite millions being killed,
[23:39.680 --> 23:44.280]  mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other
[23:44.280 --> 23:48.240]  documents. But this dovetails of all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the
[23:48.240 --> 23:52.920]  GMO food to sterilize you and forced vaccines. And the hell we're already living in this
[23:52.920 --> 23:56.920]  is going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics
[23:56.920 --> 24:02.240]  mad men. But that story is up on prisonplanet.com. The question is, will you have the courage
[24:02.240 --> 24:05.840]  to really do the research yourself? Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear
[24:05.840 --> 24:11.160]  me make these claims. These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers. So
[24:11.160 --> 24:16.080]  many of them that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers
[24:16.080 --> 24:22.120]  so fast that you could never read them all. It is an open conspiracy against you and your
[24:22.120 --> 24:26.920]  family. I pray to God, I pray to my heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me
[24:26.920 --> 24:31.720]  the strength and the will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to
[24:31.720 --> 24:36.720]  carry on because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just
[24:36.720 --> 24:42.800]  want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards and I'm a liar. I know why
[24:42.800 --> 24:52.880]  because it's scary. You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore. You're
[24:52.880 --> 24:55.440]  not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends. You're not going
[24:55.440 --> 25:02.800]  to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time. The only chance we've got of
[25:02.800 --> 25:09.720]  beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally
[25:09.720 --> 25:17.160]  enslave you, mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually. The only way to defeat it is
[25:17.160 --> 25:23.200]  for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your
[25:23.200 --> 25:28.760]  destiny is going to be. Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted
[25:28.760 --> 25:33.720]  it to yourself, it will take over your life. It should take over your life. I mean, what
[25:33.720 --> 25:41.480]  else? What else could it do? We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the control
[25:41.480 --> 25:47.480]  corporate media has been putting out for decades ahead of their open unveiling of planetary
[25:47.480 --> 25:54.040]  dictatorship. They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out. Canada and
[25:54.040 --> 25:59.560]  the United States are going to work in lockstep, display the seriousness of our commitment
[25:59.560 --> 26:07.800]  that will hold in a broth. When lose or draw, you need to choose a sign. Info wars, tomorrow's
[26:07.800 --> 26:13.600]  news today. All right, so that's from 10 years ago, 11 years ago. Let me just show you these
[26:13.600 --> 26:18.880]  documents. We'll come back and play the latest report that just broke. Florida governor bans
[26:18.880 --> 26:24.240]  COVID-19 vaccine passports, CNN attacks it says it's evil. The vaccine doesn't protect
[26:24.240 --> 26:29.680]  you. They admit you got to take 10 shots a year. It's all a fraud. Hawaii unveils COVID
[26:29.680 --> 26:34.000]  passports for inner island travel. Remember, they said, oh, it's a conspiracy theory. No
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  one's planning it even though it was in all the documents. We said he over a year ago,
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.640]  it is coming. They went, no, no, no, no, no, so you wouldn't form opposition. Oh, it's
[26:41.640 --> 26:47.080]  not coming. Oh, it's not coming. Well, they got it ready. You remember they lied to you.
[26:47.080 --> 26:51.920]  UK to roll out COVID passports for sporting and music events. God have the vaccine to
[26:51.920 --> 26:56.360]  go. All a giant lie. But always it's going to be expended. It's not going to work. Get
[26:56.360 --> 27:05.320]  the new shot and pay for it. Italy mandates COVID-19 shots for all health care workers.
[27:05.320 --> 27:11.240]  The government putting an experimental unauthorized vaccine in you. Meanwhile at info wars dot
[27:11.240 --> 27:18.200]  com, FBI promises to hunt down anyone who lies about taking COVID vaccine a vaccine
[27:18.200 --> 27:24.400]  passport. That's right in the future. Oh, trying to travel without it. You're a criminal.
[27:24.400 --> 27:28.160]  The FBI will get, you know, the kids being smuggled in. Not with every epsi stuff, but
[27:28.160 --> 27:34.960]  you better take your Bill Gates shot. We have CNN video all play next segment where she
[27:34.960 --> 27:40.360]  says, hell, do it up now. We have time where the CNN analyst says, we can't allow freedom.
[27:40.360 --> 27:44.400]  We got to keep everybody locked down to make them do what we want. They just admit it all
[27:44.400 --> 27:49.160]  and she's so proud to be part of the corrupt power structure. She's not even scared to
[27:49.160 --> 27:56.760]  be signed on to such evil. We'll play it next segment. China is asking the WHO to hire them
[27:56.760 --> 28:02.240]  to build an international system to maintain flyer data regarding vaccines to cross border
[28:02.240 --> 28:07.440]  travel. The world ID. It's already been done. And that's just a fraction of the articles
[28:07.440 --> 28:15.680]  on that front. Look at this meme. It's gone viral. Says the globalist technocracy. Mark
[28:15.680 --> 28:23.640]  Zuckerberg. I delete your post. Jeff Bezos. I delete your books. Susan. Mikowski of YouTube.
[28:23.640 --> 28:29.800]  I delete your videos. Joe Biden, the puppet president. I delete your votes and Bill Gates.
[28:29.800 --> 28:37.880]  I delete you. So when we come back, I'll play the CNN health analyst saying, don't let
[28:37.880 --> 28:43.160]  them have freedom. Keep them slaves. Intimidate them till they do what we say. Hold them hostage.
[28:43.160 --> 28:47.280]  I mean, this is like, it's all out in the open now. They got to emerge at some point.
[28:47.280 --> 28:52.360]  They're here. They're here. They're back. And then we'll play you the next report we haven't
[28:52.360 --> 28:59.880]  premiered yet. I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us. Gerald in South Carolina. Go ahead. You're
[28:59.880 --> 29:03.960]  on the air trying to move quicker. Hey, Alex. Welcome. Would like to say first off, thanks
[29:03.960 --> 29:08.480]  for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people I've
[29:08.480 --> 29:14.520]  been trying to get ahold of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria
[29:14.520 --> 29:19.440]  infection on my lung that'll never go away. Living defense saved my life. They had me
[29:19.440 --> 29:25.240]  on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back. I wanted
[29:25.240 --> 29:31.280]  to just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew
[29:31.280 --> 29:38.080]  24, verse nine. Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and
[29:38.080 --> 29:44.320]  you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended and
[29:44.320 --> 29:49.280]  shall betray one another and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at, brother.
[29:49.280 --> 29:53.720]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say.
[29:53.720 --> 29:58.920]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.

[30:58.880 --> 31:06.880]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[31:06.880 --> 31:11.360]  And they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[31:11.360 --> 31:15.960]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering. That's why they've been massively
[31:15.960 --> 31:20.560]  expanding their services. So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want
[31:20.560 --> 31:25.160]  help building a website or want servers or any other major service, they've got it all
[31:25.160 --> 31:31.040]  and they're expanding. And if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their
[31:31.040 --> 31:37.640]  services at the lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move
[31:37.640 --> 31:42.480]  goes to fund the info war. And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type
[31:42.480 --> 31:47.520]  of services that you get from them. So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet
[31:47.520 --> 31:51.200]  again, because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[31:51.200 --> 32:03.200]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there infowarsdomains.com. Take action now.
[32:03.200 --> 32:08.200]  Randy Dewwright. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[32:08.200 --> 32:13.080]  First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the senior citizens
[32:13.080 --> 32:17.880]  out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots
[32:17.880 --> 32:22.960]  or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your X2 for the last couple of
[32:22.960 --> 32:30.520]  years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually. People think I'm 55 years old. And I was already
[32:30.520 --> 32:34.560]  taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to
[32:34.560 --> 32:39.000]  do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, I
[32:39.000 --> 32:44.040]  mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But you know, over a period of time, I started noticing,
[32:44.040 --> 32:48.520]  okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know, I don't
[32:48.520 --> 32:55.240]  have to put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really
[32:55.240 --> 33:01.520]  has totally cleared up my skin.
[33:01.520 --> 33:04.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:04.520 --> 33:28.880]  Welcome back to the edition of the live Alex Jones show Sunday April 4th, 2021. So here's
[33:28.880 --> 33:35.320]  the final summation. There is a planetary corporate dictatorship ally of the commonest
[33:35.320 --> 33:47.200]  China that is already carrying out a sterilization brain damaging operation through gene therapies
[33:47.200 --> 33:53.920]  that are specifically designed to create prion storms, basically protein crystals in your
[33:53.920 --> 34:02.300]  brain to kill you very slowly, very painfully to weigh down your family and the system collapses.
[34:02.300 --> 34:09.800]  And also to attack the same protein in the placenta every time you try to have a child.
[34:09.800 --> 34:14.040]  And they admit in these John Hopkins documents that as this comes out, just everything's
[34:14.040 --> 34:18.120]  going to collapse. That's why China is not really taking the shots. Others aren't. It's
[34:18.120 --> 34:24.560]  only the United States and Europe. For whatever reason, we are slated for total total destruction.
[34:24.560 --> 34:28.960]  And so we're just calmly here just watching the total annihilation. It's got to be really
[34:28.960 --> 34:33.080]  strong. They don't want to kill you up front, but it kills the marvelous Marvin Hanglers.
[34:33.080 --> 34:37.680]  It kills the Hank Aaron's. It almost kills the Ben Stein's. I know a bunch of people
[34:37.680 --> 34:41.080]  personally that family die after they take it. They're like, Hey, it's personal. Yeah,
[34:41.080 --> 34:45.680]  they died. Don't talk about it. You know, we're seeing what happened with the doctors.
[34:45.680 --> 34:51.800]  Yeah, my dad, my mom's dead. Yes, my brother's dead. Yeah, he, he died of heart attack five
[34:51.800 --> 34:56.320]  hours every took it. But you know what, Alex? It's not, uh, uh, uh, it's our family. Well,
[34:56.320 --> 35:00.120]  hey, great. Kill yourself. I love it. I get it. Bill Gates does he's killing you. You
[35:00.120 --> 35:04.720]  love it. Kill yourself. Love it. Let's do it. Fine. You love it. I get it. Kill the
[35:04.720 --> 35:11.560]  babies. They're not humans either. I get it. So fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. I understand.
[35:11.560 --> 35:15.360]  And you're going to love the checkpoints and how you got to always have new shots to travel
[35:15.360 --> 35:19.360]  and how the, the authoritarians and all of it. I get it. You don't like freedom. You
[35:19.360 --> 35:25.960]  want to be destroyed and you will be. But I'm here for folks that actually want to hear
[35:25.960 --> 35:30.520]  the truth, be aware, you know, poor Hank Aaron, other said it's a small thing to do to protect
[35:30.520 --> 35:34.800]  other people. They told him that, but it doesn't protect you from the cold virus. They now
[35:34.800 --> 35:38.280]  admit the vaccine doesn't work. That's why I got to take 10 of them a year. There's always
[35:38.280 --> 35:42.840]  a new variant. So they never did it before. It's why Merck pulled out of the vaccine
[35:42.840 --> 35:49.040]  and said three months ago, you cannot develop a vaccine for this. It's a fraud, but they've
[35:49.040 --> 35:55.720]  created a fraud. So big. Everybody's a hero and is going to stay in it. Everybody's going
[35:55.720 --> 36:02.160]  to cause they can't admit they were wrong. They wore masks. They took shots. You're heroes.
[36:02.160 --> 36:09.200]  You want to die and you will. The police want to go shut down churches while the big box
[36:09.200 --> 36:18.640]  doors are open. It's cool. You want to die too? You will. Don't worry. It's a spiritual
[36:18.640 --> 36:27.600]  choice. It's so obvious it's a lie. It's all based on a fraud. And the people that are
[36:27.600 --> 36:32.440]  going to die and who are into this, they don't even, they're already not here anyways. So
[36:32.440 --> 36:40.000]  it really is a choice. It's a test. So I guess I should say thank you, Bill Gates, for getting
[36:40.000 --> 36:46.200]  rid of the bad people. You know best. Seriously, Bill Gates is actually cleansing us. He's
[36:46.200 --> 36:53.000]  our teacher. I'm getting to learn. And so is Mark Zuckerberg and Susan Wachowski and
[36:53.000 --> 37:02.880]  Joe Biden, all of them. They are our teachers. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[37:02.880 --> 37:16.840]  Wise sages cleanse us. But oh, here's another wise sage. Here's another wise sage, the CNN
[37:16.840 --> 37:28.000]  medical advisor on TV telling us how great all this is and that we need to have tyranny
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.680]  in place to make sure we all take the experimental shots where they skipped animal testing because
[37:33.680 --> 37:38.320]  it killed so many animals in the testing. Sexy did the animal testing and everyone's
[37:38.320 --> 37:43.800]  fighting to get the vaccine. It's the coolest, neatest thing gene therapy you can get. Let's
[37:43.800 --> 37:49.840]  hear from CNN. Here it is. My main concern is that we're not going to reach herd immunity
[37:49.840 --> 37:54.720]  because of vaccine hesitancy. And I know that's hard for a lot of people to believe who desperately
[37:54.720 --> 37:58.840]  want the vaccine right now. And they're thinking, Oh, well, it's just a small percentage of people
[37:58.840 --> 38:03.520]  who are actually anti vaxxers. And that's true. There is the anti science anti vaxxer
[38:03.520 --> 38:08.240]  contingent. But I think that there are many more people, millions of people who for whatever
[38:08.240 --> 38:13.080]  reason have concerns about the vaccine who just don't know what's in it for them. And
[38:13.080 --> 38:17.440]  we need to make it clear to them that the vaccine is the ticket back to pre pandemic
[38:17.440 --> 38:21.080]  life. And the window to do that is really narrowing. I mean, you were mentioning Chris
[38:21.080 --> 38:26.640]  about how all these states are reopening, they're reopening at 100%. And we have a very
[38:26.640 --> 38:32.360]  narrow window to tie reopening policy to vaccination status. Because otherwise, if everything is
[38:32.360 --> 38:36.560]  reopened, then what's the carrot going to be? How are we going to incentivize people
[38:36.560 --> 38:40.480]  to actually get the vaccine? So that's why I think the CDC and the Biden administration
[38:40.480 --> 38:46.400]  need to get out. Let's lean on when our Lord and savior, our queen, our, our commander,
[38:46.400 --> 38:51.320]  and I've got all the stacks saying it doesn't protect you from COVID won't protect you.
[38:51.320 --> 38:54.440]  You'll still be locked down once you have it, but it's okay. They're going to lighten
[38:54.440 --> 39:01.680]  up a little bit before clamping back down. And we're used to stay in your house. Big
[39:01.680 --> 39:05.800]  police horses running women down the streets, police going into churches saying you're
[39:05.800 --> 39:12.720]  an unessential. And we just put up with this orgy of authoritarianism. You know, I guess
[39:12.720 --> 39:17.480]  I didn't go to the Bill Gates report yet. I'll have to get to it next segment. It's
[39:17.480 --> 39:26.560]  very, very important report. Just went live at band on video. Super villain Bill Gates
[39:26.560 --> 39:31.040]  plans to black out the sun. That's in his own press releases. Of course, we told you
[39:31.040 --> 39:38.520]  they were doing it over 20 years ago, but now it's all admitted. You know, I'm going
[39:38.520 --> 39:44.600]  to try to stay on air as long as I can. But I've been asked a lot like, what's it like
[39:44.600 --> 39:48.680]  to be vindicated? It's, it's, it's sickening because I wish we could have stopped this
[39:48.680 --> 39:53.920]  before we ever got to this point. It's not about how I've been vindicated. It's about
[39:53.920 --> 39:57.640]  this is the admitted globalist plan and they're carrying this out, but I'll tell you this
[39:57.640 --> 40:01.400]  for you and your family, they are going to release more viruses. They are going to release
[40:01.400 --> 40:06.000]  more weapons that are more serious than this. The globalists have said this. Professor says
[40:06.000 --> 40:14.640]  COVID-19 will be like a fond caress in comparison with the next pandemic. So everybody better
[40:14.640 --> 40:21.960]  get ready. Everybody better get prepared. Everybody better get their head screwed on
[40:21.960 --> 40:29.400]  straight because all of the stuff that happened before is gone now. Party time's over and
[40:29.400 --> 40:33.520]  the globalists are going to make their move. They're consolidating power. They're collapsing
[40:33.520 --> 40:38.080]  the first world. They're collapsing Main Street and people aren't doing anything. And so they're
[40:38.080 --> 40:45.160]  going to take that as a sign to go forward. It's their very nature. I would advise listeners
[40:45.160 --> 40:50.480]  to take care of your immune system, protect yourself, protect your family. A great way
[40:50.480 --> 40:55.800]  to do it is clear water, sunshine, praying to God's improvement in studies to help your
[40:55.800 --> 41:03.120]  overall well-being. And also, we have a great multivitamin mineral liquid system. It's
[41:03.120 --> 41:07.800]  vitamin mineral fusion with amino acids as well. Back in stock sold out for months, 40%

[41:55.960 --> 42:01.760]  not as strong as Rocket Rest or down and out, but they're all amazing. They naturally put

[42:33.000 --> 42:37.400]  not stay on air. All right. I'm going to hit this new Bill Gates news when we come back.
[42:37.400 --> 42:41.960]  Then I'm going to hit the race war they're pushing. Russia's foreign minister says they're
[42:41.960 --> 42:47.960]  launching anti-white racism in the U.S. part of a malice-backed cultural revolution, which
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.600]  is dead on accurate. That's coming up as well. And Charles Barkley knocks it out of the park
[42:52.600 --> 43:01.720]  on the stage racism as well. I knew Trump was in battle. I knew he was surrounded by
[43:01.720 --> 43:09.000]  black cowards and by double-talking agents of the enemy. And a lot of people just couldn't
[43:09.000 --> 43:14.560]  believe it. They're like, oh, no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible. And I understand
[43:14.560 --> 43:17.760]  why people are going to believe that because this is scaring what's going on. The global
[43:17.760 --> 43:21.160]  government in the New World Order. And now that people hold up the fact that that's real,
[43:21.160 --> 43:25.360]  they will somebody to come save them from. Well, Trump sure as hell tried. My gosh, look
[43:25.360 --> 43:29.680]  at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled, depending on the drug once
[43:29.680 --> 43:33.280]  you buy it and sign that executive order. We pay the most of anybody in the world. That's
[43:33.280 --> 43:37.480]  just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed. And now people are going to
[43:37.480 --> 43:42.440]  feel the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything else. But what's really illustrated
[43:42.440 --> 43:47.040]  this is the trial to the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting
[43:47.040 --> 43:52.240]  him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity
[43:52.240 --> 43:57.000]  because the fix is in, folks. The swamp is deep. Trump fought it, but it's up to us
[43:57.000 --> 44:02.920]  to win it. Vitamin mineral fusion is a remarkable product. And it's back in stock 40% off at

[44:58.480 --> 45:03.160]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything we've talked
[45:03.160 --> 45:06.840]  about has happened just like we said it would. And now we have a lot of credibility, but
[45:06.840 --> 45:10.560]  I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order. And it's because we have
[45:10.560 --> 45:14.920]  so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer. And I don't have
[45:14.920 --> 45:18.360]  time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons. I can't tell you
[45:18.360 --> 45:22.280]  what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through the end. We're
[45:22.280 --> 45:27.360]  going to stay on air as long as we can. So please pray for us and please buy the products
[45:27.360 --> 45:31.160]  and then forward score.com. They're great products. Plus, they fund the operation.
[45:31.160 --> 45:35.160]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great. Do they fund freedom?
[45:35.160 --> 45:40.120]  No, a lot of them don't. These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the
[45:40.120 --> 45:44.480]  whole world's waking up and looking for truth. That's why the globalists are censoring. They
[45:44.480 --> 45:48.480]  can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us from the air. So while you're
[45:48.480 --> 45:52.040]  at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word. Download everything we've
[45:52.040 --> 45:55.880]  done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[45:55.880 --> 45:58.520]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[45:58.520 --> 46:05.120]  The new world order is a planetary corporate plan for world government. But world government
[46:05.120 --> 46:11.520]  is only the control grid. Now, intermembers of the cult are told that they are going
[46:11.520 --> 46:17.080]  to transcend and become gods and attain immortality. But the price for that is to carry out the
[46:17.080 --> 46:23.360]  orderly extermination of all carbon based line forms. That's why they say carbon is
[46:23.360 --> 46:29.880]  bad. They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet. They are playing God.
[46:29.880 --> 46:36.640]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[46:36.640 --> 46:42.320]  to carry out this transformation. I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings
[46:42.320 --> 46:49.120]  of the globalists, it's all on record. You have been warned. You have been given the
[46:49.120 --> 46:55.640]  information to say no to this plan. This is the end of all life on earth as we know it.
[46:55.640 --> 47:01.080]  This is the alien takeover of earth.
[47:01.080 --> 47:08.080]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:31.080 --> 47:44.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host on this live Easter transmission. We're
[47:44.280 --> 47:52.120]  back live. Okay, so I'm going to explain this again as simply as I can. And I'm not saying
[47:52.120 --> 47:55.080]  that like you're dumb. I'm saying just for everybody out there that's tuning in for the
[47:55.080 --> 47:57.560]  first time.
[47:57.560 --> 48:02.720]  There is a scientific dictatorship that has made decisions about how to run our lives
[48:02.720 --> 48:08.760]  that is carrying out an eradication program like they do against fire ants or moths or
[48:08.760 --> 48:14.760]  starfish. And I've got all the government reports how they do that. And they even talk
[48:14.760 --> 48:23.800]  in these reports about how we've taken full control of human evolution and reproduction,
[48:23.800 --> 48:32.120]  but we haven't done it yet with all the animals and all the plants. And so now we've got to
[48:32.120 --> 48:33.120]  do it there.
[48:33.120 --> 48:41.120]  This is John Hopkins. Again, gene drives pursuing opportunities, minimizing risk. I spent two
[48:41.120 --> 48:47.920]  hours last night reading this and I already knew most of it, but it's just it's John Hopkins
[48:47.920 --> 48:54.840]  for the Rockefeller Foundation that runs the whole thing is in charge.
[48:54.840 --> 48:59.760]  And there's literally hundreds of these damn reports. I mean, I've only read dozens of
[48:59.760 --> 49:04.880]  them over the years. And what they say in these things, they do. This is more important
[49:04.880 --> 49:11.720]  than bills in Congress.
[49:11.720 --> 49:19.560]  In 1992, they gave a Nobel Prize to two scientists that were spraying aluminum dioxide, barium
[49:19.560 --> 49:25.440]  salts and other things out of jets. They would mix with the jet fuel and then the jets would
[49:25.440 --> 49:30.600]  release it. The airlines wouldn't even know what was going on. They would create this
[49:30.600 --> 49:36.800]  nuclei and then block the sun. You know that as chemtrails is the popular nomenclature
[49:36.800 --> 49:43.480]  for that.
[49:43.480 --> 49:48.360]  Well Bill Gates is all over every scientific publication admitting the Department of Energy
[49:48.360 --> 49:53.680]  since 1994 has been doing this. And now they've gotten countries to sign on worldwide tied
[49:53.680 --> 49:56.160]  to the U.S. dollar.
[49:56.160 --> 49:59.360]  But then you turn on the news, they say it doesn't exist. You're crazy. But I can show
[49:59.360 --> 50:06.400]  you C-Span with Clapper and Brennan and others on TV admitting they were doing this. So it's
[50:06.400 --> 50:07.400]  all ongoing.
[50:07.400 --> 50:14.720]  So here's a report that just went live at infowars.com and newswars.com. It's excellent,
[50:14.720 --> 50:21.040]  that Gregory's put together. That is super villain Bill Gates plans to block out the
[50:21.040 --> 50:27.320]  sun. And now because there's so much pressure, he quote, backed off. That was only the test
[50:27.320 --> 50:32.480]  he was doing in Sweden. It's already operational. And then I'm here reading real government
[50:32.480 --> 50:38.960]  documents and friends of mine go, come on Alex, they're not playing with the atmosphere.
[50:38.960 --> 50:44.120]  My Lord, this has been declassified for decades. It's like I talk to the public and it's like
[50:44.120 --> 50:48.880]  talking to children.
[50:48.880 --> 50:54.320]  And if you don't wake up and if you don't get informed, the globalists have no respect
[50:54.320 --> 50:59.440]  for you.
[50:59.440 --> 51:04.040]  The only way they have respect for you is if you know about this stuff and I'm a regular
[51:04.040 --> 51:13.680]  guy and I can read this all day long. Next hour I'll hit spars for you. But I'm going
[51:13.680 --> 51:21.120]  to tell you, I became physically sick reading this in the last few weeks. Because when I
[51:21.120 --> 51:26.880]  show you this, you think I want to come into your house and tell you horrible stuff like
[51:26.880 --> 51:34.800]  this, you think I like this, you think this is good for me to talk about this. But it's
[51:34.800 --> 51:40.040]  real and it's all of our futures together. Listen, it's not going to move slow anymore.
[51:40.040 --> 51:48.880]  It's going to move fast now. It's going to move fast now. It's not going to move slow
[51:48.880 --> 51:58.360]  anymore. And so I have three options. Join the globalists with hat in hand and wait out
[51:58.360 --> 52:01.400]  the extermination of almost everybody and I'll be killed in the end, I'm sure. But that's
[52:01.400 --> 52:12.440]  just a fool's way out. I'm not doing it. Be delusional and just be a regular idiot or
[52:12.440 --> 52:20.720]  fight this thing. Or I guess there's a fourth way, selfishly run off somewhere in the middle
[52:20.720 --> 52:27.280]  of nowhere and God is that inviting and just pretend like it isn't happening. But you know
[52:27.280 --> 52:37.000]  what? I'll be dug out of that hole soon enough. This is modern warfare. This is how we're
[52:37.000 --> 52:43.200]  attacked in the future. This is what happens. This is the reality. And I wish to all of
[52:43.200 --> 52:51.860]  you I was wrong. But I'm not. And they're arrogant because almost no one will read academic
[52:51.860 --> 52:59.200]  papers. Almost no one will read white papers. Almost no one will investigate this. And because
[52:59.200 --> 53:04.720]  of that, it's like a different language and we're basically wide open to attack. If you'll
[53:04.720 --> 53:10.280]  just learn the globalist language, if you'll just learn how they operate, we can then chart
[53:10.280 --> 53:14.160]  a better future together. And yeah, there's too many people some places and yeah, there's
[53:14.160 --> 53:17.800]  dumb people and yeah, we got problems. We don't set up a world government to kill everybody
[53:17.800 --> 53:21.320]  in the name of that, which then targets the smartest people, which shows that's not even
[53:21.320 --> 53:29.160]  really what they're trying to do. They are anti human, ladies and gentlemen. All right,
[53:29.160 --> 53:41.680]  here's a special report. No doubt you have realized the splendor of my consumption. First
[53:41.680 --> 53:49.720]  a necklace of death about the earth. 50 globes each releasing its nerve gas over a designated
[53:49.720 --> 53:58.120]  area. Each capable of killing 100 million people. The human race, as you know it, will
[53:58.120 --> 54:06.120]  cease to exist. Who needs a James Bond villain to kill everyone when media darling, eugenicist
[54:06.120 --> 54:13.520]  Bill Gates is off to such a celebrated start. While earning billions of dollars off his
[54:13.520 --> 54:20.840]  investments in the experimental vaccine industry, Bill Gates claims to be some sort of altruist
[54:20.840 --> 54:27.120]  and all of pop culture media support this spurious tale. But remember when Bill Gates
[54:27.120 --> 54:32.400]  became the world's richest man as a result of ruthless business practices and abuse of
[54:32.400 --> 54:40.440]  powers. And remember the world's most evil corporation, Monsanto, creators of DDT, Agent
[54:40.440 --> 54:46.760]  Orange and genetically modified foods, the company working tirelessly to replace all
[54:46.760 --> 54:52.640]  the world's organic seed banks with their own patented GMO varieties so they can one
[54:52.640 --> 55:00.000]  day own the entire world's food supply. Well now Monsanto, along with agribusiness giant
[55:00.000 --> 55:06.400]  Cargill, are primarily controlled by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is also
[55:06.400 --> 55:13.600]  the biggest farmland owner in the U.S. Bill Gates says we all must eat GMO food while
[55:13.600 --> 55:18.680]  aggressively working towards giving us no choice in the matter. The Bill and Melinda
[55:18.680 --> 55:24.840]  Gates Foundation sponsored the mRNA vaccines, which are now opening the gates to genetically
[55:24.840 --> 55:31.240]  modified humans, recklessly experimenting on the human genome in hundreds of millions
[55:31.240 --> 55:39.120]  of people. These experimental gene therapy shots have already killed thousands, but
[55:39.120 --> 55:47.480]  Bill wants everyone to get more. And now Bill is preparing to block out the sun. Bill Gates
[55:47.480 --> 55:53.440]  is working with Harvard's David Keith on a stratospheric solar geoengineering experiment
[55:53.440 --> 55:59.440]  known as Scopex, wherein a kilogram of calcium carbonate particles will be released in the
[55:59.440 --> 56:04.800]  stratosphere to see how viable it will be at reflecting the light from the sun away
[56:04.800 --> 56:09.120]  from the surface of the Earth. They claim they want to lower the temperature of the
[56:09.120 --> 56:14.720]  Earth, despite the fact that nobody has any idea what this could do to the overall system
[56:14.720 --> 56:21.080]  of the planet. Since the beginning of time, man has yearned to destroy the sun. I will
[56:21.080 --> 56:26.880]  do the next best thing. Block it out. In the film The Matrix, they tried to block out
[56:26.880 --> 56:33.600]  the sun in order to stop the man-made AI threat, but it ended up enslaving all of mankind
[56:33.600 --> 56:40.120]  in The Matrix. In the film Snowpiercer, the world tried blocking out the sun to stop global
[56:40.120 --> 56:46.840]  warming, but ended up triggering a cataclysmic ice age. And in the dystopian reality that
[56:46.840 --> 56:52.920]  we live in today, Bill Gates wants to save the world by blocking out the sun. We are
[56:52.920 --> 56:59.360]  told to trust him. We are told to trust the science, even though the so-called science
[56:59.360 --> 57:07.480]  is wildly theoretical, inconclusive, and universally challenged. Bill Gates does indeed embody
[57:07.480 --> 57:14.040]  the characteristics of an evil James Bond villain. But the real villains are obviously
[57:14.040 --> 57:20.960]  the degenerates of world governments and mainstream media who allow this damaged, deranged, old
[57:20.960 --> 57:27.560]  man in a pink sweater to play out his father's dreams of depopulation and eugenics on the
[57:27.560 --> 57:35.080]  world stage, while at the same time protecting the big banks and multinational corporations
[57:35.080 --> 57:42.080]  who are orchestrating this entire war against humanity. For infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[58:06.080 --> 58:11.320]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above
[58:11.320 --> 58:17.240]  it. America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom
[58:17.240 --> 58:22.160]  into one of total mass high-tech slavery. That's why the globalists tell us America
[58:22.160 --> 58:26.560]  was founded on slavery when it wasn't. They point out one of our evils so they can invert
[58:26.560 --> 58:31.640]  the fact that they are truly the slave masters. A global permanent lockdown this year is already
[58:31.640 --> 58:35.360]  causing millions and millions to starve to death. When they're done, billions will starve
[58:35.360 --> 58:39.680]  to death. Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have
[58:39.680 --> 58:44.280]  come out and said the covered lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war. That's
[58:44.280 --> 58:48.920]  the facts. This is the Bill Gates new world order weapon.
[58:48.920 --> 58:55.320]  The equation is very simple. The mega banks control the media, they control big pharma,
[58:55.320 --> 59:02.480]  they control academia, they control the military, industrial complex, they control big tech.
[59:02.480 --> 59:07.920]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they have established absolute
[59:07.920 --> 59:14.880]  total despotism and dehumanization. It is the western Christian idea of human freedom
[59:14.880 --> 59:19.200]  that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens
[59:19.200 --> 59:22.200]  them. So because they can't defeat that empowering
[59:22.200 --> 59:29.480]  ethic, they instead co-opted, turned it upside down and used the idea of equality to actually
[59:29.480 --> 59:35.840]  destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopoly of control.
[59:35.840 --> 59:39.920]  That's why they targeted infowars because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[59:39.920 --> 59:45.600]  The only way our transmission gets out is if you promote infowars and ban that video.
[59:45.600 --> 59:51.960]  So we double your efforts. We're all on this together.
[59:51.960 --> 59:53.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:26.640]  Now we're in the future. We're in the scientific world and there's a group that wants to take
[1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:30.080]  control of our destiny. They've already cracked the code to our genetics.
[1:00:30.080 --> 1:00:35.680]  They know how to create artificial humans. They don't respect us because we don't stand
[1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:39.920]  up for ourselves. And that's where I get frustrated.
[1:00:39.920 --> 1:00:45.720]  That's where I get upset is that people have to start standing up for the unborn. We have
[1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:49.240]  to start standing up for our very genetics. We have to start standing up for our species.
[1:00:49.240 --> 1:00:55.040]  And that's why the globalists, while they overturn humanity, while they play God, constantly
[1:00:55.040 --> 1:01:01.160]  tell us about our racism and about how bad we are and how we all hate each other using
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:04.360]  our tribalism against us before they annihilate us.
[1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:09.960]  I'm going to play Charles Barkley exposing the divide and conquer paradigm on the other
[1:01:09.960 --> 1:01:11.920]  side. It seems like a simple statement, but it's
[1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:16.680]  powerful and it's true and it's deep. And people aren't going to listen to me, but
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:19.800]  they may listen to him. So that's coming up next segment.
[1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:26.240]  And then I'm going to hit the spars pandemic and the parallels to it and John Hopkins
[1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:30.640]  and what they actually launched and how they admit that everything in this is basically
[1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:32.640]  what's really happening.
[1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:37.040]  But we're only partway into it. We're about a year and two months into it.
[1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:43.600]  There's another two years left on it and it talks about mass brain damage, mass death
[1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:50.840]  and the vaccines and how they're going to try to cover all that up.
[1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:57.320]  So it's pretty sick, as they say. But I want to hit another report that our
[1:01:57.320 --> 1:02:04.160]  crew shot down at the border, again, Gregory Sagan, of the massive illegal alien pipeline
[1:02:04.160 --> 1:02:06.840]  that violates federal law. There isn't even an executive order.
[1:02:06.840 --> 1:02:09.960]  It can be overturned by the courts. It's just Biden doing it.
[1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:13.920]  And that just shows you the nature of these individuals.
[1:02:13.920 --> 1:02:18.640]  So we're going to air that report. We're going to come back and go over this spars
[1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:25.440]  20, 25, 2028 report. We're going to look at how they're trying to create racial division
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:29.960]  on this manipulation that is all coming up on the other side.
[1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:33.960]  But please, no matter where you're listening or how you're listening, remember, your word
[1:02:33.960 --> 1:02:39.400]  of mouth is what circumvents big tech, your human action against the electronic through
[1:02:39.400 --> 1:02:46.440]  the electronic is what wins. We'll be right back.
[1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:52.000]  The mainstream media has been talking about a surge at the border, but the real story
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:58.200]  is a massive illegal immigration pipeline run by the Biden administration.
[1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:03.040]  We witnessed it running nonstop in McAllen, Texas.
[1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:09.080]  First border patrol delivers busloads of illegal immigrants to a secured tent processing
[1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:15.520]  center on the corner of U.S. Business 83 and West 15th Street.
[1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:21.320]  We are told by sources well over a thousand each night in this area alone. And what we
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:26.200]  witnessed during the day certainly substantiates this number.
[1:03:26.200 --> 1:03:31.520]  We were told by a driver of their operation that they are being tested for COVID-19 at
[1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:38.360]  this processing center. They all leave with Manila envelopes in hand.
[1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:43.400]  Things that do test positive for COVID are driven to one of the several hotels who have
[1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:48.520]  contracted with the federal government to act as COVID quarantine shelters, where they
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:53.960]  will quarantine for seven days before being released into the U.S.
[1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:59.280]  And the rest are either bust or walk down the street to the humanitarian respite center
[1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:04.480]  operated by Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, where they are brought in through
[1:04:04.480 --> 1:04:10.240]  the front door with their Manila envelopes inspected. They are housed, given bags of
[1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:16.880]  clothing, and are then sent off through the back door to various U.S. cities via bus and
[1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:23.200]  airplane. It's a nonstop flowing pipeline. Those that take the bus are led across the
[1:04:23.200 --> 1:04:28.560]  street to the bus station. And the rest are given rides to the airport where they present
[1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:34.200]  border patrol and TSA with the paperwork inside their Manila envelopes and set off to
[1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:39.640]  various U.S. cities where they are either meeting up with some other government agency
[1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:45.800]  and G.O. or perhaps even Mexican cartels operating within the U.S.
[1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:51.400]  It is the biggest illegal immigration smuggling operation in U.S. history. And it is being
[1:04:51.400 --> 1:04:56.800]  run by the federal government on behalf of the United Nations.
[1:04:56.800 --> 1:05:01.400]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world. They are creating insecurity, crime,
[1:05:01.400 --> 1:05:07.480]  war, and famine. All of this should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves
[1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:12.760]  and our family's sakes, but also our community. And CitizensStronghold.com is the best place
[1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:17.320]  to go to get high quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find. Again,

[1:05:53.240 --> 1:06:00.240]  Promo code ALICE and get 10% off.
[1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:30.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from Austin, Texas.
[1:06:31.840 --> 1:06:38.840]  Broadcasting, World Wide. It's Alex Jones. I saw the news break Friday afternoons. And
[1:06:43.360 --> 1:06:49.480]  Saturday, everybody was asking me, Jones, why have you covered this? Well, here we are
[1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:56.480]  on Sunday. I'm about to cover it. And it was Pete Buttigieg, the mayor from wherever.
[1:06:56.840 --> 1:07:03.340]  The Golden Boy, the guy that was never in combat, was a desk jockey, caught posing
[1:07:03.340 --> 1:07:09.840]  in combat gear claiming he was a combat veteran, just like Senator Blumenthal does famously.
[1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:15.160]  He was everything out of the U.S. Marines. He ran the Marine Corps Toys program for children
[1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:22.160]  in D.C., never left D.C. But the point is, these are frauds. Who thinks like this?
[1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:28.480]  So, I saw the footage on Friday, and then I didn't cover it on yesterday's emergency
[1:07:28.480 --> 1:07:32.520]  show, but we're here on Sunday, I'm about to cover it, because it's bigger than just
[1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:39.680]  him engaging fraud. It's about his disrespect for everyone. So, it was a big national story.
[1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:46.680]  Oh, Pete Buttigieg shows up at the White House to discuss gas taxes on everybody. China isn't
[1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:55.560]  going to have that. We're going to have that. Anything to shut us down.
[1:07:55.560 --> 1:08:02.560]  Pete Buttigieg, the little chipmunk-like creature, has no credibility, no background, total fraud,
[1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:08.320]  caught lying constantly, but he's gay. It's like, well, then let him run death camps.
[1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:12.120]  I mean, Tim Cook runs the biggest death camps in China with the Uyghurs, but I mean, he's
[1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:18.720]  gay, so it's like, all right, he's gay, it's all right. Pete Buttigieg.
[1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:26.520]  And so, Pete Buttigieg is on the tape, let's roll it for TV viewers, and these big armored
[1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:33.800]  black SUVs pull over. We're talking three blocks from the White House, and all these
[1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:40.440]  men in mass stand around him, and then he's got his little cool suit on, he's Wonder Boy,
[1:08:40.440 --> 1:08:47.440]  and then he just zooms off and is all over the news. And there he is, like the wicked
[1:08:50.280 --> 1:08:57.280]  witch shooting down the road to all these photos about, look at him, he is good, he
[1:08:57.280 --> 1:09:04.280]  hates the combustion engine, a cynical, arrogant, hateful move, hating his constituents, thinking
[1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:17.480]  we're stupid, and arrogantly thinking no one's gonna catch me pulling over with all these
[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:24.480]  armored SUVs, and even having an ununiform protector with him, like he's that important
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:32.280]  in the Department of Transportation. All of them are like imperial Chinese emperors
[1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:39.280]  now, and then all of these SUVs protecting him as he rides down the road on his bike,
[1:09:39.280 --> 1:09:46.280]  and then National News is like, look at him, he rode 20 miles from his house in Maryland,
[1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:54.280]  he is so good, and he staged the whole thing. So I went on Twitter, Saturday, yesterday,
[1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:06.280]  look at this, and the left was like big deal, so what? But again, who would think like that?
[1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:13.280]  Who would behave like that? Someone who has no real integrity, someone who's a predator,
[1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:22.280]  he doesn't have a way of life like yours, he doesn't have a future like yours, he doesn't
[1:10:22.280 --> 1:10:27.280]  have children, he doesn't want to have a future with you, he's a predator staring out of his
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:34.280]  godless, empty eyes, figuring out how can I look good, how can I manipulate people?
[1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:41.280]  He's a Chinese Communist agent, just like Joe Biden, just like everybody else that serves
[1:10:48.280 --> 1:10:53.280]  this system, they have bowed down to tyranny, and they have no bottom.
[1:10:53.280 --> 1:10:57.280]  And I have a lot of news to cover, and I want to get into this big government document,
[1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:02.280]  this is a government funded document, this Rockefeller Rothschild Bill Gates document,
[1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:07.280]  this sparse pandemic, 2025, 2028, that's a holy grail of understanding the enemy,
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:14.280]  but I want to play this clip. I mean, it's like a 15 minute clip, the full things at
[1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:23.280]  infowars.com, but I want to play a few minutes of it. This is by Canadian, we're going to
[1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:27.280]  do the Canadian pastor coming up next segment, getting the face of the lockdown and what they
[1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:34.280]  were doing as well. But where's that particular clip I wanted?
[1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:44.280]  You're a genius, number seven, oh yes, advice for people running Biden. Description, J.P. Sears
[1:11:44.280 --> 1:11:50.280]  has some words for people running Joe Biden, this is powerful, I ran into him on the Huygens
[1:11:50.280 --> 1:11:54.280]  bike trail, he actually lives here in Austin, he escaped LA a long time ago, but he's scared
[1:11:54.280 --> 1:11:59.280]  to have me on, that's fine, he's a really smart guy, and he does it in a properly deferential,
[1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:04.280]  groveling fashion, which makes it even more powerful, I wish I was as slick as him, here
[1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:07.280]  it is. This message is for the swell people running
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:14.280]  President Biden, hi guys, you're doing a phenomenal job, I mean things are looking so good, I
[1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:20.280]  mean he's dominating, so great, which means you guys are doing a great job. Now after
[1:12:20.280 --> 1:12:26.280]  watching his performance at the recent press conference, I'd give him an A, great job,
[1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:31.280]  so solid, but I wanted to sit down with you here today and watch the game film and offer
[1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:37.280]  you some advice on how he could get to an A plus next time, so let's see if we can find
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:42.280]  any areas with room for improvement. In this clip you'll see the President openly and
[1:12:42.280 --> 1:12:46.280]  honestly expressing his own thoughts from note cards.
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:52.280]  We have somewhere, I asked the staff to write it down for me and they did, not for this,
[1:12:52.280 --> 1:13:02.280]  but for a longer discussion, we have somewhere in terms of infrastructure, we rank 13th globally
[1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:08.280]  in infrastructure. Sometimes when someone's just reading off note cards, it makes people
[1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:14.280]  wonder, why do you have to read off note cards? But before we get to some advice on this, let's
[1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:18.280]  take a look at a clip of Joe answering a question on North Korea.
[1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:28.280]  Let me say that number one, the UN resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles
[1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:37.280]  that were tested, number one. We're consoling with our allies and partners and there will
[1:13:37.280 --> 1:13:48.280]  be responses if they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly. But I'm also prepared
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:58.280]  for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization.
[1:13:58.280 --> 1:14:05.280]  So guys, Joe read the entire answer from a note card, and powerfully so, I might add.
[1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:10.280]  Next time, you might want to have Joe not read off note cards for a couple reasons.
[1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:16.280]  One, having the exact answer to a reporter's question pre-written kind of makes it look
[1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:21.280]  like you knew the questions beforehand. So it kind of looked as if you pre-wrote questions,
[1:14:21.280 --> 1:14:28.280]  gave them to friendly reporters to ask Biden and then Biden read pre-written answers from
[1:14:28.280 --> 1:14:33.280]  note cards. And that kind of makes the whole press conference look more like a theatrical
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:38.280]  performance than an actual press conference. People don't like deception.
[1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:44.280]  And it also makes people aware that he's not speaking his own thoughts from his own mind.
[1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:47.280]  The other thing is when he had the president reading off note cards that were magically
[1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:52.280]  pre-written in the past to answer present moment questions, he's looking down the whole time.
[1:14:52.280 --> 1:15:00.280]  In normal human communication, looking at someone, possibly even in the eyes, creates a connection.
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:04.280]  A note for improvement. Instead of using note cards and cheat sheets to try to convey the
[1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:07.280]  image of a functioning mind, just use a teleprompter.
[1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:13.280]  Now you might be saying, teleprompter, those are for pre-written speeches, not press conferences
[1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:16.280]  with unknown questions and off the cuff answers.
[1:15:16.280 --> 1:15:25.280]  Well, we just call this what it is. Then use a teleprompter. That's my professional advice.
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:30.280]  Oh, and that brings up another area with room for improvement. At a press conference, when
[1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:36.280]  the president's looking out at a sea of reporters calling on someone to ask a question, they
[1:15:36.280 --> 1:15:38.280]  usually don't look like this.
[1:15:38.280 --> 1:15:45.280]  Now I'll be happy to take your questions.
[1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:49.280]  Zeke and Associated Press. Justin.
[1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:55.280]  All totally rigged, all totally staged, and they're all happy to do it.

[1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:49.280]  Thank you.
[1:19:49.280 --> 1:20:16.280]  Thank you.
[1:20:16.280 --> 1:20:38.280]  Thank you.
[1:20:38.280 --> 1:20:48.280]  Now let's look at a document from 2017.
[1:20:48.280 --> 1:21:01.280]  And in that 2017 document, John Hopkins University, that again is the main group that works for
[1:21:01.280 --> 1:21:16.280]  this program.
[1:21:16.280 --> 1:21:22.280]  They even use the same names of the viruses, the same names of everything. They even put
[1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:27.280]  out tweets drilling it at the time. I'm going to show you that right now. Now why would they
[1:21:27.280 --> 1:21:32.280]  do this? Well, they've got to get all these agencies and groups involved in a drill. They're
[1:21:32.280 --> 1:21:36.280]  not telling them they're staging it. They're not telling them they launched it. And they've
[1:21:36.280 --> 1:21:42.280]  got to have this so governments and intelligence agencies that see it think, oh, they're just
[1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:49.280]  doing a drill. And this is done over and over again. This is one-on-one stuff in intelligence
[1:21:49.280 --> 1:21:58.280]  research. So here it is, the sparse pandemic 2025, 2028. We can put up that first slide
[1:21:58.280 --> 1:22:08.280]  there. And I'll just flip to the next one. Exercise completion date, October 2017. Before
[1:22:08.280 --> 1:22:15.280]  event 201, 2019, which is exactly what happened. And before crimson contagion that happened
[1:22:15.280 --> 1:22:21.280]  before that, run by the same groups, same organizations, World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab,
[1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:30.280]  John Hopkins, Bill Gates, all of them. Let's move on. Here are the three groups right here.
[1:22:30.280 --> 1:22:39.280]  Next, sparse 2025, 2028. Spars originated from Far East, which labeled St. Paul Acute
[1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:52.280]  respiratory syndrome. Spars COVID-V. COVID-19 originated from China, originally called China
[1:22:52.280 --> 1:23:01.280]  virus or Wuhan, SARS COVID-2. You'll see they even have almost the same prefixes there.
[1:23:01.280 --> 1:23:10.280]  Here's where it gets crazy. Spars 2025, 2028. Spars inflated fatality estimates. They say
[1:23:10.280 --> 1:23:16.280]  in the document that they're going to inflate fatality to 4%, which they then did with COVID,
[1:23:16.280 --> 1:23:26.280]  which wasn't true. Who fatality rate 14.5 under 64, fatality rate 50% over 64, actual rate
[1:23:26.280 --> 1:23:32.280]  0.06, which is what it basically came out to. This is three years before they launched
[1:23:32.280 --> 1:23:38.280]  it. They had already pre-planned even the responses because it's all bull. COVID-19
[1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:44.280]  inflated fatality estimates. Imperial College, Bill Gates, same people, 2.2 million U.S.
[1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:51.280]  deaths, 507,000 U.K., who fatality rate 2%, but they'd estimated as high as a 4%, which
[1:23:51.280 --> 1:23:56.280]  is what they put in the document. This is impossible, folks, because none of the numbers
[1:23:56.280 --> 1:24:00.280]  are real. Even our responses in lower numbers are numbers they came up with. I wonder why
[1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:07.280]  is the New York Times saying 94% of people didn't die of it, only 6%. They say in here,
[1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:15.280]  three years before that, 6% only died, 94 didn't die. They even had the, because they
[1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:19.280]  knew we'd know it was a fraud, so they didn't just have the official number, they then had
[1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:23.280]  a fake number, which the news wouldn't say, and then we would put that out thinking we
[1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:30.280]  had countered it when none of it was true. You pull up the New York Times headline, only
[1:24:30.280 --> 1:24:39.280]  6% of those listed as COVID deaths died of COVID. That's in the headlines New York Times.
[1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:45.280]  Three years before they even released it, four years, five years before where we are now,
[1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:51.280]  they have the exact number again, but it gets crazier. One listener said it's like getting
[1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:56.280]  the Death Star plans, but they call it the Death Spar. You just change one letter in the
[1:24:56.280 --> 1:24:59.280]  name of it, you know, well, you don't really have the Death Star plans, you have the Death
[1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:15.280]  Spar plans. Spars 2025, 2028, Spars, October 2025, Spars emerges, January 2026, U.S. government
[1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:21.280]  contracts send bio to produce Spars vaccine, real world, again, this is all three years
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:28.280]  changed, December 31, 2019, COVID-19 identified, April 2020, U.S. government launches Operation
[1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:32.280]  War Speed, they talk about how they're going to speed it all up the same way and get accelerated
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:39.280]  authorization. Spars 2025, 2028, antivirals, now this is where it gets crazy, this is
[1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:48.280]  three years before this even started, four and a half years before now. Spars, Colossivir,
[1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:56.280]  side effects, nausea, headaches, vomiting and body aches, COVID-19, Rindesivir, they say
[1:25:56.280 --> 1:26:03.280]  it just was developed, just came out last year for this, three plus years before, Colossivir,
[1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:09.280]  Rindesivir, nausea, constipation, vomiting, sweating, shivering basically the same way.
[1:26:09.280 --> 1:26:14.280]  Even the same name folks, it's worse, they barely even changed, they changed two letters
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:22.280]  coming up. Massive power outage, they get into predictions of that, vaccine propaganda
[1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:27.280]  campaign, spars, big tech celebrities, the president, hip-hop stars, MSM, global health
[1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:38.280]  expert, John Legrand, run DMC Bill Gates, Ryan Reynolds, Dr. Fauci, MSM Surgeon General,
[1:26:38.280 --> 1:26:45.280]  all the same. Medical countermeasures, MCM, that's the censorship, several sections and
[1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:50.280]  appendices are devoted to dealing with public pushback from changing guidelines, viral
[1:26:50.280 --> 1:26:57.280]  videos, social media post and maintaining trust in government. Social media countermeasures,
[1:26:57.280 --> 1:27:02.280]  14, now remember, this was all the real things they said, this is three years before this
[1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:08.280]  even started, 14 days to stop the spread, other documents say masks, they don't say
[1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:13.280]  masks, no masks and yes masks they say, big techs, they were following this, they were
[1:27:13.280 --> 1:27:18.280]  following this, no we don't do masks, later masks, big tech censorship of doctors,
[1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:23.280]  massive platforming, using fact-checking orgs to debunk owned by Big Pharma against
[1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:30.280]  government narrative MSM Big Pharma ads. Because Big Pharma is like, we're not just
[1:27:30.280 --> 1:27:34.280]  going to be your main sponsor now, you've got to help censor, vaccine side effects,
[1:27:34.280 --> 1:27:39.280]  spars, six months side effects begin in adults, what does Sherry Tempani doctor say?
[1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:46.280]  Less than two years side effects in children, encephalitis and mental retardation,
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:52.280]  prions, protein growth in the brain, now there's mainline medical studies saying it's
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:57.280]  growing plaques in people's brains and if you already have an Alzheimer's plaque in
[1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:04.280]  your brain, it's protein growth in the brain, this accelerates it.
[1:28:04.280 --> 1:28:14.280]  Vaccine effects, these are real numbers, 50,000 adverse effects, 2,249 deaths, 7,726
[1:28:14.280 --> 1:28:19.280]  serious injuries, you're going to suffer 4,000, you go to the drill, they estimate similar
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:28.280]  numbers, now that's just a boil down of the document itself, I'm going to show you
[1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:33.280]  these quotes from the document when we come back, I'm going to show you stuff even worse,
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:38.280]  okay, this is all wargamed out, so everything they said has come through so far in the
[1:28:38.280 --> 1:28:43.280]  scenario, that's really the script, the blueprint, next within a few months you see the
[1:28:43.280 --> 1:28:47.280]  mass brain damage, the mass death and all of it, which they say weighs down society
[1:28:47.280 --> 1:28:51.280]  and it's good because it collapses civilization to have a lower carbon footprint, which
[1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:59.280]  Claas Schwab is now already saying, says Cove is going to help us get rid of humans.
[1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:04.280]  Look I've proven that M-Fault Wars information is some of the best in the world, it's just
[1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:08.280]  absolutely on target, the globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they
[1:29:08.280 --> 1:29:12.280]  operate, they want to keep you in the dark, I believe in humanity, I want to see you at
[1:29:12.280 --> 1:29:18.280]  powered because I know that John F Kennedy was right, a raising tide raises all ships.
[1:29:18.280 --> 1:29:23.280]  Now, the supplements, the vitamins, the minerals, the compounds we have, the M-FaultWars.com
[1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:29.280]  are the very best sourced, wild crafted, organic and natural products you're going to
[1:29:29.280 --> 1:29:34.280]  find anywhere, whether it's natural defense, or whether it's Ultra-12, or whether it's
[1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:40.280]  X2, or DNA Force Plus, or Prostagard, or Vazelbeats, these are all cutting edge, top
[1:29:40.280 --> 1:29:45.280]  of the line products that will help you and your family at the same time from the M-FaultWars.

[1:29:56.280 --> 1:30:02.280]  The equation is very simple, the mega banks control the media, they control big pharma,
[1:30:02.280 --> 1:30:09.280]  they control academia, they control the military, industrial complex, they control big tech.
[1:30:09.280 --> 1:30:15.280]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they have established absolute
[1:30:15.280 --> 1:30:22.280]  total despotism and dehumanization. It is the western Christian idea of human freedom that
[1:30:22.280 --> 1:30:27.280]  ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[1:30:27.280 --> 1:30:33.280]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside
[1:30:33.280 --> 1:30:40.280]  down, and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[1:30:40.280 --> 1:30:45.280]  that threatens their monopolies of control. That's why they target M-FaultWars, because
[1:30:45.280 --> 1:30:50.280]  we understand the keys to defeating them. But the only way our transmission gets out is if
[1:30:50.280 --> 1:30:56.280]  you promote M-FaultWars and hand out video. So redouble your efforts, we're all in this together.
[1:30:56.280 --> 1:31:04.280]  I actually bought this at Blocks UHS frequency. Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:11.280]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[1:31:11.280 --> 1:31:19.280]  With or without a battery. Now with the InfoWars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[1:31:19.280 --> 1:31:26.280]  Excellent. Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.

[1:31:35.280 --> 1:31:41.280]  contact tracers are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
[1:31:41.280 --> 1:31:46.280]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.

[1:31:56.280 --> 1:32:03.280]  You cannot hide a grand assault. America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed,
[1:32:03.280 --> 1:32:11.280]  its dollar brought down to nothing. All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team.
[1:32:11.280 --> 1:32:19.280]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are. So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God,
[1:32:19.280 --> 1:32:26.280]  stop living in fear. The enemy is about to expose itself. The enemy can't help itself.
[1:32:26.280 --> 1:32:34.280]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy. We sit here as good people get upset about that.
[1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:41.280]  We're trying to stop it and we should, but once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us
[1:32:41.280 --> 1:32:46.280]  and raping us and attacking us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[1:32:46.280 --> 1:32:52.280]  So prepare yourselves, America. You're going under judge by just like all the children that were aborted.
[1:32:52.280 --> 1:33:08.280]  This is the truth. This is the InfoWars.
[1:33:08.280 --> 1:33:22.280]  The planet does have problems. We've done thousands of nuclear tests. We've overfished.
[1:33:22.280 --> 1:33:26.280]  We've done incredible amounts of toxic waste in the ocean. We've cut down most of the forest,
[1:33:26.280 --> 1:33:34.280]  but the Earth can regenerate from that. It can't handle genetic engineering taking it over and these bad scientists playing God.
[1:33:34.280 --> 1:33:40.280]  They say they're about to call the planet to save the planet, but really in their own documents they admit,
[1:33:40.280 --> 1:33:45.280]  it's about their mad dash to play God and they actually say in their deeper admissions, which are public,
[1:33:45.280 --> 1:33:53.280]  that, oh, we don't even care about the whole planet. We're just using it to metamorphosize into our new God form.
[1:33:53.280 --> 1:34:07.280]  And so my point is you could argue with them at face level, argue with them of what they claim they're doing and it's a fraud.
[1:34:07.280 --> 1:34:14.280]  But when you actually study who they are, these people should not be toilet attendants much less running the whole future of the planet.
[1:34:14.280 --> 1:34:19.280]  And that's what I'm saying. It's up to those of us that are intelligent, those of us that are successful,
[1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:24.280]  those of us that actually have a vision and want to keep humanity in the loop to stand up and say to the globalist,
[1:34:24.280 --> 1:34:33.280]  you are not in control of our destiny. You need to be in a mental institution, not running the planet.
[1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:43.280]  So we came in here into the two hour taping yesterday and didn't even cover the surface of it.
[1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:49.280]  But is it really up to me to tell you every damn bit of this? I mean, you should want to know about this.
[1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:55.280]  If I'm up here reading you documents 10 years ago that came true word for word, you don't want to listen to what Alex Jones said.
[1:34:55.280 --> 1:35:00.280]  You want to go see what the Rockefeller Foundation or John Hopkins said.
[1:35:00.280 --> 1:35:09.280]  Because they've been trying to get control of the planet for a long time and now they're getting that control.
[1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:15.280]  So you go to church and you pray to Jesus because you were brought up to teach that's the higher power and God is real.
[1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:20.280]  But hey, these people are as close as you're going to get to God when it comes to running your life.
[1:35:20.280 --> 1:35:24.280]  You might want to find out what they're up to and you might want to just get on their level,
[1:35:24.280 --> 1:35:38.280]  at least at the point of being able to debate them about what they're doing because they don't even regard you until you talk to them at their level.
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:42.280]  And then when you're at their level, they just beg you to join them.
[1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:50.280]  Then they have respect for you. I don't know why you want their respect, but I'm telling you, they do not respect those of you that wear ignorance like a shield.
[1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:54.280]  You're invincible ignorance.
[1:35:54.280 --> 1:36:04.280]  It invokes them like wolves to sheep or sharks to blood or flies to SH, you know what?
[1:36:04.280 --> 1:36:07.280]  So let's get into it.
[1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:13.280]  Here is the John Hopkins document that we've been mentioning at Great Link.
[1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:16.280]  You can go read it for yourself. It's linked on infohorses.com and newshorses.com.
[1:36:16.280 --> 1:36:26.280]  Here's the 2025, 2028 spars report and even how they're going to respond to you dying of cancer and all the rest of it.
[1:36:26.280 --> 1:36:28.280]  Now they're going to make it a constant lab.
[1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:34.280]  But here are some actual quotes out of the document instead of just the slide I showed you that was also quotes.
[1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:45.280]  After showing no adverse side effects for nearly a year, vaccine recipients slowly begin to experience symptoms of mad cow disease.
[1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:53.280]  Which I then have mainline studies saying, mainline scientists look at this and go, this protein's a mad cow protein.
[1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:56.280]  What are you doing? That's crazy.
[1:36:56.280 --> 1:36:59.280]  Like chief scientist of Pfizer quit and went public.
[1:36:59.280 --> 1:37:03.280]  I mean, Merck pulled out of this and said, are you nuts?
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:08.280]  And again, you're like, well, Gates will go to prison. No, you get enough people to take the vaccine.
[1:37:08.280 --> 1:37:10.280]  They're not going to say they were wrong.
[1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:14.280]  Most people I've learned when they get brain damage are going to like defend it.
[1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:19.280]  They're not going to, because the general public never wants to admit they're wrong.
[1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:22.280]  See, this is psychology. It's a major gamble by Gates and others.
[1:37:22.280 --> 1:37:26.280]  But I think unless we stand up to them, they're going to win actually.
[1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:28.280]  They've almost got half the public vaccinated.
[1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:30.280]  Most other countries aren't taking it. It's us.
[1:37:30.280 --> 1:37:33.280]  Let's just take America out. We're getting our lobotomy right now.
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:36.280]  You think they just put fluoride in the water and Harvard admits it lowers IQ?
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:38.280]  And they don't know, this is the next level.
[1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:43.280]  This is like, well, fluoride didn't work. We'll give them this.
[1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:51.280]  As time passed and more people across the United States were vaccinated, claims of adverse side effects began to emerge.
[1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:53.280]  These are quotes from the document.
[1:37:53.280 --> 1:38:03.280]  As the investigators and investigations grew more intense, several high-ranking officials at the CDC and FDA were forced to step down and withdraw from government.
[1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:05.280]  They have admit we're going to burn a few puppets.
[1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:14.280]  Nearing the end of 2027, that means 2025, 2023, excuse me, reports of new neurological symptoms began to emerge.
[1:38:14.280 --> 1:38:19.280]  Patients claimed that their children were experiencing neurological symptoms.
[1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:30.280]  That month, the group of parents whose children developed mental retardation as a result of encephalopathy in the wake of the CoronaVax vaccination.
[1:38:30.280 --> 1:38:34.280]  Remember, CoronaVax, not the COVID, the Corona.
[1:38:34.280 --> 1:38:36.280]  It was called Corona first.
[1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:39.280]  They said, don't call it Corona. It's too obvious. Change the name.
[1:38:39.280 --> 1:38:50.280]  CoronaVax vaccinations suit the federal government demanding removal of the liability shield protecting the pharmaceutical companies responsible for developing and manufacturing CoronaVax.
[1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:52.280]  What are we doing now trying to stop them?
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:56.280]  The fact the majority of U.S. citizens willing to be vaccinated had already been immunized.
[1:38:56.280 --> 1:39:04.280]  The negative publicity surrounding adverse reactions had little effect on nationwide vaccination rates because they'd already hit everybody.
[1:39:04.280 --> 1:39:07.280]  You see, and people don't want to admit what happened.
[1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:20.280]  As these cases emerged, patients began filing the compensation under the PREP Act set by Reagan due to lingering uncertainties over possible links between vaccination, reported neurological symptoms.
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:29.280]  Their compensation requests were placed on a definite hold, pending further data analysis, which will never come because they skipped the trials.
[1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:38.280]  This cohort, many of whom adamantly supported the CoronaVax vaccine, initially quickly took the social media to publicize their issues.
[1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:42.280]  That's why they say, before we launch it, we must take them all offline.
[1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:54.280]  Today, nearly five years since the St. Paul Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus made its global debut, there remain human cases in 14 countries across Europe, Africa and Asia.
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:40:04.280]  As the pandemic tapered off, several influential politicians and age representatives came under fire for sensationalizing severity of the event for perceived political gain.
[1:40:04.280 --> 1:40:12.280]  So they say upfront we're going to exaggerate it, then we'll burn a few minions, but they won't care if they'll live in Switzerland and $50 million houses.
[1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:25.280]  President Archer's declarations in the Republican Party seized the opportunity to publicly disparage the president's administration's response, the pandemic, using voters to elect a strong leader with the best interests of the American people in heart.
[1:40:25.280 --> 1:40:32.280]  Archer served as vice president under the president Jacqueline Bennett, these are Democrats, who did not seek a second term to help concerns.
[1:40:32.280 --> 1:40:41.280]  See, it all mirrors this. CDC advisory committee on immunization, practice ACIP identified the following priority groups for immunization.
[1:40:41.280 --> 1:40:51.280]  Children aged 1 to 18, young adults 19, 22, and chronic respiratory conditions and a pregnant woman, who they then just say, well, we don't know why your baby died.
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:56.280]  We don't know why your kid's autistic. We don't know. Well, you already had a respiratory thing, so you die from this. It doesn't matter.
[1:40:56.280 --> 1:41:06.280]  To determine how best to distribute limited doses of Coronavax to members, priority groups across the country, the U.S. government restored to new controversial tactics,
[1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:24.280]  notably having health care providers access patients, electronic health records, which they're now all doing, getting rid of HIPAA, putting an all in a Chinese database to determine the number of individuals in high-risk populations receiving care in particular areas.
[1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:35.280]  Furthermore, the cases arose from the initial cohort of vaccine recipients, those in high-risk populations, including those who offer underlying health conditions, making it increasingly difficult to determine the extent to which symptoms were associated with vaccination.
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:42.280]  Oh, you shot up the sick people, the old people, get rid of them first, so you can't really tell how convenient.
[1:41:42.280 --> 1:41:57.280]  After action reports, government hearings and agency reviews follow the pandemics, where two numbers to count. Several side effects, including swollen legs, which is all happening, severe joint pain, and encephalopphemous brain damage resulted in seizures and other seizure disorders or death.
[1:41:57.280 --> 1:42:15.280]  Oh, in effort to further reach certain population subgroups, agency officials enlisted the help of well-known scientists, celebrities, and government officials to make short videos about the clips online that goes into how to counter conspiracy theorists and how to shut down free speech.
[1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:18.280]  We'll tell you about that when we come back.
[1:42:18.280 --> 1:42:28.280]  And so we're about a year into this, there's two more years, and they tell you the brain damage, the mad cow, all of it, and how they're going to cover it up and how you're going to enjoy it.
[1:42:28.280 --> 1:42:34.280]  And then they hit you with the next big plug that's even worse, because you learn to stay in your houses while they kill you.
[1:42:34.280 --> 1:42:40.280]  So take your vaccines, wear your mask, especially the left, stay in your houses.
[1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:44.280]  Actually, Bill Gates is giving us a favor. It's the left we're about to kill.
[1:42:44.280 --> 1:42:52.280]  Actually, Bill Gates is good. Yes, liberals. Take your vaccines, Democrats. Take them. Give them to your children, too.
[1:42:52.280 --> 1:43:15.280]  Love it.
[1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:29.280]  They have massively expanded their factories. It's made right here in America, and they're ready to ship it to right now.

[1:45:56.280 --> 1:46:11.280]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World. Even before I had an access to a show in the mid-90s, I wouldn't call that movie and thought, man, that was fun.
[1:46:11.280 --> 1:46:19.280]  In fact, you speak out, have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real. Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[1:46:19.280 --> 1:46:29.280]  We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge or so real.
[1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:38.280]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth. I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do. The globalists love lying to you. They love manipulating you. They enjoy destroying humanity.
[1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:46.280]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them. That for me is really such a disgusting.
[1:46:46.280 --> 1:46:56.280]  You've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew that we will never join the globalists. We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:22.280]  All right, it's the last segment of the Alice Jones Show on the Sunday edition.
[1:47:22.280 --> 1:47:29.280]  Oh, Troyer's about to take over with Sunday Live for two hours of calls, guests, analysis.
[1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:34.280]  And yeah, I'm going to go to the border tomorrow. I'm going to be driving down there for the next five hours.
[1:47:34.280 --> 1:47:42.280]  So I'll be down at the border because it's just too epic to bring the children all living in the dirt under bridges and illegal compounds.
[1:47:42.280 --> 1:47:48.280]  I'm supposed to cover it. Total blackouts on it. It's just insane.
[1:47:48.280 --> 1:47:55.280]  So look for all that tomorrow. James O'Keefe's coming back on the show tomorrow, but Owen Troyer is going to be hosting my regular show.
[1:47:55.280 --> 1:48:00.280]  I'll be calling in from the road, but I've just got to go down there and put eyes on it myself.
[1:48:00.280 --> 1:48:07.280]  I'll also do things, all legal, but my crew won't do. I don't ask them to do things that I will do.
[1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:16.280]  But let's just say that you'll want to be tuned in the next few days to m4wars.com, newswars.com, and band.video.
[1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:22.280]  So here's highlights of the Spars John Hopkins document we've been reading.
[1:48:22.280 --> 1:48:27.280]  Got this whole one over here about putting chemicals in the water to sterilize you and your family.
[1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:29.280]  But here's this one.
[1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:33.280]  And on the last page, it gets really interesting here.
[1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:38.280]  It says conspiracy theorists also proliferate across social media,
[1:48:38.280 --> 1:48:43.280]  suggesting that the virus had been purposely created and introduced to the population by drug companies
[1:48:43.280 --> 1:48:47.280]  or had been escaped from a government lab secretly testing bio weapons.
[1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:54.280]  It was a huge controversy two years before that at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where Fauci and Gates, you can look it up,
[1:48:54.280 --> 1:49:01.280]  were doing gain of function SARS, COVID virus, gain of function testing.
[1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:04.280]  And they moved it to Wuhan and that was run by them.
[1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:11.280]  That's the scientist nature of the Newsweek, the New York Times.
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:15.280]  Even five years ago, we still had six years ago, some ethics in media.
[1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:21.280]  It was like all these scientists, this is dangerous, this is illegal, it shouldn't be moved to China.
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:27.280]  This is like a known thing they did, kind of like UT stadiums in Central Austin at UT.
[1:49:27.280 --> 1:49:32.280]  It's like New York City is in New York City.
[1:49:32.280 --> 1:49:38.280]  It's like all hidden in plain view, like we're complete morons.
[1:49:38.280 --> 1:49:43.280]  And they say in here, the conspiracy theorists will say it came out of a lab,
[1:49:43.280 --> 1:49:46.280]  knowing they're going to do it, they're going to release it.
[1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:48.280]  Yeah, there's Newsweek.
[1:49:48.280 --> 1:49:52.280]  Dr. Fauci back controversial Wuhan lab at US dollars for risky coronavirus research.
[1:49:52.280 --> 1:49:54.280]  I mean, give me a break.
[1:49:54.280 --> 1:50:00.280]  Here's the deal, you guys, why would they write all this down?
[1:50:00.280 --> 1:50:06.280]  The most dangerous thing is to have battle plans for your scientists and your people.
[1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:10.280]  Because then you'll all go to prison for premeditation.
[1:50:10.280 --> 1:50:14.280]  But if you call it a drill, have them drill, then you put a story out, have them follow it,
[1:50:14.280 --> 1:50:16.280]  they're not even sure what they're doing.
[1:50:16.280 --> 1:50:20.280]  Though the Davos groups like, hey, it gets rid of carbon footprint and rid of people,
[1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:25.280]  it's bringing in world government, aren't you glad, you know, hey, we did it, okay, we did.
[1:50:25.280 --> 1:50:27.280]  You know, they're going like, oh, we did, okay.
[1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:32.280]  So, but they don't say it outright, except when Claude Schwab does.
[1:50:32.280 --> 1:50:37.280]  Because villains have to do a little bit of monologue, you know, they have to brag how they did it.
[1:50:37.280 --> 1:50:41.280]  I was a kid growing up, I was like, why does the villain always monologue when they kill somebody?
[1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:43.280]  And then I learned, no, they actually do that.
[1:50:43.280 --> 1:50:48.280]  Whether it's Goldfinger and James Bond or whether it's Bill Gates in the real world, they monologue.
[1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:51.280]  And they tell you how they did it and why they did it.
[1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:54.280]  It's part of their psychology, it's part of their MO.
[1:50:54.280 --> 1:50:56.280]  I was going to kill somebody and just do it and not tell anybody.
[1:50:56.280 --> 1:51:01.280]  But they, oh, they monologue about it, they tell you all about it, it goes on and on.
[1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:06.280]  So, there's that information.
[1:51:06.280 --> 1:51:09.280]  But here's the good information.
[1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:13.280]  You got CNN saying, don't ever let them be free.
[1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:19.280]  Make them take all the shots for you, let them out of your houses, it's for their own good.
[1:51:19.280 --> 1:51:22.280]  We've got their authoritarianism on parade.
[1:51:22.280 --> 1:51:26.280]  But whether you're in England or whether you're in Australia or whether you're in Spain or whether you're in Canada,
[1:51:26.280 --> 1:51:29.280]  where they want to keep the lockdowns in forever, because you just bankrupt all the small businesses,
[1:51:29.280 --> 1:51:33.280]  it's everybody on universal income, so you can socially control them,
[1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:35.280]  puts the politicians in total control.
[1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:41.280]  They're riding over women with riot horses in England and they're beating people up everywhere.
[1:51:41.280 --> 1:51:45.280]  But all over Canada, there are resting pastors after a year of lockdown saying,
[1:51:45.280 --> 1:51:50.280]  oh, the mall's open but you can't have your little church meeting.
[1:51:50.280 --> 1:51:52.280]  And these preachers are getting in their faces.
[1:51:52.280 --> 1:51:56.280]  It turns out whether you're in England or whether you're in Australia or whether you're in Canada,
[1:51:56.280 --> 1:51:59.280]  it's all color of law, they're charging you under public nuisance.
[1:51:59.280 --> 1:52:02.280]  They don't even have laws saying they can do all this.
[1:52:02.280 --> 1:52:08.280]  This is all illegal, contact tracing, these passports, the Chinese rolling out, these digital systems.
[1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:13.280]  They just want us to go to certain businesses that demand it,
[1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:17.280]  so we all get used to it and acquiesce, and then they've got us.
[1:52:17.280 --> 1:52:23.280]  Lifetime tracking where you can't go to a restaurant, get on a bus, travel if you don't have a phone.
[1:52:23.280 --> 1:52:27.280]  This is the holy grail of Big Brother, it's not coming, it's down here.
[1:52:27.280 --> 1:52:34.280]  And China with the UN is running the global QR score, they're seeing and admitting it.
[1:52:34.280 --> 1:52:39.280]  So here's a Polish immigrant, a pastor in Canada who grew up under communism.
[1:52:39.280 --> 1:52:42.280]  People always overuse the Nazi analogy, but this is definitely right,
[1:52:42.280 --> 1:52:48.280]  with these mass police coming in on Easter and saying, you can't, this is this morning,
[1:52:48.280 --> 1:52:53.280]  saying you can't have your little church event, and he just says, get the hell out of here.
[1:52:53.280 --> 1:52:58.280]  We all have to stop complying, governments won't respond to regular crime,
[1:52:58.280 --> 1:53:01.280]  but they will come and tell us we're bad if it's a church,
[1:53:01.280 --> 1:53:06.280]  because if you mess with a church that's taboo, you can mess with anybody, here it is.
[1:53:06.280 --> 1:53:10.280]  Please get out, get out of this property immediately, get out.
[1:53:10.280 --> 1:53:14.280]  Get out of this property immediately, out.
[1:53:14.280 --> 1:53:19.280]  I don't want to hear anything out of this property immediately, I don't want to hear a word.
[1:53:19.280 --> 1:53:28.280]  Out, out, out of this property immediately until you come back with the warrant, out.
[1:53:28.280 --> 1:53:37.280]  Out, out, out, out, out of this property immediately, out.
[1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:41.280]  Immediately go out and don't come back.
[1:53:41.280 --> 1:53:48.280]  I don't want to talk to you, not a word, out of this property immediately, out.
[1:53:48.280 --> 1:53:57.280]  I don't care what you have to say, out, out, out of this property you Nazis, out.
[1:53:57.280 --> 1:54:01.280]  Out, Gestapo is not allowed here.
[1:54:01.280 --> 1:54:08.280]  Immediately Gestapo is not allowed, out.
[1:54:08.280 --> 1:54:13.280]  Do you understand English? Get out of this property.
[1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:20.280]  Go, so go, go, and don't come back without the warrant, out Nazi, out.
[1:54:20.280 --> 1:54:23.280]  Then he runs them out, we've got his videos of him being interviewed outside,
[1:54:23.280 --> 1:54:27.280]  and let me tell you, they are just out of control and candidates so shameful,
[1:54:27.280 --> 1:54:29.280]  they use how nice the people are to do this.
[1:54:29.280 --> 1:54:32.280]  The average cops aren't part of this, but they've got to be told though.
[1:54:32.280 --> 1:54:36.280]  It's the bureaucrats, it's the dictator who stole his election for dough,
[1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:38.280]  who says he follows Mao Zedong.
[1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:43.280]  He says, I follow Mao Zedong and dictatorship, I want to be a dictatorship like Mao Zedong.
[1:54:43.280 --> 1:54:48.280]  If you're a new listener, I don't have time to play it, I'm not lying, I know it sounds insane.
[1:54:48.280 --> 1:54:54.280]  Mao, he says, I love China, I love their dictatorship, just type in Justin Trudeau,
[1:54:54.280 --> 1:54:56.280]  love Chinese dictatorship, you'll get the video.
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:54:59.280]  I mean, you can't make this up, but let me hit this.
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:05.280]  Russians Foreign Minister Lavrov comes out and says, China is running a culture revolution
[1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:09.280]  to cause a race war in America that teach whites and blacks to hate each other,
[1:55:09.280 --> 1:55:11.280]  and it's wrong and it's evil.
[1:55:11.280 --> 1:55:15.280]  Big article, zero hedge.com, it's also on m4s.com.
[1:55:15.280 --> 1:55:20.280]  But here's Charles Barkley explaining, this is divide and conquer by the politicians
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:23.280]  to make us all fight with each other while they rob us.
[1:55:23.280 --> 1:55:26.280]  And of course that's true, here it is.
[1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:29.280]  Share that news, how painful it was.
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:35.280]  Yeah, but the one thing I took out of that piece was, man, I think most white people
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:37.280]  and black people are great people.
[1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:43.280]  I really believe that in my heart, but I think our system is set up for our politicians,
[1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:48.280]  whether they're republicans or democrats, are designed to make us not like each other
[1:55:48.280 --> 1:55:52.280]  so they can keep their grasp of money and power.
[1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:54.280]  They divide and conquer.
[1:55:54.280 --> 1:55:58.280]  I truly believe in my heart, most white people and black people are awesome people,
[1:55:58.280 --> 1:56:04.280]  but we're so stupid following our politicians, whether they're republicans or democrats.
[1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:09.280]  And their only job is, hey, let's make these people not like each other.
[1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:11.280]  We don't live in their neighborhoods.
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:13.280]  We're all got money.
[1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:16.280]  Let's make the whites and blacks not like each other.
[1:56:16.280 --> 1:56:19.280]  Let's make rich people and poor people not like each other.
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:22.280]  Let's scramble the middle class.
[1:56:22.280 --> 1:56:24.280]  I truly believe that in my heart.
[1:56:24.280 --> 1:56:27.280]  That's right, it's in the WikiLeaks that that's what democrats did, criminals.
[1:56:27.280 --> 1:56:31.280]  And then I've got all these articles of the Secretary of the Defense,
[1:56:31.280 --> 1:56:33.280]  says white people are bad.
[1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:34.280]  He came out and said it.
[1:56:34.280 --> 1:56:36.280]  That's the head of the military to divide us, folks.
[1:56:36.280 --> 1:56:38.280]  He's ordered to do it.
[1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:41.280]  He's shaken when he says, yeah, the white people are bad.
[1:56:41.280 --> 1:56:43.280]  He's told to do that, folks.
[1:56:43.280 --> 1:56:45.280]  This is a takeover.
[1:56:45.280 --> 1:56:47.280]  They have one of the richest Asians in America.
[1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:51.280]  LA Times come out and say white people are bad and America's bad.
[1:56:51.280 --> 1:56:52.280]  It's all made up.
[1:56:52.280 --> 1:56:54.280]  It's a Chinese operation.
[1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:56.280]  Chinese communist operation.
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:56:59.280]  China's the most racist damn place on earth.
[1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:00.280]  You didn't know that?
[1:57:00.280 --> 1:57:02.280]  They don't let anybody in there that isn't Chinese.
[1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:03.280]  And they sit there.
[1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:07.280]  I don't think it's a Chinese people, but man, I'm not going to sit there and do this crap anymore.
[1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:10.280]  John, this is the most open damn country in the world.
[1:57:10.280 --> 1:57:12.280]  They sit there and tell us we're all a bunch of bad people.
[1:57:12.280 --> 1:57:15.280]  This is a foreign military attack.
[1:57:15.280 --> 1:57:17.280]  And Biden's their agent.
[1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:19.280]  All right, I'm out of time.
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:21.280]  Owen Schroer is about to take over.
[1:57:21.280 --> 1:57:22.280]  Pray for me.
[1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:23.280]  I'm going down the border.
[1:57:23.280 --> 1:57:25.280]  I love you all.
[1:57:25.280 --> 1:57:28.280]  We got a Sunday live coming up.
[1:57:28.280 --> 1:57:31.280]  Usually Owen pops in at the end to say what's coming up, but that's okay.
[1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:32.280]  He's about to come in here.
[1:57:32.280 --> 1:57:33.280]  He's got a lot to cover.
[1:57:33.280 --> 1:57:36.280]  infowars.com, forward slash show, newswars.com.
[1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:37.280]  We're fighting hard.
[1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:38.280]  I see your word of mouth.
[1:57:38.280 --> 1:57:39.280]  Your prayers, folks.
[1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:40.280]  Please spread the word.
[1:57:40.280 --> 1:57:41.280]  We're live.
[1:57:41.280 --> 1:58:07.280]  Thanks for coming up.
