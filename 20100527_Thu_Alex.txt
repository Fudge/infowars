[00:00.000 --> 00:13.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.480 --> 00:32.000]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones hello friends
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.600]  thank you for joining us it's going to be a particularly important radio broadcast today
[00:37.600 --> 00:43.120]  I say that more and more often because it's just every day is so important with the situation
[00:43.120 --> 00:53.200]  of the terrorization of their countries in the Korean Peninsula between the north and
[00:53.200 --> 01:00.480]  the south with the situation with Iran the world economy melting down the border basically
[01:00.480 --> 01:07.320]  in total collapse Mexico's already completely become a failed state there's this crisis
[01:07.320 --> 01:17.640]  worldwide simultaneously there is a worldwide awakening that no one can deny that is accelerating
[01:17.640 --> 01:23.040]  and so you better believe the global engineers the controllers the societal manipulators
[01:23.040 --> 01:29.640]  are already carrying out countermeasures and admitting they're carrying out countermeasures
[01:29.640 --> 01:34.160]  with sent com and the state department and tens of billions of dollars a year and fake
[01:34.160 --> 01:41.080]  news and propaganda placement in fiction programs and the brainwashing of the children in the
[01:41.080 --> 01:54.440]  public schools training them to be prisoners and spies we have a lawless illegitimate government
[01:54.440 --> 02:05.000]  that practices corruption and practices evil religiously to set precedence and to turn
[02:05.000 --> 02:15.400]  our free system of the people into a absolute dictatorship with themselves at the head
[02:15.400 --> 02:23.960]  and I have said many times that I do not feel like I am the man who's up to this job that's
[02:23.960 --> 02:29.800]  the great frustration is that I'll just be quite frank with you I do more research on
[02:29.800 --> 02:36.760]  general issues and a wide range of topics and geopolitical developments and sociology
[02:36.760 --> 02:46.040]  anthropology history science technology than any of the guests we individually have on
[02:46.040 --> 02:56.280]  this broadcast I basically have guest on to bounce ideas off of and in a way to lean on
[02:56.280 --> 03:09.080]  I guess kind of bookmarks and I've been doing this for 15 years and I'm not tired of doing
[03:09.080 --> 03:15.320]  the radio show right as it has the greatest success in its history I mean this radio
[03:15.320 --> 03:24.160]  broadcast is now a worldwide phenomenon but I've come to the realization that if I can't
[03:24.160 --> 03:32.240]  do a better job and if I can't focus more and really get in the zone and put out the
[03:32.240 --> 03:40.400]  true ideas that I have in a cogent focused effective way I'm not going to do this radio
[03:40.400 --> 03:51.920]  show anymore because I know for absolute certainty because I've done it we've seen glimmers of
[03:51.920 --> 03:58.720]  what I can do together with my team in segments of in game and Obama deception and fall the
[03:58.720 --> 04:16.080]  republic which are true jewels that are pure that that that really telegraph the message
[04:16.080 --> 04:24.720]  in a focused paradigm expanding way because words are being destroyed words are being
[04:24.720 --> 04:30.160]  reengineered they're being given new meanings the language is shrinking dramatically not
[04:30.160 --> 04:36.440]  just the English language but all major languages I mean their overall lexicon is expanding
[04:36.440 --> 04:42.720]  what's in the thesaurus is getting bigger but what is in use is shrinking as we approach
[04:42.720 --> 04:53.080]  a point where it's impossible to even communicate with the public we face problems so large
[04:53.080 --> 05:00.840]  but just focusing in on the minutiae every day maybe may be detrimental hello this is

[09:32.400 --> 09:36.640]  all of the news and i'm going to cover the most important top stories in this first
[09:36.640 --> 09:46.640]  hour before i do that i've talked a lot about how i've been frustrated on air more than
[09:46.640 --> 09:53.080]  i have been in the past year and it's because i've been analyzing my radio show i've been
[09:53.080 --> 09:59.680]  analyzing the news websites info wars dot com and present on dot com i've been cogitating
[09:59.680 --> 10:07.560]  and uh... meditating thinking deeply about the work i do and the effect that my work
[10:07.560 --> 10:17.960]  has had on the debate uh... going on on this planet and uh... it's all part of a growing
[10:17.960 --> 10:25.240]  process i've been doing this fifteen years and i was uh... twenty one twenty two years
[10:25.240 --> 10:38.360]  old i guess twenty one when i first got on air and i had instant success because uh...
[10:38.360 --> 10:43.420]  i had studied politics and history more than most people who are fifty or sixty i was still
[10:43.420 --> 10:52.800]  very ignorant and i believe what i was saying and i was confident and i was right about
[10:52.800 --> 10:58.720]  almost everything i discussed i can tune into old tapes from fifteen years ago fourteen
[10:58.720 --> 11:04.720]  years ago thirteen years ago and it's sometimes sounds more authoritative and focused and
[11:04.720 --> 11:10.480]  enlightened than my radio broadcast of today you know not only have i grown and i and i've
[11:10.480 --> 11:20.760]  grown more in the overall some of the aggregate but i've also degenerated in a lot of ways
[11:20.760 --> 11:24.440]  i've degenerated
[11:24.440 --> 11:29.560]  it's kind of like an oak tree may grow and maybe forty feet tall and have a much bigger
[11:29.560 --> 11:33.400]  canopy than it did when it was twenty five feet tall but there are some dead branches
[11:33.400 --> 11:42.120]  and some uh... vines and some some problems i can i i can certainly see that and because
[11:42.120 --> 11:48.960]  i am the most notable known name in alternative media conspiracy as the mainstream media calls
[11:48.960 --> 11:53.480]  it questioning any official knowledge that's handed down from the government control media
[11:53.480 --> 11:58.840]  is called a conspiracy theory pointing out any government corruption thinking for yourself
[11:58.840 --> 12:08.200]  as a conspiracy theory a throwaway line a term they used to stereotype what someone's saying
[12:08.200 --> 12:14.600]  and i i i i haven't become psyched out by the fact of that we are reaching millions of
[12:14.600 --> 12:24.880]  new people a week now no it's actually been bracing it it it it it has helped me focus
[12:24.880 --> 12:32.280]  more and in that itself has created a problem in that then i'm over analyzing what i'm
[12:32.280 --> 12:38.720]  saying and doing and then that causes more frustration because instead of just flowing
[12:38.720 --> 12:46.680]  with the news and information and subconscious analysis on air live i tend to be flicking
[12:46.680 --> 12:55.080]  back and forth analyzing what i'm doing what i'm saying instead of focusing on the news
[12:55.080 --> 13:00.800]  and information but overall that has been very very healthy as if the last two years
[13:00.800 --> 13:13.000]  i've become more self-aware and and and have consciously been trying to analyze the effects
[13:13.000 --> 13:20.160]  of my work and i've tried to really be honest about who i am and what i stand for and what
[13:20.160 --> 13:31.720]  i do and my knowledge and understanding has been compounding so quickly and you've all
[13:31.720 --> 13:41.880]  experienced this let's say you're at the NASCAR race and you see four or five cars
[13:41.880 --> 13:49.320]  pile up and flip into the air and cartwheel as the vehicle disintegrates without showing
[13:49.320 --> 13:53.920]  somebody a clip of the video how do you describe that to them i mean you saw the car explode
[13:53.920 --> 14:00.640]  you you saw it disintegrate into hundreds of pieces you saw the ambulances and fire trucks
[14:00.640 --> 14:11.760]  race out and put the driver out how do you describe the smell of the gasoline or the
[14:11.760 --> 14:19.240]  sound of the sirens or the seconds that seemed like minutes as you watch the car flying
[14:19.240 --> 14:26.520]  into pieces and it's the same thing i i realize i live two lives i live a life of constant
[14:26.520 --> 14:38.120]  research and quiet thought and understanding where you can integrate thousands of pieces
[14:38.120 --> 14:44.800]  of information at once per millisecond understanding deep knowledge of the new world order and
[14:44.800 --> 14:52.760]  the society and where we're going and then you try to go on air and a you've already
[14:52.760 --> 14:56.800]  gone over the material so it doesn't have that fresh understanding that freshness to
[14:56.800 --> 15:04.560]  you it's now fresh to the public that you're transmitting the information to and then you
[15:04.560 --> 15:08.960]  realize there's the layers of communication and the way words have been changed and the
[15:08.960 --> 15:13.120]  way the vocabulary has been reduced and then as you're speaking you understand that the
[15:13.120 --> 15:22.880]  general public has been reprogrammed to where much of what you're saying has a pre-programmed
[15:22.880 --> 15:30.120]  meme or data stream of false information attached to it so that mental walls are raised up in
[15:30.120 --> 15:39.800]  their minds to where they can't even receive the data and then there's the breakdown of
[15:39.800 --> 15:45.120]  the elite and the stratos and who they represent and what their goals are and how to articulate
[15:45.120 --> 15:52.120]  that the clearly evident warring factions that you can see right beneath the surface beneath
[15:52.120 --> 16:03.040]  their false paradigm projections because if you can just show someone one basic truth
[16:03.040 --> 16:11.920]  and have them fully absorb it and fully inhale it and feel it in their lungs feel it in their
[16:11.920 --> 16:17.360]  soul their heart their mind and understand it because they already subconsciously and
[16:17.360 --> 16:23.760]  spiritually knew it if you can you never really teach it someone anything when it when it
[16:23.760 --> 16:27.600]  comes to knowledge understanding of the world it's more like you already you unless they're
[16:27.600 --> 16:36.200]  a child you show them something they already knew and that's my greatest success is that
[16:36.200 --> 16:44.160]  I've gotten people for all of my problems overall it's been very positive because I've
[16:44.160 --> 16:50.120]  gotten people to at least look up and I've been able with God's help and moving through
[16:50.120 --> 16:55.960]  the audience to reach out and unlock people's minds so that they can simply see things for
[16:55.960 --> 17:02.840]  themselves not what I'm seeing because again one cannot be told about the matrix one must
[17:02.840 --> 17:11.520]  see it for themselves I mean how can I sit here and describe my understanding of this
[17:11.520 --> 17:19.440]  evil and what we face and how real it is one can't do that all I can do is try to get
[17:19.440 --> 17:25.680]  people to go past all their conditioning all the middle roadblocks the instumbling blocks
[17:25.680 --> 17:31.160]  that have been laid into their psyche by expert engineers if I can just simply get someone
[17:31.160 --> 17:37.760]  to realize there's more going on than you consciously know and it's not good it stinks
[17:37.760 --> 17:42.480]  you know that simple statement it stinks or Shakespeare wrote something is rotten in
[17:42.480 --> 17:48.800]  the state of Denmark when you smell something rotten you know the smell of rotten vegetables
[17:48.800 --> 17:54.080]  or the smell of rotten meat you know the smell of you learn those smells and it says so much
[17:54.080 --> 18:01.800]  to say something stinks such a simple way to put it but if I can get you to just smell
[18:01.800 --> 18:14.040]  the stench like the saying smell the coffee you know smell the coffee the sunlight the
[18:14.040 --> 18:21.000]  beauty the wonderment of creation and consciousness it's unbelievable we should all be on our knees
[18:21.000 --> 18:28.000]  just in rapture to be on a planet this beautiful and have minds this powerful but you can also
[18:28.000 --> 18:34.040]  smell the roses and everything else that's good but you can also smell the stench and
[18:34.040 --> 18:39.640]  the stench is getting worse and worse by the minute and so at a primitive level I tend
[18:39.640 --> 18:43.920]  to shift into just anger and somebody calls in and says oh I think fluoride's good for
[18:43.920 --> 18:49.440]  you I go into a rage because the person's following talking points I know they are they're
[18:49.440 --> 18:55.880]  just trying to make me angry thousands of peer reviewed studies they know it brain damages
[18:55.880 --> 19:00.360]  people that's why they put it in the water it's an absolute incontrovertible fact like
[19:00.360 --> 19:07.880]  cyanide being deadly and I can't transcend my flesh in the fact that I get angry and
[19:07.880 --> 19:17.880]  enraged I mean it's hard to focus on this for four hours and to speak about it and
[19:17.880 --> 19:23.480]  you know what God you know lays it on my heart that I am meant to do more I meant to change
[19:23.480 --> 19:27.520]  I meant to go to the next level but that this has all been part of a process all of us learning
[19:27.520 --> 19:35.000]  together in 15 years of being on air and that the fact that I am an animal and the fact
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  that I am aggressive and the fact that I do get angry that's one of the reasons I'm able
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.680]  to speak to people who are at a primitive level and then get them to activate and go
[19:44.680 --> 19:53.880]  to the next level of human awareness is because I am a brute but a brute with a beautiful mind
[19:53.880 --> 20:02.000]  like all of you have beautiful minds we are here together this is history fact four million

[24:13.000 --> 24:24.680]  of people and so much of the radio show is a lot better than most if not all content wise
[24:24.680 --> 24:29.920]  but still it's it needs to all be focused like a laser beam where everything we talk
[24:29.920 --> 24:40.000]  about is documented on the scene immediately so there's no denial and that's why we started
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.800]  three four years ago streaming the radio show live at prison planet dot tv so that I could
[24:44.800 --> 24:51.840]  just have a camera on news articles are on legislation so I could say here you know when
[24:51.840 --> 24:56.280]  I tell you their Nuremberg trial documents that the Nazis were putting sodium fluoride
[24:56.280 --> 25:07.400]  in the water to brain damage people and make them more passive you know here's the document
[25:07.400 --> 25:14.560]  and so I'm not beating myself up or anybody for that matter that you know there's also
[25:14.560 --> 25:19.320]  just a frustration of there's so many people I want to save there's so many people I want
[25:19.320 --> 25:33.040]  to warn because we're all in this together I think at the base of this issue it comes
[25:33.040 --> 25:44.040]  down to the fact that we do have a global ruling power structure that does believe in eugenics
[25:44.040 --> 25:49.680]  and that and that wants to and is openly stated they plan on through a world government put
[25:49.680 --> 25:55.200]  a quote police state in place to carry out the orderly extermination of at least eighty
[25:55.200 --> 26:01.400]  percent of the world's population through vaccines through chemicals and water sterilization
[26:01.400 --> 26:07.400]  wars famine it's all stated in state department random two hundred and in john holdren's eco
[26:07.400 --> 26:11.280]  science I mean I'm giving you a few of the notes there it's covered in my film in game
[26:11.280 --> 26:18.400]  there's an online bibliography with hundreds of data points what is the end game dot com
[26:18.400 --> 26:25.560]  and everything else just becomes a side issue oh sure it's interesting that Barney Frank
[26:25.560 --> 26:31.960]  is trying to now say that the republican that just won that election in Hawaii the first
[26:31.960 --> 26:37.400]  in twenty years may not be a U.S. citizen I mean that's interesting talk radio look
[26:37.400 --> 26:43.400]  at these democrat hypocrites you know they're trying to run around and say that this guy
[26:43.400 --> 26:48.440]  can't be in the congress when they know full well he admits he wasn't born in the U.S.
[26:48.440 --> 26:56.080]  and that you don't have to be born in the U.S. you should be naturalized to be a member
[26:56.080 --> 27:03.280]  of congress you just can't be in the cabinet line for succession the president is killed
[27:03.280 --> 27:09.760]  or incapacitated now I mean that's an interesting article dealing with just incredible hypocrisy
[27:09.760 --> 27:18.080]  but what does it matter I mean what does that matter what does an oil spill in the gulf
[27:18.080 --> 27:21.200]  matter even though it's gonna hurt people financially I mean it is a bad thing it's
[27:21.200 --> 27:27.200]  horrible it's terrible but what does it matter compared to we have a ruling class that openly
[27:27.200 --> 27:33.080]  wants to destroy all our liberties and freedoms and is incrementally taking their time gutting
[27:33.080 --> 27:44.280]  our society financially so we can be under their control
[27:44.280 --> 27:49.160]  we've got top afghans saying the U.S. created and funds the Taliban well I mean that's on
[27:49.160 --> 27:59.720]  record that's big news just it because remember three months into the Afghan invasion in 2002
[27:59.720 --> 28:08.560]  early 2002 it was in the news that they don't even hide it that 6000 Taliban and al-qaeda
[28:08.560 --> 28:13.240]  leaders were flown out on C-130s to Pakistan to start the next leg of the war against the
[28:13.240 --> 28:19.200]  Pakistan government and the Pakistan government says this al-qaeda works for you they're attacking
[28:19.200 --> 28:23.760]  us they're trying to overthrow us and then your military uses it as an excuse to try
[28:23.760 --> 28:31.040]  to invade our country and it's on record and it's on record that our government grows
[28:31.040 --> 28:37.080]  the opium and it's on record the CIA comes out and says yes we're making fake bin Laden
[28:37.080 --> 28:44.400]  videos three days ago and puts it in the Washington Post like it's no big deal that's a psychological
[28:44.400 --> 28:50.960]  warfare technique they're going from denying everything going yeah well why do you think
[28:50.960 --> 28:55.240]  that is they're getting you ready for even bigger things ladies and gentlemen they're
[28:55.240 --> 28:59.000]  getting ready for world war three there's no doubt in my mind now they're getting ready
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.440]  for giant stage terror attacks to be blamed on people domestically I may not have that
[29:03.440 --> 29:08.440]  much time ladies and gentlemen I could be arrested anytime I could be killed anytime
[29:08.440 --> 29:13.080]  I could be set up or framed anytime and you know what I'm not even worried about it I'm
[29:13.080 --> 29:17.840]  only worried about really being focused here and taking every minute I've got with you
[29:17.840 --> 29:25.000]  to just really tell you that everything's up to you you can't look to Alex Jones or
[29:25.000 --> 29:32.040]  Ron Paul or anybody else it is an idea of liberty and freedom and truth and understanding
[29:32.040 --> 29:40.400]  the scientific psychological and physical and spiritual assault that we are all under
[29:40.400 --> 29:45.120]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to lay it out for you ladies and gentlemen stay with
[29:45.120 --> 29:54.680]  us please this information is vital we're on the march the empires on the run Alex
[29:54.680 --> 30:03.560]  Jones and the GCN radio network the question is where should the American people draw their
[30:03.560 --> 30:10.440]  line in the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a constitution
[30:10.440 --> 30:15.320]  which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting
[30:15.320 --> 30:19.720]  on what's for dinner so they think they own our land they think they're on our water children
[30:19.720 --> 30:26.040]  our education our money we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate somebody
[30:26.040 --> 30:32.040]  is going to ask you what you did during the patriot uprising we have the facts we have
[30:32.040 --> 30:36.440]  the constitution we have the bill of rights we have common law knowledge is power ladies

[32:03.640 --> 32:07.600]  clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health
[32:07.600 --> 32:13.680]  preferences are concerned as of January 1st 2010 Codex Alimentarius was implemented within
[32:13.680 --> 32:18.840]  the European Union resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements including
[32:18.840 --> 32:23.560]  colloidal silver we must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal
[32:23.560 --> 32:28.160]  silver for ourselves and our families action out to acquire the means of producing this
[32:28.160 --> 32:33.560]  beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic
[32:33.560 --> 32:39.040]  used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous unpredictable
[32:39.040 --> 32:46.080]  side effects go to www dot silver lungs dot com for more information on how to secure your
[32:46.080 --> 32:54.960]  freedom of choice by producing your own colloidal silver right from home that's www dot silver
[32:54.960 --> 33:07.840]  lungs dot com silver lungs dot com
[33:07.840 --> 33:13.800]  the problem is you can't believe anything obama or bp says normally when they say something
[33:13.800 --> 33:20.920]  it's a lie it's their nature but i know a little bit about offshore drilling and service
[33:20.920 --> 33:30.040]  drilling on land and generally when you've got a big mega well oil or gas it's hard
[33:30.040 --> 33:37.280]  to just keep them open and so it's no surprise that 37 days in they're claiming it's caved
[33:37.280 --> 33:44.080]  in and basically muds shooting out now probably propelled by natural gas pockets it's probably
[33:44.080 --> 33:50.600]  played out most of the big oil vein that they were in and without it being properly pressurized
[33:50.600 --> 33:53.920]  that's why when they drill a new well a lot of times they let it sit there for a few months
[33:53.920 --> 33:58.080]  before they even start pumping it because they want the different sands and rock and
[33:58.080 --> 34:01.920]  different formations depending on the area they're drilling in to be able to precipitate
[34:01.920 --> 34:13.360]  out and basically harden the chambers is a simple way of putting it so i've been expecting
[34:13.360 --> 34:18.960]  this thing to cave in on itself for a while and that's what they're saying it's done
[34:18.960 --> 34:30.040]  now but they say mud spraying out of it that could have been the mud they injected in again
[34:30.040 --> 34:40.680]  to harden the shaft or it could be seawater being propelled up by natural gas or it could
[34:40.680 --> 34:44.560]  be oil mixed with it and then they're just putting out this information so we don't
[34:44.560 --> 34:50.280]  know because they're saying mud not oil appears to be gushing from oil well and here's another
[34:50.280 --> 34:58.320]  one LA Times top kill stops Gulf oil leak for now official say and of course for now
[34:58.320 --> 35:07.400]  because who knows what's gonna happen officials are cautionary but say drilling fluid has
[35:07.400 --> 35:16.800]  blocked oil and gas temporarily engineers plan to begin pumping in cement that will
[35:16.800 --> 35:23.720]  then seal the well the problem is you've got thirty six thirty seven days of this stuff
[35:23.720 --> 35:34.880]  gizing out of there they can widen the the entrance the drill hole for thousands of
[35:34.880 --> 35:41.960]  feet towards the top and make it really hard and cause more blowouts but imagine there's
[35:41.960 --> 35:48.200]  just going to continue to pump pump pump pump concrete in there but that's certainly some
[35:48.200 --> 35:55.560]  good news if it's true but the problem is I mean you can't believe anything they say
[35:55.560 --> 36:01.680]  and see I I've got all this really important stuff to talk about and I'm here discussing
[36:01.680 --> 36:06.360]  the oil well leak and it's destroying your fisheries in Louisiana and threatening Texas
[36:06.360 --> 36:11.120]  and Florida and Mississippi beaches I mean certainly I live here in Texas this affects
[36:11.120 --> 36:17.600]  us all but at the end of the day even a small nuclear exchange with North Korea between
[36:17.600 --> 36:24.960]  the south is not a big deal even though it may kill a million people it's not a big deal
[36:24.960 --> 36:32.280]  compared compared compared to having an organized global government forming that controls almost
[36:32.280 --> 36:37.480]  every nation on earth there's a few dictatorships and thuggeries that aren't controlled by it
[36:37.480 --> 36:41.960]  because any open free government gets taken over by these bankers they come right in the
[36:41.960 --> 36:47.560]  front door it's only the dictatorships and corrupt systems that are left because they
[36:47.560 --> 36:52.680]  know how to stand up against another dictatorship so the globalists are mopping that up right
[36:52.680 --> 36:57.840]  now and you know having a global elite in control over 90 plus percent of the countries
[36:57.840 --> 37:01.600]  in the world's finances who every country they take control of they start poisoning
[37:01.600 --> 37:07.000]  your water to give you cancer and a reduced your fertility you know that's a bigger deal
[37:07.000 --> 37:15.920]  than even a small nuclear exchange or some oil that's a lot bigger deal see it's all
[37:15.920 --> 37:25.640]  about priorities my friends because we can survive our fools we can survive even street
[37:25.640 --> 37:32.360]  thugs we can't survive a scientific group of elites who know exactly what they're doing
[37:32.360 --> 37:38.040]  and think you're so stupid they have stated hundreds of textbooks and white papers about
[37:38.040 --> 37:44.560]  how they're going to form the planetary government how they sell derivatives to nations and individuals
[37:44.560 --> 37:48.680]  how they would bankrupt you and how they're going to incrementally totally take control
[37:48.680 --> 37:56.160]  of our society and just incrementally more people brain damage more people with autism
[37:56.160 --> 38:00.680]  more people with diabetes more people with cancer you know where it's just completely
[38:00.680 --> 38:07.960]  normal to have half the kids on your block at age 10 diet of cancer I'm watching it go
[38:07.960 --> 38:12.160]  on all around me you know how frustrating this is I've got to sit here and calmly talk
[38:12.160 --> 38:20.040]  about this every day and then suffer fools that they call in when I love them I care
[38:20.040 --> 38:28.080]  about them I've done the research okay I know I'm telling the truth everywhere I go the
[38:28.080 --> 38:32.040]  grocery store when I go maybe once a month with my wife she usually goes but she'll say
[38:32.040 --> 38:36.160]  hey I've got to take care of paying some bills or take the kids to swim lessons we go pick
[38:36.160 --> 38:41.400]  up here's a grocery list and I'll I try to not look oh I go down the water aisle because
[38:41.400 --> 38:47.000]  I like to get some of that Italian sparkling water that has a as you know orange essence
[38:47.000 --> 38:52.600]  senator lemon but I always see it and now it's not just a couple brands it's more than
[38:52.600 --> 38:57.160]  half the water it's all says fluoride for kids with images of school buses and smiling
[38:57.160 --> 39:02.880]  kids on it and I know the people running it know exactly what they're doing and it's
[39:02.880 --> 39:06.680]  kind of like putting a bear trap out for a bear but it's not for a bear it's for children
[39:06.680 --> 39:16.800]  it's for humans it's for my species it's for my people and you know the the people at
[39:16.800 --> 39:20.360]  the tops of those companies know exactly what they're doing they're graphic artists that
[39:20.360 --> 39:25.600]  come up with the plastic packaging around the water bottles that show that happy kids
[39:25.600 --> 39:32.040]  drinking their water I saw one water bottle company know where the kid has X's for their
[39:32.040 --> 39:38.280]  eyes and that's a sick environmentalist joke can you imagine I mean I'm sure you've read
[39:38.280 --> 39:42.040]  the white paper we've talked about you've seen it on the news and don't have more than
[39:42.040 --> 39:46.960]  one baby it's good we've got a bad economy it's good for the carbon footprint and you
[39:46.960 --> 39:58.360]  know people that have babies are bad and I saw that photo on the side of the water bottle
[39:58.360 --> 40:03.240]  of one brand I've sent a camera crew out to local grocery store just now to try to actually
[40:03.240 --> 40:08.360]  find that brand ourselves not just a photo and they got one of the kids with X's in their
[40:08.360 --> 40:13.520]  eyes I mean you know what X's in the eyes mean folks it's just like the CIA comes out
[40:13.520 --> 40:18.280]  and says yeah we fake bin Laden videos and yeah we're growing the opium and yeah there's
[40:18.280 --> 40:23.040]  pig virus that gives you cancer and then the kid shots that over a million American kids
[40:23.040 --> 40:26.800]  just took last year but we're not going to take it out we now say cancer virus is good
[40:26.800 --> 40:32.720]  and yeah you see this water you know what they put on cans of poison they put an image
[40:32.720 --> 40:39.640]  of a skull with X's in its eyes or they'll show a smiley face with a frown of its tongue
[40:39.640 --> 40:44.320]  sticking out with X's in its eyes they put on the stinking water bottle that this is poison
[40:44.320 --> 40:51.960]  I drink it this is rat poison you know many brands are rat poison in fact call Matt Ryan
[40:51.960 --> 40:56.440]  while he's there tell him go over to the rat poison aisle because I told him to go shoot
[40:56.440 --> 41:01.120]  video but I want him to buy every brand that says they add fluoride call him on a cell
[41:01.120 --> 41:07.000]  please and then tell him to also go buy the rat poison and if you turn it around as many
[41:07.000 --> 41:14.600]  of the brands will say that the poison is sodium fluoride and then tell him to go ahead
[41:14.600 --> 41:18.960]  and buy some toothpaste that has warnings on the back don't buy some fluoride toothpaste
[41:18.960 --> 41:26.440]  to four or five brands of that and then I guess because I did a disservice yesterday
[41:26.440 --> 41:31.600]  when this guy calls in and says you know fluoride's good for you just yelling at him and saying
[41:31.600 --> 41:39.280]  no it's deadly poison I did a disservice I shouldn't have even spoken I should have said
[41:39.280 --> 41:44.400]  okay that's your opinion we're going to do a special YouTube video just for you I am
[41:44.400 --> 41:48.520]  going to do that video today and I'm going to show the peer reviewed studies that it
[41:48.520 --> 41:55.040]  had leased 10 years of drinking sodium fluoride at one part per million at least doubles bone
[41:55.040 --> 42:05.680]  cancer absolute fact hundreds of studies China England US Canada University of Texas studies
[42:05.680 --> 42:13.840]  from the 30s they've known for a long time and I will show some of those studies and
[42:13.840 --> 42:18.640]  I will show you the warnings on the back of the toothpaste and I will show you the poison
[42:18.640 --> 42:23.840]  on the rat poison container and then I will show you the bottles with the school buses
[42:23.840 --> 42:35.400]  on it with little kids because something this important everything we say has to be documented
[42:35.400 --> 42:40.560]  and of course we're the best about that than anybody out there but it's just there's a
[42:40.560 --> 43:03.240]  lot of frustration when somebody calls in and tells you sodium fluoride's good for you
[43:03.240 --> 43:18.960]  it's just so heavy to use the old 60s term it's heavy it's heavy and it's it's hard core
[43:18.960 --> 43:26.200]  to say the least to know that there are tens of thousands of top technicians over banking
[43:26.200 --> 43:32.360]  over science over academia media government who all write books in all right white papers
[43:32.360 --> 43:36.520]  bragging about how they're building a world government to kill us and how what they're
[43:36.520 --> 43:44.760]  doing is a wonderful thing and then you just see the general public they're watching American
[43:44.760 --> 43:54.120]  Idol and Miss USA and lost and you know their simple pleasures are dressing up fancy and
[43:54.120 --> 44:01.160]  strutting around in their front yard with their neighbor watching them you know I transcended
[44:01.160 --> 44:14.400]  strutting around acting cool the day I was born and I guess in a way I'm alien compared
[44:14.400 --> 44:20.960]  to a lot of people I just don't get it and let me be clear about that I'm against commercialism
[44:20.960 --> 44:26.280]  again that's just a general term I mean what does that mean there's so many variants of
[44:26.280 --> 44:35.640]  that I'll try to break that down here briefly and then in my hierarchy of needs as long
[44:35.640 --> 44:40.800]  as I'm comfortable and can take care of myself and I understand how those that aren't comfortable
[44:40.800 --> 44:46.960]  and can't take care of themselves it's it's everything resentment envy feelings of insecurity
[44:46.960 --> 44:54.680]  which the media programs and manipulates and nurtures and builds up in you hey if you can
[44:54.680 --> 45:01.680]  admire beauty in wildflowers in the woods if you can admire the beauty of the moon at night
[45:01.680 --> 45:06.000]  if you can admire the beauty of a of a fish swimming around in a stream if you can admire
[45:06.000 --> 45:14.640]  the beauty of your wife or if you're a woman of your husband or the the the wondrous creativity
[45:14.640 --> 45:24.760]  in your children's eyes you have the spark of God in you so I understand but to watch
[45:24.760 --> 45:30.360]  people ready to sell their mother out for a thousand dollars ready to rob their neighbor
[45:30.360 --> 45:37.040]  for twenty dollars ready to do anything for fiat currency created by nothing that's people
[45:37.040 --> 45:45.680]  selling out their souls selling out who they are for something that was a trick that was
[45:45.680 --> 45:57.320]  made up out of nothing it's all a fraud it's a spell it's a mesmerized mesmer it is alchemy
[45:57.320 --> 46:11.440]  it is the prestige of the magic trick the bamboozled defrauded crowd and I say the elite
[46:11.440 --> 46:17.640]  or low I say they take knowledge and technology and information and use it for war and enslavement
[46:17.640 --> 46:22.880]  and domination and that they're so greedy and envious of of of their fellow humans that
[46:22.880 --> 46:30.160]  they strive to dumb people down and to use our natural instincts to weaken us and to
[46:30.160 --> 46:36.400]  shudder men and women's minds from the larger universe and the great mysteries of the world
[46:36.400 --> 46:46.560]  and to understanding and knowledge and brotherhood of man that is the ultimate sin and all of
[46:46.560 --> 46:52.800]  the sadistic enjoyment the elite has for stomping on children and stomping on screaming
[46:52.800 --> 46:59.200]  women and the way they enjoy poverty the way they enjoy ribs sticking out of the sides
[46:59.200 --> 47:07.200]  of a child covered with flies the way they enjoy war and darkness and flame and pain
[47:07.200 --> 47:13.160]  and carnage and the way they sold the general public the way you see death and destruction
[47:13.160 --> 47:18.640]  creeping into the society everywhere the love of it the the way they pair blood and destruction
[47:18.640 --> 47:23.920]  and pain and suffering and torture with with with with beauty and with sex and with the
[47:23.920 --> 47:29.640]  female form it's all a lie these are weak domesticated people that have never actually
[47:29.640 --> 47:35.080]  experienced true evil have no idea what they're being sucked into the chains that have been
[47:35.080 --> 47:43.280]  fitted around them they're now dragging them into the mouth of hell itself as they're drunk
[47:43.280 --> 47:56.440]  spiritually on the narcotic of darkness as they fall to their knees hypnotized by the
[47:56.440 --> 48:11.520]  eyes of the snake watching my fellow man go headlong into bondage and total enslavement
[48:11.520 --> 48:18.200]  watching the hopes and dreams disappear watching all forms of independence and self-sufficiency
[48:18.200 --> 48:29.080]  being shut down watching the giant kill grid like a wire mesh Leviathan squid pulling us
[48:29.080 --> 48:39.640]  into the dark waters of suffering watching the armies of evil rise like mountains thrust
[48:39.640 --> 48:56.480]  up by tectonic forces of Hades watching it all knowing that history is going by that
[48:56.480 --> 49:06.120]  the destiny of man is now being decided to realize what an incredible moment this is
[49:06.120 --> 49:16.040]  it makes me lose my breath it makes me have to physically remember to go pin air and the
[49:16.040 --> 49:20.320]  average person I saw it all over the place I'm seeing more and more of it people will
[49:20.320 --> 49:24.320]  get in the fast lane and drive 10 miles under the speed limit on a cell phone and they'll
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.640]  look at you when you drive by hoping you look over angry at them so they can have a little
[49:29.640 --> 49:33.640]  look of satisfaction and purse their lips and even stick their tongue out between their
[49:33.640 --> 49:40.240]  lips I see it it's like a spirit of mmm I'm holding someone up mmm I have power mmm I'm
[49:40.240 --> 49:44.440]  frustrating someone let me tell you something 15 years ago I get a little mad at those people
[49:44.440 --> 49:49.920]  now I don't I'm horrified by them they've totally lost their humanity who would want
[49:49.920 --> 49:54.560]  to hold someone up but that's the spirit of the New World Order they love frying your
[49:54.560 --> 50:00.000]  ovaries and your testicles with chemical weapons laced in the food and the vaccines and the
[50:00.000 --> 50:07.360]  lining of the containers that brings you the food they revel in hurting you they revel
[50:07.360 --> 50:15.000]  in holding up man holding up our destiny they hate us they are Satanist the definition
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.240]  that the media gives us of Satan is some hot cheerleader with devil horns you know who's
[50:20.240 --> 50:27.760]  ready to have a party that's not Satan Satan is a pit of rotten meat and dead children
[50:27.760 --> 50:40.280]  and homesteads burned to the ground and pain and suffering
[50:40.280 --> 50:50.080]  and I think about how they revel in holding us back they do come to kill steal and destroy
[50:50.080 --> 51:02.240]  this isn't a human force ladies and gentlemen it is Satan Satan is real

[56:16.360 --> 56:22.840]  he talks about the fact that our government knowingly leaves p o w is behind well it's
[56:22.840 --> 56:26.920]  on record the twenty plus thousand u.s. troops that the russians had captured in german camps
[56:26.920 --> 56:31.560]  uh... in eastern europe and germany were turned over and used for slave labor and intel our
[56:31.560 --> 56:35.720]  government just said that you know go ahead and keep them we're not going to make a diplomatic
[56:35.720 --> 56:41.160]  uh... argument out of this so that's a separate issue than what he's going to raise but it's
[56:41.160 --> 56:44.880]  funny in his email to me and he's on hold right now listing we're about to go to him
[56:44.880 --> 56:51.880]  he uh... he said my god if they'll do this of course they'll stage nine eleven and see

[57:00.040 --> 57:06.680]  basic truths of just how bad it's been and how long it's been bad but because good people
[57:06.680 --> 57:12.840]  are throughout the system corporate government private everywhere because we're compartmentalized
[57:12.840 --> 57:17.800]  we just kind of go along with the system not realizing how we're enforcing it
[57:17.800 --> 57:21.760]  and i'm gonna wax eloquent later in the last half hour of the show a lot of key points
[57:21.760 --> 57:28.120]  i want to make uh... dealing with my little epiphany and brainstorm this morning

[1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:47.800]  m and f m affiliates sponsors and all of our supporters
[1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:51.680]  dr paul craig roberts quit doing his twice a week column
[1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:54.200]  and said he wanted to take some time off but i knew
[1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:56.560]  a fighter for liberty i knew he wasn't going away
[1:00:56.560 --> 1:00:58.840]  i called him up a few months ago and i said
[1:00:58.840 --> 1:01:01.920]  look you can take some time for yourself you're not going anywhere
[1:01:01.920 --> 1:01:03.660]  uh... somebody loves liberty
[1:01:03.660 --> 1:01:05.380]  can't control themselves
[1:01:05.380 --> 1:01:08.400]  and so it's good to have him but you know he has cut back on what he's been
[1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:10.880]  doing but it's it's it's great to have him with us and i was glad to get an email
[1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:12.080]  from him
[1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:14.880]  pointing out hey look at how there's all this evidence that our government now
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:16.680]  been declassified knowingly
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:19.240]  many times has left p o w is behind
[1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:22.360]  not just in vietnam not just korea but world war two
[1:01:22.360 --> 1:01:25.680]  what does this say about the mindset of the elite
[1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:28.320]  and uh... he is he wanted to come on and talk about that we're always honored to
[1:01:28.320 --> 1:01:30.080]  have him
[1:01:30.080 --> 1:01:32.760]  we'll cover about twenty thirty minutes on that then i want to pick his brain
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:34.800]  because he is the father of economics
[1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:38.840]  he is one of the top ten living economist according to four major publications
[1:01:38.840 --> 1:01:41.640]  uh... he's one of some of the biggest honors from the french u s british
[1:01:41.640 --> 1:01:42.540]  government
[1:01:42.540 --> 1:01:45.120]  is the best-selling author former editor of the wall street journal
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:49.560]  so i want to get into uh... north korea i ran with him on to get into the economy
[1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:52.320]  i mean they're openly talking about worldwide meltdown now all over the
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:53.360]  news
[1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:56.600]  and of course you talk about this years ago via the derivatives and everything
[1:01:56.600 --> 1:02:00.840]  uh... so we're gonna talk about it all with doctor paul craig roberts
[1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:02.120]  uh... in the next hour
[1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:06.040]  doc it's good to have you here with us
[1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:08.880]  you look good there via skype video feed
[1:02:08.880 --> 1:02:10.800]  right well thank you
[1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:14.280]  uh... so much is going on so much is happening about the world we're gonna
[1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:15.700]  break in a few minutes but
[1:02:15.700 --> 1:02:20.560]  uh... get into this whole p o w situation in your research on that
[1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:25.960]  well you know uh... it's not my research uh... it's in the uh... shranberg
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:31.680]  the plethora prize-winning uh... new york times reporter and editor
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:34.960]  uh... he has uh... proven beyond all down
[1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:37.840]  uh... and presents all the evidence
[1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:39.440]  that uh...
[1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:44.320]  uh... american prisoners of war were left behind in vietnam
[1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:47.880]  so that's a scandal the second scandal is
[1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:52.120]  that every administration since richard nixon's
[1:02:52.120 --> 1:02:53.960]  has
[1:02:53.960 --> 1:02:56.040]  continued to cover up
[1:02:56.040 --> 1:02:58.700]  and the third scandal is that
[1:02:58.700 --> 1:03:02.920]  despite his high-standing and journalism and all the prizes and the
[1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:04.680]  police prize and his
[1:03:04.680 --> 1:03:09.480]  high post at the new york times he was never allowed to write the story
[1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:12.120]  and so it only came out
[1:03:12.120 --> 1:03:16.520]  in an out-of-the-way publication uh... a year or two ago about two years ago
[1:03:16.520 --> 1:03:19.000]  yeah we will we actually interviewed the folks involved
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.560]  at the time in fact i i think i have interviewed him in fact let's get him
[1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:22.520]  back on
[1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:24.760]  uh... or some of the families involved
[1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:27.040]  uh... but but the issue is
[1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:30.160]  when i say your research i'm saying you know you're you're writing about this
[1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:30.960]  now
[1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:35.160]  how this to your research into how this ties in to the mindset
[1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:38.800]  of the ruling class
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:41.280]  uh... i think that now that we have
[1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:42.640]  definite proof
[1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:44.720]  from a very credible
[1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:45.920]  uh... source
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:47.880]  sydney schrenberg
[1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:53.160]  that united states government conducted a conspiracy since the nineteen
[1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:55.240]  seventies
[1:03:55.240 --> 1:03:59.580]  to hide the fact that they abandoned american prisons of war
[1:03:59.580 --> 1:04:01.840]  to the north vietnamese
[1:04:01.840 --> 1:04:03.640]  this is now proven
[1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:06.800]  this might make americans wonder
[1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:11.680]  uh... if other so-called conspiracy theories are also true
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:12.960]  such as
[1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:14.800]  the theory that uh...
[1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:20.040]  nine eleven was an inside job or a false flag operation
[1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:21.120]  uh...
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:22.680]  the uh...
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:26.360]  and they might make people wonder if the war and commissions
[1:04:26.360 --> 1:04:32.240]  uh... account of kennedy's assassination was just another cover up
[1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:33.840]  the same for robert
[1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:35.280]  kennedy's

[1:04:45.560 --> 1:04:49.240]  into the mindset of an establishment why they would do

[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:06.120]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines

[1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:13.760]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:17.920]  you call it synchronicity serendipity i don't know but
[1:08:17.920 --> 1:08:20.640]  back on monday and tuesday
[1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:22.720]  i talked quite a bit about
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:26.160]  the fact that it was actually declassified
[1:08:26.160 --> 1:08:31.000]  that twenty plus thousand twenty one and a half thousand or so u.s. troops
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:35.360]  that were in eastern european uh... nazi held a p o w camps in german camps
[1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:37.160]  that were grabbed by stalling
[1:08:37.160 --> 1:08:40.160]  uh... the u.s. in england want to be bodies with stalling
[1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:43.680]  they divided up eastern europe and uh... he was a thug and captain for
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:44.680]  intelligence
[1:08:44.680 --> 1:08:45.920]  purposes and they just
[1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:47.400]  they just let him keep them
[1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:50.600]  and a few years ago that actually came out in russia newspapers
[1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:54.800]  uh... you know old americans world war two that's uh... eighty plus years old
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:56.760]  still alive in russia
[1:08:56.760 --> 1:09:00.200]  and it's been confirmed with korea it's been confirmed with vietnam
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:03.280]  we've had the families on the back congressional hearings to get that the
[1:09:03.280 --> 1:09:08.280]  media doesn't cover they've had national press club meetings uh... but uh...
[1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:12.080]  when i got an email a few days ago from dr paul craig roberts father reagan
[1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:15.520]  omics former head of policy department treasury under reagan
[1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:18.400]  well for wall street journal editor
[1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:20.840]  pointing out that he was going to write an article
[1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:22.720]  uh...
[1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:26.160]  dealing with the fact that if it's a bullet surprise winning
[1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:30.200]  new york times editor for years isn't allowed to publish
[1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:34.360]  in a mainstream publication his research that's iron clad
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:36.400]  that this is all confirmed
[1:09:36.400 --> 1:09:39.120]  and it's ridiculous how confirmed it is that it's like
[1:09:39.120 --> 1:09:42.600]  confirming that mount st helens blew up in the early nineteen eighties it's a
[1:09:42.600 --> 1:09:43.960]  fact it happened
[1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:47.320]  or that you know the first creature in space was a dog from russia
[1:09:47.320 --> 1:09:49.400]  it's a fact
[1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:51.800]  and
[1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:53.460]  you know the angle
[1:09:53.460 --> 1:09:56.280]  and of course roberts wasn't listening to me he separately put two and two
[1:09:56.280 --> 1:09:58.920]  together because we're all having the same understandings that
[1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:01.360]  if they'll if they'll leave our troops to die
[1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:02.440]  or if they'll
[1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:06.000]  it's like dug rocky i've had on he was the head of the d u program for more
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:09.080]  than a decade he wrote the handbooks for the pentagon in the eighties
[1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:10.400]  they knew d u
[1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:11.960]  would kill anybody
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:15.320]  uh... collectively that briefed it
[1:10:15.320 --> 1:10:18.640]  and they just in the in the mid nineties change the rules and said it's now
[1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:19.720]  good for you
[1:10:19.720 --> 1:10:23.160]  no problem and the state department says is a conspiracy theory
[1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:24.400]  on their website
[1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:26.120]  if you say it's bad
[1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:30.720]  i mean they absolutely no you breathe this the particulate the radiation
[1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:32.680]  it's going to kill you
[1:10:32.680 --> 1:10:36.160]  i mean it's going to you know may take a few years but you're dead
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:38.880]  now they just say it's good for you
[1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:41.040]  this shows you
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:44.120]  the mindset and and and i like in it and we're going to dr roberts i want to
[1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:45.320]  make this point
[1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:47.120]  to chest being invented
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:49.000]  three and a half thousand years ago
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:52.880]  uh... in northern india and i and what's i ran today they debate who invented
[1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:54.940]  it but it came from that area
[1:10:54.940 --> 1:10:57.600]  and in it you have the gambit
[1:10:57.600 --> 1:10:59.920]  the sacrifice of a pond
[1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:03.240]  that's a good move early on you know in basic chess i'm not a good chess player
[1:11:03.240 --> 1:11:05.320]  but i but i play some
[1:11:05.320 --> 1:11:09.000]  sacrificing upon and it's a special forces tactic in the books it's taught at
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  west point
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.560]  send in you know twenty guys
[1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:15.600]  uh... first to go last to know they're going to get wiped out but that's going
[1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:18.080]  to bring in the enemy into the gorge
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:20.160]  that will then reveal their positions
[1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:24.200]  and you can then wipe out the larger force and the argument is you lose twenty
[1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:25.800]  men but you say thousands
[1:11:25.800 --> 1:11:29.800]  in the battle by losing the twenty men so that's why they stage nine eleven
[1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:33.280]  that's why they say that so what twenty one thousand u.s. troops given the
[1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:34.080]  style and
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:37.480]  that's why they say you know hundreds and hundreds u.s. troops was thousands
[1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:38.380]  most of them dead
[1:11:38.380 --> 1:11:41.480]  you know let them be slaves let them be tortured to death for thirty years and
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:43.000]  in in uh...
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:44.880]  uh... in in vietnam
[1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:46.560]  it's the gambit
[1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:50.160]  and that's the beginning of evil that's why special forces people before they
[1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:51.200]  graduate
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:52.920]  they are given
[1:11:52.920 --> 1:11:54.400]  for delta force level
[1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:55.840]  they're given at one night
[1:11:55.840 --> 1:11:58.200]  to read the prince by mackey of ellie
[1:11:58.200 --> 1:11:59.880]  and then to write a paper
[1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:03.120]  and if they say i believe the injustice the means they go you're the man we're
[1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:04.640]  looking for you're not recruited
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:05.960]  if they say no
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:10.400]  i won't kill children this is now in the army manual declassified last year was
[1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:12.680]  leaked by wiki leaks from two thousand four
[1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:15.440]  where it talks about staging false flag terror attacks one of the favorites to
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:16.240]  kill children
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:19.920]  blame on the far and i mean captains and above in black ops are now taught this
[1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:23.120]  and the argument is what we're fighting commies or fighting muslims
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:25.600]  they're gonna kill more children if we don't kill a few
[1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:27.120]  you know for the overall good
[1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:30.680]  that's kind of the straight razor you know you statement in apocalypse now
[1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:33.840]  or kernel curts is talking about what he's had to do to win
[1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:36.960]  and and and and and so this is the mindset
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:40.840]  of uh... you in justifies the means i'm gonna shut up
[1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:43.920]  and and and have dr paul craig roberts go over
[1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:47.080]  uh... you know this this two-year-old information
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:49.000]  the nation institute reported it
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.520]  mccain and the p o w cover-up
[1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:55.440]  uh... and uh... this is written by a bullet surprise winner
[1:12:55.440 --> 1:12:58.680]  uh... but completely a news blackout in the u s
[1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:01.520]  dot roberts uh... thanks for holding while i did that back story
[1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:03.360]  you've got the floor
[1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:07.120]  well let's first tell your listeners will they can read the account it's now
[1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:11.080]  it came out yesterday in the american conservative and so you'll have an
[1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:11.760]  account
[1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:13.840]  by the publisher of the magazine
[1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:18.080]  you'll have an account by shranberg of why he was unable to
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:21.840]  uh... tell the story and then you have
[1:13:21.840 --> 1:13:24.280]  uh... the story itself
[1:13:24.280 --> 1:13:27.160]  uh... and the evidence he presents all the evidence
[1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:30.320]  and then they have a few people discussing
[1:13:30.320 --> 1:13:32.280]  the story
[1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:37.600]  it's also i think this morning uh... it was all put up on and i wore dot com
[1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:41.320]  and i'm sure you'll have it up on on your site
[1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:43.880]  so so that people can see that
[1:13:43.880 --> 1:13:49.280]  what was branded a conspiracy theory for several decades
[1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:53.520]  by the government by the media by all the mainstream establishment
[1:13:53.520 --> 1:13:58.880]  uh... they they got rid of the p o w issue by calling it a conspiracy theory
[1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:02.720]  it's now been proven beyond all down that the computer conspiracy theory was
[1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:03.840]  true
[1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:07.400]  the p o w's were abandoned
[1:14:07.400 --> 1:14:10.640]  and uh... if there was a cover-up by
[1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:15.120]  the united states government that continues to this day it's just like
[1:14:15.120 --> 1:14:16.200]  the cover-up
[1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:19.840]  of the israeli attack on the u s s liberty
[1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:24.600]  uh... this was said to have been some kind of an accident mistaken identity
[1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:25.520]  of the ship
[1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:29.240]  and that's been covered up ever since the nineteen sixties
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:31.560]  we do have
[1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:34.080]  government cover-ups the government that
[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:37.560]  commits a great acts of evil and what's more
[1:14:37.560 --> 1:14:42.080]  despicable than abandoning your own p o w
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:44.720]  and they could have got the p o w's back
[1:14:44.720 --> 1:14:46.560]  all they had to do
[1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:48.560]  was to pay ransom
[1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:53.480]  the north koreans held back half of the prisoners about six hundred of them
[1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:56.640]  in order to collect reparations
[1:14:56.640 --> 1:15:00.800]  for all the bombing the americans had done to north bit now
[1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:02.360]  and so they were willing
[1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:04.520]  to give the prisoners back
[1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:07.680]  if we would pay a three or four billion dollars
[1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:09.320]  uh... in ransom
[1:15:09.320 --> 1:15:10.360]  and of course
[1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:12.080]  by that time
[1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:13.720]  uh... nixon was too
[1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:14.440]  week
[1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:17.800]  uh... to deliver the money watergate was consuming them
[1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:21.080]  and once a lie gets in place
[1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:22.100]  it can't be
[1:15:22.100 --> 1:15:23.240]  undone
[1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:25.040]  it wasn't possible
[1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:28.240]  for the next president to say hey look we can get
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:29.520]  they do have
[1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:31.440]  our prisoners and we can get them back
[1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:33.280]  for a little bit of money
[1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:37.840]  so once a lies in place everyone ends up defending it even the reagan
[1:15:37.840 --> 1:15:39.200]  administration
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:40.880]  ended up
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:45.040]  defending the claim that all the prisoners were back so
[1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:46.100]  here we see
[1:15:46.100 --> 1:15:49.760]  a government that lies through its teeth
[1:15:49.760 --> 1:15:51.520]  about its prisoners that it
[1:15:51.520 --> 1:15:53.180]  abandoned
[1:15:53.180 --> 1:15:56.120]  and could have gotten back for very little money
[1:15:56.120 --> 1:16:01.000]  so why does the gut why do we believe the government tells us the truth about
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:02.520]  anything
[1:16:02.520 --> 1:16:06.080]  and why do we think the media
[1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:07.060]  possibly
[1:16:07.060 --> 1:16:09.720]  serve the people by delivering the truth
[1:16:09.720 --> 1:16:11.560]  when they prevented
[1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:14.040]  shranberg from ever publishing
[1:16:14.040 --> 1:16:17.800]  his account i mean he had to sit on this account for years and years until
[1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:18.720]  finally
[1:16:18.720 --> 1:16:23.160]  it got out and some out of the way place and now it's become news thanks
[1:16:23.160 --> 1:16:24.680]  to uh... run on
[1:16:24.680 --> 1:16:26.880]  on the publisher of the
[1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:28.680]  of the american conservative
[1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:30.080]  who's making an issue
[1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:34.160]  out of it and of course you've made an issue out of it
[1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:34.920]  and so
[1:16:34.920 --> 1:16:37.200]  what i think might be hopeful
[1:16:37.200 --> 1:16:38.040]  about it
[1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:39.160]  is that
[1:16:39.160 --> 1:16:43.040]  it makes people see if the government will lie about this they'll lie about
[1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:44.760]  nine eleven
[1:16:44.760 --> 1:16:45.840]  they'll lie about
[1:16:45.840 --> 1:16:46.680]  kennedy's
[1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:49.920]  assassination in fact they lie about everything don't they have to say lie
[1:16:49.920 --> 1:16:51.800]  about the unemployment rate
[1:16:51.800 --> 1:16:55.920]  they lie about the inflation rate they lie about the bank bailout what does the
[1:16:55.920 --> 1:16:57.760]  government not
[1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:00.160]  lie about well here's another example
[1:17:00.160 --> 1:17:03.440]  i mean i had a congressman on more than ten years ago from virginia who was
[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:04.360]  upset
[1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:08.000]  about six years ago i had a member of the australian parliament on who was
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:08.840]  upset
[1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:10.760]  it was in the australian news
[1:17:10.760 --> 1:17:14.560]  they were saying there's a secret u n database of all our kids blood
[1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:17.160]  the government's been taking the blood since nineteen
[1:17:17.160 --> 1:17:19.740]  uh... you know seventy one seventy two
[1:17:19.740 --> 1:17:23.160]  it's was a worldwide program in in in western countries
[1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:25.920]  uh... and they put it in a database
[1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:29.320]  and i would have these people on and read the documents and listeners wouldn't
[1:17:29.320 --> 1:17:30.120]  believe me
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:31.560]  now it's all over the news
[1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:35.120]  all guess what the pentagon's got your blood of your thirty eight years old or
[1:17:35.120 --> 1:17:35.880]  younger
[1:17:35.880 --> 1:17:38.880]  that's how criminal this group is
[1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:41.000]  and how this national security state
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:42.640]  basically does whatever they want
[1:17:42.640 --> 1:17:46.400]  that imagine that doctor roberts for thirty eight years from australia to
[1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:50.320]  canada from england to the u s they take our blood to put it in a in a in a
[1:17:50.320 --> 1:17:51.840]  government database
[1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:53.400]  and now they announced guess what
[1:17:53.400 --> 1:17:56.440]  we're gonna have a global deny database and we already have your blood i mean
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:17:57.040]  it's just
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:00.200]  it's just everything is a conspiracy basically
[1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:05.160]  i don't look that way doesn't matter it does i mean it's incredible
[1:18:05.160 --> 1:18:12.400]  see the one advantage of this conspiracy now it's been blown wide open
[1:18:12.400 --> 1:18:16.560]  and therefore it may help make people aware
[1:18:16.560 --> 1:18:19.120]  the other conspiracies are true to
[1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:22.880]  well exactly expanding on that briefly uh... i mean your point is well taken in
[1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:23.800]  its central
[1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:27.760]  it's not just that they did this it's the thirty years of cover-ups
[1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:29.840]  and not letting pull a surprise winners
[1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:34.680]  right on it and now that story is as big as the p o w story that you have a
[1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:38.880]  giant group of people in media and government who would work together
[1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:45.080]  to to leave a bunch of men to die i mean it's it's why
[1:18:45.080 --> 1:18:49.720]  and of course the same group the same people are doing the same thing now
[1:18:49.720 --> 1:18:54.600]  leading us deeper in the wars deeper in the confrontation with nuclear arm
[1:18:54.600 --> 1:18:56.720]  powers
[1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:02.000]  the evil is loose as you said evil is loose in the united states it's got
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:05.240]  uh... an iron grip on the government
[1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:07.800]  and probably on government at most levels
[1:19:07.800 --> 1:19:09.480]  in most places
[1:19:09.480 --> 1:19:13.120]  so it is a very serious situation and uh...
[1:19:13.120 --> 1:19:17.080]  it remains to be seen if the people wake up or enough of a wake up and if they
[1:19:17.080 --> 1:19:19.080]  do whether they have the
[1:19:19.080 --> 1:19:21.000]  uh... capability of doing
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:24.840]  anything about it or whether they're just going to be paul's
[1:19:24.840 --> 1:19:27.800]  that are continued to be sacrificed
[1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:32.560]  so that uh... a very small group of elites who control the government can
[1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:34.240]  achieve some agenda
[1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:35.920]  that of their own
[1:19:35.920 --> 1:19:39.160]  well sir let's continue to talk about how big this story is and how important
[1:19:39.160 --> 1:19:41.080]  maybe go over some of the sections
[1:19:41.080 --> 1:19:44.120]  by any war dot com probably got fifteen articles about it
[1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:47.240]  and documents of the nation institute has them
[1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:51.480]  uh... the conservative uh... the american conservative
[1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:54.880]  uh... has it and we're getting it all up on info wars dot com and prison planet
[1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:56.200]  dot com stay there sir
[1:19:56.200 --> 1:20:01.320]  i'm glad you uh... contacted us about this thank you
[1:20:01.320 --> 1:20:04.080]  we all know that the burkee water purification systems are the most
[1:20:04.080 --> 1:20:05.880]  trusted name of water filtration
[1:20:05.880 --> 1:20:09.080]  as an authorized burkee dealer for over four years and serving thousands of
[1:20:09.080 --> 1:20:12.960]  satisfied customers the burkee guy offers amazing specials for burkee water
[1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:17.080]  systems the revolutionary burkee light systems include a set of self sterilizing

[1:24:12.400 --> 1:24:16.640]  yeah he's got an article out today on any war
[1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:21.280]  saying sometimes conspiracy theories are true look they just call it a
[1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:22.800]  conspiracy theory
[1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:27.920]  when you say that they're lying I mean it wasn't a conspiracy theory in
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:29.160]  1964
[1:24:29.160 --> 1:24:33.080]  when people started saying our ships were an attack that was staged Gulf of
[1:24:33.080 --> 1:24:33.600]  Tonkin
[1:24:33.600 --> 1:24:39.240]  it was in the San Diego newspaper we've gone and gotten the microfilm
[1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:42.360]  that sailors came back and said we weren't attacked it's all a lie
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:47.080]  it was in the newspaper but then it becomes a rumor oh I heard it was staged
[1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:50.440]  we'll see now it's declassified after 40
[1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:54.440]  plus years on the anniversary of it
[1:24:54.440 --> 1:24:58.240]  in 2004 40 plus I guess that's the
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:01.480]  yeah 40 anniversary they
[1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:05.280]  they they declassify that they staged it going back to dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[1:25:05.280 --> 1:25:10.560]  as you said though you know the fact that you have such a huge cover-up
[1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:13.720]  shows that they that they've got a lot of willing
[1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:16.960]  people that will be part of this evil
[1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:21.280]  for talk about that dr. Roberts but also why would they want to lie
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:25.960]  and not get our troops back okay those are all good questions
[1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:29.560]  first let me say that one of the
[1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:32.400]  one of the many important contributions
[1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:35.960]  Schranberg makes is he shows how the government
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:39.480]  lies he shows the technique how they do it
[1:25:39.480 --> 1:25:43.160]  how they get rid of conclusive
[1:25:43.160 --> 1:25:46.920]  evidence and so that itself is very revealing
[1:25:46.920 --> 1:25:50.120]  and your listeners should read just to see
[1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:53.960]  how the government goes about bearing the truth
[1:25:53.960 --> 1:25:57.680]  we got plenty of time boil it down well there
[1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:01.160]  the specific examples are are given by Schranberg and
[1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:05.080]  it's best for them to read now to get to your questions
[1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:08.240]  interestingly enough there were two
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:12.040]  American defense secretaries James Schlesinger
[1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:16.360]  who was actually one of my graduate professors in economics
[1:26:16.360 --> 1:26:21.000]  and Melvin Laird who both testified
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:23.920]  under oath to Congress that men were left behind
[1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:28.720]  so even when two defense secretaries and of course Melvin Laird
[1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:34.480]  was the secretary of defense during the Nixon period when the Vietnam War was
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:39.000]  wound down so he certainly would know and Schlesinger came
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:45.560]  not long after so we have two defense secretaries who did testify to Congress
[1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:48.920]  that men were left behind but Congress didn't want to hear it
[1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:51.960]  they didn't want to do anything about it and I
[1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:55.880]  and there are a number of defense secretaries
[1:26:55.880 --> 1:27:00.360]  as Schranberg shows who come into office who just immediately
[1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:03.640]  take up the lie because their notion is
[1:27:03.640 --> 1:27:07.480]  it's my career I'm serving my career and I'm not going to go
[1:27:07.480 --> 1:27:11.880]  against whatever the line is and who cares if men are still rotting and being
[1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:15.800]  used as slaves which has been confirmed there's some still alive
[1:27:15.800 --> 1:27:20.760]  being worked to death as slaves and these fat lazy evil congressman
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:25.320]  just their pigs pigs they're the scum of the earth in fact
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:29.080]  the United States government is a scum of the earth the worst
[1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:33.880]  people in the country or in the government they're not the criminals out
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:36.840]  there they're not even the terrorists the worst people
[1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:42.600]  or in the government and that is another reason I think that Schranberg's story
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:46.760]  is so explosive because Americans don't want to
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:51.800]  come to grips with that it it it's too much of a demand on their emotional
[1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:54.840]  strength and their intellectual strength and so
[1:27:54.840 --> 1:28:00.440]  it's something that people want to keep uh under the covers now
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:05.000]  I think the reason the lie got started was that
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:08.920]  you know the washington post was doing a job on nixon with watergate
[1:28:08.920 --> 1:28:13.960]  he was trying to wind down the war while watergate was devouring him
[1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:18.360]  and so he just didn't have any clout he couldn't he couldn't deliver the money
[1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:22.440]  to get the prisoners back and so he had to say we had them all back
[1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:25.640]  that the war's over and we have everybody back he couldn't say
[1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:29.320]  hey the war's over and we've left all these people because
[1:28:29.320 --> 1:28:35.080]  he would be blamed uh not the washington post not uh those two reporters
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:38.760]  Bernstein and Woodward uh not the congress he would be
[1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:41.720]  blamed and he was already in terrible hot war about
[1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:46.920]  watergate so he said uh we have everybody back well once the
[1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:50.280]  lies in place how does how do you get the lie out of
[1:28:50.280 --> 1:28:53.320]  place because by now everyone's credited to it the
[1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:56.440]  congress is committed to it the media is committed to it
[1:28:56.440 --> 1:29:00.520]  everyone is committed to the lie it's just like 9 11 look how much
[1:29:00.520 --> 1:29:07.480]  evidence has come out after the 9 11 commission report which proves that the
[1:29:07.480 --> 1:29:10.920]  whole thing was totally different than you've just
[1:29:10.920 --> 1:29:13.800]  hit on the key there i just had another epiphany that's right
[1:29:13.800 --> 1:29:17.560]  they they have a mass hoax they tell you what the story is that everyone
[1:29:17.560 --> 1:29:21.400]  commits and the average american says i'm not going to believe i'm being lied to
[1:29:21.400 --> 1:29:25.640]  because if this is a lie everything's a lie and once they've got you in in you
[1:29:25.640 --> 1:29:29.320]  know it i guess by degrees you become part of the evil
[1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:33.160]  and now we're just a huge culture of lies not a robert's long segment coming
[1:29:33.160 --> 1:29:36.040]  up this was a short segment continue breaking down this
[1:29:36.040 --> 1:29:40.760]  central point that you just made uh i mean it's like getting your arm caught
[1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:43.560]  in a sausage machine it's just sucking us all in
[1:29:43.560 --> 1:29:47.400]  and now we have to you know go along with every lie because our government
[1:29:47.400 --> 1:29:50.600]  isn't bad they're good and that allows the evil to grow
[1:29:50.600 --> 1:29:59.320]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[1:33:14.280 --> 1:33:18.680]  says is a lie until we're just swimming in an ether of lies
[1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:21.640]  and then anyone who discovers we're being lied to
[1:33:21.640 --> 1:33:27.240]  from the source documents from the witnesses is called a conspiracy theorist
[1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:29.880]  i want to bring up the fact the washington post three days ago
[1:33:29.880 --> 1:33:34.360]  just came out in a headline about sedom and a fake movie saying he was gay by

[1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:53.880]  how the uh... elite uh... destroyed the middle class jobs
[1:35:53.880 --> 1:35:57.480]  uh... in order to further enrich themselves
[1:35:57.480 --> 1:36:01.880]  and how they have dismantled the ladders of upward mobility
[1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:06.680]  uh... stopping the ability of people to rise
[1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:11.880]  uh... in order to put themselves in permanent control at the top and the
[1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:16.360]  other ninety nine percent of the population in poverty at the bottom
[1:36:16.360 --> 1:36:20.120]  uh... that uh... that's what the book uh...
[1:36:20.120 --> 1:36:23.560]  shows that uh... it uh... shows how
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:28.600]  the end of the american middle class in the end of an opportunity
[1:36:28.600 --> 1:36:33.160]  uh... society now alexis get back to the story because you know
[1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:38.200]  one of the things that people always say when they're confronted
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:41.720]  uh... with evidence that uh... the government
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:46.280]  has lied or something they say well if they had been a real conspiracy
[1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:50.280]  somebody would have talked but of course
[1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:53.480]  they always do talk as i said earlier to
[1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:57.800]  united states secretary of defense talked and said
[1:36:57.800 --> 1:37:01.320]  in sworn testimony that people were left behind
[1:37:01.320 --> 1:37:04.760]  regens national security advisor talked
[1:37:04.760 --> 1:37:09.080]  uh... a leader of a delta team
[1:37:09.080 --> 1:37:14.280]  which twice was organized to go rescue the prisoners only to be called off
[1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:18.440]  both times has taught all sorts of people have talked so
[1:37:18.440 --> 1:37:22.600]  it doesn't do any good to talk in the case of nine eleven we know
[1:37:22.600 --> 1:37:27.480]  and have said so many times there were over a hundred first responders
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:33.400]  who were in the towers firemen policemen build building maintenance people
[1:37:33.400 --> 1:37:37.160]  who not only heard but experienced explosions
[1:37:37.160 --> 1:37:41.560]  and saw many floors underground and sub basements well doc as you say i've
[1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:44.840]  interviewed i've interviewed police and firemen who we saw on the scene in
[1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:47.160]  videos saying they're going to blow it up get it back
[1:37:47.160 --> 1:37:49.560]  they weren't involved they were just told get back
[1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:52.840]  and silverstein says we gave the order to pull it and watch it come down and now
[1:37:52.840 --> 1:37:56.680]  a fox news funded last month came out and said yeah i was there
[1:37:56.680 --> 1:38:00.360]  we were talking about blowing it up with silverstein but we decided not to
[1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:03.880]  because it fell on its own i mean this is hidden in plain view
[1:38:03.880 --> 1:38:08.200]  they're just counting on us to not be able to handle the full horror
[1:38:08.200 --> 1:38:11.320]  well the point is it doesn't do any good somebody talks
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:18.680]  because it remains a conspiracy theory now as as for the cover-up
[1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:23.160]  you know obviously the pentagon and the military are very interested in the
[1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:26.200]  cover-up because how many people would join up the
[1:38:26.200 --> 1:38:30.600]  military if they expected to have to fight if they knew
[1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:34.680]  the government would abandon them if they were captured
[1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:40.200]  i mean what kind of morale would the army have in the marines for example and
[1:38:40.200 --> 1:38:44.360]  and the special forces would they be all these gung-ho people out there
[1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:48.040]  if they were aware of the fact that if they get captured
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:52.600]  they may simply be abandoned and that when the war is over they won't be
[1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:56.440]  repatriated they'll just be left in the enemy's hands
[1:38:56.440 --> 1:38:59.960]  so this is the reason for the cover-up you see is
[1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:03.960]  there are many reasons for affecting all parties
[1:39:03.960 --> 1:39:08.760]  and and what is also amazing is that the that the two
[1:39:08.760 --> 1:39:13.080]  chief uh celebrities who were prisoners of war
[1:39:13.080 --> 1:39:19.240]  john mccain and john carrey uh well carrey wasn't prison war but he was
[1:39:19.240 --> 1:39:23.320]  controversial about the vietnam getting the silver star
[1:39:23.320 --> 1:39:27.080]  so we have these two and they're both instrumental in the cover-up
[1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:30.840]  both of them have done everything possible
[1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:38.120]  to prevent uh the truth from coming out and not only that but to lock up
[1:39:38.120 --> 1:39:45.160]  all the documents that reveal the truth so and mccain of course is notorious
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:51.320]  for brow beating all the witnesses including the po w families and
[1:39:51.320 --> 1:39:57.640]  and uh carrey went along with changes in the law that simply put
[1:39:57.640 --> 1:40:01.240]  locked away somewhere forever all the documents
[1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:05.000]  that proved the prisoners were abandoned so
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:09.560]  you can see the extent of the corruption in the evil this
[1:40:09.560 --> 1:40:13.480]  john mccain on the right is john carrey on the left
[1:40:13.480 --> 1:40:17.800]  it's the republicans it's the democrats it's all the presidential
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:20.600]  appointees with the exception of those two
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:25.800]  secretaries of uh of defense and and reagan's
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:30.040]  national security advisor doc doc doc is somebody approaching with a vacuum
[1:40:30.040 --> 1:40:33.800]  cleaner no uh okay because it there's a
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:36.760]  little bit of a hum in the background and it and it's just increased a little
[1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:39.800]  bit i don't want it to uh some of it was drowning you out but that's important
[1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:43.880]  info you're covering so we see the method of the control
[1:40:43.880 --> 1:40:47.560]  uh in fact from some of the documents i've seen in research
[1:40:47.560 --> 1:40:51.240]  this is a system of corruption they like to get
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:54.680]  the entire government different power structures
[1:40:54.680 --> 1:40:59.880]  involved in a huge cover-up because then later it can also be used to blackmail
[1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:03.560]  and that's what special forces commanders and many others that we've talked to
[1:41:03.560 --> 1:41:07.320]  who've worked on this have said is that the north vietnamese
[1:41:07.320 --> 1:41:10.760]  are blackmailing the the federal government
[1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:15.080]  uh to this day because the federal government made that
[1:41:15.080 --> 1:41:19.640]  uh move to not get our troops out because they decided okay we'll pull out of
[1:41:19.640 --> 1:41:22.600]  there we're done we don't want the north you know who's
[1:41:22.600 --> 1:41:26.120]  taken over the south to be able to use this as a blue chip against us
[1:41:26.120 --> 1:41:29.560]  we'll just call these troops expendable hardware and the and the
[1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:32.360]  communists are sitting there going well this is perfect
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:35.480]  we'll keep them and then they'll go along with the cover-up
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:38.680]  and then and then we've always got this ace in the hole
[1:41:38.680 --> 1:41:43.880]  exactly that's right and anybody in in the american
[1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:47.080]  government that talks is simply out of the government
[1:41:47.080 --> 1:41:50.680]  they go from being a a high official to a nobody
[1:41:50.680 --> 1:41:55.000]  so this is how the government gets away with the slides and of course the american
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:58.920]  people or or so many of them are just gullible
[1:41:58.920 --> 1:42:03.640]  they're just terribly gullible and they have this sort of
[1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:07.800]  faith and trust in government that americans didn't used to have i blamed
[1:42:07.800 --> 1:42:13.480]  that on franklin roosevelt who in the great depression
[1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:19.000]  trying to rally people gave them the idea which they've had ever since that
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:22.600]  the government is their protector and then it's going to put a chicken in
[1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:26.680]  every pot and and keep them safe you see
[1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:31.080]  and not and as and as we've talked about many times on your program
[1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:33.960]  this was the line of the bush cheney regime
[1:42:33.960 --> 1:42:38.200]  that oh we're going to take away all your civil liberties and destroy the
[1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:42.440]  constitution in order to make you safe with terrorists
[1:42:42.440 --> 1:42:47.640]  and people just are gullible and they and they fall for it and so
[1:42:47.640 --> 1:42:51.480]  it's not really hard for government to pull off things
[1:42:51.480 --> 1:42:56.840]  like 9-11 because all it has to do is give some kind of explanation and
[1:42:56.840 --> 1:43:00.440]  people believe it they don't say hey the government did this
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:04.680]  that's not their first thought it never enters
[1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:12.760]  it's always oh some some tiny group of muslims who
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:18.760]  can't even fly airplanes they did they did
[1:43:18.760 --> 1:43:23.560]  but you know perhaps to repeat myself the fact that
[1:43:23.560 --> 1:43:26.680]  this story is now getting out and getting some attention
[1:43:26.680 --> 1:43:31.320]  about the POWs because that really touches at the heart of american
[1:43:31.320 --> 1:43:34.040]  patriotism doesn't it i mean that really touches
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:38.680]  the flag waivers the the people who want to kill them over there before they
[1:43:38.680 --> 1:43:43.880]  come over here it it really cuts the to the very hard
[1:43:43.880 --> 1:43:48.360]  of the most conservative people the people who are most willing to go to
[1:43:48.360 --> 1:43:51.400]  war to achieve whatever the government says
[1:43:51.400 --> 1:43:54.680]  if it turns out that the government is actually abandoned
[1:43:54.680 --> 1:43:59.720]  its own soldiers then it could possibly shake some of those people
[1:43:59.720 --> 1:44:05.240]  it could possibly cause more skepticism among the public
[1:44:05.240 --> 1:44:08.600]  and and it could lead to the unraveling
[1:44:08.600 --> 1:44:15.000]  of other massive lives and conspiracies well dr paul roberts let me
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:19.960]  expand on that because from my research uh and i mean it's on
[1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:24.040]  record this happened there was over 20 000 u.s trips
[1:44:24.040 --> 1:44:28.440]  in german POW camps that were grabbed by the russians
[1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:34.280]  uh and uh by then uh roosevelt had died and and harry truman
[1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:39.400]  you know said stallens are ally and basically we're not going to get into
[1:44:39.400 --> 1:44:42.600]  fight with him they gave him half of eastern europe they gave him half of
[1:44:42.600 --> 1:44:47.560]  germany uh that's the thing that uh made uh
[1:44:47.560 --> 1:44:51.160]  and now documents have come out on this that's what caused patent to have a
[1:44:51.160 --> 1:44:57.800]  complete conniption fit uh and so they killed him
[1:44:57.800 --> 1:45:01.800]  and so this has been a policy for a while
[1:45:01.800 --> 1:45:06.040]  that troops are just expendable animals as henry kissinger said
[1:45:06.040 --> 1:45:09.480]  and so this this goes back even to the greatest generation
[1:45:09.480 --> 1:45:12.600]  and i would challenge you know all these Pulitzer prize winning people
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:16.680]  to go look into that because that's hidden in plain view as well
[1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:22.680]  yes i think you're right the people you know frederick bon hayek in his book
[1:45:22.680 --> 1:45:26.760]  the road to serfdom he has a chapter why the worst
[1:45:26.760 --> 1:45:32.040]  always get on top and that goes not just for uh
[1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:37.720]  totalitarian systems but for democracies the worst rise to the top
[1:45:37.720 --> 1:45:41.240]  and we certainly have the worst people in the country
[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:44.920]  in washington that's where the worst people are and
[1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:49.000]  and these kinds of people don't have compulsion
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:55.880]  they don't have shame they're not moral they have ruthless
[1:45:55.880 --> 1:46:03.480]  agendas that feature themselves and that is why democracy
[1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:07.240]  itself is no protection from a ruthless
[1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:10.040]  government well that's why you've got to have the republic where the minority as
[1:46:10.040 --> 1:46:13.160]  well as the majority is protected and i've done a general research of history
[1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:17.080]  i don't claim to be a historian but i read history books almost every day
[1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:20.520]  as you know my entertainment that's how i actually got informed as a
[1:46:20.520 --> 1:46:23.800]  as an adolescent and a teenager was because i happened to pick up history
[1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:27.240]  as a form of entertainment and not knowing i was educating myself on the
[1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:30.200]  way the world works but really studying our founding
[1:46:30.200 --> 1:46:34.520]  fathers they weren't perfect but there was western expansion
[1:46:34.520 --> 1:46:39.080]  they wanted to be left alone by the bigger mafia the you know the crown
[1:46:39.080 --> 1:46:42.440]  to build their own little systems and so they created a system to
[1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:47.800]  restrain the avarice of king rats of the strong men
[1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:50.920]  and that's why this country produced half the world's wealth
[1:46:50.920 --> 1:46:54.520]  only four percent of the population so one of the few times in history
[1:46:54.520 --> 1:46:57.720]  the flower of the renaissance and now watching that
[1:46:57.720 --> 1:47:01.960]  being drugged down and being used as the engine of world tyranny
[1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:08.840]  it's it's it's it's very frustrating yes it is very frustrating
[1:47:08.840 --> 1:47:13.560]  but if we can just keep making people aware that
[1:47:13.560 --> 1:47:18.920]  every american government since nixon has covered up the abandonment
[1:47:18.920 --> 1:47:25.720]  of american prisons of war and you know we have this definitely proved
[1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:30.520]  in the case of bit now and may well be proved in the case of the world war two
[1:47:30.520 --> 1:47:36.280]  prisons but this should help bring the
[1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:40.520]  sort of most gullible flag-waving patrons
[1:47:40.520 --> 1:47:43.560]  to some realization that the government isn't trustworthy
[1:47:43.560 --> 1:47:47.640]  and that doesn't look after anyone's interest not even
[1:47:47.640 --> 1:47:53.240]  the soldiers that are out there giving up their lives and limbs well what
[1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:55.720]  about this issue they asked the troops to torture
[1:47:55.720 --> 1:47:58.760]  they asked them to execute people in afghanistan illegally
[1:47:58.760 --> 1:48:03.240]  which then corrupts them and then every time it comes out like Abu Ghraib
[1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:07.000]  in iraq they then prosecute the people who on record
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  were following the white house memos and orders so it's not just that you'll be
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.960]  left behind it's that you'll be used up and
[1:48:13.960 --> 1:48:17.080]  then scapegoated later because there's no honor
[1:48:17.080 --> 1:48:21.000]  among these thieves that run the system that's exactly right i don't
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:25.400]  i don't know why anyone who was aware would have anything to do with the
[1:48:25.400 --> 1:48:29.640]  military i don't know why why anyone would join
[1:48:29.640 --> 1:48:34.520]  i can't understand why the students at west point and
[1:48:34.520 --> 1:48:39.960]  anapolis and the air force economy just don't get up in mass and walk out
[1:48:39.960 --> 1:48:46.600]  because they're going to be betrayed too or they're going to be used for evil
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:54.120]  and then betrayed and and and even if you don't want to be your force to go
[1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:57.640]  along with it or your careers destroyed but that's my point that there's a
[1:48:57.640 --> 1:49:02.200]  systematic evil throughout history we see hitler killing his brown shirts that
[1:49:02.200 --> 1:49:06.120]  brought him to power we see things that happen in every society
[1:49:06.120 --> 1:49:10.040]  it's like a tropism it's it's it's a pathology
[1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:14.680]  and corrupt elites that they their greatest glee
[1:49:14.680 --> 1:49:18.200]  is hanging their own attack dogs out to dry
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:21.080]  because if i was one of these evil people but i guess i'm not evil so i
[1:49:21.080 --> 1:49:24.360]  can't understand it i would at least defend my henchmen and my
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:27.880]  servants to have that the servant group my praetorian
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:32.760]  but but no they treat their praetorian like toilet paper
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:36.520]  that's right because they learn from the romans that the praetorian can
[1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:41.480]  take over the rule so stalin ends up killing his own
[1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:46.280]  heads of his secret police and his own colleagues in the politburo
[1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:51.000]  because they become they know that no one has any
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:54.840]  any integrity or morality and that they're all
[1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:59.720]  a fair game for one another so whoever strikes first and gets rid of the
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:04.040]  others is the survivor and that's how the system
[1:50:04.040 --> 1:50:10.440]  ends up eating it eating itself but of course what we we don't really care
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:14.280]  if the evil people eat each other up what we're worried about is that how
[1:50:14.280 --> 1:50:19.240]  they're destroying the rest of us who are not among their ranks
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:24.280]  and this is the fact that the american people need to
[1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:27.800]  wake up to then you keep telling them about every day
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:30.840]  well that's another issue i mean i've seen your transformation and research
[1:50:30.840 --> 1:50:33.480]  the last five six years we've been talking to you from saying
[1:50:33.480 --> 1:50:36.040]  they're just a bunch of nuts a bunch of croaks they don't know what they're
[1:50:36.040 --> 1:50:38.760]  doing just saying no this is clearly by design
[1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:43.000]  because all the evidence shows it is i want to briefly talk about the economy
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:47.560]  with you and all these headlines is europe heading for a meltdown

[1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:15.240]  the man who briefed Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush every morning
[1:54:15.240 --> 1:54:20.280]  he quotes CIA White House vocal officer that's what
[1:54:20.280 --> 1:54:23.400]  Fletcher Proudy did between the Pentagon and the CIA
[1:54:23.400 --> 1:54:27.320]  key person on what's happening in North Korea and Iran
[1:54:27.320 --> 1:54:30.760]  joining us for the last 52 minutes of the next hour
[1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:33.960]  doc for people watching on prisonplanet.tv
[1:54:33.960 --> 1:54:37.160]  i'm going to give them a document cam shot of this for radio listeners
[1:54:37.160 --> 1:54:42.520]  the headline is CIA unit's wacky idea depicts Saddam Hussein as gay
[1:54:42.520 --> 1:54:45.640]  and it's spy talk Jeff Stein you know little propagandist
[1:54:45.640 --> 1:54:49.160]  but in the seventh paragraph they just let it
[1:54:49.160 --> 1:54:54.360]  slip out the agency actually did make a video purporting to show a sum of
[1:54:54.360 --> 1:54:57.720]  bin Laden and his cronies sitting around a campfire
[1:54:57.720 --> 1:55:02.040]  swinging bottles of liquor and savoring their conquest with boys
[1:55:02.040 --> 1:55:06.200]  one of the former CIA officers recalled chuckling at the memory
[1:55:06.200 --> 1:55:10.840]  the actors were drawn from some of the darker skinned employees he said
[1:55:10.840 --> 1:55:14.200]  now i asked Dr. Roberts during the break because i mean i knew the answer but i
[1:55:14.200 --> 1:55:16.920]  wanted to get his tag just to see if he concurred
[1:55:16.920 --> 1:55:19.560]  why are they doing this doc why are they admitting they're growing
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:23.080]  opium in afghanistan and have our troops on tv saying they do it
[1:55:23.080 --> 1:55:26.680]  why are they admitting it was saying that they killed the same al-qaeda leader
[1:55:26.680 --> 1:55:30.440]  14 15 times never retract the last time they killed them
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:33.320]  why are they now just admitting the bin laden tapes are fake
[1:55:33.320 --> 1:55:36.840]  and uh he gave the answer that i agree with
[1:55:36.840 --> 1:55:41.400]  uh dr roberts tell folks why well i think alex what they're doing they're
[1:55:41.400 --> 1:55:46.360]  showing us that they're that they have immunity
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:50.600]  that they can do whatever they want they can do it openly and they can lie to us
[1:55:50.600 --> 1:55:55.240]  openly and they can tell us that they commit crimes
[1:55:55.240 --> 1:56:00.200]  and yet they don't suffer any consequences i think they're getting us
[1:56:00.200 --> 1:56:04.040]  accustomed and used to the fact that they can do
[1:56:04.040 --> 1:56:09.800]  whatever they want and even admit it and that uh we just have to sort of uh
[1:56:09.800 --> 1:56:16.360]  not notice and and and accept the fact that they are unaccountable
[1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:20.680]  and can do whatever they want so i you know it just makes you
[1:56:20.680 --> 1:56:25.960]  accept the culture of lies and you really and it makes the people realize
[1:56:25.960 --> 1:56:29.640]  that they're powerless here's the government that
[1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:33.080]  that lies to us and then admits it lies to us and then
[1:56:33.080 --> 1:56:37.000]  goes on and lies to us some more and then admits it some more
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:41.160]  and it's just kind of a way of showing the people that they don't count
[1:56:41.160 --> 1:56:44.920]  i'll expand on that though there was a city employee john villarreal who went
[1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:48.520]  to huntsville for three years and i i confirmed the city
[1:56:48.520 --> 1:56:52.280]  employee was stealing money and trying to shut down access tv four years ago
[1:56:52.280 --> 1:56:55.480]  five years ago now so i secretly recorded him put uh
[1:56:55.480 --> 1:56:58.200]  private investigators on him because that's where i started out i wasn't
[1:56:58.200 --> 1:57:00.920]  doing a show there anymore but i wanted to keep it alive
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:04.680]  and he came to me and i didn't have a camera rolling i was coming out of the
[1:57:04.680 --> 1:57:07.800]  bathroom at the telecommunications commission downtown
[1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:11.240]  he was waiting for me in the hall and i had my camera guy inside for the
[1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:15.160]  commission and he walked over and he shoved me in the chest
[1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:18.360]  and he said you bet i stole the money and i'm going to kill you and you're
[1:57:18.360 --> 1:57:21.320]  never going to stop me and i said that's a threat
[1:57:21.320 --> 1:57:24.520]  i'm going to send your ass to prison excuse my french folks
[1:57:24.520 --> 1:57:28.760]  and i did send him to prison so it's also kind of a bravado they do like
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:32.760]  yeah we made the fake tapes yeah we know you know we did it all
[1:57:32.760 --> 1:57:37.320]  so what and so i i don't think they're invincible and there is a wake-up call
[1:57:37.320 --> 1:57:40.600]  happening but i'm afraid they're going to start wars dr roberts
[1:57:40.600 --> 1:57:45.640]  as the smoke screen for what they're doing well i'm certainly going to start
[1:57:45.640 --> 1:57:49.160]  more wars there's no doubt about that
[1:57:50.280 --> 1:57:54.280]  it's just hope they don't get a nuclear war going with russia
[1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:57.560]  well we know cheney now it's come out really did want to start a war with him
[1:57:57.560 --> 1:58:01.400]  and that his whole 888 thing well that's been the whole
[1:58:01.400 --> 1:58:07.880]  neocon line for years they wanted the nuclear war with russia
[1:58:07.880 --> 1:58:12.680]  as part of the bravado yeah well let's talk briefly about the account yeah
[1:58:12.680 --> 1:58:15.080]  let's do that one minute break we're going to come back for five minutes with
[1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:18.600]  you but i mean we're here laughing about it it's gallows humor
[1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:24.600]  because they just it's tough you know we want nuclear war it's it's fun let's
[1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:27.720]  because they've got all the women all the whores all the money
[1:58:27.720 --> 1:58:31.640]  these guys are like hitler who would sit there watching war saw burn
[1:58:31.640 --> 1:58:34.760]  you know he would get up on the front line and watch from five miles away
[1:58:34.760 --> 1:58:38.520]  just because he liked watching buildings burn he liked watching stuka's drop
[1:58:38.520 --> 1:58:41.480]  drop bombs
[1:58:42.760 --> 1:58:49.480]  thank you for listening to gcm be sure to visit gcmlive.com today
[1:58:50.120 --> 1:58:55.080]  the question is where should the american people draw their line in the sand
[1:58:55.080 --> 1:59:00.200]  what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a
[1:59:00.200 --> 1:59:04.520]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule
[1:59:04.520 --> 1:59:07.480]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our
[1:59:07.480 --> 1:59:10.280]  land they think they're on our water children our
[1:59:10.280 --> 1:59:14.920]  education our money we have to define who we are and what we

[2:00:05.480 --> 2:00:10.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[2:00:10.200 --> 2:00:15.240]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones
[2:00:15.240 --> 2:00:22.040]  on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:22.040 --> 2:00:26.120]  okay dr paul craig roberts is our guest best-selling author syndicate of
[2:00:26.120 --> 2:00:30.680]  communists father of ergonomics we got about four and a half minutes
[2:00:30.680 --> 2:00:35.240]  the economy the meltdown accelerating uh...
[2:00:35.240 --> 2:00:40.040]  the goldman sacks emails where they knew that that the economy was going to
[2:00:40.040 --> 2:00:42.200]  implode they set up the derivative scam
[2:00:42.200 --> 2:00:47.160]  we have a red-handed sir well where is this going
[2:00:47.160 --> 2:00:51.640]  well uh... alex i think uh... what what we have is another criminal elite
[2:00:51.640 --> 2:00:55.800]  in charge of the financial sector they in charge of the treasury the federal
[2:00:55.800 --> 2:00:58.920]  reserve and and of course the new york investment
[2:00:58.920 --> 2:01:01.880]  banks and hedge funds now think about this for a minute
[2:01:01.880 --> 2:01:05.800]  uh... allegedly the euro is collapsing because of the greek debt
[2:01:05.800 --> 2:01:09.800]  now that makes no sense whatsoever greece is a small country
[2:01:09.800 --> 2:01:14.280]  its debts are cannot possibly be a threat to the euro
[2:01:14.280 --> 2:01:18.360]  so but we hear about this constantly over and over and over and over and so
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:22.760]  it's propaganda coming out of the hedge funds and making a killing on it
[2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:26.280]  if you can make the world think the euro is going to collapse you can make all
[2:01:26.280 --> 2:01:31.160]  kind of money shorting euro and it's the same
[2:01:31.160 --> 2:01:37.720]  crowd of crooks that sold the derivatives and uh... that and that sold
[2:01:37.720 --> 2:01:42.600]  uh... junk with triple a investment ratings on it and so that's what they're
[2:01:42.600 --> 2:01:45.800]  now doing this whole thing about the euro
[2:01:45.800 --> 2:01:50.920]  is uh... as a scam run by the hedge funds and they're getting rich off of it
[2:01:50.920 --> 2:01:54.840]  look the most indebted country in the world is japan
[2:01:54.840 --> 2:01:59.240]  and the second most indebted country is united states
[2:01:59.240 --> 2:02:04.280]  they're far worse conditions than than than uh...
[2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:09.160]  europe and yet it's europe that's in the news and
[2:02:09.160 --> 2:02:13.320]  and the euro is collapsing against the dollar why should anything collapse
[2:02:13.320 --> 2:02:18.840]  against the dollar the dollar this has massive trade deficit massive
[2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:24.360]  budget deficits they're unclosable the government is indebted
[2:02:24.360 --> 2:02:29.400]  up to over its head the population is indebted
[2:02:29.400 --> 2:02:32.120]  this is a far worse situation than in europe and yet
[2:02:32.120 --> 2:02:36.360]  it's the euro so what it really is it's a play of the new york investment banks
[2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:40.040]  in the hedge funds against the euro and uh...
[2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:44.280]  they're getting rich off of it just like they got rich off of derivatives
[2:02:44.280 --> 2:02:47.640]  and yeah they looted us two years ago and now they're looting europe and they're
[2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:51.640]  just like a group of carrion crows that fly around eating the flesh off our
[2:02:51.640 --> 2:02:57.400]  bones and the media doesn't ever explain it
[2:02:57.400 --> 2:03:02.280]  they just provide the free propaganda that keeps the money running into the
[2:03:02.280 --> 2:03:05.240]  hedge funds and the new york investment banks
[2:03:05.240 --> 2:03:10.440]  last night i was reading a uh... a manual of uh...
[2:03:10.440 --> 2:03:14.120]  british enable war college uh... documents on
[2:03:14.120 --> 2:03:17.480]  uh... pirate accounts from the sixteen seventeen eighteen hundreds
[2:03:17.480 --> 2:03:21.000]  and the the way this elite behaves is kind of like pirates where they just
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:24.680]  wildly wouldn't even pull the corks off whiskey bottles they would just
[2:03:24.680 --> 2:03:28.120]  hack the tops off and you know just drink it down
[2:03:28.120 --> 2:03:32.600]  so so there's a method of the madness doctor but overall do you agree that
[2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:35.480]  they're just complete out of control lunatics
[2:03:35.480 --> 2:03:41.800]  yes and in fact i would even say pirates had more honor
[2:03:41.800 --> 2:03:46.040]  so they're worse than pirates and uh...
[2:03:46.040 --> 2:03:50.600]  and nothing is being done about you notice the regulation
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:54.120]  of the bank of the financial system nothing happens
[2:03:54.120 --> 2:03:58.520]  or it's all watered down or it's turned into something that enables them to
[2:03:58.520 --> 2:04:01.400]  plunder more yeah now they're gonna take over all the
[2:04:01.400 --> 2:04:04.040]  little banks and track every purchase we make
[2:04:04.040 --> 2:04:10.040]  that's right uh... you'll see massive uh... financial concentration
[2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:14.040]  which is probably another reason for all this trouble that's probably
[2:04:14.040 --> 2:04:18.280]  what they're trying to do is to get rid of the
[2:04:18.280 --> 2:04:21.720]  of the large number of banks is just a few large ones you know it's
[2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:24.920]  it's the same thing they did to the media when they concentrated it in the
[2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:29.480]  hands of a few job firms so
[2:04:29.480 --> 2:04:34.440]  but nobody is going to tell people the congress isn't going to hold those
[2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:37.560]  kind of hearings and the the press is not going to do any
[2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:41.160]  investigation well doc good job on the on uh... reporting
[2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:44.600]  on uh... the huge breaking news of the p o w cover up
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:47.240]  completely confirmed by a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist

[2:08:19.960 --> 2:08:23.800]  iran sooner rather than later that's back on the front burner

[2:08:40.440 --> 2:08:45.000]  cia units wacky idea depicts the dom is gay
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:48.280]  that's not the issue buried in the washington post article they
[2:08:48.280 --> 2:08:52.760]  they quote the cia officers as producing fake bin laden videos
[2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:56.760]  now now people have looked at the video of the fat bin laden admitted it's fake
[2:08:56.760 --> 2:09:00.040]  they've had linguists listen to it it's not him not the dialect they've done
[2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:03.400]  voice print these tapes are basically all fake or old
[2:09:03.400 --> 2:09:06.840]  tapes of him re-edited i want to ask uh rama govern about that
[2:09:06.840 --> 2:09:11.560]  we're going to get into suddenly new york times washington post wall street
[2:09:11.560 --> 2:09:15.400]  journal fox news herald a revero with the marine core commander

[2:09:31.720 --> 2:09:36.520]  lot of news uh... on uh... you know that that front so we'll talk about it all
[2:09:36.520 --> 2:09:39.800]  rama govern was in vietnam by the way so we're gonna cover it all in the next
[2:09:39.800 --> 2:09:46.120]  hour uh... with him today uh... rama govern is a activist who writes and
[2:09:46.120 --> 2:09:50.120]  lectures all over the country and he's co-founder of veterans intelligence
[2:09:50.120 --> 2:09:55.000]  professionals for sanity uh... and we really appreciate him joining us he was
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:58.840]  one of the uh... chief uh... you know cia briefers
[2:09:58.840 --> 2:10:02.440]  of reagan uh... and bush senior and that's a key position
[2:10:02.440 --> 2:10:06.920]  uh... in a focal point position where you have pentagon liaison to cia
[2:10:06.920 --> 2:10:11.160]  you have cia liaison to white house the these focal officers like
[2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:16.120]  lecture proudy in the secret team uh... again have you have unique perspective
[2:10:16.120 --> 2:10:20.680]  on wide-ranging analysis and how it ties in not just specialist
[2:10:20.680 --> 2:10:23.640]  uh... so they can draw on all the specialist and so that's why it's such an
[2:10:23.640 --> 2:10:26.920]  important lens they have them on with us so i've thrown out there sir what i want
[2:10:26.920 --> 2:10:31.080]  to cover within the next fifty minutes uh... you've got the floor with what of
[2:10:31.080 --> 2:10:34.840]  that cornucopia that you think is most important in your breakdown on what
[2:10:34.840 --> 2:10:36.760]  we're facing
[2:10:36.760 --> 2:10:40.920]  thanks uh... first just to make sure that the record is correct
[2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:44.360]  i don't want to pull a boom and fall from connecticut here
[2:10:44.360 --> 2:10:49.560]  i didn't serve actually in vietnam i was an army infantry intelligence officer
[2:10:49.560 --> 2:10:54.440]  from sixty two to sixty four before vietnam really started
[2:10:54.440 --> 2:10:58.840]  and while it was going on i was the principal analyst at cia
[2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:02.680]  for soviet policy toward vietnam so i learned quite a bit about it
[2:11:02.680 --> 2:11:07.960]  but i never set foot in the country with respect to uh... what's going on here
[2:11:07.960 --> 2:11:11.080]  the most important thing that's happening today
[2:11:11.080 --> 2:11:16.120]  is that uh... david obi uh... chair of appropriations in the house
[2:11:16.120 --> 2:11:21.480]  is uh... letting some lipstick to go on the thirty three billion dollar
[2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:25.240]  appropriation for escalating war
[2:11:25.240 --> 2:11:29.160]  in afghanistan and that lipstick is twenty three billion
[2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:32.520]  for teachers so that they don't lose their jobs
[2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:39.000]  uh... don't be obi knows better uh... what he's done here is uh... bowed to the
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  uh... to the washington establishment that want to continue this war
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:46.600]  it looks very much as though what he will report out of his committee this
[2:11:46.600 --> 2:11:50.200]  evening is a uh... bill that includes twenty three
[2:11:50.200 --> 2:11:54.040]  billion for teachers keep the schools going and
[2:11:54.040 --> 2:11:57.720]  thirty three billion for afghanistan to keep that
[2:11:57.720 --> 2:12:01.320]  feckless war going and more and more and more people
[2:12:01.320 --> 2:12:07.560]  being killed uh... it's just really i was a former admirer of david obi and so i
[2:12:07.560 --> 2:12:11.800]  wrote him a uh... a memorandum that disappeared disappeared already on
[2:12:11.800 --> 2:12:15.800]  after downing street dot com i guess it's now called war is a crime
[2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:19.320]  dot org uh... and you can see uh... that uh...
[2:12:19.320 --> 2:12:23.240]  you know he's being completely disingenuous because as recently as two
[2:12:23.240 --> 2:12:29.000]  months ago he told the tv interviewer that uh... this afghanistan adventure
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:33.400]  it's a fool's errand but but if we're going to do it we have to
[2:12:33.400 --> 2:12:37.880]  pay for it you know we have to fully fund it now what kind of logic
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:42.680]  does that make alex it's a fool's errand but if we're going to do it we got to
[2:12:42.680 --> 2:12:44.680]  fund it well we'll write my government let me throw
[2:12:44.680 --> 2:12:47.480]  this out at you and then you can expand on your concern with what's happening
[2:12:47.480 --> 2:12:51.960]  afghanistan expanding into pakistan but in layman's terms i'm somebody who
[2:12:51.960 --> 2:12:54.200]  sits there and you know studies it for years
[2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:57.240]  and and and so i want your perspective and correct me if i'm wrong
[2:12:57.240 --> 2:13:00.760]  you've got all these pipelines going through their trillions of the aggregate
[2:13:00.760 --> 2:13:04.760]  of oil hundreds of billions in no bid contract black holes
[2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:08.200]  so uh... the defense lobby likes it the oil lobby likes it
[2:13:08.200 --> 2:13:11.400]  uh... israel likes it because uh... you know that gets the u.s. more
[2:13:11.400 --> 2:13:13.960]  firmly burrowed into the middle east and central asia
[2:13:13.960 --> 2:13:17.400]  so that lobby likes it uh... but more importantly
[2:13:17.400 --> 2:13:20.440]  five hundred billion a year ninety one percent now
[2:13:20.440 --> 2:13:25.480]  uh... was a lot lower of the opium pouring out into russia into asia
[2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:29.080]  kind of a replay of the boxer rebellion uh... part two
[2:13:29.080 --> 2:13:32.600]  and now our troops are admittedly over there protect protecting the poppy
[2:13:32.600 --> 2:13:36.760]  fields uh... and so i think you've got the uh... at least the contractors it's
[2:13:36.760 --> 2:13:39.160]  coming out that's a civil edmund said pre-911
[2:13:39.160 --> 2:13:42.760]  shipping the opium into turkey you name it and so it's really
[2:13:42.760 --> 2:13:47.720]  about narcotics uh... and so people look at the policy and say why are we there
[2:13:47.720 --> 2:13:52.200]  well we're really there because black ops likes five hundred billion dollars
[2:13:52.200 --> 2:13:56.440]  well that's part of it alex to be sure uh... the other part is a more
[2:13:56.440 --> 2:13:59.880]  kind of geopolitical uh... adventure here
[2:13:59.880 --> 2:14:02.920]  uh... imperialism is not dead
[2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:08.120]  uh... if you look at afghanistan you'll see that it's strategically located
[2:14:08.120 --> 2:14:13.320]  in the same neighborhood as china as iran as through russia really
[2:14:13.320 --> 2:14:17.320]  turkey iraq it's right there in the middle of things
[2:14:17.320 --> 2:14:23.400]  and uh... so the way the empire looks at things is well we gotta be in their
[2:14:23.400 --> 2:14:26.760]  first this with the most this uh... even if it's a
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:30.440]  mostly an attempt to deny the chinese or the russians or
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:34.520]  or the indians or whomever have from getting in there before we were
[2:14:34.520 --> 2:14:40.680]  now what what makes afghanistan strategic well one of the things that
[2:14:40.680 --> 2:14:45.000]  makes it strategic is that it lies directly beneath a country called
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:48.760]  torkmenistan which used to be part of the soviet union
[2:14:48.760 --> 2:14:54.120]  and torkmenistan has in it natural gas deposits worth
[2:14:54.120 --> 2:14:58.280]  all the oil under the sands of iraq
[2:14:58.280 --> 2:15:03.240]  now the problem is chevron's in there a lot of the oil companies are in there
[2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:06.840]  natural gas companies but you can't get it here
[2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:12.040]  from there okay you gotta do a pipeline and you can't have that pipeline go
[2:15:12.040 --> 2:15:16.360]  through russia you have to have it go south and guess what the next country
[2:15:16.360 --> 2:15:19.720]  is is afghanistan and then pakistan and then a
[2:15:19.720 --> 2:15:23.960]  little slice of india and at the terminal of this projected pipeline
[2:15:23.960 --> 2:15:26.520]  all the studies were done and was ready to go
[2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:31.000]  uh... guess what and ron was supposed to be the person marketing that that
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:34.680]  natural gas so the whole thing is as corrupt as can be
[2:15:34.680 --> 2:15:37.960]  the talib man visited houston texas when
[2:15:37.960 --> 2:15:41.160]  governor george bush expressed interest in
[2:15:41.160 --> 2:15:44.200]  and what was going on there with this pipeline
[2:15:44.200 --> 2:15:47.800]  our ambassador to afghanistan and later to iraq
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:52.120]  haridzad was one of the people involved in this and so was
[2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:56.120]  carzai yeah he was the unicol executive yeah
[2:15:56.120 --> 2:15:59.560]  so that's part of it now i'm not saying that the whole thing the whole thing
[2:15:59.560 --> 2:16:03.240]  the whole ball of wax involves the strategic location and
[2:16:03.240 --> 2:16:07.400]  what needs to happen here alex in my view is pretty simple
[2:16:07.400 --> 2:16:10.680]  there's a finite amount of oil there's a pipeline
[2:16:10.680 --> 2:16:14.280]  finite amount of natural gas in this in this world
[2:16:14.280 --> 2:16:19.160]  now if we're going to try to seize it all or seize control of it
[2:16:19.160 --> 2:16:23.320]  uh... then you know iraq can be looked on as simply the first
[2:16:23.320 --> 2:16:27.240]  resource war of the 21st century what we have to do
[2:16:27.240 --> 2:16:32.360]  is what my my four-year-old grandson learns in nursery school i went up and
[2:16:32.360 --> 2:16:36.440]  asked his teacher what do you what do you expect to to teach these kids they
[2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:41.160]  said oh that's simple we teach them that they have to learn to share
[2:16:41.160 --> 2:16:45.000]  a certain amount of toys on the table they have to they have to learn to share
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:48.120]  because there's a finite amount of the and i said wow
[2:16:48.120 --> 2:16:53.320]  there it is cheney bush even now obama they never went to this nursery school
[2:16:53.320 --> 2:16:56.600]  for sure what has to happen is we get together
[2:16:56.600 --> 2:17:01.080]  with the chinese the indians and other people who need that oil and gas
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:04.680]  figure out how to share it and jointly develop it instead i mean we go back to
[2:17:04.680 --> 2:17:09.400]  53 that's what caused the whole iran thing as you know
[2:17:09.400 --> 2:17:12.520]  mohammed mozadek said we're going to keep 25 percent of our own money
[2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:16.280]  to american the oil companies and british oil companies
[2:17:16.280 --> 2:17:21.560]  and they said no we get everything we overthrow you using the muslim extremist
[2:17:21.560 --> 2:17:25.160]  i mean it's the same story every time that's right well that was a company
[2:17:25.160 --> 2:17:28.600]  called bp actually which i think has been in the news
[2:17:28.600 --> 2:17:35.080]  lately you get a corrupt enterprise like british petroleum
[2:17:35.080 --> 2:17:42.600]  which controlled all the oil in iran prior to the revolution in 53
[2:17:42.600 --> 2:17:48.200]  and and if you let them persuade you to overthrow the governments there
[2:17:48.200 --> 2:17:52.920]  now then as night follows the day they will be filled with the
[2:17:52.920 --> 2:17:57.080]  uncontrollable hubris that they've did that they've demonstrated now in the
[2:17:57.080 --> 2:18:00.200]  Gulf of mexico and the people of the world the
[2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:04.920]  simple people like you and me alex have a real real problem
[2:18:04.920 --> 2:18:09.160]  and it's the same thing over and over again i think well what was bp called
[2:18:09.160 --> 2:18:13.720]  anglo-american oil yeah that's what they call themselves that wasn't bp is a
[2:18:13.720 --> 2:18:15.960]  direct descendant no exactly it's the same company you're
[2:18:15.960 --> 2:18:18.360]  absolutely right in that dutch partnership but
[2:18:18.360 --> 2:18:22.360]  but i mean it's the same players over and over again
[2:18:22.360 --> 2:18:27.080]  yeah well it's just that they are so powerful
[2:18:27.080 --> 2:18:33.080]  and here's here's obama you know he was asked just a half hour ago at his press
[2:18:33.080 --> 2:18:36.120]  conference you know do you feel a little funny about the
[2:18:36.120 --> 2:18:40.120]  about that the decision you made two weeks before the
[2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:43.240]  oil blow up in the Gulf when you said that the
[2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:47.720]  yeah we have to drill offshore and these companies you know have reduced the
[2:18:47.720 --> 2:18:53.800]  dangers greatly and he said well um you know i still
[2:18:53.800 --> 2:18:58.600]  think we have to drill offshore but you know my mistake was taking the
[2:18:58.600 --> 2:19:02.120]  word of of the company's wealth for pete's sake
[2:19:02.120 --> 2:19:05.000]  of course they take the word for the of the company look who
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:08.600]  look at the people that they had in the interior department
[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:12.520]  people who are still there taking bribes and everything else from the oil
[2:19:12.520 --> 2:19:17.240]  companies the system is corrupt what what well mama should have done is come in
[2:19:17.240 --> 2:19:20.920]  got rid of all those people giving them jobs in the library if he couldn't fire
[2:19:20.920 --> 2:19:25.000]  them and and get some real real control over
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:28.440]  these precious resources despite the you know the
[2:19:28.440 --> 2:19:33.800]  avarice and the and the desire people like bp to control
[2:19:33.800 --> 2:19:36.920]  control this important resource okay redmond governor stay there let's come
[2:19:36.920 --> 2:19:41.000]  back and get your breakdown of where you see
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:45.160]  afghanistan and pakistan going and then to the west

[2:19:48.760 --> 2:19:52.600]  is it green light to go into iran who will hit

[2:24:31.160 --> 2:24:35.720]  short segment long segment coming up uh rey when i interrupted you earlier with
[2:24:35.720 --> 2:24:40.360]  some other questions about why they're there uh where do you see afghanistan
[2:24:40.360 --> 2:24:43.720]  going i mean two weeks ago they they said a thousand drones
[2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:47.640]  are being dispatched for pakistan and afghanistan and that
[2:24:47.640 --> 2:24:50.520]  now they don't have to identify somebody before they kill them
[2:24:50.520 --> 2:24:54.360]  just if you look like you're a terrorist kind of like those kids in bagdad
[2:24:54.360 --> 2:24:58.120]  in the minivan looked like terrorists and reporters with cameras look like
[2:24:58.120 --> 2:25:00.520]  terrorist i mean this this sounds like an incredible
[2:25:00.520 --> 2:25:05.320]  escalation it sounds like lbj in 1966
[2:25:05.320 --> 2:25:09.480]  well uh play you should mention that alex because i was thinking of this uh
[2:25:09.480 --> 2:25:15.880]  wonderful new uh airplane aircraft that had been developed around then
[2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:21.160]  it was called a b-52 and uh you know that was going to solve all our problems
[2:25:21.160 --> 2:25:24.920]  in vietnam uh what we're going to do is bomb the
[2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:30.760]  hell out of the ho chi min trail and lbj came to us intelligence types and
[2:25:30.760 --> 2:25:34.600]  said these blue-suited generals are telling me this will do it
[2:25:34.600 --> 2:25:39.800]  then what do you think now we suppressed the laugh you know having
[2:25:39.800 --> 2:25:44.520]  having known about the effect of the aircraft in world war two
[2:25:44.520 --> 2:25:49.240]  and knowing that it simply increases the resistance of populations like the
[2:25:49.240 --> 2:25:53.800]  vietnamese and we waited two days and then we gave them an estimate we used to
[2:25:53.800 --> 2:25:57.880]  do national intelligence estimates and now they're not done very much
[2:25:57.880 --> 2:26:01.480]  anymore and we told the president look at mr president
[2:26:01.480 --> 2:26:05.560]  ho chi min is not the kind of person who's going to give up under how many
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:10.200]  b-52s or how heavy the bombs they dropped and besides mr president
[2:26:10.200 --> 2:26:14.120]  you should be aware that the ho chi min trail doesn't look anything like
[2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:20.760]  oh i-81 or i-95 or the george washington memorial parkway
[2:26:20.760 --> 2:26:25.080]  you can't even see it from the from the air and in many respects it
[2:26:25.080 --> 2:26:29.000]  it's about 181 trails mr president ain't no way
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:33.160]  the b-52s are going to do the job now we were right of course
[2:26:33.160 --> 2:26:37.320]  but the corollary there is the president doesn't have to eat intelligence
[2:26:37.320 --> 2:26:41.000]  he just didn't want to lose a war and so as well as try these blue-sided
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:44.600]  these blue-suited guys you know they might be right and so we tried it and we
[2:26:44.600 --> 2:26:47.240]  know the answer now similarly here we are over
[2:26:47.240 --> 2:26:52.440]  afghanistan we have this new weapon which most people don't realize alex and
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:56.360]  i knew about this when it was being developed it was developed for a
[2:26:56.360 --> 2:27:00.520]  specific purpose and that purpose only and that was to give us a hovering
[2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:04.920]  capability where we could monitor developments on the ground
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:08.120]  more than two times a day two times a day being
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:11.640]  when the satellites would pass over these areas okay
[2:27:11.640 --> 2:27:15.960]  now we got this thing developed it worked beautifully and then it was shown
[2:27:15.960 --> 2:27:19.400]  to some general in the pentagon and he said
[2:27:19.400 --> 2:27:23.000]  i want to see the tank i want to destroy the tank
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:26.840]  put some missiles on that bird therefore
[2:27:26.840 --> 2:27:33.720]  you get predators you get reapers with hellfire missiles and you get an awful
[2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:38.280]  lot of disenchantment and hostility out of the people in pakistan in
[2:27:38.280 --> 2:27:41.560]  particular that are being bombed to hell by these things
[2:27:41.560 --> 2:27:46.280]  it's looked on as a very cowardly thing that's right at a primitive level
[2:27:46.280 --> 2:27:49.800]  having like terminator machines out of the sky bombing you
[2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:53.000]  and it's literally 22 year old zit face kids
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:56.600]  in trailers thousands of miles away
[2:27:56.600 --> 2:28:01.880]  in a in a video game setup uh and go ahead you got a wedding we think well
[2:28:01.880 --> 2:28:05.560]  some guys got a gun in there everybody's got guns in those countries
[2:28:05.560 --> 2:28:09.480]  they mean it's a tribal you know red-blooded type area and they you
[2:28:09.480 --> 2:28:13.240]  know they kill 100 innocent people now you've created a thousand enemies
[2:28:13.240 --> 2:28:16.760]  because their entire family and every cousin they've got who may have loved
[2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:19.480]  america back in the 80s they're ready to kill
[2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:23.480]  they're ready to trade their life to kill americans and so the ideas pump more
[2:28:23.480 --> 2:28:27.560]  americans in that's exactly right and you know people
[2:28:27.560 --> 2:28:31.800]  have asked me these hellfire missiles are are they accurate
[2:28:31.800 --> 2:28:36.200]  and i say well yeah they are they're they're they're extremely accurate
[2:28:36.200 --> 2:28:39.640]  uh they're more accurate than anything we've had up till now but
[2:28:39.640 --> 2:28:43.640]  question is how do you identify the target
[2:28:43.640 --> 2:28:48.600]  now you know you can really tell what a militant is from 30 000 feet can't you
[2:28:48.600 --> 2:28:52.040]  give me a break you can really find out who the
[2:28:52.040 --> 2:28:55.720]  taliban and the al-qaeda types are by asking
[2:28:55.720 --> 2:29:00.120]  their neighbors who have these these uh asking people's neighbors who have
[2:29:00.120 --> 2:29:04.200]  unsatisfied grudges against them the the targets are
[2:29:04.200 --> 2:29:07.720]  are the name of the game and if you get targets
[2:29:07.720 --> 2:29:11.960]  from people who have grudges or from 22 year olds
[2:29:11.960 --> 2:29:15.960]  looking from 30 000 feet up you got a real problem
[2:29:15.960 --> 2:29:20.680]  what what really tells what i find really telling alexis
[2:29:20.680 --> 2:29:24.680]  these are reapers and and these predators interesting the
[2:29:24.680 --> 2:29:28.600]  the labels that give these aircraft uh they're controlled

[2:35:16.120 --> 2:35:19.480]  into they're out in nevada it's one of the main command
[2:35:19.480 --> 2:35:22.520]  centers i've ever seen it on the news people in trailers
[2:35:22.520 --> 2:35:26.680]  and and he's like it showed one of the young men he goes
[2:35:26.680 --> 2:35:30.200]  i love video games now i control the predator
[2:35:30.200 --> 2:35:33.080]  and it showed him sitting there and they're going okay you've got clearance
[2:35:33.080 --> 2:35:37.800]  hit him go ahead and give it to him and i mean just it's it's it's so bizarre
[2:35:37.800 --> 2:35:41.480]  to see this break it down for us well um
[2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:46.280]  let me put it this way the chaplains out there at creche air force base
[2:35:46.280 --> 2:35:50.360]  they're working overtime because some of these young fellas
[2:35:50.360 --> 2:35:54.120]  have a conscience they do their work during the day they go
[2:35:54.120 --> 2:35:57.320]  home and have uh have they're not with their families and they think
[2:35:57.320 --> 2:36:03.000]  hmm the wife says well we'll have to have things go at work today and uh
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:07.080]  they can't quite say well we killed you know we
[2:36:07.080 --> 2:36:11.880]  shot hellfire missiles at 30 groups and we're not real sure
[2:36:11.880 --> 2:36:17.240]  so long story short these chaplains are actually being visited regularly by
[2:36:17.240 --> 2:36:20.840]  these poor nco's who are ordered to do this kind of thing and have it on their
[2:36:20.840 --> 2:36:24.760]  conscience to their credit the other guys now the other guys
[2:36:24.760 --> 2:36:28.440]  are the ones in langley virginia who are working for the cia
[2:36:28.440 --> 2:36:32.040]  they're the ones that have the joysticks there and they're the ones that fly
[2:36:32.040 --> 2:36:35.800]  over pakistan why well because we're
[2:36:35.800 --> 2:36:40.680]  literally or at least technically not at war with pakistan so it has to be the
[2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:43.160]  cia it can't be the air force well it's the same
[2:36:43.160 --> 2:36:49.240]  sort of thing people who uh identify these targets either from people who
[2:36:49.240 --> 2:36:53.080]  may have grievances against this particular village or
[2:36:53.080 --> 2:36:59.160]  um people who see think they see uh militants whatever they look like as
[2:36:59.160 --> 2:37:03.480]  distinguished from wedding parties from 30 000 feet so
[2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:09.960]  you know the whole thing is is an indication of of the lack of
[2:37:09.960 --> 2:37:14.120]  leadership in the military of our country as well as the political side
[2:37:14.120 --> 2:37:18.680]  because you can't win a war this way all you can do is alienate the
[2:37:18.680 --> 2:37:24.360]  affections of people and what i keep telling people is that in pakistan
[2:37:24.360 --> 2:37:29.160]  if you take the population of pakistan 165 170 million
[2:37:29.160 --> 2:37:35.240]  okay that's 40 million more than the population of afghanistan
[2:37:35.240 --> 2:37:41.640]  iran and iraq put together besides of course pakistan has nuclear weapons
[2:37:41.640 --> 2:37:47.000]  now which i i would i would ask you which country should be the most important
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:51.320]  not to alienate the population in well sir we've seen pakistani leaders and
[2:37:51.320 --> 2:37:55.400]  we've got an article up on info wars dot com that's got the newscast and even
[2:37:55.400 --> 2:37:59.240]  abc news with pakistani leaders saying look your
[2:37:59.240 --> 2:38:02.360]  government is running a lot of the taliban and al-qaeda and you're and
[2:38:02.360 --> 2:38:06.680]  they're using it to destabilize our country and you know and that's what
[2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:12.280]  hameed ghoul who i was bizarrely contacted by a year and a half ago and
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:15.560]  he came on this show and it made national news when he did
[2:38:15.560 --> 2:38:19.960]  and and he said that they're killing these tribal groups to actually get them
[2:38:19.960 --> 2:38:23.560]  up in arms and that's what gerald salente the trans forecaster says he says
[2:38:23.560 --> 2:38:27.160]  look the u.s. government isn't going to have to stage terror attacks
[2:38:27.160 --> 2:38:30.520]  as a pretext to get the american people to give their liberty up you kill enough
[2:38:30.520 --> 2:38:34.200]  pakistanis who who are tribal they're going to come over here and they're
[2:38:34.200 --> 2:38:36.920]  going to blow stuff up
[2:38:36.920 --> 2:38:40.520]  well we've seen the effects of that haven't we uh...
[2:38:40.520 --> 2:38:44.920]  you know when when boys said we have to kill them over there before they come
[2:38:44.920 --> 2:38:48.760]  here well you know that was ridiculous in the
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:53.160]  extreme what we need to do is figure out what's really going on in
[2:38:53.160 --> 2:38:56.440]  those countries why they why they hate us you know it ain't
[2:38:56.440 --> 2:38:59.640]  it ain't because of our democracy or of our freedom
[2:38:59.640 --> 2:39:03.720]  now with respect to the pakistanis uh... you can see
[2:39:03.720 --> 2:39:09.640]  u.s. high-level pronouncements say with with we're working on the pakistanis to
[2:39:09.640 --> 2:39:14.200]  to show them to demonstrate that their greatest threat is not from india no
[2:39:14.200 --> 2:39:18.120]  no it's it's from these insurgents these militants these people that are in the
[2:39:18.120 --> 2:39:21.640]  tribal areas right well give me a break
[2:39:21.640 --> 2:39:26.680]  there's no kind of rhetoric or logic that is going to persuade the pakistanis
[2:39:26.680 --> 2:39:30.440]  that their main enemy is in india of course it is
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:34.440]  and so why do they keep feeding the Taliban why do they keep making it
[2:39:34.440 --> 2:39:40.040]  difficult for the u.s. and the job there because they see an advantage in keeping
[2:39:40.040 --> 2:39:43.160]  the pot boiling in afghanistan they don't want
[2:39:43.160 --> 2:39:47.720]  they don't want an indian dominated government in afghanistan
[2:39:47.720 --> 2:39:52.040]  they want to keep the pot boiling and so all these pronouncements about the u.s.
[2:39:52.040 --> 2:39:54.360]  you know we're going to proudly persuade them well
[2:39:54.360 --> 2:39:57.880]  we're going to persuade them that their strategic interest is not
[2:39:57.880 --> 2:40:01.720]  in india but in these give me a break we're never going to persuade them of
[2:40:01.720 --> 2:40:04.760]  that and so this thing will just keep going and going
[2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:09.160]  and the worst news of course is that our congressional people even the good
[2:40:09.160 --> 2:40:11.960]  ones like dave obi have now caved again
[2:40:11.960 --> 2:40:15.160]  and it looks like there will be an escalation to the tune of
[2:40:15.160 --> 2:40:19.800]  thirty three billion dollars and that will buy many more months of killing
[2:40:19.800 --> 2:40:23.960]  and war people can go to common dreams website and others
[2:40:23.960 --> 2:40:27.560]  uh... and read your new article give folks that title again one more time right
[2:40:27.560 --> 2:40:31.560]  well it's a letter to david obi who's the head of appropriations
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:35.800]  uh... it's a memo that uh... that says look uh... you know you you called
[2:40:35.800 --> 2:40:40.840]  afghanistan a fools errand and then you said
[2:40:40.840 --> 2:40:45.400]  yeah but we have to fund it that doesn't make any logical sense dave
[2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:48.600]  what's really going on here and what's really going on here
[2:40:48.600 --> 2:40:53.320]  is he's out of there and in january he wants to not alienate the affections
[2:40:53.320 --> 2:40:56.680]  of the washington establishment and he's letting go
[2:40:56.680 --> 2:41:00.440]  to the house a bill that will include enough lipstick
[2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:03.560]  namely a twenty three billion for teachers
[2:41:03.560 --> 2:41:06.760]  so that the thirty three billion for afghanistan war
[2:41:06.760 --> 2:41:10.760]  will go through that is unconscionable he knows better than that
[2:41:10.760 --> 2:41:15.400]  and he can call me an idiot liberal or that's what he calls some of my friends
[2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:19.480]  but what i'm telling him is that he's a terrible disappointment because he
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:23.240]  should have stood his ground and not to confess to be
[2:41:23.240 --> 2:41:27.320]  quote bone tired and again right this has nothing to do with
[2:41:27.320 --> 2:41:29.560]  liberal conservative it's right and wrong
[2:41:29.560 --> 2:41:34.760]  obama is expanding the wars bush expanded it this is the policy
[2:41:34.760 --> 2:41:37.880]  of the establishment but but just briefly because i want to get into
[2:41:37.880 --> 2:41:40.760]  iran in the north korea on the time we've got left with you a pick in your
[2:41:40.760 --> 2:41:43.880]  brain we appreciate the time and of course you just come on under goodness
[2:41:43.880 --> 2:41:47.160]  you're hard to do it i wish you had a book or something we could promote for
[2:41:47.160 --> 2:41:50.760]  folks to get your word out even more but hopefully that's coming in the future
[2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:52.440]  but over the years you've been so gracious
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:57.000]  is my point what is the exit strategy is the exit strategy
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:00.680]  never leave like germany or japan or south korea
[2:42:00.680 --> 2:42:04.600]  i mean is the exit strategy quagmire
[2:42:04.600 --> 2:42:09.960]  well i asked the honey zad former ambassador in afghanistan he's actually
[2:42:09.960 --> 2:42:14.920]  actually in afghan i asked him at a rand conference two months ago i said
[2:42:14.920 --> 2:42:19.080]  you know you don't say much about the oil pipeline anymore or the gas
[2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:22.600]  natural gas pipelines to afghanistan what where does that stand you were in on that
[2:42:22.600 --> 2:42:26.360]  from the beginning and he thought for a second and he said
[2:42:26.360 --> 2:42:32.440]  well um you know with all the violence and
[2:42:32.440 --> 2:42:35.880]  and all the fighting there along the pipeline route
[2:42:35.880 --> 2:42:40.120]  um we can't possibly build it right now
[2:42:40.120 --> 2:42:43.480]  now i wasn't allowed to follow up but boy follow was going to be
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:49.080]  oh so so that's why we're there uh to put down the violence to get the
[2:42:49.080 --> 2:42:53.240]  Taliban out of there and then clear a path for the oil and gas pipeline that
[2:42:53.240 --> 2:42:57.960]  is the ambassador how you've done so you know it's a
[2:42:57.960 --> 2:43:01.640]  it's a strategic sort of thing where where the us will not
[2:43:01.640 --> 2:43:05.480]  the act in any other way than as an empire
[2:43:05.480 --> 2:43:08.680]  and you need to have a little bit of humility because we're not going to be
[2:43:08.680 --> 2:43:11.080]  able to call the shots in that part of the world anymore
[2:43:11.080 --> 2:43:14.120]  well here's my next question you i mean as you know you've studied it more than
[2:43:14.120 --> 2:43:18.440]  more than most out there nobody's ever been able to successfully continually
[2:43:18.440 --> 2:43:21.560]  conquer these people i mean can you just briefly
[2:43:21.560 --> 2:43:25.640]  sum up in maybe two minutes the mindset of these tribal groups these
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:29.640]  pastures and others in afghanistan and in areas of pakistan
[2:43:29.640 --> 2:43:32.760]  because from my layman research and what every other analyst
[2:43:32.760 --> 2:43:36.760]  going back 400 years people who fought there have said is
[2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:41.640]  the more you kill them the more they fight uh just like americans used to be i
[2:43:41.640 --> 2:43:44.920]  mean i mean you know what happened with the british here i mean that's what any
[2:43:44.920 --> 2:43:47.880]  red-blooded group is going to do they're not going to stop fighting
[2:43:47.880 --> 2:43:50.840]  they're you know they're not drinking fluoride and watching i love lucy
[2:43:50.840 --> 2:43:56.840]  they're not fat dumb happy americans well i'd rather be you know back in 1776
[2:43:56.840 --> 2:44:00.520]  i sure would rather have been an insurgent rather than a you know
[2:44:00.520 --> 2:44:04.760]  cooperator with the tories um in a word um
[2:44:04.760 --> 2:44:08.920]  there are these strange people in afghanistan
[2:44:08.920 --> 2:44:13.960]  they're in tribes mostly and they have this strange resistance to
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:18.840]  invaders coming into the country and they have the benefit of these huge
[2:44:18.840 --> 2:44:22.680]  mountains and very vulnerable valleys and so
[2:44:22.680 --> 2:44:27.960]  going back 2500 years alex to alexander the great
[2:44:27.960 --> 2:44:33.560]  who was the first of about seven big countries trying to conquer afghanistan
[2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:37.160]  uh they've been able to the tribal leaders have been able to
[2:44:37.160 --> 2:44:43.160]  to uh to block block that and you know what i tell people is you know why they
[2:44:43.160 --> 2:44:46.840]  they call alexander the great well they call him the great because he was
[2:44:46.840 --> 2:44:49.560]  sensible enough to look at the height of those mountains
[2:44:49.560 --> 2:44:53.560]  to look at the the casualties he was already taking out his flanks from these
[2:44:53.560 --> 2:44:58.360]  quote militants and turn around and say this wasn't a good idea i'm going back
[2:44:58.360 --> 2:45:01.800]  to asia minor where i'll you know i can loud last all this
[2:45:01.800 --> 2:45:06.040]  that's what made him great from him since him you have the
[2:45:06.040 --> 2:45:11.160]  the indians you have the persians you have the mongolians under genghis khan
[2:45:11.160 --> 2:45:14.600]  you have the british you have the russians and now the americans are
[2:45:14.600 --> 2:45:19.640]  going to succeed where all those didn't give me a break
[2:45:19.640 --> 2:45:22.920]  oh boy so what we're going to be there in five years still it's just never going
[2:45:22.920 --> 2:45:26.680]  to end a meat grinder they feed troops into and out of it comes
[2:45:26.680 --> 2:45:31.080]  oil pipelines and opium well i'm hopeful that the american people you know if
[2:45:31.080 --> 2:45:36.040]  they listen to people like us uh finally i think i have a basic faith in the
[2:45:36.040 --> 2:45:39.480]  american people they're good sense and i think there's a limit to what they
[2:45:39.480 --> 2:45:43.320]  will tolerate the big big challenge of course alex and
[2:45:43.320 --> 2:45:47.000]  the reason i i come on your show and applaud what you're doing is
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:50.520]  is that you are one of the few people that tell it like it is
[2:45:50.520 --> 2:45:53.560]  you're not done to the uh fawning corporate media
[2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:56.920]  and that's what we need we need people to listen and then act
[2:45:56.920 --> 2:46:01.160]  and i think action is necessary right now well again for those who just join us
[2:46:01.160 --> 2:46:05.000]  i'm not heaping laurels on you sir but people need to know you've been right
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:08.920]  a full year and a half before it came out with sigh herge
[2:46:08.920 --> 2:46:13.400]  and a new yorker magazine and was confirmed that chaney wanted to paint up
[2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:16.920]  patrol boats blue and have navy seals attack our own ships and that was
[2:46:16.920 --> 2:46:20.200]  confirmed uh bush of all people said no we're not doing
[2:46:20.200 --> 2:46:23.560]  that uh but it just shows the mental uh you know level
[2:46:23.560 --> 2:46:27.560]  you came on air and said well if i was chaney and bush they'll probably paint
[2:46:27.560 --> 2:46:31.320]  up some ships like iranians this is on record on the show and attack our
[2:46:31.320 --> 2:46:35.000]  ships and later i said did you have inside intel you just said no
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:38.120]  that's how these people work and and now i want to shift gears and ask
[2:46:38.120 --> 2:46:42.360]  the difference between chaney and bush and obama it's now come out
[2:46:42.360 --> 2:46:46.520]  and i have it here in my stack uh washington post cnn
[2:46:46.520 --> 2:46:51.320]  business insider uh chaney had gotten his way we would have gone to war with
[2:46:51.320 --> 2:46:54.600]  russia and it's basically admitted in ron
[2:46:54.600 --> 2:46:58.120]  asmus's new book you know who was inside these meetings
[2:46:58.120 --> 2:47:02.040]  uh that uh yeah nato was part of it they launched the attack
[2:47:02.040 --> 2:47:06.440]  uh you know backed you know through georgia against south oseti on 888
[2:47:06.440 --> 2:47:10.200]  and that chaney wanted to go ahead and have nuclear war i mean that that really
[2:47:10.200 --> 2:47:12.280]  shows these are completely unstable people
[2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:15.000]  uh like like you know kurtis lemay or somebody
[2:47:15.000 --> 2:47:19.080]  and and so that mindset has that carried over into obama
[2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:22.680]  because when i see him out there at least at some levels supporting israel
[2:47:22.680 --> 2:47:26.040]  and netanyahu saying they may hit iran can
[2:47:26.040 --> 2:47:30.280]  can you speak to you know the mindset in the pentagon is any of this chaney
[2:47:30.280 --> 2:47:33.880]  stuff left there versus what's going on in the in the
[2:47:33.880 --> 2:47:37.720]  white house now and then how that posture the posture you
[2:47:37.720 --> 2:47:41.240]  believe from your research is there how that's going to affect
[2:47:41.240 --> 2:47:47.080]  what goes on uh in iran and now north korea
[2:47:47.080 --> 2:47:51.000]  well iran i think is uh the most pressing issue
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:53.960]  it's the one that the president has most difficulty
[2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:58.600]  with because uh the pressure from what uh what is called the
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:02.120]  likud lobby how the people call it the israel lobby
[2:48:02.120 --> 2:48:06.520]  is immense uh and that's been demonstrated recently by a whole
[2:48:06.520 --> 2:48:11.160]  string of events denis blair a former four star admiral who
[2:48:11.160 --> 2:48:14.920]  headed up the national intelligence set up in our country
[2:48:14.920 --> 2:48:20.760]  was canned last week why well there were a bunch of misadventures with not
[2:48:20.760 --> 2:48:25.240]  catching potential terrorists but the basic reason in my view that he was
[2:48:25.240 --> 2:48:29.800]  canned was that he had the temerity 15 months ago
[2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:34.360]  to appoint a person to be the chief analyst in our government the chief
[2:48:34.360 --> 2:48:38.280]  intelligence analyst a person named chas freeman
[2:48:38.280 --> 2:48:42.760]  who made the very bad mistake of the saying publicly that he thought
[2:48:42.760 --> 2:48:46.600]  palestinians also had rights as human beings
[2:48:46.600 --> 2:48:50.040]  in addition to israelis now what happened was
[2:48:50.040 --> 2:48:54.040]  he was appointed by denis blair this is not a cabinet appointment this is
[2:48:54.040 --> 2:48:57.560]  this is within his own little purview head of the national intelligence
[2:48:57.560 --> 2:49:01.480]  council chas freeman he was appointed in the morning and he had
[2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:05.880]  lunch with david broder of the post and it was you know david said aren't you
[2:49:05.880 --> 2:49:09.320]  expecting a lot of opposition and freeman said no it's it's going to
[2:49:09.320 --> 2:49:14.040]  sail through then blair got up saying about the appointment and
[2:49:14.040 --> 2:49:19.080]  saying he was a terrific person by five o'clock in the afternoon
[2:49:19.080 --> 2:49:23.240]  senator chuck schumer senator Lieberman from connecticut
[2:49:23.240 --> 2:49:26.520]  had gotten to ramen manual in the white house and said
[2:49:26.520 --> 2:49:30.280]  we can't have this guy he's too unbiased he's too
[2:49:30.280 --> 2:49:34.360]  he doesn't react with knee jerk solidity
[2:49:34.360 --> 2:49:39.880]  to the interests of israel and so blair had to go back to freeman and say
[2:49:39.880 --> 2:49:43.720]  you know i'm going to have to ask you to ask me
[2:49:43.720 --> 2:49:48.680]  to withhold your nominee to what went to reverse your appointment it wasn't like
[2:49:48.680 --> 2:49:53.560]  a nomination he had been appointed so he served as national intelligence director
[2:49:53.560 --> 2:49:58.360]  for eight hours okay now that is unprecedented i've seen a lot of stuff
[2:49:58.360 --> 2:50:02.360]  in my 50 years in washington but never before have i seen the israel lobby or
[2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:07.000]  any other lobby derail an appointment that had already been made in in the
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:12.120]  bowels of the intelligence community now to the extent you're saying israel's
[2:50:12.120 --> 2:50:14.440]  got pulled that our government doesn't even have
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:17.960]  well that seems to be the case i had hoped it would be different with obama
[2:50:17.960 --> 2:50:21.240]  but it's not now the other thing that's really important
[2:50:21.240 --> 2:50:25.400]  is this we approached an agreement to iran
[2:50:25.400 --> 2:50:29.800]  which would have resulted in about 70 percent of their low enriched
[2:50:29.800 --> 2:50:32.760]  uranium being shipped out of the country
[2:50:32.760 --> 2:50:37.960]  for reprocessing for the medical reactor okay that was october of last year
[2:50:37.960 --> 2:50:42.600]  now that was uh that didn't work out partly because
[2:50:42.600 --> 2:50:46.520]  partly because of the insurgents in iran
[2:50:46.520 --> 2:50:51.880]  um funded by the u.s israel and pocky star ray i'm sorry we got a break stay
[2:50:51.880 --> 2:50:54.520]  there i'll see if i twist your arm to stay five in the next hour so we have
[2:50:54.520 --> 2:50:57.880]  at least 10 minutes of air time to finish up on iran and briefly

[2:54:31.720 --> 2:54:35.480]  at mash awakening and if ron paul says that you can bank it
[2:54:35.480 --> 2:54:40.920]  that's up on gcnlive.com the article by paul joseph
[2:54:40.920 --> 2:54:45.640]  watson that's gcnlive gcnlive.com okay ray we've only about four minutes
[2:54:45.640 --> 2:54:47.800]  here five minutes the next segment again very thankful
[2:54:47.800 --> 2:54:51.960]  for your time you were finishing up with the situation when i ran
[2:54:51.960 --> 2:54:56.600]  netanyahu says they may strike uh talking to folks in intelligence out of
[2:54:56.600 --> 2:54:59.240]  intelligence with your ear to the ground
[2:54:59.240 --> 2:55:02.920]  is it on the front burner again and and what's the time frame
[2:55:02.920 --> 2:55:07.240]  and then see what will happen if we do attack
[2:55:07.240 --> 2:55:10.600]  well uh to address your last point first
[2:55:10.600 --> 2:55:14.200]  alex it would be could a catastrophe if we
[2:55:14.200 --> 2:55:20.280]  and or the israelis uh takdir on uh among other things they have the option
[2:55:20.280 --> 2:55:24.680]  of closing the street of formus to which about a third of the
[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:31.160]  uh publicly that traded oil uh goes through and you know for the world
[2:55:31.160 --> 2:55:35.720]  and talk about a recession well we throw the with the world into a tailspin
[2:55:35.720 --> 2:55:40.200]  given the dependence on oil um the situation right now is
[2:55:40.200 --> 2:55:45.640]  is highly interesting uh the bottom line is that the israel lobby has shown its
[2:55:45.640 --> 2:55:50.280]  power once again and now get this this this is the
[2:55:50.280 --> 2:55:53.560]  important conclusion at least from my analysis
[2:55:53.560 --> 2:55:58.280]  neither israel nor the united states is terribly worried
[2:55:58.280 --> 2:56:04.840]  about a nuclear weapon in iran if they were they would have welcomed
[2:56:04.840 --> 2:56:09.240]  this new tripartite deal between brazil turkey in iran
[2:56:09.240 --> 2:56:15.560]  which provides for half fully half of the low-risk uranium to go out of
[2:56:15.560 --> 2:56:19.880]  country into turkey now that's the uranium that would have to be
[2:56:19.880 --> 2:56:25.800]  refined to a higher degree to make a bomb so if if half of iran's uranium is
[2:56:25.800 --> 2:56:30.280]  going out of country for a whole year wouldn't you think that the israelis
[2:56:30.280 --> 2:56:34.920]  in the u.s would be happy about that yeah iran is is buckling i mean they're
[2:56:34.920 --> 2:56:38.520]  every time going back as you know five years they try to be friendly
[2:56:38.520 --> 2:56:42.360]  they get slapped down yeah well what happened as soon as this
[2:56:42.360 --> 2:56:46.200]  the deal was announced hillary clinton got up is it no no no we're not going to
[2:56:46.200 --> 2:56:50.040]  go that route that's naive what we're going to do is
[2:56:50.040 --> 2:56:52.760]  sanctions in the u.n and we're persuaded the russians and the
[2:56:52.760 --> 2:56:55.800]  chinese and we're going to just get these guys well
[2:56:55.800 --> 2:56:59.320]  you know that's really interesting because you know what
[2:56:59.320 --> 2:57:03.160]  the president of the united states encouraged
[2:57:03.160 --> 2:57:06.280]  the head of brazil and the head of turkey
[2:57:06.280 --> 2:57:10.920]  to work out this deal and we have that in a letter from president
[2:57:10.920 --> 2:57:13.560]  obama you won't find us in new york times by the way
[2:57:13.560 --> 2:57:17.320]  but if you look in the salpaolo press there in brazil
[2:57:17.320 --> 2:57:21.560]  you'll see the text of a letter from the president of the united states which
[2:57:21.560 --> 2:57:25.160]  says to the president of brazil from our point of view
[2:57:25.160 --> 2:57:29.880]  a decision by iran to send half of its low and rich uranium abroad would
[2:57:29.880 --> 2:57:33.400]  generate confidence and reduce regional tensions
[2:57:33.400 --> 2:57:36.840]  by cutting iran's stockpile so we're about to break but to interrupt
[2:57:36.840 --> 2:57:40.360]  correct me if i'm wrong basically it's showing there's a fight going on inside
[2:57:40.360 --> 2:57:42.680]  the obama administration and that they were trying to do
[2:57:42.680 --> 2:57:46.040]  something reasonable with somebody else's comment and said uh-huh
[2:57:46.040 --> 2:57:49.720]  yeah that's not gonna wash in november they said because the lobby will object
[2:57:49.720 --> 2:57:52.280]  to that
[2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:56.440]  that is incredible it really is and you'll find it in the new york times
[2:57:56.440 --> 2:57:59.080]  where but that's the text of the president's letter
[2:57:59.080 --> 2:58:04.360]  to brazil and uh... hillary clinton and the other nail cons and those
[2:58:04.360 --> 2:58:07.640]  that particularly susceptible to influence from the
[2:58:07.640 --> 2:58:12.520]  from the liquid lobby that put the kibosh on what should be a very very
[2:58:12.520 --> 2:58:15.720]  favorable very encouraging development namely
[2:58:15.720 --> 2:58:19.720]  for iran to ship half of its uranium out of country so so we're coming back
[2:58:19.720 --> 2:58:22.920]  with only five more minutes but but but they were just fast when we come back
[2:58:22.920 --> 2:58:27.800]  watch the game plan then in plan is regime change that's what they care about
[2:58:27.800 --> 2:58:31.240]  and anything that will make alchemy vintage had looked more reasonable
[2:58:31.240 --> 2:58:35.800]  or make iran look better they're against because they don't care about the
[2:58:35.800 --> 2:58:41.160]  uranium they care about regime change we'll talk about north korea coming up
[2:58:41.160 --> 2:58:45.720]  america's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a
[2:58:45.720 --> 2:58:50.840]  decade we are the gcn radio network
[2:58:50.840 --> 2:58:54.920]  when you're out on the road the last place you want to be
[2:58:54.920 --> 2:58:59.240]  is on the road but if the unfortunate happens
[2:58:59.240 --> 2:59:02.680]  you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets
[2:59:02.680 --> 2:59:06.680]  there's a place down in tennessee
[2:59:06.680 --> 2:59:11.320]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans
[2:59:11.320 --> 2:59:19.640]  they so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit

[2:59:24.520 --> 2:59:31.720]  blue diamond gussets got it others don't we turn jeans inside out
[2:59:31.720 --> 2:59:36.280]  diamond gusset jeans made in the usa with unparalleled quality
[2:59:36.280 --> 2:59:40.600]  our defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with kevlar protection

[3:00:12.440 --> 3:00:16.200]  all right we got the runner-up for miss uh usa on who
[3:00:16.200 --> 3:00:19.960]  lost because she is for states rights so
[3:00:19.960 --> 3:00:21.720]  she's going to be joining us in the next segment
[3:00:21.720 --> 3:00:25.320]  revin govern you've got the floor former cia top analyst
[3:00:25.320 --> 3:00:29.640]  uh to the presidents uh you wanted to finish up with uh the neocons admitting
[3:00:29.640 --> 3:00:32.520]  it's not about nukes and iran and then briefly
[3:00:32.520 --> 3:00:38.200]  the situation on the korean peninsula sure i think the most recent very
[3:00:38.200 --> 3:00:43.720]  clear indication of what bothers the neocons and the israel lobby
[3:00:43.720 --> 3:00:49.720]  is in tom freedman's uh he's a very much pro israel fellow
[3:00:49.720 --> 3:00:52.760]  his op-ed in the new york times yesterday
[3:00:52.760 --> 3:00:57.000]  he's got a couple of lies in it he says experts say that they still have enough
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:01:00.120]  iranium to to do a nuclear weapon that's wrong
[3:01:00.120 --> 3:01:04.920]  the intelligence community does not say that they also suggest that the
[3:01:04.920 --> 3:01:08.280]  iranian facilities are not that are not under
[3:01:08.280 --> 3:01:12.840]  un inspections that's wrong what makes it clear as he's not interested in the
[3:01:12.840 --> 3:01:15.560]  iranium he's interested in regime change and he
[3:01:15.560 --> 3:01:20.280]  finishes up with that that appeal so what we need to realize here
[3:01:20.280 --> 3:01:23.080]  is that this whole thing is easily explainable
[3:01:23.080 --> 3:01:26.760]  why the us and why the israelis would not welcome
[3:01:26.760 --> 3:01:30.040]  the the shipping out of half of iran's uranium
[3:01:30.040 --> 3:01:34.280]  for reprocessing elsewhere is because they don't care about that they care
[3:01:34.280 --> 3:01:36.680]  about regime change and what they're trying to do
[3:01:36.680 --> 3:01:40.920]  is uh get that to happen largely through a lot of covert action
[3:01:40.920 --> 3:01:45.720]  support of disparate groups within iran now openly acknowledged by a new york
[3:01:45.720 --> 3:01:49.880]  times uh article yesterday and that's what put
[3:01:49.880 --> 3:01:53.000]  the kabosh on the last deal in october
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:01:57.320]  joandala one of the militant dissident actually
[3:01:57.320 --> 3:02:01.800]  insurgent groups in iran supported by israel us
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:08.040]  uk and pakistan killed five senior iranian revolutionary
[3:02:08.040 --> 3:02:11.000]  guards generals and that's what put the kabosh
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:15.320]  on the last deal now it's interesting to see the new york times is advertising
[3:02:15.320 --> 3:02:18.600]  the same kind of activity now we'll see how hard
[3:02:18.600 --> 3:02:22.120]  israeli united states tries to put the kabosh on this deal
[3:02:22.120 --> 3:02:27.000]  which really should go through and that would obviate the necessity so they're
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:30.440]  moving us towards war do everything they can to sabotage
[3:02:30.440 --> 3:02:34.600]  a peace process uh and this will go down in history either way
[3:02:34.600 --> 3:02:39.000]  all right two minutes left sir uh north korean well you know alex it's really
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:42.120]  interesting because we don't have the whole story on what happened
[3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:46.440]  it looks pretty sure that a uh north korean torpedo
[3:02:46.440 --> 3:02:51.720]  did hit this in south korean ship but the the details have not been released
[3:02:51.720 --> 3:02:55.080]  they've been given to the russians and the chinese but not to us
[3:02:55.080 --> 3:02:58.360]  the problem is that there's a there's an armistice there's not a
[3:02:58.360 --> 3:03:02.200]  a peace agreement and there are disputed territories there are
[3:03:02.200 --> 3:03:06.680]  a north korean and south korean fishermen fighting over crabs every year
[3:03:06.680 --> 3:03:10.200]  and this is the reason and there are south korean ships
[3:03:10.200 --> 3:03:18.040]  and north korean ships both killed or sunk 1999 a north korean ship went down
[3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:23.960]  with 30 killed and 70 wounded so unless they get that that shoreline and that
[3:03:23.960 --> 3:03:28.040]  international boundary delineated this is going to keep happening
[3:03:28.040 --> 3:03:31.480]  so this should not be blown out of proportion and still less
[3:03:31.480 --> 3:03:35.880]  should hillary clinton use the same language used by dean acheson back in
[3:03:35.880 --> 3:03:39.640]  1950 that this is quote unprovoked integration
[3:03:39.640 --> 3:03:43.880]  end quote uh it may be a provocation it may be retaliation
[3:03:43.880 --> 3:03:49.080]  we just don't know yet but we know kim jong il looks like a scare crow looks
[3:03:49.080 --> 3:03:53.000]  like death warmed over uh so anytime we could see a collapse
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:56.760]  of the regime and who knows how that'll go so it's another powder keg
[3:03:56.760 --> 3:04:00.360]  that's exactly right no one really knows what's going on it within that country
[3:04:00.360 --> 3:04:04.200]  and so it's really hard to guess as to what the motivation might have been
[3:04:04.200 --> 3:04:09.480]  other than the normal sort of jousting the normal
[3:04:09.480 --> 3:04:14.600]  trying to head off the ships from the other country
[3:04:14.600 --> 3:04:17.640]  well that's good news to hear that you're not as concerned about north korea
[3:04:17.640 --> 3:04:21.640]  as the media has been hyping it to be so we'll continue to watch that i appreciate
[3:04:21.640 --> 3:04:24.200]  you coming on to cover what's happening all over the
[3:04:24.200 --> 3:04:28.280]  planet and the geopolitical breakdown and i look forward to talking to

[3:08:02.360 --> 3:08:05.720]  hello miss aloha how are you i'm doing so great thank you
[3:08:05.720 --> 3:08:10.120]  all righty arizona's new immigration statute authorizes law enforcement
[3:08:10.120 --> 3:08:13.720]  authorities to check the citizenship of anyone they
[3:08:13.720 --> 3:08:17.640]  believe may be in the country illegally now listen to the question before you
[3:08:17.640 --> 3:08:21.800]  move critics say this may
[3:08:21.800 --> 3:08:27.080]  amount to racial profiling do you think that this should be mandated by the
[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:30.920]  state or by the federal government
[3:08:30.920 --> 3:08:34.920]  i'm a huge believer in states rights i think that's what's so wonderful
[3:08:34.920 --> 3:08:43.400]  about america
[3:08:43.400 --> 3:08:47.960]  so i think it's perfectly fine for arizona to create that law
[3:08:47.960 --> 3:08:52.440]  and i am against illegal immigration but i'm also against racial profiling
[3:08:52.440 --> 3:08:58.520]  so i see those sides in the picture thank you all
[3:08:58.520 --> 3:09:03.000]  now i don't normally watch uh unipadgets because i don't watch a lot of
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:05.960]  television but when i am watching the news i see highlights of it i'm
[3:09:05.960 --> 3:09:09.880]  obviously red-blooded so my eyes are trained like a wolf looking at a you
[3:09:09.880 --> 3:09:13.960]  know uh but the issue here is that i happened to be up
[3:09:13.960 --> 3:09:17.800]  here while this was live turned on the television and so all the ladies come
[3:09:17.800 --> 3:09:21.160]  out and i remember uh looking at morgan
[3:09:21.160 --> 3:09:24.600]  elizabeth woollard uh miss oklahoma thinking well i
[3:09:24.600 --> 3:09:28.200]  she certainly stands out uh because it's more than just looks she's obviously
[3:09:28.200 --> 3:09:31.640]  beautiful i could tell she was intelligent she had that spark about her
[3:09:31.640 --> 3:09:35.640]  uh and uh it's great to see her so informed about the bill of rights and
[3:09:35.640 --> 3:09:40.840]  constitution and ninth and tenth amendment versus miss teen south carolina
[3:09:40.840 --> 3:09:43.880]  who literally didn't even know what planet she was on will play that clip
[3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:47.000]  coming up later but i didn't know i was watching
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:49.720]  controversy when i happened to you know watch 30 minutes of it
[3:09:49.720 --> 3:09:54.680]  uh that evening uh because uh i didn't continue to watch to see the final
[3:09:54.680 --> 3:09:58.680]  judging and then i discovered and the news reported she may have
[3:09:58.680 --> 3:10:03.800]  lost because she didn't answer that politically correct you heard the
[3:10:03.800 --> 3:10:07.880]  the judge uh you know asked about the arizona law and he said well wait don't
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:11.720]  boo yet and then she got this big standing ovation that i would say was
[3:10:11.720 --> 3:10:15.400]  five six seven times louder than the booze
[3:10:15.400 --> 3:10:18.520]  well and we'll play it again coming up just to have it on record
[3:10:18.520 --> 3:10:22.280]  uh that that that the people you know responded to state's rights i mean the
[3:10:22.280 --> 3:10:25.880]  government's too big it's out of control mexico's collapsing but
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:28.920]  you know she went on to say like ron paul congressman said here yesterday
[3:10:28.920 --> 3:10:33.240]  he is against racial profiling if it's misused but that wasn't good enough uh
[3:10:33.240 --> 3:10:36.600]  but to really pick her brain because there's nothing like beauty and brains
[3:10:36.600 --> 3:10:41.640]  all together uh is morgan elizabeth woollard the runner up second place uh
[3:10:41.640 --> 3:10:46.280]  in miss uh usa great to have you here with us thanks for coming on
[3:10:46.280 --> 3:10:50.920]  thank you very much thank you for having me again miss oklahoma on the line with
[3:10:50.920 --> 3:10:55.000]  us uh well i mean let's go back to uh the pageant
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:10:58.440]  a week and a half ago what happened there anything that happened behind the
[3:10:58.440 --> 3:11:02.760]  scenes uh break it down for us the behind the scenes
[3:11:02.760 --> 3:11:05.960]  well what do you mean we're there two and a half weeks before the actual
[3:11:05.960 --> 3:11:10.520]  telecast and so there are a lot of behind the scenes
[3:11:10.520 --> 3:11:13.480]  exactly that's what i meant i mean i mean because because all we see is the
[3:11:13.480 --> 3:11:15.880]  limited i limited cuts i mean did somebody say
[3:11:15.880 --> 3:11:19.400]  something to you after you answered that way or did you ever get word like
[3:11:19.400 --> 3:11:22.520]  ooh that was a screw up you should have called for world government
[3:11:22.520 --> 3:11:26.120]  or you should have called for us turning our guns in
[3:11:26.120 --> 3:11:29.720]  well i mean they don't make you at all afterward about
[3:11:29.720 --> 3:11:33.080]  you know how you answered your question but i think afterward
[3:11:33.080 --> 3:11:36.840]  of course the media definitely brought that to my attention and
[3:11:36.840 --> 3:11:41.480]  we're wondering simply from the scoring you know i was actually had the entire
[3:11:41.480 --> 3:11:45.480]  competition until then and of course having judges in the
[3:11:45.480 --> 3:11:49.640]  entertainment industry which is predominantly liberal they do question
[3:11:49.640 --> 3:11:54.360]  whether it hurt my chances or not you know that's a key statistics
[3:11:54.360 --> 3:11:57.960]  that fox news did cover in miss oklahoma named first runner up
[3:11:57.960 --> 3:12:01.720]  in miss usa pageant after answering immigration question
[3:12:01.720 --> 3:12:05.880]  you were way ahead until that point i mean whether smoke there's fire
[3:12:05.880 --> 3:12:08.920]  and i don't i mean i talked to you earlier you don't want to be
[3:12:08.920 --> 3:12:13.160]  somebody who's a sword loser but if you were ahead and then suddenly
[3:12:13.160 --> 3:12:17.720]  you got behind that i mean that is suspicious
[3:12:17.720 --> 3:12:21.800]  yeah i mean i guess so i think
[3:12:21.800 --> 3:12:25.640]  with me i just kind of have to have a positive perspective and
[3:12:25.640 --> 3:12:28.440]  you know when you work so hard for something the last thing you want to
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:32.440]  think of is the way you answered your question is what did you in
[3:12:32.440 --> 3:12:37.480]  and so i just choose not to flaglight my mind with anything condemning like that
[3:12:37.480 --> 3:12:41.320]  and you know not be a sore loser or victimize myself but
[3:12:41.320 --> 3:12:45.800]  rise above it and be happy for rima and just move on to the next chapter of my
[3:12:45.800 --> 3:12:48.760]  life well she is obviously intelligent and
[3:12:48.760 --> 3:12:53.400]  lovely as well but i think you are the clear winner and again the entire time
[3:12:53.400 --> 3:12:57.640]  well thank you you were ahead until you didn't answer the thing politically
[3:12:57.640 --> 3:13:00.680]  correct and you know the issue is tell us about the rules
[3:13:00.680 --> 3:13:04.760]  because i'm not an expert on this effect i'm ignorant on this subject
[3:13:04.760 --> 3:13:08.360]  i mean is it political do the judges tell you if i don't agree with your
[3:13:08.360 --> 3:13:11.080]  politics i'm going to vote against you because
[3:13:11.080 --> 3:13:14.760]  because you know we need to know if it is rigged i mean i understand
[3:13:14.760 --> 3:13:19.160]  you don't want to go there but this is quite an issue
[3:13:19.160 --> 3:13:23.640]  well i don't think the usb system is quite as transparent
[3:13:23.640 --> 3:13:28.120]  with their judging criteria and how the whole process goes
[3:13:28.120 --> 3:13:33.560]  um but i believe once you get to the top five or i think even through 15 10 to
[3:13:33.560 --> 3:13:37.800]  five they race the scores entirely and it starts all over again
[3:13:37.800 --> 3:13:42.520]  and so once you do make top five and answer questions
[3:13:42.520 --> 3:13:46.440]  you have a final look and i believe they rank you after that
[3:13:46.440 --> 3:13:52.120]  and so you know it could be they like to personality better i don't know i just
[3:13:52.120 --> 3:13:56.440]  you know all i can say is i did my best and i'm proud of my answer
[3:13:56.440 --> 3:13:59.800]  i have no regrets people ask me all the time if i would have worded it
[3:13:59.800 --> 3:14:03.080]  differently no i i do believe it states right then i
[3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:06.920]  think i took a stance but i did it diplomatically
[3:14:06.920 --> 3:14:11.240]  well you certainly did very diplomatic if you could be an ambassador
[3:14:11.240 --> 3:14:14.040]  for the us in the future i mean you answered it perfectly
[3:14:14.040 --> 3:14:18.120]  well that was my hope of becoming this usa
[3:14:18.120 --> 3:14:22.840]  to be an ambassador for my country but that just was not on the cards for me
[3:14:22.840 --> 3:14:27.640]  and i was blessed to even compete for such a prestigious title so first
[3:14:27.640 --> 3:14:31.640]  honor office quite the honor well you know i'm really proud of you and
[3:14:31.640 --> 3:14:34.920]  so are my listeners we got a lot of fan mail for you here at the office and
[3:14:34.920 --> 3:14:38.840]  people just calling in and emails you know just when we played the clip saying
[3:14:38.840 --> 3:14:42.840]  wow this is wonderful especially in oklahoma your home state
[3:14:42.840 --> 3:14:46.520]  where you are miss oklahoma because people appreciated you not
[3:14:46.520 --> 3:14:50.040]  going with the politically correct answer they because that's what really is
[3:14:50.040 --> 3:14:52.520]  valuable is telling the truth standing up
[3:14:52.520 --> 3:14:56.840]  for what you believe in and so you know that made you the winner overall when
[3:14:56.840 --> 3:15:00.760]  it came to defending this republic thank you very much
[3:15:00.760 --> 3:15:04.440]  give us your take on states rights and the arizona issue because you only had a
[3:15:04.440 --> 3:15:09.400]  few seconds to talk about it then now you've got more time
[3:15:09.400 --> 3:15:13.080]  right and that's what makes it even more difficult i think you know this is
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:19.240]  such a hot-bun issue that is on our tv's you know 20 hours of the day and i have
[3:15:19.240 --> 3:15:24.920]  20 seconds to sum it up that is not the easiest thing in the world
[3:15:24.920 --> 3:15:29.080]  um and i think i'd also like to clarify which i don't think a lot of people
[3:15:29.080 --> 3:15:32.840]  realize is they didn't ask me whether i was for
[3:15:32.840 --> 3:15:35.880]  against the law they asked me whether i felt
[3:15:35.880 --> 3:15:40.040]  it should be you know state or federal and i
[3:15:40.040 --> 3:15:44.200]  firmly believe in states rights um i think a state should be allowed to
[3:15:44.200 --> 3:15:47.000]  mandate rules and regulations as they see fit
[3:15:47.000 --> 3:15:50.360]  i love that we can put power in the hands of the people
[3:15:50.360 --> 3:15:57.400]  and i fully support that well on top of it uh
[3:15:57.400 --> 3:16:00.680]  napolitano the head of homeland security last week in congressional testimony
[3:16:00.680 --> 3:16:05.000]  being questioned by john mccain said i haven't read the arizona bill
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:09.160]  yeah that's correct oh you saw that i did yes
[3:16:09.160 --> 3:16:13.160]  uh i mean how can then she condemn it if she hasn't read it because i have read
[3:16:13.160 --> 3:16:17.240]  it i read it here on air it is identical to the federal law
[3:16:17.240 --> 3:16:20.840]  he hasn't read it as well i believe
[3:16:21.240 --> 3:16:25.720]  uh who does you say hasn't read it uh attorney general
[3:16:25.720 --> 3:16:28.120]  eric holder yes yes you're right he admits it so
[3:16:28.120 --> 3:16:31.640]  so so what's your take on them commenting on something
[3:16:31.640 --> 3:16:36.680]  they haven't read well i certainly think that's an issue
[3:16:36.680 --> 3:16:41.560]  i think you know before you believe in something
[3:16:41.560 --> 3:16:44.920]  firmly against something you should know what all
[3:16:44.920 --> 3:16:48.040]  that bill entails and what is within it so
[3:16:48.040 --> 3:16:51.720]  i think that is certainly an issue
[3:16:53.160 --> 3:16:56.440]  wow well listen while you're here on air we've got you till about 45 after we're
[3:16:56.440 --> 3:17:00.200]  appreciative of the time uh just anything else you want to set the record
[3:17:00.200 --> 3:17:04.120]  straight on we're talking to miss oklahoma she got second place runner up
[3:17:04.120 --> 3:17:06.920]  in miss usa she was ahead the entire time
[3:17:06.920 --> 3:17:11.480]  until uh she didn't sell america out on national television
[3:17:11.480 --> 3:17:15.720]  and uh and but again she's being a good sport
[3:17:15.720 --> 3:17:19.800]  and you know i guess she made the field goal but they're taking it back and so i
[3:17:19.800 --> 3:17:24.280]  guess i'm gonna say it's rigged but she's a big sport and we appreciate that
[3:17:24.280 --> 3:17:27.720]  but anything else you want to set the record straight about
[3:17:27.720 --> 3:17:31.160]  well you know if i think there was one thing that i could set the record
[3:17:31.160 --> 3:17:35.000]  straight with it would just be that i'm i'm one who
[3:17:35.000 --> 3:17:38.680]  does not want to victimize myself i think a lot of promos and the media are
[3:17:38.680 --> 3:17:43.240]  saying miss oklahoma lost her crown because of what she said and you know
[3:17:43.240 --> 3:17:47.000]  truthfully yes it was a bold question and it was
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:51.560]  doomed for a polarizing answer but i really don't want to victimize myself
[3:17:51.560 --> 3:17:56.920]  um miss usa wasn't a do or die situation for me it would have been an
[3:17:56.920 --> 3:18:02.920]  incredible honor to represent the usa system and donald trump in my country
[3:18:02.920 --> 3:18:07.240]  but you know that didn't work out for me and being scholastically and
[3:18:07.240 --> 3:18:11.400]  and professionally active i know that i have great things
[3:18:11.400 --> 3:18:15.240]  coming in life regardless and so i just want people to know i'm not better
[3:18:15.240 --> 3:18:18.840]  i am not a victim and that i'm going to do good things with my life
[3:18:18.840 --> 3:18:23.400]  regardless of the crown well i i honor that and i know my listeners
[3:18:23.400 --> 3:18:26.200]  do uh so you're being a great sport about it
[3:18:26.200 --> 3:18:31.400]  but i want to be clear i think people who do think that that question was wrong
[3:18:31.400 --> 3:18:36.120]  and and and i do think that uh you were penalized
[3:18:36.120 --> 3:18:40.680]  i think in future uh the the fans of miss usa
[3:18:40.680 --> 3:18:45.560]  should put their input in about the transparency of the judging rules
[3:18:45.560 --> 3:18:49.320]  so that uh the young ladies know what they're going into
[3:18:49.320 --> 3:18:53.400]  right now you're very young i mean you're in a
[3:18:53.400 --> 3:18:57.400]  what a sophomore or junior in college a junior in college i'm 21 years old
[3:18:57.400 --> 3:19:01.400]  and so you can continue to be part of pageants this isn't your last rodeo
[3:19:01.400 --> 3:19:07.400]  well yes and no the usa system it goes on to miss
[3:19:07.400 --> 3:19:12.840]  universe and because of that it's the most prestigious pageant in the world
[3:19:12.840 --> 3:19:17.160]  and so i've kind of already competed as far up as i can go
[3:19:17.160 --> 3:19:21.320]  and so if i wanted to compete there are other systems
[3:19:21.320 --> 3:19:25.160]  there's this world there's this international and of course miss america
[3:19:25.160 --> 3:19:30.040]  um who has the talent portion and so you know i'm open-minded to that but i
[3:19:30.040 --> 3:19:34.040]  think at this point in my life i'm ready to move on
[3:19:34.040 --> 3:19:39.240]  and pursue my career and finish my education and that kind of thing i don't
[3:19:39.240 --> 3:19:43.080]  completely shut it out but at this moment in time i don't think i'll be
[3:19:43.080 --> 3:19:45.640]  competing anymore well that's great i mean you're very well
[3:19:45.640 --> 3:19:49.720]  balanced you've got a larger universe out there than just uh just these uh
[3:19:49.720 --> 3:19:51.880]  beauty pageants but it is great to have miss
[3:19:51.880 --> 3:19:57.080]  oklahoma with us we'll talk about her world view uh and uh what what she's
[3:19:57.080 --> 3:20:01.400]  planning in her career next when we get back stay with us
[3:20:01.400 --> 3:20:06.360]  the question is where should the american people draw their line in the sand
[3:20:06.360 --> 3:20:11.400]  what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a
[3:20:11.400 --> 3:20:15.720]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule
[3:20:15.720 --> 3:20:18.760]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our
[3:20:18.760 --> 3:20:21.320]  land they think they're on our water children
[3:20:21.320 --> 3:20:25.560]  our education our money we have to define who we are
[3:20:25.560 --> 3:20:29.800]  and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did
[3:20:29.800 --> 3:20:34.760]  during the patriot uprising we have the facts we have the constitution we have
[3:20:34.760 --> 3:20:38.760]  the bill of rights we have common law knowledge is power ladies and gentlemen
[3:20:38.760 --> 3:20:42.680]  and i'm so excited to be able to offer you don't tread on me rise the republic
[3:20:42.680 --> 3:20:46.440]  tyranny is upon us but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the american

[3:23:26.120 --> 3:23:29.640]  will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[3:23:29.640 --> 3:23:32.920]  yourself will you go to the gathering center and be immunized

[3:23:56.040 --> 3:24:02.120]  again that number 1-800-409-5633
[3:24:02.200 --> 3:24:07.160]  okay recent polls have shown a fifth of americans can't locate the us on a
[3:24:07.160 --> 3:24:11.720]  world map why do you think this is
[3:24:11.720 --> 3:24:17.480]  i personally believe that us americans are unable to do so
[3:24:17.480 --> 3:24:22.120]  because uh some people out there in our nation
[3:24:22.120 --> 3:24:28.280]  don't have maps and i believe that our education like such as south africa
[3:24:28.280 --> 3:24:34.680]  and diorak everywhere like such as and i believe that they should
[3:24:34.680 --> 3:24:39.720]  our education over here in the u.s should help the u.s or should help south
[3:24:39.720 --> 3:24:42.600]  africa it should help diorak in the asian
[3:24:42.600 --> 3:24:48.120]  countries so we will be able to build up our future
[3:24:48.120 --> 3:24:52.200]  thank you miss south carolina it is refreshing
[3:24:52.200 --> 3:24:55.720]  to have miss oklahoma on with us and run her up for
[3:24:55.720 --> 3:25:03.080]  miss usa uh to have someone who is very intelligent
[3:25:03.080 --> 3:25:05.960]  because my experiences beautiful women are just as smart as you know on average
[3:25:05.960 --> 3:25:09.480]  is other intelligent women uh but uh i don't want you to say mean
[3:25:09.480 --> 3:25:14.280]  things here but what was your take on miss teen south carolina and that big
[3:25:14.280 --> 3:25:20.200]  controversy a few years ago well you know i'm not one
[3:25:20.200 --> 3:25:27.000]  to to judge anyone so all i can say is god bless her and it's
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:31.400]  you know it's not easy being up there in front of millions of people
[3:25:31.400 --> 3:25:36.360]  and lights in your face you know and possibly becoming a potential youtube
[3:25:36.360 --> 3:25:40.120]  moment is a lot going through your brain so you got to give her some credit for
[3:25:40.120 --> 3:25:44.840]  at least putting yourself out there and you know doing your best right
[3:25:44.840 --> 3:25:48.440]  hey at least she got in the arena i'm just saying comparing her to you
[3:25:48.440 --> 3:25:52.760]  it is it is night and day uh now uh talking
[3:25:52.760 --> 3:25:57.640]  during the break i brought up uh carrie presion of i'm pronouncing that right i
[3:25:57.640 --> 3:26:00.760]  vaguely remember last year the big controversy
[3:26:00.760 --> 3:26:03.640]  where she you know said my parents brought me up to be
[3:26:03.640 --> 3:26:07.720]  you know pro uh you know family and and marriages a institution that
[3:26:07.720 --> 3:26:11.480]  that that deals with that and you said well i i get asked about a lot of that
[3:26:11.480 --> 3:26:15.880]  and you told me privately your views on it and but it's such a hot issue
[3:26:15.880 --> 3:26:19.000]  uh so so putting it as nicely as you can
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:23.640]  uh i mean you were explaining the parallel of
[3:26:23.640 --> 3:26:27.240]  even if you basically were dissed for answering the question the way you were
[3:26:27.240 --> 3:26:33.080]  you don't want to be seen as as as basically running with it or milking it
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:35.880]  right well you know i think a lot of people
[3:26:35.880 --> 3:26:39.400]  have been comparing me to carrie presion or saying
[3:26:39.400 --> 3:26:42.920]  i'm the next carrie presion because it is kind of ironic
[3:26:42.920 --> 3:26:46.120]  you know she gets the gay marriage question i get the legal immigration
[3:26:46.120 --> 3:26:49.800]  question we both gave fairly conservative answers
[3:26:49.800 --> 3:26:53.400]  are pretty blonde then end up first interrupt right um
[3:26:53.400 --> 3:26:57.160]  so there are definitely some comparisons there
[3:26:57.160 --> 3:27:01.480]  but i just didn't want to victimize myself i felt
[3:27:01.480 --> 3:27:05.320]  she kind of melts her time in the media
[3:27:05.320 --> 3:27:09.960]  just for being controversial and um i just didn't want people to view me as
[3:27:09.960 --> 3:27:13.880]  the same or victimize me or anything along those
[3:27:13.880 --> 3:27:17.400]  lines if that makes sense but i mean every year now it's
[3:27:17.400 --> 3:27:20.920]  about politics people losing who are the runner-ups
[3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:24.440]  because they have conservative or or constitutional
[3:27:24.440 --> 3:27:28.520]  or traditional values i think donald trump needs to get the politics out of
[3:27:28.520 --> 3:27:31.880]  this because the message to people is you know if you don't have the right
[3:27:31.880 --> 3:27:35.400]  political view it's not how talented or how beautiful or how
[3:27:35.400 --> 3:27:39.160]  dynamic you are uh you know this is political correctness
[3:27:39.160 --> 3:27:42.440]  and i think and i frankly i think it was political correctness
[3:27:42.440 --> 3:27:46.120]  i mean i think the lebanese woman is bombshell beautiful
[3:27:46.120 --> 3:27:50.760]  uh but i i don't think she was in the top five i mean i happened to again just
[3:27:50.760 --> 3:27:53.560]  catch about 20 minutes of it was pure torture of course while i was drinking
[3:27:53.560 --> 3:27:58.440]  coffee after my sunday show uh but i mean i'm sorry i don't
[3:27:58.440 --> 3:28:02.040]  think she's second place i saw you out there on that runway
[3:28:02.040 --> 3:28:05.560]  and and let me tell you it was like my eyes were on springs i hope my wife's
[3:28:05.560 --> 3:28:08.840]  not listening i'm sorry but no i mean seriously
[3:28:08.840 --> 3:28:12.440]  i mean i thought you were the most beautiful you popped out there
[3:28:12.440 --> 3:28:15.800]  that's the reason you were in the leadership role and if you'd have said
[3:28:15.800 --> 3:28:19.000]  i'm against arizona i love open borders i love world
[3:28:19.000 --> 3:28:21.960]  government i love i love crime that they would have been
[3:28:21.960 --> 3:28:27.400]  bong bong bong you jackpot you're the winner i'm sorry they stole it from you
[3:28:27.400 --> 3:28:30.920]  you know again i i would hope not that's not the case
[3:28:30.920 --> 3:28:34.200]  but you're actually correct actually rima
[3:28:34.200 --> 3:28:38.120]  while she is stunningly beautiful if you
[3:28:38.120 --> 3:28:42.840]  average something evening gown i think she was actually in seventh place
[3:28:42.840 --> 3:28:48.440]  and so um you know winning i'm i'm so proud of her and i think it's awesome
[3:28:48.440 --> 3:28:52.040]  that she's arab-american i think that's you know a great
[3:28:52.040 --> 3:28:56.440]  neat thing for our country but it is a little disappointing for me you know
[3:28:56.440 --> 3:29:02.520]  when you want something so badly and so close but so far
[3:29:02.520 --> 3:29:06.360]  but again i'm i'm doing okay i'm not better and i'm just
[3:29:06.360 --> 3:29:11.000]  excited for what's next in my life i know but there you are though see see you
[3:29:11.000 --> 3:29:14.840]  just backed up with statistics she was in seventh place
[3:29:14.840 --> 3:29:18.440]  she was way back there she wasn't you know it's like a nascar race you got
[3:29:18.440 --> 3:29:21.800]  two or three of the top drivers you know they're up there on the last lap
[3:29:21.800 --> 3:29:25.480]  and then all of a sudden you answered that question wrong and your engine blew
[3:29:25.480 --> 3:29:30.360]  up and then you know seventh place goes year on year on year on year on year
[3:29:30.360 --> 3:29:35.240]  i mean come on come on rima honestly she's got
[3:29:35.240 --> 3:29:39.880]  the funniest goofiest personality and i really think
[3:29:39.880 --> 3:29:43.480]  they she just won him over in their interview because she's just
[3:29:43.480 --> 3:29:49.480]  such a relatable uh miss oklahoma stay there one more

[3:33:23.080 --> 3:33:26.760]  news i want to hit on the financial front with world markets collapsing all
[3:33:26.760 --> 3:33:31.160]  over the place in the last segment today
[3:33:31.160 --> 3:33:34.600]  again thank you for joining us radio listeners
[3:33:34.600 --> 3:33:38.040]  i want to go to calls but i also want to talk about you in the future
[3:33:38.040 --> 3:33:41.000]  i mean you're intelligent you're smart you're constitutionalist you're for
[3:33:41.000 --> 3:33:44.120]  states rights you've been punished for standing up
[3:33:44.120 --> 3:33:47.160]  for your rights even if you won't stand up for yourself but i think that's
[3:33:47.160 --> 3:33:51.000]  you know in a way admirable that that you're not being you know a spoil sport
[3:33:51.000 --> 3:33:54.440]  but it's not a spoil sport if you were cheated but
[3:33:54.440 --> 3:33:59.160]  again discretion is the you know greater valor i guess they say
[3:33:59.160 --> 3:34:01.880]  but but where are you planning to go from here i was telling you you're in the
[3:34:01.880 --> 3:34:04.600]  break you ought to write a book about this
[3:34:04.600 --> 3:34:10.520]  and interweave in there your political views
[3:34:10.520 --> 3:34:15.640]  well that's a loaded question oh my goodness so much to say there
[3:34:15.640 --> 3:34:20.120]  i have been incredibly blessed with being given
[3:34:20.120 --> 3:34:25.880]  numerous options from here you know the missus a pageant just exposure itself
[3:34:25.880 --> 3:34:28.920]  is a blessing especially if you want to be in the media
[3:34:28.920 --> 3:34:33.160]  and so i'm very thankful for all the opportunities that have come my way
[3:34:33.160 --> 3:34:37.480]  because of this pageant i'm already getting offers you know within the
[3:34:37.480 --> 3:34:40.600]  broadcasting world modeling world acting world
[3:34:40.600 --> 3:34:45.160]  hosting anything of that nature so i think right now i just need to decide
[3:34:45.160 --> 3:34:49.880]  what's best for me in my future and take a risk and go a direction
[3:34:49.880 --> 3:34:53.000]  and they also need to finish my education as well and
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:34:57.000]  i'm getting close but not quite there yet so hopefully i can find a way
[3:34:57.000 --> 3:35:02.280]  to pursue finishing my education and starting my career at the same time
[3:35:02.280 --> 3:35:06.520]  well let me just just just inject this there's a lot of anchors on
[3:35:06.520 --> 3:35:10.680]  on television like peter jennings that you know that don't have degrees
[3:35:10.680 --> 3:35:14.520]  and i would strike while the iron's hot you can always go back to college
[3:35:14.520 --> 3:35:17.880]  but right now you're smart you're talented you're well spoken
[3:35:17.880 --> 3:35:21.480]  you're beautiful i would get into the media and i would take every opportunity
[3:35:21.480 --> 3:35:25.480]  you've got right now because i'm not bashing college and education that's
[3:35:25.480 --> 3:35:30.120]  fine and dandy it's just that bill gates rush limbaugh
[3:35:30.120 --> 3:35:33.880]  if you look at the statistics over 90 percent of the top ceo's
[3:35:33.880 --> 3:35:37.320]  media people you name it didn't go to college or quit college
[3:35:37.320 --> 3:35:41.160]  because they were already go-getters by 20 years old halfway into college they
[3:35:41.160 --> 3:35:44.680]  already had opportunities same thing with me i was 21 i had about
[3:35:44.680 --> 3:35:48.280]  another year and a half of college left i'd already gone and gotten a radio show
[3:35:48.280 --> 3:35:52.040]  locally and i was sayonara but but again i'm just saying
[3:35:52.040 --> 3:35:55.160]  strike while the iron's hot strike while you're in the spotlight because you
[3:35:55.160 --> 3:35:57.960]  could argue due to that controversial question and your
[3:35:57.960 --> 3:36:01.640]  controversial answer for some you almost got more attention than the lady
[3:36:01.640 --> 3:36:04.760]  that won miss usa so at the end of the day it
[3:36:04.760 --> 3:36:09.320]  doesn't matter if they stole the crown from you because you still win
[3:36:09.320 --> 3:36:12.280]  yes you know it really is a win-win situation
[3:36:12.280 --> 3:36:15.560]  i'm incredibly blessed and i'm again so grateful
[3:36:15.560 --> 3:36:21.000]  for all these opportunities so you're getting a lot of offers right now
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:25.160]  acting tv you name it just dive in with both feet name it now you know i think
[3:36:25.160 --> 3:36:29.160]  the hardest part is just figuring out which route to take
[3:36:29.160 --> 3:36:32.360]  because of course you want to do it's best for you want to do it's best for
[3:36:32.360 --> 3:36:36.280]  your future and um take the bull by the horn and
[3:36:36.280 --> 3:36:39.560]  you know make the right decision and i think that's
[3:36:39.560 --> 3:36:43.400]  the the place i'm in at the moment well let me give you some advice don't sign
[3:36:43.400 --> 3:36:47.080]  anything try a lot of different things uh because
[3:36:47.080 --> 3:36:50.200]  hollywood tv it's full of a lot of flim flammers a lot of
[3:36:50.200 --> 3:36:53.480]  talkers uh but just you know i would go with the big
[3:36:53.480 --> 3:36:57.720]  companies or established companies uh who can give you bona fide
[3:36:57.720 --> 3:37:00.760]  money at the you know at the bottom because they'll sit there and string you
[3:37:00.760 --> 3:37:05.000]  along to see where your career is going you know uh so i mean again i would
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:08.040]  just hit the ground running and try a lot of things out and that's why i'm
[3:37:08.040 --> 3:37:10.920]  warning you because most people won't do this
[3:37:10.920 --> 3:37:14.600]  college especially when you're already being launched and propelled
[3:37:14.600 --> 3:37:19.080]  uh you you can always go back into the college you can't always
[3:37:19.080 --> 3:37:23.960]  get this advantage you've got right now you can't always get the present back
[3:37:23.960 --> 3:37:26.840]  right and that's you know that's kind of another
[3:37:26.840 --> 3:37:31.240]  position i'm in in regards to being in between a rock and a hard play
[3:37:31.240 --> 3:37:36.120]  because both of my parents are within the medical fields and they're
[3:37:36.120 --> 3:37:40.440]  all about education education education and so
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:45.880]  um for me i just need to find a place or relocate to a place that i can pursue
[3:37:45.880 --> 3:37:50.200]  both at once that's the way to do it that you need to take
[3:37:50.200 --> 3:37:54.040]  advantage of things while they're hot and you know when they're in front of you
[3:37:54.040 --> 3:37:58.600]  you gotta grab them otherwise life might you know pass you by so when things
[3:37:58.600 --> 3:38:02.600]  are hot in front of you you gotta grab them
[3:38:02.600 --> 3:38:08.680]  that's a good quote from miss oklahoma
[3:38:08.680 --> 3:38:13.080]  absolutely yes so you you could go to chicago new york la
[3:38:13.080 --> 3:38:20.200]  places like that and uh sorry go ahead oh i was just agreeing
[3:38:20.200 --> 3:38:24.440]  well listen i'm in a big city absolutely well before we go to eric
[3:38:24.440 --> 3:38:29.080]  chris mike and others with miss oklahoma the patriot uh who we just
[3:38:29.080 --> 3:38:33.000]  loved to death give us you uh some of your other views on the second
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:35.720]  amendment or on have you have you heard all these world
[3:38:35.720 --> 3:38:38.920]  leaders calling for global government and that we need to have the private
[3:38:38.920 --> 3:38:43.240]  central banks running things what's your view on ron paul
[3:38:43.240 --> 3:38:49.160]  i think ron paul is a wonderful man and i agree with him on a lot of stances
[3:38:49.160 --> 3:38:53.320]  i've i've always been a bit of a constitutionalist myself and i believe
[3:38:53.320 --> 3:38:57.560]  in limited governments and liberty and rule of law and all those
[3:38:57.560 --> 3:39:01.560]  wonderful things in america self-government self-governance
[3:39:01.560 --> 3:39:04.200]  that kind of thing
[3:39:04.920 --> 3:39:09.960]  well that's wonderful uh again while we've got you here uh
[3:39:09.960 --> 3:39:13.080]  where would you like to see our republic going i mean or you can
[3:39:13.080 --> 3:39:18.120]  have you heard them talk on the news about forming this world government
[3:39:18.120 --> 3:39:23.400]  um world government do you by that you mean giving government more power
[3:39:23.400 --> 3:39:26.360]  well you've got bandkai moon the secretary general of the u n herman
[3:39:26.360 --> 3:39:29.720]  vom room be the head of the u u the outgoing prime minister of england
[3:39:29.720 --> 3:39:35.640]  gordon brown al gore uh the heads of the g20 are calling for a global government
[3:39:35.640 --> 3:39:41.720]  to set worldwide taxes uh and i was just asking if you were concerned about that
[3:39:41.720 --> 3:39:45.080]  i'm definitely concerned about that i've always been
[3:39:45.080 --> 3:39:50.280]  for limited government and um being able to be your own keeper and having
[3:39:50.280 --> 3:39:54.120]  self-government and you know making something of yourself and not relying
[3:39:54.120 --> 3:39:57.560]  too much on the government for that and so i'm
[3:39:57.560 --> 3:40:03.800]  definitely against the government in the world
[3:40:03.800 --> 3:40:08.120]  well i tell you i wish you were miss usa somebody to really represent our
[3:40:08.120 --> 3:40:12.360]  country but you are representing our country and and people just appreciate
[3:40:12.360 --> 3:40:17.000]  that that that you didn't sell out your values i mean you had to know though
[3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:21.080]  when he asked the question that i mean did it run through your head
[3:40:21.080 --> 3:40:24.680]  well if i give the politically correct answer he's gonna like that or are you
[3:40:24.680 --> 3:40:28.280]  just such a patriot that there wasn't even a question
[3:40:28.280 --> 3:40:34.040]  well truthfully in that moment and time you don't have time to think you just
[3:40:34.040 --> 3:40:39.320]  go with what you know exactly you know i know i am i know what i believe and why
[3:40:39.320 --> 3:40:44.120]  i believe it and with that said it was easy for me to answer i didn't have to
[3:40:44.120 --> 3:40:48.760]  think twice about it because that's who i am and that's how i was raised and
[3:40:48.760 --> 3:40:54.680]  you know i i said firm enough well that's why people admire you not just for
[3:40:54.680 --> 3:40:57.480]  your beauty or uh you know the electric

[3:42:22.120 --> 3:42:26.680]  first your answer was outstanding outstanding
[3:42:26.680 --> 3:42:30.680]  in me a beauty pageant is beyond just beauty and body it's
[3:42:30.680 --> 3:42:34.680]  mind and soul and you score tens on all of them so
[3:42:34.680 --> 3:42:38.200]  thank you thank you for being a good patriot absolutely
[3:42:38.200 --> 3:42:45.240]  proud to be an american 21 in college what is um your opinion or what are you
[3:42:45.240 --> 3:42:49.000]  seeing as far as the like the increased police state
[3:42:49.000 --> 3:42:53.320]  and the the loss the erosion of our rights yeah what do you think of the
[3:42:53.320 --> 3:42:57.160]  patriot act being used against us citizens uh they've got legislation
[3:42:57.160 --> 3:43:01.480]  introduced where citizens can be secretly arrested uh we're seeing in
[3:43:01.480 --> 3:43:05.000]  universities i don't know about oklahoma but more and more censorship of
[3:43:05.000 --> 3:43:08.680]  libertarian or conservative political viewpoints
[3:43:08.680 --> 3:43:12.280]  thanks for the call chris let's get her take on that question
[3:43:12.280 --> 3:43:15.560]  i'm sorry what exactly are you asking me well i mean what do you think about the
[3:43:15.560 --> 3:43:19.720]  loss of liberty uh the the erosion of the bill of rights warrantless
[3:43:19.720 --> 3:43:23.640]  wiretapping uh are are you concerned about that
[3:43:23.640 --> 3:43:27.800]  well i think that kind of goes along with what we were speaking about earlier
[3:43:27.800 --> 3:43:31.960]  it's given government too much power and you know i i don't want our freedoms
[3:43:31.960 --> 3:43:35.640]  to be taken away i don't want our liberties to be taken away i think
[3:43:35.640 --> 3:43:40.440]  those things is exactly what makes america america
[3:43:40.440 --> 3:43:45.000]  and just being able to govern yourself and you know not having
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:43:48.840]  like i said the government controlling too many aspects of our lives
[3:43:48.840 --> 3:43:53.080]  i definitely think there's a point where they need to step back and
[3:43:53.080 --> 3:43:58.360]  give us our freedoms again absolutely we've got to step up and take them back
[3:43:58.360 --> 3:44:01.880]  absolutely did you hear the debate with lewdabs and others about the north
[3:44:01.880 --> 3:44:07.240]  american union spp nap to superhighways all these toll roads going in that
[3:44:07.240 --> 3:44:11.240]  that uh the money then goes to foreign corporations in spain and europe
[3:44:11.240 --> 3:44:15.880]  uh i mean a have you heard of that be what's your take on it
[3:44:15.880 --> 3:44:20.360]  i've not heard too much about that to be honest especially if it's recent
[3:44:20.360 --> 3:44:26.120]  being in vegas or miss usa for three weeks we kind of live in a fishbowl
[3:44:26.120 --> 3:44:30.600]  i haven't been able to be watching the news as often as i normally do
[3:44:30.600 --> 3:44:36.280]  but as far as foreign nations go i do think we need to become less dependent

[3:46:10.360 --> 3:46:16.440]  you know a just great american family well it's been great having you here
[3:46:16.440 --> 3:46:20.520]  and we appreciate your courage did we ever find that clip guys
[3:46:20.520 --> 3:46:24.760]  of uh kary pijon or prejohn however you pronounce it
[3:46:24.760 --> 3:46:27.320]  and we didn't find that because i heard it all over the news last year whenever
[3:46:27.320 --> 3:46:30.120]  she uh i mean you probably used to youtube kary
[3:46:30.120 --> 3:46:36.040]  prejohn's uh gay marriage comment i mean you're quite a person because
[3:46:36.040 --> 3:46:38.440]  you're out there in the spotlight as a model and
[3:46:38.440 --> 3:46:41.640]  if somebody who wanted to win who was going to win
[3:46:41.640 --> 3:46:45.560]  until that question came up the evidence is clear but then now
[3:46:45.560 --> 3:46:49.320]  clearly i think you weren't seated but you want to be a good sport and
[3:46:49.320 --> 3:46:53.080]  you're saying no uh you know i don't want to get attention by going out and
[3:46:53.080 --> 3:46:58.200]  screaming bloody murder correct you're exactly right
[3:46:58.440 --> 3:47:03.000]  uh i mean are you critical of the lady who uh did uh
[3:47:03.000 --> 3:47:11.960]  a milk at somewhat well for me i think um i wouldn't say critical
[3:47:11.960 --> 3:47:16.040]  definitely not of her answer this is america and in
[3:47:16.040 --> 3:47:19.720]  the first amendment we have freedom of speech and so
[3:47:19.720 --> 3:47:26.680]  she had every right to speak her belief um and so i back her up fully
[3:47:26.680 --> 3:47:32.920]  with that in mind but i do feel that she kind of took it and ran with it and
[3:47:32.920 --> 3:47:36.840]  kind of overexposed herself to the media i guess
[3:47:36.840 --> 3:47:41.560]  and may have put a bad taste in people's mouth yeah maybe so
[3:47:41.560 --> 3:47:45.720]  so so your your problem isn't what she said not at all it's the fact that she
[3:47:45.720 --> 3:47:49.400]  did say i was cheated i was cheated exactly i think
[3:47:49.400 --> 3:47:53.880]  yeah i think you should um be humble and in your loss and
[3:47:53.880 --> 3:47:57.640]  you know just realize that everything happens for a reason and
[3:47:57.640 --> 3:48:01.480]  as as much as it's being sometimes just to know that
[3:48:01.480 --> 3:48:05.320]  greater things are in store and and just look forward to
[3:48:05.320 --> 3:48:10.600]  what god has next for your life absolutely it's all in god's hands
[3:48:10.600 --> 3:48:15.480]  well um we appreciate you joining us we've got about a minute left anything
[3:48:15.480 --> 3:48:18.760]  else that you forgot to add
[3:48:18.760 --> 3:48:22.600]  i don't think so just you know how grateful i am for the
[3:48:22.600 --> 3:48:26.280]  overwhelming support i've received everyone has been
[3:48:26.280 --> 3:48:29.240]  absolutely incredible not just from the state of Oklahoma
[3:48:29.240 --> 3:48:33.000]  but my entire country and even people all over the world
[3:48:33.000 --> 3:48:37.800]  just showered with love and support and people backing me up from all over the
[3:48:37.800 --> 3:48:41.800]  place and so i'm so grateful and i really am just
[3:48:41.800 --> 3:48:46.440]  honored and humbled well that is my final question
[3:48:46.440 --> 3:48:49.320]  going back you know you hear on the video the audio
[3:48:49.320 --> 3:48:54.520]  and it sounded like five six seven times the cheering that there was the booing
[3:48:54.520 --> 3:48:58.360]  you could barely hear the booing uh but you were there i mean
[3:48:58.360 --> 3:49:03.960]  was the cheering for you uh a lot more overwhelming than the booing
[3:49:03.960 --> 3:49:07.480]  oh without a doubt i think it tripled the booing
[3:49:07.480 --> 3:49:11.640]  as soon as i said i'm firm believer in state drives and i love that about
[3:49:11.640 --> 3:49:15.720]  my country everyone just overflowed with
[3:49:15.720 --> 3:49:20.360]  you know clapping and cheering and i think the majority of the people there
[3:49:20.360 --> 3:49:24.600]  were into grants with me on that statement
[3:49:24.600 --> 3:49:28.360]  well all i can say is incredible and it has been great
[3:49:28.360 --> 3:49:31.960]  having uh you on the broadcast and i know that

[3:54:21.720 --> 3:54:24.840]  of 2008 because the sums are so much bigger
[3:54:24.840 --> 3:54:28.840]  and governments that are in dire straits this is all part of the plan as we
[3:54:28.840 --> 3:54:34.200]  laid out over a decade ago we have the imf world bank takeover plan

[3:54:50.440 --> 3:54:55.960]  is dark cloud over europe another key article ron paul
[3:54:55.960 --> 3:55:00.680]  inside source told me fed is panicking at mass awakenings gcmlive.com paul
[3:55:00.680 --> 3:55:04.120]  watson article ron paul on with us yesterday and watch both those videos
[3:55:04.120 --> 3:55:08.280]  at gcmlive.com our interview with ron paul so the good news is we're identifying
[3:55:08.280 --> 3:55:10.760]  the enemy they know we're aware of what they're doing
[3:55:10.760 --> 3:55:14.200]  but they're just imploding the entire economy what a dr paul craig roberts
[3:55:14.200 --> 3:55:18.040]  former head of the treasury wall street journal editor father ergonomics
[3:55:18.040 --> 3:55:22.600]  he said evil has been turned loose the government is completely evil
[3:55:22.600 --> 3:55:26.680]  you got a few good people in the government but the system is run by evil
[3:55:26.680 --> 3:55:30.040]  and look you'll wake up to that or it's over now
[3:55:30.040 --> 3:55:33.640]  i'm not going to tackle in back and the whole media frenzy about what he sells
[3:55:33.640 --> 3:55:36.360]  gold for because some of that stuff's collectible
[3:55:36.360 --> 3:55:39.880]  and it's good to have a mix but non-collectible
[3:55:39.880 --> 3:55:44.280]  semi numismatic the news reported 360 dollars for a frank
[3:55:44.280 --> 3:55:48.600]  and that was three months ago when when uh you know
[3:55:48.600 --> 3:55:53.080]  gold was down about like a hundred bucks ted has frank said a hundred and
[3:55:53.080 --> 3:55:56.920]  i mean 250 something it's like a hundred bucks less than what you know big
[3:55:56.920 --> 3:55:59.640]  gold companies are selling it because he bought it when it was lower
[3:55:59.640 --> 3:56:02.600]  he's selling it to you when it's higher at the low price
[3:56:02.600 --> 3:56:06.920]  so when i tell you that i get the daily sheets on this we do a gold offer
[3:56:06.920 --> 3:56:11.240]  he's making three or four maybe five dollars different days on these franks
[3:56:11.240 --> 3:56:15.080]  on these sovereigns maybe six dollars that are quarter ounce
[3:56:15.080 --> 3:56:19.000]  and that's at the old amount when he bought it when it was low
[3:56:19.000 --> 3:56:22.840]  he's still selling it to you you cannot get better deals from my research
[3:56:22.840 --> 3:56:26.440]  maybe they're there uh you know maybe a leprechaun's got a golden pot or
[3:56:26.440 --> 3:56:29.640]  something but ted i wanted to bring you up briefly with a few news headlines on
[3:56:29.640 --> 3:56:32.360]  the economy and then not just the franks
[3:56:32.360 --> 3:56:36.840]  that everybody else is selling for over 300 you got them for 250 something but
[3:56:36.840 --> 3:56:39.720]  not for long because they are selling out gold way up today
