[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:57.240]  here we are my friends already the 8th of day of September 2013 you probably saw
[00:57.240 --> 01:05.240]  out there on Friday and Saturday and now today on Sunday a few of the video clips of John McCain
[01:05.240 --> 01:11.800]  being confronted at town hall meetings across the state of Arizona that the member of the Keating
[01:11.800 --> 01:19.240]  6 no one is able to ever get rid of the anti-gun world government promoting open border promoting
[01:19.240 --> 01:28.640]  banker bailout promoting piece of absolute traitorous garbage the Chuckie Schumer dressed up as a
[01:28.640 --> 01:38.440]  Republican but we posted some videos up on info wars.com of what really went on at those things
[01:38.440 --> 01:46.440]  shot from behind the podium where you see everyone screaming at McCain everyone hating him and saying
[01:46.440 --> 01:53.920]  he should be arrested for treason and running al-Qaeda and this is happening all over the
[01:53.920 --> 02:03.160]  country people are waking up to what's happening and this is really a manifestation of the accelerated
[02:03.160 --> 02:10.560]  understanding people are having about the level of tyranny that we're under and are about to be
[02:10.560 --> 02:21.120]  under because things are rapidly degrading right now obviously and you've got those groups of
[02:21.120 --> 02:26.280]  people that are waking up very very fast versus people that are actually getting more into their
[02:26.280 --> 02:34.920]  nihilistic denial and their criticism of those of us that are trying to reverse the degenerative
[02:34.920 --> 02:44.600]  tide that we've been swept under by but the the the cattle the willingly ignorant willingly duped
[02:44.600 --> 02:53.320]  arrested development population out there they don't count they're just pray that the globalists
[02:53.320 --> 02:58.560]  have always been feeding on and the globalists want to make us all like that but it doesn't
[02:58.560 --> 03:03.160]  matter if five percent of us are awake and don't go along the the new world order can't get away
[03:03.160 --> 03:11.320]  with this and we're talking maybe thirty forty percent of the country that is really waking up
[03:11.320 --> 03:17.480]  fully right now I'd say ten percent's hardcore awake thirty forty percent somewhat awake and
[03:17.480 --> 03:25.120]  once you reach that tipping point if they just wake up one more person it's bye bye new world
[03:25.120 --> 03:30.840]  order we can all then basically just passively bring this thing down and no amount of false
[03:30.840 --> 03:38.640]  flags no amount of staging new wars no amount of anything is ever gonna put it back together
[03:38.640 --> 03:48.120]  again because here's the big issue the good news the term false flag self-inflicted wound inside
[03:48.120 --> 04:02.520]  job frame job set up key bono who benefits in latin that is now popular nomenclature across
[04:02.520 --> 04:09.940]  the world and we have now seen everyone from rush limbaugh to Ted Cruz to Ron Paul to Rand
[04:09.940 --> 04:16.120]  Paul to Pat Buchanan and so many others now saying it's an inside job the Russian saying
[04:16.120 --> 04:24.240]  it's an inside job pundits on Fox News having debates about inside job the Russian report
[04:24.240 --> 04:30.960]  that the latest chemical attacks an inside job if you take the power of the false flag
[04:30.960 --> 04:39.000]  the Pagalian dialectic of problem reaction solution away from the technocrats it's pretty
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.360]  much game over because sometimes they don't even stage stuff it happens but they use that
[04:44.360 --> 04:49.240]  to take our liberties like there's a mass shooting then they want to take all everybody's guns
[04:49.240 --> 04:56.360]  when guns on average make a safer the collective guilt is gone the collective fear is gone
[04:56.360 --> 05:02.760]  people now understand calben soap company can save you thousands of dollars and give

[06:36.120 --> 06:37.120]  gcn radio network
[06:37.120 --> 06:44.560]  this historical eighth day of september twenty thirteen on this sunday transmission i am
[06:44.560 --> 06:48.960]  your host alex jones we're going to be live here for the next two hours as we are live
[06:48.960 --> 06:53.360]  every sunday four to six p.m. central and we're here weekdays of course twelve noon

[07:00.840 --> 07:10.720]  com and prison planet dot com and the nightly news channel is info wars news dot com okay
[07:10.720 --> 07:15.720]  obviously there's big military developments in and around syria with more russian and
[07:15.720 --> 07:25.600]  chinese battleships missile cruisers helicopter carriers and troop carriers arriving b1 bombers
[07:25.600 --> 07:30.560]  and b2 bombers have been deployed to diego garcia to launch nuclear strikes in the middle
[07:30.560 --> 07:38.200]  east and into russia chinese fighter wings are being moved to their western border as
[07:38.200 --> 07:44.320]  well with pakistan and india the world is lining up for war now i don't think we're
[07:44.320 --> 07:48.960]  going to have world war three and i hope we don't obviously but many analysts you've
[07:48.960 --> 07:53.360]  heard them and see them on the news are saying that an attack on syria will probably lead
[07:53.360 --> 08:01.600]  to a larger regional war and that there is a chance in fact a good chance a good chance
[08:01.600 --> 08:06.720]  that that could lead to a war between what's left of the united states were captured by
[08:06.720 --> 08:13.840]  megabanks u.n. institutions that are above the law and and pay no taxes who use us as
[08:13.840 --> 08:19.320]  their as their juggernaut worldwide there is a very good chance that the occupied united
[08:19.320 --> 08:27.720]  states and nato in europe will be thrown into a larger war with the ruskies back on 888
[08:27.720 --> 08:36.520]  in 2008 the day the olympics began georgian forces backed by nato mercenaries slammed
[08:36.520 --> 08:48.480]  into south ossetia and abkhazia mass murdering russian peacekeeping troops in their beds
[08:48.480 --> 08:56.720]  destroying their quarters firing missiles into them sending in special forces and then
[08:56.720 --> 09:02.000]  when the russians tried to organize for a counterattack they were overrun and slaughtered
[09:02.000 --> 09:10.640]  by armored divisions of nato with georgia and of course the mass hoax was launched that
[09:10.640 --> 09:15.880]  day i got up and heard did you hear my wife was shaking me awake about 6 30 the morning
[09:15.880 --> 09:20.480]  did you hear russia attack georgia and i went excuse me russia attack so i walked in turned
[09:20.480 --> 09:27.360]  on seeing in they announced russia has attacked georgia russian tanks are pouring in uh and
[09:27.360 --> 09:33.800]  attacking the poor president who's on tv literally biting on his tie begging for nato help and
[09:33.800 --> 09:39.960]  nato began to send in she won 30s loaded with more commandos and i got to the office at
[09:39.960 --> 09:47.920]  about 9am read all the news went on air and said well cnn's announcing russia attacked
[09:47.920 --> 09:52.800]  now by the end of the show it was in the european german dutch french and british news that
[09:52.800 --> 09:58.200]  actually actually russia attacked after they were overrun and they were attacked so they
[09:58.200 --> 10:03.280]  play a lawyer game they said well russia attacked and then the bottom of the article
[10:03.280 --> 10:08.680]  after they were attacked and they rolled in medium range mobile in the big trucks with
[10:08.680 --> 10:17.000]  the with the missiles on the back of the nukes and i was blown away i mean that was that
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.840]  was six years ago or five and a half years ago and i couldn't believe then that they
[10:22.840 --> 10:31.000]  would announce on fox cnn msnbc cnbc npr every station in the country go back and look it
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.680]  up it's now admitted that the attack was launched on russia and so i went on air and said i was
[10:36.680 --> 10:40.800]  duped i can't believe they'd lie that bad i mean even i couldn't believe lies of that
[10:40.800 --> 10:49.300]  magnitude and then i was called in the national news a traitor maybe a ruski agent folks
[10:49.300 --> 10:54.640]  because i was saying well wait the fire and press admits that that the georgian forces
[10:54.640 --> 11:02.040]  backed by nato is trying to start a war with russia and then backed off on russia their
[11:02.040 --> 11:06.400]  chairman of their joint chiefs went on tv and i played this on the radio you can look
[11:06.400 --> 11:11.480]  it up from the time and said we're going to now start launching nuclear weapons uh if
[11:11.480 --> 11:16.320]  the troop carrying aircraft landing in the capital of georgia do not turn around and
[11:16.320 --> 11:26.360]  take off you're given a one hour and we are going to start nuclear war
[11:26.360 --> 11:30.320]  you're given one hour and we're going to launch nuclear missiles on europe you attacked us
[11:30.320 --> 11:34.360]  international law you have one hour to pull out we're going to nuke you and dick shaney
[11:34.360 --> 11:43.640]  and george bush and nato and sarcosi at the time and and and the rest of them backed off
[11:43.640 --> 11:49.680]  but that's when i really started to get wow these people really are crazy they really
[11:49.680 --> 11:55.480]  are crazy and the russians are crazy too but they're not the ones starting it they came
[11:55.480 --> 12:03.240]  in and crushed it now the good news is if you fast forward five years later to 2013 pat
[12:03.240 --> 12:16.400]  Buchanan ron paul rand paul ted cruise rush limbaugh glenn beck alex jones articles on
[12:16.400 --> 12:20.680]  drudge report matt drudge want to speak for drussey himself with the articles on the
[12:20.680 --> 12:25.840]  side of carried it but but all those others have openly come out and said we believe
[12:25.840 --> 12:33.200]  this is probably a frame up inside job false flag to be blamed on a sod who wouldn't lodge
[12:33.200 --> 12:37.440]  it we not use chemicals and he's going to get invaded and he's winning the war and the
[12:37.440 --> 12:42.200]  intelligence they have is his secretary of defense screaming at their troops their general
[12:42.200 --> 12:46.400]  saying you better not launch this and the russians just released a hundred page dossier was
[12:46.400 --> 12:51.280]  actually out in march that the al-qaeda rebels got caught nerve-gassing before they didn't
[12:51.280 --> 12:58.160]  get caught they upload videos of it bragging they did it again three weeks ago see that's
[12:58.160 --> 13:04.880]  what's so frustrating is the west did launch an attack on russia that's now admitted just
[13:04.880 --> 13:09.280]  the public can't find georgia on a map it ain't the place north of florida with peaches
[13:09.280 --> 13:13.560]  folks i'm talking about new listeners i'm not being mean here but i mean you know it's
[13:13.560 --> 13:17.960]  admitted that the west tried to start some weird war to see if russia would back off
[13:17.960 --> 13:24.720]  five years ago it's admitted the rebels we found a video on an official al-qaeda website
[13:24.720 --> 13:30.560]  that's been up for years on their channel where they uploaded the jihadis saying of course
[13:30.560 --> 13:36.600]  we launched the nerve gas attack of someone been lauding told us to kill women and children
[13:36.600 --> 13:42.660]  that to their credit got picked up by fox news show the good news here is i was on herald
[13:42.660 --> 13:49.200]  a reverence radio show and then saturday on his tv show i had wrongfully posted a short
[13:49.200 --> 13:52.720]  video saying what looks like they edited me down actually i'm told i was on the full
[13:52.720 --> 13:56.160]  six minutes just the only clip on youtube's a minute and a half long we're trying to find
[13:56.160 --> 14:00.440]  a longer one but they let me come on and lay out the russian report and lay out that all
[14:00.440 --> 14:04.720]  these prominent people said it looks like an inside job and that and that over 60 percent
[14:04.720 --> 14:10.360]  of the rebels are al-qaeda the cfr admits and this is a horrible plan to destabilize
[14:10.360 --> 14:15.360]  syria and break it in multiple parts and that obama for two and a half years and jordan
[14:15.360 --> 14:20.400]  has been arming these rebels and injecting them and that it's it's it's not a civil war
[14:20.400 --> 14:28.360]  it's foreign mercenaries coming in and so the good news is i listen and monitor talk radio
[14:28.360 --> 14:34.280]  and i heard talk radio some of them a week ago regional and local host trying to push
[14:34.280 --> 14:39.600]  the war none of them are doing that now because every caller every caller every caller i've
[14:39.600 --> 14:44.600]  heard has called in and said it's an abomination our government's behind al-qaeda they're using
[14:44.600 --> 14:49.400]  al-qaeda to take our liberties our government created al-qaeda you know back in the seventies
[14:49.400 --> 14:54.800]  people now get it they understand the term false flag that no one knew ten fifteen years
[14:54.800 --> 15:01.320]  ago and they're now talking about setups and proxy wars and and it's really the public
[15:01.320 --> 15:05.560]  driving this to where anderson cooper was pushing war a week ago he's saying it's a
[15:05.560 --> 15:13.400]  bad idea now as a friday msnbc was pushing the war a week ago they're not pushing it
[15:13.400 --> 15:20.280]  now fox news isn't pushing it now this talk of it's well known as saw did it people are
[15:20.280 --> 15:28.480]  engaged in the novel idea of saying show us the proof so a putin came out and laughed
[15:28.480 --> 15:32.880]  at kerry and said what a liar everyone knows most of the forces there are al-qaeda you
[15:32.880 --> 15:38.640]  know kerry said there's no al-qaeda i mean that's a ball face line and so they're still
[15:38.640 --> 15:42.880]  doing their old lies but now they're doing it with people awake and that's how history
[15:42.880 --> 15:47.760]  works it's like a light switch it's a tipping point and i'm telling you folks we've crossed
[15:47.760 --> 15:53.840]  it so the big question is what are they gonna pull to divert us from this massive awakening

[21:08.520 --> 21:16.480]  times headline here that says israel backs limited strike against the sod and then goes
[21:16.480 --> 21:22.280]  on to say even though most american people are against it the congress is against it
[21:22.280 --> 21:29.480]  that the israeli government is for it well i would say so the french governments for
[21:29.480 --> 21:36.280]  it as well all of these different powers that want to slice up pieces of syria like the
[21:36.280 --> 21:43.440]  old colonials did want a piece of it and it's extremely immoral for israel to side with
[21:43.440 --> 21:48.680]  al qaeda one of their main enemies just because they're busy killing syrians and going after
[21:48.680 --> 21:55.280]  a sod who morally is a much better guy than al qaeda and i think that's finally what has
[21:55.280 --> 22:05.040]  woken up the american people but obama says now that well it doesn't matter if the house
[22:05.040 --> 22:09.120]  may not vote because it looks like he's going to lose by more than a hundred votes that's
[22:09.120 --> 22:14.160]  how unpopular this war is just a week ago it looked like he had the votes in the house
[22:14.160 --> 22:20.760]  now it looks like there's more than a hundred votes he would lose by more than a hundred
[22:20.760 --> 22:25.760]  votes so so so the house is saying banners saying the speaker of the house is saying
[22:25.760 --> 22:32.880]  we won't even have a vote then because this might embarrass you because after all why
[22:32.880 --> 22:36.560]  do you need a vote if he doesn't need to do it anyways i saw seeing in during the break
[22:36.560 --> 22:44.880]  as i have it on in the coffee room next door to the studio saying with some guest congressman
[22:44.880 --> 22:50.320]  was ongoing well listen he needs to lead he's the executive that's who launches war is word
[22:50.320 --> 22:55.800]  for word that's who handles international affairs not congress folks congress controls
[22:55.800 --> 23:00.080]  the power of the purse war all of it why not just have a dictator of the president handles
[23:00.080 --> 23:06.360]  it i mean that's our constitution that's it's unbelievable under the war powers act
[23:06.360 --> 23:12.200]  if i see bm's have been launched the congress has already given the president the power
[23:12.200 --> 23:19.000]  with the nuclear football to respond but he's already been given that duty and been voted
[23:19.000 --> 23:26.760]  that power by the congress the argument of well he can just strike anybody he wants without
[23:26.760 --> 23:32.320]  congress to say so or without anybody else to say so because he's the commander in chief
[23:32.320 --> 23:36.400]  he's only the commander in chief when war has been declared and authorized and then the
[23:36.400 --> 23:44.960]  mission the war bill is passed and handed to the president to execute that's how that
[23:44.960 --> 23:49.020]  works ladies and gentlemen not the other way around or why not just have a napoleon bone
[23:49.020 --> 23:55.520]  apart or a hitler for that matter you know hitler was elected but he used war and crises
[23:55.520 --> 24:03.480]  as a way to erode the basic checks and balances so here's the big issue we've got 91 percent
[24:03.480 --> 24:09.660]  in a reuters poll the most pro war polls i see are 15 percent for it world net daily
[24:09.660 --> 24:14.480]  did articles info wars dot com did articles off with a weekly standarded articles off
[24:14.480 --> 24:19.080]  of congressmen and women who put out press releases in the last week saying the calls
[24:19.080 --> 24:33.040]  they were getting 540 something to 2 520 something to 4102 to 199 to 1 it's over 99 to 1 phone
[24:33.040 --> 24:38.800]  calls republican and democrat he got all these republicans saying well i've never seen such
[24:38.800 --> 24:54.600]  an overwhelming response i've never seen such a absolute no message from the american people
[24:54.600 --> 24:58.480]  and so they're backing off but now the new spin is well you know what we didn't need
[24:58.480 --> 25:05.200]  the congress anyways yeah there it is calls to congress 499 to 1 against syrian war world
[25:05.200 --> 25:10.760]  net daily and if you pull up our article we just said 99 to 1 just to be you know people
[25:10.760 --> 25:16.560]  accuse me of exaggerating and sometimes i do by accident i got to be honest i tend to
[25:16.560 --> 25:21.880]  actually not tell you how bad things are just because it sounds too crazy or when things
[25:21.880 --> 25:27.600]  are really good i i just i just went with one congresspersons 99 to 1 and had that headline
[25:27.600 --> 25:32.880]  up but showed the 500 to 1 type stuff under it we can pull up the world net daily article
[25:32.880 --> 25:41.000]  but also both the info wars dot com type in 99 99 to 1 against the war 99 percent of americans
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  against the war info wars dot com you can pull it up and the reason our article is important
[25:45.000 --> 25:52.640]  is you can then link directly through to all the actual tweets and press releases and websites
[25:52.640 --> 26:01.600]  by the bipartisan republicans and democrats saying they've never never never seen this
[26:01.600 --> 26:08.480]  much opposition so the term false flag is now mainstream the term stage terror is now mainstream
[26:08.480 --> 26:13.400]  the term hagelian dialectic is now mainstream the term problem ranching solution is now
[26:13.400 --> 26:20.920]  being used on c span fox news and cnn the russian report is out that by the way i don't
[26:20.920 --> 26:25.880]  just believe the russians the turks that have one of the biggest armies in europe probably
[26:25.880 --> 26:32.040]  the third largest well maybe the largest for actual troops they want war they've been
[26:32.040 --> 26:36.680]  shelling syria off and on for two and a half years they want to take a big part of syria
[26:36.680 --> 26:43.880]  okay they used to run syria under the ottoman empire the corrupt turkish government last
[26:43.880 --> 26:48.560]  year and this year caught al-qaeda jihadis trying to cross the border into syria with
[26:48.560 --> 26:58.640]  the nerve gas okay the the rebels have uploaded video after video after video with them loading
[26:58.640 --> 27:03.760]  it singing songs to a summit lot and you can go to info wars dot com pull them up but now
[27:03.760 --> 27:11.160]  it's even bbc ap roiders fox news you name it it is real jihadis the same ones taking
[27:11.160 --> 27:16.520]  over christian villages blowing everything up chopping christian priest heads off shooting
[27:16.520 --> 27:23.800]  nuns in the back i mean there's new videos every day we put on info wars dot com and
[27:23.800 --> 27:29.960]  the good news is they're finally getting picked up by the news this is who obama calls his
[27:29.960 --> 27:35.680]  re his rebels who they did call protesters and demonstrators before so it is incredibly
[27:35.680 --> 27:42.360]  evil and i want to open the phones up and get your take on this is this call the collapse
[27:42.360 --> 27:49.040]  in confidence in the establishment and what will they do do you think to get the public
[27:49.040 --> 27:54.240]  back in line to go along with what the globalists are pushing the toll free number to join us
[27:54.240 --> 27:57.920]  is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine the weekday number doesn't

[28:02.200 --> 28:07.400]  seven seven seven eight nine alex eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine

[28:26.080 --> 28:31.560]  since the eighties the nineteen eight six start treaty they pull them out of mothballs
[28:31.560 --> 28:35.320]  load them on trucks don't sign paperwork just like the thing that happened in my not north
[28:35.320 --> 28:43.080]  dakota in 2007 that was an actual scandal and they're being shipped to to south carolina
[28:43.080 --> 28:48.320]  we called the base and recorded it month tuesday wednesday thursday friday and when they answer

[28:53.080 --> 28:57.800]  deny it which which again just adds more credence to our source so that's pretty creepy we'll

[33:02.760 --> 33:13.200]  from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network crashing through
[33:13.200 --> 33:28.880]  the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network you know folks I've
[33:28.880 --> 33:37.280]  told listeners many many times that we have Fox News CNN MSNBC CNBC C span on throughout
[33:37.280 --> 33:42.760]  the building just in hallways we've got televisions hooked up to different channels so we can monitor
[33:42.760 --> 33:50.160]  things just standard newsroom hookup so during the break I go back to a glass of water and
[33:50.160 --> 33:56.320]  I'm watching CNN with retired military officers on saying you're not allowed to protest when
[33:56.320 --> 34:02.680]  you're active duty in the military and the people that are criticizing Obama and the
[34:02.680 --> 34:08.160]  serious strike they could be arrested and we were actually able to then back it up on
[34:08.160 --> 34:12.840]  the DVR we haven't recorded if I have time later I'll play a clip of it but the point
[34:12.840 --> 34:16.640]  here is over a week and a half ago before Obama even gave his speech and announced the
[34:16.640 --> 34:22.480]  strike but when they had Kerry pushing it we saw on Twitter and Facebook all these military
[34:22.480 --> 34:28.160]  people because a lot of them were info wars listeners they were sending us the photos
[34:28.160 --> 34:33.280]  directly to our email and saying hey look at my photo you know I'm going public here
[34:33.280 --> 34:38.160]  please don't say my name because some of them have Facebook's that you know they use a gnome
[34:38.160 --> 34:42.760]  to plume or a pen name on some of them have gone public we've had some of them on the
[34:42.760 --> 34:49.760]  show active duty and they're now on TV saying you better watch it or will arrest you folks
[34:49.760 --> 34:58.160]  did the German military in 1944 have a right to try to resist Hitler of course they did
[34:58.160 --> 35:04.120]  if the president was hypothetically beating children's brains out with baseball bats on
[35:04.120 --> 35:08.920]  the White House lawn would it be illegal well Nixon said it wouldn't be illegal when the
[35:08.920 --> 35:12.960]  president does something it's not illegal of course the courts common law constitution
[35:12.960 --> 35:21.600]  say that's not true the president can be arrested for misdemeanors like anybody else well these
[35:21.600 --> 35:27.360]  are high crimes ladies and gentlemen high crimes and misdemeanors you can be impeached
[35:27.360 --> 35:30.720]  and then after you've been found guilty by the House and the Senate they can have your
[35:30.720 --> 35:37.480]  butt clapped in irons any of these jag courts could go after the globalist but the number
[35:37.480 --> 35:41.520]  one thing that needs to happen in congressman Walter Jones is coming on this week has introduced
[35:41.520 --> 35:47.680]  the legislation is to begin impeachment proceedings on Obama because if if they don't have the
[35:47.680 --> 35:51.480]  votes in the House so they say well we're not going to vote now Obama you're allowed
[35:51.480 --> 35:56.800]  to attack no he's not no he's not you're only allowed to attack if somebody's got missiles
[35:56.800 --> 36:01.160]  fueling and is going to fire them then the Congress has already given the president the
[36:01.160 --> 36:07.600]  authorization that's why they said Sugam was going to attack England remember in 45 minutes
[36:07.600 --> 36:12.560]  if they didn't pass the war resolution and then of course they passed it and he didn't
[36:12.560 --> 36:20.440]  attack in 45 minutes the difference here is that now people are seeing through this so
[36:20.440 --> 36:27.920]  there's a constitutional crisis and day by day the awakening builds as they try to say
[36:27.920 --> 36:32.240]  you're a terrorist if you criticize the government it's unconstitutional to criticize the government
[36:32.240 --> 36:36.720]  it's illegal the founding fathers are bad Obama truth squads will come after you if you
[36:36.720 --> 36:40.800]  talk bad about the dear leader will arrest members of the military if they criticize
[36:40.800 --> 36:46.960]  this war you keep your mouth shut you shut your mouth I know so many people in media
[36:46.960 --> 36:55.360]  so many people in music in film who are all told you don't criticize government you don't
[36:55.360 --> 37:02.000]  criticize Obama or you're going to lose your job or lose your contract these aren't liberals
[37:02.000 --> 37:08.240]  these are authoritarians I mean Tom Sellick just because he's a Republican couldn't get
[37:08.240 --> 37:13.720]  work anymore as soon as he went public for the Second Amendment same thing for Charlton
[37:13.720 --> 37:17.600]  Heston who had work lined up around the block as soon as he went public for the Second Amendment
[37:17.600 --> 37:23.760]  boom no more work this is the reign of terror they've been involved in and people are standing
[37:23.760 --> 37:31.440]  up and they're saying no and so the system can't shut everybody down now it is not just
[37:31.440 --> 37:37.840]  the right of military personnel active duty noncommissioned commissioned to criticize
[37:37.840 --> 37:43.200]  an executive and to criticize their commanders when they're doing things that are patently
[37:43.200 --> 37:50.480]  unconstitutional and patently illegal it is not their right it is their absolute duty
[37:50.480 --> 37:54.520]  I've read the uniform code I've read the military codes and they're all based on the
[37:54.520 --> 38:00.240]  Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence Magna Carta common law folks
[38:00.240 --> 38:05.720]  if someone gives you an order to commit a crime you become just as guilty as who gave
[38:05.720 --> 38:12.560]  the order when you follow it that's why the mafia soldiers get in trouble for doing a
[38:12.560 --> 38:20.960]  murder and the boss gets in trouble for ordering the murder the Nuremberg precept is that just
[38:20.960 --> 38:27.080]  following orders does not make you not guilty in fact it makes you just as guilty and then
[38:27.080 --> 38:33.120]  you have the Führer precept that came in 1933 saying the Führer is above the law and
[38:33.120 --> 38:38.840]  so our government is bringing in the Führer precept the leader of precept the king precept
[38:38.840 --> 38:44.680]  the right of kings the sovereign where under NDA Obama can just say take them away to the
[38:44.680 --> 38:50.960]  dungeon and then all of his designates can spy on you without warrants or secretly arrest
[38:50.960 --> 38:55.480]  you or shoot you in the back for no reason or kill you during an interrogation and nobody
[38:55.480 --> 39:00.320]  gets in trouble because we're getting deep down the tunnel and our military knows the
[39:00.320 --> 39:05.760]  government grows the drugs and ships a man our military knows that the big contractors
[39:05.760 --> 39:11.920]  run the sex trade our military knows our government runs and has been training Al Qaeda
[39:11.920 --> 39:17.120]  for at least two and a half years in Jordan and in Libya and is trying to turn the Egyptian
[39:17.120 --> 39:23.120]  government over to Al Qaeda while they blow up dozens of churches every week and our media
[39:23.120 --> 39:30.840]  calls them protesters our military knows about Benghazi you've got the head state department
[39:30.840 --> 39:37.920]  official mr. Hicks going public we've got that clip coming up Gregory Hicks saying he's
[39:37.920 --> 39:42.640]  been threatened and told to shut up really who would have thought he'd been threatened
[39:42.640 --> 39:47.320]  the other whistleblowers have disappeared and we're told they're in the witness protection
[39:47.320 --> 39:53.320]  program and maybe never seen again what like Jimmy Hoffa they're probably dead ladies and
[39:53.320 --> 39:57.720]  gentlemen notice you've heard oh a bunch of the people involved in Benghazi you'll never
[39:57.720 --> 40:03.680]  they've had their names changed huh oh I bet they had their names changed Hicks has been
[40:03.680 --> 40:08.400]  smart enough to stay public I'll guarantee you some of them are been chopped up folks
[40:08.400 --> 40:14.040]  and fed to the fishes as they all know you think you're gonna just know what happened
[40:14.040 --> 40:20.600]  in Benghazi and not be killed the problem is is that multiple situation rooms on aircraft
[40:20.600 --> 40:30.360]  carriers and at NATO and its scent come in Florida we're all watching live predator feeds
[40:30.360 --> 40:35.360]  of the seven hour killing of the ambassador and others and watch Al Qaeda haul all the
[40:35.360 --> 40:40.240]  missiles and weapons out of the three warehouses I've talked to the military it's all been
[40:40.240 --> 40:46.360]  seen it's all known the whole military knows oh my gosh oh my gosh the government runs Al
[40:46.360 --> 40:51.840]  Qaeda of course they run Al Qaeda and they run Al Qaeda and they're gonna turn Syria over
[40:51.840 --> 40:57.960]  to Al Qaeda and of course they ordered the rebels to launch a chemical attack Obama says
[40:57.960 --> 41:02.960]  my red line is you launch chemical attack I'm gonna bombard and invade then they bombard
[41:02.960 --> 41:10.480]  them with Turkish weapons the Israelis have been bombing them cruise missiles Syria is
[41:10.480 --> 41:17.400]  holding on being attacked by Turkey Jordan Israel Al Qaeda troops out of Iraq US NATO
[41:17.400 --> 41:23.400]  special forces I mean they are just was blowing up every church massacring everyone just is
[41:23.400 --> 41:28.800]  absolutely 20 and the military is sitting there giving intel and giving drone intelligence
[41:28.800 --> 41:33.240]  to Al Qaeda and the truth is the military is freaking out right now because they're
[41:33.240 --> 41:37.720]  there all they're following orders folks they're in there serving Al Qaeda who's the main force
[41:37.720 --> 41:43.960]  the main force and it is melting things down the globalists are still in the pole position
[41:43.960 --> 41:49.280]  to win the race but they've they've got their RPMs as high as they'll go and the engine
[41:49.280 --> 41:54.160]  is rattling about to explode and they got 10 more laps to go folks their engine to use
[41:54.160 --> 42:01.240]  a NASCAR analogy is going to blow up the question is what's gonna happen when the engine blows
[42:01.240 --> 42:08.800]  on this they'll probably stage a big new giant false flag or blow something up and you know
[42:08.800 --> 42:13.320]  say Assad did it and it'll be so horrible they'll use that as excuse to clamp down because

[42:16.800 --> 42:22.640]  have a guest coming on I realized they know everybody's awake they just have to have the
[42:22.640 --> 42:27.480]  confidence game of saying we never said there was a red line or of course when he boots

[48:16.440 --> 48:24.600]  your phone calls but i noticed i was on google news and i saw one of the big liberal websites
[48:24.600 --> 48:34.280]  i'm not going to give it a plug attacking me and saying i'm crazy saying that the rebels
[48:34.280 --> 48:38.680]  clearly launched a chemical attack to blame aside when you've got major governments saying
[48:38.680 --> 48:45.800]  that and they call me a tin foil hat wearer that doesn't work anymore you people sit up
[48:45.800 --> 48:51.000]  there and you defend tyranny and there's all these comments by democrats saying horrible
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.240]  things about me and how i'm a dumb republic and all this stuff this isn't about republican
[48:55.240 --> 49:04.480]  or democrat i oppose the iraq war i opposed the upping of this situation in in other
[49:04.480 --> 49:10.480]  areas of the world like afghanistan i'm a constitutionalist i want peace if we're not
[49:10.480 --> 49:16.640]  attacked first i want truth and justice and when you look at obama supporters particularly
[49:16.640 --> 49:22.760]  i've never seen a group of people that are more tribal that are more group think that
[49:22.760 --> 49:32.040]  are more cult like in their absolute fieldy to obama and so okay fine give them another
[49:32.040 --> 49:37.000]  peace prize then because the deer in the break i was in another part of the office and fox
[49:37.000 --> 49:42.760]  news was on and it was like a big victory for the rebels they've taken the great christian
[49:42.760 --> 49:47.480]  city of such and such and it showed them blowing up the churches and then i walked in and seeing
[49:47.480 --> 49:51.960]  in was praising and saying big victory for the rebels they've taken the christian city
[49:51.960 --> 49:58.320]  of and now europe the christians are fleeing and they're begging for to be able to escape
[49:58.320 --> 50:03.280]  to europe but that probably won't be allowed and the host looked all satisfied like we're
[50:03.280 --> 50:10.080]  gonna tonight we'll feast on christian flesh it remind me of like soran or something or
[50:10.080 --> 50:16.880]  saruman and the lord of the rings saying tonight you will feast on man flesh i mean it's just

[51:35.200 --> 51:39.360]  be terrorist and the founding fathers are bad and veterans of the number one threat
[51:39.360 --> 51:44.600]  i thought all this was set up for for al-qaeda oh you run them this is just a big power grab
[51:44.600 --> 51:50.200]  and see people get that now and the establishment has miscalculated how dumb they thought the
[51:50.200 --> 51:54.560]  american people were now before i go to john b wells and then your phone calls we're getting
[51:54.560 --> 52:04.920]  john on right now you saw a lot of mccain on tv getting some mild questions but i reviewed
[52:04.920 --> 52:10.680]  a bunch of videos this weekend shot by independent groups like am tv and phoenix and others that
[52:10.680 --> 52:15.680]  do a great job and they sent us this clip we're about to play thank thank god they digs i hadn't
[52:15.680 --> 52:21.000]  seen this of the whole crowd angry at mccain not from the not from the crowd but from
[52:21.000 --> 52:25.320]  behind mccain you get to see everybody angry at him and agreeing when the guy says you're
[52:25.320 --> 52:32.880]  a traitor you you're involved with al-qaeda you need to be arrested and mccain is scared
[52:32.880 --> 52:37.640]  and he should be folks because when everybody figures out how this really works you guys
[52:37.640 --> 52:42.840]  are all going to be held accountable through a court of law not an india a but through
[52:42.840 --> 52:49.640]  constitutional court because it's all going to come out mccain met with the leaders of
[52:49.640 --> 52:55.240]  al-qaeda in syria on record earlier this year let's go to this bombshell audio clip
[52:55.240 --> 52:59.200]  if you're a tv viewer you can see it but for radio listeners you can go to info wars dot
[52:59.200 --> 53:03.920]  com and prison planet dot com is in the top tiles you can see the video that's even more
[53:03.920 --> 53:08.720]  powerful but here's the audio hi mr. mccain i mean this with all due respect sir as an
[53:08.720 --> 53:13.000]  elected official for our country this guy looks like he's in the army like you need to be representative
[53:13.000 --> 53:18.160]  of the people and against this great or and for this great nation but for far too long
[53:18.160 --> 53:21.760]  now and the rest of congress including the executive branch of government along with
[53:21.760 --> 53:26.000]  the judicial and legislative have turned your back on the american people and their core
[53:26.000 --> 53:31.160]  values and principles i can say with great confidence and speak on behalf of all americans
[53:31.160 --> 53:36.680]  that your actions against this country are treasonous all of you against the will of
[53:36.680 --> 53:41.400]  the american people have aided and embedded the enemy you and the rest of congress including
[53:41.400 --> 53:46.960]  the president of the united states have went against the will of your people in syria in
[53:46.960 --> 53:52.240]  syria regardless of your position in vote whether it is a yes or no is still a political
[53:52.240 --> 53:56.800]  smoke screen and believe wholeheartedly you do not care about the will and well being
[53:56.800 --> 54:02.360]  of the america of america or its people you lie to the american people about the chemical
[54:02.360 --> 54:07.040]  attacks in syria the american people know that it was our government that is most likely
[54:07.040 --> 54:12.120]  responsible there is strong evidence including video that these attacks were carried out by
[54:12.120 --> 54:18.360]  al-qaeda and you advocate starting a war even maybe world war by taking the same attack
[54:18.360 --> 54:24.600]  and blaming it on a sod president brock hussein obama has been supporting terrorism the united
[54:24.600 --> 54:29.880]  states has been funding and aiding in organizations including the muslim brotherhood and al-qaeda
[54:29.880 --> 54:34.640]  for many years now the king has no clothes we're supposed to be defeating on the battlefield
[54:34.640 --> 54:39.560]  at least one country in this world stood against this government terrorism that you guys support
[54:39.560 --> 54:45.400]  in egypt the people of egypt throughout mohammed morose which obama supported as well as countless
[54:45.400 --> 54:51.640]  christians have lost their lives under evil people such as this you sworn oath to protect
[54:51.640 --> 54:58.160]  us and protect from all enemies both foreign and domestic the simple irony is the domestic
[54:58.160 --> 55:03.200]  enemy now in this country is the people in government of the united states and mccain
[55:03.200 --> 55:07.960]  and you and the rest of our leaders are accountable for their actions it's too bad someone like
[55:07.960 --> 55:12.120]  me is not in office to hold you accountable because if i was in a position of power or
[55:12.120 --> 55:17.160]  authority i would have you all arrested and tried for treason against my country under
[55:17.160 --> 55:24.720]  the grounds of eighteen u.s.c. twenty three eighty one treason u.s. code whoever owing
[55:24.720 --> 55:30.360]  allegiance to the united states levies war against them or heros to their enemies giving
[55:30.360 --> 55:35.680]  them aid and comfort within united states or elsewhere is guilty of treason that is
[55:35.680 --> 55:41.920]  the code and mccain is laughing of it this country rose up against you recently the ratio
[55:41.920 --> 55:47.840]  hang on i have a fright of free speech i could finish the american people opposed the going
[55:47.840 --> 55:51.880]  to war with syria which includes many marines and other veterans by the thousand that's
[55:51.880 --> 55:55.640]  good one hundred and ninety nine two all right most of people are supporting him and clapping
[55:55.640 --> 55:59.800]  but a fewer were booing and trying to get his speech shut down but mccain everywhere
[55:59.800 --> 56:05.720]  he went got responses like that and that's the way you respond to these traders john
[56:05.720 --> 56:10.880]  b wells a host of coast to coast a m on the weekends syndicated talk show host i want
[56:10.880 --> 56:14.360]  to get your take on this and tell us some of the key points you want to break down on
[56:14.360 --> 56:18.120]  the next hour that's coming up thanks for joining us it's good to be with you again
[56:18.120 --> 56:24.720]  alex thanks for having me on well john mccain has gotten my attention over the years as
[56:24.720 --> 56:30.880]  being one who is the ultimate politician here he doesn't seem to be able to take a side
[56:30.880 --> 56:35.320]  he just he just goes from one side of the aisle to the other and he just oscillates
[56:35.320 --> 56:40.000]  back and forth like that and somehow you never really get a fix on what his politics really
[56:40.000 --> 56:46.960]  are but i can tell you this he's the poster boy for term limits in my opinion and i don't
[56:46.960 --> 56:52.120]  know i was talking with a fellow last night named michael bolden who was talking about
[56:52.120 --> 56:56.280]  nullification beginning at the state level and just forget about congress because they're
[56:56.280 --> 57:00.160]  never going to do what we want to do and i'm wondering if there is some sort of a mechanism
[57:00.160 --> 57:05.280]  to just remove these people because there are so many questions and and there are so
[57:05.280 --> 57:09.680]  but there's so many questions and so many questionable observations that have been made
[57:09.680 --> 57:16.040]  about his conduct and several other people's in con in congress that i think maybe the

[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.640]  constitutional avenues to do that john b wells host of coast to coast a m dot com with the
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:47.440]  great george noring and others joins us caravan to midnight dot com is his personal site as
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:53.400]  well as jb wells dot com and he's on with us right now but hey let's go to the calls
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:58.280]  early here let's talk to kaleb in oregon who wants to talk specifically we have people
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:06.000]  calling 30 minutes before john got on wanting to talk to him so you're on with john b wells
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.480]  hey go ahead kaleb yeah hi um it's a total pleasure to talk to both of you guys i admire
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:17.840]  both your shows very much uh the last few nights on coast to coast with john with uh
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:23.560]  professor griff was amazing and um last night show as well i'm looking forward to stewart
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:33.360]  roads who's been on with you alex um i just wanted like to say uh yeah oh man it's so
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:42.720]  crazy right now my question would be who pulls the trigger to implement an impeachment process
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.840]  because with president clinton and all that i'm not trying to romanticize him at all but
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:55.520]  who who starts it yeah they went after him for for fallatio and cigars uh why not go
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:02.440]  after obama and that's a good good question um john b wells the best way to approach this
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:09.320]  is through the uh since we have since we are involved in what amounts to the cult of personality
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:17.440]  then i think we ought to go at it first on the basis of public relations uh the pr trick
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.760]  and what i mean by that is first challenge would be i think before we ever get to the
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:28.320]  to the uh the forms that we need to sign and the submissions we need to make i think we
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:35.080]  should begin with a with a number of exposés regarding this nobel peace prize that he won
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:42.400]  for being elected president i've said before if uh dynamite nobel wanted to give the united
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:47.720]  states a peace prize for showing how transparently colorblind we are then that would have been
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:53.800]  one thing but to have given the president elect a nobel peace prize for nothing is lame
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:58.680]  in itself and i think the first thing to do is uh is go at this thing from the pr level
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:06.520]  and and more to the point massive demonstrations that one way or another are going to be covered
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:11.840]  either by mainstream media or by alternative media which brzezinski just said alternative
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:17.480]  media is what's responsible for having put the syrian attack on hold for as long as as
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:23.920]  it's been on hold i believe that one way or another these these demonstrations for no
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:30.600]  war a la 1960 pick one sixty five sixty six sixty seven sixty eight sixty nine i think
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.560]  we need to bring those back and i think they need to be brought back in such a manner that
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.760]  even the mainstream bought and paid for media cannot ignore them or they will lose what
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:43.880]  remains of their credibility and they will cease to exist which might not be a bad thing
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:49.000]  in any case well you just said about two minutes what i tried to say in a whole hour and i
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.840]  want to flush that out when we come back because that is the key and i think we've reached
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.000]  a tipping point but that doesn't mean we've won here we are right now at the crossroads
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.640]  i want to get your take on that john but anything else you'd like to add uh tale over to that
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:06.080]  answer your question because i he's absolutely right we should call for the repeal of the
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:10.720]  nobel peace prize they should take it back or obama through decency because he said he
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.480]  didn't deserve it last week when he got questioned well then he should we should have a white
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:20.720]  house petition for him to give it back absolutely yeah um you know the only thing i'd like to
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:27.920]  really add now is just uh yeah my father was the greatest man i ever knew and he passed
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:35.320]  away a couple years ago from cancer at fifty six years old a nasty bone blood cancer and
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:41.560]  because of all the poisons that were being uh sure you know inundated with and um and
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:49.160]  you both are you know heroes to me and in the same way he was in that uh the lesson he
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:54.120]  taught me that stuck with me the most was that to always search and speak out the truth
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:05:00.320]  absolutely that's what it's all about god bless you and god bless your father is hurricane

[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:41.880]  i tell you folks every day or two when i'm walking down the street and i walk by listeners
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:46.920]  to my radio broadcast they say hey i love your show but i really love john b wells in
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:52.560]  the weekend coast to coast a m and i'm a frequent guest on his show but i tell you it is it
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:57.160]  is hard to tune in and then to tune out with the guests that all of coast to coast a m
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:03.640]  has but of course that john b wells the hardcore liberty stance that he's taking on the guest
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:10.440]  he's having is probably some of the most pro constitution pro freedom libertarian not republican
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:16.000]  or democratic type radio out there he's also folks don't know who he is most of you do he
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.080]  is an extremely famous and successful voiceover talent up there at the very top of the food
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:27.480]  chain for major movies and a tv ads you name it and he's graciously said to lose some voiceovers
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:31.440]  for us but i haven't tapped him to do that yet i've been so busy but john b wells rides
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:37.600]  shotgun with us for the rest of this second hour today because i wanted to get his take
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:42.840]  on things and and and and where he thinks historically we're at right now but going
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:48.340]  over some of the headlines carry of course said last week that saudi arabia has agreed
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:52.880]  to support military strikes against syria and to pay for it now we've known america has
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:57.800]  been like a vending machine to foreign interest and special interest but now i mean it's like
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:03.240]  we're a two dollar whore on the side of the road on south congress in austin texas yes
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:08.720]  they were two dollars about nineteen twenty or something but the point is is that i mean
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:15.360]  this is getting ridiculous mercenaries out for hire to al-qaeda and al-qaeda line meanwhile
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:22.480]  russia today reports naval forces face off russian and chinese ships against us ships
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:28.880]  i don't like seeing america lined up on the side of al-qaeda and we're seeing five hundred
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.840]  to one ninety nine to one two hundred and something to one congress people are saying
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:37.760]  depending on their office against this we have nine percent approval rating for the
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:42.560]  war in roiders the military is coming out in mass active duty and saying we don't want
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:48.360]  to be part of it and cnn last hour i saw him during the break was cheerleading to make
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:54.840]  examples of these people and arrest them well folks it is court marshal it is a court marshaling
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:00.440]  offense if you're told go do your duty you know go take this to point a to point b or
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:07.680]  it's in a declared war you know if you get scared and won't follow orders but if you're
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:13.920]  told to shoot these men women and children in the back and you follow the order you are
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:19.320]  now an accomplice nuremberg if you say no you're not a hero you're doing your duty so
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:25.160]  these men and women are doing their duty a lot of officers putting on facebook and
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:31.920]  twitter you can see them if it real alex jones i will not serve for al-qaeda i will not be
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:35.680]  part of al-qaeda's air force and a week and a half ago the media said when we first broke
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:41.920]  this that we had made it up that it was a hoax remember that well now they admit it's real
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:47.480]  but that these people are traitors john b wells what do you say to that and and i want your
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:52.280]  take on how we stop this war if obama can't get congress to pass it as they're now saying
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:57.360]  well why'd he go to congress to begin with and you know his impeachment the option what
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:05.320]  what are your ideas to turn this around john b wells that's a that's a that's a very very
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:14.160]  pregnant question and i believe that the what we're going to see is some oath keeping let
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.840]  us keep in mind that i think that people ask well where are the anti-war protests that
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:25.440]  the so-called left of the sixties we're putting on the left flank moved over to the right
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:32.360]  and the right flank is now moved over to the left so now we are against the the undeclared
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:39.080]  wars the burgeoning police state the big government the high taxation those were typically the
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:45.000]  clarion calls from the left back when the left right paradigm was was really drawn into
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.080]  sharp relief for the american public in the world at large by the way just as an aside
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:56.280]  liberal and conservative seem to be the exact opposites in europe so i don't want to get
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:01.920]  too far field here but what's happening now is that there is no draft i assure you that
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:07.480]  if there were a draft there would be some street protests would already be in a fully
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:13.680]  blown and ongoing every weekend somewhere but uh... failing that since we have a volunteer
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:19.200]  army these people didn't sign up for this these people still swore and oh swore and
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:25.160]  oh they didn't just say okay didn't they didn't act we asked to it they swore and oh to defend
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:31.080]  the constitution and they volunteered that's correct they are not that they are not obligated
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:36.320]  to do anything that violates the constitution nothing and if they uh... if the warmongers
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:42.120]  want to call them traitors well then let them because you can kill and you can jail a revolutionary
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:47.800]  but you cannot kill nor jail a revolution and i believe that our military and the people
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:55.000]  who honor their oaths their oaths to defend this constitution the oath keepers uh... and
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.520]  not taking anything from stewart roats is going to be on coast to coast tonight the oath keepers
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:02.840]  are going to be the tip of the spear in this when it comes right down to it and i believe
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:11.320]  that if people begin to say the peace prize your attorney general the gun runner ben gazi
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:23.040]  you lied your secretary of state lied lied not pervericated lied you're out either leave
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:28.120]  peacefully or we don't have to take the streets with torches and pitchfork shall we have to
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:34.920]  do nothing do nothing pay nothing do nothing sit what do you think what happened if we
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:40.280]  just decided we're going to sit it out for a month the month will go by quickly and we'll
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:44.920]  just see what happens then you're spending four trillion you're pulling in two trillion
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:51.960]  in taxes you still come on come up with only one percent increase in gdp i think we'll
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:57.280]  just pull the cord on this train and and just stop doing what we're doing and i like your
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:03.200]  point earlier about every man woman and child in a pr war we have the truth they have lies
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.760]  point out that we are not al-qaeda's air force and what are they doing blowing up all these
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.280]  churches and look at all the evidence that the rebels launched the chemical attack let
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:17.720]  me ask you that question what do you make of them with no proof saying that basher aside
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:23.880]  launched this chemical attack utter nonsense it's just it's just the uh... it's the excuse
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:30.440]  to begin a new conflict is al-qaeda al-ciyeda or is it not it's been pretty much established
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:38.080]  that cia and al-qaeda are almost one at least even if that's not true there are enough people
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:42.640]  who believe that it's true to make it take on a life of its own so if you support the
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:49.600]  rebels and the rebels are al-qaeda and the cia is al-qaeda then the motive behind this
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:57.000]  military action becomes clear now if we throw if if they throw a war and nobody comes then
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:06.840]  what i'll tell you what the thing that scouson has warned us about for years and that's a
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:12.800]  false flag in the form of a little mushroom cloud sprouting somewhere probably in a in
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:19.160]  a fairly uh... harmless area if i can just grasp for that they'll blow up a bunch of
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:23.080]  christians in texas or tennessee something like that just enough to scare everybody
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:28.880]  to death and uh... and and and then get them to react and uh... to that and then in future
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:34.600]  act out of fear of it happening in this question do you think this is a big awakening we're
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:41.400]  seeing and uh... do you think that the establishment has jumped the shark yes both of those things
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:42.600]  in fact
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.960]  alex i i would even uh... i would not ask anyone to join me in this but i i will
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:51.880]  i've reached that age where i just don't care i really don't care i try to measure my words
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:57.880]  i try to hold my tongue i try to pray for guidance every time i i open my mouth about
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.840]  something important that this really is my greatest fear if uh... fear is what i can
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.480]  call it my greatest concern i'll call it that because we're instructed in scripture to fear
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:13.040]  nothing and so i try to roll with that as well i believe that in the more simple terms
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:20.520]  one can break these motives down to the most basic components i think we'll find hubris
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:29.200]  at the basis of most of them power and control and what i am my greatest concern is that
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:35.160]  this leader albeit president is somewhat of a figurehead and he receives his directions
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:39.600]  from other people he still is responsible and it is his name that will be in the history
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:46.480]  books i'm afraid that it is that it is more than possible but even likely that this president
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:52.400]  would destroy this country to secure a place in history for himself rather than be forgotten
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:58.400]  by history as the abject failure of the president and leader that he is wow john b well straight

[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:43.360]  know the silver bullet walter jones the congressman has an impeachment bill if obama launches
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:46.760]  a war without congressional approval now he says he doesn't need it because he can't get
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:55.720]  the votes states rights what do we i mean i agree pr stunts you know to somebody parachute

[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:06.960]  do we do because my gut tells me we're all in grave danger because the word is the wall
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:12.360]  street journal called for blowing up friday the russian the russian ship saying they're
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:17.200]  giving a sod intel i mean do these hubris filled because you said it that's what floats
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:22.960]  this hot air balloon is these elites have gotten so disconnected that that they think
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:28.720]  they can just continue to push everybody around including the u.s. military including i'm
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.520]  ranting john b wells what do you think we should do because i'm asking you what do we
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:38.680]  do i think we should do all of it i think that that first of all part of the reason
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:43.800]  now that was just a brit uh... brzezinski's comment that alternative media stole the attack
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:49.920]  on syria what he left out and what he is probably not prepared to say is that all of these telephone
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:56.920]  calls emails uh... all this communication with the with uh... with the legislators
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:04.640]  in congress on the state level as well when the people start getting up at the the so-called
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:08.640]  leaders begin to take notice they have all of the leaders only have one agenda that's
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:12.600]  to remain in their positions of leadership and the reason that it looks so stupid right
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:17.920]  now is because it's all falling down that's why it is falling down their motives are being
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:22.720]  revealed alex i've said this a couple of times about the awakening that everybody wanted
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:28.120]  in twenty twelve so you know some people i've said if i'm giving anybody a rerun i apologize
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:32.200]  for that but i want to make sure that everybody hears this we have awakened all right to find
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:39.600]  that we have been cloaked in darkness against our will for many many years and now we at
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:45.120]  least are aware of the fact that we are we are in darkness and now we can start to clear
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:50.960]  those clouds away and drop those screens and as these screens come down the perpetrators
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:56.280]  of this nonsense are panicking and that's why they're behaving in this cartoonish fashion
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:01.440]  some of them appear to not even know where they are and certainly they're they're not
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:06.800]  even aware of the of the gravity of the world exactly i'll be i'll be honest with you i'll
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:10.920]  be honest with you john i'm not scared of them sending a black ops team to kill me
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:15.880]  i'm because i can't live in fear but i do get scared by how weak and weird they are
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:20.920]  when i watch c span and see these people now and carry was almost passing out and acting
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:26.440]  really weird i mean it's scary that they're so mentally ill yes it is and in fact not
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:31.800]  to criticize the lord's creatures here but take a look at some of them look positively
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:39.480]  certifiably psychotic look at polosian the looks on her face look at this this john carry
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:45.000]  a look at barack obama and his hypnotic manner of speaking i've got a book right over here
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.240]  called my new order by adolf hitler and if you were to get a hold of that copy and it's
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:53.800]  not easy to do a copy of that book you would find that what you're hearing from the current
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:26:01.080]  incumbent is archetypal textbook book adolf hitler speak oh yeah it shows of gerbil's
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:09.040]  mind control absolutely 100 because those nazis were good at it and if a technique works
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:13.280]  then there's no reason not to repackage it well you know what they call the domestic
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:19.080]  estapo they called it right security which means homeland security right the black uniforms
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:23.720]  the court why do you think they've copied the nazi so much well because the first of
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:28.840]  all the nazi so i had really good fashion sense i don't i don't want to boss yeah you
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:34.440]  go boss i'm glad you said it i didn't have a great fashion sense and notice how anytime
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:41.240]  the um the uh the evil entity is depicted always has way better fashion sense than the
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:48.280]  the the good entity always well why would someone write in the bible why would anybody
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:54.480]  way way back in the day remark make remarks of the effect that lucifer was the most beautiful
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:27:00.560]  most handsome angel up there he was in charge of the music he was he was just the cat's
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:06.600]  meow just the coolest guy ever and yet he's the perpetrator of his that's that's symbol
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:12.680]  the satanic entity he's representative of everything that is evil everything that takes
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:17.480]  something that has been created and twists and perverts it look how the swat guys dress
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:23.560]  now in recent years they've taken to the masks over their faces and the and the german style
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:30.400]  very mocked helmets and the goggles and most of them carry even uh hk's german made firearms
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:36.520]  machine guns submachine guns and so forth it look war war two came to an end the nazi
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:41.880] ism did not end the nazi agenda did not end it just morphed into a different form and
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:46.480]  it was just like when when uh when gorbachev took the the plaque that said communist off
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:50.080]  his desk reached out under and pulled out the one said capitalist and set that one on
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:56.120]  his desk proof business as usual here we go same old song with a few new lines so what's
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:28:01.200]  the answer get behind walter jones's legislation to begin impeachment i mean if we're gonna
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:05.760]  impeach over line about sex we've got to impeach about line about chemical weapons and arming
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:11.360]  al-qaeda and and and i talked to our military no one i know in the military including officers
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:16.920]  high level aren't they're all completely upset so that's even crazier they want to start
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:21.880]  world war three with the military upset that's not a good idea well somebody wants to start
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:26.440]  world war three because there's there's money in it you know if you watch the second surelock
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:32.400]  holmes movie you find that uh moriarty says look the the best possible scenario is that
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:39.640]  you make the bullets and the bandages that's right make money off both sides john b wells

[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:54.080]  pales in significance when you realize that we've got a government so evil that he wants
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:58.720]  to get rid of syria and start a war with iran and i'm no fan of iran i think iran sent
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:03.940]  some really provocative out of control stuff but iran isn't starting the fight and the
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:09.640]  russians are on their side and it's a war crime to start a war we're going to your
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:14.560]  phone calls for john b wells syndicate a talk show host and great political analysts with
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:18.480]  us right now job before we go to these calls any other points that you think are important
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:22.680]  to make about how to turn this around and what's your gut level not even prediction
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:27.840]  but because that's up to the people right now where do you expect this to go because
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:33.680]  clearly the the pressure is mounting against obama and the globalist against this especially
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:38.840]  as the massacre of christians accelerates i don't see them getting away with it but
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:44.160]  just to show that they're in charge as you said hubris at one level of my gut i think
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.800]  they're going to go ahead with an attack and now they're talking about it being boots
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.800]  on the ground
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:56.240]  if i don't believe that these people have have even pondered what will happen if they
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:01.880]  do such a stupid thing because i believe the entire country will turn against them you
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:03.760]  know
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:08.360]  we always think in terms of what can we do immediately but these solutions take a little
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:15.240]  bit longer to to put into effect than we like we have an election coming up next year if
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:19.720]  we make it that far which i think we'll make it in one form or another to those elections
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:25.240]  we have been allowed to not only allowed but encourage to think that the single person's
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:29.960]  single vote just doesn't matter well that's not true it does matter we've been led to
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:33.120]  believe that oh if you send a letter to one of your representatives you'll wind up on
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.440]  a list you're already on a list everything that you say everything that you do is being
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:43.480]  monitored what does it tell you you got nazi looking ss troop looking people on the ground
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:51.800]  now the swat team is sent on on what 90% of any felony warrants that are to be served
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:57.720]  he sent a swat team instead of a couple of capable officers for the arrest it's nonsense
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:07.040]  get registered insist insist that voter identification be required well you're going to disenfranchise
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:11.080]  a bunch of people with that really the presidential elections once every four years they caught
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:18.280]  the illegals on record voting illegally everywhere absolutely and there's nothing racist about
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:24.080]  it if you can make it to the polls once every four years for presidential election you can
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:30.360]  make it down to to your local bureau absolutely i mean this is all about this is all about
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:34.440]  bringing in illegal voters to leverage us out we're going to the calls but i think you
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:42.360]  hit the key here john b wells and that's this as we look at this before they could target
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:49.600]  a talk show host or a movie star or an artist and persecute them if they were pro-liberty
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:54.920]  but now everybody speaking out they can't get everybody and i think we've already crossed
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:59.840]  that rubicon but people need to know solutions like you keep saying don't happen overnight
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:03.680]  it's like force 10 from nav around based on a true story partially when they blow up the
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:07.560]  dam and it doesn't collapse right away and he says give it a minute give it a minute
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:13.400]  it takes time and we're seeing that so people should be i think very very positive right
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:18.040]  now quite frankly this is going better than i thought it would awakening wise yeah i keep
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:21.400]  in mind now this is a little bit out of left field but you may have seen that horrible video
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:26.760]  i almost lost my lunch over it with where a toronto cop is just shooting this mentally
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:31.240]  disturbed person who's called him a weenie or something from the bus i mean he shoots
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:35.920]  him from i don't know maybe eight ten yards away i've seen it keep shooting this i will
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:42.440]  guess what he's he's uh under charge for murder one so just because they get away from this
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:46.440]  don't get the idea that everybody's doing it there are some psychos look one more point
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:53.640]  for we go to the calls alex if you can can accept the possibility that some people like
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:59.960]  in that movie jack reager i make a lot of movie references and because they are a very
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:04.600]  powerful propaganda engine propaganda has a that's a bad connotation but it's a very
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:09.240]  influential jack reager in that tom cruise movie brought up the point that some people
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:15.600]  join the service as a legal method of killing people i am sure not all but some in the police
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:20.960]  departments have joined the police departments as a legal way to kill people if that's possible
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:27.080]  do you think it's also possible that politicians became politicians as a legal way of killing
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:32.040]  exactly they're just a cross section of the public but when more criminals get in then
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:36.040]  they recruit other criminals and that's called a tyranny and that's the point we've reached
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:40.400]  i'm alex jones john b wells is our uh guest here today we're going right to your phone
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:45.880]  calls his website is caravan to midnight dot com our sites are in fall wars dot com and
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:49.920]  prison planet dot com okay i'm going to quit hogging our guests robert in north dakota
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:55.400]  your question or comment go ahead you're on the air mr wells mr jones uh i'm an 82nd
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:59.480]  airborne division veteran and i want to tell you first off it is my honor to be able to
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:06.360]  speak with both of you uh... there are so many things going on right now i'm a serious
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:12.760]  student of bible prophecy and what i believe is going on right now is these people in this
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:18.280]  administration from everything from mubarak in egypt uh... everything all these things
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:22.200]  that you have mentioned they are trying to spark but the bible refers to as the war
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:28.920]  between god and may god everybody's asking well what can we do you both have brought
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:33.280]  up some very good points of the things we could do uh... i think one of the very first things
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:40.400]  that we need to do is as a nation we need to start praying because i believe that no
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:45.200]  matter what we try to physically do that some of this is going to go down because every
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:50.520]  bible prophecy that talks about the end times uh... it speaks about one particular verse
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:56.440]  talks about how overnight Damascus will be no more and the people's eyes will melt in
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:01.680]  their sockets and skin melt off their i know it's absolutely like somebody at a time machine
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:06.520]  and and and i understand that i agree i've told everybody now is the time to be praying
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:12.280]  right now let me get john b wells is taking what you just said got almighty invented everything
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:17.040]  i the lord create the light in the darkness i the lord create good and evil i the lord
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:22.400]  do all of these things he also told us people wait in Jerusalem until you're filled with
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:27.280]  just wait until you're filled with the holy spirit then you'll have the power to do it
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:35.280]  so yes and and and i gotta tell you i don't much care what people think about about all
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:39.440]  religious all right wing crazy christian it doesn't make a difference to me which is
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:45.240]  a in in that regard this universe did not burst into existence on its own it is totally
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:52.320]  impossible totally impossible it is more likely than that that fifty chimpanzees with typewriters
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:58.480]  wind up writing a shakespearean play that it is more likely for that to happen than
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:03.560]  for an ancient peoples and members of that ancient peoples thousands of years ago to
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:08.600]  write the things that they know exactly i feel sorry for people that are religious spiritually
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:13.160]  blind and cannot feel and see what's going on i mean we ought to feel sorry for these
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:17.640]  atheists and people they have no idea what's going on look at look what it says in the
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:23.400]  look at look at the look at the revelation sixteen three about the the oceans being poisoned
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:27.760]  the ocean is being poisoned and all these experts who are routinely baffled which means
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:34.320]  they're not experts they say all the radioactivity be concentrated in a certain area then it turned
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:38.640]  into all the radioactivity will be dispersed well it's not being dispersed at all and it
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:42.880]  is becoming more highly concentrated and guess what folks it said for the west coast
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:47.480]  absolutely i think it's here absolutely let's jam in one more before we go to break thank

[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:29.320]  right outside dais air force base were very close where they did commission thousands
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:34.400]  of nuclear warheads if you're a new listener the articles are in the most viewed section
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:38.080]  on the right hand side of them for words dot com i was told this by a high level source
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:42.800]  who was completely freaked out and now won't talk to me because of the nsa obviously i'm
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:48.560]  just gonna leave it at that and i've never in my gut been more concerned about a story
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:52.640]  but i don't know what i can do i've called dais like six seven times now we've recorded
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:56.240]  the interviews saying what about the weapons transfer they say they don't they don't have
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:01.240]  any comment they're gonna call us back we've talked to captains they never will it doesn't
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:05.040]  matter i'm way above captain i'm not even gonna affect i don't want to say any more
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:10.360]  to give it away the point is people were freaked out this was an illegal nuclear weapons transfer
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:15.560]  and who do you think we're gonna call when this stuff goes on they call us because they
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:22.280]  know we'll research it we'll put it out and i wish this source wasn't somebody that we
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:27.040]  hadn't confirmed it known for over a decade this isn't like somebody at the base giving
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:33.880]  me disinfo that's why it's so horrible uh and believe me folks this is a dangerous situation
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:38.040]  and and and it's way above my pay grade all i can do is tell you this is going on and
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:41.040]  you got lindsay gramm run around saying get ready to be nuked i wanted to have a bunch
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:45.160]  of calls in here at the end because you've been holding john b wells is our guest but
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:52.440]  that caller caller brought that up you know i've praised rush limbaugh glenbeck pat Buchanan
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:56.040]  ron paul ran paul some say well why are you praising rush limbaugh saying it could be
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:59.920]  a false flag because i'm not in competition with rush limbaugh folks i want to live in
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:04.680]  a free country and when he comes out and says it could be a frame up by obama that's a good
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:09.720]  thing i'm in this to win it it's not like we're all a bunch of failed revolutionaries
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:14.440]  and we can't restore the republican if people start agreeing with us it must mean there's
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:19.760]  some kind of trick no the trick is good people start feeling powerless so evil takes over
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:25.280]  when good men stand up that's when liberty reigns john b wells comments briefly on that
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:29.040]  well you said it all you said it all i would have rambled around all over the place that
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:34.080]  was very succinctly put nuts that's exactly correct the the other thing that alex about
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:38.760]  panthex the first time i heard about panthex some year ago some years ago was not that
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:43.840]  it was so where where they're decommissioned it was the final assembly point for nuclear
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:49.720]  weapons so recently yeah they do both yeah yeah they're gonna do both i'm thinking it's
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:54.200]  probably still the final assembly point for them i'm thinking that it's not a decommissioning
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:50:00.160]  area which makes the scenario look worse and joel scousen whom you've had on your program
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:06.440]  many times and he's been on coast to coast a m many times he is convinced and you know
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:10.320]  he if you if you can see him it's better than if you just hear him because he sounds real
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:17.640]  grumpy if you just hear him but he was like mr wells it's gonna happen and i'm like okay
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:23.480]  joel you must know something well it appears he does know something and i'm afraid we may
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:27.560]  see this now i don't want to spook a bunch of people i'm just saying don't worry about
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:35.360]  it too much hey nagasaki is a great party town now right wow yeah no it's i mean the
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:40.560]  people i talked to were so freaked out it is unbelievable yeah they should be freaked
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:49.760]  out and and and really what the ultimate agenda here it alex it is not beyond the the realm
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:55.520]  of the possible that there are some people who are trying to bring about bible prophecy
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:51:03.080]  and the end of the world lunatics let's talk let's talk to lee and canada thanks for holding
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:08.440]  the truth writer and others you're on the air go ahead mr groans mr wells i respect
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:13.880]  for you both i have a question and a point to make actually my question is while everybody
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:20.240]  is focusing in on syria uh i don't know if you guys know but you must in middle of october
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:26.920]  actually that feeling will be hit again um so i is it is it possible that this is kind
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:32.200]  of deterring from that also they have the femur drills going up in the northeast they have
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:38.960]  problems with well supposed supposed glitches and in mall street lately yeah there's a lot
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:43.140]  of spooky stuff going on and you look at these drills these are martial law takeover
[01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:48.160]  drills over five state areas john your take on that well what do you have to ask yourself
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:52.600]  the question what is it that would be the trigger point for these actions to be taken
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:59.080]  by the government what is it that would cause civil unrest well disaster financial collapse
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:05.240]  or some kind of deprivation whether it's a big spark in the middle east and so fuel prices
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:09.000]  up to twelve dollars a gallon it's already nine dollars a gallon european has been for
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.600]  a long time if you do the conversion on it so what happens then then the truckers go we
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:16.280]  can't haul this stuff for this kind of fuel price so what do they do they protest they
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:21.160]  pull their trucks over on the side of the road they sit there and camp out for two days
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:27.240]  and your grocery stores are empty then what pick a scenario there are a lot to choose
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:35.120]  from what we need to get to is what is the end game what is the ultimate goal of the
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:40.640]  agenda bring in global crisis so they can offer global governance and a new global currency
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:46.080]  as the solution that's it that's it create a big enough problem and we've got the big
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:49.520]  solution for you and you really don't have any choice but to go along with it because
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:53.640]  you're well and truly screwed if you don't go along with it well the majority of my military
[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:58.560]  contacts don't know what's going on with these warheads but they think it's as serious as
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:03.560]  I think it is they say their best estimate is it's some weird way to hold the east coast
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:09.720]  hostage and actually threaten congress but who knows it's bizarre let's talk to truth
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:18.840]  rater in Oregon you're on the air go ahead we supposed to be watching football not today
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:22.360]  I think maybe later tonight I might watch some I mean you gotta have a little relaxation
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:29.720]  or you'll go crazy indeed well I think this is basically a false flag diversion what's
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:35.920]  going on is something is going on that we haven't been able to touch on yet it's the realignment
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:41.280]  of the financial markets for example and other things that they're doing out there I agree
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:45.480]  they're raising interest rates and they're using the war to distract from that make drop
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:52.120]  bill back on the dollar yes indeed and everything else we don't really know about right now
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:57.200]  and then later on we're gonna find out well let me tell you they did not want me to learn
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:01.960]  about these warheads okay this comes from a long term I'm just I don't want to say too
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:06.760]  much they can figure out who it is they probably already have so I mean I didn't want this warhead
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:09.960]  news out but that's a good point John yeah what there's a lot of other stuff this is
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:15.080]  distracting from all the scandals Obamacare I was at Barton Springs today for those that
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:18.760]  don't know one of the biggest freshwater pools in the US and I had one of the head lifeguards
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:23.240]  walk over then I went and question other ones and they said you were right most people here
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:29.240]  voted for Obama so did I and I talked to another person they said well I didn't but everybody
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:34.680]  that had 40 hours a week they were all cut to 20 hours a week under Obamacare how do
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:41.000]  you like that well how many scandals do you need and what kind of what kind of a diversion
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.600]  do you need to distract our attention from them in other words I'm not going to claim
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:49.200]  to know the answers to these things I just see a lot of possibilities but when you have
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:52.920]  the Benghazi thing which was serious that was clearly about an arms deal I floated that
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:57.600]  opinion out on coast to coast AM then you got the IRS scandal targeting the Tea Party
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:02.160]  groups and conservative groups and you got the NSA spying scandal and you've got and
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:05.880]  you've got that that that kid that decided he wanted to be a girl I can't even call
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:11.200]  his name right now he just got 30 years for a turn those documents over WikiLeaks and
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:16.760]  then you've got this one D Manning yeah Manning then you got the NSA deal with with Edward
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:22.200]  Snowden and he looks awfully calm to me but he does not look he does not have that calm
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:28.320]  look of somebody who is bought paid for and protected sure look on his face of somebody
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:33.120]  who feels like he's done exactly the right thing then you've got the the attorney general
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:39.040]  suing states for enforcing border control while he's running guns down to Mexico and
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:44.200]  this guy's Teflon and shipping homeschoolers that fled Germany back to Germany where it's
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:48.880]  a felony let's jam in another call quickly Robert in North Carolina thanks for holding
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:59.840]  your on the air brother your phones breaking up now do you talk right into it oh can you
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:06.560]  okay can you hear me yeah real quick question go okay I wanted to know if you Williams was
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:12.480]  still right about them going into all your radio eventually and if that's so I don't
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:15.720]  think that they're really playing on using a bunch of nuclear weapons over there because
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:19.600]  they want the oil over there absolutely no sir we're not talking about nuclear weapons
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:23.640]  being used in the Middle East we're talking about conflict with Russia because Russia
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:30.120]  says they're going to back Syria militarily now okay well that makes sense by the by the
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:37.400]  way I speak this stuff in all the little churches I go to stuff like that and by the way I'm
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:42.120]  pretty pretty millennial but I didn't mean I have to lay down I still get told about
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:46.200]  all this absolutely regardless whether it's pre-tribulation or at whatever it doesn't matter
