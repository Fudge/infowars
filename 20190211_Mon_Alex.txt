[00:00.000 --> 00:21.680]  This past weekend you'll be surprised to hear that I was almost turned into alligator
[00:21.680 --> 00:22.680]  food.
[00:22.680 --> 00:23.680]  Why?
[00:23.680 --> 00:28.960]  Because an SJW zookeeper wanted to throw me into an alligator pit because he doesn't
[00:28.960 --> 00:30.840]  like my opinions.
[00:30.840 --> 00:31.840]  Very progressive.
[00:31.840 --> 00:42.320]  It would 5.30 is St. Augustine Mann losing his job after posting about a woman online.
[00:42.320 --> 00:46.480]  I mean this girl has no qualms about carrying a gun around her college campus just minutes
[00:46.480 --> 00:51.640]  after she graduates and you're gonna threaten her with alligators?
[00:51.640 --> 00:54.080]  Don't bring an alligator to a gunfight is all I'm saying.
[00:54.080 --> 00:58.360]  On Sunday I was at the alligator farm in St. Augustine, Florida with both my parents
[00:58.360 --> 01:04.160]  and fiance, committing the sinister crime of having a family vacation.
[01:04.160 --> 01:10.440]  I saw hundreds of alligators, crocodiles and snakes, but surprisingly the most dangerous
[01:10.440 --> 01:17.720]  animal at the alligator farm was on a reptile, but a social justice warrior.
[01:17.720 --> 01:22.520]  Little did I know it at the time, but one of the zookeepers at the alligator farm had
[01:22.520 --> 01:25.800]  intentions of murdering me in front of my family.
[01:25.800 --> 01:31.960]  Ethan Patterson, now a former employee of the alligator farm, went on Twitter two days
[01:31.960 --> 01:34.440]  after my visit to tweet this.
[01:34.440 --> 01:39.240]  I just want y'all to know that Kent State Gun Girl came to my place of work and it took
[01:39.240 --> 01:45.720]  everything in me not to push her over the railing into the mouths of 250 hungry alligators.
[01:45.720 --> 01:51.680]  Ethan learned the hard way that threatening to murder your customers is not the best way
[01:51.680 --> 01:52.680]  to keep your job.
[01:52.680 --> 01:57.800]  As soon as the alligator farm got wind of what he did, they filed a police report, fired
[01:57.800 --> 02:03.080]  him immediately and had him escorted off the property by the police.
[02:03.080 --> 02:05.160]  But the story doesn't end there.
[02:05.160 --> 02:12.760]  The director of the alligator farm, John Bruggan, invited me back for a free tour on Wednesday.
[02:12.760 --> 02:16.960]  He also told me about the conversation he had with Ethan when he fired him.
[02:16.960 --> 02:22.660]  He told Ethan it's not a good idea to threaten someone who advocates for gun rights because
[02:22.660 --> 02:27.760]  guess what, you're proving exactly why they advocate for gun rights.
[02:27.760 --> 02:30.640]  He provided some life advice to Ethan as well.
[02:30.640 --> 02:36.440]  He urged him to publicly apologize and move on from what he said so that maybe one day
[02:36.440 --> 02:38.360]  he can get a job somewhere else.
[02:38.360 --> 02:39.440]  But did Ethan listen?
[02:39.440 --> 02:42.440]  Of course not.
[02:42.440 --> 02:43.880]  What did Ethan do instead?
[02:43.880 --> 02:49.920]  He immediately went on Twitter to blame me for his termination instead of accepting responsibility.
[02:49.920 --> 02:53.960]  The funny part is, he thinks he's doing good for this world.
[02:53.960 --> 02:54.960]  What world?
[02:54.960 --> 02:59.560]  And not only is he claiming he never threatened me, but he's saying he didn't deserve to
[02:59.560 --> 03:05.120]  lose his job for saying it took everything in his body not to gruesomely murder a paying
[03:05.120 --> 03:06.120]  customer.
[03:06.120 --> 03:10.600]  Poor Ethan kept going and shared a tweet from someone who said the following, I am starting
[03:10.600 --> 03:15.240]  a GoFundMe for the zookeeper and also for a machine that will push the Kent State gun
[03:15.240 --> 03:17.400]  girl into the alligator pit.
[03:17.400 --> 03:22.160]  So even though the director of the alligator forum said that Ethan apologized a thousand
[03:22.160 --> 03:27.200]  times for what he had tweeted, it doesn't actually seem like he regrets anything at
[03:27.200 --> 03:28.200]  all.
[03:28.200 --> 03:32.400]  Hopefully Ethan will change his Twitter name from the alligator dude to the unemployed
[03:32.400 --> 03:33.400]  dude.
[03:33.400 --> 03:40.480]  Because with this story following him around, I doubt he will get another job.
[03:40.480 --> 03:45.040]  And hopefully the few leftists that actually have jobs will learn a valuable lesson from
[03:45.040 --> 03:46.040]  this experience.
[03:46.040 --> 03:50.680]  Threatening to kill your customers is not an effective way to keep your job.
[03:50.680 --> 03:55.280]  I'd like to thank John and the alligator forum for standing up for me and standing up for
[03:55.280 --> 03:56.280]  the second amendment.
[03:56.280 --> 04:00.800]  I hope if anybody watching goes on vacation in St. Augustine, you make the alligator
[04:00.800 --> 04:02.280]  forum your first stop.
[04:02.280 --> 04:07.000]  Honestly, when I saw Ethan's tweet, I was more concerned for the thousands of conservatives
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.680]  that might visit the alligator forum than I was for myself.
[04:10.680 --> 04:15.400]  In the back of my head, I was wondering if someone like Ethan might push a little boy
[04:15.400 --> 04:19.360]  into an alligator pit because he was wearing a MAGA hat on his head.
[04:19.360 --> 04:24.240]  If he wanted to kill a girl simply for expressing her second amendment rights, who knows what
[04:24.240 --> 04:27.160]  a psychopath like him might want to do to others.
[04:27.160 --> 04:31.240]  But thankfully, he won't have the opportunity to do that anymore.
[04:31.240 --> 04:32.960]  Goddamn right.

[06:20.700 --> 06:43.220]  It's Monday, February 11, 2019, I am your host, Alex Jones, thank you for joining us.
[06:43.220 --> 06:47.420]  A lot of you had to jump through hoops and really go through a lot of work, even find
[06:47.420 --> 06:53.660]  a radio station, listen to us on or you got to go directly to infowars.com or newswars.com
[06:53.660 --> 06:57.660]  to find our feeds that are amongst the most censored on the planet.
[06:57.660 --> 07:01.740]  So thank you so much for joining us today and thank you for spreading the word.
[07:01.740 --> 07:05.700]  Thank you for taking action because though we're censored and though we're outfunded
[07:05.700 --> 07:12.100]  by the globalist, a billion to one, the truth is explosive, the truth is powerful, the truth
[07:12.100 --> 07:17.980]  is unstoppable when people are willing to stand up and carry it forward.
[07:17.980 --> 07:24.740]  Now you know that Gallup and Rasmussen and other polls believe the Democratic Party is
[07:24.740 --> 07:33.420]  the dominant party in the US and so for more than 30 years they have always sampled more
[07:33.420 --> 07:42.660]  Democrats than they have Republicans on average about 15% more.
[07:42.660 --> 07:51.180]  CNN would do up to 35 to 37% more during the 2016 election, total fraud to create the illusion
[07:51.180 --> 07:53.660]  that Hillary was 20 points ahead.
[07:53.660 --> 08:02.460]  This is what they do, but despite all the propaganda in Gallup, Trump is at 52 and in
[08:02.460 --> 08:08.260]  Rasmussen, Trump is at 52.
[08:08.260 --> 08:14.820]  Think about that, that's over sampling on average 15 points more for Democrats.
[08:14.820 --> 08:23.700]  That means they call 15% more Democrats or contact 15% more Democrats for their poll
[08:23.700 --> 08:25.740]  and he's at 52%.
[08:25.740 --> 08:32.380]  That tells you he's really at like 65, 67, conservatively and that's why the Democrats
[08:32.380 --> 08:38.820]  and the globalists are getting more and more desperate because they know they're losing.
[08:38.820 --> 08:49.980]  Trump approval rating among likely voters soars to his best in 23 months, 52%.
[08:49.980 --> 08:56.380]  The problem is the globalists know that so they're getting ready to make their move and
[08:56.380 --> 09:00.060]  try to remove the president.
[09:00.060 --> 09:04.940]  A lot of the prosecutors have left the Mueller probe, they've made all the noises that it
[09:04.940 --> 09:07.980]  will be ending sometime in March.
[09:07.980 --> 09:14.660]  My dead reckoning is right around March 1st, but then they've got all the new criminal
[09:14.660 --> 09:21.860]  investigations that the Mueller dragnet was used for, ready, targeting hundreds of his
[09:21.860 --> 09:27.420]  associates for not crimes Trump's committed but income tax evasion, all these other things
[09:27.420 --> 09:35.020]  so that they will then turn against the president, so that they will then bear false witness
[09:35.020 --> 09:40.900]  like we've seen with Michael Cohen and others and that is the plan, drudgerport.com last
[09:40.900 --> 09:47.820]  night linked directly to our live feed as we broke all this down, live Sunday exclusive
[09:47.820 --> 09:53.620]  Mueller probe to end March 1st, New York DC and Chicago to announce criminal indictments
[09:53.620 --> 09:57.180]  of Trump organization after.
[09:57.180 --> 10:01.940]  That's the article that had our live feed last night, today's live feed points out that
[10:01.940 --> 10:09.060]  Democrats are set to introduce articles of impeachment today and are moving against
[10:09.060 --> 10:15.140]  the president as they panic that his approval rating is the highest it's ever been and a
[10:15.140 --> 10:22.100]  full five points ahead of Obama in similar polls by the same agencies when Obama was
[10:22.100 --> 10:26.940]  two years and two months into his presidency.
[10:26.940 --> 10:30.660]  So all the King's horses and all the King's men and all the propaganda and all the race
[10:30.660 --> 10:36.060]  spading and trying to plunge the economy and trying to discredit the election it hasn't
[10:36.060 --> 10:44.140]  worked and Trump when he was able to talk to people it was a seventy eight percent
[10:44.140 --> 10:49.740]  was it seventy seven percent in CBS poll and other polls were similar people are like this
[10:49.740 --> 10:56.100]  makes total sense and boy he really has delivered on much of what he said.
[10:56.100 --> 11:02.260]  And that just sent them into more of an insane rage and you've got Al Green about to introduce
[11:02.260 --> 11:12.020]  his articles of impeachment you've got Maxine Waters who is the most corrupt openly corrupt
[11:12.020 --> 11:16.500]  the people more corrupt than her but she's the most flagrantly corrupt if she does like
[11:16.500 --> 11:21.980]  broad day armed robberies basically is equivalent broad daylight high noon middle of a shopping
[11:21.980 --> 11:30.260]  center come in and rob robber jewelry shop that's a broad day crazy wearing your gun
[11:30.260 --> 11:38.420]  outside your vast wild town she gave her husband twelve million dollars directly in
[11:38.420 --> 11:44.340]  banker bailout money just in one scam there's the hill I mean this woman has been voted
[11:44.340 --> 11:50.780]  by watchdog groups the most corrupt member of Congress she doesn't give you know what
[11:50.780 --> 11:57.980]  a rat's behind but don't worry she's foaming at the mouth saying oh we're gonna get those
[11:57.980 --> 12:03.700]  tax returns because you see it's not about Russia gate that's all front it's about the
[12:03.700 --> 12:11.220]  dragnet and saying oh his daddy forty years ago started giving his money to his family
[12:11.220 --> 12:16.580]  that's what you do where it all goes inheritance tax none of the rich people painting inheritance
[12:16.580 --> 12:22.220]  tax when they die they all give it away to their families but making your own money that's
[12:22.220 --> 12:27.780]  not a good thing according to Maxine if you steal it for your corrupt husband that swindles
[12:27.780 --> 12:32.220]  banks and takes the money out the back door and then bankruptcy keeps for himself you've
[12:32.220 --> 12:38.460]  got five or six three four million dollar homes and private aircraft and everything else
[12:38.460 --> 12:44.500]  you go to Congress with nothing and you can't even get outside business lobbying deals to
[12:44.500 --> 12:50.140]  make it look like it's halfway legal you give it directly to your husband you you crook
[12:50.140 --> 12:56.980]  you crazy woman you devil so here here she is oh and she's on the banking committee in
[12:56.980 --> 13:02.340]  the house she says we're gonna bring back all the regulations so don't you bring those jobs
[13:02.340 --> 13:08.500]  back to America after we play this clip the really big news that ties into all of us we're
[13:08.500 --> 13:32.420]  gonna be detailing after the break but right now let's go to mad Maxine Houston the projector
[13:32.420 --> 13:42.220]  has landed that is the greatest case of projection I have ever seen someone that lies someone
[13:42.220 --> 13:48.620]  that steals that's that's the definition that should be on Maxine waters tombstone someday
[13:48.620 --> 13:54.740]  when she lives a long evil life so we'll be covering that we come back in the plan to
[13:54.740 --> 14:03.460]  launch the next wave Russia gates gonna fade into the mist and then all the spying and
[14:03.460 --> 14:08.780]  all the persecution Muller's the one that recommended the whole prosecution of Cohen
[14:08.780 --> 14:14.300]  the rat in New York to the southern district nothing new with Russia and now they've used
[14:14.300 --> 14:19.740]  the illegal spying and the warrants and all of it to go around and find some juicy local
[14:19.740 --> 14:27.540]  hanging fruit to go after but don't worry while that's happening for more giant caravans
[14:27.540 --> 14:33.260]  are already making their way up for Mexico and the UN bases in Guatemala and Honduras
[14:33.260 --> 14:39.820]  are massing hundreds of thousands more to break the border so the immigration judges
[14:39.820 --> 14:43.620]  are overwhelmed what is Trump supposed to do he hasn't been able to change the laws
[14:43.620 --> 14:50.140]  yet show 2000 people a day on average are we're just released here just go we hold a couple
[14:50.140 --> 14:56.740]  days more coming in we just go just go breaking our border oh but the TSA is gonna stick their
[14:56.740 --> 15:02.420]  hands down veterans pants I was in the news that triple amputee they basically strip
[15:02.420 --> 15:08.100]  searched in public oh and don't worry we're gonna have internal checkpoints and don't
[15:08.100 --> 15:12.460]  wear everything you do is gonna be tracked but we can't check anybody coming in Gallup
[15:12.460 --> 15:18.260]  has done a central and South American poll five million Latin Americans intend to come
[15:18.260 --> 15:24.260]  to the U.S. this year they say they're coming and they're eyeing how to get here but don't
[15:24.260 --> 15:29.660]  worry the Democrats wall deal 62 limit ISIS ability to house criminal illegal immigrants
[15:29.660 --> 15:40.620]  to 16,500 to give you an idea there's three million people in prison so 16,500 period
[15:40.620 --> 15:44.980]  illegal aliens can be held and so that matter if you're a rapist or a murder you're going
[15:44.980 --> 15:48.500]  to be released so that's the total breaking of our border with the Democrats quarterbacking
[15:48.500 --> 15:54.220]  the complete collapse of the United States under agenda 21 and the UN treaty the truck
[15:54.220 --> 16:00.420]  pulled out of but they don't care they're rampaging forward most of you know that heart

[20:19.620 --> 20:29.180]  lines of the info war history is happening right in front of us the united states and
[20:29.180 --> 20:35.460]  europe are openly under globalist attack from enemies within and without orchestrated the
[20:35.460 --> 20:41.180]  collapse of the third world and they were now bringing those populations in to drive
[20:41.180 --> 20:47.020]  down wages and create a permanent underclass they control the globalist are pant panicking
[20:47.020 --> 20:52.300]  though because from australia to europe's united states nationalist populist leaders
[20:52.300 --> 20:58.380]  are being elected and are wildly popular trump even in fake skewed polls has the highest
[20:58.380 --> 21:04.460]  rasmussen ever recorded from him and it's five points above what obama had at a similar
[21:04.460 --> 21:11.860]  time two years in his administration and then you have the incredible imagery of four huge
[21:11.860 --> 21:17.660]  caravans tens of thousands of peace funded by the u.n. marching towards the u.s. and
[21:17.660 --> 21:24.940]  this announcement gallup poll of central and south americans a giant study five million
[21:24.940 --> 21:31.220]  latin americans coming to the u.s. this year in their own announcements forty two million
[21:31.220 --> 21:36.220]  seekers of citizenship or asylum are watching to determine exactly when and how it's best
[21:36.220 --> 21:40.540]  time to make the move to suggest that open borders could potentially attract forty two
[21:40.540 --> 21:45.180]  million latin americans a full five million who are already planning to move the next
[21:45.180 --> 21:51.780]  twelve months say they're moving to the united states that is main stream news ladies and
[21:51.780 --> 21:57.260]  gentlemen that is directly what they're announcing and then meanwhile senator graham democrats
[21:57.260 --> 22:05.220]  want to reduce bed space for violent offenders at the u.s. border and internally to only sixteen
[22:05.220 --> 22:09.860]  thousand five hundred others three million people in prison trumps trying to let the
[22:09.860 --> 22:14.900]  nonviolence out because he knows this is the globalist assault just like europe they get
[22:14.900 --> 22:19.900]  a few hundred thousand and then it's fifteen million and then it's the collapse of society
[22:19.900 --> 22:25.100]  because the people literally are beyond country bumpkins from north africa the middle east
[22:25.100 --> 22:30.940]  of the areas they don't know anything they're the lowest iq of those areas they are many
[22:30.940 --> 22:35.660]  most of them are men a lot of them are criminals a lot of them are mentally ill it is the worst
[22:35.660 --> 22:42.260]  the worst basically africa the middle east and latin america are defecating into a toilet
[22:42.260 --> 22:49.580]  known as the united states they're very worse and imagine trumps says i'll give you docca
[22:49.580 --> 22:53.180]  for anybody that can prove that they're not a criminal and been here for twenty years
[22:53.180 --> 23:00.260]  or they were brought here by by legal parents will just make them citizens no no we want
[23:00.260 --> 23:08.140]  totally open borders no borders no wall no usa at all and now democrats say you are not
[23:08.140 --> 23:15.820]  even allowed to check for diseases or find who they are you are to load them on to democrat
[23:15.820 --> 23:21.980]  buses and they disappear even the senate report four years ago said that hundreds of thousands
[23:21.980 --> 23:26.220]  of children came to the u.s. below the age of seventeen and that thousands ended up in
[23:26.220 --> 23:33.100]  sex trafficking hundreds dead under obama you just have totally open borders and then
[23:33.100 --> 23:37.580]  you just let people in a son article today about a triple amputee veteran both legs
[23:37.580 --> 23:45.660]  and one arm in public having them stick their hands down his pants into his you name it
[23:45.660 --> 23:52.580]  and again i'm not even saying tsa itself are bad people but you've got checkpoints inside
[23:52.580 --> 23:56.020]  the country that violate the fourth amendment but you can't have them on the border where
[23:56.020 --> 24:00.740]  it's under the constitution and then the president lets them shut the government down instead
[24:00.740 --> 24:08.460]  of declaring an emergency he's finally getting to that point as we told you he would he was
[24:08.460 --> 24:14.260]  planning it but then back down so this is just incredible information shameful and disgraceful
[24:14.260 --> 24:21.980]  tsa slam for evasive grope of triple amputee us veteran i love it when they're doing it
[24:21.980 --> 24:28.620]  to a veteran and it's a muslim oh by the way of this muslim woman member of congress retweeting
[24:28.620 --> 24:33.380]  stuff about jews having hook noses and jews and their money grubbing and how they run
[24:33.380 --> 24:38.940]  everything and all this stuff at first a democrats defender now they aren't what do you think
[24:38.940 --> 24:44.900]  happens when you bring in hardcore samalis and other people who kill everyone who isn't
[24:44.900 --> 24:49.740]  muslim in their country and sell women on slave blocks what do you think happens when
[24:49.740 --> 24:56.220]  you bring in islamics who don't let any christians or anybody else live in their countries it's
[24:56.220 --> 25:04.700]  like dropping a baby into a backyard with 14 pit bulls with with rabies or something islam
[25:04.700 --> 25:11.940]  is not compatible with the west period and so of course this woman tweeted lies about
[25:11.940 --> 25:18.380]  the covington young people and said that they were scum that they were chanting uh you know

[25:50.060 --> 25:59.340]  in the jews all day unbelievable ladies and gentlemen but what do you think you do if
[25:59.340 --> 26:05.300]  you go to the amazon and start slicing your legs up and jump into a pet of piranhas the

[33:49.460 --> 33:55.260]  mexico border mexico is now capitulating saying they're going to build un refugee bases in
[33:55.260 --> 34:01.220]  northern mexico so those are the resupply zones and the un uh with us taxpayer money
[34:01.220 --> 34:07.420]  through us a id who's that's given to soros he then skims off the top like carlo slim
[34:07.420 --> 34:11.540]  skimmed off the top of the obama phones and made it three billion dollars which he then
[34:11.540 --> 34:15.900]  laundered back through the new york times remember that that was the deal to do that
[34:15.900 --> 34:20.620]  obama gives him the obama phone contract for five years six years uh it costs fifteen
[34:20.620 --> 34:25.540]  billion dollars he makes three billion profit he launders a billion of the three billion
[34:25.540 --> 34:30.340]  he makes back through the new york times criminal operation so money talks bs walks
[34:30.340 --> 34:36.940]  you can't touch my three like bucks quote sammy haygar so that's how that works uh and
[34:36.940 --> 34:43.940]  so now this giant invasion force has announced five million people are coming four new caravans
[34:43.940 --> 34:50.900]  are here two thousand plus are released today because they're not enough beds there's over
[34:50.900 --> 34:58.300]  a hundred thousand beds democrats want to cut to sixteen thousand five hundred when tens
[34:58.300 --> 35:02.460]  of thousands are arriving a day that matter you're a child molester that matter you've
[35:02.460 --> 35:07.220]  got tb that matter you've been deported five times that matter you're a known serial killer
[35:07.220 --> 35:13.700]  we're going to release you we're going to break that border now we're going to uh get
[35:13.700 --> 35:17.980]  to this in the plan to remove trump from office we've been breaking down a moment but earlier
[35:17.980 --> 35:24.100]  i didn't properly plug uh the special we've got going right now so i'm going to do it
[35:24.100 --> 35:31.220]  right now for you ladies and gentlemen we set out with brain force plus about four years
[35:31.220 --> 35:35.860]  ago i said why are we going to all these top firms and all these top research groups and
[35:35.860 --> 35:41.620]  paying all this money try to figure out what the best cleanest new tropic is go to all
[35:41.620 --> 35:46.580]  the top publications go to all the top studies look at who the top three or four sellers are
[35:46.580 --> 35:50.420]  then look at their product reviews look at their ingredients have experts check those
[35:50.420 --> 35:55.500]  then go out and find a top lab source our product even better and then kind of fuse
[35:55.500 --> 35:59.940]  the best products that are out there and make it stronger for a lower price that's my philosophy
[35:59.940 --> 36:07.140]  at market research don't reinvent the wheel just make it better so that's what we've done
[36:07.140 --> 36:15.140]  brain force plus is very popular at 2995 normally discounted from uh 3995 right now you can get
[36:15.140 --> 36:21.540]  it for 1995 those supplies are limited again normally 2995 look at all those five stars
[36:22.820 --> 36:28.100]  but if you get it in the you know what let's just stop right there let's stop because i'm
[36:28.100 --> 36:32.740]  going to start over we're not going to show any images of the of the stuff on screen i'm just
[36:32.740 --> 36:37.300]  going to because i the problem is people think i'm directing the show i'm not really and i'm just
[36:37.300 --> 36:41.300]  going to start over right now and i'm going to talk about this for everybody right now and we'll
[36:41.300 --> 36:45.780]  put it in post it's what i'm doing right now is i'm cutting an ad so we can fund the operation
[36:45.780 --> 36:51.060]  i'm so busy i don't do this in post when we're not live i'm doing it live on air right now
[36:51.060 --> 36:56.980]  so no videos thank you very much okay now i'm going to start over here in just a moment then i'm
[36:56.980 --> 37:00.180]  going to get back into the news we're going to fund our operation and i'm going to tell you
[37:00.180 --> 37:07.460]  about how amazing this product is live here on air here in t minus five seconds because it really
[37:07.460 --> 37:14.660]  is amazing i'm very very proud of it brain force plus that we have been selling for about four years
[37:14.660 --> 37:20.660]  is overall our best-selling it isn't our biggest profit center because it has a very very low profit
[37:20.660 --> 37:25.300]  margin because that is my philosophy i want to give you a great product that is very very
[37:25.300 --> 37:29.780]  affordable so that you love it it works good and then you habituate buying it that's just my
[37:29.780 --> 37:34.100]  philosophy i didn't go to school for marketing i treat you like i want to be treated that's the
[37:34.100 --> 37:39.540]  type of product i get that is the best price the best product and that then funds a good cause as
[37:39.540 --> 37:46.100]  well so again brain force plus is our overall best-selling product it is not our most profitable
[37:46.100 --> 37:51.380]  product because there's not a lot of profit in it but it is basically in many cases a lost leader
[37:51.380 --> 37:56.340]  at 39.95 it is already better than leading competitors we just went out looked at the
[37:56.340 --> 38:03.380]  top three best-selling neutropics or brain pills and i then decided to basically soup it up but
[38:03.380 --> 38:09.060]  have it for a lower price and fuse those three different formulas together now right now it's
[38:09.060 --> 38:15.220]  it's normal 25 percent off 29.95 it's a great deal a lot of product in there but if you get it with
[38:15.220 --> 38:20.980]  our newest product turbo force that is beyond a pre-workout beyond a clean energy drink uh
[38:20.980 --> 38:27.300]  beyond any of that it's just total energy with all the amino acids and cofactors and
[38:28.020 --> 38:34.580]  with the vitamins the minerals to upload it it's 50 off so it's 50 off when you get brain force plush
[38:35.780 --> 38:42.660]  with our newest product turbo force the two go together turbo force is 33 off in the combo
[38:42.660 --> 38:46.420]  and i want you to experience these two products together i recommend though you stick your
[38:46.420 --> 38:54.820]  toe in the water uh and i recommend that you not uh you know take a full packet of turbo force
[38:54.820 --> 39:00.580]  the first time you do it because it's that strong and most people get up to 10 hours of clean burning
[39:00.580 --> 39:05.220]  energy from this there's nothing like it so just like we did incredible research on brain force plus
[39:05.220 --> 39:10.820]  turbo force had the same amount of research and we believe it is the best pre-workout total energy
[39:10.820 --> 39:17.700]  throughout the day uh thing there is but it's for the body parts for the brain uh this other product
[39:17.700 --> 39:23.540]  is mainly for the brain and it's the biggest special ever on these products together but it's
[39:23.540 --> 39:28.340]  key to understand i have to end the sale this weekend because we are selling out at this current
[39:28.340 --> 39:32.980]  rate of brain force because the special is so successful so please take advantage of that today
[39:32.980 --> 39:38.340]  and info warslife.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine and is your purchase
[39:38.340 --> 39:43.060]  other products that obviously make the entire operation possible thank you very much okay now
[39:43.060 --> 39:48.260]  let's move on to the total invasion and total attack of the united states you know that's what's
[39:48.260 --> 39:55.940]  happening and that's what's so amazing and so incredible about all of this is that this is
[39:55.940 --> 40:03.220]  really happening and i'm the weirdo because i'm concerned and i'm upset about this i'm the weirdo
[40:03.220 --> 40:08.820]  because i'm informed and really care about the issues you're the weirdo because you're informed
[40:08.820 --> 40:16.340]  and cared the un with traders in our government is engineering a takedown of our country and our
[40:16.340 --> 40:23.140]  nation under the un no borders no walls no usa at all and that's their plan and it's being done bigger
[40:23.140 --> 40:29.540]  than dallas right in front of our faces and our embattled president is then surrounded by a bunch
[40:29.540 --> 40:39.540]  of lying criminals like alexandria cortez or aoc who just says everything's free everything's wonderful
[40:39.540 --> 40:44.100]  get rid of airplanes you don't want to work you don't have to work i mean this is just the the
[40:44.100 --> 40:53.700]  absolute beyond communism this is just con artist level method brainwashing that you get from the
[40:53.700 --> 41:01.220]  permanent demon class that we've set up and established here in this nation so we're going to
[41:01.220 --> 41:08.900]  be looking at that when we come back from break we're going to be looking at the plan to remove
[41:08.900 --> 41:17.620]  president trump from office not from russia gate but by targeting his not the center circle but anyone
[41:17.620 --> 41:26.020]  he's connected to with non-russia related tax evasion you name it that's the live monday broadcast
[41:26.020 --> 41:32.100]  democrats introduce articles of impeachment prepare criminal indictments against 45 and co
[41:32.740 --> 41:37.860]  that's where this is going this country isn't going into a civil war it's in a civil war
[41:39.140 --> 41:46.500]  when mainline groups and mainline activists are all having their chase banks taken away
[41:46.500 --> 41:53.060]  and their wells fargo taken away and their paypal taken away and their square cash taken away the
[41:53.060 --> 41:57.700]  jack dorsi owns it's happening to everybody it's a message shut out and shut up or you're not
[41:57.700 --> 42:03.220]  allowed to be in commerce because as a political movement and group we're coming after you and
[42:03.220 --> 42:10.740]  the republicans do nothing the republican party when this is obvious criminal racketeering absolutely
[42:10.740 --> 42:16.900]  out of control they're so paralyzed they do nothing trump's giving lip service to it so as much as i
[42:16.900 --> 42:21.380]  support the president because he's a good guy and cares about the nation is under attack it doesn't
[42:21.380 --> 42:29.060]  matter if he won't now stop stuff that's never happened in this country imagine if if democrats
[42:29.060 --> 42:33.940]  were being told you can't use bank accounts or or we've got a report coming up the third hour
[42:33.940 --> 42:39.860]  where now hundreds of prominent people try to go get an uber an uber says because you're a
[42:39.860 --> 42:46.580]  conservative you can't ride in our cars this is horrible bullying mafia techniques by the democrats
[42:46.580 --> 42:51.060]  and nothing's being done to stop it and they've been testing and pushing and getting away with more
[42:51.060 --> 42:55.780]  and more they've been getting away with it and so now they're green lit to go wild this country

[46:07.700 --> 46:11.380]  our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper it consists
[46:11.380 --> 46:15.540]  of the things that we're willing to fight for the first amendment the bill of rights the rest of
[46:15.540 --> 46:21.300]  the bill of rights are prohibitions they're prohibitions against powerful organizations
[46:21.300 --> 46:26.260]  and individuals taking those god-given rights from us as individuals you better understand
[46:26.260 --> 46:33.620]  that because they're taking them right now we have seen what they want to do they called it
[46:33.620 --> 46:39.860]  unagenda 21 now they call it the un 2030 agenda they want everybody off of the rural lands they
[46:39.860 --> 46:45.220]  want people out of the suburbs they want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where
[46:45.220 --> 46:51.700]  it is easiest for them to control everyone it's the david night show never missed your show
[46:51.700 --> 46:59.780]  any day edit force dot com forward slash show
[46:59.780 --> 47:19.860]  show you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:30.180 --> 47:39.540]  this is no joke and it's an article you need to get out to people the globalists just
[47:39.540 --> 47:45.220]  attend to overrun us wear us out before you just get overwhelmed and give up and go into
[47:45.220 --> 47:52.420]  a fetal position this is a news wars dot com article it links directly to the state
[47:52.420 --> 48:00.500]  law they're trying to pass new jersey is is is expected to enact a rain tax
[48:01.060 --> 48:07.780]  enforced on property owners that's the headline news wars dot com new jersey to enact rain tax
[48:09.060 --> 48:15.940]  democrat governor phil murphy is preparing to sign the bill that will allow the state's
[48:15.940 --> 48:24.180]  565 municipalities to literally tax the rain by charging property owners a fee for their parking
[48:24.180 --> 48:32.260]  lots and driveways and any other surface rainwater can't penetrate great idea put a tax on building
[48:32.260 --> 48:37.860]  that'll drive people out even faster every time you think there's nothing left to tax we come up
[48:37.860 --> 48:46.020]  with something else said assemblyman howl we're this of sessics during a debate on the bill it's
[48:46.020 --> 48:52.580]  just never ending down here actually the un under its carbon tax taxes carbon dioxide that plants
[48:52.580 --> 48:58.500]  then respirate from and put out oxygen so that's a tax on air lawmakers who supported the bill
[48:59.140 --> 49:04.420]  claim revenue generated by the new tax bill will be used to upgrade the state storm water runoff
[49:04.420 --> 49:10.580]  systems although some predicted the new revenue will be redirected to another unrelated purpose
[49:10.580 --> 49:17.220]  for one thing the state has already claimed five percent of the revenue under the law the utilities
[49:17.220 --> 49:23.700]  can levy steep fees on properties with large parking lots long driveways or tall buildings
[49:24.820 --> 49:30.100]  which create the most runoff reported the new york post they can already have that in austin
[49:30.100 --> 49:35.220]  taxes for the supervious cover taxes the state is already prohibitively expensive for the middle
[49:35.220 --> 49:41.060]  class more people have fled new jersey than the other state 2018 being the tax could have the
[49:41.060 --> 49:46.660]  unintended consequence of lowering the tax base by forcing even more people to leave it goes on
[49:46.660 --> 49:51.620]  from there yeah i can't tell you how many people i meet in austin from new jersey here's the good
[49:51.620 --> 50:00.980]  news though almost every californian i meet is mad i have a big truck an f-150 they're mad if they
[50:00.980 --> 50:07.220]  see me get out of my vehicle going even into a shooting range they're mad that i've got four
[50:07.220 --> 50:12.740]  kids they'll come over confront you that's too many kids they want to bring in california they
[50:12.740 --> 50:18.740]  don't know why they left folks of me from new jersey are like oh my god we're so glad to be here
[50:18.740 --> 50:24.340]  what communist we're so scared though is the state going to turn blue where else can we run alex
[50:25.620 --> 50:31.060]  every time i go to the mall or out it seems like somebody from new jersey or michigan
[50:31.860 --> 50:36.820]  or michigan it's like alex are they gonna do it here we we love it please
[50:39.220 --> 50:45.300]  so folks from new jersey seem to see they're the refugees though i guess the folks staying in
[50:45.300 --> 51:00.500]  new jersey at least like what they've done okay i talked about this a lot last night i spent an
[51:00.500 --> 51:05.540]  hour and 15 minutes of the two hour sunday show every sunday four to six p.m on this subject
[51:07.860 --> 51:13.780]  and it's so surreal that it's happening that i personally even have trouble believing it but it
[51:13.780 --> 51:21.700]  is and the sunday show is worth emailing out it's worth tweeting it's worth facebooking
[51:21.700 --> 51:26.820]  it's worth sharing um it's it's it's still posts on info wars dot com
[51:27.620 --> 51:33.620]  muller probed in march 1st new york dc chicago to announce criminal indictments of trump organization
[51:33.620 --> 51:40.420]  after it's on news wars dot com as well you know they hadn't been censoring news wars as much as
[51:40.420 --> 51:46.260]  it was in info wars on twitter and facebook but they did ban a fan page that had a lot of a couple
[51:46.260 --> 51:53.700]  hundred thousand followers and millions of views a week on facebook saying well it's it's basically
[51:53.700 --> 51:58.820]  criminal activity recidivism is the word they used last week they said nothing can have the
[51:58.820 --> 52:03.380]  name news wars or info wars in it so but for now at least on some other platforms they're not
[52:03.380 --> 52:07.860]  censoring it like info wars you might want to send our articles out from news wars and news wars
[52:07.860 --> 52:15.700]  has been exploding in popularity only two of the pages were actually loosely affiliated with us so
[52:15.700 --> 52:21.380]  again as citizens how dare you actually let people hear what alex jones said
[52:23.620 --> 52:30.740]  we're just going to shut him down so we can then lie about him and a new phenomenon is youtube videos
[52:30.740 --> 52:36.020]  using washed up hollywood stars saying we must stop the white supremacist alex jones
[52:36.020 --> 52:42.100]  and i've shown it to lawyers they go yeah no that's a slam dunk case two years it'll cost
[52:42.100 --> 52:46.180]  a half million dollars but you'll win and they'll probably settle in six months you want to do it
[52:46.980 --> 52:51.380]  and i just here's the deal there's so many lawsuits i've got set up that are that are slam dunks
[52:53.140 --> 52:55.300]  i've just got to pick a couple of them and launch them
[52:58.900 --> 53:03.220]  i've just got to i've just got to do it and i've got to start sending the letters out too
[53:03.220 --> 53:10.740]  just so let them know that hey uh you need to stop because there's nothing like being tied
[53:10.740 --> 53:16.180]  up in the corner where yes our key audience knows what's going on you're awesome you're better than
[53:16.180 --> 53:23.540]  ever but in the general world the authoritarian left is set it up where they can lie about you
[53:23.540 --> 53:32.900]  with impunity and you can't say a word it is so cowardly it is so dastardly it is so ridiculous
[53:32.900 --> 53:38.820]  and it's just unprecedented and before i have this next piece of news i just can't believe that the
[53:38.820 --> 53:44.820]  republican party have congressmen and women being blocked on facebook and twitter when something
[53:44.820 --> 53:50.740]  goes viral and republican spokespersons are being banned or blocked and then google and facebook
[53:50.740 --> 53:55.380]  always goes oh we're sorry it was an accident we're gonna stop doing it and they're just doing it to
[53:55.380 --> 54:01.700]  everyone in mass they're surveilling everyone illegally in fact that was in yesterday's stack
[54:01.700 --> 54:08.900]  and i didn't get to it well you guys dig through this this stack it's over here during the next
[54:08.900 --> 54:15.060]  break and find me that whole stack in there in the strata the sub stack in the stack where it's
[54:15.060 --> 54:21.140]  like google reaches deal with russia to censor thousands of websites uh google reaches deal
[54:21.140 --> 54:29.300]  with saudi arabia google reaches deal with china apple reaches deal with saudi arabia to track women
[54:29.300 --> 54:35.300]  in live time to see if they're driving by themselves to call the police where's the feminist groups you
[54:35.300 --> 54:42.980]  know it's like well tim cooks gay and tim cook you know goes to the adl and gives speeches so
[54:43.780 --> 54:49.220]  everything's okay let's not talk bad about tim cook and that's it
[54:52.100 --> 54:56.500]  and then you got congress yeah i forgot that pressures tech companies to ban more accounts
[54:56.500 --> 55:04.340]  that was back in july last year the next month i was banned that print me that so so congress acts
[55:04.340 --> 55:07.860]  like they don't know what's going on the democrats are having hearings in front of republicans going
[55:07.860 --> 55:13.220]  i want alex jones band i want paul watson band i want this band then they misrepresent what we say
[55:13.220 --> 55:20.580]  then we get banned the next month and then a month later twitter and all of them are and are all in
[55:20.580 --> 55:26.740]  there live and facebook and hearings saying we never censored anybody and then much later google's
[55:26.740 --> 55:34.580]  they're directly lying to congress just doing it and they put up with it they roll over to it
[55:37.700 --> 55:40.260]  you've got all bloodthirsty and evil and corrupt
[55:40.260 --> 55:51.540]  silicon valley is and how instacart set up a scam where they take the vast majority of your tip
[55:51.540 --> 55:56.340]  and they don't even pay you and so people don't know that the person is not being paid and then
[55:56.340 --> 56:01.460]  and then the bigger the tip the more money instacart takes out of it you're like wow they're that low
[56:01.460 --> 56:09.140]  yes silicon valley is bottomless it has no bottom and it calls itself the left and they all
[56:09.140 --> 56:14.980]  effeminate around as their camouflage so they've learned not go we're big tough you know corrupt
[56:14.980 --> 56:19.540]  men we're usurping it people organize they've learned through psychological warfare to go
[56:23.140 --> 56:28.500]  jeff dezos and they pay no tax they're all subsidized by the government they're totally ruthless
[56:30.500 --> 56:35.060]  they've got their own private airports and underground bunkers and compounds all over the
[56:35.060 --> 56:40.260]  world and they believe humanity's obsolete they're going to merge with machines so i didn't get to

[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:44.980]  For a long, long
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.980]  On a winter's day
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:48.980]  On a winter's day
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.980]  If I didn't tell her

[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.980]  California
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.980]  I sought your winter's day
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.980]  California
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.980]  I sought your winter's day
[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:08.980]  California
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:10.980]  R油
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.980]  I sought your winter's day
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:21.980]  California
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:22.980]  suffering
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:23.980]  living
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:25.980]  I took your winter's day
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:26.980]  California
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:27.980]  Romy
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.980]  You won't touch your winter's day
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.980]  California
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:33.980]  I taught you winter's day
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:34.980]  California
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:35.980]  Remy
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:44.720]  But if you can get through all that to explore what he has been saying to see for yourself
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:50.520]  what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you, then the information you find
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.240]  could be life changing.
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.240]  He predicted 9-11.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:59.720]  And if there was an outside threat like a bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s,
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:03.280]  he's the boogeyman they need, and this Orwellian phony system.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:07.780]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony in Bohemian Grove.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:19.540]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and the modern globalist prison
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:23.380]  planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks.
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:26.620]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg group at all.
[01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:31.220]  And most of you are a bunch of stinking parasites!
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:36.140]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:39.140]  Valley.
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:43.060]  They falsely edited him.
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:47.100]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:51.980]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:59.460]  And now he is being de-platformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:04.060]  These companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:07.900]  And then we get hit and say, you don't want to use our software.
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:10.740]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.140]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:13.740]  They just killed our stream.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:14.740]  Really?
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:15.740]  Yep.
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:19.540]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:22.340]  This is America in 2018.
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:31.300]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:35.780]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded?
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:37.780]  Will you sit and do nothing?
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:46.140]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:10:15.380]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:20.940]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:22.940]  And we are back.
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:29.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Monday, February 11, 2019,
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:30.060]  World Wide Broadcast.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:35.180]  Mr. Man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River, she's a gold.
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:44.940]  I wanted to go over some facts here because Congress knows what they're doing.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:49.860]  It's part of a global government plan and they know that Americans are being censored.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:52.540]  They know conservatives and Christians are being censored.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:57.620]  And the Republican leadership has been bought off by Big Tech on the globalist.
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:05.220]  And so they're playing along with resisting all this, except for maybe Louis Gohmert and
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:09.660]  Devin Nunes and Jordan and a few others.
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:13.180]  They're playing along and they're allowing all this to happen.
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:16.900]  So I'm going to hit two big subjects, this segment and the next, and I'm going to give
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:20.500]  the number out to join us on air.
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:25.060]  And that's the total censorship going on that's admitted by Silicon Valley, working with China
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:35.460]  and others, and Google and Facebook and Apple, tailoring censorship for Islamic needs, communist
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:38.340]  needs, corporate American needs, whatever you want.
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:43.060]  And then having hearings where they say it doesn't exist.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:48.460]  The truth is the biggest lobbyist on Capitol Hill is Silicon Valley, even above and beyond
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:50.420]  the Defense Department.
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:55.260]  And so this is the sellout, the takedown of society.
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.860]  Last year in July, they said, take Alex Jones off.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:59.900]  And a month later, I was taken off.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:06.540]  Do those very same people give press conferences saying there is no censorship?
[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:09.220]  It doesn't exist.
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:14.020]  It's all part of a demoralization where you know what you've seen, but they just tell
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:15.020]  you it didn't happen.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:18.220]  So here's what's happening.
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:20.860]  They were illegally spying on Trump throughout the campaign.
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:24.700]  They launched the fake Russia investigation once Trump became president-elect to cover
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:30.660]  up that illegal investigation and to open new ones up to discredit the election and to
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:36.420]  then get a drag net out to find dirt on Trump associates, not associated with Russia, but
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:39.900]  on income taxes and things like that.
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:44.380]  And they can take regular tax attorney stuff and regular things that law firms say you
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:50.980]  can do, and that's in the tax law, and they can convince a jury of 12 morons that you've
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:52.900]  committed a crime.
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:53.900]  That's how this works.
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:56.140]  That's how they do it.
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:59.900]  And so now they're going to end the Russia investigation from all the inside intel I've
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:00.900]  got.
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:04.260]  Now, I told you Trump was going to declare an emergency a month ago, and he didn't.
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.260]  Now he's about to do it.
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:09.980]  I told you about it before it was even being discussed, so I'm giving you accurate info.
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:13.580]  I just don't know exactly how it's going to play out.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:20.020]  But when that comes to dates and times, I'll give you a dead reckoning and sources.
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:26.780]  But in the first week of March, they're going to put out the Mueller report.
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:33.100]  And it was the cover to discredit the election, to cover up the illegal spying before.
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:37.740]  But most importantly, to use that investigation and then refer things that Mueller found with
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:44.140]  all the wiretaps and spying that wasn't Russia related to other U.S. attorneys, like the Southern
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:50.380]  District of New York or Chicago, Illinois, or the District of Columbia, where they control
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:56.180]  the judges, and where they control the juries, or where they control the grand juries.
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:00.700]  So you're going to see out of Chicago, out of New York City, and out of the District
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:06.460]  of Criminals, D.C., a three-pronged attack, and probably some other ones as well.
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:07.740]  But those are the three we know about.
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:09.580]  And none of it will have to do with Russia.
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:13.220]  Sure, Schiff will keep something going in the House, he'll just share a committee.
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:19.380]  He'll keep that canard going as well, so that when they finally have the impeachment, they
[01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:23.620]  can throw in some Russiagate stuff to remove Pence as well.
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.020]  Then you get President Pelosi.
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.020]  So that's the plan.
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.020]  That's why you've got Elizabeth Warren.
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:30.980]  Let's play a clip of Elizabeth Warren.
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:36.980]  Here she is this weekend saying that, well, he'll probably want to be in office in 2020.
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:38.300]  And so this is their plan.
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:43.580]  Now, they said Trump would be out by December 2017.
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:44.580]  Didn't work.
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:50.540]  But they're definitely more organized and acting like they're going to make the jump
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:54.100]  off the high-rise building into the pool, 10 stories below.
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:57.740]  Who knows if they'll break their back when they hit it, but they think it's going to
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:59.740]  be okay.
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:02.260]  So here is what Elizabeth Warren had to say.
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:04.260]  But here it is.
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:08.260]  It's the first full day of my campaign.
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:16.020]  And one of the things we're going to have to decide about how campaigns go forward is
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:20.060]  about what Donald Trump does every day.
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:32.180]  Every day there's a racist tweet, a hateful tweet, something really dark and ugly.
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:42.700]  And what are we as candidates, as activists, as the press going to do about that?
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:47.620]  We're going to chase after those every day.
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.740]  Are we going to let him use those to divide us?
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:52.260]  You know, here's what bothers me.
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:53.740]  By the time we get to...
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:54.740]  We'll be back.
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:55.740]  Of course.
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:57.740]  Just stay with us.
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:03.860]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.

[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:20.860]  and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:25.340]  and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:26.700]  have terrible side effects.

[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:08.900]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:09.900]  damage.
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:15.020]  We took on Hillary Clinton, we stopped her, we got a national stand.
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:16.940]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.

[01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:20.980]  You are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:25.300]  You are listening to an info wars dot com front line report.
[01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:31.620]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:35.860]  You know we got a live feed via satellite of the U.S. capital and the flags at half
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:36.860]  mast.
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:42.980]  When I drive around Texas, flags are at half mast 90% of the time.
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:48.540]  They said they were at half mast for a month for Herbert Walker Bush, he tried to end the
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:49.540]  United States.
[01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:56.500]  He's a globalist, new world order, and look right there, it's at half mast, like it's
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:00.180]  below half mast.
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:07.500]  It's just constant, yeah this is all part of the demoralization, the country's never
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:13.860]  coming back, the family's bad, I've got articles where a woman on Facebook didn't know that
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:20.020]  a man thought he was a woman, the guy looks like a woman, and so she got arrested for
[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:27.060]  saying it was talking to him like he was a man, that's crazy, it's meant to be crazy.
[01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:30.460]  They're training normal people that he can be thrown in prison for any reason because
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:34.980]  you're a producer and you're going to have a bunch of weird whacked out drug addict
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:40.100]  people who've all signed on to state power, who've all been sterilized, had a terminal
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:42.100]  watching and running your life.
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:47.460]  That's the ruling class, people that chopped their testicles off.
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:54.900]  That's the end game, I'm not joking, you sell out, you roll over to die metaphysically,
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:22:03.580]  you'll be put in a limited time position while they get the AI all worked out as the watcher,
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:14.980]  as the minder, as the chivano, and everybody, you know that's the end, Scarface, I've asked
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:18.900]  good Spanish speakers what it is, they go, maybe I should ask Cubans what it means, but
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:22.940]  no one really tells me what it even means because you want a chivano in every corner
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:31.300]  telling you what to wear, how to live, what to eat, you like squid, I get squid three
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:36.660]  meals a day, I got squid coming out of my, you know what, I want to come to United States
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:43.420]  of America like the President Jimmy Carter says, let's see instead we've got a bunch
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:46.500]  of people coming up that want to be communists and they're literally trying to break our
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:51.900]  border UN funded with UN bases and the Democrats having the judges release everybody and saying
[01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:56.460]  let's get rid of the beds and detention facilities so we can break the border completely and
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:00.100]  just have it wide open like Europe, that same attack.
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:09.060]  This is World War 4 is happening now, but don't worry, Maxine Waters, whose husband
[01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:15.420]  in different bailouts got tens of millions of dollars in one payoff, the Hill reports,
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:20.780]  she gave 12 million dollars of taxpayer money directly to him after he looted the money
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:29.860]  out of the bank he runs in California, also based in Boston.
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:36.540]  So then it's pure, I mean, just look at that psychotic demon possessed, nobody home, it
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:42.180]  was like a ventriloquist doll, like a knock Chucky, you put that head on like a two foot
[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:47.020]  body and it's like I'm here with like a butcher knife.
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:53.500]  You know what she's thinking about?
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:24:02.580]  She ain't home, your planet will serve us well.
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:08.540]  Talk about scams, but she wants to bitch about how America is bad all day, but hell her and
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:12.500]  her husband, they'd probably make pretty good African dictators, wouldn't they run the same
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:13.500]  kind of scams?
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:19.700]  I mean, all of us, you know, Africa is so altruistic in the mythical kingdom of Wakanda.
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:22.540]  And so she could go be in Wakanda to fly around the spaceships.
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:28.740]  Now she'd go to Africa and she'd have 14 Ferraris and palaces in Switzerland.
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:31.420]  She'd turn us into a third world country just like that.
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:36.140]  And by the way, she's trying hard and she's almost done because she's going to rule it,
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:44.780]  she's going to run it and when she's done, there ain't going to be another left.
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:51.980]  Her and Cortez and Michael Moore and all these crooks know exactly what they're doing.
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:59.340]  So I want to open the phones up specifically for all of you.
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:02.620]  I wanted to get your take on their plan to remove the president.
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:07.700]  I've talked quite a bit about it and it's hiding in plain view and the Mueller report
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:10.340]  is going to be over in the next month or so.
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:14.700]  I think early March is what all the tea leaf show and sources I have say.
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:19.780]  And then though it's going to be, oh, oh, they're going to face save and keep it going in the
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:24.460]  judiciary committee in the house, the fake Russia gate under shift.
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:27.780]  All these other 80 plus sub investigations start up.
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:30.380]  Well, let's go ahead and play the Maxine Waters.
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:31.380]  Here it is.
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:39.580]  And you think I'm going to let you stand on someone who's done nothing but steal and
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:43.380]  lie and undermine.
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:45.380]  We're going to get your tax returns.
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:46.380]  Wow.
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:48.380]  So she's going to turn herself in.
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:55.060]  Like you could turn this friend and say Maxine Waters comes clean admit she did it all.
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:26:03.340]  But see again, I care about the third world Africa and Latin America, but there's nothing
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:10.460]  like people were in America bitching about how bad it is when they're trying to recreate
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:11.780]  what's outside the U.S.
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:15.940]  You say what you want about the U.S. we've had our problems, but as corruption goes,
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:19.740]  we were one of the few places where you didn't just hereditarily get all the power than you
[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:21.660]  and then everybody had to bow down to you.
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:24.660]  Like people had shootouts with the railroad magnets.
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:29.660]  I mean, people went to war with the establishment and stood up to it and got some concessions.
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:31.460]  But she's not talking about that.
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.660]  She is the establishment.
[01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:37.380]  It's unbelievable.
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:40.380]  So.
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:46.540]  Elizabeth Warren says Trump may not even be a free person in 2020.
[01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:49.020]  Do we ever even play that club?
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.020]  We've got it ready.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:51.020]  Here it is.
[01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:52.020]  Here's.
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:53.020]  Here's Warren.
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:59.860]  The time we get to 2020, Donald Trump may not even be president.
[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:01.860]  Yeah.
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:05.620]  So that's their plan.
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:08.420]  He may not even be a free person.
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:12.340]  That's right, all those illegal aliens and rapists and murderers and jihadists you're
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:19.900]  bringing in, like repatriating jihadist ISIS fighters, they'll be fine.
[01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:24.460]  And Hillary in the uranium and the fake servers and the child's trafficking networks, that
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:25.780]  will all still be operating.
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:29.940]  But the rest of the American people, the producers, those that actually care about the country,
[01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:35.780]  we're going to keep a tight lid on you because you're our milk cow.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:36.940]  What a group of garbage.
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:39.520]  So we're going to open the phones up.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.180]  What do you think about the move they're about to make on Trump and the announcements
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:45.620]  that, oh, the Southern District of New York is getting ready to indict all the Trump
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:46.620]  people.
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:47.620]  Whoo.
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:51.180]  There's no rush to get, but you're all going to jail for tax evasion for our interpretation.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:55.700]  We say as federal prosecutors, this is illegal from 20 years ago, and we're coming after
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:56.700]  you.
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:57.700]  Whoo.
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:58.700]  It's a miracle.
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:27:59.700]  Just put up with that.
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:00.700]  More of these bullies.
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:05.500]  Total free number to join us, 877-789-2539.
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:14.220]  First-time callers, first-time callers, 877-789-ALIX, 877-789-2539.
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:15.300]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:19.940]  And then I've got a whole bunch of special reports that are so good.
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:22.100]  We're going to air them in the part of the third hour.
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:27.420]  They're going to be back at the end of the third hour live, but these are so powerful
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:30.980]  and so informative that we're going to air them here on air.
[01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:34.260]  One of them, this lady really knocks it out of the park, and I love seeing how viral her
[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:39.700]  videos are going, a plug or the public taker down, but why are people disappearing from
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:40.700]  Uber?
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:41.700]  Could you be next?
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:42.700]  Lisa Haven.
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:45.300]  So that's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:46.300]  And so much more.
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:52.780]  Mark Dice, Paul Joseph Watson, it's all coming up, tomorrow's news today, infowars.com.
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:29:22.620]  Stay with us.

[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.940]  It's simple.
[01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:02.260]  If you want to beat the globalist, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not
[01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:04.940]  doing Bitcoin, pumping dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:07.420]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:11.060]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late term abortion and all the great it is.
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:14.020]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:15.020]  What is the top tumor?
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:17.700]  It's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.180]  What's the best lab in the country?
[01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:20.180]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:22.180]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:25.860]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product and bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:31.140]  I'm like, what's the highest you could do a month later, 90, 95%, no one's ever done
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:32.140]  it.
[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:34.100]  I said, how much does that cost for a bottle that costs $10?
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:35.500]  No one's ever done that, sir.
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:37.780]  The average competitor is three to 5%.
[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:38.780]  The top brand is 50%.
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:41.380]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:45.180]  I mean, you understand, like, that's like our information is explosive, our fish oil.
[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:47.660]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:48.900]  My children take it.
[01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:53.220]  You think I'm going to give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:56.340]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over like one of these devil worshipers?
[01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:57.780]  Never in Forceware.com.

[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:26.940]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:34.980]  You know, I'm proud of real southern culture, I think it has a lot of great things to offer.
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:38.660]  And Texas is kind of the gateway to the west, along with Missouri and Oklahoma, so we're
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:44.700]  kind of southern, kind of not, western and southern, cool mix.
[01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:51.660]  But there's a certain type of candy-ass KKK Democrat that I've learned to really hate
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:59.180]  who always talks in a fake, effeminate voice, who acts real sweet and real like this, and
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:00.740]  you just want to run from them.
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:06.820]  They are the caricature of a corrupt southerner, and most of them are the lineage of carpet
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:12.660]  baggers and scallywags, and that little chicken neck snake is definitely one of them.
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:18.140]  He went to the next level because they fetishize race, they're super uncomfortable around black
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:24.820]  people or anybody else, and he said that black people were indentured servants.
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:33.220]  No they weren't, it's a totally different, it is a form of slavery, but not the same.
[01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:37.300]  The other type of slavery is like four or five times worse, I'd say, but I've studied
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:38.300]  the history.
[01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:40.620]  We're going to get to this amazing clip in a moment, and then your phone calls about
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:45.940]  them trying to take Trump out, not anything Russiagate, but all these different U.S. attorneys
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:50.220]  put in there by Obama and Clinton and Bush, they're all getting ready, folks, to make
[01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:51.220]  their move.
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:54.700]  Well, America put up with this crap.
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:35:05.500]  It's first, hmm, where to start, where to start, my friends, but to say about something
[01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:09.460]  so important.
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:16.340]  We are offering, until this weekend, our best-selling product, Brainforce Plus, the amazing,
[01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:22.740]  Neutropic for Focus Energy Intelligence, you name it, it's just amazing, at 50% off, that
[01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:27.380]  is a massive discount, but I've got to stop this sale, even though it's been very successful,
[01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:29.260]  because we're running low on Brainforce Plus.
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:35.940]  Now it's 50% off, coupled in a combo, with Turboforce at 33% off, so the two together
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:37.660]  are a massive savings.
[01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:43.860]  Now Brainforce is a Neutropic for the brain, and leading competitors are two, three times
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:45.980]  more with similar ingredients.
[01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:49.980]  This is the best ingredients out there at the lowest price.
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:55.140]  You couple it with Turboforce, that I don't even know what to call it, is it a pre-workout,
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:58.860]  is it long-lasting energy, is it next-level energy drink, that's what it all is.
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:04.620]  It's healthy, long-lasting energy, clean burning with all the different types of naturally occurring
[01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:08.460]  energy, with the amino acids, with the vitamins, the minerals, and so much more.
[01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:15.020]  It's Turboforce comes in packets, I suggest you only take half a packet the first time
[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:19.380]  you take it, and if you take it with Brainforce, they go together great, just be careful, because
[01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:21.100]  it's really, really strong.
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:23.980]  The great part about it is, most people take energy drinks the last two, three hours you
[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:25.420]  crash from it.
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:30.060]  Most folks respond to this saying, 10 hours of energy with no crash.
[01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:33.060]  Everybody's metabolic system is different, so experience it for yourself, but here's
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:34.060]  the bottom line.
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:37.540]  We'll still have some limited discounts on both these best-selling products, but it'll
[01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:38.980]  be a few months.
[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:45.620]  These products together are at the lowest price ever, 33% off by itself for Turboforce,
[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:50.900]  33% off with Brainforce, Brainforce is 50% off when you combo it.

[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:16.460]  Let's go to your phone calls on the plan to remove the President, the Democrats admit
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:17.460]  they're doing it.
[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:20.860]  During the election, oh, we're not going to impeach, oh, you know, there's not going
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:26.620]  to be anything but Russiagate, now, oh, we got 84 investigations, and we got U.S. attorneys
[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:33.540]  in big swamp cities like, like D.C., and New York City, and Chicago, and we're coming
[01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:35.060]  for you.
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:36.900]  We're going to get you.
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:39.180]  We're going to indict everybody you know.
[01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:42.780]  Ha, ha, this is coup by a thousand cuts.
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:43.980]  What does Trump do?
[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:45.660]  How do we respond?
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:47.780]  How outrageous is this?
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:52.060]  Why won't he appoint special counsels on Uranium One, and on the Clintons?
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:53.060]  Why won't he do it?
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:54.060]  Why won't he take action?
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.180]  Why won't he stand up to the Internet censorship?
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:38:01.140]  Now that he platforming everybody off their bank accounts, it's a reign of terror.
[01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:04.700]  So yeah, I love Trump compared to Clinton, and I love him compared to Michael Moore,
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:09.140]  and I love him compared to Nancy Pelosi, but Trump didn't get the message.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:14.420]  He's watching Fox News at night, and they won't talk about it.
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:18.340]  It's dangerous, ladies and gentlemen, but speaking of what I mentioned earlier, let's
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:21.700]  get to the governor, I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:32.060]  Here he is on national television, acting totally fake, totally synthetic.
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:36.620]  He's got that weird thing that fake Southerners have, where he has a little skinny neck, and
[01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:40.820]  then the hair on the back of it, like a little snake, it's like a weird mullet, goes down
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:41.820]  the back of his neck.
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:44.780]  You got to see him from the back, like a little snake neck.
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:45.780]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:52.980]  And he didn't talk like this, and lovin' as a word he says, and he just relishes, we
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:39:01.900]  have to remember it's the fall of the year, anniversary of the first African-Milky Flames.
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:12.020]  The indentured servants were Europeans that came off surf land that had to buy their stuff
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:13.020]  from the company store.
[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:17.180]  They were sharecroppers, basically, and they lived on the Lord's property, and if they
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:19.340]  tried to run away or whatever, they'd be killed.
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:24.300]  They would sign a contract for Passengers of the New World to work seven to 10 years as
[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:28.820]  an indentured servant, and yeah, they could put you in prison.
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:35.980]  Sometimes you get hung if you ran away, but you could get out of the slavery, and if you
[01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:39.540]  ran away, you'd mix in with the white population, and a lot of times could get away.
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:44.260]  A lot of the Hessian soldiers were actually German military slaves in the Revolutionary
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:47.940]  War, like something like a fourth of them, sometimes in some areas a half of them would
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:51.540]  defect, because they were already German communities and others, they just say, hey, this looks
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:52.540]  a lot better.
[01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:57.460]  You know, this German girl I just met here in, you know, Pennsylvania, or in New York,
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:02.380]  I think I'm gonna, or New Jersey, I think I'm gonna do that, instead of get shot by
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:07.700]  a bunch of continental soldiers or made in hell, and have been in like, you know, dozens
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:08.700]  of wars.
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:17.700]  So, that's what happened, ladies and gentlemen, and you've got this guy up here just sycophantically
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:21.300]  trying to grovel this black lady on the TV show, and she just slaps him down.
[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:23.420]  I mean, this guy is an embarrassment.
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:24.420]  Here he is.
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:27.820]  I know this has been a very difficult week for you in the state of Virginia, so where
[01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:29.740]  would you like to begin?
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:33.300]  Word has been a difficult week, and, and you know, if you look at Virginia-
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:34.820]  Back you up again, let's play it again.
[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:36.980]  It has been a difficult week.
[01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:38.980]  I'm boss hog.
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:43.540]  Let me exaggerate my, my southern accent.
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:44.860]  People don't didn't talk like that.
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:50.500]  They just keep, these establishment types always act like this.
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:54.380]  They're always Democrats, they're total fakes, they play race politics, it's all they know.
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:56.660]  And he steps in again.
[01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:57.660]  Here he is.
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:02.180]  Word has been a difficult week, and, and you know, if you look at Virginia's history,
[01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:05.860]  we're now at the 400 year anniversary.
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:07.860]  Just start over again, start over again.
[01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:10.620]  He relishes and gets all big eyed.
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:13.940]  We're at the full hundred year anniversary.
[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:16.620]  We're going to call a lot of division out of this.
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:21.420]  We're going to manage everybody like we used to pull whites against poor blacks and play
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:23.140]  them off against each other.
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:29.140]  We go play our game again, and I just, let's just relish this history and make it a big
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:32.420]  deal even though it's still going on in many years of the world.
[01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:35.580]  Let's open up these old wolves right now, baby.
[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:36.580]  Sorry, start it over.
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:41.060]  It has been a difficult week and, and you know, if you look at Virginia's history, we're
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:44.700]  now at the 400 year anniversary.
[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:53.460]  Just 90 miles from here in 1619, the first indentured servants from Africa landed on
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:57.860]  our shores in Old Point Comfort, what we call now Fort Monroe and Wilde.
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:41:58.980]  Also known as slavery.
[01:41:58.980 --> 01:41:59.980]  Yeah.
[01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:00.980]  Yeah.
[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:04.020]  And just everything about this guy is fake.
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:06.420]  He can't even tell the truth was on TV.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:10.380]  Everybody knows an indentured servant is different than a slave.
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:14.580]  It's a form of slavery, but it's not the same thing.
[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:19.460]  It's just, it's just, it's unbelievable, but how he's relishing our history.
[01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:20.460]  It's bad.
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:25.500]  Look, I'm going to do a bad tour and tell everybody how bad white people are and I'm
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.780]  going to know white people aren't bad.
[01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:31.780]  Most people's ancestors got here by the 1870s or 80s and never had anything to do with
[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:32.780]  slavery.
[01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:34.140]  Africa still has slavery.
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:37.780]  Stop running down white people and stop running down America.
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:40.860]  You chicken neck KKK son of a bitch.
[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:44.060]  I guarantee you that son of a bitch was in the KKK.
[01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:47.660]  I know that every side of it thinks he's better than everybody.
[01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:48.660]  He's going to.
[01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:52.340]  He's the landed gentry type going to manage everybody.
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:43:08.940]  You little racist piece of crap get out of our way by leaps and by bounds.
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:15.180]  The number one best selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements,
[01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:20.900]  but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:24.900]  that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible
[01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:25.900]  side effects.

[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:36.180]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:37.580]  You must experience it.
[01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:42.620]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice
[01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:44.780]  or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:46.100]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:47.100]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:51.700]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:54.260]  because it will take you into overdrive.

[01:44:54.100 --> 01:45:03.980]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed
[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:11.940]  that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:18.620]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant, leftist
[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:24.260]  authoritarians, like the young turds and others, get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:26.180]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:29.260]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:34.620]  And that's why the globalist, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:39.700]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very
[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:41.140]  sovereignty away.
[01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:43.420]  This country is in a war.
[01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:47.220]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't
[01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:50.380]  spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we

[01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:02.380]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents knew that they can food during the falls, they'd
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:03.380]  have it during the winter.
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:10.380]  And that's what I'm talking about in InfoWarsStore.com, with InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum

[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:27.460]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:33.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:39.300]  Supreme Wizard, excuse me, Grand Dragon, excuse me, Cyclopsian Ruler, Governor Ralph Northam
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:44.380]  has just slipped up again and said that blacks were indentured servants, which is completely
[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:49.940]  different than the transatlantic African slave trade started by the Arabs and the Muslims.
[01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:53.500]  They should never know why the Muslims then recruit all the blacks to be Muslims.
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:58.180]  When the Koran and Muhammad said the black people weren't very nice things, and that's
[01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:02.540]  why ISIS in Libya killed all the blacks, because they see them as names I won't say
[01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:04.540]  here on air.
[01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:06.020]  Side issue though.
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:08.820]  Let's continue with your calls.
[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:10.300]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:15.580]  We've got Pamela, and we've got Clavin or Calvin.
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:20.220]  We got Megan, we got, I was laughing, I read your name wrong, William and Gary and Jared
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:24.420]  and Dante and Mike and Brandon and Brian and everybody.
[01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:28.420]  So let's go ahead and talk to Pamela in North Carolina.
[01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:29.420]  Thanks for calling.
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:30.420]  Welcome.
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:31.420]  Hi, Alex.
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:34.020]  We just wanted to wish you a happy birthday.
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:35.020]  Thank you.
[01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:38.460]  I would sing to you, but you may not like that part.
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:40.940]  So from all your info warriors, happy birthday.
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:43.060]  I'm an old man now.
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:46.380]  Look like I'm about 50 because I've been in so many wars, but I'm 45.
[01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:47.380]  That's right.
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:49.100]  Oh no, you look great.
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:54.580]  We wanted you to know that we've all placed orders today since it is your birthday celebrating
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:55.580]  for your birthday.
[01:48:55.580 --> 01:48:56.580]  Thank you.
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:49:02.420]  And as far as Trump's impeachment, to me, I would say Trump just needs to get rid of
[01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:04.260]  everybody and start all over.
[01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:06.700]  It can't get any worse than it is now.
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:11.740]  No, I agree, but notice Democrats keep saying we're allowed to remove a president even though
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:12.740]  they're not.
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:15.020]  It's impeachment that does that with fake criminal charges.
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:19.580]  Well, that was the case, any grand jury, any county that didn't like a president could
[01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:23.180]  just indict him and get rid of him, but they're going to make their move with a whole bunch
[01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:26.860]  of indictments here in the next few months, I predict, including, I think maybe the president
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:29.540]  himself, but definitely of his family and others.
[01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:30.540]  So get ready.
[01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:31.540]  Well, we're ready.
[01:49:31.540 --> 01:49:36.620]  All he's got to do is say the word and we thank you for all you do, ma'am.
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:38.140]  I thank you for all your support.
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:42.460]  Listen, I just want to beat Soros and Hillary and we become a contest like a tug of war
[01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:43.460]  with the globalists.
[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:44.460]  Thank you so much.
[01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:45.460]  She's gone.
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:46.460]  She's gone.
[01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:47.460]  Let's go to Megan in Texas.
[01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:48.460]  Megan, you're on the air.
[01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:49.460]  Thanks for holding.
[01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:50.460]  Go ahead.
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:51.460]  Hi, Alex.
[01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:52.460]  How are you today?
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:53.460]  I'm awesome.
[01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:54.460]  Thank you for calling.
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:55.460]  I'm going to give you a little bit of my background.
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:57.140]  I'm 31, live in Texas.
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:58.700]  My grandpa was from Wise County.
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:00.580]  I was born and raised in California.
[01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:02.740]  He went out West for work in the 40s.
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:05.220]  I lived through the downfall of California.
[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:09.140]  My husband and I got out of there as soon as we graduated from school, came to Texas because
[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:12.460]  to us, it was a bastion of freedom.
[01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:15.740]  I'm looking at what's happened in the Trump right now and I'm telling you right now, this
[01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:17.340]  whole country is going the way of California.
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:18.340]  We're going to be disenfranchised.
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:21.820]  If they get him out, that's the gateway right there.
[01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:23.820]  There's no more middle of the country anymore.
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:24.820]  We're not going to have a say.
[01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:27.460]  I mean, we're killing babies and we're poising the ones we're not killing.
[01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:31.980]  We're just here in Texas trying to raise our three little girls and I just, what do
[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:36.180]  you think we're going to, if they, if they manage to get him out, what's our contingency
[01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:37.180]  plan?
[01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:38.180]  Where do we go from there?
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:42.420]  Megan, I hear the earnestness in your voice to concern and I absolutely agree with you.
[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:45.660]  They hit Europe with 15 million military aged men.
[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:46.860]  It's collapsed.
[01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:47.860]  They broke their borders.
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:49.140]  They're breaking ours.
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:50.220]  It's treason.
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:55.460]  The governor of New Mexico, the governor of California has pulled National Guard off.
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:58.340]  We have tens of thousands, four caravans coming.
[01:50:58.340 --> 01:51:02.580]  Five million have announced they're coming in a major Gallup pull.
[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:03.580]  This is insane.
[01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:07.060]  Now, five million wants to join caravans.
[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.060]  That's Gallup.
[01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:12.140]  I mean, it is on and again, they're using these people as weapons.
[01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:16.380]  They're saying, you know, no, no deal on government shutdown unless you get rid of the hundred
[01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:19.780]  thousand beds and only make it 16,500.
[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:22.460]  They're literally saying you can't hold rapists and murderers.
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:26.220]  They're saying you can't check who the kids are with or what diseases they have.
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:30.860]  This is the lawless world government breaking of America with the Democrat collaborators
[01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:31.860]  running and all.
[01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:33.860]  You're absolutely right.
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:34.860]  Yeah.
[01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:41.340]  I just, I, I feel like not only that, my husband and I are both business owners and just, I
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:45.580]  hate to say this, but the brain dead masses, you try to get through to these people.
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:48.940]  They're so asleep and zombified.
[01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:51.540]  You can't get anybody to work.
[01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:53.220]  Luckily for me, my mom works for me.
[01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:55.500]  My husband owns a small trucking company.
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:59.260]  And it's just like, it's pulling teeth to get anybody who wants, who has any kind of
[01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:00.260]  work ethic.
[01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:04.940]  Everybody is glued to their phone constantly, pop culture, having their brain washed all
[01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:05.940]  the time.
[01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:09.540]  And I just want to say that people who don't live in border states, they have no clue.
[01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:13.380]  They have no clue what's going to happen when all these people come in and overrun us.
[01:52:13.380 --> 01:52:14.580]  I've seen it happen.
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:18.660]  The town I grew up in is completely, you can go to the downtown area I grew up in and
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:20.380]  it's nothing but Spanish.
[01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:23.180]  You go to the Walmart, everything's in Spanish.
[01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:25.540]  If you didn't know Spanish, you didn't get a job.
[01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:26.540]  And it's just,
[01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:31.940]  Oh, there's all the videos where, where the Mexicans tell you, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:32.940]  Nobody doesn't speak Spanish.
[01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:34.460]  And by the way, it's very racist.
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:35.460]  They say no black people.
[01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:36.740]  They use a blackbird term.
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:37.740]  Oh, I know.
[01:52:37.740 --> 01:52:39.740]  They say no Mayotes.
[01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:40.740]  Yeah.
[01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:41.740]  Yeah.
[01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:42.740]  They hate blacks.
[01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:46.100]  When we were in college, it was just kind of starting to pop off with all this idiocy there.
[01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:49.420]  My husband got kicked out of three of our college classes for standing up and speaking
[01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:50.420]  his mind.
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:53.300]  But the brown shirts would come out with Mecha.
[01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:54.300]  And it was,
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:58.540]  Which means for those in the race, everything, for those outside the race, nothing.
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:53:03.220]  And most Hispanics aren't racist like this, but the politically involved people or Hispanics
[01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:06.620]  that are Americans are great people, but this is the globalist plan.
[01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:08.620]  And it's absolutely two minutes to midnight.
[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:10.300]  California used to be just like Texas.
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:12.100]  It's now a collapsing hellhole.
[01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:14.100]  God bless you, Megan.
[01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:17.300]  Megan was on fire, ladies and gentlemen, and her warning is absolutely true.
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:19.500]  Are you going to listen to her?
[01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:25.780]  Because a lot of Texans, a lot of Oklahomans went out to California and now they've come
[01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:28.900]  back because the state is gone, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:29.900]  We have some affiliates out there.
[01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:34.100]  So a lot of great people, a beautiful state, but it's gone and we have to admit this is
[01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:35.100]  the mindset.
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:38.980]  It's a great program in the future.
[01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:41.540]  Let's go to another caller here.
[01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:43.060]  Let's talk to Brandon in Colorado.
[01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:46.940]  We have Democrats introducing articles of impeachment today, Brandon.
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:50.660]  Good to talk to you, Alex.
[01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:53.900]  This first off, I wanted to say thanks for the product that tried a couple of them.
[01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:58.180]  The brain force and the silver bullet.
[01:53:58.180 --> 01:54:00.180]  All good products.
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:01.180]  Thank you.
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:07.460]  The second is, I don't know exactly how it entirely works, but is there a way that Trump
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:16.100]  could possibly use the continuity of government in calling the column for the civil unrest
[01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:17.100]  that they're starting?
[01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:18.100]  I mean, it's getting bad enough.
[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:19.100]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:20.100]  I'm Mr. Anta Marshall Law.
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:24.180]  I'm Mr. Anta Police State because I saw the Democrats building up an apparatus for the
[01:54:24.180 --> 01:54:25.180]  constitutionalist.
[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:29.380]  Then the cops wouldn't do what the Dems said, so they sort of killing cops with a strong
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:32.700]  cities initiative to try to bring them in under globalist control.
[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:34.380]  So the police have woken up and kind of repelled.
[01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:35.380]  That doesn't mean they're perfect.
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:36.380]  Nobody has.
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:39.300]  They're a cross-section of the country, but the country's woken up to the police have woken
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:40.300]  up by and large.
[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:43.700]  In fact, statistically more than anybody else other than military.
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:48.260]  And so I don't want Marshall Law, but the Democrats are putting us into a civil emergency.
[01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:49.260]  They're crushing our border.
[01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:50.660]  They're trying to end the country.
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:52.140]  They started the war.
[01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:57.220]  So yes, we are going towards the Democrats are going to have a state of emergency to
[01:54:57.220 --> 01:55:00.780]  bring in their own Marshall Law, or we're going to counter them, they're going to bring
[01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:01.780]  in their own crisis.
[01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:04.580]  We're going to have to crush them at that point or capitulate.
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:05.580]  They started the war.
[01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:09.220]  We're an existential war for the very future of the country right now.
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:15.540]  Well, they can start the war, but the problem is they're not going to be left with life.
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:18.140]  What they're left with as far as the population is.
[01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:21.700]  Well, the globalists in the IMF documents think we're idiots.
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:25.620]  They'll always point at people rioting leftist and right-wingers against each other in some
[01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:28.180]  city center and say, that's where you go fight.
[01:55:28.180 --> 01:55:31.780]  If stuff goes into a civil war, folks, you don't go down and demonstrate.
[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:32.780]  Okay.
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:36.220]  Everybody knows that if things really go into a hot war, they've already cut off our bank
[01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:38.340]  accounts and arresting us.
[01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:39.680]  You don't even go out with the police.
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:41.340]  You know who the enemy is.
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:42.340]  It's the globalist.
[01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:43.700]  It's their operatives.
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:45.100]  That's absolutely critical.
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:46.180]  Okay, folks.
[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:48.340]  That's pretty clear, isn't it, Brandon?
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:49.900]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:51.300]  We're not calling for that.
[01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:55.420]  Just if they want a war, just like at Bunker Hill, you know, the captain said, listen,
[01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:56.420]  we don't want a war.
[01:55:56.420 --> 01:55:57.420]  We don't want to start today.
[01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:00.060]  But if they came for a war, they're going to get one.
[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:01.060]  Don't shoot first.
[01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:05.340]  Well, the shot hurt around the world was fired by the Redcoats and the rest is history.
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:09.140]  So if they want a war, they're going to get one and they know who's loyal to America and
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:10.140]  who isn't.
[01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:11.420]  They know who isn't going to back down and who is.
[01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:14.540]  They've already been testing as he was going to roll over during this.
[01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:16.180]  So get ready, folks.
[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:18.100]  You want to go toe-to-toe with the globalists.
[01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:20.260]  Just understand it's on.
[01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:25.260]  And remember, Pelosi and all them are going to wake this out in Kauai and in Tasmania.
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:31.940]  But I, I, I imagine that there are a lot of people in those areas that have already made
[01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:36.340]  Santa Claus list about, you know, everything is going to go down because of the global
[01:56:36.340 --> 01:56:42.460]  instinct they're going to sit here and screw this country and screw our children over and
[01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:43.460]  pull all this crap.
[01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:45.420]  And then there ain't going to be a two-way street here.
[01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:46.940]  They're going to be blowback.
[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:48.220]  What do you think is going to happen, my friend?
[01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:49.220]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:50.220]  There he went.
[01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:53.980]  And that's the type of world we've gotten to.
[01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:55.420]  We come back.
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:57.060]  We've got more calls here.
[01:56:57.060 --> 01:57:02.180]  We've got, William says, Mueller will not stop also funding the Info War.
[01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:07.060]  Mueller is going to in name stop and pull back because his fake Russia gate was a smokescreen
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:11.940]  for non-Russian related crimes in a dragnet.
[01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:17.380]  So you're right, technically he's not going to stop, but he's like an ICBM three-stage
[01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:18.380]  missile.
[01:57:18.380 --> 01:57:24.700]  He's the boost and then the in-orbit delivery, you know, boost gets you up, you get into
[01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:30.020]  orbit, you've got another propellant, and then now the reentry device is going to be
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:33.420]  all of these fake investigations.
[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:39.140]  So the multiple reentry device, MIRV, shell case pops open, they've got 84 fake investigations
[01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:40.140]  they're going to launch on us.
[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:44.220]  And they're now coming back into orbit, MIRV is opening, warheads are being deployed as
[01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:45.220]  we speak.
[01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:46.220]  Stand by.
[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:53.020]  For those looking for the ultimate source of energy for their day, every day, the Brain
[01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:55.140]  Synergy Combo is here.

[02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:27.980]  I've got lawyers here, I'm getting ready to pull trigger on lawsuit against the deep
[02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:28.980]  state.
[02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:30.380]  So, it's going to happen now.
[02:00:30.380 --> 02:00:34.900]  So, I'll have lunch over war planning, and we'll be back live in the war rooms coming
[02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:35.900]  up.
[02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:36.900]  We've got so much.
[02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:37.900]  Matt McGinnis is going to be in studio tomorrow.
[02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:40.180]  Ali Alexander is here in town as well.
[02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:46.620]  We're going back to your phone calls right now, so please stay with us.
[02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:50.740]  Let's go ahead and go back to who I said I was going to go to here.
[02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:52.220]  Let's talk to Mike and Kansas.
[02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:54.740]  Mike, you're on the here, go ahead.
[02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:56.740]  Alex, are you there?
[02:00:56.740 --> 02:00:57.740]  I am.
[02:00:57.740 --> 02:00:58.740]  All right.
[02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:02.740]  Listen, with this indictment, what's going to happen?
[02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:04.820]  You remember Mike and Kansas City?
[02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:05.820]  That's me.
[02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:14.660]  I've been in the Feds for a while, but what always happens with this is that you get indicted,
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:19.940]  they get their cherry-picked jury, they get it in front of a judge who will let them get
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:23.500]  away with anything, and you're going to prison.
[02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:24.500]  That's how it works.
[02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:29.900]  Yes, but there's a separation of powers, so indictments of the president go nowhere.
[02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:33.700]  The media is trying to act like they do to create this illusion that the president's
[02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:34.700]  a criminal.
[02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:38.820]  What they do is indict everyone around Trump to try to get them to then make up lies about
[02:01:38.820 --> 02:01:41.380]  the president, their impeachable offenses.
[02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:44.220]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:53.140]  So what needs to happen, in my opinion, no violence, but we can't all keep expecting
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:57.580]  the president to kiss every bruise on every knee.
[02:01:57.580 --> 02:02:03.660]  We, the people, need to get physically in the 3D dimension, get up and get out.
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:07.100]  No, I totally agree, we should be going to every Democrat event and confronting them
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:08.100]  about what they've done.
[02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:09.460]  We should be out there taking action.
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:10.460]  God bless you, Mike.
[02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:13.180]  I totally agree with you, because they're the ones trying to get violent.
[02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:16.060]  They're the ones trying to cut people's bank accounts off and everything.
[02:02:16.060 --> 02:02:18.620]  That's trying to kill people, trying to take food out of your kid's mouth.
[02:02:18.620 --> 02:02:20.740]  I mean, this is a savage group of dirtbags.
[02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:25.620]  This has been all the longest here.
[02:02:25.620 --> 02:02:28.340]  Brian in California has a message to the global.
[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:29.340]  Let's go ahead, Brian.
[02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:30.340]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:02:30.340 --> 02:02:31.340]  Good, brother.
[02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:38.700]  Good, I just wanted to say that, you know, remember you were talking about that time,
[02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:44.020]  you were near on the plane, and the globalist said to you that everybody will just adapt.
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:47.140]  Well, I mean, they killed Breitbart.
[02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:48.140]  They killed Webb.
[02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:49.620]  They're going to kill you.
[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:52.260]  Are we just going to adapt to it?
[02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:55.060]  No, I'm not going to adapt to it, and I'm not suicidal.
[02:02:55.060 --> 02:02:56.060]  I don't afford to death.
[02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:59.380]  I got kids I want to take care of, but I think they kill me.
[02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:03.180]  It's a little bit different than Breitbart or Gary Webb, but, you know, I'm not worried
[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:04.180]  about it.
[02:03:04.180 --> 02:03:05.180]  I get in the car every day.
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:06.180]  That's a super dangerous thing to do as well.
[02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:07.580]  I put my kids in the car and drive around.
[02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:09.300]  That's the most dangerous thing you can do.
[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:13.740]  So sure, I mean, everybody always says, so who's going to start killing?
[02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:14.740]  Who are we going to kill?
[02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:16.260]  I mean, who are we going to start killing?
[02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:19.460]  Because, I mean, everybody always is like, hey, it's time to get violent.
[02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:23.380]  And so they're always trying to stir stuff up and blame us for violence.
[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:27.260]  So I'm not saying we should offensively start violence, but people that are talking about
[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:28.260]  violence.
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:29.260]  Do you plan anything?
[02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:31.820]  Or is it all just kind of tell the people to get violent?
[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:34.140]  Well, let's just put it this way.
[02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:37.260]  I'm a handyman and I operate in the Bay Area.
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:39.820]  I'm in a $7 million house right now.
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:41.900]  I have stood next to Ray Kurzweil.
[02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:43.980]  I have stood next to Nathan Wolfe.
[02:03:43.980 --> 02:03:44.980]  You can look him up.
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:45.980]  He's a DARPA type.
[02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:46.980]  Okay.
[02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:47.980]  Listen, listen, listen.
[02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:50.180]  You got me ready to have a cream of my pants.
[02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:51.180]  So let's just stop right there.
[02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:53.420]  I get what you're talking about, brother, I understand.
[02:03:53.420 --> 02:03:57.380]  That's exactly what these bastards don't get is the very helicopter pilots, the very jet
[02:03:57.380 --> 02:04:03.340]  pilots, the very people guarding them, hate their guts and can't wait to deliver them
[02:04:03.340 --> 02:04:04.620]  to the bottom of the Davy Jones.
[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:05.620]  I understand.
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:06.620]  Yeah.
[02:04:06.620 --> 02:04:08.300]  We're in your houses.
[02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:11.380]  We watch you while you sleep.
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:16.940]  I don't think they realize that because they've taken our restraint for weakness, Brian.
[02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:19.780]  I don't know what to do.
[02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:24.220]  I'm a former military, former police officer, and I'm just frustrated.
[02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:28.060]  Well, I think while you're talking, please don't do anything, but I think where you're
[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:29.060]  talking is great.
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:32.060]  We're not going to go right in the street and kill cops like the left does.
[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:33.620]  Stuff goes off.
[02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:34.620]  We just clean house.
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:35.620]  Don't we?
[02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:37.780]  What's the catalyst going to be?
[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:39.460]  I think we're going to know it when it comes.
[02:04:39.460 --> 02:04:41.460]  We want to fix it.
[02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:43.500]  But I don't know, brother, but you're getting me.
[02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:44.500]  Believe me.
[02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:45.500]  Believe me.
[02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:48.580]  You're talking the talk that, you know, I already got going on in my brain.
[02:04:48.580 --> 02:04:49.580]  Let's just, we need to hold back.
[02:04:49.580 --> 02:04:53.540]  We just need to hold back, but I understand we need to let them also know that we're
[02:04:53.540 --> 02:05:05.620]  not scared.
[02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:12.100]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:17.820]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:22.260]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burnout in
[02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:24.740]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:31.300]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:34.180]  and beyond system in the world.
[02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:35.700]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:36.700]  Must experience it.
[02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:41.180]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:43.820]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:45.100]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:46.620]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:50.700]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force
[02:05:50.700 --> 02:06:15.020]  because it will take you into overdrive, Turbo Force and EnforceLive.com.
[01:51:49.100 --> 02:06:31.180] �Hi everyone Lisa Haven here and I've got a question for you.
[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:36.580]  Do those at the very top, I'm talking the globalist democratic arm who is in league
[02:06:36.580 --> 02:06:42.820]  with the communist Chinese by the way because we know they own a majority here in America.
[02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:47.380]  Do they want their opposition gone, eliminated?
[02:06:47.380 --> 02:06:54.140]  If not, then why is there such a concerted effort of all these groups working against
[02:06:54.140 --> 02:07:00.860]  us to ban us from multiple sites, sites that have nothing to do with politics?
[02:07:00.860 --> 02:07:01.860]  What am I talking about?
[02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:04.740]  Well, let's start with Infowars' Alex Jones.
[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:10.100]  Months ago, Infowars was banned from multiple, not only social media sites, but sites that
[02:07:10.100 --> 02:07:11.860]  had nothing to do with social media.
[02:07:11.860 --> 02:07:13.260]  Check this out.
[02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:16.420]  Here's an entire list from Infowars in which they were banned.
[02:07:16.420 --> 02:07:21.380]  The platforms they were banned from, it includes Facebook, it includes YouTube, it includes
[02:07:21.380 --> 02:07:24.420]  Twitter, Spotify, and many, many others.
[02:07:24.420 --> 02:07:29.260]  But on that list are also a few things that should have never have made the list.
[02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:31.380]  I'm talking about LinkedIn.
[02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:35.540]  LinkedIn deals with, well, resumes and job qualifications.
[02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:37.340]  Or how about Shopify?
[02:07:37.340 --> 02:07:41.060]  Shopify has to deal with e-commerce, buying and selling on the Internet.
[02:07:41.060 --> 02:07:42.500]  Or what about PayPal?
[02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:48.500]  PayPal has to deal with sending money to and from people kind of like that of an Internet
[02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:52.740]  bank almost, because transactions are made, right?
[02:07:52.740 --> 02:07:57.700]  But here we have PayPal banning someone for their political view.
[02:07:57.700 --> 02:08:01.940]  Now, the question isn't whether you agree with Alex Jones' Infowars or not.
[02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:03.260]  That's not the question.
[02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:09.540]  The question is, why is it okay for PayPal to ban someone for their political view?
[02:08:09.540 --> 02:08:11.300]  That's the question.
[02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:12.300]  And here's the thing.
[02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:15.140]  PayPal, they don't ban criminals.
[02:08:15.140 --> 02:08:19.180]  You see, you can be a murderer, you can be a rapist, you can be a pedophile, you can
[02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:23.540]  be convicted of multiple crimes, you can be a thief, you can even be a hacker, convicted
[02:08:23.540 --> 02:08:25.900]  of a hack, and guess what?
[02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:27.780]  You're allowed on PayPal.
[02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:33.700]  You're allowed to thrive on their platform, but yet someone who has a different view from
[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:41.220]  PayPal or Shopify aren't allowed to be part of their platform?
[02:08:41.220 --> 02:08:52.260]  How is it that a political name has been degraded more than, say, your average mass criminal?
[02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:57.620]  It doesn't make any kind of sense, unless there's a concerted effort by those at the
[02:08:57.620 --> 02:09:00.700]  top to eliminate a certain voice.
[02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:03.140]  But here's the question.
[02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:04.540]  Did it stop at Infowars?
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:06.900]  Was it just a one-time deal with PayPal?
[02:09:06.900 --> 02:09:08.380]  Absolutely not.
[02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:10.300]  They went on to ban Laura Loomer.
[02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:12.220]  Yeah, check this out.
[02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:17.020]  Here's a screenshot from Laura Loomer's page saying she was banned for, well, hate speech
[02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:18.220]  on PayPal.
[02:09:18.220 --> 02:09:19.580]  Here we go again.
[02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:23.060]  We have another activist banned on PayPal.
[02:09:23.060 --> 02:09:28.500]  She's never committed any major murderous crime or is a violent person or has even been
[02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:30.380]  convicted of anything violent.
[02:09:30.380 --> 02:09:33.940]  Yet she's banned for her political view.
[02:09:33.940 --> 02:09:41.420]  When did politics become worse than a murder or a rape or a pedophile-ness, pedophilia?
[02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:43.260]  When did it become such a crime?
[02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:44.660]  That's my question.
[02:09:44.660 --> 02:09:49.780]  Sounds eerily similar to something that happened under Stalin's regime, right?
[02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:54.180]  When he labeled his political activists with some kind of mental disorder.
[02:09:54.180 --> 02:09:57.420]  You see, same thing's happening right now in America.
[02:09:57.420 --> 02:09:58.420]  But guess what?
[02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:05.180]  Laura Loomer wasn't only banned from PayPal, she was also banned from Uber and Lyft.
[02:10:05.180 --> 02:10:06.860]  Check this report out.
[02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:09.300]  This is from thedaily.com.
[02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:16.940]  Uber and Lyft banned far-right activist Laura Loomer for an anti-Muslim rant.
[02:10:16.940 --> 02:10:19.460]  Interesting.
[02:10:19.460 --> 02:10:23.820]  So Uber, by the way, she was also banned from Uber Eats, right?
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:26.500]  Uber, Uber Eats, and Lyft.
[02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:29.340]  What do they have to do with politics?
[02:10:29.340 --> 02:10:35.300]  It doesn't really matter what was said, but in all reality, does Uber ban people for being
[02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:38.140]  anti-Christian and hating on Christians?
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:44.740]  Does Uber ban people for being anti-Semitic or against certain things?
[02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:46.580]  Do they ban any of that?
[02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:47.580]  No.
[02:10:47.580 --> 02:10:48.580]  No.
[02:10:48.580 --> 02:10:52.740]  What about, does Uber, okay, let's think of the risk of the drivers in Uber because they
[02:10:52.740 --> 02:10:54.500]  should be of utmost concern.
[02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:56.380]  They get their background checks, right?
[02:10:56.380 --> 02:11:00.660]  The Uber driver has a background check and all of that to make sure the passenger is safe.
[02:11:00.660 --> 02:11:04.140]  But you see, Uber allows all kinds of passengers.
[02:11:04.140 --> 02:11:07.420]  It doesn't matter if you committed a crime, it doesn't matter if you've raped someone
[02:11:07.420 --> 02:11:12.300]  in the past or a murderer, they don't do a background check of who's in that car, do
[02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:13.300]  they?
[02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:14.300]  No.
[02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:16.180]  It has nothing to do with that.
[02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:17.180]  Everyone's allowed.
[02:11:17.180 --> 02:11:25.260]  But here, because someone supposedly spoke against one, against Muslims, and I'm not saying
[02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:29.300]  it's not right to speak against anyone in that manner, but what I'm saying is because
[02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:34.620]  she did something like that, she gets banned, she wasn't being violent, wasn't causing
[02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:39.580]  any violence, but yet, why does one voice get censored?
[02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:42.980]  But the other side doesn't at all.
[02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:43.980]  No one else.
[02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:51.780]  Just one political voice, rapists, pedophiles, can all ride in an Uber, can they not?
[02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:56.740]  They can all get in and ride, putting the life of the Uber driver at risk.
[02:11:56.740 --> 02:11:58.540]  They don't get banned.
[02:11:58.540 --> 02:12:06.340]  So who's the worst criminal of all, according to social media and Uber and PayPal and all
[02:12:06.340 --> 02:12:12.140]  these companies rising to the forefront to fight hate speech, was literally become in
[02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:18.020]  America more of a crime of hate speech against anyone, and it's not even hate speech, it's
[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:21.940]  a political speech that's being subjected.
[02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:27.900]  Political speech has become enemy number one, and I've just proved to you that point.
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:33.580]  I want to bring awareness to what's really going on, and all I'm asking for is fairness.
[02:12:33.580 --> 02:12:39.180]  All I'm asking for is why don't we focus on the real problem at hand?
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:43.140]  How about some of the criminality we have in America?
[02:12:43.140 --> 02:12:49.780]  How about true love, peace and happiness, and not attacking one political side for their
[02:12:49.780 --> 02:12:55.180]  viewpoint, but everybody understanding that we have differences of opinion?
[02:12:55.180 --> 02:12:59.300]  Since when did we become like Stalin's error?
[02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:04.660]  To where political activists is enemy number one over any crime.
[02:13:04.660 --> 02:13:09.580]  You can rob a bank, and that's less of a crime, according to these social media sites.
[02:13:09.580 --> 02:13:15.220]  You're worthy to rob tons of banks and still have all these things, social media sites,
[02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:23.380]  but lo and behold, if you speak against the globalist, progressive, democratic, liberal
[02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:29.580]  arm, you're worthy of being banned from everyday things.
[02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:32.580]  How is that fair?
[02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:37.500]  People don't get their electricity taken away unless they don't pay their bill, right?
[02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:44.340]  People don't get their phones turned off unless they don't pay what's owed to the bill company.
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:48.420]  People don't get their gas bill shut off unless they don't pay the bill.
[02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:50.340]  Why isn't it that way with PayPal?
[02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:55.540]  It's understandable if you're not paying what's due on PayPal or paying what you needed to
[02:13:55.540 --> 02:14:00.260]  on Shopify, or you didn't pay the Uber driver, or you got violent with the Uber driver, then
[02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:04.980]  no more Uber for you, but that's not the case.
[02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:09.380]  It's simply your political view, which they're calling and labeling under hate speech, that
[02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:10.380]  is how it began.
[02:14:10.380 --> 02:14:16.220]  You see, under Stalin's error, they labeled it some kind of mental issue if you were in
[02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:18.980]  disagreement with Stalin, you see?
[02:14:18.980 --> 02:14:25.980]  So having a political viewpoint became a mental state, and so people were subjected to all
[02:14:25.980 --> 02:14:31.340]  kinds of stuff like we're seeing today, but since we have the beauty of the internet,
[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:35.660]  we're seeing it in so many forms in different ways than ever before.
[02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:37.260]  So how do we fix it?
[02:14:37.260 --> 02:14:38.860]  How do we change things?
[02:14:38.860 --> 02:14:39.860]  What do we do?
[02:14:39.860 --> 02:14:44.820]  Well, for starters, maybe we could write letters to PayPal, let them know our feelings and
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:53.020]  how we believe, you know, suppressing someone for a political view isn't right.
[02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:59.180]  Same thing with Uber and Lyft, why do you ban a political view but not a criminal who
[02:14:59.180 --> 02:15:03.660]  could actually put the life of your driver at stake?
[02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:07.180]  Good question.
[02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:10.860]  And you know, I encourage you, contact your congressmen and senators.
[02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:16.620]  Let them start passing bills or making rules or laws, which this needs to stop.
[02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:21.140]  We have utilities, and these utilities aren't allowed to turn anyone off with any other
[02:15:21.140 --> 02:15:25.220]  reason really unless you're not paying your bill.
[02:15:25.220 --> 02:15:30.180]  Why are they able to turn us off like that on the internet?
[02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:34.220]  For a crime that is not, has not been committed.
[02:15:34.220 --> 02:16:03.060]  That's a question, something to think about.
[02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:04.820]  Not a live underground gopher.

[02:16:56.260 --> 02:17:00.180]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:01.740]  I sued the IRS in one.
[02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:04.700]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.700 --> 02:17:07.940]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with

[02:20:30.820 --> 02:20:44.500]  on.
[02:20:44.500 --> 02:20:48.460]  The video I did earlier this week calling out Joe Rogan for his lame interview with Twitter
[02:20:48.460 --> 02:20:55.060]  CEO Jack Dorsey got over 800 thumbs down from the loyal Joe Rogan fans, the most thumb-down
[02:20:55.060 --> 02:20:57.500]  video I've made in six months.
[02:20:57.500 --> 02:21:01.220]  If only there was some way for YouTube to protect me from all these people hurting my
[02:21:01.220 --> 02:21:05.140]  feelings with their thumbs down, oh wait, what's this?
[02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:09.980]  YouTube will experiment with ways to prevent dislike button mobs.
[02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:14.820]  This is not a joke, they're freaking out because garbage videos like the Gillette ad and Elizabeth
[02:21:14.820 --> 02:21:20.580]  Warren's presidential announcement get hundreds of thousands or millions of dislikes.
[02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:25.740]  By the way, the 800 thumbs down that my video got is nothing compared to the 34,000 thumbs
[02:21:25.740 --> 02:21:32.140]  up that it got which equates to about a 97.5% favorable rating.
[02:21:32.140 --> 02:21:36.900]  But I do appreciate the feedback and the like and the dislike button are great tools to
[02:21:36.900 --> 02:21:38.300]  give that feedback.
[02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:43.460]  For example, when 22,000 people thumb down Good Morning America's video featuring the
[02:21:43.460 --> 02:21:52.460]  11 year old drag kid Desmond is amazing, which equates to about a 95% negative rating showing
[02:21:52.460 --> 02:21:54.740]  that people don't want to see this crap.
[02:21:54.740 --> 02:21:59.660]  But the literal world record for the number one most thumb down YouTube video in history
[02:21:59.660 --> 02:22:07.140]  goes to YouTube's very own 2018 Rewind which they themselves produced in order to highlight
[02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:09.260]  the top YouTubers of the year.
[02:22:09.260 --> 02:22:14.540]  It was the epitome of social justice warrior propaganda and also featured mainstream celebrities
[02:22:14.540 --> 02:22:17.980]  like Will Smith, Trevor Noah and John Oliver.
[02:22:17.980 --> 02:22:23.300]  So 15 million people sent a message with their thumbs down that it didn't represent YouTubers
[02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:26.620]  or YouTube culture and that it was garbage.
[02:22:26.620 --> 02:22:30.260]  Something similar happens every time YouTube puts out a corporate video pushing liberal
[02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:36.020]  propaganda like when they release their coming together to celebrate the dozens of different
[02:22:36.020 --> 02:22:37.900]  gender identities.
[02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:43.580]  That only did this one have over 300,000 thumbs down but they also disabled the comments because
[02:22:43.580 --> 02:22:46.420]  they can't show that people are voicing disagreement.
[02:22:46.420 --> 02:22:50.540]  YouTube's not quite sure what they're going to do to save people's feelings from getting
[02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:55.740]  heard from so many thumbs down and protect other people from realizing that a garbage
[02:22:55.740 --> 02:22:57.620]  video is garbage.
[02:22:57.620 --> 02:23:02.220]  This YouTube employee said that they may not allow you to thumb down videos anymore unless
[02:23:02.220 --> 02:23:03.780]  you watch the whole thing.
[02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:07.740]  If I don't like a video, I'm certainly not going to watch the whole thing which is part
[02:23:07.740 --> 02:23:11.820]  of their plan to artificially inflate the ratings of the videos.
[02:23:11.820 --> 02:23:16.300]  Oh and what do we have here, his video explaining that they may take away our ability to thumb
[02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:20.300]  down videos as over a 50% thumbs down rating.
[02:23:20.300 --> 02:23:25.060]  In other news, Instagram just censored a post from conservative commentator Kayleigh McEnany
[02:23:25.060 --> 02:23:29.300]  after she put up that popular picture showing that Elizabeth Warren claimed that she was
[02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:33.180]  an American Indian on her Texas bar registration.
[02:23:33.180 --> 02:23:36.380]  That's harassment and bullying, they said.
[02:23:36.380 --> 02:23:40.620]  Meanwhile BuzzFeed is pressuring Twitter to censor memes that are hurting Democrats'
[02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:47.260]  feelings saying that Twitter is allowing this altered photo comparing women members of Congress
[02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:53.820]  who were wiped to the state of the union to the KKK to circulate on its platform despite
[02:23:53.820 --> 02:24:00.620]  its own policy that it doesn't allow symbols historically associated with hate groups.
[02:24:00.620 --> 02:24:04.860]  They want to censor memes from social media now because every day is a new law for the
[02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:05.860]  left.
[02:24:05.860 --> 02:24:09.140]  I hope you guys pick up a copy of my new book, Liberals and Finding Cure which came out a
[02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:14.140]  few months ago in paperback from Amazon.com or download the ebook out of your tablet or
[02:24:14.140 --> 02:24:17.860]  your e-reader, and I'm sure you liked the true story of fake news that came out about
[02:24:17.860 --> 02:24:18.860]  a year ago.
[02:24:18.860 --> 02:24:23.260]  It covers all the mainstream media manipulation, the social media censorship, and the liberal
[02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:25.940]  bias that we're just being bombarded with.
[02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:28.660]  The books are a lot better than I'm sure you would expect, they're a lot more serious
[02:24:28.660 --> 02:24:31.540]  to you than these short and sarcastic YouTube videos.
[02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:35.260]  So if you guys enjoyed my channel, I hope you pick up a copy of one of them on Amazon.com
[02:24:35.260 --> 02:24:38.260]  or click the link in the description below, it'll take you over to the store, or again
[02:24:38.260 --> 02:24:41.300]  you can download the ebooks out of your tablet or your e-reader.
[02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:44.980]  Or if you're not a reader, you can always get your Liberals and Finding Cure t-shirt
[02:24:44.980 --> 02:24:58.660]  from my online store markdice.com and help spread the word.
[02:24:58.660 --> 02:25:04.140]  On Thursday, Alexandria CrazyEyes Cortez released her plan to save the world called the New
[02:25:04.140 --> 02:25:09.260]  Green Deal, which is a non-binding resolution that she hopes that everyone will follow in
[02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:11.060]  order to save our planet.
[02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:15.100]  I had to put in a lot of overtime fact-checking all the reports that I was seeing because
[02:25:15.100 --> 02:25:19.060]  I thought there was no way that they could be accurate, they had to be fake news.
[02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:21.500]  But what I'm about to tell you is true.
[02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:27.060]  In the outline posted on her official government website, it calls for a quote, a huge mobilization
[02:25:27.060 --> 02:25:30.140]  to create a renewable energy economy as fast as possible.
[02:25:30.140 --> 02:25:35.500]  We set a goal to get net zero rather than zero emissions in 10 years because we aren't
[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:43.140]  sure that we're able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.
[02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:46.900]  Democrats have been concerned about cow farts for some time now, thinking that they're
[02:25:46.900 --> 02:25:49.140]  contributing to global warming.
[02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:53.260]  CrazyEyes also hopes that by the government spending all of our tax money fighting climate
[02:25:53.260 --> 02:25:59.540]  change, that it will also provide everyone with quote, a job with a family sustaining
[02:25:59.540 --> 02:26:07.460]  wage, high quality education, including higher education, aside from clean air and water,
[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:14.380]  healthy food, high quality healthcare, safe, affordable, adequate housing, and economic
[02:26:14.380 --> 02:26:21.060]  security for all of those who are unable or unwilling to work.
[02:26:21.060 --> 02:26:25.780]  So for those people who just don't want to work, they can get a UBI, a universal basic
[02:26:25.780 --> 02:26:29.060]  income, free money from the government for doing nothing.
[02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:34.900]  After being widely ridiculed by almost everyone, including Nancy Pelosi, she then deleted the
[02:26:34.900 --> 02:26:37.980]  FAQ section from her website.
[02:26:37.980 --> 02:26:42.020]  At first I thought that the screenshots I was seeing online and the excerpts I was reading
[02:26:42.020 --> 02:26:47.780]  were satire, but I have the original document, and that's exactly what it says, and a lot
[02:26:47.780 --> 02:26:54.220]  of news outlets did report that she was promising money for those who were unwilling to work.
[02:26:54.220 --> 02:26:58.300]  The part about the farting cows is true too, but they have since changed the language to
[02:26:58.300 --> 02:27:01.100]  say emissions, emissions from the cows.
[02:27:01.100 --> 02:27:04.260]  Subscribe to my channel if you're new here, because it gets even better.
[02:27:04.260 --> 02:27:09.620]  I saw someone posted this meme with a quote attributed to her saying, quote, we need to
[02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:14.420]  invent technology that's never even been invented yet.
[02:27:14.420 --> 02:27:18.300]  The memes about her are the best thing happening on the internet right now, but what makes this
[02:27:18.300 --> 02:27:21.900]  meme so funny is that this is actually a real quote.
[02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:28.940]  It's not even fact-checked it, did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez say we need to invent technology
[02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:33.700]  that's never been invented, and they said yes, it is correct.
[02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:35.100]  Oh, it gets even better.
[02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:39.140]  Not only is her plan going to save the world from global warming, it's also going to end
[02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:40.140]  racism.
[02:27:40.140 --> 02:27:46.900]  Because today is the day that we truly embark on a comprehensive agenda of economic, social,
[02:27:46.900 --> 02:27:50.340]  and racial justice in the United States of America.
[02:27:50.340 --> 02:27:56.500]  That's what this agenda is all about, because climate change, climate change in our environmental
[02:27:56.500 --> 02:28:05.060]  challenges are one of the biggest existential threats to our way of life.
[02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:08.260]  Not just as a nation, but as a world.
[02:28:08.260 --> 02:28:12.220]  So taxing us more is going to end racism and save the world, am I hearing you right?
[02:28:12.220 --> 02:28:15.020]  We should do it, because we are an example to the world.
[02:28:15.020 --> 02:28:16.740]  That is why we should do it.
[02:28:16.740 --> 02:28:21.060]  And we need to save ourselves, and we can save the rest of the world with us.
[02:28:21.060 --> 02:28:23.980]  That is why we should do it.
[02:28:23.980 --> 02:28:29.260]  This poor woman isn't so far over her head, and she's so ignorant, but she means well,
[02:28:29.260 --> 02:28:31.300]  and she seems so sweet.
[02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:35.140]  It's like watching a three-year-old explain why everybody in the world should get along
[02:28:35.140 --> 02:28:55.140]  with one another.
[02:28:55.140 --> 02:28:57.660]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[02:28:57.660 --> 02:29:00.220]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[02:29:00.220 --> 02:29:05.660]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out
[02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:06.660]  of control.
[02:29:06.660 --> 02:29:10.860]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and
[02:29:10.860 --> 02:29:12.700]  using prescription drugs.
[02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:16.980]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from
[02:29:16.980 --> 02:29:17.980]  me.
[02:29:17.980 --> 02:29:20.980]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:29:20.980 --> 02:29:24.500]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:29:24.500 --> 02:29:27.220]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:29:27.220 --> 02:29:31.980]  Get sober now, your private insurance may cover costs, and we'll get you here.
[02:29:31.980 --> 02:29:32.980]  It's simple.
[02:29:32.980 --> 02:29:35.900]  Just call Elite Rehab Placement right now.
[02:29:35.900 --> 02:29:37.300]  Please, don't wait.
[02:29:37.300 --> 02:29:38.980]  Your life matters to us.
[02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:49.540]  800-213-9264, 800-213-9264, 800-213-9264.
[02:29:49.540 --> 02:30:05.660]  Call right now before it's too late, 800-213-9264.
[02:30:05.660 --> 02:30:12.100]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[02:30:12.100 --> 02:30:17.860]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[02:30:17.860 --> 02:30:22.300]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in
[02:30:22.300 --> 02:30:24.740]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:31.340]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[02:30:31.340 --> 02:30:33.580]  and beyond system in the world.
[02:30:33.580 --> 02:30:36.620]  If there's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[02:30:36.620 --> 02:30:41.180]  It is a total game changer, and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[02:30:41.180 --> 02:30:43.580]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:30:43.580 --> 02:30:44.580]  Warning, though.
[02:30:44.580 --> 02:30:45.580]  It's very, very strong.
[02:30:45.580 --> 02:30:46.580]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[02:30:46.580 --> 02:30:50.740]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce
[02:30:50.740 --> 02:30:53.140]  because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:30:53.140 --> 02:30:56.460]  TurboForce, at M4sLife.com.
[02:30:56.460 --> 02:31:02.300]  At M4s, we're always looking for the very best, best selling, highest rated products
[02:31:02.300 --> 02:31:03.940]  that we can then private label and sell.
[02:31:03.940 --> 02:31:08.820]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that
[02:31:08.820 --> 02:31:14.780]  is the strongest out there, and we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online
[02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:17.540]  than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[02:31:17.540 --> 02:31:22.460]  We also have another product also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[02:31:22.460 --> 02:31:26.660]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.
[02:31:26.660 --> 02:31:32.260]  We're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best selling products right
[02:31:32.260 --> 02:31:35.740]  now at M4sLife.com and M4store.com.
[02:31:35.740 --> 02:31:38.540]  This is a limited time, Immune Boost Special.
[02:31:38.540 --> 02:31:43.940]  It's super blue, silver Immune Gargle and super silver wound dressing for 40% off at
[02:31:43.940 --> 02:31:44.940]  M4store.com.
[02:31:44.940 --> 02:31:48.820]  Again, this is a limited time, Immune Boost Special.
[02:31:48.820 --> 02:31:54.100]  It's super blue, silver Immune Gargle and super silver wound dressing for 40% off at
[02:31:54.100 --> 02:31:56.660]  M4store.com.
[02:31:56.660 --> 02:32:01.820]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:32:01.820 --> 02:32:06.260]  M4Words is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[02:32:06.260 --> 02:32:10.420]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:32:10.420 --> 02:32:13.820]  People say, why would you start a fight with them because they were already dominating and
[02:32:13.820 --> 02:32:18.420]  running America into the ground and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:32:18.420 --> 02:32:20.740]  So we've already had incredible success.
[02:32:20.740 --> 02:32:25.660]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[02:32:25.660 --> 02:32:30.500]  why we've been made the main target and if you financially support us and if you spread
[02:32:30.500 --> 02:32:35.780]  the word about our articles and videos at M4Words.com, we won't just continue to stand
[02:32:35.780 --> 02:32:39.180]  up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[02:32:39.180 --> 02:32:43.820]  We have huge sales at M4Words.com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping
[02:32:43.820 --> 02:32:47.260]  cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce
[02:32:47.260 --> 02:32:49.260]  and you're right to the market.
[02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:52.940]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Glove will swing when.
[02:32:52.940 --> 02:32:58.900]  This is M4Words Darker Sour, we do your support, I'm counting on you.
[02:32:58.900 --> 02:33:19.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:19.020 --> 02:33:35.020]  The raging war on corruption is Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.020 --> 02:33:36.020]  Hi I think you're cute.
[02:33:36.020 --> 02:33:37.020]  I have a girlfriend.
[02:33:37.020 --> 02:33:38.020]  Do you have a side girl though?
[02:33:38.020 --> 02:33:39.020]  No and I don't want one.
[02:33:39.020 --> 02:33:40.020]  Are you sure babe?
[02:33:40.020 --> 02:33:41.020]  Yes.
[02:33:41.020 --> 02:33:42.020]  Stupid pervert.
[02:33:42.020 --> 02:33:43.020]  Urgent.
[02:33:43.020 --> 02:33:48.020]  Right so you're trying to ruin his relationship by having sex with him but he's the pervert.
[02:33:48.020 --> 02:33:49.020]  Sure jam.
[02:33:49.020 --> 02:33:50.020]  You hearty.
[02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:51.020]  How are you cutie?
[02:33:51.020 --> 02:33:52.020]  Huh?
[02:33:52.020 --> 02:33:55.020]  What's a big deal in this if you tell me how the f**k you are?
[02:33:55.020 --> 02:33:58.020]  If you are busy then tell me what does this f**k ignorance mean?
[02:33:58.020 --> 02:33:59.020]  Oh my god.
[02:33:59.020 --> 02:34:00.020]  Let me ask you again.
[02:34:00.020 --> 02:34:01.020]  How are you?
[02:34:01.020 --> 02:34:02.020]  Bye.
[02:34:02.020 --> 02:34:03.020]  What the f**k?
[02:34:03.020 --> 02:34:04.020]  What's wrong with you?
[02:34:04.020 --> 02:34:07.020]  Hey I had a really nice time but we didn't really click.
[02:34:07.020 --> 02:34:08.020]  I'm sorry.
[02:34:08.020 --> 02:34:09.020]  Bet.
[02:34:09.020 --> 02:34:10.020]  Which is slang for okay or sure.
[02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:11.020]  What is bet?
[02:34:11.020 --> 02:34:12.020]  I just googled it.
[02:34:12.020 --> 02:34:14.020]  Seems like a weird response to what I said but okay have a good day.
[02:34:14.020 --> 02:34:16.020]  Not even going to say have a good day back.
[02:34:16.020 --> 02:34:17.020]  You're an a**hole.
[02:34:17.020 --> 02:34:18.020]  What do you reject to do?
[02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:19.020]  Well get over yourself.
[02:34:19.020 --> 02:34:22.020]  This is calling f**k happens that everything works out.
[02:34:22.020 --> 02:34:23.020]  Nigger.
[02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:25.020]  I'm changing my phone number.
[02:34:25.020 --> 02:34:26.020]  Don't ever text me again.
[02:34:26.020 --> 02:34:28.020]  Yeah I don't think that will be necessary.
[02:34:28.020 --> 02:34:30.020]  Watching a film with your girl.
[02:34:30.020 --> 02:34:31.020]  Her.
[02:34:31.020 --> 02:34:32.020]  Oh he's got a nice body.
[02:34:32.020 --> 02:34:33.020]  Look at that smile.
[02:34:33.020 --> 02:34:34.020]  I'd eat him.
[02:34:34.020 --> 02:34:35.020]  Oh my god that laugh.
[02:34:35.020 --> 02:34:37.020]  Be more like him.
[02:34:37.020 --> 02:34:38.020]  Me.
[02:34:38.020 --> 02:34:39.020]  That's a cute flower.
[02:34:39.020 --> 02:34:40.020]  Her.
[02:34:40.020 --> 02:34:41.020]  Go f**k marry it then.
[02:34:41.020 --> 02:34:42.020]  Don't watch films with girls.
[02:34:42.020 --> 02:34:43.020]  You dating Blank?
[02:34:43.020 --> 02:34:44.020]  Yes ma'am.
[02:34:44.020 --> 02:34:45.020]  You know he doesn't like you right?
[02:34:45.020 --> 02:34:46.020]  He's mine.
[02:34:46.020 --> 02:34:50.020]  Oh yikes but we are literally dating so that wouldn't make him mine.
[02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:51.020]  He doesn't know what he wants.
[02:34:51.020 --> 02:34:55.020]  I'm a nice girl and he'll see that you're just an ugly cow with no personality traits.
[02:34:55.020 --> 02:34:57.020]  Hey don't ignore me ugly cow.
[02:34:57.020 --> 02:34:58.020]  Don't ignore me ugly cow.
[02:34:58.020 --> 02:35:00.020]  You're just mad because I'm better than you and you know it.
[02:35:00.020 --> 02:35:03.020]  You know that he'll pick me over you because you're an ugly whore who would do anything
[02:35:03.020 --> 02:35:04.020]  for money.
[02:35:04.020 --> 02:35:05.020]  I see you reading these.
[02:35:05.020 --> 02:35:06.020]  Whatever I'm blocking.
[02:35:06.020 --> 02:35:07.020]  Have a s**t day.
[02:35:07.020 --> 02:35:08.020]  You don't deserve him.
[02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:10.020]  He deserves a nice girl who won't use him for money.
[02:35:10.020 --> 02:35:14.020]  You're so ugly and devoid of personality that he'll come running to me.
[02:35:14.020 --> 02:35:15.020]  Bro I thought you were going to block me.
[02:35:15.020 --> 02:35:16.020]  Goodbye ugly cow.
[02:35:16.020 --> 02:35:18.020]  Hope you get an STD and die.
[02:35:18.020 --> 02:35:21.020]  But remember, she's a nice girl.
[02:35:21.020 --> 02:35:22.020]  Okay wake up.
[02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:23.020]  Hello?
[02:35:23.020 --> 02:35:24.020]  Wow really?
[02:35:24.020 --> 02:35:25.020]  Hello?
[02:35:25.020 --> 02:35:26.020]  What?
[02:35:26.020 --> 02:35:28.020]  You can't reply to any of my previous 5396 messages.
[02:35:28.020 --> 02:35:30.020]  That's how sleeping works.
[02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:31.020]  Hey.
[02:35:31.020 --> 02:35:32.020]  Hey.
[02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:33.020]  Yo.
[02:35:33.020 --> 02:35:34.020]  Why the f**k have you been answering?
[02:35:34.020 --> 02:35:35.020]  I was sleeping?
[02:35:35.020 --> 02:35:37.020]  I know you don't think it's a big deal but you need to f*****g respond when I text you.
[02:35:37.020 --> 02:35:38.020]  Real dick move.
[02:35:38.020 --> 02:35:39.020]  Okay.
[02:35:39.020 --> 02:35:41.020]  You're lucky I ever said yes to dating you.
[02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:43.020]  You need to treat me like the privilege I am.
[02:35:43.020 --> 02:35:45.020]  Yeah I'm going back to bed.
[02:35:45.020 --> 02:35:46.020]  Hi.
[02:35:46.020 --> 02:35:47.020]  Remember me?
[02:35:47.020 --> 02:35:48.020]  Sorry who's this?
[02:35:48.020 --> 02:35:49.020]  It's me.
[02:35:49.020 --> 02:35:50.020]  Oh why are you contacting me?
[02:35:50.020 --> 02:35:51.020]  I don't mean to sound rude.
[02:35:51.020 --> 02:35:52.020]  Just curious.
[02:35:52.020 --> 02:35:53.020]  I want us to get together again.
[02:35:53.020 --> 02:35:54.020]  Sorry but you broke my trust.
[02:35:54.020 --> 02:35:57.020]  I don't feel comfortable being in a relationship with you anymore.
[02:35:57.020 --> 02:35:59.020]  Really bitch what trust did I break?
[02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:03.020]  One you tried to hide the condoms I bought for us because you wanted a baby and I didn't.
[02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:05.020]  Then you cheated on me with blank.
[02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:07.020]  Frankly how am I actually supposed to trust you?
[02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:09.020]  You've broken my trust not once but twice.
[02:36:09.020 --> 02:36:10.020]  F*****g you.
[02:36:10.020 --> 02:36:12.020]  You thought I actually wanted to be in a relationship with you again.
[02:36:12.020 --> 02:36:13.020]  F*****g you can't handle a baby.
[02:36:13.020 --> 02:36:16.020]  Also don't force me not to do things I can f*****g over I want.
[02:36:16.020 --> 02:36:18.020]  I'm exploring my sexuality.
[02:36:18.020 --> 02:36:20.020]  I can't handle a baby because I don't have the expenses.
[02:36:20.020 --> 02:36:22.020]  You know very well of my situation.
[02:36:22.020 --> 02:36:24.020]  With two younger siblings to care for alone.
[02:36:24.020 --> 02:36:27.020]  I don't have money for a third member in the family.
[02:36:27.020 --> 02:36:31.020]  Second go find someone who's okay with you having sex with whomever.
[02:36:31.020 --> 02:36:32.020]  I'm not f*****g you.
[02:36:32.020 --> 02:36:33.020]  You broke s**t.
[02:36:33.020 --> 02:36:34.020]  I hope you die of poverty.
[02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:37.020]  I'll be reporting you and blocking you should you ever contact me again.
[02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:39.020]  You're a sorry excuse of a person.
[02:36:39.020 --> 02:36:40.020]  Don't you contact me again.
[02:36:40.020 --> 02:36:43.020]  Crazy b**ch you started the conversation.
[02:36:43.020 --> 02:36:44.020]  Tinder profile.
[02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:46.020]  Self-employed 5 but 11.
[02:36:46.020 --> 02:36:48.020]  Don't really date any guys smaller than this if we match.
[02:36:48.020 --> 02:36:50.020]  Before you even read my profile and you're sure unmatched.
[02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:51.020]  Very.
[02:36:51.020 --> 02:36:52.020]  I read most of the profiles here.
[02:36:52.020 --> 02:36:54.020]  Well unless you're sure as f*****g lol.
[02:36:54.020 --> 02:36:56.020]  I never judge based on appearances.
[02:36:56.020 --> 02:36:58.020]  But you just said...
[02:36:58.020 --> 02:36:59.020]  Forget it.
[02:36:59.020 --> 02:37:01.020]  A guy asked me out today and I told him no.
[02:37:01.020 --> 02:37:03.020]  But I wanted him to try harder.
[02:37:03.020 --> 02:37:05.020]  Why didn't he try again?
[02:37:05.020 --> 02:37:06.020]  Because he said no.
[02:37:06.020 --> 02:37:08.020]  Who the f*****g Harry Garcia actually don't answer.
[02:37:08.020 --> 02:37:10.020]  I hope she makes you happy.
[02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:11.020]  Dumb b**ch.
[02:37:11.020 --> 02:37:13.020]  I was talking about the ice cream.
[02:37:13.020 --> 02:37:15.020]  To be fair it totally could be a stripper's name.
[02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:16.020]  You doing anything this weekend?
[02:37:16.020 --> 02:37:19.020]  Just going to stay home and study for a bio exam I have on Tuesday.
[02:37:19.020 --> 02:37:20.020]  You?
[02:37:20.020 --> 02:37:21.020]  Can you go to Men's Shoes with me?
[02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:22.020]  It will be like data.
[02:37:22.020 --> 02:37:23.020]  Haha.
[02:37:23.020 --> 02:37:24.020]  But as friends.
[02:37:24.020 --> 02:37:25.020]  I love to but I really need to catch up with some notes.
[02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:27.020]  Sorry maybe some other time.
[02:37:27.020 --> 02:37:29.020]  Why can't you just skip school on Monday and study all day?
[02:37:29.020 --> 02:37:32.020]  Sorry I really don't have that option with this class.
[02:37:32.020 --> 02:37:34.020]  It's too content heavy to study for it overnight.
[02:37:34.020 --> 02:37:36.020]  F*****g you then.
[02:37:36.020 --> 02:37:38.020]  I wanted to help your lonely ass but never mind.
[02:37:38.020 --> 02:37:40.020]  I just picked you because you have a car.
[02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:42.020]  I bet you thought I really wanted to go out with your fat ass.
[02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:44.020]  LMA O O O O O O O O O O O.
[02:37:44.020 --> 02:37:46.020]  You big mad hoe.
[02:37:46.020 --> 02:37:48.020]  And why the f*****g I want to date your nasty ass.
[02:37:48.020 --> 02:37:50.020]  You wish I would date you.
[02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:52.020]  You sucked blank s**t for buying you a whopper.
[02:37:52.020 --> 02:37:54.020]  I prefer not to get close to you.
[02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:55.020]  Blocked.
[02:37:55.020 --> 02:37:59.020]  Oh look it's our favourite ethop doing that retarded I think again.
[02:37:59.020 --> 02:38:03.020]  $2,500 a month Patreon donation.
[02:38:03.020 --> 02:38:04.020]  You are my god.
[02:38:04.020 --> 02:38:05.020]  I couldn't possibly ever thank you enough.
[02:38:05.020 --> 02:38:07.020]  I couldn't possibly think of a good enough reward
[02:38:07.020 --> 02:38:09.020]  for the very best Patreon I will ever have.
[02:38:09.020 --> 02:38:11.020]  If you achieve this tier, please private message me.
[02:38:11.020 --> 02:38:13.020]  I'm not sure what reward I could give you
[02:38:13.020 --> 02:38:14.020]  but we'll talk about it.
[02:38:14.020 --> 02:38:15.020]  I love you.
[02:38:15.020 --> 02:38:18.020]  Right so they banned Sargon for dropping the N word.
[02:38:18.020 --> 02:38:23.020]  Soliciting thousands of dollars for unspecified vague private rewards.
[02:38:23.020 --> 02:38:24.020]  That's just fine.
[02:38:24.020 --> 02:38:27.020]  You play with them balls like it's FIFA.
[02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:28.020]  Hey.
[02:38:28.020 --> 02:38:29.020]  Hey what's up? Long time no talk.
[02:38:29.020 --> 02:38:30.020]  How've you been?
[02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:31.020]  Good. Emily said you broke your leg.
[02:38:31.020 --> 02:38:34.020]  Yeah I was cleaning my gutters and I fell off classic lol.
[02:38:34.020 --> 02:38:35.020]  I really miss talking to you.
[02:38:35.020 --> 02:38:36.020]  We should go on a date.
[02:38:36.020 --> 02:38:38.020]  I'd love to but my leg is really messed up
[02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:40.020]  and I can't leave the house for a few weeks.
[02:38:40.020 --> 02:38:41.020]  Whatever.
[02:38:41.020 --> 02:38:42.020]  I don't even like you anymore.
[02:38:42.020 --> 02:38:44.020]  You're ugly and I hope your leg doesn't get better.
[02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:45.020]  You missed your chance with me buddy.
[02:38:45.020 --> 02:38:46.020]  Okay.
[02:38:46.020 --> 02:38:47.020]  Have a nice life.
[02:38:47.020 --> 02:38:50.020]  Even with a broken leg, dude managed to dodge a bullet.
[02:38:50.020 --> 02:38:51.020]  Respect.
[02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:54.020]  Swapping right to me means that you're down for a dinner date.
[02:38:54.020 --> 02:38:56.020]  I honestly feel so bad for your mum to be honest.
[02:38:56.020 --> 02:38:58.020]  The poor woman really laid in bed and let your dad pound her.
[02:38:58.020 --> 02:38:59.020]  Must be herpes bam.
[02:38:59.020 --> 02:39:01.020]  Like a construction site.
[02:39:01.020 --> 02:39:04.020]  Then planted his seeds in a koochie.
[02:39:04.020 --> 02:39:06.020]  And those seeds raced to the eggs in a uterus
[02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:07.020]  and have the millions of sperms.
[02:39:07.020 --> 02:39:09.020]  It was your unfortunate ugly ass sperm
[02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:11.020]  that won the game and fertilized the egg.
[02:39:11.020 --> 02:39:13.020]  Then your bitch of a mum had to go through
[02:39:13.020 --> 02:39:15.020]  nine months of struggle of back aches
[02:39:15.020 --> 02:39:17.020]  and nausea and pregnancy cravings
[02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:20.020]  to end up going to labor to push out a deformed gorilla
[02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:23.020]  with a pothole fat nose and a shiny ass forehead
[02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:26.020]  out of a gaping vagina that invests time and energy
[02:39:26.020 --> 02:39:28.020]  in making tinder profiles to send
[02:39:28.020 --> 02:39:31.020]  s***ing corny pitiful ass pickup lines to bitches on tinder
[02:39:31.020 --> 02:39:33.020]  just so he could score some b***y.
[02:39:33.020 --> 02:39:36.020]  I have to laugh.
[02:39:36.020 --> 02:39:38.020]  A simple no would have sufficed.
[02:39:38.020 --> 02:39:40.020]  So my boyfriend is really into rapping.
[02:39:40.020 --> 02:39:41.020]  Like really into all that s***.
[02:39:41.020 --> 02:39:43.020]  Honestly a great rapper and can sing quite well.
[02:39:43.020 --> 02:39:44.020]  He goes on and on about how it's his dream
[02:39:44.020 --> 02:39:46.020]  to become a famous rapper someday.
[02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:48.020]  He has a soundcloud where he currently uploads music there
[02:39:48.020 --> 02:39:50.020]  but they haven't gained much traction.
[02:39:50.020 --> 02:39:52.020]  A couple of days ago though he called me all excited and s***
[02:39:52.020 --> 02:39:54.020]  saying he was going to go on one of those music shows.
[02:39:54.020 --> 02:39:56.020]  The voice or American Idol got talent or some s***.
[02:39:56.020 --> 02:39:58.020]  I had no clue he even auditioned.
[02:39:58.020 --> 02:40:00.020]  As soon as I heard the news I got nervous.
[02:40:00.020 --> 02:40:02.020]  Like what if he really makes it big because of this?
[02:40:02.020 --> 02:40:04.020]  I know the reputation of rappers.
[02:40:04.020 --> 02:40:05.020]  They're famous for having a bunch of hoes
[02:40:05.020 --> 02:40:07.020]  and cheating on their girlfriends and s***.
[02:40:07.020 --> 02:40:09.020]  What if he makes it big and leaves me for some ho?
[02:40:09.020 --> 02:40:11.020]  I can't let that happen.
[02:40:11.020 --> 02:40:13.020]  I love him too much.
[02:40:13.020 --> 02:40:15.020]  So I did something that any loving girlfriend would do.
[02:40:15.020 --> 02:40:17.020]  I told him I was pregnant.
[02:40:17.020 --> 02:40:19.020]  He can't go off to have a huge career if he has a baby.
[02:40:19.020 --> 02:40:22.020]  Of course he was very shook and saw the disbelief
[02:40:22.020 --> 02:40:23.020]  when I told him lol.
[02:40:23.020 --> 02:40:25.020]  But I did what's best for our relationship.
[02:40:25.020 --> 02:40:27.020]  I don't want to lose him.
[02:40:27.020 --> 02:40:28.020]  After a lot of hours talking and convincing
[02:40:28.020 --> 02:40:30.020]  he finally agreed to not go to the show.
[02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:32.020]  I can tell he was very upset about it
[02:40:32.020 --> 02:40:34.020]  but I know this will be better for us.
[02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:37.020]  He agreed to put his full focus on me and the baby lol.
[02:40:37.020 --> 02:40:39.020]  He's such a good guy.
[02:40:39.020 --> 02:40:40.020]  I honestly feel kind of bad.
[02:40:40.020 --> 02:40:42.020]  But he can do that rapid s*** later.
[02:40:42.020 --> 02:40:43.020]  He needs to focus on us.
[02:40:43.020 --> 02:40:45.020]  Not trying to become famous and leave me.
[02:40:45.020 --> 02:40:47.020]  Obviously I'll tell him I'm not actually pregnant.
[02:40:47.020 --> 02:40:50.020]  I'll just wait a couple of months and claim I had a miscarriage or something.
[02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:52.020]  I don't think what I did was wrong.
[02:40:52.020 --> 02:40:54.020]  I was looking out for our relationship.
[02:40:54.020 --> 02:40:56.020]  Man should choose some potential career over the loved one.
[02:40:56.020 --> 02:40:59.020]  Lying to him, crushing his one big opportunity
[02:40:59.020 --> 02:41:00.020]  and ruining his dreams
[02:41:00.020 --> 02:41:03.020]  because you're an insecure jealous b***h.
[02:41:03.020 --> 02:41:05.020]  Hashtag perfect girlfriend.
[02:41:05.020 --> 02:41:06.020]  Men are like Bluetooth.
[02:41:06.020 --> 02:41:08.020]  He's connected to you when you're nearby
[02:41:08.020 --> 02:41:10.020]  but searches for other devices when you are away.
[02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:12.020]  Women are like Wi-Fi.
[02:41:12.020 --> 02:41:14.020]  She sees all available devices
[02:41:14.020 --> 02:41:16.020]  but connects to the strongest one.
[02:41:16.020 --> 02:41:18.020]  Bluetooth can only connect to one device at a time
[02:41:18.020 --> 02:41:20.020]  and would need confirmation from both devices
[02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:22.020]  to connect successfully.
[02:41:22.020 --> 02:41:24.020]  Wi-Fi connects to multiple devices
[02:41:24.020 --> 02:41:26.020]  and can be set without a password.
[02:41:26.020 --> 02:41:29.020]  Wi-Fi is the hoe of the 2.4 gigahertz band.
[02:41:29.020 --> 02:41:31.020]  So this girl who a guy dumped
[02:41:31.020 --> 02:41:32.020]  saw him on New Year's Eve
[02:41:32.020 --> 02:41:34.020]  threw a glass at his head
[02:41:34.020 --> 02:41:56.020]  and then sent this message.
[02:41:56.020 --> 02:42:05.020]  It was all done through intoxication.
[02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:06.020]  Happy New Year, Laura.
[02:42:06.020 --> 02:42:08.020]  I wish you the best for 2019.
[02:42:08.020 --> 02:42:09.020]  Yeah, you did deserve it.
[02:42:09.020 --> 02:42:11.020]  F*** you.
[02:42:11.020 --> 02:42:13.020]  Being with someone who likes to throw glasses at your head
[02:42:13.020 --> 02:42:15.020]  while being surrounded by glasses
[02:42:15.020 --> 02:42:17.020]  probably not the best idea.
[02:42:17.020 --> 02:42:18.020]  You're such a dad.
[02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:19.020]  LMAO.
[02:42:19.020 --> 02:42:20.020]  I'm a cute daddy, wink face.
[02:42:20.020 --> 02:42:22.020]  I have a boyfriend.
[02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:23.020]  Save that.
[02:42:23.020 --> 02:42:24.020]  I'll do f*** you.
[02:42:24.020 --> 02:42:26.020]  I'm going to see him to see that when he goes through my phone.
[02:42:26.020 --> 02:42:28.020]  So he's going through your phone
[02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:29.020]  and you're cheating on him?
[02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:30.020]  Yeah.
[02:42:30.020 --> 02:42:31.020]  Your relationship is less secure
[02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:33.020]  than a Venezuelan's bank savings.
[02:42:33.020 --> 02:42:34.020]  Message from a girl
[02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:36.020]  who this guy met once in college.
[02:42:36.020 --> 02:42:37.020]  Do you want to hang out with me tonight, babe?
[02:42:37.020 --> 02:42:38.020]  Sorry, I'm busy today.
[02:42:38.020 --> 02:42:39.020]  Maybe next time.
[02:42:39.020 --> 02:42:40.020]  Wow!
[02:42:40.020 --> 02:42:41.020]  Wow!
[02:42:41.020 --> 02:42:43.020]  I've never been rejected in my entire life.
[02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:44.020]  Who the hell do you think you are?
[02:42:44.020 --> 02:42:45.020]  I'm the best girl you'll ever know.
[02:42:45.020 --> 02:42:46.020]  You don't even talk much.
[02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:48.020]  I approach you because you were very lonely
[02:42:48.020 --> 02:42:49.020]  and I feel bad for you.
[02:42:49.020 --> 02:42:50.020]  And now you're going to dump me.
[02:42:50.020 --> 02:42:52.020]  You're only girl you will ever talk to.
[02:42:52.020 --> 02:42:54.020]  Yeah, so...
[02:42:54.020 --> 02:42:55.020]  I'm the f***ing gay-to-dude.

[02:46:04.020 --> 02:46:06.020]  Well, there is a national company
[02:46:06.020 --> 02:46:09.020]  who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel.

[02:46:15.020 --> 02:46:18.020]  than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[02:46:18.020 --> 02:46:19.020]  We also have another product
[02:46:19.020 --> 02:46:21.020]  also produced by the same company,

[02:46:23.020 --> 02:46:25.020]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel
[02:46:25.020 --> 02:46:27.020]  and a lot of the Immune Gargle.

[02:46:29.020 --> 02:46:31.020]  to 40% off on both of these

[02:47:17.020 --> 02:47:18.020]  Defending the Republic
[02:47:18.020 --> 02:47:21.020]  from enemies, born and domestic.
[02:47:21.020 --> 02:47:24.020]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:31.020 --> 02:47:33.020]  We are back live broadcasting.
[02:47:33.020 --> 02:47:36.020]  We're a lot about to go to your phone calls.
[02:47:36.020 --> 02:47:37.020]  But we put a little piece together
[02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:39.020]  with Johnny Carson
[02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:41.020]  30-something years ago
[02:47:41.020 --> 02:47:43.020]  being asked, why don't you get political?
[02:47:43.020 --> 02:47:45.020]  Why don't you go up there and use your power
[02:47:45.020 --> 02:47:48.020]  back then having like 40, 50 million viewers a night?
[02:47:48.020 --> 02:47:50.020]  Wow, nobody has anything near that for decades
[02:47:50.020 --> 02:47:52.020]  except the Super Bowl.
[02:47:52.020 --> 02:47:54.020]  And he explained why he did that.
[02:47:54.020 --> 02:47:56.020]  And of course, radio listeners will hear his voice,
[02:47:56.020 --> 02:47:58.020]  but the video is particularly haunting
[02:47:58.020 --> 02:47:59.020]  because as he's speaking,
[02:47:59.020 --> 02:48:00.020]  we're looking at Stephen Colbert
[02:48:00.020 --> 02:48:03.020]  and all these other people that are fake news,
[02:48:03.020 --> 02:48:05.020]  hide behind being comedians,
[02:48:05.020 --> 02:48:08.020]  but then pose as real news
[02:48:08.020 --> 02:48:10.020]  and then say that I'm a KKK member
[02:48:10.020 --> 02:48:12.020]  when it's not true.
[02:48:12.020 --> 02:48:15.020]  This is a really, really nasty, nasty system
[02:48:15.020 --> 02:48:17.020]  and it's of course killed the ratings
[02:48:17.020 --> 02:48:19.020]  of late night comedy. Here it is.
[02:48:19.020 --> 02:48:23.020]  Do you get sensitive about the fact that people say
[02:48:23.020 --> 02:48:26.020]  he'll never take a serious controversy?
[02:48:26.020 --> 02:48:28.020]  Well, I have an answer to that.
[02:48:28.020 --> 02:48:31.020]  I said, now tell me the last time that Jack Benny,
[02:48:31.020 --> 02:48:33.020]  Red Skelton,
[02:48:33.020 --> 02:48:36.020]  Benny Comedian,
[02:48:36.020 --> 02:48:38.020]  used his show to do serious issues.
[02:48:38.020 --> 02:48:41.020]  That's not what I'm there for, can't they see that?
[02:48:41.020 --> 02:48:43.020]  But you're neither, they think that just because
[02:48:43.020 --> 02:48:45.020]  you have a tonight show that you must deal
[02:48:45.020 --> 02:48:48.020]  in serious issues, that's a danger.
[02:48:48.020 --> 02:48:51.020]  It's a real danger. Once you start that,
[02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:53.020]  you start to get that self-important feeling
[02:48:53.020 --> 02:48:55.020]  that's what you say has great import.
[02:48:55.020 --> 02:48:57.020]  And you know, strangely enough,
[02:48:57.020 --> 02:48:58.020]  you could use that show as a forum,
[02:48:58.020 --> 02:48:59.020]  you could sway people,
[02:48:59.020 --> 02:49:01.020]  and I don't think you should as an entertainer.
[02:49:09.020 --> 02:49:12.020]  We're taking your phone calls right now
[02:49:12.020 --> 02:49:14.020]  and behind the scenes there's some incredible stuff
[02:49:14.020 --> 02:49:17.020]  going on, very positive, very negative.
[02:49:17.020 --> 02:49:19.020]  A big mix of the two, just please remember,
[02:49:19.020 --> 02:49:22.020]  thank you all for your support, thank you for your prayers.
[02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:24.020]  The globalist, Hillary Soros,
[02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:27.020]  and their criminal combines work around the clock
[02:49:27.020 --> 02:49:29.020]  to try to shut this broadcast down
[02:49:29.020 --> 02:49:32.020]  and try to stop you being able to spread the word about it.
[02:49:32.020 --> 02:49:34.020]  But on your email, on your text message,
[02:49:34.020 --> 02:49:36.020]  and word of mouth telling people,
[02:49:36.020 --> 02:49:38.020]  infowars.com,
[02:49:38.020 --> 02:49:41.020]  the live feeds, the audio, the video,
[02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:44.020]  the reports we put out are incredible.
[02:49:44.020 --> 02:49:48.020]  And the globalists see it as critical to shut us down
[02:49:48.020 --> 02:49:50.020]  so that they can carry out their world government program.
[02:49:50.020 --> 02:49:52.020]  I'm going to go back to your calls,
[02:49:52.020 --> 02:49:54.020]  but just please remember, we're running specials
[02:49:54.020 --> 02:49:56.020]  that end this weekend, 50% off,
[02:49:56.020 --> 02:49:58.020]  Rainforest Plus are amazing to Tropic.
[02:49:58.020 --> 02:50:01.020]  When you get it with Turboforce,
[02:50:01.020 --> 02:50:04.020]  our latest total body energy pre-workout,
[02:50:04.020 --> 02:50:06.020]  10-hour energy, beyond energy drinks,
[02:50:06.020 --> 02:50:08.020]  whatever you want to call it,
[02:50:08.020 --> 02:50:11.020]  it's amazing, infowarslife.com,
[02:50:11.020 --> 02:50:16.020]  infowarsstore.com, or triple-eight-two-five-three-three-one-three-nine.
[02:50:16.020 --> 02:50:21.020]  We also have all the rage, bone broth.
[02:50:21.020 --> 02:50:24.020]  Most stuff you buy at Whole Foods is like a little mason jar.
[02:50:24.020 --> 02:50:26.020]  It's like 10 bucks.
[02:50:26.020 --> 02:50:29.020]  It has like one mushroom in it and a half a scoop of bone broth,
[02:50:29.020 --> 02:50:31.020]  and it talks about all the great things
[02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:33.020]  that chaga mushroom and bee pollen do, which is great.
[02:50:33.020 --> 02:50:34.020]  I'm sure it does help you.
[02:50:34.020 --> 02:50:36.020]  This is chaga mushroom.
[02:50:36.020 --> 02:50:38.020]  This is highest quality bee pollen.
[02:50:38.020 --> 02:50:40.020]  This is the amazing turmeric,
[02:50:40.020 --> 02:50:44.020]  and then the bone broth from organic chicken boiled down,
[02:50:44.020 --> 02:50:47.020]  and one scoop of this, I'd mix it in with whey,
[02:50:47.020 --> 02:50:50.020]  mix it in with some milk, mix it in with some berries.
[02:50:50.020 --> 02:50:52.020]  Then it tastes pretty good by itself.
[02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:55.020]  You know, just gulp it down for collagen, for bones,
[02:50:55.020 --> 02:50:57.020]  for stamina, for everything.
[02:50:57.020 --> 02:51:00.020]  Leading brands are 60, 70 bucks for stuff that isn't as strong.
[02:51:00.020 --> 02:51:02.020]  This is normally $39.95.
[02:51:02.020 --> 02:51:05.020]  It's 50% off, $19.95.
[02:51:05.020 --> 02:51:06.020]  It was sold out for months.
[02:51:06.020 --> 02:51:07.020]  We got a big shipment back in.
[02:51:07.020 --> 02:51:10.020]  I want you to experience how great ultimate bone broth is today
[02:51:10.020 --> 02:51:12.020]  at MFullWarsLife.com.
[02:51:12.020 --> 02:51:14.020]  You'll notice it's one of the products
[02:51:14.020 --> 02:51:16.020]  mainstream media demonizes and attacks all the time
[02:51:16.020 --> 02:51:17.020]  because they know how important it is.
[02:51:17.020 --> 02:51:19.020]  Fee-fie, faux-fum.
[02:51:19.020 --> 02:51:21.020]  I smell the blood of an Englishman.
[02:51:21.020 --> 02:51:23.020]  Be he alive or be he dead,
[02:51:23.020 --> 02:51:25.020]  I'll ground his bones to make my bread.
[02:51:25.020 --> 02:51:27.020]  Until the 50s or so,
[02:51:27.020 --> 02:51:29.020]  people bake their own bread, most areas.
[02:51:29.020 --> 02:51:31.020]  You can still do some store-bought.
[02:51:31.020 --> 02:51:33.020]  And you ground up the beef and the chicken bones.
[02:51:33.020 --> 02:51:35.020]  I mean, mom would be in there,
[02:51:35.020 --> 02:51:37.020]  putting it into a grinder, hand grinder,
[02:51:37.020 --> 02:51:39.020]  the chicken bone or the beef bone,
[02:51:39.020 --> 02:51:41.020]  and then mixing it in with the bread,
[02:51:41.020 --> 02:51:43.020]  because that's what everybody did,
[02:51:43.020 --> 02:51:44.020]  because you just knew, because it had the minerals
[02:51:44.020 --> 02:51:45.020]  and everything in it.
[02:51:45.020 --> 02:51:47.020]  That's where it would concentrate in.
[02:51:47.020 --> 02:51:49.020]  Well, the fields are depleted,
[02:51:49.020 --> 02:51:50.020]  the minerals are depleted,
[02:51:50.020 --> 02:51:52.020]  the cofactors are depleted,
[02:51:52.020 --> 02:51:54.020]  and nobody's grinding up bone anymore
[02:51:54.020 --> 02:51:56.020]  in there.
[02:51:56.020 --> 02:51:58.020]  So it's right here, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:51:58.020 --> 02:52:00.020]  MFullWarsLife.com,
[02:52:00.020 --> 02:52:02.020]  MFullWarsStore.com, take action today.
[02:52:02.020 --> 02:52:04.020]  Thank you all for your support, but whatever you do,
[02:52:04.020 --> 02:52:06.020]  I thank you for your prayers.
[02:52:06.020 --> 02:52:07.020]  That's number one.
[02:52:07.020 --> 02:52:08.020]  Please spread the word,
[02:52:08.020 --> 02:52:10.020]  and the number three support is financially,
[02:52:10.020 --> 02:52:12.020]  and please support the local stations as well.
[02:52:12.020 --> 02:52:14.020]  They're very, very important.
[02:52:14.020 --> 02:52:16.020]  Okay, who's been holding the longest here?
[02:52:16.020 --> 02:52:18.020]  Darren.
[02:52:18.020 --> 02:52:20.020]  After that, we got William.
[02:52:20.020 --> 02:52:22.020]  It was actually a little bit longer.
[02:52:22.020 --> 02:52:24.020]  And then Don Tay.
[02:52:24.020 --> 02:52:25.020]  Let's go to William and then Don Tay.
[02:52:25.020 --> 02:52:26.020]  William in Oregon.
[02:52:26.020 --> 02:52:28.020]  Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[02:52:28.020 --> 02:52:30.020]  Hey, Alex.
[02:52:30.020 --> 02:52:31.020]  It's good to finally talk to you.
[02:52:31.020 --> 02:52:33.020]  I've been listening to you for a long time.
[02:52:33.020 --> 02:52:35.020]  Thank you.
[02:52:35.020 --> 02:52:38.020]  You know, you had asked earlier about Robert Mueller,
[02:52:38.020 --> 02:52:41.020]  but it's been so long.
[02:52:41.020 --> 02:52:43.020]  I'll go ahead and mention the point that I had,
[02:52:43.020 --> 02:52:45.020]  and then there were some blessings that I'd like to offer you,
[02:52:45.020 --> 02:52:48.020]  because there's just some crazy stuff going on in the world.
[02:52:48.020 --> 02:52:51.020]  You know, things are really spiritually moving.
[02:52:51.020 --> 02:52:53.020]  I see what's been going on in your show.
[02:52:53.020 --> 02:52:56.020]  You guys have been talking about things moving spiritually,
[02:52:56.020 --> 02:52:59.020]  and also things that are happening are connected.
[02:52:59.020 --> 02:53:04.020]  And you can barely talk about one subject without talking about,
[02:53:04.020 --> 02:53:07.020]  you know, touching on 50 other subjects.
[02:53:07.020 --> 02:53:10.020]  And so, you know, you're talking about Mueller and what he's doing
[02:53:10.020 --> 02:53:12.020]  and stuff like that.
[02:53:12.020 --> 02:53:15.020]  He is way beyond his own authority.
[02:53:15.020 --> 02:53:20.020]  You know, he had a lot of autonomy to operate when he got started,
[02:53:20.020 --> 02:53:25.020]  but now he's very clearly stepped beyond the bounds of his investigation,
[02:53:25.020 --> 02:53:28.020]  and all that's left is for him to be stopped,
[02:53:28.020 --> 02:53:31.020]  because he is, like you said, you know,
[02:53:31.020 --> 02:53:34.020]  ironically, you talked about the three-stage MIRV weapons.
[02:53:34.020 --> 02:53:36.020]  Well, I was in the submarine force in the Navy,
[02:53:36.020 --> 02:53:39.020]  and I worked on weapons very, very similar to that.
[02:53:39.020 --> 02:53:41.020]  I know exactly how their mission operates.
[02:53:41.020 --> 02:53:44.020]  They go to a target, and they kill that target.
[02:53:44.020 --> 02:53:45.020]  That is what Mueller is doing.
[02:53:45.020 --> 02:53:48.020]  He is out to kill Trump.
[02:53:48.020 --> 02:53:52.020]  I don't know about physically or spiritually or any of that other stuff.
[02:53:52.020 --> 02:53:55.020]  No, he's on a seek and destroy mission.
[02:53:55.020 --> 02:53:57.020]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:53:57.020 --> 02:54:00.020]  He is not going to stop unless he is stopped.
[02:54:00.020 --> 02:54:01.020]  That's how these things work.
[02:54:01.020 --> 02:54:04.020]  He's a weapon, and he's being used against this country.
[02:54:04.020 --> 02:54:11.020]  And I am just sick of people in our Congress just playing foot with Democrats
[02:54:11.020 --> 02:54:13.020]  who are saying...
[02:54:13.020 --> 02:54:16.020]  That's because they're all keeping their heads down.
[02:54:16.020 --> 02:54:20.020]  We have opened socialists in our government now.
[02:54:20.020 --> 02:54:21.020]  It's insane.
[02:54:21.020 --> 02:54:23.020]  They're trying to collapse our border, William.
[02:54:23.020 --> 02:54:24.020]  You're absolutely right.
[02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:26.020]  It's just mind-blowing that we've gone this far.
[02:54:26.020 --> 02:54:28.020]  They're trying to end the First Amendment.
[02:54:28.020 --> 02:54:31.020]  They're taking bank accounts away of thousands of prominent conservatives,
[02:54:31.020 --> 02:54:34.020]  and Congress does nothing.
[02:54:34.020 --> 02:54:36.020]  Exactly, and why?
[02:54:36.020 --> 02:54:38.020]  Why are they sitting on their hands?
[02:54:38.020 --> 02:54:39.020]  Why do we have cowards?
[02:54:39.020 --> 02:54:41.020]  Why have we elected these people into office?
[02:54:41.020 --> 02:54:45.020]  We have this corruption in our election system going on,
[02:54:45.020 --> 02:54:48.020]  so we are powerless to do anything.
[02:54:48.020 --> 02:54:52.020]  That is our one voice, and they have taken it away from us.
[02:54:52.020 --> 02:54:56.020]  Well, they can't stop you from spreading the word and doing your own broadcasts,
[02:54:56.020 --> 02:54:57.020]  but I agree, brother.
[02:54:57.020 --> 02:54:58.020]  We're two minutes to midnight.
[02:54:58.020 --> 02:54:59.020]  Thank you, William.
[02:54:59.020 --> 02:55:00.020]  Amazing points.
[02:55:00.020 --> 02:55:02.020]  Dante in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:55:02.020 --> 02:55:03.020]  Thanks for holding.
[02:55:03.020 --> 02:55:04.020]  Go ahead.
[02:55:04.020 --> 02:55:05.020]  How's it going?
[02:55:05.020 --> 02:55:06.020]  Good, brother.
[02:55:06.020 --> 02:55:08.020]  Okay, I just got one thing to bring up.
[02:55:08.020 --> 02:55:11.020]  I know Trump's got to stop playing defense and playing their game.
[02:55:11.020 --> 02:55:15.020]  He's got to address the national emergency to secure the border, first of all,
[02:55:15.020 --> 02:55:18.020]  but there's pre-dominos that need to fall afterwards.
[02:55:18.020 --> 02:55:23.020]  First thing is to remove the censorship he needs to take out antitrust against Big Tech,
[02:55:23.020 --> 02:55:25.020]  try and break up some of those monopolies.
[02:55:25.020 --> 02:55:29.020]  Secondly, he needs to declassify that visa and shift the focus back on them
[02:55:29.020 --> 02:55:31.020]  and make them play defense for a change.
[02:55:31.020 --> 02:55:32.020]  Yes.
[02:55:32.020 --> 02:55:34.020]  Lastly, he needs to get Whitaker on Mueller.
[02:55:34.020 --> 02:55:36.020]  He needs to sick him on Mueller like Mueller's been sick on him.
[02:55:36.020 --> 02:55:42.020]  He needs to create a special counsel investigating the entire Russiagate situation from Uranium One.
[02:55:42.020 --> 02:55:48.020]  Once they blow that open, maybe we'll get some more of populist uprising again
[02:55:48.020 --> 02:55:50.020]  and get the socialist stuff out of here.
[02:55:50.020 --> 02:55:53.020]  I agree with anything else.
[02:55:53.020 --> 02:55:58.020]  I was just firing off my points pretty quick, but yeah, that's pretty much it for me.
[02:55:58.020 --> 02:56:02.020]  Like the last guy said, it's a spiritual thing and I sense the spirit.
[02:56:02.020 --> 02:56:04.020]  I understand as Christians, you want to turn the other cheek,
[02:56:04.020 --> 02:56:06.020]  but there comes a point where we got to stand our ground.
[02:56:06.020 --> 02:56:07.020]  Absolutely.
[02:56:07.020 --> 02:56:08.020]  God bless you.
[02:56:08.020 --> 02:56:10.020]  Darren in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:56:10.020 --> 02:56:11.020]  Thanks for holding.
[02:56:11.020 --> 02:56:13.020]  Go ahead.
[02:56:13.020 --> 02:56:19.020]  Well, Alex, first of all, I don't think the American people are going to do anything about anything.
[02:56:19.020 --> 02:56:21.020]  I mean, look what the government has done so far.
[02:56:21.020 --> 02:56:22.020]  They ain't done nothing.
[02:56:22.020 --> 02:56:27.020]  And the second of all, I find it amazing how when the Bushes visited the White House the next day,
[02:56:27.020 --> 02:56:32.020]  they came out with this new prosecutor and then, you know,
[02:56:32.020 --> 02:56:38.020]  he's part of the cover up of what happened back during the 80s around Contra and all that stuff.
[02:56:38.020 --> 02:56:46.020]  And then lastly, you know, you and Stone, you kind of like, you guys make like a show of the president.
[02:56:46.020 --> 02:56:51.020]  You're watching them get raised around him and then you guys just make a show of it.
[02:56:51.020 --> 02:56:52.020]  You guys got his number.
[02:56:52.020 --> 02:56:53.020]  You can call him.
[02:56:53.020 --> 02:56:54.020]  You can call people.
[02:56:54.020 --> 02:56:56.020]  No, I haven't talked to Trump in a long, long time.
[02:56:56.020 --> 02:56:59.020]  Well, some, I mean, Stone knows people.
[02:56:59.020 --> 02:57:01.020]  Stone knows where the bodies are buried.
[02:57:01.020 --> 02:57:04.020]  Well, no, we're trying to put Stone in prison right now.
[02:57:04.020 --> 02:57:09.020]  But I know that, but you know what? Stone, Stone saw it coming and he could have said, hey, Mr. President,
[02:57:09.020 --> 02:57:10.020]  they're coming after everybody.
[02:57:10.020 --> 02:57:12.020]  You need to do something.
[02:57:12.020 --> 02:57:13.020]  He has said that.
[02:57:13.020 --> 02:57:14.020]  He has said that.
[02:57:14.020 --> 02:57:17.020]  I think we don't have these magical powers described to us.
[02:57:17.020 --> 02:57:18.020]  But I hear what you're saying, Darren.
[02:57:18.020 --> 02:57:20.020]  It's a serious situation.
[02:57:20.020 --> 02:57:23.020]  Owen Benjamin is coming up and I don't want to cut in his time.
[02:57:23.020 --> 02:57:27.020]  So Mike, Gary, Luke and Sue, I apologize for not getting to you.
[02:57:27.020 --> 02:57:29.020]  We'll get to you if you call back in tomorrow.
[02:57:29.020 --> 02:57:31.020]  I promise love open phones are going to the war room today.

[03:00:11.020 --> 03:00:15.020]  Hi there.
[03:00:15.020 --> 03:00:17.020]  What's up everybody?
[03:00:17.020 --> 03:00:21.020]  It's me, Owen Benjamin reporting from a Soviet gulag.
[03:00:21.020 --> 03:00:22.020]  I'm just kidding.
[03:00:22.020 --> 03:00:23.020]  It's where I live.
[03:00:23.020 --> 03:00:24.020]  I'm in Washington state.
[03:00:24.020 --> 03:00:27.020]  We got hit pretty hard with a lot of snow.
[03:00:27.020 --> 03:00:32.020]  And one of my Russian friends actually said that if your flaps are down, it means you're gay.
[03:00:32.020 --> 03:00:36.020]  So I guess you're supposed to go like this to show you're not gay.
[03:00:36.020 --> 03:00:40.020]  But I think that dude lost his ears.
[03:00:40.020 --> 03:00:43.020]  Pretty gay to not have any ears.
[03:00:43.020 --> 03:00:44.020]  All right.
[03:00:44.020 --> 03:00:47.020]  So today we're going to talk about a lot of fun stuff.
[03:00:47.020 --> 03:00:51.020]  First off, I guess I now have a mustache.
[03:00:51.020 --> 03:00:56.020]  I'll tell you why I have a mustache because one, it turns on my wife a lot.
[03:00:56.020 --> 03:01:08.020]  And two, I realized how much mustaches have been associated with pornography and vans and creeps
[03:01:08.020 --> 03:01:15.020]  and I think that there's something going on with it because their mustaches are just queer masculinity authority.
[03:01:15.020 --> 03:01:18.020]  You know, someone's got a game plan.
[03:01:18.020 --> 03:01:24.020]  So when I just grew this stash for like a day or two and everywhere I went, there'd just be people like,
[03:01:24.020 --> 03:01:29.020]  look, mommy, that man makes pornography videos.
[03:01:29.020 --> 03:01:32.020]  And I'm like, what?
[03:01:32.020 --> 03:01:36.020]  That's not even there was like one porn star with a mustache.
[03:01:36.020 --> 03:01:39.020]  Not Jeremy. He's also like four foot five.
[03:01:39.020 --> 03:01:41.020]  He's three Rogan's tall.
[03:01:41.020 --> 03:01:44.020]  Joe Rogan's a unit of measurements, by the way.
[03:01:44.020 --> 03:01:51.020]  Now, Joe Rogan, he he's he belongs in a shoe and he's lying to you.
[03:01:51.020 --> 03:01:59.020]  So anyway, if you want to just understand a little, a little taste of the stash and what the stash is really about.
[03:01:59.020 --> 03:02:02.020]  Here's just a little window into my life from yesterday.
[03:02:02.020 --> 03:02:07.020]  A little video called a man with a mustache and a plan.
[03:02:07.020 --> 03:02:11.020]  Why don't you go ahead and check this one out? Good times.
[03:02:11.020 --> 03:02:12.020]  Yeah.
[03:02:12.020 --> 03:02:13.020]  What do you need?
[03:02:13.020 --> 03:02:42.020]  I'm going to go get some mustache wax.
[03:02:42.020 --> 03:03:00.020]  I'm on a brand new ATV that I had to get because my we're still snowed in that I can't go anywhere.
[03:03:00.020 --> 03:03:09.020]  I'm just cruising around with my sweet Russian hat and a mustache and there's snow being stuck to my mustache and my eyebrows.
[03:03:09.020 --> 03:03:15.020]  And it's just a good time and I ended up not getting what my wife wanted or mustache wax.
[03:03:15.020 --> 03:03:20.020]  I completely failed the mission, but my upper lip was very warm.
[03:03:20.020 --> 03:03:28.020]  So all I'm trying to say is the thing about the mustache and then in the next few segments, we'll talk about some more pressing things.
[03:03:28.020 --> 03:03:30.020]  Heavy stuff.
[03:03:30.020 --> 03:03:34.020]  You know, the opposite of Rogan, he's not heavy. He's very light.
[03:03:34.020 --> 03:03:36.020]  Very small man.
[03:03:36.020 --> 03:03:38.020]  He's technically one Rogan tall.
[03:03:38.020 --> 03:03:40.020]  I wonder if he changes height.
[03:03:40.020 --> 03:03:42.020]  We changed the whole unit of measurement.
[03:03:42.020 --> 03:03:47.020]  But this this segment, I just wanted to talk to you guys about the mustache and and all the baggage that comes with it.
[03:03:47.020 --> 03:03:56.020]  But here's the thing was once you grow it and it gets thick enough, you no longer hear, mommy, look, that man makes porno videos.
[03:03:56.020 --> 03:03:59.020]  Instead, everybody looks at you for directions.
[03:03:59.020 --> 03:04:02.020]  You know, at first they have a look of fear, but then relief.
[03:04:02.020 --> 03:04:04.020]  They're like, tell us what to do.
[03:04:04.020 --> 03:04:05.020]  What's the game plan?
[03:04:05.020 --> 03:04:11.020]  You know, because there's a real sense of like a man is finally here.
[03:04:11.020 --> 03:04:13.020]  It's not a joke.
[03:04:13.020 --> 03:04:15.020]  It's not a hipster irony.
[03:04:15.020 --> 03:04:18.020]  You know, like all these hipsters, they're subverting everything.
[03:04:18.020 --> 03:04:21.020]  That's why I'm starting to hate sarcasm.
[03:04:21.020 --> 03:04:28.020]  Maybe next segment, we'll do the Chinese person talking to the Jew and we'll see the difference between sarcasm and non sarcasm.
[03:04:28.020 --> 03:04:31.020]  But anyway, there's nothing sarcastic about my mustache.
[03:04:31.020 --> 03:04:38.020]  It's what men grow when they have children and they like unpasteurized whole milk.
[03:04:38.020 --> 03:04:39.020]  They own weapons.
[03:04:39.020 --> 03:04:42.020]  They clean their guns after every use.
[03:04:42.020 --> 03:04:51.020]  All right, guys, when we come back, we will talk more about things that actually matter like mustaches and preparedness.
[03:04:51.020 --> 03:05:01.020]  I'm on badger.

[03:06:10.020 --> 03:06:14.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:06:14.020 --> 03:06:19.020]  And now, your host, Owen Benjamin.
[03:06:19.020 --> 03:06:21.020]  What's up? What's up?
[03:06:21.020 --> 03:06:22.020]  Welcome back, everybody.
[03:06:22.020 --> 03:06:24.020]  It's me, Owen Benjamin.
[03:06:24.020 --> 03:06:28.020]  And I am in Washington state, and we don't usually get this much snow.
[03:06:28.020 --> 03:06:29.020]  Maybe I can show you guys a little more.
[03:06:29.020 --> 03:06:30.020]  This is my backyard.
[03:06:30.020 --> 03:06:32.020]  See that snow?
[03:06:32.020 --> 03:06:34.020]  See the snow?
[03:06:34.020 --> 03:06:35.020]  By the way, I made the whole fence.
[03:06:35.020 --> 03:06:39.020]  See all the fencing?
[03:06:39.020 --> 03:06:48.020]  Because, yeah, I'm not going to hire anybody that, let's just say, doesn't have a social security number because I stand with Trump.
[03:06:48.020 --> 03:06:50.020]  You guys know what I mean.
[03:06:50.020 --> 03:06:51.020]  You guys get it.
[03:06:51.020 --> 03:06:53.020]  But what was I talking about?
[03:06:53.020 --> 03:06:54.020]  Snow?
[03:06:54.020 --> 03:06:55.020]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[03:06:55.020 --> 03:06:57.020]  So normally, it doesn't snow that much here.
[03:06:57.020 --> 03:07:02.020]  And people have called me crazy for being prepared.
[03:07:02.020 --> 03:07:03.020]  Right?
[03:07:03.020 --> 03:07:08.020]  Like, you'll see me stocking up on things like water and bullets.
[03:07:08.020 --> 03:07:11.020]  And people are like, oh, you're such a, and like canned food.
[03:07:11.020 --> 03:07:13.020]  We grow our own food.
[03:07:13.020 --> 03:07:15.020]  We have 20 laying hens.
[03:07:15.020 --> 03:07:17.020]  We have two ducks.
[03:07:17.020 --> 03:07:19.020]  Pretty sure they're both gay guys.
[03:07:19.020 --> 03:07:21.020]  So there's no eggs coming out of them.
[03:07:21.020 --> 03:07:26.020]  But if things got scarce, duck, we can eat the ducks.
[03:07:26.020 --> 03:07:28.020]  We also have rabbits.
[03:07:28.020 --> 03:07:30.020]  You know, and people are like, oh, you're such a redneck.
[03:07:30.020 --> 03:07:33.020]  You're such a crazy preppers.
[03:07:33.020 --> 03:07:37.020]  Okay, this little bit of snow.
[03:07:37.020 --> 03:07:42.020]  I just went to get my family milk because unfortunately we don't have cows yet.
[03:07:42.020 --> 03:07:46.020]  And Walmart had no milk.
[03:07:46.020 --> 03:07:49.020]  Guys, this isn't a meteor attack.
[03:07:49.020 --> 03:07:53.020]  This isn't the failure of the US dollar.
[03:07:53.020 --> 03:07:56.020]  That's an actual picture of today at Walmart.
[03:07:56.020 --> 03:07:58.020]  No milk.
[03:07:58.020 --> 03:08:01.020]  Guys, that's from snow.
[03:08:01.020 --> 03:08:04.020]  That's from snow that I can drive in.
[03:08:04.020 --> 03:08:07.020]  And people are so idiotic.
[03:08:07.020 --> 03:08:09.020]  Well, it's not that they're idiotic.
[03:08:09.020 --> 03:08:13.020]  They just won't face the hardship to reality for obvious reasons.
[03:08:13.020 --> 03:08:15.020]  Too much soy in the blood.
[03:08:15.020 --> 03:08:17.020]  They're only one Rogan tall.
[03:08:17.020 --> 03:08:21.020]  But people are like, oh yeah, everyone overreacted.
[03:08:21.020 --> 03:08:24.020]  Everyone overreacted to the weather.
[03:08:24.020 --> 03:08:27.020]  I mean, it's just so stupid that people would overreact and buy all the milk.
[03:08:27.020 --> 03:08:29.020]  No.
[03:08:29.020 --> 03:08:35.020]  My best friend who lives down the street for me in this area is a professional truck driver.
[03:08:35.020 --> 03:08:39.020]  What happens is if the trucks aren't moving, they're not restocking.
[03:08:39.020 --> 03:08:45.020]  People think that the media and Hollywood and all these people controlled are the puppet masters.
[03:08:45.020 --> 03:08:48.020]  No, most of them are pedophiles just sitting around doing coke.
[03:08:48.020 --> 03:08:50.020]  Try not to get caught.
[03:08:50.020 --> 03:08:53.020]  The real power in this country is truck driving.
[03:08:53.020 --> 03:08:59.020]  If the truckers stop trucking for 48 hours, the whole thing's done.
[03:08:59.020 --> 03:09:06.020]  So if you don't have the trucks coming in, and that's why a lot of truckers are prepared.
[03:09:06.020 --> 03:09:09.020]  They know how to grow stuff.
[03:09:09.020 --> 03:09:11.020]  My buddy has goats and pigs and guns.
[03:09:11.020 --> 03:09:15.020]  It's because they know how quickly these stores break down.
[03:09:15.020 --> 03:09:19.020]  That picture I just showed you was not a picture of Venezuela.
[03:09:19.020 --> 03:09:21.020]  That right there was today.
[03:09:21.020 --> 03:09:26.020]  That was this morning in a giant Walmart, one hour outside of Seattle.
[03:09:26.020 --> 03:09:30.020]  That's America because of snow.
[03:09:30.020 --> 03:09:32.020]  Granted, there was people in the store.
[03:09:32.020 --> 03:09:34.020]  It was open.
[03:09:34.020 --> 03:09:35.020]  The lights are on.
[03:09:35.020 --> 03:09:36.020]  I'm from Northern New York.
[03:09:36.020 --> 03:09:38.020]  This is nothing for me.
[03:09:38.020 --> 03:09:40.020]  But here, everything shuts down.
[03:09:40.020 --> 03:09:41.020]  They're like, what do we do?
[03:09:41.020 --> 03:09:42.020]  There's snow.
[03:09:42.020 --> 03:09:45.020]  Imagine when the dollar cranks.
[03:09:45.020 --> 03:09:48.020]  Imagine when an EMP happens, all that stuff.
[03:09:48.020 --> 03:09:52.020]  And I'm pumping in full-war sales of stuff because that stuff will actually help you.
[03:09:52.020 --> 03:09:59.020]  When I'm on the road, when I sell merch at the table, I always want to make sure that it's not just for me
[03:09:59.020 --> 03:10:03.020]  that people can actually save money with it or it can protect them.
[03:10:03.020 --> 03:10:07.020]  I'll sell flasks.
[03:10:07.020 --> 03:10:10.020]  And my whole thing is, it's an unbearable flask.
[03:10:10.020 --> 03:10:12.020]  And I don't have them for sale now.
[03:10:12.020 --> 03:10:13.020]  This isn't a sales pitch at all.
[03:10:13.020 --> 03:10:17.020]  I have too much going on right now to deal with packaging.
[03:10:17.020 --> 03:10:20.020]  Oh, unbearablestore.com, they sell stuff.
[03:10:20.020 --> 03:10:22.020]  My buddy Brandon, he's doing a good job.
[03:10:22.020 --> 03:10:26.020]  But anyway, because I'm like, you can save money at a bar if you just have a flask.
[03:10:26.020 --> 03:10:27.020]  And it's just like this.
[03:10:27.020 --> 03:10:32.020]  All this stuff that InfoWars sells, it's like one of the best currencies you can have is health.
[03:10:32.020 --> 03:10:34.020]  And preparedness.
[03:10:34.020 --> 03:10:40.020]  Like if you're healthy, if you treat your body right, because there's so much poison in our foods now.
[03:10:40.020 --> 03:10:52.020]  And the food, this imaginary land of never ending prosperity based on a lie and debt is going to end.
[03:10:52.020 --> 03:10:54.020]  And I'm not trying to scare people.
[03:10:54.020 --> 03:10:55.020]  It actually sets you free.
[03:10:55.020 --> 03:11:02.020]  Like once I faced the reality of what's coming, I realized that it's an excuse to be free.
[03:11:02.020 --> 03:11:05.020]  It's an excuse to be like, okay, I'm going to grow food.
[03:11:05.020 --> 03:11:08.020]  I'm going to homeschool my kids.
[03:11:08.020 --> 03:11:11.020]  I'm going to learn skills.
[03:11:11.020 --> 03:11:13.020]  I'm going to learn how to build a fence, all this stuff.
[03:11:13.020 --> 03:11:18.020]  And as you're doing that, you think you're going to be all paranoid and depressed and anxious.
[03:11:18.020 --> 03:11:20.020]  And you realize that you're calm.
[03:11:20.020 --> 03:11:21.020]  You're sleeping better.
[03:11:21.020 --> 03:11:22.020]  You're growing mustaches.
[03:11:22.020 --> 03:11:29.020]  Your wife's looking at you with pride and little twinkle of excitement, if you know what I mean.
[03:11:29.020 --> 03:11:31.020]  It's pretty magical.
[03:11:31.020 --> 03:11:35.020]  And then if I go to LA, which I hopefully never do again.
[03:11:35.020 --> 03:11:42.020]  But if somehow the demon beast pulls me back for something, you look around.
[03:11:42.020 --> 03:11:49.020]  Like the last time I did Joe Rogan's show, he had to use his booster seat, obviously.
[03:11:49.020 --> 03:11:55.020]  But the anxiety, the depression that like, here's something you guys should check out.
[03:11:55.020 --> 03:12:00.020]  Check out something called the mouse utopia experiment where they took a bunch of mice.
[03:12:00.020 --> 03:12:11.020]  And they put them in a condition that's a lot like an American city where it's like unlimited food and it's real compact and all that.
[03:12:11.020 --> 03:12:17.020]  Within 500 days, they were committing cannibalism and most of them had become homosexuals.
[03:12:17.020 --> 03:12:19.020]  That sounds about right.
[03:12:19.020 --> 03:12:21.020]  Yeah, mouse utopia experiment.
[03:12:21.020 --> 03:12:23.020]  It's horrifying and hilarious.
[03:12:23.020 --> 03:12:31.020]  When you see like trans gay mice eating each other, you're like, oh wait, I used to live on that street in LA.
[03:12:31.020 --> 03:12:37.020]  Humans are meant to think about how to heat their house.
[03:12:37.020 --> 03:12:39.020]  Think about where their food's coming from.
[03:12:39.020 --> 03:12:41.020]  Thinking about how to take care of their mustache.
[03:12:41.020 --> 03:12:43.020]  You know, fresh water sources.
[03:12:43.020 --> 03:12:51.020]  And socialism, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose IQ I think is around a schizophrenic donkey.
[03:12:51.020 --> 03:12:58.020]  And I mean, and I'm not trying to offend donkeys because I know there are schizophrenic donkeys that are more intelligent than this buffoon.
[03:12:58.020 --> 03:13:04.020]  But she's probably around schizophrenic donkey with the big bug eyes of meth and regret.
[03:13:04.020 --> 03:13:10.020]  And this, this old green thing.
[03:13:10.020 --> 03:13:13.020]  Socialism is a rat trap.
[03:13:13.020 --> 03:13:17.020]  Socialism is like, look at the free cheese.
[03:13:17.020 --> 03:13:20.020]  And the mice are like, I can't believe we get free cheese.
[03:13:20.020 --> 03:13:24.020]  And then boom, just bam, bam, bam.
[03:13:24.020 --> 03:13:25.020]  And then everyone's dead.
[03:13:25.020 --> 03:13:26.020]  Everyone's gay.
[03:13:26.020 --> 03:13:27.020]  Everyone's trans.
[03:13:27.020 --> 03:13:29.020]  Everyone's committing cannibalism.
[03:13:29.020 --> 03:13:31.020]  And you know what we'll be doing?
[03:13:31.020 --> 03:13:39.020]  Having a great time because it's all about faith, community, food sources, water sources, heat sources.
[03:13:39.020 --> 03:13:42.020]  Actually knowing your children, teaching your own children.
[03:13:42.020 --> 03:13:49.020]  Not only are you going to survive it, you're going to be having a really, like, great time.
[03:13:49.020 --> 03:13:53.020]  Like, I've been having more fun than I ever have in my life.
[03:13:53.020 --> 03:13:57.020]  And I finally have the confidence and the health and the faith to grow a mustache.
[03:13:57.020 --> 03:14:02.020]  And everywhere I walk, people are like, can you save us?
[03:14:02.020 --> 03:14:03.020]  What do we do, sir?
[03:14:03.020 --> 03:14:08.020]  I'm like, you don't have to call me sir, sir, because it's cops that treat me this way now.
[03:14:08.020 --> 03:14:14.020]  Anyway, because like, when you look at what's happening in New York state with third trimester abortions,
[03:14:14.020 --> 03:14:16.020]  that's why I've always been, not always.
[03:14:16.020 --> 03:14:20.020]  I used to be pro-choice because I didn't understand the ramifications because I didn't have children or anything.
[03:14:20.020 --> 03:14:26.020]  But when people from back home in New York used to be like, you're a right-wing nut job.
[03:14:26.020 --> 03:14:29.020]  You know, and I'm like, no, abortion's evil.
[03:14:29.020 --> 03:14:31.020]  And I'm like, they want to take it to the full term.
[03:14:31.020 --> 03:14:34.020]  They're like, no, they'll never do that.
[03:14:34.020 --> 03:14:36.020]  And then now that they're doing that.
[03:14:36.020 --> 03:14:42.020]  And one of the reasons is to harvest the stem cells and the parts.
[03:14:42.020 --> 03:14:45.020]  And they sell it to people like Sandra Bullock so she can rub it on their faces.
[03:14:45.020 --> 03:14:46.020]  That's real.
[03:14:46.020 --> 03:14:47.020]  Check it out on Ellen.
[03:14:47.020 --> 03:14:51.020]  She does foreskin skin therapy.
[03:14:51.020 --> 03:14:55.020]  Anyway, that was the plan all along.
[03:14:55.020 --> 03:15:00.020]  So this whole like, in a constant state of shock, when people are like, how could they do that?
[03:15:00.020 --> 03:15:02.020]  It's just really surprising.
[03:15:02.020 --> 03:15:04.020]  And I just don't, it's so gross.
[03:15:04.020 --> 03:15:08.020]  Like that, they said they were going to do it the whole time.
[03:15:08.020 --> 03:15:14.020]  I'm one of these whack jobs that believes people when they tell me things.
[03:15:14.020 --> 03:15:16.020]  Brandon, I have been betrayed.
[03:15:16.020 --> 03:15:18.020]  Of course I've been betrayed.
[03:15:18.020 --> 03:15:24.020]  But I'd rather be betrayed occasionally and believe people and be wrong than to just never believe anything.
[03:15:24.020 --> 03:15:29.020]  It's like, when someone says, we are going to do full term abortions.
[03:15:29.020 --> 03:15:35.020]  It's a woman's right, believe them because they're going to do it and they just did it.
[03:15:35.020 --> 03:15:40.020]  And yeah, they're selling, they're selling wiener parts.
[03:15:40.020 --> 03:15:41.020]  So get prepared.
[03:15:41.020 --> 03:15:42.020]  That's all I'm saying.
[03:15:42.020 --> 03:15:48.020]  Get yourself a mustache, get a clean water source, stock up and, you know, read the Bible a couple of times.
[03:15:48.020 --> 03:15:49.020]  There's some stuff in there.
[03:15:49.020 --> 03:15:51.020]  I'll see you guys in a second.

[03:20:27.020 --> 03:20:34.020]  And of course, they got the people going with the space race again, which I believe was all a lie.
[03:20:34.020 --> 03:20:40.020]  And I've been getting a lot of CRAP over it, if you know what I mean.
[03:20:40.020 --> 03:20:47.020]  When they cut to Buzz Aldrin, just check this out, it's insanely funny.
[03:20:47.020 --> 03:20:50.020]  Just watch this. I did a little commentary.
[03:20:50.020 --> 03:20:55.020]  Okay, this is the funniest thing I've ever seen.
[03:20:55.020 --> 03:20:57.020]  Buzz Aldrin.
[03:20:57.020 --> 03:20:58.020]  Okay, ready?
[03:20:58.020 --> 03:21:00.020]  Hey, everybody.
[03:21:00.020 --> 03:21:02.020]  I'm a crazy person.
[03:21:02.020 --> 03:21:04.020]  Okay, it's this way.
[03:21:04.020 --> 03:21:06.020]  This way, it gets so much better.
[03:21:06.020 --> 03:21:18.020]  I'm an Indian and retarded.
[03:21:18.020 --> 03:21:21.020]  We like money and power.
[03:21:21.020 --> 03:21:23.020]  Buzz is like, guys, stop clapping.
[03:21:23.020 --> 03:21:26.020]  Stop clapping, it's all lies.
[03:21:26.020 --> 03:21:29.020]  Watch Buzz's face in a second.
[03:21:29.020 --> 03:21:31.020]  Thank you, Buzz.
[03:21:31.020 --> 03:21:37.020]  This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.
[03:21:37.020 --> 03:21:41.020]  Watch Buzz's face?
[03:21:41.020 --> 03:21:52.020]  He's like, no, we're not.
[03:21:52.020 --> 03:21:56.020]  All right, so for those of you just listening, and you couldn't see it,
[03:21:56.020 --> 03:22:03.020]  Aldrin showed a look of pure terror from realizing that his entire life has been a lie.
[03:22:03.020 --> 03:22:05.020]  It's so funny.
[03:22:05.020 --> 03:22:08.020]  All right, my YouTube, youtube.com.
[03:22:08.020 --> 03:22:13.020]  This look up, Buzz is a liar.
[03:22:13.020 --> 03:22:20.020]  It's hysterical because, you know, he probably got carted out and Trump was like,
[03:22:20.020 --> 03:22:23.020]  Buzz, we just need to stand up and give a salute.
[03:22:23.020 --> 03:22:24.020]  It's going to be great.
[03:22:24.020 --> 03:22:28.020]  And Buzz is like, you promised it.
[03:22:28.020 --> 03:22:31.020]  I won't have to tell the lie again.
[03:22:31.020 --> 03:22:33.020]  Okay, it's fine, Buzz.
[03:22:33.020 --> 03:22:36.020]  We just need you for a hot second.
[03:22:36.020 --> 03:22:39.020]  Buzz stands up and he's like, hi, hi, sir.
[03:22:39.020 --> 03:22:43.020]  And then Trump, I mean, you know Trump knows we didn't go to the moon.
[03:22:43.020 --> 03:22:45.020]  I mean, the dude, he's a smart guy.
[03:22:45.020 --> 03:22:51.020]  And so Buzz is like, all right, I can get through this.
[03:22:51.020 --> 03:22:59.020]  And then Trump is like, all right, we're going to go back to space using American rockets.
[03:22:59.020 --> 03:23:09.020]  And the look on Buzz's face is like, he's just like, why won't they just let me die?
[03:23:09.020 --> 03:23:13.020]  And I'll meet Neil Armstrong in hell.
[03:23:13.020 --> 03:23:16.020]  Neil, you lucky SOB.
[03:23:16.020 --> 03:23:17.020]  What's the space right here?
[03:23:17.020 --> 03:23:19.020]  All right, so I'll you visit.
[03:23:19.020 --> 03:23:23.020]  What is this back to space and we'll use American rockets.
[03:23:23.020 --> 03:23:24.020]  Watch Buzz's face.
[03:23:24.020 --> 03:23:25.020]  He's about to start clapping.
[03:23:25.020 --> 03:23:27.020]  He's about to start clapping.
[03:23:27.020 --> 03:23:29.020]  And he's like, what?
[03:23:29.020 --> 03:23:30.020]  What?
[03:23:30.020 --> 03:23:31.020]  No.
[03:23:31.020 --> 03:23:35.020]  Dude, it's so funny.
[03:23:35.020 --> 03:23:41.020]  When you know, when you know the reality of the moon landing, it's like, you know, it
[03:23:41.020 --> 03:23:47.020]  couldn't be funnier to just watch Trump throw the guy and be like, we're going to go back
[03:23:47.020 --> 03:23:49.020]  to space.
[03:23:49.020 --> 03:23:53.020]  Buzz is going to be the guy to tell us exactly what happened last time.
[03:23:53.020 --> 03:23:54.020]  Go ahead, Buzz.
[03:23:54.020 --> 03:23:59.020]  Try to not contradict yourself again and again and again and again and again and again and
[03:23:59.020 --> 03:24:00.020]  again and again.
[03:24:00.020 --> 03:24:07.020]  Try to explain why no one's ever went back, including us and how we destroyed the technology
[03:24:07.020 --> 03:24:08.020]  and all the proof.
[03:24:08.020 --> 03:24:09.020]  Go ahead, Buzz.
[03:24:09.020 --> 03:24:16.020]  Why don't you tell the world, Neil, you're in hell, but you're the lucky one.
[03:24:16.020 --> 03:24:18.020]  It's, it's pretty funny.
[03:24:18.020 --> 03:24:25.020]  I usually, you can tell when someone's lying or when they're just being, when they're
[03:24:25.020 --> 03:24:27.020]  a coward is when they use sarcasm all the time.
[03:24:27.020 --> 03:24:34.020]  I've used sarcasm and I'm sure I will again, but sarcasm is a tool for cowards to be aggressive
[03:24:34.020 --> 03:24:39.020]  when they won't say yes for yes and no for no.
[03:24:39.020 --> 03:24:44.020]  Like sarcasm, you know, that's why I stopped listening to Ben Shapiro.
[03:24:44.020 --> 03:24:46.020]  It's not anti-semitism.
[03:24:46.020 --> 03:24:48.020]  Everyone's like, oh, you, you're anti-semitic.
[03:24:48.020 --> 03:24:53.020]  If you don't listen to Ben Shapiro, I'm a heitist.
[03:24:53.020 --> 03:24:55.020]  He's five, four, maybe.
[03:24:55.020 --> 03:24:56.020]  Like that's what it is.
[03:24:56.020 --> 03:25:00.260]  I'm prejudiced against short people as not to do it being Jewish with little hats and
[03:25:00.260 --> 03:25:03.860]  you're, and you're mangled wings.
[03:25:03.860 --> 03:25:10.340]  It's like it's short people that are sarcastic and yeah, a lot of them happen to be Jewish.
[03:25:10.340 --> 03:25:14.540]  But even the word anti-semitic doesn't mean it because semitic is the type of language
[03:25:14.540 --> 03:25:17.340]  that dates back to before the Assyrian Empire.
[03:25:17.340 --> 03:25:19.620]  Oh, there's a picture of me and Shapiro too.
[03:25:19.620 --> 03:25:20.620]  Wait, do you see that one?
[03:25:20.620 --> 03:25:25.660]  And in the caption, he even said, oh, and Benjamin's really tall because these guys can't stop
[03:25:25.660 --> 03:25:27.660]  with their little jabs.
[03:25:27.660 --> 03:25:31.740]  Ringo started the same thing to me at the Grammys when I was doing that thing for Leno.
[03:25:31.740 --> 03:25:33.140]  He wouldn't stop talking about my height.
[03:25:33.140 --> 03:25:35.020]  Little guys are the problem.
[03:25:35.020 --> 03:25:36.740]  Little guys are the problem.
[03:25:36.740 --> 03:25:38.580]  It's done to do with race.
[03:25:38.580 --> 03:25:40.580]  It has to do with size.
[03:25:40.580 --> 03:25:42.340]  Yeah, look at that.
[03:25:42.340 --> 03:25:44.540]  Oh, and Benjamin is really, really, really tall.
[03:25:44.540 --> 03:25:47.420]  Yeah, you're really, really, really short.
[03:25:47.420 --> 03:25:49.420]  All right.
[03:25:49.420 --> 03:25:52.340]  So anyway, what was I talking about?
[03:25:52.340 --> 03:25:58.580]  Oh yeah, Ringo's, I can't stand Ringo's star because we're signing some, like I was wearing
[03:25:58.580 --> 03:25:59.580]  a white suit.
[03:25:59.580 --> 03:26:03.660]  I'm not even going to get to Spielberg this round, but I will next round.
[03:26:03.660 --> 03:26:07.620]  So anyway, I'm wearing this white suit and we're signing it and auctioning it off for
[03:26:07.620 --> 03:26:08.620]  Haiti.
[03:26:08.620 --> 03:26:09.620]  That's how long ago this was.
[03:26:09.620 --> 03:26:15.100]  I didn't know that it probably just went to fuel up the pedo mobiles for the Clintons.
[03:26:15.100 --> 03:26:18.820]  I was still very innocent at the time thinking that people actually wanted to help victims
[03:26:18.820 --> 03:26:20.660]  and it wasn't a scam.
[03:26:20.660 --> 03:26:22.660]  But so I'm at the Grammys and all the celebrities are signing it.
[03:26:22.660 --> 03:26:27.260]  We're having a good time and Ringo's star just keeps being like, do I need to step that?
[03:26:27.260 --> 03:26:28.260]  Do I need to step that?
[03:26:28.260 --> 03:26:29.260]  Oh, to get up there.
[03:26:29.260 --> 03:26:31.020]  And at first I'm like excited to meet him.
[03:26:31.020 --> 03:26:32.900]  I was like a Beatles fan and Paul's a good dude.
[03:26:32.900 --> 03:26:33.900]  He goes there.
[03:26:33.900 --> 03:26:36.260]  He used to go to improv a lot.
[03:26:36.260 --> 03:26:38.460]  John was awful, commie.
[03:26:38.460 --> 03:26:39.460]  You know, I'm glad.
[03:26:39.460 --> 03:26:43.140]  I'm not going to say what I'm about to say, but I'm going to sit and hold back.
[03:26:43.140 --> 03:26:47.380]  But the song Imagine is the globalist anthem.
[03:26:47.380 --> 03:26:48.380]  Imagine there's no countries.
[03:26:48.380 --> 03:26:51.980]  Imagine there's no hell or heaven, you know, basically do what you please.
[03:26:51.980 --> 03:26:52.980]  It's horrifying.
[03:26:52.980 --> 03:26:56.060]  Anyway, so Ringo's like, do I need to step that?
[03:26:56.060 --> 03:26:58.980]  And I'm like, Ringo's starting away.
[03:26:58.980 --> 03:27:01.860]  He's like, where's my step ladder for the giant?
[03:27:01.860 --> 03:27:06.220]  And I'm like, just sign that suit.
[03:27:06.220 --> 03:27:07.220]  Just sign the suit.
[03:27:07.220 --> 03:27:08.220]  Little pal.
[03:27:08.220 --> 03:27:11.260]  He's like, how do I get all the way up there?
[03:27:11.260 --> 03:27:15.980]  I'm like, just sign the suit, Ringo.
[03:27:15.980 --> 03:27:17.620]  You play quarter notes.
[03:27:17.620 --> 03:27:18.620]  You play quarter notes.
[03:27:18.620 --> 03:27:21.660]  You're one and a half Rogan's tall.
[03:27:21.660 --> 03:27:25.140]  And so I don't even remember if he signed the suit.
[03:27:25.140 --> 03:27:27.260]  He might have just scurried into a little mouse hole.
[03:27:27.260 --> 03:27:29.740]  Guy's terrible, terrible.
[03:27:29.740 --> 03:27:33.100]  That's when I really started understanding how horrible the short.
[03:27:33.100 --> 03:27:34.740]  I call him Bob.
[03:27:34.740 --> 03:27:36.980]  I'm not going to say.
[03:27:36.980 --> 03:27:45.180]  I made it up, but specs, S-P-E-C-K-S, and I know that that isn't a pejorative yet, so
[03:27:45.180 --> 03:27:49.820]  I can't get in trouble by the specs.
[03:27:49.820 --> 03:27:52.380]  And so people sometimes will like, oh, you're going to do some good.
[03:27:52.380 --> 03:27:56.820]  No, I'm against short people and a tiny little man.
[03:27:56.820 --> 03:28:01.660]  I mean, Jews happen to just be really short a lot with little tiny hats.
[03:28:01.660 --> 03:28:06.660]  And they wear little tiny hats in honor of the smallest of the small.
[03:28:06.660 --> 03:28:11.140]  That's how they make, because what's the average Jewish height?
[03:28:11.140 --> 03:28:14.100]  One Rogan, maybe two Rogans.
[03:28:14.100 --> 03:28:22.700]  I mean, so to make themselves look bigger, they wear tiny hats where they look like giants.
[03:28:22.700 --> 03:28:25.100]  And I'm pushing six, eight guys.
[03:28:25.100 --> 03:28:29.660]  I'm six, seven, and three quarters.
[03:28:29.660 --> 03:28:32.780]  And so these guys just want to kick me in the shin and run away.
[03:28:32.780 --> 03:28:33.780]  They think I'm Nephilim.
[03:28:33.780 --> 03:28:37.660]  You know, they think I'm a giant from the times of Noah.
[03:28:37.660 --> 03:28:39.060]  And I get it.
[03:28:39.060 --> 03:28:46.140]  Well, when we come back, we'll talk about sarcasm and why I hate it and that Steven Spielberg
[03:28:46.140 --> 03:28:53.420]  is a pedophile in short, not because he's Jewish, because he's short.
[03:28:53.420 --> 03:28:57.140]  Pain in my neck back and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[03:31:54.300 --> 03:31:59.700]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment from the bad halogens,
[03:31:59.700 --> 03:32:06.500]  fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it literally dumbs the population down.
[03:32:06.500 --> 03:32:10.500]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world,
[03:32:10.500 --> 03:32:13.100]  we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:13.100 --> 03:32:17.100]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source,
[03:32:17.100 --> 03:32:19.500]  and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it,
[03:32:19.500 --> 03:32:25.700]  so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2, that's been incredible.
[03:32:25.700 --> 03:32:32.700]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:32.700 --> 03:32:38.700]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[03:32:38.700 --> 03:32:46.700]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:32:46.700 --> 03:32:50.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:32:50.700 --> 03:32:55.700]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[03:33:21.700 --> 03:33:27.700]  All right, all right. What's up, everybody? So, I'm back.
[03:33:27.700 --> 03:33:34.700]  And now we're going to talk about subversive language, sarcasm.
[03:33:34.700 --> 03:33:37.700]  So, I don't really like sarcasm anymore, I used to like it.
[03:33:37.700 --> 03:33:44.700]  But now that things are getting so confusing and horrifying in society and in entertainment and politics and everything,
[03:33:44.700 --> 03:33:57.700]  I really just, I've actually enjoyed being around some Asians and people with Asperger syndrome.
[03:33:57.700 --> 03:34:01.700]  Because they don't, it's kind of like that character from Guardians in the Galaxy,
[03:34:01.700 --> 03:34:03.700]  that like big dude that didn't understand sarcasm.
[03:34:03.700 --> 03:34:10.700]  It was just like, I can't remember the guy's name, he looked like a giant, like he's had a lot of muscles.
[03:34:10.700 --> 03:34:20.700]  But here's a quick little sketch that I was coming up with called the Jewish guy and the Chinese guy.
[03:34:20.700 --> 03:34:25.700]  The Jewish guy, this is how cultures can't discuss anything.
[03:34:25.700 --> 03:34:28.700]  And this is one reason why AI on the internet is getting so confusing.
[03:34:28.700 --> 03:34:35.700]  I highly recommend you guys stop using sarcasm on the internet because AI doesn't understand sarcasm.
[03:34:35.700 --> 03:34:39.700]  These bots where it's like, great, I guess this is real life now.
[03:34:39.700 --> 03:34:45.700]  I guess their kids are all just being used for Sandra Bullock's face, like, don't do that.
[03:34:45.700 --> 03:34:53.700]  Okay, here's the Jewish guy walks into the Chinese, the Chinese laundromat.
[03:34:53.700 --> 03:35:02.700]  So I paid you to take the mustard out of my slacks and I'm so happy that the mustard is still in my slacks.
[03:35:02.700 --> 03:35:05.700]  Why are you happy mustard in your slacks?
[03:35:05.700 --> 03:35:08.700]  Why you want mustard in your slacks, that means you're crazy.
[03:35:08.700 --> 03:35:13.700]  Well, I mean, I guess that's why I don't have a therapist.
[03:35:13.700 --> 03:35:17.700]  You don't have a therapist? Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?
[03:35:17.700 --> 03:35:20.700]  Look, we got a real ray of sunshine over here.
[03:35:20.700 --> 03:35:27.700]  I'm not a ray of sunshine. My name is Ming. You are weird, crazy man.
[03:35:27.700 --> 03:35:33.700]  What a great business policy to not take the mustard out of a man's slacks.
[03:35:33.700 --> 03:35:39.700]  That bad business policy. Why would you think that good business policy to not take mustard out of slacks?
[03:35:39.700 --> 03:35:41.700]  You lying about your slacks.
[03:35:41.700 --> 03:35:46.700]  Yeah, that's what I always do is I lie about my slacks.
[03:35:46.700 --> 03:35:51.700]  You lie about slacks. You lie about everything. Everything you say or lie.
[03:35:51.700 --> 03:35:55.700]  I guess that's what I want to do is just rub my own mustard in my own slacks.
[03:35:55.700 --> 03:35:58.700]  I watch you rub your own mustard in your own slacks.
[03:35:58.700 --> 03:36:03.700]  When a cop comes in, they're like, got mustard. She's like, excuse me.
[03:36:03.700 --> 03:36:12.700]  Are you, uh, are you, uh, I'm not, I couldn't even think of a straight typical Jewish name that wasn't an actual guy.
[03:36:12.700 --> 03:36:14.700]  Are you Bernie Sanders?
[03:36:14.700 --> 03:36:20.700]  Yeah, I mean, I guess my driver's license is shut up, Bernie.
[03:36:20.700 --> 03:36:23.700]  We caught you on camera rubbing mustard in your own slacks.
[03:36:23.700 --> 03:36:30.700]  Yeah, because cameras always get him out of here. This guy crazy.
[03:36:30.700 --> 03:36:37.700]  So the two cultures in that little sketch is the, the Chinese who have zero sarcasm.
[03:36:37.700 --> 03:36:42.700]  And you have to understand they're a big part of the internet these days and entertainment and everything.
[03:36:42.700 --> 03:36:46.700]  They're like, you know, funny. This all came from a Chinese person telling me that I wasn't funny.
[03:36:46.700 --> 03:36:52.700]  They're like, you know, funny. I'm like, why don't you think I'm funny?
[03:36:52.700 --> 03:36:57.700]  Like, why not funny? A fat girl with a big hat fall down stairs.
[03:36:57.700 --> 03:37:07.700]  That funny. If funny, when man get hit in testicle and the Jewish guy be like, I love getting hit in the testicle.
[03:37:07.700 --> 03:37:15.700]  I was like, okay, then I hit you in testicle. Please. That would make my, oh, what did you do that?
[03:37:15.700 --> 03:37:20.700]  You told me to. I don't understand subversive language.
[03:37:20.700 --> 03:37:29.700]  It's exhausting. It's exhausting. The older I get, the more I just don't want to be around exhausting cultures.
[03:37:29.700 --> 03:37:36.700]  It's, I'm just like, tell me the deal. Did you rub the mustard in your slacks?
[03:37:36.700 --> 03:37:45.700]  Yeah, because that's what I want to do is just run around rubbing mustard in slacks.
[03:37:45.700 --> 03:37:52.700]  But then the Chinese people, they seem to not understand like irony or nuance very well.
[03:37:52.700 --> 03:38:00.700]  When you do like an ironic, you know, if they read, what is that called by Jonathan Swift, a modest proposal,
[03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:07.700]  they'd be like, why do you want to make Iris baby into handbags?
[03:38:07.700 --> 03:38:14.700]  It's tough. It's a tough world to be a comedian these days because on one side you got people that just want physical comedy,
[03:38:14.700 --> 03:38:19.700]  like a fat girl with a big hat falling on stairs or a man getting hit in the testicles makes them laugh.
[03:38:19.700 --> 03:38:26.700]  That's why Adam Sandler adjusted his movies to fit the Chinese audience more.
[03:38:26.700 --> 03:38:32.700]  And then you have just unrelenting sarcasm that just ends up being like just lying.
[03:38:32.700 --> 03:38:38.700]  It's just like, great, like how Ben Shapiro always is like, so now I guess the New York Times is just going to talk about
[03:38:38.700 --> 03:38:42.700]  how white people are the devil at the time. That's just great. That's what I wanted in my newspaper.
[03:38:42.700 --> 03:38:50.700]  Awesome. Isn't that great? Isn't that wonderful? Isn't that just what the doctor ordered?
[03:38:50.700 --> 03:39:00.700]  And the Chinese person would be like, why do you have a doctor order the demonization of the majority of the population?
[03:39:00.700 --> 03:39:03.700]  That is not a doctor. That's not hypocritical oath.
[03:39:03.700 --> 03:39:14.700]  Those should mean that hypocritical oath. Yeah. This is my fifth language. You guys get it.
[03:39:14.700 --> 03:39:25.700]  So I'll show you a subversive situation in movies. Okay. The Sistine Chapel is a beautiful image of God almost touching man.
[03:39:25.700 --> 03:39:30.700]  And it's in the Sistine Chapel painted by Michelangelo. And it's beautiful.
[03:39:30.700 --> 03:39:37.700]  We have the image. I think a lot of you guys know the image. It's in your mind. You can just picture it.
[03:39:37.700 --> 03:39:44.700]  It's God and man. And they're almost touching finger to finger, right? That's a beautiful image.
[03:39:44.700 --> 03:39:51.700]  Now we have a guy named Steven Spielberg who made a movie called E.T.
[03:39:51.700 --> 03:40:00.700]  And he subverted this image into this image of it's upside down. The alien hand is in a namble shape.
[03:40:00.700 --> 03:40:10.700]  And instead of God and man, it is a lie and a boy. And behind them is, of course, the moon. Another lie.
[03:40:10.700 --> 03:40:25.700]  And that's disgusting. And that's Spielberg's entire career. It started with a short film he made called Amblin, which was about a pedophile.
[03:40:25.700 --> 03:40:29.700]  The whole skill he was selling. And you can look into this. Look at what Amblin is about.
[03:40:29.700 --> 03:40:35.700]  Amblin is a short film 20 minutes long. He made 1968. And he sold it to Universal.
[03:40:35.700 --> 03:40:41.700]  He had a seven-picture deal from it with no dialogue in it at all. And it was a $10,000 short film.
[03:40:41.700 --> 03:40:45.700]  People would be like, wow, he must have been a really, really good filmmaker.
[03:40:45.700 --> 03:40:49.700]  No. What he was selling is the ability to subvert.
[03:40:49.700 --> 03:40:57.700]  So what happens is, oh, and Amblin, by the way, is basically an anagram for Nambla.
[03:40:57.700 --> 03:41:05.700]  So in the guy's suitcase is a paperback copy of Arthur C. Clarke, who was an author, who was a pedophile, had to flee to Sri Lanka.
[03:41:05.700 --> 03:41:13.700]  And Milk of Magnes, which is what sodomites use. Yeah, I don't want to get into it. It's really, really gross.
[03:41:13.700 --> 03:41:24.700]  And so the woman that thought she was with some cool hip guy just walks away from him after looking in his guitar case.
[03:41:24.700 --> 03:41:29.700]  So why is that so valuable? He was showing the skill of hiding in plain sight.
[03:41:29.700 --> 03:41:40.700]  Anybody that knows what these images represent is like, oh, this is a story about a pedophile and a girl who thought she was meeting a cool guy and it turned out he was a pedophile.
[03:41:40.700 --> 03:41:45.700]  Less than one in a thousand people can see that.
[03:41:45.700 --> 03:41:50.700]  So Universal was like, oh, this guy's great. We can do a whole series of it.
[03:41:50.700 --> 03:41:59.700]  We got AI, we got Jaws, about a town that has this secret about a monster that keeps eating children.
[03:41:59.700 --> 03:42:06.700]  We have Indiana Jones. If you guys have the clip of Indiana Jones, I think we have the clip of Indiana Jones.
[03:42:06.700 --> 03:42:11.700]  Or in the next segment, maybe I'll show it. I only have a little bit for this one.
[03:42:11.700 --> 03:42:17.700]  But Indiana Jones had an affair with that girl when she was like 11 or 12.
[03:42:17.700 --> 03:42:23.700]  There's this scene when Indiana Jones goes in the bar and she's like, Indiana, I haven't seen you in 10 years.
[03:42:23.700 --> 03:42:26.700]  And he's like, what's up, Meredith or whatever.
[03:42:26.700 --> 03:42:29.700]  And she's like, I was just a little girl. And he was like, you knew what you wanted.
[03:42:29.700 --> 03:42:31.700]  When we come back, I'll show you the clip.
[03:42:31.700 --> 03:42:38.700]  There's transcript of Lucas and Spielberg discussing how old the child should be when she had sex with Indiana Jones.
[03:42:38.700 --> 03:42:43.700]  And at first they said 11, but had to be under 16.
[03:42:43.700 --> 03:42:48.700]  Yeah, it's hiding in plain sight, ladies and gentlemen. It's right there.
[03:42:48.700 --> 03:43:14.700]  So that's why I recommend you get seats, huge pianist.com. See you in a bit.

[03:46:25.700 --> 03:46:26.700]  90, 95%.
[03:46:26.700 --> 03:46:27.700]  No one's ever done that.
[03:46:27.700 --> 03:46:28.700]  I said, how much does that cost for a bottle?
[03:46:28.700 --> 03:46:29.700]  That costs $10.
[03:46:29.700 --> 03:46:31.700]  No one's ever done that, sir.
[03:46:31.700 --> 03:46:33.700]  The average competitor is 3% to 5%.

[03:46:37.700 --> 03:46:40.700]  I mean, you understand, like, that's like our information is explosive.
[03:46:40.700 --> 03:46:43.700]  Our fish oil, I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[03:46:43.700 --> 03:46:44.700]  My children take it.
[03:46:44.700 --> 03:46:48.700]  You think I'm going to give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[03:46:48.700 --> 03:46:51.700]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[03:46:51.700 --> 03:46:52.700]  Never.
[03:46:52.700 --> 03:47:13.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:13.700 --> 03:47:40.700]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones with Owen Benjamin.
[03:47:40.700 --> 03:47:59.700]  I never doubted that.
[03:47:59.700 --> 03:48:01.700]  Something made it inevitable.
[03:48:01.700 --> 03:48:04.700]  So what are you doing here in Nepal?
[03:48:04.700 --> 03:48:07.700]  I need one of the pieces your father collected.
[03:48:07.700 --> 03:48:11.700]  I learned to hate you in the last 10 years.
[03:48:11.700 --> 03:48:13.700]  I never meant to hurt you.
[03:48:13.700 --> 03:48:14.700]  I was a child.
[03:48:14.700 --> 03:48:15.700]  I was in love.
[03:48:15.700 --> 03:48:17.700]  It was wrong and you knew it.
[03:48:17.700 --> 03:48:18.700]  You knew what you were doing.
[03:48:18.700 --> 03:48:19.700]  Now I do.
[03:48:19.700 --> 03:48:20.700]  This is my place.
[03:48:20.700 --> 03:48:21.700]  Get out.
[03:48:21.700 --> 03:48:22.700]  Mohan.
[03:48:22.700 --> 03:48:23.700]  Same group.
[03:48:23.700 --> 03:48:24.700]  Bullion.
[03:48:24.700 --> 03:48:25.700]  I did what I did.
[03:48:25.700 --> 03:48:33.700]  You don't have to be happy about it, but maybe we can help each other out now.
[03:48:33.700 --> 03:48:36.700]  So that's insane, right?
[03:48:36.700 --> 03:48:39.700]  Let's just play it again.
[03:48:39.700 --> 03:48:43.700]  And this time that you saw the scene, we're going to discuss what really is happening.
[03:48:43.700 --> 03:48:48.700]  So this woman in this scene is in her 20s.
[03:48:48.700 --> 03:48:51.700]  And so she's saying it's been 10 years.
[03:48:51.700 --> 03:48:53.700]  I was a child.
[03:48:53.700 --> 03:48:56.700]  And he said, you knew what you were doing.
[03:48:56.700 --> 03:48:59.700]  He's a good 20 years older than her in the scene.
[03:48:59.700 --> 03:49:03.700]  And when the scene first starts, she's cowering and he's a shadow.
[03:49:03.700 --> 03:49:08.700]  She's cowering like a child and whistling the dialogue again.
[03:49:08.700 --> 03:49:13.700]  Indiana Jones.
[03:49:13.700 --> 03:49:17.700]  Always knew someday you'd come walking back through my door.
[03:49:17.700 --> 03:49:19.700]  I never doubted that.
[03:49:19.700 --> 03:49:21.700]  Something made it inevitable.
[03:49:21.700 --> 03:49:24.700]  So what are you doing here in Nepal?
[03:49:24.700 --> 03:49:27.700]  I need one of the pieces your father collected.
[03:49:27.700 --> 03:49:31.700]  I learned to hate you in the last 10 years.
[03:49:31.700 --> 03:49:32.700]  I never meant to hurt you.
[03:49:32.700 --> 03:49:33.700]  I was a child.
[03:49:33.700 --> 03:49:34.700]  I was in love.
[03:49:34.700 --> 03:49:36.700]  It was wrong and you knew it.
[03:49:36.700 --> 03:49:38.700]  You knew what you were doing.
[03:49:38.700 --> 03:49:39.700]  Now I do.
[03:49:39.700 --> 03:49:40.700]  This is my place.
[03:49:40.700 --> 03:49:41.700]  Get out.
[03:49:41.700 --> 03:49:43.700]  Mohan, Temigru, Bollyanu.
[03:49:43.700 --> 03:49:44.700]  Hold it, Nick.
[03:49:44.700 --> 03:49:45.700]  I did what I did.
[03:49:45.700 --> 03:49:51.700]  You don't have to be happy about it, but maybe we can help each other out now.
[03:49:51.700 --> 03:49:52.700]  That's it.
[03:49:52.700 --> 03:49:55.700]  That's child rape, guys.
[03:49:55.700 --> 03:50:01.700]  And the way that is unapologetic, everything about that is insane.
[03:50:01.700 --> 03:50:03.700]  She's like, I was a child.
[03:50:03.700 --> 03:50:04.700]  I was in love.
[03:50:04.700 --> 03:50:06.700]  I didn't know any better.
[03:50:06.700 --> 03:50:09.700]  He's like, you knew what you were doing, or.
[03:50:09.700 --> 03:50:12.700]  And she's also an alcoholic in this movie.
[03:50:12.700 --> 03:50:15.700]  She's like, this is my place now.
[03:50:15.700 --> 03:50:16.700]  I've grown out of it.
[03:50:16.700 --> 03:50:19.700]  It's so horrible.
[03:50:19.700 --> 03:50:21.700]  And that's all from Steven Spielberg.
[03:50:21.700 --> 03:50:30.700]  And then you get into hetero roark, the girl that died from a ruptured rectum.
[03:50:30.700 --> 03:50:34.700]  The poltergeist girl, hetero roark.
[03:50:34.700 --> 03:50:38.700]  She died from septic shock on set.
[03:50:38.700 --> 03:50:43.700]  And the kind executives told the parents that it was the flu.
[03:50:43.700 --> 03:50:49.700]  Yeah, it's so bad that a lot of people can't even face it.
[03:50:49.700 --> 03:50:51.700]  And they just hide with sarcasm.
[03:50:51.700 --> 03:50:53.700]  And they go, oh, that's great.
[03:50:53.700 --> 03:50:56.700]  Indiana Jones having sex with an 11 year old.
[03:50:56.700 --> 03:50:57.700]  Wow.
[03:50:57.700 --> 03:50:58.700]  That's great.
[03:50:58.700 --> 03:50:59.700]  No, it's disgusting.
[03:50:59.700 --> 03:51:01.700]  It's horrible.
[03:51:01.700 --> 03:51:06.700]  And you look into more of his movies and it's all about, you know, subversion.
[03:51:06.700 --> 03:51:10.700]  It's all about killing God.
[03:51:10.700 --> 03:51:14.700]  You can't kill God, but you can try to kill God in the heart of man.
[03:51:14.700 --> 03:51:20.700]  As I'll show you again, the Sistine Chapel versus ET.
[03:51:20.700 --> 03:51:24.700]  The world is run by images because images go beyond.
[03:51:24.700 --> 03:51:29.700]  So that's the Sistine Chapel right there, God and man almost touching fingers.
[03:51:29.700 --> 03:51:36.700]  And then you have ET, which is a monster and a little boy touching fingers.
[03:51:36.700 --> 03:51:38.700]  And there's light.
[03:51:38.700 --> 03:51:43.700]  And in the background is a sphere representing the moon.
[03:51:43.700 --> 03:51:49.700]  And the alien's hand is in the shape of a namble triangle.
[03:51:49.700 --> 03:51:53.700]  And his fingers look like wieners, by the way.
[03:51:53.700 --> 03:51:59.700]  It's so bad that like, what Spielberg was selling in that Amblin,
[03:51:59.700 --> 03:52:03.700]  what Spielberg was selling in Amblin, the short film he made in 1968,
[03:52:03.700 --> 03:52:07.700]  the Universal then signed him up for a seven picture deal,
[03:52:07.700 --> 03:52:12.700]  is he could show pedophilia in plain sight and no one would know.
[03:52:12.700 --> 03:52:16.700]  And then even if you look at the cover of Schindler's List,
[03:52:16.700 --> 03:52:23.700]  it is, Schindler's List is the image is a adult and a child's holding hands,
[03:52:23.700 --> 03:52:28.700]  which is another namble symbol.
[03:52:28.700 --> 03:52:32.700]  And so, yeah, you wouldn't know this stuff because instinctively,
[03:52:32.700 --> 03:52:36.700]  you know, like when I hold my son's hand, it's cute and fatherly.
[03:52:36.700 --> 03:52:37.700]  It's like, oh, no way.
[03:52:37.700 --> 03:52:43.700]  These sick, sick reptilian psychopaths don't see it that way.
[03:52:43.700 --> 03:52:47.700]  They see it as a symbol for what they're really up to.
[03:52:47.700 --> 03:52:53.700]  And Spielberg in interviews have said that on ET, on the set of ET,
[03:52:53.700 --> 03:52:56.700]  he would act like a child and children would act like him
[03:52:56.700 --> 03:53:01.700]  and there was no difference in age and it's so sick.
[03:53:01.700 --> 03:53:08.700]  Yeah, Amblin, Amblin, N-A-M-B-L-I.
[03:53:08.700 --> 03:53:12.700]  And it's a little kid against a moon.
[03:53:12.700 --> 03:53:14.700]  Check out what DreamWorks is.
[03:53:14.700 --> 03:53:18.700]  DreamWorks, a little kid against a moon.
[03:53:18.700 --> 03:53:21.700]  It's all the same, guys.
[03:53:21.700 --> 03:53:28.700]  Like Katzenberg, Spielberg, Geffen, they're all part of this legend.
[03:53:28.700 --> 03:53:33.700]  Yeah, like compare Amblin symbol to DreamWorks symbol.
[03:53:33.700 --> 03:53:39.700]  You have a lonely child in the moon and then you have the crescent
[03:53:39.700 --> 03:53:43.700]  and he's holding a pole.
[03:53:43.700 --> 03:53:47.700]  It's so insane when you know what these people really do.
[03:53:47.700 --> 03:53:52.700]  And if you just, and if you think I'm just some whack job,
[03:53:52.700 --> 03:53:59.700]  there's, look at the arrests, look at the convictions of child endangerment,
[03:53:59.700 --> 03:54:04.700]  child sodomy, sexual abuse of children.
[03:54:04.700 --> 03:54:09.700]  Like just the people that were around Leonardo DiCaprio,
[03:54:09.700 --> 03:54:11.700]  how many of them had to go to jail for it?
[03:54:11.700 --> 03:54:15.700]  And these are the people that actually get caught and prosecuted.
[03:54:15.700 --> 03:54:18.700]  It's so ugly.
[03:54:18.700 --> 03:54:22.700]  So that's why I'm having a really good time out here in the snow,
[03:54:22.700 --> 03:54:25.700]  burning some fire, protecting my kids.
[03:54:25.700 --> 03:54:28.700]  You can hit me up, hugepianist.com.
[03:54:28.700 --> 03:54:32.700]  If you want to check out my last few specials, feed the bear a little bit,
[03:54:32.700 --> 03:54:37.700]  or cause I don't know how long my YouTube channel is going to be up.
[03:54:37.700 --> 03:54:40.700]  You know, it's been taken down a few times and now that I'm up over,
[03:54:40.700 --> 03:54:46.700]  you know, 230,000 subscribers, I'm guessing it will be taken down again.
[03:54:46.700 --> 03:54:54.700]  Because pedophiles, oddly, don't like being called out by giant men with mustaches.
[03:54:54.700 --> 03:54:56.700]  I'm pushing six, eight.
[03:54:56.700 --> 03:54:59.700]  Most pedos are under five, seven.
[03:54:59.700 --> 03:55:02.700]  That's the fact, because they're very childlike.
[03:55:02.700 --> 03:55:03.700]  They feel weak.
[03:55:03.700 --> 03:55:05.700]  Because here's the thing about pedophilia, guys.
[03:55:05.700 --> 03:55:09.700]  Pedophilia is obviously not about sex, about control.
[03:55:09.700 --> 03:55:11.700]  It's about evil.
[03:55:11.700 --> 03:55:14.700]  It's about revictimizing.
[03:55:14.700 --> 03:55:17.700]  It's keeping a cycle of abuse going.
[03:55:17.700 --> 03:55:19.700]  But the main thing is control.
[03:55:19.700 --> 03:55:24.700]  It's the same thing about people who kill like little baby kittens and stuff,
[03:55:24.700 --> 03:55:29.700]  and like little puppies, like the people that hurt animals that,
[03:55:29.700 --> 03:55:34.700]  I've killed animals that could kill me to eat them.
[03:55:34.700 --> 03:55:38.700]  Like in the most, in the least cruel way possible,
[03:55:38.700 --> 03:55:40.700]  the people that like hurt animals, it's the same thing.
[03:55:40.700 --> 03:55:42.700]  They want to feel like their own God.
[03:55:42.700 --> 03:55:44.700]  It's about Satanism.
[03:55:44.700 --> 03:55:45.700]  You're your own God.
[03:55:45.700 --> 03:55:46.700]  Do as thou wilt, right?
[03:55:46.700 --> 03:55:50.700]  That always ends up going to control and to passing evil on.
[03:55:50.700 --> 03:55:54.700]  And there's no worse thing than hurting kids.
[03:55:54.700 --> 03:55:58.700]  And so when you see the Steven Spielbergs of the world and how they hide
[03:55:58.700 --> 03:56:00.700]  and play inside and no one can do anything about it,
[03:56:00.700 --> 03:56:03.700]  that's what makes them so happy.
[03:56:03.700 --> 03:56:07.700]  Their happiness is derived from the fact that everyone knows what they're doing
[03:56:07.700 --> 03:56:10.700]  and no one can do anything.
[03:56:10.700 --> 03:56:15.700]  And that they can watch as parents bring their kids to go watch these movies.
[03:56:15.700 --> 03:56:20.700]  And this symbolic, I mean, I could do a whole thing at Jurassic Park.
[03:56:20.700 --> 03:56:23.700]  I'm not gonna, because some of it's so disgusting.
[03:56:23.700 --> 03:56:27.700]  But they watch and they laugh and they cackle, you know,
[03:56:27.700 --> 03:56:30.700]  because they know something that no one else does.
[03:56:30.700 --> 03:56:39.700]  And so, I don't know, man, this segment got a little off the rails here,
[03:56:39.700 --> 03:56:43.700]  but it's a topic that I really hate talking about,
[03:56:43.700 --> 03:56:48.700]  but needs to be discussed because nothing shames the devil more
[03:56:48.700 --> 03:56:52.700]  than people without fear just talking about it, saying it.
[03:56:52.700 --> 03:56:58.700]  I've taken down people like Spielberg in my life and they're not strong.
[03:56:58.700 --> 03:56:59.700]  It's all an illusion.
[03:56:59.700 --> 03:57:01.700]  It's all a hologram.
[03:57:01.700 --> 03:57:03.700]  It's nothing there.
[03:57:03.700 --> 03:57:04.700]  It's a Wizard of Oz.
[03:57:04.700 --> 03:57:06.700]  You know, the Wizard of Oz, do a whole thing about that.
[03:57:06.700 --> 03:57:08.700]  That's about the gold standard.
[03:57:08.700 --> 03:57:11.700]  OZ ounces, you know, the Emerald City, Green.
[03:57:11.700 --> 03:57:14.700]  Don't leave the man behind the, you know,
[03:57:14.700 --> 03:57:16.700]  don't leave the man behind the curtain.
[03:57:16.700 --> 03:57:17.700]  And guess what he is?
[03:57:17.700 --> 03:57:19.700]  Guess what the Wizard of Oz is?
[03:57:19.700 --> 03:57:20.700]  He's short.
[03:57:20.700 --> 03:57:22.700]  He's a little dude.
[03:57:22.700 --> 03:57:28.700]  You know, follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City.
[03:57:28.700 --> 03:57:30.700]  It's right there.
[03:57:30.700 --> 03:57:32.700]  But the Federal Reserve.
[03:57:32.700 --> 03:57:33.700]  All right.
