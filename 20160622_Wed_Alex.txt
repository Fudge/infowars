[00:00.000 --> 00:27.800]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday, June 22, 2016.
[00:27.800 --> 00:32.880]  Tomorrow is going to be the vote as to whether or not Britain will leave the European Union.
[00:32.880 --> 00:39.000]  And of course, this has global consequences, not only directly in Europe.
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  And of course, the European Union could begin to start to unravel.
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.240]  And that would be, I think, a very good thing, because the European Union is now trying to
[00:47.240 --> 00:50.960]  consolidate with essentially the North American Union.
[00:50.960 --> 00:57.680]  It's always economic consolidation first, and then closely followed by political consolidation.
[00:57.680 --> 00:59.760]  People in Europe have had enough of it.
[00:59.760 --> 01:01.520]  People across Europe have had enough of it.
[01:01.520 --> 01:04.640]  So they're starting to break out of that confinement.
[01:04.640 --> 01:08.280]  So we're going to be talking to Lord Mockton because the referendum is tomorrow and all
[01:08.280 --> 01:10.320]  eyes are on Britain.
[01:10.320 --> 01:16.960]  Today, as we just before we went on air, we had Donald Trump start to essentially define
[01:16.960 --> 01:17.960]  Hillary Clinton.
[01:17.960 --> 01:20.320]  And so we're going to have a lot of breakdown of that speech.
[01:20.320 --> 01:23.920]  We've got an article that's up on the Drudge Report from InfoWars.
[01:23.920 --> 01:30.360]  Trump says, Hillary makes millions from anti-gay, anti-woman regimes and wants Sharia migrants.
[01:30.360 --> 01:35.240]  And we're going to break down what that looks like for you in Saudi Arabia.
[01:35.240 --> 01:37.200]  And Hillary says, she's a woman.
[01:37.200 --> 01:39.000]  Vote for her because she's a woman.
[01:39.000 --> 01:40.920]  Vote for her because she's going to do things for women.
[01:40.920 --> 01:46.160]  And yet, she takes all of this money from these oppressive regimes throughout the Middle
[01:46.160 --> 01:47.640]  East like Saudi Arabia.
[01:47.640 --> 01:52.920]  We're going to share a story with you about what the women in Saudi Arabia do on bumper
[01:52.920 --> 01:54.000]  car night.
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.240]  You won't believe this, how desperate they are to have a little bit of freedom and independence
[01:59.240 --> 02:02.480]  to get the burqa off to be able to drive a car.
[02:02.480 --> 02:04.880]  They're not interested in bumping into each other.
[02:04.880 --> 02:09.200]  They just want to be able to drive a car a little bit, have a little bit of freedom.
[02:09.200 --> 02:10.760]  So we're going to share that with you.
[02:10.760 --> 02:14.200]  Meanwhile, today, Hillary Clinton is in North Carolina.
[02:14.200 --> 02:19.360]  We constantly hear about how Donald Trump is just poisoned for the GOP.
[02:19.360 --> 02:21.760]  He hurts the GOP so much, really.
[02:21.760 --> 02:25.920]  He brought in record numbers of voters this last election.
[02:25.920 --> 02:30.680]  And of course, Hillary's vote totals crashed from eight years ago when she last ran for
[02:30.680 --> 02:31.680]  president.
[02:31.680 --> 02:35.760]  Hillary is being shunned in North Carolina by the top of the ticket of the Democrat
[02:35.760 --> 02:36.760]  Party.
[02:36.760 --> 02:37.760]  She's going to be talking in Raleigh today.
[02:37.760 --> 02:40.960]  And yet, the candidate for governor is not going to be there.
[02:40.960 --> 02:43.920]  The candidate for Senate is not going to be there.
[02:43.920 --> 02:48.040]  What does that tell you about that important swing state?
[02:48.040 --> 02:52.080]  North Carolina is one of the swing states that is a must-win.
[02:52.080 --> 02:56.080]  There's a lot of reliable states that are going to go for the GOP, a lot of reliable
[02:56.080 --> 02:57.920]  states that are going to go for the Democrats.
[02:57.920 --> 03:01.480]  North Carolina is one of the states that is in swing.
[03:01.480 --> 03:05.040]  And the Democrats there do not want to be associated with her.
[03:05.040 --> 03:10.160]  It would be very bad timing, especially today, the way Donald Trump came out against Hillary
[03:10.160 --> 03:11.160]  Clinton.
[03:11.160 --> 03:13.840]  And as I pointed out, we're going to break that down a great deal for you.
[03:13.840 --> 03:18.800]  So Bill O'Reilly, you missed this yesterday, he's calling for a gun registration.
[03:18.800 --> 03:22.160]  Here's an article from the Independent Sentinel, Bill O'Reilly wants to assault weapons ban.
[03:22.160 --> 03:25.320]  He wants gun registered the same way that we register cars.
[03:25.320 --> 03:30.040]  He's also naive enough to think no one really wants to disarm Americans.
[03:30.040 --> 03:32.360]  And they point out, we've been targeted by the IRS.
[03:32.360 --> 03:36.480]  Why would we want to create yet another thing where we're registered?
[03:36.480 --> 03:40.760]  I have to say, you always use, isn't it interesting, when we had Obamacare, they said, well, we
[03:40.760 --> 03:45.600]  got mandatory insurance for cars, now they're saying we had mandatory registration for cars.
[03:45.600 --> 03:50.600]  We have all kinds of arbitrary regulations for cars that infringe on our freedom to travel.
[03:50.600 --> 03:53.720]  So why can't we infringe on the rest of our freedoms?
[03:53.720 --> 03:59.480]  That's why I say, all of our rights hang together or we lose all of our rights at the same time.
[03:59.480 --> 04:05.700]  And I think it's time that we not only reject this idea that we're going to enact controls
[04:05.700 --> 04:08.200]  because we've already put them on our transportation.
[04:08.200 --> 04:11.960]  I think we need to start liberating freedom of movement within this country.
[04:11.960 --> 04:15.120]  I think we need to start looking at things that we have given up that are fundamental
[04:15.120 --> 04:18.880]  rights, the rights to move about freely, the rights to travel.
[04:18.880 --> 04:21.720]  And I think we need to stop making those privileges.
[04:21.720 --> 04:27.000]  But of course, Bill O'Reilly and the people who want big government always use cars and
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.720]  airports as the template for how they're going to take more of freedoms.
[04:31.720 --> 04:37.800]  And they also point out in this that Hillary is now talking about not assault rifles, but
[04:37.800 --> 04:39.760]  assault pistols.
[04:39.760 --> 04:40.760]  What does that mean?
[04:40.760 --> 04:43.880]  You know, an assault rifle is not defined.
[04:43.880 --> 04:45.880]  Even the liberal papers admit that.
[04:45.880 --> 04:49.920]  It's simply something that they want to make you afraid about.
[04:49.920 --> 04:50.920]  Stay with us when we come back.
[04:50.920 --> 04:54.400]  Alex Jones is going to join us from the road and give us his perspective.
[04:54.400 --> 04:57.400]  We'll be right back.
[04:57.400 --> 05:05.480]  Federal investigators are trying to find out more specifically what Omar Mateen's wife
[05:05.480 --> 05:08.840]  knew about the planned attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.
[05:08.840 --> 05:12.040]  There's just one problem, Nor Salman is missing.
[05:12.040 --> 05:16.160]  The Sun Sentinel conducted an interview with Siddiq Mateen, the shooter's father, in which
[05:16.160 --> 05:18.960]  he has heard saying that Salman was not around here.
[05:18.960 --> 05:21.440]  I don't know where she is, but she's not here.
[05:21.440 --> 05:26.680]  Most disturbing of all, according to breaking 911 citing CNN, U.S. Attorney General Loretta
[05:26.680 --> 05:30.480]  Lynch says that she doesn't know if Salman has left the state or not.
[05:30.480 --> 05:36.040]  Now it's possible that Nor Salman has given federal authorities the slip is beyond comprehension.
[05:36.040 --> 05:37.520]  So let me get this straight.
[05:37.520 --> 05:42.920]  Federal authorities are continually bypassing the Constitution in violation of our rights
[05:42.920 --> 05:48.520]  so that in the name of terrorism, they can conduct unconstitutional and completely useless
[05:48.520 --> 05:49.520]  spying.
[05:49.520 --> 05:52.360]  But perhaps the department just needs more funding.
[05:52.360 --> 05:53.960]  That always seems to do the trick.
[05:53.960 --> 06:04.640]  Leigh Ann McAdoo for infowars.com.
[06:04.640 --> 06:09.600]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[06:09.600 --> 06:14.360]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[06:14.360 --> 06:20.080]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[06:20.080 --> 06:25.880]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[06:25.880 --> 06:27.160]  spreading disease around.
[06:27.160 --> 06:29.760]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[06:29.760 --> 06:30.760]  These are all parasites.
[06:30.760 --> 06:32.120]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said.
[06:32.120 --> 06:33.480]  There's so many things that are in it.
[06:33.480 --> 06:34.720]  You have the neem in there.
[06:34.720 --> 06:37.800]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[06:37.800 --> 06:41.160]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[06:41.160 --> 06:42.160]  All right.
[06:42.160 --> 06:44.280]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[06:44.280 --> 06:45.440]  It just came back in yesterday.
[06:45.440 --> 06:46.440]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[06:46.440 --> 06:50.000]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body.
[06:50.000 --> 06:51.000]  Period.
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.400]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[06:54.400 --> 06:56.640]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[06:56.640 --> 07:00.400]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[07:00.400 --> 07:04.360]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[07:04.360 --> 07:09.720]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Info War, a 360 win.
[07:09.720 --> 07:14.680]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[07:14.680 --> 07:16.280]  at infowarsore.com.
[07:16.280 --> 07:20.120]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[07:20.120 --> 07:24.200]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[07:24.200 --> 07:29.440]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[07:29.440 --> 07:33.640]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the
[07:33.640 --> 07:35.280]  products that you need each month.
[07:35.280 --> 07:39.920]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and
[07:39.920 --> 07:43.040]  choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[07:43.040 --> 07:48.360]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[07:48.360 --> 07:49.720]  this is a sure win.
[07:49.720 --> 07:55.720]  10% off on auto ship, win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[07:55.720 --> 08:17.880]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[08:17.880 --> 08:24.480]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[08:24.480 --> 08:29.640]  This is Alex Jones.
[08:29.640 --> 08:34.060]  People talk a lot about being awake, but what does that really mean?
[08:34.060 --> 08:39.960]  The entire modern political system, the entire modern media system is about putting you into
[08:39.960 --> 08:44.200]  a controlled paradigm of limited information.
[08:44.200 --> 08:51.080]  And all of the major markers show that IQs are dropping, cognitive ability is imploding.
[08:51.080 --> 08:56.120]  People are becoming more and more ignorant, more and more shuttered, more and more on
[08:56.120 --> 09:00.320]  a psychological and spiritual reservation.
[09:00.320 --> 09:04.080]  To be free, I'm not saying you have to believe what Alex Jones believes.
[09:04.080 --> 09:09.920]  I'm simply saying you have to get outside that controlled reservation of globalist social
[09:09.920 --> 09:16.240]  engineering and think for yourself and realize there's a wider universe of mystery and majesty
[09:16.240 --> 09:17.880]  all around us.
[09:17.880 --> 09:23.160]  And that as long as we stand for individual freedom, as long as we stand for the individual
[09:23.160 --> 09:28.040]  to be able to try to live out their own destiny, we are brothers and sisters no matter what
[09:28.040 --> 09:32.120]  color we are or what region of the world we come from.
[09:32.120 --> 09:34.480]  That truly unifies us.
[09:34.480 --> 09:39.240]  The globalists are trying to create an artificial construct where they unify us around the idea
[09:39.240 --> 09:44.160]  of a central control system where we don't criticize anybody or we don't have any basic
[09:44.160 --> 09:50.520]  free will and we take the central directives from a planned economy, a planned computer
[09:50.520 --> 09:56.760]  driven system to decide what jobs we have or where we go to school or where we travel
[09:56.760 --> 09:58.400]  or what we have for dinner.
[09:58.400 --> 10:02.800]  They're selling collectivism as the idea of giving up our individuality.
[10:02.800 --> 10:05.040]  That's counterfeit collectivism.
[10:05.040 --> 10:12.480]  True collectivism in the human sense is totally individual and totally independent and absolutely
[10:12.480 --> 10:15.520]  democratic.
[10:15.520 --> 10:17.480]  Democracies in a mass center are very dangerous.
[10:17.480 --> 10:21.600]  You can get 51% to vote to make the other 49% slaves.
[10:21.600 --> 10:27.120]  That's why in a republic, basic liberties of all, including the minority, are protected.
[10:27.120 --> 10:32.720]  But in a democracy of the free market, where you vote for the music you like by what you
[10:32.720 --> 10:36.720]  listen to and what you support, where you vote for the food you like by what you buy
[10:36.720 --> 10:42.440]  and what you promote, where you vote for the education you like by where you sell your
[10:42.440 --> 10:48.560]  children or where you go for secondary education, that is the true diversity, that is the true
[10:48.560 --> 10:49.560]  unifier.
[10:49.560 --> 10:54.680]  And we've seen in the last few weeks tragic Islamic attacks in Europe and the Middle East
[10:54.680 --> 10:58.960]  and also here in the United States on lesbians and gays and others.
[10:58.960 --> 11:03.320]  And it's really been a big wake up call for these people that believe the state cares
[11:03.320 --> 11:08.000]  about them to understand that this state and other states have brought in these radical
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.440]  Islamics because they're more compatible with what the globalists want to build than an open
[11:12.440 --> 11:13.440]  free society.
[11:13.440 --> 11:18.480]  And to see gun shops all over the United States, like right here in Texas in Houston, offering
[11:18.480 --> 11:24.040]  people free shooting lessons and free training, reaching out to them and saying gun owners
[11:24.040 --> 11:29.400]  don't hate you, gun owners on average aren't bigots, gun owners want you as a human to
[11:29.400 --> 11:35.880]  be able to protect yourself and even the odds when some monstrous killer comes in to take
[11:35.880 --> 11:37.720]  your lives of others.
[11:37.720 --> 11:38.720]  That's what it's all about.
[11:38.720 --> 11:42.800]  That's why guns are this great equalizer, it's why the establishment pushes to take
[11:42.800 --> 11:46.720]  guns from the general population because they want to be the only ones with the guns.
[11:46.720 --> 11:49.600]  And I know that's incredibly simple, but it's true.
[11:49.600 --> 11:52.920]  Every other nation on earth, except for a few like Switzerland, have taken the guns
[11:52.920 --> 11:58.680]  from their people and they're all moving steadily into corruption, into authoritarianism.
[11:58.680 --> 12:02.800]  The few nations that haven't taken the guns like Switzerland have the lowest crime rates
[12:02.800 --> 12:06.480]  in the world, the highest standards of living, because they're truly citizens.
[12:06.480 --> 12:08.920]  They're truly trusted by the state.
[12:08.920 --> 12:14.360]  The people are the state and so they are empowered, they have choices, they have great freedom,
[12:14.360 --> 12:22.720]  they have lower taxes because, because ladies and gentlemen, they are the state.
[12:22.720 --> 12:27.240]  We need a small state because we need to have the manifestation of our individual will through
[12:27.240 --> 12:33.400]  a collective be minimized because historically it's so incredibly dangerous.
[12:33.400 --> 12:38.880]  That's because that's collectivism centralized and focused like a laser, it can be destructive.
[12:38.880 --> 12:44.960]  But when true individually expressed collectivism, these are my own views, but everyone sees
[12:44.960 --> 12:49.560]  them as evident and true because they're universal, they're obvious truth, promifacial.
[12:49.560 --> 12:55.280]  When individuals make choices, that is the crowdsourcing of common sense and that is
[12:55.280 --> 13:01.880]  the ultimate in the expression of free will by individuals, but in a collective spectrum
[13:01.880 --> 13:08.200]  that truly brings us the Renaissance and the huge palette of choices we have today.
[13:08.200 --> 13:12.000]  Let's continue to discuss the nature of the world and how to truly break the matrix and
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.000]  become free.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.400]  And again, I don't have all the answers, my friends.
[13:15.400 --> 13:20.080]  I simply understand basic universal truths throughout time memorial that have empowered
[13:20.080 --> 13:23.400]  and unleashed the true potential of humanity.
[13:23.400 --> 13:29.240]  Okay, and that's Alex Jones on the road and he's going to be joining us with a special
[13:29.240 --> 13:30.840]  report at the bottom of the hour as well.
[13:30.840 --> 13:36.520]  Now, the top stories that are breaking today are the major speech by Donald Trump defining
[13:36.520 --> 13:38.520]  Hillary.
[13:38.520 --> 13:42.400]  And we have a report from the road about Hillary for prison.
[13:42.400 --> 13:49.080]  Actually Slate Magazine wrote a story about a person at the Donald Trump rally in Las
[13:49.080 --> 13:53.680]  Vegas on Saturday and spent a great deal of time talking about her Hillary for prison
[13:53.680 --> 13:54.680]  t-shirt.
[13:54.680 --> 13:56.480]  And that was the title of the article.
[13:56.480 --> 13:57.480]  We're going to tell you about that.
[13:57.480 --> 14:01.440]  We're also, we're going to have Lord Moncton joining us in the second hour.
[14:01.440 --> 14:03.600]  We're going to be talking about Brexit.
[14:03.600 --> 14:05.720]  All eyes internationally are on Brexit.
[14:05.720 --> 14:10.640]  Look, you have to understand the election that we have here in America with Donald Trump
[14:10.640 --> 14:11.720]  as well as Brexit.
[14:11.720 --> 14:12.920]  They're all about the same issue.
[14:12.920 --> 14:17.000]  We just had the first female mayor of Rome elected.
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.400]  A lot of people focus on the fact in the mainstream media of first female mayor of Rome.
[14:22.400 --> 14:30.080]  The real story is that she's a populist mayor, that she is against the consolidation of power
[14:30.080 --> 14:31.080]  into the EU.
[14:31.080 --> 14:35.600]  Now, they can't portray her as a far right extremist because she's not.
[14:35.600 --> 14:38.200]  She's a lefty environmentalist.
[14:38.200 --> 14:41.760]  And so they kind of, many of them don't even want to talk about her politics and just talk
[14:41.760 --> 14:43.680]  about the fact that she's female.
[14:43.680 --> 14:48.480]  But it's very important because that is another example of how people across the political
[14:48.480 --> 14:54.040]  spectrum want to take back control of their lives locally instead of surrendering it to
[14:54.040 --> 14:55.040]  a distant bureaucracy.
[14:55.040 --> 15:00.040]  So we're going to be talking to Lord Moncton about what's going on in Brexit because it
[15:00.040 --> 15:02.320]  affects all of us.
[15:02.320 --> 15:07.040]  There is a globalist consolidation that's going on, a consolidation of power.
[15:07.040 --> 15:10.680]  And the question is, is Britain going to remain a nation?
[15:10.680 --> 15:15.160]  Or is it going to be subsumed into this collective globalist borg?
[15:15.160 --> 15:16.840]  And the same thing is true of America.
[15:16.840 --> 15:18.520]  Is America going to remain a nation?
[15:18.520 --> 15:20.480]  Or are we going to lose our sovereignty?
[15:20.480 --> 15:24.560]  Because that's what's going to happen if the Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnerships
[15:24.560 --> 15:25.560]  happen.
[15:25.560 --> 15:31.080]  Our trade, our economy, is going to be managed by a committee that we have absolutely no
[15:31.080 --> 15:32.440]  control over.
[15:32.440 --> 15:34.080]  There's no election of this committee.
[15:34.080 --> 15:38.040]  And they can rewrite the terms of that agreement, which will rewrite the terms of our economy
[15:38.040 --> 15:39.640]  at will.
[15:39.640 --> 15:45.240]  Senator Sessions, who many of us believe, I hope that Donald Trump will pick him as Vice
[15:45.240 --> 15:46.480]  President, has laid that out.
[15:46.480 --> 15:47.960]  He says it's a living document.
[15:47.960 --> 15:51.160]  You don't know what this thing is going to become once you've passed it.
[15:51.160 --> 15:56.120]  But let's take a look real quickly at some of the first snippets of what Donald Trump
[15:56.120 --> 15:57.680]  was saying about Hillary Clinton today.
[15:57.680 --> 16:00.320]  We have an article that's up on the Dredge Report.
[16:00.320 --> 16:05.520]  Kit Daniels Trump says, Hillary takes millions from anti-gay, anti-women regimes.
[16:05.520 --> 16:07.040]  And she wants Sharia migrants.
[16:07.040 --> 16:12.080]  He points out Hillary Clinton takes millions of dollars from these regimes in the Middle
[16:12.080 --> 16:13.080]  East.
[16:13.080 --> 16:17.200]  I don't want to admit people who share our values, who love our people, but Hillary Clinton
[16:17.200 --> 16:21.440]  wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and that gays should be
[16:21.440 --> 16:22.440]  put to death.
[16:22.440 --> 16:27.480]  He says the government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of
[16:27.480 --> 16:32.160]  Hillary's trans-specific partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the
[16:32.160 --> 16:33.160]  chance.
[16:33.160 --> 16:34.160]  Absolutely.
[16:34.160 --> 16:37.920]  That's why the establishment and both parties support Hillary.
[16:37.920 --> 16:42.760]  This election is about the consolidation of globalist power.
[16:42.760 --> 16:44.280]  She is the one who will give it to them.
[16:44.280 --> 16:47.120]  Donald Trump is the one who stands in their way, just like Brexit.
[16:47.120 --> 16:50.800]  That's why we've got all of the corporations, all the political establishment.
[16:50.800 --> 16:59.640]  Obama was in Britain stumping against Brexit to keep them in the European Union.
[16:59.640 --> 17:04.480]  Trump says Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay
[17:04.480 --> 17:06.000]  is also punishable by death.
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.120]  They bragged that they gave her 20% of what she took in.
[17:09.120 --> 17:12.960]  Now, take a look at this Wall Street Journal article, for example.
[17:12.960 --> 17:18.760]  This is an article about Saudi Arabian women who love to ride bumper cars.
[17:18.760 --> 17:22.960]  Now, they don't do it because they get a kick out of bumping each other.
[17:22.960 --> 17:26.880]  They do it because they're so desperate for a little taste of freedom.
[17:26.880 --> 17:32.400]  Look at that picture, two women in a burka sitting in a bumper car.
[17:32.400 --> 17:36.240]  And that's the only time they can get behind the wheel in that oppressive regime.
[17:36.240 --> 17:40.480]  Do you think they got a bumper sticker on that bumper car that says, I'm for Hillary,
[17:40.480 --> 17:41.880]  I'm with her?
[17:41.880 --> 17:43.440]  I don't think so.
[17:43.440 --> 17:45.320]  I don't think so.
[17:45.320 --> 17:47.520]  Bumper burkas, I guess you could call the ride.
[17:47.520 --> 17:48.520]  I don't know.
[17:48.520 --> 17:49.520]  But you know what?
[17:49.520 --> 17:51.120]  Donald Trump had a great line in his speech.
[17:51.120 --> 17:52.680]  Look at that picture, that illustration.
[17:52.680 --> 17:53.680]  That is priceless.
[17:53.680 --> 17:58.480]  A woman in a burka is a Wall Street Journal, typical kind of a woodcut illustration with
[17:58.480 --> 18:02.560]  a woman in a burka sitting in a bumper car.
[18:02.560 --> 18:04.840]  She always, her slogan, I'm with her.
[18:04.840 --> 18:07.680]  Donald Trump says, you know what, I'm with you.
[18:07.680 --> 18:08.680]  I support you.
[18:08.680 --> 18:13.960]  I'm not asking you to get behind me and make me an emperor, okay?
[18:13.960 --> 18:14.960]  Like Hillary Clinton is.
[18:14.960 --> 18:16.800]  Now listen to what happens in Saudi Arabia.
[18:16.800 --> 18:17.800]  This is important.
[18:17.800 --> 18:21.640]  Here's a woman that talking about how she drove in circles and the cars came in her
[18:21.640 --> 18:22.640]  direction.
[18:22.640 --> 18:24.280]  She swore these were electric bumper cars.
[18:24.280 --> 18:27.400]  But in Saudi Arabia, the ride doesn't always live up to his name.
[18:27.400 --> 18:29.400]  She says, I come here to drive.
[18:29.400 --> 18:31.120]  She's a 27-year-old homemaker.
[18:31.120 --> 18:35.240]  She's still giddy from the roughly five-minute, mostly crash-free ride in her red and green
[18:35.240 --> 18:36.240]  two-seater.
[18:36.240 --> 18:38.720]  She says it's much better than bumping against others.
[18:38.720 --> 18:44.980]  This is at a weekly ladies' night only, where women can discard their headscarves and their
[18:44.980 --> 18:51.680]  head-to-toe black gowns to reveal the latest fashion trends, ripped jeans, tank tops, tossed
[18:51.680 --> 18:53.280]  to the side, 80s style hair.
[18:53.280 --> 18:56.920]  Now there's no men at all in the park on this night.
[18:56.920 --> 19:02.040]  All the women, all the entire amusement park is run by women's staff.
[19:02.040 --> 19:05.960]  They said the biggest draw of the amusement park isn't the new hours, however, of fashion
[19:05.960 --> 19:06.960]  freedom.
[19:06.960 --> 19:09.680]  Instead, they go there to get behind the wheel.
[19:09.680 --> 19:13.760]  Even a bumper car wheel in a country that bans female drivers.
[19:13.760 --> 19:16.160]  There's no loud bangs, no ferocious head-on crashes.
[19:16.160 --> 19:20.520]  There's a few slow-speed collisions, but also a lot of women who are dodging, as women are
[19:20.520 --> 19:25.920]  content to just glide over the smooth surface with a little tiny steering wheel in their
[19:25.920 --> 19:26.920]  hand.
[19:26.920 --> 19:27.920]  Isn't that sad?
[19:27.920 --> 19:30.640]  Are we going to be like that when the driverless cars take over?
[19:30.640 --> 19:32.720]  Are we going to be that repressed?
[19:32.720 --> 19:34.000]  But this is what's going on here.
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.320]  They say they love to drive the cars, and when the men come here, they're always bumping.
[19:37.320 --> 19:41.600]  But if you bump the ladies, they scream at you and say, hey, I came here to drive.
[19:41.600 --> 19:42.600]  Stop that.
[19:42.600 --> 19:44.600]  And then the night is over.
[19:44.600 --> 19:50.400]  And they have to walk out and put on their hoods, and the men pick them up.
[19:50.400 --> 19:55.120]  Because the religious police in Saudi Arabia, the supporters that Hillary Clinton prostitutes
[19:55.120 --> 19:59.000]  herself for, will arrest them, will beat them.
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  Save it.
[20:00.000 --> 20:01.000]  This will be right back.
[20:01.000 --> 20:05.840]  There's nothing more enticing and intoxicating than the finest meat-cooking on an open claim.

[23:58.560 --> 24:14.720]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight on this Wednesday, June 22nd, 2016.
[24:14.720 --> 24:20.440]  Of course, the big issues before us today are another attempt at gun control coming
[24:20.440 --> 24:21.680]  from the Senate.
[24:21.680 --> 24:24.880]  We have a major policy speech, I would put it that way.
[24:24.880 --> 24:29.960]  Just talking about Hillary Clinton, but folks, if you're a criminal and a liar, that's been
[24:29.960 --> 24:30.960]  her policy.
[24:30.960 --> 24:34.320]  Okay, so he's defining her policy by defining her.
[24:34.320 --> 24:38.200]  And then we're also going to have Lord Moncton joining us in the second hour, in the next
[24:38.200 --> 24:42.480]  hour, to talk about Brexit, which is the vote is going to happen tomorrow.
[24:42.480 --> 24:44.920]  And that's a global issue.
[24:44.920 --> 24:47.080]  We've talked about that just a moment ago.
[24:47.080 --> 24:49.880]  But I want to talk about this story from Slate.
[24:49.880 --> 24:55.320]  Now last Saturday, Donald Trump was in Las Vegas, and Slate wrote an article that just
[24:55.320 --> 24:56.320]  came out.
[24:56.320 --> 25:02.360]  And the title of the article was Hillary for Prison 2016, and it's like, whoa, that's
[25:02.360 --> 25:03.360]  like our t-shirt.
[25:03.360 --> 25:05.560]  It's like, yeah, it's exactly like our t-shirt.
[25:05.560 --> 25:09.880]  The whole article, the beginning of the article, is about our t-shirt.
[25:09.880 --> 25:15.840]  And they talked to a lady, and I believe her name is pronounced Kate, it's K-H-A-I-T, I'm
[25:15.840 --> 25:17.320]  sorry if I'm mispronouncing it.
[25:17.320 --> 25:22.440]  And then Kate, a 27-year-old professional poker player, and a contestant on the latest
[25:22.440 --> 25:27.440]  season of Survivor, was standing next to the entrance of the Cirque du Soleil's Mystery
[25:27.440 --> 25:31.240]  in the Treasure Island Hotel, explaining the shirt she was wearing.
[25:31.240 --> 25:33.760]  And it read, Hillary for Prison 2016.
[25:33.760 --> 25:37.000]  She says, I got this on infowars.com.
[25:37.000 --> 25:38.800]  I love this shirt, she said.
[25:38.800 --> 25:41.240]  There's so many people walking by and saying, I love this shirt.
[25:41.240 --> 25:42.240]  I love this shirt.
[25:42.240 --> 25:43.240]  Give me a high five.
[25:43.240 --> 25:48.120]  At this moment, a middle-aged black woman stopped to compliment Kate on her shirt.
[25:48.120 --> 25:51.920]  Yay, Hillary for Prison, Kate explained it gently.
[25:51.920 --> 25:53.480]  Oh, you want her in prison?
[25:53.480 --> 25:54.480]  The woman asked.
[25:54.480 --> 25:57.280]  She's a criminal, Kate replied.
[25:57.280 --> 26:02.320]  And if you want to have a conversation starter by this lady that they were talking about,
[26:02.320 --> 26:05.120]  you can get your Hillary for Prison t-shirt at infowars.
[26:05.120 --> 26:11.960]  We've even got a special on it, a limited special, 50% off for one week, and it started
[26:11.960 --> 26:12.960]  yesterday.
[26:12.960 --> 26:15.240]  It's not that long.
[26:15.240 --> 26:21.560]  And get the next one for 75% off, 50% off the first one, 75% off the second one.
[26:21.560 --> 26:26.560]  And as you heard, it looks like Hillary for President because the lady who walked by thought
[26:26.560 --> 26:27.560]  that's what it was.
[26:27.560 --> 26:28.640]  I said, yay, Hillary.
[26:28.640 --> 26:32.360]  But if you look closely, it says Hillary for Prison.
[26:32.360 --> 26:37.840]  And that's precisely where she needs to be in the big house, not the White House.
[26:37.840 --> 26:42.600]  Okay, now, Donald Trump is out saying that Hillary is a world-class liar.
[26:42.600 --> 26:45.480]  Let's play this clip from today's speech.
[26:45.480 --> 26:47.280]  Hillary Clinton.
[26:47.280 --> 26:53.240]  And as you know, she, most people know, she's a world-class liar.
[26:53.240 --> 27:04.480]  Just look at her pathetic email server statements or her phony landing.
[27:04.480 --> 27:10.400]  Or her phony landing in Bosnia, where she said she was under attack and the attack turned
[27:10.400 --> 27:18.880]  out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total and, look, this was one of the beauts.
[27:18.880 --> 27:19.880]  Okay.
[27:19.880 --> 27:23.000]  A total and self-serving lie.
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.080]  So is he overstepping this?
[27:25.080 --> 27:28.040]  Is he going a little bit too far, calling her a world-class liar?
[27:28.040 --> 27:29.320]  Let's fact check that.
[27:29.320 --> 27:32.600]  Let's play the clip from CBS News when she was in Bosnia.
[27:32.600 --> 27:33.600]  Here's that clip.
[27:33.600 --> 27:38.200]  There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead, we just
[27:38.200 --> 27:43.360]  ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.
[27:43.360 --> 27:45.520]  Problem is, that's not what happened.
[27:45.520 --> 27:50.800]  And we should know, CBS News accompanied the First Lady and daughter Chelsea on that Bosnia
[27:50.800 --> 27:51.800]  trip.
[27:51.800 --> 27:55.440]  That's Senator Clinton talking to me on the military flight into Tuzla.
[27:55.440 --> 27:59.560]  And these are the pictures we recorded of the greeting ceremony when the plane landed.
[27:59.560 --> 28:02.160]  Compare that to Senator Clinton's account.
[28:02.160 --> 28:04.560]  I remember landing under sniper fire.
[28:04.560 --> 28:08.600]  There was no greeting ceremony, and we basically were told to run to our cars.
[28:08.600 --> 28:09.600]  Now that is what happened.
[28:09.600 --> 28:10.600]  Thank you.
[28:10.600 --> 28:11.600]  Getting kisses from little girls.
[28:11.600 --> 28:15.360]  There was no sniper fire either when Senator Clinton visited two army outposts, where she
[28:15.360 --> 28:23.160]  posed for photos, and no sniper fire back at the base, where she sang at a USO show
[28:23.160 --> 28:25.640]  starring Sinbad and Sheryl Crow.
[28:25.640 --> 28:28.840]  I can't buy no more.
[28:28.840 --> 28:30.920]  Yeah, she's a world-class liar.
[28:30.920 --> 28:31.920]  No doubt about it.
[28:31.920 --> 28:34.960]  Okay, here's some of the other things that Donald Trump said.
[28:34.960 --> 28:37.920]  Her server, of course that's what he was just talking about, he goes, she's lying about
[28:37.920 --> 28:38.920]  this server thing.
[28:38.920 --> 28:42.840]  He said her server was easily hacked by foreign governments, perhaps even by her financial
[28:42.840 --> 28:47.360]  backers in Communist China, putting all of America in danger.
[28:47.360 --> 28:53.880]  And he went on to say, I don't know what's in those deleted emails, but our enemies probably
[28:53.880 --> 28:54.880]  do.
[28:54.880 --> 28:55.880]  Oh no, it's not a probably.
[28:55.880 --> 28:56.880]  He soft sold that.
[28:56.880 --> 28:58.240]  It's a definitely.
[28:58.240 --> 29:01.520]  Our enemies definitely know what's in that.
[29:01.520 --> 29:09.440]  Look, if Guccifer could hack into these private servers, and the guy is not even an IT specialist,
[29:09.440 --> 29:12.320]  he just guessed at their passwords, okay?
[29:12.320 --> 29:18.280]  You can bet that the private server of the Secretary of State is a target.
[29:18.280 --> 29:24.120]  We've had the Federal Reserve hacked 50 different times because they want to know what the private
[29:24.120 --> 29:25.440]  discussions of the Federal Reserve are.
[29:25.440 --> 29:27.560]  You think they'd want to know what the State Department's talking about?
[29:27.560 --> 29:32.240]  He says, yeah, they probably have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President
[29:32.240 --> 29:34.240]  of the United States.
[29:34.240 --> 29:35.240]  Exactly.
[29:35.240 --> 29:36.640]  Stay with us when we come back.
[29:36.640 --> 29:49.680]  Alex Jones will be joining us.
[29:49.680 --> 29:50.960]  We're on the march.
[29:50.960 --> 29:53.400]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.400 --> 30:01.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.320 --> 30:06.440]  Brexit D-Day looms with trillions of dollars at stake in decades of scheming to concentrate
[30:06.440 --> 30:07.440]  political power.
[30:07.440 --> 30:12.080]  The organized globalists are pulling out all the stops in a final desperate push to frighten
[30:12.080 --> 30:16.600]  British voters away from reclaiming sovereignty and control over their own lives, their own
[30:16.600 --> 30:19.080]  finances, and their own borders.
[30:19.080 --> 30:24.720]  It speaks volumes that Rothschild, Soros, Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase,
[30:24.720 --> 30:30.560]  BlackRock, the Carlisle Group have been threatening apocalyptic-level consequences if the UK leaves
[30:30.560 --> 30:31.560]  the EU.
[30:31.560 --> 30:36.760]  The movement to leave the EU was gaining steady momentum until the assassination of Joe Cox,
[30:36.760 --> 30:41.240]  the pro-remain member of parliament, who was brutally shot and stabbed to death on June
[30:41.240 --> 30:42.240]  16.
[30:42.240 --> 30:47.200]  Immediately as if on cue, the pro-globalist press exploited the tragedy to condemn the
[30:47.200 --> 30:48.440]  Leave campaign.
[30:48.440 --> 30:52.720]  Will Britons reclaim their sovereignty and be in control of their own destiny?
[30:52.720 --> 30:55.840]  Find out Thursday on the June 23rd, Brexit referendum.

[32:50.920 --> 32:54.600]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how Young Jevity and the products
[32:54.600 --> 32:57.080]  at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[32:57.080 --> 33:25.880]  Check it out for yourself today.
[33:28.080 --> 33:34.040]  This is what the establishment media does, attempting to totally control the narrative
[33:34.040 --> 33:35.920]  of our lives.
[33:35.920 --> 33:41.000]  They tell us that Obamacare does not have death panels, even though they admit now it
[33:41.000 --> 33:42.000]  does.
[33:42.000 --> 33:43.240]  They tell us Obamacare is free.
[33:43.240 --> 33:46.440]  Then it cuts your bill in half.
[33:46.440 --> 33:49.640]  Then it's the cost of a phone or cable bill.
[33:49.640 --> 33:54.560]  Then you can keep your doctor and then of course we have one of the architects of it,
[33:54.560 --> 34:01.280]  Gruber, on C-SPAN saying thank God the American people are so stupid and don't have attention
[34:01.280 --> 34:02.280]  spans.
[34:02.280 --> 34:08.800]  Then he says that he never said that and seven more videos at least come out of him bragging
[34:08.800 --> 34:13.160]  about developing the deceptive plan to be used against the American people.
[34:13.160 --> 34:21.680]  It's that same tactic we see out of Slate Magazine with their latest headline.
[34:21.680 --> 34:29.080]  Slate Magazine comes out with this demonization campaign and says oh my gosh, the incredible
[34:29.080 --> 34:37.080]  conspiracy theory from Alex Jones that Hillary needs to go to prison.
[34:37.080 --> 34:42.120]  The idea that she's committed any crimes, the idea that she should be prosecuted, it's
[34:42.120 --> 34:47.200]  as Asinine as saying that maybe Richard Nixon should be prosecuted, except Richard Nixon
[34:47.200 --> 34:49.000]  did nothing compared to her.
[34:49.000 --> 34:55.000]  But they sit there and they shake their fingers at us and they make fun of us and they just
[34:55.000 --> 35:01.600]  imply that none of this is happening, hoping that the most dumbed down elements of society
[35:01.600 --> 35:05.640]  out there don't actually look into the facts, but I mean just imagine this now.
[35:05.640 --> 35:14.080]  If now conspiracy theory, if you wear a t-shirt that says Hillary for prison 2016, obviously
[35:14.080 --> 35:21.240]  a pun saying instead of being in the Oval Office she needs to be in the reopened Alcatraz.
[35:21.240 --> 35:26.000]  So this is how they manipulate society, this is how they manipulate culture and it's totally
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.320]  and completely sick and that's why I'm intensifying my efforts.
[35:30.320 --> 35:32.280]  They're really upset about this meme.
[35:32.280 --> 35:35.400]  They see it at Donald Trump rallies, other rallies all over the country.
[35:35.400 --> 35:42.000]  There are hundreds of other t-shirt shops and things online now imitating the shirt or making
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.320]  the variance of it, personally I'm totally fine with that because I wanted this to be
[35:47.320 --> 35:50.360]  a meme that was picked up by the American people.
[35:50.360 --> 35:54.560]  I wanted this to be a meme that went completely viral and showed the power.
[35:54.560 --> 36:00.240]  It's not about selling t-shirts for 1995, but speaking of the devil, they're 995 right
[36:00.240 --> 36:05.600]  now for the first shirt you get, the second shirt you get in the same order is 495, that
[36:05.600 --> 36:13.720]  is 75% off, ladies and gentlemen, 75% off and imagine the power, if tens of thousands
[36:13.720 --> 36:19.520]  more of these shirts go out, imagine the power of those being seen at events all over the
[36:19.520 --> 36:25.360]  country, all over television, really breaking the Berlin wall of control and saying to the
[36:25.360 --> 36:30.120]  social engineers, yes, we want Hillary Clinton to go to prison, yes, we want her investigated
[36:30.120 --> 36:37.040]  for Benghazi and back to the cattle gate futures and Vince Foster and Fast and Furious and her
[36:37.040 --> 36:43.480]  foundation and everything this criminal administration and this group of mafias are involved in.
[36:43.480 --> 36:48.600]  So that's what it comes down to, that's what we the people want, it's what common sense
[36:48.600 --> 36:57.200]  shows and the attempt by the social engineers to pull this operation off, the attempt by
[36:57.200 --> 37:02.640]  the globalists to sit there and make us feel like we're weird, we're alone, we're strange
[37:02.640 --> 37:10.520]  and that it's bizarre to actually call for these criminals to get in trouble is just
[37:10.520 --> 37:11.520]  asinine.
[37:11.520 --> 37:17.520]  Their hoax is falling, their attempt to control reality is just dissipating and the only facade
[37:17.520 --> 37:21.720]  left is that free thinkers still think that we're somewhat alone and don't realize the
[37:21.720 --> 37:26.760]  real power we have and it is something like a Moan Labe shirt or a come and take a shirt
[37:26.760 --> 37:32.040]  or Hillary for prison shirt from infowarstore.com that A, funds the info war with the latest
[37:32.040 --> 37:38.360]  info but B, allows the public to really interface with each other and realize how many of us
[37:38.360 --> 37:43.000]  there really are and so that we can have our own narrative, we can challenge their false
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.040]  reality and bring in common sense.
[37:45.040 --> 37:52.120]  So I challenge folks to take advantage of the 75% off, you can go to infowars.com forward
[37:52.120 --> 37:58.440]  slash show and you can also find links right there to the newsletter infowars.com forward
[37:58.440 --> 38:02.800]  slash newsletter but both of those pages have links to each other, put in your email and
[38:02.800 --> 38:08.480]  we'll send you a promo code for 75% off the second shirt, 50% off the first shirt and
[38:08.480 --> 38:12.000]  again we're not really making a profit off this but it's all about just getting the
[38:12.000 --> 38:17.320]  word out and really rubbing salt in the wound because this meme hasn't scared.
[38:17.320 --> 38:23.840]  This meme absolutely is symbolic of the villagers coming with their pitchforks, coming with
[38:23.840 --> 38:28.400]  their hatchets towards the castle and the social engineers are absolutely aware of the
[38:28.400 --> 38:34.240]  fact that the media has a 6% trust rate, the major national AP poll, they know the Congress
[38:34.240 --> 38:38.160]  has a 9% approval rating in the ballot poll, they know they're a pack of criminals, they
[38:38.160 --> 38:41.800]  know they're a pack of scum, they know they've committed crimes so great that they've doubled
[38:41.800 --> 38:47.800]  and tripled down all the way to the next level and that they're trying to fail forward, she
[38:47.800 --> 38:52.200]  needs to get into the presidency to cover up her past crimes and persecute her enemies.
[38:52.200 --> 38:57.320]  So we are full steam ahead exposing this, Hillary for President 2016 and Slate and all
[38:57.320 --> 39:01.960]  the other established republicans, the New York Times has talked about it, they all show
[39:01.960 --> 39:05.760]  their weakness when they sit there and demonize this and they sit there and try to shut this
[39:05.760 --> 39:08.280]  down because they know it's having a giant effect.
[39:08.280 --> 39:13.560]  Now back to David Knight, Paul Watson and others that are co-hosting this live global
[39:13.560 --> 39:14.560]  Wednesday transmission.
[39:14.560 --> 39:15.560]  Thank you, Alex.
[39:15.560 --> 39:22.440]  That's Alex Jones and of course today is a major speech from Donald Trump, he said I'm
[39:22.440 --> 39:27.760]  going to have a major speech on Monday, I'm going to define Hillary and of course that
[39:27.760 --> 39:32.640]  didn't happen because we had the Orlando shooting stories that came out over that weekend.
[39:32.640 --> 39:38.080]  So here we are about 10 days after that and the speech has come out and it is a major
[39:38.080 --> 39:43.760]  speech, he hit her with everything essentially but he starts out by talking about the economy.
[39:43.760 --> 39:48.440]  That is a key issue folks, people vote their pocketbook, it's the economy stupid, that's
[39:48.440 --> 39:54.240]  what the Clinton campaign said when they won and of course that is a very powerful weapon
[39:54.240 --> 39:58.840]  for Donald Trump and it is something most people believe, rightfully so, that he can
[39:58.840 --> 40:04.280]  do a far better job than Hillary Clinton of relieving us of the burdens that the federal
[40:04.280 --> 40:07.680]  government has put on us and one of the things he says is of course he's going to change
[40:07.680 --> 40:12.160]  immigration rules to give unemployed Americans opportunities to get good jobs.
[40:12.160 --> 40:19.040]  He stands to, he vows to stand up for countries that cheat on US trade and we need to understand
[40:19.040 --> 40:20.040]  folks.
[40:20.040 --> 40:25.120]  When you bring in workers, when you export jobs, when you say as Hillary Clinton does
[40:25.120 --> 40:31.320]  she's going to give blanket amnesty to people and yet look at the massive numbers of people,
[40:31.320 --> 40:36.600]  even the Federal Reserve is saying the unemployment numbers are totally bogus, they don't include
[40:36.600 --> 40:41.280]  people who have given up looking for work or who haven't been able to find a job for
[40:41.280 --> 40:44.200]  a very long time, they just exclude them.
[40:44.200 --> 40:48.120]  When did that kind of phony accounting begin in the economy?
[40:48.120 --> 40:53.360]  Well you can go back to the first Clinton administration, that's when they started doing that and then
[40:53.360 --> 40:57.760]  he talks about the open borders and of course really folks it's not gun control, it's border
[40:57.760 --> 41:01.880]  control if you want to talk about things that are endangering us here.
[41:01.880 --> 41:06.040]  He says Hillary Clinton who already has the blood of so many on her hands is now announcing
[41:06.040 --> 41:10.320]  she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harm's way, an open door policy
[41:10.320 --> 41:15.560]  to criminals, to terrorists, to enter our country, Hillary is not concerned about you or I, because
[41:15.560 --> 41:20.360]  you know quite frankly all of these gun control measures they keep screaming background checks,
[41:20.360 --> 41:23.600]  background checks, watch lists, I want to watch these people, I want to know what they're
[41:23.600 --> 41:30.000]  doing, I want to know who they are, well they didn't do it for this Orlando shooter did
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.400]  they, okay?
[41:32.400 --> 41:36.000]  And they're not doing it for the people coming into this country, they have no idea who these
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.520]  people are so don't talk to us about having background checks once the people get into
[41:40.520 --> 41:43.320]  this country, it's a bit late at that point.
[41:43.320 --> 41:47.680]  Let's play a clip from Donald Trump's speech where he's talking about Hillary taking money
[41:47.680 --> 41:52.960]  from the Arab countries and her email scandal.
[41:52.960 --> 41:59.240]  Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was
[41:59.240 --> 42:06.600]  Secretary of State plus millions more for her foundation, the Sultan of Brunei has pushed
[42:06.600 --> 42:18.760]  oppressive Sharia law including the punishment by death and stoning if you happen to be gay.
[42:18.760 --> 42:24.840]  The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiary of Hillary's
[42:24.840 --> 42:30.840]  Trans-Pacific Partnership where she would absolutely approve if given the chance.
[42:30.840 --> 42:36.800]  Hillary Clinton's book and just think of this, the book talks about it but Hillary
[42:36.800 --> 42:48.680]  took $25 million from Saudi Arabia and much more from others where being gay is also punishable
[42:48.680 --> 42:51.120]  by death.
[42:51.120 --> 42:57.900]  Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly
[42:57.900 --> 43:03.840]  abuse women and the LGBT citizens.
[43:03.840 --> 43:10.280]  To cover up her corrupt dealings, Hillary illegally stashed her State Department emails
[43:10.280 --> 43:12.640]  on a private server.
[43:12.640 --> 43:17.080]  She's under investigation but it seems like nothing's going to happen even though other
[43:17.080 --> 43:24.920]  people who have done similar things but at a much lower level their lives have been destroyed.
[43:24.920 --> 43:28.640]  It's a rigged system folks, it's a rigged system.
[43:28.640 --> 43:37.160]  Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist
[43:37.160 --> 43:46.400]  China, sure they have it, putting all of America and our citizens in danger, great danger.
[43:46.400 --> 43:54.160]  When there are the 33,000 emails she deleted, well we may not know what's in those deleted
[43:54.160 --> 44:00.840]  emails, our enemies probably know every single one of them.
[44:00.840 --> 44:07.280]  So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be the President
[44:07.280 --> 44:09.200]  of the United States.
[44:09.200 --> 44:15.040]  This fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency.
[44:15.040 --> 44:21.760]  We can't hand over our government to someone whose deepest darkest secrets may be in the
[44:21.760 --> 44:26.240]  hands of our enemies, can't do it.
[44:26.240 --> 44:32.880]  Not only does it disqualify her but we need to understand that this government, this administration,
[44:32.880 --> 44:41.600]  the Obama administration has used the Espionage Act of 1917 more than against journalists
[44:41.600 --> 44:46.800]  and against whistleblowers more than all of the presidents combined in the previous hundred
[44:46.800 --> 44:47.800]  years.
[44:47.800 --> 44:52.800]  Think about that, think about that, think about how vigorous they have been to shut down all
[44:52.800 --> 44:59.160]  transparency in our government from whistleblowers, from journalists, calling them spies because
[44:59.160 --> 45:02.200]  they worship national security.
[45:02.200 --> 45:10.200]  And then look at the free pass that Hillary Clinton gets, can she preside in this ridiculous
[45:10.200 --> 45:15.760]  hypocrisy over this aggressive and over-the-top national security state?
[45:15.760 --> 45:18.280]  Of course she can't, of course she can't.
[45:18.280 --> 45:22.000]  And I would hope that Donald Trump would scale it back but I don't see any signs that he
[45:22.000 --> 45:23.000]  will.
[45:23.000 --> 45:24.560]  There are other reasons to vote for Donald Trump.
[45:24.560 --> 45:27.280]  I don't think he's going to pull back the national security state but when you look
[45:27.280 --> 45:32.760]  at what the Obama administration that she was a part of did to people like Thomas Drake
[45:32.760 --> 45:39.560]  and the whistleblowers, William Benny from the NSA who tried to warn us about the dragnet
[45:39.560 --> 45:44.680]  surveillance that now everybody understands and believes because of the Snowden leaks.
[45:44.680 --> 45:49.840]  When you look at how they came after Thomas Drake, and I've interviewed him, they came
[45:49.840 --> 45:56.080]  after him and went over him with a fine tooth comb to try to find something that they could
[45:56.080 --> 46:02.200]  come against him with very serious charges and what they found were some training manuals.
[46:02.200 --> 46:06.080]  Security is our friend and that type of thing and tried to send him to jail for that.
[46:06.080 --> 46:11.480]  And here we've got Hillary Clinton with some of the most beyond top secret documents you
[46:11.480 --> 46:12.480]  can have.
[46:12.480 --> 46:18.120]  Private discussions with foreign heads of state, completely in violation of the security
[46:18.120 --> 46:19.120]  agreements.
[46:19.120 --> 46:23.920]  What she understands as a secretary of state, she signed documents saying that she would
[46:23.920 --> 46:28.280]  abide by the laws and regulations of the national security state.
[46:28.280 --> 46:34.760]  And they prosecute people for whistleblowing and yet she walks free and clear.
[46:34.760 --> 46:42.280]  And then as Donald Trump pointed out, a friend to the most oppressive regimes in the world.
[46:42.280 --> 46:45.760]  Oppressive to the people that she appeals to to vote for her because of her identity.
[46:45.760 --> 46:50.240]  Just vote for me, LGBT people, cuz I'm one of you.
[46:50.240 --> 46:52.040]  Vote for me because I'm a woman.
[46:52.040 --> 46:53.480]  And yet look at Saudi Arabia.
[46:53.480 --> 46:57.840]  I read earlier that story from the Wall Street Journal talking about the Saudi Arabian women
[46:57.840 --> 47:04.440]  who long for the one night a week in the capital, Jeddah, where they can go to an amusement
[47:04.440 --> 47:09.080]  park and sit in bumper cars, not so they can play bumper cars, but so they can actually
[47:09.080 --> 47:11.560]  feel what it's like to drive a car.
[47:11.560 --> 47:18.960]  Now, they go on to say in a country where 23% of Saudi women only 23% have jobs, ladies
[47:18.960 --> 47:21.720]  only nights bring women out in force.
[47:21.720 --> 47:27.240]  Every employee there is in fact a woman because they have this rigid segregation of sexes.
[47:27.240 --> 47:30.760]  And it's only because they only have all the employees as women that they're allowed to
[47:30.760 --> 47:33.960]  take off the burkas and the beekeeper suits.
[47:33.960 --> 47:38.880]  Okay, everyone from popcorn sellers to the security guards to the bumper car attendant,
[47:38.880 --> 47:40.480]  the men have the night off.
[47:40.480 --> 47:45.480]  And while cinemas are normally banned in Saudi Arabia, there are two of them in this amusement
[47:45.480 --> 47:46.480]  park.
[47:46.480 --> 47:49.840]  Granted, the movies last under five minutes and the experience is really just about the
[47:49.840 --> 47:50.840]  special effects.
[47:50.840 --> 47:55.040]  It's got 3D screens, seats that jolt you around and spray water on you, okay?
[47:55.040 --> 48:01.920]  But for them, the biggest attraction is the fact that they can ride in these cars and
[48:01.920 --> 48:05.480]  that they don't have to be hassled by the men.
[48:05.480 --> 48:12.840]  The men who have been trained by this culture, by this religion to oppress and harass women.
[48:12.840 --> 48:16.800]  The men who send the money to Hillary Clinton.
[48:16.800 --> 48:22.360]  And then they go on to say, the way they end the story is they say many of the female bumper
[48:22.360 --> 48:26.720]  car drivers confide that they would really like to sit in the driver's seat outside of
[48:26.720 --> 48:28.520]  the park's walls.
[48:28.520 --> 48:31.200]  Some of them say that secretly they have.
[48:31.200 --> 48:35.320]  And then this woman who they talk to, and I hope the Saudi religious police don't read
[48:35.320 --> 48:38.840]  the Wall Street Journal because if they do, she and her husband are big trouble.
[48:38.840 --> 48:43.280]  She says, well, she says with pride, I've driven in the desert.
[48:43.280 --> 48:45.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[48:45.040 --> 48:48.400]  If you're in Saudi Arabia, you can drive in the desert, maybe.
[48:48.400 --> 48:51.960]  Okay, those are the people that we have been so closely lied to.
[48:51.960 --> 48:54.280]  And it's not just the Clintons, okay?
[48:54.280 --> 48:57.600]  It's the establishment, Republican and Democrat.
[48:57.600 --> 48:58.720]  Remember it was Henry Kissinger.
[48:58.720 --> 49:02.640]  All these people who are pushing these globalist trade deals on us, they are the ones who took
[49:02.640 --> 49:04.080]  us off the gold standard.
[49:04.080 --> 49:10.240]  Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, they created the alliance with the Saudis where they would
[49:10.240 --> 49:13.560]  back all oil would be sold in the dollar.
[49:13.560 --> 49:15.200]  They would create the petro dollar.
[49:15.200 --> 49:17.600]  They would buy our treasury bills.
[49:17.600 --> 49:23.760]  And then when we have a classified document, the government's own conspiracy theory, the
[49:23.760 --> 49:28.000]  official 9-11 report that has 28 pages where they talked about the Saudis.
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.000]  And somebody said, wait a minute.
[49:29.000 --> 49:36.200]  You can't say that about our guys because they're locked hip and thigh with the CIA.
[49:36.200 --> 49:37.960]  They redacted that.
[49:37.960 --> 49:40.880]  And if that were to come out, people would sue them.
[49:40.880 --> 49:45.240]  And they actually started running bills to the Senate to allow the Saudis to be sued.
[49:45.240 --> 49:47.920]  And the Saudis said, you know, you do that.
[49:47.920 --> 49:52.560]  We're going to dump $750 billion of your treasury bills, blackmailing us.
[49:52.560 --> 49:54.240]  Those are our closest allies.
[49:54.240 --> 49:58.400]  Those are the close supporters of Hillary Clinton, the people who brag that they gave
[49:58.400 --> 50:01.960]  her 20% of her financing.
[50:01.960 --> 50:05.480]  Those people who are so closely tied to the CIA.
[50:05.480 --> 50:09.880]  And of course, as Paul Craig Roberts pointed out, and we talk about the Brexit vote that
[50:09.880 --> 50:10.880]  is coming up tomorrow.
[50:10.880 --> 50:15.640]  As he pointed out, the European Union is a creation of the CIA.
[50:15.640 --> 50:18.600]  They wanted a single point of control.
[50:18.600 --> 50:23.320]  So they're intimately involved in the creation of the European Union.
[50:23.320 --> 50:28.800]  Obama and the establishment, both Republican and Democrat, do not want to see Britain leave
[50:28.800 --> 50:29.800]  the EU.
[50:29.800 --> 50:31.040]  They want Britain to be controlled.
[50:31.040 --> 50:32.840]  They want Britain to be subsumed.
[50:32.840 --> 50:36.960]  They do not want them to leave the European Union reservation.
[50:36.960 --> 50:38.800]  That vote is tomorrow.
[50:38.800 --> 50:39.800]  Coming up in the next hour.
[50:39.800 --> 50:44.040]  We're going to be talking to Lord Moncton, and he's going to explain to us, what is
[50:44.040 --> 50:45.640]  its state?
[50:45.640 --> 50:47.880]  Because this is something that affects us all.
[50:47.880 --> 50:53.000]  It's all, we're in a war right now about global consolidation that will wipe out the
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.440]  nation states of the West.
[50:55.440 --> 50:56.600]  Brexit is a part of it.
[50:56.600 --> 50:58.320]  Donald Trump is a part of it.
[50:58.320 --> 50:59.320]  You can be a part of it.

[52:59.720 --> 53:04.480]  Have you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but we're waiting for an outrageously
[53:04.480 --> 53:05.480]  low price?
[53:05.480 --> 53:07.960]  You are not going to want to miss this important message.
[53:07.960 --> 53:08.960]  Here's why.
[53:08.960 --> 53:12.840]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse.
[53:12.840 --> 53:17.440]  So please listen, solar generators really do provide life saving electrical power and
[53:17.440 --> 53:22.400]  unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce
[53:22.400 --> 53:23.920]  electricity from the sun.
[53:23.920 --> 53:28.720]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[53:28.720 --> 53:31.120]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[53:31.120 --> 53:33.760]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[53:33.760 --> 53:38.360]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators and they're
[53:38.360 --> 53:42.880]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low
[53:42.880 --> 53:44.960]  price for infill-wars listeners.
[53:44.960 --> 53:46.680]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[53:46.680 --> 53:50.120]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[53:50.120 --> 53:53.920]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[53:53.920 --> 53:59.960]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[53:59.960 --> 54:15.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[54:15.320 --> 54:20.760]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Wednesday, June 22, 2016, the day before Brexit.
[54:20.760 --> 54:23.400]  As I pointed out, we're going to be talking Lord Moncton about that and the next hour
[54:23.400 --> 54:24.400]  I've got a speech coming up.
[54:24.400 --> 54:28.920]  I want you to hear from Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London.
[54:28.920 --> 54:31.840]  And he lays out what is truly at stake here.
[54:31.840 --> 54:35.560]  We hear all this talk about all the different economic measures.
[54:35.560 --> 54:38.240]  Are they going to be better off economically?
[54:38.240 --> 54:44.080]  And certainly you can take a look and you can understand and you can get a dollar figure
[54:44.080 --> 54:48.520]  as to how much they are sending to the European Union as a net loss.
[54:48.520 --> 54:52.080]  And then they reply and say, yeah, but we're part of this great big trading block and we
[54:52.080 --> 54:55.400]  really don't know what's going to happen if the trade deals change.
[54:55.400 --> 55:00.720]  So they have specific metrics that show this massive bleeding of cash coming out and then
[55:00.720 --> 55:04.080]  the other side that says remain in it because we don't really know what will happen if we
[55:04.080 --> 55:05.080]  get out of it.
[55:05.080 --> 55:09.200]  That's what we're seeing played back and forth, but it is truly about sovereignty.
[55:09.200 --> 55:15.760]  And I want to play you this clip from Boris Johnson where he talks about this and he lays
[55:15.760 --> 55:16.760]  this out.
[55:16.760 --> 55:20.560]  They had a debate last night and they had people from both sides talking, this is his
[55:20.560 --> 55:21.560]  summary speech.
[55:21.560 --> 55:22.560]  It was a great speech.
[55:22.560 --> 55:27.680]  At the end of this campaign, I think you'll agree there is a very clear choice between
[55:27.680 --> 55:33.520]  those on their side who speak of nothing but fear of the consequences of leaving the EU
[55:33.520 --> 55:39.360]  and we on our side who offer hope between those who have been endlessly ravishing our
[55:39.360 --> 55:44.800]  country and running it down and those of us who believe in Britain.
[55:44.800 --> 55:47.800]  They say we can't do it.
[55:47.800 --> 55:49.120]  We say we can.
[55:49.120 --> 55:53.640]  They say we have no choice but to bow down to Brussels.
[55:53.640 --> 55:59.120]  We say they are woefully underestimating this country and what it can do.
[55:59.120 --> 56:05.640]  If we both leave, we can take back control of our borders of huge sums of money, £10
[56:05.640 --> 56:11.280]  billion a year net of our tax-raising powers, of our trade policy and of our whole law-making
[56:11.280 --> 56:18.760]  system, the democracy that is the foundation of our prosperity and if we stand up for democracy
[56:18.760 --> 56:25.200]  we will be speaking up for hundreds of millions of people around Europe who agree with us
[56:25.200 --> 56:27.600]  but who currently have no voice.
[56:27.600 --> 56:35.760]  And if we both leave and take back control, I believe that this Thursday can be our country's
[56:35.760 --> 56:36.760]  Independence Day.
[56:36.760 --> 56:37.760]  That's right.
[56:37.760 --> 56:41.600]  There's tomorrow going to be the Independence Day.
[56:41.600 --> 56:45.720]  Are they going to purge Britain of the parasites and the toxins?
[56:45.720 --> 56:49.280]  How's that for a transition to a deep-clean special?
[56:49.280 --> 56:54.040]  Seriously, we're going to talk about what's going on in Brexit, but we do have a new special.
[56:54.040 --> 56:57.760]  20% off deep-cleans at infowarslife.com.
[56:57.760 --> 57:01.480]  We all know that a clean, toxin-free body is the foundation of true health.
[57:01.480 --> 57:03.000]  That's why we've developed deep-cleans.
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.480]  It's an all-in-one, total-body cleanser that doesn't cut any corners.
[57:06.480 --> 57:11.320]  This natural formula incorporates the chemical and toxic metal cleansing ability of organic
[57:11.320 --> 57:14.200]  zeolites in combination with powerful cleansing herbs.
[57:14.200 --> 57:18.680]  You can read over 105 star reviews at infowarslife.com.

[57:32.800 --> 57:37.200]  New special, 20% off deep-cleans at infowarslife.com.
[57:37.200 --> 57:42.200]  Now as we're talking about the parasite, here's an article from infowars.com.
[57:42.200 --> 57:47.240]  Paul Joseph Watson, the EU even tries to control the volume at which we listen to music in
[57:47.240 --> 57:48.240]  Britain.
[57:48.240 --> 57:52.720]  He says, the joyless Brussels bureaucracy regulates every aspect of our lives.
[57:52.720 --> 57:58.160]  EU regulations are becoming so invasive that the unelected bureaucracy even tries to control
[57:58.160 --> 58:02.520]  the volume at which European citizens can listen to music on their iPhone.
[58:02.520 --> 58:06.800]  Now as we look at that, there was a story that was up on the Dredge Report yesterday
[58:06.800 --> 58:08.520]  from the Daily Mail.
[58:08.520 --> 58:10.600]  Don't call them robots.
[58:10.600 --> 58:13.480]  Most mechanical workers can become electronic persons.
[58:13.480 --> 58:15.720]  Who's going to do something that crazy?
[58:15.720 --> 58:16.720]  Why?
[58:16.720 --> 58:18.800]  Of course it would be the European Union.
[58:18.800 --> 58:23.440]  And they're even proposing that there's going to have to be a social security pension plan
[58:23.440 --> 58:26.320]  for the robots who take their jobs.
[58:26.320 --> 58:27.320]  How's that?
[58:27.320 --> 58:29.120]  That's the next level.
[58:29.120 --> 58:32.200]  After they bring in the migrants, they bring in the robots.
[58:32.200 --> 58:33.200]  Want to talk about a precariat?
[58:33.200 --> 58:37.560]  You want to talk about the precarious people with pitchforks and torches?
[58:37.560 --> 58:44.560]  Let's hope they turn out to vote tomorrow, we'll be right back.
[59:07.560 --> 59:08.560]  8.
[59:08.560 --> 59:15.100]  It is concentrated herbs and natural organic compounds known to energize the body's natural
[59:15.100 --> 59:20.720]  processes that are blocked by estrogen mimickers and other toxic elements in the food chain.
[59:20.720 --> 59:25.080]  Supermal vitality from infowarslife.com has sold out multiple times in the last three
[59:25.080 --> 59:26.080]  months.
[59:26.080 --> 59:30.160]  To fix that problem, we have now produced the biggest and most concentrated high quality
[59:30.160 --> 59:33.160]  batch of supermal vitality in the product's history.
[59:33.160 --> 59:36.040]  Our new ultra-strength formula is even stronger.
[59:36.040 --> 59:40.480]  Check out the third party reviews and informational videos at infowarslife.com.
[59:40.480 --> 59:43.280]  Now it's time to get your body in balance and fight back.
[59:43.280 --> 59:52.320]  I'm Alex Jones for Supermal Vitality and infowarslife.com and I salute you, our supporters.
[59:52.320 --> 01:00:18.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.560]  I'm David Knight.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:24.680]  In the next segment, we're going to be joined by Lord Moncton from the EU.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.680]  From the UK, actually, he's in the EU right now.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.920]  They want to get out of the EU and they want to become their own sovereign nation again.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.400]  He's going to talk about Brexit, which is the vote coming up tomorrow as to whether
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:39.560]  or not Britain will leave or whether they will remain in the European Union.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.240]  This is an issue that is of global importance.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:51.240]  What we are facing right now across the globe is a contest between global governance and
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.540]  individual liberty.
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:58.280]  As we remove government farther from us, we lose our freedoms more and more.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.280]  As power is consolidated, that's what our founders were concerned about.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:08.020]  That's why they created in the Constitution, they divided power between the states and
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:09.440]  between the central government.
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:14.080]  They were very concerned that the central government was going to become the overriding
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.680]  monster that we have today.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.280]  They knew that was going to happen eventually.
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.480]  They tried to put some checks and balances in there, but unfortunately, the Constitution
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.560]  is not a self-enforcing document.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.720]  And so they created a division of power between the states, between the people.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.080]  The Senate was supposed to represent the states, the people were represented by the House of
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:38.480]  Representatives and they were supposed to give some level of check to the central government.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.240]  Within the central government, they tried to divide into three branches as well to keep
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.400]  power from being consolidated.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.600]  And yet we've seen what has happened with that.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:48.760]  Now we've moved beyond that.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:54.260]  Now we have these central nation states and these wars happened in the 1860s, it happened
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.360]  in America.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:00.440]  We had a civil war, but also at the same time throughout Europe, there were wars of consolidation,
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.720]  wars that were being fought between industrial and agrarian interests.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.520]  You can look at the war that happened in Italy, for example.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:12.560]  There was a civil war in Italy, same agrarian versus industrial interests.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.880]  And it was a bloody civil war in Italy as well, look up Garibaldi's army.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.520]  So we had this consolidation that happened into the nation states.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:26.160]  Now the nation states are consolidating into global governance, but there is a pushback.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.200]  In America, we have the Donald Trump campaign.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:32.760]  In Europe, there are political parties that are forming to fight this.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.840]  And what we see happening is the potential that Europe and this concentration of power,
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.540]  as they're trying to consolidate to the next level with these global trade agreements,
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:44.640]  that it may begin to unravel at the bottom.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.320]  So they're fighting this with everything that they have.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.400]  Now before we go to Lord Mokten, I want to play the beginning of this movie that you
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.400]  can watch online.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.160]  It's called Brexit the Movie.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.440]  And I want to play the trailer for their movie because it lays this down for you as to what's
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.440]  at stake.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.160]  If you're not following this, if you're in Britain and you're not following it, shame
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.160]  on you.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.480]  But if you're in America and you haven't really followed this, this will give you an idea
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.480]  for this.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:11.080]  Let's go to the trailer for Brexit the Movie.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:16.200]  We either people are being cajoled, frightened and bullied into surrendering our democracy
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.120]  and freedom.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.760]  This film is a rallying cry.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:24.880]  We must fight for our independence, for the right to determine ourselves, the laws under
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:28.960]  which we live, and for the freedom to shape our own future.
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.960]  This is the most important voting decision that any of us is going to make in our lifetime.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:37.240]  With general elections, it doesn't really matter who you vote for, conservative or Labour,
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.680]  because you know that in four years' time, you can change your mind.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.760]  This time you can't change your mind.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.680]  This time is for keeps.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.720]  In this film, we'll see how the EU works.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:55.040]  It's like heaven for the political bureaucrat because it's power without accountability.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:02.520]  It was devised to make sure that the great mass of the people could not control government
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.520]  ever again.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:10.080]  The EU is turning into a dictatorship and this is not overstating it.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.440]  We will see what the EU has done to Britain.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:18.120]  The EU is disabliterated, the English fishing industry all together.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.240]  The European policies that we face are really the single biggest threat to our competitiveness.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:28.160]  We'll see why fortress Europe has been such a calamity for the European economy.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.680]  What we see is the EU bringing up the drawbridge.
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.880]  The European Union has become an economic basket case.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:38.840]  Certainly it is not in our economic interest to remain within the European Union.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.840]  No way.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:45.360]  We will look at the risks of tying our fate to the failing EU.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.520]  Extremism at both ends is being fostered by the anti-democratic nature of the European
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.520]  Union.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.520]  It's becoming safer for us to be in the EU.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.520]  There are dangers.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:58.240]  All right, so you can see the rest of that and you can watch that movie online to define
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.240]  what that is.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:00.240]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.240]  We're going to be right back with Lord Moncton from the UK.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:05.400]  Federal investigators are trying to find out more specifically what Omar Mateen's wife
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.800]  knew about the planned attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:11.960]  There's just one problem, nor Saman is missing.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:16.080]  The Sun Sentinel conducted an interview with Sadiq Mateen, the shooter's father, in which
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.880]  he has heard saying that Saman was not around here.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.360]  I don't know where she is, but she's not here.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.600]  Most disturbing of all, according to Breaking 9-1-1, citing CNN, US Attorney General Loretta
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.400]  Lynch says that she doesn't know if Saman has left the state or not.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:35.960]  How it's possible that nor Saman has given federal authorities the slip is beyond comprehension.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.440]  So let me get this straight.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:42.840]  Federal authorities are continually bypassing the Constitution in violation of our rights
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:48.440]  so that in the name of terrorism, they can conduct unconstitutional and completely useless
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.440]  spying.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.280]  But perhaps the department just needs more funding.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.920]  That always seems to do the trick.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:06:23.880]  We'll see you in the next one.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:52.720]  We'll see you in the next one.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:07:19.400]  We'll see you in the next one.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:48.960]  We'll see you in the next one.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:08:18.880]  We'll see you in the next one.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.040]  I'm David Knight.
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.440]  And joining us now is Lord Christopher Moncton from the UK.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:28.360]  We're going to talk about Brexit, which comes up for a vote tomorrow.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:29.760]  You heard the clip in the last hour.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:36.000]  We had Boris Johnson close the debates last night, made a rousing speech saying, all you
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.320]  hear from the other side is fear.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:42.800]  We offer you the opportunity to take control of your lives.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.680]  He said tomorrow can be our independence day.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.320]  So we're going to talk to Lord Moncton about that.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:51.040]  We have an introduction, of course, if you're a listener at infowars.com, you've heard him
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.320]  on many times.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.240]  We have Lord Moncton on to talk.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.640]  He is an expert on global warming.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.640]  He's been very effective at fighting the lies of Al Gore and others.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:08.360]  The censorship that we see surrounding manmade global warming narratives.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.360]  He's done that in the UK.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.800]  Of course, he's also a businessman.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.800]  He's a newspaper editor.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:16.560]  He's an inventor, a classical architect, and of course, the high priest of climate
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.560]  skepticism.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.960]  But today, we're going to talk to him about what's going on with globalism.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:26.840]  Also, if you want to find Lord Moncton, you can find him at scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.400]  We find many of his papers published.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:35.080]  And what's up with that.com, where you'll find information where he exposes the lies
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.560]  of climate alarmism.
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.680]  But today, we're going to talk about Brexit.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.800]  We're going to talk about the economic issues.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.520]  We're going to talk about the sovereignty issues.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.680]  We're going to talk about the political consequences, both in Britain and in the United States.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:52.600]  Because this is a worldwide issue that is happening right now.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.080]  Joining us now is Lord Christopher Moncton.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.600]  Thank you for joining us, Lord Moncton.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.560]  Well, David, it's a pleasure to be with you.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.840]  And my goodness, it's exciting here because I can't tell you who is going to win this
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.000]  vote tomorrow.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.440]  I hope it's going to be the Brexiteers.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.920]  I've already cast my vote by post, but it's too close to call.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:16.560]  It could go either way.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.200]  But you're quite right in your introduction and in that wonderful film and all of the
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:24.880]  people who you showed clips of are friends of mine.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.960]  This is an enormous blow.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:34.280]  The fact that we've even got this referendum is an enormous blow against global government
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.280]  power.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:41.560]  They didn't ever want us to have this vote, and at least we've got the chance to have
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:42.560]  our say.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:48.840]  And it's very evenly divided between, roughly speaking, the left and the centre-right, between
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:56.720]  the establishment and the ordinary folk, between the givers and the goblers to use the eight
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.560]  rands metric.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:05.240]  And what is fascinating is that practically the entire global establishment, so terrifying
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:12.720]  divide, are they at the idea of Britain leaving the EU, that we've had Mr Obama speaking out,
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.760]  we've had Angela Merkel, the president of Germany speaking out, we've had, or the Chancellor
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:22.760]  as she's called, we've had Francois Hollande speaking out, we've had the head of the World
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:27.600]  Bank speaking out, we've had all manner with the head of the Bank of England, who is not
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.720]  allowed to speak out of political matters.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:35.800]  He has spoken out, and all of these are, of course, wanting us to stay in, because they
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:40.520]  want to tie us in to this increasingly globalised government system.
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:45.440]  Yes, and further away, further away, we have no control over what's going on in your lives.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:50.040]  And I think that's the key phrase there, that rousing speech that was given by Boris Johnson,
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.440]  where he says, tomorrow can be our independence day.
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:59.520]  I mean, do Britons really want to govern themselves, or do they want to be governed by some
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.480]  European super-state that is dominated by the Germans?
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.920]  I really don't understand that.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:07.880]  I mean, there was a back and forth talking about Neville Chamberlain, and they made
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:11.880]  a good point on that the other day when they questioned Cameron on that.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:16.280]  I want to play that clip and get your reactions to it, but I see that as another issue of
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:19.600]  appeasement and surrender.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:25.400]  That is a very fair comparison, and of course, the entire establishment throughout Europe
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:31.560]  was for appeasement in the era immediately before the Second World War, and I'll bet
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:36.320]  you'll never guess which the first state to speak out against Hitler openly and publicly
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:37.320]  was.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.320]  What was that?
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.320]  It was actually the Holy See.
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.840]  It was Pope Pius XII, as he was to become.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:49.880]  He was then secretary to Pope Pius XI, who issued in German, and in cyclical letter,
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.440]  the first time it hadn't been in Latin since the early Middle Ages, and it was called
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.240]  mit Brennen der Sorge, with profound concern.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:02.360]  The Holy See spoke out against the Hitler regime while everybody else, the times of
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.040]  London, was for appeasement.
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:11.440]  I mean, indeed, the Daily Express in 1933 had disgraced itself by running a front-page
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:17.240]  story shortly after Hitler came to power saying Germany is Britain's friend, and the author
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.600]  of its lead story was not one of its journalists.
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.360]  It was Joseph Goebbels.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:27.880]  That was how much the establishment wanted the German Reich to survive and prosper, and
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:34.840]  now they want the new bureaucratic, the tyranny by Clark, which again is anti, not just undemocratic,
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:40.160]  it's anti-democratic, and again the establishment, which now hates democracy, viscerally hates
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:49.320]  democracy, wants to use the EU as a model for spreading effectively dictatorship worldwide,
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:54.800]  and you're quite right, David, when you say that democracy and independence are the issue.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:58.200]  Are we going to be, once again, a sovereign nation?
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:01.120]  Are we going to get our independence back?
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:05.560]  And when you think that Britain was a great, proud and independent nation, the last time
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:13.080]  anyone invaded us was in 1066 AD, and now here we have the European Union invading us
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.080]  by stealth.
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:20.120]  And, of course, about half the population will tend to side with the establishment.
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.840]  The goblers, the people who are on the take, they love the EU because it's a paradise of
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:25.840]  vested interests.
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:33.840]  There are 20,000 lobbyists who infest Brussels and Strasbourg, and their job is to argue
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:40.680]  for various vested interests to get free handouts from the European Union, of course, at British
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.840]  and other taxpayers' expense.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.880]  And how much say do we get in any of this?
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.920]  It gets back to your point, David, about democracy and independence.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:54.320]  At the moment, according to the House of Commons Library, which has just done a survey, three
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:00.840]  laws in five that are made for us by our parliament and the United Kingdom are, in fact, only
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:05.640]  made because Brussels says we must make those laws.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:10.920]  These laws are being enacted because the European Union's commissars, 28 unelected people who
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:16.360]  meet behind closed doors, have issued what is revealingly called a directive, which we
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:23.160]  are then obliged, under pain of unlimited and continuing fines, to enact into law in
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.160]  the United Kingdom.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:29.440]  Now, the German government did a survey five years ago, and its conclusion, which was put
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:33.040]  in front of its constitutional court at the time, which had insisted that this sum be
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:37.600]  done, they said that, in fact, five-sixth of all laws, five laws in six, not even two
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:45.520]  and three, but five and six, were, in fact, enacted solely because directives by the unelected,
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:52.080]  unremovable, unaccountable, unquestionable commissars had ordered these laws to be made.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.760]  That is how far from democracy we are.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.080]  Now, you may say, oh, but I've heard of a thing called the European Parliament.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:00.280]  Well, don't imagine that that is anything like a parliament.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:05.240]  It is a fig leaf to cover the naked dictatorship behind.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:08.120]  And this parliament cannot even bring forward a bill.
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:12.520]  Can you imagine if the United States had set up a constitution whereby the Congress was
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:17.200]  not allowed in either house ever to bring forward any new legislation?
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:19.160]  We're getting close to that.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.960]  Isn't it like, yes, the European Parliament, of course, you are under Obama getting used
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:27.520]  to that, but that's not how it was supposed to work under the constitution.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:33.360]  And yet the constitution of Europe is that the supreme law of Europe is proposed behind
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:39.880]  closed doors by the 28 commissars, is drafted behind closed doors by a committee called
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.240]  the Council of Ministers, which doesn't actually have any ministers on it.
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.240]  It's entirely bureaucrats.
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.040]  There's also a rather shadowy group called the Council of Permanent Representatives,
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:52.160]  another lot of bureaucrats that have their say, then and only then it goes to the European
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.160]  Parliament.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:57.080]  And of course, if right at the outset, the commissars have decided to veto whatever
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:00.720]  law it was, then the European Parliament doesn't get its say at all.
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:03.720]  So this shows how undemocratic it is.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.920]  And if the European Parliament should agree to the law proposed by the commissars, well,
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.800]  then it gets inflicted on us.
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:15.160]  But if they disagree, it gets inflicted on us anyway, because the commissars have and
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:20.320]  frequently exercise the right under the Treaty of Maastricht in five different places.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:27.920]  It says this, to override, the unelected commissars can override the decisions of the elected
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.640]  Parliament of Europe.
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:32.880]  So this is an entirely anti-democratic constitution.
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:37.400]  In fact, it's very like the Soviet Constitution on which it was modelled.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:40.640]  And all that's happening is the Soviet Constitution has moved westward.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.480]  And we are now effectively the European Supreme Soviet.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:51.160]  And I would add, Lord Moncton, that what we are now looking at with the Trans-Pacific
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:55.840]  and the Trans-Atlantic Partnership, Senator Sessions, who's one of the only senator that
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.880]  I know that actually looked at the agreement, has essentially said, we're going to have
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:04.720]  the same thing with these trade agreements, where we're going to have an unelected, unaccountable
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.960]  bureaucracy that is going to be able to alter these things at will.
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:11.760]  There will be a living document, and we will have absolutely no control over them.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.720]  So what you just described there in the European Union, where they can override all these deals,
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.280]  and of course, it's always about the money.
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:24.360]  They sell this as an economic opportunity, as an economic union, but then they use it
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.720]  to take our sovereignty.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.200]  Boris Johnson has said, and he's been one of the key voices on this, he says, we remain
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:35.080]  prisoners of a trade regime that will not allow this country the fifth biggest economy
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:38.360]  on earth to negotiate with America, China, India, or any other nation.
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:43.120]  He says that privilege is reserved exclusively for the hierarchies of the European Commission
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:47.120]  of whose vast staff only 3.6% are British.
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:54.000]  Now, if they get this Trans-Pacific-Trans-Atlantic Partnership, that will go from 3.6% to 0%
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  for you.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.480]  This is 0% for America.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:00.320]  We will have no say over the trade issues for our countries.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.320]  That's right.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:05.800]  Now, we now have to do something about this, of course, in Britain.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:09.880]  If anybody is listening to this from Britain, for heaven's sake, if you still believe in
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.760]  democracy and a surprising number, don't.
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:15.680]  But if you do, then for heaven's sake, you have to vote leave.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.040]  It is as simple as that.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:22.280]  Don't be fooled by all the economic arguments that the Treasury has simply made up numbers
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:25.080]  to try and say we would go bankrupt if you were out of the EU.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.160]  We'll go bankrupt for sure if we're in it.
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:33.200]  Let me give you one figure that tells you just how badly Britain has done in the EU.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.760]  Hang on with that figure, Lord Moncton.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:37.320]  We've got to go to a commercial break and we'll be right back.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.800]  And we also have a clip.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.160]  We'll talk about the other issue that came up in this.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.720]  And of course, that is immigration.
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:48.920]  That has economic consequences, but it has vast consequences for the entire society.
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:51.160]  We'll talk about that when we come back with Lord Moncton.
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.360]  Brexit is tomorrow.
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:57.880]  Will it be Britain's Independence Day or the day they quietly cease to exist?
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:58.880]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:05.760]  Hi, I'm 54 years of age and at Christmas time last year, a resident I take care of at work
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:09.280]  accidentally rolled over my right foot with his motorized scooter.
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.680]  I was back into a corner and he put it in reverse and did it again.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:16.640]  The bones in my foot weren't actually broken, but damage was done.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:20.560]  The remedy was to just let the foot heal on its own and this was expected to take many
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.560]  weeks.
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:25.440]  As a caregiver, I do a lot of walking and I was sort of okay when I was in motion.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:28.640]  It's when I stopped to rest that I really felt the pain.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:31.040]  The pain was there getting out of bed in the morning too.
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:35.520]  So I got on the One World Way and moved back and I just had to write the text money.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.520]  No more pain.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.520]  Nothing.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:41.480]  I can only attribute this to the One World Way since I haven't introduced anything else
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:45.880]  into my life, which probably to the true God sense, it gives me energy and did whatever
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.680]  magic this stuff does to heal my poor foot.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:51.840]  I will pay One World Way for life, Mr. Lee Holly.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:56.680]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.

[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:05.680]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say, take the 12-act two SuperMail Brain Force Prostigar
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.680]  Silver Bullet.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.680]  I use them all.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:08.680]  They're phenomenal.
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:09.680]  They work.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:10.680]  Fine, folks.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:11.680]  Thank you, brother.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:12.680]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:17.960]  I am a relatively short time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:18.960]  products.

[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.320]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.320]  Have they worked for you?
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:35.920]  They're one of the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:36.920]  What products are you taking?
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:37.920]  Are you taking...
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:45.200]  Everything from SuperMail to Brain Force to Wintersun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:50.160]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill, visit infowarslife.com

[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:13.720]  I've been taking these every day for over a decade now, and I try to encourage every
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:17.040]  one of my clients to take them every day, and there's a number of reasons.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.200]  First of all, it's the best vitamins you can get.
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:22.840]  It's got dozens of vitamins, antioxidants, nutrients in it, and then the most important
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:27.560]  reason why I do it as a psychiatrist and recommend it to my patients is because it's got brain
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:28.560]  food in it.
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:33.000]  It's got the essential amino acid, it's got trypsin, philolamine, tyrosine, and choline,
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.240]  vitamin B6, and these chemicals that are all natural from food turn into the brain
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.840]  chemicals that make you happy.

[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:14.720]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:15.720]  I'm David Nye, your host.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:19.240]  We're going to go back to Lord Moncton.
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:20.640]  We had to go to a commercial break.
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:24.000]  He had one key factor that he wanted to tell us about with the breaks, and of course that's
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  coming up tomorrow.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.360]  The vote is whether or not Britain will leave the European Union.
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.360]  Before we get back to Lord Moncton, I just want to let you know we do have a special,
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.840]  a new special at infowars.com.

[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.280]  Let's go back to Lord Martin as we're going to the break you were about to make a point.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:27.280]  Go ahead.
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:32.200]  Yes, it's a very simple figure about the economics of all this, which needs to be looked at very
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.200]  briefly.
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:40.920]  And that is that in the last two decades, the stock market in London has had its worst
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:47.000]  two decades in 650 years of operation.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.920]  That's how well the EU has done for us.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:55.960]  The EU has generally underperformed in the last 20 or 30 years just about all the other
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.760]  developed economies.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:03.200]  And it is dragging all of us down with exactly this kind of bureaucratic mishmash of controls
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:09.080]  and regulations run by people we can't elect and can't remove that you talk of in the transatlantic
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:12.000]  trade partnership system.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.600]  And what is happening here is that people like Mr. Obama, who have realized that communism
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:23.600]  is no longer popular, but who want to build in perma-communism into whatever they do,
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.680]  have discovered that if they make international treaties, either bilateral or multilateral,
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.680]  it doesn't very much matter.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:35.240]  Under your constitution, those treaties have the force of supreme law in the United States
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:39.160]  and they can't be repealed unilaterally as your own laws can.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.120]  That's the different difference.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:47.040]  And what is more, all the powers that are transferred, whether it be to the transatlantic
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:51.440]  trade partnership, whether it be to the European Stability Pact, the European Union, the World
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:56.680]  Bank, the World Law of the Sea Conference, it doesn't matter which of these entities
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:02.840]  it is, the UN is another one, there are a growing number of them, all of them very expensive.
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:11.240]  Not one of these supranational or global bodies has its governing council elected by us, the
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:15.520]  people of the state's parties, for the treaties that set those bodies up.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:23.840]  So every time you transfer power from elected hands in the democracies to a global or supranational
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:29.320]  organization, you're transferring it from elected to unelected hands every time.
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:34.200]  So every time somebody says, oh, we've got a new wonderful treaty, you will know with
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:40.160]  a terrible certainty that another large piece of your democracy has been sliced away like
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:42.520]  a piece of salami.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:48.080]  And the intention of the left now is to govern entirely by dictatorship.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:53.280]  And so far has it gone, but to give you an example which is being mirrored in the transatlantic
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:58.120]  trade partnership, which is why I mention it to you in America too, is that the European
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:03.640]  Stability Pact, to which Britain doesn't belong because we're not part of the failing
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:10.040]  euro currency zone, but the regulations that the treaty that sets up that pact creates
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:18.280]  a governing council which can at will, whenever it likes, call upon any of the member states
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:25.480]  of that group, the European Stability Pact, for unlimited amounts of money.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:29.960]  And what is more, the people who are on this governing council, who are of course elected
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:35.840]  by nobody, they're so unaccountable that even if they decided to take the money and
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.320]  run off with it and put it into their bank accounts in the Cayman Islands or Switzerland
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:45.800]  or Belgium, which is now becoming one of the biggest money laundering centres in the world.
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:52.000]  Then the Stability Pact terms say that those people cannot be prosecuted and they cannot
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.760]  be sued in any civil court either.
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:56.880]  They are completely immune.
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:04.160]  They have absolute financial power over all the countries that belong to that treaty.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:10.840]  And even if they choose to exercise that power criminally, nobody can do anything to stop
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:11.840]  them.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:16.320]  That of course is dictated in the formal sense.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:21.880]  Well, of course, even though you're not a part of the euro, the mismanagement of the
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:28.040]  euro is driving immigration from the European Union into Britain as the questions were being
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:30.160]  presented to David Cameron the other night.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:34.240]  People were saying, why is it that unskilled workers that are being put out of work by
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:38.680]  mismanagement in these other states are given preference over skilled immigrants coming
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:39.680]  into our country?
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:43.080]  When we come back, we're going to take a look at what happened in that question and answer
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:47.160]  period with David Cameron.
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:50.840]  And we have Lord Moncton talking about the Brexit vote coming up tomorrow.
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:30:08.840]  The
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:23.720]  ruling out all the stops in a final desperate push to frighten British voters away from
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:42.000]  the EU.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.120]  Immediately as if on cue, the pro-globalist press exploited the tragedy to condemn the
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:48.320]  lead campaign.
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:52.600]  Will Britain's reclaim their sovereignty and being in control of their own destiny find
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.800]  out Thursday on the June 23rd Brexit referendum?
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:31:25.760]  Lee and McAdoo reporting for infowars.com.
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:54.680]  Don't drug this bottle, please.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:59.680]  www.ColorsStore.com. Recall, 888-253-3139.
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:02.040]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.240]  Try a bottle of it.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.840]  Rob Doe, joins us.
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:08.000]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.040]  Tell us what brainforce did.
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:10.040]  I've been working all day.
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.480]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:14.480]  I get in here at 8.30.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:15.880]  I was kinda run down.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.760]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:20.080]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:21.520]  I got my bottle of brainforce right there.
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:22.440]  I popped two of them.
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.920]  And about 20 minutes later,
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.840]  it's like, everything just kinda clears up.
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:28.240]  It's got four and a half stars.
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.480]  People really love it.
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:30.320]  Read about it.
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.800]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.000]  give it such high praise,
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.520]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:39.480]  that will blow your socks off.
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:41.000]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.520]  but I probably could not have done it without brainforce.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:45.920]  I went home about 6.45 this morning,
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.160]  took three hours of sleep,
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.680]  got up, took two more brainforce, and came in.
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:53.240]  You will find brainforce and other game-changing products
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:55.080]  at infowarslife.com,
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:58.560]  or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:12.720]  He aligns himself with the truth,
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:15.720]  and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:18.480]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:21.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.200]  I'm David Knight, and we're talking to Lord Moncton
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.720]  of course, the vote as to whether or not
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.720]  Britain is going to remain or leave.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.360]  The European Union is tomorrow.
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.080]  Will it be Britain's Independence Day,
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:33.400]  as Boris Johnson said in his closing remarks,
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:36.840]  or will they lose the opportunity?
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:37.680]  We'll see what happens.
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:38.520]  It is neck and neck.
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:41.200]  And of course, they were up by 19 points
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:45.720]  before the Member of Parliament was killed last week,
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:48.200]  one week before the election.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:51.480]  And now we've seen a 26-point swing
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:53.160]  in some of the polls.
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.840]  Right now, they have recovered,
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.840]  and it looks like it is neck and neck.
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:58.240]  Nobody is predicting that.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.120]  I see that as a very bad sign,
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.920]  because we always know that the vested interests
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:05.440]  are going to be able to swing the votes.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:08.200]  I know that's the case in America.
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:10.560]  We'll ask Lord Moncton what he thinks about that
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:11.920]  in the UK as well.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:13.280]  But before we get back to Lord Moncton,
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:15.040]  I want to point out we've extended
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.920]  the Tim Kennedy Special for one more day.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:21.240]  That's our 15% off of supermail vitality,
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:25.000]  Brainforce and Secret 12, at infowarslife.com.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.960]  These are the products that Tim Kennedy,
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:28.920]  as you've seen him talk to Alex Jones.
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:31.880]  And of course, he is not only a special forces,
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:35.640]  but he also is a UFC fighter.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:39.080]  And he trains intensively for both of those things.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:41.120]  And he says what helps him the most
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:43.200]  that he has felt the biggest improvement in
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.320]  are these three products, supermail vitality,
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.280]  Brainforce and Secret 12.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:49.400]  And so we've put those together,
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:52.240]  call it the Tim Kennedy Special, 15% off.
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:53.560]  It's been such a big seller.
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:56.880]  Alex has extended that one more day at infowarslife.com.
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:00.880]  15% off, supermail vitality, Brainforce and Secret 12.
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.400]  That's the Tim Kennedy Special.
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:05.920]  Lord Moncton, I want to play this clip
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:09.720]  from the question and answer period a couple of days ago
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:11.480]  with David Cameron.
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:15.920]  And it touches on a huge part of this issue.
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.760]  And of course, that's immigration.
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:20.280]  That is an economic issue, as well as a cultural issue,
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:21.520]  as well as a crime issue.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:23.800]  We see what's happening throughout Europe.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:25.000]  This is what the people said.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.360]  Of course, this is a television program.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.200]  They had an audience.
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.800]  They said it was evenly divided between people
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:31.560]  who were foreign against remaining in the European Union
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.920]  and some people who were undecided, they said.
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:36.960]  And they let the audience ask questions
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.240]  to David Cameron, the prime minister.
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.240]  And here's a couple of those questions real quickly.
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.720]  I want to get your response after we play this.
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:48.200]  Mr Cameron, you keep saying that you propose to stop immigrants
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:50.920]  allowing to claim benefits.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:53.040]  Is this just a proposal?
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:54.840]  Or can you enforce it?
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:59.200]  Or have you got to go back to the EU to get it enforced?
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:05.080]  It's agreed by the 27 other prime ministers and presidents.
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:08.200]  It's part of what will become a legally binding document.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.640]  And these changes are coming in.
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:12.280]  The head of the European Parliament has said that, too.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:13.920]  So these are things, they come in.
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:18.960]  If we vote yes to remain in the Reform European Union on Thursday,
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:21.760]  those proposals get put in front of the European Parliament
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.920]  and start to be passed straight away.
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:26.080]  What happens if somebody vetoes you?
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.480]  Well, they've all agreed they won't.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:29.520]  This is a, they've all agreed.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:31.360]  How can we believe that?
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:35.000]  You say that your policy that you've negotiated with Europe
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.920]  cannot be overruled.
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:37.800]  It can.
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:40.280]  So are you really the 21st century,
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:43.680]  in a never-chambering way, with a piece of paper in the air
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:47.000]  staying to the public?
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.080]  This is what I have.
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:51.760]  I have this promise where a dictatorship in Europe
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:54.240]  can overruling.
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:55.600]  That's a good question.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:57.880]  Yes or no, please.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:02.160]  Why does it is the other 27 prime ministers and presidents
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.360]  have agreed it?
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:06.840]  And they know if Britain votes to remain, they will implement it.
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:09.840]  And I think, you know, this is not some empire
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:10.840]  and dictatorship.
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:11.840]  This is a proof.
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:12.840]  Hang on.
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:13.840]  Hang on, sir.
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:14.840]  This is a proof.
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:15.840]  There you go.
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:16.840]  Prove it.
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:17.840]  Prove it.
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:18.840]  He says you're just a never-chambering, waving a piece of paper
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:21.040]  that has absolutely no effect.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:23.120]  You've got some promises from these people.
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:24.640]  They can renege on these promises.
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:27.880]  He says, well, they told me if we stay in, they're going to do
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:29.960]  something to improve this immigration thing.
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:30.960]  They're not buying it.
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.920]  Lord Marked in your comments.
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:36.680]  Imagine if you in the United States were told that you had to
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:41.560]  depend on the will of 27 other nations, any one of whom could
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.040]  say no to you.
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:47.840]  Now, the history of Britain's appeals, for instance, to the so-called
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:51.200]  European, so-called court of so-called justice, which is the
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:58.640]  European Union's rubber stamp court, is that in 80% of all cases
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:03.000]  brought by Britain to try to get its way in the European Union,
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  under David Cameron, it has lost those cases.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.880]  The average has been 75%.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.360]  And it's now gone up to 80% that we lose.
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:12.760]  We have absolutely no influence whatsoever.
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:20.000]  And in all 72 instances of where the British Parliament has
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.480]  tried to say no under David Cameron to European laws, in
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:26.360]  every single one of those cases, the European law has been
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:28.000]  enacted anyway.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.400]  We have absolutely no say in Europe.
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:34.840]  And David Cameron is pretending that somehow we are all
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:36.800]  in the club together and we can do what we want.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:40.040]  The fact is the only way we can control immigration, and you're
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:43.280]  quite right, that after democracy, immigration is the next
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:44.960]  biggest issue.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:48.360]  The only way we can control immigration is to come out of
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:51.560]  the EU, and I'll give you the figures to show you why it is.
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:55.720]  We are getting something like a million people a year in net
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:58.680]  terms coming into the UK and staying there.
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:38:59.920]  How do we know?
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.880]  Because although the official immigration figures say it's
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:07.440]  about 300,000 or 400,000, the true figures are given by what
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:10.320]  are called the national insurance numbers issued.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:13.400]  And something like 600,000 of those every year are being
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:17.960]  issued to EU nationals coming to Britain, and another 400,000
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:22.400]  being issued to foreigners who are beyond the EU.
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:25.840]  So we know that immigration is at two or three times the rate
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:28.160]  the official figures show, because national insurance
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:29.680]  numbers, you can't work without one.
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:31.200]  You can't claim benefit without one.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.640]  The two things that people want to do when they come to
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:36.200]  Britain is either to work or to claim benefit.
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:40.280]  So we know from that that immigration is on a far larger
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:42.760]  scale than this government wants to admit.
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:46.960]  We know that the vast majority of that immigration is coming
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:51.480]  just from the 27 other nations of the EU rather than from the
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:54.200]  200 other nations worldwide.
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:57.200]  And so we know that if we want to control immigration,
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:00.200]  staying in the EU is simply not an option.
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:03.600]  Those are the hard figures, the figures that don't really get
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:04.520]  into the paper as much.
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:07.360]  The Daily Telegraph revealed this morning, or yesterday
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:12.200]  morning, this scam by which the government is undercounting
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.880]  immigration by a very, very large scale.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:17.480]  And the national insurance numbers which allow you to
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:21.520]  work or to claim benefit are the much more revealing figure.
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:26.600]  The revenue people, the IRS in the UK actually keep
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:30.480]  statistics on who these numbers are being allocated to
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.160]  every year.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:34.000]  So we know that immigration is happening at a far larger
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:34.920]  scale than it should.
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.720]  And we know that the only way to control that is to come out.
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:41.160]  Now, let's look at Cameron's saying that he's got the
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:45.040]  agreement of the other 27 member states.
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:49.880]  Fact is that all that has to happen now is a coalition
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:53.600]  against us in the European Parliament because everybody
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:56.960]  except the Britain wants immigration to continue to
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:59.360]  be free and easy because they can just export the immigrant
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.600]  straight to Britain where they all seem to end up.
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:04.440]  Because we have a more generous benefit system, one with far
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:06.800]  fewer checks on it, and also everybody speaks English, which
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.960]  they don't in most other European countries.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:11.360]  So everybody who is an immigrant wants to come to Britain
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:14.160]  because it's a civilized and friendly place as well.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:18.000]  So they may well in the European Parliament say, well,
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  we're going to vote this down.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.600]  Now, of course, the commissars could simply say they were
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.720]  going to push it through anyway.
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:27.720]  But they don't like Britain, so they probably wouldn't.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:30.920]  And what David Cameron is admitting to here is in effect,
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:34.520]  is that he has lost control of immigration completely.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:38.680]  And he has no control whatsoever about what the European
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:41.320]  Union will do to us if we remain.
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:46.040]  The only way we will get control over our immigration is if
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:50.280]  we come out of the European Union and then we can tell
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:53.200]  people from the European Union how many of them can come in.
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.360]  We'll obviously want skilled workers to come in.
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:59.040]  We'll want people who are being treated badly by the EU or by
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:03.200]  any member state to come in via the asylum rules, just as we
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.960]  always have done internationally.
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:07.080]  If you're in hardship and you have nowhere else to turn,
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.800]  Britain will always welcome you.
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:11.560]  What we're not going to have is this tide of economic
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:12.040]  migrants.
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:14.760]  I mean, there'd be another 72 million of them if Turkey
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:16.200]  joins the EU.
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:18.600]  And although Mr Cameron pretends he doesn't want Turkey to
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:21.080]  join the EU, privately and behind the scenes, he's been
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:24.360]  working overtime to try and get Turkey in.
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:28.000]  He is trying quite deliberately to destroy Britain as an
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.120]  independent country so as to establish this world elite
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:33.280]  dictatorship.
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:37.800]  If anybody is listening thinks this sounds extreme, that is
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.240]  because his ambition is extreme.
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:44.360]  The ambition of these people is to do away with democracy
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:49.760]  altogether and the single biggest threat to their plan is
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:51.480]  this vote tomorrow.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:54.360]  So if you are listening in the United Kingdom or you have
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.640]  friends in the United Kingdom who are dithering about how to
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:01.600]  vote, tell them that this is their one chance to do not
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:05.600]  only Britain, but also Europe and the world of favour by
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:09.680]  striking a blow and a very strong blow for democracy.
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:12.640]  And I suppose we might use the words of a well-known film and
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:17.280]  we might say, we will not go quietly into the night.
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:20.720]  We will not go without a fight.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:23.680]  And this will be our independence day.
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.720]  Yes, yes, I hope that will be the case.
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:29.920]  And of course, as you're talking about immigration, it is not
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:32.800]  simply the quantity of immigration that is causing
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:35.480]  economic difficulty, but it's also the quality of
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:36.000]  immigration.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.920]  We have an article on Infowars.com.
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:42.960]  In Calais, migrants are rioting and they're chanting F the UK.
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:45.120]  They demand access to Britain.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:48.160]  It's bone chilling footage that shows their car.
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:51.240]  Some British holiday makers driving through thick clouds of
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:54.960]  tear gas as French riot police battle in vain to restore
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:57.720]  control on the road leading to the town's port.
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:59.760]  And of course, this is something that has been going on for
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:01.080]  quite some time.
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:03.680]  In Calais, they cannot control the situations going there.
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:07.000]  As you mentioned, David Cameron wants to have Turkey in.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.840]  This is something else that came up in this question and
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:10.680]  answer period.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:14.160]  As I pointed out, and he didn't deny it, he said, yes, I have
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:17.000]  said that I would very much like for Turkey to be a member of
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:17.800]  the European Union.
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:19.840]  They are already a member of NATO.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:22.240]  But he goes, that's not going to happen in my lifetime.
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:24.960]  I can't really see that happening for another 30 years.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:27.480]  And you know, Lord Martin, it reminded me of the Old
[01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:30.360]  Testament story about Hezekiah, where he has the
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:32.600]  Babylonians come to visit him in Jerusalem.
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:34.960]  And he shows them all the treasures of Jerusalem.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:38.920]  And after they leave, Isaiah comes into him and he goes,
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:40.560]  what have you done?
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:43.360]  And he goes, here's the message from God.
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:45.960]  He says, these people will take your sons, and they will
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:48.560]  turn them into slaves and eunuchs.
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:51.560]  And his response is, good, it won't happen in my lifetime.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.080]  I mean, that's what we're saying from David Cameron.
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:55.880]  That great, it's not going to happen in my lifetime.
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:56.880]  It'll happen 30 years from now.
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.560]  But it may not happen 30 years from now.
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:44:59.280]  It may be sooner.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:03.960]  But what a despicable attitude that he would say, fine,
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:07.200]  we'll let them loot Britain and destroy this country because
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:08.680]  it won't happen in my lifetime.
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:11.200]  I'll be able to enjoy this in my lifetime.
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:13.240]  Well, that is a very nice parallel.
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:17.440]  The other favorite one I have from Biblical times is that
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:20.080]  curious story of the Lord of Life when He went into the
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:23.920]  desert and the devil visited him there and said, oh, look at
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:25.640]  this splendid world.
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:29.880]  I will give all of this to you if only you follow me.
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:32.680]  Now, that was a very curious and rather dumb thing for the
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:35.600]  devil to say because, of course, the Lord of Life already
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:38.440]  owned the world and indeed the whole universe didn't need to
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:40.520]  be given it by anybody.
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:45.280]  And so often we are given these exaggerated promises by the
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:48.800]  forces of evil that either that something good will happen
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:51.480]  when they know perfectly well it won't, or that something bad,
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:53.120]  if it ever were to happen, wouldn't happen in their
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:53.920]  lifetime.
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:58.080]  This is the line the devil always uses to try to buy
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:59.440]  people's support.
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:02.440]  Talking of buying people's support, that's really what the
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:05.560]  entire Remain campaign, the people who want to stay in the
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:07.280]  EU, that's what they've been doing.
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:08.360]  They've been using two things.
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:11.800]  One is fear, saying we can't survive on our own in the
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:14.240]  tough old world if we come out of the EU.
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:17.720]  Well, it wasn't that long ago that we had an empire that
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:21.240]  covered a quarter of the globe and the sun never set on it.
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:24.400]  It's not as though we haven't had practice in making our own
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:25.520]  way in the world.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:28.720]  We still have our special relationship with the United
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:31.360]  States, despite Mr. Obama having removed the bust of
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:33.000]  Churchill from the White House.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.240]  We still have our special relationship with the common
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:39.520]  wealth of nations, including one nation, Mozambique, that
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:42.720]  never was part of the British Empire, that applied to join
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:47.040]  because it liked the friendliness and common sense of
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:49.080]  purpose that the common wealth has.
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:52.040]  And so all of these links that we already have, and of
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:55.080]  course we also have many friendly links with Europe.
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:58.520]  One thing you should not ever think, David, is that those of
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:04.840]  us who are tired of the European Union are anti-European.
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:06.360]  We are pro-European.
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:09.920]  I studied the ancient civilizations of Greece and
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:13.400]  Rome, and I'm a huge admirer of the contribution that
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:15.840]  Europe has made to our civilization in music, in
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:19.480]  art, in architecture, in literature, in science, in
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:21.000]  so many different fields.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.400]  Europe has been the cradle of today's civilization.
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:27.960]  So why then would I wish to sever myself from it?
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:29.640]  The answer is, I don't.
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:34.160]  But the European Union is not only anti-democratic, it is
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:36.440]  anti-European.
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:40.440]  It stands against the continent that gave the world not
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:44.760]  only the concept, but also the name of democracy.
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:47.560]  It stands against the civilization, the Christian
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:51.440]  civilization, that has been such a gentle force
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:54.320]  throughout the world, such a force for good on balance.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:57.080]  Not that us Christians are perfect by any means, but at
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:58.960]  least we're trying to be.
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:01.800]  And this is all rejected by the European Union.
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:04.920]  So your raising of the biblical quotation there is a very
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:08.040]  important one, because although most of our church
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:11.360]  leaders who are left-wing are therefore in favor of the
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:15.080]  European Union, some of them are beginning to wake up to
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:18.800]  the fact that the biggest threat to religion here in
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:21.680]  Britain is the European Union itself.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:24.160]  This is a growing problem now.
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:27.080]  For instance, no Catholic ends up as a commissar, or very
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:30.240]  few of them do, because they're subjected to a grilling, a
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:32.000]  public grilling by the other commissars.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.040]  And one of the questions they tend to get asked is, what is
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:36.720]  your view about homosexuality?
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:39.040]  And of course, if you're Catholic, you say, well, I'm
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:40.960]  terribly sorry, but the church is against it.
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:43.160]  I'm not against any individual homosexual.
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:46.160]  But what they do is something that we think is wrong.
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:48.240]  And it's wrong because it's medically dangerous.
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.720]  And if you say that, you can't become a commissar.
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:54.800]  So they're already getting into the moral sphere, as well as
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:56.920]  the economic sphere and the political sphere and the
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:01.280]  democratic sphere, and taking over and allowing only one
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:03.560]  point of view, which is generally a very left wing and
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:06.720]  very anti-religious point of view, to prevail.
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:09.360]  And it's not just in appointing people into office.
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:13.560]  As Boris Johnson pointed out, he went through, it was about
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:15.720]  a month ago, and I covered it and talked about the
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:18.960]  parallels between the reasons that he said would be good
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:21.080]  for Britain to get out of the European Union.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:23.520]  And I said, hey, these are all great reasons for Texas to
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:26.880]  get out of the United States to secede from the United
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:28.280]  States, we ought to have a Texas.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:30.640]  And actually, there was an article that came out a
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:32.000]  couple of days ago from The Guardian.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.360]  I guess they saw that, or they were talking to some Texas
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:37.920]  independence people and called it Texas.
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:40.640]  But one of the things that he said would be able to get
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.080]  out from under the jurisdiction of the European
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:44.600]  Court of Justice, which is increasingly arbitrating in
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:46.360]  questions over which we never thought it would have any
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:48.720]  power, like the rights of a child, getting into the
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:49.440]  family.
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:53.480]  And so they've got a court that is intruding itself into
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:55.320]  the details of individual life.
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:57.400]  It's not just excluding people because of their
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:00.880]  religious beliefs, but it's that kind of intolerance.
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:03.640]  And you mentioned Winston Churchill a couple of times.
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:06.320]  His boss, we talked about the issue of whether or not
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:09.240]  David Cameron is acting like Neville Chamberlain.
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:11.160]  When Winston Churchill talked in the history of the
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:15.320]  English-speaking people about the American Brexit, our
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:18.360]  revolution, what he said was it was a liberating force
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:19.360]  for Britain.
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:22.360]  He said what it did was it enabled them to strengthen
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.200]  parliamentary democracy.
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:25.920]  And I think the people, you're talking about, there's no
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:28.280]  animosity, there's no xenophobia about the people
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:29.080]  of Europe.
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:31.560]  You don't want to isolate yourself from them.
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:35.040]  But it is something that the European groups themselves
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:38.480]  want self-government just like you want it in Britain.
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:41.720]  And so it would be a liberating thing for all of the
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:42.840]  people of Europe.
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:46.440]  That is why the powers that be, the political, globalist
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:49.200]  powers, why all of the industrialists and people
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:52.480]  like George Soros, all of the central bankers are working
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:55.360]  so hard to defeat this referendum tomorrow.
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:56.120]  Stay with us.
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:57.960]  We'll be right back with Lord Moncton, and we're going to
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:00.440]  have more Trump coverage coming up in the next hour, plus
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:01.560]  a report from Alex Jones.

[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:33.040]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:34.720]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:37.520]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:39.800]  I've helped thousands, and I can help you too.
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:41.840]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement, and I'm telling
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:44.320]  you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:48.560]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt with the

[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:59.120]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX, or my website, DanPilla.com.
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:01.520]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:02.800]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:04.000]  Why is this so good?
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.880]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:09.320]  that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:12.880]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:14.520]  and water and beverages in my system,
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:18.400]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:21.000]  which is anything that's harmful to your body
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.760]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:26.560]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:29.080]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:30.400]  These are all parasites.
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:31.560]  Tell us about all the stuff that says
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:32.840]  there's so many things that are in it.
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:34.080]  You have the neem in there.
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:37.280]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:39.440]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:40.560]  at least twice a year.
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:42.280]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in,
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:43.680]  because I'm going back on it today.
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:44.680]  It just came back in yesterday.

[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:04.600]  but against principalities, against powers,
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:07.280]  against the rulers of the darkness of this world.
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:09.240]  There is a war against Christianity,

[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:37.480]  And men wasn't made to live underground.

[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:03.400]  ["Monday To Monday"]
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.040]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:13.120]  I'm David Knight and we're talking
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:14.080]  to Lord Moncton.
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:16.960]  We're talking about the upcoming election tomorrow, Brexit.
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:18.600]  Will Britain leave the European Union?
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:21.840]  Will they vote for freedom for self-government?
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:26.840]  Or will they be subsumed into this expanding Borg?
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:29.480]  Just before we went to break, we mentioned Texas.
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:32.600]  And Lord Moncton, about a month ago,
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:35.800]  Boris Johnson, former mayor of London,
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:37.600]  came out and gave eight reasons
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:39.640]  why Britain would be better off
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:40.680]  outside the European Union.
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:43.080]  And when he did that, I played each one of the points
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:45.520]  and I said, you know, what would happen
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:49.520]  if Texas left the United States,
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:51.240]  if we succeeded successfully?
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:52.880]  And like the first point, he says,
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:55.240]  well, there's 350 million pounds per week
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:57.920]  that are going to the European Union net
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:54:58.760]  that we're losing.
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:54:59.760]  And I looked at our numbers
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:02.880]  and I came up with one and a half billion per week
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:05.160]  going to the federal government net from Texans.
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:06.520]  And so we would have that money to spend.
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:08.040]  So there were all these different parallels
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:09.720]  where we'd go step by step and say,
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:12.160]  hey, why can't we govern ourselves?
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:15.320]  Texas is 10 times larger than all 13 colonies
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:19.600]  were combined at the time they did their Brexit.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:22.040]  So clearly we have a much more diversified economy.
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:24.000]  We have our own energy sources.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.400]  Just as Britain does, we could go it alone as well.
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:31.360]  Oh, we don't have-
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:33.760]  In the daily caller a month ago,
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:38.200]  and I was recommending that Texas should indeed secede.
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:43.200]  I believe it has a right under its own constitution
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:47.120]  when it joined the union to reserve the chance
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:49.120]  to secede if it ever wished to do so.
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:50.520]  And I believe it's the only state
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:52.200]  that has this special privilege.
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:55.800]  However, under the post-colonial disposition
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:57.720]  in international law,
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:59.400]  where the right of self-determination
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:01.120]  of people's is paramount.
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:03.960]  If the people of Texas, which is quite large enough
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:05.800]  and economically prosperous enough
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:08.080]  to be viable as an independent state,
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:10.520]  chose to become independent,
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:14.200]  whether or not the United States Constitution
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:15.680]  or the Texas Constitution allows it,
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:18.720]  if the people of Texas want it, then they should have it.
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:21.280]  And I know the Republican leadership in Texas,
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:25.280]  rather shabbily, managed to die.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:31.800]  We're getting a little bit of problem there
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:33.400]  with the reception on our Skype
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:35.000]  that's starting to drop out.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.880]  Let's say, yeah, are we back now?
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:39.960]  Oh, I'm sorry about that.
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:42.000]  Yes, yes, we lost you there for a moment on Skype.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.560]  Go ahead, we're back.
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:45.640]  Okay, I'll just carry on.
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:48.080]  I was saying that Texas makes a lot of sense.
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.240]  You have the right to secede,
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:52.600]  even if the United States says you haven't,
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:54.920]  and even if the Texas Constitution says you haven't.
[01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:56.520]  If the people wish it.
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:59.560]  Under the post-colonial disposition in international law,
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:01.840]  you are entitled to become independent
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:03.840]  whenever you wish to do so.
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:06.040]  Well, Boris Johnson is talking about Independence Day.
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:08.600]  That's what our Declaration of Independence says.
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:11.880]  I mean, there certainly wasn't any legal authority
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:13.440]  for them to do it from the British crown.
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:16.320]  There wasn't any opportunity from the King to say,
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:19.040]  well, you can just leave whenever you want to.
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:21.360]  They took that right, they declared that right,
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:23.560]  because they said, as human beings,
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:26.720]  we have these natural rights that we possess
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:28.160]  to secure our liberties.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:29.960]  That's the reason that we create governments.
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:32.040]  That's the fundamental basis for our government.
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:35.120]  So I'm in favor of anybody having self-government
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:36.960]  at any level.
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:39.240]  And that is how international law now works,
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:40.880]  particularly in the post-colonial era.
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:42.720]  And I'm going to make you an offer here, David.
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:44.080]  I'm going to say this.
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:47.720]  On behalf of Her Majesty and the British government,
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:51.720]  if Texas would like to leave the United States
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:56.360]  and rejoin the crown, then the only tax you will pay
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:59.760]  is half a crown of pound on tea.
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:01.560]  And the rest, you won't have to pay.
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:04.440]  Now, you compare that with what your federal government
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:07.200]  charges, and you see that you'll be better off
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:10.440]  under the crown than you would under the United States.
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:12.040]  Well, we would have that taxation
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:13.040]  with some representation.
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:14.520]  See, the problem we have now, Lord Moncton,
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:17.480]  is we have regulation without representation,
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:19.360]  just as you do in the EU, except ours
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:21.600]  is coming from the federal bureaucracy.
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:25.960]  They enact an even larger bureaucratic burden on us
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:27.920]  than the European Union does on Britain.
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:29.760]  Stay with us right after the top of the hour.
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:31.120]  We're going to be back with Lord Moncton
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:32.240]  for another five minutes.
[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:34.240]  Thank you for sticking around for another five minutes.
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:36.040]  Then after that, Alex Jones is going
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:37.680]  to be joining us with more comments
[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:39.280]  about Donald Trump's speech today.
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:40.720]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:43.960]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:46.240]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:51.120]  Shower filters.
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:55.280]  We're introducing the best yet, the brand new ProPure ProMax
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:56.840]  high performance shower filter.
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:59.640]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants

[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:25.480]  No one has put together a formula
[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:28.720]  that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:31.720]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:18.240]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover us.
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:19.960]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:21.560]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:27.960]  Live from the infowarst.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:29.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:30.840]  I'm David Knight, and we're talking to Lord Moncton.
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:32.760]  We've been talking about the vote coming up tomorrow.
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:35.320]  It's whether or not Britain will leave the European Union.
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:36.600]  But now I want to switch gears.
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:38.840]  I want to talk to Lord Moncton about another vote that's
[02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:41.200]  coming up tomorrow, one that's in California.
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:43.640]  This is a vote as to whether or not California
[02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:45.040]  will leave its senses.
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:47.840]  Well, I should say, leave, further leave their senses,
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:50.240]  because they've done it in so many different ways.
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:52.640]  This is something, of course, we've talked about many times.
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:54.880]  And Lord Moncton, usually when he comes on,
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:57.040]  he's talking about climate change.
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:00.800]  Again, you can find him at scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:03.640]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:05.600]  And what's up with that?
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:09.920]  That's W-A-T-T-S. What'supwiththat.com.
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:12.160]  You can find Lord Moncton's writings there.
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:14.560]  Now, we've seen Bill Nye come out and say
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:17.800]  that there needs to be RICO prosecution against people
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:20.760]  who deny man-made global warming.
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:24.400]  Tomorrow, we have a vote scheduled in California.
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:27.360]  The Senate is going to vote on a first of its kind
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:30.720]  legislation, scheduled for floor action tomorrow.
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:33.080]  The measure would allow state and local prosecutors
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:36.680]  to pursue claims against climate change skepticism
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:40.440]  as a violation of the state's unfair competition law,
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:43.400]  as well as extend the four-year statute of limitations
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:45.080]  for such claims retroactively.
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:49.720]  Retroactively to January the 1st, 2021.
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:52.680]  The bill, according to the Senate Rules Committee analysis,
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:55.200]  it says this bill explicitly authorizes
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:58.280]  district attorneys and the California Attorney General
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:01.440]  to pursue these claims, alleging that a business
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:04.040]  or organization has directly or indirectly engaged
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:05.440]  in unfair competition.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:09.600]  Just because you are engaging in scientific discussion,
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:12.840]  that is absolutely amazing, Lord Moncton, your comments.
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:14.360]  Well, that is communism.
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:16.880]  And I'm not surprised that California of all places
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:19.040]  should be the first state to try this on.
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:21.360]  It's also directly contrary, as I understand it,
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:23.120]  to the First Amendment to your Constitution,
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:25.800]  which guarantees the right of free speech.
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:28.840]  So I don't think this bill, even if it were passed
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:31.600]  as a sort of gesture to please the communist left,
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:33.960]  which now infests most of California,
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:38.960]  I don't think even the Obama tainted Supreme Court
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:42.480]  could possibly allow such a bill to stand.
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:44.200]  It would be struck down the first time
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:45.680]  a case was brought under it.
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:49.400]  So I don't think that's a realistic problem, really.
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:52.120]  The other thing is, of course, that the one thing
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:55.000]  that the communist left will not do
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.280]  is take any climate skeptic to court.
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:03.280]  Because of course, in a court, whether they like it or not,
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:05.600]  both sides have to be fairly heard
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:07.080]  in the way that they're not fairly heard
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:09.760]  in the mainstream or mainstream media.
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:12.120]  The fact is that in a court, both sides are fairly heard.
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:16.000]  And when we took Al Gore's movie to court
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.240]  in the High Court in London,
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:21.280]  the first firm of solicitors we tried to engage to do this
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:23.120]  refused to take the case on the grounds
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:26.320]  that we had absolutely no chance of winning.
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:28.440]  And so I was consulted by the people
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:29.400]  who wanted to bring the case.
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:31.600]  And I said, well, just find another firm of solicitors
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:35.640]  and I will give them scientific testimony,
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:38.760]  which will demonstrate that the film is not scientific,
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:40.920]  it's anti-scientific, it's political,
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:43.040]  it's left-wing political of that.
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:46.720]  And under an act of parliament, the Education Act, 1988,
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:50.440]  which I helped to draft when I worked at 10 Downing Street
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:52.280]  with Margaret Thatcher,
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:56.560]  it's illegal to take sides in politics in schools.
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:03:58.200]  You can by all means have political discussions,
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:03:59.440]  but you mustn't take sides.
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:02.680]  And I said that because all these errors in Al Gore's movie
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:04.280]  pointed in one direction,
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:07.280]  towards undue and anti-scientific alarm,
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:08.560]  the film shouldn't be shown
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:11.280]  unless corrective guidance were circulated,
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:12.800]  we won that case.
[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:14.120]  And it's...
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:25.480]  And they took the case in California.
[02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:26.760]  I'm sorry, it's breaking up again.
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:28.040]  Yes, yes, we broke up a little bit.
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:29.760]  If they tried to take...
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:31.800]  Okay, if they tried to take that case,
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:35.120]  even to the left-wing judges in California,
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:38.200]  once they hear the arguments on both sides,
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:40.360]  they will realize that it is, in fact,
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:43.000]  the communist left and the climate change extremists
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.520]  who are wrong and the skeptics who are correct.
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:46.360]  The truth will out.
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:48.160]  Thank you so much, Lord Moncton,
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:51.440]  and I hope that you vote for your Independence Day tomorrow.
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:52.400]  We'll all be watching.
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:55.000]  All the eyes of the world will be on Britain tomorrow.
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.880]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones' analysis
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:04:59.280]  of Donald Trump's speech today.
[02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:30.280]  I don't know if Salman has left the state or not.
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:32.360]  How it's possible that Nor Salman
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:34.320]  has given federal authorities the slip
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:35.880]  is beyond comprehension.
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:37.160]  So let me get this straight.
[02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:39.760]  Federal authorities are continually bypassing
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:42.840]  the Constitution in violation of our rights
[02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:44.680]  so that in the name of terrorism,
[02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:46.760]  they can conduct unconstitutional
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:49.440]  and completely useless spying.
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:52.120]  But perhaps the department just needs more funding.
[02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:53.840]  That always seems to do the trick.
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:06:00.000]  Leigh Ann McAdoo for infowars.com.
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.320]  More than two years ago, infowars first
[02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:04.280]  told you about our research into what
[02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:06.480]  has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:08.040]  I've told you about how scientists
[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:10.600]  have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:13.960]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started
[02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:16.800]  taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride,
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:19.480]  the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:23.120]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:25.160]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened,
[02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:28.120]  as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:30.000]  how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.280]  Now in 2016, even more information
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:36.360]  has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine
[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:39.440]  and the gut, which many experts are now saying
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:42.960]  could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:44.800]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:46.800]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth
[02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:49.080]  is that iodine is essential, in my view,
[02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:51.080]  to any optimum health regimen.

[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:01.800]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:03.000]  Try a bottle of it.
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.600]  Rob Doe joins us.
[02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:07.600]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:08.800]  Tell us what brainforce did.
[02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:09.760]  I'd been working all day.
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:12.240]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:14.240]  I get in here at 8.30.
[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:15.600]  I was kind of run down.
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:17.480]  I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:19.800]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:21.280]  I got my bottle of brainforce right there.
[02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:22.200]  I popped two of them.
[02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:24.560]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing.
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:26.600]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:28.040]  It's got four and a half stars.
[02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:29.280]  People really love it.
[02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:29.920]  Read about it.
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:32.600]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites
[02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:34.560]  give it such high praise, because it really
[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:37.680]  does have the best organic-based systems that
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:39.000]  will blow your socks off.
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.800]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:43.320]  but I probably could not have done it without brainforce.
[02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:45.680]  I went home about 6.45 this morning.
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:46.960]  Took three hours to sleep.
[02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:49.480]  Got up, took two more brainforce, and came in.
[02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:53.040]  You will find brainforce and other game-changing products
[02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:58.160]  at infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:15.920]  You are listening to an infowars.com front-line report.
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:20.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:22.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:25.600]  And day to night, we were just talking to Lord Moncton
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:29.360]  about this law that is going to be voted on tomorrow.
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:32.440]  And California is coming to the Senate floor as to whether or not
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:34.800]  they will use criminal prosecution
[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:38.760]  to gag anyone who denies their man-made global warming.
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:41.720]  Of course, there's an article that came out last week
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:43.600]  from the Washington Times.
[02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:45.440]  GOP attorney general is one of the Democrats
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:48.160]  that if climate skeptics can be prosecuted for fraud,
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:49.200]  so can alarmists.
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:51.320]  And that's exactly what Lord Moncton was talking about.
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:52.840]  They had their day in court.
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:53.600]  And he won.
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:57.720]  He proved that Al Gore's documentary, An Inconvenient Truth,
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:59.600]  was simply a convenient lie.
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:01.960]  And they banned it from being taught,
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:07.040]  shown in the schools, without a accompanying rebuttal
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:08.520]  from the documents there.
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:10.880]  And of course, if they're going to do that in California,
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:12.800]  if they're going to try to censor anybody that
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:14.640]  disagrees with them, let's say, go ahead.
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:15.960]  Throw me in that briar patch.
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:16.920]  We'll have that discussion.
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:21.120]  We'll have it in court, and we will adjudicate the science
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:23.200]  in court, because that's really what we need to have,
[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:25.200]  is we need to have a open discussion of this
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:26.800]  that we're not going to get in the media.
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:30.080]  Now, we're going to have Alex Jones has given us
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:33.080]  an analysis of Donald Trump's speech today.
[02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:35.720]  That was a speech that we've been waiting for for quite some time.
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:38.240]  He said it was going to happen a week ago last Monday.
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:40.400]  Because of shooting in Orlando, that was delayed.
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:44.040]  Today, he unloaded on Hillary Clinton
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:47.080]  a massive expose of Hillary Clinton.
[02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:50.840]  And Alex Jones is going to be joining us in just a moment
[02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:51.840]  with that analysis.
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:53.840]  Before we go to Alex, I just want to remind you
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:57.240]  that he's extended for one more day the Tim Kennedy Special.
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:00.880]  This is 15% off supermail vitality, brain force,
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:03.240]  and secret 12 and infowarslife.com.
[02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:05.440]  And of course, we picked these products,
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:08.640]  because these are the ones that Tim Kennedy, who trains
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:11.880]  as a professional athlete for the UFC fighters,
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:16.360]  as well as special forces, he trains three hours a day minimum.
[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:20.120]  He said, these are the products that I can immediately feel.
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:22.960]  I gave these to the UFC, and they looked at them.
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:24.480]  They said, there's absolutely nothing
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:26.680]  that would disqualify you from being a competitor.
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:29.560]  These are safe, and he says they're very effective.
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:33.160]  So we put these together, and it's been a very popular special.
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:35.480]  So Alex has extended this for one day.
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:40.160]  15% off supermail vitality, brain force, secret 12.
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:41.680]  The products that Tim Kennedy says,
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:45.160]  he felt helped him the most to find that at infowarslife.com.

[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:05.960]  Now, here's Alex's analysis of what Donald Trump said earlier
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:10.120]  today as he defined Hillary Clinton for us.
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:14.160]  World-class liar, he said.
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:15.080]  Donald Trump did it.
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:19.200]  He delivered on his promise in a lengthy speech
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:22.680]  detailing the criminal activities and the corrupt
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:24.640]  activities of Hillary Clinton.
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:27.800]  From our corrupt foundation to giving secrets
[02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:31.680]  to the Communist Chinese, to the mysterious death of Vince
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:35.440]  Foster, to all of her corrupt trade deals with foreign nations
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:38.400]  selling a sound, he covered the waterfront.
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:40.520]  And today, throughout the four hours,
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:43.400]  we're going to be airing excerpts of this important speech.
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:49.280]  The full speech, unredacted, is posted as we speak to infowars.com.
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:53.640]  Now, earlier, I engaged in a little bit of a rant dealing
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:57.000]  with the fact that Slate Magazine and others are acting like I'm
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.720]  crazy for calling for a criminal investigation of Hillary
[02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:02.720]  and saying that she should be sent to prison, not
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:05.080]  to the White House, in 2016.
[02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:06.800]  They're claiming that's conspiratorial.
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:08.720]  They're claiming it's mentally ill.
[02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:11.960]  They actually say it's part of a Republican psychosis
[02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:14.360]  saying there's corruption in the Democratic Party.
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:15.560]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:17.320]  There's corruption in both parties.
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:19.520]  But the Democrats have been getting away with anything
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:22.680]  and everything forever, and it's getting worse.
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:25.240]  And the Rhino Republicans have been up there protecting them.
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:28.240]  And so whether it's our movement for Hillary from prison
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:30.760]  or Donald Trump getting up there and exposing her crimes
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:33.880]  and corruption, this is all part of bringing reality back
[02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:36.680]  and saying, look, you don't control reality.
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:38.720]  And yes, folks, this is a theme I'm pushing.
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:40.600]  These people do not control reality.
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:41.720]  They think they do.
[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:45.200]  They think they dictate to us like gods from Mount Olympus.
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:46.440]  And they don't.
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:49.720]  Hillary Clinton is one of the singularly most corrupt people
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:52.000]  in modern history that I could think of.
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.320]  She makes third world dictators.
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:57.240]  In Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:12:59.480]  look like choir boys.
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:02.440]  And all they've got is this gimmick that she's a woman.
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:04.760]  And they may double down and have Elizabeth Warren,
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:07.240]  the senator, as her running mate, Pocahontas,
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:09.760]  because she claims she's Native American and isn't.
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:12.440]  The media claims they don't get that joke from Trump.
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:14.320]  And look, I love the fact that Trump's not just exposing
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:15.120]  corruption.
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:16.480]  He's exposing political correctness
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:18.880]  and being politically incorrect to show people
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:21.120]  it's OK to say what you really think.
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:23.280]  It's OK to ridicule these people because they
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:25.280]  want to sit up there with these areas of invincibility,
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:29.560]  like gods, as I said earlier, dictating to us from on high,
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:31.560]  from up on the mountain.
[02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:32.560]  And they're crooks.
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:33.600]  They have criminal histories.
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:34.360]  They're liars.
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:35.760]  They're known scammers.
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:38.040]  And it's time to start disrespecting them.
[02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:40.040]  It's time to start making fun of them.
[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:43.040]  It's time to start doing what I did years ago.
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:44.440]  And I said, hey, I got to go take
[02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:46.000]  a Queen Elizabeth II.
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.400]  People said, why would you make such a crude gross joke?
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:50.840]  I'm not a crude gross person because this woman takes
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:52.200]  herself so seriously.
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:55.440]  Her propaganda to worship her and her globalist organization
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:56.520]  is all over the media.
[02:13:56.520 --> 02:13:58.040]  And I, for one, am sick of it.
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:00.120]  So whether it's Queen Elizabeth II
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:02.800]  or whether it's Hillary Clinton, who's
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:05.440]  in the same guild, in the same outhouse,
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:07.560]  these people are jokes and are frauds.
[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:10.120]  And it's time that we pull these idols down.
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:11.840]  It's time we stop worshiping them.
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:13.280]  And that goes for Hollywood.
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:16.120]  That goes for hypocrites and people
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:18.000]  like Michael Moore, who have all these bodyguards, who
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.800]  don't want you to be able to protect yourself.
[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:23.480]  That goes for people like George Clooney, who has bodyguards,
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:26.000]  doesn't take in one refugee, but sits there and says,
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:27.360]  Donald Trump's a racist.
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:30.040]  These people are pig-like frauds.
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:32.360]  And in closing, before we start playing some of these clips,
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:33.840]  I'm going to make this point.
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:35.680]  I'm coming after George Clooney.
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:37.520]  And I'm coming after Michael Moore.
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:39.120]  And I'm coming after politically.
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:41.000]  And in the information war, I'm coming
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.840]  after all these hypocrites.
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:46.000]  We've already exposed them before, but take YouTube.
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.880]  The last six months, whenever I load Spotify on my phone
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:55.480]  or my car, it launches the latest YouTube album from YouTube
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:57.160]  and then tries to charge me.
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:15:00.000]  And so I went ahead and googled it last week,
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:03.680]  knowing it, and lo and behold, it's a two-year-old scam
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:06.800]  where they force load it, a hack, onto your Spotify
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:08.560]  and charge you.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:14.160]  It's two guys on the cover hugging each other naked.
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:17.440]  I mean, that's what's getting so sick about this is,
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:19.480]  I'm sitting there with my kids in the car.
[02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:22.600]  I plug in Spotify to play stories, form, or music,
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:23.800]  or whatever.
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:26.680]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:28.080]  It's not just Spotify.
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:32.400]  It's iTunes as well and entire platforms across the system.
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:37.880]  So again, this has been going on for two years on iTunes
[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:41.560]  and Spotify and Lord Knows Where Other Platforms.
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:42.960]  That's just what comes up on Google.
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:44.480]  And they're still doing it.
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:45.880]  They don't care.
[02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:47.280]  And it gets 10 times worse.
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:49.120]  Remember YouTube.
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:51.640]  It gives money to supposed charities.
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:53.360]  And then it was less than 1%.
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:55.320]  They were actually giving to starving Africans
[02:15:55.320 --> 02:15:56.160]  and stuff like that.
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:58.640]  They would raise billions in some cases a year,
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:01.120]  have TV coverage everywhere, have people pay them,
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:02.120]  have all these sponsors.
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:05.440]  And then Bono keeps 99%.
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:10.440]  When he got criticized, he started giving 1.1% or 1.2%.
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:15.040]  But it's OK because he's liberal and wears red-lensed glasses.
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:18.320]  Why, if he wore purple lens, he might be somebody
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:19.480]  like John Lennon.
[02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:21.440]  The difference is John Lennon turned against the New World
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:23.880]  Order, started speaking out against it, and was murdered.
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:25.880]  And by the way, I don't just have that from pop culture.
[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:28.800]  I know that directly from people very close.
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:30.320]  And I'll just stop right there.
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:31.720]  These people are jokes.
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:32.800]  And they think you're stupid.
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:34.520]  And you're conning yourselves when
[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:36.840]  you think they're not sitting there praying on you,
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:39.800]  laughing at you and your family, whether it's Bono and YouTube
[02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:41.600]  and all of their scams.
[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:43.120]  It doesn't matter.
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:45.280]  It's the same guild of predators.
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:47.360]  And look, I know our audience says, Alex, tell us something
[02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:48.040]  we don't know.
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:48.720]  We already know this.
[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:49.480]  Stop lecturing us.
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:51.840]  Hey, I apologize if that's how this was taken.
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:54.360]  This is to the mainline trendings who
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:55.840]  don't know what's going on, who don't
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:57.720]  know what's happening, who don't know the whole world's
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:00.560]  being established and set up to run scams on them.
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:02.360]  That's who I'm reaching out to.
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:03.520]  Because this isn't my opinion.
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:07.360]  You have become chumps, super chumps, super marks,
[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:11.520]  super smucks, super idiots, super targets,
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:13.440]  super prey to be fed on.
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:16.560]  And for heaven's sakes, break out of your trance
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:17.640]  and your conditioning.
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:21.160]  They think you're so passive and so stupid
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:24.160]  that they literally keep all the money from charity
[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:26.400]  and run untold scams on everybody.
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:29.400]  And George Clooney sits up there and lectures us.
[02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:30.960]  I mean, this is just insane.
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:32.440]  But Bono's allowed to do it because he
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:35.600]  rubs elbows with a U.N. and he hangs out with the politicians
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:37.240]  and makes them feel important.
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:39.120]  It's just a bunch of sick filth that's
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:43.000]  taught us to worship them while they live and while we sleep.
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:43.760]  And I am done.
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:45.880]  This is a revolution against all these frauds.
[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:47.680]  It's a revolution against celebrity.
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:49.760]  It's a revolution against false garbage.
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:51.880]  And it's a revolution of the true rise of humanity
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:53.320]  against this trash.
[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:54.440]  It's time to hate them.
[02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:57.080]  It's time to absolutely disdain them.
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:17:58.320]  It's time to criticize them.
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:17:59.600]  It's time to spit on them.
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:01.520]  It's time to realize how filthy they are.
[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:04.680]  It's time to replace foul words with their names.
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:06.880]  It's time to pull down their idols everywhere.
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:09.440]  And absolutely know this filth hates you and your family
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:11.960]  and is preying on you and sucking your literal life force
[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:12.800]  out of you.
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:14.640]  Now back to the global transmission.
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:15.240]  Absolutely right.
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:18.400]  That's Alex Jones phoning in that report from the road
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:21.200]  and analyzing what Donald Trump said today.
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:23.200]  And of course, we talked at the beginning of the program
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:26.360]  about this slate article talking about Hillary for Prison
[02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:29.400]  and saying, yeah, this is a psychosis of the GOP base.
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:31.080]  This is a longtime psychosis.
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:33.720]  And yet the lady that they talk to who
[02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:36.840]  has that Hillary for Prison t-shirt that they talk about,
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:38.360]  she got it at infowars.com.
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:40.560]  They say, well, she grew up liberal.
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:42.320]  She voted for Obama in 2008.
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:45.600]  But now she agrees when she hears Trump say that Obama might
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:46.520]  have something else in mind.
[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:47.520]  Why does she agree that?
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:50.960]  She's not part of that long term GOP psychosis.
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:54.520]  Their very article cannot escape the fact they have to admit.
[02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:57.840]  They say, well, in fact, yes, as she noted, Bill and Hillary's
[02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:00.840]  Clinton Foundation did take between $10 and $25 million
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:03.400]  from Saudi Arabia, millions more from other regimes
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:06.600]  and political actors that oppress the rights of women,
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:09.360]  gays, and religious minorities, the very people
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:11.840]  that Hillary Clinton says her whole campaign
[02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:13.160]  is to represent them.
[02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:15.240]  It's an identity campaign that she wants to run.
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:19.560]  And yet she's taking money from the people
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:21.160]  that oppress these very people.
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:23.240]  She says she's going to help.
[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:26.880]  And it truly is a criminal operation.
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:28.840]  We've seen this for a very long time.
[02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:30.760]  Some people are just now starting to wake up to it.
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:33.480]  Today, Donald Trump laid out the details.
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:35.120]  And we're going to play some more clips
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:36.440]  from what he said earlier today.
[02:19:36.440 --> 02:19:39.160]  We're also going to take your calls if you want to call in
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:42.160]  and give us your take on what Donald Trump said today.
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:45.080]  800-259-9231.
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:48.040]  800-259-9231.
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:50.440]  We'll take your calls on what Donald Trump said about Hillary
[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:51.080]  Clinton.
[02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:53.240]  He defined her today.
[02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:55.400]  Broadly, we'll be right back.
[02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:02.120]  Is the recession really over?
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:04.000]  Is a bigger one on the way?
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.720]  Will our next president lead us to prosperity and peace?
[02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:09.160]  Or will it all fall apart?
[02:20:09.160 --> 02:20:11.720]  Our modern world is unpredictable and unstable.
[02:20:11.720 --> 02:20:13.680]  Are you ready for what comes next?
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:14.960]  What if the worst happens?
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:16.880]  Will your family have enough food?
[02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:20.640]  Willing to gamble that nothing bad will ever happen to you?

[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:04.000]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from infowarslife.com.

[02:21:22.800 --> 02:21:24.720]  In the history of infowarslife, we've
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:26.800]  brought out a lot of amazing products
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:29.600]  like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality,
[02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:30.640]  and so many others.
[02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:34.520]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:37.640]  with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing
[02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:40.280]  process designed for maximized effects.
[02:21:40.280 --> 02:21:43.640]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin

[02:21:59.360 --> 02:22:02.720]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator,
[02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:04.960]  but were waiting for an outrageously low price,
[02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:07.600]  you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:08.360]  Here's why.
[02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:11.400]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems,
[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:12.520]  and it's getting worse.
[02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:13.400]  So please listen.
[02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:15.440]  Solar generators really do provide
[02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:17.120]  life-saving electrical power.
[02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:20.240]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently,
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:22.840]  emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity
[02:22:22.840 --> 02:22:23.520]  from the sun.
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:26.040]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts,
[02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:28.280]  intensifying civil unrest, you're not
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:30.760]  going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:33.120]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.

[02:22:43.240 --> 02:22:44.640]  for M4Wars listeners.

[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:15.560]  MUSIC
[02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:16.800]  Welcome back to the Alice Jones Show.
[02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:20.160]  I'm David Knight and, of course, the big events today
[02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:22.120]  are the Brexit vote coming up tomorrow.
[02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:24.560]  We just talked to Lord Moncton about that.
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:27.520]  As the new American says, it's the billionaires
[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:30.160]  and the globalist versus the people.
[02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:32.680]  Brexit d-day vote is tomorrow.
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:35.400]  Here in the United States, we have a similar issue,
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:37.880]  and that is whether or not we're going to control our country
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:40.520]  or whether we're going to lose it to the globalists.
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:44.240]  And, of course, our vote is not about leaving a union,
[02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:45.440]  but it's whether or not we're going
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:48.360]  to leave the establishment that has controlled
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:51.880]  our political process from both parties for a very long time.
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:53.760]  Donald Trump is the face of that vote.
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:56.840]  It's really about globalism versus nationalism
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:58.880]  when we look at the election that is coming up.
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:01.760]  Today, Donald Trump gave an extensive speech.
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:05.160]  And, of course, he'd promised to do this a week ago last Monday
[02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:06.240]  with the shooting in Orlando.
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:08.000]  It was postponed today.
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.840]  He covered broadly all of the issues
[02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:13.200]  about Hillary Clinton's corruption, her character
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:14.240]  issues, and others.
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:16.400]  We're going to take your calls here in just a moment.
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:18.600]  Before we do, I want to play this one clip
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:22.440]  where he takes on her slogan, where she says, I'm with her.
[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:23.160]  That's her slogan.
[02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:24.960]  Here's what he has to say.
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:27.640]  She believes she's entitled to the office.
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:31.400]  Her campaign slogan is, I'm with her.
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:33.960]  You know what my response is to that?
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:37.000]  I'm with you, the American people.
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:55.160]  OK, that's not about this individual.
[02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:56.440]  That's what we keep seeing.
[02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:57.760]  It's her sense of entitlement.
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:25:58.760]  He got that exactly right.
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:00.080]  He goes on.
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:02.120]  I know it's all about you.
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:04.920]  I know it's all about making America great again
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:08.720]  for all Americans, all Americans.
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:12.440]  Our country lost its way when it stopped putting
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:15.120]  the American people really first.
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:19.160]  We have to go back to putting our American people first.
[02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:23.800]  We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:26.960]  focusing on what's good for America's middle class
[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:30.120]  to a policy of globalism, focusing
[02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:33.360]  on how to make money for large corporations who
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:36.920]  can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:40.200]  all to the detriment of the American worker
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:44.120]  and the American economy itself.
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:44.640]  Exactly.
[02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:47.040]  Now, what he did was, it's brilliant.
[02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:48.000]  He took her slogan.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:49.960]  She says, her slogan is, I'm with her.
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:51.240]  He says, no, I'm with you.
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:52.640]  I'm with the American people.
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:54.920]  What he could also do is he could take his slogan,
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:58.800]  make America great, and say, her campaign is really
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:00.720]  make Hillary great.
[02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:01.960]  That's what she's saying.
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:05.320]  Get behind me, make me great.
[02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:09.480]  What he's saying is, we are going to take on the globalists.
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:11.720]  We are going to take back control of our country.
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:14.200]  We're going to do things that are in the interest
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:18.640]  of the American people, not in the interest of the elite few,
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:21.800]  who believe that they are entitled to rule over us.
[02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:23.840]  And of course, Hillary Clinton perfectly
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:24.880]  represents those people.
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:27.880]  That's why conservatives, like the National Review,
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:30.400]  the rest of the GOP establishment,
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:33.160]  are dumping on Trump. They would love to see Hillary Clinton.
[02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:35.160]  They are of the same cloth.
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:36.640]  They want the same things.
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:38.200]  Let's go to one of our callers here.
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:39.720]  Chris and Georgia, your comments
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:41.280]  about Donald Trump's speech today.
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:43.280]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:43.920]  Hello, David.
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:46.160]  Thanks for your commitment to the info war.
[02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:47.000]  Well, thank you for calling.
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.280]  What's your comments?
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:51.960]  I don't think exposing Hillary would change anything,
[02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:55.360]  because most supporters will still say, at this point,
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:27:56.640]  what difference does it make?
[02:27:56.640 --> 02:27:58.760]  And I mean, I am the only Trump supporter in my neighborhood.
[02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:01.000]  And I asked my neighbors, would they hope Hillary,
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:04.240]  even if she's in diet, and they said yes, because, I mean,
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:07.240]  because they say the news says Trump is bad,
[02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:09.840]  and that's the only source that they get information from.
[02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:12.600]  So I don't think you're changing anything,
[02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:15.160]  but I think the ultimate way to get something changed
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:17.000]  is advertisement.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:18.640]  If he gives his stuff on the TV,
[02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:21.760]  I think that'll be the ultimate weapon towards Hillary Clinton.
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:22.600]  Well, you know, it's interesting.
[02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:24.800]  The narrative, it's interesting that you bring that up,
[02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:26.160]  because I was going to talk about that.
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:28.400]  For the last several days,
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:30.080]  we've seen this continuous narrative
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:31.600]  from the mainstream media.
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:33.120]  Trump just isn't a serious candidate,
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:34.800]  because he doesn't have all this money.
[02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:35.840]  Think about it.
[02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:38.960]  We've heard for the longest time from these very people,
[02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:40.680]  we've got to get money out of politics.
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:42.680]  It's corrupting the political process.
[02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:45.960]  George W. Bush bought the election, and it's true.
[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:47.040]  It's true.
[02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:48.520]  And the only way that you're going to do this
[02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:51.560]  is not with some kind of a phony control out of Washington.
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:53.480]  You got to get the power out of Washington.
[02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:55.520]  As long as you've got all this power in Washington,
[02:28:55.520 --> 02:28:59.080]  it is going to be a black hole drawing in money,
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:02.200]  because these people who contribute to these politicians
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:03.360]  like Hillary Clinton,
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:07.040]  can get thousands of percent return on their investment.
[02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:08.240]  They give them a little bit of money,
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:10.760]  and they get tremendous amount of leverage
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:12.160]  in crony capitalism.
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:13.520]  We just talked last night
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:15.600]  about this massive new rail system
[02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:17.840]  that is being rammed down the throats
[02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:19.720]  of people in rural Texas,
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:21.880]  going between Dallas and Houston.
[02:29:21.880 --> 02:29:24.160]  I mean, it is a prime example.
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:26.760]  It's the next level of crony capitalism.
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:28.200]  They keep taking it bigger and bigger
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:29.960]  with the Japanese company.
[02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:32.560]  But I think nobody gives Donald Trump credit
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:34.360]  for what he was able to do in the primaries.
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:35.840]  Certainly he is raising money now,
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:36.880]  and I think that's important.
[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:38.000]  It is an information war.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:38.840]  Stay with us.
[02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:39.880]  We're going to come back, take more of your calls.
[02:29:39.880 --> 02:29:41.200]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:43.520]  It doesn't matter if you want me right now,
[02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:48.520]  I'm just going to smile like you're hungry for dinner.
[02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:50.800]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:53.280]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.280 --> 02:29:56.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.840 --> 02:30:04.280]  Brexit D-Day looms with trillions of dollars at stake
[02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:07.200]  in decades of scheming to concentrate political power.
[02:30:07.200 --> 02:30:09.920]  The organized globalists are pulling out all the stops
[02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:12.960]  in a final desperate push to frighten British voters away
[02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:16.160]  from reclaiming sovereignty and control over their own lives,
[02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:18.800]  their own finances, and their own borders.
[02:30:18.800 --> 02:30:21.080]  It speaks volumes that Rothschild,
[02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:24.520]  Soros, Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase,
[02:30:24.520 --> 02:30:26.240]  BlackRock, the Carlisle Group,
[02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:29.160]  have been threatening apocalyptic level consequences
[02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:31.240]  if the UK leaves the EU.
[02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:34.200]  The movement to leave the EU was gaining steady momentum
[02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:36.520]  until the assassination of Joe Cox,
[02:30:36.520 --> 02:30:38.480]  the pro-remain member of parliament,
[02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:41.840]  who was brutally shot and stabbed to death on June 16th.
[02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:43.600]  Immediately as if on cue,
[02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:46.400]  the pro-globalist press exploited the tragedy
[02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:48.120]  to condemn the lead campaign.
[02:30:48.120 --> 02:30:50.160]  Will Britons reclaim their sovereignty
[02:30:50.160 --> 02:30:52.280]  and be in control of their own destiny?
[02:30:52.280 --> 02:30:55.680]  Find out Thursday on the June 23rd, Brexit referendum.
[02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:58.360]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo reporting for infowars.com.
[02:30:59.920 --> 02:31:01.680]  If you ever wanted a great deal
[02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:03.280]  on a powerful solar generator,
[02:31:03.280 --> 02:31:05.520]  but were waiting for an outrageously low price,
[02:31:05.520 --> 02:31:08.120]  you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:31:08.120 --> 02:31:08.960]  Here's why.
[02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:12.000]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems,
[02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000]  and it's getting worse, so please listen.
[02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000]  Solar generators really do provide
[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:17.720]  life-saving electrical power.
[02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:19.120]  And unlike gas generators,
[02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:20.840]  solar generators run silently,
[02:31:20.840 --> 02:31:22.320]  emit no fumes or gases,
[02:31:22.320 --> 02:31:24.120]  and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:25.880]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms,
[02:31:25.880 --> 02:31:28.440]  blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[02:31:28.440 --> 02:31:30.280]  you're not going to have to suffer through it
[02:31:30.280 --> 02:31:31.400]  like the rest of the sheep.
[02:31:31.400 --> 02:31:32.400]  And here's the best news
[02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:33.720]  if you want to get one this week.
[02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:37.560]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge
[02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:38.600]  solar generators,
[02:31:38.600 --> 02:31:41.280]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth
[02:31:41.280 --> 02:31:42.560]  of off-the-grid gear
[02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:45.280]  in addition to the low price for infowars listeners.

[02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:58.440]  Check it out for yourself today.
[02:33:00.560 --> 02:33:05.560]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:09.120 --> 02:33:12.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.920 --> 02:33:16.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:17.320]  I'm David Knight.
[02:33:17.320 --> 02:33:19.040]  Of course, we had Alex call in
[02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:20.960]  and talk about this massive speech
[02:33:20.960 --> 02:33:23.240]  that Donald Trump did earlier today.
[02:33:23.240 --> 02:33:25.200]  We're gonna have another couple of excerpts coming up here.
[02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:27.040]  We're gonna take your calls as well.
[02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:30.480]  The last caller who called in was talking about
[02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:32.200]  how important it is for Donald Trump
[02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:33.760]  to get out his message with commercials.
[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:36.080]  And I agree, but as I was saying,
[02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:38.680]  I think a lot of this narrative that we're seeing
[02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:40.680]  for the mainstream media has two parts to it.
[02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:42.520]  Number one, they're looking for anything
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:44.040]  that they can criticize Donald Trump on.
[02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:45.240]  They say, well, he hasn't raised money,
[02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:46.560]  therefore he's not a serious candidate.
[02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:49.840]  Seriously, seriously, look at the difference
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:51.880]  in the number of votes that Donald Trump
[02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:53.880]  has gotten versus any other Republican candidate.
[02:33:53.880 --> 02:33:55.560]  He's been able to bring people into the process
[02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:57.040]  that never voted before.
[02:33:57.040 --> 02:33:59.280]  He's had a record number of votes.
[02:33:59.280 --> 02:34:01.920]  Millions more people voted in the Republican primaries
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:04.680]  than ever before for any Republican candidate.
[02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:07.440]  That's serious, that's a serious candidate.
[02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:09.720]  And he did it with the least amount of money.
[02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:13.240]  Remember, we were all supposed to be in shock and awe
[02:34:13.240 --> 02:34:17.560]  of Jeb Bush's $150 million his war chest
[02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:21.880]  that he put together with Wall Street and foreign governments.
[02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:25.040]  And Donald Trump wiped the map
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:29.280]  with that $150 million shill, Jeb Bush.
[02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:32.080]  And I think he can do it with Hillary Clinton as well.
[02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:34.840]  But I think it's also very self-serving of the media
[02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:36.680]  because the mainstream media is very upset about this.
[02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:41.120]  This is a huge, huge source of income for these people.
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:45.200]  Now, if you remember back to the 2000 elections,
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:48.480]  George W. Bush was criticized for buying the election.
[02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:52.040]  He spent $200 million to get elected.
[02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:53.320]  That's nothing today.
[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:55.280]  You got Obama raising this up to a billion dollars.
[02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:59.640]  I mean, Hillary will easily spend over a billion dollars now.
[02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:04.440]  And that is a measure not of what a serious candidate is.
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:07.480]  That is not a measure of the number of people behind them.
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:12.360]  That is a measure of the corruption of Washington.
[02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:14.920]  Because it's only a few people who are giving that money.
[02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:17.080]  Only a few people who can give that kind of money.
[02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:19.600]  It is a measure of how out of control and
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:24.120]  unaccountable the crony capitalism has become in Washington DC.
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:27.960]  So it is no badge of honor to raise tens or
[02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:31.440]  hundreds of millions of dollars from Wall Street and foreign governments.
[02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:33.360]  And that's what Donald Trump was talking about today.
[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:34.680]  He called her out on that.
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:36.720]  He called her out on other crimes.
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:39.760]  And here's one of the, he's talked about Crooked Hillary.
[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:42.840]  He's talked about her being a world class liar today.
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:46.760]  And here he is talking about corrupt Hillary from today's press conference.
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:53.320]  Hillary Clinton gave China millions of jobs and our best jobs.
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:57.520]  And effectively let China completely rebuild itself.
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:01.160]  In return, Hillary Clinton got rich.
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:06.600]  The book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweitzer documents how Bill and
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:10.120]  Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family and
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:13.040]  America's and at America's expense.
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:16.760]  She gets rich making you poor.
[02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:27.400]  Here is a quote from the book.
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:31.960]  At the center of US policy towards China was Hillary Clinton.
[02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:35.760]  At this critical time for US-China relations,
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:40.080]  Bill Clinton gave her a number of speeches that were underwritten
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:43.240]  by the Chinese government and its supporters.
[02:36:43.240 --> 02:36:47.880]  These funds were paid to the Clinton's bank account directly,
[02:36:47.880 --> 02:36:53.600]  while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:55.120]  Tell me folks, does that work?
[02:36:56.720 --> 02:37:00.760]  She sold out our workers and our country for Beijing.
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:04.440]  Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:08.960]  Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our
[02:37:08.960 --> 02:37:14.000]  jobs overseas and give up congressional power to an international
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:15.680]  foreign commission.
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:20.560]  Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal,
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:22.960]  she's pretending that she's against it.
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:29.400]  She's given and deleted, as you know, and most people have heard about this.
[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:31.160]  Have we ever heard about her deleting anything?
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:32.120]  No, I don't think so.
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:37.000]  She deleted the entire record from her book.
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.720]  And deletion is something she really does know something about because she's
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:43.720]  deleted at least 30,000 emails.
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:46.240]  Which, by the way, shouldn't be able to be found.
[02:37:46.240 --> 02:37:47.480]  Yeah, he's absolutely right about that.
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:51.120]  She says she was supported of Trans-Pacific Partnership,
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:53.320]  the Trans-Atlantic Partnerships.
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:54.920]  Now she says she's against it.
[02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:57.800]  Look, Hillary Clinton's State Department pushed for
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:01.520]  the Keystone Pipeline harder than anybody in the Democrat Party did.
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:03.720]  Most of those in the Democrat Party didn't like it.
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:06.240]  They were worried about the environmental aspects of it.
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:10.080]  The Republican Party was supporting it because they wanted to get behind the oil
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:15.000]  industry, and it's a massive crony capitalism issue.
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:20.240]  It's a massive eminent domain issue, just like this railroad system that's going
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:22.840]  to be running from Dallas to Houston is.
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:27.360]  Giving a foreign corporation the right to come in and take your property.
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:32.160]  And that's why on so many of these issues, we see a net wash.
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:38.240]  We talked about how Donald Trump had used eminent domain, and yet all the Republican
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:42.040]  candidates want to give eminent domain to a foreign corporation.
[02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:46.360]  But what's important, where the real difference is, is that he understands that
[02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:50.960]  the Trans-Pacific Partnership is going to destroy our sovereignty, and
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:54.160]  it is going to destroy our prosperity.
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:55.600]  And we know that she's for this.
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:39:00.160]  We know that the Castro brothers, one of them that's being touted as one of the
[02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:09.920]  front-runners for her VP choices, his brother is touring Vietnam with Obama a week or
[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:14.320]  two ago and pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:17.680]  There's absolutely no doubt that Hillary is going to push this through these
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:19.760]  globalist trade partnerships.
[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:22.720]  There's absolutely no doubt that she's going to push that through, and he was absolutely
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:24.280]  right to oppose her on it.
[02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:26.160]  It is a key difference.
[02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:31.680]  This election, again, is about globalism versus nationalism.
[02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:37.200]  And whether or not you agree with Donald Trump on the individual liberty issues, there isn't
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:41.400]  a difference between him and the Democrats or anybody else is running on the Republican
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:43.000]  side.
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:49.520]  The issue, and the only choice that we have here, is on the issue of globalism versus
[02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:54.640]  nationalism, on these trade treaties, on these open borders issues.
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:58.640]  And that's where the Republican establishment and the Democrat establishment are joined
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:01.920]  at the hip, and that is the difference with Donald Trump.
[02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:02.920]  That is the key issue.
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:04.360]  Let's talk to Rich in New Jersey.
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:05.360]  Rich, your comments.
[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:06.360]  Hey, David.
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:07.360]  How are you doing?
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:11.040]  I just had a question for you.
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:13.680]  I want to see if this is a viable thing.
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:22.000]  I know in the 40s, UBC Bank, which was the Prescott Bush and Herbert Walker were investing
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:28.440]  money for a guy named Thyssen, and they broke that bank up under the Doing Business with
[02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:29.440]  the Enemy Act.
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:36.160]  Now, if Saudi Arabia, since the war on terrorism is a war, if they're convicted or seem to
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:42.160]  be the ones jockeying 9-11, wouldn't it be possible to seize Hillary Clinton's finances
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:45.920]  and all her money based on the same principle?
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:48.760]  If we were a just country, yes, of course it would be.
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:53.600]  The question is, is Hillary even going to be indicted by our government?
[02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:54.600]  That's a true issue.
[02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:56.600]  I mean, you're talking about breaking banks up.
[02:40:56.600 --> 02:41:06.640]  We've seen UBC and HSBC convicted repeatedly for money laundering of drug cartels and terrorists.
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:08.440]  They even gave the Sinaloa cartel.
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:13.720]  Everybody talked about El Chapo escaping and everything, well, HSBC gave him his own personal
[02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:16.120]  window where they had laundered money for him.
[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:17.120]  What did they get?
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:18.240]  They got a slap on the wrist.
[02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:19.760]  Nothing happened to them.
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:22.640]  And it was the Obama administration that said, hey, they're too big to jail.
[02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:24.680]  Remember Eric Holder saying that essentially?
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:28.680]  That was the summary of what he had to say, and it's absolutely true.
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:29.920]  That was their attitude.
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:34.040]  It doesn't do any good for us to lock up any of these bankers, and we don't want to revoke
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:35.040]  their charter.
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:39.120]  They wouldn't do anything to the people that were rigging the LIBOR exchange, the London
[02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:44.480]  Interbank rates that everybody's home mortgage rates, especially if you've got a variable
[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:45.480]  rate mortgage.
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:46.760]  It's all based on the LIBOR exchange.
[02:41:46.760 --> 02:41:49.680]  These people were making billions rigging this market.
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:54.200]  So we've got all these bankers who are caught in all this criminal operation, and they keep
[02:41:54.200 --> 02:41:55.200]  getting away with it.
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:42:00.000]  So I think the most that we're going to be able to hope for out of this is an indictment
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:01.000]  of Hillary Clinton.
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:04.040]  I don't think we're going to get a conviction, and I don't think an indictment is going to
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:05.920]  make any difference to the people who support her.
[02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:08.920]  As the earlier caller said, he said, I talked to people about Hillary Clinton, and they
[02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:09.920]  don't really care.
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:16.560]  They don't really care that she violated the religion of the police state, national security.
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:19.680]  I mean, this is a person who committed sacrilege.
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:25.680]  It's like slaughtering a child on the altar or something, what she did with the emails,
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:27.600]  and yet she's going to get a pass.
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:32.280]  And they're taking all of our freedoms for this national security state, and yet they're
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:34.200]  going to give Hillary Clinton a pass.
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:37.760]  So I don't really think they're going to do anything about it, do you?
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:42.160]  No, when you put it that way, unfortunately, I think you're right.
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:43.960]  It just seems we've fallen so far.
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:45.480]  But that would be a violation.
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:49.440]  It would be if this was the country that it's supposed to be.
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:53.120]  We would be able to do that because if you have the Saudis bragging how much money they
[02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:56.560]  gave her, it's clearly out in the open, too.
[02:42:56.560 --> 02:42:57.560]  It's just amazing.
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:42:58.560]  It's just amazing.
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:04.600]  Well, I honestly think that this is going to be a key election because there's a lot
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:05.600]  in it.
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:08.760]  Hillary Clinton is the kind of person who is going to take reprisals against Donald
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:09.760]  Trump.
[02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:10.760]  You can bet on it.
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:12.960]  And he's not afraid to personally attackers we saw today.
[02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:14.160]  We knew this was going to happen.
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:18.760]  We knew that Donald Trump was not going to pull any punches like these other politicians
[02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:19.760]  did.
[02:43:19.760 --> 02:43:23.080]  And he has called these people on their globalist schemes, and he has exposed it.
[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:26.680]  I mean, he's talked about the issues with vaccines and autism.
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:29.760]  He's talked about a lot of these different issues that other people wouldn't talk about.
[02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:31.920]  He talked about the 28 pages.
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:38.200]  We had people who were on the official conspiracy theory group, the 9-11 Commission.
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:42.600]  They talked about Saudi Arabia's connection and the original report that they put together.
[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:47.640]  And yet, it got redacted, and you got these people who were ahead of the Senate Intelligence
[02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:49.960]  Committee who for 15 years are trying to get this exposed.
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:53.240]  They couldn't get any traction on it at all until Donald Trump brought it up.
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:59.080]  So he's going to come out and he's going to come out and not hold back on any of this
[02:43:59.080 --> 02:44:00.080]  stuff.
[02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:05.760]  And so I think it's very clear that if Donald Trump wins the election, there will probably
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:09.840]  be a criminal prosecution of Hillary Clinton or some of these other people.
[02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:11.840]  I think he will do something like that.
[02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:14.720]  And so for her, her back is against the wall.
[02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:16.360]  It's the White House or the Big House.
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:18.440]  For him, his back is also against the wall.
[02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:19.880]  He's in this now.
[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:20.880]  He's in this.
[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:26.240]  The establishment is going to come after him with all their barrels loaded if he doesn't
[02:44:26.240 --> 02:44:27.240]  win.
[02:44:27.240 --> 02:44:28.960]  So this is really a do or die.
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:33.800]  They say if you come after the king, you better get him because you don't get a second chance.
[02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:38.000]  So they both got a lot on the line here in this thing.
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:41.600]  So it's going to be a very, very difficult, very important election.
[02:44:41.600 --> 02:44:45.600]  I want to go to Matt in Oklahoma, but before we do, I just want to remind you again that
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:47.800]  we've extended the Temp Kennedy Special.
[02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:49.400]  This is the last day.
[02:44:49.400 --> 02:44:50.920]  We've extended it one more day.
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:57.680]  That's 15% off of the products that Tim Kennedy tells us he found most effective in his training
[02:44:57.680 --> 02:45:00.520]  for UFC as well as Special Forces.
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:06.360]  He trains intensively and he said, when I use Supermail Vitality, Brainforce, Secret
[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:09.480]  12, I can really, really feel a difference.
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:12.000]  He mentioned that to Alex Jones and said, Alex, put together a special.
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:13.640]  All right, we'll put those three out there.
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:20.640]  So often people give them an opportunity to try these products at 15% off, see if they
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:22.840]  do for them what they did for Temp Kennedy.
[02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:27.280]  And of course, you can read hundreds of five-star reviews at infowarslife.com, people talking
[02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:32.200]  about the effect that these products have had, positive effect on them and their life.
[02:45:32.200 --> 02:45:33.200]  And we're offering that to you.
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:35.000]  We extended that for one more day.
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:39.160]  Supermail Vitality, Brainforce, Secret 12, 15% off.
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:43.080]  That's the Temp Kennedy Special at infowarslife.com.
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:45.360]  Now let's go back to Matt in Oklahoma.
[02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:47.600]  Matt, you wanted to make a comment about Trump's speech today.
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:48.600]  Go ahead.
[02:45:48.600 --> 02:45:49.600]  I did.
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:50.600]  Hey, Dave.
[02:45:50.600 --> 02:45:52.600]  Long time listener, daily watcher.
[02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:56.840]  I've also been like you of kind of, you know, was on the fence about Trump.
[02:45:56.840 --> 02:45:59.600]  You know, at the first year, if I came forward and said, hey, you're going to like Trump
[02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:00.600]  at the end of the year.
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:01.600]  There's no way I would have believed that.
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:03.080]  I'm sure you probably felt the same way.
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:04.080]  That's right.
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:05.080]  Let me get to the points here.
[02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:06.080]  Okay.
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:10.960]  So like you said, it's globalism versus nationalism, which at its core is the individual under
[02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:12.680]  attack versus the collective.
[02:46:12.680 --> 02:46:13.680]  Yes.
[02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:17.720]  And what caused that was like you said, NAFTA, NAFTA was the coffin.
[02:46:17.720 --> 02:46:21.840]  The TPP will be the lid they want to nail down on top of America.
[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:25.920]  Now we want to blame the corporations because they're the ones that, you know, buy out all
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:26.920]  the politicians.
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:31.160]  They buy the left and the right and rig the game before the plays are made on the field
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:32.800]  and they already know the outcome.
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:36.600]  But then the people in the stands can say, that guy on the other side, I hate him because
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:37.600]  he likes this guy.
[02:46:37.600 --> 02:46:38.600]  Well, I like that guy.
[02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:42.000]  Now they're arguing about the game and they don't understand who fixed the game before
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:43.000]  the election.
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:48.000]  But it goes higher than that because at the top of this pyramid is the Federal Reserve.
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.240]  We used to be a free nation in the 1913.
[02:46:50.240 --> 02:46:53.040]  We were taken over by foreign bankers.
[02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:55.080]  And since then we've not been free.
[02:46:55.080 --> 02:46:58.920]  And in fact, to call the left and the right parties is actually incorrect.
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:03.120]  It should be the Democratic corporation and the Republic corporation.
[02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:08.680]  But what gets us in this direction is, you know, I was trying to explain this to my brother
[02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:11.520]  last night and he doesn't understand a lot of these things and he actually came up with
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:16.120]  a great analogy I wanted to share was, you know, the concept of trade is, you know, you
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:20.680]  used to have a gold coin, you'd go get an IOU note from the bank and you could go get
[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:22.880]  that gold coin back by giving them the paper back.
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:27.680]  But what happens if they took that, you know, current, that piece of paper and then made
[02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:28.680]  a photocopy of it?
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:32.320]  Then they took the photocopy and put that on top of the photocopy machine and made another
[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:37.600]  copy and kept taking the copy of the copy and copying it over and over and over.
[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:40.040]  And now you have an explanation for the value of our currency.
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:42.920]  That'd be called quantitative easing, wouldn't it?
[02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:44.920]  Yeah, indeed.
[02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:45.920]  Exactly.
[02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:47.640]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:50.560]  And you know, one of the things people need to understand too, when we talk about this
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:54.680]  and we talk about the economic consequences, I think a lot of people don't realize that
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:56.680]  it was a package deal.
[02:47:56.680 --> 02:48:01.040]  When they created the Federal Reserve and they gave them control, they also created
[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:02.920]  the income tax.
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:08.600]  And they created the income tax at the same time they started opening up and lowering
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:11.840]  tariffs, opening up our trade, calling it free trade, okay?
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:16.840]  So before that, if we go all the way back to Thomas Jefferson, we had a situation where
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:20.400]  Thomas Jefferson bragged at the beginning of his second administration.
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:23.840]  He said, we have eliminated all internal taxation.
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:29.000]  He says, what person in America, what farmer, laborer, mechanic knows a tax man, none of
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:30.360]  them know a tax man.
[02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:33.400]  We support the government, and it was a small government.
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:35.240]  It was a constitutional-sized government.
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:42.240]  We support the government strictly based on tariffs, on money coming into the country.
[02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:43.560]  And what did that do for us?
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:48.200]  Okay, that gave us a strong, internal, self-sufficient government.
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:53.080]  And what they did when they enacted, they did exactly the opposite thing.
[02:48:53.080 --> 02:48:57.520]  When they put together the income tax, created the Federal Reserve as all scheme of the bankers,
[02:48:57.520 --> 02:49:00.720]  and then opened up trade for us.
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:03.960]  They took down the trade barriers, they took down the tariffs, but then they put internal
[02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:06.040]  taxes on us.
[02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:10.000]  And where at this extent right now, where as Donald Trump was pointing out, and he was
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:14.320]  being mocked in the debates by Marco Rubio, who wouldn't let him finish the sentence,
[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:17.840]  Donald Trump kept saying, hey, they've got all these lines that they've drawn, they won't
[02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:21.680]  let competition for insurance companies go from state to state.
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:24.840]  And Marco Rubio goes, lines, lines, he's talking about lines.
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:29.840]  He was talking about the fact that we don't even have free trade in health insurance in
[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:31.320]  America.
[02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:32.880]  That's how they have locked us down.
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:37.720]  That's what the crony capitalists, the banking companies, the insurance companies have done.
[02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:40.880]  They have destroyed free trade within our country.
[02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:41.880]  And yet they have opened it up.
[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:42.880]  Why have they opened it up?
[02:49:42.880 --> 02:49:45.960]  Because they want to export jobs, they want to import workers.
[02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:50.360]  And so we need to understand that having tariffs is not the end of the world.
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:57.080]  We hear this narrative that what created the Great Depression was tariffs at the borders.
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:49:58.520]  That's not true.
[02:49:58.520 --> 02:50:04.800]  And we even see the fearmongering coming from George Soros saying, hey, once before I got
[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:09.760]  a hold of your currency and I dropped the pound 20% in a day.
[02:50:09.760 --> 02:50:13.840]  And I looked at that and I thought, well, that's not really a bad thing, is it?
[02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:20.440]  Because one of the key advantages of China is their trade, their currency manipulation
[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:21.440]  and what do they do?
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:28.480]  They try to manipulate it to make their currency have an advantage trading with other people.
[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:31.760]  And so if that were to happen, Britain would have an advantage.
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:36.200]  As a matter of fact, Japan's Abe is doing the same thing.
[02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:40.560]  They call it Abe-nomics and he's trying to do the same sort of thing which George Soros
[02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:43.720]  said he would do to the UK if they get out as a punishment.
[02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:46.440]  I would say, hey, bring it on.
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:52.560]  That's only going to make exports more affordable coming out of Britain as well as building
[02:50:52.560 --> 02:50:55.000]  an independence and an economy within their country.
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:56.000]  Stay with us.
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:03.000]  We'll be back with more of your calls.
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:32.880]  Are you worried about how dangerous the world has become?
[02:51:32.880 --> 02:51:37.520]  In these days of terrorist attacks, natural disasters or even a future collapse, you need
[02:51:37.520 --> 02:51:40.000]  to be medically prepared to keep your family safe.
[02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:45.360]  I'm Joe Alton, MD of store.doomenbloom.net where you'll find an entire line of uniquely

[02:52:05.800 --> 02:52:06.800]  Silver Bullet.
[02:52:06.800 --> 02:52:07.800]  I use them all.
[02:52:07.800 --> 02:52:08.800]  They're phenomenal.
[02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:09.800]  They work.
[02:52:09.800 --> 02:52:10.800]  Buy them, folks.
[02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:11.800]  Thank you, brother.
[02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:12.800]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[02:52:12.800 --> 02:52:17.920]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:18.920]  products.
[02:52:18.920 --> 02:52:20.400]  Welcome to the Info War.
[02:52:20.400 --> 02:52:25.280]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War
[02:52:25.280 --> 02:52:26.280]  at the same time.
[02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:27.280]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:30.280]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Opio FX, Nacin, Opi Dye.
[02:52:30.280 --> 02:52:31.280]  Right.
[02:52:31.280 --> 02:52:32.280]  That lady has a question.
[02:52:32.280 --> 02:52:33.280]  Have they worked for you?
[02:52:33.280 --> 02:52:35.880]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[02:52:35.880 --> 02:52:36.880]  What products are you taking?
[02:52:36.880 --> 02:52:37.880]  Are you taking?
[02:52:37.880 --> 02:52:45.200]  Everything from SuperMail to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:48.920]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[02:52:48.920 --> 02:52:53.920]  This is infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[02:52:53.920 --> 02:52:59.640]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:00.640]  Think about this.
[02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:04.720]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated
[02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:09.880]  with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramides,
[02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:12.640]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[02:53:12.640 --> 02:53:17.720]  They know water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:21.240]  Your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey water filter.
[02:53:21.240 --> 02:53:27.120]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show Big Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals,
[02:53:27.120 --> 02:53:32.280]  BPA, pesticides, bacteria, and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[02:53:32.280 --> 02:53:35.840]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:40.440]  The gold standard in water purification and our filters last for years at less than two
[02:53:40.440 --> 02:53:41.640]  cents per gallon.
[02:53:41.640 --> 02:53:45.480]  Big Berkey, the one powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[02:53:45.480 --> 02:53:51.600]  Visit your Big Berkey today, call 1-877-99 Berkey or click BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[02:53:51.600 --> 02:53:58.800]  That's 1-877-99 BERKEY, Big Berkey Water Filters, for the love of clean water.
[02:53:58.800 --> 02:54:11.040]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:12.040]  I'm David Knight.
[02:54:12.040 --> 02:54:15.440]  We're going to go back to your calls about Donald Trump's speech day in just one moment.
[02:54:15.440 --> 02:54:18.120]  Real quickly, I want to break down all these specials we've extended.
[02:54:18.120 --> 02:54:23.400]  Again, as I mentioned, the Tim Kennedy special, 15% off Supermail Vitality, BrainForce, and
[02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:27.440]  Secret12 at InfowarsLife.com, also 20% off Deep Cleanse.
[02:54:27.440 --> 02:54:29.180]  That's the new special that came out today.
[02:54:29.180 --> 02:54:33.320]  We still have the Alexa Pure water filters, 20% off all of the water filters from the
[02:54:33.320 --> 02:54:36.120]  largest system down to the shower filter.
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:40.400]  That's 20% off all Alexa Pure water filters at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:42.680]  And then there's the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:46.760]  The t-shirt that sent Slate into fits.
[02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:52.320]  They wrote an entire article about a lady that they saw at the rally last Saturday who
[02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:57.880]  had been an Obama voter and she's wearing a Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[02:54:57.880 --> 02:55:02.600]  They flipped out and wrote an entire article about this and said, oh, I can't believe this.
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:06.600]  The right wing believes that Hillary is a crook.
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:07.600]  Imagine that.
[02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:12.400]  And so Donald Trump defined that today for us as to why she is a crook.
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:19.160]  But that Hillary for Prison t-shirt, you can get for 50% off the first t-shirt, 75% off
[02:55:19.160 --> 02:55:21.720]  for the second t-shirt.
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:24.760]  Send Slate and other people into hissy fits.
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:27.120]  Get your Hillary for Prison t-shirt now.
[02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:30.600]  It's a great time to get a huge discount off the Hillary for Prison.
[02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:33.360]  50% off the first one, 75% off the second one.
[02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:35.160]  All right, let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:36.160]  Stephen in Ohio.
[02:55:36.160 --> 02:55:37.160]  Stephen, go ahead.
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:38.160]  Hey there, David.
[02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:41.760]  I'm a longtime listener, first time caller.
[02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:42.760]  Thank you.
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:49.320]  I just wanted to talk about what I believe is going to happen here in the near future
[02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:59.640]  regarding the election and having to do with all these shootings and things, trying to
[02:55:59.640 --> 02:56:02.360]  restrict the Second Amendment and things.
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:11.680]  And also, I think that the shadow government, the Illuminati, the Bilderberg groups, whoever
[02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:16.560]  you are calling the New World Order of the Globalists, will do anything that they can
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:23.840]  to prevent Donald Trump from winning the presidency, whether that has to do with, um, assassination
[02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:24.840]  or...
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:25.840]  I agree.
[02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:26.840]  We saw that in the Brexit vote.
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:27.840]  I absolutely agree.
[02:56:27.840 --> 02:56:28.840]  They'll pull out all the strings.
[02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:32.040]  And that's one of the reasons why I really have come around to supporting Donald Trump,
[02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:33.040]  as I said.
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:37.680]  It's about globalism versus nationalism, and that is a key issue for individual liberty.
[02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:42.320]  And it is also the fact that we see how much the establishment of both the Democrats and
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:43.320]  Republicans hate him.
[02:56:43.320 --> 02:56:45.440]  I mean, that is a badge of honor, isn't it?
[02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:46.960]  Yes, it is.
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:47.960]  And you know what?
[02:56:47.960 --> 02:56:49.880]  The reason why they're doing all of this?
[02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:55.240]  The reason why, you know, with the 9-11 false flag attacks, all these false flag shootings
[02:56:55.240 --> 02:57:01.120]  and stuff, calling for restrictions, take away the guns and everything, it's because
[02:57:01.120 --> 02:57:02.120]  they're scared.
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:03.120]  They're afraid.
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:07.640]  They know that we know the truth, and they're afraid that we're going to rise up against
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:08.640]  them.
[02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:14.480]  And I think that the Federal Reserve, the globalists, the big bankers and all of that,
[02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:21.080]  I think that they are going to implode the economy and causing upset and discord across
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:23.080]  the entire U.S.
[02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:28.040]  And I think they're going to use this orchestrated plot to invoke martial law and suspend the
[02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:29.040]  elections.
[02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:34.280]  So I can tell you that if they get these trade agreements together, they don't really even
[02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:36.560]  need martial law to take our economy down.
[02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:39.520]  Because they will have the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Trans-Atlantic Partnership.
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:44.480]  They will be able to manage our economy, the world economy, not only ours, but Europe and
[02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:46.000]  all these Asian nations.
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:51.340]  They will be able to manage those economies without any input from the people.
[02:57:51.340 --> 02:57:56.160]  These are trade agreements that were written in secret by these multinational corporations.
[02:57:56.160 --> 02:58:00.280]  It will establish a committee that is unanswerable to us.
[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:05.120]  And it will be a tyranny that we will not be able to get out of without having a war.
[02:58:05.120 --> 02:58:06.120]  And that's for certain.
[02:58:06.120 --> 02:58:08.200]  That's why this is such a key election.
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:12.480]  That's why this issue of nationalism versus globalism is so important, and Donald Trump
[02:58:12.480 --> 02:58:14.440]  is the only one to oppose it.
[02:58:14.440 --> 02:58:15.440]  Hang on with your calls.
[02:58:15.440 --> 02:58:18.120]  We'll take some more calls as we come back in the first five minutes.
[02:58:18.120 --> 02:58:26.120]  We're going to have Rob Dew talking to someone who was a Venezuelan protestor who exposed
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:30.680]  what was going on in Venezuela and has a lot to say about what happened in the U.K.
[02:58:30.680 --> 02:58:32.800]  with Muslims there as he immigrated from Venezuela.
[02:58:32.800 --> 02:58:34.440]  Stay with us for the fourth hour.
[02:58:34.440 --> 02:58:35.440]  And Rob Dew as well.
[02:58:35.440 --> 02:58:36.440]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:36.440 --> 02:58:50.160]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:50.160 --> 02:58:54.920]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but were waiting for an outrageously
[02:58:54.920 --> 02:58:58.440]  low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:58:58.440 --> 02:58:59.440]  Here's why.
[02:58:59.440 --> 02:59:03.320]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse.
[02:59:03.320 --> 02:59:04.320]  So please listen.
[02:59:04.320 --> 02:59:09.520]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power, and unlike gas generators,
[02:59:09.520 --> 02:59:13.760]  solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the
[02:59:13.760 --> 02:59:14.760]  sun.
[02:59:14.760 --> 02:59:19.240]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[02:59:19.240 --> 02:59:21.640]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[02:59:21.640 --> 02:59:24.320]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:59:24.320 --> 02:59:28.920]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators, and they're
[02:59:28.920 --> 02:59:33.440]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low
[02:59:33.440 --> 02:59:37.240]  price for M4Wars listeners, so it's a good time to check it out.
[02:59:37.240 --> 02:59:40.680]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[02:59:40.680 --> 02:59:44.520]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[02:59:44.520 --> 02:59:52.640]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[02:59:52.640 --> 03:00:03.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:03.720 --> 03:00:06.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:06.720 --> 03:00:13.080]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:14.960]  Rob Dew is going to be joining us in the next segment.
[03:00:14.960 --> 03:00:16.960]  He's going to be hosting the rest of the hour.
[03:00:16.960 --> 03:00:20.960]  He's going to be talking to someone who is added to the cyberterrorism list in Venezuela,
[03:00:20.960 --> 03:00:26.360]  who eventually got out of there, immigrated to the U.K. and has much to say about the
[03:00:26.360 --> 03:00:33.000]  effects of mass migration and what happened to him in the U.K. with the Muslims that were
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:34.640]  coming into the U.K.
[03:00:34.640 --> 03:00:38.080]  So he's going to be interviewing that person in the fourth hour.
[03:00:38.080 --> 03:00:40.200]  I want to try to get through as many of these calls as we can.
[03:00:40.200 --> 03:00:42.280]  Let's go to John in Oklahoma.
[03:00:42.280 --> 03:00:43.280]  John, go ahead.
[03:00:43.280 --> 03:00:51.880]  Yes, I know that a lot of this Donald Trump is looking at getting from sort of a top-down
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:58.240]  perspective, but I'd like to see you get Sheriff Mack back on.
[03:00:58.240 --> 03:01:00.440]  That's sort of from a bottom-up perspective.
[03:01:00.440 --> 03:01:05.760]  I have some doubts if we can fix this thing from the top down.
[03:01:05.760 --> 03:01:06.760]  Well, I agree.
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:07.760]  Absolutely.
[03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:08.760]  Bottom-up.
[03:01:08.760 --> 03:01:13.240]  And I've said throughout this campaign, when you look at individual liberty, I've
[03:01:13.240 --> 03:01:16.280]  said I don't see anybody offering that running at the top.
[03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:22.200]  And so I think it's very important for us to keep liberty from getting even more difficult
[03:01:22.200 --> 03:01:23.200]  for us.
[03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:28.840]  Look, if we lose our country, if we lose even the lip service to the Constitution, we really
[03:01:28.840 --> 03:01:30.960]  are messed up, okay, at that point.
[03:01:30.960 --> 03:01:34.960]  But I agree that the fight for individual liberty is going to be won at the local level.
[03:01:34.960 --> 03:01:38.560]  And I think it's really important to elect the right people as sheriffs.
[03:01:38.560 --> 03:01:40.160]  They have a tremendous amount of power.
[03:01:40.160 --> 03:01:43.120]  If you get the right sheriff in there, they can do a tremendous amount.
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:46.680]  Sheriff Mack, shut down the Brady Bill, and as we're looking at gun control coming back
[03:01:46.680 --> 03:01:49.640]  now, understand that it was the NRA.
[03:01:49.640 --> 03:01:50.640]  It was Ronald Reagan.
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:51.640]  It was George Bush.
[03:01:51.640 --> 03:01:52.640]  It was Bill Clinton.
[03:01:52.640 --> 03:01:56.440]  All of them pushed through the Brady Bill, and it was Sheriff Mack, a local sheriff in
[03:01:56.440 --> 03:01:59.440]  conjunction with other sheriffs who took it to the Supreme Court and said, no, we're
[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:00.440]  not going to do that.
[03:02:00.440 --> 03:02:03.000]  We're going to shut that down, even over the NRA.
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:07.280]  So it's very important to get good people at the local level to stand with you and to
[03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:08.640]  stand up for their rights.
[03:02:08.640 --> 03:02:09.760]  Look, we have a Constitution.
[03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:15.000]  We know that they don't obey this Constitution they take an oath to, but they appeal to it
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:16.720]  for their authority.
[03:02:16.720 --> 03:02:22.080]  And we can point to that and say, if you deny this document that you take an oath to, when
[03:02:22.080 --> 03:02:25.040]  you take your office, then you don't have any legitimate authority.
[03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:26.640]  So I absolutely agree with you, John.
[03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:29.200]  We need to get very involved at the local level.
[03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:31.640]  It's hard for us to do that as a national organization.
[03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:35.800]  We pull people in occasionally to talk about that, but that's something that each of you
[03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:40.760]  has to do most of your research on your own to find out what's going on, who the individuals
[03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:42.160]  are in your area that can help you.
[03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:45.840]  We can do that to limited extent, but it's difficult for us to do that because we have
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:50.560]  a national and an international broadcast, but that is really, I think, where the rubber
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:52.800]  is going to meet the road and individual liberty.
[03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:53.800]  Thank you, John.
[03:02:53.800 --> 03:02:55.120]  Let's go quickly to Margaret in Oklahoma.
[03:02:55.120 --> 03:02:56.120]  Go ahead, Margaret.
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:02:57.120]  Hello.
[03:02:57.120 --> 03:02:58.120]  Hey, you're on.
[03:02:58.120 --> 03:02:59.120]  Go ahead.
[03:02:59.120 --> 03:03:00.120]  Hello.
[03:03:00.120 --> 03:03:05.480]  I think that President Trump is going to have his hands full, rooting out corruption
[03:03:05.480 --> 03:03:08.600]  in our corrupt justice system.
[03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:16.000]  There's a young man in Alaska that the FBI was trying to get him to agree to a plot to
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.600]  murder people, and he said no.
[03:03:18.600 --> 03:03:19.600]  And this is Shaefer Cox.
[03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:20.600]  And he said no.
[03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:21.880]  And it's on tape that he said no.
[03:03:21.880 --> 03:03:26.920]  And the FBI, the jury was not allowed to hear that he said no, and they were not allowed
[03:03:26.920 --> 03:03:29.120]  to hear that it was the FBI plot.
[03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:31.480]  And so they sent him to prison for 26 years.
[03:03:31.480 --> 03:03:32.480]  Yeah.
[03:03:32.480 --> 03:03:33.480]  That was five years ago.
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:34.480]  We've seen that a lot.
[03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:40.280]  And again, I think that is not something that a President Trump is going to do, quite honestly.
[03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:44.280]  We're going to have to reclaim the understanding of jury nullification.
[03:03:44.280 --> 03:03:45.480]  And we're going to have to get that back.
[03:03:45.480 --> 03:03:47.400]  And it's, boy, it's a catch-22.
[03:03:47.400 --> 03:03:53.440]  Because so many people have lost the idea of juries that they will plea bargain, the
[03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:58.280]  tactic that the government uses, besides using false informants and tricking people
[03:03:58.280 --> 03:03:59.400]  and then trapping them.
[03:03:59.400 --> 03:04:05.360]  They also bring up all kinds of bogus charges, hoping that you'll plead to one other charge.
[03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:10.000]  So they give you a whole slew of charges, say, well, we'll take away some of these bogus
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:11.960]  charges, but you plead guilty to this.
[03:04:11.960 --> 03:04:13.960]  And most people will take that deal.
[03:04:13.960 --> 03:04:18.400]  And we've talked to individuals, we talked to the New Jersey weed man, who had to represent
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:23.680]  himself because most lawyers will not argue for jury nullification, even though it is
[03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:28.720]  in most state constitutions, even though it is a principle that our country was founded
[03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:33.000]  upon, a principle that was even established back in English common law.
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.920]  Those types of things, we're going to have to take that back at the local level.
[03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:37.160]  It's going to be sheriffs.
[03:04:37.160 --> 03:04:39.160]  It's going to be informed juries.
[03:04:39.160 --> 03:04:42.480]  It's going to take some hard groundwork at the grassroots level.
[03:04:42.480 --> 03:04:45.800]  We're not going to be able to elect a savior that's going to take care of this.
[03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:47.280]  He's going to have too many things on his plate.
[03:04:47.280 --> 03:04:51.960]  But what he can do is he can take care of things where we are losing our sovereignty
[03:04:51.960 --> 03:04:53.840]  at the national and international level.
[03:04:53.840 --> 03:04:54.840]  Stay with us.
[03:04:54.840 --> 03:05:00.880]  We'll see you right back with this person who was persecuted in Venezuela.
[03:05:00.880 --> 03:05:05.200]  Federal investigators are trying to find out more specifically what Omar Mateen's wife
[03:05:05.200 --> 03:05:08.560]  knew about the planned attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.
[03:05:08.560 --> 03:05:11.760]  There's just one problem, nor Saman is missing.
[03:05:11.760 --> 03:05:15.840]  The Sun Sentinel conducted an interview with Siddiq Mateen, the shooter's father, in which
[03:05:15.840 --> 03:05:18.680]  he has heard saying that Saman was not around here.
[03:05:18.680 --> 03:05:21.120]  I don't know where she is, but she's not here.
[03:05:21.120 --> 03:05:26.400]  First disturbing of all, according to breaking 911 citing CNN, U.S. Attorney General Loretta
[03:05:26.400 --> 03:05:30.160]  Lynch says that she doesn't know if Saman has left the state or not.
[03:05:30.160 --> 03:05:35.760]  How it's possible that nor Saman has given federal authorities the slip is beyond comprehension.
[03:05:35.760 --> 03:05:37.240]  So let me get this straight.
[03:05:37.240 --> 03:05:42.600]  Federal authorities are continually bypassing the Constitution in violation of our rights
[03:05:42.600 --> 03:05:48.240]  so that in the name of terrorism, they can conduct unconstitutional and completely useless
[03:05:48.240 --> 03:05:49.240]  spying.
[03:05:49.240 --> 03:05:52.040]  But perhaps the department just needs more funding.
[03:05:52.040 --> 03:05:53.640]  That always seems to do the trick.

[03:06:59.720 --> 03:07:03.960]  Secret 12, Info Wars Life's Vitamin B12 Formulation.
[03:07:03.960 --> 03:07:09.240]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[03:07:09.240 --> 03:07:10.240]  by the body.
[03:07:10.240 --> 03:07:15.080]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are
[03:07:15.080 --> 03:07:17.320]  known to have higher absorption rates.
[03:07:17.320 --> 03:07:22.480]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful
[03:07:22.480 --> 03:07:26.680]  form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[03:07:26.680 --> 03:07:33.400]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimental grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin,
[03:07:33.400 --> 03:07:37.640]  the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[03:07:37.640 --> 03:07:41.000]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.080]  No needles, no injections.
[03:07:43.080 --> 03:07:44.640]  Don't take my word for it.
[03:07:44.640 --> 03:07:46.080]  Try it for yourself.
[03:07:46.080 --> 03:07:47.240]  Discover the secret.
[03:07:47.240 --> 03:07:48.240]  Secret 12.

[03:08:27.240 --> 03:08:29.560]  Welcome, welcome to the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:08:29.560 --> 03:08:32.240]  This is Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:08:32.240 --> 03:08:37.240]  I'm the news director at PrismPlanet.tv, and it's always my pleasure to bring you the
[03:08:37.240 --> 03:08:42.800]  latest news and analysis here in the fourth hour, and hats off to David Knight for taking
[03:08:42.800 --> 03:08:47.760]  over and sitting in for Alex Jones, who's getting a well-deserved vacation, even though
[03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:52.400]  he's still, I guess there's just too much news for him to stay silent.
[03:08:52.400 --> 03:08:54.000]  He's still filing reports.
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:55.920]  He was talking to me earlier.
[03:08:55.920 --> 03:08:59.280]  We had videos that were thrown around, putting stuff up.
[03:08:59.280 --> 03:09:03.600]  It's wild and crazy here at the InfoWars Central Texas Command Center.
[03:09:03.600 --> 03:09:10.720]  I want to go over a couple articles here, just some basic stuff that's going on InfoWars,
[03:09:10.720 --> 03:09:13.120]  and also talk about a guest I have coming up.
[03:09:13.120 --> 03:09:18.080]  Back on June 9th, we posted an article called, This Video Will Get Donald Trump Elected If
[03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:19.560]  It Goes Viral.
[03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:26.320]  That was produced by one John Aquaviva, who is a Venezuelan who now lives in England,
[03:09:26.320 --> 03:09:27.320]  and he produces videos.
[03:09:27.320 --> 03:09:32.680]  It's got 1.5 million views right now, and it's just basically clips of Donald Trump talking
[03:09:32.680 --> 03:09:39.280]  on the Ronna Barrett show, Oprah Winfrey at the GOP convention, C-SPAN, CNN interview,
[03:09:39.280 --> 03:09:41.280]  Larry King Live, Steve Forbes.
[03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:46.440]  Just all these events in the past leading up to where he is now and kind of laying the
[03:09:46.440 --> 03:09:47.440]  groundwork.
[03:09:47.440 --> 03:09:50.640]  I mean, maybe Donald knew he was going to run for president back in the 80s and just didn't
[03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:51.640]  want to tell anybody.
[03:09:51.640 --> 03:09:56.280]  It was probably smart because then I guess they would have started, he would have automatically
[03:09:56.280 --> 03:10:00.000]  been a racist back then, you know, because that's what happens, I guess, when you run
[03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:05.760]  for office and you have Democratic Party operatives, of course that was the party that started
[03:10:05.760 --> 03:10:07.080]  the KKK.
[03:10:07.080 --> 03:10:11.320]  And also, you have Hillary Clinton, who was a known friend to Senator Robert Byrd, who
[03:10:11.320 --> 03:10:17.760]  was a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan back in West Virginia, and Bill Clinton also praised
[03:10:17.760 --> 03:10:19.720]  him at his funeral.
[03:10:19.720 --> 03:10:24.440]  But that's okay because they're liberal Democrats and they love you, they really do, they care
[03:10:24.440 --> 03:10:25.440]  about you.
[03:10:25.440 --> 03:10:29.240]  That's why they lie to you consistently, tell you that you're going to get something for
[03:10:29.240 --> 03:10:31.640]  free when you're not.
[03:10:31.640 --> 03:10:37.400]  And also, here's an article that Darren McBreen passed over to me from the New York Times,
[03:10:37.400 --> 03:10:42.400]  Goodbye Password, Banks Up to Scan Fingers and Faces Instead.
[03:10:42.400 --> 03:10:46.320]  This is something Alex Jones told you about 15 years ago, that this was going to come.
[03:10:46.320 --> 03:10:48.240]  They're going to go to this biometric technology.
[03:10:48.240 --> 03:10:55.480]  In fact, he showed it back in his first film, jeez, what is his first film called, I want
[03:10:55.480 --> 03:10:58.480]  to say police state to that, America Destroyed by Design.
[03:10:58.480 --> 03:10:59.480]  America Destroyed by Design.
[03:10:59.480 --> 03:11:00.880]  He travels the country.
[03:11:00.880 --> 03:11:04.960]  He ends the whole video by getting arrested, going to get his driver's license renewed
[03:11:04.960 --> 03:11:07.600]  when they want him to thumb scan.
[03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:11.480]  And he says, look, this is part of a whole new biometric system where first it's the
[03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:14.480]  thumb, then they're going to want to take your blood, then they're going to get an
[03:11:14.480 --> 03:11:18.400]  irish scan, it's all happening to buy and sell to get a job.
[03:11:18.400 --> 03:11:19.400]  Here it is.
[03:11:19.400 --> 03:11:23.800]  Some of the nation's largest banks acknowledging that traditional passwords are either too cumbersome
[03:11:23.800 --> 03:11:27.920]  or no longer secure or increasingly using fingerprints, facial scans and other types
[03:11:27.920 --> 03:11:31.760]  of biometrics to safeguard accounts.
[03:11:31.760 --> 03:11:32.760]  So it's coming.
[03:11:32.760 --> 03:11:36.680]  Bank of America, JP Morgan, Chase and Wells Fargo routinely use fingerprints along their
[03:11:36.680 --> 03:11:40.000]  bank accounts through their mobile phones.
[03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:41.360]  So it's coming.
[03:11:41.360 --> 03:11:42.360]  Get ready.
[03:11:42.360 --> 03:11:45.040]  It's something we warned you about and pretty soon we won't be able to drive our cars.
[03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:47.680]  We won't be able to do anything and robots are going to take care of us and we're going
[03:11:47.680 --> 03:11:52.280]  to live like those fat people in Wally, you know, riding around sipping our giant ultra
[03:11:52.280 --> 03:11:57.440]  mega huge big ass fries and big gulps.
[03:11:57.440 --> 03:11:59.440]  Let's look at these two articles.
[03:11:59.440 --> 03:12:02.640]  That was the info wars coffee, by the way, it's really good.
[03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:06.720]  You got to check it out info wars store.com really wakes you up and get you pumped.
[03:12:06.720 --> 03:12:09.120]  All right, here's an article from Kit Daniels.
[03:12:09.120 --> 03:12:15.480]  Trump, Hillary takes millions from anti gay, anti women regimes, wants Sharia migrants.
[03:12:15.480 --> 03:12:19.720]  And this is based off the Trump speech that is all over the internet, taking the nation
[03:12:19.720 --> 03:12:23.240]  by storm and the Democrats are trying to figure out how they stop somebody who's actually
[03:12:23.240 --> 03:12:25.720]  telling the truth.
[03:12:25.720 --> 03:12:30.800]  I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people, but Hillary Clinton
[03:12:30.800 --> 03:12:33.960]  wants to bring in people who believe that women should be enslaved and gay should be
[03:12:33.960 --> 03:12:34.960]  put to death.
[03:12:34.960 --> 03:12:39.920]  He said in a speech in New York on Wednesday, maybe her motivation lies among the 1000 foreign
[03:12:39.920 --> 03:12:40.920]  donations.
[03:12:40.920 --> 03:12:42.920]  Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.
[03:12:42.920 --> 03:12:44.840]  Oh, don't want to talk about that.
[03:12:44.840 --> 03:12:45.840]  Do you, Clinton?
[03:12:45.840 --> 03:12:51.080]  She accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State,
[03:12:51.080 --> 03:12:52.880]  plus millions more for her foundation.
[03:12:52.880 --> 03:12:56.640]  The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death
[03:12:56.640 --> 03:12:58.480]  by stoning for being gay.
[03:12:58.480 --> 03:13:03.240]  The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary's
[03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:07.960]  Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she absolutely would approve if given the chance.
[03:13:07.960 --> 03:13:08.960]  And there's more in there.
[03:13:08.960 --> 03:13:11.800]  You can read it all at inforwars.com, it's by Kit Daniels.
[03:13:11.800 --> 03:13:15.600]  And here's an article we have posted, but it's from Information Liberation.
[03:13:15.600 --> 03:13:21.800]  Watch as Calais migrants riot chant F the UK demand access to Britain.
[03:13:21.800 --> 03:13:25.280]  So effort, we hate it, but we want to get in there because we like what you've done.
[03:13:25.280 --> 03:13:29.280]  We like what Western freedom has brought and the prosperity is brought.
[03:13:29.280 --> 03:13:33.000]  Now we just want to take it over and we think you owe us.
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:35.960]  Families reported being stuck in the chaos all day as gangs and migrants attacked the
[03:13:35.960 --> 03:13:39.560]  causeway and waves, hurling rocks and other projectiles at cars and breaking into lorries.
[03:13:39.560 --> 03:13:44.120]  In case you don't know what a lorry is, it's a big truck that they like to, and there's
[03:13:44.120 --> 03:13:46.200]  plenty of videos of that.
[03:13:46.200 --> 03:13:51.960]  So Breitbart has some of the tweets there from people, I guess there are tweets where
[03:13:51.960 --> 03:13:57.120]  people have been posting in, yeah, it is from tweets.
[03:13:57.120 --> 03:14:01.040]  Been stuck in Calais for 12 hours and watched migrants throw bricks at cars, drive into
[03:14:01.040 --> 03:14:06.280]  water by ferries and run into the shuttle chaos, tweeted a British journalist.
[03:14:06.280 --> 03:14:09.920]  I can assure you what is being reported as a power outage is he actually violence and
[03:14:09.920 --> 03:14:12.480]  chaos from migrants fighting here.
[03:14:12.480 --> 03:14:15.360]  There's another still stuck in Calais after day and night with migrants fighting with
[03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:21.040]  police tear gas being used and a five mile long queue chaotic.
[03:14:21.040 --> 03:14:22.200]  So it's all happening.
[03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:26.200]  Meanwhile, you got Hillary Clinton running around telling people Trump is going to ruin
[03:14:26.200 --> 03:14:28.360]  the economy if he gets elected.
[03:14:28.360 --> 03:14:36.840]  I actually have Trump's tax policy center analyzed his tax plan and they said it would
[03:14:36.840 --> 03:14:41.360]  significantly reduce marginal tax rates on individuals and businesses and increase standard
[03:14:41.360 --> 03:14:47.000]  deduction amounts nearly four times to the current level and may curtail many tax expenditures
[03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  and it would cut incomes at all level.
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:54.840]  They do say the largest benefits will go to those making the highest amounts, but it would
[03:14:54.840 --> 03:15:00.500]  increase federal tax revenues by 9.5 trillion in its first decade.
[03:15:00.500 --> 03:15:06.280]  But he would have to actually have considerable spending cuts in order to counteract those
[03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:10.720]  tax increases or it will put more people to work and more businesses would hire more
[03:15:10.720 --> 03:15:15.240]  people and you would have more taxes to go from because more people would be employed.
[03:15:15.240 --> 03:15:20.600]  Currently we have something like 20 to 30 even to 50 million people not being employed
[03:15:20.600 --> 03:15:25.720]  right now or underemployed under this current awesome Obama economy that has failed to grow
[03:15:25.720 --> 03:15:29.320]  by 3% and the only president to ever do that.
[03:15:29.320 --> 03:15:30.320]  That's okay.
[03:15:30.320 --> 03:15:31.800]  I'm just a conspiracy theorist.
[03:15:31.800 --> 03:15:38.360]  Hey guys, we find the Kit Daniels video I want to go to that if possible in this break,
[03:15:38.360 --> 03:15:42.560]  but we might not have time.
[03:15:42.560 --> 03:15:47.160]  Alrighty, so I guess we might go to that later.
[03:15:47.160 --> 03:15:51.880]  I do want to play John Bowne's video which we're going to play in the next segment and
[03:15:51.880 --> 03:15:53.920]  it is the Clintons, the real racists.
[03:15:53.920 --> 03:15:57.760]  I just kind of went over a smattering of how she's a bit racist.
[03:15:57.760 --> 03:16:01.240]  She's also said some interesting things while she was in the White House which are being
[03:16:01.240 --> 03:16:04.000]  reported by a former secret service agent.
[03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:06.720]  So when we come back in that next short segment, we're going to play that and we're going to
[03:16:06.720 --> 03:16:10.440]  have our interview with John Acoviva and he's going to be able to comment on what's going
[03:16:10.440 --> 03:16:14.720]  on in Venezuela, which will soon be coming here versus going to hit Europe and it's going
[03:16:14.720 --> 03:16:15.960]  to hit here.
[03:16:15.960 --> 03:16:21.280]  How basically their socialist utopia is just burning down in flames because they weren't
[03:16:21.280 --> 03:16:24.960]  able to account for the price of oil and they can't steal anymore people's property anymore
[03:16:24.960 --> 03:16:26.520]  because they've done stolen on.
[03:16:26.520 --> 03:16:30.160]  They don't know how to run it because governments don't know how to run much of anything except
[03:16:30.160 --> 03:16:33.680]  run countries into the ground.
[03:16:33.680 --> 03:16:35.000]  So we'll talk about that.
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:37.960]  He's in Britain right now so we'll probably talk a little bit about Brexit and why he
[03:16:37.960 --> 03:16:42.520]  supports Donald Trump and why he isn't afraid of somebody who's been a businessman and who's
[03:16:42.520 --> 03:16:44.040]  failed at businesses.
[03:16:44.040 --> 03:16:49.280]  He's had businesses that have gone bankrupt and he's brought himself back.
[03:16:49.280 --> 03:16:55.680]  He's now richer than ever by not stopping and crying on his sleeve or asking for the government
[03:16:55.680 --> 03:16:58.240]  to help him out.
[03:16:58.240 --> 03:17:00.360]  So here it is from a couple days ago.
[03:17:00.360 --> 03:17:05.640]  This was on Fox News, Hillary Clinton's amazing, almost comical economic speech and she starts
[03:17:05.640 --> 03:17:07.840]  off by stating the patently obvious.
[03:17:07.840 --> 03:17:11.520]  People are working harder and longer just to keep their heads above water and to deal
[03:17:11.520 --> 03:17:15.240]  with costs, the everyday costs, the costs of basic childcare, prescription drugs that
[03:17:15.240 --> 03:17:16.240]  are too high.
[03:17:16.240 --> 03:17:17.640]  Well, that's because you're Obamacare.
[03:17:17.640 --> 03:17:18.640]  College is getting more expensive.
[03:17:18.640 --> 03:17:23.520]  Well, that's because you've basically subsidized college for everybody and wages are still
[03:17:23.520 --> 03:17:26.760]  low and inequality is too great.
[03:17:26.760 --> 03:17:31.040]  Good jobs in this country are still true hard to come by.
[03:17:31.040 --> 03:17:38.080]  And then she lectures us about fiscal responsibility and even though the Obama administration has
[03:17:38.080 --> 03:17:44.760]  doubled the national debt to 19 trillion, he's doubled it in eight years.
[03:17:44.760 --> 03:17:50.560]  So that's not too hard, it's hard for somebody to sit there and talk about being fiscally
[03:17:50.560 --> 03:17:54.960]  responsible when she's been part of that by being secretary of state.
[03:17:54.960 --> 03:17:57.920]  And of course she talks about class warfare, which is something she loves and loves to
[03:17:57.920 --> 03:18:00.120]  propagate.
[03:18:00.120 --> 03:18:01.120]  People don't understand this.
[03:18:01.120 --> 03:18:08.720]  The reason you're poor, this world offers you plenty of advantages to get out.
[03:18:08.720 --> 03:18:12.160]  This world offers you plenty of opportunities, okay?
[03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:14.480]  If you don't have internet, you can go to the library and get internet.
[03:18:14.480 --> 03:18:17.720]  You can educate yourself by learning how to read.
[03:18:17.720 --> 03:18:19.640]  The world is at your fingertips.
[03:18:19.640 --> 03:18:24.000]  And if you are not able to rise to the level you want to be at, you really only have one
[03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:25.080]  person to blame.
[03:18:25.080 --> 03:18:27.720]  You could blame your parents, but then that's passing the buck.
[03:18:27.720 --> 03:18:30.040]  You only can look in the mirror and blame yourself.
[03:18:30.040 --> 03:18:35.000]  Point that finger right at yourself in the mirror and say, I got to do better, okay?
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:36.720]  Nobody gave me this job here at Info Wars.
[03:18:36.720 --> 03:18:38.120]  I had to earn it.
[03:18:38.120 --> 03:18:40.680]  And I rose through the ranks from coming here.
[03:18:40.680 --> 03:18:47.320]  When I started working, I was making, I think 15 or $16 an hour when I started.
[03:18:47.320 --> 03:18:51.560]  And I rose up through by showing I could be dependable, by showing I showed up on time,
[03:18:51.560 --> 03:18:56.440]  by showing I could be flexible in how things are, by showing I could be conscious.
[03:18:56.440 --> 03:18:59.840]  All these things help you, and I'm speaking to the young people out there that are crying
[03:18:59.840 --> 03:19:03.560]  in their beers right now that they can't get a real job because they've got two or
[03:19:03.560 --> 03:19:05.200]  three college degrees.
[03:19:05.200 --> 03:19:07.600]  You only have yourself to blame, okay?
[03:19:07.600 --> 03:19:09.080]  And it's not your fault entirely.
[03:19:09.080 --> 03:19:10.180]  You believed in the system.
[03:19:10.180 --> 03:19:13.400]  You believed in what these talking heads on TV have told you.
[03:19:13.400 --> 03:19:16.960]  The people who are, you know, the people who are more successful are the guys that went
[03:19:16.960 --> 03:19:21.760]  out and just decided to be a plumber or decided to get a landscaping company and work really
[03:19:21.760 --> 03:19:22.760]  hard.
[03:19:22.760 --> 03:19:23.760]  I did all that too.
[03:19:23.760 --> 03:19:25.320]  I worked on a farm for a year.
[03:19:25.320 --> 03:19:27.120]  I built houses for a summer.
[03:19:27.120 --> 03:19:31.320]  I learned about how to do things with my hands because when you learn how to do things with
[03:19:31.320 --> 03:19:34.120]  your hands, then nobody can take those skills away from you.
[03:19:34.120 --> 03:19:38.400]  And then you can realize and you're empowered to realize that you can do anything you want
[03:19:38.400 --> 03:19:40.080]  and nobody can stop you.
[03:19:40.080 --> 03:19:42.800]  But don't let the globalists tell you that because they won't.
[03:19:42.800 --> 03:19:45.440]  They will stop you any chance they get because they want you to be a slave and they want
[03:19:45.440 --> 03:19:46.440]  to take your energy.
[03:19:46.440 --> 03:19:50.200]  We'll be right back with more coming up with a video about how the Clintons are the real
[03:19:50.200 --> 03:19:52.280]  racists out there and it's not Donald Trump.
[03:19:52.280 --> 03:19:55.880]  Oh, tell your liberal friends to tune in and for us.com forward slash show will be right
[03:19:55.880 --> 03:19:56.880]  back with a fourth hour.
[03:19:56.880 --> 03:19:58.720]  This is Rob Dew reporting.
[03:19:58.720 --> 03:20:01.560]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[03:20:01.560 --> 03:20:05.720]  I'm a former 22 year congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[03:20:05.720 --> 03:20:09.560]  I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives.
[03:20:09.560 --> 03:20:13.680]  You never know when there will be another Katrina and economic collapse or a serious
[03:20:13.680 --> 03:20:14.680]  drought.
[03:20:14.680 --> 03:20:18.000]  We all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times.
[03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:20.800]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.
[03:20:20.800 --> 03:20:26.320]  A U.S. company named Harvest Right has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared.
[03:20:26.320 --> 03:20:28.000]  It's a home freeze dryer.

[03:20:38.080 --> 03:20:43.360]  With a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right, you can literally freeze dry anything you eat.
[03:20:43.360 --> 03:20:45.080]  And things like ice cream.

[03:21:58.280 --> 03:22:04.320]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but were waiting for an outrageously
[03:22:04.320 --> 03:22:07.840]  low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[03:22:07.840 --> 03:22:08.840]  Here's why.
[03:22:08.840 --> 03:22:12.720]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[03:22:12.720 --> 03:22:13.720]  So please listen.
[03:22:13.720 --> 03:22:18.920]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power, and unlike gas generators,
[03:22:18.920 --> 03:22:23.400]  solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the
[03:22:23.400 --> 03:22:24.400]  sun.
[03:22:24.400 --> 03:22:28.600]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[03:22:28.600 --> 03:22:30.960]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[03:22:30.960 --> 03:22:33.640]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[03:22:33.640 --> 03:22:38.240]  Systems from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators, and they're
[03:22:38.240 --> 03:22:42.760]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low
[03:22:42.760 --> 03:22:44.840]  price for infowarsteam listeners.
[03:22:44.840 --> 03:22:46.520]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[03:22:46.520 --> 03:22:50.000]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.

[03:22:59.240 --> 03:23:03.920]  The Genesis Communications Network is one of America's premier broadcasters of captivating
[03:23:03.920 --> 03:23:05.200]  talk radio.

[03:24:16.160 --> 03:24:22.440]  If you go to my Twitter account at Doos News, I just posted a tweet that I was going live
[03:24:22.440 --> 03:24:26.360]  on m4s.com, or incidentally, you can watch the free stream.
[03:24:26.360 --> 03:24:29.600]  So if you're listening to this, you can actually watch the video we're about to play, which
[03:24:29.600 --> 03:24:32.120]  is how the Clintons are the real racist.
[03:24:32.120 --> 03:24:37.120]  But one of the people that replied, Benjamin, at hashtag Vote Leave, put a couple, or the
[03:24:37.120 --> 03:24:40.760]  one right before it, Team Murphy, put a couple videos up there about Brexit.
[03:24:40.760 --> 03:24:43.800]  So I didn't get a chance to watch them, but I looked at the titles.
[03:24:43.800 --> 03:24:44.920]  They look pretty good.
[03:24:44.920 --> 03:24:49.160]  One of which I think David Cameron was telling people, be fearful if you vote leave and let
[03:24:49.160 --> 03:24:50.600]  fear be your guide.
[03:24:50.600 --> 03:24:51.960]  Fear should never be your guide.
[03:24:51.960 --> 03:24:53.560]  It should always be love.
[03:24:53.560 --> 03:24:55.080]  Just remember that.
[03:24:55.080 --> 03:25:00.320]  And one person we do love around here, we love, we love to hate, is Hillary Clinton.
[03:25:00.320 --> 03:25:06.200]  And we have the Hillary for Prison T-shirt, which Slate wrote about in, I guess it came
[03:25:06.200 --> 03:25:09.720]  out today, talking about how they couldn't believe people were in these Hillary for Prison
[03:25:09.720 --> 03:25:10.720]  T-shirts.
[03:25:10.720 --> 03:25:16.640]  And how could people, or how could people want the little lady running for president
[03:25:16.640 --> 03:25:19.240]  to be put in prison and that she deserved it?
[03:25:19.240 --> 03:25:20.240]  Well, she does deserve it.
[03:25:20.240 --> 03:25:23.920]  Her crimes are legion, and we should at least put her on trial.
[03:25:23.920 --> 03:25:27.720]  Right now they're 50% off for one, and you can get the next for 75% off.
[03:25:27.720 --> 03:25:28.920]  Can you believe that?
[03:25:28.920 --> 03:25:33.320]  50% and 75%, it's 125% off for two.
[03:25:33.320 --> 03:25:34.320]  There you go.
[03:25:34.320 --> 03:25:35.320]  Buy one for yourself and get a second.
[03:25:35.320 --> 03:25:36.320]  75% off.
[03:25:36.320 --> 03:25:37.480]  Get one for a friend, family, or co-workers.
[03:25:37.480 --> 03:25:40.480]  Let everybody you know that Hillary Clinton deserves to be in prison.
[03:25:40.480 --> 03:25:44.200]  This is a meme that we've been working on for a long time, and it's finally gaining steam.
[03:25:44.200 --> 03:25:46.280]  It was going viral back in May, and it kind of went down.
[03:25:46.280 --> 03:25:51.520]  Now it's back up again because it's now Hillary versus Trump, and without further ado, let's
[03:25:51.520 --> 03:25:54.120]  go to John Bowne's report on the Clintons, the real racists.
[03:25:54.120 --> 03:25:55.120]  Why would you support a racist?
[03:25:55.120 --> 03:25:56.120]  He said he wouldn't say you back to Africa.
[03:25:56.120 --> 03:25:57.120]  That's what he said.
[03:25:57.120 --> 03:25:58.120]  He didn't say Mexicans back to Mexico.
[03:25:58.120 --> 03:25:59.120]  You are displaced to America.
[03:25:59.120 --> 03:26:00.120]  Thank you.
[03:26:00.120 --> 03:26:01.120]  For being a young black man.
[03:26:01.120 --> 03:26:02.120]  Thank you.
[03:26:02.120 --> 03:26:03.120]  Support a racist.
[03:26:03.120 --> 03:26:04.120]  Thank you.
[03:26:04.120 --> 03:26:05.120]  Donald Trump wasn't saying.
[03:26:05.120 --> 03:26:06.120]  I think he's a racist.
[03:26:06.120 --> 03:26:07.120]  Come on.
[03:26:07.120 --> 03:26:08.120]  Tell us why you think Trump's a racist.
[03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:18.120]  We want to talk about the details, man.
[03:26:18.120 --> 03:26:19.120]  Yeah.
[03:26:19.120 --> 03:26:20.120]  What about the facts?
[03:26:20.120 --> 03:26:25.120]  How come you guys can only say he's a racist, but y'all can't talk about the facts?
[03:26:25.120 --> 03:26:26.120]  Why is that?
[03:26:26.120 --> 03:26:31.120]  His opponents say that this is more proof that he's racist, and you know, people say
[03:26:31.120 --> 03:26:32.120]  is this racism?
[03:26:32.120 --> 03:26:35.120]  Because it sounds to me like you want to bring back the one-drop rule.
[03:26:35.120 --> 03:26:36.120]  Yeah.
[03:26:36.120 --> 03:26:40.120]  No, he said that the criminals were coming over, which is a fact.
[03:26:40.120 --> 03:26:41.120]  Is it?
[03:26:41.120 --> 03:26:43.120]  I mean, some have come over, yes.
[03:26:43.120 --> 03:26:46.120]  So why should I be put into that category?
[03:26:46.120 --> 03:26:49.120]  Why should I be looked at as a bad person because I like guns?
[03:26:49.120 --> 03:26:51.120]  Does media do that to use a white male?
[03:26:51.120 --> 03:26:52.120]  Of course.
[03:26:52.120 --> 03:26:54.120]  Oh, I'm the white man thing.
[03:26:54.120 --> 03:26:56.120]  Oh, you are, aren't you?
[03:26:56.120 --> 03:26:57.120]  Yeah.
[03:26:57.120 --> 03:26:58.120]  Got good eyes.
[03:26:58.120 --> 03:27:01.120]  Does anyone on the left actually care about racism?
[03:27:01.120 --> 03:27:08.120]  Or is it just being used as a salinsky-esque tool to polarize the sheep into bleeding
[03:27:08.120 --> 03:27:11.120]  what they have been told is true?
[03:27:11.120 --> 03:27:16.120]  Because according to Dolly Kyle, the former high school girlfriend of Bill Clinton,
[03:27:16.120 --> 03:27:22.120]  Bill and Hillary Clinton regularly used racial epithets and looked down on poor people.
[03:27:22.120 --> 03:27:27.120]  Kyle makes the accusation in her book, Hillary, the Other Woman.
[03:27:27.120 --> 03:27:33.120]  In addition to calling mentally disabled children at a governor's match in Easter Egg Hunt effing retards,
[03:27:33.120 --> 03:27:38.120]  Kyle says Hillary referred to the people of Arkansas as ignorant hillbillies.
[03:27:38.120 --> 03:27:44.120]  Hillary also allegedly used derogatory terms for Jews, including effing Jew bastard.
[03:27:44.120 --> 03:27:50.120]  Bill, Kyle insists, called the Reverend Jesse Jackson a GDN word.
[03:27:50.120 --> 03:27:53.120]  Latinos were similarly slandered and profiled.
[03:27:53.120 --> 03:27:56.120]  Kyle continues, for no good reason.
[03:27:56.120 --> 03:28:00.120]  Bill and Hillary decided to profile Hispanics as drug dealers.
[03:28:00.120 --> 03:28:06.120]  Specifically, Arkansas troopers were to stop and search cars driven by Hispanics,
[03:28:06.120 --> 03:28:09.120]  especially those cars with Texas license plates.
[03:28:09.120 --> 03:28:14.120]  Clinton's criminal apprehension program was ruled unconstitutional.
[03:28:14.120 --> 03:28:15.120]  Kyle continues,
[03:28:15.120 --> 03:28:21.120]  Billy threw one of his infamous temper tantrums about the ban on his racial profiling of Hispanics,
[03:28:21.120 --> 03:28:26.120]  and he threatened to renew the racial profiling program in spite of the court's ruling.
[03:28:26.120 --> 03:28:28.120]  The Daily Beast notes,
[03:28:28.120 --> 03:28:32.120]  Clinton's violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994,
[03:28:32.120 --> 03:28:35.120]  authored by then Senator Joe Biden,
[03:28:35.120 --> 03:28:39.120]  was supported by virtually every Democrat in Congress,
[03:28:39.120 --> 03:28:43.120]  including then-representative Bernie Sanders.
[03:28:43.120 --> 03:28:47.120]  That legislation led to the mass incarceration of black Americans.
[03:28:47.120 --> 03:28:51.120]  Legal scholar Michelle Alexander notes,
[03:28:51.120 --> 03:28:58.120]  Bill Clinton presided over the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history.
[03:28:58.120 --> 03:29:02.120]  Alexander accused the Clintons of decimating black America,
[03:29:02.120 --> 03:29:06.120]  and said Hillary does not deserve the black vote.
[03:29:06.120 --> 03:29:09.120]  In response to pressure by Black Lives Matter,
[03:29:09.120 --> 03:29:13.120]  Hillary apologized for her role in pushing for the bill.
[03:29:13.120 --> 03:29:17.120]  Despite Hillary's alleged racism, a large number of blacks,
[03:29:17.120 --> 03:29:21.120]  especially in the South, turned out to vote for Clinton during the primaries.
[03:29:21.120 --> 03:29:23.120]  The Huffington Post notes,
[03:29:23.120 --> 03:29:26.120]  both Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton,
[03:29:26.120 --> 03:29:29.120]  have traditionally had solid support from blacks,
[03:29:29.120 --> 03:29:32.120]  a key component of the Democratic electorate.
[03:29:32.120 --> 03:29:35.120]  In May, a Fox News poll revealed 62% of Latinos...
[03:29:35.120 --> 03:29:39.120]  All right, you can watch the rest of that video on the Alex Jones channel on our YouTube.
[03:29:39.120 --> 03:29:43.120]  Bring that up, guys. It's the Clintons The Real Racist right there. It's from John Bown.
[03:29:43.120 --> 03:29:45.120]  Also, Report!
[03:29:45.120 --> 03:29:49.120]  Released criminal in the community 10 times more crimes than the Obama administration told Congress.
[03:29:49.120 --> 03:29:50.120]  Who's right?
[03:29:50.120 --> 03:29:53.120]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.120 --> 03:29:56.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.120 --> 03:30:07.120]  Brexit D-Day looms with trillions of dollars at stake in decades of scheming to concentrate political power.
[03:30:07.120 --> 03:30:11.120]  The organized globalists are pulling out all the stops in a final desperate push
[03:30:11.120 --> 03:30:16.120]  to frighten British voters away from reclaiming sovereignty and control over their own lives,
[03:30:16.120 --> 03:30:19.120]  their own finances, and their own borders.
[03:30:19.120 --> 03:30:24.120]  It speaks volumes that Rothschild, Soros, Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase,
[03:30:24.120 --> 03:30:29.120]  BlackRock, the Carlisle Group have been threatening apocalyptic-level consequences
[03:30:29.120 --> 03:30:31.120]  if the UK leaves the EU.
[03:30:31.120 --> 03:30:36.120]  The movement to leave the EU was gaining steady momentum until the assassination of Joe Cox,
[03:30:36.120 --> 03:30:41.120]  the pro-remain member of parliament, who was brutally shot and stabbed to death on June 16.
[03:30:41.120 --> 03:30:47.120]  Immediately as if on cue, the pro-globalist press exploited the tragedy to condemn the leave campaign.
[03:30:47.120 --> 03:30:52.120]  Will Britons reclaim their sovereignty and being in control of their own destiny?
[03:30:52.120 --> 03:30:55.120]  Find out Thursday on the June 23rd, Brexit referendum.
[03:30:55.120 --> 03:31:07.120]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo reporting for Infowars.com.
[03:31:26.120 --> 03:31:30.120]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[03:31:30.120 --> 03:31:33.120]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said. There's so many things that are in it.
[03:31:33.120 --> 03:31:37.120]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:31:37.120 --> 03:31:41.120]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:31:41.120 --> 03:31:44.120]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:31:44.120 --> 03:31:47.120]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, InfowarsLive.com.
[03:31:47.120 --> 03:31:50.120]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:31:50.120 --> 03:31:56.120]  And you support the broadcast, InfowarsLive.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[03:31:56.120 --> 03:32:21.120]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:32:26.120 --> 03:32:29.120]  Order your ProMax shower filter from ProPure today.
[03:32:56.120 --> 03:33:01.120]  5-3-3-1-3-9.
[03:33:26.120 --> 03:33:44.120]  This sounds like political presidential talk to me, and I know people have talked to you about whether or not you want to run. Would you ever?
[03:33:44.120 --> 03:33:48.120]  Probably not, but I do get tired of seeing the country ripped off.
[03:33:48.120 --> 03:33:49.120]  Why would you not?
[03:33:49.120 --> 03:33:54.120]  I just don't think I really have the inclination to do it. I love what I'm doing. I really like it.
[03:33:54.120 --> 03:33:56.120]  Also, it doesn't pay as well.
[03:33:56.120 --> 03:33:57.120]  No, it doesn't.
[03:33:57.120 --> 03:34:03.120]  But, you know, I just probably wouldn't do it, Oprah. I probably wouldn't, but I do get tired of seeing what's happening with this country.
[03:34:03.120 --> 03:34:15.120]  And if it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what's happening with this country, how we're really making other people live like kings, and we're not.
[03:34:15.120 --> 03:34:19.120]  You've said, though, that if you did run for president, you believe you'd win.
[03:34:19.120 --> 03:34:24.120]  Well, I don't know. I think I'd win. I tell you what, I wouldn't go in to lose. I've never gone in to losing my life.
[03:34:24.120 --> 03:34:31.120]  And if I did decide to do it, I think I'd be inclined. I would say that I would have a hell of a chance of winning, because I think people...
[03:34:31.120 --> 03:34:35.120]  I don't know how your audience feels, but I think people are tired of seeing the United States ripped off.
[03:34:35.120 --> 03:34:42.120]  And I can't promise you everything, but I can tell you one thing. This country would make one hell of a lot of money from those people that for 25 years have taken advantage.
[03:34:42.120 --> 03:34:44.120]  It wouldn't be the way it's been, believe me.
[03:34:44.120 --> 03:34:51.120]  But you might be classified as an Eastern Republican. Fair?
[03:34:51.120 --> 03:34:52.120]  I guess you could say that, yes.
[03:34:52.120 --> 03:34:56.120]  Which means kind of a Rockefeller, Chase Manhattan Republican?
[03:34:56.120 --> 03:34:57.120]  I never thought of another of those terms.
[03:34:57.120 --> 03:34:59.120]  How do you define it? Are you a Bush Republican?
[03:34:59.120 --> 03:35:04.120]  No, I think I'm really... The people that I do best with are the people that drive the taxis.
[03:35:04.120 --> 03:35:09.120]  You know, wealthy people don't like me, because I'm competing against them all the time, and they don't like me, and I like to win.
[03:35:09.120 --> 03:35:15.120]  The fact is, I go down the streets of New York, and the people that really like me are the taxi drivers, and the workers, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:35:15.120 --> 03:35:16.120]  I mean, I really...
[03:35:16.120 --> 03:35:17.120]  Why are you a Republican?
[03:35:17.120 --> 03:35:22.120]  I have no idea. I mean, I have a Republican, because I just believe in certain principles of the Republican Party.
[03:35:22.120 --> 03:35:26.120]  You have flirted with the idea of politics. Now you're here at your...
[03:35:26.120 --> 03:35:31.120]  And that is why they call him the blue-collar billionaire, because he resonates with blue-collar people.
[03:35:31.120 --> 03:35:35.120]  He's a likable guy. He's an everyman.
[03:35:35.120 --> 03:35:40.120]  And that's why the establishment on both sides hate him, because he's not an elitist.
[03:35:40.120 --> 03:35:48.120]  You know, there's stories of him going into kitchens of his restaurants and passing out $100 bills to his staff, and it's more than one story.
[03:35:48.120 --> 03:35:54.120]  And that's because he likes the people that work for him, and when he hires people and they're loyal, he returns that in kind.
[03:35:54.120 --> 03:35:59.120]  And a couple of things he said right there, just in that short video, and I'll get to the name of that video in a second.
[03:35:59.120 --> 03:36:08.120]  He says, you know, talking about living like kings, and how he's tired of the American people getting ripped off.
[03:36:08.120 --> 03:36:14.120]  He said that back in 1989. It's like 15 years ago, he was saying that.
[03:36:14.120 --> 03:36:17.120]  And it's still true today. What does he talk about in his speech?
[03:36:17.120 --> 03:36:24.120]  He's tired of America being second. He was the American people to be first in the eyes of America and not being treated as second-class citizens.
[03:36:24.120 --> 03:36:31.120]  And you can watch that whole video. You go to this article here. This video will get Donald Trump elected if it goes viral.
[03:36:31.120 --> 03:36:34.120]  We put this out on June 9th. Alex was talking about it.
[03:36:34.120 --> 03:36:40.120]  It was big back then. It got over 1,100 comments on infowars.com.
[03:36:40.120 --> 03:36:49.120]  27-minute video, and it's got 1,500,000 views as of this point. A little bit over that.
[03:36:49.120 --> 03:36:57.120]  Alright, and our next guest actually created this video. His name is John Aquaviva, and he's not even an American, okay?
[03:36:57.120 --> 03:37:07.120]  He was born in Venezuela. He left Venezuela back in 2014. He was forced from Venezuela because he was added to the cyberterrorism list by the government.
[03:37:07.120 --> 03:37:12.120]  Because he incited violence on social media platforms is what the government said.
[03:37:12.120 --> 03:37:17.120]  Probably because he said, hey, we shouldn't be living like animals and the government shouldn't own everything.
[03:37:17.120 --> 03:37:24.120]  And of course, they took his family's land, and it's still being abandoned today, and I'm going to let him talk about that.
[03:37:24.120 --> 03:37:32.120]  And now he's living in Britain. So he'll have a pretty good idea from an outsider's point of view of what people are talking about in Brexit.
[03:37:32.120 --> 03:37:39.120]  Because sometimes you get a different point of view from somebody who's living there than somebody who's an actual citizen of there, than somebody who's living there,
[03:37:39.120 --> 03:37:45.120]  but who's politically savvy and knows what's going on. Sometimes the people living there don't even know what's going on.
[03:37:45.120 --> 03:37:53.120]  You go to your own country here. How many people does Mark Dice interview of American citizens who think,
[03:37:53.120 --> 03:38:02.120]  you could just go watch some of the Mark Dice videos that we should ban water or that I can't think of some of these more classic videos.
[03:38:02.120 --> 03:38:08.120]  But these are citizens living in our own country and think the Bill of Rights should be abolished, among other things.
[03:38:08.120 --> 03:38:15.120]  Anyway, his name is John Aquaviva, and we're going to have him on in one second. We're hooking up his Skype connection now.
[03:38:15.120 --> 03:38:24.120]  But let me, before we get to him, today is the last day of the Tim Kennedy special, 15% off Supermail Vitality, BrainForce and Secret12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:38:24.120 --> 03:38:31.120]  And I used all three of these at different points. I don't use Supermail as much because I'm not in a workout mode right now,
[03:38:31.120 --> 03:38:42.120]  but I use Secret12 and BrainForce both on my trip to Bilderberg. And actually the morning I took Secret12 was the actual day I chased down Petraeus,
[03:38:42.120 --> 03:38:49.120]  where I had my backpack full of gear. It was so hot, I'd taken off my jacket and had that folded inside my backpack.
[03:38:49.120 --> 03:38:54.120]  And I'm doing an interview with this other guy who's handing me flyers of all of his stuff.
[03:38:54.120 --> 03:39:00.120]  And I'm interviewing him as he's getting hassled by the police for writing on chalk and I see Petraeus jog by and I'm like, gotta go.
[03:39:00.120 --> 03:39:08.120]  That's the guy I'm looking for. And I started asking him a question about, you know, he had to resign because of his email server getting hacked or his emails getting hacked.
[03:39:08.120 --> 03:39:16.120]  And how come Hillary hasn't had to resign? It's been proven her email server's been hacked numerous times. Who knows who has all these secrets?
[03:39:16.120 --> 03:39:22.120]  Trump brought that out. We don't even know what the enemy knows because she deleted all those emails.
[03:39:22.120 --> 03:39:28.120]  So Trump's the guy who wants to put America first. Hillary is a witch who wants to put the Saudi Arabian Kingdom first.
[03:39:28.120 --> 03:39:31.120]  And we know that because those are the people that are paying her off.
[03:39:31.120 --> 03:39:35.120]  And so anyway, go to m4slife.com. Check out the Tim Kennedy special.
[03:39:35.120 --> 03:39:39.120]  It's the last day it's going on. Supermail vitality. It's our biggest seller.
[03:39:39.120 --> 03:39:44.120]  Brainforce and secret 12. Brainforce, you've heard me talk about it over and over again.
[03:39:44.120 --> 03:39:50.120]  Also deep cleanse, 20% off. And then we have the amazing Hillary for prison t-shirts.
[03:39:50.120 --> 03:39:54.120]  The first one, you get 50% off. The second one, 75%.
[03:39:54.120 --> 03:39:57.120]  Might as well get three or four. Pass them out.
[03:39:57.120 --> 03:39:59.120]  Pass them as pre-Christmas gifts.
[03:39:59.120 --> 03:40:03.120]  Give them as 4th of July gifts, okay?
[03:40:03.120 --> 03:40:09.120]  Wear your shirts proud because when you wear that shirt, people will notice it's a great conversation starter.
[03:40:09.120 --> 03:40:12.120]  You'll find like-minded people immediately.
[03:40:12.120 --> 03:40:16.120]  Even if they're not Trump fans, hey, you can all be anti-Hillary fans.
[03:40:16.120 --> 03:40:22.120]  In fact, part of Donald Trump's speech that he had was appealing to Bernie Sanders voters
[03:40:22.120 --> 03:40:27.120]  and just saying, hey, look, join our movement. We're anti-establishment.
[03:40:27.120 --> 03:40:30.120]  We're by the people. I'm not spending a billion dollars on it.
[03:40:30.120 --> 03:40:34.120]  People want to talk about how Trump doesn't have all this money in his campaign.
[03:40:34.120 --> 03:40:37.120]  He doesn't need to put as much money because one, he's got the truth on his side
[03:40:37.120 --> 03:40:39.120]  so he doesn't have to pay as much for his lies.
[03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:43.120]  And two, he knows how to work these idiots in the mainstream media
[03:40:43.120 --> 03:40:46.120]  to where they talk about him and talk about him incessantly.
[03:40:46.120 --> 03:40:49.120]  They were talking about his speech or not even his speech in on Fox News,
[03:40:49.120 --> 03:40:52.120]  just one of the things he tweeted for 20 minutes.
[03:40:52.120 --> 03:40:57.120]  That's free airtime, folks. That's how he's getting it done, which my hat's off to him.
[03:40:57.120 --> 03:40:59.120]  He's getting the media to talk about him.
[03:40:59.120 --> 03:41:03.120]  I wonder how they're going to talk about this Hillary speech, especially MSNBC.
[03:41:03.120 --> 03:41:06.120]  If they're even going to bring it up, they'll probably pretend it didn't exist.
[03:41:06.120 --> 03:41:09.120]  Do we have John on the line now?
[03:41:09.120 --> 03:41:12.120]  Okay.
[03:41:12.120 --> 03:41:15.120]  Well, I just talked to him on this number in here.
[03:41:15.120 --> 03:41:18.120]  Maybe we'll just pipe him in through the cell phone and it seemed to be working.
[03:41:18.120 --> 03:41:22.120]  We're going to get him on. Let's play that Bernie Sanders clip, how he was appealing,
[03:41:22.120 --> 03:41:26.120]  just basically saying, hey, look, you're not going to vote for Hillary.
[03:41:26.120 --> 03:41:31.120]  You might as well come on over to the Trump side and help make America great again.
[03:41:31.120 --> 03:41:33.120]  Here's that clip.
[03:41:33.120 --> 03:41:39.120]  The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.
[03:41:39.120 --> 03:41:44.120]  That's why we're asking Bernie Sanders voters to join our movement.
[03:41:44.120 --> 03:41:50.120]  So together we can fix the system for all Americans so important.
[03:41:50.120 --> 03:42:02.120]  This includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals and they are disastrous.
[03:42:02.120 --> 03:42:07.120]  They're destroying our country because it's not just the political system that's rigged.
[03:42:07.120 --> 03:42:16.120]  It's the whole economy.
[03:42:16.120 --> 03:42:19.120]  It's rigged by big donors who want to keep wages down.
[03:42:19.120 --> 03:42:24.120]  It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers,
[03:42:24.120 --> 03:42:31.120]  and sell their products back into the United States with absolutely no consequences for them.
[03:42:31.120 --> 03:42:36.120]  It's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.
[03:42:36.120 --> 03:42:40.120]  It's rigged against you, the American people.
[03:42:40.120 --> 03:42:47.120]  Hillary Clinton, and as you know, she, most people know, she's a world-class liar.
[03:42:47.120 --> 03:42:59.120]  Just look at her pathetic email server statements or her phony landing.
[03:42:59.120 --> 03:43:04.120]  Or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack
[03:43:04.120 --> 03:43:08.120]  and the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers.
[03:43:08.120 --> 03:43:13.120]  A total and, oh look, this was one of the buttes.
[03:43:13.120 --> 03:43:17.120]  A total and self-serving lie.
[03:43:17.120 --> 03:43:21.120]  Brian Williams' career was destroyed.
[03:43:21.120 --> 03:43:24.120]  That's exactly right.
[03:43:24.120 --> 03:43:26.120]  And we played a little bit more.
[03:43:26.120 --> 03:43:30.120]  He got a little extra Trump in there and we were doing some wargaming.
[03:43:30.120 --> 03:43:35.120]  We had John Skype and then he kept dropping and he's not answering his phone.
[03:43:35.120 --> 03:43:38.120]  So he may not join us this segment.
[03:43:38.120 --> 03:43:41.120]  We got a few minutes left in here and I was hoping we get to interview him
[03:43:41.120 --> 03:43:46.120]  to get his perspective on Venezuela, the Brexit, and also talk about why it took somebody
[03:43:46.120 --> 03:43:50.120]  who wasn't even American to try to wake up America.
[03:43:50.120 --> 03:43:55.120]  Because, you know, a lot of people have been woken up and, you know, it's funny
[03:43:55.120 --> 03:43:58.120]  that the establishment is so mad they've created all these lies.
[03:43:58.120 --> 03:44:01.120]  The Huffington Post says on every article about Trump, they're like,
[03:44:01.120 --> 03:44:07.120]  this man is a racist, sexist, xenophobe, they just come up and they put it on every article.
[03:44:07.120 --> 03:44:10.120]  Because they can't stand that somebody who's not an establishment darling,
[03:44:10.120 --> 03:44:15.120]  somebody who isn't bought and paid for, who isn't going to keep things as they are,
[03:44:15.120 --> 03:44:16.120]  is running for president.
[03:44:16.120 --> 03:44:19.120]  They're so mad and they believe in the lies so much.
[03:44:19.120 --> 03:44:21.120]  They just love it.
[03:44:21.120 --> 03:44:23.120]  And here's one of the other lies that they love to talk about,
[03:44:23.120 --> 03:44:28.120]  how Hillary is a friend of the gays and the lesbian community and women,
[03:44:28.120 --> 03:44:33.120]  yet she takes money from all these Saudis and all these other Middle Eastern countries
[03:44:33.120 --> 03:44:36.120]  who treat women as second-class citizens, who throw gays off buildings,
[03:44:36.120 --> 03:44:40.120]  who openly proclaim the gays should have their heads cut off.
[03:44:40.120 --> 03:44:45.120]  And whether you believe in that lifestyle or not isn't of my concern.
[03:44:45.120 --> 03:44:48.120]  You're not out there saying they should be killed and have their heads cut off.
[03:44:48.120 --> 03:44:50.120]  And you don't have to believe in that lifestyle.
[03:44:50.120 --> 03:44:54.120]  That's what makes America great, is that you don't have to agree with somebody else.
[03:44:54.120 --> 03:44:57.120]  But we have this land and there's plenty of land for everybody.
[03:44:57.120 --> 03:45:00.120]  And we can have room for everybody.
[03:45:00.120 --> 03:45:08.120]  Now, after the events in Orlando, a Houston gun shop decided to give free gun safety lessons
[03:45:08.120 --> 03:45:12.120]  and gun courses to the LGBT community.
[03:45:12.120 --> 03:45:17.120]  And we so happen to have our reporters Kit Daniels and Michael Zimmerman driving from Dallas
[03:45:17.120 --> 03:45:21.120]  to the Trump event to Houston, and this is in the northern part of Houston,
[03:45:21.120 --> 03:45:24.120]  I think in the Woodlands, said, hey, go interview this guy.
[03:45:24.120 --> 03:45:25.120]  Let's see what he's taught.
[03:45:25.120 --> 03:45:29.120]  Let's get the story straight from the horse's mouth, unfiltered, uncensored,
[03:45:29.120 --> 03:45:33.120]  bringing you the news, all thanks to our PrisonPlanet.tv supporters
[03:45:33.120 --> 03:45:34.120]  and those who go to m4slife.com.
[03:45:34.120 --> 03:45:35.120]  So here's the article.
[03:45:35.120 --> 03:45:38.120]  This video will stop gun control if it goes viral.
[03:45:38.120 --> 03:45:43.120]  And this gun shop underreveals how you can win support for the Second Amendment.
[03:45:43.120 --> 03:45:45.120]  And that's you out there, the collective you.
[03:45:45.120 --> 03:45:47.120]  Okay, because we all need our Second Amendment.
[03:45:47.120 --> 03:45:51.120]  Let me tell you, if they take away our Second Amendment, everything else is on the line.
[03:45:51.120 --> 03:45:53.120]  Everything else is going to fall.
[03:45:53.120 --> 03:45:54.120]  Okay, and you will become a slave.
[03:45:54.120 --> 03:45:59.120]  The only reason we aren't in chains at this point and living like sheep over in Europe,
[03:45:59.120 --> 03:46:01.120]  because let me tell you, the people of Europe think they're free.
[03:46:01.120 --> 03:46:03.120]  There's no freedom in Europe.
[03:46:03.120 --> 03:46:04.120]  These are kept people.
[03:46:04.120 --> 03:46:07.120]  And I feel bad because there are a lot of good people in Europe,
[03:46:07.120 --> 03:46:10.120]  and they know what freedom is, but they don't get to experience it
[03:46:10.120 --> 03:46:13.120]  because they aren't allowed to protect themselves.
[03:46:13.120 --> 03:46:16.120]  You can't even have pepper spray in Germany.
[03:46:16.120 --> 03:46:18.120]  That's against the law.
[03:46:18.120 --> 03:46:20.120]  Any form of protecting yourself is against the law,
[03:46:20.120 --> 03:46:21.120]  and you think the cops are going to protect you.
[03:46:21.120 --> 03:46:24.120]  No, the cops were protecting the elites.
[03:46:24.120 --> 03:46:27.120]  They were behind fences protecting the elites who are having their secret meeting.
[03:46:27.120 --> 03:46:28.120]  So let's go to that interview now.
[03:46:28.120 --> 03:46:30.120]  This is Kid Daniels.
[03:46:30.120 --> 03:46:36.120]  Kid Daniels here with infowars.com in Houston, Texas, outside the Shiloh gun archery range.
[03:46:36.120 --> 03:46:41.120]  Now, this gun store recently made headlines for offering free CHL classes for the gay community
[03:46:41.120 --> 03:46:43.120]  after the Orlando shooting.
[03:46:43.120 --> 03:46:47.120]  And what was unexpected was the sheer volume of people who are interested in the classes.
[03:46:47.120 --> 03:46:50.120]  They've had hundreds of hundred people that signed up for the classes.
[03:46:50.120 --> 03:46:52.120]  Their phone lines have completely jammed.
[03:46:52.120 --> 03:46:54.120]  Their voicemails got full.
[03:46:54.120 --> 03:46:56.120]  So let's talk to the owner and find out more.
[03:46:56.120 --> 03:46:57.120]  My name is Jeff Sanford.
[03:46:57.120 --> 03:47:01.120]  I'm the general manager here at Shiloh Indoor Shooting Range in Northwest Houston.
[03:47:01.120 --> 03:47:04.120]  We're a family owned and operated shooting range.
[03:47:04.120 --> 03:47:07.120]  What kind of classes are you offering for the gay community right now?
[03:47:07.120 --> 03:47:14.120]  Well, we're doing a free license to carry class for the LGBT community because one of our customers
[03:47:14.120 --> 03:47:20.120]  and good friends of ours, his name is Ryan Thomas and we were speaking to him after Orlando happened
[03:47:20.120 --> 03:47:26.120]  and wanted to know, you know, I said, hey man, I know you carry, but we'd like to do something for your friends.
[03:47:26.120 --> 03:47:28.120]  And he was really distraught about it.
[03:47:28.120 --> 03:47:35.120]  And seeing as it was in Orlando and so far away, I personally didn't understand why he was so distraught.
[03:47:35.120 --> 03:47:40.120]  And then he explained to me that, you know, hey, these places are places that they feel like they can go anytime
[03:47:40.120 --> 03:47:43.120]  and that's the one place that they can feel totally safe.
[03:47:43.120 --> 03:47:48.120]  So even though it happens states away from us, it's affecting the community here tremendously as well.
[03:47:48.120 --> 03:47:52.120]  And so I said, well, man, let's let's do something for your friends.
[03:47:52.120 --> 03:47:56.120]  So tell some of your friends, we'll give them a free free license to carry class.
[03:47:56.120 --> 03:48:01.120]  And we thought that would be maybe one or two classes with 30 or 40 people total.
[03:48:01.120 --> 03:48:10.120]  And so far today, about two days after we announced it, we're at either approaching or just past 300 students signed up.
[03:48:10.120 --> 03:48:15.120]  What was supposed to be one or two classes is now 10 classes and about to open in 11th.
[03:48:15.120 --> 03:48:19.120]  So what kind of public response did you get from this when you announced the class?
[03:48:19.120 --> 03:48:22.120]  Most of the response has been really, really overwhelmingly positive.
[03:48:22.120 --> 03:48:27.120]  You know, there's a few detractors, but you can't do anything without having at least a few detractors.
[03:48:27.120 --> 03:48:32.120]  And, you know, it's been it's been outstanding. We've had veterans that have called and said, hey,
[03:48:32.120 --> 03:48:35.120]  we want to come up and provide security for your classes.
[03:48:35.120 --> 03:48:39.120]  We have police police officers that are off duty, spinning their off duty time up here,
[03:48:39.120 --> 03:48:43.120]  volunteering their time to come up and provide security for the classes.
[03:48:43.120 --> 03:48:47.120]  I've had license to carry instructors from all over the state giving me a call saying, hey man,
[03:48:47.120 --> 03:48:48.120]  I'll be more than happy to come up.
[03:48:48.120 --> 03:48:54.120]  I'll do anything from teaching the entire class to just pushing brass around the range when they're done shooting.
[03:48:54.120 --> 03:49:00.120]  We've had a tremendous amount of goodwill from the shooting community as a whole.
[03:49:00.120 --> 03:49:07.120]  I think everybody realizes that this is a golden opportunity for us to take what has been a small percentage
[03:49:07.120 --> 03:49:14.120]  of our population at, you know, maybe 3.8 percent and really bring them into into our world.
[03:49:14.120 --> 03:49:18.120]  You know, they have not felt safe to be able to come to a place like a shooting range.
[03:49:18.120 --> 03:49:22.120]  And while we may think, why wouldn't you feel safe to go to a shooting range?
[03:49:22.120 --> 03:49:24.120]  You know, we're great people here.
[03:49:24.120 --> 03:49:26.120]  You know, we like to be friends with everybody.
[03:49:26.120 --> 03:49:31.120]  The fact is that I've talked to 300 people and none of them, they've all told me the same thing.
[03:49:31.120 --> 03:49:34.120]  We've never felt like that's the kind of place that we would belong.
[03:49:34.120 --> 03:49:37.120]  And so we've put this off and put it off, but now we can actually do it.
[03:49:37.120 --> 03:49:42.120]  So this is a golden opportunity for us as gun owners, as second amendment advocates to say, hey,
[03:49:42.120 --> 03:49:52.120]  come join us, be part of what we do and have an entire new range of second amendment advocates out there for us.
[03:49:52.120 --> 03:50:01.120]  3.8 percent of the population takes legislation from a minor loss to a tremendous overwhelming victory
[03:50:01.120 --> 03:50:06.120]  if we can get that 3.8 percent and bring them into our world of self-defense and self-preservation.
[03:50:06.120 --> 03:50:11.120]  Have you had some people that showed up for the classes that never shot a gun before?
[03:50:11.120 --> 03:50:13.120]  Almost all of them.
[03:50:13.120 --> 03:50:19.120]  That's been the thing, you know, out of the nearly 300 people that have signed up out of all the ones that I've talked to,
[03:50:19.120 --> 03:50:24.120]  I think I've got maybe 10 that have their own firearm and have experience with a firearm.
[03:50:24.120 --> 03:50:29.120]  So we're trying to do our part to make sure that, you know, when they get their license to carry,
[03:50:29.120 --> 03:50:32.120]  you know, part of the license to carry is doing a shooting qualification.
[03:50:32.120 --> 03:50:34.120]  So we've got everybody coming.
[03:50:34.120 --> 03:50:38.120]  There you go. You can watch the rest of that video on this video is going to make the gun control.
[03:50:38.120 --> 03:50:41.120]  I forget the title of it, but it's about, okay, I'll pull it back up again.
[03:50:41.120 --> 03:50:45.120]  Anyway, that's a 3.8 percent is 12 million people.
[03:50:45.120 --> 03:50:48.120]  All right, this video will stop gun control if it goes viral.
[03:50:48.120 --> 03:50:51.120]  Hey, get your friends out there in the LGBT community.
[03:50:51.120 --> 03:50:53.120]  Get them armed, get them shooting.
[03:50:53.120 --> 03:50:56.120]  Let's take this country back with a peaceful restoration of our republic.
[03:50:56.120 --> 03:51:09.120]  Rob Do with infowords.com. We'll be right back with one more segment.
[03:51:26.120 --> 03:51:36.120]  We'll be right back with one more segment.
[03:51:57.120 --> 03:52:03.120]  Introducing vitamin mineral fusion from infowordslife.com.
[03:52:03.120 --> 03:52:11.120]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable great tasting multivitamin formula available.
[03:52:11.120 --> 03:52:22.120]  The all new vitamin mineral fusion drink mix at infowordslife.com is loaded with a full month supply of essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[03:52:22.120 --> 03:52:30.120]  In the history of infowordslife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality and so many others.
[03:52:30.120 --> 03:52:40.120]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[03:52:40.120 --> 03:52:44.120]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[03:52:44.120 --> 03:52:51.120]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[03:52:51.120 --> 03:52:54.120]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure.
[03:52:54.120 --> 03:52:57.120]  That's infowordslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.

[03:54:15.120 --> 03:54:30.120]  Rob Dew, the final segment of the fourth hour of Overdrive. It has been my pleasure to be with you this last hour.
[03:54:30.120 --> 03:54:36.120]  And remember, you can always watch video, the live video stream infowords.com forward slash show.
[03:54:36.120 --> 03:54:40.120]  Or if you're not getting this on your local radio station, tell them to pick up the fourth hour.
[03:54:40.120 --> 03:54:45.120]  The more people that hear this message will tune in and the more people will spread the word.
[03:54:45.120 --> 03:54:52.120]  Just like we played this video, the gun shop owner giving out free classes, gun classes to LGBT members.
[03:54:52.120 --> 03:55:00.120]  Okay? Just think if every gun shop did that, we'd have so many more people empowered walking around practicing the Second Amendment who wouldn't be afraid of guns,
[03:55:00.120 --> 03:55:05.120]  who wouldn't be calling for more gun control. Remember Joe Biggs went to Orlando? People were still calling for gun control.
[03:55:05.120 --> 03:55:12.120]  Even though, how did they stop that guy? Oh, they stopped him with a gun. Wow. It's amazing how that happens.
[03:55:12.120 --> 03:55:17.120]  And it's funny, the people that want gun control don't really want the government to not have guns.
[03:55:17.120 --> 03:55:24.120]  I've tweeted out pictures yesterday. Hillary Clinton surrounded by people with guns. Okay? She thinks they're great.
[03:55:24.120 --> 03:55:28.120]  When she's surrounded by people with guns, she wouldn't want those people to be taken away.
[03:55:28.120 --> 03:55:34.120]  Now, I want to stress, today is the last day. Last day, we extended it one extra day for that Tim Kennedy Special.
[03:55:34.120 --> 03:55:42.120]  15% off SuperMail Vitality, Brain Force and Secret 12 at InfowarsLife.com. It is the true Patriot Pack.
[03:55:42.120 --> 03:55:51.120]  There it is right there. SuperMail, Brain Force, Secret 12. You know, I like to say Brain Force, it's like windshield wipers for your brain.
[03:55:51.120 --> 03:56:00.120]  Alright, you got a dirty windshield? That's kind of your brain all fogged up. You take Brain Force, it just wipes your brain clean.
[03:56:00.120 --> 03:56:06.120]  It clears everything up. I don't know how it does it. I'm not a chemist. All I know is that it works.
[03:56:06.120 --> 03:56:13.120]  I take it anytime I feel like I need that extra, if I didn't get enough sleep that night, and I've seen emails from people,
[03:56:13.120 --> 03:56:21.120]  I got four hours of sleep, I took Brain Force, boom, I was awake. I thought there's a commercial out there where I was editing the Lewis Farrakhan interview.
[03:56:21.120 --> 03:56:26.120]  Didn't get to work on it all week. I had to stay here and pull an all nighter, and I did it with Brain Force.
[03:56:26.120 --> 03:56:32.120]  Let me tell you, and it's not like coffee where you get the jitters. I came in here earlier, I was having my InfowarsLife coffee,
[03:56:32.120 --> 03:56:39.120]  and it really pumps me up, but it's like almost a psychotic urge where you just want to get in there and tear people apart.
[03:56:39.120 --> 03:56:45.120]  But Brain Force is a lot more calming. It's a lot more, I'm super focused, and I'm ready to take on the New World Order.
[03:56:45.120 --> 03:56:52.120]  So get your Tim Kennedy special today, InfowarsLife.com. These are the products that Tim Kennedy uses in his Special Forces and UFC training.
[03:56:52.120 --> 03:56:58.120]  In fact, I think he's going for the middleweight championship coming up. It should be interesting to see if he's able to take it.
[03:56:58.120 --> 03:57:05.120]  He trains like a madman. We've shown you the videos, him and Shane Steiner training, and you get 15% off.
[03:57:05.120 --> 03:57:11.120]  What more do you need? And then sign up for auto-ship while you're at it, okay? You sign up for auto-ship, and then you don't have to worry about reordering.
[03:57:11.120 --> 03:57:18.120]  It just automatically comes in the mail. You get to pick how often you want your InfowarsLife products to show up in the mail.
[03:57:18.120 --> 03:57:28.120]  And with that, what were you going to end on today? I had it sitting right here in front of me, and then I moved it.
[03:57:28.120 --> 03:57:40.120]  Oh, I'm just going to look you straight in the eye and tell you why you shouldn't fall for what mainstream media is telling you.
[03:57:40.120 --> 03:57:52.120]  Because these people are funded by giant pharmaceutical companies that want you to take stuff like Prozac and stuff that alters your brain chemistry.
[03:57:52.120 --> 03:57:58.120]  And we're offering stuff that doesn't alter your brain chemistry. It helps you work at a higher level. It gives you the things your body is lacking.
[03:57:58.120 --> 03:58:03.120]  Let me tell you, you're not lacking in Prozac, okay?
[03:58:03.120 --> 03:58:10.120]  That stuff even tells you, even tells you in the fine print, it might make you want to go out and kill people or kill yourself.
[03:58:10.120 --> 03:58:18.120]  It might give you homicidal tendencies, okay? So remember that, the big pharmaceutical companies, they want to keep your mind imprisoned.
[03:58:18.120 --> 03:58:25.120]  We want to help free your mind here at Infowars.com, which is why we're here every day, Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[03:58:25.120 --> 03:58:32.120]  And then on Sundays, 4 to 6. And then at night, 7 p.m. Central, the Infowars Nightly News, tonight will be Jakari Jackson.
[03:58:32.120 --> 03:58:37.120]  Hopefully we'll have John Acoviva on with him. Sorry you couldn't make it today. That's technology for you, folks.
[03:58:37.120 --> 03:58:56.120]  Sometimes you just got to roll with the punches. Stay tuned for more. Infowars.com forward slash show for the free streams. Visit GCNLive.com today.
