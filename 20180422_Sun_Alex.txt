[00:00.000 --> 00:13.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.640]  It's Sunday the 22nd day already of April 2018. I'm your host Alex Jones. We'll be here for the next two hours
[00:38.640 --> 00:46.960]  Broadcasting worldwide on over 200 radio stations close to a hundred TV stations and of course streaming
[00:47.960 --> 00:55.080]  Over the internet live and in full wars.com forward slash show and on Twitter Facebook YouTube many other places where they're trying to censor
[00:55.080 --> 00:57.080]  But we're still there partially for now
[00:57.080 --> 01:04.600]  Let me just start the broadcast with this because I don't tend to plant the hook as they say and talk radio or TV and
[01:04.600 --> 01:10.280]  Tell you what's coming up so that you stay tuned for it. I tend to just get into whatever is most important right up front, but
[01:11.920 --> 01:14.320]  In the second hour today
[01:16.160 --> 01:20.360]  We're going to get into a high-level CIA source a
[01:23.200 --> 01:25.200]  Month ago
[01:25.200 --> 01:28.360]  That gave me really important information and
[01:29.760 --> 01:36.600]  Then other information I got from Pentagon sources State Department sources media sources that dubbed dealt with that
[01:40.440 --> 01:42.440]  And then I got
[01:42.760 --> 01:50.040]  Contacted a few days ago, and I was asked why aren't you covering this and I just said look I understand it's not a leak
[01:50.040 --> 01:56.280]  Because you're say you're authorized to tell me this and I know you are who you say you are
[01:56.280 --> 01:58.400]  I mean we're talking right up at the top
[01:59.960 --> 02:05.000]  One of the main directors and of course people in the government know it is so it's not a secret
[02:05.000 --> 02:12.040]  But I'm not gonna say and I've been asked not to but it's it's kind of a pinch yourself moment like why am I being given this information?
[02:12.040 --> 02:19.480]  Well, because I'll put it out unfiltered and because we're the number one broadcast listened to by people that know what's going on sure the average
[02:20.040 --> 02:26.040]  Yuppie or hippie or trendy be conservative or liberal. They don't listen because oh that's the show being attacked
[02:26.040 --> 02:29.960]  You know mainstream media attacks that show we like what's establishment
[02:29.960 --> 02:36.600]  But people that understand what's going on know that our guest our information our analysis is amongst the best in the world
[02:36.600 --> 02:38.600]  And so I'm gonna do my best job
[02:44.040 --> 02:46.040]  In the second hour
[02:46.040 --> 02:50.120]  When one of our sources who's separate from these sources, but it was basically
[02:50.840 --> 02:53.240]  As I sat on this info for almost a month
[02:54.440 --> 02:58.360]  I got the same info from Zach who that's his real first name
[02:58.360 --> 03:03.160]  He's been on TV been in the national news many times. He's well-known famous intelligence operative
[03:03.160 --> 03:05.480]  Now working in other areas of the government
[03:06.520 --> 03:08.520]  dealing with space and
[03:11.080 --> 03:13.080]  I just sat on the info
[03:13.560 --> 03:16.680]  And then I saw it develop in the news and then I got it from other people
[03:17.720 --> 03:20.360]  Who didn't even know I'd gotten it from so high up
[03:21.400 --> 03:23.080]  because
[03:23.080 --> 03:25.080]  My gut told me sit on it
[03:29.080 --> 03:31.080]  But there is that thing when it shows up
[03:31.080 --> 03:34.680]  But there is that thing when extraordinary things happen to somebody
[03:35.160 --> 03:39.560]  It's been said many times that extraordinary men and women aren't extraordinary. They live in extraordinary times
[03:40.200 --> 03:42.440]  And with me that's definitely what's going on here
[03:43.080 --> 03:46.360]  Um, but I know this information is important
[03:47.800 --> 03:50.440]  And it's basically this and I'll flush it out in the second hour
[03:53.320 --> 04:00.200]  The globalists are planning massive terror attacks all over the united states and all over europe to blame it
[04:00.200 --> 04:02.200]  Basically on the trump agenda
[04:03.560 --> 04:05.960]  And to make enemies of trump
[04:07.160 --> 04:09.160]  Look like victims
[04:10.600 --> 04:16.600]  Now one of these sources not the super high level but still high level was the one that told me on march 8th
[04:18.200 --> 04:20.920]  When they had that high level north korean delegation on the 7th
[04:21.960 --> 04:23.960]  Meet with the south korean delegation
[04:24.360 --> 04:29.160]  And the u.s. Intelligence was there. I was told kim jong-un has now already agreed to basically everything
[04:29.160 --> 04:31.640]  But it'll be a 10-year deal for reunification
[04:33.160 --> 04:34.520]  And a big
[04:34.520 --> 04:38.840]  Payment package to him and and I broke all that the day after and now it's in the news
[04:39.480 --> 04:41.720]  So that's how good the info is I get
[04:42.280 --> 04:44.280]  Was that level we broke that
[04:44.440 --> 04:49.000]  And I asked why am I being given this they said well so when you're given more important information
[04:49.320 --> 04:51.320]  People that are in the know will listen to you
[04:51.320 --> 04:59.320]  So this is very sophisticated and you're going to get it coming up stay with us
[04:59.560 --> 05:06.680]  I'm so excited the new product at info wars life.com in a glass bottle two month servings filled to the brim
[05:07.160 --> 05:12.760]  Filled to the absolute top the real red pill. This is a heart and brain pill
[05:13.480 --> 05:19.720]  A new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that quite frankly
[05:19.720 --> 05:23.320]  Uh, I just went off what I saw medical doctors
[05:23.960 --> 05:29.080]  prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people 100 200 dollars
[05:29.960 --> 05:31.640]  for the formulae
[05:31.640 --> 05:36.040]  And I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers non-gmo
[05:36.600 --> 05:39.560]  Made right here in america 120 capsules
[05:40.120 --> 05:42.920]  And ladies and gentlemen you add the preglenone to it
[05:43.320 --> 05:49.080]  Which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands
[05:49.080 --> 05:51.080]  It is amazing
[05:52.200 --> 05:57.320]  Red pill now available at info wars store.com and your purchase fugs the operation

[06:29.800 --> 06:37.560]  Let me do this just so you know what's up on news wars dot com and info wars dot com
[06:38.440 --> 06:43.080]  Right now. Let me just read to you some of the incredible headlines
[06:44.840 --> 06:48.600]  That we've got here isis used chemical weapons
[06:49.400 --> 06:54.520]  In syria at least 52 times u n report says new york times
[06:54.520 --> 07:03.720]  Now remember they're telling you unanimously on cnn and fox news that Assad used chemicals with no proof
[07:05.480 --> 07:09.080]  Now this is just out today by zero hedge linking to the website
[07:10.360 --> 07:14.280]  Of the opc w the western u.s european backed
[07:15.080 --> 07:17.320]  prohibition of chemical weapons organization
[07:18.680 --> 07:20.680]  The organization of prohibition of chemical weapons
[07:20.680 --> 07:24.920]  They said that they were blocked by rebel shooting at them not the russians that invited them in
[07:25.720 --> 07:31.400]  And that they are correlating data to see who launched the chemical attack and in previous reports just like the u n
[07:32.200 --> 07:35.240]  They have said that it was the rebels launching the chemical attacks not Assad
[07:35.800 --> 07:40.840]  Yeah, you can look at motive Assad's one the russians are pulling out the u.s. Is pulling out. Why would you?
[07:41.560 --> 07:43.560]  nerve gas 50 civilians
[07:45.320 --> 07:46.920]  It's amazing
[07:46.920 --> 07:51.400]  So we're gonna look at that noon as says dnc lawsuit is a scam
[07:52.040 --> 07:56.600]  Just like all these lawsuits, but they've still got to be fought, but they're total frauds on their face
[07:58.280 --> 08:04.760]  Oh and meanwhile germany's largest public tv news broadcaster says syria chemical attack most likely staged
[08:05.240 --> 08:06.520]  after they went
[08:06.520 --> 08:10.360]  To duma and also interviewed experts on the ground in syria
[08:10.360 --> 08:18.280]  And of course we have videos of people in the hospital that day saying no they came and grabbed us said you want free food
[08:18.520 --> 08:25.080]  We're gonna dump water on your head and interview kids that are on tv supposedly dead days later without the makeup on without the green makeup
[08:25.560 --> 08:31.720]  Saying no no they gave me they gave me candy bars. They gave me dates. They gave me food and said I had to be part of this
[08:31.720 --> 08:39.640]  So there you go ladies and gentlemen that is huge on that front. We're gonna be breaking that down that the whole
[08:41.160 --> 08:46.040]  Latest syria chemical attack is going like all the others to be proven to be staged
[08:47.560 --> 08:52.360]  Just like history shows just like motive shows just like fact show
[08:53.080 --> 08:59.240]  But meanwhile isis threatens satanic singing in the federal reserve universal studios
[08:59.240 --> 09:01.240]  And nasa
[09:02.600 --> 09:07.160]  So now when there's attacks you see on hollywood and the rest of it. Oh see
[09:08.040 --> 09:10.840]  hollywood are good guys people always ask why don't the terrorists
[09:11.320 --> 09:15.320]  Why don't they always target some random federal building or always target some christian church?
[09:15.320 --> 09:17.320]  Why don't they ever target the federal reserve or un?
[09:18.200 --> 09:21.160]  Well now we've got big colored photos put out by
[09:21.160 --> 09:31.720]  But put up by isis showing them shooting at cnn even though cnn backed the arab spring
[09:32.200 --> 09:36.040]  They backed the isis attacks. They they've backed the whole takeover
[09:36.680 --> 09:43.640]  Obama backed isis invading and stood down and funded them hillary did but now you see they're fighting them for tv viewers
[09:43.640 --> 09:47.240]  Let's do a document cam shot and I can show folks the entire shot. There it is
[09:47.240 --> 09:52.600]  With a so-called isis fighter with a heavy machine gun shooting at the federal reserve
[09:54.120 --> 09:58.120]  And cnn so now you see them lining up the false flags
[09:59.000 --> 10:05.480]  Against those groups to make them victims just like the feds bombed oklahoma city in 1995
[10:05.480 --> 10:08.840]  I've interviewed the witnesses the police officers everybody involved
[10:09.160 --> 10:11.960]  We know exactly how they did it and I stand by that
[10:11.960 --> 10:17.960]  But the media never challenges me on saying Oklahoma City was a false flag because they know they know who was involved
[10:18.280 --> 10:21.320]  They know who covered it up. They know exactly what happened
[10:22.040 --> 10:24.040]  So we've got that information
[10:26.600 --> 10:34.040]  Continuing worried about facebook having too much data about you google has enough to make seven foot
[10:34.680 --> 10:37.720]  Nine inch pile of paper every two weeks
[10:38.280 --> 10:40.680]  Which they then sell to the highest bidder
[10:40.680 --> 10:43.480]  Their main job is data mining
[10:44.920 --> 10:48.200]  And by the media the mainstream legacy corporate media
[10:49.240 --> 10:52.200]  By the dinosaur media focusing foolishly
[10:53.640 --> 10:55.240]  on
[10:55.240 --> 10:57.240]  Cambridge Analytica and its primitive
[10:57.800 --> 11:03.800]  Data mining just for names of conservatives to mail them letters to get them mobilized from public data mining
[11:05.160 --> 11:07.160]  The internal data mining of google
[11:07.160 --> 11:13.640]  Facebook twitter and down the line in some cases is estimated to dwarf the nsa and they
[11:14.200 --> 11:16.200]  Sell it to whoever wants it
[11:18.040 --> 11:20.760]  Isn't that just darling isn't that just sweet?
[11:22.760 --> 11:26.520]  And now it's all coming out
[11:28.120 --> 11:30.120]  For the world and everybody else
[11:31.080 --> 11:33.960]  To see I kind of like how you put the documents behind me. That's what the
[11:33.960 --> 11:40.840]  Video walls for that whenever you want just to the crew in there getting radio listeners are getting the kind of one-dimensional thing
[11:40.840 --> 11:44.760]  That's kind of more relaxing. You get to just hear the info kind of imagine it for yourself
[11:44.840 --> 11:49.160]  But if you go to info wars.com ports last show or different tv stations around the country
[11:49.400 --> 11:54.760]  You can actually see what we're talking about here on there not just believe that I'm saying it because
[11:55.320 --> 12:01.000]  I've claimed 20 years ago on radio that I had a news article saying something and people wouldn't believe me
[12:01.000 --> 12:08.360]  But nowadays well, they can all get forced to face it for themselves
[12:09.560 --> 12:13.560]  Which again really really really upsets them now. Let's move on to this piece of news
[12:14.440 --> 12:18.600]  This is the headline from the conservative tribune. I saw this on info wars.com
[12:20.360 --> 12:24.360]  And I said to myself, this is so incredible. I got to check this for myself
[12:24.360 --> 12:28.360]  This is so incredible. I got to check this for myself
[12:29.800 --> 12:31.800]  And sure enough
[12:33.880 --> 12:35.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, it was true
[12:37.640 --> 12:39.640]  It was true
[12:40.040 --> 12:41.640]  I went to
[12:41.640 --> 12:47.640]  Where they linked to in the article that's linked on info wars.com and I got the western journal
[12:47.640 --> 12:55.880]  And then it linked through to the la times assembly bill 2943 with a straight
[12:56.840 --> 12:58.840]  face
[13:01.080 --> 13:02.440]  It says
[13:02.440 --> 13:07.320]  Well, you know, we've banned using the word he or she or mother or father from government documents
[13:07.480 --> 13:11.880]  Because it might hurt someone if they have a mother or father or didn't have a mother or father
[13:11.880 --> 13:19.000]  There aren't a he or a she's got to use these weird new new science fictions sounding pronouns gz
[13:19.560 --> 13:21.560]  All the stuff that sounds like chinese
[13:22.520 --> 13:26.280]  Well, now they're saying any books that say mean things about
[13:27.160 --> 13:30.120]  Alternative lifestyles that are the now the dominant lifestyles, I guess
[13:31.160 --> 13:39.000]  Are gonna be banned just like canada's arrested hundreds of preachers that repasses out of the bible, uh, you know speaking out against homosexuality
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  So again
[13:41.240 --> 13:47.240]  Islam can do it all day, but if christians do they're going to get arrested when you think about the censorship and outright banning of books and opinions
[13:47.560 --> 13:50.760]  Do you imagine the united states of america or more likely those the kind of
[13:51.480 --> 13:56.600]  Suppression strikes you as the tactics of communists or fascists that america has frequently fought against
[13:57.720 --> 14:00.280]  If a liberal lawmaker in california gets their way
[14:00.760 --> 14:05.960]  The west coast state may be one step closer and it's always like one person, but then a few years later, it's law
[14:05.960 --> 14:11.720]  One step closer to being unrecognizable as part of the united states a bill currently pending
[14:12.120 --> 14:18.120]  In the legislature would essentially ban the sale of books that include traditional christian views on marriage and sexuality
[14:18.440 --> 14:21.800]  And I've looked at the bill shockingly the proposed law would be
[14:22.680 --> 14:27.960]  Strude to make it illegal to sell bibles since they include verses that far left finds
[14:28.600 --> 14:31.560]  Unacceptable. Let's look at the actual text of the bill
[14:32.520 --> 14:34.520]  assembly bill
[14:34.520 --> 14:42.520]  Assembly bill 2943 would make it an unlawful business practice to engage in a transaction intended to result
[14:43.000 --> 14:50.280]  Or the results in the sale that leads to goods or services to a consumer that advertises offers or engages in or do engage in
[14:50.680 --> 14:52.280]  sexual orientation
[14:52.280 --> 14:53.800]  change efforts
[14:53.800 --> 14:55.480]  with an individual
[14:55.480 --> 14:57.480]  explained the national review
[14:58.600 --> 15:00.600]  And it goes into how that what that
[15:00.600 --> 15:03.720]  What language means but but let's explain this
[15:05.400 --> 15:08.200]  It's just like all the lawsuits going on
[15:09.480 --> 15:11.480]  in the country because
[15:11.720 --> 15:13.720]  a hotel won't let
[15:13.960 --> 15:15.720]  people have a
[15:15.720 --> 15:17.160]  Gay orgy
[15:17.160 --> 15:21.320]  Now the very same hotel won't let there be a heterosexual orgy too. They find out
[15:21.320 --> 15:26.280]  There's swinger parties going on the 10th floor every saturday night. You see that the news all time. It's banned
[15:26.280 --> 15:31.720]  But when there's a gay orgy, oh, you got to keep it or you don't bake a gay couple's cake five hundred thousand dollars
[15:32.040 --> 15:34.440]  But if you're a christian or conservative, you can be banned off the web
[15:34.440 --> 15:40.040]  That's what this is and it deals with literature and that if oh somebody sold literature
[15:40.040 --> 15:42.040]  Well, the lawyers just buy the literature
[15:42.280 --> 15:46.280]  Then they follow suit on you under the law and take you before a judge and a jury
[15:46.280 --> 15:50.120]  That's how they want to ban the bible and the sale of the bible in california
[15:50.120 --> 15:55.000]  It's already happening in europe when we come back ladies and gentlemen get ready for the next piece
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  of news

[17:01.000 --> 17:05.000]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another hitler
[17:05.000 --> 17:13.000]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again
[17:13.000 --> 17:19.000]  They use their ex-president to endorse the resistance all to make them march make them protest
[17:19.000 --> 17:28.000]  Make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports
[17:28.000 --> 17:36.000]  Bullying terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  And when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage
[17:40.000 --> 17:51.000]  The only way we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth
[17:51.000 --> 18:11.000]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm freedom's safest place
[18:21.000 --> 18:27.000]  Perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts and entire meals
[18:27.000 --> 18:33.000]  Woo that's what I'm talking about and when compared to traditional methods of preservation like canning or dehydrating
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  You know like what you get at the grocery store there is no comparison
[18:37.000 --> 18:47.000]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.000]  Harvest right is truly the world's best most affordable freeze dryer
[18:55.000 --> 19:18.000]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com
[19:18.000 --> 19:25.000]  I have a noticeable difference I don't feel good the nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me
[19:25.000 --> 19:31.000]  Yeah I've actually have just run out of my superfemale I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again
[19:31.000 --> 19:40.000]  Hitting the gym once again very exciting feeling great looking good and I know my hair is luxurious once again
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  So obviously the superfemale is amazing I love it
[19:43.000 --> 19:50.000]  Nascent iodine is essential survival shield X2 if there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest
[19:50.000 --> 20:02.000]  It's nascent iodine survival shield X2 it's got a five star rating it's a win-win InfoWarsLive.com
[20:02.000 --> 20:12.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:12.000 --> 20:25.000]  We are on the march the empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[20:25.000 --> 20:33.000]  It's called lying by omission it's how you distort the facts it's how you create false illusions
[20:33.000 --> 20:40.000]  And there's an InfoWars.com article that's dead center right in the middle of the site right now I'm going to cover in a moment
[20:40.000 --> 20:53.000]  OOP pushes gun control in national survey and they gave you choices on the type of gun control you'd like instead of no gun control
[20:53.000 --> 21:01.000]  I guess you could kind of call that a push pull but it's beyond that where you don't have any choice but to basically act like people want gun control
[21:01.000 --> 21:07.000]  There's no pro-second amendment box you can check and that's how this works
[21:07.000 --> 21:13.000]  Now coming up in the last segment of this hour
[21:13.000 --> 21:25.000]  I remember reading in the Baltimore Sun 1617 years ago an article that I couldn't believe was in the mainstream news
[21:25.000 --> 21:38.000]  About the CIA and DARPA admitting a plan to use shell towers and cell phones to broadcast a certain wavelength to put people into a trance state
[21:38.000 --> 21:46.000]  And right around that time I remember hearing Dr. Nick Baggich on coast to coast AM when Art Bell God rest his soul just died last week
[21:46.000 --> 21:57.000]  He was a broadcaster, he'd mixed them with UFOs and funny stuff but I remember Nick Baggich, Dabba was a congressman, brother, senator but later
[21:57.000 --> 22:06.000]  But he was covering patents and the internet was around then I would go look up the patent and see that it was true for cell phones and cell towers
[22:06.000 --> 22:14.000]  With patented tests where they could put you into a trance state, make you more aggressive can basically just influence you
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  They admit solar waves can do it but to a limited extent
[22:17.000 --> 22:25.000]  But cell phones powerfully, well it turns out popular mechanics and others on Friday came out and reported on all this
[22:25.000 --> 22:32.000]  The US government classifies remote mind control using cell towers and cell phones
[22:32.000 --> 22:41.000]  Very, very interesting article, government releases documents, they're now saying accidentally, on psychoelectric weapons
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.000]  Including cell phones, so we're going to get into those documents the last second of the summer
[22:46.000 --> 22:54.000]  And for us here this is old news but that's why they hate info war so much
[22:54.000 --> 23:03.000]  Because this was in the patent office and Dabba admitted they were doing all this earlier
[23:03.000 --> 23:09.000]  How do we focus that bad boy, he used to focus, again if you're on TV I'm directing the show
[23:09.000 --> 23:15.000]  I wonder why I won't do that, getting closer it will, I guess that's the answer, here we go
[23:15.000 --> 23:19.000]  But look at this article from a month ago, I pulled this because it ties into it
[23:19.000 --> 23:30.000]  AI will be billions of times smarter than humans and we need to merge with it says expert at World Government Summit in Dubai
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.000]  Now they've been having world government summits for at least 30 years I know of with world leaders
[23:35.000 --> 23:42.000]  But no one will cover it, my sin, the reason they're trying to destroy me all over the media
[23:42.000 --> 23:50.000]  Misrepresenting what I say and do is because they know I'm covering topics that they want to bring out later
[23:50.000 --> 23:58.000]  Once they've spun it and once it's ubiquitous, once it's already in place, once it can't be challenged or not as easily challenged
[23:58.000 --> 24:06.000]  So they're really really upset, the good news is despite all the disinfo campaigns they're running against me
[24:06.000 --> 24:14.000]  I'm only second to Trump, people come up to me all over the street and they say listen we know mainstream media lies
[24:14.000 --> 24:19.000]  We know it's out of context what they do, we understand, we appreciate you, keep at it
[24:19.000 --> 24:26.000]  Well I'm going to keep at it regardless because I know how bad the globalist are but that really actually takes it from a duty to something that's a pleasure
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.000]  So thank you all for understanding that we are under attack
[24:31.000 --> 24:40.000]  I know we can win the war against the globalist, individually who knows what will happen with us, here at InfoWars down the road
[24:40.000 --> 24:46.000]  But if we lose this fight we lose everything, so I'm going to lose my family, my children, everything
[24:46.000 --> 24:51.000]  I've already tried to take my kids away, you've seen the demonization campaigns, you've seen the media, all of it
[24:51.000 --> 24:57.000]  You've seen the lies but I understand that if we don't get out of here together we don't get out
[24:57.000 --> 25:07.000]  So it's not heroics, I don't say it to be self deprecating, if it was heroics it would be easy because it's just one person could do it or a few people
[25:07.000 --> 25:15.000]  It's a cultural issue and the globalists have got a bunch of yes men and women
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.000]  They've got a bunch of cowards and people that roll over
[25:20.000 --> 25:28.000]  And I'm not going to roll over, so in the last segment of this hour I'm going to get into what they tell you in Hollywood movies like the Kingsman
[25:28.000 --> 25:39.000]  Like they send a wavelength out on the cell phones that first hypnotizes you with the screen wavelength, the flicker rate and a digital feedback
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.000]  And then when they've got you under hypnosis then they can program you to kill each other
[25:44.000 --> 25:50.000]  And that's a metaphor of how cell phones make you more lonely, more depressed, lower your brain waves but also make you more aggressive
[25:50.000 --> 25:56.000]  But now in declassified DARPA documents
[25:56.000 --> 26:03.000]  They talk about data over power lines, they can broadcast from those, they're just big antennas to make you do it
[26:03.000 --> 26:11.000]  So cell phones just kind of dial you in and get you hypnotized so the big transmitters can get you
[26:11.000 --> 26:20.000]  And that's interviewing top scientists, top scientists
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  So that's coming up, since I mentioned this so let me get to it right now
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.000]  GOP pushes gun control in National Survey, infowars.com story
[26:29.000 --> 26:32.000]  This is not how to win a conservative over the sub headline says
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.000]  A National Survey commissioned by the Republican Party asks what issues are most important to Americans
[26:37.000 --> 26:43.000]  And includes two boxes that say gun control and zero boxes that say Second Amendment
[26:43.000 --> 26:50.000]  And that way when they bring back 20-30% as we know conservatives say that oh they want more gun control
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  They don't even say oh but 90% say they don't want it, see how that works?
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  They lie by omission
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.000]  A survey from Pennsylvania's 7th District shows a series of questions asking citizens
[27:00.000 --> 27:08.000]  What the most important issue is for them for President Trump to address including secure our nation's border and address national opioid crisis
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.000]  See they're going to bring this to them, nothing about Second Amendment because it's not there
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.000]  They'll say sir 30% of your constituents want more gun control
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  It's all how the questions ask
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  But the next session asks what issues are most important to you
[27:23.000 --> 27:30.000]  Which includes two gun control tally boxes and zero boxes for the Second Amendment
[27:30.000 --> 27:36.000]  And you can see it right there in the document cam shot for everyone
[27:36.000 --> 27:43.000]  So again ladies and gentlemen this is how dumb they think you are
[27:43.000 --> 27:48.000]  But this is the nature of it, it's kind of like they send these polls out and say
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.000]  Do you support keeping children safe?
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  Like 20 questions
[27:53.000 --> 27:57.000]  You say yes yes yes at the end it says do you support more gun control
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.000]  They'll call it a gun control poll
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.000]  It'll be conducted by a gun control group through a polling agency
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  But because they put one gun control question in there it doesn't matter how they ask
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.000]  The question it doesn't matter how you answered it
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  It's just they call it a gun control poll
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  And so they'll say 95% of people are concerned with children's safety
[28:22.000 --> 28:26.000]  They don't tell you the 20th question or the 19th question was about gun control
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  So the people said well I do care about kids safety, I do care about the education
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  I do care about them not being hurt, I do care
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  Oh here's question 19
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  Do you support restricting the Second Amendment or do you restrict taking high capacity magazines
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  And then 80% say no it doesn't matter
[28:42.000 --> 28:48.000]  Still they can say in a gun control poll 90% agree we should keep kids safer
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  That's all about deception
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  The big question is why are the Republicans sending out this type of crap
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.000]  And the answer is we got Democrat moles
[28:58.000 --> 29:04.000]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and Biotru Selenium

[33:01.000 --> 33:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:10.000 --> 33:22.000]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear
[33:22.000 --> 33:48.000]  He is Alex Jones
[33:48.000 --> 33:55.000]  Alex Jones
[33:55.000 --> 34:01.000]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm
[34:01.000 --> 34:06.000]  to marry stories like the Clinton body count story that's according to website Infowars
[34:06.000 --> 34:19.000]  It's confirmed there are at least some shooters to the fully automatic weapons
[34:19.000 --> 34:28.000]  It was almost as if it were a planned infusion, it just panicked
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.000]  I think this is a national security imperative
[34:31.000 --> 34:38.000]  It's clear things that we do not understand how they work, operating in areas that we can't control
[34:38.000 --> 34:39.000]  UFOs
[34:39.000 --> 34:44.000]  Is this global governance at last? Is it one world with central bankers in charge?
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.000]  Israel claims the attack was accidental, but some former US naval officers say it was on purpose
[34:49.000 --> 34:53.000]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.000]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.000]  Russia didn't stop, denied everything, called it all fake news
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.000]  And he accused CNN of being fake news
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  This is an information if they kill Trump or remove Trump
[35:09.000 --> 35:13.000]  It will cause a massive civil war in this country
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  This is a theme to high rambling
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  We are at war with Russia
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.000]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  The White House and the President are citing Infowars
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  They could shut us down, you're next
[35:29.000 --> 35:34.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.000]  It's Alex Jones
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live
[35:48.000 --> 35:55.000]  I don't want to sit here and talk about Infowars and make it about us, but the mainstream corporate media already does that
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  You've got to ask yourself why
[35:57.000 --> 36:02.000]  Every major newspaper, every major local TV station that's globalist controlled
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  The vast majority of them, every major TV network
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.000]  Says we need to be shut down, we're racist, we're Russian spies
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  We're attacking, shooting families, victims
[36:14.000 --> 36:19.000]  We're saying nobody died in Parkland, none of that's true
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  What are they still scared of?
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.000]  And if you know that, you know the answer to their weak spot
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  And that's what's so frustrating to me
[36:31.000 --> 36:37.000]  Is it okay? Maybe I'm above average back when I was an old athletics
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  Or maybe I was above average at public speaking
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  But I'm not that special
[36:43.000 --> 36:48.000]  And I read the Council on Foreign Relations publications that are public
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  I've read the UN documents
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  I've read what David Rockefeller wrote in three of his books
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  I've read what Mao Zedong wrote in his books
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  I've read what Adolf Hitler wrote in his books
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  I mean, I like to read what dictators actually say
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  And the public's so ignorant
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  If you're at the library checking out a Mao Zedong book or an Adolf Hitler book
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  He wrote a couple books, not just Mein Kampf, Mein Struggle
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.000]  They look at you like, you're crazy
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  It's like in a Mike Judge, my good buddy's film, Idiocracy
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  The guy can talk in the future 200 years from now
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  And the judges are like
[37:23.000 --> 37:28.000]  What is going on? What is going on with this guy?
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  And that's what's frustrating is there's a global government
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.000]  It's tax-free, it's corporate, it's anti-free market
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  It's anti-freedom, it's anti-western
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  Because the West is about being open and free
[37:44.000 --> 37:49.000]  It's authoritarian, it's really creepy
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  And it's coming down on us
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  And if you look at Davos and Bilderberg and all these public groups
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.000]  That they said weren't public, like Bilderberg just a few years ago
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.000]  They wouldn't admit that world government existed a few years ago
[38:04.000 --> 38:10.000]  Look at how far we've come
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.000]  And so they act like I'm a weirdo
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  Because I've actually read what the global is planned to do
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  And it's even crazier what they're doing
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  See, when I read the World Government Conference in Dubai
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.000]  With major world leaders there, and Elon Musk and Bill Gates and everybody
[38:31.000 --> 38:38.000]  And Elon Musk is like, I disagree with the elite, we shouldn't kill everybody
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  And then the other billionaires say, no, we should
[38:42.000 --> 38:52.000]  That's what 19 years ago Bill Joy warned about in a major publication, Wired Magazine
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.000]  Why the future doesn't need us, I mean, these decisions have been made
[38:57.000 --> 39:02.000]  And we sit here like morons not doing anything about it
[39:02.000 --> 39:09.000]  And the establishment thought you were so dumb that for the 18 years of my 23 years on air
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  They just ignored us
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  We were bigger overall reach
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.000]  I get the numbers two years ago than we are now
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  We're about the size we were four years ago because of the censorship
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  I'll let the enemy know they've had an effect
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.000]  Only weapon I have is the truth
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  But if they let us out in the open, we obviously dominate
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  Just because we're covering real stuff, we take their own admissions and show people
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  But it's all over the news
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.000]  Oh, Jones suddenly got big and was under scrutiny and Jones is being sued for this and that
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  They're all fake lawsuits, none of it's even real
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  They're being thrown out on a weekly basis, it still costs money to do that though
[39:46.000 --> 39:53.000]  But the issue is they now have to have CNBC articles admitting world government
[39:53.000 --> 40:00.000]  With a plan to live forever and to reduce the world population by 90% is the religion
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  And that's all I'm saying
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.000]  And the globalists think I'm an idiot, they don't have any confidence in you
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.000]  Just like they didn't care if this info was known 20 years ago
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  They thought nobody'd pick it up or nobody'd listen
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  Now they still don't care and think anything of you
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.000]  And they're publicly admitting everything I told you
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  Like you're not going to do anything
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  And I just keep thinking you're like me and you want freedom in the future
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  And don't want to live under authoritarianism
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  But so many of you, because you get a little bit more Google money with your YouTube account
[40:31.000 --> 40:36.000]  Or a little more Twitter, you don't get any money, but more bots tweet you, they're fake people
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  They're fake friends, but you feel like you're having an effect
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.000]  If you say something anti-free market, anti-American, anti-family, anti-Holics Jones
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.000]  Anti-free speech
[40:47.000 --> 40:54.000]  And I'm like, are the globalists right? The public's really this bad, really this weak, really this stupid
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  And they don't want to have a future?
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  So I'm not upset that I'm being attacked
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  We're actually, in many ways, getting bigger and stronger because of it
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  And now another upward trend the last few months
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  I mean, I said we'd kind of peaked a few years ago, and they sensed that we were going down
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.000]  Now the massive attacks were going way back up
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.000]  But it doesn't matter, they know people that are already awake are already awake
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  They don't care, it's meant to inoculate people psychologically who hear us or see us
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  To just ignore it, it's like Stephen Colbert
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  They had this cartoon they ran last week of me
[41:29.000 --> 41:34.000]  Where I go, there's fluoride in the water and the aliens will crawl up your rear end if you drink it
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.000]  Harvard admits the fluoride gives you cancer and lowers your IQ massively
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  Don't believe me, but see Colbert, everything on Colbert is
[41:42.000 --> 41:47.000]  The waters find a drink, drink the fluoride, nothing's wrong with the frogs
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  They know they're getting you
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  Now there it is
[41:51.000 --> 41:58.000]  I caught them in a fluoride hot tub, devil worship in the fluoride
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  And it's like God Almighty, they know exactly what they're doing
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  So hey, your 10-year-old gets cancer, just remember
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  Or you get sterilized or whatever
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  They're not playing games here folks, they mean business, business
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  So I didn't get to this big news, but I'll try to
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.000]  China's dictator says Internet control, key to stability, Reuters
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  There's just a Reuters article about how everybody needs to censor the web
[42:22.000 --> 42:28.000]  And he praises the West for censorship and says, stop criticizing us for censorship
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  And now if you want to have a great future, just shut the people up
[42:31.000 --> 42:34.000]  But China with its mobile execution vans and
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  Buddhists get put in death camps and their organs taken
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  And the West's like, hey, it's a good thing
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  But they all go do yoga all day and worship yogis
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  But they're like, but we need to kill Buddhists
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  And you're like, okay, so it's all coming up
[42:50.000 --> 42:55.000]  But first, the government leaks DARPA documents on cell phones and mind controls
[42:55.000 --> 43:20.000]  And how many babies are dead
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  Probiotic Fur Emo homemade fiber
[43:22.000 --> 43:27.480]  bacteria to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and
[43:27.480 --> 43:29.760]  even support your immune system.

[43:42.240 --> 43:49.160]  organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon

[44:02.760 --> 44:09.520]  cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[44:09.520 --> 44:15.480]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, carnivore, for being able to break down meat
[44:15.480 --> 44:21.960]  other proteins better, and then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic
[44:21.960 --> 44:27.360]  culture of the very best strains in fluorolive advanced restoration.
[44:27.360 --> 44:32.920]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable fluorolive everyday maintenance, but all of
[44:32.920 --> 44:41.280]  these are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely
[44:41.280 --> 44:42.800]  affordable price.
[44:42.800 --> 44:48.560]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[44:48.560 --> 44:53.600]  When you purchase it at infowarsstore.com, you know you are also financing the attack
[44:53.600 --> 44:57.600]  on the globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[44:57.600 --> 45:04.760]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still
[45:04.760 --> 45:07.720]  maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[45:07.720 --> 45:08.720]  That's right.
[45:08.720 --> 45:13.440]  It's time to build your own food storage with Harvest Wright's Freeze Dryers.

[45:18.640 --> 45:24.040]  that's easy to use, and let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze-drying fruits, vegetables,
[45:24.040 --> 45:27.240]  meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[45:27.240 --> 45:28.960]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about.
[45:28.960 --> 45:33.960]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[45:33.960 --> 45:37.960]  you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[45:37.960 --> 45:43.800]  Harvest Wright Freeze Dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[45:43.800 --> 45:47.280]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[45:47.280 --> 45:50.720]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[45:50.720 --> 45:54.840]  Harvest Wright is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[45:54.840 --> 45:55.840]  So what are you waiting for?
[45:55.840 --> 45:58.800]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[45:58.800 --> 46:01.600]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[46:01.600 --> 46:03.960]  It's Myco ZX Plus.
[46:03.960 --> 46:09.160]  More price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed to your contract with an even bigger,
[46:09.160 --> 46:12.120]  organic manufacturer and producer.
[46:12.120 --> 46:13.120]  Scalability.
[46:13.120 --> 46:18.840]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off because there's a
[46:18.840 --> 46:21.880]  lot of product and a lot of ingredient, Myco ZX.
[46:21.880 --> 46:23.400]  Now it's the other side of the equation.
[46:23.400 --> 46:27.560]  Everybody thinks about probiotics, now great they are for your gut because of toxins in
[46:27.560 --> 46:31.840]  the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics
[46:31.840 --> 46:36.520]  help displace, yeast mold creates slime walls.
[46:36.520 --> 46:41.040]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes
[46:41.040 --> 46:42.040]  all sorts of serious issues.
[46:42.040 --> 46:46.760]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy
[46:46.760 --> 46:48.760]  that slime wall.
[46:48.760 --> 46:51.080]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[46:51.080 --> 47:02.800]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Myco ZX Plus now from the InfoWars store.
[47:02.800 --> 47:21.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.200 --> 47:36.520]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on
[47:36.520 --> 47:37.520]  and do nothing.
[47:37.520 --> 47:38.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[47:38.520 --> 47:39.520]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[47:39.520 --> 47:40.520]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:40.520 --> 48:01.520]  The fighting is now close at hand, pray to God, let's crank this part up, and don't
[48:01.520 --> 48:10.360]  believe the church and state, believe in God, I'm with the high command, can you feel it?
[48:10.360 --> 48:18.680]  Myco the Mechanics, there's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway, used only in emergency.
[48:18.680 --> 48:25.160]  I already took my iodine this morning, but I was talking to scientists, engineers, oil
[48:25.160 --> 48:30.240]  company folks just yesterday dealing with the shortages of X2, I'm going to get to the
[48:30.240 --> 48:33.520]  big news here.
[48:33.520 --> 48:38.240]  And I'm like, listen, our quest seven, eight years ago, knowing the iodine conspiracy that
[48:38.240 --> 48:42.800]  iodine deficiency is causing the goiters, the brain damage, the lower IQs, they put
[48:42.800 --> 48:47.400]  the bad halogen, the fluoride in the water, we've got to get a better source.
[48:47.400 --> 48:53.240]  And we use seaweed before, but it's not that pure because of iodine bounds or binds with
[48:53.240 --> 48:55.960]  many different things, it doesn't get absorbed by the body.
[48:55.960 --> 49:00.840]  We got a deep earth crystal source from gas drilling, seven to 12,000 feet where they
[49:00.840 --> 49:01.840]  find it.
[49:01.840 --> 49:05.880]  It's very hard to get the oil companies to stop and extract it for you, but we did.
[49:05.880 --> 49:12.080]  It goes into a palm oil solution and doesn't make you sick, at least in my case, many others,
[49:12.080 --> 49:13.080]  when you take it.
[49:13.080 --> 49:15.320]  So it's got five star reviews.
[49:15.320 --> 49:19.440]  I would tell everybody the stuff they mix with alcohol, whatever iodine does with that,
[49:19.440 --> 49:23.160]  all these folks that claim to have atomic iodine, it is not atomic iodine.
[49:23.160 --> 49:26.640]  Remember BuzzFeed had our stuff tested and said, it's not sodium iodine, it's not these
[49:26.640 --> 49:33.800]  other five times, it's just pure iodine, it's just pure, it's elemental.
[49:33.800 --> 49:36.600]  Yeah, nobody else has got that.
[49:36.600 --> 49:39.760]  So, it's gone way up on our price to get it.
[49:39.760 --> 49:41.760]  We may only have two more runs of it and that's it.
[49:41.760 --> 49:47.120]  I'm looking for other sources right now, but this may be the end of X2 and I hope it isn't,
[49:47.120 --> 49:49.680]  at least for a while, infoworksstore.com.
[49:49.680 --> 49:50.680]  It's still 25% off.
[49:50.680 --> 49:53.960]  We're about to sell out of it, but I got a rush shipment from the factory, it'll be
[49:53.960 --> 49:56.280]  months till we get more.
[49:56.280 --> 49:59.200]  Find out what X2 will do for you and your family.
[49:59.200 --> 50:06.040]  Even beyond secret 12, it's a great pure vitamin B12, methylcobalamin.
[50:06.040 --> 50:10.080]  And one other type, it's organic, it'll be uploaded, but it's 80% methylcobalamin, acetamylcobalamin,
[50:10.080 --> 50:12.720]  I can't pronounce them all.
[50:12.720 --> 50:16.640]  X2 is the pure 999999 halogen.
[50:16.640 --> 50:20.280]  Stuff we get explodes in the purple gas outside the test tube, that's being injected into
[50:20.280 --> 50:21.280]  palm oil.
[50:21.280 --> 50:22.360]  I mean, it's the real deal.
[50:22.360 --> 50:26.120]  The other iodine, it's your myrologist, sit there, it's like just black dirt.
[50:26.120 --> 50:29.640]  This is purple crystals, well I just showed it to your TV viewer.
[50:29.640 --> 50:36.600]  And what it does is amazing because it goes into your body live and I'm exhausted, whatever.
[50:36.600 --> 50:37.600]  Got stuff going on.
[50:37.600 --> 50:38.600]  Boom!
[50:38.600 --> 50:39.600]  Energy, 30 minutes later.
[50:39.600 --> 50:42.800]  It's, there's nothing like, it's downright incredible.
[50:42.800 --> 50:48.120]  It's available at infoworksstore.com or AAA2533139.
[50:48.120 --> 50:53.280]  We've also got specials with the real red pill, alpha power, you name it, with X2's,
[50:53.280 --> 50:58.160]  supermail vitality, 50% off by itself or when you get it, and free shipping, when you
[50:58.160 --> 50:59.880]  get supermail and the real red pill together.
[50:59.880 --> 51:05.080]  So that's another $6, $7 value on top of it, sounding for auto-ship, an additional 10%
[51:05.080 --> 51:07.560]  off, but here's the deal.
[51:07.560 --> 51:12.960]  Just like our information is game changing, what we do with these products is game changing.
[51:12.960 --> 51:18.320]  So you're not just supporting the very front lines of the resistance.
[51:18.320 --> 51:19.320]  And by the way, I'm no hero.
[51:19.320 --> 51:20.680]  You couldn't drag me away from this.
[51:20.680 --> 51:21.680]  I love it.
[51:21.680 --> 51:23.120]  I'm not living a boring life here.
[51:23.120 --> 51:24.840]  I'm having an effect on the world.
[51:24.840 --> 51:26.920]  I feel good, the spirit of God.
[51:26.920 --> 51:30.240]  And then by that, people say God fearing, it means, God fearing means you feel God's
[51:30.240 --> 51:31.240]  spirit.
[51:31.240 --> 51:33.600]  You do something bad, you feel it when you do something good, it's like, man, I feel
[51:33.600 --> 51:38.600]  really God feels good about what I'm doing, your discernment increases, it's magic.
[51:38.600 --> 51:41.440]  Not the devil's magic, God's magic.
[51:41.440 --> 51:42.940]  And there's a big difference.
[51:42.940 --> 51:46.240]  So I'm just inviting people to financially support us at infoworksstore.com.
[51:46.240 --> 51:50.920]  Okay, that said, I'll have to cover this more tomorrow because I did a bunch of research
[51:50.920 --> 51:54.160]  the last few days on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday to cover this.
[51:54.160 --> 51:59.200]  And Nico Acosta, our lead producer emailed me and a text message me yesterday, he said,
[51:59.200 --> 52:00.200]  why didn't you cover this?
[52:00.200 --> 52:02.800]  This is everything you've been talking about, Nick Begge.
[52:02.800 --> 52:04.880]  And I said, I actually had it in my stack.
[52:04.880 --> 52:05.880]  I didn't cover it.
[52:05.880 --> 52:07.480]  I'll cover it Sunday.
[52:07.480 --> 52:12.640]  But this is something I can spend a whole hour on because I've had the engineers on.
[52:12.640 --> 52:14.760]  I've had the physicists on.
[52:14.760 --> 52:15.960]  I've had the scientists on.
[52:15.960 --> 52:17.080]  I've had the doctors on.
[52:17.080 --> 52:19.560]  I've had the CIA people on.
[52:19.560 --> 52:22.640]  I've had them all on.
[52:22.640 --> 52:29.720]  And they said, listen, 2001, a space Odyssey, if you look at the screen of the phone or
[52:29.720 --> 52:31.520]  the screen or movie screen, that's what it is.
[52:31.520 --> 52:37.480]  It's telling you that's the obelisk.
[52:37.480 --> 52:38.480]  That's the obelisk.
[52:38.480 --> 52:48.920]  And I remember 20 years ago being told it's the dimensions of a 35 millimeter or 80 millimeter
[52:48.920 --> 52:49.920]  thing.
[52:49.920 --> 52:54.080]  And the obelisk is a screen turned upwards.
[52:54.080 --> 52:57.560]  And again, I'm not that smart because I'm a conduit.
[52:57.560 --> 53:03.120]  It's kind of the oracle is a, you know, high on gas out of a volcano.
[53:03.120 --> 53:04.120]  Not that I am.
[53:04.120 --> 53:08.280]  It's just projecting out from the ether, the information.
[53:08.280 --> 53:09.280]  That's all info wars is.
[53:09.280 --> 53:11.400]  It's kind of a crossroads of all this.
[53:11.400 --> 53:13.480]  And yes, we are an oracle.
[53:13.480 --> 53:14.480]  That's why they hate us.
[53:14.480 --> 53:20.080]  Simple wars is a real oracle of all the guests we have and all the collars and all the freedom.
[53:20.080 --> 53:22.280]  That's an oracle.
[53:22.280 --> 53:28.920]  And sometimes it's dark, sometimes it's light, but it's a true attempt at thought.
[53:28.920 --> 53:32.840]  And so that's why they hate us because the globals are all about dialing that down because
[53:32.840 --> 53:39.120]  if there's an oracle, if there's a free channel open, it's going to like dominoes, maybe queue
[53:39.120 --> 53:46.720]  up, V for Vendetta domino scene where he goes, all the dominoes go, and like the cops
[53:46.720 --> 53:48.520]  asked V, they go, why did you do this before?
[53:48.520 --> 53:51.560]  And he goes, I was waiting for you.
[53:51.560 --> 53:54.800]  Why didn't I do it before I was waiting for you?
[53:54.800 --> 53:56.200]  You were waiting for me.
[53:56.200 --> 54:01.480]  That's the whole point is they want to intimidate us to shut us down.
[54:01.480 --> 54:07.760]  But I did have people from the Defense Department, people from the CIA high level till it got
[54:07.760 --> 54:08.760]  ridiculous.
[54:08.760 --> 54:13.360]  So you come on here and say this, and it was so over the top the last month that I didn't
[54:13.360 --> 54:14.480]  cover it.
[54:14.480 --> 54:19.320]  And then I got some final calls and I saw some final news and I just felt the time was
[54:19.320 --> 54:27.080]  right to tell you this stuff when we start the next hour.
[54:27.080 --> 54:32.760]  But the globalists are getting ready to stage terror attacks against themselves to make themselves
[54:32.760 --> 54:40.160]  victims, Hollywood, CNN, Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, I mean, it's happening now.
[54:40.160 --> 54:43.560]  The deep state doesn't mean those groups are part of it, but the deep state is loading
[54:43.560 --> 54:47.240]  the truck bombs right now with the ammonium nitrate.
[54:47.240 --> 54:51.720]  They're winding it up like 1995 when the states were pulling out of the UN and globalism
[54:51.720 --> 54:53.240]  and America was awakening.
[54:53.240 --> 54:55.360]  They're loading it all up right now.
[54:55.360 --> 54:56.360]  Have your cameras ready.
[54:56.360 --> 54:58.160]  Be on the ground when explosions go off.
[54:58.160 --> 54:59.640]  Get your cameras to the scene.
[54:59.640 --> 55:01.120]  That's why they hate this broadcast.
[55:01.120 --> 55:02.920]  You can duplicate no matter what they do to us.
[55:02.920 --> 55:05.320]  You can duplicate what they fear.
[55:05.320 --> 55:06.320]  You're better than us.
[55:06.320 --> 55:11.720]  There are people watching and listening right now way better than me.
[55:11.720 --> 55:17.240]  And just on cue, I was told a month ago, well, three and a half weeks ago that CNN will become
[55:17.240 --> 55:22.840]  an ISIS target, liberal groups will, they'll stage attacks against themselves.
[55:22.840 --> 55:26.240]  Then they will have an EMP strike.
[55:26.240 --> 55:30.600]  They'll claim North Korea did it and Trump did it because he didn't do the peace deal.
[55:30.600 --> 55:32.760]  And then they'll start World War three.
[55:32.760 --> 55:36.520]  Well that's all starting and it's scary as whatever.
[55:36.520 --> 55:39.160]  And maybe the EMP all was given was to manipulate me.
[55:39.160 --> 55:41.880]  I just have to now tell you, I don't know what to make of it.
[55:41.880 --> 55:45.880]  I'm trying to figure it out myself to everybody else as a talking pointer and agenda or they
[55:45.880 --> 55:47.240]  act like they know it all.
[55:47.240 --> 55:48.240]  I know a lot.
[55:48.240 --> 55:49.240]  Okay.
[55:49.240 --> 55:50.240]  I know a lot.
[55:50.240 --> 55:52.360]  I don't know 10%.
[55:52.360 --> 55:54.960]  They said the master knows they're the student.
[55:54.960 --> 56:01.360]  So I, at this point, my gut though, my subconscious is more powerful than my conscience than my
[56:01.360 --> 56:02.720]  conscious mind.
[56:02.720 --> 56:05.600]  It says go with this.
[56:05.600 --> 56:07.360]  So my gut says, say all this.
[56:07.360 --> 56:09.600]  I don't even know what I'm saying.
[56:09.600 --> 56:11.120]  You understand?
[56:11.120 --> 56:13.560]  I'm just saying my gut says go with this.
[56:13.560 --> 56:14.800]  I'm going now.
[56:14.800 --> 56:18.600]  And then sure enough, Zach didn't even know I was going to go with this yesterday, did
[56:18.600 --> 56:19.600]  a video on it.
[56:19.600 --> 56:23.080]  He was already calling Daria a producer and was already saying the exact same thing to
[56:23.080 --> 56:25.200]  her two days ago, I had no idea.
[56:25.200 --> 56:27.480]  So he's coming up right now.
[56:27.480 --> 56:30.880]  I didn't, I didn't mention this as the not go to it on purpose.
[56:30.880 --> 56:34.680]  I just, I just didn't get to it.
[56:34.680 --> 56:35.680]  Daily Mail reported it.
[56:35.680 --> 56:37.640]  Popular Mechanics reported it.
[56:37.640 --> 56:41.760]  There was a four year request from a threat fusion center and the CIA and they released
[56:41.760 --> 56:45.880]  1974 document, 44 years old.
[56:45.880 --> 56:49.840]  The year I was born, strangely enough, just a coincidence, I must say anything to do with
[56:49.840 --> 56:50.840]  me.
[56:50.840 --> 56:58.000]  It just says right here that they were testing towers and electromagnetic systems to control
[56:58.000 --> 57:04.520]  our sexual desire, our food desire, our happiness, our anger, and they confirmed that with wavelengths
[57:04.520 --> 57:14.240]  on towers and an electromagnetic range, that is the cell phone range that's from the documents
[57:14.240 --> 57:18.520]  real quick on TV, that they could, that they could control our moods.
[57:18.520 --> 57:19.520]  Okay.
[57:19.520 --> 57:24.280]  And it actually caused pain, caused hallucinations, broadcast sound in the brain, but we already
[57:24.280 --> 57:27.260]  had these patents 20 something years ago, they had patents 40 years ago, but we'd covered
[57:27.260 --> 57:28.760]  them 20 years ago.
[57:28.760 --> 57:30.360]  So why was this leaked now?
[57:30.360 --> 57:35.600]  Because there's patriots inside that the agencies, the agencies are our savior and
[57:35.600 --> 57:37.480]  they're our defeat.
[57:37.480 --> 57:41.520]  Liberty comes to our door and a uniform or tyranny comes to our door.
[57:41.520 --> 57:43.520]  It's a fight inside every organization.
[57:43.520 --> 57:46.040]  Second hour, only minutes away.

[58:48.960 --> 58:55.320]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging

[59:01.720 --> 59:08.960]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.

[59:42.880 --> 01:00:12.840]  and they know we know who they are and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:33.880]  We are living in an incredible time in history, conservatives, libertarians, freedom lovers
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:38.360]  are awake in many ways, but I don't think people realize just how intense the battle
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.600]  is right now.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:46.400]  If you just joined us, I broke this down earlier, about a month ago I had a high-level
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:51.640]  state department source and then a Pentagon source tell me within 24 hours, I got the
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:59.160]  contacts that, I tell the whole story, it'll burn the time I got to go to Zach, that Trump
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:03.800]  had already gotten Kim Jong-un to agree to denuclearization and to actually end it and
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.680]  to begin a deal to merge with the South in the next decade and to take a concessions
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:12.120]  deal and break away from China as an economic partner and use South Korea and then just
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:17.880]  explode their economy and I said all that on March 8th the day after and now it got
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:23.560]  announced weeks later and now it's all confirmed and then some of the other sources and very
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:30.600]  high-level including somebody in the top five placements of the CIA, director of, I'll leave
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:35.800]  it at that, first gave me messages and then the direct contact, why aren't you covering
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:40.880]  this, there's going to be massive false flags against liberal sides to blame conservatives,
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:45.120]  even EMPs to claim that North Korea did it to derail this and I'm just like, I'm not
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.000]  getting into classified stuff like this, this level of stuff unless the president calls
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.560]  me and that's been five, six months.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.080]  So we're bringing Zach up right now for the next 30 months to go over this, he didn't
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:59.000]  know what I was talking about and having private conversations the last few weeks but Zach's
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.800]  been dovetailing the same info, I know who Zach is, he's been on the news, been on TV,
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.400]  he's in the government, been in army and special operations, intelligence guy now with another
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:12.160]  group that deals with spacecraft and things like that and he joins us to get into this
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.600]  but Zach joins Alex Jones on Twitter live over the phone to break down his Pentagon
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.080]  insider intelligence about the warbing plan against Syria and rushed by the neocons, burden
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.480]  the Trump administration and the other tweet, tune in as Intel insider Zach explains how
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:34.040]  deep state is planning hashtag false flies against themselves, switching narratives that
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:37.880]  ISIS along with info wars are targeting MSM, UN, Hollywood and the Fed and that's what
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.920]  the news core executive said two months ago, they said we're going to ban info wars, then
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:46.120]  WikiLeaks then ISIS, like we're the same, once they're all banned, no more internet
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:50.800]  freedom and that's what the Chinese president is called for in Reuters today.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.160]  So here's the article, ISIS threatened the satanic CNN, Universal Studios, Hollywood,
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:03:00.320]  NASA, so what do you do the Federal Reserve and CNN, you help fund ISIS, you claim ISIS,
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:04.800]  your own group getting a task kicked is against you, you stage a tax against yourself, I'd
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.920]  say CNN will but deep state, making yourselves the victims, that's the only move they've
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.160]  got left Zach, so I finally went public with what I've been told because everything you're
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:16.040]  saying dovetails with it, we got two minutes to break, start.
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:20.400]  Absolutely, hello Alex, it's great to be back on and have the ability to connect with thoughts
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.800]  here, a lot of things occurring at this moment in history, so let's get right into it, we're
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.280]  going to be covering what you just spoke about, the deep state playing their jack of spades
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:31.600]  here right now by switching and recreating the ISIS narrative to be an association with
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:36.600]  the truth and liberty movement, no coincidence that this happens, pretty much in perfect
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:40.280]  timing with you kind of being critical of Trump and the Sandy Hook lawsuit, so yes they're
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:44.880]  going for broken out playing the jack of spades here, with the ISIS narrative, we're going
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.040]  to get into North Korea, which is really going on, they're all hell breaking loose in Saudi
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:52.600]  Arabia and Riyadh over the weekend, compromise Jeff Sessions and the big question of where
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:57.520]  are Huma and Hussein, to let us not lose sight of the Muslim brotherhood backed Huma Abedin
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:02.040]  and the Awan brothers, because all of a sudden they're not out of the news, Jeff Sessions
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:07.840]  and Rosenstein are okaying rage on Trump's lawyers, but no work on Huma, no work on Hussein,
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.440]  what about the pay to play, what about the fast and furious, what about all of it, we
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.040]  got a lot of critical issues going on right now, we'll kind of get into all of them, but
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:20.160]  yeah, biggest on the forefront for me, some behind the scenes workings on this is the
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:23.760]  deep, they're playing their jack of spades and changing the narrative to ISIS to associate
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:28.440]  it with you, your followers and the truth and liberty movement, this was not the word
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.200]  that important, but they see it as Americana, they can demonize it and den it, they think
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:37.880]  they can kill all opposition in the future, but Jeff Sessions compromised, staged terror
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:42.160]  attacks against the left coming to make them victims, it's all coming up with Zach, an
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:47.000]  incredible intel source so accurate, on the other side, I'm Alex Jones, news wars dot

[01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:13.200]  in Fuller's Life dot com.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:25.320]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live and we have Zach, one of our great intelligence
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.600]  sources, it's not like QAnon, I'm not bashing QAnon, I disagree with what some of what QAnon
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:40.200]  is saying, clearly they're in the intelligence community, sessions is compromised, the deep
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:45.480]  state is moving to take down Trump and Zach is known to me, Zach's real name again, he's
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:50.160]  been on national TV many times, been all over the news for over a decade, well known, decorated
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:55.640]  intelligence operative of Army Special Operations Command, now working with folks that deal
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:01.720]  with the spacecraft and the skunk works and all of that and there are multiple deep state
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:07.280]  operations, there's the original deep state of 1947, the CIA, then there's the whole
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:11.120]  NASA situation, so there's a lot of different organizations there, but you just laid it
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.240]  out in the last segment, but you've got the floor of this segment and the next, lay out
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:19.480]  Zach slowly, relax because I know I'm always interrupting, lay out the big false flags
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:24.760]  you say are coming against the left, how it ties into the intel I've been given and then
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:29.440]  just through what's happening in Saudi Arabia and this ongoing battle as the world politically
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.560]  realigns right now, Zach.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:37.840]  Absolutely, I mean, first and foremost, the ISIS narrative changing is so critical, aligning
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.800]  with the truth and liberty movement is so problematic, I mean, you really have to give
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:47.160]  me a break here, it's CNN being targeted, not in full wars, it's the UN, not the Trump
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:52.600]  White House, this is absolutely ridiculous if anything, this attack in Syria kind of
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:57.160]  emboldened this and, you know, the liberty movement kind of picking its sides has forced
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:04.280]  this play here and this is very critical because what this will end up being are false flags
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.760]  being pulled off in this country against those listed individuals, UN, Hollywood, CNN, the
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.480]  Federal Reserve, NASA, among several other targets that have all famously been covered
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:17.360]  by the truth liberty movement and most notably you in full wars and our followers following
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.360]  it.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:22.160]  But it's going to happen, this is all going to happen, this is happening at the same time
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.360]  when the attack on Syria occurred, when all hell is breaking loose in the last week in
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:31.760]  Saudi Arabia, full-out firefights, drones being shot down, missiles out of Yemen being
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:35.720]  shot down right outside of Riyadh, they're going for broke here, everything that's occurring
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:40.080]  with North Korea has to do with Iran, has to do with Saudi Arabia and Syria, so it's
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:44.440]  all interconnected here, or being so effective and like we've discussed last week, we are
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:48.560]  in the midst of the deep state's death hurdle, so we must be effective, we've got to kind
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:54.120]  of call this all out, but tying you and the Info Wars movement to ISIS essentially is
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.120]  the most ridiculous thing.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.480]  No, no, yeah, you're talking to other people that are super informed, the audience is informed,
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:03.440]  but talk to me like I'm five years old, explain the articles that have come out, ISIS saying
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.320]  they're going to attack the new world lord of the globalists, they've openly worked
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:10.400]  for them, they always attacked innocent groups, this is a rebranding exactly what I was told
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:15.000]  by high-level sources, they're planning major attacks against leftist groups to then blame
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.560]  it on ISIS and claim ISIS has linked up with the nationalist and Trump and the liberty movement,
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.320]  I was told this a month ago, and now that I see this, I'm in total horror.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:29.480]  Yeah, so now ISIS is being educated by Info Wars essentially, which will be the narrative,
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:34.440]  when a false flag does occur, which will be self-inflicted by themselves and then covered
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:40.120]  by themselves, it will be revealed that, hmm, well, these individuals have common enemies
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:43.840]  and the enemies are the stories that we've been uncovering for decades, that the truth
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:48.120]  of liberty movement is aware of and knows of, but now all of a sudden ISIS happens to be
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.240]  a libertarian-based, conspiratorial fighting group.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.240]  This is absolutely unprecedented and it's no coincidence on a common basis.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:01.080]  Well, we always ask, why did Big Vae bomb a federal building in the middle of the Midwest?
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.800]  We know it was staged, it came out was staged.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.040]  He didn't bomb the UN, they finally get that narrative, bomb themselves, make themselves
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.040]  the victims.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.040]  Absolutely.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:15.520]  So, you know, the movement that dubbed Al Caeda is now in line with that somehow, it's
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.520]  absolutely ridiculous.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:20.240]  Well, you heard what I said earlier that I hadn't told you or the listeners.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.600]  What do you make of what I was told the last month?
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.800]  Yeah, it's actually, it's absolutely accurate and that's what we've been hinting at.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.920]  We started this whole thing about eight months ago when I came on the show and we started
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:35.120]  discussing strategic patience, you see, we see how effective false flags work in Syria.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:40.320]  So, just as we're supposedly pulling out of North Korea, expect the same thing.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:44.880]  All the opposing sabotage from China and the D-State, not to mention the strategic patience
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:49.360]  personnel who have been benefiting for this for 65 years, okay?
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.760]  Our budget perpetually in South Korea is so big, I don't think people understand.
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:57.800]  I mean, we're talking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars on record.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.040]  That's not even black budget, it's just on record.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:03.880]  Conservatively what, 30 billion a year over decades, it's gigantic.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.680]  Hundreds of billions, hundreds of billions, hundreds of billions all the time and it's,
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:13.520]  you know, there's 25,000 there permanently and it's 65 years after the actual war, okay?
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.000]  We've been there for 65 years.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.200]  So, the idea that, oh, we got this deal going on.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.920]  We're talking trillions like the Iraq war, trillions.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.880]  The idea that we're leaving and everything's okay, that's a good plan and I like that we've
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.480]  opposed strategic patience, but if you don't think that the military industrial complex
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:31.360]  and the D-State is going to pull everything off in their power.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.160]  So, who are the bad guys and good guys?
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:36.880]  Because the word is, Mattis is trying to block this, is that true?
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880]  Mattis is trying to block it.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:41.760]  Mattis is obviously a patriot and a great individual, but this issue is so complex that
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:46.040]  there's a complete battle going on in the White House.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.520]  Trump can't trust anybody.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.520]  Trump can't trust what's going on.
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.520]  It's very difficult with the striking serious changes.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:55.240]  Can you imagine being in his view, like I got mad at him a couple of weeks ago, an emotion.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.240]  I get it now.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:01.080]  I'm not walking back what I did, but God, do you imagine being Trump?
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.240]  It's unbelievable and the problem is he's fighting a military industrial complex, it's
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:08.720]  the root of all of it and the big issue here is that peace is not profitable, period.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.720]  Peace is not profitable.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:13.760]  This is a machine that's been churning out profit for 65 years on that peninsula and
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.040]  the idea that, oh, all of a sudden, peace will be great.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:21.920]  I argue the attention span so gone via instant gratification, we're here, it's news one day
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.400]  and not news the next.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.480]  We broke on the show about a month ago, maybe six weeks ago.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:33.560]  I was on it and it was a New York Times article and it says, you and workers have found containers
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:38.840]  in Syria sent by North Korea that was the catalyst from the pull off the chemical weapons
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:39.840]  attack.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.360]  This was in the news verified 100%.
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.880]  Now they're regurgitating the information all of a sudden.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.400]  Now we're going to get a switch in the narrative from Kim Jong-un is doing these things and
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:55.280]  of course, our intelligence agencies and our real operators who are compromised are standing
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:00.160]  on behalf of North Korea, this Indus area, to get it down on paper, to get it documented
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.160]  because of the eventual push.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:07.080]  Well, that's my next issue is ISIS use chemicals 52 times in Syria, even the New York Times
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.080]  it meant.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.560]  Now the inspectors get there and say, no, we're getting shot at.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.240]  The Syrians didn't block us, the Russians brought us in.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:18.720]  That came out in zero hedge mainstream news from the main organization for the prohibition
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:23.440]  of chemical weapons, Germany's largest public TV top show in the country went interviewed
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.960]  all the witnesses and said, yeah, no one was hit with chemicals.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.800]  They told the kids that they were going to give them candy if they would let them dump
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.360]  water on their heads.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.320]  Everything we reported the last week is now coming out that the chemical attack was a
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.320]  staged event.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:41.040]  So as of today, this broke about 13 hours ago, they got the quote on it.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:45.440]  All the Warhawks, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, as a collector there, they issued a statement
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:49.920]  to the Treasury Secretary saying the decades long military partnership between Syria and
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:53.680]  North Korea has enabled President Assad to continue his reign of terror with chemical
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:57.920]  weapons that include the use of muster gas, blister agents, and nerve agents such as Sarin
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:02.160]  and VX, resulting in the deaths of thousands of his own people, including innocent children.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.840]  This is the official talking point coming out of the Warhawks in our own.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.320]  Because they don't want the deal to be made, well, the US is winning, the Russians are
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.320]  pulling out.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.840]  We're winning in North Korea.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.200]  The globalists don't want the problem to be fixed.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.560]  They don't want us to have the peace deal.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:21.640]  So what about my sources saying they're looking at major stage terror, just like they did
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.040]  in Syria, to blame Kim Jong-un.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:28.320]  And this was so big, and the source is so big, I didn't cover it three weeks ago, I just
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.320]  couldn't do it.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:33.440]  My gut says, put it out now, how does that tie into this with your information on how
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:38.200]  they may be planning something to derail peace breaking out like the fake chemical attack
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.200]  of two weeks ago?
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:44.240]  Absolutely, planned already in the works, in this upcoming week, in the next week, that
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.240]  would be very vigilant.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:48.720]  A lot of planned operations obviously going on, chatter gets around, nothing happens in
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.720]  a vacuum.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.640]  And it's already started in Saudi Arabia, which is really the epicenter of where this all
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:53.640]  stems from.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:58.160]  So over the, over the last week in Saudi Arabia, just major, major internal fighting, full
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:03.440]  out firefights, shooting things down, you know, ballistic missiles being shot down with,
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.440]  you know, Patriot systems themselves.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.720]  Yeah, we forget, it's hardly in the news that ICBMs get fired and get blown up all the
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:09.720]  time.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:13.640]  So you're saying Trump has successfully gotten people that were reformers in, but now they've
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.640]  counter-striked?
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.640]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:20.680]  This is the fight right now, the next two weeks, we are in the midst of the, of the
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:21.680]  deep state death hurdle.
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:22.680]  This is it.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:23.680]  I mean, we're in it right now.
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.680]  It starts in Saudi Arabia.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.080]  We'll make it to our shores by next week.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:31.840]  There's very, very credible intel out there of planned operations this week into the next.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:32.840]  And it's going to be double pronged.
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:37.200]  Well, when we come back, what about the warnings of terror attacks on left to sides?
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:40.360]  I already knew this weeks ago, you called saying you wanted to come on about it.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.800]  So you might be getting some of the same intel.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.640]  I mean, they say it's imminent.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:49.280]  We're talking federal buildings blown up, school shot up, nerve gas, EMPs, they say
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.280]  this is it.

[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:19.280]  function in the 1960s researchers in France notice that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:24.760]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this effect
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:30.360]  in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast acting
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:35.960]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:41.080]  effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:46.800]  acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory

[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:18.160]  show
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:25.320]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:36.120]  the mind of man Thomas Jefferson all right we got nine minutes left with Zach a great
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:42.240]  intel source again documented known by this operation who he is he's just a smart patriot
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:46.720]  a veteran a guy hooked into things that knows what's going on by the white hats in the government
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:52.120]  versus the black hats and the white hats worldwide are making a move for free market prosperity
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:58.520]  true open societies and sorrows in the globalist I have been told for close to a month by the
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:03.600]  same individuals that told me that Kim Jong had already agreed to denuclearization and
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.560]  all the rest up before anybody else admitted it and I was and again I asked him I said
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.080]  why am I being given this info they said so we give you more info you know it's real
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:16.120]  but I didn't go with this but then I saw the latest developments I saw Zach contacting
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:20.440]  our producers saying listen they're going to target leftist sites and now it's all coming
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:24.680]  out that ISIS is going to do it to make the globalist victims it's here so the eight minutes
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:30.280]  we have left Zach lay out where we are right now what citizens should be watching the different
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:35.640]  players that are involved what's happening in the world absolutely so where we're at
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:41.160]  right now is we're going to have the mainstream media and the military industrial complex
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:45.880]  backed government have you believe that ISIS is being educated by info wars with common
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:52.280]  enemies we have the iconic images of Trump and the king of Saudi Arabia grasping that
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:57.320]  illuminated globe that illuminated globe and their inaugural trip coming to fruition Trump
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:01.320]  had to make a plan here we really have to get through to him because appeasing this complex
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:04.840]  appeasing these whorehawks is not where you want to be you want to be tough you have to
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:09.720]  do what you got to do but what about compromised gestation what about Rosenstein what about
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:14.120]  Houma what about Hussein what about the real crimes so we have to get through to Trump
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:18.680]  for all the good he's done as the most effective president in US history this is the fight this
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:24.360]  is the death hurdle that image of him waving the swords that image of grasping the illuminated
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:29.480]  globe in Saudi Arabia will be a problem because like we have all over the planet our our grass
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:34.200]  is an empire that's what it is our military presence all over the planet is being mimicked
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:38.360]  and followed up by Saudi Arabia doing the same thing in the Middle East and North Africa they
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:42.920]  will pull off the sections of the world that we did not culturally have the ability to do but
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:47.400]  obviously they are in cahoots looking to the information into 9 11 and those images if not
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:52.360]  corrected and played at the 5d chess level will be very problematic for the Trump presidency
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:56.760]  as as history is written very dangerous times and getting back to Rosenstein
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:04.760]  the secretary of i mean all these people the attorney general all of them worship him like
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:09.240]  he's god he's the one that worked for clinton he's the one that did it all Trump's not even talking
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:13.800]  about getting rid of rosenstein and they say you do it it's over this is the rogue government
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:18.600]  so the old idea was don't get rid of them it looks like you're guilty no they're criminals get rid of
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:26.520]  all of them exactly yes jeff you have jeff sessions um you know being a champion of mandatory minimums
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:31.720]  and and you know threatening the white house and you know putting out the media that he will step
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:37.000]  down if rosenstein is fired and notice as soon as trump said i don't want to put marijuana smokers
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.360]  in prison which is super popular and reasonable suddenly sessions goes crazy who really controls
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:48.360]  sessions zack and what do they have on him if you know sessions is down the line deep state just
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:52.920]  he's been a problem from the get go and he has some good qualities he's a little bit later in his
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:57.720]  life but like we said six months ago tillerson is compromised haley is compromised sessions is
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:01.880]  compromised and that's our big wedge in between us and the q and i community it's trust sessions
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:05.480]  trust sessions trust sessions well i don't trust sessions because huma abedine and the
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:09.560]  awan brothers committed treason in this country hillary clinton committed treason this country
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:15.480]  barack who's saying who's saying who's saying obama committed treason in this country so don't
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:20.040]  be okay and raise with your deputy attorney general into trump's party exactly if i was selling out
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:24.440]  the pakistan dollar cigarettes i need a bullet in my head what the hell is what they they say
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:29.160]  we're traitors all day they're the ones that are traitors the question is what do the awan
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:35.880]  brothers and huma get on jeff that's right because they had control of his servers they well so what
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:40.040]  is the word let's just get it out there i know the fbi's grab you a few times over this but what
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.840]  is the word on jeff what do they have on him i don't know i'll just say this it's compromised
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:49.240]  jeff that's needs i can't get into specific details because that would be very problematic
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:53.400]  and you're dealing with an individual like him and the entities that he's in control of obviously
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:57.240]  it becomes a problem in the in the next few weeks i know but the fact that you know that makes it a
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:02.280]  problem i just want to get this going i'm not scared of these people i'm sick of it man the intel's
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:06.520]  out there he was he was even a part of a group so you're saying if he makes a move against you or
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:13.320]  others the intel goes out oh it's going out it's well i was told let's just say he was in the kkk
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:20.440]  i'm told it's kkk like i'm just saying he's a man later in his life history seemed to the world
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:25.480]  move in a different different way when he was a younger man um he lived in a certain geographical
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:29.400]  region of the planet where certain things were accepted and that if they were out so you know
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:35.240]  you just said at the intel you're getting is the same thing i got on on on bird is that it's kkk crap
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:41.240]  i mean you're pushing the the prison industrial complex you're not the name whom are who's saying
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:46.840]  doesn't come up with verifiable things you're okay and you're okay and raise a goddamn kkk people
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:52.840]  i'm so sick of them i mean and you know he was brought in uh just like killer saying just like
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:57.160]  hailey to see where see where they could be led and then be crossed and you know double cross in
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:02.120]  the next year or two he will be relieved and this is a lot of good intel out of q and on but this is
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.560]  our wedge right here where it's trust sessions trust sessions trust sessions i've known some
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:10.280]  things for a long time and just his lines i'm not no we got two minutes left what's the rest of
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:14.840]  data done the left is getting ready to have global estate's terror attacks to make them the victim
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:22.200]  that's the clear next play we have that what else the big question is when will huma and hussain be
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:27.160]  pushed i want donald trump and he will start doing it this week i think maybe into the next week
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:30.840]  how can they're not possibly you know have hillary clinton whom avidine and brock who's
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:35.080]  saying looked into because what's going to happen is trump trump via twitter will start
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:39.640]  pressuring jeff sessions compromise jeff sessions well isn't it good news that congress is calling
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:45.720]  for criminal investigations that seemed to make the democrats fall suit and go crazy or seen as
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:51.160]  potential potential momentum that's actually not momentum don't look into that there's already
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:55.960]  stuff there's there's members of congress specifically no there's enough to indict all
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:27:03.000]  the top democrats and send the president for 10 000 years if you're if you pull out the true plan
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.880]  here if we really get into what went on with hrc washman solz who's saying and and and all the
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:14.680]  likes there with the fast and furious being being the pretext of you know getting all of this it's
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:22.360]  so unprecedented that the changes in history will be you just cannot get to around this it's either
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:27.240]  all or nothing and that's why the democrats are so desperate they've committed such galactic crimes
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:32.920]  that they've just they did their corners you just hit it right this is the galactic gold mine
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:37.800]  and that is it because everything that's occurring is stopping us like you spoke about the front
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:42.600]  some of the stuff i'm involved with and think tank engineering um the move here we they have to do
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:47.240]  everything they can to stop us from going multi-planetary once we go multi-planetary there's a real
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:52.040]  issue in the culture narrative real issue and we you know what we look to as cultural references
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:56.920]  real issues in the economy when it comes to mining certain precious metals and minerals
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:01.480]  everything changes and big disclosures are about to come out and they want to be in charge
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:06.040]  when the disclosures happen hundred percent so they're pulling out they've pulled it out they
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:09.320]  played the jack of spades that's what i've been told that's what i've been told since i was a kid
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:13.800]  and we are here right now artzak i'm back live tomorrow i know you're very busy there at paulo

[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:33.720]  from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones all right my friends we've got two segments
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:39.080]  left tonight and i have saved some of the most important information to last coming up in the
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:46.200]  final segment here about 15 minutes i'm going to apologize to khanye west it's been a long time
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:51.800]  coming but i didn't really know his politics i just knew he was connected to hollywood the big
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:59.880]  media combine so i called him kyan west and stuff like i attack all mainstream entertainers just
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:04.920]  because i just ignore the whole thing but it turns out for years he's been a entrepreneur
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:10.440]  independent more libertarian i know he's a trump fan he was thrown a mental institution
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:15.880]  because he was uh and now he's come out and said that he likes kandace owens who's been a guest on
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:23.320]  the show many times and who is a great uh liberator of the human mind so one thing he's got amongst
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:27.720]  the talent and hundreds of millions of dollars is that he's a maverick and got a lot of courage
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:31.400]  because they've already locked him up for two weeks in a mental institution when he started
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:35.480]  publicly saying get off trumps back whether you love trump or hate him you've all got a right to
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:41.400]  be at my concerts they grabbed him that night put him in a mental institution last year so that is
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:47.160]  coming up in the next segment i'll get into my apology and then play paul watson's powerful
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:53.640]  video but speaking of that have another powerful paul watson editor of info wars.com video that's
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:35:01.080]  up on info wars.com and news wars.com right now nfl to band cheerleaders and i watched the video
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:05.240]  this morning and then i actually did some of the research on it and lo and behold it's right there
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:14.200]  in usa today usa today columnist time for the nfl to fire chandelier clad female cheerleaders and
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:19.560]  hire male cheerleaders because it's not fair that they're only female we can't have gender roles
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:27.000]  here now folks let's just back up for a minute i call myself a libertarian because i think some of
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:33.240]  the more extreme conservatives out there who basically want us all to live like amish violate
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:39.080]  people's rights in a world where they had control but they're not the people taken over there's not
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:46.040]  a billion three hundred million super orthodox christians that are following the same christianity
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:52.520]  of a thousand years ago that doesn't exist but under islam there is a billion three hundred million
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:36:00.120]  the left the liberal groups these other organizations they are accepting it they are
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:05.480]  adopting it they're saying in europe and here in the u.s that linda susur should lead the different
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:11.320]  feminist organizations uh and different groups that are out there it's just simply insane
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:18.920]  but now you've got us today columnist coming out and saying it hurts women it's objectifying on and
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:27.080]  on and on well that's like saying big muscular six foot five guys wrestling in a professional
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:32.760]  wrestling ring is objectifying they're making millions of dollars they're having fun people
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:38.520]  want to see big tough guys even simulated fighting it's what happens nfl football players bash each
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:44.600]  other's brains out as gladiators it's their right to do it the nanny state is what has gotten rid of
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:53.320]  diving boards it's what's gotten rid of uh most of the freedoms we have in this country with the
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:58.600]  entire nanny state suing everything out of existence where regular gas tanks that always work that you
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:03.560]  could fill up with gas and use easily we're all sued out of existence so the new safety gas cans
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:09.640]  that are plastic and have the weird nozzles that spill everywhere are all we have it's example after
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:15.480]  example after example but now ben Shapiro has written an article for us today countering it
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:20.920]  dealing with all of this insanity but the left has gone full circle into the orthodox
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:27.240]  oppressive control freaks that they claim the conservatives were hundreds and hundreds of
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:32.280]  years ago and they as a cult particularly feminist women want control of the powerful
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:38.360]  culture of women and they're turning women into victims just like the democratic party has turned
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:54.280]  black people into victims from one plantation to a new one here's paul's watson's report cheerleaders
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:38:01.640]  who doesn't like cheerleaders that ugly bitter feminists obviously and usa today columnist nancy
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:07.240]  or more no place in the nfl for cheerleaders in 2018 so after calling for classic songs to be banned
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:13.720]  for their offensive lyrics usa today now wants cheerleaders gone to is anything sacred the houston
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:17.480]  texas aren't even bothering with the pretense on their website as a photo gallery of the finalist
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:20.840]  from last weekend's cheerleader tryouts and visitors are encouraged to vote for their favorites
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:24.600]  are these action shots of the women that highlight their athletic ability or downskills do they
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:29.160]  include a list of their qualifications of course not their headshots sorry head and chest shots
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:34.360]  close-up ones at that the better to ogle you know wait you mean to tell me that they judge women
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:40.520]  for a role that specifically requires hotness on the level of their hotness is not their academic
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:45.400]  qualifications because the first thought that pops into my head when i watch this is gee i wonder
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:51.560]  what grade point average this chick got newsflash dummy men like to look at hot women that's never
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:57.080]  going to change and no matter how much you try to browbeat shame and reeducators that's always
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:01.880]  going to be a thing you can't reverse basic biology through social engineering the underlying
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:05.880]  premise of nfl cheerleaders is degrading presenting women as nothing more than objects to be
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:10.120]  layered up with skimpy suggestive outfits as their uniform their only purpose is to titillate and you
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:16.280]  know what she's got a point this is just morally wrong congress really should pass a law to prevent
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:21.320]  women from being forced into cheerleading oh wait that wouldn't be necessary because it's completely
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:27.720]  optional i mean cheerleaders just hate cheerleading so much some of them pay just to audition women
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:33.400]  making their own choices on what to do with their bodies wasn't that what women's lib was all about
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:38.600]  freedom of choice you know before all your resentful harpies hijacked feminism and turned it into a
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:43.000]  global laughing stock with your hair brained intersectional nonsense it's always been an
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:48.680]  appalling message to send in in this hashtag need to era there's no longer any place for it nfl cheerleaders
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:54.360]  need to go nba dan squads and nhl ice girls while we're at it too right so in the name of feminism
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:59.720]  and supporting women you want to deprive tens of thousands of current and future women of work
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:06.200]  you purport to be a champion of women yet you refer to these women as blow up dolls come to life
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:11.880]  simply because they've chosen to do something that your joyless puritanical ass doesn't approve of
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:29.080]  now let's pause there and have another look at some cheerleaders as i was saying men like
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:33.880]  to look at hot women control freak middle-aged pearl clutching left-wing journalists who write
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:39.800]  for usa today don't like to look at hot women did you fail the high school cheer team is that what
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:44.840]  it is on by the way this isn't just about shaking around pompoms on game day many of these cheerleaders
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:49.640]  do important charity work and community outreach so one of the biggest entertainment groups to
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:55.320]  regularly perform for the united states armed forces overseas these girls literally go into
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:41:00.680]  war zones to lift the spirits of the troops and she admits this in her own article but then says
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:05.560]  man just ban him anyway i mean the nfl is already hemorrhaging viewers because of its tolerance of
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:10.760]  social justice stupidity now you want to take away the cheerleaders i mean what can we ban next
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:16.840]  las vegas showgirls burlesque dancers instagram hotties why don't we just ban models all together
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:21.000]  i mean what other potential career paths for young women can we terminate because we're such
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.280]  good feminists but paul this is just one newspaper columnist no no no no no this is part of a wider
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:32.760]  purge f1 grid girls band the tennis girl poster band beach body ads band page three girls band
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:37.960]  booth babes band we just made hundreds of thousands of women unemployed go feminism
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:46.760]  oh will bitch and moan all day about the horror of displaying women who choose to wear what they
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:51.880]  want well simultaneously celebrating a modesty culture that forces women to wear bags on their
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:57.160]  heads as a symbol of women's empowerment maybe if we just compelled women to wear certain items of
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:02.360]  clothing you'd be all for it because that's what seems to pass as feminism these days no
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:09.240]  the whole point should be to let women be rocket scientists or Babylon jigglers give them equal
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:15.400]  opportunity and mind your own frigging business feminists are going on and on and on about how
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:19.640]  it's degrading to women the women that are actually doing it don't feel degraded and
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:23.720]  we're not being given the choice to decide now whether we want to do it or not and when this
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:29.960]  isn't a feminist crusade this is a class crusade this is about a bunch of condescending sanctimonious
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:35.960]  elitist snobs like Nancy or more looking down their noses at hardworking girls just trying to
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:41.480]  make their way in life look not all girls can aspire to be like you to write laborious torment
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:46.760]  to diatribes about how everything that offends your prudish sensibilities should be banned so
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:52.360]  embrace real feminism embrace real equality and leave these girls the hell alone

[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:13.240]  so
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:16.760]  there's a lot of controversy around this network about alex jones for example
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:27.960]  so
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:37.960]  alex jones
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:43.160]  stop
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:57.160]  reputation is amazing i will not let you down you will be very very impressed i hope
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:03.240]  you
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:11.720]  discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the alex jones show
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:22.040]  so throughout history there have been joyless control freaks who want absolute dominance over
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:28.920]  every facet of society and these control freaks are seeking absolute power so they can control
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:34.280]  the developments and the activities between men and women between parents and their children
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:40.120]  between church and state between cheerleaders in the nfl between what rock stars and hip hop
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:47.960]  stars do they've got control and hollywood is known for their incredible bullying and dominance over
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:54.360]  other stars who don't toe the line and how people like james woods and others are incredibly talented
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:49:00.600]  get blacklisted for coming out and saying hey i'm pro america or i'm free market or i'm a conservative
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:06.680]  now i didn't really know who kanya west was personally i knew he was a big huge star with
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:11.560]  the top ones in the world knew he made some pretty narcissistic statements and i just assumed he was a
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:16.520]  democrat and a globalist and so i call him cayenne west but the last few years watching him with
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:21.240]  trump actually listening to what he says listening to his music it's actually a lot of us pretty good
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:27.000]  and seeing what he does he has a lot of courage and is a maverick like they say in full metal jacket
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.720]  private jokers silly and he's ignorant but he's got guts and and guts is enough well
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:36.680]  kanya west has got guts talent you name it uh so i apologize to him for being wrong about him and
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:42.200]  being ignorant myself and just shooting my mouth off he has come out and supported uh kandace owens
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:46.840]  come out and supported trump come out and supported free market come out and supported not being a
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:53.080]  victim and understanding that this whole push for racism and division in the name of counter racism
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:57.880]  is about giving us all crutches and about the democrats controlling our minds just like they're
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:01.960]  trying to do with women and the whole me too movement so here is a powerful report from
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:08.680]  paul watson but kanya i apologize to you in a watershed moment for the culture war kanya west
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:14.600]  praised conservative commentator kandace owens in a tweet saying i love the way kandace owens
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:19.800]  thinks if you see some that's great you got a respect and how did twitter react by failing to
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:26.040]  even spell owens name properly and calling her far right they're going to call a former left wing
[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:33.160]  now center right black conservative who is hated by the actual far right far right then all bets
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:38.440]  are now off and then the usual blue check marks piled in with their lies and hatred kandace owens
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:42.440]  is a far right media personality who got famous by appearing on the conspiracy site info wars and
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:46.280]  calling herself a red pill black attempt popularized on the alt-right men's rights message board that is
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:51.720]  basically an antenna for woke wrong idiot she got famous by communicating a message of actual
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:57.080]  empowerment for black people so save us the glib white explaining please talking of white
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:02.200]  explaining shawn king wind about it too yeah how are you going to accuse kanya of being an uncle
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:07.800]  tom when you're whiter than rachel dole is all but so precisely how does kandace owens think
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:12.680]  well she tells black people not to be victims not to be dependent on welfare and not to blame
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:19.080]  society for all their problems the truth is that the left wants to strap black people to this idea
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:22.680]  that they are victims that's what it comes down to they do not want black people focus on their
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:26.760]  futures they want black people focus on their past they like black people to be government
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:30.440]  dependent they don't like to see black people that are free thinkers and are independent
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:34.200]  and i think that's what kanya west and myself represents the black community and that makes
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:39.560]  them very nervous that correlates exactly with karnie's new outlook remember karnie met with
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:44.280]  trump to talk about tackling black on black violence in chicago something that the left and
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:49.160]  black lives matter supporters refuse to incorporate into their message because it doesn't fit their
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:54.200]  race-baiting victimhood narrative karnie has also exposed how the left fans the flames of
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:59.880]  hysteria over racism to metaphorically keep black people on the plantation to keep them docile
[01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:08.520]  and easily controlled racism is a dated concept it's not an actual thing that even means anything
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:14.040]  you know it's something that was used to hold people back in the past but now there's been so
[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:20.840]  many leaps and breaking of the rules that it's like it's played out like you know like a style
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:30.200]  from the you know 1800s or something you know the real true freedom isn't in the words the true
[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:35.320]  freedom is in the opportunity karnie west represents a massive threat to the left because he has an
[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:41.720]  army of adoring fans and he's clearly done with being a puppet for their divisive agenda after
[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:47.000]  this he's going to be relentlessly attacked by the establishment like never before get ready
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:54.360]  the mainstream entertainment industry is so stale so controlled so adversarial to originality it can
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:53:00.680]  no longer produce any icons with actual authenticity karnie himself has alluded to this on several
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:16.280]  occasions celebrities with something to say other than vacuous
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:22.600]  virtue signaling and cliche platitudes are now all but extinct and that's because any celebrity
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:28.360]  that uses their platform to speak uncomfortable truths is immediately shunned and attacked
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:33.640]  by the legacy media look what they did to morrissey after he spoke out against mass immigration and
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:40.120]  islamic terrorism this paucity of authentic interesting celebrities is why youtubers like
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:46.280]  pewdiepie and kandis owens are the new rock stars we the rock stars now obviously most of these new
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:52.440]  rock stars aren't going to be political but the ones that are represent a true threat to the status
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:57.880]  quo to the dominant culture which is why i was right when i said conservatism is the new counter
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:03.320]  culture and populism is the new punk rock oh but karnie had a breakdown he's got insane yeah if you
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:09.320]  haven't been paying attention karnie's had about 10 what they call breakdowns since the mid 2000s
[01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:14.360]  and he always comes back more influential than ever before but that's why they're terrified
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:20.680]  of him endorsing ideas and people outside of their control who's they i'm talking about the
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:26.520]  dominant cultural institutions of hollywood the entertainment industry the music industry and
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:32.440]  the media the high priests of pop culture the gatekeepers of what political and spiritual
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:38.680]  ideas we're told are acceptable now one of their own has gone rogue and the panic is palpable
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:43.320]  your true man's showboat is hitting the wall why do you think karnie fears for his own life
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:49.800]  as andrew breitbart said politics is downstream from culture you can change political destiny
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:56.120]  by hijacking culture in case you haven't noticed that's what i'm doing the left is slowly waking
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:01.960]  up to the fact that they're losing their monopoly on controlling culture when you've been in control
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:08.440]  for so many decades something new inevitably has to emerge to become the new counter culture
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:14.360]  especially given that the left no longer pushes to be edgy daring or rebellious and has instead
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:20.600]  embraced censorship puritanism and cultural sterility the high priests of pop culture are
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:26.040]  the real racists they're the ones who indoctrinate young black kids to aspire to be thugs they're
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:32.520]  the ones who fetishize and glorify criminality and gangsterism through hip hop music karnie is trying
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:39.000]  to move black people away from the ghettoization of their minds towards true independence and freedom
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:44.760]  kandis owens is trying to do exactly the same thing and that's why they resonate with each other
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:49.320]  and that's why the left is petrified of them both what you're seeing happening today obviously we
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:51.800]  have we have some black people that are just shouting in the back we have some black people
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:55.480]  that are sitting in the front quietly that are chanting usa and having a normal conversation
[01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:58.680]  i love that because what i say every single time you may have seen me on the news is that what is
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:02.120]  happening right now in the black community you're going to hear in this room first there's a
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:05.640]  an ideological civil war happening black people that are focused on their past and shouting
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:09.240]  about slavery and black people that are focused on their futures okay that's what that's really
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:16.200]  what it comes down to okay i can i can guarantee you what you're seeing happening is victim mentality
[01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:24.360]  versus victor mentality i promise you i love that right i love that and there's no doubt in my mind
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:28.520]  i can i can tell you right now who is going to be better off when we look 20 years when we look
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:31.480]  at the basis in this room who is going to be better off are the girls that are sitting right here
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:35.480]  and across this room because they don't have your mentality victim mentality is not cool i don't know
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:39.480]  why people like being oppressed it's the weirdest thing i've ever heard i love oppression but we're
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:44.040]  oppressed 400 years of slavery jim crow which by the way none of you guys live through your grandparents
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:50.040]  and it's embarrassing that you utilize you utilize their history you utilize their history and you
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:53.640]  come in here with more emotion than they ever had when they were living through it more emotion than
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:58.440]  they ever had when they were living through it it's embarrassing you're not living through anything
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:04.760]  right now you're overly privileged americans they're also afraid that carney could be president one day
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:10.200]  i'm not joking as terrence williams said both carney and kandace are free thinkers if that triggers
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:16.120]  you chances are you're not a free thinker the left doesn't care about black people they don't want
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:21.080]  black people to be business owners doctors or scientists they want them to remain mired
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:26.280]  independency and hopelessness they want them to continue to vote for their own enslavement and
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:31.400]  whether you love or hate carney's narcissistic personality when someone comes up and says
[01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:37.320]  something like i am a god everybody says who does he think he is i just told you who i thought i was
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:44.280]  a god the mere threat of him derailing this agenda to any degree the mere fact that they don't control
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:58.280]  what comes out of his mouth
