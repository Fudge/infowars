[00:35.240 --> 00:40.160]  prison planet TV with his brother Steve Watson also run my site info wars.net
[00:40.160 --> 00:44.360]  he pulled out some of his meager savings out of the bank in the last week and
[00:44.360 --> 00:48.320]  tried to go buy gold in and around Sheffield England where he lives and
[00:48.320 --> 00:53.120]  guess what they're sold out everywhere so then he tried to go downtown today and
[00:53.120 --> 00:56.520]  there were lines around the block at the few places that had gold they had run
[00:56.520 --> 01:00.840]  out they had run out of gold at almost all the shops and companies in Germany
[01:00.840 --> 01:08.240]  in Russia in India in China just within a day or two of a small percentage of the
[01:08.240 --> 01:13.080]  know-it-all yuppie establishment worldwide finding out that their precious
[01:13.080 --> 01:18.320]  neural order banks might be planning to cheat them the gold disappeared Ted
[01:18.320 --> 01:22.680]  Anderson as he's been in the gold and silver business for 30 years will be
[01:22.680 --> 01:33.440]  30 years come this January because he has sources he is barely able to get gold
[01:33.440 --> 01:36.640]  and he's able to do something that really no other major dealer that we know
[01:36.640 --> 01:40.680]  was able to he's able to get it at billion that prices but the point is
[01:40.680 --> 01:45.000]  everything we told you is now unfolding ladies and gentlemen it is
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.760]  unfolding right now before our very eyes I've been monitoring the financial TV
[01:50.760 --> 01:55.560]  channels the financial publications the neocon talk shows and they are now
[01:55.560 --> 02:00.960]  telling everyone it's going to be a depression and so the fact that they are
[02:00.960 --> 02:05.760]  from their powerful positions are seeing that it's a foregone conclusion they are
[02:05.760 --> 02:11.340]  now putting out the official story that greedy Americans caused all this and
[02:11.340 --> 02:14.880]  that we are all greedy and evil and deserve what's happening to us and the
[02:14.880 --> 02:19.160]  austerity is how we'll all have to live now not that the international crime
[02:19.160 --> 02:22.880]  syndicate created all this false liquidity by design to buy real assets
[02:22.880 --> 02:27.960]  or that they engineered its control collapse the only place you're going to
[02:27.960 --> 02:34.920]  find that is from a few top economists a few people out there like Nobel Prize
[02:34.920 --> 02:38.600]  winner Joseph Stiklitz who will admit they engineered it you'll find it at
[02:38.600 --> 02:46.120]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com we'll find that vital truth of course in my
[02:46.120 --> 02:51.000]  book 9-11 to send the tyranny written six and a half years ago plus more than
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.320]  six and a half years ago and so I'm going to break down what we're seeing
[02:55.320 --> 03:01.400]  unfold right now as the market continues to fall today lost well over a thousand
[03:01.400 --> 03:08.000]  points in the last what just a five days of trading last last few days of last

[03:26.280 --> 03:31.080]  here's a headline after rate cuts investors already ready for more around
[03:31.080 --> 03:35.400]  of coordinated interest rate cuts failed to calm global stock markets fueling
[03:35.400 --> 03:38.920]  speculation that governments will have to do even more to tackle the credit
[03:38.920 --> 03:44.480]  crisis i.e. pump trillions more to themselves in the financial markets
[03:44.480 --> 03:49.480]  nothing to mainstream so they're going to protect themselves and consolidate
[03:49.480 --> 03:54.640]  their power destroy what's left of any real industry and annihilate the
[03:54.640 --> 03:59.600]  currencies and as I've been telling you for years it will not only be the dollar
[03:59.600 --> 04:04.680]  that plunges for those snickering and laughing in the EU the euro is going to
[04:04.680 --> 04:10.520]  plunge they want to hurt everybody except themselves in the elite circles the

[04:22.280 --> 04:29.520]  13.56 it is down 136 points of the Dow Jones industrials and that's even a
[04:29.520 --> 04:37.440]  rigged top 30 because they take out the losers so we will walk through all this

[08:30.760 --> 08:35.760]  that was a clip of President Bush
[08:35.760 --> 08:40.760]  from my 2005 film American Dictators
[08:40.760 --> 08:46.760]  saying it will take time to restore chaos
[08:46.760 --> 08:48.760]  I mean order out of chaos
[08:48.760 --> 08:52.760]  that is the maximum of the new world order of the social engineers

[09:05.760 --> 09:09.760]  and order out of chaos, but we will
[09:10.760 --> 09:13.760]  gold is up more than $30 today
[09:13.760 --> 09:17.760]  it's up what over 130 plus in the last two weeks
[09:19.760 --> 09:26.760]  and ladies and gentlemen they have announced that the mint in Canada can no longer get gold
[09:26.760 --> 09:28.760]  to make maple leaves
[09:28.760 --> 09:34.760]  the British government is announcing they're running out of gold to stamp at their mint
[09:34.760 --> 09:38.760]  their British sovereigns and government issued gold bullion
[09:38.760 --> 09:43.760]  the US Mint announced two weeks ago they were suspending sales indefinitely
[09:43.760 --> 09:50.760]  of the gorgeous one ounce and half ounce buffaloes
[09:50.760 --> 09:56.760]  they are now suspending indefinitely sales of all of their other bullion
[09:56.760 --> 09:58.760]  that is the American eagles
[09:58.760 --> 10:04.760]  gone they can't get the gold to print them
[10:04.760 --> 10:07.760]  to stamp them to mint those suckers
[10:09.760 --> 10:11.760]  but in paper
[10:13.760 --> 10:15.760]  on the paper front
[10:16.760 --> 10:18.760]  what do we have going on
[10:18.760 --> 10:25.760]  on the paper front gold is only up a hundred and something dollars
[10:26.760 --> 10:31.760]  now in a true free market if you can't get your hands on gold and silver
[10:32.760 --> 10:39.760]  it is supposed to go up by a hundred percent maybe two hundred percent
[10:39.760 --> 10:47.760]  in a panic like this it should be at its inflationary price of 1980 now close to three thousand dollars announced
[10:47.760 --> 10:54.760]  but it's not it's at nine hundred and ten dollars last time I checked five minutes ago
[10:54.760 --> 11:01.760]  that sounds like a lot but that is nothing and as they say you ain't seen nothing yet
[11:01.760 --> 11:05.760]  when the public figures out they can't get gold and silver
[11:05.760 --> 11:08.760]  Katie bar the door
[11:09.760 --> 11:12.760]  Katie bar the door
[11:12.760 --> 11:19.760]  that'll be joining us later in the show to tell us from a he's one of the largest independent gold brokers out there
[11:19.760 --> 11:21.760]  what it is like
[11:21.760 --> 11:25.760]  what it is like with some of the best sources in the world
[11:25.760 --> 11:30.760]  that's having to get coins out of Africa out of Asia you name it
[11:30.760 --> 11:35.760]  he's getting them from private owners but they don't want to sell ladies and gentlemen it is a meltdown
[11:35.760 --> 11:41.760]  it is a run on gold with people foaming at the mouth to get it
[11:41.760 --> 11:46.760]  and still only about two percent of the population of investors
[11:46.760 --> 11:50.760]  you can pull those numbers up have moved into physical possession of gold
[11:50.760 --> 11:59.760]  when the paper holders of gold figure out that the positions couldn't be fulfilled
[11:59.760 --> 12:02.760]  you see they've been betting on gold being low
[12:04.760 --> 12:08.760]  and that's what's been covered now on national television across the world they're finally reporting it
[12:08.760 --> 12:11.760]  which is causing the yuppies to run out feverishly looking for it
[12:11.760 --> 12:18.760]  when people that are holding positions at gold at eight hundred and fifty bucks and eight hundred and seven ninety
[12:18.760 --> 12:21.760]  and there's all these different positions out there
[12:21.760 --> 12:27.760]  and when people say okay give me the gold and they have to go cash that in and they can't buy the gold
[12:29.760 --> 12:31.760]  boy that's happening right now
[12:32.760 --> 12:36.760]  and I kept telling people I wouldn't hold paper gold
[12:36.760 --> 12:38.760]  I don't care if it's a receipt for it
[12:38.760 --> 12:41.760]  you are out of your mind
[12:41.760 --> 12:44.760]  if you're holding any paper out there right now
[12:44.760 --> 12:48.760]  but I know we're just always right here
[12:48.760 --> 12:52.760]  why not listen to the mainstream people who are always wrong by design
[12:55.760 --> 12:58.760]  it's not that they're stupid they're in charge they run the media
[12:58.760 --> 13:02.760]  they own the media they're the big private banks that figured out how to take over western countries
[13:02.760 --> 13:05.760]  and get the population to accept their fiat currency
[13:05.760 --> 13:09.760]  for real assets and so they bought up the world
[13:09.760 --> 13:12.760]  and now they don't need us anymore
[13:12.760 --> 13:17.760]  FCC probes role of military analysts in war related broadcast
[13:17.760 --> 13:19.760]  USA Today
[13:19.760 --> 13:25.760]  notice how the media will tell you about the tiniest little edge of Pentagon propaganda in the media
[13:26.760 --> 13:32.760]  meetings with Rumsfeld with all the top military analysts for ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox
[13:32.760 --> 13:38.760]  local channels going in and getting marching orders for television as paid propagandas
[13:38.760 --> 13:42.760]  separately being paid by the Pentagon and not telling the public
[13:45.760 --> 13:47.760]  that's nothing
[13:47.760 --> 13:49.760]  that's nothing
[13:49.760 --> 13:54.760]  compared to billions and billions and billions that we know of
[13:54.760 --> 13:56.760]  around 10 billion a year
[13:56.760 --> 13:58.760]  in fake news
[13:58.760 --> 14:02.760]  going back into the Clinton administration and exploding under Bush
[14:04.760 --> 14:08.760]  there were always agents of influence CIA operatives and assets and
[14:08.760 --> 14:12.760]  people that were being handled by the different scores of private
[14:12.760 --> 14:17.760]  and government intelligence operations who would plant stories be editors
[14:17.760 --> 14:22.760]  work as gatekeepers but in the mid 90s they just said well how about we just pay billions of dollars
[14:22.760 --> 14:25.760]  pay TV networks to produce news
[14:25.760 --> 14:31.760]  to produce the government pays to have an anti-gun or anti-family or anti-male
[14:33.760 --> 14:36.760]  message in their TV programs that has come out
[14:37.760 --> 14:40.760]  and so we sit up here freaking out warning the public
[14:40.760 --> 14:43.760]  that when the Pentagon and the Department of Justice
[14:43.760 --> 14:47.760]  and the Department of Energy and Health and Human Services all of them
[14:47.760 --> 14:53.760]  have 100 million 200 million billion 2 billion 3 billion 4 billion 5 billion
[14:53.760 --> 14:55.760]  depending on the agency
[14:55.760 --> 15:00.760]  budgets just for fake news in the term I coined in the 90s
[15:00.760 --> 15:02.760]  propaganda placement
[15:02.760 --> 15:06.760]  you know when the army buys ads say in a movie
[15:07.760 --> 15:12.760]  like anger management and you see army of one ads throughout the movie
[15:12.760 --> 15:16.760]  on billboards on the sides of walls on magazines everywhere you look
[15:16.760 --> 15:19.760]  yeah I think they pay what it's a million and a half bucks for that
[15:19.760 --> 15:22.760]  that's product placement but if it's a government message
[15:22.760 --> 15:27.760]  using taxpayer money it is propaganda placement
[15:27.760 --> 15:30.760]  and I've got all this financial news and information I want to go over
[15:30.760 --> 15:32.760]  but the point here is
[15:32.760 --> 15:35.760]  we're not in Kansas anymore
[15:36.760 --> 15:40.760]  when thousands and thousands and thousands
[15:40.760 --> 15:42.760]  of reporters
[15:44.760 --> 15:49.760]  are on government payroll secretly and now 26,000
[15:49.760 --> 15:53.760]  preachers and remember we broke this for you a year and a half
[15:53.760 --> 15:54.760]  before it was mainstream news
[15:54.760 --> 15:57.760]  we got the secret documents we had the pastor from Ohio on
[15:57.760 --> 15:59.760]  and another pastor
[15:59.760 --> 16:03.760]  FEMA was waiting for them days later threatening them to shut up
[16:05.760 --> 16:09.760]  telling them you're not welcome in the local hospital the feds did
[16:09.760 --> 16:13.760]  even though one preacher had a big church to come minister to the dying
[16:13.760 --> 16:15.760]  for free
[16:15.760 --> 16:20.760]  such federal control at the hospital was told you're not welcome here pastor
[16:22.760 --> 16:24.760]  and by the way you're being watched
[16:24.760 --> 16:26.760]  and then it came out on in the news that yes
[16:26.760 --> 16:29.760]  26,000 preachers and growing
[16:29.760 --> 16:32.760]  first 13 and 26 this year it's doubling
[16:32.760 --> 16:36.760]  doubling 26,000 50 plus thousand
[16:36.760 --> 16:39.760]  what 54,000
[16:39.760 --> 16:42.760]  and people are calling going yeah my preacher used to be good
[16:42.760 --> 16:45.760]  but now he gave a sermon about turning your guns in
[16:45.760 --> 16:48.760]  and how going to camps was of the Lord and Romans 13 submission
[16:48.760 --> 16:51.760]  and if the government wanted to take your children away let them
[16:56.760 --> 16:59.760]  they are paid to say that
[16:59.760 --> 17:02.760]  they are paid to do that
[17:02.760 --> 17:06.760]  they are paid to push that
[17:06.760 --> 17:09.760]  and suddenly people send me stuff from their Catholic church
[17:09.760 --> 17:12.760]  where there's a handout on Sunday about turning your guns in
[17:12.760 --> 17:16.760]  and not owning guns being of the Lord and doing what the police say
[17:16.760 --> 17:19.760]  and Protestants come into my office
[17:19.760 --> 17:22.760]  people I've known for years like Raymond Teague from his Baptist church
[17:22.760 --> 17:26.760]  and it's said in there you're not allowed to talk about politics
[17:26.760 --> 17:30.760]  even when you're at lunch after church in a church group setting
[17:30.760 --> 17:33.760]  and you were to submit to the government
[17:33.760 --> 17:37.760]  there's been a huge project to do this to steal all our wealth
[17:37.760 --> 17:40.760]  and set up a world government banking system
[17:40.760 --> 17:43.760]  after the bankers engineered the crisis they will then
[17:43.760 --> 17:46.760]  organize and manage the crisis they created
[17:46.760 --> 17:49.760]  and come out as the saviors
[17:49.760 --> 17:52.760]  with a command and control economy
[17:52.760 --> 17:55.760]  that's what they're doing
[17:55.760 --> 17:59.760]  a few days ago I commissioned Paul Watson to do a detailed report
[17:59.760 --> 18:03.760]  he's been so busy he's done a basic one
[18:03.760 --> 18:06.760]  but it's important bankers want world economic government
[18:06.760 --> 18:10.760]  to solve financial crisis they created
[18:10.760 --> 18:13.760]  and he goes through all the mainstream places
[18:13.760 --> 18:15.760]  the media where they're pushing this
[18:15.760 --> 18:17.760]  very important story
[18:17.760 --> 18:20.760]  you may know it's engineered the public still doesn't
[18:20.760 --> 18:25.760]  and a story that has finally captured people's attention
[18:25.760 --> 18:28.760]  yesterday it came out that
[18:28.760 --> 18:31.760]  not only is the
[18:31.760 --> 18:34.760]  former head of Goldman Sachs running the trillion
[18:34.760 --> 18:38.760]  dollar banker takeover handing it over to his own
[18:38.760 --> 18:42.760]  brokerage firm Goldman Sachs and others
[18:42.760 --> 18:46.760]  but that he has appointed his former crony
[18:46.760 --> 18:50.760]  he has appointed
[18:50.760 --> 18:53.760]  Kashkari
[18:53.760 --> 18:57.760]  Goldman Sachs executive Neil Kashkari
[18:57.760 --> 19:00.760]  has been appointed by Paul Watson to dole out the ill-gotten gains
[19:00.760 --> 19:03.760]  of the bailout to the rest of the corporate crooks
[19:03.760 --> 19:06.760]  and finally I was listening to talk radio yesterday
[19:06.760 --> 19:09.760]  in Dallas in Austin out of Houston out of San Antonio
[19:09.760 --> 19:12.760]  flipping through and I heard multiple shows talking about it and saying
[19:12.760 --> 19:15.760]  shows that always been subservient to the system
[19:15.760 --> 19:18.760]  saying I can't believe this this is out in the open
[19:18.760 --> 19:21.760]  this is totally criminal this is complete conflict of interest
[19:21.760 --> 19:24.760]  this is amazing don't they care
[19:24.760 --> 19:27.760]  and the answer is no
[19:27.760 --> 19:30.760]  40% of the country has the electronic voting machines
[19:30.760 --> 19:34.760]  hacked simultaneously from one location in 90 seconds
[19:34.760 --> 19:37.760]  and have been proven
[19:37.760 --> 19:40.760]  the rest of the country has the bubble
[19:40.760 --> 19:43.760]  scantrons which can be hacked as well
[19:43.760 --> 19:46.760]  and have been proven to be and that's why they don't care
[19:46.760 --> 19:49.760]  they are criminal they worked hard to take over
[19:49.760 --> 19:52.760]  they worked hard to militarize the police against us
[19:52.760 --> 19:55.760]  there is no voting and they can do whatever they want
[19:55.760 --> 20:00.760]  unless we stand up stay with me
[20:00.760 --> 20:03.760]  as a parent your biggest fear is getting a phone call
[20:03.760 --> 20:05.760]  that your child has been attacked or worse
[20:05.760 --> 20:08.760]  with your child going to college or moving out on their own
[20:08.760 --> 20:11.760]  it's important to keep these safety tips in mind
[20:11.760 --> 20:13.760]  teach them to be aware of their surroundings
[20:13.760 --> 20:16.760]  walk on well lit paths with friends or students
[20:16.760 --> 20:19.760]  secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment
[20:19.760 --> 20:21.760]  know how to reach campus security
[20:21.760 --> 20:23.760]  always tell someone where they're going
[20:23.760 --> 20:27.760]  to protect their return and always carry a self-defense device

[20:59.760 --> 21:02.760]  have you ever felt like the United States government
[21:02.760 --> 21:04.760]  knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[21:04.760 --> 21:07.760]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures
[21:07.760 --> 21:10.760]  frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds
[21:10.760 --> 21:12.760]  it makes me wonder if the US citizen
[21:12.760 --> 21:14.760]  will ever again have the right to life, liberty
[21:14.760 --> 21:16.760]  and the pursuit of happiness
[21:16.760 --> 21:18.760]  unfortunately with the drug and money laundering act
[21:18.760 --> 21:21.760]  the IRS revenue ruling 6045 of 1984
[21:21.760 --> 21:23.760]  and the trading with the enemy act
[21:23.760 --> 21:26.760]  in Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933
[21:26.760 --> 21:29.760]  some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention
[21:29.760 --> 21:32.760]  for this reason Midas Resources has prepared a report
[21:32.760 --> 21:35.760]  explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately
[21:35.760 --> 21:38.760]  whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not

[21:59.760 --> 22:03.760]  a day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[22:03.760 --> 22:06.760]  a terrorist act of war against this country
[22:06.760 --> 22:09.760]  the enemy struck America on September 11th
[22:09.760 --> 22:11.760]  but who is the enemy?
[22:11.760 --> 22:12.760]  bin Laden
[22:12.760 --> 22:13.760]  this is his ammo
[22:13.760 --> 22:14.760]  we have to look to the Middle East
[22:14.760 --> 22:16.760]  we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[22:16.760 --> 22:19.760]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[22:19.760 --> 22:21.760]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[22:21.760 --> 22:23.760]  inside the United States
[22:23.760 --> 22:26.760]  some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[22:26.760 --> 22:29.760]  very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[22:29.760 --> 22:33.760]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained

[23:19.760 --> 23:22.760]  in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the US
[23:22.760 --> 23:25.760]  grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe

[24:07.760 --> 24:10.760]  I know for a fact
[24:10.760 --> 24:15.760]  that there is almost nowhere in this country where we still have free elections
[24:18.760 --> 24:21.760]  I know for a fact it's been a Pentagon program
[24:21.760 --> 24:28.760]  13 years ago on air I would talk about the electronic voting machines
[24:28.760 --> 24:32.760]  and how they were put into central tabulators
[24:32.760 --> 24:37.760]  and how defense contractors sub companies were producing them
[24:37.760 --> 24:42.760]  and how they had murdered investigators that were trying to expose it
[24:42.760 --> 24:45.760]  and the public would laugh
[24:45.760 --> 24:48.760]  well you're not laughing anymore are you?
[24:48.760 --> 24:55.760]  now is the time to admit the reality of how bad things are
[24:55.760 --> 25:02.760]  only by admitting just how serious our straights are
[25:02.760 --> 25:06.760]  can we turn this around
[25:06.760 --> 25:09.760]  and I'm going to tell people that work for the government
[25:09.760 --> 25:13.760]  FBI, CIA, police, bureaucrats
[25:13.760 --> 25:17.760]  you're going to have it bad off under this new world order
[25:17.760 --> 25:20.760]  and even if you're immoral people
[25:20.760 --> 25:23.760]  you should resist it and say no to it
[25:23.760 --> 25:27.760]  and speak out against it and leak information against it
[25:27.760 --> 25:32.760]  now the majority of people aren't bad they're just ignorant and slovenly
[25:32.760 --> 25:34.760]  and intellectually lazy
[25:34.760 --> 25:37.760]  and have been in denial
[25:37.760 --> 25:40.760]  if you don't grow up
[25:40.760 --> 25:44.760]  and get your head out of the sand you're going to get hurt real bad
[25:44.760 --> 25:48.760]  we're already going to have a depression there's pretty much nothing going to stop that now
[25:48.760 --> 25:52.760]  we tried like the dickens to turn it around
[25:52.760 --> 25:57.760]  but this year I went and I bullhorned with hundreds of other great patriots
[25:57.760 --> 25:59.760]  in Chantilly, Virginia
[25:59.760 --> 26:02.760]  all being stalked and threatened by military intelligence
[26:02.760 --> 26:04.760]  State Department protective detail
[26:04.760 --> 26:07.760]  CIA, FBI, Mossad, you name it
[26:07.760 --> 26:10.760]  we went and bullhorned from 200 feet away
[26:10.760 --> 26:14.760]  world leaders as they met and Richard N. Haas walked outside and gave me a
[26:14.760 --> 26:17.760]  if looks could kill, I'd be lying on the floor
[26:17.760 --> 26:19.760]  stare
[26:19.760 --> 26:22.760]  and we didn't do that because we have a death wish
[26:22.760 --> 26:25.760]  we did that because we needed to draw attention to who the real government is
[26:25.760 --> 26:30.760]  and inside there they were engineering the final pieces of this plan
[26:30.760 --> 26:33.760]  and two Bilderberg group meetings before that
[26:33.760 --> 26:35.760]  two and a half years ago
[26:35.760 --> 26:38.760]  we got the sources, we got the information from the inside
[26:38.760 --> 26:42.760]  and we told you they were going to start this implosion through the subprime mortgage
[26:42.760 --> 26:44.760]  to blame it on the public
[26:44.760 --> 26:47.760]  and exactly what we said happened
[26:47.760 --> 26:49.760]  now
[26:49.760 --> 26:52.760]  when I tell you that they're putting poison in your water
[26:52.760 --> 26:54.760]  and we have top guest on
[26:54.760 --> 26:58.760]  top even sitting EPA top toxicologist on
[26:58.760 --> 27:01.760]  we're not lying, we're telling you the truth
[27:01.760 --> 27:05.760]  when I tell you that thousands of different prepared foods at the store
[27:05.760 --> 27:07.760]  have melamine and other poisons in them
[27:07.760 --> 27:09.760]  you better go look it up and find out it's true
[27:09.760 --> 27:13.760]  I don't know what to do about it, I'm just telling you it's going on
[27:13.760 --> 27:16.760]  and let me tell you it's not an accident, they put it in there
[27:19.760 --> 27:23.760]  when I tell you they've got a federal plan to put half the children in America
[27:23.760 --> 27:25.760]  from around 18% that are currently on it
[27:25.760 --> 27:28.760]  on Prozac type serotonin reuptake inhibitor
[27:28.760 --> 27:30.760]  fluoride based drugs
[27:30.760 --> 27:32.760]  that's what they are
[27:32.760 --> 27:34.760]  and in Fetiman type drugs
[27:34.760 --> 27:37.760]  that's in the new freedom initiative and that got leaked by people inside of it
[27:37.760 --> 27:39.760]  and made mainstream news four years ago
[27:39.760 --> 27:41.760]  and they're now doing it
[27:41.760 --> 27:45.760]  when I tell you that pedophile rings run the congress
[27:45.760 --> 27:47.760]  it's been documented
[27:47.760 --> 27:49.760]  and we have documented it
[27:49.760 --> 27:51.760]  to our peril
[27:51.760 --> 27:52.760]  now listen
[27:52.760 --> 27:55.760]  corporations like to do hostile takeovers
[27:55.760 --> 27:58.760]  the new world order is a global holding company
[27:58.760 --> 28:00.760]  owned by the private central banks
[28:00.760 --> 28:03.760]  that are above what you think of as banking and finance
[28:03.760 --> 28:07.760]  they put in control grids, camera systems, I.D. systems
[28:07.760 --> 28:09.760]  they bragged about it
[28:09.760 --> 28:13.760]  they commissioned MIT 30 years ago to develop the template that was picked up
[28:13.760 --> 28:15.760]  other major universities put in their own
[28:15.760 --> 28:17.760]  prospectus and plan
[28:17.760 --> 28:19.760]  MIT's got picked up
[28:19.760 --> 28:22.760]  they put in electronic voting machines
[28:22.760 --> 28:26.760]  not just the die-bold systems that they all focus on
[28:26.760 --> 28:28.760]  and they're stealing elections coast to coast
[28:28.760 --> 28:31.760]  the polls always match, the exit polls always match
[28:31.760 --> 28:33.760]  now they don't
[28:33.760 --> 28:35.760]  the fraud has come out
[28:35.760 --> 28:38.760]  hundreds of executives and programmers have gone public that it is a fraud
[28:38.760 --> 28:40.760]  it's been proven to be a fraud
[28:40.760 --> 28:43.760]  in just a thousand times a thousand
[28:45.760 --> 28:47.760]  and they mean business
[28:47.760 --> 28:51.760]  they have federalized and militarized the police
[28:51.760 --> 28:53.760]  they have brainwashed them that we're the enemy
[28:53.760 --> 28:56.760]  and that it's for their safety to treat us like garbage
[28:56.760 --> 29:00.760]  and if we even flinch when they say jump
[29:00.760 --> 29:02.760]  if we ask how high
[29:02.760 --> 29:05.760]  that is seen a reason to be tasered
[29:05.760 --> 29:08.760]  Sunshine Project reported
[29:08.760 --> 29:10.760]  in 2000 in every major city
[29:10.760 --> 29:12.760]  there are helicopters

[29:23.760 --> 29:25.760]  they've got VX nerve gas ready
[29:25.760 --> 29:27.760]  that is lethal
[29:27.760 --> 29:30.760]  now if that's a good government

[29:36.760 --> 29:38.760]  that's COG to the elite
[29:39.760 --> 29:43.760]  we ask ourselves how do we get around COG
[29:43.760 --> 29:45.760]  how do we remove these criminals

[35:18.760 --> 35:20.760]  music playing
[35:20.760 --> 35:23.480]  that shows the duality of the of the mind
[35:23.480 --> 35:28.800]  but but my point is that they're i'm not looking for a fight i don't want to fight
[35:28.800 --> 35:34.120]  in a gondiask view it it it exposes them it makes them look bad
[35:34.120 --> 35:38.920]  yet it it it it it exposes their tyranny to let them in some cases
[35:38.920 --> 35:40.880]  abuses and go after us but
[35:40.880 --> 35:43.900]  you see this isn't some british empire in india
[35:43.900 --> 35:46.840]  or this is in a hitlerian system in russia
[35:46.840 --> 35:50.920]  when they were taking over their resistance was absolutely needed
[35:50.920 --> 35:52.280]  in every case
[35:52.280 --> 35:57.280]  this is scientifically crafted where every stage has been planned for
[35:57.280 --> 36:01.280]  they intend to implode the economy by design they intend to get everybody
[36:01.280 --> 36:04.960]  basically on welfare with a government i'd be card that has their cash credits
[36:04.960 --> 36:06.860]  on it
[36:06.860 --> 36:10.360]  and then you'll have that you know how the government certified job even if
[36:10.360 --> 36:13.260]  it's in private industry because those private companies will be federally
[36:13.260 --> 36:13.920]  funded
[36:13.920 --> 36:17.080]  that's what this bailouts about how many years have we told you
[36:17.080 --> 36:20.160]  get everybody in debt implode the economy
[36:20.160 --> 36:23.600]  when they finally fully devalue the currency pump all its final value into
[36:23.600 --> 36:26.960]  their real assets to accelerate consolidation
[36:26.960 --> 36:30.880]  and then shift the economy over into a new deal but not a new deal bill building
[36:30.880 --> 36:32.660]  dams and electrical plants
[36:32.660 --> 36:33.680]  and roads
[36:33.680 --> 36:36.140]  and and rest stops
[36:36.140 --> 36:37.320]  and city buildings
[36:37.320 --> 36:39.640]  and state buildings
[36:39.640 --> 36:41.400]  no ladies and gentlemen
[36:41.400 --> 36:44.760]  it's going to be spying policing checkpoints
[36:44.760 --> 36:46.880]  prison guards
[36:46.880 --> 36:48.640]  data scanning
[36:48.640 --> 36:51.320]  analyzing data that's what the colleges are turning out now
[36:51.320 --> 36:53.480]  is data mining and spying on you in
[36:53.480 --> 36:58.200]  industry by law having to report on everybody
[36:58.200 --> 37:00.520]  web censorship and armies of people
[37:00.520 --> 37:01.680]  in their censoring the web
[37:01.680 --> 37:05.560]  by controlling the economy they can then make people come hat in hand to do
[37:05.560 --> 37:09.160]  almost anything just to get food because now everything has been so
[37:09.160 --> 37:13.320]  centralized and most the family farms and ranches have been shut down
[37:13.320 --> 37:16.880]  most people sold off most their land they might hold twenty thirty forty of
[37:16.880 --> 37:18.280]  their original acres
[37:18.280 --> 37:21.160]  of huge farms they had previously in ranches
[37:21.160 --> 37:23.520]  and then they work in town
[37:23.520 --> 37:29.000]  and then as things implode they won't even be able to be self-sufficient
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.600]  and later in the next hour i'm gonna play part of zeitgeist addendum i want
[37:32.600 --> 37:36.760]  to analyze it i agree with some of the disagree with a lot of it
[37:36.760 --> 37:40.200]  because it's a lot of what i've discussed but i want to look at the flaws
[37:40.200 --> 37:43.600]  in the kind of progressives liberal socialist view
[37:43.600 --> 37:47.840]  through the lens of technological development
[37:47.840 --> 37:50.560]  so that's coming up later
[37:50.560 --> 37:52.720]  the rest of the shower will be in the next hour
[37:52.720 --> 37:56.400]  paul watson is going to be joining us in ted anerson in a few minutes
[37:56.400 --> 37:59.360]  uh... but let me just give you some of the financial news and i'm gonna get into
[37:59.360 --> 38:02.040]  the nerve gas helicopters waiting for you in your family
[38:02.040 --> 38:05.240]  i'm gonna get into the neutron bombs waiting for you in your family
[38:05.240 --> 38:10.600]  how the enemy plans to do this step by step what they plan to carry out
[38:10.600 --> 38:12.480]  and then
[38:12.480 --> 38:13.400]  desperate
[38:13.400 --> 38:19.560]  chance we've got to defeat them but only if you fully activate as info warriors
[38:19.560 --> 38:21.160]  savagely
[38:21.160 --> 38:24.800]  spending at least ten hours a day after your workday fighting the new world
[38:24.800 --> 38:26.960]  order
[38:26.960 --> 38:30.560]  it's simple we can defeat the enemy
[38:30.560 --> 38:33.520]  i've analyzed many weaknesses in their attack pattern though it's the most
[38:33.520 --> 38:36.000]  vicious and wide-ranging and most well-thought-out
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.800]  ever seen as known as the scientific dictatorship by m i t by the pentagon
[38:40.800 --> 38:43.520]  by the brains in london
[38:43.520 --> 38:47.120]  their attack profile is public they have stated what they're doing ladies and
[38:47.120 --> 38:50.440]  gentlemen we have ways to defeat them
[38:50.440 --> 38:55.640]  but we have to act now in this phase it will be near impossible five years into
[38:55.640 --> 39:00.840]  this five years from now if you have it mobilized today like your very life
[39:00.840 --> 39:03.160]  depends on
[39:03.160 --> 39:05.080]  there is no hope
[39:05.080 --> 39:08.880]  and years from now you will remember what i said here on air long after i'm
[39:08.880 --> 39:11.720]  off air because this continues i won't be on air
[39:11.720 --> 39:14.480]  i would give it twelve months maximum
[39:14.480 --> 39:17.920]  the show will not be allowed to go out
[39:17.920 --> 39:21.880]  if people don't get their head screwed on straight if all of you don't activate
[39:21.880 --> 39:27.560]  and get very aggressive and very vocal
[39:27.560 --> 39:30.160]  in the info war
[39:30.160 --> 39:33.200]  it is going to break down into an ongoing civil war
[39:33.200 --> 39:38.080]  the whole anti-al-qaeda anti-system was set up
[39:38.080 --> 39:41.040]  for enemies over there that were manufactured when it really is about
[39:41.040 --> 39:43.120]  attacking the american people
[39:43.120 --> 39:48.160]  and they are want us to fight they want us to kill police and military they want
[39:48.160 --> 39:51.600]  that further breakdown and i'm going to explain that later we have
[39:51.600 --> 39:55.360]  to stop it now
[39:55.360 --> 39:58.240]  the bankers own the banking system and and and they're going to do what they're
[39:58.240 --> 40:01.000]  going to do with congress congress was threatened with martial law last week
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.280]  they didn't pass that we're in martial law
[40:04.280 --> 40:08.200]  when the white house threatens martial law that is martial law
[40:08.200 --> 40:12.200]  that's what pdd fifty one is and when congress acquiesce the terrorism
[40:12.200 --> 40:13.800]  they signed the contract
[40:13.800 --> 40:16.160]  but with a gun to their head a literal gun to their head
[40:16.160 --> 40:18.480]  they signed it saying okay you got financial
[40:18.480 --> 40:24.000]  dictatorial power

[40:33.920 --> 40:38.720]  another report here from cnbc gold prices a double on paper market default
[40:38.720 --> 40:42.200]  you may not care about paper market defaults but you should will tell you
[40:42.200 --> 40:44.080]  what that means
[40:44.080 --> 40:47.560]  bankers want world economic government salt financial crisis they created
[40:47.560 --> 40:50.280]  they're openly admitting they created it and that they
[40:50.280 --> 40:53.360]  want to have the consolidation the financial times of london a year and a

[40:58.400 --> 40:59.680]  don't worry it's care
[40:59.680 --> 41:02.480]  the the international settlement two years ago said that
[41:02.480 --> 41:04.280]  they are engineering it
[41:04.280 --> 41:07.520]  and in the high-level banking documents some of which have been leaked some of
[41:07.520 --> 41:12.520]  which are public fragments of which have been reported on they admit it
[41:12.520 --> 41:15.320]  but that's not for general consumption
[41:15.320 --> 41:19.360]  what we do is we bypass that and get into the white papers where they say they
[41:19.360 --> 41:22.360]  got nerve gas for you and your family
[41:22.360 --> 41:24.960]  this evil government
[41:24.960 --> 41:28.000]  has got crews standing by
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.600]  to spray every city
[41:30.600 --> 41:34.360]  with opiate gases that is declassified sunshine project two thousand that we
[41:34.360 --> 41:37.440]  were two thousand
[41:37.440 --> 41:40.800]  got those documents declassified can you imagine
[41:40.800 --> 41:43.600]  what is classified well we know it's nerve gas
[41:43.600 --> 41:46.080]  now they spray a city save a million
[41:46.080 --> 41:47.880]  with opiate gases
[41:47.880 --> 41:52.280]  only take about twenty helicopters in two runs
[41:52.280 --> 41:56.360]  say that within a few hours more than ten percent of the population will die
[41:56.360 --> 41:58.320]  you'll fall your you'll hit your head
[41:58.320 --> 42:02.400]  cars will wrecked will be fires the fire department will be able to fight them
[42:02.400 --> 42:05.400]  so you're talking about killing a hundred thousand people if they spray an
[42:05.400 --> 42:06.280]  entire city
[42:06.280 --> 42:07.760]  and folks don't think they won't
[42:07.760 --> 42:10.880]  if they think we're about to overthrow the government they are going to launch
[42:10.880 --> 42:15.400]  helicopters and they are going to spray our cities
[42:15.400 --> 42:17.960]  you will see a helicopter coming down
[42:17.960 --> 42:21.640]  you'll you'll you'll see fires in the distance smoke you'll see helicopters
[42:21.640 --> 42:23.000]  flying red patterns
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.280]  and if you don't have gas mask on your loved ones and on your family course
[42:26.280 --> 42:27.600]  they'll be at school
[42:27.600 --> 42:31.840]  and folks see i'm not joking about this
[42:31.840 --> 42:35.640]  now i'm not saying they'll use those but that that's how evil the people that
[42:35.640 --> 42:37.760]  have hijacked our government on
[42:37.760 --> 42:40.040]  that it was declassified eight years ago
[42:40.040 --> 42:43.440]  they're ready to nerve gases okay i'm gonna do it later
[42:43.440 --> 42:46.080]  and again the big british ministry defense report last year said
[42:46.080 --> 42:49.680]  governments will use neutron bombs on their own population if they try to
[42:49.680 --> 42:50.680]  overthrow them
[42:50.680 --> 42:52.680]  you say have a march on washington
[42:52.680 --> 42:54.800]  you say have a march on london
[42:54.800 --> 42:58.760]  a march on berlin throw the criminals out
[42:58.760 --> 43:05.760]  he they're not they're not turning anything over
[43:06.040 --> 43:08.120]  now sustained national
[43:08.120 --> 43:09.560]  strikes
[43:09.560 --> 43:11.620]  are ways to do it
[43:11.620 --> 43:14.160]  but then again they'll shut down the alternative media
[43:14.160 --> 43:17.720]  and then bad mouth everybody and then let the public star there but that's
[43:17.720 --> 43:18.720]  better
[43:18.720 --> 43:21.360]  just saying no
[43:21.360 --> 43:23.360]  and walking away from things
[43:23.360 --> 43:26.760]  for the police and military have to come to their senses
[43:26.760 --> 43:29.800]  and then have an open discussion from the cities
[43:29.800 --> 43:33.560]  taking over the broadcast systems with the federal government with with the
[43:33.560 --> 43:35.720]  criminals have taken control
[43:35.720 --> 43:38.800]  and say what dismantling we want to have an open discussion instead of you
[43:38.800 --> 43:39.960]  lying
[43:39.960 --> 43:43.480]  we want to have open discussions with you
[43:43.480 --> 43:48.560]  we want to have and then you might have an open debate about
[43:48.560 --> 43:51.680]  and then and then at least a stalemate
[43:51.680 --> 43:54.680]  the best we can hope for with these people a stalemate do you want to and
[43:54.680 --> 43:57.000]  of course you're thinking how would you ever get the yuppies in the public
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  figure that out
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.440]  how will you get them to analyze and see the full attack profile in the full
[44:02.440 --> 44:05.720]  plan
[44:05.720 --> 44:08.660]  if not it's going to be the total takeover the economy and intensified
[44:08.660 --> 44:10.880]  police state and then controlled
[44:10.880 --> 44:17.920]  eugenics extermination of the majority of us one child policies total control
[44:17.920 --> 44:21.520]  we either get this monkey off our back okay but i don't want to be holding for
[44:21.520 --> 44:22.600]  fifteen minutes
[44:22.600 --> 44:25.360]  or twelve minutes i am
[44:25.360 --> 44:28.280]  i wanted to bring him up because he's he's gone around around about just a few
[44:28.280 --> 44:29.800]  gold coins
[44:29.800 --> 44:32.560]  because you know that their banks aren't safe over there and there's runs on
[44:32.560 --> 44:34.360]  those as well
[44:34.360 --> 44:35.760]  and uh...
[44:35.760 --> 44:39.280]  instead of reading the daily express gold rushes bullion
[44:39.280 --> 44:42.480]  has a glitzy future investors worry about the state of the markets
[44:42.480 --> 44:45.760]  i've started a gold rush buying in the bullion stocks and impressive numbers
[44:45.760 --> 44:47.840]  analyst yesterday
[44:47.840 --> 44:49.080]  and then it talks about
[44:49.080 --> 44:51.560]  huge lines of customers have been
[44:51.560 --> 44:54.880]  congregating outside the offices of a t s bullion in london people
[44:54.880 --> 44:57.000]  in their hopes on gold in the answer
[44:57.000 --> 45:00.480]  and it goes into germany and russia everywhere else the gold is sold out
[45:00.480 --> 45:03.200]  most of the old shops in the u s of the sold out for weeks
[45:03.200 --> 45:04.640]  i keep telling you this
[45:04.640 --> 45:08.840]  paul watson uh... what are you seeing anyone being there on the ground
[45:08.840 --> 45:11.160]  hello i think it's good to be back
[45:11.160 --> 45:14.440]  yeah basically i've spent the last two afternoons
[45:14.440 --> 45:16.800]  desperately trying to buy
[45:16.800 --> 45:18.200]  gold coins
[45:18.200 --> 45:20.680]  you know just three or four gold coins
[45:20.680 --> 45:24.920]  i tried eighty s bullion which is in the subway hotel in london which you
[45:24.920 --> 45:27.280]  just mentioned
[45:27.280 --> 45:31.240]  physically don't have the people to answer the phone there's people queuing
[45:31.240 --> 45:32.680]  up around the block
[45:32.680 --> 45:36.880]  and they just don't answer the phone they haven't for the past two days
[45:36.880 --> 45:40.080]  now the second biggest gold dealer in britain britain
[45:40.080 --> 45:42.120]  is based in blackpool
[45:42.120 --> 45:44.880]  yesterday i couldn't get through to them today
[45:44.880 --> 45:47.640]  i finally managed to get through and they had one
[45:47.640 --> 45:49.200]  one ounce gold coin
[45:49.200 --> 45:51.000]  this is the second biggest
[45:51.000 --> 45:52.800]  gold dealer in britain
[45:52.800 --> 45:55.520]  and they've got what they're having just to keep their doors open they're having
[45:55.520 --> 46:01.000]  to keep you know you happy as a customer by limiting days ago one coin
[46:01.000 --> 46:02.480]  per person
[46:02.480 --> 46:06.920]  uh... and the same thing in germany and russia they are sold out meanwhile
[46:06.920 --> 46:09.960]  they still suppressed the price of gold it's only gone up a hundred dollars it
[46:09.960 --> 46:11.640]  should have gone up thousands
[46:11.640 --> 46:14.800]  now again it shows the paper market is a fraud paul
[46:14.800 --> 46:16.560]  exactly and
[46:16.560 --> 46:18.680]  you know that the price of gold
[46:18.680 --> 46:22.480]  the interbank lending rate of gold which is currently what about nine nine
[46:22.480 --> 46:24.840]  oh nine oh eight or something like that
[46:24.840 --> 46:28.600]  that is being deliberately suppressed because it doesn't correlate with the
[46:28.600 --> 46:32.680]  reality of what people are prepared to pay for gold
[46:32.680 --> 46:34.160]  you can go and look at
[46:34.160 --> 46:38.960]  auctions on ebay dot com which ended on friday the third of october when gold
[46:38.960 --> 46:41.720]  was at eight three four an ounce
[46:41.720 --> 46:46.120]  and people are bidding in one case for a one ounce crew grand
[46:46.120 --> 46:50.240]  nine three eighty that was the final bid which is a twelve percent premium over
[46:50.240 --> 46:55.120]  what the price was on and it really is as bullion as it gets because it has a
[46:55.120 --> 46:56.360]  paul over it
[46:56.360 --> 47:00.440]  uh... because of uh... part time which is ridiculous is excellent gold
[47:00.440 --> 47:01.360]  yeah and it's
[47:01.360 --> 47:02.720]  difficult to get there
[47:02.720 --> 47:04.600]  but twelve percent premium
[47:04.600 --> 47:07.360]  over the price of gold on friday
[47:07.360 --> 47:11.680]  and there was a there was a silver bar which ended up going for seventy four
[47:11.680 --> 47:16.320]  percent over the price of uh... an ounce of silver also on friday the third
[47:16.320 --> 47:17.360]  of october
[47:17.360 --> 47:18.760]  so that shows you that
[47:18.760 --> 47:23.840]  the demand for gold is so intense and the supply can't match it that
[47:23.840 --> 47:24.800]  people
[47:24.800 --> 47:28.840]  well you know prepared to pay over the odds and the the interbank lending rate
[47:28.840 --> 47:31.160]  doesn't correlate with reality
[47:31.160 --> 47:34.120]  i want to get here is back in the gold in a minute
[47:34.120 --> 47:37.200]  but you've written an article bankers want world economic government
[47:37.200 --> 47:39.600]  to solve financial crisis they created
[47:39.600 --> 47:42.480]  one in telegraph wall street journal they're all saying world government run
[47:42.480 --> 47:43.440]  by the bankers
[47:43.440 --> 47:46.600]  that engineered this we told people over a decade ago
[47:46.600 --> 47:49.280]  the trial at all said in the seventies they were going to engineer this
[47:49.280 --> 47:51.200]  we're seeing the master
[47:51.200 --> 47:52.800]  corporate takeover
[47:52.800 --> 47:54.000]  by design
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.960]  happen and then you've got the british
[47:55.960 --> 47:58.680]  head of all this who's a top bill deberg member
[47:58.680 --> 48:00.360]  secretary peter
[48:00.360 --> 48:04.000]  mandelson tell tell folks about that
[48:04.000 --> 48:05.520]  well mandelson
[48:05.520 --> 48:06.680]  of course
[48:06.680 --> 48:09.920]  was that his prominence when blare first came into power
[48:09.920 --> 48:13.520]  he's a key bill deberg member he's one of the upper echelon
[48:13.520 --> 48:15.600]  and he's been brought back in
[48:15.600 --> 48:19.360]  right at this key time of the u k business secretary
[48:19.360 --> 48:21.120]  to oversee the
[48:21.120 --> 48:22.800]  centralization of
[48:22.800 --> 48:24.320]  power
[48:24.320 --> 48:26.240]  in the banking system
[48:26.240 --> 48:27.480]  and we called it
[48:27.480 --> 48:30.840]  uh... back in january two thousand and six when
[48:30.840 --> 48:35.160]  the united nations called for a new organization to be set up
[48:35.160 --> 48:37.720]  worth seven trillion dollars
[48:37.720 --> 48:38.720]  to quote
[48:38.720 --> 48:39.600]  applied
[48:39.600 --> 48:43.200]  six specific financial tools which would
[48:43.200 --> 48:46.280]  then they go on to make the case basically told the problems of the
[48:46.280 --> 48:49.880]  world and how did the central banks say we're going to cure
[48:49.880 --> 48:51.440]  this they say a new bubble
[48:51.440 --> 48:56.240]  that will be cut cap and trade taxes in flat out carbon credit taxes paid
[48:56.240 --> 48:57.760]  directly
[48:57.760 --> 48:59.800]  to the private central banks
[48:59.800 --> 49:01.760]  i mean that is direct payment
[49:01.760 --> 49:05.000]  to the bankers they are becoming government
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.040]  and this u n plan said
[49:07.040 --> 49:10.920]  it was an admission quote that the nation state is an old-fashioned concept
[49:10.920 --> 49:14.840]  that has no role to play in modern globalized world where financial markets
[49:14.840 --> 49:17.880]  have to be harnessed rather than simply condemned
[49:17.880 --> 49:19.280]  so that was them
[49:19.280 --> 49:22.680]  you know nearly three years ago now talking about the need for a new seven
[49:22.680 --> 49:27.160]  trillion body so the very people that have engineered all this
[49:27.160 --> 49:31.920]  and now getting private banking power to the treasury with the fed doing the
[49:31.920 --> 49:35.240]  same thing in england and the same thing in europe the banks are taking over
[49:35.240 --> 49:38.240]  handing all the people's money over to themselves
[49:38.240 --> 49:42.240]  and while their media they own tells us they're the good guys and bow down to
[49:42.240 --> 49:44.040]  them
[49:44.040 --> 49:45.400]  exactly
[49:45.400 --> 49:46.840]  and it was uh...
[49:46.840 --> 49:51.680]  followed the month later in february two thousand six which we also wrote about
[49:51.680 --> 49:53.280]  when the uh...
[49:53.280 --> 49:58.040]  scandal-ridden bank for international settlements the b i s
[49:58.040 --> 50:02.800]  which it was involved in that the money laundering during world war two
[50:02.800 --> 50:07.400]  also called for a centralized banking system in a global currency
[50:07.400 --> 50:11.440]  and that was in february two thousand six million folks you can go back to
[50:11.440 --> 50:14.640]  my films you can go back to every we told you they would have engineer a
[50:14.640 --> 50:17.240]  global financial meltdown
[50:17.240 --> 50:20.360]  by issuing too much liquidity and derivatives
[50:20.360 --> 50:24.120]  while they bought real assets imploding it and then offering a world banking
[50:24.120 --> 50:27.640]  government as the solution and what happened exactly what we said
[50:27.640 --> 50:29.520]  and what happened we say months ago
[50:29.520 --> 50:33.080]  we said they are manipulating the paper market in gold
[50:33.080 --> 50:34.240]  to keep it down
[50:34.240 --> 50:38.440]  but physically it's running out of now what happened we know the enemy attack
[50:38.440 --> 50:41.280]  profile few others do
[50:41.280 --> 50:44.840]  now instead of me saying this is the only place to get the information
[50:44.840 --> 50:46.560]  we're the only ones that know it
[50:46.560 --> 50:48.440]  no i'm freaked out by that
[50:48.440 --> 50:51.960]  tell everybody tell the other patriot shows half of them don't even
[50:51.960 --> 50:55.960]  understand i mean this is so simple you gotta read the enemy documents
[50:55.960 --> 51:01.200]  we're under attack poll watch and stay with us from the u.k.
[51:01.200 --> 51:06.760]  question is the world getting better or vastly worse

[55:18.840 --> 55:21.160]  people freaking out things plunging
[55:21.160 --> 55:24.360]  the uh... private bank of england rough child bank is grabbing up everything
[55:24.360 --> 55:26.880]  basically what's happening
[55:26.880 --> 55:30.520]  what's happening is it an exact mirror of what's happening in america is a
[55:30.520 --> 55:32.840]  globally coordinated
[55:32.840 --> 55:33.720]  uh...
[55:33.720 --> 55:37.480]  port for a centralized and should centralization of power into fewer
[55:37.480 --> 55:41.280]  hands that's what it's always been about they create the problem and now
[55:41.280 --> 55:46.760]  they're gonna arrive with the solution which is more powerful themselves
[55:46.760 --> 55:50.840]  for those that just joined us american engels gone but the men saying no more
[55:50.840 --> 55:52.880]  gold we told you folks
[55:52.880 --> 55:56.480]  two weeks ago that it was just above those but our internal sources said
[55:56.480 --> 55:58.140]  they couldn't get gold
[55:58.140 --> 56:01.760]  i'm going to enter somewhere in the next hour paul only about twenty minutes
[56:01.760 --> 56:02.840]  ten anderson
[56:02.840 --> 56:05.840]  again when i'm gonna pitch gold to your right now we're gonna do that later but
[56:05.840 --> 56:08.600]  ted literally has gold
[56:08.600 --> 56:10.840]  at the prices it was
[56:10.840 --> 56:12.100]  monday
[56:12.100 --> 56:14.080]  i guess that's uh... just a day ago
[56:14.080 --> 56:15.360]  or so
[56:15.360 --> 56:16.960]  yet he has it
[56:16.960 --> 56:21.040]  seventy five no no he's going to break a hundred dollars
[56:21.040 --> 56:25.360]  under what it is not only does he have the gold and the silver
[56:25.360 --> 56:26.360]  he has it
[56:26.360 --> 56:31.240]  a hundred dollars under what it currently is new you could try to buy it out of
[56:31.240 --> 56:32.040]  the wacky
[56:32.040 --> 56:35.480]  i mean we are in the prime position here
[56:35.480 --> 56:39.920]  because we understand the enemy profile and you know we're always a step ahead
[56:39.920 --> 56:41.920]  because we've analyzed the enemy
[56:41.920 --> 56:45.700]  but i want to get into this as a broker ted thirty years in the business
[56:45.700 --> 56:47.360]  thirty years in the business
[56:47.360 --> 56:50.200]  and and and having the sources worldwide to do this but you told me this
[56:50.200 --> 56:52.560]  morning you said you may not have gold in a few days
[56:52.560 --> 56:54.520]  it is you've never it's never happened
[56:54.520 --> 56:55.640]  it's running out
[56:55.640 --> 56:59.280]  and i've got all these big minds saying they're maximum production
[56:59.280 --> 57:03.080]  others have been shut down because of environmental rules ted what is going on
[57:03.080 --> 57:05.880]  well that's exactly what's going on right now i'm talking to my dealers
[57:05.880 --> 57:08.960]  across the world and i do business all over the place
[57:08.960 --> 57:13.000]  and uh... everybody's talking about how hard it is to find gold to find enough
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.760]  supply to fill the demand
[57:14.760 --> 57:18.880]  i mean i'm really really lucky to be connected as well as i am because i have
[57:18.880 --> 57:19.640]  gold
[57:19.640 --> 57:22.560]  but a lot of my people i mean i've had another competitor just the other day
[57:22.560 --> 57:25.200]  call me up and he says where you're getting the stuff from i don't have
[57:25.200 --> 57:27.200]  anything how can i get something
[57:27.200 --> 57:30.080]  and uh... and that's their problem right now doesn't the problem finding
[57:30.080 --> 57:31.640]  customers that want to buy it
[57:31.640 --> 57:35.000]  i mean everybody's got that right now nobody you know the biggest problem is
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.360]  having gold to sell
[57:36.360 --> 57:39.000]  the canada way to add you could come out and say
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.400]  you know nine hundred and fifty bucks a thousand dollars an ounce right now
[57:42.400 --> 57:44.680]  you could easily do that but you're not
[57:44.680 --> 57:48.480]  you're not doing that that you are giving people the deal you said in the
[57:48.480 --> 57:49.640]  gold you secured
[57:49.640 --> 57:53.000]  yeah it's more important that we get golden people's hands right now that
[57:53.000 --> 57:54.520]  it is to try to make the big
[57:54.520 --> 57:57.640]  fat box right now that's what the wall street people are doing
[57:57.640 --> 57:59.080]  with this mortgage thing
[57:59.080 --> 58:02.600]  it's it's not about raping and looting i tell you right now people have to have
[58:02.600 --> 58:03.900]  gold in their hands
[58:03.900 --> 58:06.440]  and uh... and when you when you're buying gold
[58:06.440 --> 58:10.200]  at this nine hundred dollar level what we see nine hundred twenty so far today
[58:10.200 --> 58:11.640]  in gold spot
[58:11.640 --> 58:13.120]  i mean it
[58:13.120 --> 58:15.760]  people need to have gold and they need to have a lot of gold in their
[58:15.760 --> 58:17.080]  portfolios in there
[58:17.080 --> 58:20.320]  but not only is almost everybody else sold out
[58:20.320 --> 58:21.920]  sold out period
[58:21.920 --> 58:23.320]  ted has it
[58:23.320 --> 58:27.680]  close to a hundred dollars i guess more than a hundred dollars
[58:27.680 --> 58:31.840]  less than it's currently trading for ladies and gentlemen
[58:31.840 --> 58:34.440]  this is

[1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:36.440]  waking people out is the sheer overboardness of it all
[1:00:36.440 --> 1:00:39.200]  we're lucky to have the owner of this network being a thirty-year golden
[1:00:39.200 --> 1:00:40.880]  silverbroker
[1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:44.840]  and that's one of the best connections in the world because he can confirm
[1:00:44.840 --> 1:00:48.200]  what the british papers u.s. papers german papers are reporting a habit all
[1:00:48.200 --> 1:00:50.120]  here in front of me
[1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:54.280]  there are lines in germany lines in russia lines in japan the gold is sold
[1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:54.800]  out
[1:00:54.800 --> 1:00:57.120]  in ninety eight percent of the areas
[1:00:57.120 --> 1:00:59.840]  most gold brokers can't get anything
[1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:02.240]  gold is selling at ten twenty thirty
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:04.320]  percent premiums
[1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:07.240]  and that's because the market is rigged and here's the key is what i want to
[1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:10.080]  ask anerson about them are going to paul watson
[1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:14.920]  on cnbc and other channels are finally admitting some of the truth
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:18.040]  because they can't hide lines of people battering down doors basically to get
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:19.600]  golden silver
[1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:22.600]  the physical market has been on fire it's getting very very hard to buy one
[1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:24.080]  ounce gold coins
[1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:25.240]  the smaller bars
[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:27.160]  most jewelry shops have been running out
[1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:29.640]  so we have a supply problem said kenner
[1:01:29.640 --> 1:01:33.800]  kenners on cnbc there was a two-tier market in gold
[1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:37.200]  the one on wall street where the bankers continue to gamble
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:39.640]  and see they've been betting on it low to keep it low
[1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:41.600]  now they're getting called on this one thing to do
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:43.880]  and the physical market which is red hot
[1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:47.600]  and demand is outstripping supply i think we're going to get very close
[1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:50.800]  where we see the environment where the paper contracts on precious metals
[1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:51.960]  defaulting
[1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:55.400]  now you know what that means folks that's a nuclear
[1:01:55.400 --> 1:01:58.800]  nuclear issue says nuclear
[1:01:58.800 --> 1:02:00.800]  bomb if that happens it's not happening
[1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:04.440]  and with what we're going to get a massive price increase the overall prices
[1:02:04.440 --> 1:02:06.680]  a precious metals said kenner
[1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:09.760]  also where he predicted gold ago after the paper market
[1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:12.920]  broke down kenner said the expected gold double in price in a very short
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:13.800]  period of time
[1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:14.960]  it will spike
[1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:16.400]  quite fast he added
[1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:18.040]  if you had a oil rally
[1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:21.600]  from sixty five hundred forty in nine months i think it can double in gold
[1:02:21.600 --> 1:02:24.880]  in a much shorter period because the market is much much smaller
[1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:26.000]  kenner said
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:28.200]  that's
[1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:32.080]  your good kenner ceo swiss asia capital told cnbc this morning
[1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:35.920]  the flight from paper currencies as a result of global interest rate cuts
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:39.400]  will lead to a doubling in the price of gold within a short period
[1:02:39.400 --> 1:02:43.200]  as demand for physical precious metals outstripped supply causing paper
[1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:45.160]  contracts on gold default
[1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:46.560]  cad
[1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:50.080]  we're already starting to see some default water explained that the explain
[1:02:50.080 --> 1:02:53.240]  what a default is a lot of default as it just means that's
[1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:56.400]  that somebody can cover the margin calls usually have to sell everything you
[1:02:56.400 --> 1:02:59.400]  have in order to cover the margin column when you don't have anything left and
[1:02:59.400 --> 1:03:02.760]  you're defaulting on it means that you can they've been selling gold vault
[1:03:02.760 --> 1:03:04.440]  reserves that didn't exist
[1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:07.800]  they they do and that just means there's nothing to cover we have short sellers
[1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:10.480]  that are in the marketplace meaning they don't have the gold but they're still
[1:03:10.480 --> 1:03:11.440]  selling it
[1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:14.160]  they're having to borrow it from the central banks to do this that's our
[1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:17.240]  most of this the gold that covers short sales comes from
[1:03:17.240 --> 1:03:20.600]  and with the gold prices rising you could the margin calls just kill these
[1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:22.400]  people that are trying to sell short
[1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:26.160]  and i keep the market suppressed but it's like a darn rubber band it's like
[1:03:26.160 --> 1:03:30.360]  like you said holding a beach ball underwater when that becomes splashing up
[1:03:30.360 --> 1:03:33.880]  people have these huge margin calls and that's why the defaults and that's just
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:35.720]  going to cause further calamity but
[1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:38.600]  thank god we have the government can avail these people out when they have
[1:03:38.600 --> 1:03:39.520]  problems
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:42.960]  i tell you that there was a secret meeting just held just last night
[1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:46.200]  and all the central banks of the world the g seven got together and they all
[1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:50.360]  decided to slash interest rate by the way those are owned by private families
[1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:53.440]  yep the private families got together they said guess what we're all gonna
[1:03:53.440 --> 1:03:55.720]  lower the interest rates all at once
[1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:59.700]  and that way not one currency is gonna falter against another everybody's
[1:03:59.700 --> 1:04:04.280]  currency is gonna fall at the same time that's why i'm calling currency means
[1:04:04.280 --> 1:04:07.160]  milk goes up gas goes up to see
[1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:10.360]  ladies and gentlemen that it's called inflation go ahead
[1:04:10.360 --> 1:04:13.240]  yeah it is that's it that's exactly what that is lowering the interest rates
[1:04:13.240 --> 1:04:16.800]  is going to drive people out of the out of the paper currency is not only are
[1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:18.360]  they gonna have massive
[1:04:18.360 --> 1:04:22.120]  tens of trillions globally in quote funding themselves stealing money it's
[1:04:22.120 --> 1:04:22.960]  not a bailout
[1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:24.160]  in a criminal
[1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:26.080]  vertical integration
[1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:29.040]  they're also going to lower rates which they've now done which further
[1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:29.960]  accelerates
[1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:31.580]  hyperinflation i mean ten
[1:04:31.580 --> 1:04:35.680]  this is the ultimate perfect storm it is it's a while so you have a fifty
[1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:39.760]  dollar increase in just overnight from yesterday today on the spot price of
[1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:42.880]  gold that's because they've lowered the interest rates and they're devaluating
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:43.840]  currencies
[1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:48.920]  across the entire globe and paul watson cannot get gold in england
[1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:50.600]  he can't
[1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:54.680]  gold in england and it's starting to happen here in the united states

[1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:48.840]  a new world order
[1:08:49.560 --> 1:08:54.440]  all right ten Anderson Paul Watson I'm ranting here because
[1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:58.200]  we are witnessing the true new world order being born
[1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:01.960]  through the full financial implosion first they had to stage the terror attacks
[1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:05.080]  to militarize the police put in the control grid
[1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:09.960]  for the criminal consolidation over the public now they're moving ahead
[1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:14.440]  with that Paul Watson again uh getting into what's happening with the gold
[1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:20.120]  markets your take on that well yeah I eventually managed to buy some gold
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:27.320]  of somebody's private collection and he told me that he paid 16 pounds for this
[1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:32.360]  old 20 dollar one ounce american eagle back in the 50s or 60s I think it was
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:38.920]  he paid 16 pounds for it and here I am today paying nearly 600 pounds for it
[1:09:38.920 --> 1:09:43.400]  one ounce of gold cost 16 pounds back then but now it cost 600 why because the
[1:09:43.400 --> 1:09:48.360]  currency is devalued now the the dollar is going up
[1:09:48.360 --> 1:09:51.880]  which normally means that gold goes down but gold's going up as well
[1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:57.000]  because the you know the centralized globalized interest rate cuts have
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:01.880]  produced a camouflage whereby people can't see that all the currencies are
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:06.360]  devaluing against each other because gold continues to go up
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:10.760]  I mean today gold hit a record high if it you know priced in euros
[1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:15.080]  which shows you that let's explain that by dropping other currencies with the
[1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:18.200]  interest rate cut because then people don't buy those currencies
[1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:20.600]  that makes it look like the dollar's gone up
[1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:24.440]  it's another slide of hand go ahead Paul exactly
[1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:27.800]  it makes it look like the dollar is going up just because the euro and
[1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:31.960]  pounds sterling are suffering so much but in real terms over the course of the
[1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:35.800]  next few years that dollar is going to buy you less and less and less
[1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:40.040]  which is proven by the fact that even though the dollar is apparently going
[1:10:40.040 --> 1:10:43.640]  up so is gold that it takes more and more of
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:47.720]  those dollars to buy one ounce of gold because it's being devalued by
[1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:52.840]  the unrestricted printing of billions and trillions of more dollars to
[1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:56.440]  buy out these crooks on wall street now Paul I want to let Ted go here in a
[1:10:56.440 --> 1:11:00.120]  minute I want to get into something that's finally
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:04.680]  gotten the sheeple to look up from grazing to witness the wolves around them
[1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:07.880]  the fact that we not only is the former head of Goldman Sachs who has hundreds
[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:12.360]  of millions invested in it giving himself billions now publicly running it
[1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:16.200]  he now has hired his assistant to dole out the money to him
[1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:20.120]  I mean this is just totally criminal violates a whole bunch of federal
[1:11:20.120 --> 1:11:22.680]  loss but it's like McCain goes to England
[1:11:22.680 --> 1:11:26.120]  those lords Rothschild's house raises millions of dollars every dollar of a
[1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:29.880]  felony and then the FBI just stands down I mean they
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:34.360]  are practicing criminality in front of us they just
[1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:38.440]  don't care so I want to get into that but
[1:11:38.440 --> 1:11:43.080]  Ted you've got a gold offer you have Frank's you have some other coins
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:46.440]  um I talked to other gold dealers yesterday I didn't just believe the
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:49.720]  newspapers for you though I believed you I called four other gold dealers
[1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:52.360]  yesterday and they said we're gone well we don't
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:55.320]  have eagles we don't have Frank's we don't have anything you could get it's
[1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:58.200]  gone we've got collector coins for two
[1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:00.920]  thousand dollars an ounce we've got collector coins
[1:12:00.920 --> 1:12:06.040]  you know a thousand dollars over spot Ted Anderson doesn't just have
[1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:09.000]  coins that are sending him a smack to have collector value
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:13.800]  right at bullion prices he has it a hundred plus dollars
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:17.720]  under what he was offering just a few days ago because he went in and bought a
[1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:20.840]  bunch of these so it's Ted marking things up now that it's like he already
[1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:24.360]  filled his gas tanks at the gas station here's the analogy
[1:12:24.360 --> 1:12:28.440]  Ted already filled the truck came and let's say he paid two dollars a gallon
[1:12:28.440 --> 1:12:31.400]  for the gas and then he's and then he's going to mark it up
[1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:34.920]  to 230 so he has money to you know run his little business and pay his
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:39.400]  employees have the lights on now gas just jumped
[1:12:39.400 --> 1:12:43.560]  to three dollars a gallon but it's Ted marking that up to make a profit because
[1:12:43.560 --> 1:12:47.080]  he bought the gas early no he's leaving it in the tank
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:51.640]  at the price he bought it and passing on 70 cents a gallon savings is basically
[1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:54.760]  the analogy that fits with the numbers Ted is that accurate
[1:12:54.760 --> 1:12:57.880]  yeah that's exactly how it works i've locked in and i've got the ability to
[1:12:57.880 --> 1:13:01.240]  sell it at the price i do because i've locked in a lot of dealers will move
[1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:04.280]  their prices up right away and perhaps i should too
[1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:07.640]  but you know the main thing is right now we've got a lot of people that are
[1:13:07.640 --> 1:13:10.760]  listening to this everybody knows they need to own gold they're all
[1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:13.640]  scraping to liquidate whatever it is they have to get it
[1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:17.000]  we've got we've got phones ringing off the hook just like everybody else has
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:18.920]  and i apologize if you can't get through
[1:13:18.920 --> 1:13:22.680]  there was one point in time i know that we filled up i we got like 36
[1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:26.120]  trunks we can take simultaneously 36 calls
[1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:29.320]  and i think they all were filled at one moment you know and that's
[1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:33.560]  we're working on getting more of that too but i tell you at this particular
[1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:37.240]  time i mean it is as obvious as you know i mean
[1:13:37.240 --> 1:13:41.240]  it you've got a nose on your face you also better have gold in your pocket
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:44.040]  you know what i'm saying i mean that's just the way it is right now at this
[1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:47.000]  time you've got the central banks of the world
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:50.120]  simultaneously trying to drop the interest rates
[1:13:50.120 --> 1:13:53.800]  to hide the fact that one currency is falling against the other
[1:13:53.800 --> 1:13:57.720]  and then the commodity prices come up a hundred bucks an ounce
[1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:01.160]  just from monday to the day and i've got something that i picked
[1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:05.560]  picked up last friday and i'm offering it to you at friday's price and i can hold
[1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:08.280]  on to this for just a very short period of time
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:11.400]  and then i'm gonna have to raise my prices because i've sold out
[1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:14.760]  and now i gotta go into the marketplace and you know and and secure new
[1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:18.040]  positions which i'm always trying to do but i can tell you right now
[1:14:18.040 --> 1:14:21.560]  there's so much so much trouble going on in the marketplace
[1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:26.280]  that anybody that has any assets and any paper investment at this particular
[1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:29.160]  time you better take a darn serious look at it
[1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:32.520]  because it's going to hit everything it's going to hit your stocks by the way
[1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:35.080]  up right now the dow Jones industrial average
[1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:38.920]  down two hundred and fifteen points we're almost at nine thousand right now
[1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:42.280]  and it wasn't on what five hundred yesterday yeah and we're we're you
[1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:45.800]  last monday they're afraid that it might drop below ten now it's dropping below
[1:14:45.800 --> 1:14:48.680]  nine where do you suppose the bottom is are we going to be looking at a two
[1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:52.520]  thousand dollar down who are the only people that were exactly right years
[1:14:52.520 --> 1:14:55.720]  before about exactly when it would happen or how would happen
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:14:59.240]  us and i even had a lot of economists only said no this will happen in the
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:02.360]  year or two and i said no it's happening sooner
[1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:06.600]  and it's going to get folks the enemy is moving on as you can see it i can't
[1:15:06.600 --> 1:15:10.200]  believe other people can't see it look i want to get into all this other
[1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:13.560]  financial news but bottom line ted tell them the gold coins you've got again
[1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:17.480]  what we have right now we have that we have the uh ten dollar indians the
[1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:21.080]  ten dollar liberties same prices i offered them to them to you guys on
[1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:25.800]  monday and currently right now let me just put pull that up real quick
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:29.720]  they are currently right now at six seventy three three for the indian
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:33.800]  and the liberty coin right now is trading at
[1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:39.240]  hang on a second it is six hundred and six hundred and fifty three

[1:17:30.360 --> 1:17:33.560]  paul let's go ahead and get into the flagrantness
[1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:37.240]  this article you wrote fox guarding the henhouse x goldman sacks
[1:17:37.240 --> 1:17:41.880]  exact oversee bailout oh yeah this is the uh
[1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:46.280]  neil cashing carry guy is the uh jokingly named him
[1:17:46.280 --> 1:17:51.000]  who was the ceo of goldman sacks and is now being appointed to oversee the
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:56.280]  bailout which will primarily benefit banks like goldman sacks of course which
[1:17:56.280 --> 1:18:01.960]  hank paulson was a former um head of goldman sacks in 2006
[1:18:01.960 --> 1:18:05.880]  so conflict other than the article you know conflict of interest doesn't even
[1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:10.520]  come close it is the uh fox guarding the henhouse and
[1:18:10.520 --> 1:18:15.080]  as you told me yesterday even the hardline neocons who would just blindly
[1:18:15.080 --> 1:18:18.040]  support anything that the bush administration did a
[1:18:18.040 --> 1:18:23.080]  up in arms about this so that shows you that it's really becoming that blatant
[1:18:23.080 --> 1:18:26.600]  that um even those kind of cool a drinking neocons are
[1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:33.080]  furious about it well you know the point i hear from local neocons is their
[1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:36.040]  mouths hanging open they're like does the government not care about anything or
[1:18:36.040 --> 1:18:39.240]  they completely criminal and the callers all calling an agree
[1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:42.600]  yes folks they're criminal that they've already done enough to be locked up in
[1:18:42.600 --> 1:18:46.280]  prison for a trillion years so they're going for broke don't you
[1:18:46.280 --> 1:18:49.880]  understand that and they got a bunch of militarized brainwashed cops and
[1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:53.800]  military we're in deep trouble paul
[1:18:53.800 --> 1:18:57.960]  yeah and uh what it represents is i mean we've got an article on
[1:18:57.960 --> 1:19:03.640]  prisonplanet.com today which is about operation Bernhardt which was a
[1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:10.520]  Nazi act of war against britain in 1942 uh during which they used
[1:19:10.520 --> 1:19:14.680]  jewish prisoners to counterfeit hundreds of millions of
[1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:18.840]  dollars worth of british pounds and flood the british economy with the
[1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:23.240]  with this counterfeit money and it you know eventually the british
[1:19:23.240 --> 1:19:26.760]  pound lost its status as world reserve currency
[1:19:26.760 --> 1:19:31.560]  it was an act of economic warfare and it's exactly what we see the federal
[1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:34.760]  reserve and the bankers doing to america today
[1:19:34.760 --> 1:19:38.760]  flooding the economy with what to all intents and purposes
[1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:41.960]  is counterfeit money. Let's be clear they're flooding it to themselves
[1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:44.840]  while it still has some value in buying real assets
[1:19:44.840 --> 1:19:48.120]  while leaving us holding the bag to pay it back in taxes

[1:24:12.600 --> 1:24:15.960]  live i got an easy job all it is
[1:24:15.960 --> 1:24:19.160]  recover my documents and track their history
[1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:26.600]  study their mo not come on there and i tell you like it is and then you
[1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:33.320]  everybody washes and unfold the enemy will be defeated
[1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:38.920]  later in the show i'm going to talk about how we can do that
[1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:41.880]  in fact i don't think i'll even take calls i think i'm going to talk for two
[1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:48.040]  plus hours just on the enemy operation and that is the solution
[1:24:48.040 --> 1:24:56.360]  knowing the enemy operation knowing who the enemy is he is half the battle
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:25:00.440]  the true enemy in warfare it's not as easy
[1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:05.080]  as we were taught to identify the enemy but once they've been identified they
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:07.960]  can be defeated paul why do you think the establishment
[1:25:07.960 --> 1:25:11.960]  doesn't care they could have you know appointed some other globalist crony
[1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:15.160]  to hand out the trillions and it's five trillion not seven hundred eight
[1:25:15.160 --> 1:25:18.440]  her billion to themselves why hire
[1:25:18.440 --> 1:25:21.320]  a guy that looks like lex luther just like paulson
[1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:24.760]  uh... who even has the last name cash and carry
[1:25:24.760 --> 1:25:29.080]  i mean you can't make this stuff up uh...
[1:25:29.080 --> 1:25:34.600]  again it's just so over the top because they don't care
[1:25:34.600 --> 1:25:38.760]  that's right because they're so obsessed with the centralizing power into the
[1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:40.600]  people who they can trust will
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:46.280]  dole out the ill-gotten gains of the bailout amongst themselves and uh...
[1:25:46.280 --> 1:25:49.480]  i mean talk about flooding the money supply
[1:25:49.480 --> 1:25:54.280]  did you know that uh... the uh... definition of hyperinflation as it was
[1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:58.520]  in the weimar republic before nazi germany
[1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:03.480]  is uh inflation over three years approaching one hundred percent
[1:26:03.480 --> 1:26:07.880]  now correct me if i'm wrong but when you do your weekly shopping at the
[1:26:07.880 --> 1:26:12.840]  grocery store how much does for example a pint or a gallon of milk cost now
[1:26:12.840 --> 1:26:17.880]  compared to three years ago in many cases it's a hundred percent more
[1:26:17.880 --> 1:26:21.320]  though the real rate of inflation is being kept down
[1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:24.920]  but i mean the elite don't care because they know that the worst the worst it
[1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:30.040]  gets the more people call for uh... draconian solution also wal-mart admits
[1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:33.000]  they will lose money on milk and eggs and butter and staples
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  to run ads to suck people in because they're a global combine
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:40.280]  and they get all the poison food from china they will do that just to put
[1:26:40.280 --> 1:26:42.920]  their competition on a business
[1:26:42.920 --> 1:26:48.520]  exactly don't care i mean alex i used to feed myself on fifty pounds and it
[1:26:48.520 --> 1:26:51.800]  lasted me two weeks this is in two thousand and three
[1:26:51.800 --> 1:26:57.320]  i'm now spending a hundred and thirty pounds a week
[1:26:57.320 --> 1:27:00.200]  so it's gone from twenty five pounds a week
[1:27:00.200 --> 1:27:08.120]  to a hundred and thirty pounds a week in the space of five years
[1:27:08.120 --> 1:27:11.400]  well i know that england has really high food prices because of importation so
[1:27:11.400 --> 1:27:13.400]  inflation hurts you there even more
[1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:17.400]  what what is happening with your poor population i know here
[1:27:17.400 --> 1:27:22.360]  you see good-looking families homeless now
[1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:27.080]  you know it's not normal why no
[1:27:27.080 --> 1:27:30.360]  well they're just caked in mountains and mountains of debt they still get
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:33.080]  sent credit card through the post uh...
[1:27:33.080 --> 1:27:36.600]  so that's what they're living on i mean what because the bankers take that
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:41.000]  credit card debt and call it an asset and then sell it to other investors
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:44.120]  that means your mayor who sells your pension fund into it
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:48.440]  it's a way to steal it go ahead and laugh government people you're going to get
[1:27:48.440 --> 1:27:50.840]  everything you want go ahead paul
[1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:54.760]  exactly obviously the overarching
[1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:58.280]  agenda is what they've called for all along which is a
[1:27:58.280 --> 1:28:03.160]  you know it's what gordon brown called a quote a new global financial order
[1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:07.560]  uh to supersede the institutions created after world war two
[1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:10.760]  and as you mentioned peter mandelson earlier
[1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:15.400]  he uh recently argued that global solutions aren't either because quote
[1:28:15.400 --> 1:28:19.800]  the machinery of global economic governance barely exist
[1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:24.120]  adding it's the time for a breton woods of this century
[1:28:24.120 --> 1:28:28.280]  and this was in a telegraph article saying you know we need a global economic
[1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:31.480]  police saying our world government is embryonic it's time for it to go
[1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:35.000]  prime time right because the the usual
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:39.080]  lungs behind the world the march world government the u n and the i m f and the
[1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:43.080]  world bank they've kind of used up their political capital now people
[1:28:43.080 --> 1:28:46.360]  like what they're all about years ago they said that it's like shark teeth
[1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:49.480]  it it it builds it and then later they come up with new institutions
[1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:53.080]  yeah they have to supersede their own corrupt institutions because people
[1:28:53.080 --> 1:28:56.200]  know what they're all about and they create the crisis
[1:28:56.200 --> 1:29:00.760]  um to get the pretext to do that and the article added the opinion the quote
[1:29:00.760 --> 1:29:04.440]  opinion is now hardening around the case for a new global architecture to
[1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:07.800]  enforce rules that ensure lessons are learned
[1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:11.320]  so this is a call for a new global economic policemen
[1:29:11.320 --> 1:29:14.760]  and the media is saying we're spoiled and evil in europe and the united states

[1:34:23.720 --> 1:34:29.000]  as they militarily economically psychologically spiritually attack the
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:33.640]  world population viciously publicly setting the
[1:34:33.640 --> 1:34:36.440]  precedent to commit any crimes they wish just like the
[1:34:36.440 --> 1:35:00.040]  seizures of old
[1:35:00.040 --> 1:35:03.240]  all right closing out with Paul Watson then i want to get into the other news
[1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:08.120]  and cover what the new world order is
[1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:12.200]  and break down ways to stop them ways to turn this around
[1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:15.720]  key information coming up Paul so much else is happening
[1:35:15.720 --> 1:35:18.680]  with this economic takeover it's stated it's obvious
[1:35:18.680 --> 1:35:22.120]  it's in their own documents and it totally freaks me out that even a lot of
[1:35:22.120 --> 1:35:26.120]  the alternative media you know it's quaint they like to imagine this is
[1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:29.080]  this is by accident when it's in the imf world bank documents it's in the
[1:35:29.080 --> 1:35:31.800]  trilateral commission plans it's what they've done in third world country at
[1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:34.440]  the third world country they're consolidating all the power under
[1:35:34.440 --> 1:35:37.000]  themselves they premeditated we got ready with the
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:41.960]  military and police the whole things are set up stated and that's the key
[1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:45.720]  message that we've got to get out the people
[1:35:45.720 --> 1:35:49.320]  exactly i mean to know that it was staged
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:53.080]  all you have to do is look at the solutions that they're offering and
[1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:57.480]  in every single case it's centralization of power into fewer hands
[1:35:57.480 --> 1:36:01.560]  and you know if the same people offering that solution caused the problem in the
[1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:05.480]  first place then you know that it was staged these things don't happen by
[1:36:05.480 --> 1:36:08.680]  accident you don't get the global banks
[1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:13.320]  coordinating the rate cut of 50 points on the same day by accident do you they
[1:36:13.320 --> 1:36:18.280]  met beforehand to agree on it though this is this is not by accident and you
[1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:21.880]  know we're going to reap the consequences of it while the bankers
[1:36:21.880 --> 1:36:25.320]  the that's right sleep well in the knowledge that they'll still get their
[1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:30.520]  bonuses from mr. cash and carry well the public is mad thinking that this is
[1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:33.960]  just going to be paid back in taxes but that they're getting some of it
[1:36:33.960 --> 1:36:39.000]  you're getting none of it folks i mean this is all going in to fund the new
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:42.360]  world order and they're saying openly that it'll be a world
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:44.680]  government run by the private banking families
[1:36:44.680 --> 1:36:50.280]  you will pay taxes to them that is stated and you will you will pay the carbon
[1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:53.080]  tax as well as another key element of it
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:56.760]  creating the post industrial revolution which uh
[1:36:56.760 --> 1:37:01.800]  burrow so called for it's about making sure people have no disposable income
[1:37:01.800 --> 1:37:05.640]  whatsoever that they live on a near subsistence subsistence
[1:37:05.640 --> 1:37:09.000]  breadline level people better watch daniel estalin
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:13.160]  in in game breaking it all down we didn't just come on the air and say this
[1:37:13.160 --> 1:37:16.760]  and i'm not people need to listen to us we're not look this show and what you
[1:37:16.760 --> 1:37:21.240]  do we all need to be respected we have told people exactly what's going on
[1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:24.280]  and people better pay attention to i know they are
[1:37:24.280 --> 1:37:29.960]  but look i mean this only gets worse from here unless we turn this around
[1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:33.480]  well what are your ideas on ways to turn this around
[1:37:33.480 --> 1:37:37.800]  well expose who's behind it and trying to see back the reins of control
[1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:41.080]  obviously ron paul is behind the move to abolish the
[1:37:41.080 --> 1:37:44.600]  third and that would be a start but it's just getting passed
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:49.320]  as you said this myopia that this is all happened by accident and so now is a
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:53.560]  big failure for the for the elite which i was the case how did we on this show
[1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:56.760]  predicted exactly as it would happen years ago
[1:37:56.760 --> 1:38:00.760]  right and another another thing you asked before was about you know how
[1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:05.880]  are poor people getting by when you've got inflation food inflation so high
[1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:09.880]  well you know it's when oil went up to one four five they said oh this is the
[1:38:09.880 --> 1:38:12.600]  reason for food inflation this is why you're paying
[1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:17.080]  fifty a hundred percent more because certainly in the uk it takes
[1:38:17.080 --> 1:38:21.080]  it takes a lot of oil to get all the food over here and that was an overlay
[1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:25.640]  contributor but not all of it yeah and now oil's come back down again to
[1:38:25.640 --> 1:38:28.840]  eighty or ninety dollars a barrel and what's happened to the food prices
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:32.280]  they remain the same or even gone up but it's
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:36.440]  it's still possible to get food quite cheap in the supermarket in britain if
[1:38:36.440 --> 1:38:39.960]  it's the msg laden crap that gives you cancer
[1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:43.800]  so that's the option that they're giving people meanwhile for example if you
[1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:48.600]  want to get free range eggs or free range chicken you're paying
[1:38:48.600 --> 1:38:53.560]  upwards of twelve fourteen dollars just to get that
[1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:57.160]  so that you know they'll make you know they'll make the msg laden crap
[1:38:57.160 --> 1:39:02.520]  available for a cheap price though look you get a big old slab of slimy
[1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:06.040]  crap tasting chicken of you know six seven eight
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:08.440]  breasts for like five dollars but if you want
[1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:12.920]  two juicy delicious healthy that it tastes totally different
[1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:17.320]  free range organic chicken it's like fifteen bucks for two chicken breasts
[1:39:17.320 --> 1:39:22.200]  exactly i mean here you can get basically three pounds for twelve
[1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:26.040]  free range eggs but if you get the battery farmed eggs it's a pound
[1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:30.840]  so for that giving people that option but i mean it's going to lead to a
[1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:34.360]  widespread health problems if people are eating this crap but obviously they
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:38.600]  don't radiated they're radiating the crud meat they spray it with live viruses
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:43.000]  and do not laugh right down on your notepad cops drive along in their cars
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:49.480]  meat sprayed with viruses they spray it with viruses that then quote eat deadly
[1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:52.840]  bacteria but what really makes you sick with those bacteria
[1:39:52.840 --> 1:39:57.400]  is their excretia their excrement that's what gives you that's what's toxic
[1:39:57.400 --> 1:40:01.400]  that's what hurts you so it doesn't it doesn't oh it's unbelievable
[1:40:01.400 --> 1:40:05.320]  paul right and there's there's another report today about
[1:40:05.320 --> 1:40:09.240]  pesticides linked to brain cancer there was one yesterday about
[1:40:09.240 --> 1:40:14.600]  pesticides and chemicals being used in white sugar that now you cannot buy
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:17.640]  gum in a regular supermarket forget a small store
[1:40:17.640 --> 1:40:22.280]  that doesn't have aspartame in it which big huge reports coming out admitting
[1:40:22.280 --> 1:40:26.280]  massive brain damage that's why 25 year olds are getting Alzheimer's now
[1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:31.000]  i mean we are under scientific blast attack
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:34.440]  yeah tell me about it i mean i have to mail order my gum off the internet in
[1:40:34.440 --> 1:40:38.280]  bulk i have to mail order toothpaste off the internet because they're removing
[1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:41.400]  the non-fluoride from the supermarkets
[1:40:41.400 --> 1:40:46.360]  and then you get stuff reports like you know st john's war plan as effective as
[1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:51.000]  prozac but the EU and the codex elementaries are trying to ban these
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:55.640]  things you know i've got 4200 vitamin c i wonder how
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:40:59.160]  long it is before they ban that the real things that
[1:40:59.160 --> 1:41:03.880]  help people have good health are under attack while the crap is being marketed
[1:41:03.880 --> 1:41:07.320]  to them but the government loves us paul
[1:41:07.320 --> 1:41:10.920]  they want to help us i'm sure they do
[1:41:10.920 --> 1:41:15.880]  is that called in credit well that's why we need more people listening to the
[1:41:15.880 --> 1:41:19.480]  show more people visiting prison planet dot com and full wars dot com
[1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:22.440]  because we understand what's happening our guests know what's happening we're
[1:41:22.440 --> 1:41:26.600]  telling people the truth i'm sorry it's not a happy reality but we didn't make
[1:41:26.600 --> 1:41:31.000]  this reality we've been trying to fight it and throughout history tyrants will
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:34.440]  go as far as the public lets them and people can't believe what's happening
[1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:38.440]  now you ain't seen nothing yet folks they are going to make all of this we told
[1:41:38.440 --> 1:41:42.520]  you about martial law plans and then not with a bang but with a whimper
[1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:45.480]  congressman go on tv come on the show and say
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:49.000]  we were told blood in the streets martial law that the president would do
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:53.160]  this banker takeover if we say no so they're told
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:56.120]  do this or you're under martial law and then the bill gives them martial law
[1:41:56.120 --> 1:41:59.320]  economic powers i mean they didn't get happened
[1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:02.920]  it's happening it's in cnn they want to use the army on us
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:06.040]  the british papers reporting there to use the army and police on you
[1:42:06.040 --> 1:42:09.240]  because they know they're engineering something that's going to make society
[1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:12.920]  break down and then the government's going to come in and manage what they
[1:42:12.920 --> 1:42:17.400]  created to their private owners god it's just horrible paul
[1:42:17.400 --> 1:42:20.840]  and i'm happy to hear yuppies and know-it-alls on the street going along
[1:42:20.840 --> 1:42:23.560]  with the government said we've got to do what they say they'll make it better
[1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:26.600]  no they won't every time you give in and only going to get worse
[1:42:26.600 --> 1:42:29.880]  i told you last week i said when this bailout passes
[1:42:29.880 --> 1:42:33.640]  it's a banker takeover bill they're going to kill the market after that
[1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:37.720]  and what happened exactly what i said again i'm not even smart
[1:42:37.720 --> 1:42:40.600]  i think these people have told us what they're going to do
[1:42:40.600 --> 1:42:45.800]  all we've got to do is believe them uh
[1:42:45.800 --> 1:42:49.880]  oh the response to that was to be oh you just you've got to give them time to
[1:42:49.880 --> 1:42:53.560]  dole this money out it hasn't had his chance to take effect yet and who's
[1:42:53.560 --> 1:42:57.880]  doling it out the ex-executive of goldman sachs
[1:42:57.880 --> 1:43:02.120]  when the treasury secretary's goldman sachs right
[1:43:02.120 --> 1:43:04.520]  you got that article in front of you i'm gonna take a minute break i'm gonna let
[1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:07.640]  you go read that article read it's a short article
[1:43:07.640 --> 1:43:11.400]  up on info wars dot com prism panna dot com everybody needs to see this because
[1:43:11.400 --> 1:43:13.640]  when people that do see this it finally wakes them up
[1:43:13.640 --> 1:43:17.000]  it's up to you to move the ball to reach out to people so they know
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:19.960]  criminals took control that isn't a figure of speech
[1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:24.200]  real live criminals pirates like in a movie
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:29.000]  but they've got control of the government you understand
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:34.200]  go ahead and tell them yeah the article is um
[1:43:34.200 --> 1:43:38.920]  fox guarding the henhouse ex-goldman sachs exec to oversee bailout
[1:43:38.920 --> 1:43:42.760]  now that hank paulson the u.s treasury in the federal reserve robbed american
[1:43:42.760 --> 1:43:45.720]  taxpayers of a some likely to run into the trillions
[1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:49.640]  the coup de grace has arrived in the form of ex-goldman sachs executive neil
[1:43:49.640 --> 1:43:53.640]  cash carry who has been appointed by paulson to dole out the ill-gotten
[1:43:53.640 --> 1:43:56.760]  games of the bailout to the rest of the corporate crooks
[1:43:56.760 --> 1:44:00.440]  conflict of interest doesn't even come close the fox guarding the henhouse is
[1:44:00.440 --> 1:44:04.360]  more accurate summation and the fact that he looks like a cross between
[1:44:04.360 --> 1:44:08.360]  nosferatu and a villain from a steven sigal movie doesn't help
[1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:12.760]  we got his picture up on the article many people agree
[1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:17.640]  cash carry a former paulson advisor to do has been appointed bailouts are in a
[1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:20.920]  move so repugnantly crony that it almost makes the michael
[1:44:20.920 --> 1:44:25.400]  brown debacle look innocent in comparison the fact that paulson himself
[1:44:25.400 --> 1:44:27.960]  was head of goldman sachs before joining the bush
[1:44:27.960 --> 1:44:31.400]  hunter in 2006 was not enough for these people
[1:44:31.400 --> 1:44:34.920]  they had to put a banker in charge of bailing out other bankers
[1:44:34.920 --> 1:44:38.680]  who can now soundly sleep knowing that their multimillion dollar bonuses
[1:44:38.680 --> 1:44:42.760]  are in safe hands while the real economy goes down the toilet
[1:44:42.760 --> 1:44:46.760]  however such a brazenly corrupt appointment is even waking up
[1:44:46.760 --> 1:44:51.080]  kool-aid drinking neocons and making them understand the bailout exactly for what
[1:44:51.080 --> 1:44:54.600]  it is a monumental looting of the american people
[1:44:54.600 --> 1:44:57.720]  and the crowning of a new fiscal dictatorship
[1:44:57.720 --> 1:45:02.440]  run by the federal reserve and the private banks
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:06.680]  and that's the article that paul you need to take all the stories we've written
[1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:11.720]  and posted in the last five six years on this and do a big flashback section
[1:45:11.720 --> 1:45:15.960]  and beg remember the yuppie sending us threatening emails and dig banning us
[1:45:15.960 --> 1:45:19.880]  and saying we were creating a panic you know writing these articles and people
[1:45:19.880 --> 1:45:23.160]  calling me a fairmonger when i was reading imf world bank
[1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:26.920]  trilateral commission documents where they said they would do it
[1:45:26.920 --> 1:45:31.080]  and i was having a Nobel prize winner who blew the whistle from the inside on
[1:45:31.080 --> 1:45:34.280]  i'm bad you're bad because we tried to stop this
[1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:38.280]  because we went to bilderberg and i got basically clapped in irons
[1:45:38.280 --> 1:45:43.240]  trying to bring you this information we're bad because we warned people
[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:46.680]  well there's a difference between spelling out long-term agenda which is
[1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:49.640]  being announced on the record and for example
[1:45:49.640 --> 1:45:53.560]  saying that all u.s banks and atm's are going to close this week which other
[1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:56.760]  people did and that was clearly fear mongering and then we exposed that as
[1:45:56.760 --> 1:45:59.240]  government disinfo and then we're bad for that too
[1:45:59.240 --> 1:46:03.480]  yeah and then where where behind the fear mongering for some reason
[1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:06.680]  when that was an echo of white house talking points
[1:46:06.680 --> 1:46:11.240]  difficult to understand but yeah we've been on it for years and now it's
[1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:14.760]  unfolding and i think people are finally starting to give
[1:46:14.760 --> 1:46:18.520]  us a little bit more credit than they might have done before
[1:46:18.520 --> 1:46:21.720]  well it's all i can do to sit here and watch it unfold paul it's tearing my
[1:46:21.720 --> 1:46:26.680]  guts out it is absolutely tearing my guts out
[1:46:26.680 --> 1:46:29.880]  because this means they're going for broke i mean we already knew that but to
[1:46:29.880 --> 1:46:34.440]  see it happen to know something's going to happen but to see it happens another
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:37.240]  and to know they're going to bring this thing down over the next few years till
[1:46:37.240 --> 1:46:40.280]  there's rioting in the streets and then they'll set the precedent with the
[1:46:40.280 --> 1:46:42.840]  troops quelling it and then oh see the precedent set
[1:46:42.840 --> 1:46:45.800]  the troops keep you safe and the yuppies will go along with that
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:50.600]  and then the secret arrest will settle in and the spies on the street corners and
[1:46:50.600 --> 1:46:54.760]  everything they're openly setting up just god help us god
[1:46:54.760 --> 1:46:59.560]  help us it's just so and that's why they don't care
[1:46:59.560 --> 1:47:03.880]  that's why it's so funny to them and they and they are just going to devalue
[1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:08.200]  our currency it's going to destroy all none of you are going to get to retire
[1:47:08.200 --> 1:47:11.400]  and they're out hoaxing that well the american people you know they got into
[1:47:11.400 --> 1:47:14.840]  debt too much now the globalist set up an economy where it was impossible for
[1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:17.800]  the average person to not be in debt and told you it was normal and it was good
[1:47:17.800 --> 1:47:21.160]  to do and told you globalism and napkin gat were good
[1:47:21.160 --> 1:47:25.960]  they set all this up they took over the farms and ranches they deindustrializes
[1:47:25.960 --> 1:47:28.440]  they paid tax incentives to leave the country
[1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:32.120]  they brag they've done it all they practiced mercantilism like the
[1:47:32.120 --> 1:47:36.760]  british empire did here 250 years ago that led to the revolution
[1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:40.920]  this is an economic warfare of imperium
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:47.640]  closing comments watson well the the one question that hangs over it all with
[1:47:47.640 --> 1:47:52.440]  the agenda becoming so blatant as it bubbles to the surface because
[1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:55.640]  that's the only way they can finally push it through is to
[1:47:55.640 --> 1:47:59.320]  have that revelation of the method will
[1:47:59.320 --> 1:48:04.280]  americans who are waking up to all this be put to sleep again for four or eight
[1:48:04.280 --> 1:48:08.600]  years with the obama sleeping gas method where
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:13.400]  you know apparently we get change and he sweeps the power of promise in change
[1:48:13.400 --> 1:48:17.000]  and people go back to sleep for four years while they consolidate everything
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:20.040]  and then they start the agenda again that's the question
[1:48:20.040 --> 1:48:23.960]  but it seems as if no they're just gonna go for broke and do it all
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:29.320]  as soon as possible anyway well either way you got the old good old boy
[1:48:29.320 --> 1:48:33.000]  overseeing the takeover or even better the blackface
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:36.280]  running marshal law while the troops machine gun inner city people
[1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:39.480]  you know well he had to do it i mean it's just totally disgusting
[1:48:39.480 --> 1:48:45.080]  right out of central casting well i think the neoliberal method of getting
[1:48:45.080 --> 1:48:49.160]  things done is always it takes a little it takes longer to get done but it's
[1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:53.240]  always more successful in the long term so it remains to be seen if they
[1:48:53.240 --> 1:48:59.720]  go down that method go down that route absolutely well paul watson create that
[1:48:59.720 --> 1:49:03.240]  giant section of see we told you so you know
[1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:07.320]  we need to have a major mobilization of the listeners
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:11.000]  to get the message out that this was engineered by design and explain it to
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:16.840]  people it's very simple and the people need to know
[1:49:16.840 --> 1:49:20.920]  and then you understand the bailout is a banker marshal law takeover
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:23.720]  and still no one is reporting what was on c span
[1:49:23.720 --> 1:49:28.520]  that the congress was told marshal law that is the biggest news
[1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:31.880]  i mean politically that's bigger than 911 for what that really means that
[1:49:31.880 --> 1:49:35.560]  means we're in it now that's why the government is so criminal that's why
[1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:38.680]  they don't care they've been given corporate marching orders and they
[1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:42.440]  are implementing it they are doing it they are moving forward come
[1:49:42.440 --> 1:49:47.000]  heller high water and the police and military and
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:49.560]  government bureaucrats and everybody carrying this out
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:53.880]  you are destroying yourselves i know you were taught you were the elite it was
[1:49:53.880 --> 1:49:56.440]  the state against the people and you were the guardians of the system
[1:49:56.440 --> 1:50:00.360]  this is the death of the system and the birth of something far worse
[1:50:00.360 --> 1:50:04.920]  just understand that and know that when you are living far below the poverty
[1:50:04.920 --> 1:50:08.760]  line as government minions remember you get it to yourself but you know the
[1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:12.600]  cops are out there even more in austin squeezing writing tickets for the
[1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:16.120]  smallest of reasons now just everywhere raising money for themselves
[1:50:16.120 --> 1:50:20.200]  and and folks as the economy gets worse and worse they're going to squeeze you
[1:50:20.200 --> 1:50:23.560]  and who's going to be punished as those that saved and didn't get into debt
[1:50:23.560 --> 1:50:26.760]  you're going to be squeezed they're going to seize your assets the irs is
[1:50:26.760 --> 1:50:30.920]  bulking up to get really vicious and mean and and and and now those of you
[1:50:30.920 --> 1:50:34.120]  that have served the system you're going to find out what tyranny really is so
[1:50:34.120 --> 1:50:36.440]  get ready for it paul watson thanks for spending

[1:55:34.680 --> 1:55:38.520]  will be regulated and controlled where fireplaces are banned where
[1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:42.440]  you have bureaucrats in your home every week a block captain
[1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:45.640]  that checks you for carbon crimes that's all been announced now it's being
[1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:48.680]  implemented in the u.s. england and other areas
[1:55:48.680 --> 1:55:52.360]  your carbon taxes will be paid to the local government state government
[1:55:52.360 --> 1:55:57.480]  federal government regional government and directly to the private banks
[1:55:57.480 --> 1:56:01.320]  we told you that years ago from the club of rome and un documents now it's
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:04.680]  being publicly proposed you can say well the people won't go
[1:56:04.680 --> 1:56:06.920]  for that the private banks are just seizing the
[1:56:06.920 --> 1:56:12.040]  governments and telling congress if you don't like it you can have martial law
[1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:15.160]  the british government's been caught that is the criminal element of it
[1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:18.680]  the illegitimate part spying on every member of parliament
[1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:22.120]  trying to set them up in blackmail them again the unelected part the criminal
[1:56:22.120 --> 1:56:26.520]  part uh... it's a they're just completely out of control it's called tyranny
[1:56:26.520 --> 1:56:29.400]  that happens in ninety nine percent of the time in history
[1:56:29.400 --> 1:56:34.680]  and somehow they taught the public tyranny couldn't exist in the west
[1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:37.480]  which is so childlike they were able to sell the public on that
[1:56:37.480 --> 1:56:40.040]  so the public went to sleep they said the media says there's no government
[1:56:40.040 --> 1:56:44.520]  corruption go to sleep and then they took over
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:47.240]  or the corruption is always only in one party
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:53.400]  and now they're setting up the scientific dictatorship
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:56.600]  they plan to
[1:56:56.600 --> 1:57:01.000]  in a controlled consolidated fashion bring the world economy down
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:04.280]  then re monetize the debt through a new world
[1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:08.120]  banking system broken up into four major
[1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:14.520]  regional currencies the north american currency
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:18.520]  the central and south american and caribbean currency
[1:57:18.520 --> 1:57:23.080]  the asian currency and of course the european union currency and you will
[1:57:23.080 --> 1:57:26.360]  have sub derivation subgroups of all those currencies
[1:57:26.360 --> 1:57:30.280]  but they're all the same numbers the same stamps the same tracking system just
[1:57:30.280 --> 1:57:34.360]  like we all have national ID cards i told you in nineteen ninety seven
[1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:39.320]  in america story about design i had the federal documents i show them i read
[1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:44.200]  them on screen but it still says texas driver's license
[1:57:44.200 --> 1:57:47.800]  new york driver's license but it's federalized a federal number in a
[1:57:47.800 --> 1:57:52.520]  federal database comprende audio's freedom
[1:57:52.520 --> 1:57:56.440]  and now they admit that's what it is again i'm no genius i just read the
[1:57:56.440 --> 1:58:00.360]  executive order signed in ninety three by her clinton
[1:58:00.360 --> 1:58:04.040]  and continued by every president they disagree on rhetoric but the program is
[1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:12.040]  exactly the same always getting worse
[1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:15.240]  so i'm going to break down what the new world order is what it's going to look
[1:58:15.240 --> 1:58:19.640]  like and where this financial crisis is going and then
[1:58:19.640 --> 1:58:23.080]  how we can counter them now if i get into too many details is that i've done
[1:58:23.080 --> 1:58:26.440]  this many times in peace here a piece there i want to just basically state the
[1:58:26.440 --> 1:58:29.080]  program and then go back over the evidence of it
[1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:31.880]  and then talk about how we fight it because i go into rabbit trails and
[1:58:31.880 --> 1:58:35.080]  the tail each subsection and go into those files in my brain
[1:58:35.080 --> 1:58:38.680]  and cover them we'll never get it all covered all right stay with me key
[1:58:38.680 --> 1:58:43.320]  transmission spread ahead

[1:58:51.240 --> 1:58:56.040]  today unlike any other in the long course of american history a terrorist act of
[1:58:56.040 --> 1:59:00.600]  war against this country the enemy struck america on september 11th
[1:59:00.600 --> 1:59:05.080]  but who is the enemy bin laden this is his m o we have to look to the middle
[1:59:05.080 --> 1:59:07.320]  east we have to look to the psalm of bin laden
[1:59:07.320 --> 1:59:11.080]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[1:59:11.080 --> 1:59:14.440]  ties to intelligence networks inside the united states
[1:59:14.440 --> 1:59:18.520]  some u.s investigators believe that there are israelis again very much engaged
[1:59:18.520 --> 1:59:24.280]  in spying in and on the u.s i'm aware that some israeli citizens have been
[1:59:24.280 --> 1:59:29.000]  detained and laden's connections to the cia the hijackers ties to the fbi the
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:31.960]  saudi arabian connection the israeli intelligence network

[1:59:47.080 --> 2:00:00.520]  terrorists
[2:00:05.480 --> 2:00:10.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[2:00:10.280 --> 2:00:17.000]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:25.080]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:34.120]  i am breaking down what the global corporate crime syndicate is up to
[2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:37.880]  to set up police states in the united states and europe
[2:00:37.880 --> 2:00:42.680]  as well as around the world and to set up an international computer system
[2:00:42.680 --> 2:00:46.840]  worldwide to get governments involved uh... all your governments want to be
[2:00:46.840 --> 2:00:53.320]  involved in drug criminalization illegal drug criminalization
[2:00:53.320 --> 2:00:57.560]  because there's such great profits in it in those governments
[2:00:57.560 --> 2:01:00.840]  uh... either have a large stake in the drug trade or fully control it
[2:01:00.840 --> 2:01:04.440]  and so by having a black market they might make much larger profits
[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:08.520]  they also get to uh... then the private banks and companies that own the drug
[2:01:08.520 --> 2:01:12.280]  cartels uh... they get to then also own prison systems
[2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:16.600]  that are also very very profitable both the taxpayers and the slave labor
[2:01:16.600 --> 2:01:19.560]  for 20 cents an hour is basically what it is that also displaces
[2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:23.080]  and drives down wages in the host nation that the
[2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:27.400]  local slaves don't pick up on her figure out
[2:01:27.400 --> 2:01:33.240]  and so they use that crisis and the crime that sprouts up around it the drug
[2:01:33.240 --> 2:01:36.120]  gangs is sprout up around it with the low level or
[2:01:36.120 --> 2:01:39.720]  distributing the drugs and fighting with each other over the drugs
[2:01:39.720 --> 2:01:44.840]  over the street distribution they use that and that boost crime homes being
[2:01:44.840 --> 2:01:47.960]  invaded people being shot that creates more fear
[2:01:47.960 --> 2:01:51.240]  uh... cops get scared a bunch of them get killed in a phony drug war
[2:01:51.240 --> 2:01:54.840]  who aren't on the take or some who are on the take then they get to expand their
[2:01:54.840 --> 2:01:57.800]  numbers they get to get militarized and federalized
[2:01:57.800 --> 2:02:00.440]  i mean what the cops have to do if it wasn't for the phony drug war that's
[2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:04.840]  more than half of what they do
[2:02:04.840 --> 2:02:09.000]  and so uh... they sort of have in the military secretly 25 years ago do drug
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:13.080]  raids gun raids all over the country when it was totally illegal
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:16.600]  create those secret relationships with intelligence agencies and the police
[2:02:16.600 --> 2:02:19.800]  departments to corrupt the police get involved in the drug
[2:02:19.800 --> 2:02:23.960]  dealing as well then they start staging terror
[2:02:23.960 --> 2:02:27.400]  attacks to scare the public and have constant bomb
[2:02:27.400 --> 2:02:31.160]  drills where they blow up cars which has the perception of real terrorism
[2:02:31.160 --> 2:02:33.880]  where they treat every cardboard box on the side of the street is a great threat
[2:02:33.880 --> 2:02:37.000]  to train everyone that black uniforms and armored vehicles are normal and
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:41.080]  there's all this fear that there's an enemy in the public who's unseen and
[2:02:41.080 --> 2:02:45.000]  who can't be caught and so it doesn't matter of a thousand plus time people
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:48.200]  die in drownings every year the dive terrorism in the u.s
[2:02:48.200 --> 2:02:52.040]  they still you know are scared of this epic monster that's around the corner
[2:02:52.040 --> 2:02:55.080]  everywhere so the real terrorists the government
[2:02:55.080 --> 2:02:58.920]  can then play the part of the savior
[2:02:58.920 --> 2:03:02.040]  and then once they've got their militarized control grid this is all in
[2:03:02.040 --> 2:03:04.920]  the island world bank documents trilateral commission reports
[2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:08.280]  club of realm reports we published them all up on info wars dot com this is
[2:03:08.280 --> 2:03:12.760]  what's declassified they admit phony environmentalism totally phony
[2:03:12.760 --> 2:03:16.680]  carbon taxes away to regulate control our lives have carbon checkpoints expect
[2:03:16.680 --> 2:03:20.520]  our homes shut down family farms and ranches the big corporations are exempt
[2:03:20.520 --> 2:03:24.520]  or selectively enforced then people are diverted from real
[2:03:24.520 --> 2:03:28.680]  environmental problems like genetic engineering and toxic
[2:03:28.680 --> 2:03:32.040]  waste dumping and things like that and toxic fertilizer use
[2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:35.320]  they're they're diverted away from real environmental crises into
[2:03:35.320 --> 2:03:39.000]  loathing humans hating humans carrying out a eugenics idea
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:42.920]  of humans being bad in the state implementing a war against them
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:46.680]  elite humans against slave humans that stated by richard and haas the cfr club
[2:03:46.680 --> 2:03:51.720]  of realm all of them we've published and paul's written articles on it
[2:03:51.720 --> 2:03:54.680]  so you've got that multi-pronged false attack the phony environmental attack
[2:03:54.680 --> 2:03:57.560]  to regulate control your life i mean why would a free america put up with a
[2:03:57.560 --> 2:04:00.120]  bureaucrat in their house or an inspector telling them what they can or
[2:04:00.120 --> 2:04:03.320]  can't build or what your children can eat or how
[2:04:03.320 --> 2:04:07.320]  much meat you can have oh it's for the earth and we're
[2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:10.600]  taking all your rights and have putting up face scanning and body scanning
[2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:14.840]  cameras on street corners not just in airports because there's terrorist
[2:04:14.840 --> 2:04:18.040]  everywhere and when you point out why is the border
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:20.840]  wide open they say never mind that we're just building the border to keep you in
[2:04:20.840 --> 2:04:25.880]  but not people out they want more roaches in
[2:04:25.880 --> 2:04:29.640]  we're roaches the slaves that get in are roaches we're all seen as roaches
[2:04:29.640 --> 2:04:33.720]  by the new world war black white old young men roaches don't get out roaches
[2:04:33.720 --> 2:04:38.520]  are only allowed in so and they change the laws where you
[2:04:38.520 --> 2:04:41.560]  can't get your money offshore after the elite all moved offshore did that in
[2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:44.200]  the last year they changed the laws where you can't declare bankruptcy but
[2:04:44.200 --> 2:04:47.560]  they can they change the laws where there's no fourth amendment and they
[2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:49.720]  can watch everything you're doing and make stuff up
[2:04:49.720 --> 2:04:53.000]  they change they change the laws to make you incriminate yourself

[2:08:55.320 --> 2:08:57.880]  simply put we've always had elites throughout history they normally
[2:08:57.880 --> 2:09:01.480]  militarily dominate their own population and surrounding populations and
[2:09:01.480 --> 2:09:05.640]  setup empires that's the nature of power
[2:09:07.320 --> 2:09:11.160]  the current group that we're facing the current group
[2:09:11.160 --> 2:09:14.200]  that we're dealing with
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:17.720]  are more sophisticated things are more sophisticated than they were hundreds of
[2:09:17.720 --> 2:09:20.680]  years ago and they have indoctrinated the public to
[2:09:20.680 --> 2:09:27.320]  help the two hate their fellow humans i think that humans are bad
[2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:31.400]  to accept regulation and control and micromanagement and the reduction of
[2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:35.560]  the amount of resources we can have access to
[2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:40.120]  serfdom feudalism an economic system of control it is
[2:09:40.120 --> 2:09:46.120]  it is artificially depriving the public down to subsistence level
[2:09:46.120 --> 2:09:50.440]  so that they are more easily controlled
[2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:56.840]  and that is what we are seeing happen but they have to sell the public
[2:09:56.840 --> 2:10:00.680]  that this is happening all by itself and not happening
[2:10:00.680 --> 2:10:05.800]  by action or that it is happening by accident
[2:10:07.560 --> 2:10:12.600]  and that's what they're doing now but from all their own documents from all
[2:10:12.600 --> 2:10:15.800]  their own statements they've always said for decades
[2:10:15.800 --> 2:10:20.200]  they need a global meltdown they need a global
[2:10:20.200 --> 2:10:24.200]  financial meltdown so that they can then offer the next solution
[2:10:24.200 --> 2:10:27.560]  and that is regional currencies that are pegged and tied to
[2:10:27.560 --> 2:10:33.480]  a world currency which is openly controlled by the private
[2:10:33.480 --> 2:10:36.440]  families that own the private central banks of the planet and you will buy
[2:10:36.440 --> 2:10:39.640]  your carbon taxes from them
[2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:45.080]  they also again will use terrorism as a pretext to monitor you
[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:50.440]  track you control you tax you and that's being done
[2:10:50.440 --> 2:10:55.240]  now they knew that the public when all of this started unfolding when they
[2:10:55.240 --> 2:10:59.400]  created the derivatives when they trained the public to get into debt
[2:10:59.400 --> 2:11:03.640]  when the banks took the fiat liquidity they created
[2:11:03.640 --> 2:11:07.160]  and bought up real assets they knew they had to blow out the Ponzi scheme
[2:11:07.160 --> 2:11:10.680]  to really destroy the world economy so they could consolidate even more power
[2:11:10.680 --> 2:11:14.040]  because any independent wealth is a threat to their hegemon
[2:11:14.040 --> 2:11:17.160]  to their centralization of power their monopoly
[2:11:17.160 --> 2:11:21.000]  of power as the united nations called it in their unidear
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:28.280]  report put out july 7th 2001 where they state we must be
[2:11:28.280 --> 2:11:32.920]  subjected to tyranny we must be brought to the level of disarmed slaves
[2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:37.080]  with a total monopoly of power over a world government state
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:41.080]  a world government state with a total monopoly of power that's a quote
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:45.960]  over the people and think the poor slaves were taught by the tv that
[2:11:45.960 --> 2:11:49.400]  there was no world government while they wrote open reports saying
[2:11:49.400 --> 2:11:53.240]  calling us slaves and saying they were going to reduce us down to slaves
[2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:56.600]  an official u n report saying they plan to kill us once the world government's
[2:11:56.600 --> 2:12:00.040]  in place god folks hitler was spawned by these
[2:12:00.040 --> 2:12:06.440]  people they're not playing games they really are doing this
[2:12:06.440 --> 2:12:08.760]  now
[2:12:09.560 --> 2:12:14.760]  they staged the crisis they stop issuing more liquidity
[2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:19.480]  to the public they kill the credit and the fiat
[2:12:19.480 --> 2:12:24.600]  liquidity to the public and to smaller corporations and banks
[2:12:24.600 --> 2:12:29.320]  the select inner group of central bank owning families then
[2:12:29.320 --> 2:12:34.280]  after a year of the economy imploding the public screams do something
[2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:38.360]  and they say okay we'll give ourselves in europe england the united states
[2:12:38.360 --> 2:12:42.040]  simultaneously in the last three weeks
[2:12:42.040 --> 2:12:45.880]  governmental power to the private central banks
[2:12:45.880 --> 2:12:48.920]  and we will have the treasuries of those governments give
[2:12:48.920 --> 2:12:53.240]  trillions of dollars denominated in pounds
[2:12:53.240 --> 2:13:00.680]  dollars euros yinz yinz to the private banks
[2:13:00.680 --> 2:13:04.520]  who then go out and attack the rest of what's left of the real economy
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:08.840]  buying up corporations while they're depressed buying up other banks using
[2:13:08.840 --> 2:13:12.920]  regulators to force the banks credit unions
[2:13:12.920 --> 2:13:17.320]  pension fund groups over to them brokerage houses
[2:13:17.320 --> 2:13:20.680]  meanwhile for decades they've been going into your cities and getting your
[2:13:20.680 --> 2:13:26.200]  cities counties water districts school teacher pensions police and fire
[2:13:26.200 --> 2:13:30.520]  pensions and those of all all been invested in
[2:13:30.520 --> 2:13:34.200]  derivative connected assets
[2:13:34.200 --> 2:13:40.120]  always taking your money putting into the most risky area telling you it wasn't
[2:13:40.120 --> 2:13:46.360]  risky but tying it to the risk then buying real assets with the value
[2:13:46.360 --> 2:13:52.360]  and then just letting the hot air empty paper assets sit in your account see
[2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:55.240]  they have the public accounts they move your money and then they move that out
[2:13:55.240 --> 2:13:59.720]  while it still has value leaving junk derivatives they add back
[2:13:59.720 --> 2:14:04.440]  in to the pot you understand how that Ponzi scheme works understand how that
[2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:07.880]  scam works i know you don't want to admit the
[2:14:07.880 --> 2:14:10.520]  government's criminal and owned by private foreign banks who are totally
[2:14:10.520 --> 2:14:14.200]  ruthless involved in a criminal corporate takeover of what's left of free
[2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:20.440]  society but they are now people didn't go for the
[2:14:20.440 --> 2:14:23.320]  bailout they didn't go for the banker takeover they found out
[2:14:23.320 --> 2:14:27.080]  because of the internet posting and people spreading the fact that it gave
[2:14:27.080 --> 2:14:30.440]  total immunity to Paulson the private banks and let them pay five trillion
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:33.880]  at least into their own bank accounts and then it wasn't for main street of the
[2:14:33.880 --> 2:14:37.320]  main economy and the people didn't get any relief but we had to pay for it
[2:14:37.320 --> 2:14:39.800]  down the road and inflation and physically even paying back the
[2:14:39.800 --> 2:14:43.560]  inflated dollars when they want to be an economy to work to be able to pay them
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:46.360]  back they don't care they'll send armored SWAT teams take
[2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:49.800]  your property once it goes into default and they'll do it because they need
[2:14:49.800 --> 2:14:53.480]  food they'll go out and commit the crimes because the system tells them it's
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:58.760]  okay
[2:14:58.760 --> 2:15:02.200]  and so now this is the point we've gotten to with the economy and shambles
[2:15:02.200 --> 2:15:05.320]  falling apart by design the globalist to move all our
[2:15:05.320 --> 2:15:07.640]  industry offshore harassing farmers and ranchers
[2:15:07.640 --> 2:15:10.760]  shutting down who they have i haven't been able to shut down
[2:15:10.760 --> 2:15:15.240]  trying to shut down the systems piling more regulations on top of everybody
[2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:20.280]  green police everywhere spreading brainwashing by both parties on the
[2:15:20.280 --> 2:15:25.720]  bailout and on the green carbon taxes has nothing to do with the environment
[2:15:25.720 --> 2:15:29.800]  banks openly announcing you'll pay your taxes directly to them to the world bank
[2:15:29.800 --> 2:15:34.360]  the new financial order and as the economy implodes more and more then
[2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:37.800]  they say they're going to bail out the states and they're going to bail out
[2:15:37.800 --> 2:15:43.960]  the select corporations that are part of the inner system
[2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:47.320]  and meanwhile there have just signed a trillion dollar defense budget so that
[2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:51.160]  the offshore defense contractors can now swell even bigger and sell weapons
[2:15:51.160 --> 2:15:53.160]  everybody
[2:15:53.160 --> 2:15:56.200]  and then now the red light cameras the face scanning cameras the emergency
[2:15:56.200 --> 2:16:00.200]  management centers uh... the insurance companies have to spy on you under
[2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:04.600]  federal law and do data mining on you and have it and have
[2:16:04.600 --> 2:16:07.800]  homeland security approved and trained private individuals reporting
[2:16:07.800 --> 2:16:10.200]  everything you do with insurance everything with banking
[2:16:10.200 --> 2:16:12.840]  that the government just goes right into all your accounts looks at them no
[2:16:12.840 --> 2:16:16.520]  warrant no nothing that's all admitted we're talking about are they spying on
[2:16:16.520 --> 2:16:21.880]  us of course they are it's all the real stuff's in plain view
[2:16:21.880 --> 2:16:25.080]  changing the tax laws where they're so complex nobody can even follow law
[2:16:25.080 --> 2:16:28.520]  so they can selectively enforce and imprison whoever they want whenever
[2:16:28.520 --> 2:16:33.320]  they want and then as the economy gets worse
[2:16:33.320 --> 2:16:37.480]  and worse they will disgorge trillions of devalued dollars into their defense
[2:16:37.480 --> 2:16:41.720]  contractors that again our quote defense department
[2:16:41.720 --> 2:16:44.920]  is nothing but a private cash machine for the private defense contractors
[2:16:44.920 --> 2:16:47.480]  you've all moved to dubai and offshore
[2:16:47.480 --> 2:16:51.400]  they have subsidiaries here and they literally own the maintenance the
[2:16:51.400 --> 2:16:55.800]  computers the prison companies the again the red light
[2:16:55.800 --> 2:17:00.360]  cameras that give you tickets that's what military groups do
[2:17:00.360 --> 2:17:04.440]  nine times out of ten in history a big imperial army an imperial system goes
[2:17:04.440 --> 2:17:09.400]  ahead and eats its own country nine times out of ten
[2:17:09.400 --> 2:17:12.280]  ninety nine percent of the time you have a tyranny
[2:17:12.280 --> 2:17:15.880]  and the majority of that about ninety percent of the time it is a military
[2:17:15.880 --> 2:17:20.200]  dictatorship and that's it
[2:17:20.200 --> 2:17:24.040]  they'd rather rule over slums and starving poor people
[2:17:24.040 --> 2:17:27.080]  than have any competition or have anybody charged up to challenge them
[2:17:27.080 --> 2:17:30.360]  because that's dominance that is military dominance
[2:17:30.360 --> 2:17:35.960]  that is peace to them is you poor pathetic and dirt floor place
[2:17:35.960 --> 2:17:38.920]  where the un vans drive by and you know shoot your kids up with shots that
[2:17:38.920 --> 2:17:41.720]  sterilize them
[2:17:41.720 --> 2:17:44.440]  don't worry in this new slave system you'll still have big
[2:17:44.440 --> 2:17:47.880]  flat screen tv's and cable is going to end up being free they're already
[2:17:47.880 --> 2:17:51.080]  basically announcing that it'll be a government internet
[2:17:51.080 --> 2:17:53.800]  wireless
[2:17:54.360 --> 2:17:57.160]  and everybody just sits in there eating their poison food dying when they're
[2:17:57.160 --> 2:18:01.240]  35 40 so ignorant stupid so dumbed down not even
[2:18:01.240 --> 2:18:05.400]  knowing what's going on with them and the football still be on the baseball

[2:24:37.720 --> 2:24:45.080]  story fell out a days long ago
[2:24:45.080 --> 2:24:49.560]  and the only place she'd ever been
[2:24:51.240 --> 2:24:57.320]  singing softly this world is not my home
[2:24:57.320 --> 2:25:01.880]  and memories take me back again
[2:25:01.880 --> 2:25:08.120]  when i was young and grandma wasn't home
[2:25:08.120 --> 2:25:14.440]  when she guided me as i watched life unfold
[2:25:14.440 --> 2:25:20.120]  anything we didn't have we didn't really need to hold
[2:25:20.120 --> 2:25:24.040]  when i was young and grandma wasn't home
[2:25:24.040 --> 2:25:34.840]  that was during the depression in north central texas
[2:25:34.840 --> 2:25:38.680]  and back then seven million people starved to death
[2:25:38.680 --> 2:25:45.960]  with you know she threw a party 90 of people living on the land
[2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:50.200]  together around and the criminals that run our government sent out pickerton
[2:25:50.200 --> 2:25:55.160]  security rockefeller men and others and ran thousands of massacres all over
[2:25:55.160 --> 2:25:58.920]  the country they would come into areas where
[2:25:58.920 --> 2:26:03.000]  they would just call in the whole loan it didn't matter people were paying
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:06.440]  and they would just gun the whole family down usually throw the bodies into the
[2:26:06.440 --> 2:26:10.280]  house of the barn burn them up local sheriff was on the
[2:26:10.280 --> 2:26:13.480]  payroll or if you didn't want to be they'd just
[2:26:13.480 --> 2:26:18.760]  kill him grand juries couldn't do anything
[2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:22.120]  because it was federal now we were a lot
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:27.240]  better people 70 80 years ago and all that was happening
[2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:31.720]  and a lot of evil happened so it's time for everybody to stop living in
[2:26:31.720 --> 2:26:34.840]  denial about what the elite and the military and the police are going to
[2:26:34.840 --> 2:26:39.880]  do here they've given them a taste of blood
[2:26:39.880 --> 2:26:44.200]  the american people and they like it
[2:26:45.320 --> 2:26:47.560]  what they don't tell them is they're going to be eating their own guts
[2:26:47.560 --> 2:26:51.720]  basically eating their own country but they'll find out later
[2:26:51.720 --> 2:26:54.040]  now
[2:26:54.840 --> 2:26:58.600]  looking ahead into what the neural order setting up it's a highly controlled
[2:26:58.600 --> 2:27:03.640]  regulated control freak paradise with every control freak every sicko
[2:27:03.640 --> 2:27:08.280]  everybody who never could get a real job but who is a thug a felon a piece of
[2:27:08.280 --> 2:27:12.520]  trash oh yeah they're hiring felons for all this military police
[2:27:12.520 --> 2:27:17.640]  ruling over you and a lot of these smiley face do-gooders that thought they
[2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:20.440]  were part of the system and who thought it was a good system and
[2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:23.320]  didn't think things were corrupt they're going to scream and yell and
[2:27:23.320 --> 2:27:29.080]  squeal as their farms their ranches their homes their businesses are taken
[2:27:29.080 --> 2:27:32.520]  as the irs comes in and tells them you didn't pay you cheated this
[2:27:32.520 --> 2:27:36.440]  when people go to prison for a mistake on their taxes
[2:27:36.440 --> 2:27:39.960]  they're not going to be making deals with you they're there to take everything
[2:27:39.960 --> 2:27:43.400]  you got same thing happened in Rome in Germany
[2:27:43.400 --> 2:27:46.680]  it happens in every case and they're saying they're changing the rules they're
[2:27:46.680 --> 2:27:51.560]  changing the laws they're setting it up you think the police are predatory now
[2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:55.400]  this is only the beginning
[2:27:56.200 --> 2:27:59.080]  and by the way they want you to fight back they want you to blow up they
[2:27:59.080 --> 2:28:03.160]  want you to have shootouts that's all going to be called terrorism
[2:28:03.160 --> 2:28:05.720]  you don't want your children being kidnapped and taken to the state for no
[2:28:05.720 --> 2:28:08.920]  reason because a neighbor said they saw one of them climbing a tree
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:12.520]  oh yeah people get the kids taking every day for that because the domesticated
[2:28:12.520 --> 2:28:16.920]  neighbors think it's evil and programmed you think it's uh
[2:28:16.920 --> 2:28:21.880]  you don't like that well go ahead of the the system wants people to fight with
[2:28:21.880 --> 2:28:24.440]  the police and see what the police know they want to throw you into that
[2:28:24.440 --> 2:28:28.440]  situation because they could say see that's terrorism
[2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:32.360]  and militarize things further and they want there to be riots in the next few
[2:28:32.360 --> 2:28:36.200]  years is the food stamps will come the welfare will come it just won't buy
[2:28:36.200 --> 2:28:39.720]  enough
[2:28:39.800 --> 2:28:42.840]  and then the middle class will get even more scared and say okay we're for
[2:28:42.840 --> 2:28:45.160]  whatever the government says because there's been all these riots and
[2:28:45.160 --> 2:28:47.640]  problems

[2:36:08.840 --> 2:36:11.960]  the general public but to work they're going to have to
[2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:14.840]  have an implantable microchip under the skin that's in all the pentagon
[2:36:14.840 --> 2:36:17.960]  documents that we link up on info wars dot com that's on
[2:36:17.960 --> 2:36:22.360]  army dot mill in a bunch of latin america and asian
[2:36:22.360 --> 2:36:24.760]  countries they're making the police chiefs get chips
[2:36:24.760 --> 2:36:27.560]  they're making uh... you know the people that work for the justice department
[2:36:27.560 --> 2:36:30.840]  in mexico get chips police chiefs here getting chips
[2:36:30.840 --> 2:36:34.760]  to get in the fancy bars you've got to have chips
[2:36:34.760 --> 2:36:38.840]  and the army says that it's part of the technological control grid the
[2:36:38.840 --> 2:36:43.320]  technological enslavement uh... grid
[2:36:43.320 --> 2:36:46.600]  that they're setting up an expanding
[2:36:46.600 --> 2:36:52.280]  and then incrementally they phase it in remember we were cooks 10 12 years ago
[2:36:52.280 --> 2:36:55.320]  we would read government documents about how they planned it
[2:36:55.320 --> 2:36:58.200]  and people are like wait a minute that was just on the news years after you
[2:36:58.200 --> 2:37:02.840]  said it exactly like you said the army says they're going to use fads
[2:37:02.840 --> 2:37:06.360]  hollywood people getting an elite clubs to take the chips and all summer
[2:37:06.360 --> 2:37:10.520]  patients and military personnel as we told you years ago
[2:37:10.520 --> 2:37:14.280]  many of them have been forced now to take chips
[2:37:14.280 --> 2:37:18.680]  remember my cousin in the army like nine or nineteen years now he showed up a
[2:37:18.680 --> 2:37:22.360]  few years ago at my house he said you're right i was just at a thing
[2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:25.560]  at a military base in texas and all it was over 200 officers there and they
[2:37:25.560 --> 2:37:29.640]  were told we were all getting chips next year
[2:37:29.640 --> 2:37:34.040]  but we weren't supposed to tell anybody about it and then that well of course
[2:37:34.040 --> 2:37:37.880]  you thought he i thought you were crazy
[2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:42.760]  but now it's in the news so you see this grid is coming into place
[2:37:42.760 --> 2:37:46.360]  under this grid they're also they've been lying for decades saying it's a lot of
[2:37:46.360 --> 2:37:49.240]  tech shots but the public found out that
[2:37:49.240 --> 2:37:52.200]  wait a minute it's not mandatory to take any vaccines
[2:37:52.200 --> 2:37:55.800]  it's a lie it's a giant hoax so now they're saying okay
[2:37:55.800 --> 2:37:59.560]  we need laws to make it mandatory you can google that
[2:37:59.560 --> 2:38:02.360]  a lot of people are too lazy to find out there's no law
[2:38:02.360 --> 2:38:06.280]  and they can't believe the news lies and says there is well just google
[2:38:06.280 --> 2:38:09.880]  you know state calls for law for compulsory and vaccination or not
[2:38:09.880 --> 2:38:12.680]  inoculation and then you'll see in the articles all over the country
[2:38:12.680 --> 2:38:17.400]  because it goes out in waves under orders too many children are getting
[2:38:17.400 --> 2:38:21.640]  sick you know standard propaganda uh... there needs to be a law
[2:38:21.640 --> 2:38:27.640]  mandating forcing this so you'll have that
[2:38:27.640 --> 2:38:30.680]  the third world is going to further implode in front of everybody
[2:38:30.680 --> 2:38:33.720]  putting more third world populations on the first world
[2:38:33.720 --> 2:38:37.480]  they're going to be allowed to immigrate into the nations that will
[2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:42.200]  further bankrupt local government but welfare will always be lavished on them
[2:38:42.200 --> 2:38:45.080]  not on the citizens but then again that's about
[2:38:45.080 --> 2:38:48.920]  driving the first world nation down into
[2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:53.320]  third world position bankrupting things
[2:38:54.680 --> 2:38:58.840]  and this is key any and i've talked about bits and pieces but let me explain
[2:38:58.840 --> 2:39:01.400]  this right now
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:06.120]  in 2000 the sunshine project reported
[2:39:06.120 --> 2:39:08.760]  they were able to get declassified documents very respect to grip we had
[2:39:08.760 --> 2:39:11.880]  them on that there's a pentagon program going
[2:39:11.880 --> 2:39:16.440]  back to the eighties now in full force declassified eight years ago
[2:39:16.440 --> 2:39:22.200]  where opiate knockout gases sprayed by helicopter are deployed
[2:39:22.200 --> 2:39:25.560]  strategically over every major population center
[2:39:25.560 --> 2:39:30.840]  that if the public was to quote riot now they're going to legitimize this by
[2:39:30.840 --> 2:39:33.800]  staging riots or by creating atmospheres that
[2:39:33.800 --> 2:39:41.960]  precipitate riots and then show you a crowd being opiate spray
[2:39:41.960 --> 2:39:46.840]  knockout gas see their masters it
[2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:49.960]  incrementally doing but the point is the plan is
[2:39:49.960 --> 2:39:55.560]  knock everybody out and then of course in the british 10 year
[2:39:55.560 --> 2:39:58.760]  prospectus 10 year plan what they said they believe will happen
[2:39:58.760 --> 2:40:02.280]  they talk about flash mob stopping people rioting as they have all their food
[2:40:02.280 --> 2:40:06.040]  taken as the as the pension funds are are are taken
[2:40:06.040 --> 2:40:09.560]  and and they admit it all in there as the government takes the pension funds
[2:40:09.560 --> 2:40:12.520]  the people are going to riot they call it flash mobs they talk about how they
[2:40:12.520 --> 2:40:16.680]  got a control and shut down the web to stop these flash mobs from happening
[2:40:16.680 --> 2:40:19.960]  but if flash mobs did occur governments will use
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:27.560]  neutron weapons or a radiation bomb that creates a burst of
[2:40:27.560 --> 2:40:32.280]  radiation and it's gone in seconds and it kills every living thing every bird
[2:40:32.280 --> 2:40:36.440]  every bee every flower every human every deer every cat every dog
[2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:39.320]  we've been trained to hate our own species so people don't care about
[2:40:39.320 --> 2:40:42.920]  fellow humans being killed now but we still because they haven't done the
[2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:46.360]  neural association yet with dogs being killed and millions of
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:49.720]  simulated murders on television people still care about dogs and cats being
[2:40:49.720 --> 2:40:52.440]  killed so i want to state the dogs and cats are to be killed
[2:40:52.440 --> 2:40:55.800]  that'll get by some programming and and and get through if you have any neurons
[2:40:55.800 --> 2:41:00.280]  that haven't been acclimated yet so we can actually still get through to you
[2:41:00.280 --> 2:41:03.480]  that's why you're numb so all those simulated murders were
[2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:10.360]  scientifically uh shown to uh sear the senses to where you uh
[2:41:10.360 --> 2:41:13.720]  now giggle and laugh as people are tortured when you watch saw for or
[2:41:13.720 --> 2:41:18.120]  whatever so um
[2:41:19.400 --> 2:41:23.800]  that is all being done you're gonna see more gladiatorial events
[2:41:23.800 --> 2:41:27.560]  you're gonna see ultimate fighting with weapons now you're gonna see all of
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:29.800]  that so that when you see your neighbor being beaten to death in the street you
[2:41:29.800 --> 2:41:32.840]  kind of like it it's it's entertainment your your mind is
[2:41:32.840 --> 2:41:35.640]  being acclimated and prepared so when you're being beaten to death or
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:38.680]  tasered to death in the street your neighbor will enjoy it
[2:41:38.680 --> 2:41:42.600]  they won't associate you with themselves as a normal healthy human
[2:41:42.600 --> 2:41:45.880]  and the police won't either
[2:41:46.120 --> 2:41:51.480]  okay so that's been scientifically done and they will just introduce more
[2:41:51.480 --> 2:41:55.160]  poisons more toxins more biological agents the water supply
[2:41:55.160 --> 2:41:58.280]  more toxins more poisons more biological and radiological
[2:41:58.280 --> 2:42:03.560]  agents of the food supply uh we will go from one and three from one and 33
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:06.360]  having cancer to now one and two with men one and three with women
[2:42:06.360 --> 2:42:10.600]  it'll be basically where everybody has cancer only a leech will be allowed to
[2:42:10.600 --> 2:42:12.840]  get real treatment most of us won't be given real
[2:42:12.840 --> 2:42:16.120]  treatment we'll die that way or you know they're now having
[2:42:16.120 --> 2:42:19.560]  Alzheimer's set in at 25 because of the heavy metals and poisons and
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:22.040]  aspartame and they're saying that's normal
[2:42:22.040 --> 2:42:25.480]  they'll have lots of jogging and events and people wearing ribbons wondering
[2:42:25.480 --> 2:42:29.480]  why everybody's dying of brain damage and you'll get into it and
[2:42:29.480 --> 2:42:32.760]  and and make it up you know about oh my god i'm dying of
[2:42:32.760 --> 2:42:38.440]  tricellium 12 you know and and and all compartmentalizing the
[2:42:38.440 --> 2:42:41.000]  treatments
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:48.200]  and so they're going to put unlimited toxic plastic in the food that kills
[2:42:48.200 --> 2:42:51.960]  people melamine unlimited poisons heavy metals they're going to tell you on the
[2:42:51.960 --> 2:42:54.280]  news it's good for you i'm not kidding they're already
[2:42:54.280 --> 2:42:57.080]  doing it more clips this week of them saying it's good
[2:42:57.080 --> 2:43:01.480]  fda google fda says melamine not bad for you just deadly destroys your kidneys
[2:43:01.480 --> 2:43:03.720]  kills you thousands dying in china right now
[2:43:03.720 --> 2:43:06.760]  thousands dying here they just covered up they just say no it's no it's always
[2:43:06.760 --> 2:43:11.400]  been deadly but now we say it's good public says yes sir
[2:43:11.400 --> 2:43:14.600]  cop gives their kids cops right now are listening to got dying kids they don't
[2:43:14.600 --> 2:43:17.400]  care they're not believing me right now they're going to serve the system
[2:43:17.400 --> 2:43:20.680]  until they lower that little child down in that casket with a grave and they're
[2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:25.960]  going to salute the furor highl hitla and i'm not
[2:43:25.960 --> 2:43:29.960]  trying to be mean it's just i know i know you're out there
[2:43:29.960 --> 2:43:33.320]  you're going to hate me for telling me you're going to hate me from
[2:43:33.320 --> 2:43:37.240]  for telling you the system killed your child
[2:43:37.240 --> 2:43:40.440]  you're going to hate me for telling you the cold hard truth that's okay
[2:43:40.440 --> 2:43:47.080]  have it your way have it your way buster you want it all you're
[2:43:47.080 --> 2:43:50.360]  going to get all of it
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:54.200]  when the new world order sweller swears to kill 80 plus percent of us
[2:43:54.200 --> 2:43:57.720]  they keep their promises when the new world order promises to destroy this
[2:43:57.720 --> 2:44:01.000]  country they keep their promises when the new world order killed 200 million
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:04.760]  people last century to their proxies they kept their promise
[2:44:04.760 --> 2:44:08.440]  and they promise to kill at least four billion people
[2:44:08.440 --> 2:44:12.440]  in the near future and they're killing a lot of men africa with the hiv in the
[2:44:12.440 --> 2:44:15.720]  shots and the other soft kill weapons they're being caught doing it they
[2:44:15.720 --> 2:44:18.040]  don't care
[2:44:18.840 --> 2:44:21.560]  doesn't matter how many noble prize winners come out and say it's a government
[2:44:21.560 --> 2:44:25.160]  operation no matter how many documents declassified
[2:44:25.160 --> 2:44:28.680]  they're going to murder people all they want all day and black cops in america
[2:44:28.680 --> 2:44:32.920]  they don't care if blacks are being murdered in africa here in the us
[2:44:32.920 --> 2:44:36.600]  because they've been conditioned to only get mad
[2:44:36.600 --> 2:44:41.640]  at some clown in a white hood or somebody saying code racism
[2:44:41.640 --> 2:44:44.760]  that's what they've been told to get mad at they don't get mad at people putting
[2:44:44.760 --> 2:44:47.640]  fluoride in their water
[2:44:51.960 --> 2:44:54.760]  you see they've been given their false template their false reality and
[2:44:54.760 --> 2:44:58.040]  they're not going to give up on it
[2:44:59.160 --> 2:45:04.200]  so how do you get around a criminal group calling itself the government
[2:45:04.200 --> 2:45:07.400]  private bankers raping and strip mining who have a
[2:45:07.400 --> 2:45:12.440]  detestment who detestment who detest the general public
[2:45:12.440 --> 2:45:16.040]  who have discussed for the general public
[2:45:16.040 --> 2:45:19.560]  who think it's a holy sacrament to kill and poison the public
[2:45:19.560 --> 2:45:24.680]  who've dumbed the public down how do you get around them where have you tried
[2:45:24.680 --> 2:45:26.680]  to have a million people march on washington
[2:45:26.680 --> 2:45:30.280]  are you or let's say congress stood up and said
[2:45:30.280 --> 2:45:34.040]  we are going to go ahead and go with impeachment well we've had multiple
[2:45:34.040 --> 2:45:40.920]  congressmen tell us they were told if you try to impeach bush
[2:45:40.920 --> 2:45:44.840]  we will stage an event this is what the white house says or we will launch a war
[2:45:44.840 --> 2:45:49.480]  with iran or both and we will abolish the congress
[2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:54.520]  that's on record months ago then last week if you don't pass our bailout
[2:45:54.520 --> 2:45:57.000]  bill our banker takeover bill for immunity and unlimited
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:46:00.520]  funding and insider trading we will declare martial law
[2:46:00.520 --> 2:46:04.680]  if congress said we're going to have a
[2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:08.520]  congress would have to three or four leading members would have to give a
[2:46:08.520 --> 2:46:13.320]  press conference not say what was about disclose everything
[2:46:13.320 --> 2:46:16.120]  and so the white house may stage terror attacks
[2:46:16.120 --> 2:46:19.160]  we've been warned you know that that that if we tried to impeach there'd be
[2:46:19.160 --> 2:46:22.600]  stage terror attacks and that we would be abolished or even arrested
[2:46:22.600 --> 2:46:26.840]  so we're now saying if that happens it's the military industrial complex
[2:46:26.840 --> 2:46:29.720]  but you better believe they would blow their planes up within a day and then
[2:46:29.720 --> 2:46:33.880]  say oh there were malfunctions with all four of their aircraft
[2:46:33.880 --> 2:46:38.360]  they do that all the time right around elections especially
[2:46:38.360 --> 2:46:41.800]  but let's let's see that word got out and they went to a safe location and
[2:46:41.800 --> 2:46:44.600]  they said everybody's got to go public in government who knows this was true
[2:46:44.600 --> 2:46:47.640]  they need to have people all over going public if they had courage and then
[2:46:47.640 --> 2:46:52.040]  enough people would step forward this is one avenue to defeat them
[2:46:52.040 --> 2:46:54.680]  everywhere popping up saying we know about the martial law we know about the
[2:46:54.680 --> 2:46:58.280]  plan all those congressmen last week that were told you can't tell the public
[2:46:58.280 --> 2:47:03.560]  or martial law be declared you can't say no to us or martial law be declared
[2:47:03.560 --> 2:47:11.720]  remember that remember think about that just out in the open
[2:47:11.720 --> 2:47:17.480]  taking like it's no big deal you see if congress what does the sunshine project
[2:47:17.480 --> 2:47:22.600]  document tell us the project got what does the official declassified
[2:47:22.600 --> 2:47:27.320]  100-something page british prospectus on the next 10 years say
[2:47:28.200 --> 2:47:32.040]  i mean if congress was able to organize and try to go to washington do something
[2:47:32.040 --> 2:47:35.880]  he would suddenly hear on the news something's happened something's happened
[2:47:35.880 --> 2:47:38.840]  you know we're here in maryland uh everyone seems to be dead in the
[2:47:38.840 --> 2:47:43.000]  district of columbia in a 40 square mile area everyone is dead we're here the
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:46.600]  bodies are everywhere and you'd hear al qaeda al qaeda and they would grab some
[2:47:46.600 --> 2:47:50.040]  kind of beard and say he did it the russians gave him a neutron bomb he
[2:47:50.040 --> 2:47:54.120]  did it they killed our congress people go wait a minute congress was just saying
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:56.840]  that they were going to impeach you in the youth stage the terror attacks
[2:47:56.840 --> 2:48:02.200]  well then they'd make examples anybody that then stood up and said that
[2:48:02.200 --> 2:48:05.480]  commandos will just rush in even on tv and just gun your ass down
[2:48:07.320 --> 2:48:11.400]  brainwash special forces foreign troops private contractor criminal armies
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:15.720]  they've got criminal cadres made up of psychopath and sadist
[2:48:16.840 --> 2:48:20.920]  for the dirtiest of jobs these people are hardcore
[2:48:20.920 --> 2:48:28.040]  for so congress has been told sit down and shut up the armies on standby the
[2:48:28.040 --> 2:48:30.840]  third brigade for washington dc that's who they're for
[2:48:33.160 --> 2:48:37.480]  the public's been trained to sit down and shut up but people in power you sit
[2:48:37.480 --> 2:48:41.880]  down and shut up or marshal law
[2:48:44.360 --> 2:48:48.120]  okay so how do you get around the neutron weapon
[2:48:48.120 --> 2:48:54.040]  how do you get around the nerve gas how do you get around the opiate gas the
[2:48:54.040 --> 2:48:54.680]  helicopters
[2:48:58.040 --> 2:49:04.200]  you just have an absolute awakening person to person and you stop complying
[2:49:05.240 --> 2:49:10.840]  you sabotage the system any way you can you spread distrust and hatred for
[2:49:10.840 --> 2:49:15.960]  everyone in government you just stop supporting them and you have a mass
[2:49:15.960 --> 2:49:18.920]  underground awakening it's already happening that everything they say is
[2:49:18.920 --> 2:49:22.040]  lies that they carried out the terror attacks that's why that's so important
[2:49:22.040 --> 2:49:26.840]  to first expose that that they engineered the economic 9-11 that they did everything
[2:49:26.840 --> 2:49:31.400]  we're seeing and you lay out the evidence person by person and i gotta tell you we
[2:49:31.400 --> 2:49:34.440]  already have most of the police they're exponentially waking up we already have
[2:49:34.440 --> 2:49:38.440]  the majority of the military evidence by 70 plus percent of the contributions from
[2:49:38.440 --> 2:49:42.840]  the military being a ron paul total of all the i mean that's it right there that's why
[2:49:42.840 --> 2:49:46.200]  they're replacing them with felons and criminals and foreigners and mercenaries
[2:49:48.440 --> 2:49:52.440]  and instead of hating the police realize they've been mind manipulated and conditioned and
[2:49:52.440 --> 2:49:56.040]  put in bad situations and slowly turned against us and the public is falling
[2:49:56.040 --> 2:50:01.720]  apart and is dangerous out there they the police have been psychologically warped
[2:50:01.720 --> 2:50:04.920]  we need to reach out to them and educate them however we can
[2:50:06.920 --> 2:50:10.520]  and we need to add a city by city county by county because they can't hit every
[2:50:10.520 --> 2:50:15.240]  city with neutron weapons they can't carry out biological attacks on every city now
[2:50:15.240 --> 2:50:18.360]  they could stage a biological attack to pose as saviors again but there we always
[2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:22.760]  said to be biological economic or a combo if people start seeing no to their
[2:50:22.760 --> 2:50:26.920]  bailout takeovers then they'll release a bio weapon they'll stage a terror attack
[2:50:29.240 --> 2:50:33.080]  and as the riots break out as the crime increases as society
[2:50:33.080 --> 2:50:37.000]  gyrates out of control they're going to be posing as the saviors all along during that
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:43.240]  that always getting more power always getting more control so so so how do we block that
[2:50:43.240 --> 2:50:47.560]  how do we expose that how do we show people that agenda i mean it's simple that people
[2:50:47.560 --> 2:50:50.600]  don't learn about this agenda if they don't understand what's really happening if they
[2:50:50.600 --> 2:50:55.640]  don't get sophisticated now these social engineers are going to win now they're very
[2:50:55.640 --> 2:51:00.680]  sophisticated but they cannot stand exposure now you got the ball what you're going to do

[2:54:23.160 --> 2:54:28.600]  killed more drugs come in things get worse more prisons local economies fall apart all they
[2:54:28.600 --> 2:54:35.160]  have is the presence now they need the presence this is a parasite strip mining i i i guess what
[2:54:35.160 --> 2:54:41.320]  you could call uh... cannibalistic economy it's a consolidation neo feudal police state
[2:54:41.320 --> 2:54:50.280]  vortex now from that point things get worse and worse society falls more and more apart
[2:54:50.280 --> 2:54:56.120]  the only job you can get is either low level menial technician jobs or in the police state
[2:54:56.120 --> 2:55:05.560]  those will be the growth areas and so the solution this is educating the public the public is
[2:55:05.560 --> 2:55:10.120]  now ready to hear the truth the public is aware that the new order is real and we've been telling
[2:55:10.120 --> 2:55:14.680]  the truth and so many of you that got burned out trying to warn people many of those seats
[2:55:14.680 --> 2:55:18.920]  sprouted you just weren't around to see that person wake up and admit that you were right years ago
[2:55:18.920 --> 2:55:26.120]  when you warned them with a video or a book or of articles you sent them now people are really
[2:55:26.120 --> 2:55:31.080]  ready to wake up now they're finding out it's true now they're announcing they're getting ready for
[2:55:31.080 --> 2:55:37.320]  marshal on the news but selling it to you for your safety see before they launch something while
[2:55:37.320 --> 2:55:41.560]  they're building it they lie and keep it secret but now they're getting ready to launch it they've
[2:55:41.560 --> 2:55:55.560]  got to admit it and so we have to create a name you know the the friends of liberty uh...
[2:55:55.560 --> 2:56:04.040]  you know the society for the preservation of freedom um... you know anti-new world order
[2:56:04.040 --> 2:56:08.840]  whatever you want to call it your city or town your area don't come to people all
[2:56:08.840 --> 2:56:14.280]  with your tail between your legs cowering and hey this sounds kooky but hey you come in command
[2:56:14.280 --> 2:56:18.040]  and you say here's the documentation here's the information you set up like a leader
[2:56:18.040 --> 2:56:22.360]  in the town square you say ladies and gentlemen we'll be showing at the local library for you
[2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:27.560]  this saturday night nine eleven descent into tyranny you know the nine eleven the road to
[2:56:27.560 --> 2:56:34.360]  tyranny terror storm in game whatever film you think's good that'll wake people up they
[2:56:34.360 --> 2:56:39.720]  have that's one small part firing you know that nine eleven's an inside job and the bankers
[2:56:39.720 --> 2:56:44.040]  engineered it and that it's a new world order and with websites that point out the overall master
[2:56:44.040 --> 2:56:51.560]  plan and then link back to it we've just run out of time you know i i i said i was do this jfk
[2:56:51.560 --> 2:56:57.560]  slash continuity of government film and always do what i say i'm going to do in order it's also
[2:56:57.560 --> 2:57:04.760]  a daunting task i meant to make a film like in game but even more powerful that just in 90 minutes
[2:57:04.760 --> 2:57:12.680]  gives people the total master plan simply put and lays it all out and then even predicts everything
[2:57:12.680 --> 2:57:17.720]  that's going to happen after knowing people won't listen as much now but after unfolds they will
[2:57:17.720 --> 2:57:22.840]  go and i'll still be able to do that maybe it's just everything is coming down on us so fast
[2:57:23.720 --> 2:57:28.840]  we need to take my bumbling babbling rant at the last hour and maybe enough respect or somebody
[2:57:28.840 --> 2:57:33.240]  can put together a three four part series to boil down the basics of how they engineer this how they
[2:57:33.240 --> 2:57:39.320]  do it because again it's so detailed it's the equivalent of a master's degree and they do teach
[2:57:39.320 --> 2:57:45.080]  phd's on the global secret societies the new older structure but those phd's are only given to people
[2:57:45.080 --> 2:57:51.160]  like Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski and Carol Quigley and others
[2:57:53.400 --> 2:58:00.120]  Dr Francis Boyle was given that phd but he decided not to join them that's why he can come on and
[2:58:00.840 --> 2:58:05.320]  he writes our biological weapons treaties as a top government expert he'll tell you everything
[2:58:05.320 --> 2:58:10.920]  i'm saying because he was given that education and only one person a year is given by the enemy
[2:58:10.920 --> 2:58:17.720]  to understand their system very few in the enemy's own system even understand it and an average person
[2:58:17.720 --> 2:58:21.480]  who's even corrupted evil in the system can't imagine it's really this horrible
[2:58:23.720 --> 2:58:29.640]  but there's only a few hundred a year trained in all of this we have reverse engineered it
[2:58:31.080 --> 2:58:35.640]  we went and read all the phd papers in their plan and god it's horrible to see it but we
[2:58:35.640 --> 2:58:42.840]  have to admit it and face the facts we'll be live at prisonplanet.tv in one minute thank you for
[2:58:42.840 --> 2:58:57.160]  listening to GCN visit GCNlive.com today it is a big idea a new world order in the near future
[2:58:57.160 --> 2:59:04.840]  earth is dominated by a powerful world government it's known as the builder bird but their objective
[2:59:04.840 --> 2:59:11.480]  being world domination for thousands of years their dark order grew now as they hail the birth
[2:59:11.480 --> 2:59:17.160]  of the new world order their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand
[2:59:20.120 --> 2:59:25.960]  for the first time in history the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open you will
[2:59:25.960 --> 2:59:30.600]  learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda builder bird is making
[2:59:30.600 --> 2:59:57.560]  a best order world government most people have no idea they're not after money they have okay we're
[2:59:57.560 --> 3:00:04.120]  back live ladies and gentlemen there is a criminal group of eugenicists in control of the governments
[3:00:04.120 --> 3:00:09.080]  of the world only a few rogue nations are under their control most of those are run by murdering
[3:00:09.080 --> 3:00:14.360]  killers as well because most governments are run by evil that's historical fact so the evil globalists
[3:00:14.360 --> 3:00:19.000]  can point at those they're overtaking and always say look they're evil but if you look at the
[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:25.960]  bigger demon dominating them you understand that that's a semantical trick historical trick
[3:00:25.960 --> 3:00:32.360]  that they're playing i have been going over the last hour or so over the new world order
[3:00:32.360 --> 3:00:38.760]  master plan and what life will be like on drum and there's so many societal things happening
[3:00:38.760 --> 3:00:42.440]  there's so many new technologies being developed the globalists believe they need a worldwide
[3:00:42.440 --> 3:00:49.800]  tyranny in place to quote protect their holdings from super technologies that could easily
[3:00:50.520 --> 3:00:54.680]  damage their holdings or destroy the planet itself meanwhile they hand out nuclear weapons
[3:00:54.680 --> 3:01:00.360]  they hand out biological weapons they engage in cross species genetic modifications that could
[3:01:02.520 --> 3:01:05.960]  cause irrevocable damage to the earth's biosphere on a daily basis
[3:01:07.960 --> 3:01:12.600]  and so their rationale that you know their survival of the fittest since they're the elite
[3:01:12.600 --> 3:01:17.160]  dominating us and since they got into control through social Darwinism that means they have a
[3:01:17.160 --> 3:01:22.680]  right to rule over the people and that that cannot be questioned that they're allowed to do whatever
[3:01:22.680 --> 3:01:27.320]  they want to us because we were so stupid we allowed them to they believe that means their
[3:01:27.320 --> 3:01:34.520]  genetic material is more advanced and so that they have a right of kings to rule over us
[3:01:36.040 --> 3:01:42.520]  but they don't i mean they've i've used the analogy many times of cancer cancer takes over
[3:01:42.520 --> 3:01:50.360]  a body cancer kills its host malfunctioning cells colonies of cells spreading metastasizing
[3:01:50.360 --> 3:01:56.200]  sending spores out and that's what this elite is that's what elites do throughout history
[3:01:57.240 --> 3:02:03.000]  they dominate they amassing of power to themselves they set up empires they get abusive they go crazy
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:09.160]  and they do horrible things they seek self-destruction at a subconscious level many times they consciously
[3:02:09.160 --> 3:02:15.000]  admit they're very nihilistic and they race through the body politic like a cancer
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:20.280]  and there's no doubt we have government corruption there's no doubt we have way too much government
[3:02:20.280 --> 3:02:23.880]  there's no doubt now our government is openly run by private banks and they are looting the
[3:02:23.880 --> 3:02:28.600]  entire treasury and our future holdings in the dollar's future they are running up the
[3:02:28.600 --> 3:02:36.840]  collective credit card on the america people's back while telling us it's our fault on the news
[3:02:36.840 --> 3:02:45.320]  and it's only going to get more and more serious from this point on
[3:02:47.960 --> 3:02:53.800]  again they are going to organize a slow controlled economic collapse it's only the beginning
[3:02:56.200 --> 3:03:00.040]  they are going to set up a world banking system where you buy carbon credits from them
[3:03:00.040 --> 3:03:05.320]  where you pay a tub and tax for any wire transfers or any banking when you go to an ATM
[3:03:05.320 --> 3:03:12.600]  there'll be a fee on that you'll have to use an ID with cash when you get cash from a bank or
[3:03:12.600 --> 3:03:18.040]  ATM or when you make purchases that will go on your carbon credit allowance history that will go
[3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:24.920]  into your insurance everything you do the amazing thing is it's all stated that's what makes me so
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:35.000]  sad this whole thing is stated they tell you what they're doing it's just monstrous they're
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:41.240]  going to disarm the american people once they stage riots and once they push americans to the
[3:03:41.240 --> 3:03:51.640]  wall and the american citizens fight back the crime syndicate is going to win battles lose
[3:03:51.640 --> 3:03:57.720]  battles against militia people criminal elements contractors mainly are going to blow up police
[3:03:57.720 --> 3:04:03.400]  stations shoot police in their patrol cars this has been done in europe to set up police state
[3:04:03.400 --> 3:04:11.480]  in asia and let america by the u.s people running it that'll get the cops in military to rally around
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:16.440]  against the american people and get those that are against shooting citizens to gut up so the
[3:04:16.440 --> 3:04:21.080]  government's going to stage pinprick false flags against their own people they're also going to
[3:04:21.080 --> 3:04:26.200]  force police into positions to fight with citizens that'll be real come back and finish up with this
[3:04:26.200 --> 3:04:38.440]  key area the stock market is crazy the camchills are spraying us with their chemicals it's time

[3:05:34.840 --> 3:05:41.400]  this country the enemy struck america on september 11th but who is the enemy bin laden this is his
[3:05:41.400 --> 3:05:46.040]  m o we have to look to the middle east we have to look to his home event lodges fabled enemies is
[3:05:46.040 --> 3:05:51.080]  the first 9 11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside

[3:07:47.800 --> 3:07:51.160]  all right i want to state this for the record again
[3:07:51.160 --> 3:07:58.920]  you are not going to see the military roll into a city and declare martial law
[3:07:59.640 --> 3:08:04.840]  unless congress was to try to impeach bush or any other executive dictator the military
[3:08:04.840 --> 3:08:10.600]  industrial banking complex puts into power if you see governor say no if you see the state
[3:08:10.600 --> 3:08:17.800]  say no if you see the other branches of the government stand up and say no you will see tanks
[3:08:17.800 --> 3:08:23.400]  roll in and if it looks like to the establishment the public won't buy the president having congress
[3:08:23.400 --> 3:08:30.040]  arrested they'll just neutron bomb them and claim lc i ate it and i'll cut it in it the way they're
[3:08:30.040 --> 3:08:34.920]  going to do some martial law to the public is by food riots welfare riots because the checks will
[3:08:34.920 --> 3:08:40.920]  still go out probably it's just they won't once the 20 30 percent inflation compounded a year
[3:08:40.920 --> 3:08:48.680]  makes it impossible to live we're about two years out from that could be even quicker you
[3:08:48.680 --> 3:08:55.160]  will see burning cities and rioting just like in los angeles in the early 90s when the police stood
[3:08:55.160 --> 3:09:02.360]  down and let the bad guys do that and we was korean shopkeepers that kept whole areas from
[3:09:02.360 --> 3:09:07.480]  being burned down because they stood up on top of shotgun shooting at people and it will be
[3:09:07.480 --> 3:09:13.480]  citizens you know the the globalist though just like a new orleans they're going to send in swat
[3:09:13.480 --> 3:09:20.440]  teams fbi swat teams leading national guard regular army the first people they're going to hit will be
[3:09:20.440 --> 3:09:26.040]  korean shopkeepers you know shopkeepers homeowners out with shotguns you're not allowed to defend
[3:09:26.040 --> 3:09:32.200]  yourself in areas that aren't burned down in areas where they where the looting isn't allowed to go
[3:09:32.200 --> 3:09:39.240]  by the citizens you will see feds move in to stop that sweep out the and of course the law
[3:09:39.240 --> 3:09:43.320]  abiding citizens will stand down for the feds they'll be putting plastic handcuffs put on the
[3:09:43.320 --> 3:09:48.520]  backs of flatback trailers they'll be shipped out and then the feds will step back for the burning
[3:09:48.520 --> 3:09:52.280]  to continue of course that won't be on the news because they'll be controlling news coverage
[3:09:52.280 --> 3:09:58.200]  the news will show you things breaking down and then you'll have a few events like that with wealth
[3:09:58.200 --> 3:10:02.840]  you know detroit burn new york burn area houston burned area los angeles burned
[3:10:04.840 --> 3:10:09.320]  riots in other cities cops getting killed so we're going to have curfews and checkpoints and
[3:10:09.320 --> 3:10:13.080]  selectively enforced that that's already happening across the country as crime explodes you know
[3:10:13.080 --> 3:10:17.160]  from arkansas to new york and illinois they're having the national guard do gun confiscations
[3:10:17.160 --> 3:10:20.440]  door to door gun sweeps knock and talk where they come to your house and want to talk about your
[3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:26.040]  guns and want to come in and see if you have guns and we see that new federal policing system cia
[3:10:26.040 --> 3:10:29.320]  runs the local cities the threat management threat integration centers
[3:10:31.880 --> 3:10:35.560]  and so they're going to sell the public on the military being on the streets
[3:10:35.560 --> 3:10:39.960]  in the name of security see first they were at the super bowl in the kanducky derby and
[3:10:40.520 --> 3:10:45.000]  miss america pageant troops on the news troops searching bags on the news
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:49.480]  acclimating you then it'll be for rioting then they'll set the precedent oh look they helped
[3:10:49.480 --> 3:10:57.640]  then they'll probably be massive terror attacks in the united states blamed of course on lc i
[3:10:57.640 --> 3:11:02.520]  ada then on domestic groups they're going to arrest white people and say look now you don't
[3:11:02.520 --> 3:11:05.720]  just trust the arabs they were already i told you they would say this and now they've been saying
[3:11:05.720 --> 3:11:09.960]  it told you years before there's five thousand there's ten thousand there's twenty thousand
[3:11:09.960 --> 3:11:15.000]  white al-qaeda they'll have guys in white vans shooting cops like the beltway sniper we know
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:19.640]  is an inside job then they'll grab some patsies hype up the fear more get the police and military
[3:11:19.640 --> 3:11:24.760]  against the american people to sell them on just mowing citizens down and to sell some of the
[3:11:24.760 --> 3:11:33.640]  citizens on that it's all beta tested and so only a mass awakening to exactly the things i'm saying
[3:11:33.640 --> 3:11:37.320]  and the scenarios i'm laying out folks i understand these scenarios enough and i know the enemy's
[3:11:37.320 --> 3:11:43.080]  mind enough by studying history and their current operations that i was able to predict
[3:11:43.080 --> 3:11:46.360]  the government sponsored terror in nineteen ninety seven
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:57.160]  in america destroyed by design and in subsequent films i was beating the drum that was my main
[3:11:57.160 --> 3:12:05.000]  issue government sponsored terrorism long before i made the july 25th radio and tv
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:07.720]  announcement saying they'll probably attack the world trade center they'll blame it on their
[3:12:07.720 --> 3:12:13.160]  asset bin laden and then i said they'll probably launch anthrax attacks in that same newscast
[3:12:14.120 --> 3:12:19.400]  because what they drill for they do they drill the fly planes in the buildings they do it
[3:12:20.920 --> 3:12:24.840]  they use drills to cover up what they're doing and hundreds of other points that go into that
[3:12:24.840 --> 3:12:30.760]  analysis we told you they start the implosion with a subprime mortgage we told you the banks
[3:12:30.760 --> 3:12:33.960]  will take control of the government we told you congress was being threatened with martial law
[3:12:33.960 --> 3:12:42.680]  now it's admitted we know the game plan once you understand that the enemy is pathological
[3:12:42.680 --> 3:12:45.000]  does the same stuff over and over again in different ways
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:52.200]  they've done this in third world countries over and over again it is in official army
[3:12:52.200 --> 3:12:55.960]  manuals few months ago wiki links got an army filled manual from the 70s
[3:12:55.960 --> 3:13:06.680]  and what enemy need for an army captain in black ops in asia in latin america
[3:13:08.120 --> 3:13:13.560]  in africa it was like their canteen and their 45 apc handgun
[3:13:13.560 --> 3:13:28.280]  that i mean it is as much a part of their arsenal as their backpack as their uniform
[3:13:29.160 --> 3:13:35.080]  and we we read it on air it states go out stage stage horrible events blaming on whoever the
[3:13:35.080 --> 3:13:40.520]  political opposition is see i mean that's in the army filled manuals this is what they'll do
[3:13:40.520 --> 3:13:46.040]  do and they've gotten in the military to believe i'm doing it for america i've got to kill these
[3:13:46.040 --> 3:13:52.280]  cops i've got to blow up that van full of full of la police officers to get their mind right to
[3:13:52.280 --> 3:13:59.080]  defend america i mean we've had riding and problems we've got to get the cops ready to
[3:13:59.080 --> 3:14:03.800]  be able to fire on citizens you know and then they've got the cadre teams that are you know
[3:14:03.800 --> 3:14:09.480]  put the plastic explosives in there shoot the cops up and then grab a patsy because to them
[3:14:09.480 --> 3:14:15.000]  that's a military sacrifice that's what officers are taught you send your men in to get killed
[3:14:15.000 --> 3:14:20.440]  so that you can draw the enemy out sacrifice upon that idea taken to the power of infinity
[3:14:26.360 --> 3:14:31.160]  and people have to understand these government plans because they also understand i see government
[3:14:31.160 --> 3:14:36.440]  this illegitimate corporate takeover we have using psychological warfare techniques on the people
[3:14:36.440 --> 3:14:41.720]  i mean you've now seen the private criminals take over all the banking and and pay money directly
[3:14:41.720 --> 3:14:45.240]  themselves i mean they had people that had up the companies that are being given the money
[3:14:45.800 --> 3:14:47.080]  giving the money to themselves
[3:14:51.320 --> 3:14:58.440]  now i want to start now about 20 minutes of zeitgeist the addendum everybody started calling
[3:14:58.440 --> 3:15:01.720]  me about this weeks ago and it's got a big buzz going just like zeitgeist itself and
[3:15:01.720 --> 3:15:05.960]  conservatively had over 100 million views online that's conservative that one could argue that
[3:15:05.960 --> 3:15:14.680]  zeitgeist may soon overtake loose change second edition as the most watched film still doesn't
[3:15:14.680 --> 3:15:19.560]  have the same buzz isn't talked about as much but i've seen the hit numbers on it and i think
[3:15:19.560 --> 3:15:24.120]  in a year or so the problem is loose change in which is a good thing i'm saying problem for zeitgeist
[3:15:24.120 --> 3:15:31.160]  be number one is that loose change for second edition stays super hot so but the point is
[3:15:31.160 --> 3:15:38.680]  someday it may rival as the most watched video ever and it's got a decidedly anti christian
[3:15:39.480 --> 3:15:44.680]  meant to it it's got some information that even the maker who i've talked to he used our footage
[3:15:44.680 --> 3:15:49.080]  and unauthorized which is whatever he called up and said could he use it for an official version
[3:15:49.080 --> 3:15:54.680]  i said whatever man the point is is that they had to change some stuff they got a lot of their stuff
[3:15:54.680 --> 3:16:00.120]  wrong so 90 percent of the first zeitgeist was about the private bankers in the new world order
[3:16:00.120 --> 3:16:04.760]  and all this accurate info but the first of it attacks christians basically
[3:16:08.600 --> 3:16:11.960]  and so i haven't been a promoter of it but it has woken a lot of people up and got them to think
[3:16:11.960 --> 3:16:19.160]  about other issues this zeitgeist too or addendum came out very slickly done the guy works in tv
[3:16:19.160 --> 3:16:25.960]  in new york doesn't even let his real name be known but he met it on his off time and the new
[3:16:25.960 --> 3:16:34.280]  one sounds great sounds good the new zeitgeist but i wanted to just play a couple segments of
[3:16:34.280 --> 3:16:45.000]  it and then piece by piece go through it and get you to look from another perspective at what
[3:16:45.000 --> 3:16:53.480]  the bleeding hearts in the piece are saying and doing and if you're watching on prism planet tv
[3:16:53.480 --> 3:16:59.240]  we're going to be punching it up on screen and playing clips from here but so there's better
[3:16:59.240 --> 3:17:05.720]  audio we'll be playing the audio from up in minnesota we'll go ahead and put it up on screen
[3:17:05.720 --> 3:17:08.040]  now but we're not going to play quite i don't want people to be able to look at it
[3:17:14.360 --> 3:17:20.200]  so i'm going to play clips of this and then we're going to stop it for the rest of the hour
[3:17:20.200 --> 3:17:25.880]  and and and i'm going to make a point here a point there on it we're going to break in a couple
[3:17:25.880 --> 3:17:32.120]  minutes but let's go ahead and start now playing the first few minutes of part nine it's broken
[3:17:32.120 --> 3:17:37.320]  into like 13 parts of this new addendum he put out now i'm going to get the maker on about this
[3:17:37.320 --> 3:17:42.040]  because i believe he means well but actually a lot of stuff being talked about here was said by
[3:17:42.040 --> 3:17:47.720]  carl marx and engels and others and they need to understand the globalists are aware of this
[3:17:47.720 --> 3:17:51.480]  they're going on a different path of this so let's go ahead and start playing it
[3:17:52.680 --> 3:17:58.120]  the prevailing means of transportation in our societies is by automobile and aircraft both of
[3:17:58.120 --> 3:18:04.280]  which predominantly need fossil fuels to run in the case of the automobile the battery technology
[3:18:04.280 --> 3:18:10.440]  needed to power an electric car that can go over 100 miles an hour for over 200 miles on one charge
[3:18:10.440 --> 3:18:16.520]  exists and has existed for many years however due to battery patents controlled by the oil industry
[3:18:16.520 --> 3:18:21.320]  which limits their availability to maintain market share coupled with political pressure from the
[3:18:21.320 --> 3:18:28.120]  energy industry the accessibility and affordability of this technology is limited there is absolutely
[3:18:28.120 --> 3:18:33.800]  no reason other than pure corrupt profit interest that every single vehicle in the world cannot be
[3:18:33.800 --> 3:18:40.200]  electric and utterly clean with zero need for gasoline okay as far as air hit pause there
[3:18:40.200 --> 3:18:49.720]  okay it's not just greed the globalists aren't greedy for money they issue and print the money
[3:18:49.720 --> 3:18:56.680]  they're greedy for centralization and control if the patents get out for solar panels they've had
[3:18:56.680 --> 3:19:01.960]  for more than a decade that produce in some cases 10 times what the best ones available do now
[3:19:02.840 --> 3:19:09.560]  that decentralizes their power okay it's about power it's about centralizing power through
[3:19:09.560 --> 3:19:16.440]  commodities they control and so see this this film says a lot of good true things but then connects
[3:19:16.440 --> 3:19:25.240]  those to false solutions or solutions that can be twisted well they ride back after this break
[3:19:25.240 --> 3:19:33.000]  with more of zeitgeist addendum i'm alex jones are you wondering about your retirement portfolio

[3:23:38.520 --> 3:23:44.840]  okay uh let's go ahead and uh punch up zeitgeist addendum and continue analyzing it
[3:23:44.840 --> 3:23:54.120]  go and roll it as far as airplanes it is time we realize that this means of travel is inefficient
[3:23:54.120 --> 3:24:02.920]  cumbersome slow and causes far too much pollution this is a maglev train it uses magnets for propulsion
[3:24:03.480 --> 3:24:08.680]  it is fully suspended by a magnetic field and requires less than two percent of the energy
[3:24:08.680 --> 3:24:15.720]  used for plane travel the train has no wheels so nothing can wear out the current maximum speed
[3:24:15.720 --> 3:24:23.320]  of versions of this technology as used in japan is 361 miles per hour however this version of the
[3:24:23.320 --> 3:24:30.840]  technology is very dated an organization called et3 which has connections with the venus project
[3:24:30.840 --> 3:24:36.840]  has established a tube-based maglev that can travel up to four thousand miles per hour
[3:24:36.840 --> 3:24:44.200]  and a motionless frictionless tube which can go over land or underwater imagine going from la to
[3:24:44.200 --> 3:24:50.120]  new york for an extended lunch break or from washington dc to beijing china in two hours
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:24:58.200]  this is the future of continental and intercontinental travel fast clean with only a fraction of the
[3:24:58.200 --> 3:25:05.720]  energy usage we use today for the same means in fact between maglev technology advanced battery
[3:25:05.720 --> 3:25:11.160]  storage and geothermal energy there would be no reason to ever burn fossil fuels again
[3:25:11.960 --> 3:25:17.320]  and we can do this now if we were not held back by the paralyzing profit structure all right it
[3:25:17.320 --> 3:25:23.480]  pause it's not a paralyzing profit structure great profits can be made in this it would just
[3:25:23.480 --> 3:25:31.720]  decentralize things and so you have a two-tiered system this is much of this has already been built
[3:25:31.720 --> 3:25:37.240]  and designed and a lot of its secret part of it is not secret and so that's where the hundreds
[3:25:37.240 --> 3:25:42.200]  of trillions of dollars it's hundreds of trillions spent by the west and secret projects have gone
[3:25:42.200 --> 3:25:50.040]  they have a high tech civilization above the general growth rate of the the suppressed technological
[3:25:50.040 --> 3:25:56.200]  system that we're in and again you have endless talk about oh my god these horrible profit people
[3:25:56.200 --> 3:26:01.240]  no it's done for consolidation then the profits flow if we start talking about a high tech society
[3:26:01.240 --> 3:26:06.120]  without profits that means everyone's quote equal but that means there's always a group above you
[3:26:06.120 --> 3:26:10.840]  that's going to be handing out things to quote the people that are equal so you're not really equal
[3:26:10.840 --> 3:26:16.120]  and human nature doesn't work that way okay so you just continue to hear this profit profits bad
[3:26:16.120 --> 3:26:24.360]  profit you know ownership's bad is is what it comes down to keep rolling it now america is inclined
[3:26:24.360 --> 3:26:32.200]  toward fascism it has a propensity by its dominant philosophy and religion to uphold the fascist point
[3:26:32.200 --> 3:26:39.720]  of view american industry is essentially a fascist institution if you don't understand that the minute
[3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:45.240]  you punch that time clock you walk into a dictatorship we're given notions about the
[3:26:45.960 --> 3:26:52.600]  respectability of work and um i really look at it as being paid slavery all right let's stop right
[3:26:52.600 --> 3:26:57.560]  there just like with marx and engels a hundred and something years ago they always have these
[3:26:57.560 --> 3:27:04.120]  little technocrats up that say oh it's the religious people it's fascism america is bad
[3:27:05.480 --> 3:27:11.000]  but you talk to the elitist and you look at what the un saying they're all saying the same stuff
[3:27:12.840 --> 3:27:18.200]  okay so so so they sell something that sounds great and they always sandwiched their new
[3:27:18.200 --> 3:27:23.320]  command and control system in with all the stuff they wow you with all this high tech
[3:27:24.360 --> 3:27:29.800]  then they say america is fundamentally fascist when the globalist created fascism and communism
[3:27:29.800 --> 3:27:33.640]  two different systems to consolidate top down let's continue
[3:27:35.160 --> 3:27:39.720]  they brought up to believe that you shall earn your living by the sweat of your brow
[3:27:39.720 --> 3:27:47.640]  that holds people back freeing people from treachery repetitive jobs which make a ignorant
[3:27:47.640 --> 3:27:53.800]  all right pause again working and owning your own business or creating paintings or machinery or
[3:27:53.800 --> 3:27:58.360]  whatever it is you're into that is uplifting and people want to work and want to build or
[3:27:58.360 --> 3:28:04.680]  they're totally unhappy but mixing cc they make work sound bad by comparing it to factory assembly
[3:28:04.680 --> 3:28:13.160]  line labor so see they're they're oversimplifying all of this continue problem in our society
[3:28:13.160 --> 3:28:20.040]  that is a resource based economy machines free people you see we can't imagine that
[3:28:20.040 --> 3:28:26.920]  because we've never known that kind of world all right hit pause the elite
[3:28:28.440 --> 3:28:33.240]  know that what they talked about a hundred years ago what marx talked about was partially true
[3:28:33.240 --> 3:28:39.560]  just his wet implement was wrong with machinery with the robotics with all of this we can have
[3:28:39.560 --> 3:28:47.560]  fabulous wealth individual wealth but the elite again are only using machinery to consolidate
[3:28:47.560 --> 3:28:52.040]  things and now they've gotten the point because of the robotics that they're shutting down the
[3:28:52.040 --> 3:28:56.600]  old free market economy and then just saying we're all going to basically serve some slaves
[3:28:56.600 --> 3:29:02.280]  not using increased production to empower us but using increased production by select
[3:29:02.280 --> 3:29:08.920]  technical systems to actually make humans themselves obsolete and not empower us whereas
[3:29:08.920 --> 3:29:13.320]  they're saying the machines would empower us it's the opposite it's being used to enslave us
[3:29:13.320 --> 3:29:20.280]  we'll be right back up to this quick break to continue stay with me we're on the march the
[3:29:20.280 --> 3:29:25.560]  empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:29:25.560 --> 3:29:35.160]  the day unlike any other in the long course of american history a terrorist act of war against
[3:29:35.160 --> 3:29:39.800]  this country the enemy struck america on september 11th but who is the enemy
[3:29:45.880 --> 3:29:49.720]  enemies is the first 9 11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[3:29:49.720 --> 3:29:54.600]  intelligence networks inside the united states some u.s investigators believe that there are
[3:29:54.600 --> 3:30:01.400]  israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the u.s i'm aware that some israeli
[3:30:01.400 --> 3:30:07.160]  citizens have been detained london's connections to the cia the hijackers ties to the fbi the
[3:30:07.160 --> 3:30:11.800]  saudi arabian connection the israeli intelligence network warnings and war games the shadow
[3:30:11.800 --> 3:30:17.800]  government and much much more fabled enemies get the dvd at info wars dot com or see it in
[3:30:17.800 --> 3:30:23.560]  super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prison planet dot tv either you are with
[3:30:23.560 --> 3:30:33.400]  us or you are with the terrorists you know i know exactly what you're thinking when it comes to this
[3:30:33.400 --> 3:30:39.240]  economy the banks are crashing the stock markets and mess there's the mortgage crisis there's the
[3:30:39.240 --> 3:30:45.960]  lending crisis there is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis and we are
[3:30:45.960 --> 3:30:49.880]  paralyzed a little bit we don't know exactly how to respond to it i don't know what to say i'm what
[3:30:49.880 --> 3:30:53.960]  can you do do what you can do that's what you do you do what you can do what i can do is i can
[3:30:53.960 --> 3:30:57.880]  put some food away i know there's a global food shortage i can read it i can go to eat foods
[3:30:57.880 --> 3:31:02.600]  direct dot com read hundreds of articles about this i can go up on the google website and google
[3:31:02.600 --> 3:31:06.680]  food shortage and see the world's a mess i know it you know it look at the prices look where they're
[3:31:06.680 --> 3:31:11.400]  headed be prepared take care of yourself you owe your family some security some sense of self
[3:31:11.400 --> 3:31:15.960]  being a little bit of self reliance is a good idea right now get some food from eat foods direct
[3:31:15.960 --> 3:31:19.640]  dot com go up to eat foods direct dot com right now look hey you don't even have to can your own

[3:32:36.840 --> 3:32:44.360]  rolling around the bed and i ain't seen the sun shines since i don't know when i'm stuck in fools
[3:32:44.360 --> 3:32:55.720]  and prison and time keeps dragging on but that's great okay i want to finish up with analyzing
[3:32:55.720 --> 3:33:00.280]  these zeitgeist clips i hope i can do it from the time we have left when i was just a baby
[3:33:01.320 --> 3:33:05.960]  again it was christians who ended slavery in this country it was christians who said no in europe
[3:33:05.960 --> 3:33:10.680]  and england and so you've got people who who misinterpret the bible or did things with it
[3:33:10.680 --> 3:33:15.960]  were bad you know did things with it were good but but just always the message that it's christians
[3:33:15.960 --> 3:33:21.080]  fault america's bad and then mixing it in with a bunch of fancy technology one has nothing to do with
[3:33:21.080 --> 3:33:26.120]  it and they're not even addressing that the elite have already built these advanced technologies
[3:33:26.120 --> 3:33:32.760]  and spacecraft and trains they're just using it all in their secret programs and they're going to
[3:33:32.760 --> 3:33:40.840]  use all this high tech against us let's go ahead and keep playing it if we look back at history
[3:33:40.840 --> 3:33:47.960]  we see a very clear pattern of machine automation slowly replacing human labor from the disappearance
[3:33:47.960 --> 3:33:54.280]  of the elevator man to the near full automation of an automobile production plant the fact is
[3:33:54.280 --> 3:34:00.760]  as technology grows the need for humans in the workforce will continually be diminished this
[3:34:00.760 --> 3:34:08.600]  creates a serious clash which proves the falseness of the monetary based labor system for human
[3:34:08.600 --> 3:34:15.000]  employment is in direct competition with technological development therefore given the
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:21.320]  fundamental priority of profit by industry people through time will be continually laid off and
[3:34:21.320 --> 3:34:28.200]  replaced by machines not stop there the problem is humans are hierarchical by their very nature
[3:34:28.200 --> 3:34:34.920]  like dogs or parrots or most other active creatures but much more advanced and so someone
[3:34:34.920 --> 3:34:39.080]  isn't going to want to design a new computer or design a new algorithm or an idea or a new
[3:34:39.080 --> 3:34:46.520]  phone system or if they can't quote sell it we're competitive we're not honeybees or ants
[3:34:46.520 --> 3:34:52.440]  that are communal creatures so what happens is every time the public sold on this utopia of
[3:34:52.440 --> 3:34:58.920]  alhalla it's used by the controllers the master planners to set up an even more stratified
[3:34:58.920 --> 3:35:04.040]  society a true free market will create the greatest equity and the greatest diversity
[3:35:04.840 --> 3:35:10.360]  what are you seeing now socialism being used by the bankers who use crony false capitalism
[3:35:10.360 --> 3:35:16.600]  through government to bankrupt the economy and suck it under their control so this is just the
[3:35:16.600 --> 3:35:22.280]  classic stuff that marx and engels had to say and it is true with all the new technological
[3:35:22.280 --> 3:35:27.640]  developments that we could empower ourselves have much safer working conditions not have all the
[3:35:27.640 --> 3:35:35.320]  toxic waste and junk and that humans then need goals like going to space and then and then
[3:35:35.320 --> 3:35:41.640]  corporations being funded to do that and not wasting our money on wars and fighting and so
[3:35:41.640 --> 3:35:47.800]  they call for in this film a world government to implement the you know the end of war and all this
[3:35:47.800 --> 3:35:53.080]  peace but that's what the globalists said a hundred years ago so they funded world war one
[3:35:53.080 --> 3:35:57.640]  and they wrote they bragged they funded it to scare people into accepting the utopia oh it's
[3:35:57.640 --> 3:36:01.560]  we have to scare them and do what we want no they wanted to have wars and consolidate power
[3:36:01.560 --> 3:36:07.320]  and then oh world war two they staged that's declassified to again get their united nations
[3:36:07.320 --> 3:36:12.520]  then they hand out nuclear weapons to pakistan and others to again have to have their police state
[3:36:14.200 --> 3:36:18.920]  so i'm all for a planetary federation but with sovereign independent diverse countries that act
[3:36:18.920 --> 3:36:25.080]  as firewalls to corruption and then if they all want to go vote on planetary directives and ideas
[3:36:25.080 --> 3:36:31.560]  and space exploration or technological agreements but still the section of the train in the us is
[3:36:31.560 --> 3:36:36.120]  owned by the us and the section of the train in england is owned by england the section of the
[3:36:36.120 --> 3:36:40.680]  train in china is owned by china and if the people pay for it it's got to be in law that it didn't
[3:36:40.680 --> 3:36:49.080]  hand it over to some corporation because they become government so um again they just simplify
[3:36:49.080 --> 3:36:54.360]  this so much and and it totally sells weak minded people and it's very dangerous because he gets into
[3:36:54.360 --> 3:37:00.360]  you know competition will be eradicated profit will be eradicated oh who's gonna eradicate
[3:37:00.360 --> 3:37:07.000]  you're gonna force that's hardcore tyranny back to the clip when industry takes on the machine
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:12.920]  instead of shortening the work day they downsize you lose your job so you have a right all right
[3:37:12.920 --> 3:37:19.160]  pause no what happens is corporations fool us to downsize 50 years ago putting a thank you on
[3:37:19.160 --> 3:37:25.080]  the trash can and using peer pressure and our gentlemanliness to throw away the tray of mcdonald's
[3:37:25.080 --> 3:37:30.600]  food then everybody adopts it then you get no service and end up paying as much or more just
[3:37:30.600 --> 3:37:36.200]  like everything was self-service cars lasted longer people filled them up they were taken care of
[3:37:36.200 --> 3:37:41.400]  you got service it gave people entry-level jobs but then you accepted them phasing that out
[3:37:41.400 --> 3:37:47.720]  so no we demand higher service we demand higher quality uh we demand you see and you're gonna
[3:37:47.720 --> 3:37:52.600]  still need technicians to run all this this system would stagnate overnight or they were able to do
[3:37:52.600 --> 3:37:57.960]  this now the globalist who planned to set this up and call to utopia it's going to be a technocracy
[3:37:57.960 --> 3:38:03.160]  over us we're in this sub area below and you got these technological spires with the technocrats
[3:38:03.160 --> 3:38:10.440]  above where they eradicate our normal instincts for peace but the elite gets to keep its instinct
[3:38:10.440 --> 3:38:15.400]  of domination no good people have to combine together against other powerful groups of evil
[3:38:15.400 --> 3:38:21.080]  people to keep a level playing field so we can have our liberty this is very dangerous film let's
[3:38:21.080 --> 3:38:28.440]  go back to it games in a high technology resource-based economy it is conservative to say that about
[3:38:28.440 --> 3:38:35.080]  90 percent of all current occupations could be phased out by machines freeing humans to live
[3:38:35.080 --> 3:38:41.160]  their life without servitude let's hit pause this is the point uh freeing humans not on their own
[3:38:41.160 --> 3:38:45.800]  businesses freeing humans to not have to strive and work to be on prozac watching tv all day and
[3:38:45.800 --> 3:38:50.440]  wire headed into the matrix that's why they wrote why the future doesn't need us for wired magazine
[3:38:50.440 --> 3:38:54.520]  where the elites say because of this they don't need us anymore so they're just going to kill us
[3:38:54.520 --> 3:39:00.680]  and then that's the eugenics idea that goes back to mouth us 250 years ago here it is for this is
[3:39:00.680 --> 3:39:07.240]  the point of technology itself and through time with nanotechnology and other highly advanced
[3:39:07.240 --> 3:39:13.560]  forms of science it is not far fetched to see how even complex medical procedures could be
[3:39:13.560 --> 3:39:20.120]  performed by machines as well and based on the pattern with much higher success rates than humans
[3:39:20.120 --> 3:39:25.400]  get today well they're already hit pause you see there's the implication that this technology
[3:39:25.400 --> 3:39:29.160]  isn't being somewhat deployed and the machines aren't already doing some of the surgeries
[3:39:30.920 --> 3:39:34.840]  but the problem is they're suppressing the real developments and the public's not getting that
[3:39:36.040 --> 3:39:41.160]  and they've also collateralized the healthcare system in a derivative so they're ripping you off
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:46.840]  to make investments because the insurance companies are cheating you so of course we're
[3:39:46.840 --> 3:39:50.840]  going to be able to have longer life but the elite want to freeze the technological development
[3:39:50.840 --> 3:39:56.520]  with the fake green revolution with the new carbon taxes and the regulations so that we
[3:39:56.520 --> 3:40:02.200]  don't get access to this it's meant to kill economies right at the point when we're about
[3:40:02.200 --> 3:40:09.000]  to be freed by the technology back to it but our monetary based structure which requires labor for
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:16.680]  income blocks this progress for humans need jobs in order to survive the bottom line is that this
[3:40:16.680 --> 3:40:21.000]  system must hit pause humans have had to hunter gather they've had to have agrarian they've had
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:28.920]  city-states this is how we're designed so see the ideas are eradicating money eradicate yeah that
[3:40:28.920 --> 3:40:34.280]  means your family farm that means your family patents this is theft and there's always control
[3:40:34.280 --> 3:40:40.600]  freaks pushing this back to it never be free and technology will be constantly paralyzed
[3:40:41.720 --> 3:40:48.760]  we have machines that clean out sewers it frees a human being from doing that so look at machines
[3:40:48.760 --> 3:40:57.880]  as extensions of human performance furthermore many occupations today will have simply no basis
[3:40:57.880 --> 3:41:04.360]  to exist in a resource-based economy such as anything associated with the management of money
[3:41:04.360 --> 3:41:11.400]  advertising along with the legal system itself for without money a great majority of the crimes
[3:41:11.400 --> 3:41:17.000]  that are committed today would never occur hit pause the system knows that that's why they make
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:22.600]  drugs illegal to then control the black market and make larger profits and have an excuse to
[3:41:22.600 --> 3:41:28.520]  criminalize 87 percent of the public that smokes marijuana or has smoked it 87 percent of drug
[3:41:28.520 --> 3:41:34.440]  users that's about half the public only smoke marijuana and so the idea that criminal minds
[3:41:34.440 --> 3:41:37.720]  won't move on to other things that are illegal they're criminal because they like to be criminal
[3:41:37.720 --> 3:41:42.120]  and because there's profits to be made and things that are illegal like currency that would then be
[3:41:42.120 --> 3:41:48.920]  illegal no then you wouldn't have money to defend yourself then you're at the whim of whoever runs
[3:41:48.920 --> 3:41:53.880]  this system they'll say well committees will imagine all the control freak lazy wannabes
[3:41:53.880 --> 3:41:59.160]  want to move into your houses they want your life and then they're still going to be better looks
[3:41:59.160 --> 3:42:02.520]  they're still going to be stronger people they're still going to be stuff they want so how do they
[3:42:02.520 --> 3:42:09.560]  standardize that well the packs of scum come and kill you is what they do somebody's always going
[3:42:09.560 --> 3:42:14.040]  to want your wife somebody's always going to want your business somebody's always going to want what
[3:42:14.040 --> 3:42:19.160]  you got and it's these people that want it here we go we all forms of crime are a consequence of
[3:42:19.160 --> 3:42:25.960]  the monetary system either directly or by neuroses inflicted through financial deprivation
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:30.360]  no really so stop statistically psychopaths are more well to do
[3:42:31.560 --> 3:42:36.040]  statistically a lot of crime comes out of boredom idle hands the devil's workshop
[3:42:36.040 --> 3:42:43.240]  this just isn't true continue with it selves could eventually become extinct instead of putting up
[3:42:43.240 --> 3:42:49.800]  a sign drive carefully slippery went wet put abrasive in the highway so it's not slippery went
[3:42:49.800 --> 3:42:55.240]  wet and the person gets in the car they're drunk and the car oscillates a great deal wait a minute
[3:42:55.240 --> 3:43:01.160]  how does somebody work then service the machines and fill them with aggregate fill them in to go
[3:43:01.160 --> 3:43:06.600]  cover the roads or how does someone work to design the roads as an architect and get paid
[3:43:07.400 --> 3:43:12.760]  oh but machines run everything so now we turn our just like people could could calculate better
[3:43:12.760 --> 3:43:16.920]  they could spell better before spell checkers before calculators i'm not saying get rid of them
[3:43:16.920 --> 3:43:22.440]  my point is you're talking about a bunch of blob jellyfish like out of walley you've seen that movie
[3:43:22.440 --> 3:43:29.160]  floating around on the hollow deck of some cruise ship i mean this is unbelievable back to it pendulum
[3:43:29.160 --> 3:43:36.200]  that swings up and back and that'll pull the car over the side not a law solution put sonar and
[3:43:36.200 --> 3:43:42.920]  radar and automobiles so they can't hit one another man made laws are attempts to deal with yeah
[3:43:42.920 --> 3:43:47.480]  hit pause again the the technocrats will make laws through the computers that you can't drive
[3:43:47.480 --> 3:43:52.200]  your car yourself that way you'll be safe see which is what the pentagon says we're going to
[3:43:52.200 --> 3:43:56.680]  put you in a tank with a wire head no more war no more nothing and if perceptions reality
[3:43:56.680 --> 3:44:00.200]  you're going to love the wonderful life you've gotten cyberspace so you don't you know you're

[3:44:28.360 --> 3:44:33.720]  this wonderful utopia no more work haha after we line you up and shoot you in the back of the head

[3:44:55.640 --> 3:45:02.760]  to the next clip and then a few minutes into this he talks about money competition jobs you know

[3:45:08.040 --> 3:45:12.680]  well who makes the hot dogs who has the meat who raises the cows it destroys the diversity
[3:45:12.680 --> 3:45:16.840]  of the beautiful free market system that the socialist controllers the bankers have taken
[3:45:16.840 --> 3:45:22.200]  over and then they ruin it and then blame what they've done on us collectivism doesn't work
[3:45:22.200 --> 3:45:26.520]  even with a high-tech overlay in fact it will create the greatest forms of tyranny as we're
[3:45:26.520 --> 3:45:32.520]  now seeing go ahead and go to the next clip you got it ready here is the next clip patriotism
[3:45:33.400 --> 3:45:42.040]  weapons armies navies all that is a sign that we're not civilized yet kids will have a hit pause
[3:45:42.040 --> 3:45:47.240]  didn't all that is a sign that we are humans that are warlike and there's always evil people
[3:45:47.240 --> 3:45:52.040]  that want to dominate us and yes when we build up a weapon system a lot of times it ends up being
[3:45:52.040 --> 3:45:56.600]  used against us so we've got a limited like the founding fathers said and protect liberty
[3:45:56.600 --> 3:46:02.600]  and and and prosecute corruption but see the un wants all our guns then they're the only ones
[3:46:02.600 --> 3:46:09.000]  that are going to have them a monopoly of power so see oh we're barbarous go back to it yeah kids
[3:46:09.000 --> 3:46:16.680]  will ask their parents didn't you see the necessity of the machines dad couldn't you see that war was
[3:46:16.680 --> 3:46:22.600]  inevitable when you produce scarcity isn't it obvious of course the kid will understand
[3:46:22.600 --> 3:46:29.800]  as your pinheads raised merely to serve the established institutions were such an abominable
[3:46:29.800 --> 3:46:37.320]  sick society that we won't make the history all right it was hey that hit pause what he's saying
[3:46:37.960 --> 3:46:43.160]  is exactly what the elites are implementing they're using the technology to fully take over and
[3:46:43.160 --> 3:46:49.960]  remove humans from the equation but to dominate us and control us instead he's saying no accelerate
[3:46:49.960 --> 3:46:55.640]  this so we'll be empowered that's not what's going to happen just sit back and watch what develops go
[3:46:55.640 --> 3:47:02.440]  ahead make the history but i just say that large nations took land from small nations used force
[3:47:02.440 --> 3:47:08.520]  and violence you'll get history talked about as corrupt behavior all the way along until the
[3:47:08.520 --> 3:47:15.640]  beginning of the civilized world that's when all the nations work together world unification working
[3:47:15.640 --> 3:47:24.520]  toward common good for all human beings and without anyone being subservient to anyone else oh yeah
[3:47:24.520 --> 3:47:31.880]  of social stratification whether it be technical elitism or any other kind of elitism eradicated
[3:47:31.880 --> 3:47:39.960]  in the face of the earth back that up back that up 20 seconds back that up because i want you to
[3:47:39.960 --> 3:47:47.160]  hear that carefully who is going to enforce no social strata of any type eradicated and violence
[3:47:47.160 --> 3:47:52.840]  you'll get history talked about as corrupt behavior all the way along until the beginning
[3:47:52.840 --> 3:48:00.200]  of the civilized world that's when all the nations work together world unification working toward
[3:48:00.200 --> 3:48:08.920]  common good for all human beings and without anyone being subservient to anyone else without
[3:48:08.920 --> 3:48:15.720]  social stratification whether it be technical elitism or any other kind of elitism eradicated
[3:48:15.720 --> 3:48:25.960]  from the face of the earth eradicated eradicated john have nothing have you connected the other
[3:48:25.960 --> 3:48:30.360]  ISD because i can't continue here it's it's blasting in my ears actually that's being used we can
[3:48:30.360 --> 3:48:35.800]  switch over the access unit switch over to the access unit i can't do this okay all right here
[3:48:35.800 --> 3:48:45.400]  we go folks um i mean as things get more complex it allows centralization by elites to dominate and
[3:48:45.400 --> 3:48:52.040]  the public aren't specialist uh but in a few areas individually and so can't grasp it and so this
[3:48:52.040 --> 3:48:57.800]  is a hellish trap humanity's making for itself i am for technological development uh but i am for
[3:48:57.800 --> 3:49:08.680]  education open free market the opposite of what we are seeing out of this the opposite of what we're

[3:49:26.840 --> 3:49:31.800]  were going to do and katie bar the door and what are the bankers doing it the same thing right now
[3:49:31.800 --> 3:49:35.720]  they're selling the same thing to the children the bankers get taught what they want in schools
[3:49:35.720 --> 3:49:44.600]  and they teach this unification world government coming together under them though and um this
[3:49:44.600 --> 3:49:53.080]  is how they pacify the huge throngs the masses uh and and and and it's so sick and then the exceptional
[3:49:53.080 --> 3:49:57.720]  get punished the people that save and work hard but aren't corrupt they get punished and then the
[3:49:57.720 --> 3:50:02.600]  exceptional who are evil they get to run everything not these uh delusional

[3:53:40.680 --> 3:53:46.440]  him some questions i don't think they're bad people always fall for the same tricks
[3:53:46.440 --> 3:53:55.720]  and it's true that advanced technologies automation robotics can just absolutely empower humanity
[3:53:57.160 --> 3:54:04.120]  there can be surgeons and technicians already now with very you know inexpensive mass produced
[3:54:04.120 --> 3:54:08.840]  machinery to get people better health care all of it the elite says all of that and says
[3:54:10.120 --> 3:54:15.000]  the main crowd pushing the agenda of what you just heard are the globalists selling their
[3:54:15.000 --> 3:54:19.480]  minions with this that's kind of the religion that the UN and we can play Walter Cronkite
[3:54:19.480 --> 3:54:25.480]  saying the same thing you know global governance world unification people don't want to be unified
[3:54:25.480 --> 3:54:29.800]  it's going to be done by the sword and there's going to be no nation to stand against the tyranny
[3:54:29.800 --> 3:54:35.800]  that runs it and power corrupts absolutely folks power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely
[3:54:36.920 --> 3:54:41.800]  the true quote by luke lord actin was power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts
[3:54:41.800 --> 3:54:47.560]  absolutely and so it doesn't work the social planners you look what they've done they seize
[3:54:47.560 --> 3:54:54.760]  your children you they build prisons they did it's horrible the control freaks cannot be
[3:54:54.760 --> 3:55:00.360]  turned loose to the tenant through the technocracy and that is what's happening but i know that these
[3:55:00.360 --> 3:55:05.480]  guys have a lot of laudable goals and things here when you start talking about eradicating money
[3:55:05.480 --> 3:55:11.880]  and any form of class you know that means a bomb on the street that's got a nicer jacket
[3:55:11.880 --> 3:55:15.880]  has got to give his jacket up to somebody else can you imagine the hellishness of that
[3:55:17.320 --> 3:55:21.240]  so they're the globalists are masters they're blaming free market on what's happening now
[3:55:21.240 --> 3:55:25.720]  that's not what's happening government took the pension funds government set up fanny
[3:55:25.720 --> 3:55:31.160]  man freddy mac they did all of this government's giving the bankers all the currency right now
[3:55:31.160 --> 3:55:35.720]  you notice these socialists are never going to say just give direct money right to the people
[3:55:35.720 --> 3:55:42.280]  give land no strings of tax right to the people that's a free market socialism to say take all
[3:55:42.280 --> 3:55:50.680]  the government lands and just give you know however many acres there are broken up to american
[3:55:50.680 --> 3:55:55.640]  citizens take the tens of millions of acres take take half the tens of millions of acres
[3:55:55.640 --> 3:56:00.840]  that are just in the west and just give it each to american citizens well the argument is and
[3:56:00.840 --> 3:56:04.280]  it's a true one a lot of people wouldn't want it wouldn't want to take care of it wouldn't care
[3:56:04.280 --> 3:56:08.440]  but then people who wanted it then the government would corrupt that process of giving the land
[3:56:08.440 --> 3:56:12.120]  out regardless it's still be better than nothing yeah you want to come out here and get a claim
[3:56:12.120 --> 3:56:17.160]  you want to come out here and put a fence up around this you can have it that's true free market
[3:56:18.600 --> 3:56:23.720]  taking over the socialist cake and then dividing it you want decentralization you want local
[3:56:23.720 --> 3:56:30.680]  economies that's what you want not this not this mega centralization and you use the machines to
[3:56:30.680 --> 3:56:34.440]  empower the people that way but then locals own the machines and do what they want with it
[3:56:35.880 --> 3:56:40.200]  i want to bring ten Anderson up at the last two minutes of the show ted you did an offer today
