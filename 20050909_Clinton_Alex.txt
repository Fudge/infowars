[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]  You're going through this whole thing about, and if somebody asked me how I think the
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.360]  emergency management structure of the government should be organized, I'd be happy to give
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.360]  an answer.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.360]  But I just think right now we need to focus on the suffering of the people and how to
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.280]  alleviate it and where to go from here.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.280]  Thank you all very much.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.280]  Thank you very much.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.280]  Thank you very much.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.280]  Thank you very much.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.280]  Thank you very much.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.280]  Thank you very much.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.280]  Thank you very much.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.280]  Thank you very much.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.280]  Thank you very much.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.280]  Thank you very much.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.280]  Thank you very much.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.280]  Mr. Clinton.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.280]  Mr. Clinton.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.560]  Mr. Clinton.
