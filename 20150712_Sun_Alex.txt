[00:00.000 --> 00:18.720]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report it's alex jones you're also
[00:18.720 --> 00:24.040]  watching on the free screens and info wars dot com ports last show on this 12th day of
[00:24.040 --> 00:35.440]  July we're now halfway into 2015 really hard to believe we are simulcast across the United
[00:35.440 --> 00:39.980]  States and as I said simulcasting with the podcast the audio feeds video feeds and info
[00:39.980 --> 00:47.160]  wars dot com and prison planet dot com just look at these headlines offended flea market
[00:47.160 --> 00:58.400]  shopper calls 911 over confederate merchandise I was shaking and almost vomiting that stories
[00:58.400 --> 01:04.760]  from the american mirror upon drudge report dot com this is the mental illness mind control
[01:04.760 --> 01:12.720]  where people now go in the national cathedral and see a stained glass relief of the surrender
[01:12.720 --> 01:18.280]  of the confederate forces at the end of the civil war and they just like 10 minutes of
[01:18.280 --> 01:26.120]  eight from 1984 they see it of course most americans you ask them when the civil war
[01:26.120 --> 01:32.360]  was I don't even know the decade some of the century or who was involved 8 out of 10 californians
[01:32.360 --> 01:38.280]  we've talked to randomly and think that independence day was from the south because the south is
[01:38.280 --> 01:44.440]  now the enemy you see we have this twisted warped globalist culture where there's no
[01:44.440 --> 01:55.160]  information no no facts just just just mindlessness meanwhile donald trump comes out and you would
[01:55.160 --> 02:01.080]  think that this is the only thing happening in the universe we're in like week three
[02:01.080 --> 02:05.720]  and says a lot of criminals are coming in from all over the world and from latin america
[02:05.720 --> 02:11.360]  not good workers not smart folks not good people we need to stop the felons coming in that's
[02:11.360 --> 02:16.680]  like saying we need to keep drug dealers out of schoolyards and they just go it's insane
[02:16.680 --> 02:22.200]  it's incredible it's horrible he's the worst person in the world to overthrow reality and
[02:22.200 --> 02:32.720]  common sense and it's perfect because trump is a huge hillary clinton donor I don't trust
[02:32.720 --> 02:38.960]  him as far as I could throw him but he's saying stuff that's true trump will take our country
[02:38.960 --> 02:46.720]  back trump tapping into inner anger republicans 17 contenders battle to stand out in the crowd
[02:46.720 --> 02:53.120]  and what trumps doing is standing out by telling the truth and we've now reached the point
[02:53.120 --> 03:01.080]  where people are at museums I've seen articles and they see a confederate flag or a nazi
[03:01.080 --> 03:09.640]  flag and the two are really separate completely so the confederate flags like 3% slavery the
[03:09.640 --> 03:23.360]  nazi flag is 100% megalomania takeover conquest genetic engineering dystopic utopia garbage
[03:23.360 --> 03:28.560]  but of course the real spirit of the nazis runs things today because they were just one
[03:28.560 --> 03:37.400]  manifestation they were not the daddy they were the baby Walmart to melt class rings
[03:37.400 --> 03:42.560]  bring a federal flag rather than complete orders that's right you can't go if you went
[03:42.560 --> 03:48.880]  to one of these universities it has this assemble and get it even though it's tiny you can't
[03:48.880 --> 03:55.920]  really see it on the ring this is the mental illness and then people have had all their
[03:55.920 --> 04:00.720]  basic rights and freedoms taken they don't care if troops are under IBM computers that
[04:00.720 --> 04:06.680]  say do not give treatment so humans can say they weren't involved in killing them they
[04:06.680 --> 04:13.760]  don't want to fight through beyond nazism from the actual company that ran the nazi
[04:13.760 --> 04:20.440]  death camps they want to just see a confederate flag that was incredibly popular in the north
[04:20.440 --> 04:25.760]  until the 60s and 70s because it was so honorable and because it fought and won battles of
[04:25.760 --> 04:30.400]  three to one five to one ten to one I mean the british war college still studies the
[04:30.400 --> 04:36.800]  confederate generals militaries all over the world did because they won some of the biggest
[04:36.800 --> 04:44.200]  battles ever when they were outnumbered and that's why the US army there's so many bases
[04:44.200 --> 04:48.800]  named every confederate generals and why until recently being on the side of tanks was because
[04:48.800 --> 04:53.760]  this is like a symbol of some badass people but instead they've just converted reality
[04:53.760 --> 04:58.160]  and real nazis are running everything and we're in a giant extermination grid with poison

[08:49.080 --> 08:55.160]  a flea market and they see some war memorabilia shop that has always been one of the most
[08:55.160 --> 09:01.400]  popular things with vets who like to collect things and you're going to see raf that's

[09:17.920 --> 09:24.160]  that was you know 500 bucks and i couldn't have it obviously if you own a japanese samurai
[09:24.160 --> 09:28.480]  sword from world war two carried by their officers it doesn't mean you supported the
[09:28.480 --> 09:36.520]  invasion of china or korea doesn't mean you supported the invasion of other areas and
[09:36.520 --> 09:45.920]  i mean obviously only a mentally ill mental midget with an iq below room temperature would
[09:45.920 --> 09:54.520]  know that obviously if i own a japanese world war two samurai sword i'm not a nazi or i'm
[09:54.520 --> 10:02.040]  not a member of the axis powers i mean quite frankly the public so mentally ill and so
[10:02.040 --> 10:09.360]  stupid i'm just saying this to even bait them i own a world war two luger and a walther
[10:09.360 --> 10:15.360]  and one of them was given to me as a gift the other i bought as an investment i bought
[10:15.360 --> 10:18.720]  the luger for about two thousand dollars i could sell it for fifteen thousand dollars
[10:18.720 --> 10:26.320]  right now i'm a smart investor i'm not an idiot and it's a really cool guy and it was
[10:26.320 --> 10:32.760]  carried by a german army officer and i've got british world war two guns u.s. world
[10:32.760 --> 10:39.160]  war two it's cool they're all real cool and if you mental midget jackasses can handle
[10:39.160 --> 10:45.560]  it could go piss up a rope and i'm sorry to have to talk like that but dealing with it
[10:45.560 --> 10:54.120]  is insane dealing france years ago i told you it was coming here banned nazi memorabilia
[10:54.120 --> 10:59.040]  being sold at their swap meets and their stores and online and then next it was credit sizing
[10:59.040 --> 11:06.360]  radical islam and then now in california they've got the bill introduced to ban it's already
[11:06.360 --> 11:12.600]  in a bunch of cities the use of the word mother and father because it's hurtful and husband
[11:12.600 --> 11:18.880]  and wife see because if you're a boy or a girl that hurts someone that's also being banned
[11:18.880 --> 11:26.680]  in schools boys and girls are now called purple penguins that's mainstream news the videos
[11:26.680 --> 11:32.200]  the articles the newscaster up on info wars dot com so all these serious things are going
[11:32.200 --> 11:50.840]  on i'm gonna cover this more later this person walks in to a store and sees a rebel flag
[11:50.840 --> 11:58.000]  and goes into convulsions by the way the clinton's for both presidential campaigns use the rebel
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.400]  flag in the south on their official bumper stickers and signs millions were issued because
[12:02.400 --> 12:08.280]  even back then everybody knew it had to do with southern pride period and nothing to
[12:08.280 --> 12:14.480]  do with slavery but the media made it about that offended flea market shopper calls 9-1-1
[12:14.480 --> 12:21.600]  over confederate merchandise a scene they want to ban free speech a shopper pursuing
[12:21.600 --> 12:25.320]  the merchandise at the redwood county flea market was so offended by a vendor selling
[12:25.320 --> 12:31.720]  confederate and not the historical memorabilia the person actually called 9-1-1 wallings
[12:31.720 --> 12:35.160]  were connected police were dispatched the flea market to investigate they actually responded
[12:35.160 --> 12:39.320]  imagine there's people selling confederate flags and not these stuff and the cops actually
[12:39.320 --> 12:44.600]  showed up the police chief william wright tells news eight the reason no one was arrested
[12:44.600 --> 12:53.080]  was because the items were being sold on private property not to mention no laws were broken
[12:53.080 --> 12:58.080]  because the police all at the top go along with this because this is what they've been
[12:58.080 --> 13:03.520]  told to do I was talking to my son about the summer camp he went to last year he had told
[13:03.520 --> 13:09.080]  me this till now I looked it up online actually found the curriculum they they changed the
[13:09.080 --> 13:13.280]  he liked it so but they changed the curriculum it was more common sense now this year he
[13:13.280 --> 13:19.640]  just got back and they were actually basically teaching democratic party hardcore socialist
[13:19.640 --> 13:24.560]  garbage and it's a protestant christian camp and that's because to the world council of
[13:24.560 --> 13:31.320]  churches they tell these people what to teach and what to do and it's just outrageous and
[13:31.320 --> 13:39.240]  it's stuff you'd be taught in the public school being taught I mean here was one thing men
[13:39.240 --> 13:47.960]  can only do some things women can do everything just this weird bizarre stuff but this is what
[13:47.960 --> 14:04.080]  happens in america I was shaking he tells the paper I had to run
[14:04.080 --> 14:12.880]  I mean this is just crazy and of course the seller goes on to say hey I'm just selling
[14:12.880 --> 14:18.080]  what you can't keep in stock well of course I mean I need to send our crew out to the
[14:18.080 --> 14:23.160]  next gun show and just show you know usually some old world war two vet behind the counter
[14:23.160 --> 14:27.280]  but most of those guys are dead now there's always some vet behind the counter likes to
[14:27.280 --> 14:36.360]  collect stuff and they're right there selling army knives marine corps knives german knives
[14:36.360 --> 14:41.920]  greek knives it's and whatever's the rarest and the weirdest you know some russian world
[14:41.920 --> 14:47.680]  war one dagger will be like five thousand dollars I mean does that mean you support the russians
[14:47.680 --> 14:53.600]  in world war one and the average person just is so ignorant they just want to feel important
[14:53.600 --> 14:57.960]  and powerful so they just pick something and freak out about it and I know I harp on this
[14:57.960 --> 15:04.200]  a lot it's because this victory of ignorance over reality is what's going to bring the
[15:04.200 --> 15:09.040]  country and the world down donald trump was mentioned we're gonna play this clip coming
[15:09.040 --> 15:25.600]  up after the break 200 plus times it's what's called a trump gasm he was mentioned 239 times

[20:25.400 --> 20:36.880]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central we're here live back Sunday's 4 to
[20:36.880 --> 20:42.840]  6 p.m. Central I'm your host Alex Jones we're watching the takedown not just of our country
[20:42.840 --> 20:48.880]  but the world of the global technotronic technocracy that is using social engineering
[20:48.880 --> 20:56.000]  tribal warfare to bring down the once sovereign countries of the world and to distract the
[20:56.000 --> 21:03.840]  populations that are being enslaved and fed on with all the class warfare race warfare
[21:03.840 --> 21:12.280]  garbage and much of the ignorant public plays along with it like rats being led by the pied
[21:12.280 --> 21:19.600]  piper before I get into Donald Trump I thought I'd play a chilling statement from Jimmy Carter
[21:19.600 --> 21:29.240]  former U.S. president saying America is in inevitable decline not Obama's fault so while
[21:29.240 --> 21:35.800]  one mouth they tell you everything's fine it's the best economy since sliced bread
[21:35.800 --> 21:39.840]  on the other side they say no we're really in a global depression but don't worry it's
[21:39.840 --> 21:45.440]  not Obama's fault well no it's not Obama's fault it's the big private central banks that
[21:45.440 --> 21:51.360]  are engineering this whole show they engineered Greece they engineered the euro they engineered
[21:51.360 --> 21:57.840]  what's happening in China to consolidate power it's called economic warfare so let's go to
[21:57.840 --> 22:06.880]  this chilling statement well we're in a inevitable relative decline in worldwide influence not
[22:06.880 --> 22:12.360]  because of any fault of ours but it's as I said inevitable I think that the combination
[22:12.360 --> 22:19.760]  of China and India and Brazil and South Africa and other others as they increase in economic
[22:19.760 --> 22:27.160]  and cultural influence will replace a lot of the power and preeminence that the United
[22:27.160 --> 22:32.840]  States has enjoyed in the past so we're having whether we like it or not to accommodate that
[22:32.840 --> 22:40.720]  necessity of realizing other people are going to be as powerful and influential as we are
[22:40.720 --> 22:45.840]  in some aspects of life not militarily we'll stay preeminent there for a long time but
[22:45.840 --> 22:51.880]  I think economically China will soon you know succeed the United States is the number one
[22:51.880 --> 22:59.760]  economic power in the world that's not I think influence in politics ladies and gentlemen
[22:59.760 --> 23:06.440]  let's be clear do you know what an egg sack is what a different species have it whenever
[23:06.440 --> 23:13.320]  the zygote's growing before it fully attaches and creates a placenta to its mother it lives
[23:13.320 --> 23:22.360]  off of the yolk sack and the United States created the UN created globalism propped up
[23:22.360 --> 23:30.920]  China when 95% of their population was farmers and they couldn't produce a pot to pee in and
[23:30.920 --> 23:36.720]  the globalist moved over there put the totalitarianism in that was centralized under them built
[23:36.720 --> 23:44.680]  up China built up Mexico built up India that's globalism at the higher levels they tell you
[23:44.680 --> 23:47.920]  well we got to have a global government we got to take America's wealth and build the
[23:47.920 --> 23:53.440]  rest of the world but that's a lie too because we go to Mexico or China or India on average
[23:53.440 --> 24:01.760]  people are worse often they were when they were agrarian and self-sufficient and happy
[24:01.760 --> 24:08.760]  so this is the world in the hands of the globalist in their own words not what they put out on
[24:08.760 --> 24:14.920]  TV but in their textbooks in their battle plans why do you think Jimmy Carter signed
[24:14.920 --> 24:22.920]  the deal that took until 2000 to get done to transfer the Panama Canal that we built
[24:22.920 --> 24:27.460]  and that Panama didn't want us to give up and that was making the United States billions
[24:27.460 --> 24:36.600]  of dollars a year of profit we just gave it to China because the robber barons have made
[24:36.600 --> 24:42.040]  a deal to carve up American hegemony and power that was gained through ideas and free market
[24:42.040 --> 24:49.520]  and invention and has grafted all of these countries in and their elites in to become
[24:49.520 --> 24:56.800]  powerful off of the United States we are the exec but we're not giving them our blood so
[24:56.800 --> 25:05.040]  they grow and are strong to then trade with us we are putting elites in to duplicate globalism
[25:05.040 --> 25:11.400]  and bring in the one world government so the United States blood and treasure and ideas
[25:11.400 --> 25:15.880]  have been used and then we also take the blame for the military takeovers which are really
[25:15.880 --> 25:21.680]  globalist we fit the bill our sons and daughters die they get put on no treat death list by
[25:21.680 --> 25:28.000]  the Watson computers at IBM it's all cutesy the Chinese are exploited they have suicide
[25:28.000 --> 25:34.760]  nets around the apple factories the foxcom factories suicide nets forced abortions hell
[25:34.760 --> 25:42.120]  on earth and the whole world sinks a giant sucking sound a devaluing that brings me
[25:42.120 --> 25:47.680]  to my next subject I don't know if Ross Perot was a shield I know people that know him they
[25:47.680 --> 25:56.280]  say he's the real deal that said at the key point where he started beating George Herbert
[25:56.280 --> 26:00.880]  Walker Bush and Clinton he said I've been threatened my family's been threatened I'm
[26:00.880 --> 26:08.080]  stepping down I'm out of the race I don't know if that really happened or not I will
[26:08.080 --> 26:11.480]  tell you Donald Trump is one of the biggest contributors ever to Hillary Clinton just
[26:11.480 --> 26:18.480]  type it in Donald Trump is a huge contributor you can say he's just betting on both ponies
[26:18.480 --> 26:24.120]  in a race fine whatever I know that he gets an election gets out of him he's taking all
[26:24.120 --> 26:29.360]  the attention the media is working with him to give him the attention if somebody else
[26:29.360 --> 26:34.720]  was saying this would make him populist and popular they would ignore it so Trump goes
[26:34.720 --> 26:38.640]  and plays the part gets all the attention they have Trump gasms where they mentioned
[26:38.640 --> 26:50.080]  him 239 times in one day on CNN he then basically down the road steps down or runs against Hillary
[26:50.080 --> 26:55.280]  gets the nomination and then drops the ball I believe he's gonna drop the ball and get
[26:55.280 --> 27:02.200]  out earlier and have it be Jeb Bush or somebody else that's an insider and the media will
[27:02.200 --> 27:07.680]  resuscitate him and say oh it really wasn't that bad he was misunderstood mark my words
[27:07.680 --> 27:13.520]  mark my words he's a ringer now that said if you're gonna be a true ringer you've got
[27:13.520 --> 27:17.800]  to lead the opposition to destroy it he's saying we've got a lot of criminals coming
[27:17.800 --> 27:21.480]  in from around the world there people coming in to have their babies for free nobody else
[27:21.480 --> 27:26.840]  does this we're going bankrupt we can't do it totally true totally common sense he then
[27:26.840 --> 27:33.000]  can be discredited because he doesn't even defend himself from past statements he creates
[27:33.000 --> 27:39.200]  a false straw man he says things like we'll take our country back that's what that is
[27:39.200 --> 27:46.960]  what's needed but it's all meant to block out the other 17 contenders I'm not gonna play
[27:46.960 --> 27:52.040]  the two minutes of this but this is just the last 20 seconds or so the last dozen or
[27:52.040 --> 27:59.600]  so Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump of 239 times in 24 hours let's go ahead and
[27:59.600 --> 28:04.160]  play this clip Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump
[28:04.160 --> 28:10.440]  Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump
[28:10.440 --> 28:14.440]  Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald
[28:14.440 --> 28:19.200]  Donald Trump Donald Trump I think Donald Trump should just go on being Donald Trump. We're all having a Trump gas
[28:20.040 --> 28:23.640]  We're all having a Trump gasm because you can then misrepresent
[28:24.380 --> 28:27.380]  what Rand Paul and a few other good republicans stand for
[28:28.080 --> 28:31.300]  You can make a joke out of it by having everybody ridiculing
[28:31.720 --> 28:36.120]  Then the sheep will kind of see that go on. It's ridiculous. He says criminals are coming in
[28:36.120 --> 28:38.520]  That's like singing the ocean has water in it. It's so funny
[28:38.520 --> 28:50.200]  he's just like a new confederate flag basically they can then project on to the Republicans
[28:50.200 --> 28:55.480]  even though the confederate flag was and is a democratic party symbol one of the few honorable

[32:56.360 --> 33:16.360]  hd firearms dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:16.360 --> 33:26.680]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[33:30.200 --> 33:38.680]  well we're in an inevitable relative decline in worldwide influence not because of any fault of
[33:38.680 --> 33:44.840]  ours but it's uh as i said inevitable i think that the combination of china and india and brazil
[33:44.840 --> 33:54.600]  and south africa and other others uh as a increase in economic and and uh cultural influence there
[33:54.600 --> 33:59.720]  you go it's called the death of the west by design they had a professor it's in my stack
[33:59.720 --> 34:07.800]  we're going to get to it in the u.s come out and say that reason and logic is a racist western idea
[34:07.800 --> 34:15.400]  so are you saying illogic and barbarism is a uh eastern idea because i don't agree with that
[34:15.400 --> 34:23.960]  there's a lot of really good uh knowledge and and and and information from uh chinese philosophy
[34:23.960 --> 34:32.360]  indian philosophy zen philosophy confucius but the stuff that that's being pushed now is none of
[34:32.360 --> 34:39.960]  that there is this vitriolic hatred of the west hatred of the renaissance and it's because it's
[34:39.960 --> 34:46.760]  so liberal so to destroy something you must lead it so the fake liberals lead the worldwide
[34:46.760 --> 34:53.240]  liberal movement which is really hardcore anti-human fascism it's inverted
[34:55.080 --> 34:59.880]  and i don't think jimmy carter is a bad person i think he is seriously a useful idiot
[34:59.880 --> 35:05.080]  you know he's got his brother out there selling beer he's out there growing peanuts whatever knock
[35:05.080 --> 35:14.680]  yourself out we're declining no fault of our own oh really globalism 101 by the way he did
[35:14.680 --> 35:19.880]  found the trilateral commission so when i say he's not bad he believes in all this subignant
[35:19.880 --> 35:26.600]  brazilian is super evil i've read his writings um david rockefeller beyond evil they founded it
[35:26.600 --> 35:32.920]  with carter he was their front man and he believed in giving the padamak canal and most of our deep
[35:32.920 --> 35:38.200]  water ports and everything to the china and and and giving our national parks and then the land
[35:38.200 --> 35:44.840]  around it is collateral to the un i mean jimmy carter screwed this country over so bad and he
[35:44.840 --> 35:50.840]  just thinks he's being friendly and nice to china and india when the globalists are exploiting those
[35:50.840 --> 35:58.360]  people on average they're not getting more wealthy they're not getting more successful you don't see
[35:58.360 --> 36:06.200]  cps over in china taking people's kids that are chained up on polls when their parents are at work
[36:07.880 --> 36:12.360]  because they're there to be exploited here they want to find a reason to take your kids because
[36:12.360 --> 36:17.080]  they can then suck you in and get money off of you in the system the point is it's not a level
[36:17.080 --> 36:22.840]  playing field they're making it impossible to operate inside the united states with taxes
[36:22.840 --> 36:25.320]  and regulations and all the things they do
[36:28.760 --> 36:34.280]  and then jimmy carter sits there and says of no fault of our own no it's the fault of globalism
[36:34.280 --> 36:39.640]  which hasn't failed people always go globalism doesn't work it creates poverty it creates tyranny
[36:39.640 --> 36:47.880]  it succeeded there's a war against true freedom because true freedom creates so much success so
[36:47.880 --> 36:54.440]  many inventions so much innovation so much human dignity that it doesn't allow a tiny
[36:54.440 --> 37:02.840]  elite of robber barons to control the paradigm so they are in constant warfare with competition
[37:02.840 --> 37:11.480]  and it was john d rockefeller the first who said type in the quote he said it all the time
[37:11.480 --> 37:15.880]  in newspapers he said it in radio interviews before he died when radio was first invented
[37:15.880 --> 37:22.520]  it he was 99 when he died he said competition is a sin
[37:22.520 --> 37:36.520]  and competition is a sin ultra rich the most powerful people in the world
[37:37.960 --> 37:43.960]  competitions of sin and what do they always push for socialism and communism for the middle
[37:43.960 --> 37:49.640]  class they're exempt offshore what's exempt the un is tax exempt people by the community above the
[37:49.640 --> 37:55.400]  law the vatican diplomatic community tax exempt above the law washington dc diplomatic community
[37:55.400 --> 38:03.320]  tax exempt above the law city of london within london financial district tax exempt diplomatic
[38:03.320 --> 38:10.760]  community above the law should i keep giving you examples of this and i know i harp on this
[38:10.760 --> 38:19.000]  because if we understand that we understand everything you've got a superclass above the law
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.840]  you've got all these filthy rich like obama and the pope lecturing about how evil rich people
[38:26.840 --> 38:32.040]  need to give more you've got warren buffett constantly going i pay less taxes than my secretary
[38:32.040 --> 38:39.640]  that's wrong when he was the biggest recipient of the bailout he personally got like 10 billion
[38:39.640 --> 38:48.760]  his company in the first round 400 plus billion and then you find out he lobbied for tax exemption
[38:48.760 --> 38:54.520]  for himself in the 80s that's even been in the clatchy and other papers george soros is getting
[38:54.520 --> 38:59.640]  sued right now and that they've actually got bills in congress to make him pay something like 10
[38:59.640 --> 39:04.600]  billion in back taxes just type in soros may have to pay 10 billion back taxes because he lobbied
[39:04.600 --> 39:10.680]  to get middle-class taxes raised but that bastard is tax exempt there's one headline
[39:10.680 --> 39:16.120]  buffett champion of bailout is also leading beneficiary you've got this pope you've got
[39:16.120 --> 39:20.280]  obama going to africa saying you can't have cars or air conditioner when he's got the biggest
[39:20.280 --> 39:27.960]  footprint of them all carbon wise it's all but but but they're not hypocrites in the purest sense
[39:27.960 --> 39:35.880]  they're not saying this just because they're hypocrites is what i'm getting at they're doing it cold
[39:35.880 --> 39:45.640]  bloodedly talking down to you because they want you to learn you don't get the new technology you
[39:45.640 --> 39:50.760]  don't get the innovation you don't get the life extension you don't get a level playing field
[39:50.760 --> 39:56.840]  i mean what do you call modern liberalism dodgeball's band tag is banned chases band
[39:56.840 --> 40:03.320]  schools all over the country the feds tell you what you can eat you can't say boy or girl purple
[40:03.320 --> 40:09.160]  penguin because boy or girl is hateful because someone else might not be a boy or girl so all
[40:09.160 --> 40:16.520]  communications are hateful and you can't use them except what is new and prescribed on that very day
[40:16.520 --> 40:22.760]  by state-run media and if you follow the daily download of what's popular and trendy then you'll
[40:22.760 --> 40:29.000]  be in the cool crowd and be brought in to the fold which is to be a total failure and used that's
[40:29.000 --> 40:33.480]  another thing following the system enslaves you you're supposed to go get two degrees you're supposed
[40:33.480 --> 40:38.280]  to wait till you're 40 to try to have kids so you can't you're supposed to do you follow all their
[40:38.280 --> 40:45.320]  ideas eat their gmo that's the thing doing what they say it's not like you join the roman legions
[40:45.320 --> 40:50.920]  and you become powerful and rich if you can live 10 years you join the new world order and get screwed
[40:50.920 --> 40:58.440]  over it but psychologically you are an empowered group and when you watch tv it talks about your
[40:58.440 --> 41:04.760]  group having power so even though you don't have power you imagine you have power to go into a
[41:05.880 --> 41:15.880]  swap meet and to find people selling war memorabilia and you find a confederate flag or a swastika and
[41:15.880 --> 41:22.120]  you urinate on yourself in pleasure because now you can be somebody and and and and this is something
[41:22.120 --> 41:28.520]  you know and you can squawk and call the police to have them arrested even though it's not illegal
[41:28.520 --> 41:34.040]  you want to live in a totalitarianism because you could point at the symbol of something
[41:34.040 --> 41:43.560]  you say was totalitarian i mean i see the reports people want to walk into museums and freak out
[41:43.560 --> 41:50.680]  in fact the word is museums are pulling swastikas out because the patrons are so stupid they walk
[41:50.680 --> 41:56.840]  into the say the pacific war museum i was told this by one of their people off record a listener
[41:56.840 --> 42:01.400]  they said man you're right about political correctness he goes you know they're this is mainly
[42:01.400 --> 42:05.480]  about pacific war but there were a couple swastika flags back there and people were complaining
[42:07.880 --> 42:12.760]  i mean it's full of japanese it's incredible one of the best museums i've ever seen right
[42:12.760 --> 42:17.720]  in the middle of nowhere outside austin it's a george herbert walker pacific war museum
[42:18.600 --> 42:26.840]  but the point is they they i was told they quietly are pulling swastikas out of there because
[42:26.840 --> 42:34.680]  people go to world war two museum and they can't handle seeing it i mean i told you they're talking
[42:34.680 --> 42:41.560]  about pulling swastikas and hitler out of textbooks because it's i mean this is book burning this is

[47:50.360 --> 47:55.000]  here's the headline new york times it's up on drudgereport.com we've got it linked on info
[47:55.000 --> 48:05.560]  wars.com as well eurozone leaders met on greece after finance ministers hit impasse and it says
[48:05.560 --> 48:14.680]  they're discussing selling off greek assets for a new bailout which they admit won't even get
[48:14.680 --> 48:23.720]  them bailed out of debt and i have another article here where they go why is the only country to
[48:23.720 --> 48:29.080]  ever get out of its debt island well they told island they owed five and a half billion dollars
[48:29.080 --> 48:37.000]  six years ago we had members their parliament on like vergita jones dotier and others they arrested
[48:37.000 --> 48:42.200]  the finance minister and they went in and got the files and 93 percent of the debt was owed
[48:42.200 --> 48:47.400]  by british and us and european banks that they had gotten the finance ministry to sign on to
[48:48.600 --> 48:53.080]  in bailouts and that's why we're told we're one of the biggest debtors in the world is mainly
[48:53.080 --> 48:59.320]  uh we've signed on to the derivatives of uh international banks that sold mortgages and other
[49:00.040 --> 49:05.640]  uh fraudulent instruments over and over again oh you can sell a mortgage once you can't sell it
[49:05.640 --> 49:14.280]  five times or 30 times or 56 times that's some work and when you read deeper uh golden sacks
[49:14.280 --> 49:24.920]  and others are now being sued for fudging the debt manipulating and lying so that the greek
[49:26.680 --> 49:29.560]  budgetary program could be accepted for entrance into the e you
[49:32.360 --> 49:36.200]  greek debt crisis london independent goldman sacks could be sued though they are being sued
[49:36.200 --> 49:42.600]  for helping hide debts when it joined the euro and of course who then gets to administer all this
[49:42.600 --> 49:48.920]  but goldman sacks and jp morgan and again i'm not seeing if you work at jp morgan you're a bad
[49:48.920 --> 49:53.240]  person or if you work at goldman sacks or even bad they have a lot of legitimate business operations
[49:53.960 --> 49:56.440]  but at the top these are two of the biggest banks in the world
[49:58.280 --> 50:01.800]  goldman sacks being a big brokerage but it's still a bank loans to governments
[50:04.760 --> 50:10.280]  these are the people that are financing the open borders the globalism getting our guns
[50:10.280 --> 50:14.920]  they want a domesticated world they can control so when everything collapses they're the last
[50:14.920 --> 50:19.800]  people standing there was a jp morgan email that we got a few months ago became national news
[50:20.520 --> 50:21.480]  that was sent out
[50:24.280 --> 50:30.360]  by the head of jp morgan biggest bank in the world saying the end game is here the dark
[50:30.360 --> 50:35.560]  collapse that's coming will be used and we will be on top but prepare yourselves this is the moment
[50:35.560 --> 50:42.680]  of truth i mean you can pull up the full letter and when jp morgan got contacted they said yeah
[50:42.680 --> 50:50.360]  that's our email there's the headline jp morgan chase ceo economic crisis inevitable there will
[50:50.360 --> 50:55.720]  be another crisis and this impact will be felt by the financial markets he wrote he scrolled down
[50:55.720 --> 51:00.680]  there's all the other bizarre cryptic statements about the end game has arrived and the rest of it
[51:00.680 --> 51:10.200]  and as i've been telling you before all this broke loose we are now past the event horizon
[51:11.400 --> 51:16.040]  i want to open the phones up in the second hour for first time callers haven't done that in about
[51:16.040 --> 51:20.600]  a week or two first time callers at the first round all i ask is you have a good phone and
[51:20.600 --> 51:24.600]  have a point you want to make and we'd love to hear from you on any of the issues i've raised
[51:24.600 --> 51:30.760]  the political correctness being a total tyranny by design the greek situation donald trump
[51:33.080 --> 51:37.400]  all these other issues we've raised how big a year do you think this is going to be
[51:38.040 --> 51:44.200]  in the next year do you think the global meltdown is going to intensify we've been predicting it's
[51:44.200 --> 51:50.040]  coming it's now here how bad will it get will americans living in their bubble get politically
[51:50.040 --> 51:56.040]  involved because we've been the center of funding and supporting the world government while the media
[51:56.040 --> 52:00.360]  talked to us like we were three years old said none of that exists pumpkin there's no plan for
[52:00.360 --> 52:04.120]  planetary government with carbon taxes and the pope comes out and calls for it a month ago
[52:05.240 --> 52:09.800]  member just seven years ago when in game came out some were putting in there right after he
[52:09.800 --> 52:14.760]  said it he just said it as the film was almost done i added al gore at the end going in congress
[52:15.880 --> 52:19.480]  they go well this is just a plan for you to have carbon taxes and tax everything by the
[52:19.480 --> 52:24.760]  mile and you're part of a company that will make the money and al gore goes yes and the
[52:24.760 --> 52:28.360]  moon landing never happened there is no carbon taxes there's nothing to do with that
[52:30.600 --> 52:34.600]  when the congressman went by being you own the company your lobbying al gore goes
[52:34.600 --> 52:37.000]  preposterous i mean i could play the club
[52:39.880 --> 52:45.560]  just like whenever ross pro was going giant second sound larry king you do this like
[52:45.560 --> 52:50.280]  canadians were making 40 an hour and within a couple years them opening up their board
[52:50.280 --> 52:55.880]  and free trade with us they were making 20 an hour now now larry that's because we were making 15
[52:57.560 --> 53:01.160]  to 20 we open up mexico it's not going to even help their workers
[53:02.600 --> 53:07.000]  you're going to hear a giant second sound we're going to go from 20 to 15 down to about 10 and
[53:07.000 --> 53:11.160]  then the auto industry is going to leave larry and then it's going to leave mexico to china or india
[53:11.160 --> 53:16.120]  and then nexico is going to collapse and then where are they going to go they're going to come
[53:16.120 --> 53:21.480]  here larry and drive down wages even more larry listen i've made personally in my own life 10
[53:21.480 --> 53:26.280]  million dollars i mean i know how business works here al gore would get up there and go
[53:27.000 --> 53:35.880]  with his nely self his dandy self would go i think it's uh he's just gross man he sits there and goes
[53:35.880 --> 53:43.000]  this now that's ridiculous conspiracy theory this is a good deal larry and i had to sit there and
[53:43.000 --> 53:53.080]  watch that lying piece of trash it's an end game towards the end say that he's not involved in
[53:53.080 --> 53:57.160]  carbon taxes or carbon trading when he's one of the main owners of it worldwide
[53:57.160 --> 54:10.280]  so the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539 877-789-2539 different number on sunday than the
[54:10.280 --> 54:18.280]  weekday show 877-789 alex i'd love to hear from you but but speaking of political correctness
[54:18.280 --> 54:22.680]  for you any further i was just thinking and i'm actually going to do a white house petition tomorrow
[54:22.680 --> 54:29.720]  and i'm going to get serious about this if we need to ban museums having nazi flags or
[54:29.720 --> 54:34.120]  or confederate flags they mix together with it wrongly uh and if they're going to try to go
[54:34.120 --> 54:39.480]  into gun shows where people are just shelling warm warm memorabilia you know the more the better
[54:39.480 --> 54:46.440]  they'll have them from hundreds of different armies i think we should call for the ban of
[54:46.440 --> 54:53.960]  raiders the lost ark and every other film that shows swastikas because it's just a hate symbol
[54:53.960 --> 55:01.080]  and if you're showing it you're promoting it and raiders the lost ark shows hundreds of swastikas
[55:01.640 --> 55:08.280]  on the backs of planes uh on the sides of crates uh everywhere and it's it's hateful
[55:08.280 --> 55:16.760]  and and when people see these the that's the headline they begin to vomit they begin to hyperventilate um
[55:16.760 --> 55:23.400]  i want it banned right now okay i mean i really gotta wonder about steven spielberg now because
[55:23.400 --> 55:29.160]  if you display these you must be for it and he's got nazis marching with them and all i know is
[55:29.160 --> 55:42.280]  i'm scared and i'm offended right now meanwhile the euro was a nazi program plan and now germany's
[55:42.280 --> 55:46.440]  corrupt elite that sucked their own taxpayers dry propping up the euro just like america props
[55:46.440 --> 55:52.760]  up the global government germany's propping it up while it collapses has now taken over greece and
[55:52.760 --> 55:59.800]  is giving them debts that aren't theirs and greek people now face six months of cash controls the
[55:59.800 --> 56:08.200]  sunday times is reporting then coming up leak documents show fbi dea and army can control
[56:08.200 --> 56:13.240]  your computer technology is so invasive even the dea had reservations about purchasing it and what
[56:13.240 --> 56:17.320]  it allows them to do is put stuff on your computer that's really what it is under so the sneak and
[56:17.320 --> 56:23.240]  peak provision of the patriot act some good news qualmo agrees to suspend background checks for
[56:23.240 --> 56:27.480]  ammo there was no law he was just doing background checks if you try to buy ammo
[56:29.160 --> 56:33.080]  it was part of the safe fact that they tried to federally pass but didn't work
[56:33.640 --> 56:38.040]  new york governor andrew qualmo has agreed to suspend the proposed requiring background checks
[56:38.040 --> 56:43.000]  for ammunition cells in the state in the face of republican opposition and technical difficulties
[56:43.000 --> 56:50.120]  of course it turns out that all these shooters got their guns illegally including the guy at the
[56:50.120 --> 56:56.840]  black church so we're going to go over all of that coming up antidepressants use rising among
[56:56.840 --> 57:03.080]  teens and young adults of course it causes psychotic breaks in a minority of people so cops
[57:03.080 --> 57:06.760]  when somebody just randomly comes up to shoot you in the head or shoot somebody else just know
[57:06.760 --> 57:13.640]  it's not the gun you know they're going to be on psychotropic since they always are about 99%
[57:13.640 --> 57:18.360]  of the time i mean i i say that because i mean we haven't found a case yet we're just a senseless
[57:18.360 --> 57:24.200]  robot killing wasn't from these drugs but i'm sure they exist we'll just say 99% to be safe

[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:47.880]  through your day but then all of a sudden you start looking at all the data especially my
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:55.080]  listening show and it's kind of kind of uh eye opening to say the least well yeah i mean how
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.960]  twilight zone is it just interrupt that all over the country they've been tagged and dodgeball
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:05.720]  and now they're telling children boy and girl is a hateful word you're a purple penguin i mean this
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:11.480]  is something out of a hallucination of a crackhead but i mean we're it's because we follow the
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:18.600]  orders we follow the cultural directives of a bunch of sick freaks go ahead sorry no no you're
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:23.320]  you're right and and you know one of the same famous quotes just listen to your show now i've
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:29.720]  become much more um history minded and just learning some different things about history
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:35.560]  one of my favorite quotes is edmund burke um all that is necessary to try and be able is for good
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:44.920]  men do nothing you know when you go back to raiden um what was it um but trust but verify so it's
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:50.360]  all these things that's there what our original founder said in the document and that's exactly
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:55.800]  what they're doing the global government they're just trying to make everything inverted upside
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:00.760]  down and and it's funny i'll just just a brief comment i'll go out i'm in like when i wake up
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:05.720]  now i'm in full-time usa one mode just like the sticker would be on the chivelli you know
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:10.120]  so i'll just just don't want to say direct hey what do you what do you think about this country
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:16.600]  what do you think about our leaders and either the lights on as as you bring up with your show
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.960]  these people see this tyranny or they don't and more and more other people on the left side of
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:27.080]  the paradigm with the right either see it they don't well that's right and they try to put us
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:31.800]  in groups and i talk about transcending the left right paradigm but at a moment when the globalists
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:37.080]  win their propaganda war it becomes a left right paradigm whereas even though the republican leadership
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:44.280]  are bad people and sell us out to tpp abortion obama care it is the conservatives and libertarians
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:50.440]  that at least know how to tie their shoelaces and at least are for private property family rights
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:57.560]  the right to self-defense in common sense and democrats have become a bizarro cult uh but
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.760]  i'm glad you mentioned this part about you're either in one camp or the other and what we have
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:08.840]  is a secession of individuals people have pulled out of the system they're pulling out more and more
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:14.840]  and all the globalists have done is by tripling down their propaganda they forced a lot of people
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:21.800]  who would have trusted in the system because they thought overall it was good to break with it and i
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:28.760]  don't think i know the globalists have miscalculated in long term they will fail there's going to be a
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:36.120]  major backlash to what they've done the problem is if they get their way they may irrevocably
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:41.480]  damage the planet have a giant nuclear war who knows they've got to be stopped because they're
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:48.440]  so dangerous so conventionally they're failing if you look at the scheme of history but they're not
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:54.760]  failing because they might blow the earth up you see where i'm coming from here yeah and um
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:01.720]  and i'm i'm blanking on the term right now but it's um not an integral thinking but people
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:07.640]  have lost the art of thinking critical critical thank you critical thinking and it was i think
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:12.920]  i heard on your show but a few months ago there was a discussion with a leading professor or
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:18.040]  someone and that's what this particular person said there's a lack of critical thinking and
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:23.000]  that's what the corporations do that's what the government does that what our media and people
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.440]  should be critical when obama says raising the debt doesn't raise our debt again that's an inversion
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.160]  and you and i that just makes us get sick on our stomach or laugh young people growing up that have
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:39.000]  accepted this they're growing up an upside down world imagine how disoriented they are i mean
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.440]  there's no wonder god bless you great call jeff from noxville tennessee great great uh city there
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:49.880]  we got two affiliates in that area we're gonna come back and go to pete matt paul steve and many

[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:17.880]  literally hundreds of products from the info wars lifeline because they are not of the very
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:23.880]  highest quality or because they're not 100 organic or because they don't ask all of the strictest
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.920]  toxicology tests there are that we have listed at info wars life dot com whether it's survival
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:35.800]  shield nascent iodine or dna force super male vitality super female vitality lung cleanse
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:42.600]  fluoride shield oxy powder i believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:47.880]  done the thousands of other customers that have visited info wars life dot com and believed in us
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:54.520]  and tried the products folks check out info wars life dot com today and the entire line of groundbreaking
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:06:00.680]  cutting edge hardcore products
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:22.200]  this is our land these are our people the workers the strivers the builders
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.080]  these are
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:36.520]  who are they they are the dark armies the dark murdering armies was only on
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:46.440]  the answer to 1984 is 1776
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:57.320]  you're listening to the alex jimmy show
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:08.200]  so
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:17.160]  on the friday 11 a.m to 2 p.m central i'm alive we're back sundays live it is the 12th day on
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:21.720]  this sunday we are transmitting across the globe i have made the decision to go to europe
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:28.360]  the financial meltdown that will undoubtedly spread to italy and spain and portugal is under
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:34.680]  way i'm intending to go to greece i'm intending to go to italy intending to go to spain and i'm
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:39.720]  going to be setting that up uh the next few days and announcing when i'm going but it's important
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:44.440]  enough that i'm going to be broadcasting from there and reporting live from the middle of it
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:53.080]  because this is all a microcosm of what we face the latest greek exit drama noting a default is
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:08:00.520]  imminent the only country to effectively ameliorate a debt crisis that was similar has been iceland
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:08.360]  all market bubbles must return to their inception point this from investment watch we're going to
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:16.680]  be going over harry s dense article uh coming up antidepressant use among teens and young adults
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:22.680]  skyrocks the highest level ever leak documents show fpid an army can control your computer with
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:30.440]  the stroke of a key maryland state song targeted for having confederate sympathies i read the
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:35.880]  maryland state song as part of the north and was part of the victorious party in this in the civil
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:42.120]  war and i read it and can't find any southern sympathies but again we live in a country where
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:46.840]  they're banning the word boy and girl husband and wife in california and public schools because
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:50.760]  it's hurtful to those that aren't boys or girls or don't have a husband and wife
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:57.160]  because if you can do that you can do anything so i would expect them to ban that it's actually
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:04.680]  harkening back to 1776 but i guess that does talk about fighting government tyranny and death spots so
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:09.880]  so that's alarming the n double acp so they want that band and i'm sure they'll get what they want
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:13.880]  because the establishment wants to get it's all used to things being banned because if you're a
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:19.560]  bunch of offshore banks looting this country and the rest of the world you use weaponized media to
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:24.040]  get everybody fighting with each other where seattle remember i use this as my best example
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:29.560]  three years ago put out a memo saying do not say in any memos we're having a brown paper bag lunch
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:33.240]  meaning take your lunch to this meeting or we're not going to have food serve when you're having
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:37.720]  a seminar or something or when you're going to be providing for two dollars they had examples in the
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:44.520]  memo a selling don't say brown paper bag because that's hateful no one had ever said brown paper
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:49.560]  bag meant racism that means just the classic brown paper bag but now they're having memos out that's
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:55.560]  why i joked about this on thursday saying uh you know don't talk in media about crushing the blacks
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:10:00.600]  because that's a term used to do with black people when you crush blacks to make them deeper dark
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:07.000]  uh in a video system i'm not an engineer but that's basically how it works that's hateful
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:16.520]  putting your elbows on a dark table is a sign of racism uh it it's everywhere in fact telling
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:23.160]  a minority they've done a good job according to the university of wisconsin uh just saying good
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:29.880]  job not good job you're black or good job you're just just good job you just shake and fear like
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:35.240]  the mtv show has come out and said and go i don't know what to do i just am bad i well and the
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:40.520]  government goes you do what we say exactly and we won't call you that is that okay yes please don't
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:50.280]  call me that i'm a 15 year old zit face white kid fully killed and i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.080]  good take your vaccine support obama care turn your guns in
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:00.200]  and while they're running black op operations murdering people all over the world new york
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:05.560]  times it makes they go into african villages and kill everybody to make it a u n biosphere zone
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:09.720]  oh wait but that doesn't matter they killed them or they abort half the black people
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:15.640]  or all the rest of it i just said black ops oh my gosh that doesn't mean secret in the dark it
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:23.480]  means i was being racist oh i'm sorry because people aren't literate on facts or history
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:30.200]  they just know how to be offended now there's even talk about offended by short haircuts
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:35.560]  that's a sign of racism or or i've seen news articles is it racist when a white guy's got
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:44.920]  a shaved head obviously and now the daily caller reason itself is a white male construct and racist
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:54.120]  you see it's an overthrow of common sense two plus two equals five people have to learn i'm
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:12:00.920]  not saying all this as a colloquialism i'm not saying this is rhetoric i'm not saying this to
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:07.960]  make a point as hyperbole this is scientific takeover they've decided to go with the most
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:13.960]  hardcore over the top system and it's working well so that's coming up we're gonna go to break
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:18.040]  and come back go to your calls but i thought i would mention this as i see these articles every
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.600]  day and i decided i usually ignore them because i saw it from one paradigm that it just causes
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:26.840]  more racial division but actually it doesn't there's an attempt to whip all whites into a
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:32.760]  self-loathing guilt to support financing killing black people and those of color all over the world
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:39.560]  and globalist imperialism on our dime uh and while breeding incredible hatred of whites
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:47.160]  with democratic party politics to forge minorities into a new race cult as they become the minority
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:51.720]  in the next five years nationwide next five years already the majority in most states
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:58.520]  so now whites wouldn't be racist so the democrats had to stop being the clan party
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:03.400]  and so they flipped to the new make the minorities based on race
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.840]  sung a kumbaya song to then double cross and come in and turn them into a race cult
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:15.160]  so mtv's white people trailer under fire promoting white shame stirs debate and grab
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:20.600]  spotlight exactly what filmmaker wants oh who wrote that article new york daily news let's
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:24.680]  make fun of drudge after he linked our article about it on tuesday and it was the number one
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:29.800]  new story according to uh major metrics like google analytics in the country that's right we had
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:38.360]  six million readers of that story in two days so exactly what we want you got defeated you got
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:43.000]  exposed as an illegal alien trying to create division and race baiting probably for the
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.520]  ford foundation you got exposed for what you did and you put out tweets saying i don't want to shame
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.560]  white people when in earlier tweets you said you did but now you claim it's exactly what you wanted
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:14:00.040]  you're sick you've jumped the shark so i'm gonna cover this abc seven exclusive woman
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:07.800]  attack by group near u campus with kids in car and we have the kids as witnesses in the
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:12.040]  windows knocked out they were able to get away and you know what i say she was white
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:18.920]  she should have been executed hung up by her feet right there i mean listen whites are inherently
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:26.680]  evil everything bad is he is white and i apologize i i i really do for other white
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:32.120]  inventions not just reason as if that's a fraud by the way reason is not a white invention
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:39.000]  there's similar reason in every other philosophy chinese philosophy hindu philosophy african
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:46.360]  parables i mean that is just a load of crap but coming up i'll play the white people trailer
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:52.680]  again that's exactly what they want yeah right exactly what you want now you want to sit there
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:57.560]  and guilt the little mtv kids who have parents dumb enough to set their children in front of
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:02.280]  that weaponized garbage some are redstone up there now six years ago admitting they're
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:08.920]  going to sexualize people under the age of ten targeting children with sex they these have a

[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:22.920]  trying to push a sexual persuasion on him is called pedophilia so when we come back i'm
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:27.400]  going to go to your calls and then in the last segment i'm going to get to the children's
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.680]  testimony of the news about being attacked that was a lesson for them and i bet they'll
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.920]  get even more guilty and apologize for their whiteness that they couldn't be all be
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.920]  reginald denny when a group of racist black people tried to beat did beat their windows out
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:45.640]  and smash their car wanted to drag them out and beat their brains out in fact reginald denny

[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:40.440]  down then coming up more and more racial attacks on whites and the media tries to cover it up
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:46.760]  and then don't worry the financial times of london has the headline cheer up the post human
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:52.360]  era is dawning the globals are being very public now about their plans you might have heard about
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:58.280]  that in my film end game blueprint for global enslavement where i believe i coined the term
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:06.520]  post human error or what i call the end of man i'm not bragging i just i've read the globalist
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:12.600]  books they're just now going public with it nasa craft discovers heart shape on pluto during fly
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:18.200]  by i'll get into that i mentioned this anti psychotic use rising among teens and young adults
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:24.520]  a daily mail as top scientists saying they believe a global ice age is now coming uh that's actually
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:30.520]  true probably i mean there's no telling what the sun but if you follow cycles let's just say
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:35.480]  i wish they'd have put out more carbon dioxide don't you the problem is it doesn't really
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:43.080]  heat the earth uh some evidence shows oxygen does also a trash cache but more plants would be a good
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:48.520]  thing for the earth and more carbon dioxide does that but hey it's okay we're not hyping global
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:54.840]  government now to save us from global warming it's now climate change so any change is our fault
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:22:01.080]  and we should pay an indulgence to the pope uh i used to make a joke that's like a in medieval times
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:05.800]  you know you'd want to get your family out of purgatory whatever you you give the pope some money
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:10.120]  there's an indulgence and then i've always called carbon taxes and indulgence people drive around
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:16.200]  austin with stickers saying my car is offset i buy these carbon credits al gorgon fly around in
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:21.880]  jumbo jets uh but now it's an actual carbon indulgence the vatican wants to push so okay
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:26.680]  sounds sounds good uh let's go to matt in maryland matt you're on the air welcome
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:33.400]  him hey uh thanks a lot for taking my call i've been a prison planet uh member for a long time
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:38.840]  and i keep giving my information out to new people trying to get them to kind of unplug from the
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:43.560]  matrix but it gets really hard when y'all keep comparing gay marriage to pedophilia and beefy
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:49.320]  ality i mean gay gay people getting married are not interested in raping children or animals
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:54.280]  taking consent from rights from children their parents and animals is a major problem but it's
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:23:00.280]  not it's a separate issue from letting adults engage in a contract and the confederate flag
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:05.560]  issue too i mean it's a it's a it's a battle that's been lost in more ways than one i feel like
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:10.760]  you know if you keep fighting this issue when you know i say let people let wave the flag
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:14.520]  because it tells me i don't want to have anything to do with them truly hard to bring
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:19.800]  gays and minorities into the fight when when you keep fighting battles that are going to ostracize
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:24.440]  the nature i mean i'm not saying this is a seminar call but it sounds like one well i'm going to keep
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:28.120]  you there because you disagree matt and i held you longer gone to you earlier if i know you
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:33.320]  disagree with me because i like people that disagree legitimately so here's the deal you've
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:39.800]  built a straw man i've never had the confederate flag i see the civil war as a failure of this
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:45.480]  country we were manipulated into it by british intelligence uh the flag was never about slavery
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:51.720]  that's a fact i will not adopt the mental illness that it was about slavery and that it's a flag of
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:58.840]  hate because some crazy person on drugs made it that or why supremacist use it uh okay that's a
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:04.120]  danger where somebody uses a symbol i mean quite frankly i said ban the american flag before farrakhan
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:09.000]  said it not because it's a bad flag but it's had more slaves on it than that it's this historical
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:16.280]  ignorance it's the totalitarian left wanting to be able to remove terms wanting to be able to control
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:21.400]  language okay so you say let them fly it then i know who i don't want to be around mainly
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:27.080]  as people saying i'm a rebel i'm cool my truck's big i don't care what you think about me okay that's
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:32.200]  what the flags are motorcycle gangs you'll see like mexican motorcycle gangs with it on i mean it's
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:39.640]  it's saying fkw we do whatever we want that's what it symbolizes is rebellion in the military it's
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:47.240]  been respected because it was one of the most powerful rebel forces ever seen uh the second
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:51.960]  toughest group would be the colonial forces but hands down military historians say the southern
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:57.480]  forces were the most hard fighting non-stop probably some of the first examples of special
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:02.840]  forces okay let's move past that that's why the u.s military loves the confederacy nothing to do with
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:09.400]  black people i will assure you so i'm not defending it i'm defending reality now let's move on to the
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:14.680]  gay marriage thing i'm a libertarian but if you're a real listener and not somebody with a script
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:19.560]  you would know not hundreds but thousands of times if you listen to my show the first 18 years i
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:25.000]  didn't cover this i don't get into what you do in your bedroom i'm okay i am not in people's bedrooms
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.600]  i am not a Pharisee i'm not a hypocrite it i my world does not revolve around sex either
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:36.520]  and so i'm sick of it it's a football issue it's not a federal issue it's a distraction
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:42.360]  to be passed back and forth now the truth is there is a move at the un there is a move to
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:48.920]  sexualize children some of the redstone has said that and it's nobody's business to be trying to
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:54.520]  target children with heather has two mommies or you can't say boy or girl because somebody may not
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:26:02.520]  identify as that that is space cult suicide cult exterminism craziness the eugenics transhumanist
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:10.120]  cult wants to confuse the general species ahead of rendering us down and removing us the decision
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:16.920]  has been made cheer up the post human era is dawning the plan is an asexual humanoid even if
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:23.880]  they decide to keep us around stated in hundreds of textbooks so understand when i expose estrogen
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:31.160]  mimickers feminizing men giving women cancer because it super feminizes them that's not because
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:37.000]  i'm saying all gay people in history again using the word homosexuals heterosexuals trying to
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.800]  crime use the scientific term that all homosexuals see i'm bowing to be nice oh i'll say gay i don't
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:46.360]  care what the name is people who like the same sex but then i submit and start using your first
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:53.160]  word now i must use all your words and now i'm a computer that takes your culture your download
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:27:01.160]  your philosophy and then i become a slave when i am undefinable other than i want human liberty
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:07.240]  so that's what i stand for on the whole issue not what you claimed i did you have about a
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:13.000]  two minute response okay i hear you those are terrible things going on in the world
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:19.080]  but to say that the people who are in favor of gay marriage are also looking to rape children
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:25.720]  and animals that's just the taking consent animals and children cannot consent people
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:29.880]  government should have no right over what parents can do with their children i agree with that
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:34.520]  but that doesn't mean the two people shouldn't be allowed to engage in the contract when the
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:39.560]  government is already regulating that more strongman i didn't say to that there is moves
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:44.920]  to make people pay to have arms and legs chopped up chopped off transabled but listen i don't want
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:50.840]  to have to pay for people sex changes it's not because i care i do not care i get it some people
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:56.360]  want to be a woman or okay i get it the point is is that i shouldn't have to pay for it
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:03.720]  i agree alex i agree we shouldn't pay for that but those aren't issues i i'm sorry but your
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:09.560]  the show is so much better when you leave those issues the tmz and mtv those issues are just
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:15.000]  pop they're not what's really going on but i can't send my kids anywhere where they're not
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:21.080]  taught basically that men are bad it it takes more responsibility for adults to have children
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:26.040]  these days but you can't you have to accept that the world is going to have these things now
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:30.040]  you just you just got it work hard but you're not you're not listening to me i i don't even
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:36.360]  i do accept it i'm not even thinking about it you understand that i am not judging people
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:43.800]  or attacking them i do not want my children told about heterosex homosex or anything else
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:51.880]  i don't want them taught political ideologies i want them taught basic science and how to learn
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:57.320]  and how to catch the spark of creativity i want to be their parent not the state we'll be back with
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:05.320]  more calls a new mtv show is publicly shaming white people for what they've done in america
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:11.560]  no this is not a joke it is a huge exercise in white guilt tripping for public consumption
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:16.600]  the documentary white people shows young americans crying over their white privilege
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:22.600]  and expressing angst about how they are desperate not to appeal racist or offend people white people
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:28.680]  is hosted by journalist jose antonio vargas an illegal immigrant and amnesty activist vargas
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:34.120]  also talks to young native americans who feel that european settlers did not save the country
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:40.120]  rather they invaded and took now while that might be true the teenagers featured in the show
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:45.560]  were born centuries after this took place yet they are being asked to shoulder the burden
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:50.840]  and share their white guilt the show is already being widely criticized on youtube with one person
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:56.520]  writing i'm black even i know this show is straight up racist watch the trailer for white

[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:58.520]  everything else that comes after that that's what being conquered is cheer up the post human era is
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:04.840]  dawning artificial minds will not be confined to the planet on which we have evolved we're going to
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:10.920]  get to that coming up so fast for the expenses of space and time that fall within an astronomer's
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:16.040]  gaze that people in my profession are mindful not only of our moment in history but also of our
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:23.080]  place in the wider cosmos we wonder whether there is life elsewhere some of us even search for it
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:28.920]  people will not be the culmination of evolution oh we are near the dawn of a post human future
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:33.560]  that could be just as prolonged as the billions of years of Darwinism selected that preceded
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:38.440]  humanity's emergence you read this article you understand their mindset see we're done we were
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:43.640]  ugly we were nothing those that accept it were better than us they transcended humanity
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:49.480]  and just accepted that the evolution was emerged with machines and they get into that
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:56.360]  meanwhile we're debating confederate flags and sex changes but i have to because the public only
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:03.080]  wants to talk about that and i have to reach in to the matrix with that and say i will discuss

[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.160]  laws others regardless of scenarios has two characteristics that just goes into the fact
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:19.720]  that it's foregone and this will just be dealt with i'm gonna cover this tomorrow i want to go to
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:30.680]  your calls let's uh right now though go to paul in california you're on the air thanks for holding
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:39.400]  yes i'm doing well paul in california how are you today i'm fine i was just uh thinking
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:48.200]  that this uh hate stuff as far as the confederacy and the nazi flag um is an attack on history
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:55.400]  and yes an attack on reason an attack on facts an attack on symbols an attack on language an
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:01.240]  attack on communication it is a new dark age where people can't tie their shoelaces but they can get
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:07.640]  offended at brown paper bags go ahead i'm sorry yeah well this uh christianity they're probably
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:16.440]  going to turn against muslim or islam and communist uh religionless society well that's the albert
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:20.200]  pike plan you're right but there's one thing the left one attack islam mutilating women
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:24.120]  bags on the heads radicalism that's beautiful i mean they smoke hookers i mean this is really
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:31.320]  stylish and and radical um but but but men and the west that empowered women we're bad
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:36.040]  because the truth is we're the source of real liberalism that threatens the hijackers and the
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:41.560]  counterfeits of liberalism you see that's why they have to destroy the west because it's based in
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:48.120]  freedom it's had its own problems but per capita and if they can remove that and dumb down the ideas
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:54.680]  that came out of the west then they've won you see what i'm saying yeah i do oh one more one more
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:39:00.920]  question how do i find an affiliate in the san francisco bay area that has you on the radio
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:08.840]  let me ask you a question are you a rhino phob i hope not well that's because if you don't want
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:15.880]  to pay for me to have a nose job you're a bigot against my big nose can i send you a bill if i
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:20.040]  wanted a nose job i bet it cost ten thousand dollars i actually like my nose but hypothetically
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:25.080]  if i wanted to get rid of my snout or change it i want you to pay or you're a hate monger are you
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:30.440]  gonna pay for my nose job right now i want you to say you're gonna pay paul well if the government
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:38.840]  chose its friendly or uh a non offensive exactly exactly all right god bless you i appreciate your
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:45.000]  call um let me give you affiliates uh there's ksco is the stronger station that goes into
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.200]  part of san francisco out of santa cruz it covers half of it and then there's another affiliate
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:56.040]  there that's a sister station um that also goes into san francisco you can go to gcmlive.com
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:00.440]  and find some of the affiliate list there uh but we need more affiliates in california we we've only
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:07.560]  got like five affiliates in all of the state of california with 40 million people in it uh let's
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:14.040]  go another caller another paul then we're going to felix uh in hollywood california paul into
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:20.120]  mexico you're on the air go ahead yeah um alex i'm a little nervous here but anyways i want to
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:26.520]  give you a trump analogy and then maybe a solution no one to second lord montan's solution but with
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:33.960]  the analogy or the you say uh you know trumps like the ringer if i was to i drop a ring you know i'd
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:42.040]  put a trump in there knocking out ran paul because they keep the he's a i feel trumps like an inferior
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:48.920]  messenger you know i mean um if they can't attack ran paul directly because he'd clean their clocks
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:53.640]  just like well here's the deal i'm live when they invited you sorry go ahead
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:41:00.040]  oh we're gonna delay it instead they can't go after you directly they have to attack you
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:06.680]  so they can edit your words and whatnot but uh that's basically and then i'd say chris christy
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:11.320]  would be the corner man for uh trump there and then they got all these other organizations the
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:17.400]  fort foundation and whatnot everybody on the outside cheering cheering trump on as he knocks
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:23.720]  out the invisible man which is a rant paul no that's it i mean you've got it that's the plan
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:30.920]  and listen i'm a libertarian if you want to gamble that's your issue uh it's a total joke it's rigged
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:36.520]  just like going to colleges for most i mean it's just a scam it's a it's a schmuck's errand certainly
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:41.480]  college has been great in the past now now it's a fraud you know except if you're gonna be a doctor
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:49.080]  or or an engineer but for most of it it's a waste of money and time but if you look at what donald
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:55.960]  trump is doing he is basically just preparing the way for hillary clinton and blocking out the other
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:42:04.760]  16 uh candidates uh that are there and so uh he's in the lead now uh in major national polls with
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:14.280]  15 percent above uh bush jeb bush 13 ran paul 9.3 so both those guys both bush and trump are ringers
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:19.720]  over that and again i'm a libertarian i didn't finish my statement i'm bad about that i appreciate
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:26.120]  your call gambling if you want to do it is your issue but donald trump owns a bunch of casinos
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:30.920]  donald trump's involved in a bunch of stuff he's basically a front man for some very hardcore people
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:34.920]  and he gives tons of money to the democratic party more to democrats than republicans
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:38.440]  in the last 30 years so you can bet this is all his phonies three dollar bill
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:48.120]  and donald trump i have a high level source uh is uh well let's just say for the name like trump
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:54.360]  they don't come after you with a name like carlioni they do don trump will be back stay with us i'm

[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:41.800]  have calls from new mexico as well but inquiry psychologist group colluded with pentagon cia on
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:47.560]  interrogations well we already knew that but now the national association of psychologists and
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:54.760]  psychiatrists worked on that that's up on info wars.com texas organized operation counter jade
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:59.720]  helm to keep an eye on federal troops and i like what chuck norris said about this he said listen
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:03.960]  that's a military we're worried about it's who's commanding it and anytime we try to investigate
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:08.200]  what the government's doing that should be lauded not attacked when you look into something
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.800]  so nobody thinks it's in a minute takeover the media has been
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:17.880]  misdirecting that it's part of a larger conditioning process new documents stretch
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:23.880]  iris handle out to its third year and of course it's come out that indeed they did target people
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:28.440]  with a plan to put their opposition in jail so let me tell you when the government starts
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:34.120]  trying to put people in jail who've done nothing it has a name it's called hard core tyranny
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:38.120]  hct
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:44.200]  all right let's race through your calls try to get to everybody here i mean we're like
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:49.400]  15 calls i'll try to get six or seven of them uh let's go to tony in mexico you're on the air
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:58.200]  welcome hello alex um i want to talk to you about the latino vote sure go ahead um i just
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:07.080]  wanted uh to let you know that um the the latinos are not all democrats i know that and and they're
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:15.000]  not they're not uh that uh stupid so uh i was thinking that if uh you try to reach out to them
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:21.320]  they're gonna listen because they know something's wrong but they don't know what it is um so you
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:28.200]  know if uh anyone from the rampall uh group is listening they should try to reach out to them
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:34.200]  just let them let them know what the truth is and uh let them know that uh what the democrats
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:40.920]  are saying it's not true because um they you guys uh well the republicans always get misrepresented
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:48.680]  and like they don't get the entire truth out there about what the strategy is sure no that's a great
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:54.120]  point the problem is rampall has tried to reach out the media won't cover it so folks aren't aware of it
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:51:00.760]  and then the republican leadership has been infiltrated so in many cases they're just as bad
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:05.800]  it's the same thing hitting every country it's sophisticated fraud sophisticated corruption
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:09.160]  and then jimmy carter says the u.s is basically declining
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:17.240]  because they've sold out everybody i mean it's globalism globalism hasn't helped china it hasn't
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:22.600]  helped mexico it's enslaved everybody but i i want mexico to be a great country i wish mexico
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:28.280]  was super wealthy and we'd merge with it but that isn't what's happening instead we're all collapsing
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:35.160]  by design because it's easier for these elites to control a bunch of poor dumb down people than to
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:42.200]  basically coexist with a bunch of wealthy powerful people do you see my point yeah i understand but
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:47.080]  i i'm just saying that you know if they if they reach out and that you know and and let them know
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:53.560]  what you know just give them a immigration strategy something that makes sense because you know what
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:52:01.000]  alex mexicans uh most of them they don't want to become a medic american citizens they just want
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.560]  a job maybe i hear you for a couple work for a couple of years and then make some money come back
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:10.520]  to mexico sir i do not blame people for wanting to come up here to get a better job globalism
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:14.120]  destroyed your country i don't blame the individual and i totally agree with what you're saying god
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:19.880]  bless you and i don't say this to to just sit here and be a patron of hispanics and say this
[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:23.880]  when we go out and talk to the general public i don't care if you're from mexico or you're from
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:32.120]  idly or from russia it's just foreigners period know what the declaration of independence was
[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:37.960]  know about the new world order know the government ships and the drugs no no no you they know light
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:43.080]  years more than the average american who just thinks everything's wonderful and nothing can touch him
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:51.080]  i don't care what color an american is on average it's pathetic and so then i ask myself my god
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:56.440]  if mexicans i talk to in mexico and when i'm in california and stuff who are saying hey i'm
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:53:05.720]  here illegally i know what's going on you know i get it i understand i the point is whatever the
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:09.960]  globalists are for i have to be against because i can intellectually show you how it's bad but
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:15.400]  also i just know whatever they're pushing is is is total destruction because they are pure evil
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:22.600]  and and it took me a long time to come to grips with that fact but i wonder
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:27.880]  with the corruption mexico's gone through mexico just devalued his currency in the 70s and 80s
[01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:33.240]  like we're about to do we've already done it just hasn't hit yet and i think about how americans in
[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:39.240]  polls call greece folks lazy and stupid people we talked on the street say they deserve it when
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:45.960]  we're in worse shape than they are so oh mexico failed oh greece is a joke oh ireland's a joke
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:52.760]  oh but we're good we our financial house is just as bad or worse our politicians are just as corrupt
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:59.480]  or worse and when it finally sinks and america finally falls which i don't want to happen but
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:05.640]  when we finally do it is going to be hellish to be in this country and that's why the elites are
[01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:11.480]  leaving they have really screwed this country over and the american people being lazy and thinking
[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:17.560]  we're exceptional just because we say we are we were exceptional now we're exceptionally bad
[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:24.200]  so don't you ever think i'm on some high horse against people in mexico or anywhere else let
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:31.080]  me tell you when it comes down to being a joke this country's it but we have the paradox of
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:37.000]  still so many good people that work so hard and such great roots and so much that was exceptional
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.120]  it's best of times worst of times i love this country so much but my god we've become pathetic
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:46.200]  you know america had a lot of problems but the biggest thing is we would put up being pushed
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:51.800]  around and nobody a foreign country the king of england or santa anna or anybody was going to make
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:57.880]  us a slave and we bowed down and became slaves and we now are a nation of sheep ruled by wolves
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:05.000]  and i cry for this country because when the when we collapse not knowing how to do anything and
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.440]  being lazy and entitled we're done we're done and the globalists just hope to have us all race
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:14.840]  war with each other so they don't get in trouble you're never going to escape this new world order
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:20.120]  which you've done i just ran it for five minutes and ran over all the colors time phoenix and hollywood
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:27.880]  thanks for holding you're on the air hey thank you my fellow american um when i was eight years old
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:35.880]  as a child became a christian uh i'm your age i grew up in the same world you grew up in
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:42.360]  and um you know i try to i've been fighting right alongside you the whole time uh literally step
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:47.720]  for step i went a different path went to the marine corps but anyway the bottom line is the world
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:54.200]  that we grew up in is gone and it frustrates me because i want to battle this and try to find an
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:56:01.720]  end in it and the one thing that jesus reminded me of just before i call was you have victory in me
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:09.240]  and no no i totally get it if we make ourselves good and if we do the right thing or an example
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:17.080]  that's where the war is won what i'm saying is we're seeing bondage becoming named as a right
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:23.880]  an inalienable right bondage homosexuality is bondage sin is bondage drinking too much is bondage
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:29.560]  you know what i'm saying um i agree it's a very destructive lifestyle on average i don't hatefully
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:36.040]  say people are bad but i do defend people's right to say it's bad my point is is that they
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:41.240]  hijack that movement to then bring in a whole another movement that's that that is truly evil
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:46.200]  i'm right there with you bro but what i'm saying is is that jesus christ is coming back
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:51.960]  and the real christians know what's up and the the the the good fight is all we need to do is
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:57.560]  fight the good fight and this is part of it and uh i just want to thank you my fellow american and
