[00:00.000 --> 00:25.320]  Alright, we've got big news coming, Alex Jones is going to be joining us on the other side
[00:25.320 --> 00:32.880]  of this segment, but first what's going on right now to stop Judge Brett Kavanaugh from
[00:32.880 --> 00:37.600]  getting on the Supreme Court is really next level and it needs to be highlighted the hypocrisy
[00:37.600 --> 00:53.960]  and the lies coming out of the Democrat Party, here's John Bowne with his report.
[00:53.960 --> 00:58.040]  The self-righteous Democrats have managed to at the very least stall potential Supreme
[00:58.040 --> 01:02.600]  Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is pushing
[01:02.600 --> 01:08.200]  for an FBI investigation into the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford, claiming that
[01:08.200 --> 01:25.000]  she was sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh at a high school get-together.
[01:25.000 --> 01:38.320]  However, Ford is stalling on answering to testify.
[01:38.320 --> 02:01.360]  While
[02:01.360 --> 02:06.280]  Mark Judge, Kavanaugh's high school friend and only witness to the alleged assault, flatly
[02:06.280 --> 02:11.360]  refuses to testify and even Diane Feinstein, the senator responsible for entering the
[02:11.360 --> 02:29.720]  allegations into the nomination process, has her doubts.
[02:29.720 --> 02:59.240]  In
[02:59.240 --> 03:20.320]  the
[03:20.320 --> 03:26.080]  Currently known as the Congressional Accountability Act, intended to hold congressmen and women
[03:26.080 --> 03:29.040]  accountable to sexual harassment claims.
[03:29.040 --> 03:33.880]  The fine print in the law actually insulates the accused from embarrassment.
[03:33.880 --> 03:40.000]  USA Today reported, to file a complaint, employees must go through a 90-day mandatory dispute
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.360]  resolution process, the first step of which is counseling for the accuser.
[03:45.360 --> 03:48.160]  Yes, you read that correctly.
[03:48.160 --> 03:51.880]  The alleged harasser isn't forced to get counseling.
[03:51.880 --> 03:57.440]  The victim is outside Congress, workers with claims can file a lawsuit in federal court
[03:57.440 --> 04:02.280]  whenever they want, but if they work for Congress, failure to follow these procedures
[04:02.280 --> 04:05.800]  may jeopardize any claims raised under the law.
[04:05.800 --> 04:11.960]  And since 1997, 17 million tax dollars have gone to pay off the victims of Democrats like
[04:11.960 --> 04:17.240]  John Conyers, Al Franken, Robert C. Scott, and Reuben Cahune.
[04:17.240 --> 04:21.880]  Of course, there were Republican predators too, but I mention the Democrats because they
[04:21.880 --> 04:28.000]  are currently using their exclusive legislative power to smear a qualified Supreme Court justice
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.280]  nominee with evidence that even they admit is questionable, while simultaneously presiding
[04:34.280 --> 04:40.400]  over a rigged sexual assault payoff system funding their crimes with our tax dollars
[04:40.400 --> 04:44.440]  and insisting an outright biased FBI do their dirty work.
[04:44.440 --> 04:49.000]  Meanwhile, the House and Senate are in gridlock over updating what should be now known as the
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.120]  Congressional Unaccountability Act.
[04:52.120 --> 04:54.960]  It is hypocrisy at the highest level.
[04:54.960 --> 05:00.680]  John Bowne reporting, Infowars, Tomorrow's News, today.
[05:00.680 --> 05:03.120]  Fueling your body is hard work.
[05:03.120 --> 05:08.800]  That's why we've introduced the Infowars Life Daily Digestive Pack to help you fuel it right.

[05:55.480 --> 06:05.000]  Try the Infowars Life Daily Digestive Pack today.
[06:05.000 --> 06:09.240]  I wanted to start this Wednesday broadcast off today before we end up at Tom Doe's Royer
[06:09.240 --> 06:15.200]  and the rest of the crew for a jam-packed transmission, pointing out that rarely do
[06:15.200 --> 06:22.000]  you see a five-minute piece anywhere on television or listen to it on radio where it's really
[06:22.000 --> 06:26.000]  all out of the park dead on information.
[06:26.000 --> 06:36.800]  I said about my own broadcast, when you hear a five-minute breakdown that really is like
[06:36.800 --> 06:41.760]  a whole in one, you need to recognize it, and Ann Coulter on Tucker Carlson last night
[06:41.760 --> 06:44.400]  was just such a five-minute.
[06:44.400 --> 06:51.080]  She encapsulates everything that's happening with Kavanaugh into five minutes, and the
[06:51.080 --> 06:53.320]  big takeaway is this.
[06:53.320 --> 07:01.640]  You can accuse anybody you want of some unprovable, unverifiable crime in modern America if they're
[07:01.640 --> 07:02.640]  a white male.
[07:02.640 --> 07:09.640]  We're not just talking about Democrats running the country, but the most crazed, factionalized,
[07:09.640 --> 07:19.400]  power-tripping, loser-ville CNN that is a weaponized criminal intelligence agency, working
[07:19.400 --> 07:23.880]  with leftist elements of the CIA and the whole project that Obama launched before he left
[07:23.880 --> 07:24.880]  office.
[07:24.880 --> 07:29.480]  You know, I say that, and it sounds so fantastical, I have to step back, but that's really what
[07:29.480 --> 07:32.520]  they've done.
[07:32.520 --> 07:40.840]  When you look at what a bunch of stupid wimps these people in dying media are, and how they're
[07:40.840 --> 07:48.240]  interfaced with a bunch of power-tripping leftist intelligence ops in the CIA and the FBI,
[07:48.240 --> 07:52.480]  with all these little criminal networks that Obama and Hillary left behind, it's just such
[07:52.480 --> 07:53.480]  a crime.
[07:53.480 --> 08:00.560]  It's such a cabal of dirtbags, and the only thing I've got to say is I understand Tucker
[08:00.560 --> 08:05.960]  Carlson wants to take the super-uber ultra-high road and say, oh, this lady, she's a great
[08:05.960 --> 08:06.960]  lady.
[08:06.960 --> 08:11.400]  You know, she's a leftist foaming at the mouth, anti-man professor who expunged your
[08:11.400 --> 08:20.000]  records before launching all this, and you've got the whole train of people that have been
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.120]  caught for political purposes saying that something was done to them or for racial purposes.
[08:25.120 --> 08:29.720]  People forget the lacrosse team and how the media knew it was alive and went with it
[08:29.720 --> 08:37.240]  forever, because it's a bunch of white guys and a black woman, so the image is of evil
[08:37.240 --> 08:40.720]  and said it was the opposite.
[08:40.720 --> 08:46.560]  Why did the mainly white lacrosse team get a black stripper?
[08:46.560 --> 08:50.960]  Everything gets projected and turned to something evil because the globalists want racial division,
[08:50.960 --> 08:55.760]  and it's in the WikiLeaks that are doing this.
[08:55.760 --> 08:56.760]  This is their plan.
[08:56.760 --> 08:58.200]  This is their operation.
[08:58.200 --> 09:03.040]  And you've got all the other women that are constantly getting caught, and you've got
[09:03.040 --> 09:09.160]  law enforcement reports confirming in Europe and the U.S. that upwards of half of sexual
[09:09.160 --> 09:15.240]  assaults are fake, unless it's Islamic, that you've got multi-thousand percent increases
[09:15.240 --> 09:20.760]  in rapes and asset attacks and women being kidnapped, little girls, true, wide-scale
[09:20.760 --> 09:26.720]  organized crime, total cover-ups, everything they can do to, you know, if a young girl
[09:26.720 --> 09:31.480]  gets kidnapped right by 100 men when she's 12, they call it, oh, the young girl had sex
[09:31.480 --> 09:33.560]  with 100 men.
[09:33.560 --> 09:37.800]  So again, the left bending over backwards, and then sexually abusing little girls and
[09:37.800 --> 09:42.560]  little boys with the whole trans teaching, where they're going in and sexualizing young
[09:42.560 --> 09:49.040]  children and manipulating them into wanting to be castrated chemically or physically.
[09:49.040 --> 09:51.680]  And again, this is the assault.
[09:51.680 --> 09:57.240]  So the group of people in the organization in Hollywood, in the corporate media, like
[09:57.240 --> 10:02.160]  CNN that takes billions of dollars from Gulf state dictators on record, they are the worst
[10:02.160 --> 10:03.160]  people in the world.
[10:03.160 --> 10:08.560]  If you like Jeffrey Dahmer doing a PSA against cannibalism, he's a cannibal.
[10:08.560 --> 10:14.220]  It doesn't hold water or Hitler, you know, sitting as the judge in the Nuremberg trial
[10:14.220 --> 10:15.720]  over the Nazis.
[10:15.720 --> 10:22.040]  But let's go to this important report, if this woman is for real, she's that blip on
[10:22.040 --> 10:27.400]  the radar of someone that is, and it's 36 years ago, and her eyewitness says it didn't
[10:27.400 --> 10:28.400]  happen.
[10:28.400 --> 10:30.880]  The eyewitness says it didn't happen.
[10:30.880 --> 10:33.400]  I mean, this is incredible.
[10:33.400 --> 10:36.840]  And then you've got Feinstein saying she doesn't know if it's all true.
[10:36.840 --> 10:37.840]  This is unbelievable.
[10:37.840 --> 10:41.160]  So you talk about witch hunt, this is just an expansion to that.
[10:41.160 --> 10:46.040]  Remember the Russian thing went nowhere, that turned into what, not paying your taxes.
[10:46.040 --> 10:50.560]  All right, folks, let's go ahead and go to this very, very important piece.
[10:50.560 --> 10:54.480]  And then there'll be a lot more coming up with Owen Shroyer and more today in FullWars.com,
[10:54.480 --> 10:59.360]  NewsWars.com, the most banned, most verboten, most attack transmission in the world for
[10:59.360 --> 11:00.360]  good reason.
[11:00.360 --> 11:05.640]  But thanks to you spreading the URL in FullWars.com and NewsWars.com, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[11:05.640 --> 11:07.560]  When we work together, God bless you all.
[11:07.560 --> 11:11.760]  And here's the piece with Tucker Carlson and Ann Coulter.
[11:11.760 --> 11:12.760]  We're in Washington right now.
[11:12.760 --> 11:13.760]  I've been here all my life.
[11:13.760 --> 11:20.320]  And I can say I've never seen this city crazier or more paranoid or more tense or more dumb.
[11:20.320 --> 11:21.320]  Here's an example.
[11:21.320 --> 11:24.160]  Three years ago, Brett Kavanaugh made what was obviously a joke about his time in high
[11:24.160 --> 11:25.160]  school.
[11:25.160 --> 11:26.160]  Here it is.
[11:26.160 --> 11:32.760]  Unfortunately, we had a good saying that we've held firm to this day as the dean was reminding
[11:32.760 --> 11:40.120]  me before the talk, which is what happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep.
[11:40.120 --> 11:42.560]  That's been a good thing for all of us, I think.
[11:42.560 --> 11:46.160]  Yeah, so he's obviously meeting a felony sex crime there.
[11:46.160 --> 11:50.760]  No, it was a joke and it's clearly irrelevant to what we're talking about today, but don't
[11:50.760 --> 11:54.160]  tell the more literal-minded, humorless members of the Senate.
[11:54.160 --> 11:55.160]  How about Elizabeth Warren?
[11:55.160 --> 11:56.160]  She tweeted this.
[11:56.160 --> 11:58.520]  I can't imagine any parent accepting his view.
[11:58.520 --> 12:01.560]  Is this really what America wants in this next Supreme Court justice?
[12:01.560 --> 12:05.640]  If you can even imagine texting something like that or putting it on Twitter mindless.
[12:05.640 --> 12:09.120]  Ann Coulter is a writer, author of Resistance is Feudal, how the Trump hitting left has
[12:09.120 --> 12:14.480]  lost his collective mind, as if she needed another example of it she joins us tonight.
[12:14.480 --> 12:17.360]  So what do you make of the fact, I was trying to get a straight answer from our last guest,
[12:17.360 --> 12:21.360]  and I'm not sure what I even think of it, what do you make of the fact that Dianne Feinstein
[12:21.360 --> 12:25.080]  is saying, I'm not sure I believe Christine Ford now?
[12:25.080 --> 12:30.320]  Well, Dianne Feinstein has always been one of my favorite senators, Republican or Democrat.
[12:30.320 --> 12:31.440]  I was sort of surprised.
[12:31.440 --> 12:34.400]  She was the one who held on to this letter.
[12:34.400 --> 12:38.680]  I don't think the big issue is that it's the 11th hour.
[12:38.680 --> 12:43.880]  I think the big issue is last week we started getting polls showing the Democrats have a
[12:43.880 --> 12:46.560]  shot at taking the Senate.
[12:46.560 --> 12:48.840]  They really want to stop this nomination.
[12:48.840 --> 12:52.840]  It's been kind of hilarious listening to the Democrats, oh and the New York Times editorial
[12:52.840 --> 12:57.840]  page and Schumer and Blumenthal, we need a major FBI investigation.
[12:57.840 --> 13:00.280]  As you point out, there's nothing to investigate.
[13:00.280 --> 13:04.880]  They want to appoint a blue ribbon commission, and maybe they'll wrap up their work sometime
[13:04.880 --> 13:06.680]  next February.
[13:06.680 --> 13:08.800]  It really is just purely for delay.
[13:08.800 --> 13:13.360]  So can I ask, why not an independent counsel, and he can take me four or five years to get
[13:13.360 --> 13:18.320]  to the bottom, why would the Republican, look, I am giving everybody every benefit of every
[13:18.320 --> 13:19.320]  doubt.
[13:19.320 --> 13:22.440]  I'm not attacking Ford, who again, as I said last night, I've heard as a nice person,
[13:22.440 --> 13:26.240]  but this is a political tactic designed to prevent the president from putting his nominee
[13:26.240 --> 13:27.240]  on the court.
[13:27.240 --> 13:31.840]  What are the Republicans in the Congress playing along with this?
[13:31.840 --> 13:36.880]  I think some of them, and this is the only thing that I think makes it dangerous for
[13:36.880 --> 13:42.080]  Republicans for Kavanaugh and for the Republic, because there are certain Republicans in the
[13:42.080 --> 13:44.960]  Senate who so hate Trump.
[13:44.960 --> 13:50.400]  They would put their egos above the good of the country, and what so many Republicans
[13:50.400 --> 13:55.280]  said about voting, and every four years say about voting for any Republican, we have to
[13:55.280 --> 13:57.400]  do it for the Supreme Court nominees.
[13:57.400 --> 14:04.520]  No, maybe not for Ben Sasse, maybe not for Senator Bob Corker, they just so hate Trump.
[14:04.520 --> 14:07.000]  That could end up hurting Kavanaugh.
[14:07.000 --> 14:14.920]  But I think your points that if they get away with this, then you have CNN running the country.
[14:14.920 --> 14:18.440]  It's not even just the Democrats running the country, it's the media running the country,
[14:18.440 --> 14:28.040]  because this allegation could be made against anyone at any time, absolutely non-disprovable.
[14:28.040 --> 14:33.320]  The New York Times, I wanted to mention, since you cited Teddy Kennedy, one of the great
[14:33.320 --> 14:38.680]  things in the New York Times editorial on this case was to say that things were totally
[14:38.680 --> 14:40.080]  different in the 1980s.
[14:40.080 --> 14:44.840]  That's why this woman, Dr. Ford, didn't report at the time, because you remember the 1980s
[14:44.840 --> 14:49.640]  talk, or you used to be able to, there was sexual assault like mad every place.
[14:49.640 --> 14:54.280]  Their proof of this, that women weren't taken seriously in the 1980s, was to link to an
[14:54.280 --> 14:59.360]  article in the Washington Post citing the New York Times treatment of the accuser of
[14:59.360 --> 15:01.320]  William Kennedy Smith.
[15:01.320 --> 15:07.720]  So yes, the Kennedys, they've always had free reign to rape, murder, and the New York
[15:07.720 --> 15:11.680]  Times would go after the accusers, but that's really what the division is here.
[15:11.680 --> 15:18.600]  This isn't a new thing, as long as you are a presumed white male Republican, whether
[15:18.600 --> 15:25.120]  it's the Duke La Crosse case, or that dastardly Haven Monaghan in the Rolling Stone story about
[15:25.120 --> 15:28.720]  the frat boys gang-raping the gal, the whole thing turned out to be fake, there is no
[15:28.720 --> 15:30.440]  Haven Monaghan.
[15:30.440 --> 15:37.520]  Or now, a lot of the statements about Brett Kavanaugh, like from Krogman, oh, he's smirking,
[15:37.520 --> 15:42.320]  and a lot on Twitter and elsewhere, oh, he's a white male, he's white privilege, if you
[15:42.320 --> 15:46.760]  fit the narrative, you are guilty and there is no coming back from that, and it's not
[15:46.760 --> 15:52.240]  just Democrats and the media running the country, it's any white male can be accused with an
[15:52.240 --> 15:53.240]  evidence-free action.
[15:53.240 --> 15:58.040]  Well, you shouldn't judge people on the basis of their immutable characteristics.

[20:52.680 --> 20:56.640]  to be joining us in the 4th hour and we may also have another guest with some breaking
[20:56.640 --> 21:01.440]  news today, but I'm going to hold off on that for now because I'm not sure if that's
[21:01.440 --> 21:07.040]  going to happen or not, but there's about to be some big news developing on a certain
[21:07.040 --> 21:08.040]  front today.
[21:08.040 --> 21:13.200]  It actually ties into the Kavanaugh hearings, which I've got a lot more news on.
[21:13.200 --> 21:18.400]  I've got some clips that I want to get to, it's really madness though.
[21:18.400 --> 21:25.160]  What they're doing to Brett Kavanaugh right now in these Supreme Court hearings where
[21:25.160 --> 21:34.000]  they'll make, one woman will make up allegations against Brett Kavanaugh and the entire Democrat
[21:34.000 --> 21:40.120]  party will get on board.
[21:40.120 --> 21:46.600]  Now how many people have come out from Brett Kavanaugh's high school and talked about these
[21:46.600 --> 21:48.800]  allegations and talked about Brett Kavanaugh?
[21:48.800 --> 21:51.400]  Do you know how many?
[21:51.400 --> 21:54.240]  Actually the number is 200.
[21:54.240 --> 21:55.240]  200.
[21:55.240 --> 22:03.480]  Do you know how many of them are making any sort of negative comments about Brett Kavanaugh?
[22:03.480 --> 22:05.480]  One.
[22:05.480 --> 22:08.480]  One.
[22:08.480 --> 22:10.400]  And who do the Democrats listen to?
[22:10.400 --> 22:13.400]  Who does the media give all the attention to?
[22:13.400 --> 22:15.120]  Not the 200.
[22:15.120 --> 22:17.160]  The one.
[22:17.160 --> 22:19.720]  Pull up the news story guys.
[22:19.720 --> 22:27.600]  200 women from Brett Kavanaugh's high school signed a letter talking about how he never
[22:27.600 --> 22:29.520]  behaved like this.
[22:29.520 --> 22:33.480]  He was always in control, always a good guy.
[22:33.480 --> 22:37.480]  Never would he do anything like that to a girl in high school ever.
[22:37.480 --> 22:42.720]  And by 200 women in his high school.
[22:42.720 --> 22:45.640]  Now I realized this the other day.
[22:45.640 --> 22:48.680]  I can't even remember what broadcast it was on.
[22:48.680 --> 22:55.880]  The reason why President Donald Trump selected Brett Kavanaugh is because he was the purist.
[22:55.880 --> 22:58.040]  He had the best record.
[22:58.040 --> 23:00.400]  He was untouchable.
[23:00.400 --> 23:02.720]  He was the good guy.
[23:02.720 --> 23:10.040]  Now where there's some negative things about there's a story guys it's up to 200 women now.
[23:10.040 --> 23:13.320]  He came from the Bush administration maybe some of the politics you don't like there's
[23:13.320 --> 23:24.440]  all that but see Trump got it and he said I have to I have to pick the purist guy because
[23:24.440 --> 23:25.960]  I know they're going to be attacked.
[23:25.960 --> 23:26.960]  It was 200 supporting her.
[23:26.960 --> 23:32.520]  I could have sworn I saw one that had 200 supporting him.
[23:32.520 --> 23:36.840]  But whatever the whole thing the whole thing is just out of control.
[23:36.840 --> 23:43.240]  But her own lawyer her own lawyer comes out and says she doesn't have to corroborate her
[23:43.240 --> 23:49.880]  story and listen to the lengths of craziness that they're willing to take this guys.
[23:49.880 --> 23:52.640]  Let's go to clip nine.
[23:52.640 --> 23:59.400]  Listen to this was actually from Hannity but it was a clip I believe from MSNBC and CNN.
[23:59.400 --> 24:06.160]  Just listen to what these people are saying about the woman's claims against Kavanaugh.
[24:06.160 --> 24:09.520]  You'll notice how they don't care if they're true or not.
[24:09.520 --> 24:10.520]  Roll clip nine.
[24:10.520 --> 24:15.520]  You have no knowledge whether Brett Kavanaugh is in with that purist.
[24:15.520 --> 24:21.080]  It doesn't matter because when you to come forward she has no there's no enticements
[24:21.080 --> 24:22.080]  for her to come forward.
[24:22.080 --> 24:25.640]  By the end of the week if Judge Kavanaugh decides he doesn't want to go through this
[24:25.640 --> 24:29.480]  it isn't worth it he doesn't want to maybe he can win but he doesn't want an asterisk
[24:29.480 --> 24:33.080]  I mean it wouldn't surprise me if he chose to withdraw and chose to back down.
[24:33.080 --> 24:38.640]  The reality is I see it right now probably this nomination is cut and he doesn't is he
[24:38.640 --> 24:42.360]  willing to accept that when the time comes and withdraw it or not.
[24:42.360 --> 24:46.040]  We need to judge Brett Kavanaugh not just on what he may or may not have done but how
[24:46.040 --> 24:51.480]  he treats a woman's pain and that is something I'm paying attention to on Monday.
[24:51.480 --> 25:00.520]  How does he respond to what is happening whether or not he agrees that this happened with her?
[25:00.520 --> 25:03.680]  Are you hearing these people?
[25:03.680 --> 25:08.520]  Whether or not it happened or not doesn't matter.
[25:08.520 --> 25:13.600]  It's about how he feels about a woman's pain.
[25:13.600 --> 25:18.720]  Wait a second what if she's making it up?
[25:18.720 --> 25:26.880]  So so now according to their logic you can make something up and then have fake pain
[25:26.880 --> 25:33.240]  because of your fake story and if somebody doesn't feel bad for you well they're the
[25:33.240 --> 25:38.440]  bad guy they're the jerk they can't be on the Supreme Court you see where the Democrats
[25:38.440 --> 25:41.120]  were the leftist media.
[25:41.120 --> 25:47.520]  We've decided this nomination is cooked Brett Kavanaugh's a rapist.
[25:47.520 --> 25:53.880]  No evidence doesn't matter she hasn't corroborated her story she doesn't have to.
[25:53.880 --> 25:57.720]  The only eyewitness says it didn't happen it doesn't matter don't you care about a
[25:57.720 --> 26:06.680]  woman's pain but but but what if she's making it up but her pain.
[26:06.680 --> 26:15.960]  And so they use this now to keep a man off the Supreme Court to stop the Democratic Republic
[26:15.960 --> 26:23.640]  of the United States of America from working and Diane Feinstein should be charged with
[26:23.640 --> 26:29.320]  obstruction of justice when she withholds this fake letter for 20 days waits for the
[26:29.320 --> 26:34.720]  hearings to end and then sends it out there so the media can run with headlines they can
[26:34.720 --> 26:40.840]  attack and and a character assassinate Kavanaugh and then what does Diane Feinstein say?
[26:40.840 --> 26:45.800]  Well we don't know that any of this is true well then why did you put it out there Congress
[26:45.800 --> 26:46.800]  woman?
[26:46.800 --> 26:52.280]  Well because you wanted the media to destroy Brett Kavanaugh you wanted this fake story
[26:52.280 --> 26:59.560]  to destroy Brett Kavanaugh maybe you should be censured maybe all of these Democrat congressmen
[26:59.560 --> 27:05.720]  and women are the ones that are cooked MSNBC maybe you're cooked MSNBC of course you are
[27:05.720 --> 27:13.480]  cooked you're cooked because nobody watches you and you're cooked because your stories
[27:13.480 --> 27:23.560]  are fake your stories are cooked and everybody sees who you are now when you're so pathetic
[27:23.560 --> 27:32.440]  that you fake hurricane coverage unbelievable and so that's what we go through now I also
[27:32.440 --> 27:36.360]  plan on opening up the phone lines and I'm going to try to actually get to this news

[35:26.920 --> 35:31.800]  from minorities is what they do so they make minorities this this position of valor and then
[35:31.800 --> 35:36.440]  they steal their valor by faking being minorities like elizabeth warren claiming she's an indian
[35:37.000 --> 35:42.040]  see how that works like rachel doizel claiming she's black when she's white you see how that
[35:42.040 --> 35:48.840]  works the list goes on so here is the rally point tomorrow in austin texas i will be there

[38:43.800 --> 38:47.800]  going to gauge the reaction and we're probably going to get local news to come out and cover it
[38:47.800 --> 38:53.880]  and then if you have 10 cities 20 cities 30 cities that all did it in the same day you just created
[38:53.880 --> 39:04.200]  a national news story that's how we roll you know what i don't need to pay you like george
[39:04.200 --> 39:11.800]  soros pays off all of these kavanaugh protesters i don't need to be part of some left wing under
[39:11.800 --> 39:18.120]  the table funds the democrats fake news colluding with the media smear campaign against judge
[39:18.120 --> 39:23.320]  kavanaugh to try to impact change in this world i just need to go out and be real and put my
[39:23.320 --> 39:28.920]  messages out there and put the truth out there and that's how you win but if we don't fight
[39:28.920 --> 39:41.880]  then we lose so having said that let's see what we have here oh you know what let's let's let's
[39:41.880 --> 39:49.080]  just play this clip because i was upset to see that this barely made news last night and and i mean
[39:49.880 --> 39:53.720]  again i don't think that most people with fox news are bad the only person i think i mean
[39:53.720 --> 39:57.960]  who knows what's in chef smith's head but like overall i think most of them just read teleprompters
[39:57.960 --> 40:04.120]  and just enjoy sitting down and and chopping it up and going home tucker carlson fights to get
[40:04.120 --> 40:09.000]  information out there fights to expose the left shon hannity tries to be as informative as possible
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.200]  laura ingram it really is not afraid to speak her mind and then like lou dobbs is great on fox
[40:14.200 --> 40:17.960]  business i think cat is fine too and there's some other people but i mean it's pretty much really
[40:17.960 --> 40:24.920]  watered down why didn't this clip from project veritas exposing the deep state go totally vital
[40:24.920 --> 40:29.480]  now understand the audio is bad i don't care i'm rolling it because everyone needs to see this
[40:29.480 --> 40:36.280]  clip and it's just the beginning folks and hold the music here guys roll clip 15 the short boil down
[40:36.280 --> 40:42.200]  of the democrat exposing himself talking about how they're they'll obstruct anything when it comes
[40:42.200 --> 40:47.640]  to the trump administration this should be totally viral and and and project veritas has a lot more
[40:47.640 --> 40:57.880]  coming out just just listen to this video from project veritas so this is the intro the new
[40:57.880 --> 41:03.400]  intro james o' keith put together what a badass um and then there's a lot of talk about how we can

[47:25.160 --> 47:35.480]  all right ladies and gentlemen i need to finish up with this cavern on news in this segment
[47:35.480 --> 47:42.680]  and then in the next hour i need to highlight the big plans for censorship how they're going to use
[47:42.680 --> 47:50.200]  chinese censorship and then roll it out here once these social media companies and tech giants
[47:50.200 --> 47:55.240]  have been fully integrated into the chinese government but we're going to do that in the next hour in
[47:55.240 --> 48:00.920]  the meantime let's just go through all of this cavern on madness so we can just get this off the
[48:00.920 --> 48:05.640]  docket no pun intended and move forward because there's other big news i want to get to too and
[48:05.640 --> 48:12.600]  i'd love to open up the phone lines before i sign off here today so you heard the clip
[48:12.600 --> 48:19.400]  mazy hirano from hawaii the democrat saying men just need to shut up get out of the
[48:19.400 --> 48:25.000]  cavern on accuser's way and you have to believe her now look i get that these these these women
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.840]  hate men or whatever it is it's a political stunt for them or to talk down to men or they think it
[48:30.840 --> 48:35.480]  gets them votes or something okay fine but but whatever i don't even care as a man you can hate
[48:35.480 --> 48:41.000]  me you know talk me down honestly i don't give a damn it shows who you really are but here's
[48:41.000 --> 48:47.720]  the scary thing about it what they're saying is that you have to believe a woman who makes any
[48:47.720 --> 48:54.040]  accusation period end of story doesn't matter how many women have been caught faking stuff
[48:54.040 --> 48:59.160]  doesn't matter how many women have have made up things about men i mean you look at a history
[48:59.160 --> 49:04.040]  of divorce court so many times in divorce court women all the sudden claim their their husband
[49:04.040 --> 49:10.600]  ex-husband raped them it's like it's like a known thing i mean there's all kinds of statistics out
[49:10.600 --> 49:18.440]  there and really if you wanted to stop that false rape claims if you can prove a rape claim was
[49:18.440 --> 49:26.360]  false if a rape claim is falsified a sexual allegation assault is is falsified not like okay
[49:26.360 --> 49:30.280]  something happened but we determined it wasn't a rape or sexual assault or anything illegal
[49:30.920 --> 49:37.480]  but if you can determine that the claims are totally falsified whatever punishment would
[49:37.480 --> 49:44.680]  have been levied against the man you accused you should then face 110 percent and and women
[49:44.680 --> 49:50.280]  should support that because see that protects women who have been raped that protects women
[49:50.280 --> 49:55.480]  who have been victimized by sexual assault but that's not what mazy hirano says that's not what
[49:55.480 --> 50:01.320]  the democrats say they want anybody to any woman who makes any claim to be believed 110 percent
[50:01.320 --> 50:06.440]  but then guess what women are gonna lie women are gonna take advantage of that and then actual
[50:06.440 --> 50:11.080]  victims of rape never get heard of course that's what the democrats have already done
[50:11.080 --> 50:17.480]  look at what happened with keith ellison and uh monahan i can't even remember her name notice
[50:17.480 --> 50:22.760]  everybody knows the fake woman who made the claims ends cavernal nobody knows the real woman who made
[50:22.760 --> 50:28.680]  the claims against ellison which we have actual proof of and you get ready bonds about to drop on that
[50:30.120 --> 50:35.000]  but that's what they want you to say oh woman made an accusation she must be believed
[50:35.000 --> 50:43.320]  no that's lunacy and now they keep saying they want an fbi investigation fbi investigation how
[50:43.320 --> 50:51.000]  about an fbi investigation into diane feinstein having a chinese spy for 20 years nope but feinstein
[50:51.000 --> 50:57.000]  says after she withholds the letter for 20 days before the hearings and then releases it after
[50:57.000 --> 51:01.560]  the hearings obstruction of justice she's the one that releases it then to the media so they
[51:01.560 --> 51:06.360]  could create these headlines and character assassinate cavernal and then she says i can't say
[51:06.360 --> 51:10.920]  everything in the letter is truthful then why did you have it why didn't you corroborate it and then
[51:10.920 --> 51:18.520]  why did you release it because they want to destroy cavernal with lies now um cavernal's
[51:18.520 --> 51:25.560]  accuser ford she's a doctor now dr ford she's dr ford professor ford you know what's she gonna be
[51:25.560 --> 51:32.360]  next an astronaut and she accuses ford of owner she's saying that she's been forced out of her
[51:32.360 --> 51:37.400]  home over threats now well you know what i'm sorry i have a hard time believing that you know why
[51:37.400 --> 51:41.880]  because you're a known liar so you say people are threatening you and you've been forced to leave
[51:41.880 --> 51:47.800]  your home guess what you're a known liar i don't believe you that's your fault maybe it's true it's
[51:47.800 --> 51:54.520]  like the boy that cried wolf sorry don't believe you liar and then oh my gosh you're gonna love this
[51:54.520 --> 52:02.360]  clip folks this is like this is so next level you thought you thought what i just reported here
[52:02.360 --> 52:08.120]  was madness you thought what i just reported here was insane wait till you hear this
[52:08.920 --> 52:15.400]  hillary clinton says that we have to give cavernal's accuser the benefit of the doubt
[52:16.600 --> 52:21.640]  wow and we've got the clip but but just think about the boldness
[52:21.640 --> 52:31.720]  think about the unmitigated audacity for hillary clinton who has abused women psychologically
[52:31.720 --> 52:39.240]  victims of of rape and sexual assault a woman who stood up for a rapist pedophile this is one of
[52:39.240 --> 52:46.280]  the most sick if this doesn't show you how sick and demonic hillary clinton really is that she
[52:46.280 --> 52:53.640]  would go this far to say we have to believe all the accusers when she ignored and psychologically
[52:53.640 --> 53:01.720]  abused the multiple accusers of her husband this is a demon folks this is a demon this woman
[53:03.400 --> 53:14.120]  knows no limits of her demonic depraved everything essence very being she can't be anything else but
[53:14.120 --> 53:19.640]  a total demon she can't be anything else but a total liar she can't be anything else but a
[53:19.640 --> 53:28.520]  total fraud so listen to the audacity of hillary clinton who again psychologically abused bill
[53:28.520 --> 53:33.880]  clinton's accusers let's not even say victims because she just says if you make an accusation
[53:33.880 --> 53:38.120]  then it has to be true well they accuse bill clinton in fact i accuse bill clinton of rape
[53:38.120 --> 53:44.920]  i allege bill clinton raped me in the international space station in 1988 before i was even born
[53:44.920 --> 53:51.000]  but that's my accusation and i'm a woman today so i'm a woman today the left says i can decide my
[53:51.000 --> 53:57.000]  own gender my own sex so today i'm a woman today as a woman i accuse bill clinton allegedly
[53:57.640 --> 54:03.960]  perhaps raping me on the international space station in 1988 with a cigar doesn't matter
[54:03.960 --> 54:10.040]  i wasn't born doesn't matter i'm alleging it but it's not true i allege that i accuse bill clinton
[54:10.040 --> 54:14.680]  i declare myself a woman today so hillary clinton must hear me out don't believe me
[54:14.680 --> 54:20.440]  let's go to hillary clinton i mean there can't be one set of rules for democrats and one set
[54:20.440 --> 54:24.920]  of rules for republicans that's one of the reasons why oh my gosh people don't have any confidence
[54:24.920 --> 54:28.840]  literally her congress how can you you don't know what's gonna happen from day to day pause it right
[54:28.840 --> 54:34.600]  there pause right there do you see what i'm saying she has to be as big of a liar as possible she
[54:34.600 --> 54:41.160]  can't tell a little she has to be fully demonic she has to be fully on board with lies she has to
[54:41.160 --> 54:48.760]  be fully on board with propaganda she has to rub crap in your face and spit on you go back i just
[54:48.760 --> 54:56.440]  this is unbelievable member back in the thomas hearings when uh senator bird uh was asked kkk
[54:56.440 --> 55:01.480]  member she was friends with and he said in a situation like this we should give the benefit
[55:01.480 --> 55:06.840]  of the doubt to the court and the country oh my god and and that's what the republicans should be
[55:06.840 --> 55:13.320]  doing right now from the white house down pennsylvania avenue to the senate give the benefit of the
[55:13.320 --> 55:20.280]  doubt to the court and the money to broadrick kathleen kathleen willy have a an investigation
[55:20.280 --> 55:27.640]  that will then lead to a hearing that will then lead to a vote this is insane and instead
[55:27.640 --> 55:32.440]  they know that's not even true uh she's a liar she's a lawyer she knows that's not true you know try
[55:32.440 --> 55:39.880]  to pack the court with uh you know another nominee regardless of the question that's on rachel madow
[55:39.880 --> 55:51.960]  last night now here's the deal folks there's a reason why we came together to elect trump
[55:53.240 --> 55:56.520]  it's because we knew hillary clinton was a total demon
[55:59.240 --> 56:02.440]  and so people from all different backgrounds and all different political beliefs
[56:02.440 --> 56:11.640]  all different religions races whatever age groups sexes we knew we had to stop that witch
[56:13.240 --> 56:18.600]  right there and thank god we did can you imagine now i want to go now to clip
[56:21.240 --> 56:25.800]  18 because this is why trump has them so afraid folks this is why they're doubling down on their
[56:25.800 --> 56:32.440]  lies tripling quadrupling just just listen to governor jerry brown of california who's destroyed
[56:32.440 --> 56:40.840]  california listen to what he says on msnbc we never had a president who is engaged in this kind of
[56:40.840 --> 56:47.320]  behavior i mean he's not saving the economy yeah he's changing his mind he's uh you know sabotaging
[56:47.320 --> 56:54.440]  the world order in many respects thank god it's unprecedented it's dangerous and hopefully this
[56:54.440 --> 57:00.920]  election is going to send a strong message to the country the democrats will win and then trump uh
[57:00.920 --> 57:06.040]  well something's got to happen to this guy because if we don't get rid of him uh he's going to undermine
[57:06.040 --> 57:12.520]  america and even the world um undermining america by making it stronger and richer
[57:12.520 --> 57:16.920]  undermine america by bringing the joys back standing up for it loving it that's undermining it according
[57:16.920 --> 57:23.160]  to democrat governor california jerry brown who i guess saved california then by that jerry brown
[57:23.160 --> 57:29.720]  saved california by making it feces ridden needle ridden drug ridden criminal ridden debt ridden
[57:29.720 --> 57:34.040]  so so california say california was saved by jerry brown by destroying it so cal
[57:34.600 --> 57:39.400]  jerry brown is the savior of california don't you get he destroyed california he took a dump on
[57:39.400 --> 57:45.400]  california he urinated on california he spit on california he made california broke he's the hero
[57:45.400 --> 57:52.680]  trump saved america so so he destroyed america you deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout

[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:23.400]  informers.com here is a dem's life by big game productions there was that ant that stood up to
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:33.800]  me yeah but we can forget about him yeah it was just one hand you're right it's just one
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:43.720]  ant yeah boys they're puny puny say let's pretend this grain is a puny little ant kanya west
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:49.480]  did that hurt nope well how about this one kandace owens are you kidding
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:59.880]  how about this
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:14.360]  you let one ant stand up to us then they all might stand up those puny little ants out
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:20.920]  number us a hundred to one and if they ever figure that out there goes our way of life
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:28.760]  it's not about the votes it's about keeping those ants in line that's why we're going back
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:38.280]  does anybody else want to stay so there you go now make that meme go viral because it explains
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:46.040]  the democrat party and how they view black people to at and you know here's the craziest thing
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:53.320]  i mean i'm not going to sit here and act like i know everyone you know where every demographic
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:59.800]  group lies politically that's impossible to claim but i don't see the democrats dominating the black
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:09.000]  vote at all in this midterm and if they don't get at least you know 70% 80% of the black vote
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.360]  the democrat party is dead and they know that that's why that's why that meme is so perfect
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:19.880]  because it's all about keeping black voters in line see it's all about keeping them on welfare
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.520]  all about keeping them needy all about keeping them needing the democrats oh but now they realize
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:28.440]  oh black people they're aware of our games now they're not really voting for us they kind of
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:34.440]  like trump even and so what are they doing they're trying to open the borders they're trying to bring
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:39.880]  in people from central america to vote so so they don't care about the black people voting anymore
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:43.800]  you've you've learned about their tricks so now they want to trick people coming in from central
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:50.120]  america and make them citizens so that they can get their vote and create voter blocks i just don't
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:54.680]  see it working for the democrats i really don't see this blue wave working but they're they're
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:05:01.400]  gonna lie and act like it's inevitable we all know the importance of fish oils while we are sure to

[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:21.000]  all right big news is breaking pretty much all the time but
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:29.080]  it really is perfect timing that there's about to be some bombshell news breaking on keith ellison
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:39.960]  and again it's just it's ridiculous because karen monahan who was allegedly a victim of
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:45.800]  keith ellison although it's not alleged the records prove it you know she doesn't get any media coverage
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:50.040]  nobody cares you know it's keith ellison he's a good muslim don't don't you dare say anything bad about
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:58.040]  him oh but kavin all who's a good catholic who actually has no evidence against him and they
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:03.640]  admit the accusations aren't true well that doesn't matter we say he's bad we don't like him he can't
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:11.480]  be on the supreme court total childish behavior i mean you want to boil it down they're acting
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:18.440]  like children but it's not that these are demonic pathological liars that lust for power
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:24.520]  and they see the supreme court slipping through their hands for the next 20 30 years
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:31.240]  and they can't stand it they need that power they have to wield that power over the american people
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:40.200]  but who do the democrats ally with to do that who do the democrats collude with to do that well big
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:49.480]  tech and social media and so more news developments come out every day about how these tech giants in
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:55.240]  silicon valley apple and google are moving to china getting their cloud stories to china
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:08:00.920]  uh allowing themselves with the chinese government where china announces big new tariffs on america
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:08.360]  right big new tariffs on us goods but who is not getting those tariffs who gets exempt from those
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:15.960]  tear oh apple oh i see okay gotcha gotcha so tariffs on us goods in a in a trade war now
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:21.160]  it's a trade war it used to be trade rape yeah china used to just rape us in trade now we're
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:27.320]  fighting back so it's a trade war and it's a big headline trump bat but okay so china says well
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:32.440]  we're gonna have to tear off some items here you're engaging in trade war now okay and then oh but
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:36.520]  apple no no you're good bro you're good you work with the chinese government you give us all the

[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:39.560]  loves it two million political prisoners in china that we know of hundred million
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:43.240]  political murders by the chinese government that we know of
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:54.200]  manufacturing plants in china where they work for a bag of rice a day to feed their family
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:00.760]  where they have abortion abortionaries in the factories so that women don't get pregnant after
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:05.560]  miswork where they have suicide nets outside the window because people are so miserable so they
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:17.080]  don't jump out to die wow and then what do you find out hillary clinton's private server was
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:22.120]  actually china's private server it wasn't even hillary's china just put it in hillary's house
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:28.840]  so that she could upload classified data to it diane feinstein one of the top democrats for decades
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:36.600]  multi multi-millionaire has a chinese spy with her for 20 years or was she the chinese spot
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.680]  where's that investigation where's that hearing where are the calls for that where's the media
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:54.600]  outrage crickets but that man alex jones in austin texas is out of control shut him down
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:11:02.040]  down chinese spies in the government and then and then what was it like 20 20 u.s assets in china
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:07.560]  got killed by the chinese government tortured some of them because they got the classified
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:13.320]  details was that diane feinstein's fault does diane feinstein have the death of americans on on
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:20.120]  her hands because she was a chinese spy or or is it hillary clinton that was the chinese spy
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:25.000]  that has the death of those americans on her hands it wouldn't really matter for hillary i mean how
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.480]  many death toll on hillary's belt i mean screw like the you know you talk about like old western
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:38.280]  flicks or they like mark a notch on their their their gun for every kill they get g i mean hillary
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:43.720]  clinton's got like i mean if anybody's competing with the she brags about what she did in libya
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:51.480]  so yeah there it is big tech will work with the chinese government and censor alex jones although
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:57.960]  maybe it's all one in the same right because what does the chinese government do censor free
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:03.080]  speech what does the chinese government do censor political speech what does apple and
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:09.240]  google want to do censor political speech censor free speech and now they're all working in unison
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:14.840]  to do so in the west but people are too distracted to even notice it i can still watch my football
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:21.080]  i can still go look at my favorite instagram model i don't care about anything else what do i need
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:28.440]  oh but then you look into china's social media control and how they use that to monitor its
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:34.520]  citizens it's really crazy in fact in china it's basically in real time now pretty much i mean you
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:44.120]  go into hong kong or shanghai you're pretty much being video surveilled 24 seven which they almost
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:49.240]  have in america but it's different in china they got the facial recognition they got the biometric
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:56.200]  recognition they got it all and they got the social media networks tied into it it's all on record baby
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:03.480]  and you can say hey that's good for safety okay you can have that debate but did you sign on to that
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:10.280]  did did you let facebook know you wanted them to work with the you know the government to
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:16.600]  facially get your biometric data when you use the google searches and and and got your apple
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:23.000]  products did you agree to to let china data mine that and get all your information did you sign
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.440]  on to that did you sign on to be a chinese asset
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:36.600]  and so then they say the trade war china cuts us treasury holdings as trade war starts to heat up
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:41.960]  so it's been trade rape again to the tunes of actually over over time it's it's it's over a trillion
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:47.000]  dollars but annually a couple hundred bill couple hundred billion dollars china defeats us in the
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.120]  quote unquote trade war and why is that well because they don't have a minimum wage in china
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:55.800]  they don't they don't have working conditions of manufacturing plants that they have to keep up
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:00.360]  within china so they can pay people a penny a day uh you know they can have it you know basically be
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.840]  totally worn down in some of these factories they have to some of them have to live there
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.200]  and so that's basically what goes on and so they can manufacture things for cheap
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:16.280]  and then they can work with the chinese government and then beat be tax-free and so that allures a
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.840]  lot of big us companies that can afford it to to go over there make the investment and then it just
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:25.720]  pays off in triplicate because because their overhead costs in china are practically nothing
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:30.360]  so they say screw america i i'd rather move to china and have no overhead and then they treat
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:34.040]  you know people over there like you know basically just indentured servants of the government
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:39.480]  you put up a poster of jesus they rip it down take you to jail oh but now trump is like hey we're
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:45.400]  not going to let china trade rape us and they say trade war trump declares trade war no no this is
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:51.560]  like a rape victim standing up for themselves and stabbing or let's say let's say a woman is getting
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:56.120]  raped and she pulls out the gun and shoots the assailant that's like that's like the media coming
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:03.400]  out say woman savagely murders innocent man who was trying to open the door for her like no no
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:08.280]  she was being raped and she shot him because she didn't want to be raped and killed and she was in
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:16.200]  her defense media says woman savagely murders man who was offering her uh to hold her hand
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:24.840]  woman savagely murders an innocent man in the streets like no she was defending herself
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:29.240]  so here's china hundreds of billions of dollars a trillion dollars over time in trade deficit
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:33.480]  just destroying us in trade trump says hey we're going to try to even this and what are they
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:40.360]  trump declares war on china trump declares trade war meanwhile north korea and south korea have
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:45.480]  another meeting and both countries say north korea is going to work towards denuclearization
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:50.440]  does trump get any credit does anyone does anyone report on that does it matter if trump
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:55.160]  denuclearizes north korea or brings the koreas together which he's done historically any credit

[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:06.600]  it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:13.160]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:19.400]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:26.440]  out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:32.600]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:38.440]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:45.640]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:51.560]  the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:57.160]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:13.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:43.560]  lighthearted stuff here in the final three minutes before i come back and i focus on something that's
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:52.200]  more important now this is so racist folks i really don't even know how to report it
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:58.440]  from the daily mail gorillas form lifelong bonds with other apes that help neighboring groups keep
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:07.160]  the peace how dare you even report on gorillas do you know that they're closely related to the monkey
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:18.040]  so i i just have to go out and say that that i i i disavow i disavow i disavow this research on
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:25.160]  gorillas saying they form lifelong bonds with with other gorillas i disavow this is racist
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:31.480]  what gorillas can't think differently gorillas can't be independent do you know how racist that
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:38.280]  is so so i just want to disavow that because you know we know if you if you say monkey i mean
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:45.800]  you know it's you really need to be scolded and you know we can allege a lot of other things here
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:53.560]  but but we'll stay away uh so in case you haven't heard a strange story happened in new mexico sun
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:59.240]  spot new mexico there was a solar observatory closure that the fbi was all mum about a lot of
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:03.960]  weirdness going on there but again we don't we don't get much into the paranormal there's a lot
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:08.200]  of stuff out there if you're into that but the the strange thing that i wanted to talk about
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:14.680]  with this is that basically the whole town was evacuated and you had the fbi come in totally
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:19.640]  secretive not tell anybody what happened and then shut it down and everybody had these questions
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:24.200]  and i'm not encouraging this i'm just saying like this is the control that the federal government
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:29.000]  has see if i was in sunspot and i really wanted to know something about this i would gather up
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.720]  a hundred people and i would march in there and i'd say go ahead and try to stop me what are you
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:39.560]  going to do shoot me what are you gonna do arrest me fine arrest me so so what are they hiding so
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:44.040]  see that's the point that's why you take action these people in government think that they own you
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:50.360]  because you won't take action they just have to show up and say sit down and you sit well i don't
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:58.600]  sit i stand i bark i bite so my point is that it's just like and who knows what happened maybe
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:03.560]  there was some sort of secret lab and and some you know disease got out and they had to shut the
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:08.920]  whole thing down well why won't you tell us but anyway there was there was a big uh conspiracy
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:16.040]  over that now again we're just finishing lighthearted you probably saw the story on drudge uh tom brady
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:21.320]  apparently has had enough of bill belichick according to a new book yeah yeah tom brady's had

[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:35.800]  having to sell their property that's been on the riverfront here for a long time
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.520]  they have just published a story that kody wilson the maker of the 3d the 3d printable gun
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:45.720]  now sexual assault he's been accused of sexual assault you accuse everyone of sexual assault
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:49.080]  now so how am i supposed to take any of it seriously especially after what you've done
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:55.000]  to kavanaugh but then i i realized something and i get this is low brow okay and and we aren't
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.960]  like this but we really 110 we have to start using their tactics against them folks so basically
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:05.000]  here's the story you so nowadays you can call up the austin statesman you can call up the new
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.840]  york times you can call up the washington post you can make a claim of sexual assault
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:14.760]  they'll believe it they'll report on it so i think conservatives need to call in to washington post
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:19.640]  new york times austin american statesman and just alleged that a democrat raped him just
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:25.400]  alleged see if they report say you know i i was at a party that chuck schumer was that and i got
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:29.640]  a little too drunk you know and i don't remember what happened but he was there and i'm pretty sure
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:34.840]  he he maybe have allegedly it could have happened that he sexually assaulted me and just flood him
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:41.480]  with calls just just flood him with calls just use their own weapons of propaganda and lies against
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:47.240]  them now a lot of people are asking in the midst of this censorship what can i do to help info wars
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:54.600]  what can i do to help alex jones so upon hearing this message alex jones wanted to deliver this
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:35:00.520]  message to you to let you know how you can support the info wars and how you can support alex jones
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:06.520]  while they're trying to destroy him there's a referendum on free speech here if you take this

[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:29.640]  the articles if you email them out if you text family and say hey this is the forbidden alex jones
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:34.440]  find out why it's forbidden see what he's really saying they're coming for all our speech it will
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:44.280]  be a chain reaction and the globalist will fail if you don't they are going to win and they think
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:48.360]  you're stupid and then that's going to happen i don't think you're stupid and i see trump
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:52.920]  moving against them i see the awakening i see all these employees at high level quitting google
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:57.160]  and apple and exposing it and i think humanity is going to find its conscience again and we're
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:03.800]  going to turn this around i want to change the world i don't want to just sit here and submit
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:09.240]  the system and i know that you're the same and i believe in you so i want to thank you all no
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:12.920]  matter what color you are where you came from or you know what you look like if you have your heart
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:18.200]  loves freedom and you love justice we're all in this together and we're facing real 21st century
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:26.280]  authoritarianism now in closing just like our information is game changing our products are
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:31.320]  game changing and survival still next to is the pure iodine no one else has this from deep earth
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:38.760]  crystals between 7 to 12 000 feet it's very hard for me to get this product uh it sometimes there's
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:46.440]  major shortages it has 6126 reviews 4.9 stars on power reviews no other product on their side has
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:54.520]  that it's that amazing it's the good halogen you must have iodine in your body it is essential
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:37:04.440]  and it's just like air it's just like oxygen it's just like the basic building blocks but
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:09.720]  instead they hammer you with the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromine and about seven other
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:17.160]  things that literally fog you fill all your cells your thyroid you name it and a lot of people
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:21.960]  when they go on x2 have dramatic effects some of them have a detoxing at three weeks so talk
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:27.880]  to your healthcare provider your practitioner it is an element and the government in the 30s there
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:32.440]  were so many million retarded people in low IQs typically in the midwest because there was not
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:39.240]  enough iodine in the fields and they weren't eating seafood that there were massive IQ reductions
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:45.400]  all sorts of genetic disorders so they mandated a low grade foreignry put in salt IQs then went up
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:49.640]  on average 15 points according to federal studies uh burnt effects went way down that is a fact
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:57.400]  since the 70s they pulled it out and they hammer you with the bad stuff the fluoride
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:02.840]  the chlorine the hydrofluorosalistic acid you name it for yourself for your children for everybody
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:08.520]  take it slow take a half dose in my view that's my personal view you know they demonize me selling
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:12.600]  toothpaste is fluoride free they demonize me saying fluoride's bad for you it's a load of crap they
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:16.840]  they say i'm evil david hog says he sells water filters and claims you should filter your water
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:22.920]  well an idiot wouldn't filter their water the point is is that the globalists don't want you
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:28.520]  protecting yourself so survival shield x2 is amazing uh we're over a barrel with the oil
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:33.160]  companies that get between six and twelve thousand feet so i've there's no contract now for this this
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:37.640]  when i say it's the last run i think it'll be six months a year until we get more i hope we get
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:43.480]  more this is the last run it looks like survival shield x2 at m4store.com rem4slife.com or triple
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:50.680]  a 2533139 bio true selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage selenium is an electrochemical
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:58.920]  it's needed as well in all activity in the body particularly uh neurons so these go incredibly
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:03.320]  well together we have a combo of those just experience it for yourself why do you think
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:09.800]  they fear me so much very simple stuff filter your water yeah i find myself selling water filters
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:16.600]  the best out there for the price alexa pure all of it the globals are so deceptive david hogs like
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:22.280]  he manipulates he lies he he says filter your water then he says next buy my water filter no no
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:27.480]  i'm being a straight shooter alexa pure breeze pro pure or apples and oranges they both cut stuff
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:31.400]  out nine nine nine nine percent if you're not filtering you and your children's water you are
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:37.080]  insane you know about the glyphosates and the hundred plus million they just won one one black
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:43.480]  guy that got cancer from it you understand that cancer goes up multi thousand percent after
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:48.440]  glyphosates are used in crops the water table is filled with it and thousands of other chemicals on
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:55.800]  average so again ladies and gentlemen you need to go see that for yourself average 4.8 stars some
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:59.800]  of those products are new they have no no no reviews but they're already top reviewed elsewhere
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:06.040]  we buy whatever's top reviewed then discount it so survival shield x2 is really a game changer
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:12.200]  it's available at info or store.com but get the other products get brain force uh oh super
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:19.640]  male vitality it's cold pressed from known herbs and known organic compounds that don't

[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:57.160]  percent off until it sells out 50 percent off on super males for female vitality and we also
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:02.840]  have our alpha power that is amazing that's even stronger but it's it's from dry herbs not the wet

[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:40.600]  here's why we cannot let the democrats win in november here's why we have to get out and vote
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:49.320]  in november democrats will impose massive tax hikes if they win congress this is from the
[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:55.800]  washington examiner now get this trump cutting the taxes and everybody already knows that this is the
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:02.600]  this is the this is the case it's historical trump cut taxes record taxes have been received
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:10.040]  since trump cut them so you have record number of taxes coming in and that's the only way you
[01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:15.080]  could actually pay for this crap that that people like okasia courtes think that they can afford to
[01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:21.000]  pay for well it's ridiculous but unless you lower taxes so that people actually pay their taxes
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:27.240]  you're not going to be able to fund anything and they know that or do they know that are they really
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:35.400]  that dumb so trump cuts the taxes you have a record number of of tax dollars coming in
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:39.080]  and the democrats want to increase your taxes so it's just why
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:48.360]  why and they say oh this is to hurt the rich you think the rich give a damn about those taxes
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:53.000]  the rich are so rich they don't care about a tax most of them don't even pay it this only hurts
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:59.160]  the little guy and then the democrats say the tax cuts only help the rich no the tax cuts help the
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:04.920]  little guy who don't have all the money to begin with and so they can't afford to be taxed i mean
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:10.200]  it's just unbelievable the lying that goes on in the democrat party so please i mean just please god
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:17.160]  i can't deal they're gonna raise your taxes folks they're gonna try to impeach trump they're gonna
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:20.440]  bring back all these regulations they're gonna send everything to china they're gonna censor
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:25.320]  free speech they're gonna come after your guns they have to they have to go for the throat man
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:30.760]  they have to go for the death throat to kill america they are chinese agents
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:38.760]  it goes on this is ridiculous you know one thing trump hasn't really done at all is cut
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:44.680]  into the federal spending it just keeps increasing now granted there's more money coming in thanks
[01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:49.720]  to the tax cuts the deficit doesn't doesn't stop doesn't cease to exist and now the democrats
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:58.360]  have proposed what will be the richest and and and quickest funding of government you've ever seen
[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:05.800]  unprecedented government spending spree picks up speed hundreds of billions of dollars they're
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:12.520]  just they're just riding it off and the stories are all out there this is just one story from
[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:18.680]  nextgov.com that there's other stories that document the numbers it's just crazy but that's
[01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:24.520]  not even i mean you heard ocasio-cortez she she wants to have 40 trillion dollars there isn't
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:34.120]  even 40 trillion dollars in the world but that's what they want they want to tax you more and then
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:39.240]  they want to spend more but they don't understand the dynamic that every time you increase taxes
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:47.720]  less people pay and there's no i'm not even gonna go down that road but so they want to give you
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:53.480]  free health care well this story is from the medical express nearly half of resident physicians
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:58.680]  report burnout now what do you think is going to happen if you make health care free and everyone
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:06.440]  in their mom now that has a a a swollen big toe or a cough wants to go and get checked out by a doctor
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:11.960]  well there's going to be lines out the door the doctors are going to become burnout and then
[01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:16.520]  nobody's want to become a doctor and then you have no health care that's what the democrats want
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:24.600]  that's what happens in every socialist country so you already have doctors and physicians totally
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:29.320]  burnt out because you don't have enough of them and you have more sick people every day
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:36.440]  that don't even know how to heal themselves so they want to have more people showing up so that
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:41.000]  we have less physicians and less doctors and they're more burnout and then guess what they
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:48.200]  don't do is good of a job but but don't tell the left this basic breakdown of human psychology
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:57.560]  and economics because they'll call you a racist another way the democrat policy destroys this
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:04.280]  country this is from the hill today one in five us prison inmates is a criminal alien now what does
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:12.120]  that mean that means an undocumented illegal non-citizen illegal immigrant is in jail and also
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:19.000]  a criminal now that's not just the criminality of coming here legally that's committing actual
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:27.640]  crimes you know rape murder assault battery robbery grand theft auto you name it it's all there
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:33.960]  and one in five us prison inmates is is one of these criminal alien individuals do you
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:39.640]  understand how much that costs this country do you understand how much it costs to jail these people
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:47.880]  why do we have to jail these criminals that aren't even our own citizens you want to talk about
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:53.960]  deport why don't we deport them why don't we find out where they're from and kick them out
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:56:00.840]  i'm done paying for them i'm done paying for them tell you what you want me to pay for every kid
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:04.920]  that the mom pays for to come across this border illegally you want me to pay for their life you
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:09.720]  want me to pay for their shelter you want me to pay for everything tell you what maybe i'll consider
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:16.120]  that if i'm done paying for these criminals that are here illegally how about that you want to propose
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:20.120]  that you want to you want to bring some common sense to your virtue signaling you want to bring
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:26.440]  some condom condom sense common sense to your social justice warrior movement here kick out
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:32.760]  the one in five us prison inmates that are a criminal alien take the billions of dollars
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:37.480]  we'll save from jailing these people feeding these people sheltering these people you know giving
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:43.880]  them whatever psychological treatment they need to cut that spending give that spending to the
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:49.000]  children you want a virtue signal for every day which they already have anyway the kids that come
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:54.520]  across the border illegally have better facilities than american public schools just go look at
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:57:00.920]  kandace owens video she goes and documents this oh but they won't talk about that there's no common
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:06.600]  sense left in our government ladies and gentlemen but but is it really the government is there any
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:17.240]  common sense left anywhere anymore does this is common sense dead i mean maybe not dead but
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:29.400]  maybe it's close i mean if you don't understand how this works basic economics if you don't
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:34.200]  know i mean but it's not it goes beyond that they claim everyone who comes up politically
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:40.280]  is a rapist and they expect you to believe it like like you have no brain like yeah we can
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:44.760]  just make an accusation no due process we don't even we can even admit we don't know it's true but

[01:59:53.880 --> 02:00:21.960]  how many different books have they published that we're supposed to bring down trump i mean i i can't
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:26.840]  even remember them all off the top of my head you had file and fire and fury by uh michael somebody
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:31.880]  you had amorosa's book what was even the title i don't even know
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:41.000]  and now you have bob woodward's book which again i don't even know the title just so so
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:46.680]  they were all supposed to bring down trump they were all exposed to be such damning exposés of
[02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:52.280]  trump and his cabinet oh it's the end of the trump administration we got them thank you amorosa
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:58.920]  thank you fire and fury thank you bob woodward and that's how they report it and then the next day
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:06.680]  bubkus nothing now they talked about this on c-span so they're finally recognizing that their fake
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:13.080]  books aren't working how they intended and they they they they scratch the surface here in the
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:18.040]  c-sans segment i'll tell you what the real reason these books are failing but listen to the c-span
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:26.120]  segment why uh bob woodward's book flopped good morning mr woodward i'm about two-thirds of the
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:31.800]  way through your book and i'm enjoying it very much it's very vivid and it's a really great picture
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:38.200]  of the white house i had a question i hate using the word but i had a question about collusion namely
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:45.240]  that a number of conservative calmness have been saying that your book's absence of discussion
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:52.360]  of collusion is somehow exculpatory and i just wanted to know what your position was and all
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:58.440]  things on that matter or if the book was even intended to cover that angle well it it's covered
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:06.920]  in uh in a way uh what i've said is i found no new evidence of collusion uh there is some out there
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:13.000]  on the record publicly some of the reporting done by my own newspaper the washington post the new
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:22.360]  york time no uh but uh i found no new evidence uh but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist in fact uh
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:30.360]  president trump's a lawyer for 18 months john dowd concluded that moeller had something that he was
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:39.640]  not telling uh john dowd about in the meetings that dowd had uh with moeller the other point on this
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:49.880]  i think and it's critical uh the real answer to collusion is in russia and uh oh as a reporter
[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:57.880]  if i went there i almost certainly would not come back uh you can't operate uh in russia
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:05.400]  uh united states intelligence agencies do and they produce that initial report concluding
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:14.760]  that russia was meddling in the 2016 presidential election it's going to be very interesting to
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:21.720]  see if those intelligence agencies or the special counsel moeller come up with anything
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:28.920]  somebody get this guy a cup of coffee intelligence based from uh russia but that's and is he done
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:36.040]  yet jeez the answer is going to come from i believe is he done
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:47.240]  who that was brutal good god that guy's boring bob woodward so think about this though bob woodward
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:50.440]  is sitting here basically like i don't want to commit to russian collusion there's some evidence
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:55.880]  out there but i don't want to commit to it this is the man who claims a guy came out of a coma
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:04:07.160]  to talk to him for for 10 minutes and then died no folks the real reason the real reason why bob
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:11.560]  woodward's book failed in washington the real reason why these books fail in washington even
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:16.280]  despite all the publicity these people get millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:21.960]  worth of publicity and the books still fail you know why because they're not real alex jones
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:27.080]  goes to washington dc for one day and is more effective and gets more hype than their books
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:34.440]  did because he's real so a fake bob woodward book i mean that guy that guy's lammer than a
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:45.720]  uh than a tree stump i mean what that's an empty that's an empty glass of water

[02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:22.920]  owin shroyer well joey gibson has became a uh a target of the left and the democrats because
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:29.320]  he supports free speech he wants to get into government and he takes action and he organizes
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:35.240]  and that is what the left hates and he's american and he's proud to be one gibson for freedom dot
[02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:42.360]  com is his website of course the patriot prayer group the patriot prayer marches is where you
[02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:48.120]  have really seen his work flourish where he gets thousands of people to come out here as patriots
[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:53.560]  which really just exposes the vitriol and the disgust of the left that that they would hate
[02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:58.280]  these people that are that are really of all walks of life all different backgrounds just coming
[02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:05.000]  together for america and so joey joins me now to talk about another event that the patriot prayer
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:10.120]  group has organized and that is the free alex jones rally which is this saturday september 22nd
[02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:16.360]  one p.m at wolridge square park uh joey you are attending this but but what made you think of this
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:23.000]  and um and um what are people saying in your circle from patriot prayer about this rally coming up
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:29.560]  well everyone close to me and patriot prayer is really excited but one of the main reasons why I
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:35.640]  did it is obviously patriot prayers you know all of us are huge free speech advocates um and we've
[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:39.960]  kind of seen the way that we've been treated both by people on the the right and the left people
[02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:45.080]  are afraid to stick up for us i noticed that when the pressure started coming down on alex
[02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:51.400]  jones they didn't see the support from conservatives that i would have expected it seems like um people
[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:56.360]  are you know it's easy to kind of just turn your back on him because there's so much pressure on him
[02:07:57.240 --> 02:08:02.440]  and so he saw him and stuck his neck out for all of us all these years he's really inspired me so
[02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:06.920]  i'm really excited to go down there and to just you know support him and to to stand against the
[02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:12.520]  elitists who are trying to censor us now of course you know you you've organized other prayer groups
[02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:16.920]  and other prayer marches and patriot marches and you get attacked a lot from the left are you
[02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:21.480]  expecting you know some some leftist groups or or antifa or something to show up and try to disrupt
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:27.880]  this absolutely we're gonna see it you mean it's your town you've seen it too you've seen the the
[02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:34.280]  the red guard and antifa another group so obviously we expect that um and one thing that i've had
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:39.480]  except for that one time when they were blocking you with their guns and the police are standing
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:43.480]  there and watching for the most part i've seen the police do their job um but we're definitely
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:47.960]  prepared for the worst definitely prepared for them to come and attack us um it's just i guess
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:52.520]  that's part of free speech these days it's what you got to do well and you know i'd like to give a
[02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:56.760]  message to them and this this really genuinely comes from the heart and joey i've met you you
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:09:02.920]  know you're the same way you know we we we take up this political battle because we want to fight
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:07.320]  for the future and we see where this country was going so so there was no option for us to do this
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:14.680]  but you know beneath the political layers and complications and you know all of the stuff that
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:20.440]  we deal with and the mud slinging honestly we're just we're just normal guys we like hanging out
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:24.840]  with people we like just kicking back we you know we like just you know hanging out having a good
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:29.640]  time chopping it up whatever and and and i just i just want to tell that these these antifa guys
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:35.160]  that always come out the red guard everything it's like hey guys look let's let's just one time i mean
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:39.720]  you really want to fight fascism this is your opportunity it's fascists that are silencing
[02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:45.240]  alex jones right now it's it's the fascist at google and apple and facebook and twitter they're
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:50.840]  the one silencing free speech they're the fascist so just for one day joey i i i mean this from the
[02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:55.960]  from the bottom of my heart just just one time and then and then we can go back of being the heel
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:10:01.320]  versus the good guy and doing the wwe thing but just one day if you really wanted to fight fascism
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:06.360]  come out and join our side once against fascism alex jones is just one man in texas this is the
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:11.480]  establishment this is silicon valley these are the fascists so so joey that's that's my plea
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:17.160]  to antifa and everything let's all come together as anti-fascists to to fight the fascism at google
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:22.120]  and apple and facebook so so i mean i don't know maybe it's just me but i'm genuinely saying this
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:27.320]  from the bottom of bottom of my heart i bet we could get along with these people outside of the
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:32.120]  mudslinging of politics but but that's my message joey do you have a message you'd like to give
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:37.960]  to the protesters that may be planning on coming out sure sure so let me ask you a question first
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:42.520]  amendment free speech second amendment you know the right to elwin carrey farm these are two things
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:48.120]  that both info wars and patriot prayer and many groups stand up for to me there's nothing more
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:53.320]  anti-fascist than that i want to know what did hitler think about the first amendment what did
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:58.920]  he think about free speech did he respect free speech of course not did he respect the second
[02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:03.720]  amendment the right for people to elwin carrey farms of course if you're not these are two fundamental
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:11.000]  rights and for freedom in america the constitution that is truly anti-fascist so yeah if you're
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.320]  somebody who has been brainwashed to believe that we are the fascists when in fact what we're doing
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:21.160]  is truly anti-fascist come out and join us hey let's have a beer let's have a good time i mean
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:26.680]  we just like to enjoy life enjoy our freedoms and just enjoy being americans that's all we're trying
[02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:31.800]  to do but like you said on we had no choice but to do this otherwise they're just going to continue
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:36.520]  to increase their powers in the government we're allowed these elitists who own all these huge
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:43.000]  corporations to dictate what we can or cannot say on the internet so we we didn't really have a choice
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.480]  it's not like we love doing this kind of like we like being assaulted you know constantly
[02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:51.480]  receiving all the hate we get all the time but we're going to keep doing it until the mission
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:56.680]  is accomplished well and here's the other thing too there's a lot of people that have been victimized
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:02.360]  by this fascism at google and and facebook and youtube and and and apple you know a alex jones
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:06.440]  and info wars is obviously the big case you know it's the elephant in the room it's kind of the
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:10.440]  test case but you know a lot of people have been banned from youtube a lot of people have been banned
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:15.080]  from twitter i know you've been hit with censorship at some levels too so it's also an opportunity to
[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:20.280]  say hey look what they're doing to alex jones they also did to me what they're doing to alex
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:26.920]  jones they'll also do to you and so this is kind of the the the issue here too is that you know
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:31.560]  we're standing up for alex jones because we're standing up for free speech but but overall
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:39.080]  alex jones we're all alex jones at this point yeah absolutely well it's kind of like you look at
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:43.880]  the people on the far left or the left or whatever i would do anything to protect their right to
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:48.840]  free speech too because i'm not afraid of it i'm not afraid of anything that anybody has to say
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:54.360]  at any point because i believe in just the free flow exchange of ideas we don't all have to conform
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:13:00.200]  and so my question is what is it about these huge corporations like facebook youtube twitter
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:06.360]  what is it about these giant corporations that that that hate the conservative speech because
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:11.320]  it's not a moral issue it's not like they think that conservatives are evil or everything they say
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:16.040]  is hateful like they're seriously afraid of the things that we say and the reason why i think that
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:22.680]  is because those who are rich though the elitists they always benefit from a huge government so of
[02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:26.280]  course they're going to want to continue to get democrats in office because they'll increase the
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:31.240]  size of the government which benefits the the corporations who sit at the top always because
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:35.880]  they get all the tax loopholes they get all the regulations get our hold down the small business
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:40.040]  and these corporations pretty much own our government already because they have so much money
[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:45.320]  and so i just want people to to look beyond their own political ideology and begin to think about
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:50.360]  fundamental freedoms that we need in this country it is not about right versus left it's not democrat
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:56.120]  versus republican it's about the constitution and your right to just simply speak and say what you want
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:04.280]  see we are the actual rebels like we are the actual badasses like we're the ones actually
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:09.800]  fighting the establishment but there's this weird optical illusion that because we don't dress like
[02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:15.560]  pirates or because we don't you know clad ourselves in black hoodies and masks and act like total
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:21.080]  degenerates no no but i'm serious about this like we're actually doing this like you know with class
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:24.760]  you know we're trying to use the tools of the internet to wake people up we're trying to be
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:30.680]  loving we're praying for people like like so we're we're really actually badass rebels you know
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:34.360]  revolutionaries fighting the establishment but because we don't have like an eye patch and a
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:38.360]  wooden leg and like a hook leg arm or something you know they assume that we're the bad guy
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:47.480]  yeah absolutely and people people who know me know this but i have gone out of my way
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:53.320]  to do everything that i can to stay respectful even to those who spit in my face and i'm doing that
[02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:57.320]  on purpose you know there's a reason why i don't fight there's a reason why i take beatings like
[02:14:57.320 --> 02:15:01.880]  because i really want to raise the hearts and minds of the american people but in reality we
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:07.400]  are part of this weird revolution but people like you said you know people don't see us that way
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:12.120]  because we don't because we dress nice are we dressed like normal people yeah we don't go out we don't
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:18.760]  go out and burn the city down yes yes and we got we have jobs we have families we have a life and
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:23.240]  the thing that people don't understand is there's a lot of us who sacrifice so much in this movement
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:28.040]  whether or not how much we've accomplished is another conversation you know another debate but
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:33.000]  a lot of us have lost a lot you know because we truly believe in this and i think that's you know
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:36.840]  people can really look into our hearts and see what we're trying to do here and we're really just
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:41.720]  trying to wake people up and that's what alex jones did for me he woke me up i remember the first
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:46.360]  thing i ever did is i went to his rally down in cleveland well let's talk about the upcoming rally
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:50.440]  let's talk about the upcoming rally we're going to break here but but but exactly that's it we'll
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:55.080]  sacrifice we'll sacrifice anything because we realize we'll lose everything if we don't

[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:10.760]  and that and so i've broken my contract and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:15.640]  that goes in next to it that literally is so pure that if you put in a peaker dish on top of 90 degree
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:21.400]  hot plate it gasses like i dream of genie and it's purple gas i mean that is so pure it just goes
[02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:26.440]  right into your body when you take it we're working on trying to go to suppliers right now but i bought
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:32.360]  a huge amount of it ordered it six months ago so i get the price down i said if you don't lower it
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:37.560]  i'm done i'm breaking the contract well i broke the contract last week and so this is potentially

[02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:57.960]  uh what other uh what other people are going to be there joey we got quite a few locals
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:21:01.720]  through me speaking we have people from the pacific northwest who are flying over like
[02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:08.600]  as in tiny and in brufio we got a couple big name uh people who wait wait is tiny hold on is tiny
[02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:14.120]  going to be doing a dance because he's a great dancer if you guys want to do a dance he'll do
[02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:20.760]  it he'll be more than happy to he's a big man but he's a good dancer well he's he has a history of
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:25.560]  doing some worship dancing if you guys have ever heard of that and so he's he's got a lot of talent
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:30.920]  for a big guy um but yeah we have quite a few uh you know speakers that i think it's going to be a
[02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:36.840]  great rally it's going to be an awesome march like i said before from my experience and you know when
[02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:41.880]  you can talk about this if you want the police for the most part seems to um they take their
[02:21:41.880 --> 02:21:46.600]  job serious down there it's nothing like portland um so i'm really excited to get out there just
[02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:52.040]  to make sure our message is hurt well yeah i mean i'll say right now i mean of the probably i would
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:59.800]  say hundreds at this point of you know scenarios or or run-ins or you know whatever you want to
[02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:06.840]  say experiences i've had with police and also with apd 99 positive i would say i had one time
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:10.600]  where there was an officer that was a little rude to me but it was after one of the one of the
[02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:15.480]  bombings that happened so it was you know a tense situation i don't hold it against him uh and then
[02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:20.120]  like you said there was a situation where these guys were blocking me with guns uh from going into
[02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:24.280]  the park which was a little strange i guess the officers felt like there was no real threat there
[02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:30.200]  but uh other than that i actually consider apd to be to be some of the best people uh they really do
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:34.680]  care about their jobs i mean it's tough out there on them to to deal with this crap i understand that
[02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:39.960]  but um they they they they do their job the best that they can and the people i talked to were always
[02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:44.440]  nice like you said when you go up to portland until until the last rally i mean they pretty much let
[02:22:44.440 --> 02:22:51.240]  these people just just run rough shot but the last time they shut them down that wasn't that amazing
[02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:56.600]  that was like one of the weirdest things where you have these these like radical communists in
[02:22:56.600 --> 02:23:00.840]  the streets right and then for the first time ever it for me it was like history the first time ever
[02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:05.800]  you have the police doing their job and then the crowd of people behind them chanting usa like that
[02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:12.280]  was wild yeah that was awesome that was a beautiful day and it finally we put the pressure on portland
[02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:17.640]  mayor and a portland police you know to actually do their job and um they cleared the streets and
[02:23:17.640 --> 02:23:22.200]  they gave them several warnings so it's like i mean what else do you want us to do about it but
[02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:26.600]  um yeah so we'll see what happens down awesome but i think my suggestion to people especially
[02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:32.120]  if you're local if you're from the austin area or within a decent driving area i think that we all
[02:23:32.120 --> 02:23:37.560]  need to to do what we can you know to give back to info wars all of you guys alex including you
[02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:42.600]  too oan um you know you guys have put in a lot of work a lot of effort to really change this country
[02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:47.800]  um and so i think a lot i know a lot of people feel that way they're just a little hesitant to
[02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:51.880]  express that out in the public i think right now it's a good time to kind of pay back and
[02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:55.960]  and to just go down there out in the public unafraid unapologetically just say thank you
[02:23:55.960 --> 02:24:00.520]  and support free speech in the constitution well let me just tell you something the the real
[02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:05.160]  payback the real paying of it forward is taking action and that's what you guys are doing and
[02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:09.880]  then that's why this is so key because it's it's it's one thing and you know this isn't this
[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:13.880]  isn't a slight but people call in they say you know thank you alex god bless you alex and that's
[02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:18.120]  great we love you guys you know that's that's awesome you pray for us but but the real way to
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:22.840]  pay it forward the real way to show your respect for alex jones is to be alex jones to go out into
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:26.680]  the real world to organize something to take action and so that's why i salute you that's why
[02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:30.920]  i salute the patriot prayer group for organizing this event which is this saturday organizing the
[02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:34.600]  other event that you guys have done i know you're not going to stop after this i'm sure you've got
[02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:39.400]  other stuff uh that that you plan on coming up here too but you know it's funny wolrd square park
[02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:44.280]  did you actually know that was the location where antifa was blocking me from going in with guns
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:51.800]  yeah yeah i told yeah i recognize it i i watched that video probably like 10 times so i completely
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:55.880]  recognize it so i mean that's i'm excited to go down there i would like to see these guys try to
[02:24:55.880 --> 02:25:00.280]  block us i would like to see them threaten us with their weapons you know just expose them for who
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:04.520]  they are they probably never shot those guns before though so we can kind of teach them how to use
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:08.280]  them and how to clean them and stuff so like i said we can come together and help each other out
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:12.840]  we'll teach them how to use guns but see but that's what i'm saying too like okay like go back that
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:17.560]  the b-roll guys that's what i'm saying because we don't show up dressed like that it's like we're
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:22.520]  you know we're not considered rebels or revolutionaries or like fighters right it's like we have to show
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:27.560]  up dressed like you know whatever and then want to burn down buildings or something if we want to be
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:32.760]  considered fighting the establishment when no we're fighting the establishment with with intellect
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:37.160]  we're fighting the establishment with ideas we don't need to dress up we don't need to destroy
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:43.560]  stuff and so if not for one day again well if not for one day if you want to fight fascism
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:48.440]  there is no greater example than what's happening at google there's no greater example than what's
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:51.720]  happening at apple what's happening at youtube what's happening at facebook what's happening at
[02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:57.080]  twitter so if antifa will show up and if you guys even want to do your thing with the masks whatever
[02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:03.640]  i guess but but let's fight fascism together so so once again joey gibson here gibsonforfreedom.com
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:09.400]  we're genuinely saying look let's come together for one day like a wwe revolution the heels and
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:15.080]  the heroes come together one day to actually fight fascism like actually fight vince mcman
[02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:18.920]  or something like that let's let's see if we can actually do that wouldn't that be next level joey
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:24.520]  absolutely i would love it and i'll be more more than glad to participate in that too
[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:29.240]  you know we can have a great day and so that's what i'm really looking forward to it's just
[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:32.760]  it's just exposing them for who they are and if they want to come and join us like
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:38.040]  we're really nice people like in portland you know i march into their group when they start yelling
[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:42.040]  cussing and assaulting they come in our group with their hands up and we just around them and
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:46.120]  just start talking like like what are you doing like we're not going to attack you just don't
[02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:50.760]  throw punches you can come in our crowd and talk to us like we're really nice people just don't
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:55.880]  attack us yeah you're you had a couple of your buddies that were getting off a bus that was kind
[02:26:55.880 --> 02:27:00.600]  of on the other side of the the the issue that day and what happened immediately they get off the
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:05.240]  bus they get jumped uh you know one of them was a latino individual you know so they don't really
[02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:09.320]  they really don't care but but and then they act people who had nothing to do with the rally they
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:14.520]  attacked democrats because they had a flag on on his shirt and these guys didn't really like us but
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:19.400]  now they want to join us and then they attack the bernie supporter who went there to protest us
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:23.720]  because the bernie supporter was carrying an american flag and so they knocked him out
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:27.960]  so these guys they don't understand they're just they're hating they're attacking everybody they
[02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:33.240]  disagree with it's not a right versus left thing it's just it's like right versus wrong is what it is
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:37.320]  yeah no that that's true and that was powerful again like you said there were people that came
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:41.160]  over to our side that just talked to us and you know ended up okay you guys aren't as bad as I
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:45.160]  thought but again you go over to their side you're probably gonna get jumped you know spit on something
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:50.920]  thrown at you so that's just like you said that's how we show what is really behind these people
[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:55.160]  that's how we show what really goes on here joey Gibson Gibson for freedom.com thank you so much

[02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:36.200]  hesitation let's go to the statement from the press secretary of the white house

[02:33:42.280 --> 02:33:47.000]  president has directed the office of the director of national intelligence and the department of
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:54.200]  justice including the fbi to provide for the immediate declassification of the following materials
[02:33:54.200 --> 02:34:03.800]  one pages 10 to 12 and 17 to 34 of the june 2017 application to the fiza court in the matter of

[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:32.840]  to the russia investigation without redaction of james komi andrew mccabe peter stroke lisa page
[02:34:32.840 --> 02:34:43.240]  and bruce or now for a media in this country the western media to obsess over russian collusion
[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:48.120]  for three years to say russian collusion is the biggest thing to say it's treason we're at war
[02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:52.200]  with russia trump is literally a russian agent putin's in his ear and you've heard it you've heard
[02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:59.240]  it all total insanity they committed to it trumps a russian agent they can't sweep it under the rug
[02:34:59.240 --> 02:35:02.600]  and act like it was just some tongue-in-cheek thing even though that's what it was and that's
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:15.240]  what they're trying to do but now via this request to declassify that information and those text
[02:35:15.240 --> 02:35:23.000]  messages we're going to actually get something real about russia we're going to actually get
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:30.280]  something real about russian collusion we're going to actually get some fruit from the quote
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:35.160]  unquote russian investigation so for the first time we're actually about to get something from it
[02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:46.600]  and what does the media say he can't do that we can't have that wait a second you're the ones that
[02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:52.600]  made the story up you're the ones that made the story viral you're the ones that spied on trump
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:58.520]  now we're actually about to get something to see what was going on and what is the american media
[02:35:58.520 --> 02:36:03.960]  on the left say we don't want that you can't do that how dare trump he's out of control that's
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:10.360]  illegal well what i thought we wanted the truth about russia i thought we wanted to know what
[02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:14.840]  happened with russian collusion i guess they really don't want to know do they because you
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:18.520]  want to know what this is going to prove ladies and gentlemen that we already know that's already
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:24.200]  been proven it's going to make the democrats look like total liars and phonies and it's going to
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:34.360]  expose the obama administration for illegally spying not just on president trump but on dozens if not
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:42.280]  hundreds if not thousands of americans that's what this is going to expose and obama will be guilty
[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:48.040]  of high crimes and the democrats and the media will look like jackasses for acting like trump was
[02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:55.400]  the bad guy acting like the spy gate was fake news when they promoted russia gate which was fake news
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:37:03.560]  total devastation and so trump comes out and says this is from the hill
[02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:11.080]  trump says exposing corrupt fbi probe could be crowning achievement of presidency well let's
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:19.160]  hope it's just the beginning i would like to see his crowning achievement be putting people in jail
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:28.200]  like hillary clinton and all of her cohorts that to me would be the crowning achievement
[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:34.360]  actually draining the swamp by throwing them in jail all these people that are violating the hatch
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:43.640]  act we need to launch investigations into nancy pelosi into diane feinstein into maxine waters
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:51.080]  into chuck schumer into elizabeth warren into eric swalwell into adam schiff that would be the
[02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:55.720]  crowning achievement of trumps presidency and hopefully this is just the beginning exposing
[02:37:55.720 --> 02:38:01.480]  the corruption in the obama administration and the fbi but if that's where trump stops
[02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:07.480]  this that's a failure to me so hopefully that's not the crowning achievement and hopefully that's
[02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:19.640]  just the beginning so trump says president trump says without redaction we're going to release
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:25.960]  these documents without redaction alice jones and i went live uh monday night
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:32.280]  to talk about this and what did we tell you they're still going to redact it well here's the story
[02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:39.160]  from bloomberg fbi doj planned redactions despite trump's document order so they're just not doing
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:45.560]  doing their job they're breaking the law i mean can you imagine if alex jones came in here and
[02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:54.280]  said hey owen i need you to cover the info wars story that has our video of them smuggling drugs
[02:38:54.280 --> 02:38:58.680]  across the border and then i'm and then i come in here and i say you know what i'm not gonna i'm
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:05.000]  not gonna cover that i'm gonna cover this story over here well what would happen to me i'd be
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:13.800]  fired i'd be scolded not that alex jones tells me what to do the point is trump is their boss and
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:22.040]  tells them what to do and they directly disobey the order and they redact the documents just like
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:25.160]  we told you they do you can go back to the monday night broadcast we told you they were going to
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:30.040]  redact it anyway because that's all they do they're total disruptors they're total deceivers
[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:39.320]  they're total con men they're obstructionists they're criminals so this so that's fine so they'll
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:45.560]  redact it trump will get pissed and he'll just release all the documents so that's how that'll go
[02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:57.640]  up and then trump was in an interview with the hill dot tv and said that he doesn't have an
[02:39:57.640 --> 02:40:06.200]  attorney general so a shot across the bow of jeff sessions which basically is he says i don't have
[02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:11.880]  an attorney general it's very sad when asked about the the attorney general jeff sessions
[02:40:11.880 --> 02:40:20.040]  i mean where is jeff sessions what is jeff sessions doing why isn't sessions forcing them to
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:24.040]  redact these documents is he going to recuse himself from everything does he just recuse
[02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:35.960]  himself from his job where is jeff sessions look i hope that the q and on is right okay i hope that
[02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:40.520]  that they think there's like 50 000 indictments about to come out and they think sessions is
[02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:46.760]  behind all of them i hope that's right i i love fantasy land i i pray to god that that's right i'd
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:55.960]  love to live in a pipe dream but until that happens where is jeff sessions earth to jeff
[02:40:55.960 --> 02:41:03.000]  sessions we're drowning in corruption here the president is drowning with the fbi and and then
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:07.560]  all these other stay behind networks trying to destroy him undermine him they published it in
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:19.720]  the new york times where is jeff sessions where is he come on oh and haven't you heard q sessions
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:24.360]  is waiting he's got 50 000 indictments ready to come down there's like 20 000 of them in texas
[02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:31.960]  okay you know what i saw the south park episode of imagination land too it's one of my favorite
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:38.280]  episodes you sing a song and you go to imagination land and everything's real well until that day
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:45.800]  comes until i see 50 000 indictments until jeff sessions says i knew who joe biden was
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:50.360]  he tried to touch my granddaughter i saw the videos of joe biden in the white house groping
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:54.520]  women i saw the videos of joe biden grabbing children when they came in the white house
[02:41:54.520 --> 02:42:00.920]  i saw biden rubbing his lips against young kids necks in the white house i saw it i know who he
[02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:08.120]  is i've got the indictments until sessions does that until sessions does anything i'm not living
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:15.800]  in imagination land you understand again i hope q is right i would love it if there were 50 000
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:19.720]  indictments waiting to come down yeah here the crew is rolling all the all the the films of
[02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:24.360]  joe biden there's the famous one biden reaches down to try to touch sessions granddaughter
[02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:30.600]  and he slaps his hand away because everybody knows who biden is man oh man i just
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:39.720]  justice be done may the heavens fall man these pedophiles that they have to face justice
[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:47.480]  this cannot continue folks we we can't have people like laura sillsby and hillary clinton
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:51.480]  and jeff reyepstein working together smuggling children across the borders we can't have spirit

[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:30.360]  equine encephalitis eee a mosquito borne virus that can lead to lasting brain damage now you
[02:51:30.360 --> 02:51:36.520]  don't want these diseases coming here from overseas that's why you have a waiting program for immigration
[02:51:37.960 --> 02:51:42.120]  but you do have mosquitoes that carry disease like zika which was a big story but
[02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:48.840]  let me kind of pivot but stay in the same vein in a different direction
[02:51:48.840 --> 02:52:04.920]  now i gotta say researching bill gates it's one of the more confusing things to do to be quite
[02:52:04.920 --> 02:52:12.600]  honest with you because they do all this philanthropic work right and and then they do this stuff in
[02:52:12.600 --> 02:52:19.720]  africa and brazil where they introduce vaccines and they intro they drop mosquitoes and they claim
[02:52:19.720 --> 02:52:24.040]  it's for the good of mankind and they're trying to save people but then what happens in africa
[02:52:24.040 --> 02:52:30.760]  ebola breaks out what happens in brazil zika breaks out bill gates said himself he wants to
[02:52:30.760 --> 02:52:35.800]  get the population down to zero i mean that was his own ted talks so bill gates goes to africa
[02:52:35.800 --> 02:52:41.720]  ebola breaks out bill gates goes to brazil zika breaks out so so so as bill gates just just just
[02:52:41.720 --> 02:52:47.320]  unintentionally you know does he have a connection am i crazy to coincidence i mean come on folks
[02:52:47.320 --> 02:52:53.880]  and then he's gonna warn you about disease x when he says the population has to equal zero for us to
[02:52:53.880 --> 02:53:00.840]  save the planet from global warming now look bill gates knows it's total bs i broke this down in
[02:53:00.840 --> 02:53:07.000]  the war room yesterday bill gates wants you off the highway he doesn't just want you to get out of
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:12.440]  the way so that he can go in the fast lane he doesn't even want humans on the highway you get it
[02:53:15.960 --> 02:53:21.480]  so is it just a coincidence bill gates warns of a disease x global pandemic is it just a
[02:53:21.480 --> 02:53:27.400]  coincidence bill gates takes his vaccines and and his movement and his philanthropic efforts to
[02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:32.760]  africa and ebola breaks out is it just coincidence he takes his philanthropic efforts to brazil
[02:53:32.760 --> 02:53:39.800]  with mosquitoes and zika breaks out and then i forget which story it was it may have been in
[02:53:39.800 --> 02:53:44.360]  this story it was actually the one that was linked on drudge yesterday in the story
[02:53:47.800 --> 02:53:52.600]  he's his wife is interviewed and says yeah we we we oftentimes think about giving away at all
[02:53:52.600 --> 02:54:00.200]  all so here's bill gates worth hundreds of billions of dollars and does the left ever mention him as
[02:54:00.200 --> 02:54:06.760]  the one percent they cry about the one percent they never mentioned they never mentioned bill gates
[02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:18.280]  ladies and gentlemen the symbolism is right there for you to see windows operating system
[02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:27.560]  a window into your life apple a bite out of the apple when they teamed up with windows
[02:54:29.480 --> 02:54:31.880]  adam and eve fighting evil

[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:50.360]  oh where was this i love journalism these days they write a story they don't even tell you where
[02:54:50.360 --> 02:54:55.800]  the story takes place you ever notice that it's really amazing journalism is really dead in this
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:55:02.680]  country to be quite honest with you outside of um side of project veritas really i mean
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:07.560]  you could i mean we're journalists here in a sense that we just report on everything that's going on
[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:14.680]  on but like it's just amazing like writers in madagascar thank you guys it's like
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:19.880]  and i deal with this all the time i'll be reading a story and they don't even tell you where
[02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:24.120]  it's like i remember when i was in journalism school that was like number one they taught you
[02:55:24.120 --> 02:55:31.560]  that in high school google vows to fight us air pollution while censoring data on chinese smog
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:37.960]  yeah this is just like harrison forward telling you you're causing global warming you're causing
[02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:42.200]  man made climate change you're killing the planet you have to be stopped and then he hops on one of
[02:55:42.200 --> 02:55:49.160]  his 13 private jets to fly around for fun or or uh you know leonardo de caprio says you need to stop
[02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:53.080]  heating your house with a c you're killing the planet and then hops on his million dollar yacht
[02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:58.120]  and and jet sets around uh you know the pacific ocean or something just just just just more total
[02:55:58.120 --> 02:56:04.200]  fraud it's fine just more total fraud sony's airbow robo dog finally goes on sale in us you
[02:56:04.200 --> 02:56:09.320]  know it's whatever you can have a robo dog but but they're going to use this to to to make kids
[02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:15.960]  more inclined to interacting with robots and and digital interactions and and and then they'll
[02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:22.200]  have a robot friend like the gen six movie and you know then they'll upload themselves to a robot
[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:27.240]  so it's really just just look i'm not saying that this one but that's where this goes okay that
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:31.720]  that's that's where this goes where you don't even have a real dog you don't have the real even soul
[02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:36.600]  of a dog you you just get the fake robot dog and then and then that's what the kids are into now
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:43.880]  is just robots and fake stuff burton urney are oh here's what they're really into too burton urney

[02:59:45.480 --> 02:59:54.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:16.440 --> 03:00:26.440]  you
[03:00:31.320 --> 03:00:34.440]  need
[03:00:34.440 --> 03:00:54.000]  Well, back, I'm Roger Stone picking up the baton from my colleague Owen Shroyer.
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:01:00.080]  You can see Owen and I every day at five o'clock Eastern on the war room where we break it
[03:01:00.080 --> 03:01:06.560]  down for you and provide pithy political analysis and rabble rousing.
[03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:08.960]  I think I've now seen it all.
[03:01:08.960 --> 03:01:15.600]  You see, Hillary Clinton has come forward to say that the woman who has accused Brett
[03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:22.080]  Kavanaugh of assaulting her when they were both teenagers, a charge for which she has
[03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:29.560]  no evidence or corroboration or witnesses, Hillary Clinton now says this woman deserves
[03:01:29.560 --> 03:01:31.800]  to be believed.
[03:01:31.800 --> 03:01:33.520]  Really?
[03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:42.680]  Did Juanita Broderick deserve to be believed or Kathleen Willey or Paula Jones or dozens
[03:01:42.680 --> 03:01:50.960]  literally of other women who were sexually assaulted and worse by Bill Clinton?
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:58.800]  You see, as I document in my book, The Clinton's War on Women, this is the definitive oppo dump
[03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:03.520]  on Bill, Hillary, and their greedy little daughter, Chelsea.
[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:09.760]  Bill had a technique in which he would assault a woman and bite through her upper lip in
[03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:11.800]  order to disable her.
[03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:19.440]  This is not just reported by me, but also reported by NBC and the Washington Post.
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:25.840]  Three known instances, including Juanita Broderick whose book is famously titled, I'd put some
[03:02:25.840 --> 03:02:28.960]  ice on that if I was you.
[03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:38.160]  Bill Clinton, as I demonstrate, had a series of violent sexual assaults against women.
[03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:44.280]  Let's be clear, we're not talking about consensual sex, we're not talking about infidelities,
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:50.560]  we're not talking about indiscretions, we're talking about violence against women.
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:53.560]  Hillary Clinton is the enabler of this.
[03:02:53.560 --> 03:02:59.440]  She's the one who hires the heavy-handed private detectives and the mean lawyers to bludgeon
[03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:06.840]  these women, bully them, threaten them, surveil them, ensure that they do not come forward
[03:03:06.840 --> 03:03:12.760]  either to tell their story or to respond to government subpoenas.
[03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:20.920]  So Hillary Clinton, who runs for president as an advocate for women, is in fact a torturer
[03:03:20.920 --> 03:03:22.240]  of women.
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:30.640]  And now for her to say that this woman deserves to be believed or what then of her husband's
[03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:33.240]  multiple victims.
[03:03:33.240 --> 03:03:43.240]  It's an extraordinary day in Washington in terms of the ongoing hypocrisy of the left.
[03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:50.360]  Here you have, in this assault on Judge Kavanaugh, the second violation of one of the most basic
[03:03:50.360 --> 03:03:52.900]  of journalistic rules.
[03:03:52.900 --> 03:03:57.920]  They are printing an allegation without any second source.
[03:03:57.920 --> 03:04:01.600]  Now Judge Kavanaugh has a witness.
[03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:07.400]  There was another man who she identified as being present when this incident allegedly
[03:04:07.400 --> 03:04:11.360]  happened and he says it never went down.
[03:04:11.360 --> 03:04:19.680]  So this is a fake news cudgel that is now being used to try to delay and kill the nomination
[03:04:19.680 --> 03:04:21.800]  of Brett Kavanaugh.
[03:04:21.800 --> 03:04:27.840]  It's extraordinary that in the wake of the New York Times violating their ethic that
[03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:35.760]  they need not publish anonymous information, we have the second instance of the mainstream
[03:04:35.760 --> 03:04:41.080]  media pushing a narrative that is without for aberration.
[03:04:41.080 --> 03:04:42.560]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:04:42.560 --> 03:04:44.040]  You're at the Alex Jones show.
[03:04:44.040 --> 03:04:45.440]  We're at info wars.

[03:06:19.640 --> 03:06:27.560]  You know, last weekend was an extraordinary weekend for the forces of freedom.
[03:06:27.560 --> 03:06:30.320]  We had two terrific events.
[03:06:30.320 --> 03:06:37.320]  One was a conclave of the proud boys that was held in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[03:06:37.320 --> 03:06:41.680]  And the other was the mother of all rallies.
[03:06:41.680 --> 03:06:47.120]  I had originally planned to meet with the proud boys in Las Vegas.
[03:06:47.120 --> 03:06:53.920]  Unfortunately, due to a backup on a bridge, I missed my flight from Dulles International
[03:06:53.920 --> 03:07:00.200]  Airport to Las Vegas by minutes and therefore was stranded in DC.
[03:07:00.200 --> 03:07:05.200]  While walking through the lobby of a hotel that I had taken just to get a few hours sleep,
[03:07:05.200 --> 03:07:12.720]  I was reminded that the mother of all rallies was that very day down on the mall.
[03:07:12.720 --> 03:07:19.240]  And I had been asked to speak but had to decline because I thought I would be in Las Vegas
[03:07:19.240 --> 03:07:27.720]  with Gavin McGinnis and Milo Yiannopoulos and Jacob Engels and Tyler White and others
[03:07:27.720 --> 03:07:29.680]  in that important movement.
[03:07:29.680 --> 03:07:34.440]  By the way, the proud boys are not white supremacists.
[03:07:34.440 --> 03:07:36.600]  We are not neo-Nazis.
[03:07:36.600 --> 03:07:38.640]  We are not bigots.
[03:07:38.640 --> 03:07:41.080]  We are not haters.
[03:07:41.080 --> 03:07:45.160]  This is not a white supremacist sign.
[03:07:45.160 --> 03:07:46.640]  That's a lie.
[03:07:46.640 --> 03:07:50.520]  This means okay and always has.
[03:07:50.520 --> 03:07:57.040]  When we do this, we do not do it as a secret hand signal to white supremacists.
[03:07:57.040 --> 03:08:00.400]  I worked for the president who brought us affirmative action.
[03:08:00.400 --> 03:08:04.640]  I worked for the president who desegregated the public schools.
[03:08:04.640 --> 03:08:10.080]  I worked for the president who gave us the office of minority business enterprise.
[03:08:10.080 --> 03:08:16.400]  I worked for the president who insured passage of the 1958 Civil Rights Act, the first major
[03:08:16.400 --> 03:08:20.600]  piece of civil rights legislation after Jim Crow.
[03:08:20.600 --> 03:08:25.280]  And now I support the president who's brought African American unemployment to the lowest
[03:08:25.280 --> 03:08:27.280]  level in American history.
[03:08:27.280 --> 03:08:30.600]  So no, we reject white supremacy.
[03:08:30.600 --> 03:08:32.560]  We reject racism.
[03:08:32.560 --> 03:08:39.760]  Now, to the rally, I was walking through the lobby of my hotel and I saw a patriot wearing
[03:08:39.760 --> 03:08:44.720]  a MAGA hat who reminded me that the rally was that very day.
[03:08:44.720 --> 03:08:50.160]  I contacted those who had originally invited me in a range to go down to the mall.
[03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:51.160]  Here's a film clip.
[03:08:51.160 --> 03:08:53.320]  It was a great time.
[03:08:53.320 --> 03:09:01.480]  What's amazing to me is with the implacable opposition of the two-party duopoly that ran
[03:09:01.480 --> 03:09:08.880]  this country into the ground, the Bushes and the Clintons working together who gave us
[03:09:08.880 --> 03:09:15.320]  endless foreign war without our inherent national interests being clear, a stagnant
[03:09:15.320 --> 03:09:21.320]  economy where jobs were scarce and hard to find, immigration policies that leave our
[03:09:21.320 --> 03:09:28.320]  streets and neighborhoods safe, unsafe, trade policies that are good for our trading partners
[03:09:28.320 --> 03:09:37.840]  but suck the jobs out of America, a housing crisis, a student loan crisis.
[03:09:37.840 --> 03:09:46.240]  When they say Barack Obama was a great president, what the hell are they talking about?
[03:09:46.240 --> 03:09:52.280]  Here it is, one of the better moments from what was a terrific rally where I saw so many
[03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:57.560]  old friends and made so many new ones.
[03:09:57.560 --> 03:10:04.720]  I think it is important that those who support the president, those who are Republicans,
[03:10:04.720 --> 03:10:10.200]  those who are libertarians, those who are liberty-oriented recognize that we're facing
[03:10:10.200 --> 03:10:18.320]  an all-out assault to kill the flagship of this movement, that's infowars.com.
[03:10:18.320 --> 03:10:24.880]  In the 40 years I've been in American politics, I've never seen anything nearly as coordinated
[03:10:24.880 --> 03:10:29.320]  and transparent as the attempt to destroy Alex Jones.
[03:10:29.320 --> 03:10:39.400]  It is not coincidental that on one day Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, Apple and dozens others
[03:10:39.400 --> 03:10:42.760]  ban info wars in the Alex Jones show.
[03:10:42.760 --> 03:10:49.800]  It is not coincidental that after Mr. Jones goes to Washington and he goes into the lion's
[03:10:49.800 --> 03:10:56.160]  den to confront those who smear us in terms of our beliefs as the rationale for silencing
[03:10:56.160 --> 03:11:00.760]  us that Twitter bans him for life.
[03:11:00.760 --> 03:11:03.720]  Welcome to the club, Alex.
[03:11:03.720 --> 03:11:09.960]  It is important that everybody understand that this is the single most important fight
[03:11:09.960 --> 03:11:16.280]  facing conservatives today because without a voice we can have no impact on immigration
[03:11:16.280 --> 03:11:23.960]  issues or economic issues or foreign policy issues or any other issue or challenge facing
[03:11:23.960 --> 03:11:25.480]  the country.
[03:11:25.480 --> 03:11:32.400]  It is essential that Alex Jones' voice be preserved and that info wars continue as it
[03:11:32.400 --> 03:11:39.680]  is today as a beacon of accurate information, information you won't hear from the mainstream
[03:11:39.680 --> 03:11:40.680]  media.
[03:11:40.680 --> 03:11:42.960]  Now, there's a reason we can do this.
[03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:49.600]  You see, cable television has big multinational sponsors and if the people who are selling
[03:11:49.600 --> 03:11:54.800]  breakfast food that sponsor your show don't like what you're saying, well, you can't say
[03:11:54.800 --> 03:11:56.240]  it anymore.
[03:11:56.240 --> 03:12:01.680]  We have complete and total independence here at info wars because Alex Jones and his team
[03:12:01.680 --> 03:12:07.520]  have developed our own brand of various products and it is only through the profits made on
[03:12:07.520 --> 03:12:12.200]  those products that we subsidize what we do here at info wars.
[03:12:12.200 --> 03:12:19.120]  It guarantees our independence and it has to underwrite the cost of these multi-million
[03:12:19.120 --> 03:12:24.560]  dollar lawsuits that are launched at info wars simply to shut us down.
[03:12:24.560 --> 03:12:26.720]  Here's how it works.
[03:12:26.720 --> 03:12:30.880]  First you dig up a completely false allegation against Alex Jones.
[03:12:30.880 --> 03:12:35.040]  You distort what he did say or you take it out of context.
[03:12:35.040 --> 03:12:38.560]  Then you file a lawsuit around that fabrication.
[03:12:38.560 --> 03:12:45.040]  Then you take the headlines from that lawsuit's release and you take it to those who are arbiters
[03:12:45.040 --> 03:12:51.360]  of who will and will not be on social media and you have an insidious plot to kill info
[03:12:51.360 --> 03:12:52.560]  wars.
[03:12:52.560 --> 03:12:58.160]  I don't imagine that the days ahead are easy and easier as Alex Jones but that which does
[03:12:58.160 --> 03:13:00.840]  not kill us makes us stronger.
[03:13:00.840 --> 03:13:02.920]  So go to the info wars.com site now.
[03:13:02.920 --> 03:13:04.600]  Let's take a look at what we have up.
[03:13:04.600 --> 03:13:09.320]  Some extraordinary specials here and there is a difference.
[03:13:09.320 --> 03:13:17.000]  In other words, there are other male vitality formulas out there that you can get and they
[03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:20.040]  tend to have substandard ingredients.
[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:24.520]  They're overpriced and very few of them are effective.
[03:13:24.520 --> 03:13:31.720]  Here you have a combination of fusing of both ancient herbs from Chinese medicine along
[03:13:31.720 --> 03:13:40.800]  with cutting edge newly discovered nutraceuticals to build a formula that helps the libido,
[03:13:40.800 --> 03:13:45.560]  athletic performance, mental clarity and the works.
[03:13:45.560 --> 03:13:51.040]  I cannot recommend this highly enough and this is an incredible price.
[03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:54.760]  At Whole Foods you would pay more than our retail price.
[03:13:54.760 --> 03:14:02.240]  Today you can get this terrific product, super male vitality for $34.95.
[03:14:02.240 --> 03:14:08.240]  It's a steal I'm telling you and there you've got over 4,000 satisfied customers.
[03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:12.840]  So do yourself a favor and help keep us in the fight.
[03:14:12.840 --> 03:14:19.720]  Without your loyal support for the info wars.com store, Alex Jones' voice will literally seek
[03:14:19.720 --> 03:14:21.280]  to exist.
[03:14:21.280 --> 03:14:23.640]  Think of all the comedy that will be missing.
[03:14:23.640 --> 03:14:28.040]  No, we have to keep Alex Jones and info wars strong and vibrant.
[03:14:28.040 --> 03:14:34.120]  We must remain resolute in the face of these cyber bullies who would silence us.
[03:14:34.120 --> 03:14:40.440]  While you're at the store, get your copy of Stone's Rules, my new field guide for victory.
[03:14:40.440 --> 03:14:43.720]  No warrior will want to be without this book.
[03:14:43.720 --> 03:14:50.160]  You can get it now for $22.99 at the info wars.com store.
[03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:52.280]  This is different than my other books.
[03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:54.640]  It is a blueprint for victory.
[03:14:54.640 --> 03:15:02.240]  Whether you're in politics, business, tech, industry, agriculture, fashion, these are
[03:15:02.240 --> 03:15:09.360]  rules that work for everybody, men and women who want to move ahead in the game of life.
[03:15:09.360 --> 03:15:14.800]  We hear on the other side, we're going to be taking a hard look at Bob Woodward.
[03:15:14.800 --> 03:15:21.840]  We also have a very special video report for you about Eric Boling and the questions surrounding
[03:15:21.840 --> 03:15:22.840]  9-11.
[03:15:22.840 --> 03:15:24.920]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:15:24.920 --> 03:15:29.240]  I'm sitting in for Alex Jones and you're on info wars.
[03:15:29.240 --> 03:15:31.360]  We are the tip of the spear.
[03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:34.440]  We are the cutting edge of the revolution.
[03:15:34.440 --> 03:15:53.600]  We are the people the left is afraid of.
[03:15:53.600 --> 03:15:57.680]  Healthcare reform is confusing, but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan,
[03:15:57.680 --> 03:16:01.680]  keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare
[03:16:01.680 --> 03:16:04.320]  system has become a challenge.
[03:16:04.320 --> 03:16:07.880]  Call your own healthcare costs and choices with Liberty Health Share.
[03:16:07.880 --> 03:16:09.640]  Liberty Health Share is not insurance.

[03:16:13.520 --> 03:16:15.840]  the cost of each other's medical needs.

[03:16:52.640 --> 03:16:55.960]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.

[03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:09.320]  And the best relief for that pain is a sunny bay heating pad.
[03:17:09.320 --> 03:17:13.120]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways
[03:17:13.120 --> 03:17:15.680]  to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[03:17:15.680 --> 03:17:20.520]  Sunny bay heating pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work and

[03:17:25.080 --> 03:17:26.600]  Why take another pill?
[03:17:26.600 --> 03:17:30.760]  Many people use our sunny bay heating pads alone and got rid of the neck pain.
[03:17:30.760 --> 03:17:35.560]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.

[03:18:00.440 --> 03:18:01.800]  Life.
[03:18:01.800 --> 03:18:06.960]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially
[03:18:06.960 --> 03:18:13.120]  formulated prebiotic fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit
[03:18:13.120 --> 03:18:15.280]  and flax fiber.
[03:18:15.280 --> 03:18:20.400]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria which
[03:18:20.400 --> 03:18:25.880]  helps you digest food, absorb nutrients and even support your immune system.

[03:18:38.360 --> 03:18:45.240]  organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon
[03:18:45.240 --> 03:18:47.960]  for maximum prebiotic effect.
[03:18:47.960 --> 03:19:14.640]  Go to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:19:14.640 --> 03:19:26.680]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it
[03:19:26.680 --> 03:19:30.760]  ordered at 6 months ago, so I get the price down and I said if you don't lower it, I'm
[03:19:30.760 --> 03:19:32.000]  done, I'm breaking the contract.
[03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:36.480]  Well, I broke the contract last week, and so this is potentially the last run.
[03:19:36.480 --> 03:19:41.040]  In fact, right now it is the last run, so there's a viable shield X2, and we've got
[03:19:41.040 --> 03:19:42.040]  a good supply of it.
[03:19:42.040 --> 03:19:43.040]  It'll be gone a couple months.
[03:19:43.040 --> 03:19:47.480]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, infowarslife.com, if you have experienced it and how great
[03:19:47.480 --> 03:19:49.560]  it is, I suggest you stock up on it.
[03:19:49.560 --> 03:19:57.400]  It's available right now for a limited time, infowarslife.com is 25% off right now.
[03:19:57.400 --> 03:20:08.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:08.320 --> 03:20:15.320]  Bye for all Americans, let me make this perfectly clear, you're listening to Roger Stone on
[03:20:15.320 --> 03:20:16.320]  infowars.
[03:20:16.320 --> 03:20:46.280]  Last week, I reported here on the Alex Jones show,
[03:20:46.280 --> 03:20:53.400]  that sources told me that Donald Trump Jr. was in the crosshairs of special counsel Robert
[03:20:53.400 --> 03:21:00.400]  Mueller because he had lied to the FBI about the perfectly legal Trump Tower meeting.
[03:21:00.400 --> 03:21:05.760]  I now subsequently learned that that report was incorrect, although I believe that Mr.
[03:21:05.760 --> 03:21:11.960]  Mueller may still be looking at the president's son because he was one of a limited number
[03:21:11.960 --> 03:21:17.800]  of family members who had the authority to approve the payment from a family trust that
[03:21:17.800 --> 03:21:22.680]  went to Michael Cohen for the reimbursement of Stormy Daniels.
[03:21:22.680 --> 03:21:28.560]  But unlike CNN, where Carl Bernstein claimed that Cohen would tell federal investigators
[03:21:28.560 --> 03:21:32.760]  that Trump knew about that meeting in advance, something the president has always said is
[03:21:32.760 --> 03:21:37.600]  untrue, when we make an error on CNN, we correct it and quickly.
[03:21:37.600 --> 03:21:38.600]  And I did.
[03:21:38.600 --> 03:21:40.240]  Let's take a quick look.
[03:21:40.240 --> 03:21:46.320]  You would think that a real journalist would then go to the air and apologize, and retract,
[03:21:46.320 --> 03:21:47.320]  and correct.
[03:21:47.320 --> 03:21:54.080]  Well, that's the difference between CNN and Carl Bernstein and we here at Infowars.
[03:21:54.080 --> 03:22:01.400]  Case in point, I reported almost 10 days ago, incorrectly as it turns out, that Robert
[03:22:01.400 --> 03:22:10.000]  Mueller was seeking to indict Donald Trump Jr. for lying to the FBI about the Trump Tower
[03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:11.000]  meeting.
[03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:19.000]  I now know and want to report that that report was incorrect, that in fact the FBI, contrary
[03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:26.120]  to what my two sources told me, have not interviewed Donald Trump Jr.
[03:22:26.120 --> 03:22:33.200]  And there you have it, and again, our apologies to Donald Trump Jr.
[03:22:33.200 --> 03:22:35.440]  I particularly enjoy his Twitter feed.
[03:22:35.440 --> 03:22:44.280]  I think he is feisty and a combative and important supporter of his father's reform agenda.
[03:22:44.280 --> 03:22:52.280]  The big news, of course, in the political establishment is the attempt to use veteran journalist
[03:22:52.280 --> 03:23:03.840]  Bob Woodward as the battering ram to destroy the presidency of President Donald Trump.
[03:23:03.840 --> 03:23:11.320]  Woodward's publishers have published one million copies of his new book, in which even Woodward
[03:23:11.320 --> 03:23:17.720]  admits that after two years' investigation, he could find no evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:23:17.720 --> 03:23:19.560]  So he flipped the script.
[03:23:19.560 --> 03:23:26.840]  Now the theme of his book is that Trump is an unhinged madman, that he's a mentally
[03:23:26.840 --> 03:23:32.840]  unbalanced dummy who would blow up the world, except for the fact that he is restrained
[03:23:32.840 --> 03:23:40.120]  by a group of neocons who just happen to be friends of Bob Woodward.
[03:23:40.120 --> 03:23:44.680]  The problem here, of course, is that Woodward has not the greatest track record when it
[03:23:44.680 --> 03:23:46.760]  comes to veracity.
[03:23:46.760 --> 03:23:55.120]  My own book, which I have co-authored with Tyler Nixon, Woodward and Bernstein, The Godfathers
[03:23:55.120 --> 03:24:02.800]  of Fake News, will be available shortly, delayed by some wrangling among lawyers.
[03:24:02.800 --> 03:24:06.520]  This book will be a blockbuster.
[03:24:06.520 --> 03:24:15.520]  I believe we have joining us today a man who knows firsthand of the lies of Bob Woodward,
[03:24:15.520 --> 03:24:23.000]  Larry Casey, a longtime Republican activist, nephew of one of the greatest CIA directors
[03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:25.680]  in American history, Bill Casey.
[03:24:25.680 --> 03:24:32.440]  Now Bill Casey was a pioneer of the Goldwater movement, was for many years the attorney
[03:24:32.440 --> 03:24:41.200]  for National Review, a good friend of William F. Buckley's, a close and tight supporter
[03:24:41.200 --> 03:24:50.240]  of President Richard Nixon, both in power and out, but he rose to his most, I would
[03:24:50.240 --> 03:24:56.000]  say, broadest acclaim when Ronald Reagan asked him at the last minute to jump in as
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:25:02.680]  his campaign manager in 1980, which Casey did with great effectiveness and zeal.
[03:25:02.680 --> 03:25:08.440]  Casey, a strong anti-communist, went on to become the head of the CIA.
[03:25:08.440 --> 03:25:15.640]  Now, Mr. Woodward would have us believe that he snuck into Bill Casey's hotel, hospital
[03:25:15.640 --> 03:25:20.840]  room, after Casey had been felled by a stroke, and that Casey had not only confessed the
[03:25:20.840 --> 03:25:28.120]  crimes of Iran contra, but also expressed disdain for a man that I know he loved, President
[03:25:28.120 --> 03:25:29.400]  Ronald Reagan.
[03:25:29.400 --> 03:25:35.920]  I think we have Larry Casey with us, who is a nephew of the late, great Bill Casey,
[03:25:35.920 --> 03:25:39.000]  and I'd like to talk to him about this.
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:40.440]  There we go.
[03:25:40.440 --> 03:25:41.440]  Excellent.
[03:25:41.440 --> 03:25:47.760]  Look, I know Larry that you know this history intimately, and I'm delighted that you can
[03:25:47.760 --> 03:25:49.260]  join us.
[03:25:49.260 --> 03:25:50.260]  Help us here.
[03:25:50.260 --> 03:25:54.320]  Did Bob Woodward sneak into Bill Casey's room and get a scoop?
[03:25:54.320 --> 03:25:57.680]  Roger, he never got in the room.
[03:25:57.680 --> 03:26:04.280]  It's my understanding that when I've talked to the CIA, security about this, my aunt and
[03:26:04.280 --> 03:26:13.560]  my uncle, my aunt, and his daughter had a 24-hour duty at bedside helping them out,
[03:26:13.560 --> 03:26:19.400]  and then CIA security had 24 hours, 24-7 security on them, and he had private duty
[03:26:19.400 --> 03:26:23.840]  nurses that were around the clock in the room.
[03:26:23.840 --> 03:26:29.000]  And so there was no way he could have gotten in that room, and in fact, I have learned
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:36.800]  from the secret service, CIA security, I should say, that he had tried to come up on the elevator
[03:26:36.800 --> 03:26:45.680]  wearing a hospital scrubs and a mask, and got off the elevator, and the CIA security
[03:26:45.680 --> 03:26:49.640]  got him at that point before he even moved down the corridor.
[03:26:49.640 --> 03:26:54.120]  He might have been able to look into the room through a window, but that's about as far
[03:26:54.120 --> 03:26:55.120]  as he got.
[03:26:55.120 --> 03:27:01.760]  He never did get in, and even if he did get in, my uncle was in no condition to speak,
[03:27:01.760 --> 03:27:07.200]  and he certainly showed a lot of callousness and even tried to come in and see a person
[03:27:07.200 --> 03:27:12.560]  on that condition, but my uncle could not talk, and that's been well-documented in the
[03:27:12.560 --> 03:27:18.600]  New York Times and other papers and journalists for many, many months and years afterwards.
[03:27:18.600 --> 03:27:22.760]  Well, there you have it from a family member.
[03:27:22.760 --> 03:27:27.040]  Bob Woodward lied about one of the biggest scoops of his entire career.
[03:27:27.040 --> 03:27:30.240]  This is not inconsistent with his other lies.
[03:27:30.240 --> 03:27:36.480]  He lies about ever being a military intelligence naval briefer for the White House.
[03:27:36.480 --> 03:27:41.800]  He says it in an interview that you can hear at Texas A&M in the archives.
[03:27:41.800 --> 03:27:47.240]  Yet we have direct quotes from the secretary of defense, Melvin Laird, the chairman of
[03:27:47.240 --> 03:27:55.000]  the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Tom Moore, who confirmed that Woodward was a military briefer in the
[03:27:55.000 --> 03:27:58.000]  Nixon White House, a matter that he denies.
[03:27:58.000 --> 03:28:04.520]  Larry, thank you for joining us here on Info Wars and the Alex Jones show and Shedding
[03:28:04.520 --> 03:28:08.800]  Light on Bob Woodward's Perhaps Greatest Block.
[03:28:08.800 --> 03:28:09.800]  Thank you, Roger.
[03:28:09.800 --> 03:28:14.760]  And if I do recall, even when Attorney General Meese and other people tried to go in to get
[03:28:14.760 --> 03:28:20.600]  his resignation, he couldn't speak then either, and my aunt was the one who had to handle
[03:28:20.600 --> 03:28:21.600]  everything.
[03:28:21.600 --> 03:28:25.920]  Now, there you have it, the Stone Cold Truth right here at Info Wars.
[03:28:25.920 --> 03:28:27.400]  Thank you, Larry Casey.

[03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:36.000]  There you have it.

[03:28:43.200 --> 03:28:45.600]  books are sold.

[03:28:53.400 --> 03:28:54.400]  up by...
[03:28:54.400 --> 03:28:55.400]  Hi, I'm Dan Tilla.
[03:28:55.400 --> 03:28:58.480]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:28:58.480 --> 03:29:00.040]  I sued the IRS in one.
[03:29:00.040 --> 03:29:03.000]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:06.280]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[03:29:06.280 --> 03:29:08.520]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:29:08.520 --> 03:29:09.840]  I can help you too.
[03:29:09.840 --> 03:29:12.840]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:29:12.840 --> 03:29:15.080]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[03:29:56.560 --> 03:30:01.000]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids
[03:30:01.000 --> 03:30:03.600]  get their EPA and DHA too.

[03:31:54.480 --> 03:31:58.280]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:58.280 --> 03:32:02.840]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[03:32:02.840 --> 03:32:08.280]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:08.280 --> 03:32:13.680]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[03:32:13.680 --> 03:32:15.200]  to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:15.200 --> 03:32:21.720]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:21.720 --> 03:32:25.720]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[03:32:25.720 --> 03:32:27.000]  in the rainwater.
[03:32:27.000 --> 03:32:32.440]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[03:32:32.440 --> 03:32:38.520]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:38.520 --> 03:32:44.160]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[03:32:44.160 --> 03:32:49.480]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:49.480 --> 03:33:15.480]  And more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:33:15.480 --> 03:33:30.640]  Welcome back.
[03:33:30.640 --> 03:33:35.840]  I'm Roger Stone, and you're here on the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:35.840 --> 03:33:39.680]  It's always great to get picked up on Matt Drudge's Drudge Report.
[03:33:39.680 --> 03:33:48.120]  I woke up this morning to find excellent coverage of a speech I gave yesterday to the 45 Club
[03:33:48.120 --> 03:33:49.240]  of Palm Beach.
[03:33:49.240 --> 03:33:54.920]  This is an independent club of the supporters of President Donald Trump.
[03:33:54.920 --> 03:33:59.640]  We had an enormous crowd and a lot of enthusiasm in the room.
[03:33:59.640 --> 03:34:07.240]  My special thanks to Joe Budd and Sue Snowden for putting together this terrific event.
[03:34:07.240 --> 03:34:14.280]  I talked at length about why the Russian collusion hoax is meant as a distraction for the much
[03:34:14.280 --> 03:34:22.440]  larger and serious crime of the hijacking of the 2016 election by the Obama Justice Department
[03:34:22.440 --> 03:34:25.840]  and the Obama FBI.
[03:34:25.840 --> 03:34:31.720]  In fact, the Obama administration, meddled in the American election, put their thumb
[03:34:31.720 --> 03:34:39.840]  on the scale, utilizing a phony dossier provided by Hillary Clinton, but with information supplied
[03:34:39.840 --> 03:34:41.840]  by Russian intelligence.
[03:34:41.840 --> 03:34:45.200]  Oh my goodness, that's collusion.
[03:34:45.200 --> 03:34:54.240]  Then they used that as the underlying rationale for the surveillance of Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:34:54.240 --> 03:35:01.960]  We now know this, even though the fully redacted Carter Page FISA warrant application tells
[03:35:01.960 --> 03:35:08.040]  us that they had no other evidence whatsoever of Russian collusion.
[03:35:08.040 --> 03:35:13.760]  Now we have the text messages from Lisa Page admitting that until the appointment of special
[03:35:13.760 --> 03:35:19.520]  counsel Mueller, they had no evidence of real Russian collusion.
[03:35:19.520 --> 03:35:23.000]  This has been an extraordinary witch hunt.
[03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:29.560]  But it's one that I must tell you has been enormously expensive for yours truly.
[03:35:29.560 --> 03:35:34.960]  If you don't know where this stands, let me tell you, at least 12 of my current or former
[03:35:34.960 --> 03:35:38.640]  associates have been interrogated by the FBI.
[03:35:38.640 --> 03:35:46.200]  Of those 12, eight of them were asked extensively about my association with Alex Jones and Infowars.
[03:35:46.200 --> 03:35:52.000]  I believe as many as five, perhaps more, of my current or former associates have been
[03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:59.640]  dragged before the grand jury, CNN reported that all my financial and banking records
[03:35:59.640 --> 03:36:04.080]  are being examined by the special counsel.
[03:36:04.080 --> 03:36:09.200]  We know that I was under full surveillance, although the terms will be very interesting
[03:36:09.200 --> 03:36:15.000]  to the American people starting around May of 2016.
[03:36:15.000 --> 03:36:20.960]  Think about how chilling that is, somebody reading all of your emails, your text messages
[03:36:20.960 --> 03:36:28.880]  listening to your phone calls, violation of the Fourth Amendment, probable cause, none.
[03:36:28.880 --> 03:36:31.240]  I have no foreign contacts.
[03:36:31.240 --> 03:36:33.440]  I'm a patriotic American.
[03:36:33.440 --> 03:36:37.680]  My sin, supporting Donald J. Trump for president.
[03:36:37.680 --> 03:36:42.120]  My other big sin, appearing on Infowars to tell the truth.
[03:36:42.120 --> 03:36:45.120]  That's why they wished to silence me.
[03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:51.640]  Now as some of you know, I have already been subject to a defamation lawsuit, which I won.
[03:36:51.640 --> 03:36:57.240]  I also was sued by an Obama directed front group, and that lawsuit was dismissed.
[03:36:57.240 --> 03:37:04.600]  Now I'm being sued by the Democratic National Committee in another frivolous sore loser lawsuit.
[03:37:04.600 --> 03:37:10.280]  The Senate Intelligence Committee wants to look at every document in my possession, millions
[03:37:10.280 --> 03:37:12.840]  and millions of emails.
[03:37:12.840 --> 03:37:19.040]  The special prosecutor is of course running around poking into every aspect of my personal
[03:37:19.040 --> 03:37:26.320]  life, my family life, my social life, my business life, my political activities.
[03:37:26.320 --> 03:37:32.320]  Very little of it have anything to do with the 2016 election or Russian collusion.
[03:37:32.320 --> 03:37:39.080]  This is costing me an enormous amount of money, and it threatens to bankrupt me and my family.
[03:37:39.080 --> 03:37:46.360]  Fine stories that say that I'm worth $20 million are planted to dissuade you from contributing.
[03:37:46.360 --> 03:37:54.680]  You can go to StoneDefenseFund.com and help the Stone family with an immediate contribution.
[03:37:54.680 --> 03:37:58.200]  That's StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:37:58.200 --> 03:38:03.240]  Somewhere here, there we have a, well there's the website, but we have a graphic that gives
[03:38:03.240 --> 03:38:08.480]  you the actual address, StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:38:08.480 --> 03:38:13.720]  Please send your most generous contribution because I need your help.
[03:38:13.720 --> 03:38:21.640]  You see, they seek to pressure me into testifying against our president, and that's something
[03:38:21.640 --> 03:38:24.040]  that I will never do.
[03:38:24.040 --> 03:38:30.760]  But to fight them, it will be cost as much as $2 million, and that is money that I do
[03:38:30.760 --> 03:38:32.080]  not have.
[03:38:32.080 --> 03:38:38.520]  Please go to StoneDefenseFund.com with your emergency contribution today.
[03:38:38.520 --> 03:38:44.800]  And while you're at it, go over to the Infowars.com store and find that donate button because these
[03:38:44.800 --> 03:38:47.600]  are interrelated fights.
[03:38:47.600 --> 03:38:54.640]  You see, they seek to shut Infowars down to wipe us off the digital map before they make
[03:38:54.640 --> 03:38:57.160]  their move on the president.
[03:38:57.160 --> 03:39:01.480]  They want to silence me, they want to silence Alex Jones.
[03:39:01.480 --> 03:39:05.720]  Only by your loyal support can we win this fight.
[03:39:05.720 --> 03:39:09.040]  Now at Infowars, you can help in two ways.
[03:39:09.040 --> 03:39:15.600]  You can buy one of our terrific products, a t-shirt, a nutraceutical, or you can just
[03:39:15.600 --> 03:39:18.360]  give a generous donation.
[03:39:18.360 --> 03:39:24.480]  Let's show the donate button there for folks who are unclear how to find it because I urge
[03:39:24.480 --> 03:39:30.560]  you to dig deep and give a contribution to that effort as well.
[03:39:30.560 --> 03:39:36.240]  Alex Jones and I both need your help and we make no bones about it.
[03:39:36.240 --> 03:39:41.400]  They asked me constantly about whether we have a blue wave coming.
[03:39:41.400 --> 03:39:47.320]  There was a terrific piece by Matt Drudge in which he fears that we may have a democratic
[03:39:47.320 --> 03:39:48.880]  tsunami.
[03:39:48.880 --> 03:39:55.040]  As a veteran of 40 years in American politics, I can tell you it's actually too early to
[03:39:55.040 --> 03:39:56.240]  say.
[03:39:56.240 --> 03:40:01.120]  The president has yet to frame this election, but he took a step in the right direction
[03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:06.160]  yesterday when he followed the advice that we've laid out here at Infowars and began
[03:40:06.160 --> 03:40:12.160]  the process of declassifying the documents that will expose what the Obama administration
[03:40:12.160 --> 03:40:15.480]  was up to in the 2016 election.
[03:40:15.480 --> 03:40:20.840]  It's far worse than the allegations of Russian collusion.
[03:40:20.840 --> 03:40:25.640]  If one more liberal tells me, oh, the Trump Tower meeting with Donald Jr., please give
[03:40:25.640 --> 03:40:26.680]  me a break.
[03:40:26.680 --> 03:40:28.200]  That meeting was a setup.
[03:40:28.200 --> 03:40:30.320]  It's also perfectly legal.
[03:40:30.320 --> 03:40:32.880]  There is no evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:40:32.880 --> 03:40:36.400]  There's no evidence of WikiLeaks collaboration on my part.
[03:40:36.400 --> 03:40:42.640]  This is all meant as a distraction to the incredibly egregious crimes that they are involved
[03:40:42.640 --> 03:40:43.640]  in.
[03:40:43.640 --> 03:40:49.800]  When we come back, Eric Bowling and Alex Jones at the top of the war room will go head to
[03:40:49.800 --> 03:40:52.440]  head on 9-11.
[03:40:52.440 --> 03:40:54.240]  This has to be clarified.
[03:40:54.240 --> 03:40:57.080]  It is nothing short than epic.
[03:40:57.080 --> 03:41:03.160]  I want to thank you for joining us here at the Alex Jones show today and recognize that
[03:41:03.160 --> 03:41:07.880]  the struggle that we find ourselves in is the test case.
[03:41:07.880 --> 03:41:14.400]  If they succeed in silencing Alex Jones, if they close down Infowars, there's no telling
[03:41:14.400 --> 03:41:15.880]  who is next.
[03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:17.200]  Is it Breitbart?
[03:41:17.200 --> 03:41:18.840]  Is it the Daily Caller?
[03:41:18.840 --> 03:41:25.600]  Is it Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Mike Savage, Rush Limbaugh, Mark
[03:41:25.600 --> 03:41:31.560]  Simone, so many other great patriots who are committed to bringing you the truth.
[03:41:31.560 --> 03:41:33.360]  Make no mistake about it.
[03:41:33.360 --> 03:41:36.600]  They are on the tech left's hit list.
[03:41:36.600 --> 03:41:40.960]  Today those people are being shadow banned and they're being toyed with.
[03:41:40.960 --> 03:41:46.520]  Not like what's going on with Alex Jones, where they literally want to deperson him.
[03:41:46.520 --> 03:41:54.400]  Jones, unafraid, goes to Washington and confronts the censors and his reward to be banned on
[03:41:54.400 --> 03:41:55.400]  Twitter.
[03:41:55.400 --> 03:41:58.560]  This is the most important fight that we face.
[03:41:58.560 --> 03:42:05.280]  If we cannot win the fight for a vibrant, robust internet, there is no future for the
[03:42:05.280 --> 03:42:06.800]  conservative movement.
[03:42:06.800 --> 03:42:11.000]  There is no future for American democracy.
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:15.960]  Donald Trump came along and threw a big chink into the plans of the globalists.
[03:42:15.960 --> 03:42:21.120]  This was supposed to be Hillary versus Jeb and everybody would go away happy but the
[03:42:21.120 --> 03:42:22.800]  American people.
[03:42:22.800 --> 03:42:27.800]  Now you have a brash, independent billionaire in the White House who takes orders from no
[03:42:27.800 --> 03:42:31.040]  one but who watches Info Wars.
[03:42:31.040 --> 03:42:32.840]  Thank you so much.
[03:42:32.840 --> 03:42:38.800]  You're on the Alex Jones show and we're grateful to have this opportunity to play out the facts.
[03:42:38.800 --> 03:42:42.440]  But I remind you again, they're trying to shut us down.
[03:42:42.440 --> 03:42:53.440]  At the InfoWars.com store now, God will bless you for it.

[03:43:45.000 --> 03:43:52.960]  can do for you with Ultimate Crill Oil, now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:52.960 --> 03:43:59.280]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[03:43:59.280 --> 03:44:05.680]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[03:44:05.680 --> 03:44:12.920]  or videos or other material from InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the revolution.

[03:44:46.960 --> 03:44:54.080]  and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.

[03:46:56.920 --> 03:47:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:08.000]  You say some of the things I say are despicable.
[03:47:08.000 --> 03:47:11.160]  A few things I've said turned out to be wrong and I'll admit my mistakes, but most of what
[03:47:11.160 --> 03:47:16.520]  you brought up when we talked on record and off record in D.C. last week are strawmen.
[03:47:16.520 --> 03:47:20.280]  It's misrepresentations, just like they say Trump hates all Mexicans.
[03:47:20.280 --> 03:47:23.760]  No, he said a lot of criminals are coming across the border, rapists and murderers.
[03:47:23.760 --> 03:47:25.480]  He didn't say they were all rapists and murderers.
[03:47:25.480 --> 03:47:29.160]  So again, it's misrepresentations of what they do.
[03:47:29.160 --> 03:47:34.040]  Absolutely true on the Trump argument, but not true on your argument.
[03:47:34.040 --> 03:47:35.040]  I've heard you, Alex.
[03:47:35.040 --> 03:47:39.440]  In fact, the reason why we almost got in that fight or that Twitter fight way back when
[03:47:39.440 --> 03:47:45.920]  was when you were talking about the inside job that 9-11 was and I will tell you I watched
[03:47:45.920 --> 03:47:47.520]  the second plane fly into the building.
[03:47:47.520 --> 03:47:51.080]  I lost 16 very close friends in that World Trade Center.
[03:47:51.080 --> 03:47:55.040]  There is no way in the world that I think my government could be part of a conspiracy
[03:47:55.040 --> 03:47:58.240]  that would kill 3,000 Americans, innocent Americans.
[03:47:58.240 --> 03:47:59.320]  It wasn't a wartime.
[03:47:59.320 --> 03:48:01.360]  It wasn't on the battlefield.
[03:48:01.360 --> 03:48:04.280]  These were innocent Americans going to work.
[03:48:04.280 --> 03:48:07.400]  Some of my close friends died and that really bothered me.
[03:48:07.400 --> 03:48:08.880]  Eric, I want to be clear.
[03:48:08.880 --> 03:48:12.480]  I still don't buy this fact that the government looked the other way.
[03:48:12.480 --> 03:48:17.000]  I'm not saying just like there's row groups in the White House and row groups in the CIA
[03:48:17.000 --> 03:48:20.920]  fighting America that have been caught working with ISIS in Al Qaeda and Trump says Obama
[03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:22.560]  and Hillary founded ISIS.
[03:48:22.560 --> 03:48:23.560]  That's true.
[03:48:23.560 --> 03:48:24.800]  John McCain was involved in that.
[03:48:24.800 --> 03:48:25.800]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:48:25.800 --> 03:48:29.640]  I'm not saying because I've been to New York and people say, how dare you say firefighters
[03:48:29.640 --> 03:48:30.640]  blew up the tower.
[03:48:30.640 --> 03:48:31.640]  I never said that.
[03:48:31.640 --> 03:48:35.280]  I agree with Alex Jones that John McCain was there and did meet with some of the leaders
[03:48:35.280 --> 03:48:37.480]  of what would soon become ISIS.
[03:48:37.480 --> 03:48:43.280]  I agree with you, but explain to me what proof in the world that you have that our government
[03:48:43.280 --> 03:48:47.520]  had somehow information that there was going to be two planes flown into our world traits
[03:48:47.520 --> 03:48:48.560]  and you don't have any.
[03:48:48.560 --> 03:48:52.960]  I get blamed for every conspiracy theory that some crazy person made up.
[03:48:52.960 --> 03:48:57.360]  I said, I do not agree with you that the US government, someone inside the government
[03:48:57.360 --> 03:49:00.720]  had knowledge of the terror attack prior to the attack.
[03:49:00.720 --> 03:49:01.720]  Oh really?
[03:49:01.720 --> 03:49:02.720]  Nobody in our government at least.
[03:49:02.720 --> 03:49:06.800]  And I don't think the prior government could envision flying airplanes into buildings on
[03:49:06.800 --> 03:49:08.400]  such a massive scale.
[03:49:08.400 --> 03:49:14.800]  I don't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and
[03:49:14.800 --> 03:49:18.960]  slam it into the World Trade Center, take another one and slam it into the Pentagon.
[03:49:18.960 --> 03:49:22.040]  But that turns out not to be true.
[03:49:22.040 --> 03:49:27.040]  US military planners did envision and practice those very scenarios.
[03:49:27.040 --> 03:49:32.600]  As reported by USA Today, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAS, conducted
[03:49:32.600 --> 03:49:39.160]  exercises with fighter jets simulating hijacked planes flown into the World Trade Center
[03:49:39.160 --> 03:49:41.680]  in the two years before the attack.
[03:49:41.680 --> 03:49:47.160]  Pentagon planners also envisioned the attack on the Pentagon five months before it happened.
[03:49:47.160 --> 03:49:52.960]  According to this April 2001 Pentagon email, Air Force officials wanted a war game, having
[03:49:52.960 --> 03:49:57.720]  a terrorist group hijack a commercial airline and fly it into the Pentagon.
[03:49:57.720 --> 03:50:03.520]  And I ask you whether you recall the title of that PDB.
[03:50:03.520 --> 03:50:08.400]  I believe the title was Bin Laden determined to attack inside the United States.
[03:50:08.400 --> 03:50:12.120]  There were elements in our government allied with radical Islam that helped them carry
[03:50:12.120 --> 03:50:13.120]  out the attack.
[03:50:13.120 --> 03:50:17.920]  You can argue whether or not America deserved or not.
[03:50:17.920 --> 03:50:20.120]  I don't think America deserved it.
[03:50:20.120 --> 03:50:22.400]  I'm saying the left is shareleading it.
[03:50:22.400 --> 03:50:26.800]  It wasn't your theory, Alice, your theory was not only did America not deserve it, but
[03:50:26.800 --> 03:50:30.120]  the United States government knew about the attack prior to the attack and decided to
[03:50:30.120 --> 03:50:31.120]  stand down.
[03:50:31.120 --> 03:50:32.120]  A very different theory.
[03:50:32.120 --> 03:50:33.120]  I don't want to spend all our time on 9-11.
[03:50:33.120 --> 03:50:35.160]  It's not that I'm running away from it.
[03:50:35.160 --> 03:50:36.920]  It's that the media misrepresent what I say about it.
[03:50:36.920 --> 03:50:40.920]  I believe Islamic terror and radical Islam is one of the number one threats on the planet,
[03:50:40.920 --> 03:50:42.160]  probably number one.
[03:50:42.160 --> 03:50:46.360]  I know that there are criminals in our government like Brennan, who were reportedly converted
[03:50:46.360 --> 03:50:47.680]  to a hobbyism.
[03:50:47.680 --> 03:50:52.520]  Obama helped launch the Arab Spring to overthrow allies in Egypt, you name it.
[03:50:52.520 --> 03:50:57.640]  And I think that elements let this happen like PNAC wrote to let there be an attack
[03:50:57.640 --> 03:50:59.640]  to end up taking our liberties away.
[03:50:59.640 --> 03:51:05.480]  And I've got FBI was warned about flight schools, that's CBS News, FBI knew Al Qaeda
[03:51:05.480 --> 03:51:10.280]  pilots were training in U.S. order to stand down, ABC News, the State Department lapses
[03:51:10.280 --> 03:51:14.120]  8 and 9-11 hijackers and they have the air lifts of evil, flying tens of thousands of
[03:51:14.120 --> 03:51:15.600]  Al Qaeda fighters out.
[03:51:15.600 --> 03:51:16.600]  Our military was ordered to do it.
[03:51:16.600 --> 03:51:17.600]  I don't blame our military.
[03:51:17.600 --> 03:51:18.600]  I was like, oh yeah, our military.
[03:51:18.600 --> 03:51:19.600]  No, I love our military.
[03:51:19.600 --> 03:51:24.440]  The bin Laden family was whisked out of the United States by President Bush himself right
[03:51:24.440 --> 03:51:28.600]  after the 9-11 attack and they went back to Saudi Arabia, correct?
[03:51:28.600 --> 03:51:34.480]  When you had the world trade set to go, people were put into planes that were friends, family,
[03:51:34.480 --> 03:51:38.280]  girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back for the most part
[03:51:38.280 --> 03:51:39.280]  to Saudi Arabia.
[03:51:39.280 --> 03:51:44.280]  All I'm saying is there is a radical Islamic alliance with the left and there are people
[03:51:44.280 --> 03:51:46.840]  in the government working to protect Islam.
[03:51:46.840 --> 03:51:50.560]  They got this imam that's connected to dozens of bombings, after six months he's been released
[03:51:50.560 --> 03:51:53.640]  from British prison next week.
[03:51:53.640 --> 03:51:56.200]  You said some things that I agree with.
[03:51:56.200 --> 03:52:00.080]  I believe radical Islam is the greatest threat to the United States, our freedom, maybe even
[03:52:00.080 --> 03:52:01.080]  the globe.
[03:52:01.080 --> 03:52:02.080]  I'll agree with that.
[03:52:02.080 --> 03:52:03.080]  Maybe the left's bigger though.
[03:52:03.080 --> 03:52:07.960]  Well, I think the left is a different type of threat and it's a longer term threat
[03:52:07.960 --> 03:52:13.440]  where radical Islam could kill a lot of people real fast and the left is going to take a
[03:52:13.440 --> 03:52:16.280]  while for them to take over and take away our liberties and freedoms.
[03:52:16.280 --> 03:52:19.840]  But I think we can deal with a straight on attack like radical Islam, it's the left creeping
[03:52:19.840 --> 03:52:20.840]  around.
[03:52:20.840 --> 03:52:21.840]  I don't like them either.
[03:52:21.840 --> 03:52:22.840]  I'm on board with that.
[03:52:22.840 --> 03:52:26.960]  Well, this is video on screen of them saying Building 7 has already fallen.
[03:52:26.960 --> 03:52:27.960]  Have you seen that video?
[03:52:27.960 --> 03:52:28.960]  No.
[03:52:28.960 --> 03:52:30.120]  And it's right behind her?
[03:52:30.120 --> 03:52:31.440]  Well, I can't hear it.
[03:52:31.440 --> 03:52:33.440]  Do you want to play it for you?
[03:52:33.440 --> 03:52:35.840]  I'd like to hear her say it's already fallen.
[03:52:35.840 --> 03:52:42.640]  And by the way, Alex, anyone could throw a video, a picture behind it, a news perspective
[03:52:42.640 --> 03:52:43.640]  because you're green.
[03:52:43.640 --> 03:52:46.360]  Building 7 has fallen, they put the story out beforehand.
[03:52:46.360 --> 03:52:50.760]  Now, more on the latest building collapse in New York, you might have heard a few moments
[03:52:50.760 --> 03:52:54.560]  ago, was talking about the Salomon Brothers building collapsing.
[03:52:54.560 --> 03:52:55.560]  And indeed it has.
[03:52:55.560 --> 03:52:59.480]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[03:52:59.480 --> 03:53:03.280]  Well, only really what you already know details are very, very sketchy.
[03:53:03.280 --> 03:53:07.800]  We are getting information now that one of the other buildings, Building 7 in the World
[03:53:07.800 --> 03:53:12.400]  Trade Center complex is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing.
[03:53:12.400 --> 03:53:17.400]  They were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[03:53:17.400 --> 03:53:21.400]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[03:53:21.400 --> 03:53:24.400]  Maybe this is what I think it was, is poor.
[03:53:24.400 --> 03:53:29.400]  And they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse.
[03:53:29.400 --> 03:53:32.400]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[03:53:32.400 --> 03:53:34.400]  It's just pancake.
[03:53:34.400 --> 03:53:37.400]  Well, pancaking almost like a precision implosion.
[03:53:37.400 --> 03:53:41.400]  We've got to get away for the challenge.
[03:53:41.400 --> 03:53:45.400]  It's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when
[03:53:45.400 --> 03:53:51.400]  a building was deliberately destroyed by world-based dynamite to map it down.
[03:53:51.400 --> 03:53:53.400]  All non-accessible basing up.
[03:53:53.400 --> 03:53:55.400]  Move away from that collapse.
[03:53:55.400 --> 03:53:56.400]  Let's just think about this.
[03:53:56.400 --> 03:54:02.400]  Controlled demolitions cannot be engineered and rigged in a day.
[03:54:02.400 --> 03:54:04.400]  It takes months.
[03:54:04.400 --> 03:54:10.400]  And therefore this event must have been planned in advance.
[03:54:10.400 --> 03:54:15.400]  If you're on that building, it's coming down.
[03:54:15.400 --> 03:54:17.400]  The building is about to blow up.
[03:54:17.400 --> 03:54:18.400]  Moving back.
[03:54:18.400 --> 03:54:20.400]  We are looking back.
[03:54:20.400 --> 03:54:22.400]  The building is about to blow up.
[03:54:22.400 --> 03:54:26.400]  Did they actually use the word rock down and who was that was telling you this?
[03:54:26.400 --> 03:54:29.400]  It was in the fire department and they did use the word.
[03:54:29.400 --> 03:54:31.400]  We're going to have to bring it down.
[03:54:31.400 --> 03:54:35.400]  And these people have heard explosions.
[03:54:35.400 --> 03:54:40.400]  It sounded like a collapse of thunder.
[03:54:40.400 --> 03:54:43.400]  It looked like there was a shockwave ripping through the building.
[03:54:43.400 --> 03:54:45.400]  The windows all busted out.
[03:54:45.400 --> 03:54:48.400]  About a second later, the bodies pulled the caves out.
[03:54:48.400 --> 03:54:50.400]  The building followed after that.
[03:54:50.400 --> 03:54:54.400]  And I turned in time to see what looked like a skyscraper explosion.
[03:54:54.400 --> 03:54:56.400]  It looked like it had been sent by a demolition crew.
[03:54:56.400 --> 03:54:58.400]  The whole thing just collapsed and down on itself.
[03:54:58.400 --> 03:55:00.400]  The government says that fire brought it down.
[03:55:00.400 --> 03:55:04.400]  However, 1,500 architects and engineers concluded it was a controlled demolition.
[03:55:04.400 --> 03:55:07.400]  Over 6,000 of my fellow service members have given their lives.
[03:55:07.400 --> 03:55:09.400]  And thousands of my fellow first responders are dying.
[03:55:09.400 --> 03:55:11.400]  I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[03:55:11.400 --> 03:55:12.400]  I'm a structural engineer.
[03:55:12.400 --> 03:55:13.400]  I'm a New York City correction officer.
[03:55:13.400 --> 03:55:14.400]  I'm an Air Force pilot.
[03:55:14.400 --> 03:55:16.400]  I'm a father who lost his son.
[03:55:16.400 --> 03:55:18.400]  We're Americans and we deserve the truth.
[03:55:18.400 --> 03:55:21.400]  Go to RememberBuilding7.org today.
[03:55:21.400 --> 03:55:22.400]  I was down there.
[03:55:22.400 --> 03:55:25.400]  I was down there one of the only people that weren't military in that area.
[03:55:25.400 --> 03:55:28.400]  There may be a handful of us, maybe 200, 300 people max trading oil
[03:55:28.400 --> 03:55:31.400]  because we had to stabilize the price of oil during that time.
[03:55:31.400 --> 03:55:33.400]  That whole area was unstable.
[03:55:33.400 --> 03:55:35.400]  They were worried about more than just Building 7.
[03:55:35.400 --> 03:55:37.400]  They were worried about some of the satellite buildings to the world.
[03:55:37.400 --> 03:55:41.400]  There were like four or five story world trade center buildings that were around.
[03:55:41.400 --> 03:55:44.400]  They were worried about those falling to Brooks Brothers building.
[03:55:44.400 --> 03:55:46.400]  They were concerned that was going to go down too.
[03:55:46.400 --> 03:55:49.400]  There was mass fear, confusion going on.
[03:55:49.400 --> 03:55:51.400]  That is all land.
[03:55:51.400 --> 03:55:54.400]  You're saying it's a false report.
[03:55:54.400 --> 03:55:56.400]  No, it's not a false report.
[03:55:56.400 --> 03:56:00.400]  I'm telling you, I don't think that there was a conspiracy to blow up Building 7 for what reason?
[03:56:00.400 --> 03:56:06.400]  Never in the history of a world, never in the history of high-rise skyscrapers
[03:56:06.400 --> 03:56:12.400]  has ever a skyscraper ever come down because of fire.
[03:56:12.400 --> 03:56:14.400]  And I'm talking mass of fire.
[03:56:14.400 --> 03:56:15.400]  And you know the reason why?
[03:56:15.400 --> 03:56:23.400]  Because fire does not burn by itself hot enough to compromise and melt steel.
[03:56:23.400 --> 03:56:28.400]  I happen to think that they had not only a plane but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously
[03:56:28.400 --> 03:56:31.400]  because I just can't imagine anything being able to go through that wall.
[03:56:31.400 --> 03:56:34.400]  To do that kind of destruction is even more than a big plane
[03:56:34.400 --> 03:56:38.400]  because you're talking about taking out the heaviest caliber steel that was used on a building.
[03:56:38.400 --> 03:56:40.400]  I mean these buildings were rock solid.
[03:56:40.400 --> 03:56:49.400]  What we had in the world trade center and I saw myself was molten lava-like pockets of molten steel.
[03:56:49.400 --> 03:56:57.400]  I spent the night on the pile searching for bodies and I saw that with my own eyes.
[03:56:57.400 --> 03:56:59.400]  So who are you going to believe?
[03:56:59.400 --> 03:57:04.400]  Are you going to believe a bunch of government bureaucrats or my fellow brothers
[03:57:04.400 --> 03:57:12.400]  which I lost 343 guys that day and I lost Tommy O'Hagan, Bruce Van Hines and Kenny Comple.
[03:57:12.400 --> 03:57:14.400]  And I can never forget that.
[03:57:14.400 --> 03:57:16.400]  I think of that before I go to bed.
[03:57:16.400 --> 03:57:19.400]  I think about it the first thing in the morning when I wake up
[03:57:19.400 --> 03:57:27.400]  and it's in honor of them and their family that I will continue to do everything I can
[03:57:27.400 --> 03:57:52.400]  to make the rest of the world wake up to the fact that this was a false flag operation.
