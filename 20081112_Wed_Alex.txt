[01:34.560 --> 01:41.800]  here on the GCN radio network in the meantime there's a great story a very
[01:41.800 --> 01:47.960]  informative by Paul Watson up on prisonplanet.com dealing with more
[01:47.960 --> 01:54.800]  information emerging about Barack Obama's youth brigades his civilian
[01:54.800 --> 02:02.480]  defense corps his national draft and we not only have his own statements and
[02:02.480 --> 02:05.880]  his chief of staff statements admitting it'll be mandatory and that will affect
[02:05.880 --> 02:11.560]  basically even the elderly up to up to their 70s will be quote
[02:11.560 --> 02:17.680]  required to slave and to be to learn what it is to be an American to be
[02:17.680 --> 02:23.800]  reeducated to learn how to spy on their neighbors I mean you can't make this up
[02:23.800 --> 02:28.120]  well it turns out back in 96 Rahm Emanuel who engineered the big democratic
[02:28.120 --> 02:31.640]  takeover in the house and of course kept the war going that was what his state of
[02:31.640 --> 02:39.240]  job was was to defeat anti-war Democrats and real liberals he talked to well
[02:39.240 --> 02:43.840]  several newspapers but a new one has emerged with a New York Daily News it's
[02:43.840 --> 02:48.120]  during a cocktail party being recorded so the audio is a bit well it's pretty
[02:48.120 --> 02:52.320]  good audio it's just there's a lot of clinking of glasses and jazz playing in
[02:52.320 --> 02:57.000]  the background and he basically restates word for everything that's in his book
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.880]  and everything that was on change.org or excuse me change.gov now it's a
[03:02.880 --> 03:08.040]  government site the president's transition site and the Obama Kool-Aid
[03:08.040 --> 03:14.280]  drinkers are behaving just like Bush Kool-Aid drinkers when we posted the fact
[03:14.280 --> 03:20.440]  last Friday and then it got picked up all over the nation by other blogs that
[03:20.440 --> 03:27.560]  his website was calling for mandatory military service and mandatory domestic
[03:27.560 --> 03:34.120]  squads which is just a continuation of the Clinton and Bush policies just now
[03:34.120 --> 03:38.080]  with a you know different spin on it they went on the info wars.com and
[03:38.080 --> 03:42.360]  prisonplot.com stories about it that Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson wrote and said
[03:42.360 --> 03:49.040]  it wasn't true and said we were liars and then I guess to match that with their
[03:49.040 --> 03:54.960]  delusional reality reality was edited or the matrix was altered and it was
[03:54.960 --> 04:01.600]  memory hold and every major page of change.gov was altered including the
[04:01.600 --> 04:06.960]  lines about it being mandatory but Google cash the Waymac machine and other
[04:06.960 --> 04:12.800]  sites that saved the web they at least saved prominent sites we were able to
[04:12.800 --> 04:17.000]  get that and they accused us in that article and on liberal blogs where they
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.880]  posted our story of manufacturing the screenshots and look come on why are you
[04:23.880 --> 04:29.240]  willfully delusional why don't you admit that they that slavery is in vogue now
[04:29.240 --> 04:35.080]  and then a blackface is bringing it to America and then he's a front man and
[04:35.080 --> 04:41.280]  then he's a puppet no instead you're going to deny everything just like George
[04:41.280 --> 04:45.200]  Bush supporters did I've had him come up to me in a gun shop and say you're lying
[04:45.200 --> 04:49.640]  about him supporting the assault weapons fan you know with Bush and I just don't
[04:49.640 --> 04:54.200]  even argue with him I go just fine I'm lying just believe whatever you want
[04:54.200 --> 04:58.160]  we'll be right back with this and a lot more huge broadcast lined up for you
[04:58.160 --> 05:03.560]  today stay with us hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long
[05:03.560 --> 05:06.440]  time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[05:06.440 --> 05:09.880]  important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the
[05:09.880 --> 05:13.520]  key you'll never have to stand in a bread line you have your own bread you'll
[05:13.520 --> 05:17.040]  never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[05:17.040 --> 05:20.960]  in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a
[05:20.960 --> 05:25.120]  good old boy bailout special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it
[05:25.120 --> 05:28.640]  they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print eight hundred and
[05:28.640 --> 05:32.280]  fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the
[05:32.280 --> 05:35.480]  American and European banks the exploding inflation that is now
[05:35.480 --> 05:39.360]  guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of
[05:39.360 --> 05:44.120]  necessity particularly food beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany
[05:44.120 --> 05:48.120]  super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it
[05:48.120 --> 05:52.480]  reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there
[05:52.480 --> 05:56.360]  seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our
[05:56.360 --> 05:59.560]  government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their
[05:59.560 --> 06:03.280]  shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business
[06:03.280 --> 06:07.360]  whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and be ready everything is
[06:07.360 --> 06:10.640]  zeroing it on food one third of Americans have to choose between buying
[06:10.640 --> 06:14.960]  food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared
[06:14.960 --> 06:18.560]  get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very
[06:18.560 --> 06:21.720]  important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the
[06:21.720 --> 06:24.880]  government the new-old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a
[06:24.880 --> 06:29.120]  mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take
[06:29.120 --> 06:33.200]  care of your family in the final equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is
[06:33.200 --> 06:36.960]  still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli salmonella genetic

[07:20.200 --> 07:27.720]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[07:27.720 --> 07:31.280]  alex jones
[07:41.160 --> 07:47.040]  just in case you join us Alan Watts coming up in 52 minutes Gary Franchi of
[07:47.040 --> 07:52.240]  in the fed national protest Ralph Nader and Larry Pratt today that is our
[07:52.240 --> 07:58.440]  eclectic and truly thought-provoking and diverse panel that we'll be speaking
[07:58.440 --> 08:08.760]  with today we are going to cover a host of other issues as well namely the
[08:08.760 --> 08:15.640]  banking takeover part deuce part two that we're now going to be witnessing and
[08:15.640 --> 08:23.560]  I on the treadmill today watched 35 plus minutes of Henry Paulson's press
[08:23.560 --> 08:30.360]  conference all lies all deceit all spin just everything was complete lies if you
[08:30.360 --> 08:35.560]  actually spend any time studying what they're saying and doing so I want to
[08:35.560 --> 08:42.520]  get into a Paulson as well I've got a bunch of other GMO news they have
[08:42.520 --> 08:46.560]  studied universities industry the companies themselves like Monsanto and
[08:46.560 --> 08:54.440]  Conagra and others they have studied their own GMO foods and every major GMO
[08:54.440 --> 09:04.040]  that is cross species gene spliced food has a sterilizing effect on the males
[09:04.040 --> 09:12.480]  and females that eat it just across the board it hurts all life forms hurts
[09:12.480 --> 09:19.360]  mammals hurts insects and it's a whole bunch of German and British and Dutch
[09:19.360 --> 09:24.760]  and Chinese studies out that just one particular type but it's grown all over
[09:24.760 --> 09:29.800]  the world it just so happens wherever you have corn growth belts you find that
[09:29.800 --> 09:34.600]  corn being grown that's where you'll have total be dial two billion bees died
[09:34.600 --> 09:41.400]  this year alone in England that was most of their bees it is the GMO corn that
[09:41.400 --> 09:49.120]  grow that that produces a pesticide in the plant itself so bugs donate it hey
[09:49.120 --> 09:57.960]  what a great system it just so happens that most most of you know types of
[09:57.960 --> 10:03.520]  insects grasshoppers weevils things like that they won't eat the poison corn but
[10:03.520 --> 10:10.000]  honeybees will so the honeybee comes by and gets some pollen off the pollinating
[10:10.000 --> 10:16.280]  corn and bye bye bye bye honeybee but it's not just the honeybees you may not
[10:16.280 --> 10:20.040]  care about the honeybees you can sit back and laugh and giggle and snicker
[10:20.040 --> 10:26.280]  about it but you had better care about your own reproductive system and by
[10:26.280 --> 10:31.040]  the way that's just on that level the association of GMO with diabetes and the
[10:31.040 --> 10:38.080]  rat and guinea pig and rabbit studies and monkey studies primate studies the
[10:38.080 --> 10:45.240]  association with cancers with a gastrointestinal disorders I mean all of
[10:45.240 --> 10:48.720]  these things are off the charts now thousands of percentile and increases
[10:48.720 --> 10:53.440]  and you know that doesn't get you the fluoride does and that doesn't get you
[10:53.440 --> 10:56.240]  the mercury does and if that doesn't get you the barium salts and aluminum
[10:56.240 --> 11:01.240]  dioxide being sprayed now admitted in a worldwide weather modification program to
[11:01.240 --> 11:07.680]  save the earth from climate change that's just the cover that's what they
[11:07.680 --> 11:12.800]  tell the well-meaning environmental wacko cultist or religious cult members
[11:12.800 --> 11:17.320]  that work at these facilities when they load the fuel with it oh god help us
[11:17.320 --> 11:21.640]  meanwhile they're about to start taxing the air we breathe and exhale calling it
[11:21.640 --> 11:26.120]  toxic waste that'll absorb the entire legitimate environmental movement make it
[11:26.120 --> 11:30.320]  all about regulating humans controlling our industrial output Obama's all over
[11:30.320 --> 11:35.160]  TV yesterday today saying we've got to get our industry going again when he is
[11:35.160 --> 11:38.960]  supported and his party is supported and his chief of staff is the guy that
[11:38.960 --> 11:45.280]  rammed through he was the ramrodder he was the honcho that's why zone is the
[11:45.280 --> 11:54.160]  pit bull Rambo on getting after ram through remember Bill Clinton and Al Gore
[11:54.160 --> 12:01.440]  remember Al Gore making fun of Ross Perot and lyricking live and because Al
[12:01.440 --> 12:07.120]  Gord laughed at him some of the public got fooled and said oh he laughed at him
[12:07.120 --> 12:11.160]  it nefta must be good but but they would have you believe it for the public it
[12:11.160 --> 12:14.280]  didn't when that thing finally passed what was it 80 something percent of the
[12:14.280 --> 12:24.640]  public and the polls was against it they don't care so Barack Obama is running
[12:24.640 --> 12:28.160]  around saying he wants to get our industry going again do you know what a
[12:28.160 --> 12:31.680]  carbon tax is going to do do you know what cap and trade going to do you know
[12:31.680 --> 12:36.640]  an attack on the on the coal plants all these fools go good those rich evil coal
[12:36.640 --> 12:44.680]  companies they deserve to go out of business I hope Obama bankrupts them yeah
[12:44.680 --> 12:52.000]  about 50% 49% is the specific number the exact number 49% of all power in the
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.480]  US that's electrical power to every type of factory business restaurant school
[12:57.480 --> 13:07.840]  church car dealership shopping malls everything golf courses tennis courts
[13:07.840 --> 13:15.080]  pools your house they knock that out you're going to see energy easily double
[13:15.080 --> 13:23.280]  in prices on top of all the inflation and so we can never adjust to what they
[13:23.280 --> 13:26.720]  do that's why every year they jack up the price then lower it then jack it up and
[13:26.720 --> 13:32.520]  lower so that clean burning systems don't get developed and deployed into the
[13:32.520 --> 13:35.880]  market on their own they let markets build up and they knocked the feet out
[13:35.880 --> 13:41.440]  from under them same thing with ethanol same thing with biodiesel they're slick
[13:41.440 --> 13:46.760]  they manage the world's economy and if you think they're managing it now get
[13:46.760 --> 13:50.360]  ready but but I for the sake of argument for the sake of being adults for those
[13:50.360 --> 13:53.480]  that believe that global warming well now they admitted in global warming now
[13:53.480 --> 13:57.000]  they say it's getting cold again so climate change can have climate change
[13:57.000 --> 14:03.160]  the earth naturally has climate change warmer in a historically according to
[14:03.160 --> 14:07.640]  anthropologist and biologist and archaeologist is better for life forms
[14:07.640 --> 14:16.600]  on average better for crop yields but let's just say that man may global
[14:16.600 --> 14:20.880]  warming is real and it's just gonna kill us all we're all dead we all saw that
[14:20.880 --> 14:26.640]  Hollywood movie day after tomorrow and it's all true and we're all dead if we
[14:26.640 --> 14:30.880]  don't accept world government taxation how is moving what's left of industry in
[14:30.880 --> 14:36.280]  Europe the United States in Japan moving that to China and India and Mexico and
[14:36.280 --> 14:40.640]  160 other countries that are exempt which all the major studies that are out
[14:40.640 --> 14:47.000]  there we've linked to them and on the websites that will increase the amount
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.320]  of carbon dioxide because it will leave a nation that already has a lot of
[14:51.320 --> 14:55.920]  cleaner burning systems and that will move at the countries with no controls
[14:55.920 --> 14:59.600]  who have set on record they will never adopt it and the UN doesn't intend for
[14:59.600 --> 15:03.020]  them to adopt it because it's about moving the industry further de
[15:03.020 --> 15:07.000]  industrializing the West so we can be controlled its feudalism surf them it's
[15:07.000 --> 15:14.440]  a management system they don't want upwardly mobile mobile self-sufficient
[15:14.440 --> 15:20.160]  independent people that stated in all the major globalist UN Club of Rome CFR
[15:20.160 --> 15:28.320]  documents so what is it you can't get about that simple fact I just stated you
[15:28.320 --> 15:33.960]  are so wedded just like Republicans on talk radio still say WMDs were found in
[15:33.960 --> 15:38.120]  Iraq and still say Saddam carried out 9-11 I mean even if you believe the
[15:38.120 --> 15:45.280]  official fairy tale that 19 guys from a cave did it even people that it still
[15:45.280 --> 15:49.440]  believe that major overall fairy tale most people don't believe the fairy
[15:49.440 --> 15:53.000]  tale that's admitted by the government to not be true the Saddam Hussein had
[15:53.000 --> 16:00.560]  nothing to do with it but still around 30% you go pull this up just I just
[16:00.560 --> 16:06.400]  Google I know I've seen the headlines from before the numbers went down of
[16:06.400 --> 16:13.080]  54% of America still believe Saddam carried out 9-11 but you know type in
[16:13.080 --> 16:20.800]  35% still believe Saddam involved in 9-11 and you'll see the articles point
[16:20.800 --> 16:27.880]  is everything I say you can pull up well just like you've got the Democrats
[16:27.880 --> 16:31.400]  because that's one of their policies that's part of their little religious
[16:31.400 --> 16:36.360]  cult that's part of their fake belief system that's how they get accepted at
[16:36.360 --> 16:40.320]  the tea house or the coffee house or acting trendy you know down at the
[16:40.320 --> 16:46.440]  Unitarian Church or whatever or at the local atheist hangout is that oh my
[16:46.440 --> 16:50.320]  gosh we've got climate change we've got a restrict carbon dioxide the UN's own
[16:50.320 --> 16:55.240]  reports said man-made carbon dioxide accounted for 6% of the increase not
[16:55.240 --> 17:00.120]  6% of the total 6% of the increase and then all these top scientists and
[17:00.120 --> 17:05.040]  climatologists and ice core specialists and solar experts have gone and
[17:05.040 --> 17:11.600]  discredited that the UN said to back off of that and said okay it's 2% but see
[17:11.600 --> 17:15.520]  people don't read UN documents they don't read what's really being said
[17:15.520 --> 17:20.640]  they just it's on the weather channel it's on TV every nature show I can't
[17:20.640 --> 17:23.360]  even let my children watch a nature show because it's all about humans are bad
[17:23.360 --> 17:27.560]  and all the animals are dying and global warming is evil and these evil
[17:27.560 --> 17:37.180]  caterpillars are eating oak trees because of climate change and I mean I
[17:37.180 --> 17:41.520]  watched like 20 minutes of TV with my wife last night laying in bed when you
[17:41.520 --> 17:47.400]  saw let's watch a little TV turn it on and we were watching PBS or something and
[17:47.400 --> 17:51.440]  it was these it was like in the Netherlands these evil caterpillars
[17:51.440 --> 17:55.480]  eating oak trees and it said they're scary they slither up the side and eat

[23:37.000 --> 23:42.080]  Franchi more on the second amendment with Larry Pratt nice to line up for you
[23:42.080 --> 23:51.200]  today all right I watched pretty much all of Henry Paulson's press conference
[23:51.200 --> 24:00.760]  today and it was just a bunch of gobbledygook fake financial numbers
[24:00.760 --> 24:05.600]  thrown out terms thrown out lies like the economy's great everything's fixed
[24:05.600 --> 24:11.120]  everything's back on track we've he kept saying total transparency by the
[24:11.120 --> 24:17.400]  Treasury and the Federal Reserve total transparency by federal agencies total
[24:17.400 --> 24:24.360]  transparency to Congress and the American people total checks and balances
[24:24.360 --> 24:28.520]  and protections for the taxpayers meanwhile two weeks ago they gave
[24:28.520 --> 24:32.640]  Congress blacked out documents on hundreds of billions of dollars handed
[24:32.640 --> 24:37.120]  out to private banks and then the tens of billions of dollars in fees for
[24:37.120 --> 24:42.120]  brokerage firms to hand the money out for the government no discussion of the
[24:42.120 --> 24:48.120]  head person running this kashkari is the gopher and lieutenant the protégé of
[24:48.120 --> 24:53.480]  Paulson also of Goldman Sachs they're now adding to the Federal Reserve one of
[24:53.480 --> 24:57.240]  the people that imploded one of the brokerage firms and looted it so just a
[24:57.240 --> 25:02.160]  total insider free for all they admit that major brokerage firms like Goldman
[25:02.160 --> 25:08.200]  Sachs are taking all total globally more than 50 billion dollars of bailout
[25:08.200 --> 25:13.600]  money and giving that to the other executives as bonuses and they said
[25:13.600 --> 25:20.680]  that that's in the British news you know $14 million seven million pounds in the
[25:20.680 --> 25:26.720]  US 25 billion plus I mean it's just all right there in the news just in bonuses
[25:26.720 --> 25:30.920]  for themselves they are directly taking the money and and bragging to the New
[25:30.920 --> 25:34.560]  York Times oh we're not really in trouble we're gonna buy up good banks and
[25:34.560 --> 25:39.280]  good assets and then just let all the other about the smaller banks fail and
[25:39.280 --> 25:42.520]  then we'll use regulators in the government who take those over and then
[25:42.520 --> 25:48.200]  hand them to us with all the assets of the banks I mean this is just crime at
[25:48.200 --> 25:54.880]  every level and less people get confused earlier I was talking about looking up
[25:54.880 --> 25:59.360]  the number of Americans that still believe changing subjects that Saddam had
[25:59.360 --> 26:05.960]  WMDs I was saying that previously in the first few years of 9-11 it was
[26:05.960 --> 26:10.240]  something like 55 percent remember thought Saddam the headline was more
[26:10.240 --> 26:13.840]  than half of Americans believe Saddam involved in 9-11 and then I'm saying
[26:13.840 --> 26:21.080]  today you can Google it and it's it's last time I saw it like 30% that was
[26:21.080 --> 26:26.720]  about six months ago the reason I digress and get back into 9-11 and is
[26:26.720 --> 26:33.760]  because somebody sent me an email this morning going ah ha you're a liar I went
[26:33.760 --> 26:37.920]  out to Robert Mueller Airport and it's a shopping mall in a movie studio there's
[26:37.920 --> 26:44.040]  no FEMA camp out there you're a liar and I had remembered seeing that on a
[26:44.040 --> 26:48.360]  YouTube comment it's got a half a million views up there the little video
[26:48.360 --> 26:52.800]  excerpt of my shelf two months before 9-11 predicting it and I just so it
[26:52.800 --> 26:55.640]  happened to see him comment they're saying the same things it must be the
[26:55.640 --> 27:00.240]  same guy hey if you want to believe that go ahead you want to believe I'm a
[27:00.240 --> 27:06.840]  liar and and and and play mental games and and falsify reality so you can say
[27:06.840 --> 27:14.600]  you're right be my guest I have the video myself of the security guards saying
[27:14.600 --> 27:21.800]  don't videotape this building and get out of here they put in bolts and chains
[27:21.800 --> 27:27.360]  and and and barbed wire inside and then I called the local news about it and
[27:27.360 --> 27:33.640]  local Fox did a news piece and said that it was an emergency federally paid for
[27:33.640 --> 27:40.840]  holding center during civil unrest just like in Denver they built a secret camp
[27:40.840 --> 27:46.480]  and told reporters that it wasn't a camp and then got caught lying about it just
[27:46.480 --> 27:51.360]  like Pier 57 in New York was secret and federally paid for and they kept more
[27:51.360 --> 27:58.680]  than 2,000 people in it inside bar bar fences sitting in the 75-year-old bus
[27:58.680 --> 28:05.160]  terminal and all those chemicals and oil on the floor so pier 57 exist the secret
[28:05.160 --> 28:09.240]  camp in Denver exist the one out at Mueller I haven't checked in two years
[28:09.240 --> 28:13.440]  two years ago they still had the hangar it's a big airport shut down airport
[28:13.440 --> 28:21.920]  it's a big airport it's a 747 hangar and they made it into a makeshift relocation
[28:21.920 --> 28:27.640]  facility and that's been on the news and you can lie all day long and say it
[28:27.640 --> 28:33.880]  doesn't exist but it does but again this is the denial ideal the army admits
[28:33.880 --> 28:38.320]  they have secret civilian inmate labor camps that were secret from 10 years to
[28:38.320 --> 28:43.240]  86 to 96 when they declassified it that's even on the Wikipedia page it's on the
[28:43.240 --> 28:48.400]  army dot mill website and then now they've expanded it to 24 camps and it's no
[28:48.400 --> 28:53.080]  longer secret and they're building more camps for the American people and you
[28:53.080 --> 28:57.920]  can just say it's not true all day long and but you know reality's still there
[28:57.920 --> 29:04.760]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[32:38.960 --> 32:47.680]  an orgy of foreign banker looting coming up this weekend now again we know
[32:47.680 --> 32:51.720]  that at the belterberg group meeting three meetings ago two and a half years
[32:51.720 --> 32:57.240]  ago in Ottawa Canada from our sources inside that they were going to implode
[32:57.240 --> 33:01.240]  the subprime mortgage first that way they could blame it on the public and say
[33:01.240 --> 33:09.120]  the public was responsible that that that key psychological position and that
[33:09.120 --> 33:14.800]  they would then cut off liquidity worldwide cause a massive slowdown in
[33:14.800 --> 33:20.320]  the world economic system main street grinding be a halt and the bankers
[33:20.320 --> 33:24.760]  would grandstand and fair monger and say out of this crisis we've got to have a
[33:24.760 --> 33:28.760]  new order we've got to punish the corrupt financial institutions and how do
[33:28.760 --> 33:33.560]  they do that by giving themselves tens of trillions globally of taxpayer
[33:33.560 --> 33:41.000]  money and of setting up an expanded world regulatory body run by the very
[33:41.000 --> 33:46.960]  institutions the very private banks and i watch pulse in this morning he kept
[33:46.960 --> 33:51.880]  saying we apologize to the world we are so sorry for what we have done
[33:51.880 --> 33:57.320]  america is so bad we are terrible i mean over i mean he probably said it's six
[33:57.320 --> 34:03.680]  seven times my mouth was hanging open we apologize to europe we apologize to the
[34:03.680 --> 34:09.200]  world we shouldn't have given these bad loans to these people that didn't have
[34:09.200 --> 34:14.000]  money it's the american people's fault and it's our banks fault meanwhile the
[34:14.000 --> 34:18.800]  banks are really offshore and setting up world government so we're sorry we're
[34:18.800 --> 34:22.680]  going to pay for it that means the american people your tax money to give
[34:22.680 --> 34:26.560]  them all the cash which isn't even used to unfreeze the markets they want the
[34:26.560 --> 34:30.760]  markets frozen so they can drive down the prices of the real economy to buy it
[34:30.760 --> 34:37.160]  up this is really very simple and i tell full-grown business majors this stuff
[34:37.160 --> 34:46.640]  and they can't understand me i tell people that have degrees but again their
[34:46.640 --> 34:51.760]  degrees are in a bunch of fake flim flam and their degrees are only within a
[34:51.760 --> 34:59.360]  very narrow spectrum of the real economic system they analyze only a very
[34:59.360 --> 35:04.440]  limited area i mean here's the parallel like the ocean you've got the surface
[35:04.440 --> 35:08.560]  area for the first hundred feet or so then you've got you know the twilight
[35:08.560 --> 35:18.720]  zone and you've got the dark zone well they just they just inhabit a few feet
[35:18.720 --> 35:27.720]  of one of those zones instead of wide spectrum analysis i mean a lot of main
[35:27.720 --> 35:33.320]  line business majors will tell you the federal reserve is governmental they
[35:33.320 --> 35:36.680]  will claim it is accountable to the treasury they will tell you it is
[35:36.680 --> 35:45.600]  accountable to the congress and that's not true the president appoints the
[35:45.600 --> 35:54.120]  decade plus long term of a fed chairman but the rest of the fed the board of
[35:54.120 --> 35:58.680]  governors is completely private and they run and control the economy they run
[35:58.680 --> 36:01.640]  and control the president so the president always appoints who they
[36:01.640 --> 36:07.680]  want whether it's a valker whether it's green span or now Bernanke and they see
[36:07.680 --> 36:13.560]  us as dumb animals that deserve to be slaves it's funny to them and so just
[36:13.560 --> 36:18.480]  like 30% of the public or more thinks that i'm carried out 911 still even the
[36:18.480 --> 36:23.400]  government admits he didn't you've got a large portion of the public that can't
[36:23.400 --> 36:26.240]  admit they were lied to so they will continue to say the federal reserve is
[36:26.240 --> 36:30.320]  government and the federal reserve is beholden to congress
[36:30.320 --> 36:37.480]  they will continue to say that barack obama is is changing what's happening
[36:37.480 --> 36:43.440]  with wall street and gonna fix it when he is their man their pipe piper to con
[36:43.440 --> 36:48.960]  the public long enough for the new world order to openly be set up and what do we
[36:48.960 --> 36:52.040]  always tell you for decades it would be because the globalist told us in their
[36:52.040 --> 36:57.120]  own think tank documents it would be after a world economic crisis they
[36:57.120 --> 37:00.800]  engineered they said they would do it and then they would set up a world
[37:00.800 --> 37:04.400]  regulatory body over all the currencies of stock markets and financial
[37:04.400 --> 37:10.520]  transactions and then you would pay a environmental tax on everything you do
[37:10.520 --> 37:15.640]  hundreds of new taxes per country and a percentage would be paid to the private
[37:15.640 --> 37:21.960]  inner group of banks making them finally openly government so it in the
[37:21.960 --> 37:25.480]  government taken over the banks it's a private group of banks taking over the
[37:25.480 --> 37:29.120]  rest of the free market other financial institutions insurance companies
[37:29.120 --> 37:37.400]  brokerage firms credit unions and the real economy and the government and
[37:37.400 --> 37:43.320]  you're going to see them at this new Bretton Woods to agree on a set of quote
[37:43.320 --> 37:48.320]  reforms to quote fix things and then they'll plunge the market even more and
[37:48.320 --> 37:53.880]  say see we need this right now accept this right now and the public will say
[37:53.880 --> 37:58.000]  no we're not for it and then they'll go on TV and say the public says they're
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.200]  for it good we'll now go to a basket of currencies run by these private banks
[38:03.200 --> 38:10.040]  and they will regulate the United States and you're up in the world and they
[38:10.040 --> 38:13.320]  will have a list of demands for the United States just like they've had for
[38:13.320 --> 38:17.920]  hundreds of third world countries it's the IMF World Bank list of over 100
[38:17.920 --> 38:22.440]  demands and it will be privatize your water districts your school districts
[38:22.440 --> 38:31.120]  your government your police your power companies your roads everything now
[38:31.120 --> 38:35.200]  that'll be on that end the companies will pay nothing they will just be given
[38:35.200 --> 38:39.400]  everything and then you will still pay taxes to government and to the private
[38:39.400 --> 38:47.720]  banks and fees and then on average your service will triple water trash pick up
[38:47.720 --> 38:53.320]  just watch roads everything everything they are gonna squeeze you and squeeze
[38:53.320 --> 38:56.840]  you and squeeze you till it's like Argentina that was first world where
[38:56.840 --> 39:00.000]  middle-class people by the millions are living on the streets and it's eight
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.560]  years after that control collapse they're still there they like it they like
[39:03.560 --> 39:07.640]  flying over helicopters and seeing people in shanty towns they enjoy
[39:07.640 --> 39:13.320]  hurting families they enjoy control it's it's about dominance it's like a dog
[39:13.320 --> 39:20.040]  hiking its leg and urinating on a smaller dog or a cow dog a lot of times
[39:20.040 --> 39:23.080]  that little dog can cow the big dog because it just doesn't believe in
[39:23.080 --> 39:28.080]  itself that's like us so hiking their leg appointing foreigners and dual
[39:28.080 --> 39:33.240]  citizens to run the White House just hiking the leg urinating on you and
[39:33.240 --> 39:39.080]  then going on TV with Paulson and saying you deserve this you did this
[39:39.080 --> 39:44.200]  America apologizes to the world for what we've done and now we're ready to be
[39:44.200 --> 39:49.240]  punished with economic sanctions like we're Germany after World War one and
[39:49.240 --> 39:53.280]  we've lost some war and we're going to pay reparations that's what they're
[39:53.280 --> 39:58.280]  saying and so of course England and Germany and Russia and Japan and China
[39:58.280 --> 40:03.520]  and Brazil they all are having economic bailouts they're all run by crooks too so
[40:03.520 --> 40:08.280]  they're all quote let's bail out the help the people let's give five hundred
[40:08.280 --> 40:12.760]  and sixty five billion dollars to select Chinese companies and banks from the
[40:12.760 --> 40:19.320]  Chinese taxpayer hooray that'll fix it hey let's give now five hundred plus
[40:19.320 --> 40:26.920]  billion dollars you can convert that into pounds to private select banks in
[40:26.920 --> 40:31.800]  England up taxpayer money they'll have to pay back yes let's do let's let's give
[40:31.800 --> 40:36.960]  six hundred and something billion in Germany yay let's give four hundred
[40:36.960 --> 40:40.440]  something million in France to the private bankers yes that will show them
[40:40.440 --> 40:49.960]  for what they did the magnitude of it but not only do they get all the money
[40:49.960 --> 40:56.880]  that we have to pay back in taxes and inflation devaluation of currency but
[40:56.880 --> 41:01.680]  they they set up the new order and be the saviors
[41:01.680 --> 41:13.000]  now now this is Alan Greenspan he says a lot of other horrible things the
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.640]  clubs up on info wars dot com but
[41:16.880 --> 41:20.640]  but John I don't have a sheet of paper in front of me what's the title of the
[41:20.640 --> 41:27.800]  YouTube video were you on air just now okay
[41:27.800 --> 41:32.640]  on the Greenspan admits the Federal Reserve is above the law answers to no
[41:32.640 --> 41:35.080]  one okay if you want to go to what there it is
[41:35.080 --> 41:43.400]  this is Greenspan on the Lair news hour and he just arrogantly says there's
[41:43.400 --> 41:47.600]  nothing the Congress I think the government nothing anyone can do and
[41:47.600 --> 41:53.520]  then he quasi implies it's governmental now think about that in our government
[41:53.520 --> 41:56.200]  it's supposed to all be about checks and balances and accountability and
[41:56.200 --> 42:00.840]  transparency and the private banks running the world setting up all these
[42:00.840 --> 42:04.200]  world rules through world government global governance they're always telling
[42:04.200 --> 42:09.040]  us over and over and over and over again you've got to be transparent we've got
[42:09.040 --> 42:11.720]  to know everything what you're doing without a warrant we've got to watch
[42:11.720 --> 42:15.040]  your every move we've got to watch all these third world countries that are
[42:15.040 --> 42:19.600]  owned by the bankers who made the money out of nothing enforce it with our
[42:19.600 --> 42:24.720]  military and he just says hey I can do whatever I want there's nothing anyone
[42:24.720 --> 42:30.240]  can do about the Federal Reserve the Federal Reserve stands alone and does
[42:30.240 --> 42:36.680]  whatever it wants and folks it is the management arm of Chase Manhattan City
[42:36.680 --> 42:47.960]  Bank JPMorgan Chase City Bank Wells Fargo and Bank of America those are the
[42:47.960 --> 42:51.440]  banks that own the Federal Reserve publicly there's been congressional
[42:51.440 --> 42:57.280]  hearings decades ago about it and they engineered runs on banks before 1913
[42:57.280 --> 42:59.840]  they said oh this will fix it we'll never have another run on the bank and
[42:59.840 --> 43:04.240]  other crisis and then the mother of all crises they engineered by cutting off
[43:04.240 --> 43:07.840]  liquidity in 29 it took a full year to get into the depths of the depression
[43:07.840 --> 43:11.360]  they're doing the same thing right now and they grandstand again as the
[43:11.360 --> 43:15.560]  saviors they were so bold then they ordered the public to turn their gold
[43:15.560 --> 43:19.200]  into the government and the government and the people did it and they gave them
[43:19.200 --> 43:24.360]  paperback and then double the price of gold a year later I mean there's no end
[43:24.360 --> 43:30.800]  to the level of arrogance and here's the deal they are gonna continue to push
[43:30.800 --> 43:33.920]  and push and push as the founding father George Washington said the level of
[43:33.920 --> 43:40.440]  tyranny you will live under is the exact amount you will tolerate they will not
[43:40.440 --> 43:45.720]  stop they will never quit they will never quit pushing until you say no and
[43:45.720 --> 43:50.360]  they know the public is cowed and whooped and on its back on its belly
[43:50.360 --> 43:54.600]  begging and they're not going to give us quarter so here is this snake who
[43:54.600 --> 43:58.200]  changed the rules to let the private banks issue endless liquidity to buy up
[43:58.200 --> 44:02.480]  real assets and now they're leaving us holding the bag while posing as the
[44:02.480 --> 44:07.960]  saviors here he is saying that they are accountable to no one but themselves and
[44:07.960 --> 44:13.040]  they can do whatever they want now in the legislation the house passed they say
[44:13.040 --> 44:18.680]  the Treasury can now join them in the crime and literally merge with the
[44:18.680 --> 44:22.280]  banks the banks are taking it over not it's not taking them over they have no
[44:22.280 --> 44:28.000]  voting share and that they can do whatever they want and of course they
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.840]  say we've spent two trillion we won't tell Congress where it went here's some
[44:32.840 --> 44:37.040]  blocked out documents and then he goes on TV today while publicly saying in
[44:37.040 --> 44:40.480]  Bloomberg reporting an AP reporting that they won't give any of the
[44:40.480 --> 44:45.040]  information out even the Congress which is above them but they say no you're
[44:45.040 --> 44:49.400]  not we have the executive in the military that says they'll back us up
[44:49.400 --> 45:00.240]  sit down and shut up he has the nerve Paulson to go on TV today and say this
[45:00.240 --> 45:05.320]  is total transparency total taxpayer protection on and on and on complete
[45:05.320 --> 45:10.720]  lies this is a heist in the open and they're not gonna stop here folks they're
[45:10.720 --> 45:14.160]  that's why I know they're going for broke that's why I'm so disquieted in my
[45:14.160 --> 45:18.880]  soul that's why I'm so upset you haven't seen I haven't seen we haven't seen
[45:18.880 --> 45:26.200]  anything yet they're gonna take them and they're gonna make us a total third
[45:26.200 --> 45:32.120]  real country very quickly they want you bankrupt they want you destitute because
[45:32.120 --> 45:35.680]  then they can really poses the savior and then you'll accept gun control then
[45:35.680 --> 45:39.000]  you'll accept military on the streets because of rioting then you'll accept
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.440]  total tyranny this is so cold-blooded and so evil and so greedy and so
[45:44.440 --> 45:48.800]  self-centered let's go ahead and play out in Greenspan it's unbelievable what
[45:48.800 --> 45:53.800]  is the proper relationship what should be the proper relationship between a
[45:53.800 --> 45:57.840]  chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States well first of all the
[45:57.840 --> 46:04.240]  Federal Reserve is an independent agency and that means basically that there is
[46:04.240 --> 46:12.480]  no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take so long
[46:12.480 --> 46:19.320]  is that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the
[46:19.320 --> 46:24.240]  Congress or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we
[46:24.240 --> 46:29.920]  think is the appropriate thing then what the relationships are don't frankly
[46:29.920 --> 46:34.920]  matter and I've had very good relationships to the president I know
[46:34.920 --> 46:38.240]  that you mentioned in the book and everybody knew it about know about it
[46:38.240 --> 46:44.080]  at the time the president George H. W. Bush blamed you partly at least for his
[46:44.080 --> 46:47.960]  reelection I think he said that he said fully I think you're right I'm just
[46:47.960 --> 46:54.200]  trying to put up help you out there a little bit what is it you did that so
[46:54.200 --> 46:58.980]  let's stop right there now did you hear that's why he was made Fed
[46:58.980 --> 47:03.160]  chairman because he's slick that was lawyer talk did you hear how long
[47:03.160 --> 47:13.040]  Greenspan the economist say we are an independent agency an agency that goes
[47:13.040 --> 47:16.880]  back to letter of mark that just means a group hired agencies are really
[47:16.880 --> 47:21.360]  privately hired and organized organizations outside government that's
[47:21.360 --> 47:26.320]  why once the Congress commissioned officers now the military just hires
[47:26.320 --> 47:29.440]  mercenaries does whatever it wants it was all about at Congress having the
[47:29.440 --> 47:34.360]  control now you have a private Federal Reserve and he says oh well if he
[47:34.360 --> 47:37.120]  implies knowing the knowing the populations ignorant
[47:37.120 --> 47:40.840]  semantically the words he's using oh we're an independent agency we're
[47:40.840 --> 47:43.600]  independent from Congress and the president we do whatever we want and
[47:43.600 --> 47:51.200]  that's morally good he implied and that no one can have oversight no one could
[47:51.200 --> 47:55.200]  audit them they've never been audited no one can look at them oh that's good oh
[47:55.200 --> 48:00.200]  yes just trust you in a black hole guarded by private guards do whatever
[48:00.200 --> 48:05.320]  you want with our money and of course they've robbed us they're raping us
[48:05.320 --> 48:11.800]  now that's what happens they just laugh at us then he goes on to say no agency of
[48:11.800 --> 48:17.640]  government can interfere with us so see then he in first he implies they're a
[48:17.640 --> 48:20.960]  government agency but he uses the word agency then he says no agency of
[48:20.960 --> 48:26.200]  government can interfere with us so again semantically implying that they're
[48:26.200 --> 48:31.640]  part of government again now fraud and criminality I don't care if you have a
[48:31.640 --> 48:35.960]  contract I don't care if you got the Federal Reserve Act Congress can repeal
[48:35.960 --> 48:41.080]  that Congress can investigate you grand juries can arrest your criminal but
[48:41.080 --> 48:45.560]  Alan Greenspan you are not the new emperor you you do not have the divine
[48:45.560 --> 48:50.560]  right of kings and that was decided in 1215 at running mead that kings are not
[48:50.560 --> 48:56.480]  God and that kings can't do whatever they want and Richard Nixon isn't a king
[48:56.480 --> 49:01.560]  and Bill Clinton isn't a king and George W. Bush isn't a king and you are not a
[49:01.560 --> 49:07.920]  king you little criminal you little bank robbing bastard and the same goes for
[49:07.920 --> 49:13.680]  Bernanke and the same goes for Henry Paulson the Treasury I don't care if
[49:13.680 --> 49:18.680]  you threaten Congress of martial law and said give us unlimited power vote us a
[49:18.680 --> 49:24.560]  blank check hand over your authority to us sign a congressional treaty with the
[49:24.560 --> 49:29.720]  private Federal Reserve to let them take over that's what that bill was it's a
[49:29.720 --> 49:36.960]  fraud it's abhorrent but cops and the public and everybody else have been
[49:36.960 --> 49:42.840]  trained as long as somebody in a suit says it on TV and has a blue background
[49:42.840 --> 49:47.960]  behind them everything's okay so we've got to ask I mean how far are we gonna
[49:47.960 --> 49:52.880]  let them go I mean it's two trillion in five weeks enough I mean that it's not
[49:52.880 --> 49:57.520]  just the robbing the Treasury that they're now going to expand their power
[49:57.520 --> 50:01.280]  over our lives and put a carbon tax on everything we do and shut down our
[50:01.280 --> 50:05.040]  factories and farms and ranches and take our guns I mean we're gonna let them
[50:05.040 --> 50:08.920]  say that's their divine right to do that we'll be back with a youth brigades

[53:16.160 --> 53:21.000]  internationalist they don't care about rotting America to the ground in fact
[53:21.000 --> 53:28.400]  they want to in CNBC and a lot of other major TV financial channels Bloomberg
[53:28.400 --> 53:34.560]  CNN money they're all saying the US will probably lose its triple a rating here
[53:34.560 --> 53:43.400]  was a top brokerage firm out of China well German based in China CNBC last
[53:43.400 --> 53:49.160]  night talking about the US losing his triple a rating here it is Martin I must
[53:49.160 --> 53:53.280]  admit some of your pretty dire expectations for the US some of them
[53:53.280 --> 53:57.680]  came to pass and I'm curious as to your thoughts on what needs to happen here in
[53:57.680 --> 54:02.840]  the US to dig ourselves out of this situation yeah I'm afraid you know I
[54:02.840 --> 54:06.640]  don't see that the US even with another stimulus package could rescue itself
[54:06.640 --> 54:11.360]  because most of their industry industrial capacity have already been you know
[54:11.360 --> 54:15.880]  depleted it has gone overseas so I don't think there's much industry really to
[54:15.880 --> 54:20.000]  stimulate back into life and the other thing is unlike China will do have a
[54:20.000 --> 54:23.640]  lot of cash who do have very low government debt and so it's easy for
[54:23.640 --> 54:27.520]  them to to splash or some cash but in the United States there's already a
[54:27.520 --> 54:32.200]  funding crisis and they will have to sell a lot more bonds next year to fund
[54:32.200 --> 54:37.560]  the bailout packages that have already been signed off and so I think the US
[54:37.560 --> 54:40.880]  might be on course to actually lose triple a rating you know the even there
[54:40.880 --> 54:45.440]  there's a chairman of sovereign state ratings for standard and poor say has won
[54:45.440 --> 54:49.840]  that there's a lot of pressure now on the US triple a rating and you have seen
[54:49.840 --> 54:54.200]  let's say they don't care and then they go and talk about big European funds and
[54:54.200 --> 54:58.240]  others suspending trading of US securities because people just aren't
[54:58.240 --> 55:02.120]  buying them now they offer them and that's not being bought at auction you
[55:02.120 --> 55:05.760]  understand folks when more money is created it has to be sold as debt for
[55:05.760 --> 55:09.400]  people to buy it because we have a private Federal Reserve who sells it and
[55:09.400 --> 55:14.920]  makes the profit these private bastard bankers sit there because they bought
[55:14.920 --> 55:19.920]  off our Congress in 1913 and they they sell bonds that we have to pay back in
[55:19.920 --> 55:27.840]  tax money to foreign investors and then they get the profit from selling them
[55:27.840 --> 55:33.000]  for nothing and what do they do for us letting them have this power they rape
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.760]  us they set us up and then blame the American people and have a Treasury
[55:36.760 --> 55:40.120]  secretary get up there and blame the American people and say we're so sorry
[55:40.120 --> 55:44.120]  America's bad when these are foreign European banks the Federal Reserve is
[55:44.120 --> 55:49.040]  mainly European owned Rothschild owned and is openly doing this and by the way
[55:49.040 --> 55:54.720]  I see people all over the web making fun of me saying the Rothschilds don't exist
[55:54.720 --> 56:01.920]  or if they do they don't have any power the big UAE news article I just had that
[56:01.920 --> 56:09.440]  in my stack and I never got around to it openly said two days ago in the United
[56:09.440 --> 56:14.200]  Arab Emirates major national newspaper in an interview that they are setting up
[56:14.200 --> 56:19.760]  a world government and that the Rothschilds basically run large parts of
[56:19.760 --> 56:24.480]  it he just says we're setting up global government and what we run by banks
[56:24.480 --> 56:28.560]  worldwide and he called it a new world order he said global government global
[56:28.560 --> 56:34.720]  governance new world order and we run it I mean you've got in fact where is it I
[56:34.720 --> 56:40.840]  just can't keep track of it anymore and then and then people just just sit
[56:40.840 --> 56:46.800]  around and they laugh about all of it I'm gonna cover that later where is it
[56:46.800 --> 56:53.920]  they laugh about it like it's funny well I know it's up on prison planet I know
[56:53.920 --> 56:59.840]  it's up on prison planet calm and then I've got all these people living in
[56:59.840 --> 57:08.120]  denial about Barack Obama's website change.gov that they that they
[57:08.120 --> 57:14.880]  sponged that they covered up but they erased a bunch of it Saturday we
[57:14.880 --> 57:20.160]  reported last week I just went there and read it with horror America serves was
[57:20.160 --> 57:24.440]  the link and it says mandatory service basically for everybody up until
[57:24.440 --> 57:33.480]  they're 70 national draft you've got to join the military and serve I mean and
[57:33.480 --> 57:39.600]  then now we have Rahm Emanuel telling the New York Daily News this an interview
[57:39.600 --> 57:43.920]  and people are still in denial I mean I don't know what I'm supposed to do here
[57:43.920 --> 57:56.920]  for this level of denial. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[57:57.920 --> 58:05.920]  May I have everybody's attention please I've come with a message of information 9-11 was an inside job.
[58:05.920 --> 58:08.920]  Do you like being a puppet sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[58:08.920 --> 58:13.000]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage was engineered by you
[58:13.000 --> 58:18.000]  David Rockefeller that fall out of her commission to see him fall out of the shadow.
[58:18.000 --> 58:25.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[58:25.000 --> 58:31.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[58:31.000 --> 58:38.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[58:38.000 --> 58:41.000]  If you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[58:41.000 --> 58:44.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[58:44.000 --> 58:50.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[58:50.000 --> 58:56.000]  Please rise and download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[58:56.000 --> 58:59.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[58:59.000 --> 59:09.000]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:13.000 --> 59:21.000]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[59:21.000 --> 59:25.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:25.000 --> 59:31.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[59:31.000 --> 59:37.000]  I found the Rothschild article on prisonplanet.com, the headline,
[59:37.000 --> 59:44.000]  Baron the Rothschild Economic Crisis Will Bring New World Order and Global Governance.
[59:44.000 --> 59:48.000]  That's out of the national newspaper of the United Arab Emirates.
[59:48.000 --> 59:55.000]  I'm going to sit down and interview with him. He says, Baron Rothschild shares most people's view that there is a new world order.
[59:55.000 --> 59:59.000]  In his opinion, banks will deleverage and there will be a new form of global governance.
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  But you have to be careful of characters.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  We don't want to go from ultra-liberalism to protectionism when he goes on to talk about the world government
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  and how they've got their fingers in all the world banking.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  The general public, I remember Limbaugh 15 years ago saying Rothschilds didn't exist.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  CFR didn't exist. Now he admits they exist but say they run nothing.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  And then openly, we have hundreds of newspapers with a headline New World Order,
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  banks to set up world government to control everything, nothing on Sean Hannity,
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  nothing on Rush Limbaugh. They will not attack Barack Obama for real issues.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  They can't. In fact, they say Barack Obama wants to steal the pension funds.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no. JBS did a great story yesterday. Paul Watson did an even bigger one at presentplanet.com
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  saying that both parties are actually for it and giving you the quotes from the congressional hearings last week.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  And the public again runs away from a threat. Psychologically, they say it doesn't exist.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  People are emailing us saying we're making it up. We're against Obama.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  No, we're against taking your pension funds and your 401Ks.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  Okay? I mean, they're openly getting ready to start snatching them and taxing them
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  and not letting them be tax exempt and stealing. The government will take it over
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  and then give you part of it and maybe down the road.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  And listen, we're not going to stop this if you don't get out of denial.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  The denial has to stop, okay? FEMA camps are real. Rothschilds are real.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  The New World Order is real. This stuff is real.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  I haven't even gotten to Rahm Emanuel. We have his book, The New Chief of Staff for Obama.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  We have him saying that you'll have to serve in the military.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  If you read the fine print, it's what Clinton proposed. Well, it was Rahm Emanuel who proposed it.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  It's basically the Israeli model. You have to serve for three months and then you're in the guard.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  He says in the National Guard and then you'll be called up whenever they want you to be sent to Iraq or domestically or anywhere.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  It's just a three-month basic training, just like the National Guard training.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  That's what he says on the audio tape to the New York Daily News.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  And they say, I'm going to play it later after Alan Watt leaves us,
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  he openly says you're going to have national compulsory service.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  But he says, what's wrong with that? It'll teach you how to be an American.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Now, that was all along Barack Obama's website, change.gov.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  And they took it down and we have a video clip of him saying,
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  a civilian force as strong and as large, a million man for domestic spying.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  And Rahm Emanuel proposed that as well.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  I mean, by the way, it's an environmental brigade of three million, a spy brigade of one million,
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  mandatory college students have to serve in it domestically, high school students,
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  it's Secure Corps, a division of AmeriCorps, set up by Clinton.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Bush continued, it was in the Philadelphia Daily News.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  We got to go pull that article up from 2002 where it talked about them training high schoolers
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  with the M16s in warrant service, checkpoints, and fugitive apprehension.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  And they're handing out radar guns to the Tattletale public and see things that sound reasonable at first
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  and then it expands.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  FBI has these training events all over the country.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  And they do it in Europe too.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  Oh, come, you know, their feds do, come and help us track down everybody.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  Help us fight terror.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  And then you show up to the meeting, it's been in the news.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  By the way, does your neighbor have a marijuana plant?
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  By the way, what's your neighbor saying?
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  They're talking about the Constitution.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  We have it on video.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  See how they, they don't say we're going to be secret police, Kamara.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  No, they say it's for the war on drugs and then it's for terrorism.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  It's for child abuse.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  And then it's for what's your neighbor?
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  What's your mommy and daddy doing?
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  I mean, they're really doing it, folks.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  It's already going on everywhere.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  They're turning the schools and the military academies.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  And today that's more important than ever.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  We need to be independent.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  And food and water is the key.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare,
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for a special interest.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  They turned off the telephones and emailed.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  They voted to print $850 billion, at least, out of thin air.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  and blast the cost of massacres, particularly food beyond many Americans' reach.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food,
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  the government, the new-old order has a lot less control over you, and so it's a mindset,
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella,
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  Take action today.
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  The first step is getting storable food.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  From his central Texas command center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  All right, for the next hour, Ellen Watt joins us.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  We've got Gary Franchi popping in in the next hour as well as Ralph Nader.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  And then Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America to talk about record gun sales.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  The all-time record in the last week since the election of Barack H. Obama.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  I want to talk about the banker takeover, how they're openly setting up world government.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  I want to get into the staged election and how he's using subliminals, NLP.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  A lot of people are picking up on it right now.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  How they're fooling the public with their man, Barack Obama.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  I want to get more into TV and the subliminals there.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  And just how dangerous it is to watch television and to not be aware of what's happening.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  He's got the website cutting through thematrix.com.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  And he is also a radio talk show host in his own right.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  Ellen Watt, thanks for coming on with us.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  It's a pleasure to be here, Alex.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  What do you want to tackle first?
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  The economy, the new Bretton Woods, the birth of the world government finally really happening.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  They've always had great control, but now total control.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  Or should we get into the staged election first?
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  What do you want to get into first?
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  I think really all the elections are staged.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  We know that when you go down through your histories.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  And you find in every country, every country in the western world,
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  since before World War II, in fact, you go through this farce of election.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  But what you do find when you go into history is that there is an agenda.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  There is a mandate to bring in a new system.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  And regardless of the party that seems to get in, the agenda roars forward.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  It never slows down.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  When one party gets in, they never throw up the laws from the previous party.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  They stay on the books.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  And so it's a continuation.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  This is exactly what you find the founding fathers talked about.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  Jefferson talked about it.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  They said, when you see at the same agenda going on between the changes of houses,
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  he meant the Congress parties.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  He says, then you know you're under tourney.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  And you see we are under tourney.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  This whole financial bubble is all planned.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  It's a big business plan with steps and stages all written out wrong in advance.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  And gone over by think tanks to see all the repercussions.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  Just like a chess game that they've gone through before they even moved the first piece.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  They know every part of the introduction of the steps and how the public will react.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  So we are being trained to react the way the plan does to react.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  The new Britain Woods system is time now to bring it in.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  We find that John Maynard Keynes, who brought in the Britain Woods system,
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  a really top genesis in his field and an economist, they're always tied together, economics and eugenics.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  He said this is only one part of the system.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  The next part of the system would be to introduce a world of service
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  where every individual is responsible to government.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  And the government will be literally in your bank account deciding what you earn,
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  what you spend, what you buy, if you can even buy it, et cetera, et cetera.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  This is the next step they're going into now with the new agreement.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  And it ties together with what Karl Marx talked about,
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  which was the three massive trading blocks of the world under a world of government.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  And the United Nations now is being brought up to its full strength through the IMF,
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, et cetera,
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  to take over the roles that they were actually designed to do in the first place.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  So we're going under total cradle to grave socialism,
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  where you have both a planned life from birth to death.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  That's what's coming in, step by step by step.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  This is a hundred years' war that you have said at the beginning of 9-11, 2001.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  And by the end of the hundred years' war, they hope to have their brave new world
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  in where literally you'll have a new species of humans at the end of the hundred years
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  who will serve the small dominant minority.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  And by the way, every time we raise that, people make fun of us.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  That's BBC, AP Reuters, headlines, the elites, the anthropologists, the biologists
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  are saying that, that they're going to engineer us with drugs and education
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  and breeding and sterilization to be a, quote, goblin-like,
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  that's a quote on the BBC by the eugenicist, goblin-like creatures.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  And then there'll be these ethereal angel-like creatures.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  And you talked about social engineering, notice they're saying in England,
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  we're going to ban cheap alcohol.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  Well, that means they can ban any type of cheap food, too.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  We're not going to address why people are falling apart and being such drunks.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  We're going to just try to tax people.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  Or in England, we're not going to let roadside shacks sell things that we say are unhealthy like hot dogs.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  We're going to say what you can serve.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  I mean, think about how that sets a precedent for total control.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  The same thing now coming in here.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  So that's what the National ID cards are all about, is tracking what we do, regulating.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  First, it starts out with genetic screening.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  Now they're saying, well, we're going to make you have genetic screening.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  And then we're going to say whether you can have a child or not.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  I mean, they're really pulling the stops out right now.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  Yes, they are.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  It's total tyranny from every possible angle, even in here in Canada,
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  which is no doubt the same across the British Empire, as you still call it, the Commonwealth.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  They're bringing out laws to allow police to come into any home they want on any suspicion
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  that there's any chemical containing ether, like starting fluid for your car and so on.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  There's a given self-carp blanche to get into anyone's house under any pretext.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  So you are looking at a system where you will have no peace and privacy,
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  and you'll be trained to accept that as a normal.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  And so when your neighbors get raided or you get raided, there's no big deal about it.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  It'll become a normal part.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  And by the way, the British government admits everyone I know, including myself,
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  who's been to England or who is a citizen there, a subject,
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  the cops just randomly walk up and ask where you're going, what you're doing.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  I'm going to put you in a database now, and they're rude to you by design
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  to prepare the general public to interface with them.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  Yes, that's right.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  It's all training.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  Everything really is to train the public.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  And we've had 30 years or 40 years of sci-fi movies getting us ready
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  subconsciously for this present system that's coming in now.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  And it's no big deal because we're familiar with the idea of a totalitarian system
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  where the masses live in hobbles and rubble, and yet this massive army,
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  well equipped, just go in like the Star Wars goons.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  And this is how we've been programmed to accept this.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  There's no outcry from the public because you can train.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  It is true.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  You see, behavioral psychology and mass psychology has been so well studied
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  and introduced and used.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  And this falls in line with what Bertrand Russell and others, big players,
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  in their day talked about, they said that the public will come to conclusions
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  and never know how they arrived at those conclusions.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  It'll be by Osmosis.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  And then they value the propaganda they're regurgitating as if it was their own.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  They hold on to the lies.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  I mean, I have people email me saying, you're making up FEMA camps.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  You're making up Barack Obama wanting national service.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  You're lying about, I mean, and I'm like, but here's the information.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  They just go, we don't care.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  You're a liar.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  We choose to believe you're a liar.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  Can you speak to national service and how that ties in?
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  National service.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  In fact, Obama had it up on his own website.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  The speech he gave, I think in Vermont, that he was going to make a call
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  for basically national service.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  He's since removed that from the site, but I have the PDF here.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  And so I think in January, that's what you're going to hear is this call for.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  You see, they want to militarize the whole of society.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  And to do so, to get, once you, you've found this in totalitarian regimes,
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  like the Soviet system, like the Nazi system, you must get the youth involved.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  So they will grow up thinking that wearing a uniform is quite natural
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  and serving the system is quite natural.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  And that the heavy indoctrination they'll have through the schooling system
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  will augment that and they'll never break free and see it from the outside
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  as to what's actually happening.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  This is an old technique and they must militarize the system for their hundred years of war.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  And by the way, Obama's announced that he's written about it.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  So is his Chief of Staff. He's given speeches.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  It was on change.gov.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  Then he takes it down, says it's all lies, none of it's true.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  His followers then agree because they're not ready to launch it yet.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  Then in a few months, he'll openly launch it and then there'll be no discussion
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  about how they lied and said they weren't launching it.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  There were no discussion at all.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  And you'll notice too, what's very interesting is that in Obama's speeches,
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  he never pins anything down into a concrete fact.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  It's all a motive terminology he uses, which is standard in politics,
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  but he has good scriptwriters.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  But he does mention certain phrases, catchphrases like world citizenship in his speeches.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  So here is a president of a country, a national country, talking about global citizenship.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  An average person hears this and doesn't really ask, what does he mean by global citizenship?
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  Well, this is the term used by the Rockefeller Foundation that's right behind Obama.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  And Rockefeller himself has been giving out World Citizenship Awards
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  to all the big players for the great work for the last 50 odd years.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  And he keeps saying you've got to sacrifice.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  You're going to have to give. This is going to hurt.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  And the revolution is giving everything to the government, being a slave,
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  but then chanting yes we can, feeling powerful.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  That's exactly right.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  It's a world of service.
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  And this goes back through the World Citizenship Society
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  and to the Royal Institute of International Affairs and Council on Foreign Relations
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  who have drafted up the amalgamation for the Americas.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  They admitted they were the ones behind the drafting up for the amalgamation of Europe.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  These are private organizations who take their orders from the Queen of England
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  and the nobility of Europe.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  And this is their age-old dream to bring in world citizenship,
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  but not a happy little land where we all play and buy and so on,
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  but an organized society where literally you will not be born
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  unless they have a function for you to fulfill to serve them.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  And they say all that.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  They do say that, Jess. I mean, that's like Lord Rothschild, Baron Rothschild.
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  He has both titles and he's called Baron Rothschild,
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  but his wife on CNN said he is a Lord.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  And again, Wolf Blitzer, who doesn't tremble before a president started trembling,
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  Your Excellency, oh my gosh.
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  Yeah. Eugenics is alive and well.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  And it's actually being introduced now.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  We see it from the declarations from the BBC, from the BBC Canada.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  And they plan to bring in this brave new world through genetics and social engineering.
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  Meanwhile, they're poisoning through the water and air and our food.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  Let's talk more about that when we get back with the always thought-provoking and extremely accurate Alan Watt.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  With Christmas right around the corner and an unstable economy looming,
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  finding the right gift can be tough.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  Why not give the gift of an Excalibur Dehydrator?
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  The Excalibur Dehydrator is not only economical, but also fun for the whole family.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  Save hundreds of dollars by drying your own fruits, vegetables and meats.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  Make your own healthy snacks or start storing your own healthy food in case of emergencies.
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  All with no added salts, fats and preservatives.

[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  Today.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  The major veterinary university in Vienna,
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  one of the top ones in the world,
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  found that feeding mice was genetically engineered in maize
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  developed by the U.S.-based Monsanto Corporation
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  with a lower fertility and body weight,
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  according to a study conducted by the University of Veterinary Medicine
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  in Vienna presented Tuesday.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  In the study, mice fed with the NK603X Mono810
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  sweet corn variety over a period of 20 weeks showed a smaller litter size
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  and lighter offspring than mice fed with non-engineered maize.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  And then they go into the statistical difference being massive
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  and also how many of them were sterile.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  I'm going to cover more of this later.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  We're being murdered.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  I mean, it's an economic genocide,
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  economic annihilation, consolidation.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  They are poisoning us.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  They are telling us this is in all their documents.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  And again, the public, we've been right about everything, Alan.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  Everything we said is coming true.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  We're only reading their own documents,
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  and still a lot of people just refuse to listen and laugh.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  Yes.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  Again, it's a perfect conditioning from birth onwards.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  Mainly through media and so on.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  Brzezinski did hit the nail on the head when he said
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  that shortly the public will be unable to reason for themselves.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  All their opinions will be given to them, fed to them by the media
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  through television and electronic media.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  And he recently said that again.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  The arrogance he said, you're dumb and laughed at the public.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  They enjoy it.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  Go ahead.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  Well, it's true, and it is perfect conditioning.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  It works very well.
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  And you see, the average person will look to others, especially young people,
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  the older people, for signs of alarm.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  And if there's no signs of alarm coming from the adults,
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  the child will think everything is just fine.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  And of course, the media will augment that.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  And tell them that you're living in the greatest time ever.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  Look at all the toys you have.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  You have fun.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  And there's nothing to worry about, but you're quite right.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  I've got a link to a CBC, Canada documentary
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  on the infertility in males.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  And it's astonishing.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  They've known this for 50 years.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  And we're plummeting.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  And literally, two men out of every 10 young men in college now
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  are almost sterile.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  In two or fair child, the rest are sterile pretty well.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  They have 85% emotility.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  That's called the vanishing male.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  The vanishing male.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  And that's only one study.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  But isn't it amazing that everything that's happened
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  has been directed at the male to make him sterile?
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  Well, they know what they're saying.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  Those aren't males because it's the male hormones
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  that also trigger the brain.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  And the different psychological developments
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  were meant to have.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  Instead, we have gelded effeminate men.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  I mean, I'm not attacking these men.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  I feel sorry for you.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  There's a reason you want to wear lipstick.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  There's a reason you desire other men.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  You have been hit hard by the New World Order.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  Yes.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  And when you're back to the League of Nations,
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  which was the birth of the United Nations really,
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  the Department of Population Control said
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  at the time they'd have to target the white to western male
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  because he was the most aggressive.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  He would stand up against their plans.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  He'd fight their plans.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  And therefore, they'd have to neutralize them.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  Well, guess what?
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  They've actually done it.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  They have.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  He's a pathetic creature.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  He believes manliness is grunting and acting tough
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  and going to a football game and never defending his republic
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  or never being informed.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  That's correct.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  That's correct.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  And the RFM does no doubt about it.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  And Carol quickly mentioned that these are physical changes
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  back in the 1960s.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  And we know that the hospital reports two noticed in females.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  Their hits were becoming suddenly, very suddenly,
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  with a sustained years span.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  They were becoming narrower.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  They were having problems with childbirth
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  because they are also targeted.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  But the male more so, he's definitely pretty well sterile now.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  He's neutered.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  That black off went well.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  But now they're going to get into more intense soft kills.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  I mean, they have to slowly ratchet up the cancer and the diabetes,
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  but now it's 3,000, 4,000 percent up.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  The mass death now, we're getting very comfortable with our deaths.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  What we find during World War II, when Canada actually led the world
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  in bacterial warfare and viral warfare,
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  they also had world meetings during World War II
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  to deal with the post-war society.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  And again, they said they'd have to target the males
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  and they wanted to reduce the population drastically.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  They said that the world war would not kill enough young men off.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  Now, in fact, the King of England was the one who authorized the study.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  Yeah, Royal Commission on Population.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  Yes, and what they did was they said to take down the third world countries,
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  mainly Africa, quickly because they were powerless.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  No one would stand up for them.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  They had no voice and no one really cared.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  Whereas the Western world, they'd have to bring in degenerative disability
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  or debilitating diseases.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  And that's what we have since from the 50s, 60s onwards.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  We suddenly had these chronic illnesses.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  Yeah, they hard kill the blacks and they soft kill the Western whites.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  And then a lot of racist whites go, yeah, they're killing those blacks.
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  Hey, pal, they're killing you too, okay?
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  Alan, we're going to come back to riveting info.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  By the way, everything he's telling you is documented.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  He has it up on his website. I have it on my website in my films.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  And films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global and Slave.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  I'm going to make a whole film just on how they're killing us.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  And that goes for you, the cops enforcing this, the bureaucrats, all of us.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  I'm sorry to give you the reality.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  We are being murdered by these people right now.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  It's called soft kill.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.

[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  bin Laden. This is his ammo.
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:01.000]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty? What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:33.000]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  Getseeds.net is offering an amazing special on 100 different varieties of heirloom vegetable seeds with a complete range of crops.

[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  Now see, even a song like this can be used for propaganda.
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  Because of the name of world peace and world unity, they're bringing in world tyranny and world eugenics.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:53.000]  So there's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
[1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  But nowhere is worse than the United States and Western Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand.
[1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  It's all the same laws, the same names, the same bureaucracy, web censorship coming in, it's all happening.
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:07.000]  A host of subjects I want to cover with Alan White.
[1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  Take a few calls for him too before he leaves us at 1-800-259-9231, specifically for our guest.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  But he can speak to any issue.
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  Alan, I interrupted you there at the break.
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  Get into the program of hard killing the blacks versus soft killing people in the United States.
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  And now where this agenda is going.
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  What they realized is that if they could make people ineligible for marriage partners, a long-term meeting,
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  by debilitating diseases, then that would help solve part of the problem.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  And sure enough, we find out that in the Western world we have what isn't...
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  You used to be called aging diseases or hitting the very young now.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  Yeah, juvenile arthritis is quite common. It's from the nocculations.
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:33:02.000]  And things like that, Epstein-Barr syndrome, all of these things suddenly broke out around the same period of time.
[1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:07.000]  And when people are lethargic and there's no fun at the parties, they need to go out much.
[1:33:07.000 --> 1:33:11.000]  And they end up being ineligible for a good meeting partner.
[1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:17.000]  And there's now even juvenile brain-wasting diseases like Alzheimer's.
[1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  Yes, we've noticed this.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  And autism has gone from 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 150.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  And it's now normal to have 1 in 150.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  This is through inoculations. It's designed targeting of specific age groups and genders and so on.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  And anybody that doubts their criminals, they lie all over the world and say it's the law to take the shots
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  when it's not the law to take the shots.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  So again, that's an illustration just of how bankrupt this government is.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  It is. We are run, as I say, by stealth and it's all covert.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  We're never told the truth. You cannot tell the children the truth.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  And the truth is the children will be very upset if mommy and daddy were killing them.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  And so mommy and daddy must pretend that everything out there is for your own benefit and is there to help you.
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  That's how you deal with animals when you put them to sleep.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  You don't scare the animal. You take them in nice and quiet and you inject them quietly and you die quietly.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  We are the children and these big bad rules at the top are deadly serious and they have been doing it.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  And that's the impasse that most people have when you die.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  That's what Joseph Burbles' wife when she brought them, she said it's medicine.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  The older one knew she was being murdered and she said, no mommy, she said it's your medicine.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  I love you. I'm the government. Please continue.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  Yes. And that is the trick of it. You can't tell the children you're killing them.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  You're taught the government is the big paternal factor in all of this is there for your own good.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  And they've trained the people to obey government without question.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  Every inoculation is given by faith from the people who come in to get the inoculation by the doctor or the nurse who gives it.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  They have no ability to analyze it for themselves.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  What it says on that file is what they believe.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  And yet I have never met anyone who's had a tour of a vaccine factory.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  In fact, one of the biggest vaccine factories in Canada is Baxter Laboratories.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  Baxter Laboratories used to be part of IG Farben.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  And we know what they were up to. They created the war machine for the Nazi regime.
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  Well, that's like Bayer knowingly shipping out to over a million people.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  HIV and hepatitis filled shots and the documents came out. They did it on purpose.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  They did it on purpose. We had a little blurb on a CBC documentary, Canada, which is the BBC of Canada.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  And they admitted that the World Health Organization, they'd sterilized millions of women in Africa and India
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  with a fake tetanus shot that was bioengineered, warfare-planned, engineered to attach itself to a hormone,
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  go straight to the ovaries and cause massive inflammation and sclerosis.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  Let's see, that's too scary for the public to admit so they won't check it out and find out it's true.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  They'll just keep taking their injections.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  Yes, they will. We are at a stage now where those who are gone are literally truly gone
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  and we have to accept there's going to be this massive losses in this war.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  It's a war that's quiet, it's silent, but there's this massive losses
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  and we cannot allow ourselves to be overwhelmed by how massive it all is.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  That's what Colonel Alexander calls it, silent weapons for quiet wars.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  That's right, that's right. So quietly how they put the pillow over the child's face and smother them lovingly.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  Yes, that's right. And it's difficult. The average person will go into, they'll shut down,
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  their minds will close into a withdrawal into a catatonic state
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  if they suddenly allow themselves to accept the fact and the evidence
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  and that is why they generally choose not to know. It's too terrifying for them.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  Once you know, you have to take action. You see, that's what's mandatory and they know that.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  What are you going to do when you realize there are people in this world,
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  lots of them and lots of employees working on methods to kill you off by all kinds of nasty diseases?
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  You can't negotiate with mass murderers.
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  You cannot grab a serial killer in the middle of a spree and say, please stop doing this.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  You see, we'd have to deal with this and that's something no one wants to question and bring up.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  Well, when I speak to crowds of people that don't know who I am or who are hostile,
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  I just say to them, you know about black men in Tuskegee and let them die of syphilis over 45 years
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  and spreading into tens of thousands? Yeah. And they say, yeah, we know about that.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  Do you know about the atomic soldiers? How they had to march into the bomb blast crater minutes after
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  and knowing it was going to kill them? Yeah, we know about that.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  Do you now know that they knew Agent Orange was going to sterilize and kill people? Yeah, we know about that.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  Okay, well, you do know about how they irradiated some foster children? No, we didn't know that.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  Well, did you know? And then you can go down into the horrors and that was all the black op government
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  creating and testing the cadres of Army officers, Army and Navy and Marine Corps and private corporate doctors
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  that believe this. And we'll go along with it. And I've studied Henry Paulson, Treasury Secretary,
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  the new Fed Chairman, all of them are part of Nature Conservancy.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  They all give anti-human speeches. They all talk about population reduction.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  Bill Gates, his father, the head of Planned Parenthood giving money to eugenics.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  I mean, when you look at these people, I mean, that's their ideology.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  They believe they're saving the earth by doing this.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  And but meanwhile, they're really cross species genetic engineering and doing things that are destroying the environment.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  Can you explain from your deep study, Alan Watt, which I really respect?
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  I mean, I really believe you can teach me something here.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  Hold on one second. I'll ask the question. Alan Watt, can you explain to me how they say they're killing the majority of us
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  and soft killing us and how beautiful and wonderful their work is and how disgusting and evil we are
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  and how we deserve to die, how they claim they're doing this all for the environment.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  Meanwhile, they say they're playing God and that no mutation is a bad mutation, that it's all natural
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  because they're doing this the revolution. They're an expression of evolution.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  And they constantly talk about destroying the planet, killing everyone.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  I mean, when you finally get to the higher levels, they admit that they are playing God and that they want to destroy creation.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  So you've got their serpents that believe they're killing everybody with soft kill to save the earth.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  But then at the top, they actually, what makes them tick? Go ahead.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  It is a religion with them. There's no doubt.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  They do believe that a long time ago, there was an evolution in the species
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  and that they have proven that they're part of the most advanced creatures who've ever been born and lived.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  By the very fact of their own personal family histories, the fact that they have amassed incredible wealth done through centuries
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  and held onto it, that's the key, is the ability for your offspring to take over that wealth and hold onto it.
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  So they've proven, and plus they have selective breeding where they have their mates matched up for them from other powerful families.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  This is how they rationalize it amongst themselves, that they are the proof, the living proof,
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  that they are part of the last great leap forward and they have the right to rule the lesser types.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  When you look into the religion of very high freemasonry, not the lower level stuff, but the high freemasonry,
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  which again is full of eugenic theory, you find that the elites talk about this.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  They believe that when you come through a new age, and these ages are 25,000 years or so,
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  long a great age, a platonic year they call it, because Plato talked about it too.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  He belonged to the ancient secret societies and they believed just like the Hindus do,
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  and it really is from the Hindu religion, that all the lesser types must be killed off.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  Now that's also part of the Darwinian theory, which is nothing but Hinduism dressed up.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  If you allow the lesser types to come through into the new age, they will bring down those advanced types.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  So they must be killed off to the last man. That's a true belief with a very firm belief.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  Now meanwhile, they have set up cryogenic systems across the planet.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  The World Wildlife Fund has three arcs across the world where they have all kinds of cells
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  of all living materials and animals and insects in cryogenic.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  That's it. They're going to destroy the planet to bring in the tyranny and then they will rebuild it
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  and through that crisis use that as the cover to exterminate us.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  And you're absolutely right, Alan, and I want you to continue here in a moment.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  The first barons of banking, the big newspaper out of the United Arab Emirates,
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  it talks about the World Bank's meeting there last week to set up the new international order.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  And he talks about global governance and new world orders taking over now.
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  But then the rest of his interview is about how families maintain wealth and how that is their supreme victory,
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  is that they carried on the wealth genetically and that they didn't let their children become decadent.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  And so he's saying he's most proud of the dynasty holding the wealth and expanding the power, not losing it.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  So people always ask how you have old elites or they say, I can't even balance my checkbook.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  How do they organize this? Well, that's why they're in control.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  And they believe because they, like they say in the film that was put out,
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  Apocalypse Now, where he talks about the beauty of being willing to chop little children's arms off.
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  You know, the strength, the diamond bullet.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  Now, please continue. You were getting to the point of the cryogenic arcs with the seed in animal banks,
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  the deep underground bases, which they admit, and their moon raker scenario.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  Yes, on public broadcasting, they did a documentary a couple of years ago on the World Wildlife Fund.
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  And one of their arcs is in Louisiana.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  It's headed by a professor, a woman professor from the local university there in New Orleans.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  And she is a massive facility, incredible, multi-million dollar facility.
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  She said there are three of them worldwide.
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  And they have already put together in vitrofacialization some of these sperms and ovums from the cryogenics.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  And they can put them into any animal and bring the creature up to term, regardless of what kind of creature it is.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  In other words, they could bring, they could grow a dog in the womb of a cat or even a lion who started off in a domesticated cat
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  and then transplant it from there to a bigger animal.
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  That's how far ahead they've done and they've been very, very successful.
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  So they could literally, in the case of disaster, which they can create themselves, do the Genesis Project.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  The Genesis Project was first mentioned, of course, in predictive programming in the Star Trek movies.
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  So they can reseed the planet and recreate it.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  Now, this is what they called, by Albert Pike's doctrine, the Luciferian doctrine.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  The whole idea, remember, of a Luciferian doctrine was that Lucifer wanted to remake everything in the way that he thought it should be made on Earth.
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  And in Freemasonry, they actually say that they're here to perfect that which is left imperfect by the creator itself.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  So by destroying all that was, they will bring in the new and they will perfect it in their own image.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  This is the true Luciferian doctrine that they talk about in their own writings.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  And they make fun of us in movies with Terry Gilliam, like Time Bandits with the devil.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  That's what he really wants. He wants to remake it the way he wants it.
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  Yes, exactly. And they are doing it. They are doing it. It's not going to happen. They are doing it.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  And of course, all over Europe, they've been up in the North Pole and in Iceland.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  They've built giant vaults, big government vaults.
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  And they're openly getting us ready with films that they've put out there about the public being mass sterilized.
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  No one being able to have children. Again, they're incrementally getting us ready for this.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  They're incrementally preparing us with all those predictive programming and all these movies, like Children of Men, that are coming out to do this.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  There is no doubt about that. These science fiction movies and the novels, too, are authorized to be out there from the world of future society.
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  And when you see who guides and funds the world of future society, it's the same big players. Again, the big names.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  The big multi-millionaire philanthropic organizations like the Rockefellers.
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  So wherever you find those names, you know this is the agenda.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  And they fund the authors just like H.G. Wells was funded to put out propaganda.
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  And they tell them what to include in their stories.
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  Well, here's a very simple one. It's admitted that G.I. Joe Cartoon in the 80s had some Defense Department funding.
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  And the whole thing is about join the military.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  And they, you know, phrase it as all individualistic and an army of one.
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  And then now that's their official slogan today. And they're fighting the Siebel group.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  But really the bad guys are always cooler. So what they were really predictive programming for was to be bad guys.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  That is correct. Young men, again, especially, and this is well understood, too.
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  The FBI have done studies on this. Young men who have no male role figure and most of them today have no male role figure.
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  Single mothers who are even ordering the sperm from different countries.
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  They don't want men. Men are just sperm banks, according to some of them.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  And the men grow up, they have no role model, but they still crave the masculine role model.
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  They either go for the gang leader and become part of the family and the gang leader.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  And one thing about gangs, they will stand up for their members, you see.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  And that's what young men like. Right or wrong, they'll stand up for you.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  And the next step, of course, is the military, which is the biggest gang of all.
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  It uses all the gang techniques. And you're brought in there, you belong for the first time in your life.
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  You can wear the black gear. You have a sense of power where before you were nobody.
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  And you're given the armaments and you can go and kick butt, as they like to say.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  So this is an engineered system. And unfortunately, that risen a generation of young men
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  who have had no fathers, most of them, they crave power.
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  Now they're accepted for the first time in their lives and they will do whatever they are told to do to be part of the team.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  Absolutely. And then all these shows, making the SWAT teams glorified.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  And it's so fun as they blow everybody up.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  And then for someone who's actually conscious, you watch that and it's so empty and so fake and so pathetic.
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  But for most adults, they really buy into it. They really believe the delusion.
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  And that's why the social engineers say they're not even really alive and they laugh at the zombies.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  They do. The zombies are replaceable, as we know.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  And that's why I tell people, don't start fighting. The greatest thing they've done down through history
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  is to get the poor fighting each other. And it's like Tam and he said in New York in 1800s, the mayor in New York, he said,
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  he said you can always hire half of the poor to kill and fight the other half.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  We mustn't attack the ones at the bottom. They're goons and they're easily replaceable from the hordes behind them that are up and coming.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  So we have to go for the ones at the top. And as I say, these are mass serial murderers.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  We have to, and this is the big part, no one wants to go near. We have to make them accountable and they must pay for their crimes.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  But they love setting the precedent to not pay as they openly admit that no transparency, no Congress,
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  Fed Chairman, former Fed Chairman come out and say we are above the law.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  We are keeping the money and the heads of the bank say we're keeping it for bonuses and they laugh at the public.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  But then, that's not enough to just throw it in our face. They then must lie and let us know they're lying
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  and have Paulson come out and say there's total transparency and taxpayers are in full control.
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  So stay there. I want to get your take on why they do that psychologically.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  They will throw it in your face but then to make it even worse, they then say, but I didn't just say that.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  I am so frustrated. I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  What?
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible. I read something and forget.
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  I forget people's names. I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  Okay, slow down. Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum and deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  It's all meant to dumb you down. You know, I can remember everything now, even entire books.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  What? How?
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information,
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  including entire books after they complete just 60 lessons.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  And they offer a no questions asked, no time limit, money-back guarantee.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  Wow. What's the website?
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  Now, don't forget. It's pmemory.net.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  The letter P, memory.net.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  Or at least we thought we did.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  Whitman, EVA director on the AT made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  He takes his hand off in year 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  Did you know that it's a documented fact?
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  In fact, clinically-detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  If you continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis, now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol, naturally and safely.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  By mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from freshwater organics.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  FPP strengthens skin, hair and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.

[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  There's a war on fear mind, there's a war on fear wallet, and you're physically being bombarded by the military industrial system.
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  The departmentalized doctors and nurses don't even know what's going on, don't even read their unpair-reviewed journals that admit all of this is happening.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  They're passing all sorts of laws to arrest you if you're hurt using a cuss word.
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  You know, to get more and more people in the system, that's an article up on Infowars.com, profanity police.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  They see you, not wearing a seatbelt, you go to jail. It's all about getting you in the system for smaller and smaller reasons.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  Your child says a cuss word on the playground they're arrested. Don't finish your homework, the parents are arrested.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  It's all part of lawlessness by the system, getting everybody else in there.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  Alan Watt talking about them flaunting it. Why are the private bankers?
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  Paulson comes out yesterday and says, yeah, we're giving money to secret groups, we're not going to tell you.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  And then they say, yeah, two trillions have been spent, we're not going to tell you where it went.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  And by the way, that's total transparency. I guess they're just teaching us double-think.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  It is a form of double-think, but it's also a magical spell in a sense, a psychological spell.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  Because even the average person will sense that there's nothing but massive corruption at the top.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  That further disarms you in a sense, makes you feel even more powerless to realize that there's such corruption above you.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  Latent, flagrant, arrogant corruption. This is the same sort of system the UCC during monarchies, when the monarchies ruled with impunity.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  And the king's men could just grab you and hang you on the spot for any reason they wished.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  So it's truly psychologically disarms you, makes you feel as if there's an amoeba floating in the sea with no power whatsoever.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  With these above-the-law type gangs that run this system.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  And it does work very well. People are apathetic when they hear this kind of stuff.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  And they become more apathetic if you're dejected and useless and helpless. So it is a psychological spell.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  Well, that's like the state of turning I had on, where they, in Maryland, said it's the law, you've got to take shots.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  Had thousands of them outside with riot police and dogs barking at crying children.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  And they didn't tell them it wasn't the law. They lied and he laughed on there and said,
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  I know Alex, I don't give my kids the shots and started laughing.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  That is correct. They do not give their children the same shots.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  And there are shots, of course, of the royalty and so on do get, but it's not available to the public.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  What we have fed are simply debilitating diseases.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  So what's going to happen in the near term and in the mid and long term? I mean, things are really getting turned up right now.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  Things are accelerating.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  Well, they always wanted this system to be global standardized. That's the first key to everything.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  Karl Marx came out with the centralization of government.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  We find it under the United Nations. We're now under regions.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  And when you go into documentation, the reason for the regions again is more centralized government over various countries.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  Now we're going into global society and they have to finish off those cultures which have not succumbed
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  and gone under and accepted the Western culture.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  So they'll be blown into existence if they cannot produce a generation with indoctrination from UNICEF
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  to be the next leaders of those countries. And then they'll be thoroughly westernized when they do.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  But at the end of the hundred years, as I say, they want their brave new world here one way or another.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  And they'll have planned A, B, C and D for every part of it, waiting in the wings.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  These guys will not give up.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  The evidence is in the longevity of their main members.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  These characters are still cropping around the globe giving meaty speeches to world bodies on a daily basis in their 80s and 90s.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  These guys have a religion. They are religious fanatics of the ultimate kind.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  They truly believe in their quest and they will keep going.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  We can't discuss things with them. We cannot compromise with these people.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  No, no, they're going to give us no quarters. Stay there, Alan. Let's continue talking about how they're murdering us.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  Bin Laden.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  This is his ammo.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  things in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies.

[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  Great darknesses upon the world. A criminal elite adopting eugenics as their scientific excuse to dumb us down, poison us, and tell us a mass is in control.
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  Our guest is going to be with us until about 15 after. So we're going to come back and take 3 or 4 calls in the next segment and let him go.
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  And Gary Francie joins us with the in the Fed protest nationwide, then Ralph Nader, and then, of course, on the Second Amendment front on this live Wednesday edition, the 12th day of November 2008.
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  We're also going to have Larry Pratt on. Alan Watt from CuttingToTheMatrix.com.
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  Alan, certainly they've conditioned the public to love their slavery or to feel like they're powerful or to buy the propaganda as if it was their own. But what are some of the solutions you see? I mean, there certainly is a great awakening happening.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  What are some of the solutions you see to turn this around?
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:48.000]  When it comes to solutions, you must first start with the individual. This is a war also against the individual. The United Nations has said so. They don't like individuality.
[1:59:48.000 --> 1:59:58.000]  They want conformity. They want the mass man. But the problem has been organization. The public themselves are unorganized.
[1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  The only organized side is the opponent side. And they have covered every base. Now, even when you try to start up a grassroots movement, you get infiltrated so quickly by people who start to see the right things and spin you off.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  Or before you know it, you're even on the global agenda towards a better type of global society. So we have to be very, very careful.
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  We need organization. And what really has happened too, you see, the culture at one time was fairly standard throughout the Western Hemisphere. It was a Christianized culture.
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  And even if people didn't believe in the doctrine, they still had the culture from Christianity. And so they could cooperate and help each other and so on.
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  They were bonded to an extent with each other through the culture itself. That is why that had to be destroyed. And now you're left floundering in this space where there's nothing to really hang on to except what you're given as the new normals.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  That's the big problem. People have to start to find the strength within themselves first, first and foremost, before they can go to help other people.
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  And they must overcome their fear. Fear is the greatest killer and stagnator of all. You have to overcome the fear because we're getting killed anyway.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  When you realize that and you are going to die one day, you have nothing to lose. And you must retain or even gain empathy for other people around you.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  Even those who don't understand, it makes you tremendously sad to see them and their ignorance. They don't know what's happening.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  They are parroting just like automatons, things from the media. They don't know they're being killed.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  You don't have your humanity till you do stand up and fight back. And absolutely, we have no chance out of this if we don't speak out and get involved and resist.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  Now, the enemy tried to condition us to go for the banker takeover, but 95-98% of the polls, 1,001 phone calls to Congress, were against it.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  So the good news is, on more and more fronts, people are not buying it. That's why I was so hurt by the Obama thing, them calling him the one, the savior of the God.
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  Because his whole agenda is identical to Bush's, who was another puppet. And it's just sad to see my fellow humans being conned.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  Yes, once again, we've got to stop looking for two-legged gods and realize that every single one of us is our own champion.
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  We are our champions ourselves. And everyone can make a difference when they start to speak up and complain and say no more of this.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  We've had enough. We've had too much. Thank you very much.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  And we've got to start, literally, setting up organizations to try these people in the future when we do turn all of this around.
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  We've got to start organizations up and tell them we're coming after you.
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  Absolutely. Let's come back and take a few final phone calls for Alan White.
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  Then we'll look forward to the exciting resistance of the Fed. People actually protesting the real government, the real elite, nationwide with the in-the-fed demonstrations, November 22nd. Stay with us.
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  And beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  They turned off the telephones and emailed. They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond many Americans' reach.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  The stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business. Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  Everything is zeroing in on food. One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new-old order has a lot less control over you.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the final list of high quality, freeze dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  Take action today. The first step is getting storable food.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  Very cramped. She come up in about six, seven minutes.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  Right now we're talking to Alan Watt.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  Alan, I'm going to take a few calls here quickly for you from Mike, Kelton, Lisa, and Jim.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:57.000]  But tell folks about your websites.
[2:05:57.000 --> 2:06:05.000]  Yeah, it's cutting through themetrics.com and also alanwattsentiencecentinal.eu for Europe.
[2:06:05.000 --> 2:06:09.000]  And they can download lots of pre-talks I've given in the past.
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:15.000]  Covering a lot of this information and the big agencies and foundations and big players behind it.
[2:06:15.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  And I get them links to their scripts actually and their books and so on.
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  Which tell you, the whole agenda, it is out in the open.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  HG Wells called it the open conspiracy.
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  And as I say, what I'd like to happen one day in the future, after maybe even millions of us have died off, been killed off,
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  if it cannot crush the memory and the history of the acts that we have, we keep the records.
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  We are the keepers of the records of history.
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  Then one day hopefully we can have a new Nuremberg trial and bring them all and all their paid blackies,
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  all their scientists that have happily worked on these agencies to kill us all, bring them all to justice.
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  And this would have to be televised worldwide because we could never forget what's been done to the public.
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  It's a horror show. They must stand trial for this one day.
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  Absolutely. Let's talk to Mike in Illinois. You're on the air, Mike.
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  How are you guys doing? Good.
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  I got a question for Alan, actually two of them.
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  One of which is how is Obama going to be falling into this eugenics program?
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  It seems like everyone they put into office, they have some kind of personal agenda that they're trying to meet for their ultimate goal or ultimate plan.
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  Well, I've got a comment after Alan. Go ahead, Alan.
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  Well, I don't think they have a personal agenda. I think they do as they're told.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  I think Obama actually has been bred for his task. And yes, you will find this has happened in the past.
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:52.000]  If you go into his mother's history, she was a born and bred revolutionary for the world system.
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  I thought it funny in his speech he talked about African-American slaves and so on.
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  Now, the guy was not an African-American slave. His father was a Kenyan and he called him a prince.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  So he's using all tactics, simply as politicians do, to get into power.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:15.000]  But he is simply a front man.
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  He's also related very closely to Bush chaining all of them.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  Yes.
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  And they're all much more related than the general public.
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  Again, that's probably not even his father, folks. Obama has been groomed. Ron Paul said that here.
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  Listen, they'll use his individual looks and what he says and does for their angle, their spin,
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  to give the illusion of choice and a variance between the puppet to puppet.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  But Obama, because he's black, is going to be perfect to lead.
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  He says he wants to get GMO into Africa. He says he wants to give women their choice.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  That means Planned Parenthood sterilizing them, injections, abortion.
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  So yes, he'll make sure that the black babies aren't born and he'll be held for that and Jesse Jackson will cry all day.
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  That is correct. You've said it all. This is how they play the game.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  And rather than giving a revolution every four or five years, they give us this choice of voting in a new party
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  who simply continues the agenda. This is how the trick has been played for years.
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  Folks, they know that humans build things. We create things. We're amazing.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  The globalist system is about diverting you into halls of mirrors, little false realities so you never truly live
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  and see reality for what it is so you can affect reality.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  You are meant, you know, we're a species that's like a coral reef. We grow on top of each other.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  And they've learned to engineer that and make sure we never leave anything behind.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  Only their hand leaves something behind. I know how short my life is.
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  I know it's about the mark I leave, what I do for the species. I live on through the species.
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  I have a communal love of the species whereas this elite believe they are a super species
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  and they have a religious hate of you and your family. They want to murder you and your family.
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  They love children dying of cancer. They love poison. They love dumbing down.
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  They love destruction. It's dominance for them. It's like sitting on you. Alan?
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  Yes, they are psychopathic. They are so inbred and you'll find Obama, I'm sure, if you truly get ahold of his real history,
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  he's just another one who's been created for the purpose, literally purpose-designed human.
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  We find the same thing happened with Armand Hammer. Armand Hammer's father was way up there in communism in the United States.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  He was done a few times in charge for backstreet abortions. He was immediately into the abortion debates way back then.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  And then Armand himself was sent off to study with a rabbi at the age of five. He left home at the age of five
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  to be indoctrinated in his role for life, to acquire millions of dollars and eventually to get an office right next door to Lenin.
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  So these guys are trained and bred for their purposes and their duty through their system to their cause, to their own elite.
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  Yeah, gotta jump, Mike. Kelton in Texas, go ahead.
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  Are you guys there?
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  Yeah, we're on the airworld right now.
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  Okay, thank you. I just had a quick comment. You guys are absolutely right on as far as how the police are implementing tyranny at the communities.
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  I'll give you a prime example. About a year and a half ago, I was pulled over. Well, I actually wasn't pulled over.
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  I was at the bus stop from Austin, Cleveland, and all of a sudden police officers just pulled me over, had me spread my arms on the car.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  And I was telling them, I told them that, hey, you know, my license are in my pocket.
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  My first ticket is in my pocket. They were saying, well, where's your luggage? But my luggage got lost.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  And they put me in the backseat of the car, ran my information, and let me go.
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  Oh, but this is one important thing. Before the guy let me get up off the car, he said, don't make an MF and move or you'll become a statistic.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  And I found that that is still...
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  It's not humiliating you, letting you know you're lower than dirt. They're told to do that to train us to accept enslavement.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  But don't worry, that cop's going to have his pension fund taken by his global masters.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  He's going to be hurt by the very same system he loves. So go ahead and shoot your kid up, cops, with vaccines, laugh at us.
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  Go ahead and serve the system. Go ahead and think your talent.
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  No, it's disgusting. You see, the problem, again, is we have a generation who've been brought up and their heroes have been the goons that they're now dressed up as.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  They've become what they wanted to be, the ones with the power.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  Look at the movies they watch, look at the language in the movies, eat this, suck our, et cetera, et cetera.
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  I mean, this is a mentality that was purposely put out there for this generation, the generation they're now using as the bullies.
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  So we also have psychopaths in all strata of society, unfortunately.
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  And they do hire the low-level psychopaths who would otherwise be smashing windows on streets and stealing stuff from the stores.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  And they put uniforms on them. So they always use the degenerate class to control the rest of the people.
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  It's not them anymore. It's Officer Dimomsky.
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  Another got me a badge and you're going to learn to respect me.
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  All right. Appreciate your call, Kelton. Lisa and Jim, we've just got to leave now because we've got our next guest on.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  But next Wednesday, Alan Watt, because he's just such a great man, we appreciate him, has agreed to come on for two hours next Wednesday.
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  So I'll talk to you in seven days, Alan.
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  I will do.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  You bet. Take care. Appreciate you spending time with us.
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  All right. We've got Gary Franchi the next 30 minutes, maybe longer until Ralph Nader joins us.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  And I always enjoy having Gary Franchi up. Gary Franchi does so much around the community.
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  And he was involved with the whole freedom to fascism, getting that video out to people.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  And he's been a talk show host in his own right.
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  But he came up with a great idea to have in the Fed protest every November 22nd when they killed JFK because he tried to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  And I think of no better guest to have on than Gary Franchi on the heels of Alan Greenspan on national television on PBS saying the Fed is accountable to no one and can do anything and everything they want.
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  So Gary Franchi, good to have you here with us.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  Alex, it's a pleasure to be here. Thank you for having me.
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  Oh, you bet. Now tell the listeners specifically how this idea to physically go protest the Fed developed instead of protesting the fake titular heads, the figure heads, the puppets like Bush and Obama.
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  Well, I mean, we could sit around and we can complain about the Republicans and the Democrats, but we know that they are just the pawns on the chessboard.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  The real power comes from the source of the money, and that's the Federal Reserve system. You've known this for a long time. I've known this for a long time.
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  And it's just it's time that we wake up the American people and say we are going to go to the source of the problem. We're going to raise public awareness. We are going to shout at the top of our lungs.
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  We're going to say it is time we're making a declaration on the 22nd of November to end the Federal Reserve system.
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  That is the day that the Federal Reserve was birthed on Jekyll Island.
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  So that's why we chose the day and, you know, it's also near the Kennedy assassination date. And we know that he went up against them as well.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  Oh, yeah. I mean, you know, Kennedy had, you know, start printing up U.S. notes started competing with the Federal Reserve notes.
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:07.000]  You know, they had to get rid of him too. So it's time. It is time.
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  These bankers are running rampant over the American people. I mean, Paul Sin today is saying that he's not going to put money towards this bailout money, towards the mortgages.
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  He's going to put it towards credit cards instead. I mean, it's okay.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  And again, that's not paying off the debts of the credit card holders that and then just giving that money to them.
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  The credit card holder will still have to pay. It's just the credit card company gets double paid. Then they're going to take that money as bonuses.
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  And then he said yesterday it's all secret. But then today he said it's all transparent and they say true trillion is just missing.
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Isn't that convenient? You know, the former head of Goldman Sachs is, you know, pumping all this money that you can't even track back to his Wall Street buddies.
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  This is a disgrace. This is high treason. And the American people will not stand for it anymore.
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  Never ever in American history have we had an opportunity like we do today to speak to the American people's minds because the tip of everyone's tongue on the news all across the place, all across the country.
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  It's bailout. It's the economy. Now we have the opportunity to explain why. Where is the source of the power?
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  Absolutely. Point out who the real culprit is. Stay there, my friend. We're going to be right back.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:59.000]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and potentially deadly toxins. That's why there's puricleer from Ripple Creek.
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  Puricleer contains a proprietary blend of ingredients, including a cilantro extract and alphalipoic acid, among other ingredients formulated specifically to promote body cleansing.
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  Puricleer also has ingredients selected to promote improved circulation to enhance activity so that heavy metals may be more effectively captured and removed from the body.
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  Order Puricleer now by calling Ripple Creek at 203-331-0363 or go to RippleCreek.com.
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:40.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to the south of Bin Laden.
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.

[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic. This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:55.000]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver, gold, and copper with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.
