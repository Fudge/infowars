[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  Christmas music! Oh my gosh, bigotryt! Bigotryt religious ascety!
[00:09.000 --> 00:15.000]  Bandit! The status card! Bandit! Turn it off! Turn it off!
[00:15.000 --> 00:24.000]  Reading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24.000 --> 00:30.000]  It was not Alex Jones, it was I. Here's Morgan.
[00:30.000 --> 00:42.000]  When openly he came out, what was his last Friday about that duck dynasty bedraggled, bearded buffoon.
[00:42.000 --> 00:49.000]  Then I said, I want him banned. Here's my exact headline from that Drudge Report.
[00:49.000 --> 00:58.000]  He says, here's Morgan's first amendment. Shorten protect a vile bigot like Phil Robertson.
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  And I am very pleased to announce to everyone, I have the headlines here in front of me,
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  Banning Christmas Trees in Texas. Banning everything. Make it all illegal.
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  Here's the Newsmax headline. Christmas Trees Bandit Texas School called Draconian.
[01:14.000 --> 01:21.000]  I don't think it's Draconian for Dracool. The symbol of my queen is a red dragon.
[01:21.000 --> 01:29.000]  And the red dragon sees Christ and any signant of the cross as an enemy to our overall operation.
[01:29.000 --> 01:39.000]  Once we have taken your firearms, we will be able to stop on your liberties, your property, and finally your children.
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  As the great Seville has done, we are here broadcasting worldwide.
[01:45.000 --> 01:56.000]  And I am the mighty, the tyrannical, the gigantic pig creature, Piers the Coward Morgan.
[01:56.000 --> 02:05.000]  And I am here to let you all know that I agree with restricting the first amendment.
[02:05.000 --> 02:17.000]  Walnut Christmas Day. Now that country bumpkin, pumpkin-headed, redneck, filthy, gigantic ape like Texan,
[02:17.000 --> 02:24.000]  who looks like a gorilla at feeding time at the zoo, has seen a giant bucket full of bananas,
[02:24.000 --> 02:33.000]  as he desires to be free upon the land, living in liberty and not in my greater dungeon.
[02:33.000 --> 02:43.000]  I heard that, that poor scene, pimp of freedom, promoting the night before Christmas.
[02:43.000 --> 02:51.000]  And so I have demanded of my slave that he complete the night before Christmas and come back to you live
[02:51.000 --> 02:59.000]  on the other side of this Christmas Day audition on 25th of December 2013.
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  And know that in 2014, we will get your guns, there will be more stage shootings.
[03:05.000 --> 03:11.000]  We will start more wars, we will fund out kinder to gut every Christian in Africa,
[03:11.000 --> 03:19.000]  North Africa into the Maghreb of the Middle East, and our hellish forces will rise.
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  And we will talk in a trendy voice so that you think we're night threatening,
[03:24.000 --> 03:32.000]  for our true aim is total domination. Oh, excuse me, I'm trendy and shanty,
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  and in the firearms, so that we might be trendy.
[03:38.000 --> 03:45.000]  Ha ha ha, tea my friend, let me bound your arms and legs, oh excuse me,
[03:45.000 --> 03:52.000]  so that we might be friendly, and so that we won't be turning in our firearms in the power structure,
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.000]  we won't be backing off at the least in any way.
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.000]  Again, as I said, we're going to get a break in a moment, and just remember the state is God.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  Don't resist, don't speak up, don't get angry, or raise your voice.
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  Oh, that's this predator, don't do that, that is exactly what will defeat us.
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  I mean, oh excuse me, rare, rare truthfulness.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  I should have had Alex back on, but I didn't because we defeated him so badly,
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  record ratings for us, and we didn't have him back on because he discredited himself so well,
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  and we don't want to have him discredit himself again.
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.000]  No, no, no, not more of that blasphemous music, turn it off.
[04:36.000 --> 04:44.000]  Now, that is a derailleur, you there in the control room, I will shut that racist,
[04:44.000 --> 04:51.000]  bigger head, knives on a chalkboard, shut it down.
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.000]  Nothing worse than a redneck pumpkin head in the mu-
[04:56.000 --> 05:03.000]  The facts are in, the studies are legion, sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.000]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[05:10.000 --> 05:16.000]  Simple, dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet,
[05:19.000 --> 05:21.000]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLine fluoride shield formulation,
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.000]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[05:44.000 --> 05:50.000]  Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at infowarslife.com today.

[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  That's infowarslife.com.
[05:56.000 --> 06:02.000]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[06:02.000 --> 06:06.000]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere.
[06:06.000 --> 06:09.000]  From all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents,
[06:09.000 --> 06:13.000]  radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[06:13.000 --> 06:15.000]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[06:15.000 --> 06:20.000]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[06:20.000 --> 06:23.000]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[06:23.000 --> 06:29.000]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[06:29.000 --> 06:32.000]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[06:32.000 --> 06:41.000]  I've searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine exclusively available at infowarslife.com.
[06:41.000 --> 06:47.000]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  Survival shield nascent iodine.
[06:49.000 --> 06:55.000]  Secure your super high quality nascent iodine today at infowarslife.com.
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  That's infowarslife.com.
[06:57.000 --> 07:06.000]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.000]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[07:20.000 --> 07:26.000]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at infowarslife.com.
[07:26.000 --> 07:33.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[07:33.000 --> 07:40.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.000]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[07:45.000 --> 07:48.000]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[07:48.000 --> 07:54.000]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  Is this Christmas music?
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  Is this a sensitive?
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  Is this illegal?
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.000]  The Alex Jones Show.
[08:11.000 --> 08:14.000]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[08:14.000 --> 08:22.000]  Oh come, oh come, he may end you in a...
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  Report this to Hermann Security immediately.
[08:27.000 --> 08:34.000]  If they are allowed to have any culture pre-globalist, they will resist us.
[08:34.000 --> 08:44.000]  We must eradicate everything until they only worship corporate media, Kanye West and anything other.
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  Then mindlessness must be bad.
[08:47.000 --> 08:54.000]  Justin Bieber must be the signant, their hero.
[08:54.000 --> 09:04.000]  If they look upwards to the stars, if they honor trailblazers, they will escape us undoubtedly.
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  Oh, we just broke in there ladies and gentlemen, took over from the New World Order.
[09:12.000 --> 09:20.000]  That's part of our fairness doctrine though, is to give them some of their own time.
[09:20.000 --> 09:27.000]  To let the establishment come out and basically promote their own ideas.
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  And then we'll go back into promoting our ideas, which are liberty, freedom, human empowerment and the fact that you have free will.
[09:34.000 --> 09:41.000]  Doesn't mean I have to agree with your lifestyle or what you stand for as long as you don't try to control my life and tell me what to do.
[09:41.000 --> 09:49.000]  The problem is in the name of equality, the system has created an incredible police state where they can hide their failures, cover up their lives
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.000]  and then demonize those that are engaged in any type of opposition to what they're up to.
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.000]  You know, I talked about this yesterday. It is, by the way, again Christmas Day, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:59.000 --> 10:04.000]  And if you're listening in the last segment, that was not really Pierce Morgan, that was yours truly.
[10:04.000 --> 10:15.000]  Having a little bit of fun, because when I end up taping these special broadcasts for days like Christmas, we're not live, but at least it's original.
[10:15.000 --> 10:23.000]  I tend to do it at night after I've been working a long day and, well, I'm a little bit less inhibited in the evening and have some fun.
[10:23.000 --> 10:30.000]  Because you've got to have gallows humor with all of this. You've got to do it or you would literally go crazy.
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.000]  But I see articles like this, and I mentioned yesterday from Reuters,
[10:34.000 --> 10:48.000]  super bug bacteria widespread in U.S. chicken consumer group has done a study and shows about half of the raw chicken breast in nationwide sampling carried antibiotic resistant super bug bacteria.
[10:48.000 --> 10:55.000]  A U.S. consumer group said on Thursday calling for stricter limits on the use of medicines on livestock.
[10:55.000 --> 11:01.000]  It could make it more difficult to treat people if they became ill after eating chicken with antibiotic resistant bacteria.
[11:01.000 --> 11:08.000]  So consumer reports which describes itself as the world's largest independent product testing organization.
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.000]  And let me just give you this gift on Christmas here. I'm thankful for a lot of things.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  And it's this.
[11:16.000 --> 11:30.000]  The globalist know full well what they're doing and they're trying to produce superplagues naturally through antibiotics and over vaccination that they can then blame basically on an organic outbreak.
[11:30.000 --> 11:39.000]  That is a natural outbreak. So they don't get the final comeuppance and don't get the karmic weight of it.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  And again, that's their mindset, their view of it.
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  And a lot of them have written this, but they say the superplagues are coming and it's going to wipe everything out.
[11:48.000 --> 11:55.000]  And my issue is I have had a cousin die. My uncle be extremely ill in the hospital for weeks.
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.000]  And I've seen a lot of people outside of Texas I know die.
[12:00.000 --> 12:07.000]  And they've done the actual swabs and sent them off to all different private groups you name it.
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  The CDC won't return them. I've talked to the doctors. I won't tell them what it is, but private labs have tested it.
[12:12.000 --> 12:20.000]  And it's some type of drug resistant, antibiotic resistant, microplasm or microscopic, micro-microbacteria basically.
[12:20.000 --> 12:26.000]  Proto-bacteria. And then I'm seeing articles saying, oh, it's flu. We think it's the flu.
[12:26.000 --> 12:34.000]  But then I even know people in the hospitals they're talking about in Tyler, Texas, outside Houston and other places.
[12:34.000 --> 12:40.000]  So in South Texas, Northeast Texas, Tyler, I have family and friends that are in these.
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  I know they've done the test. They do the flu test a couple of days. They didn't the flu.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  They can't find regular bacteria. They can't find other viruses. It's a microplasm.
[12:48.000 --> 12:55.000]  And then I'm reading, oh my gosh, you know, it's the flu. Go get the flu shot, which only lowers your immune system in the major studies.
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.000]  They never guess a year before the right flu. And if you don't guess the right one, it doesn't do anything. It's a fraud.
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  This is a government caught in all this secret testing against the population over and over and over again.
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.000]  So why on earth would we believe anything they say or do now?
[13:12.000 --> 13:19.000]  And then I read about how half of the chicken, that means you leave it on your countertop, you touch it, whatever it makes salmonella look tame,
[13:19.000 --> 13:26.000]  have bacteria where the chickens have been fed, the most powerful antibiotics that even make their kidneys fail,
[13:26.000 --> 13:33.000]  show that in these infested, hellish, giant facilities where they can have a million birds in one building,
[13:33.000 --> 13:38.000]  where the people that worked there were respirators because of all the ammonia, the urine, and the feces,
[13:38.000 --> 13:44.000]  and these animals in hellish conditions, all of this factory farming is going to come back on us, the humans.
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  You create an artificial environment where they're even breeding chickens that don't have beaks or cutting their beaks off.
[13:49.000 --> 13:56.000]  They don't even have proper legs. They're in tiny cages being force fed, you know, and you pay a dollar less or something for a chicken
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  that's bred like this and live like this instead of getting an open range one.
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.000]  And I'm not some big animal rights activist, but I'm telling you folks, what you do to little things comes back on you.
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  And I am for humane raising them, animals open air, and then humane slaughter.
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.000]  And that's something that you can say that's truly liberal. You reap what you sow.
[14:16.000 --> 14:25.000]  What you do to things comes back on you, and now they are feeding them these antibiotics to stop the superplagues of bacteria, viruses, mites.
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.000]  I mean, I have been in turkey plants because I worked for large animal vets and stuff and had buddies that worked at them
[14:31.000 --> 14:38.000]  and they would say, look at this, and I mean, I've been inside of them and it is a concentration camp from hell.
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  I mean, and look, I'm somebody who's been in a cow slaughterhouse. They bring them in. They're all scared.
[14:43.000 --> 14:49.000]  They hit them with big gas powered, you know, air powered jacks in the head that I can handle because we're slaughtering animals.
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  We're eating them. At least they died a few minutes and that's still inhumane. I don't like it.
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  It's a lot better on the farm where you take a cow. They don't know what's coming.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  You shoot them in the head to haul them up and butcher them. They die instantly.
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  But the issue here is they want to ban that instead of all the big factory farms.
[15:05.000 --> 15:12.000]  And it's the factory farms actually lobbying in Europe and here to shut down regular family farms, the regulations, which is more humane
[15:12.000 --> 15:19.000]  so their operations can operate. And I'm telling you, that's where this type of plague is coming from.
[15:19.000 --> 15:25.000]  I want to be thankful on Christmas Day. I want to be thankful for my family. I want to be thankful for my health.
[15:25.000 --> 15:32.000]  I want to be thankful to my God and Creator, Jesus Christ for consciousness. I want to be thankful for my forebearers who weren't perfect
[15:32.000 --> 15:39.000]  but were trailblazers in liberty and brought us the freest, most wealthy country in world history that of course got overrun by the corrupt.
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  They always take over whatever's the most powerful to use as their own system.
[15:43.000 --> 15:50.000]  And I want to be thankful for all of you out there that have supported us over the years and we just couldn't do any of this without you.
[15:50.000 --> 15:57.000]  And I am a cracked and failed vessel in many levels but I'm still willing and I'm stupid and ignorant like Private Joker
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.000]  but I've got guts and guts is enough to quote Full Metal Jacket and the Great Stanley Kubrick.
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  So to all of you, I hope you've had a great Christmas, spend it with your family.
[16:06.000 --> 16:12.000]  I'm honored you're tuning in on Christmas Day to all our friends in the alternative media and you know who you are.
[16:12.000 --> 16:18.000]  Thank you so much for all you've done for us and the pitiful things I'm up to half the time.
[16:18.000 --> 16:26.000]  But everyone's recognized that M-Fall Wars and our crew though pitiful at times have also reached the heights of the stars in human liberty
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  and have really been uncensored and unscripted and have done some amazing things together.
[16:31.000 --> 16:41.000]  And so I have just been absolutely incredibly, dynamically honored to be here and to talk to you.
[16:41.000 --> 16:48.000]  The 2013 has been a great year for liberty but a horrible year for tyranny, the best of times, the worst of times.
[16:48.000 --> 16:54.000]  For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction and we've seen all of that demonstrated here this year.
[16:54.000 --> 17:03.000]  And we're really seeing the authoritarianism of the so-called left right now who are about as left, about as liberal as Hitler.
[17:03.000 --> 17:12.000]  By the way, I was a socialist, these terms mean nothing, it's about freedom, it's about slavery, it's about authoritarians and it's about libertarians.
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.000]  It's about autocrat control freaks and it's about people lovers.
[17:16.000 --> 17:24.000]  Man, I love people. I love black people. I love old people. I love white people. I love young people.
[17:24.000 --> 17:32.000]  I love people from Europe. I love people from Asia. I love people from Latin America. I love people from the North Pole.
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.000]  I love straight people. I love gay people. I like everybody.
[17:36.000 --> 17:42.000]  But I don't like the system claiming it represents different groups and playing us off against each other.
[17:42.000 --> 17:51.000]  And I have had enough of people trying to govern my life and your life and I'm just here not claiming I got all the answers.
[17:51.000 --> 17:59.000]  But I'm here to tell you, the establishment has the answers, the answer to their technotronic, technological, technocratic takeover.
[17:59.000 --> 18:05.000]  And it's an answer that we aren't part of. It's an equation we don't exist in and it's a fraud.
[18:05.000 --> 18:10.000]  And these people are the last individuals that should be running our society.
[18:10.000 --> 18:24.000]  So whether you're an atheist or an agnostic, Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Zoroaster, Hindu, Buddhist or a globalist minion,
[18:24.000 --> 18:32.000]  I care about you and want you to have a future. But if you're a transhumanist, anti-human technocrat control freak that thinks they're better than everybody
[18:32.000 --> 18:37.000]  and has an overriding instinct to dominate and destroy diversity in the name of diversity
[18:37.000 --> 18:42.000]  and override us with your plastic corporate garbage, I got some news for you.
[18:42.000 --> 18:49.000]  As for me and mine, we know who you are. We know where you come from and we know where you live.
[18:49.000 --> 18:56.000]  Just like you know where we live with the NSA, it's a small world and everybody knows where everybody lives.
[18:56.000 --> 19:03.000]  And you're not going to turn something like this loose. You're not going to bring in a tyranny like this and get away with it.
[19:03.000 --> 19:12.000]  And in your bones and in your guts and in your sinew, you know that that is the case.
[19:12.000 --> 19:23.000]  And as one human do another, man to man, I'm telling you, stop cheating humanity, stop cheating your ancestors, stop cheating this species
[19:23.000 --> 19:28.000]  because you will never get away with the crap you've pulled.
[19:28.000 --> 19:42.000]  And follow wars.com on this Christmas Day Worldwide Edition playing the sacrilegious Christian music that makes the statist and their god of the state
[19:42.000 --> 19:47.000]  and all its devilish production, all its devilish fruit, get angry.
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  Yesterday I only read about a third of the night before Christmas.
[19:50.000 --> 19:57.000]  When we come back, I'll attempt to read the whole thing unfettered with limited commentary straight ahead.
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.000]  The facts are in. The studies are legion.
[20:00.000 --> 20:07.000]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[20:07.000 --> 20:11.000]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[20:11.000 --> 20:16.000]  Simple. Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[20:16.000 --> 20:22.000]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[20:22.000 --> 20:28.000]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLife fluoride shield formulation,
[20:28.000 --> 20:36.000]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body,
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  but a whole host of toxic substances.
[20:38.000 --> 20:43.000]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  I use fluoride shield every day.

[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  We'll stop it and most pistol rounds.

[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  More protection, more stopping power, more mobility, and it weighs less than five pounds.

[24:07.000 --> 24:11.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.000]  Whatever happened to Christmas.
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  Oh, it's hard to turn music like that off.
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.000]  It's gone and left no trace.
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.000]  Even if you don't like Christmas or Christianity, don't you like beauty?
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  Whatever happened to Christmas.
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.000]  I can go hear some Hindu songs or some Jewish songs or that Middle Eastern music.
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.000]  I love that stuff.
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  I'm like, oh, that's offensive. Turn that off.
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.000]  Whatever happened to Christmas.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  I love Christmas.
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.000]  For so long, I was so focused on finding the World Order.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  They commercialized Christmas so much, I turned my back on it.
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.000]  Now, more than ever, the older I get, the more I love sentimentality.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  More I love memories.
[24:56.000 --> 24:59.000]  Family and everything that happens.
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  Remember.
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  Alright, look, I butchered this yesterday.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  I did about a third of the night before Christmas and went into a histrionic rant.
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  Let me just read the night before Christmas, actually, without adding any comments.
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  Because it really is some good poetry.
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  I forget who wrote the night before Christmas.
[25:18.000 --> 25:21.000]  Let's look that up. You can tell me in my ear in a minute.
[25:21.000 --> 25:27.000]  It was the night before Christmas when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  The stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that St. Nicholas would soon be there.
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  The children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugar plums,
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  danced in their heads and mama in her kerchief and I in my cap,
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.
[25:44.000 --> 25:50.000]  When out on the lawn there arose such a planter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
[25:50.000 --> 25:56.000]  And to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
[25:56.000 --> 26:03.000]  And the moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the luster of midday to objects below
[26:03.000 --> 26:09.000]  when what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh and a tiny reindeer.
[26:09.000 --> 26:15.000]  With a little old driver so lively and quick I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
[26:15.000 --> 26:23.000]  More rabid than eagles his coarsers they came and he whistled and shouted and called them by name.
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.000]  Now Dasher, now Dancer, now Prancer, now Vixen.
[26:27.000 --> 26:34.000]  On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner, on Blitzen, to the top of the porch, to the top of the wall.
[26:34.000 --> 26:42.000]  Now Dasher away, Dasher away, Dasher away all as dry leaves that before the wind hurricane fly.
[26:42.000 --> 26:48.000]  When they met with an obstacle, mount to the sky, show up to the house top,
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.000]  the coarsers they flew with a sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too.
[26:53.000 --> 26:59.000]  And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof the prancing and pying of each little hoof
[26:59.000 --> 27:06.000]  as I drew in my head and was turning around. Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
[27:06.000 --> 27:13.000]  He was dressed in a fur from his head to his foot and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
[27:13.000 --> 27:19.000]  A bundle of toys he flung on his back and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
[27:19.000 --> 27:27.000]  His eyes how they twinkled, his dimples how merry, his cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry.
[27:27.000 --> 27:34.000]  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow and the beard on his chin was as wide as the snow.
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.000]  The stump of his pipe he held tight in his teeth and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
[27:41.000 --> 27:48.000]  He held a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.
[27:48.000 --> 27:56.000]  He was chubby and plump, a right old jolly elf and he laughed when I saw him in spite of myself.
[27:56.000 --> 28:02.000]  A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
[28:02.000 --> 28:07.000]  He spoke not a word but went straight to his work and filled all the stockings.
[28:07.000 --> 28:14.000]  They turned with a jerk and lay his finger aside to his nose and giving a nod up the chimney he rose.
[28:14.000 --> 28:23.000]  He sprang to his sleigh to the team and gave a whistle and away they all flew like the down the bofistle that I heard him exclaim.
[28:23.000 --> 28:30.000]  There as he drove out of sight, happy Christmas to all and to all a good night.
[28:30.000 --> 28:35.000]  There is my reading of it was the night before Christmas.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  Clement Clark Moore, when was that written?
[28:37.000 --> 28:45.000]  1800s. I love literature. I love beauty. I love it all and I will defend it to the end against the usurper.
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  And I know you joined me in that. They found the year 1823.
[28:50.000 --> 28:57.000]  All right. Well, great job to the crew. Coming up, we've got a bunch of key interviews and more on this Christmas Day.
[28:57.000 --> 29:06.000]  John B. Wells will join us of Coast to Coast A.M., Gerald Salente and more on this Christmas Day worldwide transmission.
[29:06.000 --> 29:10.000]  But I thought I would come in and record a bit so that we could be here live together.
[29:10.000 --> 29:14.000]  I am so honored and so blessed. That's why I hate it when you call in and say, but great job I'm doing.
[29:14.000 --> 29:21.000]  I am just so humble and so destroyed by your gaze and by your support.
[29:21.000 --> 29:29.000]  And I don't ever imagine I can live up to all of your dreams. Your dreams are wonderment and they are the answer to the evil.
[29:29.000 --> 29:35.000]  I love you all. Christ loves you all. And I hope you've had a merry, merry Christmas with you and yours.
[29:35.000 --> 29:46.000]  Great job, crew. We'll see you back tomorrow with an original transmission worldwide. More of the evil Christmas music.
[29:46.000 --> 29:57.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:57.000 --> 30:07.000]  Introducing Pro 1. All of your filtration in one system, portable on the go. No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[30:07.000 --> 30:13.000]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilic acid.
[30:13.000 --> 30:24.000]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new aqua medics, advanced media, a removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[30:24.000 --> 30:31.000]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates. We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[30:31.000 --> 30:42.000]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilic acid,
[30:42.000 --> 30:48.000]  the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[30:48.000 --> 30:57.000]  Get your Pro Pure with a new Pro 1 filter today at infowarstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[30:57.000 --> 31:07.000]  The facts are in. The studies are legion. Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[31:07.000 --> 31:11.000]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[31:11.000 --> 31:21.000]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[31:21.000 --> 31:31.000]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live fluoride shield formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world
[31:31.000 --> 31:37.000]  to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[31:37.000 --> 31:42.000]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[31:42.000 --> 31:50.000]  I use fluoride shield every day. Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at infowarslive.com today.
[31:50.000 --> 31:56.000]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWars at the same time. That's infowarslive.com.
[31:56.000 --> 32:01.000]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[32:01.000 --> 32:10.000]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[32:10.000 --> 32:18.000]  It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[32:18.000 --> 32:22.000]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[32:22.000 --> 32:31.000]  All of this has been engineered by design. We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[32:31.000 --> 32:41.000]  To learn more, visit infowarslive.com. The site is literally packed with audio and video featuring top health professionals who don't bow down to big pharma.
[32:41.000 --> 32:47.000]  The fight against the New World Order starts with you and you can't stand against the machine of your sick, tired, and obese.

[32:57.000 --> 33:19.000]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[33:19.000 --> 33:29.000]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly. I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[33:29.000 --> 33:35.000]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis. Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[33:35.000 --> 33:40.000]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.000]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[33:45.000 --> 33:49.000]  Guns will be taken. No one will be able to be armed. We will take all weapons.
[33:49.000 --> 33:52.000]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.000]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[33:57.000 --> 34:00.000]  Enough. Enough. Enough. Enough.
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.000]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.000]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[34:10.000 --> 34:17.000]  Last chance to lay news 12, Jeff Carroll discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem. Us.
[34:17.000 --> 34:25.000]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[34:25.000 --> 34:31.000]  If you got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.
[34:31.000 --> 34:37.000]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.000]  Black Hawk choppers, storing to the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.000]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[34:54.000 --> 35:00.000]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[35:00.000 --> 35:10.000]  I am in my apartment, sir. I am inside. I have two words for you. Predator gloves. You will never see it coming.
[35:13.000 --> 35:25.000]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras, parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.000]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[35:30.000 --> 35:38.000]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down if you want a commendation.
[35:39.000 --> 35:49.000]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[35:49.000 --> 35:56.000]  The revolution is there by day. Too fast, too fast.
[35:56.000 --> 36:03.000]  There's no way all that makes me happy. There's no way all that makes me happy.
[36:03.000 --> 36:09.000]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[36:13.000 --> 36:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live on this Wednesday, the 11th day of December 2013, and John B. Wells, host of Coast to Coast AM, along with the great George Norring and others, is a veteran radio host and voice actor with credits ranging from radio stations and TV shows to movies and advertisements.
[36:31.000 --> 36:44.000]  But I like him for his libertarian, constitutional, classical, conservative views, and just enjoy listening to his show. One of my favorite times is listening to Coast to Coast AM, and he's done advertisements and worked for big companies, you name it, and all seven continents.
[36:44.000 --> 36:57.000]  He's also a musician, writer, composer, martial artist, and aviator. In addition to serving as the announcer for CBS's late, late show with Craig Kilborn, Wells has lent his voice to Oliver Stone's JFK,
[36:57.000 --> 37:06.000]  Doc Radio Films, and appeared in many other films. He's also recently voiced promos for Discovery Channel's Deadliest Catch and Gold Rush.
[37:06.000 --> 37:13.000]  After frequently serving as a guest host on Coast to Coast AM, he, for the last few years now, has been hosting it. It's very, very popular.
[37:13.000 --> 37:18.000]  And so, like one of the most popular time slots there, so we're very excited to have him.
[37:18.000 --> 37:31.000]  The caravan to midnight.com, JBwells.com, are his websites, and I saw him up there at the whole JFK 50th, and then he was there with us for about four hours, left a little while before the police attacked us.
[37:31.000 --> 37:40.000]  We thought it was all over before the deputies attacked us, and so we had him on from the road there, went out to dinner, really enjoyed getting a chance to hang out with him.
[37:40.000 --> 37:51.000]  So I invited him down to Austin, Texas, so he hopped on a flight from Big D, like a 25-minute flight, and came in here, and he's with us for the second half of the transmission.
[37:51.000 --> 37:57.000]  And I told him, I said, what do you want to talk about this morning before he flew here? He said, whatever you want to cover, just like when I go on his show.
[37:57.000 --> 38:05.000]  And then I said, well, I mean, what do you want to cover? And he said, look, just throw out questions at me, and then I'll try to give you my take on him.
[38:05.000 --> 38:14.000]  Now, you know how I am, John, as soon as I start talking or if you pause for me, I'll jump in. So you're here. I want you to be able to talk some and go over, you know, all these articles.
[38:14.000 --> 38:24.000]  So I'm going to throw a lot of subjects out at you today and just randomly get your take on it. Bitcoin.
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  Set up. Nothing is, by the way, it's great to see you.
[38:28.000 --> 38:36.000]  It's a fabulous complex you have, and all your people are so nice and professionally get it done. It's a really smoking crew. I like it.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  Well, we're really about to go to the next level, so we're running around like an anthill.
[38:40.000 --> 38:51.000]  Yeah, this whole Bitcoin thing, I subscribe to the proposition that none of this stuff is by accident, and everything that we see, it's like, look the other way, and the noises come from over there.
[38:51.000 --> 38:59.000]  Look that way. That's where the action is. So I started, I really, I was behind the curve pretty bad on Bitcoin because I don't play around with the financial markets.
[38:59.000 --> 39:05.000]  I'm not interested in stock investment or any of that. I just observe what's going on. Hey, the market crashed. Well, that's bad. Market's up.
[39:05.000 --> 39:11.000]  Okay. Oh yeah, there was that quantitative easing. That's probably why the market's up. Okay. And that's about the extent of it.
[39:11.000 --> 39:27.000]  But Bitcoin started becoming a term more and more frequently used. And I just thought this stuff is getting just a little bit too much play for it to be some really revolutionary idea in mercantilism.
[39:27.000 --> 39:40.000]  And of course, when it hit the papers yesterday, so to speak, that J.P. Morgan is going to upgrade their patent on their version of Bitcoin from 1999.
[39:40.000 --> 39:50.000]  Oh, and then the little sub headline was, persons could make transactions anonymously. There's no such thing as an anonymous transaction over the internet.
[39:50.000 --> 40:05.000]  That's just rubbish. So to me, it's like, okay, there's your one world currency in the making, particularly of J.P. Morgan's behind it because they're behind everything that has anything to do with money and have been since there was a J.P. Morgan.
[40:05.000 --> 40:19.000]  Well, I'm on record saying that this is the type of thing that I think J.P. Morgan or Goldman Sachs is behind. And I'm not saying that unequivocally, but I've always not followed my gut, even though it's always been right now, I follow my gut.
[40:19.000 --> 40:29.000]  Yes. And my life just gets better and better and better by the millisecond because the guts running things now. The brain already knows what's going on. And intellectually, I see a lot of stuff that's wrong with it.
[40:29.000 --> 40:40.000]  And here's my issue. They keep saying in the last five years, we need a new bubble. They said we're going to come out with a new digital global currency, but we need to call it something other than SDRs, strategic drawing rights.
[40:40.000 --> 40:50.000]  They said they want 100 trillion in new liquidity from taxpayers. So they run it out there like it's this new crypto thing against them. A bunch of people jump on it like the tulip bubble.
[40:50.000 --> 41:01.000]  You know, we're tulips for going for the equivalent of a million dollars and then a month later we're worth nothing in Europe. People can look up that as a case. It has all the signs and handiwork of the same tailor.
[41:01.000 --> 41:10.000]  This suit was cut from the same cloth. Now, I'm not saying people can't make money in the run up of it. I don't want the bad mojo, the bad karma repot you show.
[41:10.000 --> 41:20.000]  If my gut tells me there's something wrong with it, forgive me. I'm just saying danger will Robinson. You know, we have something approaching from the east, very large, very dangerous.
[41:20.000 --> 41:33.000]  And I totally concur with what your gut is telling you. And now it's oh, they had a patent 14 years ago of something. And this comes out of Austria and no one will say where it is.
[41:33.000 --> 41:41.000]  And it's been pumped in the Liberty Movement. They may even destroy this and roll something else out and then blame us. I'm not getting blamed when it all goes belly up.
[41:41.000 --> 41:50.000]  The thing is, is that the most fundamental concept of capitalism is one that I believe most people don't understand. And that is these contractions have to occur.
[41:50.000 --> 41:59.000]  If you just read the back of any credit card statement or any institutions, the specifics and the details of what your loan is going to cost you.
[41:59.000 --> 42:09.000]  You see that. I mean, back in the 80s, even I thought, you know, we've got M1 and M2. M1 is the cash and the checking accounts and savings accounts. M2 is basically paper money.
[42:09.000 --> 42:19.000]  Well, if a day came when all of that debt came due, there's not enough money in the entire system to pay it all. So what happens is we see these bubbles, you see expand, expand, expand.
[42:19.000 --> 42:28.000]  And then there's a contraction. There's only one or two ways to manage your monetary system. And that is to collapse it every once in a while and throw a few players out.
[42:28.000 --> 42:39.000]  They bankrupt them, they foreclose on them, they resell and then expansion starts again. So now that this globalistic economy has come into play,
[42:39.000 --> 42:49.000]  well, the danger factor goes even higher because now instead of just various markets and maybe even one country having a capitalistic contraction,
[42:49.000 --> 43:00.000]  now there's a possibility the entire world could have a capitalistic contraction. And to salvage it, lots and lots of players will have to be thrown out, lots of foreclosures, lots of properties seized.
[43:00.000 --> 43:11.000]  And the globalists have used national reserve banking and the boom bus cycle to gain dominant control. Now they openly say they're going to have one giant meltdown,
[43:11.000 --> 43:24.000]  poses the saviors during it, make us accept a new digital global currency that we pay carbon taxes to the back, that then surveils all human activity through the Panoptagon NSA grid that's actually global.
[43:24.000 --> 43:32.000]  And then they can selectively shut down all their competition with selective enforcement. That is a high-tech total tyranny.
[43:32.000 --> 43:38.000]  And that, John B. Wells, as you've accurately broken it down, is the New World Order capstone, the master plan.
[43:38.000 --> 43:48.000]  How do we get the general public that they're smart enough to watch Sports Center and to know everything about the NFL? They've got to learn about the world.
[43:48.000 --> 43:57.000]  People aren't successful because you don't know how the world really works. You know about your sitcom people and your football people, you know, the male soap operas,
[43:57.000 --> 44:04.000]  and I get football folks, I like it too. The point is, is that I'm not that smart and I figured this out. John's a smart guy, he figured it out.
[44:04.000 --> 44:11.000]  And it's all coming towards a very bad design contraction. So what do we do about it?
[44:11.000 --> 44:21.000]  Well, I don't really know what we do about it because the other component is one that we've discussed before and that is taking some of the players out may equate to literally taking some of the players out.
[44:21.000 --> 44:34.000]  In other words, big conflagration. I was reading about the, you know, if there is a huge solar, what do you call it, a coronal mass ejection and so forth that took down the grid.
[44:34.000 --> 44:45.000]  I mean, I believe it was on InfoWars that the potential to eliminate 9 out of 10 people because of civil unrest and this and that and the other because your grid goes down.
[44:45.000 --> 44:57.000]  Yeah, the Pentagon says that and now they know on average every 100 years or so we get hit by one big enough that when it hit last time it blew out most of the electricity in large areas of the world.
[44:57.000 --> 45:00.000]  Imagine if that hits now.
[45:00.000 --> 45:15.000]  Well, the population is high strong enough as it is. I mean, there's tight as a bow string as it is. Somebody is waiting for something bad to happen. Oh, it's not just somebody. It's this entire group. Well, which group?
[45:15.000 --> 45:24.000]  I mean, is it the poor group? Is it the patriot group? Is it the conservative group? Is it the liberal group? Who's waiting for something to happen? Everybody's waiting for something to happen.
[45:24.000 --> 45:38.000]  You ask what can people do about it. The thing is, is train yourself to look in the opposite direction from where the noise is coming. And I think we're going to be, I think we're a few months off from, from determining how we're going to survive, let alone succeed.
[45:38.000 --> 45:53.000]  Maybe the success will come later, but I think we're looking at a scenario within the next six, eight months. It could be quite dramatic. I mean, every all these addicts from the executive office, this routine circumvention of the Constitution, this unbelievable
[45:53.000 --> 46:03.000]  militarization of the police departments, and these people who just run around shooting like ever before. Now, people can say, well, you got the internet now, so they can make the case for saying, no, that's just stuff that happened all the time.
[46:03.000 --> 46:19.000]  Always has happened. And you're just hearing about it now because communications methods have improved. It's like, not really. There is a, there are more frequency. There's a greater frequency of, of cop shooting people that should not have been shot.
[46:19.000 --> 46:31.000]  I mean, this guy that shot this kid with the BB gun is back on duty. Now, the one that shot at the car in New Mexico, he gets fired. But the one who killed the kid is back on duty.
[46:31.000 --> 46:41.000]  Well, we all see the videos where a lab jumps out of the car because the cop opens it, the tail's wagging. Anybody knows a dog that's friendly. And then the cop just shoots it.
[46:41.000 --> 46:58.000]  I mean, what is this? Why is this happening? Why are the policemen that we trusted when they showed up as like, oh, good relief. Help is here. They'll help us. I mean, to me, it's almost as though every confrontation with the police officer is potentially life threatening now.
[46:58.000 --> 47:13.000]  Well, that's because they've been trained to be warriors. And if a Marine doesn't act first, he'll be dead Marine. That's what this guy that shot the 13 year old with the airsoft gun said in SWAT Magazine. He said, you've got to act even if you don't know what you're doing.
[47:13.000 --> 47:15.000]  Just some action is good. Well, that's not true.
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  Well, it's not public service either.
[47:17.000 --> 47:20.000]  But I mean, he's not, he's not fighting the Taliban.
[47:20.000 --> 47:21.000]  No.
[47:21.000 --> 47:35.000]  It's not like he was in Afghanistan and the guy had something to look like a rifle and turned around. He shot him. He'd be like, yeah, it's a war zone. It's a rural area of Northern California with a kid with a plastic pellet gun.
[47:35.000 --> 47:43.000]  It's just beyond anything I've ever seen. I don't understand why you can't pull your pistol out and march up going put your hands in plain sight or I'm going to start shooting. I'm warning you don't do anything else.
[47:43.000 --> 47:51.000]  And then if somebody makes a threatening move, it's like, well, there's always a kneecap or a leg or an arm or shoulder or something. You don't have to dump your whole magazine in the person.
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.000]  I think they do that.
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.000]  Well, they train him in instinctive shooting to kill him immediately. That's why we had a case in Austin where a guy with no criminal record got pulled over.
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  Officer said, you know, get out of the car from his little loudspeaker or whatever.
[48:02.000 --> 48:09.000]  And the guy gets out with his wallet in his hand and the cop just instantly like he was a gunslinger starts firing at him.
[48:09.000 --> 48:16.000]  Listen, listen, I had an Austin cop pull me over for speeding about 10 miles an hour in Northwest Hills when I was a senior in high school.
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.000]  My mom said, go get me frozen yogurt. And I said, okay.
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.000]  Because you know that, you know, them helping me get a car meant that I would do errands for him constantly, which I like doing.
[48:25.000 --> 48:31.000]  So I go up and get a thing in my weight belt, sit in the front of the seat, green Mustang cop pulls me over right by my house, like 300 yards away.
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  He walks up. Hey, how are you doing? Life's a registration. You know your speed.
[48:34.000 --> 48:40.000]  All of a sudden, hands on the wheel. He had the gun to my head. He was like, get out, get out.
[48:40.000 --> 48:46.000]  He was like, oh, never mind. And luckily he didn't down these things beat me up or something as they were wrong and prove they were.
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.000]  He goes, oh, it's a weight belt. Oh, okay. Well, I thought it was a knife scabbard, a gun.
[48:51.000 --> 48:59.000]  And I was just like, okay. And he let me go. But I mean, I was more calm with him with a gun to my head screaming.
[48:59.000 --> 49:05.000]  And he was and he's holding the gun. Yeah. I mean, obviously the guy pulls up.
[49:05.000 --> 49:13.000]  I'm like, hey, yeah. So, you know, boom, gun to, you know, like, I mean, what is that psychosis? That's what it is.
[49:13.000 --> 49:19.000]  I mean, well, if they're so afraid, they shouldn't be a cop. That's correct. Absolutely correct.
[49:19.000 --> 49:25.000]  I mean, DPS officers, Texas state police, they typically don't act that way.
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  Now I'm not saying they're angels. They're not, you don't mess with the DPS. These are serious cats. They really are.
[49:29.000 --> 49:37.000]  But they've got a calm demeanor about them. And now if as what happened in forward Texas some years ago, the DPS says,
[49:37.000 --> 49:43.000]  stop what you're doing and you speed off and he's on your truck and he goes, stop the vehicle.
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  And the guy doesn't do it. So he goes, boom. Well, that's different.
[49:47.000 --> 49:53.000]  That's asking for it. You know, the Texas state policeman that you're that's clinging to your vehicle is telling you stop the vehicle.
[49:53.000 --> 49:59.000]  That's life threatening. That's different. But just to flip out because of a weight belt in the seat, it's like, what's wrong with you?
[49:59.000 --> 50:06.000]  And I think a lot of these guys are probably ex-military when they come back from being in the stuff over there.
[50:06.000 --> 50:12.000]  What are they going to do? How can they apply those skills? And they're already jacked off.
[50:12.000 --> 50:18.000]  Well, I would be completely exhausted every day. I just ran around with my eyes bugged out thinking everybody was out to get me.
[50:18.000 --> 50:23.000]  I did some competitive shooting and it was more than half of more cops involved in it. I got out of it because they were so whacked out
[50:23.000 --> 50:26.000]  and literally just acting like Rambo.
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  Yeah.
[50:27.000 --> 50:30.000]  And just thinking people are hiding under the, you know,
[50:30.000 --> 50:35.000]  Well, you know, a lot of people drink and a lot of people take prozac based antidepressants.
[50:35.000 --> 50:41.000]  A lot of these police are under. I think part of the problem is that the society is so big now.
[50:41.000 --> 50:50.000]  I mean, literally in numbers, physical numbers, that they are exposed to so much ugliness that it affects you. You can't see somebody.
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  Oh, I agree. Just reading the news every day, I've become pretty crazy.
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  Yeah, it's enough to make you walk on the side of your head.
[50:56.000 --> 51:11.000]  The facts are in. The studies are legion, sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[51:11.000 --> 51:16.000]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water? Simple. Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[51:16.000 --> 51:27.000]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies. I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive Info Wars Life fluoride shield formulation.

[54:35.000 --> 54:40.000]  We're going to get into the state of the media. He was asking during the break how long they let us continue to do this.
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  That's the big question. We're going to talk about that.
[54:42.000 --> 54:48.000]  So Obama and his executive power grabs, the Middle East, the government funding Al Qaeda, all of this.
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.000]  And a bunch of news I haven't covered yet. Briefly, it is Christmas.

[55:52.000 --> 55:58.000]  Let's face it, it's a supplement to or hey, Alex, you're not playing games about this nation and iodine.
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.000]  This is so different. Look, I discover incredible things. I bring them to you.
[56:02.000 --> 56:14.000]  And we just launched the maiden1776.com brass belt buckles with George Washington and, you know, down with tyranny and the new Made America apparel line.

[56:30.000 --> 56:40.000]  John, this is a quick segment, obviously. I want to get into the subjects you raised, but you were talking about wanting to get into Mandela a little bit.
[56:40.000 --> 56:50.000]  What's your take on Nelson Mandela and that collection of communist and socialist leaders and dictators meeting and nobody in our media pointing it out really?
[56:50.000 --> 56:55.000]  Well, this mainstream media of ours, we know it's bought and paid for. We know that it is.
[56:55.000 --> 57:02.000]  It was like Amber Lyon who said, we were paid to run some stories. We were paid not to run some stories. That pretty much says it all.
[57:02.000 --> 57:03.000]  And they're all doing it.
[57:03.000 --> 57:08.000]  $400,000 to not run a story by the government of Qatar.
[57:08.000 --> 57:09.000]  That's right.
[57:09.000 --> 57:15.000]  And what happened to the story about Iceland in 08? This goes back to May of 2012.
[57:15.000 --> 57:22.000]  Not 08. May of 2012, they threw out their whole government. They rewrote the Constitution to preclude any corporate fraud.
[57:22.000 --> 57:28.000]  They're refunding to every household. There's only 320,000 people. Okay, I understand that, but that's a small GDP, too.
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.000]  They'd signed them on to hundreds of billions that wasn't their debt.
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  That's right. And they just said, no. And they stopped it.
[57:35.000 --> 57:41.000]  And CNN's like, oh, well, we're following the story. It's like, well, why don't you fall a little bit closer because it's over a year old.
[57:41.000 --> 57:48.000]  Now, what would happen if in this country that went out over mainstream media that's like, these people threw out their government, threw them out.
[57:48.000 --> 57:53.000]  They arrested the banksters. They seized their assets. They jailed them. And that's how it is.
[57:53.000 --> 57:56.000]  They rewrote the Constitution so that this cannot happen again.
[57:56.000 --> 57:59.000]  We wouldn't want any Americans getting those sorts of ideas, no, would we?
[57:59.000 --> 58:07.000]  You're right. Iceland is the model. And just like in Greece and everywhere else, it turned out over 90% of the debt they'd been signed on to was actually British bank debt.
[58:07.000 --> 58:14.000]  No connection to them. Remember, the British government was trying to arrest people for terrorism or not letting them leave Iceland or use British airways?
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  Then it turned around. It was all a fraud.
[58:16.000 --> 58:20.000]  Yeah. And you said it was a short segment, so we'll get to Mandela later.
[58:20.000 --> 58:25.000]  But everything we're being presented with is a borderline fraud.
[58:25.000 --> 58:31.000]  I mean, they just want us to tow the line, go forward, be good little boys and girls, and don't ask questions.
[58:31.000 --> 58:36.000]  In other words, they don't care what you know. All they care about is how much you care.
[58:36.000 --> 58:37.000]  That's right.
[59:06.000 --> 59:13.000]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[59:13.000 --> 59:20.000]  Reports documented a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[59:20.000 --> 59:25.000]  Bottom line, iodine is important, unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[59:25.000 --> 59:39.000]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family. You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com. InfoWarsLife Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[59:39.000 --> 59:56.000]  I take it every day. That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  I'm going to give the number out in the next segment and start taking calls about 24 after.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  I got a ton of news that I want to get to and get John B. Wells' quick take on.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  We're going to talk about Mandela in the next segment, the attack on the free press.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  What else do you want to get into? There's a lot to talk about.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  And one of the things would be Snowden. He was the runner-up for Person of the Year by Time Magazine.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  They went with the Pope instead. And I want to believe that Edward Snowden is as he appears to be.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  But my first question is, one more time, why is he alive? Why has he not dropped off the scope?
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  Why did he not? And Asan, it looks like he's not going to be prosecuted either.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  So I want Snowden to be on the level. I do. But I just...
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  Dr. Pachenek says it's all staged and can have a public debate about the NSA and only dole out a little bit
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  because they know they can't hide it anymore. And so now they're going to decide to just put it out themselves
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  and kind of inoculate it psychologically.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  Well, I would agree with Pachenek on this one for sure.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  And there are some things with Steve that I disagree with, but I got to roll with him on this
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  because it's just a little bit too visible to be real.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  By the way, I already knew all this because they'd already had AT&T whistleblowers six years ago.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  Other ones, they had one decade ago. James Bamford, I was having...
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  They had NSA whistleblowers that were the EU parliament 15 years ago. People like Wayne Madsen.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  But he thinks Snowden's good.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  Well, I want him to be. I'm just still looking. But now all this stuff has come forward.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  I mean, this has been going on for ten years, but the FBI can turn on your webcam
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  without turning on the little green light that indicates to you that it's on.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  They've been able to do that since, I don't know, 0405s?
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  Well, they designed all of it that way. It's all been designed with the technology company.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  People come out all the time and go, I've been told to build a back door in the webcam.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  That was in the mid-1990s.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  Wouldn't it be strange if the reason that all of this is being done is under the auspices of fighting terrorism,
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  to find an excuse to separate you from your money and your property?
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  And nothing more.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  No, that's it. It's the defense contractors taking over this market.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  They're literally re-engineering to the society.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  Yeah. It has nothing to do with fighting crime. It has nothing to do with defeating terrorism.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  It's all about the Benjamins again.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  I mean, that's sick. It really is. I mean, it goes right back to the scriptures.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  You know, the root of all evil is the love of money. And that's it.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  That's right. It's not having money.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  It's good when good people have money to be able to defend themselves and build a good society.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  It's the love of it when you put it up top as the golden calf.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  That's right. That's right.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  I've heard people say this about, I've heard this guy say this about his little sister.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  Oh, she loves money. She'll do anything.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  Well, as the years have gone by, it's like, this is a real serious gal.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  You need to steer clear of her and keep your hand on your wallet.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  I've seen women before when there's a big stack of money.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  They actually, a lot of them get excited.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  And it's just literally dirty, nothing.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  Well, that's not exclusive to them. I get excited.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  No, no, no.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  I get excited about money, too.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  Yeah, but I mean, it's just like, I mean, but all it is is a fiat fraud, a symbol of energy.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  Sure.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  And he's globalist. People will kill.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  Or just a little bit of money.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  Well, and the thing is, is that Matt, it's a, I said, who's the guy who played Boris the Blade in Snatch?
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  He always plays the evil Russian in every movie.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  It's the same guy. I don't even know his name, but he'll spot him anywhere.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  He was in a show called MI5. They call it Spooks Overseas.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  It's off the air now, but this guy said, you're insane.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  He says, no, no, it's the vast sums of money. I do what I want.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  The vast sums of money make everything possible.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  And that's true. The vast sums of money make everything possible.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  But I take the vast sums of money to build the operation.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Well, exactly.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  Like the average talk shows, this level's flying around on a private jet, you know, and literally at the country club.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  That's all boring.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  Yeah.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  Changing history is what's important.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  Oh, it's true.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  And the homies.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  Yes. And there is a huge communist element. Everybody got pretty burned out on that.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  We got to defeat communism because that went on for the 50s, and the 60s, and the 70s.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  And then it kind of went away in the 80s and 90s.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  Now they're called progressives.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  That's how I see it.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  Oh, that's who they are.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  I want to come back with that with Mandela.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  And I've got images of him, mainline photos of him looking with the head of the Communist Party, with his wife there,
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  there, the head of the Communist Party with him in 1993 there with the big red star behind
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.220]  him. We also have video of him singing kill the white people and we checked it. He is
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:53.000]  singing it in the South African, African dialect, kill the white people. So it's very loving.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  I thought it was a Ku Klux Klan.

[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:07.560]  I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:11.560]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:16.720]  farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans. We have now managed to secure the sought
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:22.600]  after beans in a highly customized blend. Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend

[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:03.960]  a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:09.760]  from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.280]  out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled the most vital
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:20.600]  and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com. These are items that I did research on that
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:25.840]  I personally use. You've got the life straw so you can turn fetid water into safe water

[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:21.520]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.320]  John B. Wells is with us for the rest of the hour. We're going to open the phones up. The
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:33.320]  toll-free number to join us for first-time callers is 800-259-9231. 800-2599-231. For
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:39.000]  any question or comments you have for John B. Wells, I of course am your host Alex Jones.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.400]  His website is caravantomidnight.com. You can hear him Saturday nights on Coast to Coast
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:48.600]  AM reaching tens of millions of people. And he's just a great libertarian patriot who's
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:51.920]  aware of what's going on. I like listening to his show and I'm glad we're friends. He's
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:58.320]  a fellow Texan right here with us. This just went up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:03.760]  It's trained to kill people at traffic stops. In the new drills, federally sponsored, they
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:10.600]  walk up to people at traffic stops and aim guns at everyone's heads. This is the standardized
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:15.020]  federal training like Boston and like we saw a few weeks ago in LA where they were walking
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:20.200]  up at checkpoints putting guns to people's heads. This is totally criminal and you can
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:25.520]  see all that up on infowars.com. In fact, Paul's going to add the photos and videos
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:31.200]  from that earlier article to this. We're going to cover that coming up. But John B. Wells,
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.680]  for those that just joined us, we were talking about communism. And again, what I've seen
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:39.280]  is the Rockefellers and others funded linen. That's been in congressional hearings in
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:44.400]  the 70s. The CIA helped put Mao in power in 49. That's now been declassified about a decade
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:50.160]  ago again. People can look all this up. Our government, people running it, they want dictatorships
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:54.360]  all over the world. They put Saddam in. They created Al Qaeda. They want oppression because
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:59.240]  it's easier for the big corporations to run things that well that way and rob things.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:06.080]  So when we talk about communism, as Carol Quigley wrote in Tragedy and Hope and he was an insider,
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:11.560]  they want fascism. They want authoritarianism. They want communism as long as it's autocratic.
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:15.800]  And that's why they're using communism to make people dependent to enslave you through
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:21.680]  monetary control. They're doing it. And all the people that were communist, people really
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:27.800]  were sick of it by the 80s and saw that people couldn't even get some sausage or nylons or
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.720]  whatever, standing around the block, that it was horrible, that it was corrupt, that
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:34.880]  the communists were all rich on the top. People were sick of it. It failed. Then they came
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.880]  out and said, we're liberal. And they play the race card and all this stuff. And then
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:44.080]  South Africa gets taken over by a communist. They go from one evil apartheid. And I looked
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:48.640]  this up. In Africa, the blacks on average in polls say, we want apartheid back. I don't
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:52.760]  want apartheid back. If they would have gotten free market instead of communism, they'd all
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:58.000]  be richer there by now. Instead, most estimates are five times worse than it was. Rape murder
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.920]  capital of the world outside of Chicago. You've got the floor, my friend. I'm ranting to talk
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:08.720]  about Mandela, the progressives, Obama, everything tying this together and where you see the
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:09.720]  world going.
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:14.160]  Well, I've got a good story for you on South Africa. Kathy Lee Crosby, remember her?
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.160]  Yes.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:20.520]  Kathy Lee Crosby was the voice of Lexington Cigarettes for 20 years. And I guess the
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.880]  lobster and the king clip and the cigarettes and everything else got to him. But the music
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.840]  producer for that brand, they actually run movie trailers over there. So they came at
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:33.160]  the end of the movies and he would do these beautiful nature things. They're unbelievable
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:38.160]  about Itasha and this and that. His son was at the, he's deceased now, but his son was
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:46.560]  at Denton School of Music. And he was on his way to recast for the voice of Lexington Cigarettes
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:51.200]  and see his son at the same time. Well, guess who he cast? So I went over to South Africa
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:12:01.920]  every year from 1984 until about 93. They decided it would not be good for me to go
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:09.720]  over there after the clerk and his crew got thrown out, effectively thrown out.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:15.320]  During the time that I spent over there, first of all, there was razor wire and electric
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:22.200]  wire to keep people out because they wanted in because everything outside of South Africa
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:27.720]  was absolute chaos. I've been up through NUMB maybe before, up toward Uganda. It was just
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:34.860]  wholesale murder in Uganda. I was there the very month on the very week that some 16 year
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:41.040]  war had ended in Mozambique. So we were able to get in there and look around. So I got
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:47.080]  to speak with real no kidding. These aren't African Americans. These are African Africans.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:53.200]  And what they had to say was far different from anything this news media has ever said.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:13:00.600]  First of all, Nelson Mandela was part of the leader of the armed wing of the African National
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:04.640]  Congress, which everybody says is nothing but, you know, the Communist Party in African
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:09.440]  garb. And it was true. Winnie Mandela. Remember when she came up on charges that were really
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:14.400]  lame charges for torturing and then killing some teenagers that she suspected being unfaithful
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:21.280]  to the cause. So if people say, well, you're a racist because you don't like Obama or you're
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:27.400]  a racist because you don't like Mandela, it's like, no, but you are a racialist because
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.240]  you're using racial issues to push forward your agenda.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.360]  Well, I'm going to pull it up. There was an article about Lou Rockwell that we added some
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:41.360]  photos to not by Lou Rockwell, but from Lou Rockwell.com where we showed all these photos
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:46.400]  of him in at the Communist Party meetings when he was president. And with the leader
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:52.400]  of the Communist Party that he went to college with. And these are people that targeted children.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.920]  And I looked it up. They did target police's children putting tires up of their heads and
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.040]  black kids that wouldn't go do terror attacks, they would hang a tire up of their head and
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:08.680]  kill them. And then him on television saying, kill all the whites in the white areas. And
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:13.760]  so the whole issue is, is that the globalist Prince Charles and people came and put him
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:18.240]  in so they could just murder and slaughter everybody. And now that's happening. We're
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:22.960]  not defending what was there before. The difference is it was an Oasis compared to the rest of
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:23.960]  Africa is what you're saying.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:30.160]  Absolutely. And I can tell you that Africans have killed more Africans than any of the
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:36.680]  horrible white racist South African police or defense forces, either one. I mean, it's
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:40.240]  just the plain truth of it. If you do your research, which I know you do, I mean, the
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.920]  people at large, if you look into this, you'll find that's, that's just how it is.
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:47.920]  I'm going to punch up on screen this article useful. It gets 2013 and go through it. But
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:51.560]  I mean, keep talking about your experiences in South Africa and what you saw because,
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:55.560]  you know, you see almost all those world leaders that went to his event, then they bust in
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.000]  all these communists and government workers. They couldn't even fill the whole stadium
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.400]  to jump up and down and say how great he was. And then I know the politics of it. I've studied
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:10.200]  it and what they've done and how these communists live like kings and just how anti-liberty
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:14.440]  they are and how they disarmed the black tribes that weren't part of their group, the white
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:18.240]  groups and then just slaughtered them. And then there's photos of Nelson Mandela with
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:22.080]  his militia commanders. In fact, I'll scroll down who are the only ones that are allowed
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:26.480]  to be armed and then go out and carry out all these different operations. I mean, it's
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.040]  just the standard deal. And you can see they want to use this racial division program of
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:36.640]  you didn't build your business. Somebody else did that here. This is their plan. I mean,
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:41.760]  it's absolutely correct. I mean, it's you have to have a boogeyman and the boogeyman
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:47.760]  is communism. But when you realize that you are the boogeyman and the policies that you're
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.840]  fomenting and trying to voice on the people are in fact communist policies, I mean, it
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:57.840]  goes back to Lenin and John D. Rockefeller that you have to have the first step to get
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:03.320]  the people under your control is a what? National healthcare system. I mean, can you believe
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.320]  that?
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.000]  They funded the boogeyman of communism so they could turn us into a police state to counter
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.800]  it. And meanwhile turned us into that. Exactly. I mean, it's like you become what you be held
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:17.800]  in contempt and and and with loathing. You are now that. And then I suppose the cycle
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:22.600]  reverses of the polls flip. And when they become what you appeared to be before, well,
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:28.320]  then you're the enemy of that. So it's just it's the human beings insatiable desire for
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:34.720]  conflict and the money that goes with it. As Moriarty said, expanding on that, you were
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:39.400]  talking about the press and you were putting up the hypothetical. How long can this go on?
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:43.720]  They're bringing in cyber security to curtail the web to tax it to track it. They want a
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:47.480]  fairness doctrine for talk radio. They're trying to buy it up. They're trying to persecute
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:51.920]  the press or using the IRS on the Tea Party. That tells you the good guys are right there.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:56.240]  It is the real Tea Party is trying to reverse this. And they have the Republican and Democratic
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:03.600]  leadership led by Bonner, John Bonner, the Speaker of the House, trying right now to
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:10.480]  literally beat the libertarians into submission. Alex, this is what's so unbelievable to me
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.280]  is that the 12 year old girl within the last week I saw an article about the 12 year old
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:18.280]  story on a 12 year old girl who had traced the lineage of all the presidents and it was
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:24.040]  either Van Buren or Buchanan. One of those started with a B. He was the only one whose
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:30.760]  bloodline was not traced all the way back to King John Lachlan Plantagenet. Now, what
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:36.400]  does this tell us about preselection? What does it tell us about? We think we live in
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:40.280]  a two party system, but the moment that the third party candidate comes anywhere near
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:45.160]  a national election, the first thing that happens is a wave of ridicule and they run
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:52.480]  him off just like they did Ron Paul. His own conservative group ejected him from the proceedings
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:57.920]  and for a while there he had a real chance. And by the way, Obama is multiple cousins
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:06.560]  with Cheney. Cheney is related to Bush. Bush is related to John Kerry and then they're
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:11.220]  both from the same fraternity. He only has like 15 graduates a year and then you start
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:16.680]  learning it's all interconnected. It is unbelievable. And then you learn that's not even really
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:21.840]  a British bloodline. It's not even a German bloodline. It's a Transylvanian bloodline.
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:27.120]  And then you realize most world leaders are related to Vladi and Paylor or Count Dracula
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.000]  and then you're really in cuckoo land. Well, it seems to me that that gene pool could
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:40.120]  use what? A little chlorine because if Barack Obama is related distantly to King John Lachlan
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:48.160]  Plantagenet, these leaders are preselected. And as a matter of fact, it appears that they
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:54.440]  are even groomed from birth, which makes sense because their fathers would be doing the grooming.
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:58.640]  Just like with Joe Kennedy, John F. Kennedy was never meant to be president. It was supposed
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:04.640]  to be Joe Jr. But he was killed in World War II. And they went back to Irish royalty.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:12.280]  That's it. That's absolutely correct. I mean, the rulers, their lines have never faded away.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:15.800]  So this whole thing about anybody can grow up and be president of the United States. Well,
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:23.840]  that's just not true. Only if it is decreed by blood. You're absolutely right. And, of
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:27.760]  course, they've been inbreeding so long that even in mainline news, it looks like they
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:33.520]  have a different strand of DNA because of the inbreeding. I mean, these people are unbelievable.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:37.400]  Now, you're getting an unsealed alien files territory, which by the way, it's a pleasure
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:40.920]  to narrate that program. You know, check it out sometime. It's a good one. They're talking
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:45.760]  about alien DNA going all the way back to Akhenaten. And well, I tell you, I've been
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:49.360]  to some of those Egypt things to see those mummies and those people without their heads
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:54.000]  being bound. They look like spacing. Oh, absolutely. Because their heads really were that shape.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:00.320]  And they wasn't deformed that way. They were for the facts are in the studies are legion.
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:05.320]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:10.600]  and cognitive ability of the American people. So why are the social engineers adding it
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:16.280]  to the water? Simple. Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:21.200]  on. We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help

[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:59.560]  But John, we've talked about so much here today. There's a new video up on infowars.com that
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:05.320]  shows police training, quote, to shoot and kill drivers and we were looking at it during
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:11.000]  the break and the photo of them just walking up to people in drills and now it's not even
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.480]  checkpoints and sticking guns to their head. And, I mean, I've got to be honest with you.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:19.280]  This is literal prisoner training. It's what they have the kids come out during the drills
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:23.280]  with their hands up. They're training us for a takeover. John, be well. Seeing these
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:27.000]  photos and these videos, what do you make of this?
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.920]  Well, first of all, what I make of it is I have to control my anger at this because
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:35.960]  this is inexcusable. I mean, we all saw that Clint Eastwood Movie Gun Academy Award for
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:40.280]  it, Unforgiven, where Little Bill comes up on English Bob and all his deputies who are
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:46.280]  a bunch of cowards and he's a sadist. That's Hackman, played the sadist, Little Bill.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:51.000]  They're all pointing their rifles, all of them pointing rifles and pistols and shotguns
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:58.720]  at one guy and his little meek biographer. And that's what's happening here. I think
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:05.800]  Eastwood was actually trying to tell us that this is what you get when you disarm the population.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.120]  And you know, I don't want to go too far.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.920]  Oh, that was the duck of death.
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:09.920]  The duck of death.
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.000]  He called him the Duke of Death and he joked when he stomped his head in and called him
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.200]  the duck of death because he was showing this is the real psychopath running the town while
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.720]  you have the fake wannabe psycho.
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:27.240]  That's right. And I believe you're absolutely correct. We are being conditioned to accept
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:35.120]  this and I don't think that we should. Look, it seems to me that any time the citizenry
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.680]  pushes back against the government and has that look on their face like we're really not
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.800]  going to have this. The government goes, no, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:48.640]  And they back off. But the longer that we let them to let them do this, they're just
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.640]  going to escalate.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.640]  And by the way, that's scientific. Three years ago when Drudge Report and others helped
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.320]  us promote the opt out for Thanksgiving week, they just said scanners are turned off, which
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:02.240]  in documents came out, there's no threat. It's conditioning. They didn't want us to have
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:06.280]  a victory like blacks going in and sitting at the lunch counter and eating and defeating
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.280]  it.
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:10.600]  And that has just been smart back then and said, here, come on in and eat today, but
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:16.120]  not in the tomorrow. You see, see, because that was, that's what they do now with our
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:21.080]  civil rights, though, is they're smart about their evil is that they, okay, you can do
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.800]  it this week, but we're going to come back next time.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:27.520]  I think it's going to be just exactly like V for vendetta. There's already an article
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:34.520]  up on a, on a website somewhere is America headed for its own version of the Arab spring
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:37.160]  like maybe this coming spring.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:42.040]  Oh, let me tell you, with the cops, when I, I let him hit me, attack me, push me back.
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:45.640]  It's all in video. I was laughing at it, still, you know, talking to him. But when I saw that
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:49.600]  day, a little girl was crying, they pushed her off her dad's shoulders. I literally started
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:53.320]  taking my stuff off and I said, now let's go. And then they gave him the order and they
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:57.720]  backed off when I was, and I was, I'm going to be honest, I was going to attack 50 riot
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:58.720]  police personally.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:03.520]  I mean, I, I as a man that them attack on that girl and it's just like in V for vendetta,
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:06.600]  they're going to pull something like that and that's when it's going to start hit a kid
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.560]  or they're going to kill a woman or something like that. And it's going to, they're going
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:14.960]  to do it on the wrong day and they're going to taste some real pain as well. They should.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.360]  We do a pretty good job of policing ourselves. The races, all the stuff of racism, this and
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:24.640]  that. It's like blacks and whites, I'm getting along for decades now. We're fine with each
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:28.840]  other. It's these morons that are keeping everything stirred up because they need to
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:33.480]  keep it stirred up. They need to pit the rich against the poor. And who is the, who makes
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:40.280]  up the vast majority of the poor black people? That's what now it is Ben Carson. Oh, well,
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:45.560]  he's just a little bit too white to be accepted by the mainstream black community. No, he's
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:51.120]  a leader and Ben tries to go back and, and help his community. He does a lot of things
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:54.840]  for people. Colin Powell, not so much. He didn't go back. Uh, who's that little gal who was
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:59.080]  the national security advisor? Kerise. She didn't go back. Bill Cosby. Look how he was
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:04.400]  vilified for being too white. This is media doing this. Look, it's just exactly what Abby
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:09.280]  Hoffman said. I don't normally quote radicals. Well, actually I do. You don't want to quote
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:15.760]  commies. Correct. Um, the truth isn't what you say it. How many people you can say it
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:22.000]  to? That's where you get your real effect. And Hoffman was correct because we are being
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:28.320]  fed the rules of their game. And all they have to do is continue to repeat it. And many
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.680]  people just nod and say, okay. Oh, it's so cynical when you turn on MSNBC. That is pure
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:37.960]  race hustling, race baiting. A five year old should be able to tell it, but they raise
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:42.360]  everybody in it. That, uh, and of course they want to keep everybody down. They don't want
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:45.800]  people to be an individual. They learn to be black or white. We'll be right back with
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:52.960]  John B. Wells. We're on the March. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the G C N radio
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:30:02.800]  network in the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:09.000]  with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world. Guess what else
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:14.800]  is in a halogen family? Fluoride. Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here in 1924, the federal
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:20.600]  government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine. It's the good
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:26.800]  halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:32.440]  IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine. Bottom line, iodine
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:38.840]  is important. Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself
[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:44.280]  and my family. You will find survival shield nascent iodine exclusively at info wars life

[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.520]  United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare? Why do
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:08.520]  we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism and
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:15.040]  every other major disease? It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat. Our food
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:20.240]  is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:26.040]  with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:30.920]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:37.200]  desperately needs. To learn more visit infowarshealth.com. The site is literally packed with audio

[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:03.720]  in. The studies are legion. Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:08.920]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people. So why are the social
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:14.600]  engineers adding it to the water? Simple. Dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:19.000]  technocracy is feeding on. We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.280]  supply yet but we can help to get it out of our bodies. I am extremely excited to announce

[01:16:34.780 --> 01:33:40.760]  John B. Wells, our guest in studio. I'm your host Alex Jones, his websites
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:47.300]  caravan to midnight.com. Some of the top stories up on infowars.com and this story is linked
[01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:54.200]  on Drudge now. Russia warns America we will respond with nukes and that's been in the
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:59.800]  Russian news for about half a day. You would think the so-called state run media over here
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:03.920]  would want to pick that up. It's really a shame that info wars notice that put that
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:09.280]  up and now Drudge is carrying it. That just shows how far behind the curve the dinosaur
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:13.600]  media is. I want to talk about the media briefly with John B. Wells and hit a few other headlines
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:19.680]  and get his take on it and go directly to your calls. But John, people would think that
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:23.880]  I would be happy not having a lot of competition. Like most talk show host, obviously you don't
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:27.680]  have other talk show host on. But you guys have me on because we care about liberty and
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:33.480]  it's the same thing with the way that I promote world net daily or drudgereport.com or other
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:37.800]  things. It's good to have company that just wants to be good old fashioned, good guys
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:41.920]  in pro America and pro liberty and who don't want to be criminals and who don't want to
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:47.880]  be part of a new world order. I mean, really, we're just talking about basic liberty here.
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:53.440]  They've tried to pay us as bad, but that's not working anymore. But they didn't report
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:58.400]  it back when Russia threatened to nuke Europe in 2008 over the Georgia thing. And I'm not
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:05.920]  romanticizing Putin or Russia. You know you're in trouble when you, you look at somebody
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:11.200]  like Putin who's pro family and stuff and he looks like a better guy than what we've
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:16.680]  got. It's not that he's even good. It's that our leaders are so evil. I couldn't agree
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:21.560]  with you more when when Vladimir Putin looks like the good guy. I think we have a problem
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:27.120]  and as far as the dinosaur media is concerned, you know, let's take, let's take the guy who
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:33.040]  really is pretty much the Godfather talk radio. His first name begins with an R big guy, you
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:38.640]  know, it's not that I disagree. I agree with much of what he says. But the thing is, is
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:45.360]  he's been saying it for so long that you're almost numb to it. Look, this is not a one
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:52.040]  man movement. This is there's got to be exactly how do you get people out of their trance?
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:56.240]  You know what? I think what you do is convince them. First of all, you are not a victim.
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:02.000]  You have been led to believe you are a victim, but you are not. You have power. You have
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.760]  most assuredly have power. And when the and when the authorities that are there to act
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:13.880]  in your interest begin to oppress you, watch what happens when you push back. Oh, there
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:18.360]  will be a lot of bluster and a lot of bowing up and a lot of swagger. And then they're
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:22.560]  going to do something stupid. And when they do, the citizenry has to take responsibility
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:28.280]  for its actions. And they must respond. And when they do, you'll see the unjust authoritarian
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:32.520]  state back off real quick. And it's always happened that way. They'll try and crush
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:37.020]  you with power, but you don't let them in the first time that they fail and you don't
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:41.000]  retreat because you got sick to your stomach and you gave up too early in the fight. When
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.640]  you advance, if you take your weapon and they back off, don't back. Don't you back off.
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:52.240]  You advance. You cannot attack and defend at the same time. If they attack you, yield
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:56.920]  to it. But when that force is done, you go back, you go back through the courts, you
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:02.760]  go back through whatever means is necessary as granted you by the constitution. And don't
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:07.520]  you ever let this constitution go because if you do, you're done. And don't let go of
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:12.160]  your faith because if you do, it'll be replaced with anything they want to replace it with.
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:16.360]  I mean, and it has to start at the schools. How can we do this? You become your own little
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:20.280]  intelligence network. You look around your neighborhood and see what these cameras doing
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:23.840]  here. Then you get the rest of neighbors and just go on down to city hall and go to a council
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:27.520]  meeting, cause a disruption, ask them, why are you doing this? When I'm a crime in our
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:30.800]  neighborhood, why are you monitoring us? We want these down now or we're going to fire
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:34.560]  every one of you next election. And then if they don't take them down, I guess sometimes
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:39.360]  cameras get broken. Sometimes they do. You know, things happen. We have large pieces
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.760]  of hail that fall from the sky. Sometimes they break things like that, but it bothers
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:46.680]  me to drive down just a regular street where nobody's doing anything. It's not a high crime
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:51.320]  area. No gang members milling around, flashing signs of each other. And I see a camera up
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:55.760]  there that's got a badge on it and says police. And it's one of those multiple cameras. We
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:58.040]  can see all that. I'm just like, I remember when they were first putting them in, they
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:03.080]  said, Oh, it's for traffic, but it will always. And again, I can drive to an area of Austin
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:08.400]  right now and find hookers and crack. They're not stopping. They just keep it in an area
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:12.040]  and then they use it to go around and take all the rest of the rights. And again, ladies
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:15.520]  and gentlemen, at the top, it's rotten. We're not saying people mid level, low level or
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:19.080]  bad on average. In fact, that's what's been holding it back is they can't get the military
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:23.480]  and police to carry all this out, but just by repetitive pushing, they're doing it.
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:29.880]  I want to go to calls, but I said I would go through some of this other news. Here's
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:34.920]  just some of it. Okay. We are Colin Powell endorses single payer healthcare system. Some
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:40.520]  members of Congress want to take Obamacare a step further. And now you get Republican
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:47.320]  leaders and others joining with Bernie Sanders, who's a socialist, basically a communist,
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:54.400]  wanting to bring in, this was always the plan, but mess up the old system. And we said this,
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:59.040]  we're proven right now and they're doing it. Yeah, mess up the old system, which was every
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:03.920]  system has its problems, but you, but you, you mess up the old system and it's now it's
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:08.520]  destroyed. So here, let's try this. This is a, well, this is a stop gap measure. It needs
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:12.240]  some work, but it'll be fine for now. It's not fine for now. It's not fine at all. Well,
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:17.440]  they messed it up with government to begin with. Absolutely. Absolutely. And, and any
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:20.520]  time, look, it's become cliche. And this is another one of those cliches. Alex, I don't
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:25.600]  think anybody pays attention to when government starts running things, it gets messed up as
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:29.240]  long as individual there and because you don't have choice anymore to go across street to
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:33.360]  a better hospital. It's all run by the same. They crave running our lives and you don't
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:37.840]  have the initiative to improve anything because it's government now. So it's permanent and
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:43.360]  you, oh, you can't fight city hall. He certainly can't fight Capitol Hill. So, uh, might as
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:47.720]  well just roll with it. It's, it's, it is like communism because we look at the alcoholism
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:52.320]  rate under the Soviet Union. 90% of the men were hardcore alcoholics because there was
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:57.040]  no reason. There was no motivation to do anything or dream anything or create anything or produce
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:02.240]  a good product. There was only the threat of being beaten. If you didn't do the minimums,
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:07.600]  but there were, there was no reason, no motivation whatsoever to go the extra mile in any department.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:11.480]  Everything happened in South Africa and the technocrats have already created their offshore
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.960]  systems where they're exempt, where they live in total freedom, no taxes, no regulations
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:20.920]  above the law. And they put us under this. It's just, it's, it's a no brainer. We shouldn't
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:25.800]  be going under this. People, you have power. You, you have much more power than you think,
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:31.280]  but be judicious in the use of your power. Don't be, don't use the stupid power. Use
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:35.840]  the smart. Absolutely. We're going to rush through more news. But first calls, John M,
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:40.040]  who's a police officer, should have gone to him earlier. And then Greg, Ashley, David
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:46.560]  and others. Up first is David, then we'll go to him. David in Kentucky, you're on the
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:50.840]  year. Thanks for calling in. Hey Alex, how you doing? Hey John.
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:56.720]  Basically, I wanted to, with the latest stuff coming out about the NSA and World of Warcraft
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:01.320]  and them spying on that, people aren't realizing whenever they're accepting permissions such
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:08.040]  as downloading Angry Birds Star Wars, they asked for permission for, to turn on your
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:12.160]  camera without your knowledge. I mean, it gets you to the point where on my Android
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:16.160]  phone, I have black electrical tape on both my cameras. I mean, it's getting pretty bad
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:20.120]  and people are just giving into this stuff just so they can play a game and they don't
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:25.880]  really realize it. Cause half the people don't even read the permissions, you know,
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:29.960]  I know all the time I see messages on the, it's on a phone. It's just a computer tracker
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:35.680]  system 100 times bigger than the biggest mainframe 20 years ago and more powerful. It says permission
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:40.960]  to turn on your webcam whenever we want. And they still just do it. This is a trojan horse.
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:44.360]  Now I at least admit it and use it against them to shoot videos on the road and stuff.
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:49.320]  But this is how they ubiquitously build it into everything. And it was in the telecommunications
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:54.280]  act in 96. I warned everybody cause I could read it, but people like, oh, the phone ain't
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:59.200]  gonna listen to us even when it's off. Shut up, you crazy nut. I'm like, here's the document.
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:03.520]  Shut up, you un-American. Stop saying my government would do something like that. And now it's
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:08.240]  like, okay, they need to listen to us. Yeah. Well, you don't need the device anyway. I
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:12.080]  mean, really, who needs to play Angry Birds? I got an idea. Read a book, read a history
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:16.480]  book, try and get one that hasn't been. Go climb up a hill, go out on a date, go to take
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:22.240]  a cooking class. Exactly. Throw the bloody thing. You want a camera? Get a little camera.
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:25.680]  You don't need it. You don't need a phone. It tracks you. It listens to you. It photographs
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:30.240]  you. You can't believe the stuff that goes on with my phone and phones and my close associates.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:34.320]  Well, you can, but people would say, oh, you're making this stuff up. It's like, no, I have
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:42.280]  actually seen text messages go to my assistant's phone that I didn't send. Pardon me. I had
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:46.960]  it backwards. I got text from my assistant that the moment that I read that I had a story
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:52.560]  reversed, I'm sorry, that was another incident. I muddled it. I said, this was not sent by
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:56.680]  this person. I said, did you send this? No. I said, well, I got him right here. And I
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:00.560]  said, let me see your phone when we got back together. I said, look at this. And it was
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:06.920]  a one of them was I'm in class. I thought class. And then the next one was sorry, busy
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:11.000]  now, call back later. And I thought that is not a message this person would have sent
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.080]  me worded like that. But there it was. Well, also, they built a second internet to spy
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:20.720]  on us with. So it also screws everything up because all the spy tech, it's having to
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:25.020]  do two things. They also, that's what Dr. Stallman talks about. All the top experts
[01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:29.400]  on this is it's all screwed up. And you have to pay the extra price when the things really
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:34.280]  designed to control your life. Yep. So so that you should cost half as much. And to
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:38.320]  show how cold-blooded they are, they all have slave factories. All they lecture us all day
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:42.520]  how we're races, because we won't turn our guns in. Great points, David. M on the West
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:47.200]  Coast is a police officer. Let's talk about police. And you're on the air with John B.
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:52.640]  Wells and Alex Jones. Go ahead. Good morning, fellows. How are you? Oh, we're trying. We're
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.680]  trying to live in a free country. How about you? Yeah, well, I'm with you. Hey, just
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:04.720]  talking on the instinctive shooting, I've been a police officer for 16 years. I'm a
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:09.880]  constitutional police officer. I work in a smaller community. So I'm work one on one
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:14.520]  with a lot of my community members. I live there in the community. So I'm bested. I'm
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:19.960]  an old-time copper. I got into the line of work to serve my... You change old ladies'
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:24.760]  tires. You go to domestic disturbances. You're a servant of the people. Well, you know, that's
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:29.000]  the thing is these big city coppers, a lot of them are good guys, but they laugh. I mean,
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.720]  for instance, a couple weeks ago, I made the paper because I pushed a lady that her electric
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.960]  wheelchair broke down. I pushed her a quarter mile to her house and she was about 300 pounds.
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:42.960]  I mean, I was tired at the end. But you know what? Most of us cops, we do stuff like that.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:47.200]  The negative stuff is the stuff that's reported. The positive stuff is you rarely hear about.
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:52.720]  I was at the beach and an old woman who was paralyzed in her legs. Her thing had conked
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:59.520]  out and gotten stuck. It turned out it was broken. And I drug her about 300 yards through
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:02.800]  the sand and almost probably had a heart attack. It was really hard. I couldn't imagine doing
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:07.200]  it as far as you did. But again, it's a normal thing to want to help an old lady. It's not
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:11.680]  like it's something heroic, but good job. But seeing being normal now is heroic.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:17.760]  Well, and that's the thing, fellas, is that, listen, I got into this work to be a servant.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:22.160]  And that's how I look at myself. I'm a public servant. And with the instinctive shooting,
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:28.720]  listen, back in 1998, my fellow officer of mine, uh, hesitated on shooting a guy that
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:33.440]  pulled guns on him and because he thought they were cap guns and he lost his life. The backup
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:37.800]  officer luckily shot the guy. I didn't kill him, but put two in his chest. Now the guy
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:43.640]  is doing life, but listen, when we see a threat, I mean, a lot of those airsoft guns look real
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:49.800]  and I don't care if you're 40 years old or, you know, 15. If you point a weapon at me,
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:55.320]  listen, I'm going to take care of business and we are trained to put web, put bullets
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:59.240]  down range until the threat is gone. We know, I know. And I mean, you're not a devil worshiping
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:03.560]  Democrat either. Cause you had instinctive shooting video games with devil worship and
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:08.120]  being a part of the democratic party. You're Adam Lanza and almost every other mass shooter
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:11.320]  was a Democrat. And I'm not even a Republican or Democrat. I'm just sick of these Democrats
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:15.800]  and I understand the police are not devil worshiping Democrats who then take instincts
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:21.680]  of shooting. I just, I just read this guy in the SWAT magazine saying, do something even
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:27.160]  if it didn't right. And I'm just like, and I mean, I get, I get it. I understand that.
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:31.400]  Okay. But this particular airsoft did not look real. It had a middle that was clear
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:35.480]  and all this, but I guess it didn't look enough like it. My whole point is, is that
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:41.800]  it's a screwed up society. And I mean, look at how neighbors call the cops on people if
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:45.080]  they see them putting a gun in their car, even though the gun's legal. I mean, I'm sure you,
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:46.520]  you probably get those calls, don't you?
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:54.840]  We get all kinds of calls. I mean, it's just, but I want you, I want, I want you guys to
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:47:01.720]  understand something is that the society has changed and the police, the role of a police
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:05.560]  officer's changed. We're not only there to protect and serve anymore. I mean, we're counselors,
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:11.240]  we're dads, we're, we're best friends. You know, people call us for everything. And this is what
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:16.840]  I was taught when I was first started in law enforcement 94. Know by what authority you act.
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:22.280]  It's never right to do wrong. So when in doubt, you don't do it. It's common sense.
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:30.120]  Let me ask you a question. Have you ever run into anybody in a police officer's uniform
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:37.560]  that you were convinced has joined the force as a legal method of killing people in your 16 years?
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:42.680]  Have you run into any psychos that eventually got kind of ushered out of the departments?
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:46.280]  Because we know human beings. I mean, just because you're a policeman doesn't mean that, you know,
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:51.560]  the, the, the, the heavenly orchestra sang as you were anointed with your, your badge. I mean,
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:56.200]  we know that you're, that you're people subject to those jealous sheriff's Japanese look like thugs.
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:01.400]  Yeah. But have you run into anybody that you felt like was, had gotten into the force because he
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:04.840]  has stood a good chance of being able to cap somebody, kill him and get away with it?
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:11.000]  I wouldn't say that. I say, I run into what we call badge heavy guys who get into it because
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.200]  I, I agree with Alex who said this in the past, guys that were picked on in school or, or, you
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:21.240]  know, feel like I've got some power, at least in my area, the area I work, those guys don't
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:25.240]  really, they don't make it because they end up violating policy and then they're, they're ushered
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:29.960]  out. But I haven't, I haven't personally met. Yeah. Well, I'm found usually smaller departments
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:33.640]  are better on average. Then you can also get a boss hog department. It's the big ones that are
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:37.480]  either good or bad I've seen. And I mean, you know, take New York, I run a lot of cops with
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:41.560]  their little listeners, but also I've been to big events and the cops act like goons. I mean,
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:46.840]  hats on sideways, smoking cigarettes. I mean, when their belly's hanging out, I mean, it's just like,
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:51.560]  and this is what unions end up doing. And I think that's the issue is the unaccountability
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:55.160]  and bad guys being protected. All right, good to hear from you. Appreciate the call him.
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:59.320]  Let's go ahead and talk to Greg in Oklahoma. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:04.600]  Go ahead, Greg. You want to talk about FEMA camps? You there, buddy?
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:10.120]  All right, Greg is gone. Let's, or maybe come back in a minute. Ashley in Wisconsin, you're on the
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:18.600]  air. Go ahead. Hey, hey, I would just say that I feel very blessed to talk to you gentlemen this
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:24.600]  afternoon. I'm up here in Wisconsin and it's very, very cold. Yeah, record low temperatures,
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:29.720]  but Al Gore says that's proven global warming. Absolutely. Of course, of course. Polar bears
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:34.680]  can't swim. Yes, I know. No, he says if it melts, they're going to die.
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:42.520]  I woke up a year and a half ago and thankfully I started to wake up spiritually and then my
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:48.360]  mind started to unlock. I was away from the body of Christ for a long time, but I'm back and now
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:55.560]  I can send myself a soldier for Christ and I'm full fight every single day. But John, I was going
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:00.360]  to ask you, I was reading that you're into martial arts and since I've woken up, I definitely had
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:05.800]  a lot more aggression. I'm like a channel and a lot healthier ways. Do you know of any accredited
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:13.240]  places in Wisconsin that are Patriot supported? Okay, okay. I get the question. Thanks for the
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:17.240]  call, ma'am. She wants to know like what kind of martial arts you like, what kind of group,
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:20.520]  you know, it's national that might be in her area that you think's a good place to go.
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:27.000]  Well, here's the thing. No, I'm not an authority on this, but to me, the best martial arts,
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.880]  a traditional martial art. I study Yang style, long form, Tai Chi, Chan, Kung Fu, it's relaxing
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:39.000]  and violence and aggression is discouraged. It's the last thing that you do. It's mind, body and
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:44.440]  spirit, coordination and calming and equilibrium. Of course, as part of the human condition,
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:47.320]  you should be able to defend yourself. But that's the last thing you do. Number one,
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:52.760]  avoid. Number two, block third, gloves off. Here we go. That's right, because the key to winning

[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:14.120]  because there's a war on for your mind. We're going to do a little five minutes of overdrive
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:23.240]  for internet only. I've got all this other news I want to get to. There's just so much of it here.
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:30.760]  200,000 people apply to be first to live on Mars. That's off from CNN. I'd go if it wasn't
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:35.240]  communist or socialist. I mean that's just legalized theft going. If you have ambitions for
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:39.320]  being one of the first people on Mars, listen up. A Dutch company says it's moving along its plan
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:44.680]  to send for four lucky earthlings to colonize the red planet. I think the first mission won't
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:50.520]  fare too well. The catch, they won't ever come back. No kidding. What do you make of that John?
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:54.280]  Because there's a breakaway civilization as we know. We know that the government is 40 years
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:59.080]  ahead of what they show us. They use our money to play God and underground bases, all of it.
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:02.360]  What do you make of all this? I mean how advanced do you think they really are? Because they act
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:06.040]  like they don't even care that we exist now. You mean how advanced do I think the government
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:11.480]  really is? I really believe this. I'm going to go way out there and live and people are going to
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:16.600]  roll their eyes at this one but it's like I'm serious about this. This UFO thing is undeniable
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:22.200]  and the Nazis did have some major, major projects going on that have turned into many of the modern
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:28.200]  era. My grandfather saw jet airplanes when he was flying bombers over Europe. They were attacked
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:32.200]  by jet airplanes. He wouldn't tell about anything else. The thing is those are some smart cats and
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:36.840]  they went to Kamler. I think his name was. They reverse engineered this thing that crashed out
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:43.320]  there in 37 or 38, maybe even as early as 36 and there have been bell-shaped objects, this thing
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:48.280]  that they had one of them come down in the United States. So I believe that we are not only working
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:52.680]  with data and technology. I think we're probably working with the aliens themselves and I have
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:57.640]  seen these photographs. In fact I'll show it to you later. I've got it on my iPhone. Somebody
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:02.360]  near and dear to me. Credibility absolutely beyond reproach. There's nothing faked about this. When
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:05.880]  you see this you're going to go, now there's something you don't see every day and indeed that
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:11.400]  is true. So I took a photo just of the sky. I think it was pretty. It took like six or seven of them
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:18.040]  and you can look at it and it's like a planetoid. It's not a lens flare. You can see stuff on it
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:23.240]  and then it's gone after I took like five photos of that. I've got the photo. It was there then
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:28.200]  it disappeared and then it began to glow in the same spot and then here came these little streaks
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:31.480]  of light going across. They looked like somebody operating a spotlight really quick but you can't
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:35.560]  operate a spotlight that quick and cover that kind of track at that range to make that spotlight.
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:39.400]  These are not spotlights. Well here's an example. They lined up and all fed into this thing. Here's
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:44.360]  an example. We were driving from Fairfield, Texas where we got a ranch nearby. Back to Dallas when
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:48.680]  I was about six or seven visiting grandma and my dad saw this. They were having like, I never saw
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:53.320]  army tanks on the street tearing up some of the asphalt on the shoulder and troops and
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:59.080]  and then we saw stealth fighters. This is like decades before the stealth fighter came out but
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:03.800]  even longer but now that I have that image always of two of them turning their afterburners but
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:08.760]  they were flying over a field like 500 yards away and then they and I was like, what is that?
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:15.240]  My dad goes some kind of secret aircraft. But the point is that that was like six years old.
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:19.240]  That was like 30 something five years ago. We tried to get the director of the United
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:26.120]  States Air Force Space Command on the program on coast one night and Jack said no without a
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:31.480]  PR officer there are no. So those guys have been busy. They got an unlimited budget and I suspect
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:35.160]  that there's a reason we have a United States Air Force Space Command. There's probably a lot of
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:39.160]  you know space cadets and commanders flying around up there on a regular basis. No there are.
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:43.480]  That space command is I talked to Marine Corps captain who they later started a computer company
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:47.800]  that he was in space command. He goes look man it's all crazy and and and that's the thing he
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:51.320]  says there's just NASA is a complete front. Absolutely. That's like they're like oh there's
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:55.880]  no more space program huh. I go back to sleep. Well that was the PR deal was that no we're
[01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:59.560]  going to wait the Air Force is getting rid of it. We're going to give it to NASA and we're not
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:03.640]  going to do anything. Well by the way I talk about space command folks think I'm making it up.
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:08.520]  You can go to the space command website. Yeah well DARPA is Air Force with a little bit of navy
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:13.240]  for mostly Air Force so there it is. I think they're 50 years out Alex at least.
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:20.200]  Yeah because if if if I was five six I don't know six seven years old and these were like
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:24.840]  gray and green. They don't like the stealth fighters you see now. They looked even bigger.
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:28.280]  They weren't stealth bombers. Just like and then all of a sudden turn their burners on
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:33.160]  and we're just gone. By plane suggests back in the 30s and 40s and not even 10 years.
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:42.520]  And now nothing develops. Nothing advances except for little spy. This is GCN the Genesis

[02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:31.560]  Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight standing in for Alex on this
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:37.080]  Wednesday before Thanksgiving. We're going to be joined in the next segment by Gerald Salenty,
[02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:42.520]  Trends Journal, and he's going to analyze for us what he sees happening in China. We're going to
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:47.240]  talk a little bit about the Trans Pacific Partnership, the rise of Chinese hegemony,
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:52.200]  what they're doing with their Navy. And we're also going to talk about what's going on in Iran.
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:57.800]  So don't miss that. Stay tuned for this. Now we've had a lot of information like I mentioned just
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:06.920]  before the break about how Obama and company are dictating to the American public exactly what
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:12.600]  they can and cannot do. And we had a caller or actually somebody wasn't a caller, somebody who
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:17.240]  talked to Alex and made him want to call in and talk to us about how they were concerned that
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:22.040]  we were very negative about things, made them feel bad because we pointed out what was really
[02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:27.000]  happening in the world. And we've had Dr. Sharkey on just talking about killer robots. Do you not
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.400]  want to know what's happening in the world? Do you just want to go whistling through the graveyard?
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:35.960]  Or do you want to be informed so you can actually do something about it? And we talked yesterday and
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:42.120]  today about juries. Listen to this particular case here. We've got a 16-year-old who was jailed at
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:48.600]  Rikers Island in New York for three years without a trial. This is why the legal system is important.
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:57.240]  This is a teen who spent three years, 400 days of it in solitary confinement. Now he is now filing
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:03.320]  a lawsuit in New York City and he was just mysteriously let go. He said that they brought him
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:08.760]  into case. First of all, he was arrested because they suspected him of being involved in robbery as
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:13.720]  he was walking home from a party in the Bronx. So he was arrested, taken to Rikers Island,
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:18.680]  which is a pretty rough prison in New York. And he was held because he couldn't pay the $10,000
[02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:23.800]  bail. He went to court on several occasions, but he was never scheduled for trial. And after 33
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:30.520]  months in jail, he said a judge offered him freedom in exchange for a guilty plea, threatening
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:36.680]  that if he didn't take the plea bargain that he could face 15 years in jail if convicted.
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:42.280]  But he refused. And then one day they came in, they never gave him a trial. They never even
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:45.880]  charged him with anything. They held him for three years. One day they came in and just released
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:50.280]  him with no explanation. He said they dismissed the case and they think it's all right. No apology,
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:56.040]  no nothing. Well, good for him. He's suing them, but we need to hold these people accountable.
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:03:01.720]  When we see things happening with police abuse, at the very least, that police department needs to
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:07.080]  have fines that are taken out in lawsuits. That needs to come out of their budget. As it is right
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:13.240]  now, it's the taxpayers who are being penalized, who are having to pay for these lawsuits because
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:17.400]  of abuses of the police. The police are not getting any personal fines as they should.
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:23.800]  And the police department itself is not even getting any fines. But this guy, this 16-year-old
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:29.320]  hung tough. He did not take the plea bargain. People need to do that. They need to stand up
[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:35.160]  for their rights. They need to demand a jury trial. They need to not take a plea bargain.
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:39.640]  They realized at this point, I think, after 33 months of holding this guy in jail, they realized
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:43.880]  that, hey, this is really going to blow up in our face. We need to get this guy to sign a paper,
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:49.320]  we'll let him go, and it'll just disappear. Because they never charged him with anything,
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:53.880]  and he never got his jury trial. And so many people, when faced with, they're telling him,
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:57.400]  you're going to stay in jail for another 15 years because we're going to find you guilty.
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:01.960]  He knew they couldn't find him guilty. He had that kind of confidence and that enough
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:06.200]  confidence in the system of jurors. Do you think he would have thought that he would be
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:10.760]  found guilty if he was just going to be standing before a single judge? And yet that's what we
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:15.080]  see increasingly happening in America in all levels. We see that it's just a single judge.
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:20.440]  It's not a jury trial as the Constitution demands. We have single judges and tax court or
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:24.120]  traffic court or whatever. You need to demand a jury trial. But the most frightening thing
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:28.840]  is not just that they're intimidating people into waiving their jury rights and taking a plea
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:34.200]  bargain. But the most frightening thing to me is that we have this secretive FISA court,
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:41.400]  which meets in secret, which creates edicts in secret that they pretend, alter the Constitution,
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:45.160]  and the public is never even allowed to see it. And there's no one arguing the other side of the
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:50.280]  case and there's no jury. And yet what's on trial? Our basic fundamental constitutional rights.
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:52.600]  We'll be right back with Gerald Salenty. Stay tuned.
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:03.720]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:10.360]  bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world. Guess what else is in a halogen family?
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:16.440]  Fluoride. Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here. In 1924, the federal government did the right thing
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:22.680]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine. It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:29.080]  And the results are on record, reports documented, a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had
[02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:34.920]  previously been deficient in iodine. Bottom line, iodine is important. Unbound, clean,
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:40.120]  in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family. You will

[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:08.280]  planetary economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies

[02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:32.280]  Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight filling in for Alex on this
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:39.160]  Wednesday before Thanksgiving and today we have Gerald Salenty who has graciously agreed to come
[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:44.360]  on our show on this busy holiday weekend. He's an American trans forecaster. No stranger to you
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:50.360]  if you're a listener of the show. He publishes trends journal. You can find that at trendsresearch.com.
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:56.600]  Gerald is somebody that you want to talk to if you want to know what's going on in the world.
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:03.560]  I interviewed him about a week or so ago and we were talking about his experiences with Governor
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:09.000]  Connolly who was as you remember involved in the shooting in the JFK assassination. But one of the
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:14.440]  things I thought was most interesting about that was the reason that he met Governor Connolly and
[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:21.800]  that was because he had written a book three years prior to that time saying that Ross Perot was
[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:28.120]  likely to be the person who had run saying that there was a lot of dissatisfaction with the two
[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:33.000]  party system and that he thought that Ross Perot would be the guy that would step up into that
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:38.120]  gap and at that time that he met with Governor Connolly. Governor Connolly wanted to know how
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:45.720]  he knew that. Well, Gerald is very astute and he really does see the trends. He describes himself
[02:09:45.720 --> 02:09:51.160]  as a political atheist. I guess Gerald, that would mean that you don't necessarily buy into
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:54.920]  something just because it's put out by one political party or the other. You're a little bit
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:59.480]  skeptical, right? I guess you could be called, you gotta be careful. You could be called a conspiracy
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:04.440]  theorist if you're skeptical of the two main parties, right? Yeah. Well, first of all, thank
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:08.840]  you for having me on, David, and happy Thanksgiving to you and everyone. It's always a pleasure.
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:14.200]  I'm a political atheist. I don't believe in the political system. It's just like, you know,
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:19.480]  I don't believe in, it's like someone would not believe in a religion. I don't believe in the
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:26.120]  bloods and the crypts. That to me is who they are. And I don't say that in jest. By their deeds,
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:31.720]  you shall know them. Look at the people that they murder because they want to go to war. That's,
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:36.280]  I mean, that really is way beyond what the bloods and crypts could pull off about,
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:43.000]  you know, the official half million people that were killed in Iraq by the United States
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:48.760]  in a war that was fought on over lives. And as far as, you know, of course, there's murder and
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:54.280]  there's thievery. Look at the money they steal from us every day, whether it's giving it to their
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:11:00.280]  buddies in the banks or stealing it in the name of taxes and giving it to their friends in the
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:09.880]  military or the cyber industrial complex. And I could go on and on. So it's, it is, I do not
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:18.200]  believe in murder or criminality. So why should I believe in their corrupt system? So I am a
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:23.480]  political atheist. I have nothing to do with them. I want to get your take on what's going on with
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:27.960]  this UN Iran deal that's being talked about so much in the press. I guess the first two things
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:32.680]  that stick out to me as we're looking at it kind of from a journalistic perspective is the fact that
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:37.000]  the Iranians are coming out and claiming that the White House has put out a different version
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.760]  of the deal than they agreed to it. Doesn't that sound like the way that Obama always operates? He
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:44.920]  tells one group one thing. He tells another group something completely different. And he thinks
[02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:49.160]  that he's not going to get caught in it. What's what they all do again? This has been going off
[02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:54.200]  ever. Like I just talked about, you know, the Iraq war, you know, Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:12:00.360]  destruction and ties to Al Qaeda, I tell you, you know, it's one lie after another. So as far as I
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:08.840]  see this, this, to me, this is the most positive thing that Obama has ever done if we could have
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:14.920]  peace with Iran. And I want to put this into perspective. What has Iran done to us other than
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:21.000]  the incident, of course, that happened with the takeover the US embassy that most people don't
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:26.680]  remember the facts of and know don't know the details behind it or what happened before.
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:31.160]  That's the key thing is not understanding what happened before. There was a long history.
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:36.600]  That's when most people in America began to first start thinking about Iran was when they saw the
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:40.120]  embassy taken over. But but go ahead, you were you were just going to talk about the long history
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:46.760]  of that. Well, as you as you well know, you know, the United States in the UK, the CIA and the was
[02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:53.800]  it the MI six or my five, the they overthrew the democratically elected government of Mosadegh in
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:13:01.880]  1953. And you know why he had the nerve. Could you imagine this to nationalize the oil fields?
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:11.320]  That's right. To call the Iranian oil their oil and not Anglo Iranian better known boys and girls
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:17.400]  as BP, those wonderful people that pollute the planet. Hey, hadn't he shrimp lately from the
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:22.680]  Gulf? That's right. And then, of course, the other company that was in there that was monopolizing
[02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:29.320]  the fields, Standard Oil, those wonderful people better known today as Exxon Mobile.
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:37.000]  So they overthrew him and put in this dictator the Shah. And when if you read about what was going
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:43.240]  on during those times, as I did, this guy, you know, a guy like me, I'd be tortured and probably
[02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:50.040]  dead by now if I lived in Iran and spoke out against them. So when the when the overthrow
[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:58.280]  happened, the they kept telling America to leave to get out. You're not going to tell us to get
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:03.880]  out. Don't you know we are says Jimmy Carter, who came back from spending New Year's Eve with the
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:10.920]  wife with his wife and the show on his wife and comes back to America trots up again. In those
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:16.280]  days, it was a big deal when the president went overseas, kind of like when George Bush left
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:22.520]  the country, you know, it was a big deal. And he goes up to the microphones and he announces to
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:29.160]  the American people that the show is the island of stability in the Middle East. By the way,
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:35.160]  that's when I became a political atheist, because I was in Washington between Washington and Chicago
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:40.120]  in those days. I was working as a government affairs specialist for the chemical industry.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:46.200]  As a young guy, I'm staying at the Willard Hotel, putting my meetings on the A Adams. So I was there
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:53.960]  in the middle of it at a pretty good level. So anyway, I began buying gold and silver, excuse
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:15:01.080]  me, trading gold and oil, because I knew that Carter was full of bologna to make it clear.
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:08.120]  So that was the only incident. Now, we're still holding this over, you know, come on,
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:13.640]  let's get over this. This is back in 1978-79. I want to interject something there too out of my
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.440]  personal experience, Gerald. I was in university at the time. I was studying engineering, and we
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:23.960]  had a lot of Iranian students that were in engineering. And before the Shah was taken out,
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:28.840]  they used to regularly demonstrate against the Shah. And it was the first time I'd ever seen
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:34.120]  people walking around wearing head covering. And so many of them were in engineering. I asked some
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:38.680]  of these guys afterwards, I said, why are you guys covering your face? And they educated me about
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:45.480]  the savak that the Shah, that the CIA had trained in Iran. They said, we're worried that they're
[02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:51.160]  going to see who we are. This is before we have all the facial recognition and biometrics that we
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:55.800]  have now today. But they were very busy even back then. They were there at every demonstration
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:16:00.680]  they had against the brutality of the Shah of Iran. And they were taking pictures of people's
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:04.760]  faces. And these students were afraid that they were going to take recriminations on their families
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:09.800]  back home because they were protesting the brutality of the Shah in America. That's the
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:14.680]  kind of person that the CIA put into office. That's the kind of person that Carter and
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:19.320]  Brzezinski were supporting in office. So go ahead. Well, you know the facts. Again,
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:29.080]  I forgot all about the savak, the secret police. They were second to the SS. So anyway, so now
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:35.800]  here we are all these years later. And what's going on here? And I'll tell you as I see it,
[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:43.160]  the reason they're making a deal with Iran, it's all about money. The American economy is in the
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:51.080]  crapper. Everybody knows it. As you look at, for example, median household income is 8.3 percent,
[02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:58.840]  2007 levels. And we could go on with the data forever about how the 1 percent has got all
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:04.600]  the gains and the rest of us are stagnant or declining. And how many young people can't get
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:12.120]  jobs and the 95 percent of the jobs that are created don't pay a living wage or a part time.
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:21.400]  So the economy is in trouble. Here we are now. The only 70 percent of our GDP is based on consumer
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:27.160]  spending. Wonderful. We used to be a manufacturing country, but that's another story. All the dough
[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:33.000]  that's going into the gas tank and going to heating your homes is not going into retailers
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:41.320]  cash registers. There's a glut of oil on the market, particularly when Iran gets back in the game.
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:47.720]  You're already seeing oil prices going lower. This could be a good temporary boost
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:55.400]  for the economy. It could also be the kind of thing where the Fed could use it as an excuse
[02:17:55.400 --> 02:18:02.280]  for tapering because they're saying the economy is boosting. David, it's always about money.
[02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:09.880]  And this is a bottom line deal as I see it. And look at the way now the United States is
[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:14.760]  pulling away from Saudi Arabia, because they're not going to rely on them that much,
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:20.920]  because Iran is sitting on all of this oil. You go back to several years ago, they're putting out
[02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:32.760]  what? About 4.5 million barrels a day. And now Iran's putting out about 1.2. So they need the dough.
[02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:40.920]  America needs to bring oil prices down. I see there's nothing more than a deal for oil,
[02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:47.720]  a deal for the economy. It has nothing to do, as none of it ever does have to do,
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:55.480]  with real democracy or geopolitical needs. And this is being portrayed as the very existence
[02:18:55.480 --> 02:19:01.960]  of Israel being threatened. And yet we see Saudi Arabia joining with Israel and opposing this deal.
[02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:08.200]  That's pretty interesting. I find what you're just saying about the bringing oil down, of course,
[02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:12.840]  Saudi Arabia would not want that happen. You would think if this was simply ideologically
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:18.680]  and religiously based that the Saudis would be siding with Iran instead of siding with the Israelis.
[02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:24.520]  But Saudi Arabia wants to keep oil high. They don't want to see the price go low if the Iranian
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:29.960]  supplies are brought onto the market. And they want to control the market as they have. They're
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:36.360]  the number one player there and they're calling the shots. That wonderful kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:42.200]  yeah, when they chop the head off in public really slowly. That's right, our favorite theocracy.
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:45.880]  We're going to be right back with Gerald Salenty right after the break. So stay tuned. We're going
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:59.080]  to talk about China and about the Trans-Pacific Partnership as well. Alex Jones here to tell you
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:03.400]  about how you can help spread liberty worldwide. I'm also enjoying what I have found to be the

[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:18.840]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david knight and we're joined on the phone with
[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:24.840]  gerald salinity and we were just talking about iran and what gerald analyzes that to be he's the
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:31.800]  publisher of trends journal and that's at trendsresearch.com i was just looking during the
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:37.000]  break at this article that kurt nemo put up on info wars about obama telling his hollywood allies
[02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:42.120]  to cut movie violence he says they need to think long and hard about what they're going to do so
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:46.120]  here we have the dictator in chief telling them what kind of movies they're going to make we got
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:49.800]  bloomberg telling you what kind of food to eat we got obama telling you what kind of insurance
[02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:53.560]  you're going to buy what kind of movies you're going to watch we have the bill of melinda gates
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:58.920]  foundation determining how your children are going to be educated what they're going to be taught and
[02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:03.720]  of course they don't care much for religion but we have these people whose religion seems to be that
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:09.240]  of the omnipotent state and he's joined along with senator Lieberman who has proposed a bill that
[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:15.000]  would allow the government to find companies that advertise violent movies to children because
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:19.880]  always it's about the children well you're not going to be able to distinguish whether they're
[02:25:19.880 --> 02:25:25.480]  advertising it to children or to adults and so that's the way the tyranny always creeps in
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:30.200]  but i i bring that up because one of the things about this iranian deal gerald is that
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:36.760]  from my standpoint i thought was interesting was that both the associated press and the iranian
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:42.360]  press the al monitor were working with their respective governments to do exactly what the
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:47.880]  governments wanted to they kept this secret since march they've known about this and the ap says
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:51.400]  that they didn't know about it i'll monitor says well we weren't really sure the details and so
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:57.160]  forth but there's a reporter laura rosen who says that both her journal and the ap had the story and
[02:25:57.160 --> 02:26:04.120]  kept quiet about it for months to help the obama administration it's pretty amazing the censorship
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:09.960]  the dictatorship and how the mainstream media plays ball with these people well that's why
[02:26:09.960 --> 02:26:15.160]  call them prostitutes yeah yeah that's what they do and they send us to war and you know
[02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:20.040]  you're talking about the gun violence by the way as you're going reading as you're mentioning all
[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:26.360]  these things hey it's it's no good for the kids but a couple of drones you know wife and out some
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:32.440]  yemen kids of pakistanis or afghan kids they don't count oh and all those kids that were
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:38.600]  slaughtered in iraq or you want to talk about gun violence let's talk about real gun violence
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:45.640]  hey how about a little depleted uranium does that count as gun violence how about those guys up there
[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:53.560]  in the helicopter that bradley manning is in jail for shooting innocent people and joking about it
[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:59.640]  is that gun violence yeah the irony is just amazing isn't it that he would do all of these
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:03.720]  things and then complain about these fictional characters but one of the things about that
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:09.320]  year old is that they're depicting in movies individuals having guns he wants a world where
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:14.440]  only the government has the guns right yeah exactly is what i'm saying yeah and he was
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:18.440]  talking about all these you know how they're watching over everything that they're doing about
[02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:24.200]  us i gotta tell you i'm fed up with the cops man i've had it you know the other night i went up to

[02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:18.280]  department isn't using anymore that we pay an arm and a leg for from these military contractors
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:24.680]  that are now going to rural police departments you want to talk about the loss of our rights i've
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:30.760]  had it with this crap you know i remember going out at night on a friday and saturday night and you
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:37.160]  sound old enough to remember too when the roads used to be packed with people yeah and now they're

[02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:58.760]  why they don't go after them because they only commit misdeeds yeah that's right they missed
[02:28:58.760 --> 02:29:06.200]  or they miss sold no it's never grand larceny it's never robbery robbery or burglary you know we
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:12.920]  need the cops to go after the slime whether it's john the slime corps line or these gang bangers and
[02:29:12.920 --> 02:29:19.720]  leave us alone the war tolls we were told by the justice department these guys are too big to jail
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:25.160]  hsbc ubs they were too big to jail we couldn't do anything to those companies we had to give them

[02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:27.560]  the amazing hypocrisy of obama lecturing hollywood about violent movies when he's killing people with
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:32.920]  drones around the world this is a case in new york where they have had people register their guns
[02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:39.560]  and now they're sending out these these notifications that appears that you are in possession of a
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:46.360]  rifle and or shotgun listed below immediately surrender your rifle and or shotgun to your local

[02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:03.640]  that's right there in new york yeah just as i was saying you know it's it's
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:10.520]  yeah you screw the little people they're taking all our rights away from us they're watching everything
[02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:15.880]  who could have ever would imagine that this would have happened to our nation yeah oh absolutely
[02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:22.920]  let's turn back to international trends here and what do you see happening in china they're
[02:35:22.920 --> 02:35:29.320]  building a massive navy and at the same time the us is asserting its control trying to assert its
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:36.360]  control by putting surface to water missiles at choke points around the asian pacific at the same
[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:42.040]  time that china is building up a massive deep water navy and asserting that they own certain
[02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:49.480]  japanese islands certain islands around korea and yesterday the us flew b-52s in defiance of
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:56.440]  what the chinese had just said the us sends two b-52 bombers into the air zone claimed by china
[02:35:56.440 --> 02:36:00.760]  according to the new york times defying china two long-range american bombers flew through
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:06.680]  contested airspace in the east china sea now of course the american officials said oh no we were
[02:36:06.680 --> 02:36:11.240]  not being provocative they were being provocative and and maybe that's true you know when somebody
[02:36:11.240 --> 02:36:14.920]  put something in your face maybe you stand up to them i don't know how do you read this build up
[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:21.480]  between china and the us well it's part of that pivot asia that's part of the obama program
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:28.200]  and i think we really should need we need to step back from all of it and what are we doing over
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:33.400]  there what's the united states doing any place other than how come that we're not at home yes
[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:40.360]  we don't need a military we need a defense force this is insanity here the country is going down
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:46.520]  and every level was the latest numbers out now our infrastructure is going to take four trillion
[02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:55.320]  just to repair and now of course what is about a week ago reuters reported that the they can't find
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:37:03.400]  eight point five trillion that the pentagon spent since 1996 what are we doing over there
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:12.360]  we imagine if this was a reversal and there was a disputed island between let's say united states
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:19.560]  in mexico and the chinese came over and flew over it you know what are we doing over there
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:25.880]  enough of this oh the military are they're really brilliant in this country hey that's a great war
[02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:32.200]  they won over there in iraq wasn't it hey david how about that winner in afghanistan you know
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:37.880]  the longest war in american history longer than world war one and world war two put together
[02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:42.040]  and we're gonna be there it's another 10 years that they just came out this week and said and
[02:37:42.040 --> 02:37:47.240]  perhaps beyond and it was back in 2006 a british commander said we're going to be there for 20 years
[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:54.840]  yeah and oh and didn't um el presidente say during the presidential campaign that we were
[02:37:54.840 --> 02:38:05.000]  going to be out of there by 2014 and now the date is ostensibly 2024 so what i'm saying is whether
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  it's vietnam whether it's korean war whether it's what what are they doing here you know it's a
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:18.200]  provocation it's none of our business and if anybody does think it's their business pack up your
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:23.000]  gear and go over there and fight it of course send your money because i don't want to send my money
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:28.040]  for this stuff that's right of course it's all set up to enrich the military industrial complex
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:33.240]  and now they're these same globalist corporations that have been robbing us blind so that we could
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:38.760]  have continuous war ever since world war two there's an article now that came out on let's
[02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:44.600]  see what was this this was the telegraph and this is from ambrose evans pritchard and here's the title
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:51.800]  he says china japan rearm rearmament is a kanesian stimulus if it doesn't go horribly wrong so there
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:56.760]  you go now not only should the us build up because we're threatened by the chinese but the chinese are
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:01.880]  threatened by the us so now we can sell weapons to both of those sides and it's a good thing because
[02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:09.160]  it's a kanesian stimulus yeah this is a sicko for you here i want to read a quote this is from um
[02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:18.680]  monday the u.s military will continue conducting flight operations in the region including with
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:29.640]  our allies and partners and will not in any way change how we conduct our operations as a result
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:44.200]  of this policy said colonel steven c warren of the pentagon now let me get this straight we were
[02:39:44.200 --> 02:39:54.200]  we were talking before about iran and the problems the united states had with it with the hostage
[02:39:54.200 --> 02:40:00.760]  takeover of course no one was really killed in that thing but when you go back to world war two
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:09.400]  let me get this straight these are the japanese are pro-arba oh they're our good buddies now like
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:18.360]  the vietnamese right and the germans that's right just like uh 1984 where they keep changing
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:40.200]  or where they keep changing sides listen to this what's that i can't i i can't hear it can you guys hear that
[02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:49.000]  we'll take this double crosser to the old woodshed well that's politically incorrect bottom and go to
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:57.560]  his head when we get through with him he'll wish that he was dead we gotta slap the dirty little
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:06.200]  devil there we go okay all right yeah and now today they always going on if we could be allies with
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:13.560]  japan oh not to mention you know haro shima and akasaki you know side thing you know but we have
[02:41:13.560 --> 02:41:19.320]  a big issue here with iran i don't get it yeah that's right i mean look at the look at what was
[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:25.080]  going on back then the hatred between the two countries and this was a war this is when you
[02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:30.200]  know hundreds of thousands about millions of people hundreds of thousands of united states
[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:35.400]  millions around the world were killed there was nothing like this with iran in the united states
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:43.000]  but anyway now we're their allies and this is what they said after they sent the b2s over
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:50.440]  the b52s the pentagon spokesman colonel steven warren told the media quote we've conducted
[02:41:50.440 --> 02:41:58.120]  operations in the area we have continued to follow our normal procedures which include
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:06.360]  not filing flight plans not radioing ahead and not registering our frequencies of course that's not
[02:42:06.360 --> 02:42:13.800]  provocative no and of course the chinese are provocative as well but this isn't our fight
[02:42:15.160 --> 02:42:23.480]  and that's what is so upsetting is that again here we are the united states of america built on a
[02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:29.640]  foundation from the founding fathers a constitution and a bill of rights that is totally against this
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:37.480]  kind of behavior and yet it's being broadcast and talked about in the major media as though
[02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:44.600]  we have every right to be doing this how about minding your own business how about taking care
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:52.760]  of america i got an idea fix detroit if you do that then get involved over there in china
[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:57.880]  yeah absolutely and yet what we see happening is of course this is an opportunity for the
[02:42:57.880 --> 02:43:04.120]  military industrial complex to make money with china can build up their giant navy and then we
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:10.920]  can have a new defense project where we come up with new surface to sea missiles and the military
[02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:15.800]  industrial complex is going to be very very happy about that we can even china might even loan us
[02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:21.560]  the money to go into these new defense projects right you got a good one there that's a good point
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:27.320]  yeah and again when we really talk about the chinese navy they have one aircraft carrier
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:33.400]  and it's a retrofitted ukrainian ship you know general you should be you should be very very
[02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:38.040]  afraid of that see that's what the press is telling you they're just learning how to fly
[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:45.480]  the planes on you know i mean it's a joke but if they're going to do this just as they look
[02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:52.920]  just as they use communism during the cold war now it's terrorism during the war on terror to
[02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:58.600]  keep us in fear and the next charge is going to be the chinese because here's the deal
[02:43:59.640 --> 02:44:09.400]  japan is in a lot of trouble their economy stinks arbinomics isn't working they've devalued
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:16.120]  the yen they're trying everything they can to boost their economy up when all else fails they take
[02:44:16.120 --> 02:44:27.160]  you to war go over to china same thing there they're running a massive deficit to gdp yes they have
[02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:33.000]  real problems their lending rates are going up and let me interject something right there we just
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:37.960]  had an article yesterday that was on info wars dot com and it pointed out that china is on a debt
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:41.880]  binge and a buying spree unlike anything the world has ever seen what you just said there
[02:44:41.880 --> 02:44:45.880]  in terms of talking about the massive and debt that they're incurring they said they've had
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:52.280]  an unprecedented explosion of debt they've added $15 trillion so they've added more
[02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:58.760]  in just a couple of years in the past five years they've added more debt than any country in history
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:05.080]  has so the the chinese are going into debt to the bankers as well aren't they exactly so they're
[02:45:05.080 --> 02:45:10.680]  all in you know china's biggest fear is by which not your parent of the united states it's the chinese
[02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:16.920]  people and they got you know 1.2 billion of them a lot of them start going nuts they can't handle the
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:21.240]  deal and that's what you're going to start seeing happening and there's a demographic there's a
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:26.680]  different excuse me there's a demographic component of that too as well there's a massive imbalance
[02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:31.880]  between men and women in china because of their one child policy so many families when they kept
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:37.640]  a child they've so many american families have adopted young girls from china because the families
[02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:42.680]  are giving up girls if they're the first child they're waiting for a boy so you've got this massive
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:47.640]  imbalance of male to female and if they don't give them up they have an abortion a selective
[02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:53.560]  abortion so you have a tremendous imbalance between male and female that always is a demographic
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:46:03.320]  pressure for war and that's also going on in china as well exactly and also 25 percent of the college
[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:10.200]  grads in china can't find jobs yes yes so they have their real problems going on over there
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:16.920]  kind of like here like here yeah and that's what i'm saying and by the way that the numbers that you
[02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:24.360]  you just mentioned about the chinese central bank dumping all this dough into the system this is
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:31.000]  unprecedented not only there but worldwide this is the only thing that's keeping the global economies
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:37.880]  going whether it's the qe coming out of the united states the tens of trillions of dollars that the
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:45.000]  federal reserve has pumped into the system since 2008 plus what's going on with the central banks
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:50.680]  the ecb keeping interest rates now what they're doing whether they're going to have minus interest
[02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:58.520]  rates to to boost the economy this is unprecedented which goes again it all ties together and just
[02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:05.080]  but to divert just a little bit that's why i'm still bullish on gold that this ponzi scheme is
[02:47:05.080 --> 02:47:12.360]  going to have to end at some point and when it does you're going to see gold again start is as i
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:18.120]  believe it as it's as a trend forecaster not i'm not a financial advisor i'm not telling people
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:25.160]  what to do but when you start putting all of this together this is unprecedented in world history
[02:47:25.160 --> 02:47:32.280]  where so many major countries are printing all of this paper money backed by nothing so it goes back
[02:47:32.280 --> 02:47:38.920]  to the wars again because the best way you get the people's minds off the terrible economy
[02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:44.360]  is you take them to war absolutely and that's what we've had since we've had continuous war
[02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:49.640]  since we ended world war two and of course the military industrial complex doesn't just
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:55.320]  want to build arms they actually want to use them because when those bombs are blown up they get to
[02:47:55.320 --> 02:48:00.760]  sell more bombs yeah and what they can't sell they give to the local police department that's
[02:48:01.320 --> 02:48:06.600]  that's really scary i think you can make this up who would have ever thought you know who would
[02:48:06.600 --> 02:48:13.240]  have ever thought that you have these rural and city police departments with these with these huge
[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:19.560]  trucks and armored vehicles i mean this is disgusting how about protect and serve could
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:24.600]  you handle that one i remember when i was a kid watching caught you know watching tv you know
[02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:31.800]  officer joe bolton the friendly guy on the corner you know my god how it's digressed yeah it's
[02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:37.160]  become a lot more barney fife and a lot less sheriff andy taylor hasn't it too and it's
[02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:42.040]  pretty scary to see these guys going out there i mean imagine an army full of barney fife's
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:46.040]  with the latest state-of-the-art military equipment and they've got this kind of bullying
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:51.880]  mentality that we see over and over again in police brutality cases nobody is held accountable to this
[02:48:52.680 --> 02:49:00.600]  again i'm a trend forecaster and my work is to stay on top of the current events that are
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:10.520]  forming future trends i could go back to 2003 when these soldiers started coming back from
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:19.800]  afghanistan and in 2005 when they started coming back from iraq and afghanistan after doing repeated
[02:49:19.800 --> 02:49:25.000]  tours of duty which was new by the way they used to send you once and that was it and they didn't
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:31.320]  keep sending you back that's right and coming back with a lot of mental problems whacked out on a lot
[02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:37.080]  of drugs and the warning was that they were going to go into corrections and the police
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:46.440]  oh we lost the audio there okay we lost audio there yeah he's exactly right and that's what's
[02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:53.800]  very scary is to see that these guys coming back stressed out and ptsd drugged up by the va that
[02:49:53.800 --> 02:49:59.480]  they're now going into corrections in the military is exactly what we showed from clockwork orange
[02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:03.800]  if you're familiar with that movie by uh that came up because of the interview that alex had with
[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:08.280]  vivian cubrick daughter of stanley cubrick that's a great interview if you haven't seen it look for
[02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:13.800]  that on thurson planet tv if you're a subscriber if you're not a subscriber you ought to become a
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:18.680]  subscriber hand that out to your friends and family you can give that as a gift very cheap way to
[02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:23.400]  support our operation here but you can also see that particular interview is now up on youtube it's
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:29.480]  a great interview but if you remember that movie you had this gang of thugs that went around creating
[02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:37.000]  violence rape murder beating people up one of them goes to prison his other friends his droogs as he
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:41.320]  calls them they become police officers and continue the same thing and that's exactly what gerald was
[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:44.920]  talking about we're going to get him back on the line he's going to join us in the next segment
[02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:51.320]  we're going to talk about the trans-pacific partnership this is the new comprehensive treaty
[02:50:51.320 --> 02:50:55.960]  that's being negotiated negotiating away our rights we'll be right back stay tuned

[02:54:11.960 --> 02:54:17.320]  before thanksgiving and jerry solenti has been joining us in this last hour we've got one more
[02:54:17.320 --> 02:54:22.920]  segment and we want to talk about the trans specific partnership now in the last segment we were
[02:54:22.920 --> 02:54:30.040]  talking about the build-up and forces between the us and china and japan and how ambrose evans
[02:54:30.040 --> 02:54:36.840]  pictured of the this is the telegraph said that the chinese japanese rearmament is just
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:43.080]  simply kanesian stimulus that's pretty amazing i mean i've heard many people say that you know the
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:48.200]  world war two brought us out of the great depression well if that's the case then somebody needs to
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:53.960]  reevaluate their definition of depression because once we got into the war i remember that there
[02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:58.040]  was rationing i mean i wasn't alive at that time but i know my history well enough to know that
[02:54:58.040 --> 02:55:03.880]  there was severe rationing so to me depression means ending a depression means that you start to
[02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:09.240]  end the economic privation of people and that's not what happened it actually got worse all it did
[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:13.720]  was build a giant military industrial complex that's been preying on people since then but
[02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:20.200]  jarl i want to talk to you about the trans-pacific partnership this agreement this being negotiated
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:26.440]  in secret with hundreds over 600 corporate lawyers are going in and negotiating this and
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:33.240]  our lawmakers are not allowed to even see what's in the agreement because it's now on the fast
[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:39.160]  track trade agreement what do you think about this well first of all i love the name that's a great
[02:55:39.160 --> 02:55:47.160]  it's a lovely little name isn't it trans-pacific yeah yeah partnership yeah you feel like you've
[02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:52.040]  got a piece of the action right except we're not stakeholders in this no that's a partnership well
[02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:59.320]  you're not a partner but i mean it's just you know it's i mean you said it all there's 600
[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:10.040]  corporate negotiators congress being kept in secret obama fast tracking it it's it's uh
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:19.240]  another day in what's happened to this country again i always say it four words prove that this
[02:56:19.240 --> 02:56:29.240]  is not capitalism it's fascism yes too big to fail yes and this is a perfect fascist program
[02:56:29.240 --> 02:56:39.880]  because under this new fascist partnership with asia the united states will not have any power
[02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:49.720]  in government regulations over these multinationals or trans nationals whatever you'd like to call them
[02:56:50.360 --> 02:56:58.040]  and that's what this really is they use the term globalization this isn't globalization it's
[02:56:58.040 --> 02:57:04.600]  multinationalism yes it's a multinational takeover it's elevating these corporations to the level
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:11.640]  of the government because they have these tribunals these state corporation tribunals where one of the
[02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:15.560]  arbiters is picked by the corporation one by the government and one by them mutually so they
[02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:21.080]  elevate them to the same level and then we the taxpayers have to pay if the government does
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:25.240]  something to affect the profits of these multinational corporations it's absolutely amazing
[02:57:25.240 --> 02:57:29.640]  you pointed it out exactly it is exactly fascism it's not socialism and that's what we've been
[02:57:29.640 --> 02:57:35.480]  seeing from obama all the way along through this administration yes and and again i would just
[02:57:36.280 --> 02:57:42.920]  i wouldn't say that it's the government and the multinationals making the decisions they're one
[02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:49.320]  yes the same thing exactly these guys are only the the politicians are only wise guys for the
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:54.520]  multinational mafia exactly they're just little they're just those they're just little spokespeople
[02:57:54.520 --> 02:57:58.840]  you buy them off with campaign contributions and a little of this a little of that give them a free
[02:57:58.840 --> 02:58:04.360]  ride here give them a vacation there and they're happy i mean so that it's only it's only the
[02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:12.120]  multinationals that are in charge whether it's in the manufacturing in the or the banking whether
[02:58:12.120 --> 02:58:19.560]  it's in agriculture or pharmaceutical whether it's in it's going to give the bankers exactly what
[02:58:19.560 --> 02:58:24.760]  they want big pharma exactly what they want is obama care extended to all aspects of our life
