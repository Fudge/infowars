[02:15.880 --> 02:24.600]  towards the nation secretary of state Hillary Clinton said last night warned
[02:24.600 --> 02:28.560]  that North Korea that fired a missile for any purpose would be a provocative
[02:28.560 --> 02:33.840]  act that would have consequences North Korea is loading a rocket on a launch
[02:33.840 --> 02:36.920]  pad anticipation the launch of the communication satellite between April
[02:36.920 --> 02:40.480]  4th and the 8th US counter proliferation intelligence officials said North
[02:40.480 --> 02:44.360]  Korea announced its intention to launch the satellite in February but regional
[02:44.360 --> 02:47.520]  powers worry the claim is a cover for the launch of a long-range missile
[02:47.520 --> 02:51.800]  capable of reaching Alaska fact I meant to Google this this morning to print the
[02:51.800 --> 02:57.560]  old article but so I would have it was in mainstream news but didn't get a lot
[02:57.560 --> 03:02.880]  of attention that Google this for me North Korean test missile hits Alaska
[03:02.880 --> 03:08.520]  North Korean missile hits Alaska and it was a ICBM test it didn't have a war
[03:08.520 --> 03:15.800]  head and it hit the barren waste of Alaska but they didn't want that to be a
[03:15.800 --> 03:20.000]  big news issue in 2001 because they were already busy hyping how deadly Saddam
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.440]  was and how he had to be invaded an attack because he supposedly had missiles
[03:23.440 --> 03:29.480]  and nukes and everything else so we'll be getting into that report huge news
[03:29.480 --> 03:36.920]  huge development on the whole FEMA camp collapse of society front Bloomberg
[03:36.920 --> 03:43.360]  reports Schwarzenegger opens California fairgrounds to homeless camp
[03:43.360 --> 03:48.000]  California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said a makeshift tense city for the
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.840]  homeless that sprang up in the capital city of Sacramento will be shut down
[03:51.840 --> 03:56.400]  that's a huge precedent oh you're homeless we're not gonna let you live on
[03:56.400 --> 04:02.160]  the park grounds and its residents allowed to stay at the state fairgrounds
[04:02.160 --> 04:07.200]  so this is very serious this sets the precedent where they say okay you can't
[04:07.200 --> 04:12.240]  live in a tent now we're gonna make you go to a fenced-in area with police and
[04:12.240 --> 04:16.720]  basically be prisoners like the Superdome in New Orleans and this is gonna
[04:16.720 --> 04:21.360]  be done statewide other states are moving in the same direction and so this
[04:21.360 --> 04:24.160]  means you're gonna be institutionalized if you're homeless and here's the issue
[04:24.160 --> 04:29.600]  middle-class people and working-class folks living on the edge of poverty the
[04:29.600 --> 04:34.480]  working poor are losing their houses losing their homes they're trying most
[04:34.480 --> 04:37.840]  of them to live in their cars to raise enough money to get you know the down
[04:37.840 --> 04:43.680]  payment the two months rent to move into an apartment the deposit we've talked to
[04:43.680 --> 04:48.400]  a lot of them the media has they're gonna be made to go stay in a fenced-in
[04:48.400 --> 04:53.520]  facility with the crackheads with the heroin heads with the crazies who have
[04:53.520 --> 04:57.080]  been dumped out of the mental institutions so this is the start of the
[04:57.080 --> 05:03.680]  FEMA camp stay with us more than 700 chemicals have been found in our
[05:03.680 --> 05:07.280]  drinking water and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[05:07.280 --> 05:10.800]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water that's because many
[05:10.800 --> 05:14.280]  chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the
[05:14.280 --> 05:18.960]  skin the KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and
[05:18.960 --> 05:23.440]  it's designed to reduce chlorine lead mercury and iron and it inhibits the

[09:42.640 --> 09:47.480]  prisoner Senate reviewing how college football picks number one so we have all
[09:47.480 --> 09:50.520]  the serious news going on they're spending their time on how the
[09:50.520 --> 09:55.440]  championship is decided it's associated press two-faced Geithner assures CFR
[09:55.440 --> 10:02.000]  puppet masters he's open to global currency Pentagon exploring robot killers
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.560]  that can fire on their own McClatchy news close to home press Democrat reports
[10:09.560 --> 10:14.440]  how can volunteerism in America be mandatory we got some good news there
[10:14.440 --> 10:19.160]  you know we we break the stuff as it develops two days ago that they had
[10:19.160 --> 10:23.760]  compulsory national service in both versions of the bill then they dropped
[10:23.760 --> 10:27.880]  one of the two provisions out of the Senate bill and the latest copy I read
[10:27.880 --> 10:32.400]  this morning they have now taken it out of the Senate version but it's still in
[10:32.400 --> 10:36.480]  the House version there's five different compulsory service bills in the house
[10:36.480 --> 10:39.480]  three different ones that we know of and we're not omnipresent folks we're
[10:39.480 --> 10:42.840]  trying to keep track of all of this with everything else we got too many balls in
[10:42.840 --> 10:47.360]  the air so that is good news but the point is they're trying to sneak
[10:47.360 --> 10:51.520]  compulsory service through and they're keeping the language in some of the
[10:51.520 --> 10:56.560]  house versions about setting up a new federal agency to prepare for compulsory
[10:56.560 --> 11:02.000]  service so they are certainly trying it ladies and gentlemen a disgusting
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.440]  headline of the mail newspaper out of England I'm having a very good crisis as
[11:06.440 --> 11:10.440]  Soros as hedge fund managers make billions off the session yeah I saw a
[11:10.440 --> 11:14.760]  report yesterday the top ten hedge fund members one made three billion one made
[11:14.760 --> 11:18.200]  two and a half billion the others made two billion a billion and a half that's
[11:18.200 --> 11:23.720]  individually not the hedge funds the individuals who are managing portfolios
[11:23.720 --> 11:29.160]  that's their percentage of the profit manipulating different areas of the stock
[11:29.160 --> 11:34.360]  market in commodities and oil and other things so that's a disgusting quote from
[11:34.360 --> 11:37.640]  him I'll get into more of what he said it's the it's the culmination of his
[11:37.640 --> 11:41.160]  life's work that's a quote that's just wonderful to do this he just loves
[11:41.160 --> 11:46.440]  doing this he's one of the guys behind Obama so we'll be getting into that
[11:46.440 --> 11:55.280]  report as well we got contacted a couple days ago that the head of the John
[11:55.280 --> 12:00.800]  Burt society the president of the John Burt society is in Texas on a tour when
[12:00.800 --> 12:05.120]  Houston and San Antonio and Dallas in places and that he'd be happy to be
[12:05.120 --> 12:09.400]  interviewed so we've got him coming into studio in about 45 minutes he's
[12:09.400 --> 12:14.520]  scheduled to be here so that should be an interesting interview that is coming
[12:14.520 --> 12:23.600]  up today now and by the way we're gonna go live at prison planet dot TV when
[12:23.600 --> 12:27.760]  he's in studio with us we'll go live not in the we won't start in the third and
[12:27.760 --> 12:31.920]  fourth hour we're gonna go ahead and do three hours today at prison planet dot

[12:49.800 --> 12:53.520]  truth rising all of my films a whole bunch of other films we've been
[12:53.520 --> 12:57.760]  authorized to post hundreds and hundreds of my in studio interviews expanded

[13:14.520 --> 13:16.880]  genesis
[13:18.920 --> 13:24.160]  okay let me get into the top story today no it's not a US fleet steaming towards
[13:24.160 --> 13:29.280]  North Korea that is important we'll get into it but domestically how many times
[13:29.280 --> 13:36.640]  in the last decade did I describe how they would roll out FEMA camps they
[13:36.640 --> 13:43.720]  would say that they were for economic collapse and for housing people and then
[13:43.720 --> 13:46.480]  we saw in New Orleans when they went into high and dry areas not just in the
[13:46.480 --> 13:50.480]  city but all over that state confiscating firearms from people's homes
[13:50.480 --> 13:54.160]  that were high and dry and had generators everything and then putting
[13:54.160 --> 13:59.640]  people in the crime ridden Superdome they made people go to the Superdome
[13:59.640 --> 14:04.560]  where all of the drug dealers the criminals the rapist and the last 20
[14:04.560 --> 14:11.160]  years they've kicked most of the mentally ill people out of state hospitals and so
[14:11.160 --> 14:14.400]  they're all in there as well so your family can't stay in your house you've
[14:14.400 --> 14:18.920]  got to go there and then you have the gun confiscation going on so we know how
[14:18.920 --> 14:23.480]  the feds operate I've been telling you that as the tent cities pop up in Texas
[14:23.480 --> 14:28.720]  and Michigan and New York and Florida and California and Oregon and Arizona and
[14:28.720 --> 14:34.360]  Nevada tent cities everywhere as these Obama bills as Webster Tarpley calls
[14:34.360 --> 14:38.920]  them pop up everywhere that the key would be when they said okay you can't go out
[14:38.920 --> 14:41.920]  on government land you can't go out on the national park you can't go out on
[14:41.920 --> 14:46.480]  the edge of a city park where they could just bring in porta-potties we're going
[14:46.480 --> 14:54.080]  to make you go to sports stadiums and go to fairgrounds and one of the guys that
[14:54.080 --> 14:59.560]  works here in the office lived in a Sacramento and he says the fairgrounds
[14:59.560 --> 15:03.960]  is you know the barbed wire facing in and out it's a perfect female can't
[15:03.960 --> 15:09.640]  remember late last year in several states female had drills at the stock
[15:09.640 --> 15:13.840]  yards around the country in fairgrounds of rounding people up and putting them
[15:13.840 --> 15:17.520]  in there and doing force inoculations on things that's what's now happening
[15:17.520 --> 15:21.120]  they're saying you can't go out and pitch a tent you can't go out and live out
[15:21.120 --> 15:24.840]  of your car and the people are trying to raise money while they do that they're
[15:24.840 --> 15:29.640]  working jobs this is the working poor the these aren't the classic alcoholic or
[15:29.640 --> 15:35.240]  drug addict or person who's mentally ill you're now seeing even here in Austin
[15:35.240 --> 15:39.720]  good-looking families out begging for money you're seeing you know people that
[15:39.720 --> 15:45.280]  you know don't fit the mold of the hobo that are doing this and what's not the
[15:45.280 --> 15:52.400]  you know the poor shell-shocked PTSD Vietnam vets and all over the nation
[15:52.400 --> 15:57.320]  they tell them you can't sleep on a park bench you can't sleep you know under a
[15:57.320 --> 16:02.520]  bridge and then the homeless shelters are full so at night in Austin Texas a
[16:02.520 --> 16:06.320]  couple years ago you might see two or three people sleeping out front the
[16:06.320 --> 16:10.160]  four different homeless shelters just in downtown you'll see shots of this the
[16:10.160 --> 16:13.480]  Obama deception you go down there at night now in front of these and there
[16:13.480 --> 16:19.040]  might be as many as 60 70 80 a hundred and that'll just be out front under the
[16:19.040 --> 16:22.240]  street lamps you go around the back they're sleeping behind dumpsters they're
[16:22.240 --> 16:26.360]  everywhere and believe me these folks are in nasty moods they're not drunk
[16:26.360 --> 16:34.160]  they're not on drugs it is it is just absolutely scary and remember what
[16:34.160 --> 16:37.560]  major universities came out with in the last few months seven million people
[16:37.560 --> 16:42.240]  during the ten-year depression starved the death of this country and that was
[16:42.240 --> 16:48.800]  with 90% of Americans at the time of the depression living on farms living in
[16:48.800 --> 16:52.720]  the country being quote self-sufficient but the banks called in the loans they
[16:52.720 --> 16:58.320]  said oh you own oh $20,000 on your family farm you got to pay it all today oh
[16:58.320 --> 17:02.080]  you owe $3,000 on your family farm which was equivalent of hundreds of
[17:02.080 --> 17:08.600]  thousands you got to pay it now it's due and from Oklahoma Texas Iowa and all
[17:08.600 --> 17:13.400]  over the country they had to go west and their cars broke down they starved to
[17:13.400 --> 17:17.320]  death they literally set up slave camps you watch the movie the grapes of wrath
[17:17.320 --> 17:22.120]  you know where they're basically slaves that's far far better than what the
[17:22.120 --> 17:30.160]  reality was now we have 90% who are not self-sufficient 10% living on farms and
[17:30.160 --> 17:35.160]  only half of that 10% being self-sufficient so 5% total or self-sufficient
[17:35.160 --> 17:41.200]  10% living on farms so you have 10% living on farms or ranches but only half
[17:41.200 --> 17:44.880]  of those are self-sufficient that's 5% of the country instead of 90% being
[17:44.880 --> 17:48.480]  self-sufficient this is about domestication this is about control this
[17:48.480 --> 17:53.080]  is this highly organized and manipulated society this is the crises they bring in
[17:53.080 --> 17:56.400]  in third world nations and old world nations IMF World Bank documents by
[17:56.400 --> 18:02.440]  design to reorganize society this is a literal military attack financially and

[19:39.040 --> 19:43.800]  california governor said make shift in city for the homeless that sprung up in
[19:43.800 --> 19:47.640]  the capital city of sacramento will be shut down and his residents allowed to
[19:47.640 --> 19:52.600]  stay at the state fairgrounds he ordered the state facility on his cowl expo to
[19:52.600 --> 19:56.720]  be used for three months to serve 125 tent city residents then they'll move
[19:56.720 --> 19:59.960]  them somewhere else stay with us

[20:10.400 --> 20:15.040]  didn't make it and millions ended up in soup lines becoming vagrants begging

[20:21.400 --> 20:25.640]  right now we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into
[20:25.640 --> 20:30.160]  our homes before it's too late too late why is the canadian government telling

[33:42.680 --> 33:46.680]  they said they wanted the 3 minute quote for their news and then it went longer
[33:46.680 --> 33:48.680]  so I had to run that music earlier
[33:48.680 --> 33:52.680]  I did an hour interview on a syndicated african-american show out of Maryland
[33:52.680 --> 33:56.680]  that's on all over the country, the Valentine's show, the truth seeker

[34:01.680 --> 34:06.680]  I'm turning down most of the interviews because I just can't even operate or see my family

[34:13.680 --> 34:16.680]  so many people are reaching out to us, the word is spreading

[34:22.680 --> 34:24.680]  and prisonplanet.com
[34:24.680 --> 34:29.680]  we are really breaking out at an even higher plateau now
[34:29.680 --> 34:33.680]  so please keep spreading the word about the radio show
[34:33.680 --> 34:37.680]  we've got the president of the John Birch Society and studio
[34:37.680 --> 34:44.680]  then we've got Patrice O'Neill on the show as well
[34:44.680 --> 34:48.680]  a well-known comedian does shows on VH1 MTV, you name it
[34:48.680 --> 34:52.680]  he's been going on national radio shows and plugging and talking about the Obama deception
[34:52.680 --> 34:56.680]  when I opened Anthony, it's the fourth biggest shock jock show in the country
[34:56.680 --> 35:01.680]  and for an hour talked about the Obama deception and got them to watch it
[35:01.680 --> 35:06.680]  I mean so that's really interesting when I get his take on what is happening
[35:06.680 --> 35:10.680]  as well today
[35:10.680 --> 35:12.680]  there is so much going on
[35:12.680 --> 35:14.680]  I said I was going to go to your calls, we've got all these guests coming up
[35:14.680 --> 35:16.680]  so I want to go ahead and do that here
[35:16.680 --> 35:19.680]  in a moment for Eric and Patrick and Joshua and John and Brent
[35:19.680 --> 35:26.680]  but let me finish up with our top stories quickly and then I'm going to go right to you
[35:26.680 --> 35:31.680]  just trying to multitask here and catch my breath
[35:31.680 --> 35:37.680]  we're also planning the trips and the guys, two of the guys Rob and Rob do
[35:37.680 --> 35:44.680]  and Jason Douglas to California to cover how they're forcing people out of the makeshift cities
[35:44.680 --> 35:48.680]  into the FEMA camp, FEMA camps with the NAS
[35:48.680 --> 35:51.680]  so let me go ahead and cover that now and then I'll go to your calls
[35:51.680 --> 35:53.680]  let's get to the other news later
[35:53.680 --> 35:58.680]  Bloomberg, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said a makeshift tent city for homeless
[35:58.680 --> 36:01.680]  that sprang up in the capital city of Sacramento will be shut down
[36:01.680 --> 36:05.680]  as its residents allowed to stay at the state fairgrounds
[36:05.680 --> 36:08.680]  oh how nice of them, see how they phrase it, this is a nice thing
[36:08.680 --> 36:13.680]  Schwarzenegger said he ordered the state facility known as Cal Expo to be used for three months
[36:13.680 --> 36:17.680]  to serve the 125 tent city residents, it's more than that
[36:17.680 --> 36:20.680]  there's four tent cities in Sacramento alone
[36:20.680 --> 36:24.680]  some of them displaced by the economic recession, the media tries to play this down
[36:24.680 --> 36:29.680]  the campment may be shut down in a month since Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson
[36:29.680 --> 36:35.680]  the move comes after the Sacramento City Council last night agreed to spend $880,000 to expand homeless programs
[36:35.680 --> 36:37.680]  so that's a lot of that's federal funds
[36:37.680 --> 36:44.680]  together with the local government and volunteers we are taking a first step to ensure that people living in a tent city have a safe place to stay
[36:44.680 --> 36:48.680]  with fresh water, healthy conditions and access to services they need
[36:48.680 --> 36:50.680]  like CPS kidnapping their children
[36:50.680 --> 36:54.680]  Schwarzenegger went on to say
[36:54.680 --> 36:59.680]  and I am committed to working with Mayor Johnson to find a permanent solution for those living in the tent city
[36:59.680 --> 37:04.680]  California home to one of every eight, one in every eight Americans
[37:04.680 --> 37:10.680]  has been particularly hard hit by the housing market collapse after many residents turned to exotic mortgages to afford homes
[37:10.680 --> 37:15.680]  the tent city which has long existed along the banks of the American River
[37:15.680 --> 37:19.680]  gained national attention last month when some of its recently homeless residents
[37:19.680 --> 37:21.680]  featured on the Oprah Winfrey show
[37:21.680 --> 37:26.680]  the state has one of the highest rates of foreclosure according to RealtyTrack Inc
[37:26.680 --> 37:29.680]  an Irvine California based seller of real estate data
[37:29.680 --> 37:33.680]  California home prices dropped 41% last month from a year earlier
[37:33.680 --> 37:37.680]  more than double the U.S. decline as surging foreclosures drove down home values
[37:37.680 --> 37:40.680]  the state association of realtors said
[37:40.680 --> 37:45.680]  state unemployment is at 10.5% in February and that's a cook number it's more like 20
[37:45.680 --> 37:49.680]  destructions financial and manufacturing companies eliminated jobs
[37:49.680 --> 37:53.680]  leaving the most populous U.S. state with one of the nation's
[37:53.680 --> 37:59.680]  worst job markets but don't worry the 8 million illegal aliens that live in California alone they're doing great
[37:59.680 --> 38:03.680]  the shelter at Cal Expo currently houses about 150 people
[38:03.680 --> 38:08.680]  it will be expanded by another 50 beds and will include facilities for families with children
[38:08.680 --> 38:12.680]  so CPS will grab some of these children
[38:12.680 --> 38:15.680]  and be guaranteed of that
[38:15.680 --> 38:20.680]  unless we get the word out and stop them so how did I tell you they'd introduce this as the years ago
[38:20.680 --> 38:24.680]  as the economy collapses oh we're going to put people in the Expo center
[38:24.680 --> 38:27.680]  and it's got barbed wire fence around it
[38:27.680 --> 38:32.680]  and inside the facility they will now force the nice families that are living out by themselves
[38:32.680 --> 38:36.680]  in communities together raising enough money most of them end up getting out in a few months
[38:36.680 --> 38:41.680]  they just sit there living their cars camp out with their tents raise the money they need
[38:41.680 --> 38:43.680]  and move on
[38:43.680 --> 38:45.680]  no
[38:45.680 --> 38:47.680]  no
[38:47.680 --> 38:51.680]  you are going to be harassed you are going to be controlled you are going to be surveilled
[38:51.680 --> 38:55.680]  you are going to be with the crack heads and the heroin heads and the mentally ill people
[38:55.680 --> 38:59.680]  that make up the predominant portion of the homeless
[38:59.680 --> 39:04.680]  and you are going to be in the Expo center living in tents
[39:04.680 --> 39:09.680]  and there will be police there and there will be checkpoints to get it in and out that's how they always do this
[39:09.680 --> 39:13.680]  and it will be advertised as the government camp and this will sell the population
[39:13.680 --> 39:17.680]  they are setting up other camps across the country and they've built FEMA camps
[39:17.680 --> 39:21.680]  as the collapse accelerates so this is big big news
[39:21.680 --> 39:24.680]  and I hope some of the callers I'm about to go to want to comment on this
[39:24.680 --> 39:26.680]  will continue to discuss it throughout the broadcast
[39:26.680 --> 39:31.680]  but forcing them the precedent here is you are not going to stay in your car
[39:31.680 --> 39:33.680]  you are not going to stay in a tent
[39:33.680 --> 39:34.680]  no
[39:34.680 --> 39:38.680]  no you are homeless you are going to go to a government facility
[39:38.680 --> 39:42.680]  you are going to be harassed and arrested or pushed into this
[39:42.680 --> 39:49.680]  and then the social services are going to piratically feed on you
[39:49.680 --> 39:52.680]  this is outrageous
[39:52.680 --> 39:57.680]  let's go ahead and go to Eric in California Eric you are on the air
[39:57.680 --> 39:59.680]  how are you doing Alex
[39:59.680 --> 40:04.680]  hey Eric how many times have you heard me talk about how they would force people into these facilities
[40:04.680 --> 40:09.680]  oh man you've been talking about it forever and chickens are coming home to roost
[40:09.680 --> 40:12.680]  I tell you what
[40:12.680 --> 40:17.680]  you know I'm here in California and I'm in the building trade
[40:17.680 --> 40:23.680]  and the last six months I've had to cut my wages in half while everything else goes up
[40:23.680 --> 40:26.680]  services go down taxes go up
[40:26.680 --> 40:29.680]  well Swartz and anger whose father was an SS officer
[40:29.680 --> 40:31.680]  a political officer arresting people
[40:31.680 --> 40:35.680]  don't worry he's got a camp for you
[40:35.680 --> 40:38.680]  yeah well I will refrain from there
[40:38.680 --> 40:40.680]  hey Alex I've been trying to get on for a while
[40:40.680 --> 40:45.680]  I know I call a lot but I've got some things that are on my chest here
[40:45.680 --> 40:48.680]  first one concerning the Obama deception
[40:48.680 --> 40:54.680]  and copying it I recently purchased from an eBay seller
[40:54.680 --> 40:57.680]  a 1-3 duplicator
[40:57.680 --> 41:01.680]  and it was suggested to me that I get it from another gentleman but
[41:01.680 --> 41:03.680]  if anybody would like to get one
[41:03.680 --> 41:11.680]  you can find it at mega links that's M-E-G-A-L-Y-N-X links mega links
[41:11.680 --> 41:15.680]  it's a 1-3 duplicator for 197 bucks
[41:15.680 --> 41:21.680]  there's a lot of great units double duplicators triple quadruple duplicators 10 duplicators
[41:21.680 --> 41:24.680]  and you can just pop the original high quality disk in
[41:24.680 --> 41:28.680]  pop the dummies in and I'm glad you're doing okay financially enough people to do that
[41:28.680 --> 41:32.680]  I appreciate it that is how we're going to turn things around
[41:32.680 --> 41:37.680]  I got some help from a 9-11 DVD project guy Tom Tavitin
[41:37.680 --> 41:46.680]  anyhow my business idea that I have recently concerns victory gardens
[41:46.680 --> 41:49.680]  however I'd like to start calling them Liberty Gardens
[41:49.680 --> 41:51.680]  I don't know if they're allowed to do that though
[41:51.680 --> 41:54.680]  they've got a bill that would basically make you get a license to have a garden
[41:54.680 --> 41:59.680]  and a lot of city officials from California to Oregon to Oklahoma say
[41:59.680 --> 42:02.680]  maybe you can't be allowed without an inspection maybe you're growing pot
[42:02.680 --> 42:05.680]  a prisoner isn't allowed to grow their own food
[42:05.680 --> 42:07.680]  you think this is a free country pal?
[42:07.680 --> 42:12.680]  hey Alex don't you try to grow a garden buddy are you with al-qaeda?
[42:12.680 --> 42:15.680]  listen this is the remedy
[42:15.680 --> 42:20.680]  if enough people are starting victory gardens and they get a taste of good organic tasteful food
[42:20.680 --> 42:22.680]  maybe they'll start doing it
[42:22.680 --> 42:27.680]  and more people will be exposed to the crimes of Monsanto and how they're pushing this
[42:27.680 --> 42:31.680]  I agree we should call them Liberty Gardens just like they were in World War II
[42:31.680 --> 42:36.680]  and don't let the police intimidation stop you from growing a garden
[42:36.680 --> 42:41.680]  you're allowed to you're an American we're not extremists for having gardens
[42:41.680 --> 42:45.680]  absolutely and also I've been meaning to ask you about this
[42:45.680 --> 42:48.680]  what is your what is your take on Lyndon LaRouche
[42:48.680 --> 42:51.680]  because when I was up in San Francisco recently
[42:51.680 --> 42:57.680]  I ran into some of his guys and I talked to them and they gave me a bunch of material from them
[42:57.680 --> 43:00.680]  and since then they've been hounding me for donations
[43:00.680 --> 43:04.680]  yeah that's been my experience I appreciate your call Eric
[43:04.680 --> 43:09.680]  one time they air their national show here locally
[43:09.680 --> 43:13.680]  and they said call and get a free copy of their newspaper
[43:13.680 --> 43:16.680]  and then they just hounded me for donations
[43:16.680 --> 43:19.680]  and I didn't like that
[43:19.680 --> 43:24.680]  and overall I agree with about 90% of their analysis of the Anglo-American establishment
[43:24.680 --> 43:26.680]  how it works
[43:26.680 --> 43:29.680]  but then there's solutions I disagree with
[43:29.680 --> 43:34.680]  and Webster Tarbley worked with them some and he says it's bad news
[43:34.680 --> 43:38.680]  I'm not trying to attack the LaRouche supporters
[43:38.680 --> 43:40.680]  a lot of good people in there
[43:40.680 --> 43:46.680]  but I don't endorse little LaRouche really
[43:46.680 --> 43:48.680]  but I'm not trying to pick a fight here
[43:48.680 --> 43:50.680]  you just asked the question I told you
[43:50.680 --> 43:53.680]  Patrick in Toronto you're on the air Patrick
[43:53.680 --> 43:56.680]  how you doing from the great white north brother
[43:56.680 --> 43:58.680]  hello sir I hope you're not planning on growing a garden
[43:58.680 --> 44:01.680]  me no gardens why would I want to do that
[44:01.680 --> 44:03.680]  you're a good good good good
[44:03.680 --> 44:07.680]  anyhow I'm just calling from Toronto just wanted to
[44:07.680 --> 44:11.680]  share my enthusiasm and my excitement for the Obama deception
[44:11.680 --> 44:14.680]  just wanted to give some of the Canadian listeners a heads up
[44:14.680 --> 44:18.680]  I checked the UPS shipping delivery schedule
[44:18.680 --> 44:20.680]  and I'm getting my box today
[44:20.680 --> 44:23.680]  and I hope anyone in Toronto that's interested in picking up a copy
[44:23.680 --> 44:25.680]  can come by here and grab theirs
[44:25.680 --> 44:27.680]  because I think I've got a hundred on their way today
[44:27.680 --> 44:29.680]  and that's just my first order
[44:29.680 --> 44:31.680]  so I just anybody in Toronto
[44:31.680 --> 44:33.680]  if you're looking for the Obama deception
[44:33.680 --> 44:35.680]  conspiracy culture we got it
[44:35.680 --> 44:38.680]  that's right you guys carry our books and films there
[44:38.680 --> 44:42.680]  and we really really appreciate you doing anything else Patrick
[44:42.680 --> 44:46.680]  no I'm just I'm slowly putting things together
[44:46.680 --> 44:48.680]  we might be doing a screening of it in May
[44:48.680 --> 44:51.680]  depending on whether or not I can get access to a local theatre
[44:51.680 --> 44:53.680]  but even if I can't get the place I'm looking for
[44:53.680 --> 44:56.680]  I'm most likely going to be doing a screening here in Toronto
[44:56.680 --> 44:59.680]  and see what I can do about getting some of the
[44:59.680 --> 45:02.680]  Obama followers to maybe consider
[45:02.680 --> 45:05.680]  opening up to some alternative information that maybe change
[45:05.680 --> 45:08.680]  their perception on who this guy actually is
[45:09.680 --> 45:13.680]  well some of the invincibility and the godlikeness
[45:13.680 --> 45:14.680]  is starting to wear off
[45:14.680 --> 45:18.680]  I was on a big national African-American talk show this morning
[45:18.680 --> 45:22.680]  and he said no I know most of what you know is in your film is true
[45:22.680 --> 45:25.680]  I checked it out but you know Obama himself isn't bad
[45:25.680 --> 45:28.680]  you know he has to put out rhetoric when he's running
[45:28.680 --> 45:30.680]  and I said no no this was change
[45:30.680 --> 45:32.680]  he said no more business as usual
[45:32.680 --> 45:35.680]  this time it's really going to be different
[45:35.680 --> 45:40.680]  and I tried to explain this isn't about Obama
[45:40.680 --> 45:43.680]  it's about who runs the government the big banks
[45:43.680 --> 45:47.680]  but see by tying Obama to the globalist agenda
[45:47.680 --> 45:49.680]  the guy was still halfway supporting their agenda
[45:49.680 --> 45:51.680]  even though he knows the truth in his gut
[45:51.680 --> 45:56.680]  because he identifies his entire personality
[45:56.680 --> 45:58.680]  his entire world view
[45:58.680 --> 46:00.680]  his identity with Obama
[46:00.680 --> 46:01.680]  good to hear from you Patrick
[46:01.680 --> 46:03.680]  appreciate your support getting the Obama deception
[46:03.680 --> 46:05.680]  conspiracy culture there in Toronto
[46:05.680 --> 46:07.680]  Joshua in Florida you're on the air
[46:07.680 --> 46:09.680]  Alex Jones how you doing my friend
[46:09.680 --> 46:11.680]  good sir
[46:11.680 --> 46:14.680]  fantastic I have some news as well with the Obama deception
[46:14.680 --> 46:16.680]  great film great film
[46:16.680 --> 46:20.680]  I think it's pretty much the gateway documentary to get
[46:20.680 --> 46:23.680]  the sheeple into the mix of the new order
[46:23.680 --> 46:24.680]  good way to put it
[46:24.680 --> 46:28.680]  it is made for people that don't know about the new world order
[46:28.680 --> 46:31.680]  it's made to shatter the left-right paradigm
[46:31.680 --> 46:35.680]  yeah absolutely we went to the Orlando Tea Party last week
[46:35.680 --> 46:38.680]  and we were able to give out about 500 copies
[46:38.680 --> 46:41.680]  to the people there the high-quality copies
[46:41.680 --> 46:44.680]  and we're going to go there having an anti-war rally
[46:44.680 --> 46:45.680]  in Melbourne this weekend
[46:45.680 --> 46:47.680]  we're going to go out there
[46:47.680 --> 46:49.680]  I got about 500 copies printed up
[46:49.680 --> 46:51.680]  we're going to give them out there
[46:51.680 --> 46:55.680]  and I had an idea for like a
[46:55.680 --> 46:58.680]  guerrilla information warfare tactics
[46:58.680 --> 47:01.680]  I think we should do like a nationwide
[47:01.680 --> 47:04.680]  call in campaign
[47:04.680 --> 47:06.680]  possibly call in on the Glenn Beck show
[47:06.680 --> 47:08.680]  if I get all of your listeners
[47:08.680 --> 47:11.680]  you all start calling in every week on Glenn Beck
[47:11.680 --> 47:13.680]  on Rush Limbaugh and plug a
[47:13.680 --> 47:16.680]  absolutely and call local shows
[47:16.680 --> 47:18.680]  and say there's a new film exposing Obama
[47:18.680 --> 47:21.680]  and the bankers and what they're really planning
[47:21.680 --> 47:23.680]  it exposes that Bush is working with them as well
[47:23.680 --> 47:25.680]  you know so it's not a left-right issue
[47:25.680 --> 47:27.680]  and just say the Obama deception
[47:27.680 --> 47:29.680]  free at YouTube, free at Google
[47:29.680 --> 47:31.680]  the Obama deception, the Obama deception
[47:31.680 --> 47:34.680]  and just get it out to people
[47:34.680 --> 47:37.680]  yeah absolutely I have in front of me Glenn Beck's
[47:37.680 --> 47:41.680]  radio calling phone number if you want me to throw that out real quick
[47:41.680 --> 47:42.680]  is that cool?
[47:42.680 --> 47:44.680]  sir go ahead
[47:44.680 --> 47:49.680]  that's 1-888-727-2325
[47:49.680 --> 47:52.680]  it shows us from 9 a.m. to noon
[47:52.680 --> 47:54.680]  Eastern Standard Time
[47:54.680 --> 47:57.680]  and I want to encourage anybody in Florida
[47:57.680 --> 48:00.680]  to check us out at www.meadup.com
[48:00.680 --> 48:03.680]  backslash or Lando 911 Truth
[48:03.680 --> 48:05.680]  we're getting pretty active we're waking up
[48:05.680 --> 48:07.680]  all kind of people here in Florida
[48:07.680 --> 48:09.680]  and we just encourage all the other groups
[48:09.680 --> 48:11.680]  to get active, get aggressive man
[48:11.680 --> 48:13.680]  this is crunch time we really have to get on the ball ladies and gentlemen
[48:13.680 --> 48:15.680]  Joshua what feedback
[48:15.680 --> 48:17.680]  because you're very aggressive in what you're doing
[48:17.680 --> 48:20.680]  God bless you I salute you you're a true info warrior
[48:20.680 --> 48:24.680]  what feedback are you getting from those that have seen the Obama deception?
[48:24.680 --> 48:28.680]  it's pretty amazing everyone that has watched it has said
[48:28.680 --> 48:32.680]  wow that's just mind-blowing and they always want to know what else
[48:32.680 --> 48:35.680]  they come to find out where to go next
[48:35.680 --> 48:37.680]  always send them to Endgame
[48:37.680 --> 48:39.680]  send them to loose change Final Cut
[48:39.680 --> 48:41.680]  send them to 9-11 Mysteries
[48:41.680 --> 48:44.680]  and it's just a new renaissance
[48:44.680 --> 48:46.680]  just like you said in the film man
[48:46.680 --> 48:49.680]  it's really exploding here in Orlando especially
[48:49.680 --> 48:51.680]  and it's just encouraging
[48:51.680 --> 48:53.680]  like especially at the Tea Party
[48:53.680 --> 48:55.680]  there were over 5,000 people at the Tea Party
[48:55.680 --> 48:59.680]  I was encouraged to see about 500 of the Don't Tread on Me flags
[48:59.680 --> 49:02.680]  everywhere and I had copies of the Mayak report
[49:02.680 --> 49:04.680]  every person I saw with the flag
[49:04.680 --> 49:06.680]  we were running them down telling them they were terrorists
[49:06.680 --> 49:08.680]  for having the flag and educating them
[49:08.680 --> 49:10.680]  and people were getting angry man
[49:10.680 --> 49:12.680]  and the Glimbeck
[49:12.680 --> 49:15.680]  even if he's part of some type of a controlled opposition
[49:15.680 --> 49:17.680]  it's a dangerous move by the elites
[49:17.680 --> 49:20.680]  because the audience is awake to the point to where
[49:20.680 --> 49:24.680]  if we can really infiltrate these Tea Parties
[49:24.680 --> 49:27.680]  and show them a true oligarchy
[49:27.680 --> 49:29.680]  exposed to Federal Reserve
[49:29.680 --> 49:32.680]  we can really unlock their minds because this is 5,000
[49:32.680 --> 49:35.680]  angry Americans who are ready for a revolution
[49:35.680 --> 49:37.680]  and we need to really do this way and guide them
[49:37.680 --> 49:41.680]  I had 100,000 of you Joshua that were as aggressive
[49:41.680 --> 49:43.680]  in prosecuting this war against tyranny
[49:43.680 --> 49:47.680]  we would win this thing literally in a matter of months
[49:47.680 --> 49:49.680]  and I know we have millions of listeners
[49:49.680 --> 49:51.680]  so folks get aggressive
[49:51.680 --> 49:53.680]  do exactly what he's saying
[49:53.680 --> 49:55.680]  that is exactly what is needed
[49:55.680 --> 49:58.680]  people always want to make resisting so complex
[49:58.680 --> 50:00.680]  they want to have 6 months of planning
[50:00.680 --> 50:02.680]  and get all paranoid about it
[50:02.680 --> 50:04.680]  just get out there, start getting the word out
[50:04.680 --> 50:07.680]  get aggressive with the globalist
[50:07.680 --> 50:12.680]  absolutely man, you inspire us all Alex and we wish there was
[50:12.680 --> 50:15.680]  a million more Alex Joneses as well
[50:15.680 --> 50:17.680]  well, let me tell you
[50:17.680 --> 50:19.680]  100,000 people like you
[50:19.680 --> 50:20.680]  and we turned this thing around
[50:20.680 --> 50:22.680]  and we've got millions of awake people
[50:22.680 --> 50:24.680]  they've just got to be aggressive
[50:24.680 --> 50:25.680]  and they've got to have a powerful tool
[50:25.680 --> 50:27.680]  like the Obama deception
[50:27.680 --> 50:29.680]  that instantly in the first 5 minutes
[50:29.680 --> 50:31.680]  shatters the left-right paradigm
[50:31.680 --> 50:35.680]  with phony right-wing attacks
[50:35.680 --> 50:37.680]  on Obama
[50:37.680 --> 50:40.680]  only props up his base
[50:40.680 --> 50:42.680]  only empowers him
[50:42.680 --> 50:44.680]  but you go after him as a puppet
[50:44.680 --> 50:45.680]  and as establishment
[50:45.680 --> 50:47.680]  and tell the truth and show how he's a liar
[50:47.680 --> 50:49.680]  the whole agenda can be shot down
[50:49.680 --> 50:51.680]  and is being shot down by the grace of God
[50:51.680 --> 50:52.680]  and activists like you
[50:52.680 --> 50:54.680]  Joshua, I salute you
[50:54.680 --> 50:56.680]  fire out the website, it's meetup what?
[50:56.680 --> 50:59.680]  www.meetup.com
[50:59.680 --> 51:04.680]  do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?
[51:04.680 --> 51:06.680]  you are not alone
[51:06.680 --> 51:09.680]  millions of Americans suffer from restless legs
[51:09.680 --> 51:13.680]  restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge
[51:13.680 --> 51:15.680]  to move your legs
[51:15.680 --> 51:17.680]  signs include itching, pulling, tugging
[51:17.680 --> 51:20.680]  and the feeling that bugs are crawling on your legs
[51:20.680 --> 51:22.680]  if having restless legs is preventing you
[51:22.680 --> 51:24.680]  from getting the good night's sleep you deserve
[51:24.680 --> 51:27.680]  or is preventing you from enjoying life

[52:00.680 --> 52:04.680]  in the new world order's war against humanity

[52:07.680 --> 52:10.680]  we've got to have a civilian national security force
[52:10.680 --> 52:13.680]  that's just as powerful, just as strong
[52:13.680 --> 52:15.680]  just as well funded
[52:15.680 --> 52:18.680]  the Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[52:18.680 --> 52:21.680]  that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[52:21.680 --> 52:23.680]  well Obama's already fudging
[52:23.680 --> 52:25.680]  fudged since day one in this election
[52:25.680 --> 52:26.680]  if you have a demagogue
[52:26.680 --> 52:29.680]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[52:29.680 --> 52:31.680]  who is imposing the program
[52:31.680 --> 52:34.680]  of a group of extreme bankers
[52:34.680 --> 52:35.680]  and finance oligarchs
[52:35.680 --> 52:37.680]  that's fascism
[52:37.680 --> 52:38.680]  it's not about left or right
[52:38.680 --> 52:40.680]  it's about a one-world government
[52:40.680 --> 52:43.680]  this film documents who Obama works for
[52:43.680 --> 52:45.680]  the lies he is told

[57:57.680 --> 58:00.680]  the Stasi private government system
[58:00.680 --> 58:02.680]  it's private groups
[58:02.680 --> 58:05.680]  but they work with government power spying on the public

[1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:45.680]  woke me up in high school
[1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:47.680]  and then I went to college and that was really
[1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:49.680]  a big wake up when everything that I'd read
[1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:51.680]  from the JBS and others came true
[1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:53.680]  when they told me the second amendment was bad
[1:00:53.680 --> 1:00:55.680]  America was bad, one world government was good
[1:00:55.680 --> 1:00:57.680]  then I turned on CNN and they'd say
[1:00:57.680 --> 1:01:00.680]  crazy extremists say world government exist
[1:01:00.680 --> 1:01:02.680]  and they're dangerous but I was like wait a minute
[1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:04.680]  I was just taught that at college
[1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:06.680]  so how does it not exist
[1:01:06.680 --> 1:01:09.680]  and down the rabbit hole I went so
[1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:11.680]  great materials they put out and we're honored
[1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:14.680]  to have him here with us at the Central Texas
[1:01:14.680 --> 1:01:16.680]  headquarters. Okay let's go
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:18.680]  to a few calls here, let's talk to John
[1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:20.680]  in South Carolina, John you're on the air
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:22.680]  welcome
[1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:24.680]  Alex how you doing today?
[1:01:24.680 --> 1:01:26.680]  Good sir, what's on your mind?
[1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:29.680]  Well Alex I gotta say I'm a little bit new
[1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:32.680]  to all of this and I'm trying to wake up
[1:01:32.680 --> 1:01:34.680]  some people in my area as you just said
[1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:36.680]  I'm in South Carolina
[1:01:36.680 --> 1:01:38.680]  and I gotta say
[1:01:38.680 --> 1:01:40.680]  I'm not getting a great response
[1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:42.680]  people really don't want to hear
[1:01:42.680 --> 1:01:45.680]  anything other than what they're used to hearing
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:47.680]  Well you just heard the last callers say everybody's
[1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:49.680]  waking up but I always get this
[1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:51.680]  some groups wake up other groups don't
[1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:53.680]  are you trying to wake up your family mainly?
[1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:55.680]  Well it's
[1:01:55.680 --> 1:01:58.680]  I started with my wife, I finally got her over
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:00.680]  I let her watch in game
[1:02:00.680 --> 1:02:02.680]  See I knew that family is the hardest group to wake up
[1:02:02.680 --> 1:02:05.680]  any salesman will tell you that but go ahead
[1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:07.680]  I have to say
[1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:09.680]  in South Carolina we pretty much
[1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:11.680]  are in the Bible built
[1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:13.680]  and people are very conservative
[1:02:13.680 --> 1:02:15.680]  and very set in their ways
[1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:17.680]  and even some of my friends
[1:02:17.680 --> 1:02:19.680]  which I consider to be, I don't know
[1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:21.680]  we were the freaks in high school so
[1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:23.680]  you know you can take what you want from that
[1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:25.680]  even they
[1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:27.680]  have a hard time swallowing a lot of this
[1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:29.680]  even when I show them
[1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:31.680]  the Obama decision
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:33.680]  in game terror storm
[1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:35.680]  and the facts are
[1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:37.680]  I mean they're right there in your face
[1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:39.680]  black and white they just don't want to hear it
[1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:41.680]  it's almost like these people
[1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:43.680]  who I consider to be critically thinking
[1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:45.680]  logical people as soon as
[1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:47.680]  they are faced with something scary
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:49.680]  and let's face it, this is a scary thing
[1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:51.680]  when they're faced with something
[1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:53.680]  scary their logic
[1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:55.680]  goes out of the window
[1:02:55.680 --> 1:02:57.680]  but it's going to get a lot more scary
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:02:59.680]  if the new world order is successful
[1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:01.680]  it's going to shut up
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:03.680]  I mean this type of denial
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:05.680]  is going to allow them to fully
[1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:07.680]  bankrupt this country and socialize it
[1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:09.680]  under the control of the foreign banks
[1:03:09.680 --> 1:03:11.680]  and the fact is the fact that we are
[1:03:11.680 --> 1:03:13.680]  under a PI
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:15.680]  economic system
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:17.680]  that should anger them
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:19.680]  enough right there
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:21.680]  and that is, I mean
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:23.680]  there's so much documentation on that
[1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:25.680]  that's completely irrefutable
[1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:27.680]  and even that doesn't seem to have an effect on them
[1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:29.680]  and my question to you sir is
[1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:31.680]  who can we turn to
[1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:33.680]  in government
[1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:35.680]  or is there no one
[1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:37.680]  is the libertarian party
[1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:39.680]  is that a viable alternative
[1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:41.680]  or is that just yet a third
[1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:43.680]  side of the same coin
[1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:45.680]  well I don't think that
[1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:47.680]  I mean I don't think no, I mean certainly
[1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:49.680]  building a new populist party
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:51.680]  that's based on the ideas
[1:03:51.680 --> 1:03:53.680]  of the constitution, the bill of rights
[1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:55.680]  our system of government
[1:03:55.680 --> 1:03:57.680]  is the key
[1:03:57.680 --> 1:03:59.680]  but 5%
[1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:01.680]  of the nation won the war against
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:03.680]  the British that long eight year war
[1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:05.680]  and so move on, if people don't
[1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:07.680]  want to hear the truth, move on to those that do
[1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:09.680]  want to hear it, move out
[1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:11.680]  into other circles, go to libertarian
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:13.680]  party meetings and educate
[1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:15.680]  them further, that's where you'll find
[1:04:15.680 --> 1:04:17.680]  like-minded people or the John Burt's society
[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:19.680]  get involved with that or
[1:04:19.680 --> 1:04:21.680]  get involved in the constitution party
[1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:23.680]  get involved, go to
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:25.680]  go to liberal environmental meetings
[1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:27.680]  wake them up, go to city council
[1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:29.680]  meetings, you'll cover news every week
[1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:31.680]  during citizens communication
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:33.680]  you'll spend three minutes talking to them
[1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:35.680]  just start engaging
[1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:37.680]  and you'll find a lot of like-minded people
[1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:39.680]  but I appreciate your call sir, good to hear from you
[1:04:39.680 --> 1:04:41.680]  we're going to have a quick break now and come back
[1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:43.680]  with Mr. McManus
[1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:45.680]  John McManus, president of the John Burt's society
[1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:47.680]  in the studio, he's got a Texas tour
[1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:49.680]  going, you'll have a chance to hear him speak
[1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:51.680]  you'll find out how, straight ahead
[1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:53.680]  go to liberalwarge.com
[1:04:53.680 --> 1:04:55.680]  and prisonplanet.com
[1:04:55.680 --> 1:05:21.680]  we'll be right back
[1:05:25.680 --> 1:05:53.680]  we'll be right back
[1:05:53.680 --> 1:05:55.680]  in the new world order's war against humanity
[1:05:55.680 --> 1:05:57.680]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[1:05:57.680 --> 1:05:59.680]  we've got to have a civilian national security force
[1:05:59.680 --> 1:06:01.680]  that's just as powerful
[1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:03.680]  just as strong
[1:06:03.680 --> 1:06:05.680]  just as well-funded
[1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:07.680]  the Obama deception
[1:06:07.680 --> 1:06:09.680]  completely destroys the myth
[1:06:09.680 --> 1:06:11.680]  that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:06:11.680 --> 1:06:13.680]  of the American people
[1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:15.680]  while Obama's already fungin'
[1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:17.680]  yeah fungin'
[1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:19.680]  yeah fungin'
[1:06:19.680 --> 1:06:21.680]  yeah fungin'
[1:06:21.680 --> 1:06:25.680]  yeah fungin'
[1:06:25.680 --> 1:06:27.680]  if you have a demagogue
[1:06:27.680 --> 1:06:29.680]  with a fanatical mass movement of personaliti cultists
[1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:31.680]  who is imposing the program
[1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:33.680]  of a group of extreme bankers
[1:06:33.680 --> 1:06:35.680]  and finance oligarchs
[1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:37.680]  that's fascism
[1:06:37.680 --> 1:06:39.680]  it's not about left to right
[1:06:39.680 --> 1:06:41.680]  it's about a one-world government
[1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:43.680]  this film documents who Obama works for
[1:06:43.680 --> 1:06:45.680]  the lies he has told

[1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:06.680]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[1:08:06.680 --> 1:08:13.560]  a war on for your mind.
[1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:23.400]  We are now simulcasting the radio show for the next two hours and 52 minutes at PrismPlanet.tv.
[1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:27.560]  We have John McManus here in studio with us.
[1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:30.720]  I am very, very excited about that.
[1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:35.160]  The president of the John Burt Society in studio with us until I think five after next
[1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:36.160]  hour.
[1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:39.480]  We'll get a full hour on air with him and we've got some other interesting guests coming
[1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:43.600]  on, Patrice O'Neill, who's an African American and popular comedian.
[1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:47.480]  He's been criticizing Obama and promoting the Obama deception when he goes on national
[1:08:47.480 --> 1:08:48.480]  media outlets.
[1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:51.240]  So we'll see how that goes for his career.
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:52.600]  But that is coming up.
[1:08:52.600 --> 1:08:56.360]  You know, there's so much I'd like to talk to you about and it's great that you were
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:09:00.080]  coming through Texas on this tour and that somebody had the idea that we should contact
[1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:01.080]  you and have you here.
[1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:05.960]  I've had you on a few times over the phone, but Mr. McManus, it is just great to meet
[1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:06.960]  you in person.
[1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:11.680]  I appreciate your tireless work at the John Burt Society over the last 40 years.
[1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:12.680]  Thank you.
[1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:13.680]  It's my pleasure.
[1:09:13.680 --> 1:09:17.480]  I tell people all the time, I wouldn't miss this fight for anything.
[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:21.680]  Boy, I tell you, everything you guys talked about has unfortunately come true.
[1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:26.080]  Talk a little bit about yourself, your 40 plus years there, what the John Burt Society
[1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:27.080]  is for folks that don't know.
[1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:30.280]  And then the tour, let's get that out of the way now because folks want to write this
[1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:31.560]  down and find out where they can come here.
[1:09:31.560 --> 1:09:36.840]  You speak, excellent speaker, very informative and it's all documented the issues you cover.
[1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:40.800]  And then let's get into what the new older is and what we're facing.
[1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:45.520]  Well, on a personal level, I did three years in the Marine Corps after college as a lieutenant
[1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:49.720]  and then I was an electronics engineer and I joined the society as a local member in
[1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:51.560]  the early 60s.
[1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:54.480]  In 1964, they asked me to take a staff position.
[1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:57.280]  Excuse me, it was 66.
[1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:00.640]  So I've been on the staff of the Burt Society for 43 years.
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:04.880]  I worked alongside Robert Welch as his public relations director all during the 70s and
[1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:08.600]  into the 80s until he passed away in 1985.
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:11.160]  In 1991, they named me president.
[1:10:11.160 --> 1:10:17.480]  I'm the head of the society in one respect, but we have a CEO also, fellow named Art Thompson,
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:20.040]  and we work very closely together.
[1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:22.600]  So I've been everything you could imagine in the Burt Society.
[1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:28.800]  I've been a writer and a speaker and a publicist and a radio and television guy.
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:31.480]  I've written five books.
[1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:35.760]  I've done everything you could expect of somebody as long as I've been in the Burt
[1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:38.080]  Society and it's been an absolute delight.
[1:10:38.080 --> 1:10:40.760]  I wouldn't, as I said, I wouldn't miss this for anything.
[1:10:40.760 --> 1:10:45.840]  And it was the John Burt Society that really gets the credit first and that's why you
[1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:50.720]  got demonized in a big way, explaining, no, they control both parties.
[1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:52.000]  It's a foreign cartel.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:53.560]  Here's their own documents.
[1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:58.440]  They want a bank of the world that will regulate all the nation states.
[1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:03.920]  Now that's Time Magazine Newsweek, the Financial Times of London, and now for world government.
[1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:08.120]  The very people engineering economic collapse are openly announcing world government.
[1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:10.840]  I guess you guys aren't so kooky after all for researching them.
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:11.840]  No, not at all.
[1:11:11.840 --> 1:11:16.660]  You know, I wrote a book in 1993 called Financial Terrorism hijacking America under the threat
[1:11:16.660 --> 1:11:18.160]  of bankruptcy.
[1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:24.200]  And in my book in 93, I laid out many, many statements of prominent people who were saying,
[1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:26.600]  well, what we need is world government.
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:28.960]  What we got to have is world government.
[1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:33.000]  And I've gotten calls from people, a couple of calling show people who said that they've
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:37.880]  just simply come across my book recently and, and I'm a prophet, they said, no, I'm not
[1:11:37.880 --> 1:11:38.880]  a prophet at all.
[1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:41.120]  I said, all I did was some homework.
[1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:42.760]  And I did what Robert Welch always said.
[1:11:42.760 --> 1:11:44.360]  He said, just project the lines.
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:48.320]  If you project the lines, you can arrive at the conclusions that are coming.
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:50.000]  That's what we do in the Burt Society.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:54.400]  And I hate to say it, but we predicted all of what's happening here in the economic
[1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:59.040]  malaise that our country's involved in, and it sure is a malaise.
[1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:04.800]  You know, one of the things I quote that you'd be interested in this, when Paul Volcker
[1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:11.720]  was named to be the head of the Federal Reserve back in 1979, he testified before the U.S.
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:16.080]  Senate, and he said, the standard of living of the average American has to come down.
[1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:18.760]  I don't think you can escape that.
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:22.640]  And you got to ask yourself, why would any American want the standard of living of the
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:25.200]  average American to come down?
[1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:27.280]  And the answer is very simple.
[1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:30.600]  If the United States is way up high and the rest of the world is down here, you got to
[1:12:30.600 --> 1:12:34.920]  bring the U.S. down and bring the others up so that we can be comfortably merged into
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:36.800]  the new world order.
[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:38.720]  And that's what Volcker said.
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:40.360]  He said that before the U.S. Senate.
[1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:41.880]  They didn't challenge him.
[1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:43.200]  They said, fine, you're approved.
[1:12:43.200 --> 1:12:45.800]  You go to leave the Federal Reserve.
[1:12:45.800 --> 1:12:47.480]  And he's a bad man, in my view.
[1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:49.520]  And now he's back in the White House.
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:50.520]  Wonderful.
[1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:55.920]  And again, where do you have to be later?
[1:12:55.920 --> 1:12:59.640]  Because I don't think that the 40 minutes of every time we're going to have is enough.
[1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:01.360]  Perhaps I can keep you 15 minutes in the next hour.
[1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:05.080]  We can move the next guest back because we could talk for a whole hour just about your
[1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:06.800]  book and their own documents.
[1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:07.800]  And you're right.
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:11.040]  Back in the early 90s, you guys knew what their battle plan was even then.
[1:13:11.040 --> 1:13:13.640]  And the proofs in the pudding, you've been, you know, proven correct.
[1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:15.760]  Specifically, start over in more detail.
[1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:20.440]  Go over your book, how they operate, how they're on record, writing hundreds of books themselves,
[1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:23.440]  thousands of white papers, admitting their dastardly deeds.
[1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:29.880]  Well, I quoted Brzezinski and I quoted Kissinger and I quoted Volcker and I quoted Berkson,
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:34.120]  the head of the economic thing down there in Washington, and all these people.
[1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:36.240]  They're all saying the same thing.
[1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:40.600]  And I don't know why it is that back then only the Burt's Society was able to say, hey,
[1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:41.600]  put this all together.
[1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:43.480]  Look, this is where they're heading.
[1:13:43.480 --> 1:13:45.160]  They want world government.
[1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:50.160]  Now, one of the points that I like to make and why the Burt's Society became so controversial
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:52.640]  is that we say it's a conspiracy.
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:55.840]  We say, look, these people don't have an ideology.
[1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:57.000]  They're part of a conspiracy.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  They don't believe in anything other than power.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.760]  They don't believe in the communist manifesto.
[1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:03.360]  They don't believe in the constitution.
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:04.520]  They don't believe in scripture.
[1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:05.880]  They don't believe in anything.
[1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:13.360]  They only want power and it's a devilish determination to take power over mankind.
[1:14:13.360 --> 1:14:16.760]  One of the ways of doing that is economically.
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:21.120]  There's Mayor Anshiel Rothschild, the founder of the famous Rothschild Banking Empire.
[1:14:21.120 --> 1:14:23.960]  He said, give me control of a nation's money.
[1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:30.520]  I care not who makes the laws because that person will make the laws as I want them made.
[1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:32.000]  And that's where we are.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:33.200]  So they have control of the money.
[1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:37.200]  Now, the Federal Reserve, Federal Reserve has to go.
[1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:42.880]  And happily there's a bill in Congress now, H.R. 833, to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:47.320]  I would like everybody who's listening to write to your Congressman and say, please co-sponsor
[1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:50.080]  H.R. 833.
[1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:53.560]  And if that happens, the bill is a responsible thing.
[1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:58.840]  It says from the enactment of this bill one year, the Federal Reserve shall stand abolished.
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:01.080]  In other words, it's not going to be an overnight thing.
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:03.520]  It's a responsible piece of legislation.
[1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:04.520]  Glad to see it.
[1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:07.800]  Well, Ron Paul's got another bill to just audit the thing.
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:08.800]  Yeah, it's never been audited.
[1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:13.240]  I mean, you speak to that fact and then even Senator Sanders just a few weeks ago said
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:16.440]  to Bernanke, he said, where's the trillions of dollars?
[1:15:16.440 --> 1:15:17.640]  And Bernanke said, I'm not going to tell you.
[1:15:17.640 --> 1:15:20.760]  No, I'm not going to tell you.
[1:15:20.760 --> 1:15:24.120]  Most Americans have no idea that the Federal Reserve is a private agency.
[1:15:24.120 --> 1:15:25.520]  It's not a government agency.
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:26.520]  And that's amazing.
[1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:30.000]  You go to Washington, D.C., and you pull out that big phone book they have, and they have
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:33.240]  blue pages for all the federal agencies.
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:35.200]  And the Federal Reserve's not there.
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:36.560]  It's not a federal agency.
[1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:38.720]  And they take dictation from no one.
[1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:42.320]  They don't answer the questions they don't want to answer, as you just mentioned.
[1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:43.720]  And on and on you go.
[1:15:43.720 --> 1:15:46.200]  Now, the Fed has never been audited.
[1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:48.520]  And I had an interesting thing happen to me.
[1:15:48.520 --> 1:15:50.560]  I said that in a speech about a year ago.
[1:15:50.560 --> 1:15:54.160]  A guy wrote me a letter and he sent me a little newspaper clipping talking about the Fed had
[1:15:54.160 --> 1:15:55.560]  been audited.
[1:15:55.560 --> 1:15:59.200]  And I did some investigation and I found out what they'd audited was the number of desks
[1:15:59.200 --> 1:16:02.680]  and the number of pencils and the number of file cabinets and so on.
[1:16:02.680 --> 1:16:05.200]  They didn't go into any of the financial end of it.
[1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:08.640]  And so effectively, the Fed has still never been audited.
[1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:14.360]  John Paul has a bill and that one's H.R. 1207 to audit the Fed.
[1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:17.440]  And I understand that there's a lot of people jumping aboard co-signing.
[1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:22.840]  This one, they're up to about something like 35 co-signers or co-sponsors.
[1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:23.840]  That's good.
[1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:25.360]  I would love to see an audit of the Fed.
[1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:29.320]  I'd like to know what they've got for wealth and what they do with it and how they operate
[1:16:29.320 --> 1:16:30.320]  and so forth.
[1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:31.400]  But we don't know.
[1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:35.360]  We don't know because it's a private agency and they thumb their nose at government.
[1:16:35.360 --> 1:16:43.480]  Did you see the clip on the news hour with former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan when he
[1:16:43.480 --> 1:16:49.640]  said, look, the president, the legislative, the Congress, no one can even question us
[1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:52.920]  or look at us because he was asked, what's your relationship to the government?
[1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:54.280]  And he said, there is none.
[1:16:54.280 --> 1:16:58.960]  We are a, quote, separate agency and are non-reviewable.
[1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:00.800]  So I mean, we know our constitution.
[1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:01.800]  We know our bill of rights.
[1:17:01.800 --> 1:17:02.800]  We know the separation of powers.
[1:17:02.800 --> 1:17:07.160]  That's all three branches reviewing each other, tying down dominant men.
[1:17:07.160 --> 1:17:12.880]  And just here is this private fellow reserve dancing around in public, arrogantly saying,
[1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:16.200]  we're not only secret and you can't audit us.
[1:17:16.200 --> 1:17:20.440]  No agency of government can even look at us and we're going to set up a new bank of
[1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:22.800]  the world that you pay your taxes to.
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:26.440]  I mean, this is just tyranny.
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:27.440]  It's tyranny.
[1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:28.440]  Absolutely.
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:29.440]  It's absolutely wrong.
[1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:34.760]  Now, you know, the idea for it came from the Communist Manifesto, plank number five.
[1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:40.360]  And that's the Communist Manifesto says a central bank with state control and so on.
[1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:43.040]  And we've gone one worse than Karl Marx.
[1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:44.920]  We've outmarked Marx.
[1:17:44.920 --> 1:17:48.920]  He said in the hands of the state, we say, no, it's a private agency.
[1:17:48.920 --> 1:17:51.920]  Ours is worse than what Karl Marx even wanted.
[1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:55.360]  But as you pioneered exposing at the JBS, and I've seen the government documents congressional
[1:17:55.360 --> 1:18:00.020]  testimony, it was really the big central banks to con the public into slavery, the
[1:18:00.020 --> 1:18:02.720]  people's paradise that finance communism.
[1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:05.080]  So of course you're going to have public education.
[1:18:05.080 --> 1:18:08.360]  And of course you're going to have a central bank.
[1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:10.320]  And of course you're going to have federal control.
[1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:14.680]  All the things in that Communist Manifesto, that's what the governments of the world follow
[1:18:14.680 --> 1:18:18.000]  when they're under the control of the private banks and their enemy is the Bill of Rights
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  and Constitution.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  Absolutely.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:24.400]  The 10 planks of the Communist Manifesto all are partially or fully in place in the
[1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:25.840]  United States today.
[1:18:25.840 --> 1:18:27.840]  It all happened in the 20th century.
[1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:31.440]  Number 10, free education for all children in the government schools.
[1:18:31.440 --> 1:18:34.760]  And I like to tell my audience, I said, now, if the government is going to control the
[1:18:34.760 --> 1:18:38.920]  schools, do you think they're going to teach anything that will impact government power?
[1:18:38.920 --> 1:18:40.320]  The answer is no.
[1:18:40.320 --> 1:18:43.880]  I say, if a Hindu starts a school, is he going to teach Lutheranism?
[1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:44.880]  No.
[1:18:44.880 --> 1:18:48.960]  If a government starts a school, they're going to teach government power and want government
[1:18:48.960 --> 1:18:54.040]  power to be preached and taught and not impacted by the schools they control.
[1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:56.000]  Very simple.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:01.800]  One of the great reasons for hope in our country is so many people are going to homeschooling,
[1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:03.320]  and the more of that, the better.
[1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:05.360]  But now the feds are moving to try to restrict that.
[1:19:05.360 --> 1:19:09.360]  Well, they did try to restrict it, and there were some states where they actually grabbed
[1:19:09.360 --> 1:19:13.840]  children out of the homes and impounded them and so forth, but members of the Bird Society
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:14.840]  stopped that.
[1:19:14.840 --> 1:19:19.440]  One of the worst cases was in Idaho of all places, and Virginia was another key place.
[1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:24.200]  And in both places, our people, our Bird Society people got in there and made sure that this
[1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:25.200]  didn't happen.
[1:19:25.200 --> 1:19:29.760]  Now, so homeschool is pretty much allowed today, but the tyranny involved in it is all
[1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:34.040]  the people who are homeschooling still have to pay taxes to support the schools that they
[1:19:34.040 --> 1:19:35.040]  won't send their kids to.
[1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:36.040]  Yeah.
[1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:40.160]  Slaver will take, last year, the state court in California ruled that the state owns the
[1:19:40.160 --> 1:19:41.160]  children.
[1:19:41.160 --> 1:19:42.160]  Now, that got struck down.
[1:19:42.160 --> 1:19:43.160]  It got struck down.
[1:19:43.160 --> 1:19:44.160]  But that shows the mindset.
[1:19:44.160 --> 1:19:45.160]  Right.
[1:19:45.160 --> 1:19:47.320]  I mean, it got struck down for a time.
[1:19:47.320 --> 1:19:48.520]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:19:48.520 --> 1:19:52.760]  But they're trying to say, you have the children, we the state, take them over.
[1:19:52.760 --> 1:19:56.440]  John McManus, president of the John Bird Society is in studio.
[1:19:56.440 --> 1:19:57.440]  This is great.
[1:19:57.440 --> 1:19:58.520]  It's wonderful to have you, sir.
[1:19:58.520 --> 1:20:01.840]  My pleasure.
[1:20:01.840 --> 1:20:06.720]  The new world order beast is genetically modifying your food.
[1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:14.720]  Genetically modifying, mixing vegetables with animals, and now experimenting with viruses.
[1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:23.120]  Without a long term food solution, you will have just two options, starve or surrender.
[1:20:23.120 --> 1:20:27.080]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[1:20:27.080 --> 1:20:28.080]  What then?

[1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:05.080]  That's why.
[1:21:05.080 --> 1:21:06.080]  Really.
[1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:12.080]  Minus the destruction of food, I don't have any chance of a word that he's causing for,
[1:21:12.080 --> 1:21:13.080]  indeed.
[1:21:13.080 --> 1:21:18.640]  US Freefall? Scandal after scandal with hedge funds companies? If protecting your hard-earned
[1:21:18.640 --> 1:21:23.600]  savings or retirement fund is on your mind, the answer is simple. Secure your assets
[1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:25.880]  by purchasing gold and silver.
[1:21:25.880 --> 1:21:30.320]  Since President Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971, the United States has been
[1:21:30.320 --> 1:21:35.400]  operating the longest-running fiat currency in the history of mankind. Gold has held its
[1:21:35.400 --> 1:21:44.080]  purchasing power for over 6,000 years. Contact me, Peter Cronchnoble, at 1-800-686-2237 extension

[1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:07.560]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:12.080]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[1:22:12.080 --> 1:22:13.400]  us would like to see.
[1:22:13.400 --> 1:22:18.560]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:19.920]  of the American people.
[1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:24.320]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:22:24.320 --> 1:22:29.440]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:37.560]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:42.280]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents
[1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:48.880]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the

[1:24:15.080 --> 1:24:18.800]  We've got the president of the John Bird Society here on the Texas tour. Before we run out
[1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:23.320]  of time and you will be here 50 minutes to the next hour, tell us about the speaking
[1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:27.520]  dates you've already done some that you have left in Texas and the hotels those are being
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:29.520]  held up for folks that want to come learn more.
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:34.400]  Well, tonight I'll be in San Antonio at the Embassy Suites and I think that's on the
[1:24:34.400 --> 1:24:39.320]  north side of town. And then Friday night I'll be at the Richardson Civic Center in
[1:24:39.320 --> 1:24:43.680]  Richardson, Texas right outside Dallas. And about a month I come back and I'm going to
[1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:51.360]  speak in Lubbock and Midland and Amarillo, but I don't know where. But you can find
[1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:56.520]  that out by going to jbs.org and the information is all there.
[1:24:56.520 --> 1:25:00.960]  You can just go to JBS events and see what the president's speaking.
[1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:06.640]  And then you're pretty much a year around doing speaking engagements. So there's no
[1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:10.520]  matter where you are in the country throughout the year, you generally get to close to where
[1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:11.520]  folks are at.
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:15.400]  That's right. I do a lot of traveling. My wife's favorite phrase to me is have a nice
[1:25:15.400 --> 1:25:16.400]  trip.
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:20.600]  Yeah, that's what my wife says to me. She says, bye, see you.
[1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:22.520]  Have a nice trip.
[1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:29.160]  You know, we do sacrifice seeing our families as much as we like, which is the most important
[1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:32.520]  thing in the world because I know I have a passion. I know you have a passion. There's
[1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:38.200]  so much evidence. There's so much globalist takeover going on. I mean, people think sometimes
[1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:41.600]  I exaggerate. It's the opposite. There's too much evidence to cover it all.
[1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:45.760]  Well, there certainly is enough evidence for anybody who wants to take the time to look.
[1:25:45.760 --> 1:25:50.240]  And so then what do you do? You find out that your country is being converted into a socialist
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:56.400]  system. Even Newsweek magazine said, we are all socialists now. Oh, there it is. Yeah.
[1:25:56.400 --> 1:26:01.800]  And we've been saying that for a long, long time. What is socialism? Socialism is controlled
[1:26:01.800 --> 1:26:07.320]  by government. Simple. It's economic control. But of course, if you have economic control,
[1:26:07.320 --> 1:26:11.800]  it follows. And if you don't like what's happening with the economic control, you, you start
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:15.920]  a Gestapo, you start a police state, you can do all kinds of things. And that's where
[1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:21.400]  we, what we face. Now, one of the things that I like to say is that you go down to Washington
[1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:26.000]  today and you talk to Senator, Congressman, president, anybody else, they say, look, we're
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:31.600]  in an economic downturn and government has to do something. No, the opposite is what
[1:26:31.600 --> 1:26:36.160]  needs to be done. Government has to undo things. They have to undo all kinds of things. They
[1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:40.560]  never should have started in the first place. Obama has announced that there's going to
[1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:47.560]  be a $1.75 trillion deficit this fiscal year. And a day after he announced that he announced
[1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:53.360]  a $51 billion foreign aid program. Now I say, if you go to a fourth grader and you ask him,
[1:26:53.360 --> 1:26:58.120]  if you've heavily in debt, should you give away money, the fourth grader would say, no,
[1:26:58.120 --> 1:27:02.920]  of course not. And I think sometimes we need fourth graders in Congress. Yeah.
[1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:06.960]  Yeah. The common sense isn't there, but they know what they're doing. They use our money
[1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:13.920]  against us. Now, you mentioned this earlier, but it's key that you and others are on record
[1:27:13.920 --> 1:27:17.800]  laying out their blueprint. You weren't looking into a crystal ball. You were studying their
[1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:21.920]  own documents. Tell us about your book in the early nineties dealing with economic terrorism,
[1:27:21.920 --> 1:27:26.760]  because that's what they're doing now. They engineer the crisis. They bring it in. They
[1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:31.000]  say, give us the banker bailout, which is really a banker takeover, or there'll be
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:34.480]  a depression. Then things get worse. They say, okay, give us stimulus packages, give
[1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:38.880]  us more banker control, or there'll be a depression. Then we give them more control. And the same
[1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:42.880]  thing over and over again, break down specifically your book and your predictions and what we're
[1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:44.400]  now in the process of seeing.
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:49.760]  Well, the book did a lot of research about what is money and what was the Constitution's
[1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:56.600]  position regarding money. And then one chapter is called Carl Marx would have loved the Fed.
[1:27:56.600 --> 1:28:00.680]  Get into all of that. How do we get out of it? And we got out of it. At the end of the
[1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:06.720]  book, I started talking about the fact that government ought to sell a lot of its holdings.
[1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:12.160]  If 13 Western states more than 50% of it is owned by the federal government, then they
[1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:16.720]  ought to sell it, sell the land. They could start paying off the national debt, but the
[1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:21.280]  national debt is going so far out of sight today. It's a little bit hard to even imagine.
[1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:25.280]  You wonder if they're ever going to be able to pay the national debt. Now, my book is
[1:28:25.280 --> 1:28:30.560]  called financial terrorism. Unfortunately, it's out of print. I went through two printings,
[1:28:30.560 --> 1:28:34.600]  but now people are coming back and some people have dragged it out and reread it, said it's
[1:28:34.600 --> 1:28:43.280]  more apical today than it was when I wrote it in 1993. So yeah, we're in favor of that.
[1:28:43.280 --> 1:28:47.320]  One of the things I'm making, one of the points I'm making in my speech is to contrast. It's
[1:28:47.320 --> 1:28:53.840]  really not contrast as much as compare. What happened in Japan way back in the late 80s
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:56.600]  and into the early 90s?
[1:28:56.600 --> 1:29:02.240]  During the late 80s, Japan was boomtown. Japan was piling up all kinds of wealth and Japan
[1:29:02.240 --> 1:29:05.920]  was going to overtake everybody and there was all kinds of information about this all
[1:29:05.920 --> 1:29:10.640]  over the place. In fact, Japan, even at that point, bought Rockefeller Center. I don't
[1:29:10.640 --> 1:29:14.160]  remember if you remember that. They had to pay it back. They had to give it back, sell
[1:29:14.160 --> 1:29:21.760]  it back afterwards. But in 1992, their bubble burst and housing prices went down 80%. And
[1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:27.640]  the Nikkei Stock Exchange went down two thirds. So what did the government do in Japan? They
[1:29:27.640 --> 1:29:30.520]  did exactly what we are doing in America.
[1:29:30.520 --> 1:29:33.520]  Stay there. We're going to come back long seven, putting your time to go over this.
[1:29:33.520 --> 1:29:38.840]  Then I want to throw out some of the current policies, National Compulsory Service, Open
[1:29:38.840 --> 1:29:43.840]  Borders, Restrictions on the Second Amendment. The establishment is clearly making its biggest
[1:29:43.840 --> 1:29:48.440]  move ever against freedom. Instead of going incrementally, they've launched the Blitzkrieg
[1:29:48.440 --> 1:29:52.960]  attack on freedom. John McManus, president of the JBS, our guest.
[1:29:52.960 --> 1:30:01.680]  The empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:01.680 --> 1:30:06.000]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update. GCN has just discovered
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:10.360]  a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs. It's called Proto-Grow and
[1:30:10.360 --> 1:30:14.040]  it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants
[1:30:14.040 --> 1:30:18.520]  to grow like crazy under practically any soil and like conditions. Now here's the best part
[1:30:18.520 --> 1:30:22.680]  for our listeners who garden for self-reliance. Proto-Grow's unique blend of sea nutrients
[1:30:22.680 --> 1:30:26.960]  maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant
[1:30:26.960 --> 1:30:31.040]  growth in minimum time. Proto-Grow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity
[1:30:31.040 --> 1:30:35.160]  to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants. Proto-Grow's full spectrum
[1:30:35.160 --> 1:30:38.680]  plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste, and up to 10 times
[1:30:38.680 --> 1:30:42.200]  the nutritional value. And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheat
[1:30:42.200 --> 1:30:46.960]  grass, you can. If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[1:30:46.960 --> 1:30:50.640]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief superfoods should visit the Proto-Grow website
[1:30:50.640 --> 1:31:01.640]  at growlikecrazy.com. That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365.
[1:31:01.640 --> 1:31:07.480]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[1:31:07.480 --> 1:31:13.640]  got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just
[1:31:13.640 --> 1:31:17.520]  as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the
[1:31:17.520 --> 1:31:22.680]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already
[1:31:22.680 --> 1:31:27.960]  fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical
[1:31:27.960 --> 1:31:33.800]  mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[1:31:33.800 --> 1:31:39.520]  bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about
[1:31:39.520 --> 1:31:46.160]  a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told,

[1:32:01.800 --> 1:32:06.560]  This year millions of people will lose electricity, ice storms, earthquakes flooding or hurricanes
[1:32:06.560 --> 1:32:10.920]  could leave you without power for days. Anyone that's ever been in a blackout knows that
[1:32:10.920 --> 1:32:15.720]  the first thing you need is a flashlight. That's why you need the pack light. The pack
[1:32:15.720 --> 1:32:21.520]  light is powered by a 9-volt battery and lasts up to 1200 hours. It's so small it fits right
[1:32:21.520 --> 1:32:27.080]  in your pocket and glows in the dark, making it easy to fight when you need it most. One
[1:32:27.080 --> 1:32:32.760]  Florida customer says, my pack light has lasted through four hurricanes in two years, over
[1:32:32.760 --> 1:32:38.160]  30 days without electricity and I'm still using the same battery. The pack light comes
[1:32:38.160 --> 1:32:43.720]  with a 25-year warranty and prices started just $12.99. It's time for you to be prepared
[1:32:43.720 --> 1:32:51.640]  with a pack light. Visit us at 9voltlight.com, that's 9voltlight.com or call us today toll-free

[1:33:11.040 --> 1:33:16.240]  McManus, president of the John Burt society, I tried to give you a copy of the Obama deception
[1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:18.720]  you got here, but somebody had gotten you one of the internet burn copies, which we
[1:33:18.720 --> 1:33:23.080]  appreciate, but we've given you a copy now. I don't really know what your review of it
[1:33:23.080 --> 1:33:28.120]  is, so this will be a virgin ground for me here, but what is your take on the Obama deception?
[1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:31.760]  Well, there's a lot of good information in there. A lot of information the American people
[1:33:31.760 --> 1:33:38.840]  need to know. I don't doubt that a bit. I watched it on a little thing I have on a plane ride
[1:33:38.840 --> 1:33:43.000]  and I watched it on that, and of course I wasn't taking notes or anything. So I want
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:48.400]  to go back and study it some more, but there's an awful lot in there that the American people
[1:33:48.400 --> 1:33:51.280]  need to know about the man who is now in the White House.
[1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:55.640]  Well, what we attempt to do is what you guys have always done. Can we stop looking at the
[1:33:55.640 --> 1:34:00.080]  little puppets right here? Can we look past them to the puppet master? Finish up your
[1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:03.480]  story about financial terrorism, the Japan.
[1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:10.960]  Well, what happened in Japan? It's really stunning. Japan had the bubble burst in 1992,
[1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:14.800]  and so the government decided that it had to do something. So what did it do? Well,
[1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:19.400]  the first thing it did was it printed a lot more money. Now, keep in mind that what happened
[1:34:19.400 --> 1:34:24.800]  in Japan is what is being done now to treat a similar problem here in our country. They
[1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:31.280]  nationalized some industries. They gave all kinds of stimulus packages. They did everything
[1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:36.800]  we're doing here in America, and 17 years later, they're still in their recession. And
[1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:41.240]  you go back to the Great Depression and go to the 30s, and you can see that everything
[1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:45.480]  that was done by Hoover and then by Roosevelt, who tripled what Hoover had been doing, it
[1:34:45.480 --> 1:34:49.400]  kept us in the depression. It didn't get us out of the depression, and this is what's
[1:34:49.400 --> 1:34:55.520]  happening here today. Everything that government is doing is wrong. They should not do it.
[1:34:55.520 --> 1:34:58.760]  And one of the things that we like to say, a principle of the free enterprise system
[1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:04.960]  is that governments or organizations that fail should be allowed to fail. And why should
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:11.560]  the American people bail out AIG and Citibank and some corporations and automobile producers
[1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:15.640]  and so forth. Agencies and governments shouldn't be doing that.
[1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:20.760]  Well, more than just that, though, from our perspective, they failed. From our perspective,
[1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:25.680]  they're screwing up and it's wrong. But if you, as you know, read the globalist documents,
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:31.440]  the Club of Rome, CFR, Trilateral Commission, they build these bubbles, get everybody overextended
[1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:35.800]  in debt, and then implode them to get more power and control as government did during
[1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:40.640]  the depression, as is what's happening in Japan. So can you specifically speak to the
[1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:46.560]  fact and give a sure take on how they're using the crisis they created to now openly set
[1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:47.560]  up world government?
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:54.880]  Well, everything you see coming out of Washington is more regulation, more spending, more tax
[1:35:54.880 --> 1:36:00.320]  on the freedom of the American people. And was it Ron Mimmanuel who said a crisis is
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:05.400]  a terrible thing to waste. And so either create a crisis or you take advantage of a crisis
[1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:10.560]  and then you come out. The answer to the crisis is more power, more government power. Now,
[1:36:10.560 --> 1:36:15.120]  in this case, we're seeing all kinds of suggestions for global power. We're seeing suggestions
[1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:21.840]  for IMF to issue the money. We're seeing suggestions for global regulation. We're going to lose
[1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:25.600]  our country. We're going to lose the Declaration of Independence. We're going to lose the Constitution
[1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:31.480]  of the United States. We say to people, look, please shake yourself, wake up, all right,
[1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:38.320]  get involved, help us, join the John Burr Society, call us, JBS, USA1, or get on the
[1:36:38.320 --> 1:36:44.560]  internet, JBS.org. We're glad to hear from anybody. And we're certainly glad to go on
[1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:48.720]  radio shows and television shows anywhere that people are saying the same kind of thing
[1:36:48.720 --> 1:36:54.880]  and we'll lend support and we support each other, I guess, just to try to save our country.
[1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:58.640]  Well, you have a valuable monthly magazine and it's just always...
[1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:00.680]  Oh, no, every second week, not monthly.
[1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:07.840]  That's what every two weeks. It is just invaluable information, so well documented, and folks
[1:37:07.840 --> 1:37:09.880]  can also go to the website and...
[1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:15.000]  Get the New American Magazine, right? The New American Magazine will supply anybody
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:19.920]  with the nuts and bolts information that you need. There's a lot of people in our country
[1:37:19.920 --> 1:37:23.160]  who say, well, there's something wrong here. I don't like the Federal Reserve, but they
[1:37:23.160 --> 1:37:26.880]  don't know why. They don't have the nuts and bolts. You go to our magazine, you get the
[1:37:26.880 --> 1:37:27.880]  nuts and bolts.
[1:37:27.880 --> 1:37:31.920]  All right, I want to go back and focus on this, though. We have hundreds of mainstream
[1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:35.960]  news articles now admitting world governments saying it'll be a world government, a bank
[1:37:35.960 --> 1:37:40.480]  of the world, time and newsweek with headlines like New World Order saying it'll be a new
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:44.360]  bank of the world that sets interest rates and sets currency values and knocks the heads
[1:37:44.360 --> 1:37:49.600]  of bad people and that will pay carbon taxes to this whole Malthusian move. I mean, this
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:55.480]  is a totally controlled economy, and that is not a free market. This international banking
[1:37:55.480 --> 1:38:00.040]  elite are monopoly men, so can you speak to the type of world government they're now publicly
[1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:06.600]  setting up and then explain to folks in your own way that they keep claiming the free market
[1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:11.800]  has failed. This hasn't been the free market. This has been bankers, banksters, using government
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:12.800]  to create monopolies.
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:15.080]  That's right. Well, you've said it. I don't have to...
[1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:17.600]  Give me your own words, though, because I've seen you give speeches on it. I want you
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:18.600]  to lay it out.
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:24.240]  Well, what you see is taking advantage of crisis, and then the answer is always more
[1:38:24.240 --> 1:38:29.840]  government regulation, and what we're seeing now is the suggestion is international regulation.
[1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:34.800]  We need the IMF to start issuing the money. We need this. We need that. Lurking behind
[1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:39.160]  all of this is the United Nations, and I know that the American people have a dim view of
[1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:43.320]  the United Nations. In fact, Gallup poll just came out recently said 60 percent of the people
[1:38:43.320 --> 1:38:48.440]  have a negative view about the United Nations, and most people in America say, oh, it's a
[1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:52.760]  waste of time. It never gets anything done, and so forth. No, that's not so. It's lurking
[1:38:52.760 --> 1:39:00.840]  in the background and poised and ready to take total control. The people who are supposedly
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:05.960]  solving the problems aren't solving the problems. What they're doing is building more power
[1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:12.880]  for themselves at our country level and internationally, and so forth. You got the EU working into
[1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:13.880]  this now.
[1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:18.680]  European ministers are saying globalism is the answer. We've got to have that. I suppose
[1:39:18.680 --> 1:39:24.800]  you probably know that the $170 billion that's been given to AIG, the American International
[1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:30.440]  Group here, most of that money that they got immediately went to pay their debts in Europe.
[1:39:30.440 --> 1:39:35.040]  It didn't help America. Not that it should have been done in the first place, but there's
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:39.120]  a good example, and then, of course, you have them going after the bonuses that were paid,
[1:39:39.120 --> 1:39:44.840]  which is one-tenth of one percent of the money that's been given to AIG, and if they stop
[1:39:44.840 --> 1:39:47.560]  the bonuses, the people are going to say, well, at least the government's doing the
[1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:51.560]  right thing. No, it's not doing the right thing. It's diverting attention from the
[1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:56.920]  real problem, which is $170 billion being given to an organization that should have
[1:39:56.920 --> 1:39:58.080]  been allowed to fail.
[1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:03.880]  And that's only one of many globalist organizations, and there's no discussion of the franchise
[1:40:03.880 --> 1:40:10.200]  owner of the big billionaire George Soros, David Rockefeller, Rothschild types, who
[1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:14.320]  were actually getting the money from the bailout. Meanwhile, they divert everybody with, oh,
[1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:20.840]  look at these CEOs who work for them, as you said, getting a penance, a tiny fraction of
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:21.840]  the real money.
[1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:27.040]  A nat on a bull elephant. That's what it is. But the people are saying, oh, okay, at least
[1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:30.800]  they're doing something right. No, they're not doing something right. First of all, if
[1:40:30.800 --> 1:40:34.080]  a company wants to give somebody a bonus, it's none of the government's business in
[1:40:34.080 --> 1:40:35.080]  the first place.
[1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:36.080]  That's right, that's right.
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:37.080]  That's another principle.
[1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:41.540]  That's right. It sets the precedent to come in and regulate every facet of the economy,
[1:40:41.540 --> 1:40:45.440]  and now that's the new power that they're saying they want to give Geithner is to go
[1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:47.680]  after not just banks, but other companies.
[1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:51.680]  Right. Geithner's an interesting guy. He was the head of the New York Federal Reserve,
[1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:56.440]  right? The New York Fed is the power. There's 12 member banks in the Federal Reserve system.
[1:40:56.440 --> 1:41:00.920]  And a lot of them is just window dressing. The power is New York, not even in Washington.
[1:41:00.920 --> 1:41:05.040]  They have a big, beautiful building in Washington. I've been inside that building, right? Big,
[1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:08.760]  beautiful building, but the power is in New York City. And Geithner was the head of it.
[1:41:08.760 --> 1:41:13.200]  All right. And what has Geithner accomplished? He's accomplished, oh, as the head of the
[1:41:13.200 --> 1:41:18.440]  Fed, continuing a process of printing tremendous amounts of money that lowers the value of
[1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:20.000]  everybody's money.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:23.720]  I like to say when I was a boy, I could buy a candy bar for a nickel and now it costs a
[1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:31.440]  dime, but the candy costs the same. The value of the dollar has gone down 95% since 1945.
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:36.840]  Where did it go? It was stolen from the American people by a process called inflation. And inflation
[1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:42.280]  is not only thievery, it can destroy your nation as it did Germany after the YMR Republic
[1:41:42.280 --> 1:41:43.280]  and their inflation.
[1:41:43.280 --> 1:41:47.000]  Well, that's the plan. They've stated is to blow out the world's currencies and then
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:52.760]  set up a new super currency that controls regional currencies. And they're now announcing
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:59.120]  at the G 20 coming up in April. And I was just watching Gordon Brown online a few days
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:04.400]  ago before the European Parliament. And he said a global Europe, though he's, that's
[1:42:04.400 --> 1:42:10.680]  a quote, global Europe dominating the entire planet. And he said world government financial
[1:42:10.680 --> 1:42:16.840]  control over every nation setting world tax rates. They got a world army. They got a world
[1:42:16.840 --> 1:42:21.920]  court. They're coming in with world taxation and regulation. Can you speak to the phony
[1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:26.040]  carbon taxes in the environmental movement? What that's really about is you've exposed
[1:42:26.040 --> 1:42:27.040]  that.
[1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:33.240]  Well, first of all, global warming is a charade in my view. Yes, temperatures go up and temperatures
[1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:38.240]  go down. It's not caused by you and me driving our automobile or hairspray or any of that
[1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:43.760]  stuff. This whole global warming thing is a charade of farce. And what it's designed
[1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:49.480]  to do is to give government more power. Once again, you see the same thing. So now they've
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:55.960]  decided that they have to have carbon taxes in order to shut down more of America's industrial
[1:42:55.960 --> 1:43:01.320]  power. Much of it has already been shut down by outsourcing and by NAFTA and the rest of
[1:43:01.320 --> 1:43:08.800]  it. So they want global carbon tax and the United States is going to have to pay taxes
[1:43:08.800 --> 1:43:14.160]  in order to continue doing any industrial activity in order to solve a problem that's
[1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:19.720]  not going to be solved by cutting back on carbon. Carbon dioxide is wonderful. Carbon
[1:43:19.720 --> 1:43:24.600]  dioxide is something that all plants eat. You want carbon dioxide. If you have carbon
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:29.800]  dioxide, you're going to have better trees, better bushes, better crops, better everything.
[1:43:29.800 --> 1:43:35.120]  And it's just bonkers. Everything's backwards. And we've got all kinds of experts out there.
[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:41.640]  We've got these experts in the economic field and experts in the so-called environmental
[1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:45.560]  field, people like Al Gore. If he's an expert, I'm a Martian.
[1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:49.040]  Well, he's very arrogant. He had nothing to do with the Internet and he claims he invented
[1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:50.920]  it. He invented the Internet. That's right.
[1:43:50.920 --> 1:43:57.880]  Which was around in its infancy when he was in college. But expanding on that, because
[1:43:57.880 --> 1:44:02.320]  you've written books on this, and you give speeches. We've placed some of your speeches
[1:44:02.320 --> 1:44:05.840]  here on the local cable access where I started out many years ago. Waking folks up. Bob Daisy
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:12.080]  does it down there. Also writes for the New American. Expanding on this, can you break
[1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:17.760]  down for folks why the globalists want to destroy industrial bases of nation-states?
[1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:21.840]  Why they want to weaken all nations? Then they have this big international body that
[1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:26.920]  then finances and controls what's left of those countries. I mean, they know carbon
[1:44:26.920 --> 1:44:30.560]  dioxide isn't bad. They're cold-bloodily wanting to tax the carbon cycle.
[1:44:30.560 --> 1:44:35.080]  Right. Right. Well, it's very simple. It leads to world government.
[1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:39.480]  You can't merge the United States with some of the poor backward countries in Africa without
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:44.240]  destroying the United States first. And that's what it's at. That's what I said earlier with
[1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:49.040]  the Volcker testifying before the U.S. Senate. The standard of living of the average American
[1:44:49.040 --> 1:44:54.360]  has to go down. I don't think you can escape that. That's what he said. And the senator
[1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:59.560]  sat there and took it. And they should have thrown him right out of the room. Anybody
[1:44:59.560 --> 1:45:03.800]  who wants to destroy the standard of living of the people of the United States should
[1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:09.080]  not be getting confirmation by the U.S. Senate to lead the Federal Reserve. And that confirmation
[1:45:09.080 --> 1:45:13.440]  is a charade, too. Everybody who goes before the Senate for confirmation for a Federal
[1:45:13.440 --> 1:45:17.960]  Reserve job always gets passed. The Fed comes to the president and said, we want you to
[1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:23.400]  nominate this guy, and that's who they nominate. And while we went from Volcker to the Greenspan,
[1:45:23.400 --> 1:45:28.880]  now we got Bernanke, who's a disciple of Greenspan. And what's he calling for? He's calling for
[1:45:28.880 --> 1:45:34.680]  more government regulation. He's calling for more government power and so forth. You can't
[1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:39.720]  have more and more and more of something without filling it up. And when they fill it up, it's
[1:45:39.720 --> 1:45:44.000]  going to be the New World Order, the Novus Orosachlorum. That's what they're after.
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:47.800]  If they succeed from their own documents that you've researched, what will the New World
[1:45:47.800 --> 1:45:50.640]  Order look like when they finally put the capstone on the pyramid?
[1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:55.000]  Well, first of all, everybody will be a slave to government. You will be working for government
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:46:01.640]  if you have a job. And secondly, I believe that there will be a physical extermination
[1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:05.480]  of many, many millions of people. They've done it everywhere they've taken over. They
[1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:10.280]  did it in Russia. They did it in China. They did it in Laos. They did it in Cambodia. Every
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:15.120]  place where total government has taken over, there has been carnage of immense proportions.
[1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:22.320]  Now, you've got a guy like, who's the guy running around on his little boat, the great
[1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:27.720]  oceanographer, Jacques Cousteau. Did you ever see what he said?
[1:46:27.720 --> 1:46:32.760]  Yeah, we've got to kill 357,000 people a day. It's a terrible thing to say that, but it's
[1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:37.980]  even more terrible not to say it and not to do it. Specifically, go over that. The United
[1:46:37.980 --> 1:46:42.480]  Nations, 1996, biological diversity assessment says they got to get rid of 80% of us. All
[1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:47.120]  these public statements by Prince Philip, I mean, this is what they do. This is what
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:48.880]  they're into. Explain that to people.
[1:46:48.880 --> 1:46:54.840]  Well, you know, why would you want to do that, except that you hate mankind, except that
[1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:59.920]  you have a diabolical determination to rule the world, and you're going to get a lot of
[1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:05.560]  people out of the way, and you're going to scare the rest into submission by killing
[1:47:05.560 --> 1:47:11.200]  so many. Cousteau is supposed to be a nice man. He's worried about the oceans and everything
[1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:16.840]  else, but he actually said what you said. I think it was 435,000 a day until we get
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:19.400]  down to a level of about a one million people.
[1:47:19.400 --> 1:47:23.480]  Yeah. Well, when I make films, I actually go to the library to pull the quotes and that
[1:47:23.480 --> 1:47:26.640]  was appeared. Incidentally, that appeared in the United Nations document.
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:30.360]  That's what I was about to say. And so the reason people will then find our numbers
[1:47:30.360 --> 1:47:34.680]  ago. Well, I found this. I found that Cousteau said that dozens of times, different numbers,
[1:47:34.680 --> 1:47:38.920]  300 and something, 400 and something, 500 and something. And in a PBS interview he did
[1:47:38.920 --> 1:47:45.720]  right before he died in France. It was interviewing his garden. There's video of it. I mean, he
[1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:51.320]  said it constantly, just like Prince Philip in books and Reuters articles in German newspapers
[1:47:51.320 --> 1:47:56.120]  said I want to come back reincarnated as a virus to kill 80% of the population. So, so
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:47:59.160]  there's a lot of different quotes, but you're absolutely right. And then you've got Walter
[1:47:59.160 --> 1:48:04.280]  Cronkite saying it. You've got Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with his daddy heading up
[1:48:04.280 --> 1:48:08.240]  Planned Parenthood, a eugenics organization. And from my research, what I cover in in-game
[1:48:08.240 --> 1:48:13.200]  and I want to get your take on this, sir, you had eugenics being the dominant scientific
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:17.160]  craze a hundred years ago. It's what founded a lot of institutions here. The Rockefellers
[1:48:17.160 --> 1:48:25.960]  funded it in England, in Germany, the Kaiser Wilhelm scientific research group that did
[1:48:25.960 --> 1:48:31.520]  all of that. And they just went into being crypto or secret eugenicists. And so that's
[1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:35.600]  kind of their rationale and excuse. And we have the UT professor, Dr. Priyanka, saying
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:41.920]  kill 90% of us, made national news. When you go to these biology departments, this is the
[1:48:41.920 --> 1:48:46.400]  majority view. And when he was given an award, the Texas Academy of Sciences was in the newspaper.
[1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:52.320]  He got a 95% standing ovation. I had the reporter on. He said it was like being in a nightmare
[1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:58.000]  science fiction movie. They had tears of joy with a three minute standing ovation when
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:03.960]  he projected red skulls on a wall and said, I can't wait till Ebola kills 90% of people.
[1:49:03.960 --> 1:49:08.840]  Yeah. And it keeps saying that Adolf Hitler is something we have to worry about. No,
[1:49:08.840 --> 1:49:14.880]  we have to worry about Adolf Hitler mentality, which is what these people have. Can you specifically
[1:49:14.880 --> 1:49:22.000]  get into more of what their master plan will be like from your deep study? It's very simple.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:27.480]  Total government and then suppression. Suppression of anybody who wants to be free. Suppression
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:34.000]  of anybody who wants to protect his own home with his own weapons, certainly that. Rationing
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:39.360]  cards. You can't get food unless you submit to the government's regulations and you have
[1:49:39.360 --> 1:49:46.600]  the card to prove it. You know, the business of the mark of the beast, it doesn't necessarily
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:50.800]  have to be on your forehead. It could be in your pocket. You must have something like
[1:49:50.800 --> 1:49:57.080]  that. We're in very, very interesting times to put it very mildly. But I believe that
[1:49:57.080 --> 1:50:02.520]  this can be turned around. I believe that this whole business of the race towards tyranny,
[1:50:02.520 --> 1:50:07.360]  the race towards total government can be stopped. And it's going to be stopped in our country
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:13.400]  through the House of Representatives. People to realize that the House of Representatives
[1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:18.800]  has the power of the purse. And if we get back to having enough men and women in the
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:23.520]  House of Representatives who not only swear an oath to the Constitution, but abide by
[1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:28.560]  their oath, then our country can start to climb out of this mess we're in. And we can
[1:50:28.560 --> 1:50:37.680]  get back to being a good old country again. You're absolutely right. And incidentally,
[1:50:37.680 --> 1:50:42.920]  they have introduced a bill. They already have the Real ID Act, you know, for the National
[1:50:42.920 --> 1:50:46.480]  ID card. They've introduced a bill. And I've seen Homeland Security speak to this, where
[1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:50.440]  you're going to have this National ID card, even if it's a state card will be federally
[1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:54.680]  approved. We're going to come back and discuss this to basically buy and sell. And they're
[1:50:54.680 --> 1:50:58.440]  going to sneak that through the national sales tax. We'll break that down and talk about
[1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:02.200]  Obama will make a return.
[1:51:02.200 --> 1:51:05.920]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political
[1:51:05.920 --> 1:51:10.040]  problems facing the U.S. and the world. And for the first time in their lives, they are
[1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:15.440]  feeling the need for preparedness. Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing
[1:51:15.440 --> 1:51:20.560]  the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years. Ready Reserve is the manufacturer,
[1:51:20.560 --> 1:51:24.720]  unlike other companies that just broker canned foods. Ready Reserve controls the quality
[1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:29.240]  from start to finish with doubly-nammeled cans and nitrogen packaging. When purchasing
[1:51:29.240 --> 1:51:33.840]  from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices. Other companies
[1:51:33.840 --> 1:51:38.560]  are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business
[1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:42.560]  days. Many companies do not even offer a catalog. We will be more than happy to see
[1:51:42.560 --> 1:52:07.400]  you.
[1:52:07.400 --> 1:52:12.000]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:17.240]  us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is
[1:52:17.240 --> 1:52:22.000]  working for the best interest of the American people. Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah,
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:32.800]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[1:52:32.800 --> 1:52:39.800]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world
[1:52:39.800 --> 1:52:46.400]  government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real
[1:52:46.400 --> 1:52:53.280]  agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super

[1:54:03.520 --> 1:54:16.800]  We've got him with us for another 20 minutes. We have another guest joining us on the program.
[1:54:16.800 --> 1:54:22.960]  He's John McManus, President of the John Burt Society in Studio, and he's going to be speaking
[1:54:22.960 --> 1:54:26.240]  here in Texas. For those that just joined us, where are you speaking tonight?
[1:54:26.240 --> 1:54:31.760]  Tonight in San Antonio at the Embassy Suites and Friday night at the Richardson Civic Center
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:35.240]  in Richardson, Texas, right outside Dallas. And there is some room left and a lot of these
[1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:39.420]  sell out. Well, I always like it when they have to open up the wall and put more chairs
[1:54:39.420 --> 1:54:43.720]  in and so forth. So anybody wants to come? Anybody. There's an admission charge. Somebody
[1:54:43.720 --> 1:54:47.880]  got to pay all the airline freight that I... Oh, I understand for the hotel. People have
[1:54:47.880 --> 1:54:51.400]  no idea how much those conference rooms cost. Some of them are out of sight and some of
[1:54:51.400 --> 1:54:54.880]  them are pretty reasonable, but most of them are out of sight. You're right.
[1:54:54.880 --> 1:54:59.040]  Yeah, and of course the hotels are all suffering right now. They've got to make some money
[1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:05.560]  because the business is down and people aren't traveling and a lot of business stuff is being
[1:55:05.560 --> 1:55:09.640]  done by telephone rather than visits and so all of that.
[1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:16.040]  Barack Obama. I mean, this guy is handled by the elite, the most elite of the elite.
[1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:18.560]  Have you seen his birth certificate yet? I haven't.
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:19.560]  No, I haven't.
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:21.400]  No, no. Isn't that amazing, huh?
[1:55:21.400 --> 1:55:22.400]  No.
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:26.160]  He could put an end to all of this speculation by simply producing a birth certificate and
[1:55:26.160 --> 1:55:30.800]  he hasn't done it. I can remember it was about a year ago almost that they discovered
[1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:35.640]  it. He had an aunt living in Boston and she was living in a housing project and she wasn't
[1:55:35.640 --> 1:55:42.200]  illegally here and so forth. And she said on the Boston interview that she was present
[1:55:42.200 --> 1:55:49.880]  at his birth in Kenya and she disappeared. I don't know where she is today.
[1:55:49.880 --> 1:55:55.120]  You know what's amazing is that I have family that, you know, isn't in great financial
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:55:59.560]  stead and I don't make a lot of money, but I try to help them out and, you know, give
[1:55:59.560 --> 1:56:09.480]  them money and things. I can't imagine having a half-brother living in a dirt shed in Kenya.
[1:56:09.480 --> 1:56:15.440]  In Kenya. I mean, this guy could care less about his own family. He's certainly not
[1:56:15.440 --> 1:56:20.080]  going to care about the people of this country. Can you specifically speak to, not caring
[1:56:20.080 --> 1:56:22.400]  about the aunt, not caring about the half-brother?
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:26.480]  Well, it's something that I wouldn't do and you wouldn't do and most decent people wouldn't
[1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:30.960]  do. They would care about their own people and they should. And that's a Christian charity
[1:56:30.960 --> 1:56:36.640]  and that's supposedly in everybody. You should be able to do that. But, you know, there's
[1:56:36.640 --> 1:56:43.800]  so much more about Obama beyond this. Look at his buddy, the bomb-throwing Lou Ayers.
[1:56:43.800 --> 1:56:49.400]  This guy threw bombs at the Pentagon and so forth and somehow he got rehabilitated and
[1:56:49.400 --> 1:56:54.040]  all of a sudden we're forgetting about Reverend Jerome Wright and what he said about goddamn
[1:56:54.040 --> 1:56:58.040]  America and we're not supposed to remember that.
[1:56:58.040 --> 1:57:02.280]  What people would like to do is to say, oh, the John Burt society, there was an anti-Semite
[1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:07.720]  in the John Burt society 43 years ago and when we found out that there was, we gave
[1:57:07.720 --> 1:57:13.320]  him his money back and sent him out. But they didn't say that, you know. It's selective
[1:57:13.320 --> 1:57:20.640]  use of information about people. Obama is, in my view, he's an out-and-out Marxist. Now,
[1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:27.440]  he is a Marxist. A Marxist is somebody who wants economic control over the people. Karl
[1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:33.120]  Marx wrote the Communist Manifesto in 1848 and he and Engels wanted to call it the Socialist
[1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:37.280]  Manifesto at the time but they didn't because there was some screwballs running around saying
[1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:42.040]  that they were Socialists. Yeah, we are all Socialists now. It says Newsweek. So they called
[1:57:42.040 --> 1:57:46.560]  it the Communist Manifesto. But it has been the Bible of every Socialist and every Communist
[1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:52.120]  all along. Now, why do I say that Obama is a Marxist because he wants all of the things
[1:57:52.120 --> 1:57:57.080]  that are in the Communist Manifesto, in the Socialist Manifesto. He wants all of those
[1:57:57.080 --> 1:58:02.880]  things. But this always confuses the low-level liberals. They don't understand that the big
[1:58:02.880 --> 1:58:07.920]  megabanks and Armand Hammer and all of them openly explain, and Carol Quigley at Georgetown
[1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:13.640]  explains, that the ultra-rich use socialism and fascism to vertically integrate power
[1:58:13.640 --> 1:58:19.520]  under their control, then they sit outside and above the nation-states, ruling these
[1:58:19.520 --> 1:58:23.160]  different systems and playing people off against each other. We're going to come back in 70
[1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:28.720]  seconds. I want to go over Obama's real policies and how the president of the John Birch Society
[1:58:28.720 --> 1:58:34.440]  thinks we can basically shoot down this agenda and stop them from bringing in their open-world
[1:58:34.440 --> 1:58:40.200]  government on the ashes of the financial crisis they have created. Stay with us.

[1:58:51.080 --> 1:58:54.680]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to
[1:58:54.680 --> 1:58:58.480]  be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent,
[1:58:58.480 --> 1:59:02.600]  and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have
[1:59:02.600 --> 1:59:06.480]  your own bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care
[1:59:06.480 --> 1:59:10.600]  of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your
[1:59:10.600 --> 1:59:15.080]  family in the final equation but you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift

[2:00:06.920 --> 2:00:14.280]  mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[2:00:14.280 --> 2:00:22.760]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.760 --> 2:00:29.480]  The John Birch Society puts out impeccable information and research. You can argue or
[2:00:29.480 --> 2:00:33.480]  try to disagree with what they think the solution should be, but you can't disagree with the
[2:00:33.480 --> 2:00:38.760]  hard facts. They're almost neurotic about being sticklers to make sure they can prove
[2:00:38.760 --> 2:00:43.720]  everything. So I've always wanted to be very, very accurate information, really some of
[2:00:43.720 --> 2:00:48.240]  the best out there. And they also sell things at cost. I mean, you can get subscriptions
[2:00:48.240 --> 2:00:52.800]  to the magazine that comes biweekly, very inexpensively. These are a dollar apiece, dollars
[2:00:52.800 --> 2:01:00.320]  and cents by John F. McManus, a video presentation, JBS Overview of America, public service edition.
[2:01:00.320 --> 2:01:08.160]  This is powerful information and it's very well presented. And you can simply call 800-JBS-USA-1.
[2:01:08.160 --> 2:01:14.880]  It's 1-800-JBS-USA-1 to a call and order these materials singularly, or I suggest buying
[2:01:14.880 --> 2:01:18.480]  them in bulk so you can get them out and wake people up. That is the key. If we counter
[2:01:18.480 --> 2:01:22.680]  the globalist, their agenda is so unpopular, so criminal, it will fail. But if we just
[2:01:22.680 --> 2:01:27.480]  say, oh, that's the way it is, we're going down a very, very dark road. So 1-800-JBS-USA-1.
[2:01:27.480 --> 2:01:31.320]  Now, you've got to pay a shipping charge. Those are only a dollar apiece. So I tell
[2:01:31.320 --> 2:01:34.520]  people, get three or four or five of each of them and the shipping charge will be the
[2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:38.200]  same. And then you can share them with your friends, your neighbors, and everybody, and
[2:01:38.200 --> 2:01:43.440]  they're good. I've gone on radio shows where people have said, I just watched those videos.
[2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:49.760]  They're the best I've ever seen and I'm very grateful for that. So, okay, well, we were
[2:01:49.760 --> 2:01:50.760]  talking about Obama.
[2:01:50.760 --> 2:01:54.240]  Yes, we were getting into Obama. I wanted to bring up some of his policies. The House
[2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:59.800]  and Senate, the House passed a version that had compulsory service. It was just now taken
[2:01:59.800 --> 2:02:04.640]  out in the Senate, but it says they're setting up a body to look at implementing national
[2:02:04.640 --> 2:02:05.640]  service, youth cores.
[2:02:05.640 --> 2:02:06.640]  Hitler Youth Corps.
[2:02:06.640 --> 2:02:08.640]  Yeah, it's the same thing.
[2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:12.480]  So, and they're in the New York Times saying a 7 million person army, then he's going
[2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:16.920]  to have a private army of 13 million seen and reported knocking on doors. I mean, is
[2:02:16.920 --> 2:02:18.320]  this what we do in free societies?
[2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:23.360]  Well, no, I don't think it's that bad. I don't think 7 million or 13 million. But it's
[2:02:23.360 --> 2:02:24.360]  bad.
[2:02:24.360 --> 2:02:26.000]  No, they said that's their goal. I mean, that's Obama.
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:30.160]  But ultimately, yeah, they probably would want that ultimately, but the legislation,
[2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:34.800]  which is something to oppose, it's there already. It's calling for about a quarter million.
[2:02:34.800 --> 2:02:39.160]  That's bad enough. I don't want to see that. I don't want to see youth cores. I don't want
[2:02:39.160 --> 2:02:40.160]  to see that.
[2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:44.260]  I want to see the American people independent of government. I want to see them limiting
[2:02:44.260 --> 2:02:46.920]  their government with the Constitution of the United States.
[2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:51.360]  You know, get back to the financial side of things. What does the Constitution say about
[2:02:51.360 --> 2:02:58.080]  money? It says Congress shall have power to coin money. And they set up a mint in 1792
[2:02:58.080 --> 2:03:02.560]  to take the people's precious metals, stamped them into coinage. It says to regulate the
[2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:06.360]  value there of, and they did that by having one ounce coins, half ounce coin, the regulated
[2:03:06.360 --> 2:03:11.360]  the value with the purity as well. And a foreign coin. Okay, you can regulate foreign
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:16.040]  coin. What is the Spanish doubloon worth compared to an ounce of silver and the pieces of eight
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:17.040]  and so forth?
[2:03:17.040 --> 2:03:18.040]  That's weights and measures.
[2:03:18.040 --> 2:03:23.080]  And then set up a standard of weights and measures, three feet in the yard, 16 ounces
[2:03:23.080 --> 2:03:27.120]  and a pound and so forth. And that's all the power that was given to the government of
[2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:31.320]  the United States and the Constitution. No power to set up a bank. No power to set up
[2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:35.040]  a Federal Reserve. No power to do all of the kind of things they've been doing for years
[2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:38.640]  and years and years. And they all swear an oath to that Constitution. And I think it's
[2:03:38.640 --> 2:03:42.480]  time for the American people to say, you abide by the oath. Oh, we're going to get somebody
[2:03:42.480 --> 2:03:43.480]  else.
[2:03:43.480 --> 2:03:46.360]  And they've got this one power. And that's the one thing they don't do. They hand that
[2:03:46.360 --> 2:03:50.240]  authority over a private Federal Reserve that tells them you can't look at any of our operations.
[2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:53.840]  I just wanted to show you. See, I was exaggerating. Here's the New York Times National Service
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:59.560]  Bill, clear Senate hurdle. And it says they want 7 million people to engage in. There
[2:03:59.560 --> 2:04:00.560]  it is.
[2:04:00.560 --> 2:04:04.080]  Okay. All right. So that's, that's a little ultimately fourth pair. I mean, they're insane.
[2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:08.160]  This is, this is, I mean, this is Nazi Germany. This is Soviet Russia. They all, they can
[2:04:08.160 --> 2:04:11.960]  call them communists, call them socials, call them fascists. It's always black uniforms
[2:04:11.960 --> 2:04:12.960]  and youth brigades.
[2:04:12.960 --> 2:04:17.600]  That's right. And then of course, that's what happened over in Germany and, and the German
[2:04:17.600 --> 2:04:21.320]  people took a long time to recover from it. And now they've got people like Angela Merkel
[2:04:21.320 --> 2:04:23.800]  over there and she's bringing them back into it.
[2:04:23.800 --> 2:04:28.880]  Well, that's my issue is they are trying this. It shows us who they are.
[2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:34.360]  Yeah. Well, who are they? Well, they are people who want world control. They are members of
[2:04:34.360 --> 2:04:37.920]  the council on foreign relations. They have ties to the Bilderberger movement. They have
[2:04:37.920 --> 2:04:42.000]  ties to the trilateral commission. They have ties to the club of Rome and they have ties
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:46.720]  to, uh, some of them went to colleges that had the skull and bone society and so forth.
[2:04:46.720 --> 2:04:49.360]  And let me make this point again, we got a break.
[2:04:49.360 --> 2:04:52.800]  Final second, we'll do seven minutes on the other side. Okay. Uh, absolutely great having
[2:04:52.800 --> 2:04:57.320]  the president of the John Burt society, John McManus in studio with us next time he comes
[2:04:57.320 --> 2:05:00.440]  through Texas and we'll do it. We'll have him back in final segment straight ahead.
[2:05:00.440 --> 2:05:05.360]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non hybrid
[2:05:05.360 --> 2:05:10.200]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:14.000]  non hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold. It's true. Seeds have
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:17.480]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could
[2:05:17.480 --> 2:05:22.040]  even happen again. So our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect
[2:05:22.040 --> 2:05:28.240]  mix of non hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply
[2:05:28.240 --> 2:05:32.800]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[2:05:32.800 --> 2:05:37.480]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[2:05:37.480 --> 2:05:43.120]  acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survival seed bank.com. That's survival seed
[2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:55.600]  bank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[2:05:55.600 --> 2:06:01.800]  non hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survival seed bank.com.
[2:06:01.800 --> 2:06:07.960]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[2:06:07.960 --> 2:06:12.640]  got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[2:06:12.640 --> 2:06:18.120]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[2:06:18.120 --> 2:06:23.000]  the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, fudged since
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:28.120]  day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[2:06:28.120 --> 2:06:35.000]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:41.840]  that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government. This film
[2:06:41.840 --> 2:06:48.960]  documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy
[2:06:48.960 --> 2:06:56.520]  of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at presentplanet.tv.

[2:08:25.880 --> 2:08:32.880]  In closing, John McManus, president of the John Burt society. We've got Patrice O'Neill,
[2:08:32.880 --> 2:08:37.240]  comedian and actor, coming on the show in about eight minutes. The Council on Foreign
[2:08:37.240 --> 2:08:41.040]  Relations 10, 15 years ago wouldn't go on the news. Limbaugh would say it didn't exist.
[2:08:41.040 --> 2:08:43.920]  Now he says they have no power. But now he's having to admit they're setting up global
[2:08:43.920 --> 2:08:47.800]  government so as Glenn Beck, we're seeing what we talk about become mainstream because
[2:08:47.800 --> 2:08:53.360]  it's emerging. But now suddenly every other speaker on Fox and CNN and MSNBC is Council
[2:08:53.360 --> 2:08:57.320]  on Foreign Relations and Geithner comes out. Obama says, oh no, we're not going to have
[2:08:57.320 --> 2:09:01.400]  a global currency in his press conference two nights ago. But then Geithner comes out
[2:09:01.400 --> 2:09:06.000]  yesterday and says, oh yes, we're looking at that. Who is the CFR? What is the global
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:10.240]  currency? What control does this give? And why is it the brass ring thereafter?
[2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:16.680]  After World War I, the United States Senate voted no to membership in the League of Nations.
[2:09:16.680 --> 2:09:20.360]  It was going to be world government. The United States Senate said no. And thank goodness
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:26.080]  they did back then. So at that point, then President Wilson's chief advisor, his guy
[2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:29.880]  who lived in the White House, Edward Mandelhouse, got together with British counterparts. They
[2:09:29.880 --> 2:09:34.880]  set up organizations in their country to promote the goal of world government. The British
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:38.240]  formed the Royal Institute for International Affairs. The Americans formed the Council
[2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:44.040]  on Foreign Relations. House Wilson's chief advisor had written his own book and he said
[2:09:44.040 --> 2:09:50.240]  he was working for socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx. Now, obviously one of his disciples
[2:09:50.240 --> 2:09:54.960]  was Wilson. Another of his disciples was a man in Franklin Roosevelt, whose mother gave
[2:09:54.960 --> 2:10:01.840]  him a copy of House's book in 1920. And when Roosevelt won the nomination of the Democrat
[2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:06.840]  Party in 1932 on a conservative platform, he headed back east, went right past his own
[2:10:06.840 --> 2:10:11.320]  home and went right up to Massachusetts to visit Edward Mandelhouse at his summer home.
[2:10:11.320 --> 2:10:15.680]  The first man he went to see when he got the nomination was a man who said he was working
[2:10:15.680 --> 2:10:21.000]  for socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx. And so Roosevelt did what House wasn't able
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:25.520]  to get accomplished, including getting the United States into the United Nations. So
[2:10:25.520 --> 2:10:30.040]  this is it. The Council on Foreign Relations has been promoting world government ever since
[2:10:30.040 --> 2:10:35.080]  it started. They said so in their magazine for years. We flushed them out over the years,
[2:10:35.080 --> 2:10:38.320]  pointing attention to them. And now they're going around saying, oh, we're just a think
[2:10:38.320 --> 2:10:43.480]  tank. We just have people. So who goes to speak to them? Well, Bernanke did a week ago.
[2:10:43.480 --> 2:10:48.040]  Dyson went yesterday. Everybody who comes to the United States, Gordon Brown from England
[2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:52.440]  came to this country. Where did he go to speak? The Council on Foreign Relations and so on.
[2:10:52.440 --> 2:10:56.800]  So people got to know about this. We have a book called The Shadows of Power that explains
[2:10:56.800 --> 2:11:02.160]  it and explains it well. I see you're advertising Ed Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll
[2:11:02.160 --> 2:11:08.880]  Island. That's the history. I guess that's the graduate course about what the Federal
[2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:15.360]  Reserve is all about. So all of that, American people have to know. Don't rely on your normal
[2:11:15.360 --> 2:11:20.360]  media for the information that you need. You're not going to get it. You have to go to the
[2:11:20.360 --> 2:11:25.400]  alternative media. That's what we are. John Burt society, if it's anything, is an alternative
[2:11:25.400 --> 2:11:31.640]  medium of information. Alex Jones is an alternative medium of information. You keep putting it
[2:11:31.640 --> 2:11:35.520]  out. We'll keep putting it out and we'll get American people enough of them to say finally,
[2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:41.600]  okay, we got to stop this, right? Absolutely. Do you agree, sir, that the New World Order
[2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:46.880]  is attempting to finally bring in open world government and that they're in super high
[2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:52.200]  gear right now? Yes, they are. I mean, I've been frightened over the years by developments.
[2:11:52.200 --> 2:11:56.720]  I'm more frightened about this economic problem than I have been forever. But I'm not saying
[2:11:56.720 --> 2:12:01.200]  it's over. No, in no way. It can be stopped. Well, Kissinger always said they would use
[2:12:01.200 --> 2:12:06.080]  a great crisis to bring in their New World Order. And we have hundreds of quotes published
[2:12:06.080 --> 2:12:09.920]  in their own publications saying they want one rural government. And then all over the
[2:12:09.920 --> 2:12:15.640]  newsstands, it's like we're in Mussolini's Italy or something or Mao's China. And here
[2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:20.240]  in Austin, Texas, there's pictures and photos of Obama and most of the stores. And it's
[2:12:20.240 --> 2:12:25.080]  like he's being worshiped as a savior and he builds himself as anti banker, anti establishment.
[2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:31.600]  Well, absolutely. I mean, here's this magazine. This is Environmental Magazine. One of my
[2:12:31.600 --> 2:12:35.680]  guys was at Whole Foods today buying some food and this is on the newsstand, President
[2:12:35.680 --> 2:12:41.640]  for the Planet. Obama sets a new green agenda. This is nothing but neo feudalism to shut
[2:12:41.640 --> 2:12:45.280]  down the free market because the bankers don't have competition. Well, you get your magazine.
[2:12:45.280 --> 2:12:49.120]  I got mine. This is the new American. I'm the publisher of it. And this is an issue
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:55.520]  that we had Obama's shock on our economics. And it goes into it in detail. This is the
[2:12:55.520 --> 2:12:59.720]  kind of information we put out all the time. I got a team of writers and some researchers
[2:12:59.720 --> 2:13:04.600]  that I think are just hops and they do a great job. They don't just say that this is happening.
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:08.320]  They quote these people. They show exactly what they've said. They show where it's going
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:12.960]  to lead and so forth. So we want people to take a look at the new American magazine in
[2:13:12.960 --> 2:13:16.800]  addition to everything else we do. Absolutely. Give out the website for folks that
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:22.000]  want it. Well, jbs.org. That's very easy. And then you can call and get those DVDs,
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  the overview of America, dollars and cents, 1-800-JBS-USA-1. They only cost a buck a
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:33.400]  piece, but you have to pay a shipping and handling charge. So get a few and share them.
[2:13:33.400 --> 2:13:37.360]  And a lot of people do and they say, wow, how come I never knew this? How come nobody
[2:13:37.360 --> 2:13:42.800]  ever told me before? And so, well, Alex, we're grateful to be able to come and visit with
[2:13:42.800 --> 2:13:46.440]  you. I've been on with the show before, but I've never met you. I've never been in person
[2:13:46.440 --> 2:13:52.080]  and you do exist and so do I. And we'll probably try to do this again.
[2:13:52.080 --> 2:13:55.840]  Absolutely. One more time before you leave as president of the John Berks Society, John
[2:13:55.840 --> 2:14:00.560]  McManus, tell the listeners again where you're speaking.
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:05.720]  Speaking tonight, Thursday at the Embassy Suites in San Antonio and then on Friday night
[2:14:05.720 --> 2:14:11.080]  at the Richardson Civic Center right outside Dallas in Richardson, Texas. Anybody's welcome.
[2:14:11.080 --> 2:14:14.920]  We're glad to have you. You can come. You can ask questions after the program's over.
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:19.320]  I always stay around and a lot of people come up and have questions and we sell the books
[2:14:19.320 --> 2:14:23.200]  and we sell the magazine. We sell the DVDs and so I'll get one last, one last question.
[2:14:23.200 --> 2:14:26.960]  I forgot to ask you, you guys have written a lot about the militarization of law enforcement,
[2:14:26.960 --> 2:14:31.120]  the open announcement of North com. They want to put 20,000 regular combat troops on the
[2:14:31.120 --> 2:14:35.040]  streets of America under presidential decision directive. It basically makes the president
[2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:40.200]  on, you know, all powerful during an emergency and they're now openly saying that they may
[2:14:40.200 --> 2:14:43.160]  use troops against the American people. Can you speak to that briefly?
[2:14:43.160 --> 2:14:47.600]  Well, that would be a total violation of American law, the Posse Convitatus Act and
[2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:53.320]  so many other things. The military is not supposed to be the power, the plaything of
[2:14:53.320 --> 2:14:59.280]  the president and that's what it's become. You look into the Constitution and it says
[2:14:59.280 --> 2:15:03.320]  the Congress shall have power to fund an army but it has to be every second year they have
[2:15:03.320 --> 2:15:08.160]  to review it and the Congress shall have the power to create a navy and there's no restriction.
[2:15:08.160 --> 2:15:12.800]  Why? Well, every second year you got to review the army because they are fearful of a standing
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:17.840]  army. They're fearful of government power having control over the military and the founding
[2:15:17.840 --> 2:15:22.240]  fathers were very fearful of that and everybody else should be. We don't want the military
[2:15:22.240 --> 2:15:28.800]  to be the plaything of the president and that's what it's become. Not only to possibly enforce
[2:15:28.800 --> 2:15:33.120]  government edicts here within our country, but look at all over the world. You know,
[2:15:33.120 --> 2:15:39.400]  we have troops in 130,000, excuse me, 130 different nations, thousands and thousands
[2:15:39.400 --> 2:15:44.640]  of troops all over the world. John Burt society has a simple solution, bring them home and
[2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:48.560]  if you can get them home before midnight that would be soon enough.
[2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:56.040]  Well it's true conservatism, true pro sovereignty and we would definitely I think be down the
[2:15:56.040 --> 2:16:00.200]  tubes already inside the new world order if it wasn't for you guys and I really appreciate
[2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:04.400]  you coming in. Again, in closing, what would the founding fathers think of the police state,
[2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:07.800]  the military being used on the streets, this whole unfolding system?
[2:16:07.800 --> 2:16:12.600]  They'd say no, absolutely not. Constitution says we don't go to war unless there's a declaration
[2:16:12.600 --> 2:16:18.840]  of war and there hasn't been one since December of 1941 when we declared war in Japan because
[2:16:18.840 --> 2:16:22.840]  they bombed us at Pearl Harbor. We didn't declare war in Germany, they declared war
[2:16:22.840 --> 2:16:26.920]  on us because they had a pact with Germany, but we didn't declare war in Korea, it's
[2:16:26.920 --> 2:16:32.200]  still there. It has never been settled. We still got 45,000 troops in Korea. We didn't
[2:16:32.200 --> 2:16:35.800]  declare war in Vietnam, we didn't declare war in Desert Storm, we didn't declare war
[2:16:35.800 --> 2:16:40.400]  against Afghanistan or against Iraq and we shouldn't have been there in the first place,
[2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:44.160]  but anyhow, the constitution, get back to the constitution.
[2:16:44.160 --> 2:16:47.480]  Absolutely, John McManus, president of the JBS, thanks for coming in.
[2:16:47.480 --> 2:16:51.440]  My pleasure. Pleasure to meet you, I appreciate you being here.
[2:16:51.440 --> 2:16:52.440]  That's been a delight.
[2:16:52.440 --> 2:16:53.920]  You bet, good luck on the tour.
[2:16:53.920 --> 2:16:54.920]  Thank you.
[2:16:54.920 --> 2:16:59.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, and I appreciate our next guest holding the last few minutes.
[2:16:59.280 --> 2:17:05.440]  He's all over national television, VH1, you name it, one of the top comedians out there
[2:17:05.440 --> 2:17:10.520]  today, Patrice O'Neill, and the reason I wanted to get him on is I started getting reports
[2:17:10.520 --> 2:17:16.600]  and video clips sent to us, audio clips from some of the biggest radio shows in the country,
[2:17:16.600 --> 2:17:20.760]  of him on there promoting the Obama deception, explaining this isn't even about Obama. It's
[2:17:20.760 --> 2:17:25.480]  pointing out that Obama is owned by the same people and that we better deal with the elite,
[2:17:25.480 --> 2:17:30.160]  and so that's why we're really excited to have him on with us for the rest of the hour.
[2:17:30.160 --> 2:17:32.160]  Patrice O'Neill, thanks for coming on with us.
[2:17:32.160 --> 2:17:33.160]  Thank you, sir.
[2:17:33.160 --> 2:17:34.160]  How are you?
[2:17:34.160 --> 2:17:40.240]  You know what, right before I call, or right before you call me, I got a ring at my door
[2:17:40.240 --> 2:17:46.160]  bell, and it was very unusual, and I got a little nervous because I was up there on
[2:17:46.160 --> 2:17:51.080]  the Alex Jones show, and a strange ring at my door bell happened right at the time when
[2:17:51.080 --> 2:17:57.400]  you called, so I have to get my fear leveled down a little bit.
[2:17:57.400 --> 2:18:00.400]  Oh, don't worry, the new owner's not coming after you for that.
[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:06.120]  We outnumber him a thousand to one. First off, for folks who may not know who you are,
[2:18:06.120 --> 2:18:09.920]  they saw you, but this is radio, they would recognize you from all the different television
[2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:13.680]  programs you're on. Tell us a little bit about yourself. You're awakening to this whole
[2:18:13.680 --> 2:18:17.760]  globalist system, the elite, and why you're out there promoting the Obama deception.
[2:18:17.760 --> 2:18:27.000]  Well, you know, it was, well, you got to be careful in terms of, like how I bumped into
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:33.920]  it, I was watching something else on it, and it kind of, the ad came up for the Obama deception.
[2:18:33.920 --> 2:18:39.560]  You know, I'm really into, thank God for documentaries, you know what I mean? And thank God for the
[2:18:39.560 --> 2:18:44.840]  internet, because if I had to go to these libraries and stuff and just grab a book and
[2:18:44.840 --> 2:18:50.360]  try to, like, cross-reference and learn about this, it would be kind of impossible, right?
[2:18:50.360 --> 2:18:55.840]  So when I went to the Obama deception, the reason why I said, you got to be careful,
[2:18:55.840 --> 2:19:03.160]  I guess, is, like, being black and having anything to say that might be wrong in terms
[2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:09.040]  of Obama is dangerous. You know, you walk around and you go, well, watch this, this,
[2:19:09.040 --> 2:19:14.120]  I saw this documentary, man, the Obama deception, and, you know, as soon as you say that, oh,
[2:19:14.120 --> 2:19:20.120]  what is it all saying, Obama? I go, nah, it's really not even about him. It's about the
[2:19:20.120 --> 2:19:29.320]  presidency altogether. It's about, it's about, like, the, this, this, this New World Order,
[2:19:29.320 --> 2:19:35.880]  and here's the problem. I believe in most things I hear about the New World Order, most
[2:19:35.880 --> 2:19:40.360]  things I hear about the Bilderberg group, most things I hear about the Illuminati, but I try
[2:19:40.360 --> 2:19:48.280]  to come at it because I try to come at it in a way where, if, is that me? What do I
[2:19:48.280 --> 2:19:52.600]  do? We're about to go to break, sir. Stay there. Well, we're going to come back. Plenty
[2:19:52.600 --> 2:19:57.520]  of time to talk. We really appreciate Friso Neal being our guest on with us. We'll be
[2:19:57.520 --> 2:20:01.480]  right back. Stay with us.
[2:20:01.480 --> 2:20:06.000]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:11.160]  what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future. In these troubled times, one of the
[2:20:11.160 --> 2:20:15.240]  most important things your family can have is good health. Some of the contributors to
[2:20:15.240 --> 2:20:20.360]  poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals. It's a documented fact.
[2:20:20.360 --> 2:20:26.440]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and
[2:20:26.440 --> 2:20:31.840]  parasitic infection. Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol
[2:20:31.840 --> 2:20:37.920]  naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with

[2:22:14.880 --> 2:22:20.080]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:22:20.080 --> 2:22:24.360]  of the American people. Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since
[2:22:24.360 --> 2:22:29.440]  day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[2:22:29.440 --> 2:22:36.320]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[2:22:36.320 --> 2:22:39.520]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about
[2:22:39.520 --> 2:22:46.160]  the one world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told,
[2:22:46.160 --> 2:22:53.080]  and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download

[2:23:01.400 --> 2:23:05.720]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people. Unemployment is the highest it's
[2:23:05.720 --> 2:23:11.760]  been in over 30 years. Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up. Everyone
[2:23:11.760 --> 2:23:17.280]  needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying
[2:23:17.280 --> 2:23:20.480]  times. You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper

[2:24:25.160 --> 2:24:36.720]  Okay. Very popular comedian, Matrice O'Neill is online with us. Very gracious to spend
[2:24:36.720 --> 2:24:40.400]  his time with us. I'm going to play a clip of him on opening an Anthony coming in in
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:44.800]  the next segment. One of the most popular shock jock shows and we just appreciate him
[2:24:44.800 --> 2:24:50.120]  getting the word out and having the courage because I saw all these Republicans worshiping
[2:24:50.120 --> 2:24:55.000]  Bush just investing everything in their identities with him. It didn't matter if he tortured
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:59.760]  kids, didn't matter if they lied about WMDs, didn't matter if they destroyed the Bill of
[2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:04.400]  Rights. They were committed to him. Well, then you get the first black president. He's sharp.
[2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:08.680]  He's nice. He says all the right things. I saw his globalist advisors. I knew what was
[2:25:08.680 --> 2:25:12.920]  going on. Then he got in. He went back on everything he said he'd do. And let me tell
[2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:20.760]  you, especially with black folks, you know, the pride, I know as priests was just saying,
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:25.720]  I mean, it takes a lot of courage as K.R.S.1 and Professor Griff and others have said
[2:25:25.720 --> 2:25:33.440]  to try to explain to anybody who voted for Obama that, hey, this guy is suckering you.
[2:25:33.440 --> 2:25:37.640]  So you got interrupted by the break, sir. Please continue with your whole point about
[2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:40.880]  researching the New World Order because you're absolutely right. I used to try to go to the
[2:25:40.880 --> 2:25:44.480]  library and cross-reference everything and it would take hours. Now you can check everything
[2:25:44.480 --> 2:25:46.680]  so quickly. It's just amazing. Please continue.
[2:25:46.680 --> 2:25:54.600]  Yeah, I mean, like, okay, when I was watching the other day, I had watched the Obama deception
[2:25:54.600 --> 2:26:03.440]  and then I watched Obama pick the 64 team for the basketball, for college basketball,
[2:26:03.440 --> 2:26:10.520]  the brackets. And I'm like, this dude is such a dude. Like, you can't not like the guy.
[2:26:10.520 --> 2:26:19.560]  He's like, you know, I like this dude. You know what I mean? And it's not saying, okay,
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:25.240]  I watch your thing and now I completely believe that Obama's the, you know, he's down with
[2:26:25.240 --> 2:26:31.400]  the New World Order. But what your video did is what I like to do is be able to put another
[2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:37.040]  thought process in my head and another way to not only put another thought in my head,
[2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:45.640]  but to actually have a place to think because I would have never thought some of the things
[2:26:45.640 --> 2:26:50.000]  that I think now in terms of I didn't see that video. But what it did, it didn't make
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:55.120]  me go, Alex Jones knows what he's talking about. It made me go, let me cross-reference
[2:26:55.120 --> 2:27:02.760]  the info that you gave in the documentary and get it for yourself and get in some of
[2:27:02.760 --> 2:27:07.040]  these things that Henry Kissinger wrote and some of these, you know, some of these websites
[2:27:07.040 --> 2:27:13.840]  and some of these bills. And I realized that watching your, and I watched the end game
[2:27:13.840 --> 2:27:19.640]  too. So that led me to, it led me from Obama to the end game, then to Zeitgeist and then
[2:27:19.640 --> 2:27:25.400]  to the other things that's out there. But the one thing I realized is there's a mission
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:32.040]  level to all of this in terms of the people. And one of it is, I think that you operate,
[2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:35.960]  and this is not a criticism, this is just for me in this short time trying to learn
[2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:44.800]  about this stuff, that you operate at the same thinking level as say the Bilderberg
[2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:50.680]  group. And what I mean by that is at the same intellectual level, at the same understanding.
[2:27:50.680 --> 2:27:56.080]  It's just that you're on the opposite side of these guys, but you have the understanding
[2:27:56.080 --> 2:28:02.360]  of the revolution and why that started and the understanding of why World War One went
[2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:08.320]  on, why World War Two went on, the conspiracies behind the banking system. And a lot of the
[2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:16.520]  things that dude, I, my brain had the capacity to know, but just never thought to know. My
[2:28:16.520 --> 2:28:23.720]  mind never thought to know that the federal banking system was not a federal system at
[2:28:23.720 --> 2:28:31.440]  all. It's a privately owned bank. That seems very typical to people. I guarantee that people
[2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:36.360]  that listen to your show every day, and you, that's just nothing. But to me, when I found
[2:28:36.360 --> 2:28:43.840]  that out, my brain started to hurt. But sir, sir, I started to look at a, like, give a
[2:28:43.840 --> 2:28:49.560]  give act, you know, HR 1388. And I'm, and I went to info wars and I'm looking for that.
[2:28:49.560 --> 2:28:54.360]  And I'm reading through this manifesto. And it might be that one little part that says
[2:28:54.360 --> 2:29:01.040]  they have to look into mandatory service. And I guess this whole little speech I'm making
[2:29:01.040 --> 2:29:12.640]  now is to say the difficulty, Alex, is how do you get people who don't know, don't even
[2:29:12.640 --> 2:29:17.400]  want to know, because you've got two things to do. Read a, read a bill or go get some
[2:29:17.400 --> 2:29:23.600]  ice cream. This is either you put your full sheet in and learn about this entire system
[2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:30.200]  about like, you're like watching the Obama deception led me to eugenics. Like what eugenics
[2:29:30.200 --> 2:29:35.640]  with the light and then lead me to, you know, stay there, stay there. Patrice, we got a
[2:29:35.640 --> 2:29:39.360]  long segment coming up. We won't be interrupted for about 15 minutes. This is riveting stuff.
[2:29:39.360 --> 2:29:42.680]  I got to have you as a regular guest. If you'll do it. We'll also fire out some of your websites
[2:29:42.680 --> 2:29:47.960]  and contact. Stay there because what you were just saying had my brain making all these
[2:29:47.960 --> 2:29:54.040]  connections. That's how this works. Stay there, sir. We're on the March, the Empire's on

[2:31:05.120 --> 2:31:10.320]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind
[2:31:10.320 --> 2:31:15.800]  of world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely
[2:31:15.800 --> 2:31:20.400]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[2:31:20.400 --> 2:31:25.040]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election. If you have
[2:31:25.040 --> 2:31:30.000]  a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the
[2:31:30.000 --> 2:31:37.960]  program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:31:37.960 --> 2:31:42.680]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents
[2:31:42.680 --> 2:31:49.280]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the

[2:31:56.640 --> 2:32:01.200]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[2:32:01.200 --> 2:32:06.360]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining
[2:32:06.360 --> 2:32:10.880]  high energy and vibrant health. Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at
[2:32:10.880 --> 2:32:16.440]  a pH level of eight or higher. Alchivision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of
[2:32:16.440 --> 2:32:21.400]  the most alkaline ingredients. Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your
[2:32:21.400 --> 2:32:26.280]  water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy. Simply
[2:32:26.280 --> 2:32:31.880]  put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level. Alkalizing
[2:32:31.880 --> 2:32:36.400]  water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of
[2:32:36.400 --> 2:32:41.640]  your body. Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high
[2:32:41.640 --> 2:32:47.240]  pH environment. Order your bottle of alchivision plasma pH drops now by going directly to

[2:33:02.200 --> 2:33:07.920]  So now why is it called the Obama deception? Because because everyone believes that Obama
[2:33:07.920 --> 2:33:15.520]  is going to change the world, but the fact is he's just the next guy in there to keep
[2:33:15.520 --> 2:33:20.560]  everything going. He's just the guy, he's just whatever they need him to do to be. And
[2:33:20.560 --> 2:33:25.080]  they brought up the fact that the last real president we ever had was Kennedy. JFK. And
[2:33:25.080 --> 2:33:28.960]  he was trying to let go, I guess. And guess what happened to him? This whole thing. I
[2:33:28.960 --> 2:33:34.400]  hear a sense of him out. A splitting headache one day. And they said that the only president
[2:33:34.400 --> 2:33:42.360]  that ever stood up to this is no longer with us before he was not supposed to be no longer
[2:33:42.360 --> 2:33:47.720]  with us. And the only one that made it through was Thomas Jefferson.
[2:33:47.720 --> 2:33:50.920]  Really? That early? Like they were pulling those shenanigans?
[2:33:50.920 --> 2:33:55.280]  Yes. Thomas Jefferson is the only one that didn't. They tried to kill him a few times,
[2:33:55.280 --> 2:33:58.480]  but back in the day they didn't have laser beams.
[2:33:58.480 --> 2:34:03.920]  Yeah, you had to hope he was going to sip the arsenic pee that you left by his bedside.
[2:34:03.920 --> 2:34:09.880]  Yeah, the sneaker must get in and blow his head. And he's the only one that stood up
[2:34:09.880 --> 2:34:13.560]  against him that didn't. I didn't even know they tried to kill Thomas
[2:34:13.560 --> 2:34:15.760]  Jefferson. A few times.
[2:34:15.760 --> 2:34:26.040]  All right, we're talking to Patrice O'Neill. Many presidents they tried to kill. It's
[2:34:26.040 --> 2:34:31.800]  clear that they bled George Washington to death and it was a guy that really went after
[2:34:31.800 --> 2:34:37.320]  seven times, was of course Andrew Jackson, but then they killed multiple presidents,
[2:34:37.320 --> 2:34:42.040]  including Kennedy. But sir, where you made me when we're talking to top comedian on
[2:34:42.040 --> 2:34:47.960]  national TV, Patrice O'Neill right now, where you had me really thinking when what you
[2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:51.400]  were saying there is, you're saying on the same intellectual level and it's not that
[2:34:51.400 --> 2:34:56.400]  I'm even smart. Anybody can research history and know this. I'm reading what the globalist
[2:34:56.400 --> 2:35:01.680]  have said, what their own document states. You're right. I see things from their perspective
[2:35:01.680 --> 2:35:07.120]  because I study what they say and do and history. And then once you're from that perspective,
[2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:11.480]  it's kind of like if you're up against a barn door or an elephant or a school bus, whatever
[2:35:11.480 --> 2:35:15.800]  it is. Well, it's yellow, but I can you back up. Oh, that's a school bus. Oh, okay. It's
[2:35:15.800 --> 2:35:22.800]  got gray skin. It's got hair. Kind of smells funny. Oh, wait, it's an elephant. And so
[2:35:22.800 --> 2:35:28.520]  we're just pulling back and seeing what they're really doing. And it's all stated. It's conquering
[2:35:28.520 --> 2:35:32.000]  the world. What are we doing today, Pinky? Same thing we do every day conquering the
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:37.320]  world. That's what Caesar wanted and Hitler wanted and Stalin wanted. And all of these
[2:35:37.320 --> 2:35:41.720]  people over and over again, they try to get this control and dominate. And that's my whole
[2:35:41.720 --> 2:35:47.760]  point is that forget Obama, forget John McCain, forget Bush. If we ever want to get real change,
[2:35:47.760 --> 2:35:53.200]  we have to stop looking at the puppets. We have to look past them to the real power elite
[2:35:53.200 --> 2:35:56.640]  and what they're doing. It's that's why we call it the Obama deception because Obama
[2:35:56.640 --> 2:36:01.440]  himself as they build him up as this messianic leader because he is slick. He is smart. He
[2:36:01.440 --> 2:36:07.800]  is charismatic. He is handsome. He is dynamic. You know, he is a guy's guy. And so he's perfect
[2:36:07.800 --> 2:36:13.320]  bush this little demonic creature who radiates evil. You know, he was not the guy for the
[2:36:13.320 --> 2:36:18.720]  job. But Barack Obama, as Henry Kissinger says in the film, he can bring in their new
[2:36:18.720 --> 2:36:22.440]  world order. And then we go see what Henry Kissinger writes in his own books about what
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:26.320]  a new world order is. It's a world government run by private banking families with carbon
[2:36:26.320 --> 2:36:31.880]  taxes reducing our population numbers by 90% through eugenics. So Patrice O'Neill, come
[2:36:31.880 --> 2:36:37.480]  right back in with me. Yes. Now, just there, right? Alex, right there
[2:36:37.480 --> 2:36:42.040]  is like, I got a, I got a, a family member who's, who's really, he's, he's been into
[2:36:42.040 --> 2:36:48.280]  you for years. And, uh, and we talk about it. And what happens is I'm talking a little
[2:36:48.280 --> 2:36:54.840]  bit out of order and a little bit crazy because it makes you like you learn this thing. It's
[2:36:54.840 --> 2:37:01.240]  almost like learning a new language. I'm 39 years old. And what you said, just there,
[2:37:01.240 --> 2:37:06.040]  the average person, right? Just the average person is going to run for their life because
[2:37:06.040 --> 2:37:12.840]  it's like, I heard somebody the other day say that they refer to Obama as Alex, Alex,
[2:37:12.840 --> 2:37:19.240]  the Alexander the Great. Now, this country doesn't teach history like other countries
[2:37:19.240 --> 2:37:24.760]  do. I mean, America just doesn't teach history on a basic level. So I might have to go someplace
[2:37:24.760 --> 2:37:30.480]  as a, just a normal person who wants to be into learning about conspiracies and learning
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:36.680]  about secret societies. I might have to do something as simple as look up Alexander the
[2:37:36.680 --> 2:37:45.560]  Great. And it seems simple, but it makes your brain, uh, much after like two or three days.
[2:37:45.560 --> 2:37:50.440]  Because it's intense. You're now, you're now dialing into the, to the reality of the world
[2:37:50.440 --> 2:37:57.840]  instead of the matrix like projection. I mean, here's another parallel. I mean, it's like
[2:37:57.840 --> 2:38:02.240]  Neo takes the red pill and he's got to be rehabilitated. He doesn't know what's going
[2:38:02.240 --> 2:38:07.160]  on at first. I mean, once you, but listen, we were all there once. You say you're learning
[2:38:07.160 --> 2:38:11.160]  a new language. You're now going to find as you get deeper into this, that there's all
[2:38:11.160 --> 2:38:14.920]  the stuff you can document and prove. But then there's the government and their operatives
[2:38:14.920 --> 2:38:19.160]  putting out dis info everywhere because they know people are waking up and they set all
[2:38:19.160 --> 2:38:23.400]  these traps and quagmires. Um, so, I mean, it is a bigger world and it will make your
[2:38:23.400 --> 2:38:28.800]  brain hurt, but it also, you know, two things that you'll, you, that your videos did, two
[2:38:28.800 --> 2:38:34.880]  things that it did for me and two subject matters. And they, they covered a lot, but
[2:38:34.880 --> 2:38:39.240]  two that were very important to me in terms of learning, in terms of getting my mind going
[2:38:39.240 --> 2:38:43.640]  away. I need the more and more about this. One is the banking system, but the history
[2:38:43.640 --> 2:38:48.240]  of how to bake in system work, something I've never, ever, I just say how to bank the bank
[2:38:48.240 --> 2:38:54.720]  as a place to put your money. I barely understand it. It's, it's the whole system is shocking.
[2:38:54.720 --> 2:38:59.880]  The second thing that it opened my head to, and this is, this goes into more like when
[2:38:59.880 --> 2:39:06.200]  you start talking this, this is where people can get scared is eugenics. And, and when
[2:39:06.200 --> 2:39:11.160]  I, I, and I'm listening to it and it's here to the deception. And I think it might have
[2:39:11.160 --> 2:39:15.320]  been the end game or it could have been by guys either with one of those, uh,
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:20.520]  Oh, no, no. Side guys is actually on the, that, that's the, well, what the side guys
[2:39:20.520 --> 2:39:24.640]  does, he's now repudiated the 911 truth movement, the New York times. And he actually wants
[2:39:24.640 --> 2:39:29.720]  this global government utopia and this engineered society. No, it's, it's in game that covers
[2:39:29.720 --> 2:39:36.560]  the eugenics, which is, which is the operating system of the new world order and why they're
[2:39:36.560 --> 2:39:41.320]  putting AIDS virus in the vaccines. Well, Alex, and that's what I was going to say this
[2:39:41.320 --> 2:39:46.880]  thing. And, and here's what I have about a circle of two people that we, we talk heavy
[2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:56.360]  about this is it seems like high on the list of, of agenda in this, in, in this world is
[2:39:56.360 --> 2:40:03.440]  the population is getting rid of people. And that's the thing that sounds like it's a movie.
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:11.160]  But I read the, the, the, the, the, the manifesto that Kissinger wrote like in 74 that just
[2:40:11.160 --> 2:40:16.120]  underlined all the ways we need to get rid of people by manipulating these countries.
[2:40:16.120 --> 2:40:21.240]  And here, here's a couple hundred dollars, kill all your people, dude, it, it, it just
[2:40:21.240 --> 2:40:26.600]  makes your head go, what? Like, so, so when I'm watching your documentary, what I'll do
[2:40:26.600 --> 2:40:30.880]  is go, look, I can't just go, okay, this is gospel. I'm going to have to go to the thing,
[2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:39.360]  but it's all there. You go to, you just put Kissinger and population, uh, decretion or
[2:40:39.360 --> 2:40:45.440]  population control and that thing will come up and you read it and you have to sit down
[2:40:45.440 --> 2:40:52.840]  and take a deep breath and make some tea and read it and go, holy Jesus, they're trying
[2:40:52.840 --> 2:41:00.200]  to get rid of people is part of the agenda. But how do you get people on just a basic
[2:41:00.200 --> 2:41:06.160]  level to go, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's it. It just seems, for me, one of the
[2:41:06.160 --> 2:41:16.000]  things that make me angry about people is how easy we are to just not care. Like Patrice
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:21.240]  move on. Well, Patrice, you were talking about State Department memorandum 200, where they
[2:41:21.240 --> 2:41:25.120]  take IMF and World Bank money and say, if you want this money, you've got to reduce
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:29.160]  your population by half. And then you talk to the general public, they go, Oh, everybody
[2:41:29.160 --> 2:41:33.080]  knows there's too many people. They've been taught that and see that's the globalist
[2:41:33.080 --> 2:41:41.680]  excuse. That's crazy. Exactly. So, so then you understand why in some African countries,
[2:41:41.680 --> 2:41:46.320]  46% of the people have HIV and then they go do medical tests on them and their virgins.
[2:41:46.320 --> 2:41:50.640]  They've never had sex. They've been injected with it and they've caught the UN doing this
[2:41:50.640 --> 2:41:54.600]  and it's actually all over African newspapers. If you go to Africa and talk to an African
[2:41:54.600 --> 2:41:58.960]  doctor, an African Nobel Prize winner, they're on record. Indian government has caught them
[2:41:58.960 --> 2:42:03.480]  doing this. They caught them adding a hormone to the tetanus vaccine that then sterilizes
[2:42:03.480 --> 2:42:09.480]  the women. That's mainstream news, but you don't see that here. And so it's so dastardly.
[2:42:09.480 --> 2:42:14.680]  But when you see in game and you find out Hitler learned his whole game from the US
[2:42:14.680 --> 2:42:19.400]  and England, and you learn 34 states were sterilizing the women and, you know, grabbing
[2:42:19.400 --> 2:42:23.400]  poor black folks, white folks off the street and sterilizing them. And even in some cases
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:29.280]  killing newborn babies and that the US and England paid China IMF and World Bank money
[2:42:29.280 --> 2:42:33.560]  and that George Bush before he became president, George Bush senior was the ambassador who got
[2:42:33.560 --> 2:42:38.120]  him to sign the agreement for the one child policy. Then you understand the whole world
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:43.480]  is run by people that for lack of a better term are a bunch of Nazis. Now, let me ask
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:51.240]  you this. Let me ask you a question. If you was to have a curriculum, okay, where you
[2:42:51.240 --> 2:42:57.480]  were able to teach anything you needed to teach, you wanted to teach what you're putting
[2:42:57.480 --> 2:43:05.480]  out there now, okay? What would be the one or two or three basic points that you'll get
[2:43:05.480 --> 2:43:12.320]  just normal people that you go, okay, let me try to get them to open up mentally to this
[2:43:12.320 --> 2:43:17.160]  so that we can move on to the next thing. Like, because you have to get people to want
[2:43:17.160 --> 2:43:27.000]  to open up to stage one before you get to injecting, you know, Africa, you know, Africans
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:33.840]  with the AIDS virus, like, which is not unbelievable. You know, to me, it's just not an unbelievable
[2:43:33.840 --> 2:43:39.640]  thing. It's a believable thing. But if I'm operating, say, on the level of a person just
[2:43:39.640 --> 2:43:44.160]  walking down the street, the garbage man or a person that's just going to the mall, how
[2:43:44.160 --> 2:43:50.280]  would I make this as common thinking as Christopher Columbus discovered America? Do you know what
[2:43:50.280 --> 2:43:51.280]  I mean?
[2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:52.280]  Yeah, well, I would explain to them.
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:43:55.280]  In America, you know, just a basic knowledge.
[2:43:55.280 --> 2:43:56.280]  Sure.
[2:43:56.280 --> 2:43:57.280]  This is interested.
[2:43:57.280 --> 2:44:00.880]  Well, that's a huge question and not so I'm not saying the best three things I'm about
[2:44:00.880 --> 2:44:05.120]  to say are the best. I have to think about that long and hard. I would explain to people
[2:44:05.120 --> 2:44:08.960]  that if you're not engaged and you're not informed that you're going to be enslaved,
[2:44:08.960 --> 2:44:13.200]  and I would say you've heard about Hitler, you've heard about Caesar, you know, most
[2:44:13.200 --> 2:44:17.960]  governments are run by thugs and the people are enslaved. And you know about different
[2:44:17.960 --> 2:44:22.480]  tribes, you know, killing their neighbors. That is something that is the norm in human
[2:44:22.480 --> 2:44:27.840]  history, not the exception. And, you know, you know what happened to the Native Americans.
[2:44:27.840 --> 2:44:32.800]  So you're giving them poison blankets with with smallpox to kill them. And that's in
[2:44:32.800 --> 2:44:38.840]  British manuals. They gave their military going back 300 years ago. So that's on record.
[2:44:38.840 --> 2:44:44.560]  And then I would say, here's their own documents. And I would say here is the published university
[2:44:44.560 --> 2:44:51.000]  reports of the British field manuals on how to use bio weapons 340 years ago in the Americas.
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:59.240]  Right. Okay. Then I would say, here is Dr. Henry Kissinger State Department random 200
[2:44:59.240 --> 2:45:03.360]  where they state this and then you can go to the university websites, official government
[2:45:03.360 --> 2:45:07.880]  libraries, and it's real. I'd say, okay, you've been faced with this one document. Then I'd
[2:45:07.880 --> 2:45:13.960]  say now who is Obama's main advisor and who does the CFR Braggs commands the national
[2:45:13.960 --> 2:45:18.400]  security council. And that's Henry Kissinger. And then they'll say, Oh, I don't want to
[2:45:18.400 --> 2:45:22.960]  hear that conspiracy stuff. You just got to move on to people that want to hear the truth.
[2:45:22.960 --> 2:45:26.880]  People that want to be involved. People that want to be woken up. But I would also, you
[2:45:26.880 --> 2:45:27.880]  know, use contemporary.
[2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:33.360]  But what about the, see, I guess, ultimately, it was a loaded question. And I'm not putting
[2:45:33.360 --> 2:45:39.600]  myself in, but what about it? I don't want to offend anybody on this one, but what about
[2:45:39.600 --> 2:45:48.400]  dummies? What about, how about, you know, secret societies and conspiracy for dummies
[2:45:48.400 --> 2:45:55.080]  for people that just will go out, you know, if I don't want to hear it, I have many times
[2:45:55.080 --> 2:46:00.160]  I have many times thought, but actually I think they on the copyright to that, but people
[2:46:00.160 --> 2:46:04.240]  have done online videos that, you know, a different variants of the new world order
[2:46:04.240 --> 2:46:11.520]  for dummies. And, and, and it explains it very, very simply to people. And the most
[2:46:11.520 --> 2:46:14.800]  important thing is to say, do you know why your standard of living is dropping? Because
[2:46:14.800 --> 2:46:19.440]  the globalist want to bankrupt everybody so that we have to be dependent on welfare or
[2:46:19.440 --> 2:46:25.160]  institutionalized or within their system so they can then carry out social engineering,
[2:46:25.160 --> 2:46:29.520]  have the CPS kidnap your kids, do medical experiments on them. That's all admitted.
[2:46:29.520 --> 2:46:34.920]  This is slavery. We're being put on plantations. We're being put on reservations, compact control
[2:46:34.920 --> 2:46:39.800]  grids. And then if the dummies don't want to listen, you know, you got to move on. I
[2:46:39.800 --> 2:46:42.040]  mean, I talk about the revolutionary war was one by 5%.
[2:46:42.040 --> 2:46:47.200]  But you need the revolution. You need dummies because what, what you're talking and what
[2:46:47.200 --> 2:46:53.200]  it, what the only thing I see that could happen that could possibly changes is, is understanding
[2:46:53.200 --> 2:46:57.680]  why this country fought. And it was like, basically, look, we might as well fight because
[2:46:57.680 --> 2:47:05.800]  we're enslaved by British money. And, and ultimately it's like, you need the, the, the,
[2:47:05.800 --> 2:47:11.520]  the lowest level of people like on the feudal system, you need the masses to go. I feel
[2:47:11.520 --> 2:47:14.960]  so, I think we're so confused now.
[2:47:14.960 --> 2:47:15.960]  I agree, but here's the problem.
[2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:20.240]  It's not clear. Like it's not clear to the people on the bottom that I mean, here's
[2:47:20.240 --> 2:47:21.240]  the problem.
[2:47:21.240 --> 2:47:22.240]  Stand up.
[2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:26.720]  Here's the problem. The globalist are masters at creating the crisis. They create the banking
[2:47:26.720 --> 2:47:31.880]  crisis, their own documents, say by design, then they offer the scared masses. The very
[2:47:31.880 --> 2:47:35.600]  bankers that did it say, look, we're going to punish AIG and they're going to punish
[2:47:35.600 --> 2:47:40.080]  the little CEO for 10 million bucks instead of the shareholders who just made a billion
[2:47:40.080 --> 2:47:41.080]  a piece.
[2:47:41.080 --> 2:47:42.080]  Right.
[2:47:42.080 --> 2:47:47.920]  And so they're always masquerading and doing sophisticated lies and saying, we'll fix the
[2:47:47.920 --> 2:47:52.840]  bankers, we'll create a world government run by them. You have to get the public to
[2:47:52.840 --> 2:47:58.000]  stop being as trusting. And you first got to explain to them that both parties are controlled
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:01.080]  in England and in the U S and in Europe and everywhere else, or they'll keep doing this
[2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:02.080]  bait and switch.
[2:48:02.080 --> 2:48:06.400]  Look, in four to eight years when folks figure out Obama was a bad guy, it'll all be, as
[2:48:06.400 --> 2:48:11.160]  I keep saying, blamed on him. We have to stop having it be blamed on Obama or Bush as bad
[2:48:11.160 --> 2:48:16.280]  as they are and start blaming it on the elite who are always there. They bring new dummies
[2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:20.120]  in, they bring new fronts in, and then they move them out and we've got to stop that.
[2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:23.600]  That's the key. We got to stop looking at the puppets and start looking at the puppet
[2:48:23.600 --> 2:48:28.560]  masters. And until we get people to have that revelation, nothing's going to change. It's
[2:48:28.560 --> 2:48:29.560]  going to get worse.
[2:48:29.560 --> 2:48:36.040]  Now, here's something I'm not clear on in terms of the Obama deception. Now, is it possible
[2:48:36.040 --> 2:48:44.760]  that, this is the thing I'm battling, is it possible for Obama or any president to not
[2:48:44.760 --> 2:48:50.400]  know what situation they're in before they get in? Or if you're even running for president,
[2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:56.960]  you full well know what's, what's, what you're asked to do and what you need to do by the
[2:48:56.960 --> 2:48:57.960]  society.
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:49:04.080]  I have the answer to that question. There have been a few presidents who were conned
[2:49:04.080 --> 2:49:08.240]  by the elite to believe world government was sweet and loving and good. Woodrow Wilson,
[2:49:08.240 --> 2:49:12.800]  top professor, wrote the book, The New World Order. These bankers handled him. He thought
[2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:17.160]  bringing in the Federal Reserve was good. Then before he died, he wrote letters. This is
[2:49:17.160 --> 2:49:21.880]  public that I've been conned. I've been, you know, this, this is a takeover. And then
[2:49:21.880 --> 2:49:25.720]  they poisoned him. He had a stroke and then he was bedridden and died. So they did probably
[2:49:25.720 --> 2:49:29.560]  kill Woodrow Wilson. And that's on record. If you want to go research it, he was present
[2:49:29.560 --> 2:49:37.040]  and then on a train. But the point is that's a guy that woke up. Kennedy was the same thing.
[2:49:37.040 --> 2:49:42.040]  His dad was handling him. Supposedly had control of him. It was establishment mafia. Then his
[2:49:42.040 --> 2:49:46.800]  dad had a stroke, couldn't talk. His boys got out of control. They, as the establishment
[2:49:46.800 --> 2:49:54.440]  killed him. Obama is the super class of puppet. He is actually very intelligent like Clinton,
[2:49:54.440 --> 2:49:59.280]  probably smarter than Clinton. You know, frighteningly intelligent, you know, genius
[2:49:59.280 --> 2:50:06.200]  level, a genius level actor just has a lot of style and grace. I mean, it's all clear.
[2:50:06.200 --> 2:50:10.960]  He's an amazing person. That's why he's so devilish. I know he knows all of it. His
[2:50:10.960 --> 2:50:16.680]  mother worked for Geithner's dad at the top foundation. He's, I mean, this guy is, this
[2:50:16.680 --> 2:50:24.280]  guy is above Hitler caliber of slick. Okay. I'm telling you, he is the one. This is the
[2:50:24.280 --> 2:50:28.780]  guy they're going to try everything with. Right here, I've got this magazine, president
[2:50:28.780 --> 2:50:33.560]  of the world, president of the planet. So I'm telling you, this, this is, he is the
[2:50:33.560 --> 2:50:39.360]  one. Does that answer your question? He is fully involved in it. He loves betraying.
[2:50:39.360 --> 2:50:44.840]  He loves deceiving. He is, he is super dangerous. Does that answer the question?
[2:50:44.840 --> 2:50:52.360]  Yeah, that answers what I asked. Is that, is that more get off the phone on music? We
[2:50:52.360 --> 2:50:54.720]  got more time on them. Yeah, stay there. Can you stay with us some more?
[2:50:54.720 --> 2:50:58.720]  Yeah, man. I like this. This is amazing. You're also agreed to go on with Burma's

[2:52:01.840 --> 2:52:07.760]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[2:52:07.760 --> 2:52:13.960]  got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just
[2:52:13.960 --> 2:52:19.640]  as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[2:52:19.640 --> 2:52:24.600]  the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, fudged since
[2:52:24.600 --> 2:52:29.760]  day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[2:52:29.760 --> 2:52:36.640]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[2:52:36.640 --> 2:52:41.880]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film

[2:52:56.600 --> 2:53:03.520]  The Obama deception, the people strike back. You worry. You see the signs and worry about
[2:53:03.520 --> 2:53:07.840]  the future. You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages. How to be prepared while
[2:53:07.840 --> 2:53:12.040]  preserving your sanity. Your answer may be at hand. Author Linda Runyon lived off the
[2:53:12.040 --> 2:53:16.760]  land isolated from civilization. She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will
[2:53:16.760 --> 2:53:21.200]  be plenty of free food all over God's green earth. Perhaps the only sane insurance is
[2:53:21.200 --> 2:53:26.360]  knowledge of wild edible plants. The cost of learning is minimal. Wild food grows everywhere
[2:53:26.360 --> 2:53:30.680]  and you will see it everywhere. It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern
[2:53:30.680 --> 2:53:31.680]  diets.

[2:53:58.520 --> 2:54:27.840]  knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:33.440]  Trees, let me ask you questions though. Again, the courage issue of giving copies of the
[2:54:33.440 --> 2:54:42.320]  film and links to it, to big talk show hosts going on shows, discussing it. In your opinion,
[2:54:42.320 --> 2:54:47.560]  what is the best way to specifically reach out to one of Obama's strongest bases, African
[2:54:47.560 --> 2:54:52.280]  Americans, and how are you doing that?
[2:54:52.280 --> 2:54:58.360]  The toughest thing is this, let's take your show or Fox, if I go on Fox or I go on a show
[2:54:58.360 --> 2:55:05.840]  like this, it's different from going on Open Anthony because we can talk about it and it's
[2:55:05.840 --> 2:55:10.920]  always going to be humor. It's always going to be some humor involved and the seriousness
[2:55:10.920 --> 2:55:18.840]  is even has humor somewhere floating around in it because it's talking to a different
[2:55:18.840 --> 2:55:24.440]  kind of listener. So when I bring that up on this show, it really is like bringing it
[2:55:24.440 --> 2:55:29.200]  to a person that's not an Info Warrior. It's like, okay, we're going to talk about this
[2:55:29.200 --> 2:55:33.640]  monkey that killed the attack this lady in Connecticut and I'm going to go, hey man,
[2:55:33.640 --> 2:55:38.520]  you know, I watched this thing called the Obama deception. Now Anthony, who, he's not
[2:55:38.520 --> 2:55:43.760]  a conspiracy guy, like he's the other side and we'll go at it, you know, and it'll be
[2:55:43.760 --> 2:55:49.400]  fun and it'll be funny, but it also be dead serious. But the people will go, let me just
[2:55:49.400 --> 2:55:55.240]  check this out. You know, let me go look at this. Let me go check this out. So it's more
[2:55:55.240 --> 2:56:01.520]  of a, that's why I was joking about somebody knocking on my door because it's more of a
[2:56:01.520 --> 2:56:08.280]  kind of nerve wracking thing coming on your show because you are serious. You know, I'm
[2:56:08.280 --> 2:56:12.840]  pretty much a layman at it, but I'm into it. I'm into it. I mean, I'm one of those guys
[2:56:12.840 --> 2:56:20.600]  that no matter how many different shows I see about where they make a, a jello bust
[2:56:20.600 --> 2:56:27.160]  of JFK and shoot it to make you think that it could have happened like this. I'm a grassy
[2:56:27.160 --> 2:56:31.840]  no conspiracy guy, by the way, they, by the way, they staged all that incorrectly, that
[2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:32.840]  particular show.
[2:56:32.840 --> 2:56:37.160]  That's what I'm saying. I watch it and if they, if they stage it correctly, I'm like,
[2:56:37.160 --> 2:56:44.400]  oh, come on, I'm not falling for it. And I'm just, I'm a guy and black people in general
[2:56:44.400 --> 2:56:50.440]  are leaning very much towards, towards your side. Here's the problem. And this is what
[2:56:50.440 --> 2:56:57.760]  you had in your, in your, in your documentary, Obama's black. That is the, that's the game
[2:56:57.760 --> 2:57:03.840]  that was a tough one. Now if it was, if it was a Bush or let's say McCain one, you got
[2:57:03.840 --> 2:57:10.360]  about 40 million people on your side and not saying that, you know, black people are just
[2:57:10.360 --> 2:57:15.760]  going to follow like bugs. It's just the fact that look, the, the image, and I've always
[2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:20.880]  said this even before I started getting into this stuff. Obama, to me, was going to be
[2:57:20.880 --> 2:57:28.960]  essentially a, a, a, a, like a symbol. It's just, if you're black in this country, you
[2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:35.120]  just want to see the black president, even if he's not a comp in black or Harlem black,
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:39.880]  he's just black skin, which tells you it's just, we just want to see it. And I was one,
[2:57:39.880 --> 2:57:44.720]  I just want to see the black president, but that's what's so sad about it, whatever, but
[2:57:44.720 --> 2:57:50.760]  that, but that's what's so sad about it. It'd be great if we had somebody who was anti-corruption
[2:57:50.760 --> 2:57:54.440]  and was for real, it was black, but we all know whether he was black or white. If he
[2:57:54.440 --> 2:57:58.240]  was really against the globalist, they would have a big scandal or they would kill him.
[2:57:58.240 --> 2:58:03.280]  And so that's all I'm trying to say to people is don't get suckered. I mean, it's just so
[2:58:03.280 --> 2:58:04.280]  frustrating and I understand.
[2:58:04.280 --> 2:58:08.400]  But you know, Alex, this is, this is what I'm saying about, this is what I'm saying
[2:58:08.400 --> 2:58:14.440]  about operating at the level that all of this is happening. I'm in the middle. Like I want
[2:58:14.440 --> 2:58:21.760]  to be at your knowledge level to just reference things that easily. What I'm saying about,
[2:58:21.760 --> 2:58:28.440]  there's never been a reason for black people to be deeply into what this government, we
[2:58:28.440 --> 2:58:34.040]  had an instinctual feel, an instinct that this country is against us.
[2:58:34.040 --> 2:58:37.320]  Taylor, stay there, stay there. Do five more minutes with me. I want you to come back and
[2:58:37.320 --> 2:58:41.200]  say that because that's important. Stay with us.

[2:58:51.360 --> 2:58:55.000]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to
[2:58:55.000 --> 2:58:59.400]  be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food
[2:58:59.400 --> 2:59:03.200]  and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a red line if you have your own
[2:59:03.200 --> 2:59:07.000]  bread. You'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your

[2:59:54.280 --> 3:00:11.960]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:11.960 --> 3:00:16.520]  Final segment with our guest. We really appreciate Patrice O'Neill joining us. He's on the Jason
[3:00:16.520 --> 3:00:21.960]  Burmish, I think tomorrow night or the next night? Yeah, tomorrow night. The info warrior
[3:00:21.960 --> 3:00:26.680]  from 9 to midnight will be on for an hour then and to hear more from him. This is his awakening.
[3:00:26.680 --> 3:00:30.560]  He's got the courage, guts is enough, smart guy. He's looking at this and he's asking
[3:00:30.560 --> 3:00:35.360]  the same question I'm asking. How do you reach out to these white yuppies or black folks
[3:00:35.360 --> 3:00:39.600]  whoever because they're going to think you're saying, no, I want McCain. No, we're saying
[3:00:39.600 --> 3:00:44.320]  it's like a used car salesman trying to sell you two lemons. One of them's got a better
[3:00:44.320 --> 3:00:50.120]  paint job. And all we're saying is you don't want to buy any car off this lot. You want
[3:00:50.120 --> 3:00:54.480]  to get to the real issues. And black folks I've always found have been the biggest hardcore
[3:00:54.480 --> 3:00:57.760]  fans of this radio show because they've been screwed a lot. They know about the man. They
[3:00:57.760 --> 3:01:02.640]  know about corruption. And now a lot of black fans I have are saying, yeah, Alex, we know
[3:01:02.640 --> 3:01:06.880]  you're right. And he is lying about stuff. But still, he's not bad. Alex, he's not bad.
[3:01:06.880 --> 3:01:10.560]  Fine. Obama, let's just say he's a wonderful guy, which he's not. He's very evil. I'll
[3:01:10.560 --> 3:01:14.760]  tell you right now. I've studied him very slick, very wicked. And he's betraying people.
[3:01:14.760 --> 3:01:18.400]  But how do we then reach out? But finish up the point is I think what I got from earlier
[3:01:18.400 --> 3:01:23.600]  is you're saying you're just going to plant seeds with people and get them to start thinking.
[3:01:23.600 --> 3:01:26.720]  So as they get betrayed more and more, they wake up, say that in your own words and finish
[3:01:26.720 --> 3:01:31.360]  up what you were saying about black folks understanding betrayal. Yeah, that's the thing
[3:01:31.360 --> 3:01:36.240]  is like right now, can you imagine all this time where you feel like you're in some kind
[3:01:36.240 --> 3:01:42.160]  of fight? And and you've never had a representative for the for your fight. Now you have one.
[3:01:42.160 --> 3:01:48.240]  It was easy to say that the government was this and that when it wasn't your own anyway,
[3:01:48.240 --> 3:01:52.760]  we've never felt a part of it. Now, for some way, and you got to understand, you know,
[3:01:52.760 --> 3:01:56.240]  you have to have the understanding of the fact that if you don't know politics and you
[3:01:56.240 --> 3:02:00.960]  don't know things like that, you may think that now is the black president. Now it's
[3:02:00.960 --> 3:02:07.280]  on there's some white people think that too. But ultimately, black people, the toughest
[3:02:07.280 --> 3:02:12.800]  thing in terms of being a black person is to is to actually have a different opinion
[3:02:12.800 --> 3:02:19.360]  than the the predominant black black community and to stand and say something even slightly
[3:02:19.360 --> 3:02:25.280]  like like on stage, I say he's he's black, but he ain't Compton black, he ain't black
[3:02:25.280 --> 3:02:32.800]  black. He ain't he ain't a dude from Chicago that that he represents. He's he's an African.
[3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:37.360]  Matter of fact, Africans take him in more than black people out of black. You don't know that.
[3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:43.920]  And the thing is, is how do you it is like, because I'm a comic, I get to introduce people
[3:02:43.920 --> 3:02:50.720]  to that in a way where they don't have to listen to it. They don't have to they can laugh at it.
[3:02:50.720 --> 3:02:56.000]  So you can do two things with what I do. You can laugh at it because I said it funny, or you can
[3:02:56.000 --> 3:03:01.520]  you can go that's interesting. Let me go check that out. All right. That's what I'm trying to do.
[3:03:01.520 --> 3:03:07.440]  And that's it's very difficult for someone black is to stand up and go it's even to say Al
[3:03:07.440 --> 3:03:14.320]  Sharpton is is you're not saying Al Sharpton and you're black is because he represents black
[3:03:14.320 --> 3:03:21.520]  in a in a place that people feel is against black people. But what I say is that we're all
[3:03:22.160 --> 3:03:26.960]  one thing and let me finish it and I know kind of all place. But one thing I notice about people
[3:03:26.960 --> 3:03:33.520]  who get killed in this world. Nobody who ever creates confusion and keeps people
[3:03:34.480 --> 3:03:41.200]  angry at each other and keeps people Malcolm X kept people separate. He lived a very happy life
[3:03:41.200 --> 3:03:47.040]  when he saw that bringing people together and bringing everyone into some type of knowledge.
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:54.000]  He was killed. Don be the same way. Martin Luther King the same way Jesus the same way.
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:04:01.360]  It seems like when you are a person who pushes confusion and pushes anger and makes people
[3:04:01.360 --> 3:04:06.320]  separate and makes people think that it's a system that's against black and against.
[3:04:06.320 --> 3:04:12.480]  It's a system that's against the masses. The masses are to stay confused. And if you're ever
[3:04:12.480 --> 3:04:17.120]  to bring light to the masses that's when your life's in danger. You know when when people
[3:04:17.120 --> 3:04:22.160]  who are at the bottom start to go wait a minute hold on. Let's find out where the door is or the
[3:04:22.160 --> 3:04:27.440]  person at the top. Let's we're with this Bilderberg group with this Illuminati. Once that stops
[3:04:27.440 --> 3:04:33.840]  starts to be real then I think I think this is this will be a bigger movement than it is
[3:04:33.840 --> 3:04:41.280]  because again now it's where I'm sitting. I'm in the middle. I'm intelligent but I'm not informed
[3:04:41.280 --> 3:04:45.840]  with all of this. But you're getting informed. You know what Patrice we've got another guest
[3:04:45.840 --> 3:04:49.200]  coming on. I know you're busy. I don't want to keep you much longer. A quick three minute break.

[3:06:04.800 --> 3:06:10.400]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force
[3:06:10.400 --> 3:06:16.640]  that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception
[3:06:16.640 --> 3:06:21.600]  completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:06:21.600 --> 3:06:27.280]  Well Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue
[3:06:27.280 --> 3:06:32.880]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group
[3:06:32.880 --> 3:06:39.280]  of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism. It's not about left or right,
[3:06:39.280 --> 3:06:46.160]  it's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told
[3:06:46.160 --> 3:06:53.360]  and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it

[3:08:06.240 --> 3:08:23.920]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:08:23.920 --> 3:08:45.120]  Brian Garrish, former naval officer and anti-submarine warfare expert. He's quoted in an article on the group in England similar to what Obama's set up. It's like a Stasi force and you'll notice they say they're recruiting 60,000 people to spy on their neighbors to look in their trash bins.
[3:08:45.120 --> 3:08:58.240]  I have articles on that. Everybody's a terrorist which creates the illusion that these fake terrorists really exist and it's a Stasi society. They want us, just what our guest was just saying, fighting with each other instead of realizing the man behind the curtain.
[3:08:58.240 --> 3:09:15.040]  It's so simple but it's hard for folks to get. There is a shadow government. It kills any presidents at once. The top of the shadow government are the people Obama brought in. Even worse than Bush. So we immediately knew he was bad. We knew he'd lie about everything he said he was going to do. He's now done that.
[3:09:15.040 --> 3:09:30.160]  But in England, they've set this up. And if you look, the people in the anti-terror spy force are also this common purpose group that's in all the key positions. That's coming up in about two or three minutes. But I just wanted to say bye to Patrice O'Neill. He's on the show for an hour tomorrow. What hour, Jason Burmas?
[3:09:30.160 --> 3:09:32.800]  I think it's in the first hour, Alex.
[3:09:32.800 --> 3:09:52.720]  Okay, great. So in the first hour, 9 o'clock central, tomorrow is going to be on just Google up Patrice O'Neill or go to his Myspace. It'll pop up. He's coming to Texas but we're on everywhere. But we might go see him when he's coming to a nearby area of Austin. This is very, very exciting. Jason, you want to say hi to Patrice O'Neill?
[3:09:52.720 --> 3:10:14.080]  Yeah, you know, I just want to thank him for going on a show like Opie and Anthony, which does reach out to an audience that we don't necessarily reach out to. Millions of people. Yeah, exactly. I mean, a lot of my friends are huge fans. You know, Patrice used to be on Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn all the time. He's on, you know, Best Week Ever all the time. He hosts these little YouTube shows. So he's a face out there that is going to reach an audience that is kind of at that dumb down iPhone level.
[3:10:14.080 --> 3:10:32.080]  Yeah, exactly. So we need more people like this to come out and talk about these real issues. And he's got courage. I mean, this is a guy who's waking up to this. He's black and he's got this amazing courage. I didn't see that from Republicans who just couldn't admit Bush was conning him because he was a white guy and looked like them.
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:46.080]  See, I mean, it's the same. People are all people. That's a saying. It's true. We all act the same. We think it's like a sports team. We think the guy that looks like us is going to represent us. But I was listening to who's the new guy on CNN, young black guy, Saturday show.
[3:10:46.080 --> 3:10:57.080]  Well, he has a show on XM and I listened to it driving home a lot. And he had on this financial expert and they were talking about how these mortgage companies ripping off black people mainly would call up blacks that had good mortgage has been paying their bills for decades.
[3:10:57.080 --> 3:11:10.080]  And I tell him, oh, we're a black company really weren't and have him go sign papers and rip them off using a black person to run the scam. So, I mean, it's the same thing over and over again. But Patrice, any closing comments?
[3:11:10.080 --> 3:11:30.080]  I just, you know, I appreciate it, man. I'm a, you know, I'm a fan of learning this kind of stuff, man. You guys got it. And again, like I said, I'm not going to go. I'm not going. Alex Jones is right. I'm just saying to people listening, I'm going, OK, he said this, I'm going to look it up.
[3:11:30.080 --> 3:11:43.080]  And in, in some interesting things come up, you know, for a considered novice, you talk a lot. Yeah, I mean, he talked about Gulf of Tonkin. He talked about the Federal Reserve Banking System on the show.
[3:11:43.080 --> 3:11:51.080]  He talked about building seven on the show. I mean, for a novice, it looks like you've already looked at that. And that's the one thing. And I know you guys have got to go.
[3:11:51.080 --> 3:12:11.080]  One thing is that we argue a lot about logistics of certain conspiracies, but I like to, I like to try to get to the practical things. And that's what I'm learning how to argue is, OK, let's not talk about if the Germans actually sank the Lithuania.
[3:12:11.080 --> 3:12:32.080]  Let's talk about the timing of the sinking and what it, what it, what ultimately happened. We got in a war and an expensive war. And I'm, because people like to argue about whether, you know, that's Mohammed Atar's actual, you know, idea, his actual passport on the ground.
[3:12:32.080 --> 3:12:47.080]  It's like we get offered to all those little things and we need to talk about the basics, the climate, what is really going on. And, you know, and I, and I appreciate you. I mean, you appreciate, you know, you must get a lot of problems, Alex.
[3:12:47.080 --> 3:12:58.080]  So, you know, what you guys are doing, dude, is we appreciate, we appreciate you. And it's D. L. Hugley. That's the, the, the, yeah, but no, I mean, I mean, I've gotten to where I'm driving home.
[3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:06.080]  That's when he's on like six, seven at night. I used to go home about five, see the kids come back and I listened to him and you hear the callers going.
[3:13:06.080 --> 3:13:15.080]  He's a well-meaning guy. He's not talking about him. He had a financial, a black financial expert on and they were taking calls and it was just, I listened for like 30 minutes.
[3:13:15.080 --> 3:13:25.080]  I think it was Monday and caller after caller was talking about how a nice black voice would call up. They'd say come down. They'd have black brokers, but it's working for a big global company.
[3:13:25.080 --> 3:13:32.080]  And they think, oh, this is nice black folks. I'm going to change my mortgage and they were ripping them off. I mean, my whole point is a black guy will mug you, a white guy will mug you.
[3:13:32.080 --> 3:13:39.080]  And I'm telling you right now, Barack Obama, you know, just like all white people aren't evil. Well, all white people aren't good either. Well, all black people aren't good.
[3:13:39.080 --> 3:13:46.080]  I'm telling you right now, Obama is New World Order and it's selling this agenda. Well, listen, it's very exciting to have had you on Patrice O'Neill.
[3:13:46.080 --> 3:13:56.080]  Anything you need to plug so folks can find out about you? You just go to my space. So, you know, Google me and, you know, and look for me.
[3:13:56.080 --> 3:14:07.080]  If you go to my space that has all my tour dates, I'm not on any television now. So, it's just basically I'm touring around the country and most of my stuff is being on shows like yours, doing a little radio.
[3:14:07.080 --> 3:14:13.080]  And I appreciate you having me, man. Well, sir, we look forward to you being on tomorrow night. I'll be listening. God bless you. Thank you.
[3:14:13.080 --> 3:14:18.080]  Take care. Great having him on an amazing hour interview. We just did. I got him on 15 minutes late. That was perfect to hold him over.
[3:14:18.080 --> 3:14:27.080]  I apologize to our next guest, but we got behind today. And that's Brian Garrish, former naval officer and anti-submarine warfare expert.
[3:14:27.080 --> 3:14:35.080]  Brian Garrish to discuss common purpose of sinister quasi-political charity that has infiltrated the U.K. power structure as part of its agenda to re-engineer society.
[3:14:35.080 --> 3:14:41.080]  Garrish will also discuss the preparation for martial law and stage riots that also ties the Obama national security issue.
[3:14:41.080 --> 3:14:51.080]  Now, Hitler did this, Stalin did this, Mounted this. They're setting it up here and it ties in to the Tattletale squads. It ties in.
[3:14:51.080 --> 3:14:57.080]  These people are working for intelligence agencies. They're put in key positions. And then it's like NGOs at the U.N.
[3:14:57.080 --> 3:15:01.080]  And they can point at them and go, oh, that's what the people want. That's our group.
[3:15:01.080 --> 3:15:11.080]  So it's literal intelligence infiltration of your society, of your country and common purpose re-engineering U.K. for a new world order.
[3:15:11.080 --> 3:15:19.080]  And there's a video we've got up. There's the amazing Brian Garrish. He really knows what he's doing because we've done all this research separately.
[3:15:19.080 --> 3:15:25.080]  And now when I was in England, videotaping, just on the street, cops walked up. What's your name? I put you in a terror database.
[3:15:25.080 --> 3:15:33.080]  I had a lot of videotape in London, but they had cameras on us. Steve Watson that runs prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[3:15:33.080 --> 3:15:39.080]  He has a master's in political science, out with his girlfriend taking her out to eat. They line him up, line up folks, take their IDs.
[3:15:39.080 --> 3:15:47.080]  This is getting you used to living under this. And later in the interview, I'm going to get into this article Steve Watson wrote where it says,
[3:15:47.080 --> 3:15:55.080]  if somebody has a cell phone, if you see soap bottles, soap detergent bottles, and it shows in somebody's trash, they may be a terrorist.
[3:15:55.080 --> 3:16:01.080]  If they have a van, if they have a backpack, if they have a still camera, if they have a computer, it's the same stuff here in the U.S.
[3:16:01.080 --> 3:16:09.080]  It says blue jeans, cell phones, you're nice to police. I've read the manuals. It's meant to make police and the public paranoid of everybody.
[3:16:09.080 --> 3:16:19.080]  So we think terrorists are hiding, but the state, it will help us. And it's come out that MI5, MI6 illegally spy on the parliament. You have the shadow government run by the elites.
[3:16:19.080 --> 3:16:27.080]  Same here. Overthrowing the real government like PDD51 that states. I'm just setting this up for go to our guest.
[3:16:27.080 --> 3:16:33.080]  PDD51 that says Congress can't even see the emergency management plans, but the cover sheet says the president's a dictator.
[3:16:33.080 --> 3:16:40.080]  Without further ado, and I want to have him back up in the near future. We've got him for 45 minutes now. And that is Brian Garrish.
[3:16:40.080 --> 3:16:42.080]  Sir, thank you so much for coming on.
[3:16:42.080 --> 3:16:45.080]  Yeah, that's my pleasure. Thank you for inviting me.
[3:16:45.080 --> 3:16:54.080]  Again, I apologize for getting you on late. You got the floor. Break down how you learned about this, why you're involved, why you've been on some U.K. television speaking out against this.
[3:16:54.080 --> 3:16:59.080]  Go over what this common purpose is and how this nexus is in with the Stasi.
[3:16:59.080 --> 3:17:08.080]  Right. Okay. Well, for your listeners that don't know me, I'm an ex naval officer. I left the Navy as a Lieutenant Commander.
[3:17:08.080 --> 3:17:18.080]  Set up in business. Eventually I became what I call comfortable. And I started to look at trying to help some of the local community.
[3:17:18.080 --> 3:17:34.080]  Private areas, unemployment, general picture of decline. And together with some other people, we tried to set up a training course to give particularly younger people skills, training and jobs.
[3:17:34.080 --> 3:17:44.080]  Initially, everything went well. And then when we were supposed to apply for some grant funding, it was like a door was shut in our face.
[3:17:44.080 --> 3:17:52.080]  So all of the public bodies that we had been talking to suddenly stopped talking to us.
[3:17:52.080 --> 3:18:05.080]  Whether it was the city council or development agencies or Quangos or the local Chamber of Commerce, the contact stopped and it was just like a door shut.
[3:18:05.080 --> 3:18:16.080]  And we thought this was strange, but we just decided to press on with the project ourselves because we had support from local people, a lot of support.
[3:18:16.080 --> 3:18:22.080]  And then we, in a very short space of time, we started to be threatened.
[3:18:22.080 --> 3:18:38.080]  And initially it was suggestions that we should stop the project. And then when we didn't stop it, it became late night knocks on the door, threats, death threats, arson attempts and bricks through windows.
[3:18:38.080 --> 3:18:46.080]  We couldn't understand what was happening. And one evening I was asked to go and meet a man and I did.
[3:18:46.080 --> 3:18:53.080]  And he said to me, you're having problems. And I said, yes. And he asked me, did I know what was causing it? And I said, no.
[3:18:53.080 --> 3:19:01.080]  And he said to me, I think it's common purpose. Now, I'd never heard of the organization, so I asked him to tell me more.
[3:19:01.080 --> 3:19:09.080]  He said he'd rather not. And that was a very strange answer from somebody who'd apparently asked to see me.
[3:19:09.080 --> 3:19:17.080]  But I realized that the man was very nervous and I tried to get information from him, but he wouldn't tell me much more.
[3:19:17.080 --> 3:19:24.080]  So I eventually left. We did discuss some things about the city, Plymouth, where I live.
[3:19:24.080 --> 3:19:29.080]  But I came home and looked at a website for an organization called Common Purpose.
[3:19:29.080 --> 3:19:37.080]  And what I found was an organization which was talking about creating future leaders in society.
[3:19:37.080 --> 3:19:40.080]  Stay there. Stay there, sir. We have the same thing here.
[3:19:40.080 --> 3:19:44.080]  Back when I was a mainline conservative, I would try to build a veteran a house because they were going to tear it down.
[3:19:44.080 --> 3:19:49.080]  Suddenly we were getting death threats. Police were coming up and playing closing. Do you want to attack police?
[3:19:49.080 --> 3:19:56.080]  They don't want any real community activism because that brings sovereignty and local control.
[3:19:56.080 --> 3:20:01.080]  And in England and Europe, in Australia and the U.S., they go after everybody. Stay with us.
[3:20:01.080 --> 3:20:07.080]  Alex Jones here with a question. What does humidity mean to you? Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[3:20:07.080 --> 3:20:12.080]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[3:20:12.080 --> 3:20:15.080]  That's why I'd like you to visit AkolaBlue.com.

[3:21:01.080 --> 3:21:08.080]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[3:21:08.080 --> 3:21:13.080]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical,
[3:21:13.080 --> 3:21:16.080]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[3:21:16.080 --> 3:21:20.080]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note
[3:21:20.080 --> 3:21:24.080]  forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[3:21:24.080 --> 3:21:29.080]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[3:21:29.080 --> 3:21:34.080]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[3:21:34.080 --> 3:21:38.080]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[3:22:00.080 --> 3:22:07.080]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:22:07.080 --> 3:22:13.080]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[3:22:13.080 --> 3:22:19.080]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:22:19.080 --> 3:22:24.080]  Well, Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:22:24.080 --> 3:22:28.080]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:22:28.080 --> 3:22:37.080]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:22:37.080 --> 3:22:40.080]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:22:40.080 --> 3:22:47.080]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:23:00.080 --> 3:23:04.080]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[3:23:04.080 --> 3:23:09.080]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[3:23:09.080 --> 3:23:14.080]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American nutrition have the answer.
[3:23:14.080 --> 3:23:16.080]  Nature's Gem, premium omega-3.
[3:23:16.080 --> 3:23:21.080]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota,
[3:23:21.080 --> 3:23:28.080]  providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours, producing the highest quality premium golden flaxseed around.
[3:23:28.080 --> 3:23:32.080]  In addition, we selectively harvest and sort flaxseeds by size and weight,
[3:23:32.080 --> 3:23:36.080]  keeping only the best seeds that can produce the highest abundance of omega-3.
[3:23:36.080 --> 3:23:42.080]  The result is a delicious, nutty, buttery flavor. Nature's Gem golden flax is pure.
[3:23:42.080 --> 3:23:45.080]  There is nothing added and nothing taken away and non-GMO.

[3:24:00.080 --> 3:24:06.080]  We're back live. The same thing's been done here in the U.S.
[3:24:06.080 --> 3:24:11.080]  The state police, the Army, we got the documents last week, we called and they confirmed it.
[3:24:11.080 --> 3:24:14.080]  We are in the Fed protest. We had Army intelligence watching us.
[3:24:14.080 --> 3:24:20.080]  It said we were basically terrorist. Ron Paul's a terrorist, you know, all the supporters are terrorist.
[3:24:20.080 --> 3:24:26.080]  All their community organizing is okay and federally run, but anything else, they go after.
[3:24:26.080 --> 3:24:30.080]  And that's what our guest is saying is going on with this common purpose. We're learning more about it.
[3:24:30.080 --> 3:24:33.080]  Steve Watson's written a story about it. They're clearly going into a stasi society.
[3:24:33.080 --> 3:24:38.080]  Sir, please continue with what you were covering on Brian McGarish.
[3:24:38.080 --> 3:24:44.080]  Right. Well, Alex, the first thing I'll just say in reply to your comments about the closed down day,
[3:24:44.080 --> 3:24:52.080]  this was one of the key things that we really began to understand later is that a simple community project,
[3:24:52.080 --> 3:25:00.080]  which is going to get people trained, get pride back and get people earning money and a pride in their community,
[3:25:00.080 --> 3:25:05.080]  they don't want that. And that is the reason the project was closed down.
[3:25:05.080 --> 3:25:14.080]  I'm very sure that was the reason. They don't want people to be proud, to be well fed and well organized.
[3:25:14.080 --> 3:25:24.080]  But if I continue the story, once we discovered common purpose, particularly myself and another ex-military man,
[3:25:24.080 --> 3:25:34.080]  started to research it in a professional way. We were just amazed to find that an organization we'd never heard of
[3:25:34.080 --> 3:25:40.080]  was everywhere in the city, in Plymouth, in the southwest of England.
[3:25:40.080 --> 3:25:46.080]  It was even in the Chamber of Commerce, which I was working with, and yet those people never declared themselves.
[3:25:46.080 --> 3:25:52.080]  It was in the police. It was in the local authority. It was in the government bodies. It was in the hospitals.
[3:25:52.080 --> 3:26:00.080]  And at that stage, the head teacher of every school in Plymouth was also common purpose trained.
[3:26:00.080 --> 3:26:10.080]  Now, when we were able to look at key documents, and that my colleague here was able to see documents,
[3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:20.080]  where common purpose was talking about controlling a host city, if you could actually recruit and train a few key people in a city,
[3:26:20.080 --> 3:26:24.080]  those in positions of power, you could actually control the city.
[3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:32.080]  So if you had the chief executive of the local authority, if you had the planning officer, if you had the legal officer,
[3:26:32.080 --> 3:26:38.080]  if you had the head of police, in that way, you could actually start to steer the policy.
[3:26:38.080 --> 3:26:44.080]  And then they bring in more of their people, and it literally takes over.
[3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:54.080]  That's absolutely it, because if I can try and just sum this up for people, if you imagine an AMWAY type system,
[3:26:54.080 --> 3:27:05.080]  I know that you know AMWAY, pyramid selling, but instead of pyramid selling, what you're doing is pyramid recruiting of people into this common purpose.
[3:27:05.080 --> 3:27:11.080]  And what they are doing is training them in a particular way to go and train others.
[3:27:11.080 --> 3:27:16.080]  Now, we are pretty sure that what they're doing is neurolinguistic programming,
[3:27:16.080 --> 3:27:24.080]  but it means that once people are brought on board, they will select the ones who have the greatest influence and power,
[3:27:24.080 --> 3:27:29.080]  and they are the ones who they will then groom to control things.
[3:27:29.080 --> 3:27:34.080]  And by the way, it's admitted that Obama is doing all these little mind tricks in everything he does.
[3:27:34.080 --> 3:27:43.080]  Now, I've seen articles that common purpose is now involved in the 60,000 community spies that the government's called for.
[3:27:43.080 --> 3:27:52.080]  Well, that was something that came out in the press a few days ago, that 50,000, I will call them low grade officials,
[3:27:52.080 --> 3:27:55.080]  were going to be used to report on people.
[3:27:55.080 --> 3:28:02.080]  And we're now starting to see people such as traffic wardens being given powers of arrest.
[3:28:02.080 --> 3:28:11.080]  And I can tell you that one of our strong supporters who's a lovely lady from Germany, she's in her 80s,
[3:28:11.080 --> 3:28:18.080]  and she will tell us that every single step she sees happening in the UK at the moment,
[3:28:18.080 --> 3:28:22.080]  she saw happening as the Nazis came to power.
[3:28:22.080 --> 3:28:37.080]  She was bombed out in Hamburg, and she is literally pulling her hair out saying, why can't people see that exactly the same system is establishing itself in the United Kingdom?
[3:28:37.080 --> 3:28:42.080]  Well, we have that in Austin. We have these federally controlled groups, and they're intelligence agencies,
[3:28:42.080 --> 3:28:44.080]  and they'll be at a restaurant and they'll just walk right over.
[3:28:44.080 --> 3:28:48.080]  The governor will walk right over when I'm at Louisville, Lyon in front of witnesses and say,
[3:28:48.080 --> 3:28:53.080]  you have a nice Thanksgiving, Alex, and then one time he was on the show calling me names and things.
[3:28:53.080 --> 3:28:59.080]  The point is, they are very arrogant about this, and it's a good old boys' club, and they've taken over.
[3:28:59.080 --> 3:29:04.080]  And you say 50,000, I saw the BBC report, they were recruiting 60,000 citizens.
[3:29:04.080 --> 3:29:09.080]  They have InfraGuard here, 50,000 executives with secret shoot-to-kill orders.
[3:29:09.080 --> 3:29:14.080]  That's mainstream news. 26,000 preachers in the clergy response teams.
[3:29:14.080 --> 3:29:18.080]  We got their secret documents, a year and a half later mainstream news confirmed it,
[3:29:18.080 --> 3:29:24.080]  that they are preparing us for martial law and to have their flocks go to FEMA camps, sir.
[3:29:24.080 --> 3:29:30.080]  Yes, I've seen your material and other people's material on this in the state.
[3:29:30.080 --> 3:29:33.080]  Stay there. Stay there. Long segment. I know we've had a lot of breaks here.
[3:29:33.080 --> 3:29:36.080]  This is the time of the show when we have them. Long segment coming up. Stay there.
[3:29:36.080 --> 3:29:40.080]  Let's break this to folks. You can't make this type of stuff up.
[3:29:40.080 --> 3:29:44.080]  This is how societies are taken over by intelligence operations,
[3:29:44.080 --> 3:29:47.080]  and they use front charities and others to do it.
[3:29:47.080 --> 3:30:11.080]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[3:30:17.080 --> 3:30:24.080]  We'll be right back with our next show.
[3:30:47.080 --> 3:31:08.080]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:31:08.080 --> 3:31:14.080]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:31:14.080 --> 3:31:19.080]  just as well-funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[3:31:19.080 --> 3:31:22.080]  that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[3:31:22.080 --> 3:31:27.080]  Well, Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:31:27.080 --> 3:31:31.080]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:31:31.080 --> 3:31:38.080]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:31:38.080 --> 3:31:42.080]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.

[3:32:01.080 --> 3:32:05.080]  Hello, this is Steve Shank. Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food,
[3:32:05.080 --> 3:32:09.080]  but Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[3:32:09.080 --> 3:32:13.080]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods direct.
[3:32:13.080 --> 3:32:18.080]  If you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists
[3:32:18.080 --> 3:32:21.080]  who know the earth is cooling, don't call eFoods direct.
[3:32:21.080 --> 3:32:25.080]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[3:32:25.080 --> 3:32:29.080]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself
[3:32:29.080 --> 3:32:32.080]  and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods direct.
[3:32:32.080 --> 3:32:35.080]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[3:32:35.080 --> 3:32:40.080]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones show are foolish, don't call eFoods direct.

[3:33:25.080 --> 3:33:28.080]  Mainline churches that aren't part of the system, they spy on them.
[3:33:28.080 --> 3:33:30.080]  Mainline groups.
[3:33:30.080 --> 3:33:32.080]  This is the control.
[3:33:32.080 --> 3:33:36.080]  This is why our society won't work while we can't ever get communities going to change the government
[3:33:36.080 --> 3:33:42.080]  because on every issue of wars and open borders and high taxes and regulations and bailouts,
[3:33:42.080 --> 3:33:46.080]  you'll have 70 to 99% depending on the poll and those issues.
[3:33:46.080 --> 3:33:49.080]  The vast majority against it, but it just continues.
[3:33:49.080 --> 3:33:54.080]  Because they control the whole system and now they're going for broke and Obama's announcing
[3:33:54.080 --> 3:33:56.080]  they're trying to pass compulsory service.
[3:33:56.080 --> 3:33:58.080]  It's in the House and Senate right now.
[3:33:58.080 --> 3:34:01.080]  Swartz and Eggers, all these homeless people who's making them go to a camp now.
[3:34:01.080 --> 3:34:03.080]  I'm sending reporters to California.
[3:34:03.080 --> 3:34:04.080]  That's Bloomberg Financial.
[3:34:04.080 --> 3:34:06.080]  You can't sleep on the street or in your car now.
[3:34:06.080 --> 3:34:10.080]  You've got to go to the place where all the drug addicts and everybody else are at.
[3:34:10.080 --> 3:34:13.080]  With your family, CPS will be there grabbing your kids.
[3:34:13.080 --> 3:34:16.080]  But England, I mean, it is really bad.
[3:34:16.080 --> 3:34:20.080]  I've got a lot of friends and people in England, two folks that work with me.
[3:34:20.080 --> 3:34:28.080]  And Watson was looking at his town and all the common purpose people are also in the anti-terror operations now.
[3:34:28.080 --> 3:34:33.080]  And that's in Sheffield, same thing in London, going back to Brian Garrish.
[3:34:33.080 --> 3:34:35.080]  And that's how this happens.
[3:34:35.080 --> 3:34:40.080]  You try to get involved in the community and you just run into this brick wall of these people.
[3:34:40.080 --> 3:34:42.080]  And it's happening all over the nation.
[3:34:42.080 --> 3:34:46.080]  So, sir, continue with the new revelations. They're starting to be suppressed now.
[3:34:46.080 --> 3:34:49.080]  And they're admitting, oh, common purpose is going to help the government.
[3:34:49.080 --> 3:34:51.080]  And Obama's doing the same thing.
[3:34:51.080 --> 3:34:52.080]  Please continue.
[3:34:52.080 --> 3:34:54.080]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[3:34:54.080 --> 3:35:03.080]  It's very interesting that the subject of common purpose is now coming into the media because they're having to defend themselves.
[3:35:03.080 --> 3:35:11.080]  And they're having to defend themselves because more and more ordinary people are asking simple questions.
[3:35:11.080 --> 3:35:13.080]  They're asking what they're doing.
[3:35:13.080 --> 3:35:17.080]  They're asking why public money is being used to pay for them.
[3:35:17.080 --> 3:35:26.080]  And they're asking why a so-called charity is acting politically in order to change society.
[3:35:26.080 --> 3:35:32.080]  Now, one thing I think you said just then, Alex, is that these people are in control.
[3:35:32.080 --> 3:35:38.080]  I'd like to say that we're at a very important point because they are nearly in control.
[3:35:38.080 --> 3:35:39.080]  Yes.
[3:35:39.080 --> 3:35:44.080]  And what we have to do is make sure that they don't finally close the door.
[3:35:44.080 --> 3:35:51.080]  We know that they're not in control yet because if they were, you and I would not be speaking on this line.
[3:35:51.080 --> 3:36:00.080]  So what we've got to do is to start getting people to wake up and actually see what is happening in their society.
[3:36:00.080 --> 3:36:07.080]  Now, one of the key things that has been done in the United Kingdom is that the whole of the government system,
[3:36:07.080 --> 3:36:13.080]  and I mean the proper system of government, has been pushed to the side.
[3:36:13.080 --> 3:36:22.080]  And what is happening is that the country is being driven by a new sector, which is called the third sector.
[3:36:22.080 --> 3:36:35.080]  And this comprises organizations like Common Purpose and charities and partnerships and things we call quengos, their quasi-government bodies.
[3:36:35.080 --> 3:36:40.080]  And these are the bodies that they are now pushing through policy.
[3:36:40.080 --> 3:36:50.080]  So that if you are an elected counselor in one of our large towns or counties, you don't know what's happening anymore.
[3:36:50.080 --> 3:36:55.080]  And that is the interruption because it's key to add this. You're absolutely on target. Everything you're saying is true.
[3:36:55.080 --> 3:36:58.080]  The UN model of world government is public-private partnerships.
[3:36:58.080 --> 3:37:05.080]  So they have a rent-a-mob to bully anybody out of power that actually really represents the real people.
[3:37:05.080 --> 3:37:10.080]  So it's a counterfeit grassroots movement. And you're right, they're not in total power yet.
[3:37:10.080 --> 3:37:16.080]  But as you said, they're going after people throwing rocks through windows, bricks through windows, and they're very, very close.
[3:37:16.080 --> 3:37:23.080]  I mean, they're openly announcing secret police, military on the streets, all of this, then with their private spies everywhere. Please continue.
[3:37:23.080 --> 3:37:33.080]  Well, that is absolutely true. I can tell you that from the best information that I've got and other people working closely with me,
[3:37:33.080 --> 3:37:46.080]  recently the British Army was asked, troops were asked individually whether they would be prepared to open fire on British people on the streets of Britain.
[3:37:46.080 --> 3:37:56.080]  And so it is absolutely obvious at the moment when the government tells us that they're expecting violence on the street by the summer,
[3:37:56.080 --> 3:38:10.080]  they're expecting it because they are creating it. We have a criminal elite in power and they now want to ramp up the violence because that enables the close down of the police laws.
[3:38:10.080 --> 3:38:16.080]  And there's good news. I want you to continue. I want to back you up. Denver, Colorado, we were there.
[3:38:16.080 --> 3:38:21.080]  We couldn't prove it was police dressed like anarchists attacking other police and staged events.
[3:38:21.080 --> 3:38:28.080]  But we said we believed it. Then the Denver Post reported the police admit they attacked other police on news cameras to demonize all protest.
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:36.080]  We caught them last year at the Global Summit in Ottawa, Canada.
[3:38:36.080 --> 3:38:40.080]  And they were there with police dressed up attacking other police. That was confirmed.
[3:38:40.080 --> 3:38:44.080]  People noticed their boots were the same as the police, you know, with the same yellow decal.
[3:38:44.080 --> 3:38:47.080]  And then they had to confirm the royal amount of police were doing that.
[3:38:47.080 --> 3:38:53.080]  We know that the bankers fund through foundations these rena mobs who will go out and do this.
[3:38:53.080 --> 3:38:56.080]  And it's been confirmed, as you said, they're preparing for martial law in the U.S.
[3:38:56.080 --> 3:39:02.080]  And in England, that's mainstream news. It's been in memos. They asked the Marines, will you fire at U.S. citizens?
[3:39:02.080 --> 3:39:08.080]  They're suddenly putting military and all major police departments as liaison officers. That's being announced.
[3:39:08.080 --> 3:39:14.080]  And look at Gordon Brown. He swore to let there be a parliament vote on EU entrance.
[3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:18.080]  But then he forego that and went ahead and introduced it anyways and is now doing it.
[3:39:18.080 --> 3:39:24.080]  Again, this is tyranny. They won't let the Brits vote on entering the EU or not. Go ahead.
[3:39:24.080 --> 3:39:29.080]  That's certainly true. Well, it's obvious that Mr. Brown lied at every opportunity.
[3:39:29.080 --> 3:39:34.080]  And his intention is clearly to lock us into the European Union.
[3:39:34.080 --> 3:39:40.080]  But if I can just bring you back, because we are in a very, very serious position,
[3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:47.080]  all of the things you've talked about with the martial law and the searches and the 50 or 60,000,
[3:39:47.080 --> 3:39:51.080]  I'll call them Gestapo being prepared, that's all happening.
[3:39:51.080 --> 3:39:56.080]  But we need to also try and concentrate on what people can do.
[3:39:56.080 --> 3:40:01.080]  And one thing which I think you will agree with me is the number of people
[3:40:01.080 --> 3:40:07.080]  who are actually controlling things amongst the bad guys is very small.
[3:40:07.080 --> 3:40:14.080]  When we look at the, well, we've got about 40 million adult voters in this country.
[3:40:14.080 --> 3:40:20.080]  And if we can wake up those people properly, then the other side has no chance.
[3:40:20.080 --> 3:40:23.080]  They're very frightened of the sheer volume of people.
[3:40:23.080 --> 3:40:27.080]  Compartmentalization, you said the key. You're right.
[3:40:27.080 --> 3:40:31.080]  Even most the minions in these groups believe the propaganda, believe there's terrorists everywhere,
[3:40:31.080 --> 3:40:34.080]  believe they've got to dig through their neighbors' garbage.
[3:40:34.080 --> 3:40:38.080]  They want us all against each other because they're a very small group that's compartmentalized.
[3:40:38.080 --> 3:40:42.080]  With exposure, they'll fall like a house of cards. Continue.
[3:40:42.080 --> 3:40:47.080]  Yeah. Well, one of the things that we've discovered is that as we've stuck to a message,
[3:40:47.080 --> 3:40:52.080]  which is to explain to people why nothing works in the country,
[3:40:52.080 --> 3:40:56.080]  and we've stuck to a message as how it's being done.
[3:40:56.080 --> 3:41:02.080]  So we've exposed common purpose. We're exposing members of the government.
[3:41:02.080 --> 3:41:09.080]  And then we are showing people that by digging and getting the activities to the surface,
[3:41:09.080 --> 3:41:12.080]  something very special is happening.
[3:41:12.080 --> 3:41:21.080]  If you take the British police force, it is absolutely untrue that all the police are part of this new agenda.
[3:41:21.080 --> 3:41:26.080]  There are a large number of very good people in the police force,
[3:41:26.080 --> 3:41:30.080]  but at the moment they don't understand what's happening around them.
[3:41:30.080 --> 3:41:36.080]  So our job is to get in amongst them, to give them the truth, and to wake them up.
[3:41:36.080 --> 3:41:41.080]  And that is exactly the same in the military and it's the same in the government.
[3:41:41.080 --> 3:41:49.080]  What we've got to do is get in amongst the organizations and start spreading the message.
[3:41:49.080 --> 3:41:53.080]  Brian Garrish from England, Brian Garrish from England exposing common purpose and others.
[3:41:53.080 --> 3:41:57.080]  Again, you're facing the same globalist crime syndicate that we're facing.
[3:41:57.080 --> 3:42:02.080]  We're facing the exact same attack formation, same programs rolled out at the same time.
[3:42:02.080 --> 3:42:04.080]  And what you're saying you're doing with success, we're doing.
[3:42:04.080 --> 3:42:09.080]  We have police and military sending us secret documents every week that make national news,
[3:42:09.080 --> 3:42:11.080]  how they're spying on the American people for no reason.
[3:42:11.080 --> 3:42:16.080]  Good Americans, how the war on terror is really meant to steal the middle class's money
[3:42:16.080 --> 3:42:20.080]  and literally put us in camps, the police and military are waking up.
[3:42:20.080 --> 3:42:26.080]  So as if you're talking to a new crowd here, let's say you're on national British TV for five minutes.
[3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:32.080]  How do you, with this formula that you've had success with, what would you say to them right now?
[3:42:32.080 --> 3:42:37.080]  Well, the first thing is those of you who know the truth about what is happening,
[3:42:37.080 --> 3:42:39.080]  you've really got to tell people.
[3:42:39.080 --> 3:42:43.080]  It doesn't matter whether they laugh at you, some of them will.
[3:42:43.080 --> 3:42:51.080]  Some of the people will turn away from you, but you are only interested in the people who believe you,
[3:42:51.080 --> 3:42:56.080]  because the people who believe will go away and spread the message.
[3:42:56.080 --> 3:43:05.080]  And our task is to wake up millions of people and we need to tell them that if they don't wake up,
[3:43:05.080 --> 3:43:10.080]  millions of people are going to die, including millions of children.
[3:43:10.080 --> 3:43:18.080]  I have no doubt that is going to happen in the UK and I have no doubt it's going to happen in the United States.
[3:43:18.080 --> 3:43:25.080]  So don't be shy with the message, tell them and you will find people will come on board.
[3:43:25.080 --> 3:43:32.080]  And when they say what can they do, you say the same thing, tell other people.
[3:43:32.080 --> 3:43:37.080]  I believe that the waking up of people is an exponential curve.
[3:43:37.080 --> 3:43:42.080]  We've been for years on the flat bit, so nothing seems to happen.
[3:43:42.080 --> 3:43:49.080]  But I'm now quite optimistic because we're just at the curve before it really starts to go.
[3:43:49.080 --> 3:43:53.080]  And I think it's the same in America.
[3:43:53.080 --> 3:44:01.080]  Somebody in one state has a good joke and in three days everybody in America has heard the good joke.
[3:44:01.080 --> 3:44:08.080]  What we need to do about the message that a vicious dictatorship is being imposed.
[3:44:08.080 --> 3:44:15.080]  But the other thing you can do if you want to start the dialogue is to talk to people about the money situation
[3:44:15.080 --> 3:44:19.080]  because a lot of people have been hurt by the banking collapse
[3:44:19.080 --> 3:44:28.080]  and just tell them that every organization that's up to no good is supported by the international banking elite
[3:44:28.080 --> 3:44:32.080]  because that's a fact, but it's waking people up.
[3:44:32.080 --> 3:44:39.080]  So be positive, tell the truth and you've got to be friends with other people.
[3:44:39.080 --> 3:44:48.080]  They want to split us up, they want white against black, they want Christian against Muslim against Jew, they want the lot.
[3:44:48.080 --> 3:44:56.080]  So we have to stand together as people and when people stand together they are very frightened.
[3:44:56.080 --> 3:44:58.080]  That's my message.
[3:44:58.080 --> 3:45:00.080]  All right, let me go over some points here.
[3:45:00.080 --> 3:45:05.080]  I've got to have you back and give out any websites or contact for folks that want to help you in England counter this.
[3:45:05.080 --> 3:45:08.080]  And don't wait for orders from headquarters. You are the leader. You are the solution.
[3:45:08.080 --> 3:45:10.080]  This is classical hardcore tyranny.
[3:45:10.080 --> 3:45:13.080]  We have the government's documents scientifically taking over.
[3:45:13.080 --> 3:45:17.080]  The reason the same thing's happening in Germany, the same thing's happening in China,
[3:45:17.080 --> 3:45:23.080]  the same thing's happening in Australia, England, U.S. because it's the same international banking cartel they brag about it.
[3:45:23.080 --> 3:45:31.080]  Now, here's the issue. The enemy wants a fake grassroots movement and their counterfeit is big and powerful on the surface,
[3:45:31.080 --> 3:45:34.080]  but it's very, very weak when you stand up to it.
[3:45:34.080 --> 3:45:38.080]  True grassroots is invincible. This is total resistance.
[3:45:38.080 --> 3:45:45.080]  And so understand he's right. Everybody instinctively, just like my snow when a hurricane's coming two days before, you know, or birds,
[3:45:45.080 --> 3:45:52.080]  we have that too. Intellectually they can go find it, but instinctively people know what's happening.
[3:45:52.080 --> 3:45:57.080]  Global issues, a complex psychological warfare op where they know everybody's scared and they say,
[3:45:57.080 --> 3:46:01.080]  you're scared because terrorists are everywhere and your neighbor's probably one.
[3:46:01.080 --> 3:46:05.080]  See, the enemy's very smart. They know people instinctively are going,
[3:46:05.080 --> 3:46:08.080]  I'm in danger because we're in danger of this Hitlerian system.
[3:46:08.080 --> 3:46:12.080]  We have to go, no, no. The reason you're upset is look at the tyranny.
[3:46:12.080 --> 3:46:15.080]  Look who's doing all the bad things. Look at who's bankrupting things by design.
[3:46:15.080 --> 3:46:19.080]  And yes, start by talking about the financial collapse and how they're taking over.
[3:46:19.080 --> 3:46:23.080]  And even if we don't stop them at this juncture, as it gets worse and worse,
[3:46:23.080 --> 3:46:26.080]  all the seeds you planted in people's minds will then sprout.
[3:46:26.080 --> 3:46:30.080]  Those that turn away and walk away and laugh, they won't be laughing soon, unfortunately,
[3:46:30.080 --> 3:46:34.080]  because the globalists are planning a mass call like in Soviet Russia.
[3:46:34.080 --> 3:46:38.080]  I've seen the attack pattern in history. This is it. This is the signature, the wavelength.
[3:46:38.080 --> 3:46:43.080]  We know what this animal is. It is the worst possible tyranny you can imagine.
[3:46:43.080 --> 3:46:49.080]  It is the worst system we could even imagine. This is hell on earth.
[3:46:49.080 --> 3:46:55.080]  Now, the enemy knows that, again, the people are waking up to them.
[3:46:55.080 --> 3:46:59.080]  So that's why they're trying to accelerate their plan and that weakens them
[3:46:59.080 --> 3:47:02.080]  because haste makes waste. Now, I'm going to try to shut up, sir.
[3:47:02.080 --> 3:47:04.080]  You just really are spurring me to speak because, you know,
[3:47:04.080 --> 3:47:06.080]  we're two guys that we talked before and we're on the same page.
[3:47:06.080 --> 3:47:08.080]  How do folks contact you? How do they get involved?
[3:47:08.080 --> 3:47:12.080]  How do they fight this in England where, I mean, folks, it's secret police everywhere
[3:47:12.080 --> 3:47:14.080]  lining you up, getting you used to being asked questions.
[3:47:14.080 --> 3:47:17.080]  I mean, Russia isn't this bad in the Cold War.
[3:47:17.080 --> 3:47:20.080]  From folks I've talked to, they're now in England that we're in foreign service.
[3:47:20.080 --> 3:47:23.080]  I mean, this is like Russia and they're trying that here.
[3:47:23.080 --> 3:47:26.080]  So how do we get involved? How do we continue to fight it?
[3:47:26.080 --> 3:47:31.080]  Right. Well, if I can, I'd like to mention some websites,
[3:47:31.080 --> 3:47:36.080]  which mean that America can come and have a look at what we're doing.
[3:47:36.080 --> 3:47:49.080]  So the first one I'd like to give you is www.cpexposed.com.
[3:47:49.080 --> 3:47:53.080]  Cpexposed.com. Common Purpose Exposed.com. Cp Exposed.
[3:47:53.080 --> 3:47:59.080]  That has got documentary evidence about what common purpose is doing in the UK.
[3:47:59.080 --> 3:48:02.080]  But if you understand how it's working in UK,
[3:48:02.080 --> 3:48:05.080]  you will very quickly see what's going on in America.
[3:48:05.080 --> 3:48:10.080]  And I want to come back, if you'll remind me, on to the subject of mind control.
[3:48:10.080 --> 3:48:26.080]  The other site I'd like to point you to is www.ukcolumn.org.
[3:48:26.080 --> 3:48:29.080]  And that's our newspaper.
[3:48:29.080 --> 3:48:36.080]  And also, we had a conference back in February where we just said,
[3:48:36.080 --> 3:48:39.080]  let us see what happens when we start telling the truth.
[3:48:39.080 --> 3:48:43.080]  And we had 500 people very quickly in one location.
[3:48:43.080 --> 3:48:46.080]  So we're now going for a much bigger one in London.
[3:48:46.080 --> 3:48:54.080]  And the site for that is www.thebcgroup.
[3:48:54.080 --> 3:49:05.080]  B.C. stands for British Constitution. The B.C. Group.org.
[3:49:05.080 --> 3:49:07.080]  And I'd also like to mention another gentleman.
[3:49:07.080 --> 3:49:11.080]  He's an ex-Lieutenant Commander at the United States Navy.
[3:49:11.080 --> 3:49:15.080]  And his name is Gerald Atkinson.
[3:49:15.080 --> 3:49:23.080]  And he is running a website which is www.newtotalitarian.com.
[3:49:23.080 --> 3:49:28.080]  Now, I have only recently come across this guy,
[3:49:28.080 --> 3:49:34.080]  but he's been doing some fantastic work in showing how the American military
[3:49:34.080 --> 3:49:39.080]  is being mind controlled by sensitivity training.
[3:49:39.080 --> 3:49:42.080]  Yeah, let me explain to people, the government documents that in college,
[3:49:42.080 --> 3:49:47.080]  they admit that they're using subliminals, other systems on TV,
[3:49:47.080 --> 3:49:50.080]  and that they are sensitivity training is reeducation.
[3:49:50.080 --> 3:49:54.080]  And that's what the new national draft is in the U.S. is forced education.
[3:49:54.080 --> 3:49:59.080]  And it's literally in these groupthink, peer pressure systems bringing in control.
[3:49:59.080 --> 3:50:02.080]  In the final segment, I'm going to have you back very, very soon, sir.
[3:50:02.080 --> 3:50:05.080]  I'm very impressed because all the time when you get other folks on like yourself,
[3:50:05.080 --> 3:50:06.080]  we just click.
[3:50:06.080 --> 3:50:09.080]  But I wanted you to talk about what is it like for you, a patriot,
[3:50:09.080 --> 3:50:11.080]  a military officer.
[3:50:11.080 --> 3:50:13.080]  And I notice it's a lot of times military folks that are fighting this
[3:50:13.080 --> 3:50:16.080]  because you recognize an intelligence op takeover op.
[3:50:16.080 --> 3:50:19.080]  What was it like for you when you woke up to this with your view of England,
[3:50:19.080 --> 3:50:21.080]  your view of the world?
[3:50:21.080 --> 3:50:25.080]  Well, it's been a big shock for me because I've had to completely
[3:50:25.080 --> 3:50:28.080]  relearn a lot of things that I've believed in.
[3:50:28.080 --> 3:50:33.080]  I will say to you now that I no longer believe that the intelligence services
[3:50:33.080 --> 3:50:36.080]  in this country are defending Britain.
[3:50:36.080 --> 3:50:38.080]  I believe they're part of the problem.
[3:50:38.080 --> 3:50:43.080]  So I've had to look at every aspect of the world around me and decide
[3:50:43.080 --> 3:50:46.080]  now what's true and what's not true.
[3:50:46.080 --> 3:50:51.080]  And American, ordinary American people are going to have to do this as well.
[3:50:51.080 --> 3:50:52.080]  Yeah, stay there.
[3:50:52.080 --> 3:50:54.080]  We've got to decide which side we're on.
[3:50:54.080 --> 3:50:56.080]  Folks, just choose a side.
[3:50:56.080 --> 3:50:58.080]  Are you on the new order side or Liberty side?
[3:50:58.080 --> 3:51:01.080]  Choose now. Choose wisely.
[3:51:01.080 --> 3:51:05.080]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[3:51:05.080 --> 3:51:08.080]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures
[3:51:08.080 --> 3:51:09.080]  throughout the world.
[3:51:09.080 --> 3:51:13.080]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called
[3:51:13.080 --> 3:51:17.080]  Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[3:51:17.080 --> 3:51:21.080]  without use of animal protein, nitrates or saline solutions.
[3:51:21.080 --> 3:51:24.080]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles,
[3:51:24.080 --> 3:51:27.080]  it can be better utilized at the cellular level,
[3:51:27.080 --> 3:51:31.080]  and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[3:51:31.080 --> 3:51:34.080]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements,
[3:51:34.080 --> 3:51:36.080]  including colloidal silver, gold and copper,
[3:51:36.080 --> 3:51:40.080]  with a money-bag guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[3:51:40.080 --> 3:51:43.080]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts
[3:51:43.080 --> 3:51:47.080]  against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of health care
[3:51:47.080 --> 3:51:48.080]  and freedom of speech.

[3:52:02.080 --> 3:52:05.080]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[3:52:05.080 --> 3:52:08.080]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:08.080 --> 3:52:12.080]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order
[3:52:12.080 --> 3:52:14.080]  that I think all of us would like to see.
[3:52:14.080 --> 3:52:17.080]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[3:52:17.080 --> 3:52:20.080]  that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[3:52:20.080 --> 3:52:22.080]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[3:52:22.080 --> 3:52:25.080]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:25.080 --> 3:52:29.080]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:52:29.080 --> 3:52:33.080]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers
[3:52:33.080 --> 3:52:38.080]  and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.080 --> 3:52:40.080]  It's not about left to right.
[3:52:40.080 --> 3:52:42.080]  It's about a one-world government.
[3:52:42.080 --> 3:52:46.080]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told,
[3:52:46.080 --> 3:52:48.080]  and his real agenda.
[3:52:48.080 --> 3:52:53.080]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com

[3:52:56.080 --> 3:52:58.080]  The Obama deception.
[3:52:58.080 --> 3:53:00.080]  The people strike back.
[3:53:00.080 --> 3:53:04.080]  Do you suffer from aches and pains in your knees, arms, wrists, or elbows?
[3:53:04.080 --> 3:53:08.080]  Is it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because of joint stiffness?
[3:53:08.080 --> 3:53:12.080]  Have you been looking for a safe, natural alternative to help ease your pain?
[3:53:12.080 --> 3:53:15.080]  If so, you need to visit solartherm.ca.

[3:53:20.080 --> 3:53:24.080]  that holds in and reflects your own body heat, soothing those sore areas.
[3:53:24.080 --> 3:53:27.080]  Solartherm is extremely light and comfortable to wear

[3:53:55.080 --> 3:53:58.080]  That's solar-t-h-e-r-m.
[3:53:58.080 --> 3:54:01.080]  Solartherm.ca.
[3:54:01.080 --> 3:54:04.080]  It is our right.
[3:54:04.080 --> 3:54:08.080]  It is our duty to organize and to control our governments
[3:54:08.080 --> 3:54:12.080]  under the Magna Carta Bill of Rights Constitution in England and the United States.
[3:54:12.080 --> 3:54:16.080]  And worldwide, it's a basic human right.
[3:54:16.080 --> 3:54:19.080]  You don't get it from laws. You innately have it, but those laws are there.
[3:54:19.080 --> 3:54:23.080]  Notice how all of their charities, all of their groups,
[3:54:23.080 --> 3:54:27.080]  are policing, spying, controlling, going after freedom,
[3:54:27.080 --> 3:54:30.080]  trying to raise taxes, and then demonizing anybody who's involved,
[3:54:30.080 --> 3:54:33.080]  anybody who speaks up for sovereignty or liberty.
[3:54:33.080 --> 3:54:36.080]  And notice how they say Obama's supposed to bring good race relations.
[3:54:36.080 --> 3:54:38.080]  Actually, he's going to represent the dual-order agenda.
[3:54:38.080 --> 3:54:41.080]  So when you criticize him, they'll then say,
[3:54:41.080 --> 3:54:45.080]  oh, that's racism as they are now to create and heighten division.
[3:54:45.080 --> 3:54:47.080]  This is how they control us.
[3:54:47.080 --> 3:54:50.080]  Just an amazing interview with Brian Garrish.
[3:54:50.080 --> 3:54:54.080]  You can find out more at the websites like cpexposed.com,
[3:54:54.080 --> 3:54:59.080]  ukcolumn.org, the bcgroup.org.
[3:54:59.080 --> 3:55:01.080]  We really appreciate him coming on.
[3:55:01.080 --> 3:55:03.080]  I'll have you back up for a couple hours here in the next few weeks
[3:55:03.080 --> 3:55:05.080]  because this is the takeover.
[3:55:05.080 --> 3:55:08.080]  They know if they've got the grassroots, they can win.
[3:55:08.080 --> 3:55:10.080]  And every time we try to declare state sovereignty,
[3:55:10.080 --> 3:55:14.080]  which is in the 10th Amendment, here in the U.S.,
[3:55:14.080 --> 3:55:18.080]  our similar common purpose groups pop up and try to block it.
[3:55:18.080 --> 3:55:21.080]  And because they work for the feds who use our own tax money against us.
[3:55:21.080 --> 3:55:25.080]  In closing, dealing with, yeah, the mind control, the reeducation,
[3:55:25.080 --> 3:55:28.080]  the brainwashing of police teachers and others,
[3:55:28.080 --> 3:55:30.080]  and their induction into these control arms.
[3:55:30.080 --> 3:55:31.080]  Go ahead.
[3:55:31.080 --> 3:55:35.080]  Well, Alex, the one thing I wanted to come back to is doing things.
[3:55:35.080 --> 3:55:38.080]  And there are two more people I'd like to mention.
[3:55:38.080 --> 3:55:41.080]  One is a guy called John Harris.
[3:55:41.080 --> 3:55:43.080]  And he's a carpenter.
[3:55:43.080 --> 3:55:46.080]  He's come out of nowhere in the U.K.
[3:55:46.080 --> 3:55:51.080]  And basically, he sent an affidavit to the Queen
[3:55:51.080 --> 3:55:55.080]  and said, I am not happy with what is happening in this country.
[3:55:55.080 --> 3:55:59.080]  I am making myself a free man.
[3:55:59.080 --> 3:56:02.080]  Now, a lot of people laughed at him when he did this.
[3:56:02.080 --> 3:56:06.080]  But what has actually started to happen is that hundreds of people
[3:56:06.080 --> 3:56:11.080]  are now signing affidavits to say that they are withdrawing from the system.
[3:56:11.080 --> 3:56:13.080]  They're not playing the game.
[3:56:13.080 --> 3:56:17.080]  They're not going to allow the system to control them in this way.
[3:56:17.080 --> 3:56:20.080]  In the beginning, people laughed.
[3:56:20.080 --> 3:56:27.080]  But now, John's website, which is called tpuc.org,
[3:56:27.080 --> 3:56:33.080]  and I recommend that your listeners go and look.
[3:56:33.080 --> 3:56:34.080]  Yeah, but meaning to get him on.
[3:56:34.080 --> 3:56:37.080]  I mean, that's a similar system to the Declaration of Independence.
[3:56:37.080 --> 3:56:38.080]  We're not slaves to the Queen,
[3:56:38.080 --> 3:56:40.080]  to this whole corporate maritime administration.
[3:56:40.080 --> 3:56:43.080]  That really is how this whole thing works out.
[3:56:43.080 --> 3:56:44.080]  I mean, to get him back on.
[3:56:44.080 --> 3:56:48.080]  But finishing up here, they are brainwashing the military and police.
[3:56:48.080 --> 3:56:52.080]  Well, they are brainwashing particularly military and police,
[3:56:52.080 --> 3:56:57.080]  but it also goes through into the schools, which is particularly dangerous.
[3:56:57.080 --> 3:57:03.080]  But what we are now finding is that by giving talks and the videos
[3:57:03.080 --> 3:57:06.080]  that have gone out on the Internet that we have sent out,
[3:57:06.080 --> 3:57:11.080]  by giving talks about how the brainwashing works
[3:57:11.080 --> 3:57:14.080]  and what changes you see in people,
[3:57:14.080 --> 3:57:18.080]  we are finding it difficult to cope now with a number of people
[3:57:18.080 --> 3:57:24.080]  who call us every day telling us that since they've heard our message,
[3:57:24.080 --> 3:57:26.080]  they can see it.
[3:57:26.080 --> 3:57:27.080]  They literally call me,
[3:57:27.080 --> 3:57:30.080]  I must have had a hundred calls today.
[3:57:30.080 --> 3:57:32.080]  That's just through to me.
[3:57:32.080 --> 3:57:35.080]  Most of them I can't take.
[3:57:35.080 --> 3:57:38.080]  But the people are saying, I see it.
[3:57:38.080 --> 3:57:39.080]  Well, let me stop you.
[3:57:39.080 --> 3:57:40.080]  It's all in government documents.
[3:57:40.080 --> 3:57:42.080]  It's been in the British news where they tell them,
[3:57:42.080 --> 3:57:43.080]  oh, kids, you're going to play spy.
[3:57:43.080 --> 3:57:47.080]  Don't tell your parents thumbprint that it's a laser scanner illegally.
[3:57:47.080 --> 3:57:49.080]  And it happened all over the nation in one week period,
[3:57:49.080 --> 3:57:51.080]  what, two years ago?
[3:57:51.080 --> 3:57:53.080]  I mean, these are government training camps.
[3:57:53.080 --> 3:57:56.080]  And Time Magazine for Kids says your parents are bad.
[3:57:56.080 --> 3:57:58.080]  They train kids here out of spy on their parents.
[3:57:58.080 --> 3:58:00.080]  We're going to have to have...
[3:58:00.080 --> 3:58:04.080]  A key thing is, for instance, when people are disturbed
[3:58:04.080 --> 3:58:08.080]  because they see police becoming more brutal,
[3:58:08.080 --> 3:58:11.080]  they're becoming dehumanized.
[3:58:11.080 --> 3:58:14.080]  This is the effect of sensitivity training.
[3:58:14.080 --> 3:58:15.080]  Yes, sir.
[3:58:15.080 --> 3:58:16.080]  America is happening.
[3:58:16.080 --> 3:58:17.080]  I'm going to have you...
[3:58:17.080 --> 3:58:20.080]  Listen, I'm going to have you back up in the next few weeks, OK?
[3:58:20.080 --> 3:58:21.080]  OK.
[3:58:21.080 --> 3:58:22.080]  God bless you.
[3:58:22.080 --> 3:58:23.080]  Great knowing you're out there.
[3:58:23.080 --> 3:58:24.080]  Great knowing you're fighting.
[3:58:24.080 --> 3:58:26.080]  We're with you here in the United States.
[3:58:26.080 --> 3:58:27.080]  You're out there in Air Strip 1.
[3:58:27.080 --> 3:58:30.080]  Folks, get the Obama Deception on DVD right now

[3:58:52.080 --> 3:58:53.080]  Hello, friends.
[3:58:53.080 --> 3:58:54.080]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:58:54.080 --> 3:58:57.080]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[3:58:57.080 --> 3:58:59.080]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[3:58:59.080 --> 3:59:00.080]  We need to be independent.
[3:59:00.080 --> 3:59:02.080]  And food and water is the key.
[3:59:02.080 --> 3:59:03.080]  So if you've ever been in a bread line,
[3:59:03.080 --> 3:59:04.080]  you have your own bread.
[3:59:04.080 --> 3:59:06.080]  You'll never have to go to the superdome
[3:59:06.080 --> 3:59:08.080]  and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[3:59:08.080 --> 3:59:11.080]  in any emergency, if you simply prepare.
[3:59:11.080 --> 3:59:12.080]  No one is going to take care of your family
[3:59:12.080 --> 3:59:14.080]  in the final equation but you.
[3:59:14.080 --> 3:59:16.080]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift
[3:59:16.080 --> 3:59:18.080]  horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[3:59:18.080 --> 3:59:20.080]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
[3:59:20.080 --> 3:59:22.080]  And they do it at almost half the cost
[3:59:22.080 --> 3:59:23.080]  of last year's grocery prices.
[3:59:23.080 --> 3:59:26.080]  Call 1-800-409-5633
[3:59:26.080 --> 3:59:28.080]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:59:28.080 --> 3:59:30.080]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com
[3:59:30.080 --> 3:59:34.520]  and look over the final list of high-quality freeze-dried and dehydrated foods they have
[3:59:34.520 --> 3:59:35.520]  to offer.
[3:59:35.520 --> 3:59:41.520]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[3:59:41.520 --> 3:59:46.720]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.

[3:59:47.720 --> 4:00:03.880]  The first step is getting storable food.
