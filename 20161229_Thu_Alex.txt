[00:00.000 --> 00:14.480]  It's already the 29th of the day of December 2016, we've got a key report for you right
[00:14.480 --> 00:15.480]  now.
[00:15.480 --> 00:22.800]  Breaking down the Indiana Air Force.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in Occupied
[00:22.800 --> 00:29.400]  Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against
[00:29.400 --> 00:36.400]  the technotronic, technocracy tank goper.
[00:36.400 --> 00:39.840]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:39.840 --> 00:49.720]  If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever.
[00:49.720 --> 00:58.720]  The moral to be drawn from this dangerous nightmare situation is a simple one.
[00:58.720 --> 01:08.200]  The Internet's renaissance of media, living on a revolutionary platform that has exponentially
[01:08.200 --> 01:16.560]  boomed since it was conceived at UCLA on October 29, 1969, is yet again under attack.
[01:16.560 --> 01:22.840]  This bane to the New World Order and adversely a voice of humanity simply disseminating the
[01:22.840 --> 01:29.120]  truth behind the mainstream media's governmental facade must be controlled and centralized
[01:29.120 --> 01:33.440]  if the power structure is to remain.
[01:33.440 --> 01:39.020]  So while America innocently celebrated the holidays, America's shadow government buried
[01:39.020 --> 01:45.320]  a time bomb in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, relegating control of the
[01:45.320 --> 01:58.320]  free press to what is being dubbed the State Department's Ministry of Truth.
[01:58.320 --> 02:27.880]  Zero Hedge reported on
[02:27.880 --> 02:36.240]  Christmas Day, quote, introduced by Congressman Adam Kinzinger and Ted Liu, HR 5181 seeks
[02:36.240 --> 02:42.640]  a whole government approach without the bureaucratic restrictions to counter foreign disinformation
[02:42.640 --> 02:48.320]  and manipulation, which they believe threatens the world's security and stability.
[02:48.320 --> 02:53.840]  Also called the Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016, when introduced in March by
[02:53.840 --> 03:00.680]  Senator Rob Portman, the legislation represents a dramatic return to Cold War-era government
[03:00.680 --> 03:02.000]  propaganda battles.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  On the heels of the death of SOPA and PIPA, the U.S. government's audacious attack on
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.120]  a free press emboldened by the Internet quickened with the legalization of propaganda within
[03:13.120 --> 03:19.480]  the United States Interior in 2013 after the death of the longstanding Smith-Mon act, the
[03:19.480 --> 03:25.560]  creeping UN and EU control of the Internet after the U.S. Commerce Department released
[03:25.560 --> 03:32.680]  its grasp to ICANN on October 1 of 2016, the rollout of the fake news narrative and its
[03:32.680 --> 03:38.640]  impending censorship by the bullying anti-first amendment purveyors of news commandeering
[03:38.640 --> 03:45.240]  sites like Facebook and now the final nail in the coffin after the 2017 NDAA was signed
[03:45.240 --> 03:47.480]  into law on December 23.
[03:47.480 --> 03:53.640]  The Ministry of Truth framework is in place and the game is now completely rigged.
[03:53.640 --> 03:59.720]  In the words of selfless, wonderkind Aaron Swartz, information is power, but like all
[03:59.720 --> 04:03.320]  power there are those who want to keep it for themselves.
[04:03.320 --> 04:08.320]  And as if answering Swartz from across the expanse of time and space, founding father
[04:08.320 --> 04:13.440]  Thomas Jefferson prophetically said, the basis of our government's being the opinion of
[04:13.440 --> 04:19.040]  the people, the very first object should be to keep that right.
[04:19.040 --> 04:23.800]  And were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers
[04:23.800 --> 04:29.680]  or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.
[04:29.680 --> 04:35.600]  But I should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them.
[04:35.600 --> 04:44.120]  The question is, how does one man, a certain power owner, know that making himself a executive
[04:44.120 --> 04:49.640]  power is tearing the human minds apart and putting them together again in new shapes
[04:49.640 --> 04:51.160]  of your own choosing?
[04:51.160 --> 04:53.160]  John Bound for Enforce.com
[04:53.160 --> 04:58.000]  By the Priest of Power, when it's all about attacking humanity, attacking God, we're
[04:58.000 --> 05:01.320]  devil worshipers.
[05:01.320 --> 05:06.400]  But it surprised you to know that ISIS and Hezbollah are operating freely in Latin America
[05:06.400 --> 05:10.480]  and these Islamic terrorists, they can raise money and they're all planning to attack the
[05:10.480 --> 05:12.480]  United States while in Latin America.
[05:12.480 --> 05:16.160]  Now, this part of the world has become a hotbed for Islamic terrorism.
[05:16.160 --> 05:20.160]  Groups like ISIS operate freely, they're able to raise large sums of money to finance
[05:20.160 --> 05:23.080]  activities in other countries, mainly here in the United States.
[05:23.080 --> 05:27.160]  Now, this is according to one report released by Spain's Defense Ministry.
[05:27.160 --> 05:31.720]  I'm quoting directly here, Latin America represents an important region for Islamic radicalism
[05:31.720 --> 05:35.920]  because conditions enable the free, almost undetectable movement of their members throughout
[05:35.920 --> 05:36.920]  the region.
[05:36.920 --> 05:41.800]  The U.S. has been largely not focused on the Latin American activity, but this specifically
[05:41.800 --> 05:47.280]  highlights the fact that ISIS and Hezbollah, they can operate freely in Spain, raise money
[05:47.280 --> 05:51.800]  and their government in the region is considering ISIS to be a foreign problem, this report
[05:51.800 --> 05:56.240]  is saying, and intelligence agencies are ill-equipped to handle the threat that they represent.
[05:56.240 --> 06:01.000]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com.
[06:01.000 --> 06:06.320]  All across the Western world, MSM is attempting to demonize the language and words we use,
[06:06.320 --> 06:10.800]  saying, don't say Merry Christmas, use holidays, and now they say don't use holiday, oh I got
[06:10.800 --> 06:12.000]  some news for them.
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.120]  We're going to continue to use the speech we feel like using, and we're going to exercise
[06:16.120 --> 06:21.760]  the First Amendment in your globalist tyrannical faces, and that's why I'm extending the Christmas

[07:00.840 --> 07:05.760]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what has been called
[07:05.760 --> 07:06.760]  the iodine conspiracy.
[07:06.760 --> 07:11.320]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[07:11.320 --> 07:16.520]  devastate IQ, and how the government, knowingly, started taking iodine out of the food and
[07:16.520 --> 07:20.280]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[07:20.280 --> 07:23.960]  They took the good halogen-L and put the deadly halogen in.
[07:23.960 --> 07:28.520]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[07:28.520 --> 07:30.920]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[07:30.920 --> 07:36.440]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[07:36.440 --> 07:42.200]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[07:42.200 --> 07:43.800]  ever concerning iodine.
[07:43.800 --> 07:45.760]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[07:45.760 --> 07:50.040]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[07:50.040 --> 07:52.040]  any optimum health regimen.
[07:52.040 --> 08:00.040]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[08:00.040 --> 08:18.040]  This is the heart of 1776, your new white male!
[08:18.040 --> 08:22.520]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[08:22.520 --> 08:23.520]  Move, bitch!
[08:23.520 --> 08:24.520]  Get out of the way!
[08:24.520 --> 08:33.520]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[08:33.520 --> 08:37.840]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[08:37.840 --> 08:41.320]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[08:41.320 --> 08:47.160]  I will not let you down, you'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking
[08:47.160 --> 08:48.160]  a lot.
[08:48.160 --> 08:49.800]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[08:49.800 --> 08:55.400]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[08:55.400 --> 08:58.240]  Waging war on corruption is...
[08:58.240 --> 08:59.240]  Alex Jones.
[08:59.240 --> 09:19.760]  We're now only 21 days out from the historic inauguration of Donald Trump.
[09:19.760 --> 09:27.240]  John Trump, the 45th, baby, and return the Republic.
[09:27.240 --> 09:31.280]  Return the Republic to its former freeness.
[09:31.280 --> 09:36.000]  Its greatness is the economic powerhouse of the globe.
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.640]  Only then can we be the cultural and military powerhouse.
[09:39.640 --> 09:49.040]  The return of America is upon us if we simply continue to breathe life into its lungs.
[09:49.040 --> 09:55.440]  It is Thursday, the 29th of December 2016, in the waning twilight hours of this historic
[09:55.440 --> 10:04.600]  year as we plunge into 2017, which is guaranteed to be even more tumultuous, more hard fought,
[10:04.600 --> 10:10.200]  more bitter, but also more exhilarating and filled with opportunity.
[10:10.200 --> 10:16.480]  Fortune favors the bold, and our fortune is freedom in our time.
[10:16.480 --> 10:19.280]  The mission is hard, but not impossible.
[10:19.280 --> 10:22.160]  You've got a long way to go.
[10:22.160 --> 10:29.000]  It's a short time to get there, but the taste of victory is now revitalizing the Republic,
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.840]  and like the fiery bird of myth, the phoenix is rising.
[10:33.840 --> 10:40.480]  All right, let's get really focused here.
[10:40.480 --> 10:46.520]  GrudgeReport.com has an incredible grouping of stories that everybody must look at on
[10:46.520 --> 10:50.160]  the right-hand side.
[10:50.160 --> 10:55.880]  You cannot make up the oxymoronic, upside-down world of this.
[10:55.880 --> 11:05.160]  Soros says Trump is a would-be dictator who threatens the New World Order.
[11:05.160 --> 11:09.560]  That's an infowars.com story, top story on the right-hand side, and under it you can
[11:09.560 --> 11:14.680]  actually read the full screed of diarrhea out of Soros' mouth.
[11:14.680 --> 11:20.680]  Billionaire globalist pins panicked rant, and boy is it panicked.
[11:20.680 --> 11:27.600]  He says we cannot stop nationalism, and he said not since I was a young man have I feared
[11:27.600 --> 11:29.480]  Trump is Hitler.
[11:29.480 --> 11:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, he actually calls Trump Hitler and a dictator.
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.160]  He calls him a Hitlerian dictator.
[11:40.160 --> 11:42.480]  Now is this lost on anyone?
[11:42.480 --> 11:55.760]  George Soros is a famous Nazi collaborator from the age of 13 to 17, because no one thought
[11:55.760 --> 12:01.560]  that a young Jew coming in and claiming he was helping get food to groups that were hiding
[12:01.560 --> 12:03.480]  would actually be a Nazi agent.
[12:03.480 --> 12:11.400]  He was a literal Nazi agent of the lowest scumbag order, and he's going to lecture us
[12:11.400 --> 12:12.600]  about Adolf Hitler.
[12:12.600 --> 12:14.720]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[12:14.720 --> 12:17.720]  It is the total complete inversion of reality.
[12:17.720 --> 12:22.360]  We have him on 60 minutes saying he is not ashamed of what he did.
[12:22.360 --> 12:29.280]  It's how he, quote, survived a total sociopath who's got a big giant, you know what, for
[12:29.280 --> 12:36.600]  America, arranging, you know what, to screw this country, and guess what, scumbag.
[12:36.600 --> 12:38.000]  You think you're losing now.
[12:38.000 --> 12:39.680]  Go ahead and start a war.
[12:39.680 --> 12:41.440]  Go ahead and try to assassinate Trump.
[12:41.440 --> 12:44.360]  Go ahead and fill your hand, you rat bastard.
[12:44.360 --> 12:49.600]  We're going to get you.
[12:49.600 --> 12:53.040]  And I'm glad they've tried to take down Trump and put up his lies, because the gloves are
[12:53.040 --> 12:58.800]  off now, brother, and when Trump gets in office in 21 days, get ready, scum, because you should
[12:58.800 --> 13:05.360]  have been arrested and in a lot of trouble back when you were 15 years old.
[13:05.360 --> 13:08.480]  You can run on for a long time, boy.
[13:08.480 --> 13:11.840]  I mean, look at your failure son.
[13:11.840 --> 13:12.840]  He's a laughing stock.
[13:12.840 --> 13:14.320]  That's who you're going to have run your empire.
[13:14.320 --> 13:16.800]  You'd rather blow the planet up, wouldn't you, scumbag?
[13:16.800 --> 13:20.440]  You're not going to get away with it.
[13:20.440 --> 13:25.120]  You are a true supervillain out to hurt good people.
[13:25.120 --> 13:26.560]  You hate Christians.
[13:26.560 --> 13:27.960]  You're a dirtbag.
[13:27.960 --> 13:32.240]  And it's in the WikiLeaks how you want to overthrow Israel.
[13:32.240 --> 13:36.760]  Of course you're allied and your new pivot is with the Islamists and people, Israel's
[13:36.760 --> 13:37.760]  got its problems.
[13:37.760 --> 13:41.720]  It's a diverse modern country, my God.
[13:41.720 --> 13:47.040]  But we're going to side with Soros and the Islamists, the suicide bomb, their little
[13:47.040 --> 13:48.040]  kids.
[13:48.040 --> 13:50.400]  No, no.
[13:50.400 --> 13:52.400]  This is disgusting.
[13:52.400 --> 13:57.200]  And a lot of people out there have been brainwashed into just obsessing on Israel all day and hating
[13:57.200 --> 13:58.200]  Israel.
[13:58.200 --> 14:02.800]  And it's quite frankly shameful.
[14:02.800 --> 14:07.080]  Because the only way to get rid of Israel is a nuclear war, and the Arabs would start
[14:07.080 --> 14:11.760]  killing each other the minute they got control of the Holy Land.
[14:11.760 --> 14:19.600]  Long before Muhammad showed up in Mecca riding around robbing caravans and sex-slaven, there
[14:19.600 --> 14:23.400]  were Jews in Jerusalem, Jack.
[14:23.400 --> 14:32.080]  3,000 plus years ago, on record, Roman historians, Greek historians, it's a fact.
[14:32.080 --> 14:35.760]  No amount of revisionist history will erase that or that Jesus Christ existed.
[14:35.760 --> 14:38.560]  I see articles in Time Magazine that Jesus didn't exist.
[14:38.560 --> 14:42.080]  Oh, there's only like 20 Roman historians wrote about him at the time.
[14:42.080 --> 14:46.360]  Five or six Jewish historians, you're a pack of liars.
[14:46.360 --> 14:50.640]  I suspect they're going to tell us George Washington didn't exist next.
[14:50.640 --> 14:51.720]  I'm tired of it.
[14:51.720 --> 14:52.960]  I'm tired of the ignorance.
[14:52.960 --> 14:55.080]  I'm tired of the idiocy.
[14:55.080 --> 14:56.840]  And I just can't take it anymore.
[14:56.840 --> 14:57.840]  It is not fair.
[14:57.840 --> 14:58.840]  And I've used this story a million times.
[14:58.840 --> 15:05.360]  It's so true that both my grandfathers almost died in World War II in the Army Air Corps.
[15:05.360 --> 15:06.360]  Both of them almost died.
[15:06.360 --> 15:10.080]  One of them crashed land at the other, did his missions, had volunteered for more, but
[15:10.080 --> 15:18.160]  got sunstroke from not wearing sunglasses, burned his eyes, he was blind for a week,
[15:18.160 --> 15:23.000]  and the crew went up with the co-pilot and got blown up and died over Italy.
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.080]  They were attacking out of North Africa.
[15:25.080 --> 15:28.800]  And then he almost died when German fighter bombers hit their bases once they got into
[15:28.800 --> 15:29.800]  Italy.
[15:29.800 --> 15:34.760]  He got a purple heart for that, but the point is, I get called a Nazi by the ADL who gives
[15:34.760 --> 15:40.160]  awards to Soros and Schwarzenegger, who says he admires Hitler.
[15:40.160 --> 15:45.040]  When I almost don't exist, because you killed my grandfathers, you killed me.
[15:45.040 --> 15:50.240]  And then I've got to sit here and watch a known Nazi collaborator hop around and call
[15:50.240 --> 15:53.480]  our president a Nazi.
[15:53.480 --> 15:56.800]  George Soros' groups also called him anti-Semitic throughout the campaign.
[15:56.800 --> 16:05.680]  I mean, this is the complete inversion of reality.
[16:05.680 --> 16:06.680]  Not shocking.
[16:06.680 --> 16:08.620]  George Soros funds progressive war on Israel.
[16:08.620 --> 16:11.840]  He wants to overthrow it, folks.
[16:11.840 --> 16:13.640]  The guy is a total demon.
[16:13.640 --> 16:16.120]  He wants your guns, he wants your family.
[16:16.120 --> 16:17.640]  He believes the state should run you.
[16:17.640 --> 16:19.800]  He's a control freak.
[16:19.800 --> 16:21.720]  He's a monster.
[16:21.720 --> 16:23.160]  He wants power.
[16:23.160 --> 16:26.160]  He's behind flooding Europe with his llamasist.
[16:26.160 --> 16:35.800]  But I'm telling you, this goes to another level that no media is pointing out, that Soros
[16:35.800 --> 16:36.800]  is a Nazi.
[16:36.800 --> 16:42.440]  And, you know, I've had a lot of people on the show before, and I start bashing Soros,
[16:42.440 --> 16:46.480]  liberals, who are on the historians' authors, you name it, and they'll go, Alex, now come
[16:46.480 --> 16:48.480]  on, Soros had to or he'd get killed.
[16:48.480 --> 16:53.480]  That's like saying, I've got to join the New World Order or I'll get killed.
[16:53.480 --> 16:57.160]  It's the most sociopathic mindset I've ever seen in my life.
[16:57.160 --> 16:58.160]  And it's the creed of slaves.
[16:58.160 --> 17:00.280]  So the story's up on infowars.com.
[17:00.280 --> 17:01.880]  It's obviously on drudgerport.com.
[17:01.880 --> 17:03.920]  It's a Paul Joseph Watson article.
[17:03.920 --> 17:09.960]  Soros conjures Hitler in attack on ascendant populist.
[17:09.960 --> 17:13.720]  That's the area that Zero Hedge decided to zero in on.
[17:13.720 --> 17:17.200]  We should have a whole other article out just about.
[17:17.200 --> 17:23.720]  Famous Nazi collaborator says Trump reminds him of Hitler.
[17:23.720 --> 17:24.720]  What in the world?
[17:24.720 --> 17:28.280]  He says, I'm afraid of Nazis.
[17:28.280 --> 17:29.680]  What?
[17:29.680 --> 17:31.640]  You are a Nazi dirtbag.
[17:31.640 --> 17:34.120]  You're the lowest scum on earth.
[17:34.120 --> 17:37.520]  At least the Nazis thought they were doing something for a good reason.
[17:37.520 --> 17:38.680]  They were out of their minds.
[17:38.680 --> 17:44.480]  In a death cult, you were a collaborator against your own people and betrayed them scumbag
[17:44.480 --> 17:49.680]  and made money off of it with your daddy.
[17:49.680 --> 17:53.000]  He was a little Judas goat, they said, and kind of like pedophiles sent a teenager in
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.720]  or another kid to get other kids lured to the van.
[17:55.720 --> 18:02.120]  Yes, George Soros was the bait they would throw out to bring in and find where the Jews
[18:02.120 --> 18:03.120]  were hidden.
[18:03.120 --> 18:06.680]  I mean, you just cannot make this stuff up.
[18:06.680 --> 18:08.440]  You couldn't write this stuff.
[18:08.440 --> 18:09.720]  No one would believe it.
[18:09.720 --> 18:14.280]  And now he's perched on top of the country blaming Russia for America turning against
[18:14.280 --> 18:17.040]  Hillary while she's stumbling around having convulsions.
[18:17.040 --> 18:18.320]  Everybody's sick of her.
[18:18.320 --> 18:19.320]  Russia wasn't involved in anything.
[18:19.320 --> 18:24.480]  You've got the Communist Chinese, the EU, the Vatican, the Soviet Arabians all piled
[18:24.480 --> 18:28.040]  up on our election saying we can't have Trump.
[18:28.040 --> 18:29.320]  That gets overthrown.
[18:29.320 --> 18:35.000]  And now Obama is set to announce all sorts of wartime measures and troop buildups and
[18:35.000 --> 18:42.000]  cyber attacks and diplomatic freezing of Russian money and all this economic war with 21 days
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.000]  out.
[18:43.000 --> 18:44.280]  And I was watching CNN.
[18:44.280 --> 18:45.440]  I forget the names of the shows.
[18:45.440 --> 18:46.440]  I really watched it.
[18:46.440 --> 18:47.440]  I was watching it last night.
[18:47.440 --> 18:48.840]  And they had a round table group on.
[18:48.840 --> 18:50.720]  I've got to go look at the show host.
[18:50.720 --> 18:53.840]  It was like 6.30 at night.
[18:53.840 --> 18:55.360]  Who's on at 6.30?
[18:55.360 --> 18:57.160]  Some guy, I don't know his name.
[18:57.160 --> 18:58.560]  And some gray-haired dude.
[18:58.560 --> 19:03.640]  He had this round table on there and they were in folks just like before 9.11, 25 days
[19:03.640 --> 19:05.800]  before.
[19:05.800 --> 19:08.240]  I came on there and I said they're going to blow up World Trade Center, blame it on
[19:08.240 --> 19:09.240]  bin Laden.
[19:09.240 --> 19:10.240]  Get ready for terrorism.
[19:10.240 --> 19:12.600]  I saw the same telltale signs.
[19:12.600 --> 19:17.400]  They said it is going to be Trump's fault, the war that's coming now.
[19:17.400 --> 19:19.080]  Islam is going to attack Europe and Israel.
[19:19.080 --> 19:22.680]  There is a giant war coming and there's going to be a war with Russia and it is Trump's
[19:22.680 --> 19:27.680]  fault and all the round table goes, it's very sad, but it is to be.
[19:27.680 --> 19:29.560]  And you can tell the fix is in.
[19:29.560 --> 19:31.120]  They're going to start World War III.
[19:31.120 --> 19:35.720]  They're a freaking loon cult who are under Stockholm syndrome and under Arabist control
[19:35.720 --> 19:40.000]  and this is a real pivot to Islam and the takedown of the West and it was a cult of
[19:40.000 --> 19:46.760]  scum, a bunch of CIA operatives up there on the show all committing to a giant war and
[19:46.760 --> 19:49.680]  then America is going to have to be destroyed now because we voted for Trump.
[19:49.680 --> 19:56.240]  I mean criminals love to brag and I saw them do the pre-celebration of World War III and
[19:56.240 --> 19:57.960]  the destruction of Israel in the United States.
[19:57.960 --> 20:05.120]  I saw psychopathic behavior, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a
[20:05.120 --> 20:07.800]  plan and place to survive.
[20:07.800 --> 20:08.800]  Forget bunkers.

[24:47.400 --> 24:51.360]  They act like no one can think but them, it's this disconnect plus they're not even telling
[24:51.360 --> 24:56.680]  us what their real aims are, they're saying to the world, you elected Trump, so we're
[24:56.680 --> 25:01.040]  going to start a war with Russia, we're going to start a war in the Middle East and we're
[25:01.040 --> 25:07.120]  going to give a green light for the new intifada, that means a giant uprising, a rebellion, a
[25:07.120 --> 25:17.040]  civil war initiated by the United States siding with the United Nations to plunge the globe
[25:17.040 --> 25:20.080]  into a worldwide crisis.
[25:20.080 --> 25:25.480]  Not for the Palestinians, the globalist financed Islamist invasion of Syria that's killed
[25:25.480 --> 25:30.760]  over 300,000 people, almost all of them Christians and non-radical Muslims.
[25:30.760 --> 25:36.720]  They call it a conspiracy theory that our government financed this in the last six years.
[25:36.720 --> 25:41.120]  It's all public, Congress has had hearings, the military's gone public.
[25:41.120 --> 25:46.360]  It's like the news is saying it's a conspiracy that the United States was behind the vote
[25:46.360 --> 25:48.760]  at the UN and the abstention.
[25:48.760 --> 25:54.000]  They're behind the whole deal, they've bragged they're behind it, it's a new type of psychological
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.760]  warfare and I don't think it's working, I think it's delusion where they go, we're
[25:57.760 --> 26:04.600]  not behind this vote even though they admit they are, there's no IRS penalties, there's
[26:04.600 --> 26:11.200]  not 18,000 IRS agents in Obamacare, the hell they're in, it's right there in the bill
[26:11.200 --> 26:16.240]  and now people are getting hit with it, that's what I mean, I think these people are crazy,
[26:16.240 --> 26:22.720]  they've got a method to what they're doing but it's total delusion, cuckoo cocoa puff
[26:22.720 --> 26:33.920]  land, it's crazy because the whole world, I mean they've got polls of 60 plus percent
[26:33.920 --> 26:39.440]  of Americans on the low end, 80 plus percent on the high end, in dozens of polls you've
[26:39.440 --> 26:44.080]  all seen them, almost no one's buying that Russia was involved in our election and people
[26:44.080 --> 26:48.720]  don't care because it was a global free for all of all these other countries trying to
[26:48.720 --> 26:59.920]  say we can't have a populist movement but when Soros and globalist publications like
[26:59.920 --> 27:03.120]  The Financial Times and The Economist and The New York Times admit what's happening,
[27:03.120 --> 27:08.000]  they know it's not racism, they know it's not Hitlerian, they know it's just classic
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.160]  nationalism where we want economic systems that are good for us as countries and as
[27:12.160 --> 27:18.320]  individuals not good for the globalist and their big world government project.
[27:18.320 --> 27:25.760]  We don't want to be ruled by secret TPP and WTO and all these unlawful treaties that
[27:25.760 --> 27:31.200]  don't even get ratified most of the time but we live under them, just like the UK never
[27:31.200 --> 27:35.680]  voted in the 80s and the 90s under the different treaties like Lisbon to enter it and people
[27:35.680 --> 27:39.760]  are like we didn't vote to enter and it makes over 90 percent of our laws and it's flooding
[27:39.760 --> 27:45.120]  us with unskilled dangerous jihadists we don't want to be part of this and they say shut up you
[27:45.120 --> 27:51.280]  are under it we don't care how you voted. People say well Alex see what did it matter they're
[27:51.280 --> 27:56.960]  ignoring it good that'll blow up in their face bigger you mean the UK says we vote to get out you
[27:56.960 --> 28:03.440]  say no? We have the moral high ground we're going to win that's why they're panicking it's why
[28:03.440 --> 28:07.360]  they're freaking out it's why they're pulling their hair out and we come back I have a clip
[28:07.360 --> 28:11.520]  of him on 16 minutes saying he did what he had to working with the Nazis
[28:14.160 --> 28:17.760]  that'd be like if somebody said kill your family or we'll kill you I'd say pull the freaking trigger
[28:18.880 --> 28:24.640]  but I'd try to take you out before I did that but it's this attitude to lay down and give up
[28:25.440 --> 28:30.880]  only one Jewish neighborhood stood up against the Nazis in the Warsaw ghetto in Poland and they
[28:30.880 --> 28:37.360]  killed its estimated over 5,000 of them in just a year and it took them months and months and months
[28:37.360 --> 28:44.080]  even take the ghetto finally one group of Jews maybe a thousand stood up with a couple firearms
[28:44.080 --> 28:47.680]  and held the Nazis off for months what would have happened if people would have stood up against
[28:47.680 --> 28:53.920]  Hitler in Europe we wouldn't have had this crap and now we have this little monster running around
[28:53.920 --> 29:01.280]  overthrowing countries destabilizing the Middle East backing jihadists overthrowing Ukraine trying
[29:01.280 --> 29:06.480]  to start a war with Russia and he's financing the democratic party to try to start a war with Russia
[29:06.480 --> 29:11.600]  and a war with Israel because he's throwing a temper tantrum there he is in the news billionaire
[29:11.600 --> 29:19.120]  globalist pens panic rant we have a dangerous psychopathic demon in control of the democratic
[29:19.120 --> 29:25.920]  party and msm trying to start a freaking world war and i get the fact he's a Rothschild agent
[29:25.920 --> 29:31.440]  that's why he's so powerful and you guys think you're invincible you're not the Rothschild sued
[29:31.440 --> 29:36.240]  british newspapers for saying they were behind the new world order they lost in court five years ago
[29:37.200 --> 29:40.800]  and the court said no this this finds you were behind the russian oligarchs and stuck in that
[29:40.800 --> 29:45.840]  country drive i'm telling soros the Rockefellers the Rothschilds and everybody else you're not
[29:45.840 --> 29:50.080]  gonna pull this off in the dark this time you understand we got a big old spotlight on your
[29:50.080 --> 29:57.280]  butt we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:01.040 --> 30:06.320]  would it surprise you to know that isis and hezbollah are operating freely in latin america
[30:06.320 --> 30:10.400]  and these islamic terrorists they can raise money and they're all planning to attack the
[30:10.400 --> 30:15.280]  united states while in latin america now this part of the world has become a hotbed for islamic
[30:15.280 --> 30:20.160]  terrorism groups like isis operate freely they're able to raise large sums of money to finance
[30:20.160 --> 30:24.800]  activities in other countries mainly here in the united states now this is according to one report
[30:24.800 --> 30:30.000]  released by spain's defense ministry i'm quoting directly here latin america represents an important
[30:30.000 --> 30:34.800]  region for islamic radicalism because conditions enable the free almost undetectable movement
[30:34.800 --> 30:40.160]  of their members throughout the region the us has been largely not focused on the latin american
[30:40.160 --> 30:45.760]  activity but this specifically highlights the fact that isis and hezbollah they can operate freely
[30:45.760 --> 30:50.880]  in spain raise money and their government in the region is considering isis to be a foreign
[30:50.880 --> 30:55.040]  problem this report is saying and intelligence agencies are ill-equipped to handle the threat

[32:58.480 --> 33:14.400]  at info wars live dot com
[33:19.680 --> 33:27.360]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex
[33:27.360 --> 33:34.080]  jones
[33:34.080 --> 33:37.840]  it was albert pike who was the head of the eliminating after the civil war he's also
[33:37.840 --> 33:44.000]  the founder of the kkk that famously wrote in the 1870s there would be three world wars
[33:44.720 --> 33:50.720]  to bring in world government and the final would be between christians with jews against the muslims
[33:51.440 --> 33:55.600]  and that out of that would come such a hatred of religion that we would accept a one world
[33:55.600 --> 34:01.040]  religion and the one true god lucifer now whether you believe they're following that
[34:01.040 --> 34:07.520]  plan or not today this is the plan being manifested on our planet and the roth child you'd ask
[34:08.080 --> 34:14.240]  why did they help found israel and then why are roth child institutions today funding
[34:14.240 --> 34:18.880]  movements against israel as we see in the wiki leaks through one of their operatives
[34:18.880 --> 34:26.000]  that's come out in court george soros because it's the chaos that has to be brought in to
[34:26.000 --> 34:32.160]  establish the world government it's just like there were a lot of powerful jewish institutions
[34:32.160 --> 34:37.440]  and groups that wouldn't let jews get out of europe and they had to pay on average over a million
[34:37.440 --> 34:44.480]  dollars equivalent to different organizations to be able to get out of the country and they were
[34:44.480 --> 34:53.440]  only allowed to go to palestine that's why f dr refused so many jews trying to come into new york
[34:53.440 --> 34:58.560]  and sent them back to nazi germany and i'm not even attacking f dr it's a historic fact
[34:58.560 --> 35:05.360]  that's people like dr steve pacenic who was part catholic part jewish uh he had to come into cuba
[35:05.360 --> 35:09.200]  when he was a little kid during world war two because the united states wouldn't take him the
[35:09.200 --> 35:16.320]  ships got diverted to cuba that's where a bunch of jews went and that's why people like pacenic
[35:16.320 --> 35:22.080]  you know don't like the adl and organizations like that because jews that are actually well read
[35:22.080 --> 35:26.560]  know what i'm saying is absolute historical fact that's why it isn't just are you for the jews or
[35:26.560 --> 35:30.960]  you against the jews are you clear cut for israel or are you against israel i got a lot of problems
[35:30.960 --> 35:35.200]  with different political parties in israel stuff that goes on i'm a big human rights advocate
[35:35.200 --> 35:40.480]  but the israelis aren't sending their kids to be suicide bombers they're not flooding us with
[35:40.480 --> 35:45.040]  five million people in europe hundreds of thousands here that said they want to overthrow us the
[35:45.040 --> 35:50.960]  globalists have pivoted to islam this is a real triple cross folks they're not just doing a class
[35:50.960 --> 35:56.560]  of civilizations that's what they sold a lot of the military and insiders on with 9 11 that was
[35:56.560 --> 36:01.920]  supposed to be some excuse to crush islam it was actually to put saudi arabia in charge
[36:01.920 --> 36:08.480]  knockout the countries that were blocking radical islam like saddam in iraq uh Assad in syria so this
[36:08.480 --> 36:14.160]  is the grand chessboard and they're panicking because trump understands this the military brass
[36:14.160 --> 36:19.840]  understand this they're making deals with russia they're making deals with japan they're making
[36:19.840 --> 36:27.120]  deals to double cross all the double crossers like china and others and it's not been clear where is
[36:27.120 --> 36:31.920]  real was going to side in all of this and the lacudniks and netanyahu they didn't really give
[36:31.920 --> 36:39.840]  any overt support to trump well now the globalists have miscalculated and they think holding the
[36:39.840 --> 36:44.880]  world hostage to nuclear warfare is going to bully everybody into acceptance in fact they say you
[36:44.880 --> 36:50.720]  better accept globalism well there's going to be a big war and now they're hitting the dominoes
[36:50.720 --> 36:55.680]  that will chain reaction into a giant regional war that will probably get bigger because if any
[36:55.680 --> 37:01.840]  nato forces or others hit russian forces in syria it's off the races that's why you notice they just
[37:01.840 --> 37:08.880]  did a deal to begin the process of splitting syria in three pieces which was the older plan again going
[37:08.880 --> 37:16.160]  back to eisenhower everything trump's doing is an older pro america stabilize the world promote
[37:16.160 --> 37:23.360]  freedom plan that got killed in the mid 60s with lbj everything's going back to that plan that's why
[37:23.360 --> 37:27.440]  i mean they've literally taken these plans off the shelves and again no one else knows this no one
[37:27.440 --> 37:31.920]  else talks about this but insiders you're getting the inside scoop here which i've already reverse
[37:31.920 --> 37:36.320]  engineered reason all the insiders listen to me is already reverse engineered all this because most
[37:36.320 --> 37:40.560]  of its in white papers in documents here and there and then you have wezzly clark and many
[37:40.560 --> 37:48.000]  and others and and just now it's known so there is a race here against a plan for americana global
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.280]  domination through industry and ideas or through global corporate governance under the imf and
[37:53.280 --> 37:59.520]  world bank and there's two different competing systems so russia just completed a ceasefire deal
[38:00.160 --> 38:06.480]  between the rebels it's all the factions saying they'll split the country in three parts
[38:09.280 --> 38:14.800]  now that's an older us plan the plan currently was handed over to saudi arabia and let well hobbyist
[38:14.800 --> 38:20.720]  kill all the shiites kill all the alawites kill all the christians and turn into a backwards hell hole
[38:23.440 --> 38:24.640]  but a lot of folks now
[38:26.960 --> 38:33.600]  are looking at giving some of the desert eaten out areas that border iraq to the islamic state
[38:33.600 --> 38:39.440]  basically to saudi arabia and then having a Kurdish area and then having the main coastline
[38:39.440 --> 38:47.840]  and the main cities which is classically damascus and aleppo and other areas to the people that
[38:47.840 --> 38:54.160]  want to have a multicultural system now that said i want to get back into soros and the bomb
[38:54.160 --> 38:59.760]  shell news here he is on 60 minutes they try to remove this clip everywhere but it's fair use
[38:59.760 --> 39:03.440]  the public has a right to know this and then here's some of the historical background as well
[39:03.440 --> 39:08.400]  george soros saying he did what he had to do working with the nazis in eastern europe rounding
[39:08.400 --> 39:14.640]  up fellow jews to be sent to death camps from 1944 of what happened to george soros's friends in
[39:14.640 --> 39:24.800]  neighbors europe hungarian jew who escaped the holocaust by posing as a christian and
[39:26.240 --> 39:32.800]  you watched lots of people get shipped off to the dead camp site that was 14 years old and i would
[39:32.800 --> 39:39.840]  say that that's what my character was made it was a tremendous threat of evil i mean this was a
[39:39.840 --> 39:46.720]  very personal experience of evil my understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours
[39:47.360 --> 39:54.960]  who swore that you were his adopted god son yes went out in fact and helped in the confiscation
[39:54.960 --> 40:01.680]  of property from the jew that's right i mean that sounds like an experience that would send
[40:01.680 --> 40:07.600]  lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many many years was it difficult
[40:11.760 --> 40:17.680]  it was actually probably the happiest year of my life that the year of german occupation
[40:19.760 --> 40:24.640]  and mcgrain did it i knew that there was a leslie stall interview and the other one
[40:24.640 --> 40:29.600]  there were two 60 minutes interviews and i hadn't been able to find in years because they were moved
[40:29.600 --> 40:35.040]  it off all the platforms where he says it was the happiest year of his life now that was a video
[40:35.040 --> 40:40.480]  for radio listeners that actually had historical documents film clips of the nazi holocaust and
[40:40.480 --> 40:45.200]  the rest of it but we're going to put out a dry one if we can mcgrain i know darin mcgrain's listening
[40:45.200 --> 40:50.560]  that has both of the tv interviews where he in context says it's one of the happiest times in
[40:50.560 --> 40:54.800]  his life rounding up fellow jews and sending him off to be worked to death and murdered
[40:54.800 --> 41:03.360]  after they had ibm control members put on their arms notice who runs the technology today oh it's ibm
[41:07.200 --> 41:10.800]  you see one side of the ross child's family actually worked with the nazis
[41:10.800 --> 41:14.640]  and the family split and the french roth child's actually got rounded up and killed
[41:14.640 --> 41:21.120]  these are some nasty people we're dealing with and soros is the type of person he's globalist
[41:21.120 --> 41:28.720]  will work with because he helped round up his own people as well this is some nasty nasty nasty evil
[41:28.720 --> 41:34.000]  folks but if you look at criminology and organized crime they're always feeding on their lowers
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.480]  they're always scapegoating their minions they're always flushing their own people down the toilet
[41:38.480 --> 41:48.960]  and using them dishonor is the name so two articles up on info wars dot com several are also
[41:48.960 --> 41:54.800]  up on drugs report dot com it's easiest place to find them i want this red link paul didn't
[41:54.800 --> 42:00.720]  red link this i think paul should red link his article soros trump is a would-be dictator
[42:00.720 --> 42:04.320]  who threatens the new world order and i want to be clear here before i get into this
[42:06.560 --> 42:12.800]  they've gone from being hysterical and fearful and craven on the news i've been watching body
[42:12.800 --> 42:18.400]  language and statements to now being committed and being back on a power trip and criminals love
[42:18.400 --> 42:24.160]  to tell so watching the situation room last night with their filling host the whole round table of
[42:24.160 --> 42:28.560]  little minion insiders admitted that there's going to be a new giant war in the middle east if they
[42:28.560 --> 42:33.120]  can to be blamed on trump and they're going to have the media blame the the the economic collapse
[42:33.120 --> 42:38.480]  and the carnage that's going to come i guess the next 20 days or so if they have their way will be
[42:38.480 --> 42:46.960]  blamed on trump and they were on the situation room going i'm going to find the clips i guess it's
[42:46.960 --> 42:51.280]  just going to be his fault this giant war yes so be it it's his fault and they would all lean
[42:51.280 --> 42:57.440]  forward and look down like they're planning something really bad i was watching hardcore slime
[42:58.320 --> 43:01.040]  who looked like they were again criminals in a bunker
[43:03.360 --> 43:07.040]  about to know they're about to be dug out i mean they're going to pull some desperate crap
[43:07.040 --> 43:14.800]  they know that they are playing russian roulette literally and now's the time to be praying folks
[43:14.800 --> 43:21.120]  because look at the photo the recent photo of george soros looking like he's an undead
[43:21.680 --> 43:27.760]  reanimated uh corp sickle look on his hamburger meat left in the refrigerator for about three years
[43:28.560 --> 43:35.280]  he looks worse than emperor palpatine in revenge of the sith and all he wants to do is take the
[43:35.280 --> 43:40.000]  world with him and he's got to be stopped he's got to be stopped he's a clear and present danger
[43:40.000 --> 43:45.680]  he's got to be stopped that's all i'm saying they're hitting the panic bucket uh button saying shut

[44:02.960 --> 44:09.200]  days of his life you know playing with his cats or something he's not doing that he's got this big
[44:09.200 --> 44:13.920]  hard on for america and he thinks he's better than us and he thought he'd be the guy to mount

[44:35.920 --> 44:40.480]  and a system like the uk and the united states that have the birthright
[44:43.440 --> 44:45.920]  and you want to try to overthrow it you're going to lose
[44:49.040 --> 44:56.000]  toward soros you rounded up and killed jews england during the dark ages save the jews america save
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.600]  the jews you kill the jews you don't have a birthright you want to get down to brass tacks god

[45:22.160 --> 45:32.080]  they're bad they're not going to let us coexist with them has anybody figured that out yet now let's
[45:32.080 --> 45:39.680]  continue let's read what this monster's put out soros trump is a world would-be dictator who threatens
[45:39.680 --> 45:46.400]  the new world order that's his world government his stinking anti-human pro-death eugenics-based
[45:46.400 --> 45:56.080]  tree of turds billionaire globalist george soros has pinned a panicked rant in which he just
[45:57.120 --> 46:02.400]  decries president elect donald trump as a would-be dictator this is the guy that told magazines
[46:02.400 --> 46:06.480]  and newspapers in the 80s that he believes he was the new christ and a messianic leader but
[46:06.480 --> 46:09.520]  didn't want to tell people because he thought they'd lock him up in a mental institution these are
[46:09.520 --> 46:15.280]  quotes this guy thinks he's jesus christ no you're not jesus christ brother you're a demon
[46:18.480 --> 46:22.880]  in an article for project syndicate soros begins by mentioning how he lived under both
[46:22.880 --> 46:30.480]  nazi and soviet rule in hungary before asserting that various forms of closed societies from
[46:30.480 --> 46:38.480]  fascist dictatorships to mafia states are on the rise this is the guy in the wiki leaks
[46:38.480 --> 46:42.160]  that wants to overthrow the free press and have people he disagrees with
[46:42.800 --> 46:50.160]  put in jail oh he wants to stop a mafia state everything he says is a lie the claim is confounded
[46:50.160 --> 46:56.000]  by the facts which show that the share of the world population living in democracies has increased
[46:56.000 --> 47:01.920]  continuously soros writes that in voting for trump americans elected a con artist and would-be
[47:01.920 --> 47:08.080]  dictator as its president and that his defeat of hillary clinton means america will be quote unable
[47:08.080 --> 47:12.640]  to protect and promote democracy in the rest of the world because that policy works so well in
[47:12.640 --> 47:18.960]  iraq afghanistan syria and libya which he's been behind soros also slammed trump's new cabinet
[47:18.960 --> 47:25.280]  as containing nothing other than incompetent extremists and retired generals oh yeah top
[47:25.280 --> 47:31.840]  salesman top engineers top scientists top go-getters who who all came from nothing
[47:31.840 --> 47:38.240]  nothing notice the people in trump's cabinet made their wealth themselves rex tillison
[47:38.240 --> 47:46.320]  was an engineer in the texas oil fields the year i was born he went to work 1974 43 years ago
[47:48.320 --> 47:56.320]  he is the most successful all executive ever he defeated the carbon taxes behind the scenes
[47:56.320 --> 48:03.680]  people go well he's in the newspapers for it just watch what happens when he gets in
[48:03.680 --> 48:07.920]  i know the inside baseball and i know what happened in 2006 it was in the newspapers
[48:07.920 --> 48:13.440]  he took standard oil from the rockefeller family in a hostile takeover when they tried to unseat
[48:13.440 --> 48:18.320]  him because he was the main financier exposing the plan to cut off the carbon here in the us
[48:18.320 --> 48:22.240]  and in russia and he educated putin on the plan and that's why putin's fighting it
[48:22.240 --> 48:28.160]  putin listens to rex tillison putin listens to alex jones not the other way around and i don't
[48:28.160 --> 48:33.440]  say that to brag we do we want to build russia up we want russia to be great we want commerce
[48:33.440 --> 48:38.640]  we want to be great we want everybody to be great we want pro we want progress and prosperity and
[48:38.640 --> 48:46.080]  renaissance not a death culture like soros we're pro life we're pro family we're here to help
[48:46.080 --> 48:55.520]  help get it straight 1776 worldwide it ain't the russians doing this it's the rise of the republic
[48:56.640 --> 49:00.960]  you won't kill it you little slimebag it's only the point you put the knife to our throat
[49:00.960 --> 49:06.800]  that the spirit of the republic rose and use the more power you're given by your father soros
[49:06.800 --> 49:12.480]  the more power we're going to be given to defeat you you can see how we're all becoming animated
[49:12.480 --> 49:17.760]  stronger more prescient more focused it's because the enemy's rising right now and as the enemy

[49:41.520 --> 49:46.160]  as president you're a proven con artist and got it rounded up families to murder him you're a proven
[49:46.160 --> 49:51.920]  murdering scumbag and then his defeat of hillary clinton means america will be unable to protect

[50:31.440 --> 50:36.160]  and its disintegration has been accelerated first from brexit we're quoting him then from the
[50:36.160 --> 50:40.880]  election of trump in the us on december 4th from italian voters rejection by a wide margin of
[50:40.880 --> 50:47.520]  constitutional reforms and he goes on to panic don't you understand evil one the transmissions

[54:44.880 --> 54:49.360]  he's popping in at the start of the third hour then uh leon macadoo and others are going to come in
[54:49.360 --> 54:55.840]  and about all the big islamist asserts is taking place the reports out of spanish intelligence
[54:55.840 --> 55:00.480]  that the united states central america latin america south america are just being flooded
[55:01.360 --> 55:06.960]  by jihadist right now we already know that but but but now it's it's it's mainstream news there's
[55:06.960 --> 55:11.040]  a larger plan here with the globalists it doesn't mean that we're even winning this fight but we're
[55:11.040 --> 55:16.880]  conscious we're gaining ground every day uh he goes on to compare him to hitler it says he
[55:16.880 --> 55:22.560]  hasn't felt this unsafe since he was in hungary under hitler this is again a nazi collaborator
[55:22.560 --> 55:29.680]  who actually rounded up thousands of people and sent them to death camps but the adl gives him
[55:29.680 --> 55:35.520]  awards see how do you if you're going to cover all this up how do you do it you become the group
[55:35.520 --> 55:45.920]  that represents the people isn't that just cute it continues at first this is soros also
[55:45.920 --> 55:52.080]  bemoans russian president latimer putin's allege unique influence during the presidential election
[55:52.080 --> 55:58.160]  oh yeah again for me the big scandal is all these foreign powers got involved and trump's
[55:58.160 --> 56:02.960]  not coming out and going the communist chinese the saudi arabians admittedly gave hillary 20%
[56:02.960 --> 56:08.080]  of her campaign money alone just from saudi arabia china was more through thousands of
[56:08.080 --> 56:14.960]  illegal subsidiaries there in the us there's the total proof but no no no the russians are just all
[56:14.960 --> 56:22.160]  powerful at first he tried to control social media then in a brilliant move he exploited
[56:22.160 --> 56:26.560]  social media companies business models to spread misinformation fake news distorting
[56:27.840 --> 56:32.640]  electorates and he's stabilizing democracies this is how he helped trump get elected write soros
[56:32.640 --> 56:39.840]  about trump he's talking about himself soros is in thousands of the wiki leaks his group
[56:39.840 --> 56:46.160]  manipulating cnn abc cbs all of them and hillary going we gotta do what soros says
[56:47.440 --> 56:53.520]  oh but now you see it's the russians he's talking about himself here that's what's so crazy about
[56:53.520 --> 56:57.760]  this devil so you just whatever he says it's backwards they say satanists learn to read
[56:57.760 --> 57:03.920]  backwards do things backwards this is satanism inaction war death overthrowing targeting christians
[57:03.920 --> 57:10.960]  calling people nazis when you're a nazi inversing everything inverting everything soros says putin
[57:11.520 --> 57:16.160]  felt threatened by color revolutions yeah he was merely trying to overthrow russia so they're fighting
[57:16.160 --> 57:20.880]  you there not here in georgia ukraine elsewhere without mentioning that soros himself played a
[57:20.880 --> 57:25.200]  key role in bankrolling these contrived uprisings as well as color revolutions being fomented against
[57:25.200 --> 57:30.560]  trump the irony of an ultra rich elitist who has bankrolled the following and the overthrow of
[57:30.560 --> 57:35.280]  a numeral government insisting he cares about democracy and the will of the people is particularly
[57:35.280 --> 57:41.120]  rich yeah we need to get the raw video of him saying the best time of his life was rounding up jews
[57:41.120 --> 57:45.760]  and we're going to add that to this article he concludes by a warning that the eu was on the
[57:45.760 --> 57:51.040]  verge of breakdown due to stagnant economic growth and the out of control refugee crisis that soros

[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:52.640]  i'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older more expensive filters that
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:58.160]  didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then for war store

[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:24.800]  i are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the gcm radio network
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:30.800]  21 days until trump's in office and they're openly trying to start a war with russia
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.240]  they're openly trying to get a civil war going in israel
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:39.360]  they're calling in newspapers for trump to be killed but no one's getting in trouble
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.360]  one guy that lived close to the where the president's staying in florida
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.240]  got arrested when they showed up at his house he started basically screaming and yelling and saying
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.080]  it's it's his right to say kill trump so they had him right there he'll get convicted
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:59.200]  but meanwhile you've got professors all over the united states including right here at ut
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:09.120]  where they're announcing communism in america that white people are inherently bad and most of
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:15.280]  them are white this is what the big universities are paying to do this is what the big foundations
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:22.080]  are are paying to fund this is what the elite want to make us a bunch of dysfunctional mental
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.880]  patients and then when the problem gets big they bring in total federalization to counter all the
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:35.520]  racial division classic divide and conquer stories up on info wars dot com pro white genocide
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:41.200]  professor given no punishment despite seeing massacre of whites a good thing we said all i want
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:48.000]  for christmas is white genocide despite explicitly stating the massacre of white people during the
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.640]  bloody hasian revolution was a good thing and wishing for white genocide on christmas eve
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:59.920]  professor george mayer said directsley university supports him and roiders goes on to report from
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:08.480]  that in fact i have the roiders article right here in my stack isn't that just cute a directsley
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:13.680]  university professor whose tweet that he wanted white genocide for christmas sparked a firestorm
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:18.000]  of criticism from the school and social media said on tuesday that administrators supported
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:25.200]  his right to take part in political debate imagine if a professor said we should support
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:30.800]  black genocide i mean you would be fired so quick your head would spin i mean they've had liberal
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:36.320]  professors at yale and a bunch of other places when they're calling for banning costume parties
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:42.400]  or banning fiesta parties you know mexican food's good when i went to college for a couple years i
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:46.080]  got invited to rush parties if i never joined any of it because i thought it was stupid my bashing
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:49.680]  if you're in a fraternity just whatever i mean nothing against the sorority girls being there
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:54.800]  whatever that was fun drink beer whatever and i mean the most common party was fiesta because
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.400]  it's fun to drink margaritas and eat Mexican food and run around with some burrows on your head and
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:05.040]  jump in the pool i mean it's it's fun and that's why people do that it's the mexicans invented it
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:09.600]  all because it's fun you know okay nobody says the mexicans don't know how to have fun they do
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:17.280]  and this is just i mean that's not racist well they've banned that all over and uh this is just
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:22.640]  the insanity oh i guess what else you have toga parties so folks are kind of lightly dressed
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:27.840]  oh that's expropriating stuff from the greeks you're putting the greeks down when you do that
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:32.720]  oh so let's not be greeks and don't be a cowboy either all over the country they say that's cultural
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:39.920]  appropriation you should say i didn't i'm not paying 30 000 a year to be an occult that tells me
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:46.320]  that i can't be be a native american or a cowboy or that i can't be a geisha girl i know people
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.480]  well it's it's come out in the news and in one case eastside yoga i was talking to uh one of my
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:56.080]  friends uh whose girlfriends yoga instructor i heard about this then was ended up being the paper
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:04.160]  a couple years ago they said oh um we're going to have for halloween a uh yoga party with wine
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:09.440]  and stuff like that and we're going to come dressed you know like uh india style well it's indian
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:14.800]  culture it's an indian exercise it's and so it's kind of like you're going to a dude ranch
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.480]  come dress with your cowboy boots your cowboy hat and your and your and your you know go to
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:23.200]  shepherds or whatever western store you go to and get dressed up like that you're not bashing
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:27.840]  cowboys you're not bashing anybody it's just what you do and they had a bunch of folks flip out so
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:32.960]  you can't do it so they canceled it it's all about control ladies and gentlemen
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:41.040]  oh you don't dress up in indian garb and don't have girls belly dancing whatever you do just shut
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:50.800]  it down because the cult rules things address the university professor whose tweet that he wanted
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.280]  white genocide for christmas sparked a firestorm of criticism from the school and social media
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:59.360]  said on tuesday the administrator supported his right to take part in political debate
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:04.480]  george mayor a white associate professor of history at the politics at philadelphia university
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:10.000]  has said his christmas eve posting that all i want for christmas's white genocide on twitter
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:17.440]  was aimed at poking fun at white supremacists oh oh so it's okay even though they do call for an
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.920]  end of white people all over the major universities and have it in official textbooks when i took two
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:26.480]  years of community college seeing if i even wanted to go to college i was already successful on radio
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.880]  by that time i got out of it and it didn't matter whether it was psychology class whatever they would
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.800]  come in and hold a picture of a brown person who'd look like any particular group and say
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.520]  it's going to be wonderful that soon whites will be gone whites are inherently bad at acc i would
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:45.280]  sit there that's why i got out of college and if i wrote papers in psychology or texas history or
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:50.160]  whatever i had to take countering that i would get f's so i would write these things with errors
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:54.800]  all over them as a joke agreeing with all of it and they would give me a pluses and invite me for
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:02.240]  coffee i'm not kidding and they didn't care i'd done 180 about faces from paper to paper
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:10.320]  they like the fact that i'd submit it i mean i would write stuff that that a that a that you
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:16.880]  couldn't hardly read on purpose and they would give me a pluses this is a cult of sickening scum
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:25.280]  they want to teach two plus two equals five folks they want basket cases that only know how to be
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:31.040]  hurt and and feel weird and and and scared so they go into the wings of these parasites oh come here
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.920]  i'll protect you since everyone's out to get you so you can't even get a job you've got so many chips
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:41.200]  on your shoulder you're so neurotic and you're led by little little twits with their little ironic
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:47.360]  colonel sanders beard and mustaches to teach you how bad whites are and then when you get caught
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:53.440]  doing it you slime out and go oh i was just countering white supremacists oh kill all the white people
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:05.920]  now it's okay here's an excerpt on latin american social movements with almost 10 000 twitter followers
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.040]  and then it goes through all the crazy statements they've made but his attempt at satire triggering
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.840]  a backlash from conservative websites with some online comments calling for him to be fired or
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:21.280]  commit suicide drexel on sunday called his tweet utterly reprehensible and said it would meet with
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:30.160]  him to discuss it this is fake news he explicitly clarified his comment to say the massacre of whites
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:36.240]  during the Haitian revolution was a good thing indeed what does that mean so now they're saying
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:41.680]  it's fake news if you say he said kill everybody he said nothing about it haydie but see he controls
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:48.880]  reality so now he's saying it's fake news oh i said kill all the whites i only meant in haydie and by
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:57.040]  the way it's fake news if you talk about me this is where they play this game like you're stupid
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:00.720]  and talk to you like an idiot and we've put up with so much in this country and so much in europe
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:04.880]  and so much other parts of the world that i expect them to act like this they still think you're
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:10.080]  totally in a coma and some people are where george soros comes out says trump is going to be a dictator
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:14.720]  like hitler and i'm more scared than when i was in hungry under hitler and he's a horrible person
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:20.000]  he's starting all these wars and he's really really racist and everything soros says is what he's done
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:28.960]  it's everything he's the king of and you won't see any msm point out the hypocrisy because their job
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:34.240]  is to invert reality and teach you that prosperity is an evil thing
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:43.040]  now i'm going to go to break and come back and break all this down with greg and john and matt and
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:47.360]  ward and a bunch of other folks that are patiently holding the toll free number to join us it's 800
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:52.880]  25 at 99231 when you hear somebody hang up that's your chance to call in and i intend to go to your
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:58.400]  calls bam bam bam on the other side of this break i want to just recap that soros has conjured
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:04.560]  hitler an attack on ascendant populist all over the world every country that's getting a vote from
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:11.520]  spain to italy to the uk is voting to begin the pullout of the unelected e you and this little
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:15.600]  monster is panicking calling it undemocratic to pull out of something that's undemocratic
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:24.240]  total inversion of reality our story is up on drugsreport.com breaking it all down right now so
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:28.560]  please get that story out to everyone and i'm going to shoot a video and i'm going to add into
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:35.520]  there into the article pointing out the biblical level incredible hypocrisy of all of this
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:43.680]  but the easiest place to find our article is soros trump is a would be dictator who threatens
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:50.000]  new world order their new world order which they say doesn't exist very important article by paul
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.560]  joseph watson let's get that out on facebook twitter you name it what a hypocrite breaks the
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:18:01.200]  record for being hypocrite briefly we are listed supported the globalist as you know target sponsors
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:06.080]  they shut you down they go after you i don't even list a full list of our m&m affiliates anymore
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:11.200]  i've decided that over a year ago and it's worked we gained over 100 because the enemy is so stupid
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:14.960]  they can't even find our full full affiliate list and then try to boycott them and attack them
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:20.160]  just these little moves like that but the point is you know we've gone from like 170 to 250 plus
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:26.880]  and growing but the point is support those local stations become a sponsor let the sponsors know

[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.800]  here for just a moment because every time i'm about to go on air at 11 a.m central and every
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:18.080]  time i get off here when i'm walking to the bathroom or going to you know look at some video
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:25.280]  clips in one of the studios or stepping outside to make a phone call i just think about the fact
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:29.920]  that the globalists are panicking they're trying to start wars they're openly passing laws to begin
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:34.720]  censorship of media in the u.s they're claiming that american patriots that want sovereignty or
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:41.280]  russian agents when they're the ones bringing in foreign powers to suppress our speech it's just
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:50.320]  incredible to me how truly criminal and despicable and villainous and comic book
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:58.640]  i mean this is like a james bond movie they're really doing it they're really going to pull
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:03.280]  something big because they've gone from looking but hurt now to looking really angry focused
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:06.720]  and evil and they're nodding their heads and they're saying something big's coming
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:11.280]  trump's gonna get he's gonna pay oh it's his fault a big war is about to start
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:15.280]  we were saying months ago they're gonna start a war if trump gets elected and now they're doing it
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:19.680]  and now they're on tv saying the big war is about to happen it's his fault when anyone with the
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:26.560]  geopolitical understanding of a five-year-old understands their starting stuff with this
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:35.520]  whole destabilization of israel and russia it's just crazy it's crazy and i'm not on trump's back
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:39.680]  he knows what he's doing but man he's got to get more aggressive with these people he's like
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:45.200]  hey prosperity's up hey you know every day announces new factories coming back i understand
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:49.680]  that's great they're trying to start a war before you even get in you got to call these people out
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:56.320]  and i know trump knows the public's not that sophisticated but it doesn't matter he has to
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:03.840]  lead them to it we the message is complex you make the public complex by putting out complex
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:08.640]  messages that's my view you can't dumb it down when it comes to this
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:15.600]  trump has to come out and say they're trying to start a war ahead of him getting into office
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.960]  and it's the only way they're gonna back off you're gonna be held responsible
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:23.440]  for trying to start an intifada a revolution encouraging the palestinians to riot and all
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.040]  the stuff you're doing with russia you're full of crap stop saying i'm a russian agent
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:31.040]  you're the ones that brought in the chinese you're the ones that brought in the saudi arabians
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:35.440]  to find the election and i'm gonna investigate that when i get in you're scared i'm gonna bring

[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.880]  look nice look presidential try to heal the country that's if they weren't enemies that's if
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:57.120]  they weren't trying to overthrow the country that'd be the right thing if they weren't trying to
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.240]  unseat you president-elect you've got to go on the attack because we're under attack
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.480]  he's just talking about soros being investigated for criminal activity when he gets in he's to
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:15.760]  say soros i'm coming for you i mean trump has to come out with the press conference to say how
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:20.960]  dare this nazi collaborator compare me to hitler and then read his quotes about the happiest time
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:30.080]  of my life was rounding up jews and hungry what he's crazy destroy him press the attack
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:39.120]  why do you think the info wars had such a big effect the media is so arrogant oh alex is just

[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:14.960]  uh i just wanted to raise the point uh it seems pretty obvious that uh he had this go on in his
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:20.160]  childhood where he enjoyed spelling people out that's why he has uh obama's selling black people out
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.960]  he's liberal professor selling white people out yes he's into betrayal he's very evil that that's
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:30.480]  what true evil is about betrayal yeah he tries to find other people that are into that too and i
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:36.960]  think it's just this whole i don't know exactly if you read the wiki leaks it is the most it's like
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:41.520]  villains if you wrote a comic but with villains talking like this you'd say they sound too evil
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:46.480]  nobody talks like this but they all compete with each other about who could be the lowest filthy

[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:18.000]  vacations like hawaiian vacations for example with a price tag of an annual trip of 3.5 million or
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.360]  more in total the cost of the first family's personal travel during the last years comes to a
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:28.880]  whopping 85 million uh 90 million after additional records were released according to one conservative
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:33.360]  group judicial watch and this is of course based on the federal government's records the cost of

[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:38.880]  the silence
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:47.600]  oh my little girl i saw a couple articles yesterday about china has a big initiative
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:52.320]  i don't have it in front of me it sounds so unbelievable perhaps you guys can pull it up
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:56.480]  china has a new nationwide initiative for tourism to upgrade their toilets
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:03.440]  because you know over 70 percent of the toilets it's estimated the ap wrote uh in china are holes
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:10.880]  in the ground and you go in and squat over a hole uh in a just room with other people
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:16.160]  and that's how you use the bathroom that uh i wanted to juxtapose that what china says that
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:19.680]  they got this new aircraft carrier was going to blow us up and they also are going to lay on the
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:24.800]  dark side of the moon so they're going to innovate the whole world but they can't in 60 plus years
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:31.600]  of communist rule almost 70 years i guess or more since 1949 they can't even deliver toilets to the
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:38.480]  public there it is roiders china plans toilet revolution to boost tourism that's right because
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:44.640]  you're supposed to just crap on the side of the road you've been to india you've been to china
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:50.080]  i haven't but paul watson has and my family has enough i mean it is unbelievable
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:56.640]  i had one crew member go to india last year i'm not going to tell the story because they
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:02.240]  they're not here today and i have an answer permission they went there on tourism and fell
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:09.200]  on a street walking past their head into a giant slurry of human feces on a major street
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:18.560]  now why am i going there bash america all day all these little snot nose communists everybody else
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:24.880]  with their smartphones there it is india's government is now shaming people into using toilets
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:32.400]  but we're told we just need to adopt this here
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:41.440]  we don't need to innovate at all so again americans hold the lowest number of passports
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:46.560]  per capita than any other industrialized country and so you got all these bubbled kids
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:51.200]  who just literally hear their professor telling them america is horrible and evil the rest of
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:55.040]  the world is glistening and perfect the health care in england is totally free and the best thing
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:00.400]  you ever had cuba is incredible they have rocket ships they've colonized mars there i mean they
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:05.760]  don't go that far but it's basically castro floats around and and jesus says he loves him i mean it
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:13.440]  is just ridiculous castro flies a flying carpet castro has jewels that drip from his fingertips
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:19.680]  oh yeah alex everything's free in cuba yeah you're free to work 18 hours a day
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:25.680]  eat squid three times a day like tona montana says you like a chivano and every corny
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:33.520]  sheep want to tell you what to eat what to wear where to go what to do you a communist
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:40.560]  i kill the communists for free for fun i'm gonna go to your phone calls now on soros
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:49.120]  the famous nazi collaborator warning the world that trump is a hitler dictator you cannot make it
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:55.280]  up obama is set in the next few hours to come out and announce that they're basically declaring
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:00.640]  war on russia with cyber attacks economic warfare you name it already russian jets are getting blown
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:12.560]  up you name it and a funeral for two isn't this weird kerry fisher god rest her soul dies
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:16.480]  after having a heart attack flying from one into lax
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:22.640]  and then her mother another famous actress debbie reynolds
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:38.160]  dies i was suspected stroke was it a stroke or was it star killing and by the way i pretty much
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:45.120]  trolled the media a few days ago when i asked is this star killing because when somebody's
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:48.880]  outlived their usefulness basically mafias do run hollywood and i've talked a lot of
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:53.760]  hollywood folks there is the belief that when you're no longer useful they're about to put up
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:38:00.240]  your original catalog and rock and roll or movies or you name it folks tend to get killed to make them
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:07.360]  valuable again right when some new productions being rolled out plus they can also show you
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:13.840]  the original kerry fisher from the 1977 new hope she's back in the new movie via computer and you
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:18.080]  can't tell the difference so you really don't need kerry fisher anymore because you've got a digital
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:23.440]  version of her and then magically she dies right on time and then her mommy who controlled her estate
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:30.080]  dies a few days later coincidence what of her whole what of what of other members of the family
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:36.080]  that have claims on her start all dying would you then ask a question now i said i don't think
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:41.280]  they killed kerry fisher but see we need to think about star killing and understand this goes on
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:47.680]  the ultimate mafia is hollywood they actually found it there's kerry fisher not from the original
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:58.880]  1977 but the 2016 release rogue one which by the way is a very avant-garde movie it's it's it's
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:03.040]  the best produced star wars movie ever and i got to say disney despite the fact i don't like disney
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:07.440]  in many respects did a really great job at the film and the final scene is as good as it gets
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:13.520]  and then it's just governor tarks back and everybody's back because of cg and it's incredible
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:18.640]  some of the battle seems a little exhausting but they're still well done i mean it's got some
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:23.920]  communist chinese politburo worship in it what doesn't but you know i'd give it four and a half
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:29.840]  stars out of five stars because i guess the bar was so low the last one was so bad only episode
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:37.760]  one was so horrible i mean it's just terrible stuff so still impressive now the media will take
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:42.480]  that out of context and say that i said kerry fisher was murdered and so was her mother i didn't
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:47.840]  say that they already got news articles saying i said that from when i said it two days ago that's
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:53.200]  fine people then see that they come here with this madman saying and they find out what i'm really
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:40:00.320]  saying is not what they said but you see these stars running out of hollywood running to europe
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:06.960]  running to canada and it's because managers do take people's money people do die look all the
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:10.560]  stuff came out with pelacano it was always said that he was running around doing stuff behind
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:17.600]  the scenes and it started coming out and gory was but that's nothing i've been at for whatever reason
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:22.560]  because they wanted to put out some films they wanted to put out loose change in theaters and
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:26.960]  mark cuban wanted to i have been in the rooms with the biggest lawyers in hollywood and the
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:32.640]  biggest producers and it is like something out of the godfather it's old men smoking cigarettes
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:39.120]  bitching who are worth in some cases billions of dollars going uh i tell you what i'll kill
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:45.440]  that son of a bitch you give me a problem you're like hey have a safe trip back home are you threatening
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:51.840]  me oh are you you're trying to you're gonna kill me because they couldn't believe i was in these
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:55.840]  meetings arguing with them and acting like i was an equal i'm like i we in texas we say
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:03.600]  have a safe trip home uh huh like getting like some million dollar maybach just crazy
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:11.120]  and that's because it's gangster run folks you better believe it and you always hear hollywood's
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:19.360]  jewish it is i'd say half jewish another 20 30 percent italian um and then coming in with
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:24.560]  the money are the arabes and the chinese when i was there witnessing at the time and now it's
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:29.760]  all over the news but i said i go to your phone calls in the sorrel situation but
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:36.880]  i mean with the italians it's like wow these are real gangsters these are the gangster families
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:43.280]  that went legitimate 50 years ago it's amazing people have no idea the crazy levels of these
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:50.240]  people some of these folks are making a hundred million a week on their tv shows there are producers
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:56.000]  that own five six seven shows that are on they're getting five ten fifteen million dollars per show
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:03.200]  themselves per week hundreds of millions a week and it's crazy they don't trust their families
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:08.400]  look look at some of the redstone i've been in meetings when redstone is on the speakerphone
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.760]  yelling at people and they hang on he's very mercurial that's because oh i mean it is crazy
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:19.040]  for whatever reason god let me into these meetings and i've seen the craziest stuff you can imagine
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:25.680]  old toad like men smoking cigarettes like i mean it's something else
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:35.840]  okay let me just say the people that run hollywood took it from other people or fought to keep what
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:41.920]  they got it's gangster land but you never hear that because see oh the gangsters only existed
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:49.840]  in the 1940s and 50s in new york and new jersey and they were all italian oh yeah right
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:55.120]  and they also all seem to think texas is like its own gangsterville which it kind of is but see
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:00.240]  the real gangsters nobody knows their gangsters see how that works but see the general public
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:04.560]  doesn't know how the world works they believe hollywood that gives them a fantasy land
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:11.920]  all right let's go to your calls on soros and all the rest of it uh let's go ahead and talk to
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:15.280]  who's up next here is it ward is it mad is it kevin is it john is it ferris
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:19.760]  let's go ahead and talk to ward in kansas thanks for holding her on the air
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:29.280]  very interesting word go ahead thank you go ahead uh i'm torn i don't know where
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:37.040]  soros should be deported to would russia israel or gitmo be better for him a lot of hollywood
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:41.360]  folks said they want to go to mars i think we put them in a spaceship space capsule send the
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:46.960]  vampire to mars there's no blood for him to drink metaphorically or how about we give him a uh deport
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:54.480]  him to hell that would be generous what do you think of soros running around panicking i think
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:44:00.400]  it's wonderful but i'm concerned about what he might do i i can understand how this man
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:11.200]  can be left out in public why why he's not behind bars and his assets either seized or frozen
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:16.640]  so he can't buy his way out well we have to keep identifying him look the crimes that have been
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:20.000]  committed by the globalists are so big they've got so many people in on the crime with them
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.080]  they believe the criminality is so huge that's too big to fail that's how they work these
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:28.320]  corruptions but now the corruption got so big it was bringing down our whole society now they
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:32.960]  must be dealt with they went too far god bless you ward that's a good question where do we deport
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:40.320]  soros to he's originally from eastern europe i think we deport him to russia they've got an
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:45.600]  arrest warrant for him in russia right now all right matt in pencil van here on the air welcome
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:51.680]  thanks for calling hey alex i just want to thank you first uh you inspire me to start a
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:56.880]  site a while ago and i made it like easy to read to try to reach people that um you know sometimes
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:01.360]  sometimes trouble reading real complex things and big articles and stuff like that but sorry i was
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:08.080]  digressing a little bit but what my point is well tell us what your blog is it's uh it's the daily
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:14.880]  informer dot net that's a great name great job and look it's all about you you're not digressing
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:20.160]  putting up blogs doing videos all of us responding all of us speaking out we're unstoppable
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:23.920]  despite all their attempts at censorship now is the time for everybody whether it's low tech
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:28.160]  newsletters or handing out business cards that have websites on them or or whether it's showing
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:32.720]  a film at your local theater your church every little bit counts together it moves mountains go
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:40.080]  ahead well it's it's it's it's mind-blowing how the majority of people aren't making a big enough
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:47.520]  deal out of the i'd say but the islam takeover of america though the sweet silent behind the scenes
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:50.640]  you know all let's put out these amazon commercials make everything look all nice
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:54.960]  that you know comforting conditioning everyone to just accept it and then it seems like a couple
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:58.480]  years down the road that's going to like snap their fingers and they're all going to arise and
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:03.280]  they'll all be uh specifically put in different areas like obama's put them in different towns
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:07.440]  and cities and all over the united states like it's like they're almost matt doing some secret
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:12.240]  war ops mapping out and putting them in different areas they can just snap their fingers arise and
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:17.280]  that's where the the madness will begin by the way that's why 80 percent of military age men they admit
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:23.440]  that's the plan in the wiki leaks to bring in incompatible groups then when they engage in
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:28.880]  terrorism take all of our rights claiming that our free society is what caused it merkel's already
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:35.280]  announcing banning free speech banning nationalist groups being able to demonstrate uh on new year's
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:40.160]  eve but the muslims can go out and rape and rob and kill that's in the news today great points matt
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:46.080]  let's talk to kevin in maryland kevin you're on the year go ahead hey hey alec how are you doing
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:53.120]  good go ahead hey um you remember a few years ago you reported of nuclear devices missing out of a
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:59.840]  base in south carolina no it was uh it was west texas west texas uh are they still missing
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:08.240]  we were called by people on the base and told nuclear weapons are being transferred out of
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:13.920]  here they weren't even supposed to be here and they're being sent to the east coast and then
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:19.440]  after we reported that lindsay graham came out and said there are nukes that have been brought in
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:25.920]  by islamists and are going to blow up our base exactly where we said the nukes have been sent on
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:32.000]  the east coast and all hell broke loose and remember also six cruise missiles came up missing
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:39.280]  from minot uh base up north and showed up down in louisiana and then six people at the base got
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:43.440]  almost seriously died in the next two days so there's been cases of missing nukes before
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:52.320]  a false flag in the next 20 days you think that's why they'd want missing nukes no i think they're
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:57.440]  going to use the missing nukes to possibly nuke uh new york and cause the false flag before trump
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:03.520]  gets put into office yep you know in fact seeing in last night during situation room they were saying
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.120]  there's going to be a war there's going to be huge terror attacks it's now trump's fault that he got
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:12.720]  elected and it's israel's fault and then they all just said it is his it is his fault and they all
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:17.760]  just said it is basically willed like a cult and they all just kind of looked down and and and
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:22.560]  solemnly so they're planning something big that's all i know they've committed they decided they're
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.560]  better than everybody and that they're unstoppable and who knows what they're gonna do i think that's
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:33.280]  what they're going to pull they look scared they look committed yesterday uh again i've been
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:37.520]  monitoring them there their body language has changed into you know kind of panicking that
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:42.720]  they weren't going to get to have their way with us very slowly as perverts political perverts uh
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:48.080]  you know culturally slowly you know sucking out our essence uh so now they want to have a i i
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:54.160]  guess some big new crisis what do you think well i i think you're absolutely right my uncle works for
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:59.120]  the department of defense and he keeps telling me to be quiet and to shut up that i'm getting too
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:05.520]  close um i don't know if he's just throwing it the screw with me or if he's actually serious but um i
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:12.000]  think that's your false flag in the next 20 days well those people in the department of defense
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.920]  are compartmentalized as well so if you got an uncle making fun of me it's because he doesn't
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:20.720]  like the fact you're younger trying to inform me but there have been missing nooks before
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:26.880]  our sources were real and all hell broke loose the next few days about nooks and some of
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:31.040]  they said nooks are about to go off on the east coast i believe we may have stopped a false flag
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:37.280]  so i don't know i mean you know the point is is that people know we will put out information
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:43.120]  from good sources to warn the public so we get information nobody else gets because other people
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:47.840]  are too scared to do it i appreciate your call kevin john in colorado thanks for holding your on
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:56.400]  the air hey how you doing Alex good go ahead hey a couple days ago google removed the holocaust
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:01.200]  holocaust denial site did you hear about that from their top searches i did not but i know
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:05.200]  that they've been delisting us on their chrome then it came back i know that there this is
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:09.520]  this fake news purge and again if people agree with the holocaust the way it was said or not
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:14.720]  it should be free speech things like that shouldn't be removed i mean i mean if something
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:20.160]  is the top search is getting the most traffic then it shouldn't be getting removed i mean that
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:24.080]  you know the google has been better than others about actually putting what gets the most views
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:29.360]  at the top that's why you put in info and info wars comes up you put out alex jones i come up first
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:34.080]  and so this is a way they're trying to control things i guess it all goes back to what drudge
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:40.400]  said last october when it came down to austin he said that it was coming this year and he was very
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:45.120]  right well stay there i'm gonna come back to you i don't want to cut you off this is a hard break

[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:48.960]  like a wild man but people know this is you gotta be crazy to be willing to do what i've done but
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:53.840]  i'm not crazy i understood history and i've got an instinct to stand up against scum that wants to
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:59.040]  hurt innocent people and i'm looking for men out there and women that have the same instinct
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:05.760]  and who want to take action in the information war so they've tried to frame us as violent all
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:10.480]  these years when they're the ones that are violent and now that's failed and they're arrogance and
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:16.480]  trying to get cops killed intimidate cops around the country to go under un control with the strong
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:22.000]  cities initiative was one of the final nails in the coffins of this system and made the police
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  go research everything we said and basically fully convert to reality and then some because they're
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:33.680]  in to a lot of knowledge databases we don't have access to and so between the police the military
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:39.680]  people intelligence agencies corporate chiefs all the real thinking people have been doing their
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:44.640]  homework the last few years and we know more about the globalist operation than most high-level
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:50.080]  globalists who just are sellouts do what they're told carry out their little compartmentalized area
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:57.200]  and then go play golf not us we're not playing golf trump hadn't played golf in a year and a half
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:04.560]  until this christmas vacation and it's well-deserved we're not screwing around this is like a video
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:09.200]  game for the real world i people stay up for days playing a video game i stay up for days
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:14.240]  doing this because we're affecting change we're having victory i'm hired in a kite with no drugs
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:18.880]  this is exciting now i'm gonna go back to your calls here in a moment john and colorado and
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:23.360]  finish up he's making some good points uh about out there and i was googling it during the break
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:26.800]  you guys get me some stuff about google blocking sites because i knew they were already doing that
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:30.480]  and talking about it i knew germany was already doing it but wow to actually see them do it
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:37.600]  again even if you disagree with sites like that they're going to take your right next folks
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:43.360]  first germany banned nazis now they're banning nationalist groups and people criticizing islam
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:49.840]  you've got to support free speech or it all goes that's why there's there's towns now that are
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:55.440]  announcing they're not going to let nazis have parades you got to let them have it or you mean
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:57:00.080]  you got to let the new black panther party have it as well that's just a black hate group you got to
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:05.360]  let them do it or everybody loses it it's real simple now there it is i guess we it's unfortunate
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:12.320]  magazine google demotes holocaust denial and hate sites in update to algorithm wow i missed that
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:17.920]  that was nine days ago you know all the time people go why aren't you covering this i mean he
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:21.440]  nicely did it and i'm like because there's just so much thank you for letting me know i i knew all
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:26.000]  sorts of censorship was kicking in it's happening to us so i'll do a big report on this in fact
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:30.800]  you probably have on whoever this person is i disagree with him i mean hitler did target
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:35.120]  jews he did kill him you can argue about how many were killed or whatever something like a hundred
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:39.920]  million people got killed in world war two i mean i just all i know is it's real bad i mean hitler
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:44.960]  did have the final solution saying kill the jews i mean that that that went on so i just point it
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:51.440]  should to you then ban people that say or or or look the russians said six million died at one
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:56.960]  facility that was clearly not true then it turned into six million total whatever the point is is
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:03.120]  that hitler killed a bunch of people now um briefly we have free shipping going until the new year

[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:49.360]  discussion right into the next hour uh where every fourth hour we have a guest house whether it's
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:54.960]  our great anchors or reporters are people like john rapaport who is just one of the most concise
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:01:02.080]  focused truly compassionate liberal brains out there when i mean liberal i mean real liberal like
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:08.560]  pro gun but also pro gardening and just really piercing intellect i mean i just love the guy
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:12.720]  he's coming up the fourth hour no more fake news dot com he's had that size more than a decade
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:15.920]  of course he exposes the mainstream media they're the fake news the new york times is
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:20.880]  bonboning that we have taken their term from them we've called you fake news over and over again
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:25.840]  now i'm mad i didn't officially ever settle on that name who's always debated at nauseam
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:32.880]  what your true title is collaborators scum media filth media the anti-media the anti-trump the
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:43.360]  anti-america the prostitutes the decepticons the sewer the arrogant narcissistic con game media the
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:50.080]  i mean you're just the fake media you're the enemy uh let's go to john colorado finish up your
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:53.760]  point yeah i didn't know that i i guess it's mainstream news we'll put it back on screen
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:59.760]  ap roiders you name it are all reporting that they are now basically delisting or moving it
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:06.000]  from the top where it should be to hiding it uh so google is now actually uh i mean they did this
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.920]  for hillary remember they would delist of about her criminality there and it would be some about
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:16.080]  you know 1996 criminal bills and stuff that she signed or clinton signed uh so wow google demotes
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:20.160]  holocaust denial and hate sites and update to algorithms so let's get in line with germany
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:26.400]  and recent musk google has confronted a new and unsettling trend oh it's top search results because
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:31.600]  it's based on a real algorithm for questions about the holocaust led to neo nazi sites while
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:37.040]  queries about different ethnic groups direct uses to racist or inflammatory material that's
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:42.000]  because that's what people are searching put out counter arguments that are compelling dumbo
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:49.760]  all you'll do is make google obsolete let's go back to john go ahead john that's exactly what
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:55.600]  they're doing alex uh drudge called it best he said we're all corralled into these internet ghettos
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:00.720]  not exactly what it is google facebook it doesn't matter it's all a form of control
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:05.920]  that you were talking on yesterday this ai controlled it's coming it's already here we're
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:13.280]  it's so ubiquitous we're already in it and when google does stuff like that delist demotes and
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:20.960]  d whatever's and no one bats an eyelash it's because no one even notices we're already so in it
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:27.440]  or like you said it's it's it's racist everyone's so afraid to be offensive towards anybody or
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:35.040]  or thinking that anything and once they train us that it's okay to ban words then it's okay to ban
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:39.280]  entire books or ideas and by the way i've had this idea for years i'm launching it now because the
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:44.160]  attack on free speech we formed a free speech coalition we've mailed off the 100 000 uh deals
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:50.480]  by 18 wheeler the trump tower that's all happening but i'm gonna start a hundred thousand dollar a year
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:56.640]  award as long as we can pay for it every year to a champion of free speech but the first year's winner
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:04:03.520]  for 2016 will just be honorary because drudge wouldn't take it a hundred thousand dollars the
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:10.000]  first winners drudge for defending free speech and for being an incredible journalist he told us last
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:15.360]  year from his supreme court sources and others about the total attack plan for 2016 the shutdown
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:21.520]  freedom of speech he was proven correct and so he is the first recipient of the defense of free speech
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:29.200]  awards 2016 and next year it'll be a hundred thousand dollars and will be given to a journalist
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:32.960]  or group or organization that's fighting for free speech we've got a hundred and fifteen
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:38.320]  thousand dollar award before by the way folks so i mean we we uh we pay out on these but i need to
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:42.000]  go get a trophy when i'm gonna i'm gonna give it to him for the year ends we're gonna present drudge
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.720]  that here on air and kind of put clips together where he predicted it show how it happened uh
[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:51.360]  it's just amazing where's the media going oh look drudge was dead on in one interview he's done in
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:56.560]  multiple years big exclusive interview they just ignore it because they know it's true and he knew
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:05:03.680]  before we did and came to warn everybody that's epic a heartbreaking update this morning debbie

[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:30.880]  the russians were running it when merkel loses elections in parliament in her party they they
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:36.720]  blame it on racism and the russians but they're not blaming italy on the russians italy voted to

[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:46.720]  the euros announcing that it says you're going to send an army that it's forming into countries
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:52.880]  that try to leave this is insane how brazen this is george soros pins a piece that's linked on
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:59.440]  drudge report dot com on the right hand side right now comparing donald trump to adolf hitler now
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:06.240]  this is rich because george soros at almost 90 years old is the most well-known living

[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:38.320]  cost they're trying to start a war on intifada a civil war in israel and i watched the situation
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:43.360]  most for 30 minutes and they're very cryptic they go it will be trump's fault now that the
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:48.000]  giant war that's coming with russia and in the middle east it is his fault they just kept saying
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:53.440]  a huge war a huge crisis and they all said it's too bad and looked down and i was like oh my god
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:58.080]  because you know about the emails behind the scenes they all communicate it's very centralized
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:02.240]  they're about to start a big war in the next 20 days if they can and blame it on trump and and
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:06.320]  obama's about to announce all these sanctions and cyber attacks on russia russian aircraft
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:11.120]  are getting shot down ambassadors are getting killed nato top and people are getting killed
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:16.320]  there's a hot war going on now now i know that roger stohn has big international contacts not
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:22.560]  to the russians but uh let's just say uh in the middle east and in other areas in europe and he's
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:26.320]  always got his ear to the ground now he's been out of commission for 10 days sick as he's ever been
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:30.880]  didn't sleep hardly you know the last year i'm literally i told her by that he got really sick
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:35.360]  and he's been staying up for months trying to finish this book so this is an exclusive interview
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:41.280]  you hadn't been doing any in the last 10 days here he is but front and center now he's been better
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:45.200]  in the last few days kind of getting caught up he can give us the latest on trump that he's allowed
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:50.960]  to get into and this crisis but i hope trump knows that they're coming after him in america
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:57.840]  they are now basically like kamikaze who know from italy to the uk to the united states everybody's
[02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:03.840]  pulling out of globalism soros says there's an ascendant populism and they're in full panic mode
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:10.240]  so this is the gutter dameron folks this is the ragnarok this is the final battle in their view
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:16.560]  this is very hitler in the bunker so they're totally inversing reality he's accusing trump of
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:21.920]  overthrowing democracies when that's his specialty uh good to see you uh my friend on skype i gotta
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:26.080]  say you weren't fat but you lost some weight when you were sick so uh i guess you came out of this
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:29.840]  on the on the good end i've always made the joke that when i get the flu occasionally i lose 10
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:36.000]  pounds uh but wow where should we start well i put it this way i lost weight the hard way um
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:42.880]  you know alex i think the president elect was hoping to have more of a working vacation uh at his
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:50.720]  uh estate uh marlago in palm beach um but my understanding is he has been glued to the telephone
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:59.040]  working the un situation and beating back the treachery of the obama administration there
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:05.600]  in touch with other world leaders um i must say it felt really great to have a president of the
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:12.480]  united states who was actually willing to tweet merry christmas rather than happy holidays uh
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:18.480]  but and i i wish that um the president elect could get the kind of rest and recreation were more
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:25.600]  golf uh but he's very plugged in to the world situation uh which i think you can see in this
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:30.560]  statement this morning which he essentially says hold on is real help is coming
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:37.680]  what do you make geopolitically the democrats pretty much admit they're trying to cause a war
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:42.000]  to embarrass trump they should be brought up in charges if they actually caused this war
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:46.480]  and try to bring down the economy they admit they want to raise interest rates to stall the
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:52.240]  trump euphoria they're in full panic mode the world is so hungry for prosperity trump's turning
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:58.400]  on even better than we thought and he's still 21 days out uh and they made an enormous investment
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:05.120]  in uh an attempt to hijack the electoral college they made a an enormous investment
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:12.720]  3.5 million dollars to the state of wisconsin for the phony recount that yielded nothing
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:21.200]  after harping on the popular vote so uh at each stop their plan to upset the apple cart and
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:29.200]  remove down front has failed this is why i think you're seeing this kind of hysteria uh generated
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:39.280]  once again by mr soros i brought up some points here and i want to get back into questions i've
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:44.560]  got roger but obviously i know you got better the last few days so you were reassessing what was
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:50.960]  happening currently um what else should we be looking for what else should be we we uh on the
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:55.040]  outlook for obviously because there's good things happening there's bad things happening we see
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:00.000]  the ruling class to hijack the country in the world panicking because they see a return of
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.400]  prosperity something that that they've been admitting they have to tap down the west is so
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:10.560]  powerful so wealthy uh that that americanism must be destroyed so collectivism can be supreme
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:15.360]  what else is on your radar well let's remember that uh president elect trump is still trying to
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:24.000]  form a government he still has to name a secretary of uh of agriculture he still has to name somebody
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:30.080]  to straighten out the mess at the veterans administration i do know that he is very very
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:38.160]  focused on the va he's very focused on looking at innovative programs to finance an infrastructure
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:44.400]  rebuilding across the country these combined with his economic plan i think are the the
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:55.040]  the main focus here and having known him almost 40 years the word can't does not exist in his lexicon
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:15:00.960]  he just says he's an american all things are possible sure uh and therefore he is deeply
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:06.560]  committed i know the experts have told him the va system can't be fixed can't be fixed
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:14.080]  he doesn't believe it and he's going to fix it uh it is so refreshing to have a a political figure
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:20.960]  who wins office and that actually intends to do the things he said he was going to do in the election
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:24.880]  well that's right well trump understands what's really going on because he battled big cities
[02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:29.840]  and corrupt machines all over the country and i've had all the top experts on from the va
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:35.040]  even former deputy heads and they say look we're here to social engineer the vets make sure they
[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:40.000]  don't actually get what they're supposed to do and and basically list them all as mentally ill
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:45.600]  so they can politically have their rights taken so it's been deliberately sabotaged that's why i
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:50.480]  mean the the amount of money spent they should all be treated like kings and queens and so just
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:55.920]  taking the foot off the troops necks and just allowing the actual funds to get to them will
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:00.000]  bring in the doctors bring in the people we need so that's what this is about it's like it's like
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.440]  health care we had the best in the world till they started sabotaging it i think that's exactly
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:11.360]  right um it is probably the number one national scandal it's something that i know keeps trump
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:17.520]  up late at night it's something he feels very deeply about uh and you're going to get progress in
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:25.680]  this area but he's got an entire government uh to reform for example um under the democrats the
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:31.840]  interior department uh specifically the bureau of indian affairs has become a money machine for
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:36.160]  the democratic national party that's right nothing against the native americans in their casinos
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:40.080]  but they give what 95 percent i was reading just last week in the wall street journal
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:44.720]  to the democrats sorry you don't have foreign governments that get to do things that other
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:49.840]  people can't and then you use it to manipulate our country and take our guns and our freedom sorry
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:54.480]  native americans sorry you can make billions of dollars but not the expense of my freedom
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:17:00.640]  it's exactly right so believe it or not the number one donor to the democratic national party
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:08.560]  is the trial bar number two are the indian casinos number three is organized labor that is that is
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:17.040]  where we have gotten to uh and the truth is that 90 percent of the cash hold on we got an emergency
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:20.320]  we got an emergency this is much worse than we thought we knew they were trying to start a
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:25.760]  war with russia they've just expelled the russian diplomats and closed russian embassies here in the
[02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:30.160]  u.s that was not even done during the cuban missile crisis or during the cold war uh this
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:35.440]  is something you do when you go to death con two uh defense condition two or maybe even one uh which
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:40.240]  means i mean this is total insanity roiders oh my god this is a cuba against america to stop from
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:46.320]  this is 10 times worse than i thought the united states on thursday expelled 35 russian diplomats
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:51.280]  and closed two russian compounds in new york and maryland in response to a campaign of harassment
[02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:58.880]  by russia against american diplomats in moscow a senior u.s official said on thursday wow the
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:03.520]  u.s official speaking on condition of anonymity we've seen u.s diplomats trying to run into
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:07.200]  their embassies and infiltrate the u.s official speaking condition anonymity told roiders the
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:11.920]  russian diplomats would be given 72 hours to leave the united states access to two compounds
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:17.920]  will be denied to all russian officials as of new friday the official added so this is unprecedented
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:22.160]  roger you were in the next administration you were in the regular administration i mean when we were
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:27.680]  on the edge of you know nuclear war this crap didn't go on this is unprecedented
[02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:34.960]  the obviousness of it is what's so astounding it is it is so blatant i mean this is uh
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:41.520]  reminds me of joe biden troddling about the cyber war that we're going to use to provoke
[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:46.960]  the russians uh they are so does it trump need to tell him stop it right now i mean we need to
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:53.440]  start i mean this is the this is an act of war right here this is what i mean you shut down embassies
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:19:00.880]  once war starts uh the problem of course is that the administration wouldn't listen just yesterday
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:08.560]  in an interview president obama says that had he run against donald trump he's confident that he
[02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:15.120]  would have beaten it money what happened to the american tradition of the outgoing president
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:21.840]  not criticizing the engulf coming president right versus it has been a bipartisan tradition
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:26.720]  in this country since the beginning of time roger roger i mean look they would only invoke
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:31.280]  and claim the russians had taken over through trump if they were planning to engage cog and have
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:36.160]  martial law and war i said that three weeks ago they got picked up internationally i mean i've
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:41.120]  studied cog we're gonna skip this break guys i'm gonna skip all of them here about to have a nuclear
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:46.640]  war this in my knowledge uh roger let's get on this right now and get watson on it too i don't
[02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:52.160]  believe they've ever done something like this where they close diplomatic compounds that are already
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:56.720]  established uh without having a congressional law that just changes where they can have them
[02:19:56.720 --> 02:20:01.040]  and that's not been done even during the cold war roger this is unprecedented these actions were
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:05.280]  taken to respond to russian harassment of american diplomats see no proof now it's not hacking now
[02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:10.640]  it's harassment yeah who exactly are these diplomats and why was not not reported at the time and the
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:16.080]  actions by diplomats that were have been assessed to be not consistent with diplomatic practice
[02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:20.480]  the officials told russia i mean this is this is just the beginning they're saying they're
[02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:24.640]  they're going to launch a cyber war on russia i guess turn their lights off maybe turn a nuclear
[02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:28.720]  power plant off and then we have another chair noble what just have a freaking nuclear war here
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:37.440]  roger anything is impossible uh under this administration and hysteria they uh are experienced
[02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:42.640]  because they see down from assembling the new world order well i said last night i watched seeing
[02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:47.840]  in and they had the look of people around a death watch where they went something big is about to
[02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:53.520]  happen war and it's trump's fault and they went it's his fault knowing it's all them doing it and
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:21:00.800]  then they just went so be it and i was like watching what i saw before 9 11 on cnn again
[02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:04.960]  and they said something big is going to happen big towers are going to come down or laugh never be
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:08.640]  the same we're going to change the way we have freedoms there's going to be a big war and it was
[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:14.720]  the heart rubbin commission gary heart and warren redmond on no no it was it was cnbc it was hard
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:21.040]  ball and they were telling that 9 11 was coming in the world would ever be the same on on july 24th
[02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:24.720]  and i came out and said they're going to blow up the world trade center blame it on me lot
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:31.440]  i'm seeing the same weird criminal energy now on the tv channels as they prepare for something big
[02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:35.280]  roger and roger you know i don't just say stuff i mean everything's aligning i think they're
[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:42.000]  going to try a coup i think we're in an emergency situation right now i i agree with you i'm
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:48.480]  particularly concerned about the president's uh security um he is hunkered down at his place in
[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:56.400]  palm beach uh but as each day gets closer to january 20th good god the hysteria level just
[02:21:56.400 --> 02:22:02.880]  ratchets up up up uh so i think that these are desperate times and these are desperate people
[02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:07.840]  who will do desperate things let's be clear if we were reading about this 50 years ago in us history
[02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:13.200]  there'd be thousands of books to be the number one thing ever the battle the the war the democrats
[02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:17.600]  not leaving being funded by foreign powers claiming that another president who wasn't
[02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:22.640]  was funded by it i mean they're the ones that have the indian casinos putting money into hillary
[02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:27.920]  they're the ones with the saudi arabians bragging they gave 20 they're the ones in the wiki leaks
[02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:32.160]  involved in all the crime and all the foreign collusion and all the foreign money then they're
[02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:37.520]  blaming america wanting our sovereignty back on the russians and claiming if murkels voted out
[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:43.520]  they're gonna ignore the vote because the russians did that too i mean this is crazy they have to be
[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:50.800]  very disappointed in the fact that only 29 of the american people have bought the entire fraudulent
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:58.000]  argument that the russians have been somehow affected our election um this was their big move
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:03.760]  and it has sure so let me ask you this question as a gift prop it has failed as a gift prop and now
[02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:07.440]  you're going to take it to the next level i agree roger so let me ask you this question
[02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:12.560]  what does trump do what do we do these are abject line criminals we have the wiki leaks
[02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:16.320]  they're completely insane they're trying to start a war with russia they clearly shot down the
[02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:20.080]  airplane and the other one as well with a service air missile there's footage of that
[02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:24.160]  they're killing diplomats they're they're they're they're hurtling towards war they've got keith
[02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:30.640]  over and calling for war with russia screaming russian scum this is insane well the good news of
[02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:36.880]  course is that the president has surrounded himself with a solid group of uh of uh advisors like
[02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:45.440]  general james mad dog mattis uh jen general flinn so he's not out there alone i guarantee you he is
[02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:51.440]  huddled with his advisors uh and that they know and i mean do they understand the magnitude of
[02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:54.800]  what's currently happening because i understand they want to be you know you're fixing america
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:58.800]  getting us jobs trying to prove they're nice guys while the fricking demons are planning
[02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:04.880]  to start nuclear war and openly causing into fire to overthrow israel uh again i think that the uh
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:12.160]  the uh establishment types have been so brazen so obvious in their moves that they're entirely on
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:17.760]  uh president trump's radar screen now i think he knows exactly what's going on and i tune counting
[02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:24.480]  the minutes before he takes office gosh i think they're crazy enough i mean they got soros who commands
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:30.000]  this whole thing saying he's hitler and he must be stopped what do you make of that this has been
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:37.520]  a trend that you spotted from the beginning all along the way they have accused us of exactly
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:44.640]  what they are doing at every step of the process from the beginning so they're the ones who would
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:52.320]  would like to stage a hitler like coup but we blame that on donald trump it it's kafka esk i mean it

[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:05.360]  now if everybody's we're about to go to break and come back it looks comical for them saying the
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:09.440]  election was stolen by russians and we're all russian spies and they just passed the law last
[02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:14.240]  friday to start censoring media they claim is connected to the russians and turn loose the
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:20.320]  board of governors under the fcc under cia command to shut down the internet you name it that's a huge
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:26.960]  story that the internet print media uh satellite all of what they're claiming is down to the fcc
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:32.880]  under the national defense authorization act of 2017 and they admit that they're going to censor
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:38.000]  now the censorship's already beginning at google facebook and twitter they're not going to bring
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:44.000]  in total censorship until they start a war and then it's oc we're rounding up the russian agents
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:52.640]  this is just so historic so brazen so naked so insane and it's sure to cause a civil war they
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:58.400]  miscalculated with hillary they miscalculated with the polls they miscalculated on wiki leaks
[02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:02.960]  they're run by this crazy old nazi collaborator and they're planning to not let truncate into
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:08.240]  office and start a war with russia and they're willing to start a nuclear war before they
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:14.000]  they're willing to overthrow israel basically saying to the Arabs start attacking israel

[02:33:24.880 --> 02:33:28.240]  i knew that there'd been the expelling of diplomats going back during the cold war back and
[02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:32.480]  forth if they said you're really a kgb agent or you're really cia but it's unprecedented
[02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:36.560]  to close entire buildings and entire centers and that's what's happening this is just the
[02:33:36.560 --> 02:33:41.600]  beginning obama sings cyber attacks you name it what really matters is russia's not been proven
[02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:46.720]  first the intelligence agency said no that's not true it's being made up then obama went in
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:50.800]  and basically ordered him to say well they might have influenced things but didn't physically hack
[02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:58.000]  this is why we have everything from the native american casinos being the what second or third
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:03.440]  biggest donor to the democrats that's a sovereign nation with money to the communist chinese and

[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:06.240]  what's in ap roiders and others i've got the article right here about how the spanish government
[02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:10.720]  saying ices and others are recruiting and getting money in latin america well that's what the head
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:15.360]  of south com said two years ago and the board patrol thousands a month of other than nexican
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:20.800]  coming across mainly from the middle east and china so the border is just wide open disease comes
[02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:25.920]  across you name it they know you have tv they let you come across if i had drug resistant tv and i
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:31.280]  flew it's a felony but the board of patrol is ordered to let people across with leprosy
[02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:35.680]  and i tell you this years ago you'd say oh that's not true i was being told by the board patrol
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:41.040]  we'd blow their faces out now the board patrol doesn't care even if they get arrested by obama
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:45.840]  they go on tv and tell us what's happening the head of the board patrol in south texas comes on
[02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:51.920]  because they care they realize the country's so far gone so this is just crazy town so discuss
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:56.800]  what we think's behind all this uh are three of our great reporters leon and everybody just chime
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:00.640]  in free for all here ladies because you know i'm a you know like a warthog i'll just get in here
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:06.400]  and keep keep ranting what do you make of this russia escalation and all the craziness and laws
[02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:11.040]  being signed saying basically we're russian agents well i think you know what people really need to
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:17.520]  understand is that we are being ruled by sociopaths i mean we have sociopaths in power who that's all
[02:36:17.520 --> 02:36:22.640]  they care about is power and and control and they're not willing to relinquish that and they're
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:27.840]  freaking out over the fact that donald trump is going to take office which means prison for them
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:32.160]  if he dares to come out to them he like you said earlier he needs to let george soros know
[02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:37.280]  i'm coming after you you're the number one priority on my list the fact that he's being so nice is only
[02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:41.280]  emboldening these people exactly and you know the fact that we've got like the council on foreign
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:46.240]  relations fearing collapse of the un under president trump i mean they are freaked out
[02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:50.960]  that he's going to cut the funding that's you know the it's like a james bond movie the reclusive
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:54.800]  matt drudge is like one interview every three four years he shows up here a year ago says
[02:36:54.800 --> 02:37:00.320]  they're coming next year i've been told by and now it's here right i mean everything that we
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:05.760]  could take that matt drudge interview and piece by piece he warned us and it's really so he was
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:10.240]  just thinking this up in his own it was being told by high-level people exactly i've been told the
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:15.680]  same thing they were planning when hillary got in to start arresting people i just think that's why
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:20.160]  they're all pissed they were about to have their way with us the intelligence agencies the patriots
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:25.200]  kicked their butt right and now they're pissed they did not see it coming they truly thought that
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:28.400]  they look they're let me tell you something the patriots are going to release all the real dirt
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:32.640]  i think that's why trump's confident is if they really want to push their their stuff's
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:37.680]  going to get released it is going to me you're all going to jail okay just get ready you ask for it
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:41.920]  go ahead well the fact that they're going to want to start world war three out there but then if they
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:46.720]  if they don't allow president elect trump to take office it's going to start a civil war here in our
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:50.880]  own country so they're it's just going to be madness chaos everywhere and it's a big pedophile
[02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:54.400]  guild running it you don't get in unless you're a pedophile that's what they focused on pizza gate
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:58.640]  as a distraction with that one pizza place to divert off all the other emails that proved it
[02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:04.080]  well just guess what it's all going to come out now right alexie right and i know margaret go ahead
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:08.240]  you mentioned them kicking out the russian diplomats from the country you know this article
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:13.440]  that's that's originating from zero hedge it is ridiculous so at some point the white house is set
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:18.640]  to unveil a new sanction and other retaliatory measures against russia specifically the kremlin
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:23.120]  we're going to just continue to freeze all their assets which is exactly what we did after
[02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:27.840]  Crimea and the ukraine situation and then say trump's a russian agent when he unfreezes it
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:34.560]  right exactly and you are as well my my dear boss you are a russian agent as well like we all are
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:39.200]  and you know what these sanctions they just go right along with it why not sanction them why not
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:44.080]  try to freeze their assets yeah why not they just they just signed a bill you know to put the fcc
[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:49.360]  over all media and the cia running it last week that's right and meanwhile we've got the this
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:55.280]  spanish defense uh military report that is saying look we have a hotbed situation happening is
[02:38:55.280 --> 02:39:00.960]  lomic radicalism the conditions are enabling uh because uh because of the way that it is here
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:06.320]  they're enabling this free and almost undetectable movement of their members in the region and yet
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:12.000]  latin america is a major recipient of usc id i might add meanwhile they're a hotbed for radical
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:17.120]  extremism that's right go over that headline because this is important um for folks understand
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:21.680]  our government's made an alliance with jihadis worldwide to give them weapons it's all come
[02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:26.640]  out our military does it they call the conspiracy theory and fake news that the arab spring was
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:33.520]  funded by the west and turned loose when it's a fact it's an admitted it's like the former you
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:38.640]  know a spokesman for for obama saying i was told to go out there and say there is no drone program
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:44.080]  even though it existed for five years thousands of strikes thousands of sorties and i was saying
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:48.800]  something didn't exist that was admitted to exist you know it's like saying donald trump doesn't exist
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:55.040]  or or or leon macu doesn't have brown hair it's prima facia horsemaner what do you think the tactic
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:40:01.120]  here is what do you think this is uh all going actually uh well alex i think where it's all going
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:07.440]  is uh well basically they want to totally create this whole world war three scenarios we've been
[02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:13.440]  talking about i mean they're taking measures beyond anything they've ever done with the cold war with
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:19.520]  russia everywhere you go there's propaganda about russia you know having hacked the election yet we
[02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:25.440]  have no proof there's another uh you know zero hedge article obama under intense pressure to
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:30.480]  release evidence proving russians hacked the election so we're just kind of waiting for you
[02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:36.080]  know the real proof and there is none and that's just the fact of the matter and and it's a cognitive
[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:42.400]  dissonance where you know we're not really understanding who the true enemy is and honestly
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:47.600]  i think that's china and if we push russia away you know they could actually end up in an alliance
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:52.000]  and that could really bring sure that was going till trump came in i mean obama has just been
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:56.560]  destroying us on purpose because they went global corporations to be in charge not nation states
[02:40:56.560 --> 02:41:00.800]  working together and let me just make the big announcement we're in a civil war now when you've
[02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:06.640]  got active corporate media unified lying about the president-elect and lying about independent americana
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:12.000]  i mean no one in you know in the reality-based universe would say i'm connected to russia anybody
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:17.280]  else is and so here we are battling for this republic battling to lower taxes battling to
[02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:21.840]  take care of our veterans battling to secure our borders battling to stop the government funded
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:27.040]  cop killing and all this insanity and then they're saying we need a war with russia and are doing all
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:32.240]  the things you do before a war and then they just activated the middle east to blow up with an
[02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:38.400]  end to fata this shows they're going for broke with 21 days let me ask all of you again going back
[02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:43.600]  to ashley then right through margaret and leon what do you think they're gonna pull next in 21
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:50.800]  days what do you think we can do well it seems like um israel seems to be you know really really
[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:56.000]  hot button issue right now they they seem to really be pushing at me with john carrey yesterday
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:00.800]  saying that uh you know israel is never going to be at peace there's never going to be a two-state
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:07.040]  solution you know so i really think that they're gonna try to use israel and you know russia you
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:14.640]  know some of our big allies in order to um just kind of create this world war three uh scenario
[02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:18.800]  before trump gets into office i totally agree before you keep going brother i've always pointed
[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:23.440]  this out and like i said gary johnson accidentally you know and does this flick of the tongue thing
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:27.680]  and when he was here with like steric the walls like he was on something then people notice he
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:33.280]  started doing it in public carrey looks like he's wearing a rubber mask and constantly like a snake
[02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:38.240]  flicks his tongue out like he's got you know down syndrome or something i'm not trying to be mean
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:43.120]  here what has happened to these people it's like they're possessed by something what do you what do
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:49.600]  you make of this uh ashley and then the others uh well definitely it looks like it could be some
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:53.920]  sort of mental illness i mean there are so many different things that could be affecting these people
[02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:58.160]  we don't know you know what they could have been undergoing you know these new technologies and
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:02.160]  things we have no idea you know what i was about to say he didn't look like this till about two
[02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:07.600]  years ago and then he used to merge with this rubber head and the tongue flicking it's a really
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:11.760]  really really weird tick i'm telling you gary johnson did not like a human when he was here
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:15.920]  he'd been here before it was totally normal what do you think it is maggie you know it's a demonic
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:20.160]  possession if i had to guess that's my expert opinion and we've got we've got him saying you
[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:24.480]  know what israel you can't both be jewish and democratic well screw democratic number one
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:29.920]  especially your version of it buddy uh and i wasn't saying the u.s can't be based on christianity
[02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:34.240]  doesn't mean it's a state-run religion but christians were in the founding right exactly
[02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:38.560]  meanwhile we've got these nation states working together tayyip erdogan of turkey and russia
[02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:42.720]  of latin mere putin discussing a ceasefire they can conveniently conveniently leave
[02:43:42.720 --> 02:43:48.720]  our president out of it uh because he props up imams of iran and goes after israel so
[02:43:48.720 --> 02:43:53.200]  to your question what could we see the next 20 some odd days you know what we can't take as as
[02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:57.680]  roger stonest said time and again an assassination attempt at the table we have mainstream media
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:02.720]  elites practically calling for it uh there's no telling but it looks like i mean it's clear
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:06.800]  they're trying to start a war ahead of trump getting in and then say we're russian agents we're at war
[02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:12.320]  with russia and basically just have helicopters attack trump tower kill trump wipe him out wipe
[02:44:12.320 --> 02:44:15.840]  out the generals that's why trump's got generals around and trump knows what's going on you heard
[02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:20.320]  stone earlier i haven't talked to trump in a while but i mean this is just out of control yeah well
[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:25.440]  i've told trump i said they're coming after you he goes you know well and that's why i don't think
[02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:29.440]  that he you know he finally came to understand that like they're not going to hold back so he
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:33.920]  just really came after him said whatever you know they they weren't expecting him to go hard in the
[02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:39.200]  debate against bill clinton and everything but we're seeing just this massive gas lighting against
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:44.720]  the masses and and this this is their social gas lighting is it's an inversion of reality explain
[02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:49.360]  right it's it's basically you know someone tricking you by flickering the lights and then you're
[02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:53.520]  saying man why are the lights flickering and they're saying the lights i don't see the lights flickering
[02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:56.960]  you must like hey i just got this iris letter five thousand dollar fine you know about that's
[02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:01.520]  it you didn't get that you're like yeah here's the fine and no you didn't racist or saying you know
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:06.000]  uh trump trump is going to start world war three but meanwhile they're starting world war three
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:10.880]  or president obama coming out and saying everyone should be alarmed about the russians and we're
[02:45:10.880 --> 02:45:15.440]  saying why what would have there's been a coup against this country by multinationals we're
[02:45:15.440 --> 02:45:19.440]  trying to get back in troll like russia did 18 years ago of their own country doesn't mean they're
[02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:23.840]  perfect and of course we're all in solidarity whether it's idly or either uk or whatever we
[02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:29.040]  don't want to be under the globalist and and so they're pissed trying to cause a war to make us stay
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:34.400]  under their un right and that's what i think is just so incredible and yes it's a crazy it's a volatile
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:39.360]  time but it's also really incredible because they're the the beast is on the verge of collapse
[02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:44.400]  and that's why they are really ramping up i agree let's get some uh hydrogen bomb explosions going
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:48.800]  behind us here for tv viewers i mean yeah folks it's a miracle we haven't had nuclear war yet
[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:53.360]  and i was just talking to folks yesterday you know they've got one squadron of airplanes in this
[02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:58.480]  country that in just a few hours could fly from end of end of the country bombing every city
[02:45:58.480 --> 02:46:04.640]  and killing 150 million people okay i mean that's what we've got going with crazy people like carry
[02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:09.840]  with his tongue flipping out and i realized it's like Stockholm syndrome to Islam the Saudis have
[02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:15.280]  bought all these guys off they want some giant global jihad and the left hates christianity and
[02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:20.640]  prosperity so much and is so into authoritarianism they're in love with islam well what do you what
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:24.640]  do you make of the fact that you have john carry coming out telling israel they need to either choose
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:30.640]  jewish or a democratic state but they would never say that to saudi arabia who is beheading women
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:36.320]  for oh yeah women got just got beheaded yesterday for shopping without their husband yeah that's in
[02:46:36.320 --> 02:46:42.240]  my stack it's like we've seen the way that they treat governments who allow or who are democratic
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:47.440]  and who allow christians muslims you know hindus or whatever to live that they took out the point
[02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:51.840]  is if i go to saudi arabia and say praise jesus on the street they're gonna put me in jail right
[02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:55.760]  next time they're gonna execute me now there it is woman beheaded in afghanistan for shopping
[02:46:55.760 --> 02:47:00.240]  without a husband and now they're calling for another woman to be beheaded because she dared
[02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:05.040]  to go out without her headscarf you know in saudi arabia and so this is a bunch of insecure perverts
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:09.680]  i mean i i mean again cutting women's genitals off what a bunch of uncool people man i mean
[02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:14.800]  look at this spanish military report islamic terrorists operate raise cash in latin america
[02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:20.720]  to attack us judicial watch here's another one isis link group calls for new year's eve attacks
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:26.480]  using horrific images if they attack they'll say it wasn't islamic uh frances raises terror attacks
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:31.520]  to support victims of attacks uh religion of peace women beheaded after shopping without husband
[02:47:31.520 --> 02:47:36.720]  jihad in belgium police arrest 14 year old with backpack bombs uh economic jihad isis fighters
[02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:41.840]  receive welfare benefits from danish taxpayers are flying them back to now and get welfare
[02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:45.040]  deserve because they love it i mean there's nothing a liberal woman loves like a jihadi
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:50.160]  uh it's cuckolding i'm gonna be chained up uh security fears well we don't so you go there and be
[02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:54.880]  a slave we don't want it uh security fears prompt police to ban far rights new year's eve protest
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:48:00.000]  in cologne to mark 12 months since wave of sex attacks in the city so the right wingers can't
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:05.360]  go out and protest islam but islam can run around and act like a bunch of morons fire sale hillary
[02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:11.120]  book now at 86 discount again the elite are here's the goodness they're so arrogant they thought we
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:16.800]  wanted this space alien ladies go ahead and comment well so that's the thing is is just going back to
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:22.160]  this whole whole gaslighting we because we are tapped into our humanity look at these stories
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:26.720]  and say my god what is happening this is absolute madness meanwhile you have people like george
[02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:32.960]  soros saying this is the new normal this is loving it trump is hitler it's great this is
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:37.600]  you're you're gonna get terror attacks and it's fine because you gotta open your heart and this is
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:42.880]  the new the new world order immigration open and the left today are just weak minded people that
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:47.040]  submit to whatever they're told via peer pressure who've been bullied and they got the same right
[02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:51.520]  wing establishment hates trump too everybody you claim you hate is against trump but you but
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:56.160]  but you want a killing because your identity is being a dumbass excuse me i know i've been using
[02:48:56.160 --> 02:49:00.720]  some wide profanity i apologize but we're on the edge of nuclear war here people right this is not
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:05.440]  a time to be civil this is the time for people to wake up and realize that they are being played
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:09.840]  on a massive scale yeah i'm gonna wear my trump shirt everywhere trumps my president and anybody
[02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:15.200]  gets in my face i'm done i'm done with pseudo-intellectual jackasses on their holier than thou power
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:22.240]  trip telling me how i want war and how i'm racist you guys jump in well it's hard to see it i think
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:27.840]  here in austin like you were saying there's so many people on power trips here that really did
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:33.120]  want bernie sanders and you know they're in favor of socialism communism whatever you don't call it
[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:39.520]  but uh the bottom line is this i really am happy for american women i'm proud of them
[02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:44.320]  that they didn't actually fall for the line they didn't fall for hillary clinton record numbers
[02:49:44.320 --> 02:49:48.800]  voted for trump you're right and they don't like that number do they yeah and even you know eight
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:55.200]  percent of african-americans voted for you know trump so that was a positive you know we're seeing
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:59.520]  the tide change probably harder than that too it was a massive election fraud right okay yeah
[02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:05.840]  exactly right so yeah but he has a he has a homosexual a woman and a black man all in his
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:12.000]  they were so unsuccessful at the lies he was smearing but soros has the audacity
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:17.200]  to call him a con artist and a dictator my one question does this man ever die is he ever
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:21.360]  going to die it's like literally he looks like that's a good question actually where do we deport
[02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:28.640]  george soros i don't know i hopefully soon uh he just creates so many different uh you know
[02:50:28.640 --> 02:50:34.720]  movements of divisiveness i mean from black lives matter to you know whatever it is just to be able
[02:50:34.720 --> 02:50:39.760]  to bring people down and basically just control every aspect of their lives that's what he wants

[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:55.760]  here on the air with our reporters go ahead good day alex you're a dangerous man you've got us thinking
[02:54:57.440 --> 02:55:01.280]  believe me i've done my duty i don't know we'd be this successful i kind of get sick of being the
[02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:08.080]  biggest fish in a big old gigantic palm with a bunch of sharks but keep praying for us well we
[02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:15.360]  love you deeply but the a couple quick credentials on myself military intelligence officer highly
[02:55:15.360 --> 02:55:23.920]  educated highly intelligent um happened to be in the right place at the right time on talk radio
[02:55:23.920 --> 02:55:30.720]  and this is another day like that i'm also the most widely and often heard caller broadcaster
[02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:38.880]  and talk radio and as i sit here and listen to the developments of today and you talk about
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:44.560]  a couple generals and the positions that they find themselves in thanks to trump
[02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:52.160]  let us not forget the least mentioned general who is the biggest man among us and that is general
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:56:00.240]  joseph dunford excuse me general joseph dunford chairman of the joint chiefs of staff a college
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:10.960]  brother of mine um who i think is going to be our salvation as he has been up until this time
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:15.200]  as reported by dr steve pacenek and by the way i want to be very very clear for the folks that
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:20.720]  don't know it has been the military that has held back obama and backing isis and all kind of that's
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:25.840]  who blocked him that's who released the wiki leaks and that's why they're so angry so the good news
[02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:31.200]  is that's uh you know i hope the military stops obama because uh they're trying to figure out
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:38.000]  how to get this going and you're absolutely right but we have reason to think that uh they already
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:46.800]  have and will continue to as long as we uh we continue to identify the strengths that we have
[02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:52.480]  among a couple groups of men so let me ask you this do you i mean you concur with our analysis
[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:55.920]  of this and a and then b do you think they can get away with launching a larger war
[02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:05.440]  uh yes and certainly and it depends upon how started how stout hearted these men are
[02:57:06.160 --> 02:57:11.360]  see we have a couple groups of men to that we owe our existence to one is called the founding fathers
[02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:16.080]  the ladies who run our government want us want us to refer to them as the founders
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:24.000]  because they are missing from the phrase founding fathers and without with women in that room at
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:29.280]  the time you never would have had this republic can we agree on that if there was any estrogen in
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:33.440]  that room well i think we got three ladies right here but the point is it just becomes a distraction
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:38.000]  i think a diversion the point is is that is that this planet women have been having the children
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:43.040]  men have been doing the fighting that's what we do but go ahead well not now is a renewal of that
[02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:46.800]  and and i don't care that you got three ladies there that's your problem no no i hear you so
[02:57:46.800 --> 02:57:53.520]  what do you think is going on what i think is going on is is this republic hangs in the balance
[02:57:54.240 --> 02:58:03.200]  and it's going to require the reemergence of the alpha male uh to to save it you see uh with all
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:10.080]  deference to the the ladies and and i'm like trump we we know i hear you but it look it's evil men
[02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:14.480]  like soros that are our issue i think to sit there and say that you know advertisers and
[02:58:14.480 --> 02:58:18.400]  propaganda targets women because then they can get the men to do what they want but i don't
[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:22.240]  think the issue is an issue of women it's an issue of men and women but i hear what you're
[02:58:22.240 --> 02:58:26.320]  saying we're in an epic time first i gotta jump calls back another time when we come back a few
[02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:30.640]  more phone calls get these ladies comment i don't know if i can allow you to talk though i know and
[02:58:30.640 --> 02:58:37.040]  then uh and then hey hey seriously it was a funny call we'll be right back this is the info war hour
[02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:43.360]  number four straight ahead i know there's some pretty heavy news i can use to laugh i'm not laughing

[03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:05.840]  all right in the hour number four
[03:00:05.840 --> 03:00:18.720]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you right from the front lines of the info war
[03:00:20.480 --> 03:00:25.120]  i get what the caller was saying it's called feminization but that's not really even how
[03:00:25.120 --> 03:00:30.000]  women act turning men into subservient people i think the wrong word is feminization
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:33.520]  or the whole metrosexual thing but leon you were agreeing with some of what the caller said but
[03:00:33.520 --> 03:00:38.160]  also you know you know countering it this is the dehumanization they're targeting all of our
[03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:43.040]  normal traits turning us against each other right permission to speak yes you have permission
[03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:47.520]  okay well they'll probably cut that out and actually did that so go ahead well look jones
[03:00:47.520 --> 03:00:54.320]  makes us female people get permission go ahead well you know to to kind of backfarers up a
[03:00:54.320 --> 03:00:59.040]  little bit there i mean obviously yes we have seen a lot of these feminizes come out and really
[03:00:59.040 --> 03:01:06.160]  dehumanize men and they really push this emasculation and you know they women really only want men
[03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:10.480]  who are subservient emasculations the right word yes the woman had the right you had the
[03:01:10.480 --> 03:01:14.960]  right word and i didn't yeah you know and so i understand that to a certain degree is like
[03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:20.640]  putting these certain women in power that demand that their men grovel at their feet to that i
[03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:25.040]  understand because we do have a bunch of uh chicken neck nellies running around telling everyone
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:30.080]  what to do they're not real men um but you know at the same time as i sit with these three women
[03:01:30.080 --> 03:01:35.280]  on the panel i also think that other women out there as well as men appreciate that they can
[03:01:35.280 --> 03:01:40.720]  look sure and right wing men responding like it's women doing this to them it's social engineering
[03:01:40.720 --> 03:01:46.000]  against all of us right it was like a long time ago the social engineering that that forced women
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:50.720]  into the workforce breaking up the family we've all been socially engineered so let's not fight
[03:01:50.720 --> 03:01:55.120]  amongst each other even more i agree uh ashley margaret you want to comment on this and i got
[03:01:55.120 --> 03:01:58.800]  some ladies holding i have to hold them over so i actually get to them and you know ruth and debbie
[03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:02.560]  so they can speak but these evil women are calling in to fight the new order how horrible
[03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:07.600]  shut them up go ahead yeah exactly i was just going to say i do agree you know with what some
[03:02:07.600 --> 03:02:13.840]  of the things that the caller was saying um but uh the bottom line is this uh basically you have
[03:02:13.840 --> 03:02:19.760]  a situation where yeah it's a lot of emasculation we do have a return to the alpha male i think that
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:25.760]  was shown with trump actually winning the presidency so i mean i i agree with him on the alpha male
[03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:31.120]  better deliver right exactly right he better deliver exactly and and the bottom line is you
[03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:36.320]  know we have to stay together like like you said it's a divisiveness when they're trying to pit
[03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:39.760]  women and men against each other that's not what we need sure and they're the ones doing it and the
[03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:44.560]  right wing falls into that too much doing it right exactly we need women to be women in in my opinion
[03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:50.240]  and meant to be men and when you bring that back then you know things will get better absolutely
[03:02:50.240 --> 03:02:58.160]  great point um Margaret yeah i love you leon and ashley i'm not backing up ferris i personally
[03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:03.360]  like them ladies on air and the points you bring up so i love it i want more women more women i like
[03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:09.120]  women fair says that's your problem i think women are great you know it's it's it is a pleasure
[03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:13.760]  working at red we work on a lot of men don't we and you know it's a pleasure having a couple of
[03:03:13.760 --> 03:03:19.200]  women to sort of balance out just a little just don't mean i i'm not backing up ferris ashley
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:23.520]  but see i mean we're talking about men and women we're all going to die a nuclear war
[03:03:23.520 --> 03:03:27.360]  if this happens that's right we better get our heads screwed on straighter yeah and like i'm
[03:03:27.360 --> 03:03:32.080]  you know kind of a traditional female i like the man to be in charge but i don't want some alpha
[03:03:32.080 --> 03:03:35.680]  male that's beating his chest and doesn't know how to communicate plus he doesn't have a job that
[03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:39.440]  tells you what to do like if a guy is going to be somewhat charged he better be bringing it yeah
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:43.920]  exactly and i think i think now we've evolved to a certain place where you know you want your alpha
[03:03:43.920 --> 03:03:49.600]  male to respect you because you're an awful female like he wants but i'm any real alpha male disrespects
[03:03:49.600 --> 03:03:54.800]  their female right that's i mean that's what i and the female respects their male and i do see that
[03:03:54.800 --> 03:03:59.120]  possessively because they possess each other we're gonna write a book and it'll be coming out soon
[03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:04.480]  let's uh let's get to this absolutely we're we're gonna continue on he doesn't mind we cut it his
[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:09.360]  time we love him the co-hosting the fourth hour once a week so uh mr. rabbit pours straight ahead
[03:04:09.360 --> 03:04:14.480]  we're gonna come back finish this talk to ruth and debbie and then a few others i may just discriminate
[03:04:14.480 --> 03:04:18.160]  against the man and go to them later actually the women have been holding almost the longest so
[03:04:18.160 --> 03:04:23.600]  i'm gonna go to ruth in order she's up next uh so i just kind of always just have a quality you
[03:04:23.600 --> 03:04:28.480]  know what i mean i just instinctively do it because that's how i want to be treated right i mean it's
[03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:33.200]  just common sense but i see i think that's why you know you are an alpha male and you don't have a
[03:04:33.200 --> 03:04:37.600]  problem with the ladies which is why you don't hate on women i think a lot of men that hate on
[03:04:37.600 --> 03:04:41.920]  women have not had success with the way exactly the more success you have with women the more you
[03:04:41.920 --> 03:04:50.880]  want to be around women it's a telltale sign it's a telltale sign i love my mommy i don't have mommy
[03:04:50.880 --> 03:04:56.880]  issues i don't have i don't i don't i don't have a great great dad great mom all right we'll be uh
[03:04:56.880 --> 03:05:04.960]  right back stay with us would it surprise you to know that isis and hasbalar operating freely in
[03:05:04.960 --> 03:05:09.840]  latin america and these islamic terrorists they can raise money and they're all planning to attack
[03:05:09.840 --> 03:05:14.880]  the united states while in latin america now this part of the world has become a hotbed for islamic
[03:05:14.880 --> 03:05:19.680]  terrorism groups like isis operate freely they're able to raise large sums of money to finance
[03:05:19.680 --> 03:05:24.320]  activities in other countries mainly here in the united states now this is according to one report
[03:05:24.320 --> 03:05:29.520]  released by spain's defense ministry i'm quoting directly here latin america represents an important
[03:05:29.520 --> 03:05:34.320]  region for islamic radicalism because conditions enable the free almost undetectable movement
[03:05:34.320 --> 03:05:39.680]  of their members throughout the region the u.s has been largely not focused on the latin american
[03:05:39.680 --> 03:05:45.440]  activity but this specifically highlights the fact that isis and hasbalar they can operate freely in
[03:05:45.440 --> 03:05:50.800]  spain raise money and their government in the region is considering isis to be a foreign problem
[03:05:50.800 --> 03:05:54.880]  this report is saying and intelligence agencies are ill-equipped to handle the threat that they
[03:05:54.880 --> 03:06:02.960]  represent i'm margaret howe reporting for info wars dot com all across the western world msm is

[03:09:24.560 --> 03:09:29.440]  let's get back to this all the stuff we've gone through to get info wars at this point it was
[03:09:29.440 --> 03:09:34.480]  horrible it was terrible a lot of it but it's it's really sweet now and i love the fact that
[03:09:34.480 --> 03:09:38.640]  vice is doing a big headpiece on us and i just love it these they're all blowing themselves up
[03:09:38.640 --> 03:09:43.520]  discrediting themselves calling us russian agents and all we're here doing is trying to make america
[03:09:43.520 --> 03:09:50.720]  great again no it's it's it's it's amazing how you are somehow able to take all of the attacks
[03:09:50.720 --> 03:09:54.560]  that they've been firing at you well you're doing it too you absorb them in you're doing it too the
[03:09:54.560 --> 03:09:59.200]  whole operation just becomes so much more powerful it's it's incredible to watch well that's because
[03:09:59.200 --> 03:10:03.280]  they're in the wrong way right everybody had this fengali mind control when they call you a
[03:10:03.280 --> 03:10:06.800]  name or something you're supposed to quit and get depressed and go get in the ditch and die
[03:10:06.800 --> 03:10:11.920]  when a bunch of murdering lying scum makes up about it's good the only problem is they now
[03:10:11.920 --> 03:10:16.800]  have run out of everything they've got calling us racist now it's nuclear war and he's going to
[03:10:16.800 --> 03:10:20.880]  ride shotgun on this in this segment we're going to punch out i want to take a few final calls
[03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:26.160]  mr rapaport is here you should read his bio it's up on his news site it's been around for a long
[03:10:26.160 --> 03:10:31.600]  time no more fake news dot com john rapaport investigative journalists work for the biggest
[03:10:31.600 --> 03:10:37.520]  tv networks newspapers you name it how long have you had no more fake news dot com because notice
[03:10:37.520 --> 03:10:42.080]  they claim fake news is their term i know you've been calling them fake news for at least 15 years
[03:10:42.080 --> 03:10:49.040]  i've been interviewing you john 15 years alex 2001 that's when it started and it just seemed
[03:10:49.040 --> 03:10:56.240]  like the right thing to do no more fake news because i was working as a reporter for 19 years
[03:10:56.240 --> 03:11:05.120]  already and my basic target had turned into mainstream news they were the fakers yeah and you
[03:11:05.120 --> 03:11:10.400]  kind of had an inside lane there to see it from so so they're they're trying to claim that they
[03:11:10.400 --> 03:11:14.080]  they may copyright it or trademark and trying to stop us seriously that's in the news you can
[03:11:14.080 --> 03:11:19.200]  actually show up and say you could probably get the copy right now or the trademark bro and say no
[03:11:19.200 --> 03:11:25.280]  i decided the fake news is not the snopes lady in her obese cat you can start notes all right well
[03:11:25.280 --> 03:11:32.160]  we'll sell it for maybe 20 billion and we'll spread the money around and then we'll just uh
[03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:35.760]  you know deep six and completely i don't mean to jump in here on your hour and i appreciate
[03:11:35.760 --> 03:11:40.240]  you doing this uh mr ravin port we got a few callers i wanted to get to first and then we're
[03:11:40.240 --> 03:11:45.200]  going to punch out of here but i i wanted to banter with you and ladies jumping anytime here um
[03:11:45.840 --> 03:11:50.480]  what do you make of them expelling entire facilities of russians not just a few diplomats
[03:11:50.480 --> 03:11:54.960]  that's been done before what do you make of the open war talk uh whether somebody's for israel or
[03:11:54.960 --> 03:11:59.440]  against it clearly they're triggering a new enifata to get a war going into middle east
[03:11:59.440 --> 03:12:04.640]  is this to keep from from getting in or to give him such a crisis that it drives down the economy
[03:12:04.640 --> 03:12:10.160]  they're mad that we have trump euphoria what what is your really uh tuned in brain thing
[03:12:11.440 --> 03:12:18.240]  to create the biggest possible mess for trump when he gets in so that he has to you know this is a
[03:12:18.240 --> 03:12:26.240]  time-worn strategy alex new president comes in and new congress whatever and the people who hate
[03:12:26.240 --> 03:12:33.040]  that are going to throw as much crap in the way of it as they possibly so it's cornstarch
[03:12:33.760 --> 03:12:41.280]  yeah wind him up in so many crises that he can't think straight can't put any policy into effect
[03:12:41.280 --> 03:12:47.520]  he's got to deal with horrendous uh circumstances that's the way it looks to me let's remember while
[03:12:47.520 --> 03:12:53.040]  he's busy it was 50 billion then 60 billion then 70 billion it's over a hundred billion dollars of
[03:12:53.040 --> 03:12:59.040]  new jobs pledged next year by major companies it's causing a huge domino cascade snowball effect
[03:12:59.040 --> 03:13:03.760]  exuberance is exploding a trillion plus in the stock market people understand america's open for
[03:13:03.760 --> 03:13:09.680]  business and the the enemies that have hijacked the country that are foreign globalists are telling
[03:13:09.680 --> 03:13:17.360]  us that we're the russian agents john right and that this is really bad because more employment
[03:13:17.360 --> 03:13:25.120]  is a very bad thing as far as they're concerned it's a really horrendous terrible thing because
[03:13:25.120 --> 03:13:30.720]  it means things are succeeding jobs are showing up people are going back to work that couldn't work
[03:13:30.720 --> 03:13:36.080]  before this is total anti-globalism when stuff like this happens and it's even worse this guy
[03:13:36.080 --> 03:13:42.080]  likes having these rich powerful daughters and sons and super sexy smart wife and oh my gosh and
[03:13:42.080 --> 03:13:48.240]  he's really is multinational and he really is successful they don't like it no they want failure
[03:13:48.880 --> 03:13:54.000]  you know because failure means they can be failures which they already are they haven't
[03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:57.920]  done anything productive in their whole life right george soros perfect example of projection
[03:13:57.920 --> 03:14:04.720]  he says that trump is a dictator and it's going to be like hitler close right right yeah comment on
[03:14:04.720 --> 03:14:13.840]  that yeah he's saying i'm just that way i'm like hitler so therefore i look out there and that's
[03:14:13.840 --> 03:14:20.000]  what i see i mean it was the most ridiculous thing i've read in a long time but this guy who's like
[03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:28.080]  deep-sixing economies and and sinking currencies and starting revolutions and so forth very hitlerian
[03:14:28.080 --> 03:14:35.520]  a true friend of democracy are you kidding i mean the guy he's just a worm a total line exactly trump
[03:14:35.520 --> 03:14:40.560]  deal things and and then meanwhile hitler was into taking things over and blowing things up
[03:14:40.560 --> 03:14:45.760]  that's exactly what soros does and i had to pick anybody in the world that's hitlerian it's soros
[03:14:45.760 --> 03:14:53.040]  right right this is what's happening i mean the psychology of the hard political left is
[03:14:53.040 --> 03:15:00.080]  is we're losers we're failures we know that but we'll never admit it so the only way we can
[03:15:00.080 --> 03:15:06.160]  stand living in the world is to pull everybody else down into our heap where everybody's a
[03:15:06.160 --> 03:15:11.040]  loser and then the government takes care of all of us and that's the only system that we will
[03:15:11.040 --> 03:15:19.360]  tolerate that's why they are you know hating so much at the moment because they fear that success
[03:15:19.360 --> 03:15:23.840]  is coming and that means so they got to get a job in fact he has a quote in there he says
[03:15:23.840 --> 03:15:36.080]  he says we must stop the exuberance stop the exuberance stop the exuberance the exuberant
[03:15:36.080 --> 03:15:43.360]  populism we know more exuberance there will only be depression oh that's cute
[03:15:43.360 --> 03:15:51.520]  actually you want to jump in here uh margaret uh yeah i think uh john is absolutely right i mean
[03:15:51.520 --> 03:15:57.760]  he they definitely want to stop the exuberance they want to end you know our basically rally here
[03:15:58.480 --> 03:16:04.160]  to change our country we really want to make america great again and they're gonna do whatever it
[03:16:04.160 --> 03:16:09.360]  takes to try to stop that rally so you know however they can bring down trump they're gonna
[03:16:09.360 --> 03:16:14.560]  do that you know within the next 21 days within the next year his first year so they can just you
[03:16:14.560 --> 03:16:19.360]  know try to say hey look what trump has done absolutely everything you could have the best
[03:16:19.360 --> 03:16:23.520]  new england patriots football team if they were all demoralized and and thought they were losers
[03:16:23.520 --> 03:16:29.120]  they would lose we have the we have an incredible system still left but we've got to believe in it
[03:16:29.120 --> 03:16:32.880]  and that means believe in what's good in america people say oh now you always bash the system now
[03:16:32.880 --> 03:16:37.120]  you say believe it no i bash the globalist system now that we're getting the americana system i'm
[03:16:37.120 --> 03:16:42.560]  trying to get wind in its sails it's happening right and the enemy is freaking panicking margaret
[03:16:43.840 --> 03:16:48.000]  oh i'm sorry i was just gonna say no no jump in free for all ladies go ahead do it and they're
[03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:52.400]  trying to rewrite history and tell us that america was never great in the first place mr
[03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:56.160]  rapper board he hit it on the head he said that uh he's trying to create the biggest mess they're
[03:16:56.160 --> 03:16:59.840]  trying to create the biggest mess they can before trump gets into office don't you just hate their
[03:16:59.840 --> 03:17:07.040]  arrogance it is so smug it's like who died you and it's the same arrogance and sense of
[03:17:07.040 --> 03:17:11.440]  entitlement that you see with radical islam and even you know an aggressive islamic culture it's
[03:17:11.440 --> 03:17:18.160]  like it's so entitled it's like get off already right and that's why you have the council on foreign
[03:17:18.160 --> 03:17:24.080]  relations fearing the un could collapse under oh no president trump oh he's oh no he will shut down
[03:17:24.080 --> 03:17:28.880]  all of our globalist achievements because he's an unapologetic nationalist because the un's
[03:17:28.880 --> 03:17:33.840]  trying to start a fricking war right and that's why they're going to start their own war so that
[03:17:33.840 --> 03:17:38.000]  he will he will have to deal with a huge mess because they're so afraid of not only a president
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:41.680]  trump but also the fact that the republicans have bold houses i don't think they're gonna be able to
[03:17:41.680 --> 03:17:45.280]  shut this exuberance down i think they're really earning themselves jail cells i mean i mean i mean
[03:17:45.280 --> 03:17:49.280]  this is this is true sedition this is not free speech when you got some weird nazi collaborator
[03:17:49.280 --> 03:17:51.920]  we're gonna skip this network break to give rap report more time we're gonna be out here in a
[03:17:51.920 --> 03:17:56.080]  few minutes but he's ghosting with us right now it's we're gonna start going maybe 24 hours in
[03:17:56.080 --> 03:18:00.960]  the future here with gcn open up another satellite with a great head anderson uh let's go to ruth in
[03:18:00.960 --> 03:18:06.800]  florida ruth thanks for holding we're gonna debbie uh go ahead hi alice thanks to your team um for

[03:18:12.320 --> 03:18:17.520]  tell you something i'm calling you because i'm infuriated when i saw the our globalist um mccain
[03:18:17.520 --> 03:18:22.320]  and lindsay graham stand up and it's like our globalist our cancer it's like our globalist i
[03:18:22.320 --> 03:18:27.920]  mean that's what i call him like our our horrible scum go ahead well they're blaming the russians
[03:18:27.920 --> 03:18:32.480]  you know and and you know i'm not forgetting your participation in the internet either so you
[03:18:32.480 --> 03:18:38.080]  know there's no doubt that the glp has revolved in this in my in my mind oh yeah they're the ones
[03:18:38.080 --> 03:18:43.280]  they're they're helping more than democrats pass it because people say oh you're a republican no i
[03:18:43.280 --> 03:18:49.040]  like the guy the republicans hate i'd like to see them held accountable and i don't think they
[03:18:49.040 --> 03:18:54.240]  should get a free out of get out of jail card either with trust so i'm no i agree i agree i agree i
[03:18:54.240 --> 03:18:59.360]  mean i'm where is this vindictiveness we kept hearing about we need to see some right now i think
[03:18:59.360 --> 03:19:04.800]  they need to be standing up i mean i and we're hearing nothing nothing from them and so it's
[03:19:04.800 --> 03:19:09.280]  hard for them to turn their participants in all of this well trump to his he knows he's got to get
[03:19:09.280 --> 03:19:12.320]  the engine going of the economy and the global economies and the verge of collapsing it was
[03:19:12.320 --> 03:19:16.080]  supposed to collapse once hillary got in now they're trying to collapse it on trump they admit
[03:19:16.080 --> 03:19:21.440]  that and so he's racing on the phone like i'm talking 12 hours a day just making phone calls
[03:19:21.440 --> 03:19:26.000]  okay i'm not i'm again anymore but that's what he does just calling everybody believe believe
[03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:31.280]  order more stuff produce produce produce yeah he's trying to prop it up because folks he's
[03:19:31.280 --> 03:19:35.280]  got the intelligence officers who were in on the globalist plan who are now going against the
[03:19:35.280 --> 03:19:41.200]  globalist explaining this to him so we're in a total battle and i didn't agree with bush after
[03:19:41.200 --> 03:19:46.080]  9 11 saying go out and shop but now we need to go out and shop for local stuff and get things we
[03:19:46.080 --> 03:19:51.120]  need to try to prop this up folks because we don't want this to go down we've got a slowly reformed
[03:19:51.120 --> 03:19:55.600]  the system but for now we've got to prop it up yes people like well i thought you hate the system i do
[03:19:55.600 --> 03:20:01.280]  but we're living in it don't buy cheap communist crap though from the big exactly by local farmers
[03:20:01.280 --> 03:20:05.760]  markets right support your local i mean it's like i want to get out of this house but i'm living in
[03:20:05.760 --> 03:20:11.600]  it right now don't burn it down right you know yeah uh thank you rooth great points jump in any of
[03:20:11.600 --> 03:20:16.640]  you guys to comment to them and then we're gonna go to debbie foreign wars is a is a huge thing here
[03:20:16.640 --> 03:20:23.040]  because the globalists have lived off of this the neocons the globalist we got to attack somebody
[03:20:23.040 --> 03:20:30.560]  libya here iraq there we got to keep on empire empire destruction destruction that's their plan
[03:20:30.560 --> 03:20:37.120]  we build on the ashes we make our new world on the ashes they want conquest instead of renaissance
[03:20:37.120 --> 03:20:44.800]  exactly so the very thought the possibility of a whisper of a of a thread that trump might say
[03:20:44.800 --> 03:20:51.200]  you know as he has this whole thing is completely stupid we don't need to make any wars against
[03:20:51.200 --> 03:20:57.600]  anybody we especially don't need to make any wars in order to prop up the economy if the economy is
[03:20:57.600 --> 03:21:03.360]  a roaring engine so let's just stop all this let's bring a whole lot of troops home and by the way
[03:21:03.360 --> 03:21:06.960]  there are big giant studies from even the big hedge funds admitting okay we were following the
[03:21:06.960 --> 03:21:10.800]  records of the globalists trump's plan actually is going to work we would annihilate china in a
[03:21:10.800 --> 03:21:15.600]  trade war and it would actually break their monopoly system and help the average chinese worker
[03:21:16.960 --> 03:21:24.080]  john then you would have you know the thought of not waging continuous wars and inventing endless
[03:21:24.080 --> 03:21:31.440]  enemies that's racist this is like silver bullet coming out of empire they see the end for them
[03:21:31.440 --> 03:21:37.600]  if we can't do this we don't have any more power this is our all our only powers destruction
[03:21:37.600 --> 03:21:42.480]  that's all we've got and that's their shirt i agree and let's not underestimate here don't
[03:21:42.480 --> 03:21:46.640]  take one more call let you take over john rap before no more thickness calm
[03:21:48.240 --> 03:21:50.800]  let's not underestimate how evil they are i agree they're trying to wreck things for
[03:21:50.800 --> 03:21:57.600]  trump but i think they're planning something bigger well i know possible as they want to just
[03:21:57.600 --> 03:22:03.120]  sink the ship as far as it can go down before trump takes office they could make it really
[03:22:03.120 --> 03:22:10.240]  really bad if they want to yeah i know david night uh said something about when trump got
[03:22:10.240 --> 03:22:14.560]  elected and you know we were both kind of a little hesitant to celebrate and he said you know david
[03:22:14.560 --> 03:22:18.720]  it is kind of like david beating goliath but he he didn't actually kill him until he cut off his
[03:22:18.720 --> 03:22:24.320]  head so that's you know well that's what i've been saying to trump and i said david only knocked
[03:22:24.320 --> 03:22:29.440]  him down on the stone you got to chop the head off bro goliath's gonna get back up right they're
[03:22:29.440 --> 03:22:33.200]  they're gonna plan something even bigger and this was a huge hit to them yeah we gotta cut their head
[03:22:33.200 --> 03:22:37.120]  off and i don't mean that literally that goes alex jones had cut their heads off he's joined ices

[03:22:52.480 --> 03:22:59.040]  see him done in but i wanted to point out alex that we are um considered russian agents because
[03:22:59.040 --> 03:23:06.960]  they have us listed as enemies of the state via their um two constitutions one for the united states
[03:23:06.960 --> 03:23:13.520]  and one of the united states they took our sovereignty when they took our birth certificates
[03:23:13.520 --> 03:23:18.320]  are live certificate of birth sent it over now that's true the imf and world bank they really
[03:23:18.320 --> 03:23:21.840]  do all that that's what we're called natural resources the rest of it and trump knows all
[03:23:21.840 --> 03:23:28.720]  that is trying to end it exactly and i knew you knew that um but that's also why obama is hiding
[03:23:28.720 --> 03:23:33.680]  out in dc because of the 10 square miles of sovereignty he's got that's right let's make no
[03:23:33.680 --> 03:23:38.320]  mistake you're witnessing the attempt to take america back from the globalist that's what soros
[03:23:38.320 --> 03:23:44.000]  is the new owners dying i mean they are they are indeed crap we must stop him and here's the message
[03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:48.480]  i've been thinking we need to call the globalist call the white house call everybody and say look
[03:23:48.480 --> 03:23:52.400]  we know you're starting the wars we know you're behind the attempt to drive up interest rates to
[03:23:52.400 --> 03:23:57.600]  drop the economy we know it's you so you're not gonna blame the american people or trump
[03:23:57.600 --> 03:24:03.840]  if this thing goes you know upside down you're gonna get in trouble scum right yeah we you know
[03:24:03.840 --> 03:24:07.760]  we talk about these presidents that are in office for four or eight years but what about these
[03:24:07.760 --> 03:24:13.200]  corrupt politicians that are in there 30 40 years creating all this great debbie anything else
[03:24:14.400 --> 03:24:20.560]  what i also wanted to put out there about the the mortgages being as fraudulent as they are how
[03:24:20.560 --> 03:24:24.800]  everybody has their own federal account that they're given at birth based on their birth weight
[03:24:24.800 --> 03:24:30.720]  i remember people 20 years ago going explaining how they would sell some houses 20 30 times and
[03:24:30.720 --> 03:24:34.400]  how mirrors was all bs and it all came out the patriots were right absolutely ma'am all right

[03:24:58.480 --> 03:25:04.880]  comment uh from the ladies here from from each of you well i am taking brain force plus as we
[03:25:04.880 --> 03:25:10.080]  speak and it's working wonders but yes i i think a lot of people just need to uh keep their wits
[03:25:10.080 --> 03:25:14.240]  about them maintain their humanity i understand there is a massive gaslighting campaign going
[03:25:14.240 --> 03:25:20.240]  on to try to drive us all insane um so yeah i think that the call to the call to action of just
[03:25:20.240 --> 03:25:24.400]  letting your representatives know that we're on to you and we're gonna hold you accountable i think
[03:25:24.400 --> 03:25:31.520]  is very important okay uh i i totally agree with that and i think uh that the american people the
[03:25:31.520 --> 03:25:37.760]  best way that we can actually support trumps administration and rebuild america is to actually
[03:25:37.760 --> 03:25:43.440]  think with kind of a global mindset and like you were saying take action locally to try to change
[03:25:43.440 --> 03:25:48.240]  things and you know make our communities individually greater that's right co-op all the
[03:25:48.240 --> 03:25:53.280]  stuff they they claim they're doing right we have these people moving from california for instance
[03:25:53.280 --> 03:25:59.680]  taking over our community roles here and changing the way austin's government structure has run no
[03:25:59.680 --> 03:26:04.240]  heck no we need to get back in there i am so encouraged by your last caller what a brilliant

[03:26:26.480 --> 03:26:30.640]  okay rabbi port thanks for letting us jump into your show 25 minutes of it i'd take over my friend
[03:26:31.200 --> 03:26:38.240]  thank you alex all right here we go folks you see a story up on info wars now about uh
[03:26:38.240 --> 03:26:45.840]  uh the mumps vaccine and uh people with getting mumps who've gotten the vaccine
[03:26:46.880 --> 03:26:52.880]  no surprise no surprise i just want to read a quote here from a piece that's up now no more
[03:26:52.880 --> 03:27:02.880]  fake news let's see where is it here between 1984 and 89 the cdc centers for disease control
[03:27:02.880 --> 03:27:14.160]  control sent iraq at least 80 different bio war agents including botulism toxoid and dengue virus
[03:27:15.280 --> 03:27:22.800]  cdc we're talking about you know who they are centers for disease control
[03:27:24.400 --> 03:27:30.480]  the agency of the federal government that loves you to death but really that wants only the best
[03:27:30.480 --> 03:27:36.480]  for you that knows that all vaccines are safe and effective that buys three billion or so
[03:27:37.680 --> 03:27:42.560]  dollars worth of vaccines every year from manufacturers and then claims that they do
[03:27:42.560 --> 03:27:47.520]  vaccine studies that have no conflict of interest of course not how could that be
[03:27:48.160 --> 03:27:53.600]  and of course major media do not pick up on any of what i'm talking about here because
[03:27:53.600 --> 03:28:00.320]  fake news has several strategies maybe the most important of which is omission it's called
[03:28:00.880 --> 03:28:07.200]  leaving things out so let me read that again to you because if you don't know much about the
[03:28:07.200 --> 03:28:12.960]  centers for disease control and you can see the source on this quote if you read the story at no
[03:28:12.960 --> 03:28:22.240]  more fake news between 1984 and 1989 the cdc sent iraq at least 80 different iraq at least
[03:28:22.240 --> 03:28:30.880]  80 different bio war agents including botulism toxoid and dengue virus and these are the people
[03:28:30.880 --> 03:28:37.280]  of cdc that you know the public says well we have to trust them whatever they say about vaccines it
[03:28:37.280 --> 03:28:44.960]  must be real it must be true right i mean isn't that so well do you trust somebody who shipped out
[03:28:44.960 --> 03:28:58.240]  of the us to iraq in the 1980s to saddam 80 bio warfare agents think about that do you trust
[03:28:58.240 --> 03:29:05.440]  that organization or do you not do you trust a major media when they only briefly reported on it
[03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:11.680]  and then let it slide and go away do you trust the department of justice who did no investigation
[03:29:11.680 --> 03:29:19.520]  and sent nobody to jail for this do you understand what i'm getting at here i hope so i hope so
[03:29:20.960 --> 03:29:28.000]  so i'm an investigative reporter i've been around for 30 more years uh 35 i guess it is now
[03:29:28.960 --> 03:29:40.160]  doing stories about fake news i gravitated to that almost immediately fake news and where is it coming

[03:33:24.320 --> 03:33:31.280]  that could have gone today and i'm still still maneuvering here because here's the deal folks
[03:33:32.880 --> 03:33:37.920]  i've been around the reporting game for over 30 years so i've known lots of reporters
[03:33:39.120 --> 03:33:46.240]  lots of reporters some editors people who work in the mainstream what are they doing what's their
[03:33:46.240 --> 03:33:54.160]  psychology first of all their talents spotted you understand what that means somebody picks them
[03:33:54.160 --> 03:33:58.320]  out says this kid is fairly smart he's kind of bright let's bring him in it could be good
[03:33:58.320 --> 03:34:06.800]  and he believes what we want our people to believe already he believes in globalism he believes that
[03:34:06.800 --> 03:34:14.560]  we're all one happy sappy global village he believes that parents should be taking care of their own
[03:34:14.560 --> 03:34:20.640]  kids if the state wants to intervene he believes that community should be planned by the united
[03:34:20.640 --> 03:34:27.440]  nations if necessary people live in little tiny little spaces and so forth kick people who are
[03:34:27.440 --> 03:34:33.760]  living out in so that migrants can live there you know people he he's already on board all right
[03:34:34.880 --> 03:34:41.360]  this is key and crucial they bring these people in they can smell them a mile away so can you so
[03:34:41.360 --> 03:34:49.040]  can i so can they guy walks through the door he's 24 years old he's got a master's degree from uh you
[03:34:49.040 --> 03:34:56.160]  know jerk university and oh yes very good it sits down and right away the editor who's interviewing
[03:34:56.160 --> 03:35:03.680]  him or the personnel guy at the new york times or wherever it is sniff sniff sniff yep i can smell
[03:35:03.680 --> 03:35:09.520]  this guy is a liberal which means he's really a globalist and he's a communist and he's a socialist
[03:35:09.520 --> 03:35:15.920]  and he doesn't even have to know what that means you know the reporter he he just thinks he does
[03:35:15.920 --> 03:35:20.000]  so that's what we want and then he can write articles from the angle that we want him to
[03:35:20.000 --> 03:35:27.520]  write articles from and that's how the game works how do you think universities over the last 40 or
[03:35:27.520 --> 03:35:38.720]  50 years have become so stacked full of socialist idiots and scum i mean real scum scum from here
[03:35:38.720 --> 03:35:43.760]  down to the ground these are the people who are saying there's no such thing as the individual
[03:35:43.760 --> 03:35:49.120]  the individual is extinct there is only the collective and everything is for the good of
[03:35:49.120 --> 03:35:55.120]  the greatest number of people and so forth and you know blah blah blah blah blah students parents
[03:35:55.120 --> 03:36:00.560]  are paying you know whatever it is 50 grand a year for this or the students taking out a loan
[03:36:00.560 --> 03:36:07.520]  that'll never be able to repay this the university is soaking the kid because they can because the
[03:36:07.520 --> 03:36:13.680]  government is guaranteeing the loan program it's a total hype it's a joke there is no more education
[03:36:13.680 --> 03:36:20.720]  higher education in america it's gone except in a few technical fields it's absolutely gone
[03:36:21.520 --> 03:36:32.080]  it's done what has taken the place of it is globalists socialists they kind of they need
[03:36:32.080 --> 03:36:39.600]  you see and the people that hire those instructors and professors they can smell them too oh yeah i
[03:36:39.600 --> 03:36:46.800]  get that whiff of strong socialism from this guy yeah and he's kind of nasty and he's yeah yeah he
[03:36:46.800 --> 03:36:54.480]  looks a little bit like george soros so we like him right away he's kind of a frog somewhere between
[03:36:54.480 --> 03:37:01.680]  a frog and a monitor lizard good this is the guy we want this is the guy we want to teach the young
[03:37:01.680 --> 03:37:10.880]  in this country work a job a paycheck supporting yourself being responsible never heard of it
[03:37:11.840 --> 03:37:17.520]  that's the old world folks the people we're hiring to teach at the universities now
[03:37:18.560 --> 03:37:24.240]  we can smell them they are utopian that are going to bring us into the paradise of equal
[03:37:24.240 --> 03:37:30.720]  sharing for all everything for nothing blah blah blah blah and of course for kids that's
[03:37:30.720 --> 03:37:34.560]  that's great right i mean they already have a lot of things they have a cell phone they have this
[03:37:34.560 --> 03:37:40.240]  they have that man okay so the promise of you know you don't have to work why should you work
[03:37:40.240 --> 03:37:49.040]  who wants to work just coast along on the consumer goods of society that will be dealt to you
[03:37:49.600 --> 03:37:54.880]  because you're entitled from birth to them and you're now part of the elite because you're actually
[03:37:54.880 --> 03:38:00.480]  in college doesn't really mean anything it doesn't add up to anything you're not learning anything
[03:38:00.480 --> 03:38:06.240]  you're not becoming smarter you're actually becoming dumber but it's the status of being in
[03:38:06.240 --> 03:38:11.680]  college and becoming a graduate which you will if we have to push you out the door with a certificate
[03:38:11.680 --> 03:38:18.960]  you know it doesn't matter what you learn this is all a covert op that is now completely out in
[03:38:18.960 --> 03:38:25.040]  the open at universities at media institutions in government who do you think is working all these
[03:38:25.040 --> 03:38:33.280]  bureaucratic jobs that mean nothing in government you think these are people who are self-reliant
[03:38:34.240 --> 03:38:38.480]  and really want to get ahead on their own hook and have a vision of the future
[03:38:38.480 --> 03:38:43.360]  of what it is that they want to create for themselves you really think those are the
[03:38:43.360 --> 03:38:48.640]  people that are working at federal agencies and state agencies and city governments as
[03:38:48.640 --> 03:38:55.520]  bureaucrats all over the country know they're collecting up the people who don't want any of that
[03:38:57.120 --> 03:39:03.680]  and yet we'll say well I have a job yeah I have a perpetual job and that's good because
[03:39:04.320 --> 03:39:10.880]  I don't really have to do anything why should I do anything why should I go out on a hook
[03:39:10.880 --> 03:39:22.000]  and actually earn by my own efforts a living no we're all against that's that's gone that
[03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:27.440]  was some crazy idea a long time ago we've rejected all that's called capitalism free market whatever
[03:39:27.440 --> 03:39:32.640]  you know it was hard saying it destroyed the world except we the globalists rescued it at the last
[03:39:32.640 --> 03:39:41.840]  minute and now we thought we had gotten back on course completely with Hillary Clinton but she
[03:39:41.840 --> 03:39:49.200]  just fell apart couldn't handle it so now we really got a problem because whoever this guy Trump is
[03:39:50.160 --> 03:40:00.000]  he's not her whoever this guy is however big an egotist he might be whatever his real agenda is
[03:40:00.000 --> 03:40:07.680]  he's not her he's talking about crazy stuff like getting corporations to come back to America
[03:40:07.680 --> 03:40:15.760]  after they stole all the jobs and took them overseas he's talking about creating new jobs
[03:40:15.760 --> 03:40:21.520]  all kinds of new jobs we'll see what he does but that's what he's saying and he's blaming
[03:40:21.520 --> 03:40:27.920]  these multinational corporations and the globalists for destroying the American economy and believe me
[03:40:27.920 --> 03:40:33.200]  the economy was destroyed and it still is destroyed because all the employment numbers
[03:40:33.200 --> 03:40:42.960]  are complete baloney complete baloney about the recovery yes the messiah says i just want to
[03:40:42.960 --> 03:40:50.240]  remind you as i exit from the white house into my new role as the prophet of liberalism that we
[03:40:50.240 --> 03:40:59.760]  brought back the economy no you didn't know you didn't you didn't even get close it wasn't even close
[03:40:59.760 --> 03:41:09.600]  it's still horrific part-time jobs jobs that have endings little gigs contract gigs these are all
[03:41:09.600 --> 03:41:19.600]  counted in point figures it's all complete croc because the objective of globalism and people
[03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:29.840]  find this hard to believe is to torpedo economies that's the op folks torpedo economies for example
[03:41:29.840 --> 03:41:38.000]  let's say we're going to fry the world is going to fry and the only solution is that every country
[03:41:38.000 --> 03:41:45.520]  in the world has to sign on and agree to produce far less energy than they are producing now that's
[03:41:45.520 --> 03:41:52.800]  the only way we can stop from frying as a planet that means lower energy production fewer jobs economy
[03:41:52.800 --> 03:41:59.040]  goes into the tank complete tank but we call that utopia this is the coming era this is what we're
[03:41:59.040 --> 03:42:06.960]  going to do to save the planet but so a bunch of fake science is rolled out and on that basis
[03:42:06.960 --> 03:42:13.200]  that's what the globalists are going to do if they're not stopped they're going to torpedo
[03:42:13.200 --> 03:42:22.240]  every single economy in the world because you take over people by first making them weak confused
[03:42:22.240 --> 03:42:31.280]  helpless bilitated that's the strategy it's right in in front of your face it's not anywhere it's not
[03:42:31.280 --> 03:42:36.640]  over here it's not over there it's not up here it's not down there the strategy is right in front
[03:42:36.640 --> 03:42:43.520]  of your face this is what their globalists are doing so this guy this wild talking crazy cowboy
[03:42:43.520 --> 03:42:51.920]  comes along and says nah we don't want any of that plus all you media people are liars you know
[03:42:51.920 --> 03:42:57.760]  you're chronic liars that's what you are you know everybody knows it nobody's been willing to say it
[03:42:57.760 --> 03:43:02.560]  until now but i'm running for president and i'm going to say you're all liars complete liars
[03:43:02.560 --> 03:43:08.720]  from the tips of your toes all the way to the top of your head that's all you do is lie and
[03:43:08.720 --> 03:43:13.200]  then you lie some more and then you lie some more and that's what you do and that's why
[03:43:14.720 --> 03:43:18.560]  you're helping to destroy the country because you're hiding the truth from people about what's
[03:43:18.560 --> 03:43:25.360]  happened the globalist takeover and so this fast talking cowboy suddenly says we're going to stop
[03:43:25.360 --> 03:43:32.160]  all that you people want jobs i know you want jobs to come back i know you're hurting and that's
[03:43:32.160 --> 03:43:38.400]  what we're going to do we're going to prevent big corporations from taking jobs out of america
[03:43:38.400 --> 03:43:44.640]  overseas which is part of the globalist plan and we're going to bring some of those companies back
[03:43:44.640 --> 03:43:54.000]  so the jobs are here which is the anti-globalist plan that's what he said he didn't just say it
[03:43:54.000 --> 03:44:02.800]  once he said it many times over and over and over and over until even bernie sanders began to speculate
[03:44:02.800 --> 03:44:10.240]  that maybe this guy trump actually was serious in which case bernie said at a breakfast after the
[03:44:10.240 --> 03:44:16.880]  election was over hey if he means what he says i would be willing to work with him on the issue
[03:44:16.880 --> 03:44:26.560]  of globalism and jobs we'll see very soon we'll see folks but just the whiff and the whisper
[03:44:26.560 --> 03:44:34.480]  and the possibility that trump might be against globalism is making people shake in their boots
[03:44:36.080 --> 03:44:41.200]  the scum of the media who are complete slaves to the globalist agenda
[03:44:41.200 --> 03:44:49.200]  the globalist corporations who have been feasting off the american people as consumers for god knows
[03:44:49.200 --> 03:44:57.360]  how long without giving them jobs because they're taking those jobs overseas slave labor no environmental
[03:44:57.360 --> 03:45:07.680]  controls of any kind sure this is what trump has been talking about but of course of course the
[03:45:07.680 --> 03:45:16.160]  academicians the reporters say in the politicians say he doesn't mean any of this he couldn't mean
[03:45:16.160 --> 03:45:24.400]  any of this this is all just a fabrication just a lie he's just telling one lie after another
[03:45:24.400 --> 03:45:29.520]  well if he's telling one lie after another then he's not going to do anything to injure globalism
[03:45:29.520 --> 03:45:35.200]  right correct that's what you mean when you say he's a liar so what are you so worried about why
[03:45:35.200 --> 03:45:41.120]  are you so exercised and worked up and afraid and terrorized and panicked that this guy who's
[03:45:41.120 --> 03:45:47.360]  coming in as a president whom you say is not going to really do anything about globalism
[03:45:47.360 --> 03:45:54.480]  then what are you worried about why are you shaking in your pants every night and drinking
[03:45:54.480 --> 03:46:04.800]  yourself to sleep tell me i'd love to know i would really love to know and the answer is very simple
[03:46:06.880 --> 03:46:16.000]  no one with access to major media with significant access is permitted to speak out
[03:46:16.640 --> 03:46:23.680]  vociferously against the globalist agenda or identify what that agenda is or point fingers
[03:46:23.680 --> 03:46:33.600]  at corporations or politicians etc etc and some actual conservatives have come out of the woodwork
[03:46:33.600 --> 03:46:38.800]  who never spoke about globalism before have you noticed that all of a sudden in the last six months
[03:46:39.680 --> 03:46:45.040]  they woke up and said yes globalism is the enemy and this uh and trump is talking about
[03:46:45.040 --> 03:46:51.440]  destroying globalism and and replacing it with the nationality or nationalism or america wow
[03:46:51.440 --> 03:46:58.320]  this is incredible you know why did you recognize uh three years ago four years ago uh when romney
[03:46:58.320 --> 03:47:04.000]  was running and bush was running that they were arch globalists why didn't you say anything then
[03:47:04.880 --> 03:47:09.360]  okay you woke up now you got on the bandwagon now good for you
[03:47:09.360 --> 03:47:20.560]  you this is the fear that trump is not just lying through his teeth that he actually is
[03:47:20.560 --> 03:47:27.120]  going to do something and has already begun doing it bringing jobs back to america preventing them
[03:47:27.120 --> 03:47:35.680]  from leaving and he hasn't even walked into the white house so we'll see i'm not betting the house
[03:47:35.680 --> 03:47:45.520]  or the farm or any of this i'm not saying the greatness has arrived and everything is now
[03:47:45.520 --> 03:47:54.240]  wonderful you know hope and change i'm not going back there don't go back there okay do not go back
[03:47:54.240 --> 03:48:04.400]  there the movement of millions of people who have opted for trump and the millions more
[03:48:04.400 --> 03:48:13.120]  around the world who are also waking up to the idea of their nation as opposed to the globe
[03:48:14.080 --> 03:48:25.920]  the global village these people you are the force you are the basic the major the top the inside the
[03:48:25.920 --> 03:48:32.480]  outside the left the right everything force you are the force you are what can keep this thing going
[03:48:32.480 --> 03:48:43.200]  and expanding by demanding that in fact we get rid of the scourge of the globalists that has taken
[03:48:43.200 --> 03:48:52.320]  over the world and has been you know determined to run it completely and we haven't even gotten
[03:48:52.320 --> 03:49:00.240]  into the technocracy aspect of it which is a whole other thing that you eventually the plan
[03:49:00.240 --> 03:49:05.360]  being that you as an individual human being would have a card and this would be an energy card
[03:49:05.360 --> 03:49:09.200]  and you would carry it around with you and every time you bought something you would
[03:49:09.200 --> 03:49:13.200]  stick out the card and they would take it and do something you know put it in the machine
[03:49:14.240 --> 03:49:26.560]  and subtracted from your energy quota would be the cost of what it took to produce that
[03:49:26.560 --> 03:49:33.280]  particular item that you're buying the cost in energy not in dollars in energy you understand
[03:49:35.120 --> 03:49:42.000]  you get an energy quota everybody has an energy quota and a card and this is the control and when
[03:49:42.000 --> 03:49:50.400]  the card runs out for the period of time for which it's intended that particular aspect you're done
[03:49:50.400 --> 03:49:57.280]  no more energy got to save the planet got to do this can't let everybody fry global warming is
[03:49:57.280 --> 03:50:02.080]  going to destroy us all blah blah blah blah there's I put an article up today on no more fake news
[03:50:02.080 --> 03:50:11.040]  New York Times January 26th 1989 no evidence whatsoever of global warming trend in America
[03:50:11.040 --> 03:50:24.480]  a study was done you know federal funded in-house study no warming over the last 100 years no warming
[03:50:24.480 --> 03:50:29.280]  over the last 100 years but of course now we can't pay attention to that because that's
[03:50:29.280 --> 03:50:36.720]  that has to be wrong it has to be wrong because we have to have carbon taxes and we have to have
[03:50:36.720 --> 03:50:43.920]  uh cap and trade and we have to have lowered energy production vastly lowered energy production
[03:50:43.920 --> 03:50:49.760]  in economies all over the world that will torpedo these economies and the people meaning us who are
[03:50:50.320 --> 03:50:57.360]  you know trying to make a living we'll be back for the last second John Rappaport infill order
