[00:00.000 --> 00:16.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.680 --> 00:28.720]  so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones I woke up at
[00:28.720 --> 00:34.400]  about 3 30 in the morning last night and I couldn't go back to sleep and I
[00:34.400 --> 00:39.000]  wrote down some notes of course I've forgotten left at the house but it was
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.480]  profound and it was extremely simple and it's something we've already talked
[00:44.480 --> 00:51.480]  about before but it gets lost in everything the globalists don't want
[00:51.480 --> 00:56.680]  us celebrating Christmas or anything else that's old and cultural because they
[00:56.680 --> 01:01.440]  want to remove everything and force feed their new systems that's why they're
[01:01.440 --> 01:06.480]  at war with everything traditional and most things traditional are traditional
[01:06.480 --> 01:11.200]  because they're nice and they work and they're productive and they're happy and
[01:11.200 --> 01:18.120]  they punish badness and reward goodness but once you flip the balance into evil
[01:18.120 --> 01:21.840]  it becomes an evil economy and things just go downhill you want to stay away
[01:21.840 --> 01:25.720]  from an evil economy and go towards a good one doesn't mean you're ever going
[01:25.720 --> 01:28.960]  to be in some utopia but you want to be going towards the good in the spectrum
[01:28.960 --> 01:35.200]  and it just hit me that as libertarians as patriots as constructive people we
[01:35.200 --> 01:41.280]  tend to have victories move on it's that quiet professionalism you know that you
[01:41.280 --> 01:44.840]  see in so many hard-working smart great people is they're confident they don't
[01:44.840 --> 01:48.360]  need to sit there and tell you about it all day because they just are and
[01:48.360 --> 01:52.360]  everybody picks up on it women pick up on it men pick up on it I mean that's
[01:52.360 --> 01:56.560]  it that's when you got what it takes the right stuff and other people don't
[01:56.560 --> 01:59.920]  and the folks that don't have the right stuff they're always trying to get
[01:59.920 --> 02:03.920]  together to take over the people that do and then we're always trying to help
[02:03.920 --> 02:07.120]  the people that don't have the right stuff now the globalists don't have the
[02:07.120 --> 02:10.200]  right stuff they've stolen power but they think we don't have the right stuff
[02:10.200 --> 02:12.880]  now want to kill us off because we don't want to play along with their ball game
[02:12.880 --> 02:19.160]  so it's a it's a perversion but that said it hit me we've got to celebrate
[02:19.160 --> 02:23.640]  these tax cuts and I mean really celebrate them and we've got to show
[02:23.640 --> 02:27.640]  how good they are on average I had a chance to read over last night again
[02:27.640 --> 02:31.680]  this morning when I woke up for about an hour hundreds of bullet points in there
[02:31.680 --> 02:36.920]  but there's more than 30 big ones and it's I mean one of the cleanest tax bills
[02:36.920 --> 02:40.960]  I've ever seen it's got some port barrel in there but not one Democrat voted for
[02:40.960 --> 02:46.120]  it which is completely shameful and even a few Democrats on CNN had to come out
[02:46.120 --> 02:50.840]  and say you know what this is really this really is a middle-class tax cut you
[02:50.840 --> 02:55.440]  can't lie about it the ultra-rich already wrote the laws to keep their money
[02:55.440 --> 03:01.360]  offshore Trump just undid the central plank of the globalist taking the money
[03:01.360 --> 03:06.680]  offshore and that's why I get viciously angry when I see Hillary Clinton and
[03:06.680 --> 03:10.960]  Michael Moore and all the usual suspects lying and playing on people's
[03:10.960 --> 03:15.160]  ignorance I mean it really makes me mad the big banks and the ultra-rich the
[03:15.160 --> 03:22.960]  fortune 100 to a group wrote the 40 percent or 38.9 percent tax the big
[03:22.960 --> 03:27.440]  corporations wrote it and I sit there with leftist as they go oh are you glad
[03:27.440 --> 03:32.560]  you're rich friends Alex we're gonna get that big tax cut people just walk
[03:32.560 --> 03:38.680]  mindset mystery oh you're working with the rich people now know you buffoon the
[03:38.680 --> 03:47.680]  ultra-rich wrote it to screw you you pay all the taxes shock even CNN admits
[03:47.680 --> 03:57.440]  tax bill gives working families damn good money 1.5 trillion baby in fact it
[03:57.440 --> 04:01.120]  even got rid of some of the tax exemptions for people making over a
[04:01.120 --> 04:06.400]  million dollars a year if anything it's a tax increase on nouveau rich believe me
[04:06.400 --> 04:10.840]  you're making a million bucks a year that that's not ultra-rich it's not one
[04:10.840 --> 04:14.760]  percent that has 70% of money it's we've done the math it's point zero zero
[04:14.760 --> 04:19.000]  zero zero zero zero zero zero four two of them resurface like a whole bunch of
[04:19.000 --> 04:24.760]  zeros and then four two so it's the point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
[04:24.760 --> 04:29.880]  zero zero whatever four two that are ruling the show and they want a monopoly
[04:29.880 --> 04:34.480]  they want consolidation under Democrat globalist control all over the world you
[04:34.480 --> 04:37.920]  see middle-classes shrink and the ultra-rich created it's the ultra-rich
[04:37.920 --> 04:42.960]  to a man and to a corporation very few women that are promoting this global
[04:42.960 --> 04:46.560]  socialist system because they're exempt from it they transfer your wealth take
[04:46.560 --> 04:51.360]  it for themselves and Trump and all of us just blew a giant hole in it and the
[04:51.360 --> 04:56.000]  EU is panicking the EU admits it's gonna move our jobs back they're
[04:56.000 --> 05:02.520]  threatening us too why is the fungus why is the mold why is the yeast taking

[05:55.080 --> 06:13.360]  are the info war God bless you all. Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming
[06:13.360 --> 06:25.440]  to you live from the front lines of the info war I couldn't fleet at about 3 30
[06:25.440 --> 06:29.840]  the morning I got up because my brain was racing and I got up and wrote a
[06:29.840 --> 06:34.400]  bunch of notes but again I of course forgot left on the kitchen table
[06:34.400 --> 06:40.960]  breakfast table when I came into work today when I came into this war today
[06:40.960 --> 06:49.800]  and I'm very honored and very humbled to be a part of and it was so clear it was
[06:49.800 --> 06:53.440]  all laid out right there and again all of it you're already gonna know I don't
[06:53.440 --> 06:56.560]  tell you anything you don't already know in your heart reason you listen and put
[06:56.560 --> 07:04.440]  up with me at the time the show's a train wreck because of myself because you
[07:04.440 --> 07:10.560]  know deep down I am in this with you and you are in this with me and that's why
[07:10.560 --> 07:16.360]  they always attack and say I'm not real and I hate my listeners when I get tears
[07:16.360 --> 07:20.200]  in my eyes when families run up to me and shake my hand black Hispanic white
[07:20.200 --> 07:29.040]  you name it Asian old young because they're counting on me and I feel weak in
[07:29.040 --> 07:33.760]  in this fight sometimes because I know so much more and I don't have the energy
[07:33.760 --> 07:39.160]  or the skill to properly execute perform operations that I know would turn
[07:39.160 --> 07:44.400]  everything around but I'm not the only person you're not the only person
[07:44.400 --> 07:48.840]  Trump's not the only person and now as we realize we're here and that there
[07:48.840 --> 07:51.680]  aren't just scum in the world there aren't just backstabbers in the world
[07:51.680 --> 07:58.360]  there aren't just vicious liars in the world the worm is turning and evil is
[07:58.360 --> 08:02.280]  panicking they were all so sure that they were gonna bring in this global
[08:02.280 --> 08:07.240]  government it isn't just Hillary that's failing the globalist said last year in
[08:07.240 --> 08:10.320]  major publications in their establishment publications they said
[08:10.320 --> 08:15.920]  emergency red alert they knew internal polls had trump 10 15 points ahead they
[08:15.920 --> 08:19.560]  stole we now know over 7 million votes not three and a half like Trump had
[08:19.560 --> 08:23.560]  earlier been told off of pure research Harvard research it's over 7 million
[08:23.560 --> 08:28.200]  Hillary stole six tapes of five states tried to steal six others and we have
[08:28.200 --> 08:32.240]  all the evidence of that local state Homeland Security caught just
[08:32.240 --> 08:37.560]  department breaking in with their cyber squads trying to flip the votes and
[08:37.560 --> 08:43.160]  stopped them so there's a civil war going on against the globalists that have
[08:43.160 --> 08:46.280]  hijacked the nation and those of us try to take it back it doesn't mean those of
[08:46.280 --> 08:49.920]  us on the side of trying to bring sovereignty back are perfect or that
[08:49.920 --> 08:52.600]  any of the people that have even joined us are perfect a lot of them can see
[08:52.600 --> 08:59.240]  which way the wind's blowing and now as people realize we're going to win it's
[08:59.240 --> 09:03.400]  going to accelerate the victory and the globalists now know they're going to
[09:03.400 --> 09:08.800]  lose for good they finally realized it in the last 48 hours and I can feel their
[09:08.800 --> 09:12.520]  horror I could see their response I could see people jumping ship even faster
[09:12.520 --> 09:17.280]  this is the moment the president's got to be under maximum security everybody
[09:17.280 --> 09:22.840]  else has got to be under maximum guard watch your six right now because right
[09:22.840 --> 09:27.160]  now yesterday when that bill passed and they went up there and had that
[09:27.160 --> 09:33.600]  celebration it was absolutely we turn the corner right there we turn the corner
[09:33.600 --> 09:39.680]  right there that I mean we turned all the corners it didn't mean that we're
[09:39.680 --> 09:43.520]  perfect I mean we don't have a lot of big crises to face North Korea you name
[09:43.520 --> 09:50.600]  it but spiritually what started without inauguration 11 months ago and that
[09:50.600 --> 09:56.080]  declaration bringing God back in the covenant saying it's about humanity it's
[09:56.080 --> 10:00.160]  about workers it's about the people you you're not just the people or the
[10:00.160 --> 10:04.120]  minority or the infighting group you're the people you're the workers you're the
[10:04.120 --> 10:09.520]  builders you're the strivers that that it was invoking God and then saying you
[10:09.520 --> 10:16.200]  are the celebration you have value it isn't just hype it's what builds a
[10:16.200 --> 10:26.760]  culture and then now less than a year later so many promises delivered the
[10:26.760 --> 10:33.080]  globalists are in full panic mode and so we need to celebrate and be thankful
[10:33.080 --> 10:39.240]  for everything we've got being thankful and I know I'm preaching to most of you
[10:39.240 --> 10:42.400]  that already know this but to others being thankful is the answer to being
[10:42.400 --> 10:54.120]  happy and being honorable is the key to real wisdom and the globalists are
[10:54.120 --> 10:56.800]  always going to attack those of us to stand up against them and say that we're
[10:56.800 --> 11:00.600]  the dishonorable ones we're the liars we're the bad ones and cobble things
[11:00.600 --> 11:04.560]  together and twist what we've done or take points when we fall in and try to
[11:04.560 --> 11:08.760]  magnify that to to make us all feel like we don't have a right to be free but
[11:08.760 --> 11:12.880]  it's all a lie it's all a false indictment by the accuser by the devil
[11:12.880 --> 11:18.920]  and that's what the spirit is that's why they always say Jones doesn't believe
[11:18.920 --> 11:23.360]  what he's saying Jones isn't real Jones is an actor because they they don't want
[11:23.360 --> 11:26.400]  you to believe there's anybody else out there the things like you do they're
[11:26.400 --> 11:32.600]  saying you're not real real reason they fear me is they know I'm real and they
[11:32.600 --> 11:37.920]  know I'm committed and they know I have will to stand against what they've done
[11:37.920 --> 11:43.760]  thanks to God but when to my sales and they can't stand that and of course the
[11:43.760 --> 11:48.680]  proof is the pudding judge tree by its fruits we are destroying the globalists
[11:48.680 --> 11:51.480]  we are breaking their corrupt world government we are exposing the
[11:51.480 --> 11:55.840]  technocracies we are unmasking and unveiling their monopolies we are
[11:55.840 --> 12:03.440]  causing together a global accelerated awakening that has evil everywhere in a
[12:03.440 --> 12:09.600]  panic and desperately coming out of their rat holes out of their spider
[12:09.600 --> 12:14.600]  holes out of their eel holes to fire us now which only accelerates their defeat
[12:14.600 --> 12:23.280]  as we draw their fire that's the key to this they've now come into our keep come
[12:23.280 --> 12:27.320]  into our castle to destroy us in the night and just like Beowulf we're
[12:27.320 --> 12:32.760]  waiting and as they try to flee we slam their arm in the door and rip it off
[12:32.760 --> 12:37.760]  we've still got to face other great events but the point is this particular
[12:37.760 --> 12:41.880]  monster has already had its arm torn off and is bleeding to death and its
[12:41.880 --> 12:49.000]  mother is going to fall next because we are going into the mountain next where
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.600]  they molest the children where they engage in the Satanism where they carry
[12:52.600 --> 12:57.960]  out their operations we are going into the mountain and if some of us are
[12:57.960 --> 13:02.240]  destroyed going to the mountain doesn't matter for more of us will follow and it
[13:02.240 --> 13:06.200]  won't be fear going to the mountain it will be honor and the quest for liberty
[13:06.200 --> 13:10.920]  and freedom and an honor to go into the mountain into the enemy's own darkness
[13:10.920 --> 13:17.120]  because we carry the light of Christ in our hearts ladies and gentlemen the EU
[13:17.120 --> 13:26.720]  has completely uncloaked the grandson of the main Nazi fortune Junker who owns a
[13:26.720 --> 13:30.120]  country they hijacked in World War two Luxembourg I mean just the arrest him
[13:30.120 --> 13:34.160]  immediately just of the arrogant insanity of these people snaggle tooth
[13:34.160 --> 13:41.800]  Nazi says no you violated international treaties you can't cut taxes under
[13:41.800 --> 13:48.160]  world government combines we've signed with you at the WTO you can't do this
[13:48.160 --> 13:53.760]  you're gonna move back all the jobs to the United States and raise your wages
[13:53.760 --> 13:58.800]  they actually admit that trumps for real the articles are on enforce.com with
[13:58.800 --> 14:06.120]  just screenshots of London Guardian your spiegel EU fears unfair US tax bill
[14:06.120 --> 14:14.840]  will incentivize companies to move to America and then I've got one right here
[14:14.840 --> 14:21.200]  out of the Associated Press where they announced and CNBC that you violate a
[14:21.200 --> 14:27.360]  global agreement let's pull that up there it is US tax reform breaks global
[14:27.360 --> 14:33.000]  rules EU says oh there's global rules where do you get rules from a government
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.200]  been talking to us like we're five year olds for 50 years while you set up
[14:37.200 --> 14:41.000]  world government stealth and as we said all they got to do is expose it people
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  attack us saying it doesn't exist but when they finally go operational
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.480]  everybody will go what you said this wasn't going on the only people that
[14:50.480 --> 14:55.000]  bought the Kool-Aid and drank it was the globalist and sure they've stolen
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.360]  trillions and those other crap they've got Hollywood

[15:08.920 --> 15:12.440]  the whole world's like how dare you we sucked America dry with big companies
[15:12.440 --> 15:19.200]  they didn't help people in Mexico or people in China with this crud they
[15:19.200 --> 15:24.120]  exploited them they lowered global wages giant sucking sound downward America was

[21:07.720 --> 21:14.640]  the dark ages and put us on the road to the stars extended life and the secrets
[21:14.640 --> 21:19.240]  of the universe that our father is ready for us to enjoy but we have to prove
[21:19.240 --> 21:24.240]  ourselves we won't just be given the keys to the galaxy and the keys to the
[21:24.240 --> 21:30.680]  universe without first being tested and that's what this is make no mistake that's
[21:30.680 --> 21:36.040]  why the enemy coveted that's why they hate humanity the globalist are fallen
[21:36.040 --> 21:41.320]  twisted souls that seek to make greater men and women their slaves always
[21:41.320 --> 21:46.960]  seeking ever hungry for the blood of the innocence and I think about how the
[21:46.960 --> 21:51.360]  media all over Twitter Facebook everywhere I wasn't even looking for it and
[21:51.360 --> 21:58.640]  I saw a look at Tim Scott the uncle Tom you know the beautiful part about our
[21:58.640 --> 22:02.480]  rallies is about half the folks there quote minorities the media panicked
[22:02.480 --> 22:06.000]  about that when we had one at the RNC they said yes it's very frightening
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.160]  half the folks there were black or Hispanic or Asian like more than that
[22:09.160 --> 22:15.940]  everybody got along great but see by telling you oh blacks aren't welcome in
[22:15.940 --> 22:19.240]  the Republican Party or in the Tea Party then blacks don't go that's like
[22:19.240 --> 22:23.240]  the White House Chief of Staff Kelly came out and said we're looking for all
[22:23.240 --> 22:28.680]  qualified applicants please you know if you're a minority we're not getting
[22:28.680 --> 22:34.280]  minority request here we just want competent people so and see that's how
[22:34.280 --> 22:39.120]  that self-segregation works and now the colleges are teaching women don't go
[22:39.120 --> 22:42.440]  around men men don't wear on women blacks go over here Hispanics over here
[22:42.440 --> 22:47.240]  whites over here they're setting up a prison and then hyping up stuff and
[22:47.240 --> 22:53.520]  staging false hate crimes and then Tim Scott who had tears in his eyes
[22:53.520 --> 22:57.880]  talking about President Trump who it's real affirmative action and if you
[22:57.880 --> 23:01.240]  really want to do it even though it discriminates either has been past
[23:01.240 --> 23:04.160]  problems but it's actually teach somebody how to fish don't give them fish
[23:04.160 --> 23:10.280]  they're gonna deploy want to say racially massive extra funding for
[23:10.280 --> 23:14.800]  factories jobs and businesses into black areas which is good for the country
[23:14.800 --> 23:17.280]  good for everybody we need to lift these folks up that have been on a
[23:17.280 --> 23:21.320]  Democrat plantation for 200 plus years they just put them on a new one when
[23:21.320 --> 23:23.840]  LBJ figured out blacks were running their own businesses and becoming too
[23:23.840 --> 23:29.040]  wealthy and so they've come out a bunch of an attack Tim Scott called an uncle
[23:29.040 --> 23:32.480]  Tom he actually read Uncle Tom Uncle Tom wasn't a wimp he was a Christ figure
[23:32.480 --> 23:36.160]  doesn't mean you don't always lay down you don't always stand up no one to
[23:36.160 --> 23:39.600]  hold him no one to fold him but that Christ figure could Christ wasn't a
[23:39.600 --> 23:43.800]  wimp at that point or Gandhi wasn't a wimp or Martin Luther King wasn't a wimp
[23:43.800 --> 23:47.960]  I mean Martin Luther King you call it Uncle Tom he got killed being loving and
[23:47.960 --> 23:51.200]  being a good person of course they so people don't know what Uncle Tom means
[23:51.200 --> 23:55.000]  because the Democrats took it and turned it into a purjorative by the 1870s look
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.280]  up who did it I wanted to check my memory so it read up on the history this
[23:58.280 --> 24:03.280]  morning again they flip everything you got the blacks running towards the KKK
[24:03.280 --> 24:07.880]  party because they don't know any better because they've been lied to by the
[24:07.880 --> 24:15.720]  schools like everybody else that know any better so it's it's just incredible
[24:15.720 --> 24:19.520]  ladies and gentlemen and of course it was Uncle Tom's cabin that moved
[24:19.520 --> 24:23.240]  everybody to finally embrace abolitionist and not want to have slavery
[24:23.240 --> 24:29.200]  anymore it was that book about the Christ figure Uncle Tom that actually triggered
[24:29.200 --> 24:34.760]  all of that and by the end of the Civil War millions of dead by the end to stop
[24:34.760 --> 24:38.440]  slavery wasn't started over that but see they take that victory away from you and
[24:38.440 --> 24:43.040]  say oh he was a bad pathetic person that groveled and everything he was
[24:43.040 --> 24:48.280]  servile he was always other things well if you're in front of all the cameras
[24:48.280 --> 24:51.440]  and your enemies about to kill you it destroys them when they kill you was
[24:51.440 --> 24:55.840]  Obi-Wan Kenobi and went at the end when he let Darth Vader chop him in half no
[24:55.840 --> 25:02.120]  he knows it's about to commit the next generation of the fight he's done at this
[25:02.120 --> 25:07.880]  point he's also gonna buy some time and again that's fiction Uncle Tom's fiction
[25:07.880 --> 25:13.920]  but it helps people understand what real heroism is at the point that you need
[25:13.920 --> 25:17.880]  to let people kill you if you're the spirit decides the time then you don't
[25:17.880 --> 25:22.840]  fight you let them kill you because it brings them down because an hour later
[25:22.840 --> 25:27.000]  you blow up the Death Star those are all allegories of how things really work
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.360]  Martin Luther King blew up the Death Star
[25:30.360 --> 25:35.120]  Charlton Heston marching with him to help end real racism blew up the Death Star
[25:35.120 --> 25:38.640]  those that got blown up came back with hey we'll take control of these people
[25:38.640 --> 25:43.200]  this way and they've done it and they've taught racism and horrible wickedness and
[25:43.200 --> 25:47.000]  horrible vicious attacks by black people against whites and others all over the
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.640]  place ten to one twenty to one thirty to one depending on the city and the
[25:50.640 --> 25:54.320]  media covers it up and they won't you see it it's not the demonized blacks it's
[25:54.320 --> 25:58.400]  to say what you're doing is wrong just like KKK doing stuff that's wrong stop
[25:58.400 --> 26:03.000]  it it's evil because most people aren't psychopaths they make excuses for why
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.520]  they go out most people that were KKK weren't psychopaths they were bought
[26:06.520 --> 26:10.360]  into it they were manipulated into it same thing with blacks that now act like
[26:10.360 --> 26:15.320]  the KKK but in a much wider scale of true persecution but see it's all okay
[26:15.320 --> 26:20.320]  because the old KKK people that control the KKK are in control of you they
[26:20.320 --> 26:23.640]  weren't believe in any of that stuff people that control the KKK they wanted
[26:23.640 --> 26:26.920]  to control the poor farmers that were their real competition by putting them
[26:26.920 --> 26:32.040]  into a secret society group they could control a gang see these people know what
[26:32.040 --> 26:35.080]  they're doing these the parasites are very very smart let's go out to break
[26:35.080 --> 26:39.760]  with Tim Scott that they hate so much because it's like a Moses to lead black
[26:39.760 --> 26:43.600]  folks off the plantation and we'll come back with a powerful video that McBreens
[26:43.600 --> 26:48.800]  put together because Trump is going to now go after the welfare system they're
[26:48.800 --> 26:51.080]  gonna say that they're killing everybody but that's not what's happening we're
[26:51.080 --> 26:54.440]  literally taking people and not letting them be domesticated from the company
[26:54.440 --> 26:58.960]  store like they had whites of slaves as sharecroppers here it is Mr. President
[26:58.960 --> 27:04.840]  during one of those conversations that we had we talked about ways to improve
[27:04.840 --> 27:09.960]  distressed communities throughout this country 52 million Americans living in
[27:09.960 --> 27:13.840]  distressed communities and we talked about legislation that can move those
[27:13.840 --> 27:19.560]  communities forward and you said yes and as a part of this tax reform package
[27:19.560 --> 27:24.920]  the investing and opportunity act has been included which will bring
[27:24.920 --> 27:31.480]  trillions of dollars into poor communities because of your willingness to
[27:31.480 --> 27:42.800]  listen you know they say Tim Scott's so young and so I only have about 45 probably
[27:42.800 --> 27:53.960]  gonna be the next like president my long time okay let me just say to those
[27:53.960 --> 27:59.640]  Americans who are watching this process this is not about Washington it's not

[34:19.960 --> 34:24.360]  biggest problem us so part of it is you have to break through our kind of private

[34:28.120 --> 34:31.680]  recognize that kids belong to whole communities if you've got a business that

[35:04.920 --> 35:21.840]  department the dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras parents
[35:21.840 --> 35:25.440]  grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in
[35:25.440 --> 35:29.360]  their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a
[35:29.360 --> 35:32.600]  SWAT officers rifle they let them in the area they told them they could come in
[35:32.600 --> 35:36.040]  and now they're coming in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people
[35:36.040 --> 35:41.320]  we're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down if
[35:41.320 --> 35:44.920]  you want a commentator
[35:44.920 --> 35:51.800]  we are on the march the empire is on the run live from the info wars dot com
[35:51.800 --> 36:07.360]  studios it's alex jose you can feel the energy rising
[36:07.360 --> 36:12.120]  entire planning with our attention for the disastrous rise of misplaced power
[36:12.120 --> 36:25.480]  exist and will persist and the threat will persist of misplaced powers we're
[36:25.480 --> 36:29.680]  not out of the woods but we've turned around we're on the right way we're
[36:29.680 --> 36:37.800]  getting to cut down the evil they had to cut the taxes you can run and even one
[36:37.800 --> 36:44.720]  of the top CNN hosts has been forced to come out and admit it's up on info wars
[36:44.720 --> 36:49.440]  dot com the video and the tweet I'm gonna play that video coming up if I
[36:49.440 --> 37:01.440]  didn't mention to get that the crew we're even even CNN admits that it helps
[37:01.440 --> 37:07.400]  working families in this damn good money CNN's John King tax cut bill gives damn
[37:07.400 --> 37:14.200]  good money to work in class CNN host praises bill passed with zero
[37:14.200 --> 37:19.120]  Democrat support wonder how long John King is gonna be there by the way I had
[37:19.120 --> 37:22.040]  that in my stack but I can't find what you guys reprint it for me get the video
[37:22.040 --> 37:29.080]  I'm sure we do but that's that's pretty powerful information because it's 1.5
[37:29.080 --> 37:33.320]  trillion and most of it goes to middle-class and working families the
[37:33.320 --> 37:38.080]  big banks big insurance companies the big portion 100 pay almost no tax they've
[37:38.080 --> 37:48.200]  written the laws to be offshore and Trump annihilated that with a cut from
[37:48.200 --> 37:55.760]  thirty eight point nine percent on corporations to 15 now what you've got
[37:55.760 --> 38:00.880]  to understand ladies and gentlemen why this is such a big deal I know I keep
[38:00.880 --> 38:04.280]  harping I know you know this most of you please tell your friends and family
[38:04.280 --> 38:09.640]  because this is key the UN the globalist all of them are running around
[38:09.640 --> 38:17.880]  saying that oh look Trump's breaking global rules there are no global rules
[38:17.880 --> 38:22.160]  the rules are screw America and the West over transfer power to authoritarian
[38:22.160 --> 38:26.320]  countries where globalists that sold our countries out ally themselves with the
[38:26.320 --> 38:30.520]  other authoritarians it's authoritarian monopoly men and crony capitalist and
[38:30.520 --> 38:34.840]  communist dirtbags against the Renaissance against the real liberals
[38:34.840 --> 38:40.080]  if you really study what it is under classical analysis if Thomas Jefferson
[38:40.080 --> 38:44.240]  was looking at this he'd say those are monopoly groups just like a royal system
[38:44.240 --> 38:49.240]  but worse there's not even any honor nobody has to even take the field in the
[38:49.240 --> 38:56.920]  elite and they are putting us under serfdom anybody that was classically
[38:56.920 --> 39:00.720]  trained would see it two seconds if you're classically educated you got to
[39:00.720 --> 39:06.000]  go back and educate yourself on the classics not the modern baloney
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.240]  intellectuals were too arrogant 300 400 500 years ago to lie they might be
[39:11.240 --> 39:16.040]  distorted in their views but they told you what they thought this whole lying
[39:16.040 --> 39:22.200]  on purpose in media is a newer thing in the last 200 years or so because before
[39:22.200 --> 39:25.520]  200 years ago most people the printing press was 500 but it wasn't ubiquitous
[39:25.520 --> 39:29.960]  until or most people reading until about 200 years ago it was only
[39:29.960 --> 39:33.240]  intellectual intellectual elite to elite so they were all very out in the open
[39:33.240 --> 39:36.880]  and they still do that in globalist publications with each other that like
[39:36.880 --> 39:40.160]  we're idiots would never read it we went read it and brought everybody said look
[39:40.160 --> 39:43.680]  there's they're saying this they're gonna do this oh shut up you racist cook
[39:43.680 --> 39:48.600]  nutball whatever you know just shut up go away but I'm like hey that you found
[39:48.600 --> 39:51.360]  that the public did listen
[39:51.360 --> 39:55.640]  we'll play the McBrain piece when we come back to the next segment I'm already burning
[39:55.640 --> 40:06.520]  through this segment but how long is that piece also I see I have this whole
[40:06.520 --> 40:09.640]  thing where they did this great job on these promos on the other side but then
[40:09.640 --> 40:14.320]  I get a video list that tells me the length but then those videos never get
[40:14.320 --> 40:17.480]  put on the video list with this group so then I don't ever know the only reason
[40:17.480 --> 40:22.080]  I'm staying on air is I've asked about 200 times I'm asking nicely for just an
[40:22.080 --> 40:25.680]  email to be sent or it's a message everybody's doing a great job so that I
[40:25.680 --> 40:28.120]  can then know the length of time so I'm just asking on air because a lot of
[40:28.120 --> 40:30.600]  folks think you know I'm just asking these things on there to pontificate for
[40:30.600 --> 40:34.840]  no reason that just goes into the whole computing process of what to do and I'm
[40:34.840 --> 40:39.560]  kind of teleproport free so what we do is kind of strategize here on air which
[40:39.560 --> 40:43.240]  is not a bad thing just most folks don't do that they this whole dry fake thing
[40:43.240 --> 40:48.280]  you know pointed right at you but here it is we'll cover more when we come back
[40:48.280 --> 40:54.760]  EU fears unfair US tax bill will incentivize companies to move the US move
[40:54.760 --> 41:00.840]  back and they say we're breaking global rules well if China has 14 and a half or
[41:00.840 --> 41:05.680]  whatever it is and then we've got a 38.9 and our own government wrote it that
[41:05.680 --> 41:09.200]  way to make the jobs go to China you wonder why everything went there well
[41:09.200 --> 41:13.000]  they had a tax rate less than half of ours and then you wonder why everybody
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.040]  launder their money through Ireland and move even more jobs there so they had
[41:18.040 --> 41:22.720]  zero remember the big success story Ireland it's incredible and Trump tried
[41:22.720 --> 41:28.880]  to get zero if we had zero corporate income tax everyone would come back here
[41:28.880 --> 41:33.400]  just like it was before we set this whole thing up and we had you 80% of the
[41:33.400 --> 41:38.040]  world's industry by the 80s it was half of it now it's like 20% of it within
[41:38.040 --> 41:43.640]  five years you'd have half the stuff moved back here at real wages and then
[41:43.640 --> 41:47.160]  that would lift the whole world up every economist knows this but they they want
[41:47.160 --> 41:51.480]  a consolidation I know I keep harping and harping and harping and harping it's
[41:51.480 --> 41:55.680]  because this is everything a rigged political and corporate system to screw
[41:55.680 --> 41:59.600]  the average person over make you dependant and put you on welfare so they
[41:59.600 --> 42:03.360]  can run your life and that's the clip that we'll play when we come back start

[47:35.840 --> 47:42.000]  overhaul cuts of Trump that we all just had a huge victory with is quote damn
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.320]  good money the American people and actually is a real middle-class slash
[47:46.320 --> 47:52.120]  poor people tax cut that is basically JFK ask classic Democrats before they
[47:52.120 --> 47:56.440]  became total you know modern psychopath or classic northern Democrat not
[47:56.440 --> 48:01.240]  southern Democrat we're gonna play that clip in a moment but first Derek bring
[48:01.240 --> 48:06.920]  together this powerful video that has Trump introducing the fact that next up
[48:06.920 --> 48:13.560]  is welfare reform getting folks off of the spoiled rotten brainwashing
[48:13.560 --> 48:19.240]  Democrat plantation here it is I know people they work three jobs and they
[48:19.240 --> 48:23.720]  live next to somebody doesn't work at all and the person who's not working at
[48:23.720 --> 48:28.040]  all and has no intention of working at all is making more money and doing
[48:28.040 --> 48:34.440]  better than the person that's working his and her ass off and it's not gonna
[48:34.440 --> 48:43.200]  happen not gonna happen give me my food stamps do you really want to work or
[48:43.200 --> 48:49.160]  you just you just want to get a free check there's a sign behind you this
[48:49.160 --> 48:52.360]  waverly job center you have any intention of going in to get a job or
[48:52.360 --> 49:09.280]  you're just gonna get the food stamps not looking for a job we call the
[49:09.280 --> 49:13.600]  Department of Children and Families to see what they've been doing to help DCF
[49:13.600 --> 49:18.440]  says Hillsboro kids incorporated has been helping by paying Adams rent even
[49:18.440 --> 49:34.600]  providing her furniture Adam says it isn't enough somebody needs to pay I
[49:34.600 --> 49:44.360]  honestly you don't want to work and I'm not going to can't force me I need my
[49:44.360 --> 49:50.960]  food stamps I need them okay this is not a joke just give me my food stamps so
[49:50.960 --> 49:55.400]  I'm asking for they are not incapacitated in any way or they you know they
[49:55.400 --> 50:00.080]  don't have a mental or physical disability that's documented and or could
[50:00.080 --> 50:04.000]  be observable more counties will join them as federal exemptions to the
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.840]  requirements expire now that unemployment is below 10% for each affected
[50:08.840 --> 50:12.760]  county I felt really bad about being on food stamps for a while they're just for
[50:12.760 --> 50:15.440]  people who really really need it I thought and I'm like living this
[50:15.440 --> 50:21.720]  flippant lifestyle in Francisco well yeah and eventually I just sort of
[50:21.720 --> 50:26.280]  realized that even though I'm 24 like I still have responsibilities I still have
[50:26.280 --> 50:30.320]  like hopes for my future and if I need to be on food stamps make that happen then
[50:30.320 --> 50:46.240]  maybe I do really need it you feel guilty about using your food stamp card
[50:46.240 --> 50:56.800]  when you have $850,000 in the bank no no I don't I'm going by the rules and if
[50:56.800 --> 51:00.720]  they need to change the rules they can change the rules but I don't see I'm
[51:00.720 --> 51:06.080]  doing anything wrong how much do you collect in benefits I give 780 and food
[51:06.080 --> 51:15.880]  stamps $500 in tennis and I get Medicaid and WIC give me my food stamps
[51:15.880 --> 51:27.280]  now for hundreds of years once Rome became an empire they controlled people
[51:27.280 --> 51:30.760]  in the city which was the political control of the whole empire with free
[51:30.760 --> 51:34.800]  handouts and they penalized people that basically produced who were in the
[51:34.800 --> 51:38.800]  middle class got the ultra-rich patricians and you had all the poor
[51:38.800 --> 51:45.760]  people down below that were citizens and then slaves but up beneath that but the
[51:45.760 --> 51:48.960]  same things repeating by design and we have the lbj letters all of it when he's
[51:48.960 --> 51:51.960]  president Sam we're gonna domesticate these people and have these n words
[51:51.960 --> 51:55.960]  vote and Democrat the next hundred years and it is a program against
[51:55.960 --> 51:59.040]  everybody they were particularly successful black folks because they'd
[51:59.040 --> 52:01.840]  been down dropped before they had their own communities were somewhat
[52:01.840 --> 52:04.760]  successful and there was an oh you're gonna help me actually here yeah get
[52:04.760 --> 52:10.720]  father out of the home there's some money we're gonna do this and then it
[52:10.720 --> 52:15.080]  creates just that same spoiled rotten behavior not gonna make me work
[52:15.080 --> 52:19.560]  whatever but you're gonna go vote for policies that raise taxes in the middle
[52:19.560 --> 52:23.800]  class where all these liberals go and vote for big tax increases but suddenly
[52:23.800 --> 52:27.520]  the IRS claims they're behind on some technicality and then an old lady has
[52:27.520 --> 52:31.800]  her house taken as she commits suicide we see these stories all the time see
[52:31.800 --> 52:37.000]  they're taking people's businesses and houses because they're producing and
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.880]  then they claim you didn't pay or they've fallen hard times they get behind or
[52:40.880 --> 52:44.840]  there's all this IRS fraud against people it's been documented like the
[52:44.840 --> 52:48.840]  old Hispanic lady there like a eight top little counter deal for 40 something
[52:48.840 --> 52:52.760]  years and she always deposit the cash every day like 600 700 bucks at the
[52:52.760 --> 52:58.000]  bank it was all registered but they said well we say that structuring and so
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.920]  you're manipulating we're gonna take your was it 80 something thousand dollars
[53:01.920 --> 53:04.960]  she'd saved for her retirement she was gonna pay for herself but see they took
[53:04.960 --> 53:08.600]  it away and then they said oh it's legal we have a wall we can do it you've
[53:08.600 --> 53:15.240]  paid your taxes but it's illegal to make under thousand dollar deposits every
[53:15.240 --> 53:19.040]  day you're like but I do a cash business mainly but also some checks and
[53:19.040 --> 53:22.440]  things I do this and this is how it is and we have credit cards as well we
[53:22.440 --> 53:26.640]  don't care see that's how you do humanize that's how you enslave that's how
[53:26.640 --> 53:31.280]  you control and then this lady it looks like she weighs 400 pounds which is fine
[53:31.280 --> 53:34.440]  but she's getting money of food well you know while people starve in the third
[53:34.440 --> 53:44.360]  world this is what she has to say here it is I honestly don't want to work and
[53:44.360 --> 53:50.160]  I'm not going to can't force me I need my now now notice she's totally in time
[53:50.160 --> 53:54.360]  like a lady that has 12 14 kids whatever it was and she goes look at all these
[53:54.360 --> 53:59.080]  kids somebody's got to take care of them it's totally lost on her but this was
[53:59.080 --> 54:04.120]  done to destroy her a better grandmother was a slickly dressed hard-working lady
[54:04.120 --> 54:08.760]  didn't have a lot of money but had a lot of dignity and look like an executive
[54:08.760 --> 54:14.120]  today and then she's a total rundown just out of her mind slob says somebody
[54:14.120 --> 54:18.480]  take care of my kids and you don't think it's real to understand that's what it's
[54:18.480 --> 54:24.240]  produced and now 47% of the population or more it's almost 50 is like this like
[54:24.240 --> 54:27.600]  Mitt Romney said and the globalists know what they're doing it's a demographic
[54:27.600 --> 54:32.240]  battle of total domesticated slaves that don't know how to do anything or take
[54:32.240 --> 54:36.000]  care of themselves you see when it does it parks they say don't feed the law life
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.800]  does it make some obese lazy and stupid well don't feed the humans because sure
[54:41.800 --> 54:45.160]  if you break your backfall for roof get cancer take care of people that's what
[54:45.160 --> 54:49.440]  welfare is for but not here you don't do anything ever again and there's a black
[54:49.440 --> 54:53.960]  guy here is congressman mr. Scott and he's getting hundreds of billions of
[54:53.960 --> 54:56.800]  investment in black areas and the black leaders are freaking out because they
[54:56.800 --> 55:00.760]  don't want that they want to sit on top of people they control with a democratic
[55:00.760 --> 55:03.680]  party and not see people empowered they're scared to death because if you
[55:03.680 --> 55:08.400]  can free the black people you can free everybody the blacks are their target the
[55:08.400 --> 55:11.720]  group they already had control of everything you see done to them is a
[55:11.720 --> 55:17.560]  beta test for everybody else here's a clip of seeing is John King how long will
[55:17.560 --> 55:20.560]  he be there how long will he have a job is he gonna get fired for telling the
[55:20.560 --> 55:23.640]  truth he says it's a real gamble though will Americans want more money and run
[55:23.640 --> 55:26.840]  their own lives will they want to go to a factory will they want to go work at a
[55:26.840 --> 55:30.080]  job and get paid 30 bucks an hour or will they want to sit there and get $10
[55:30.080 --> 55:33.560]  an hour sitting on their butt watching Jerry Springer here it is as you watch
[55:33.560 --> 55:36.560]  this the Republicans are making a big bet they're taking a big risk I can't
[55:36.560 --> 55:39.920]  will over time the American people say oh actually I like having more money in
[55:39.920 --> 55:42.800]  my pocket oh they did hire more people at the factory down the street that's
[55:42.800 --> 55:47.880]  their big bet not one Democrat has voted for a bill that cuts taxes by 1.5
[55:47.880 --> 55:51.320]  trillion dollars to Abby's point you know if you're a working-class family a
[55:51.320 --> 55:54.360]  lot of people say oh it's only $200 oh it's only $300 if you're a working-class
[55:54.360 --> 55:57.800]  family living paycheck to paycheck two hundred three hundred dollars is damn
[55:57.800 --> 56:03.800]  good money and you are grateful for it are the Democrats taking a risk especially
[56:03.800 --> 56:07.240]  those from Trump states it's those ten there's ten Democrats up next year from
[56:07.240 --> 56:12.480]  Trump states is this are they solid here or is this a bet that's the lowest level
[56:12.480 --> 56:15.200]  of people that are at the poverty line and they should be got the Trump wanted
[56:15.200 --> 56:18.680]  it gone but we're talking middle-class two thousand four thousand five thousand
[56:18.680 --> 56:21.640]  dollars a year of the tax credits for kids now you're with that you're up to
[56:21.640 --> 56:25.080]  eight ten thousand add all together somebody making sixty seventy thousand
[56:25.080 --> 56:29.720]  dollars a year is now gonna be paying like five thousand six thousand dollars
[56:29.720 --> 56:32.720]  instead of twenty thousand I mean it's I was looking at the numbers this is huge
[56:32.720 --> 56:37.800]  and it isn't the tax cut that's so good it's that it creates jobs and then it
[56:37.800 --> 56:42.400]  gets the ball rolling just like you've done we're not government finance we're

[59:49.120 --> 1:00:14.120]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:20.280]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the
[1:00:20.280 --> 1:00:26.680]  info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones I've even had media go how do you like it
[1:00:26.680 --> 1:00:29.960]  now that the Liberals are calling themselves the resistances that confuse
[1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:35.160]  people know we're the resistance we're taking back the planet and we're always
[1:00:35.160 --> 1:00:40.600]  gonna be resisting evil in ourselves it's an ongoing battle it never ends it's
[1:00:40.600 --> 1:00:46.680]  the great animating contest of liberty our perfection is our imperfection but
[1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:51.080]  knowing God's perfection we can see into perfection and seeing perfection we
[1:00:51.080 --> 1:00:56.200]  can know it and worship it and be part of it but through us God can experience
[1:00:56.200 --> 1:01:01.880]  imperfection hence we were created expressions of God's mind but autonomous
[1:01:01.880 --> 1:01:08.600]  individuals free not robots sentient conscious sharing the mind of God but in
[1:01:08.600 --> 1:01:13.880]  a tiny microscopic way but still beautiful like the rays of the Sun
[1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:21.440]  through crystal projected on the wall not the Sun but beautiful not the Sun but
[1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:28.640]  part of the Sun and before the media says I'm son worshipping it's an allegory
[1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:35.920]  to the mind of God now let's play a few minutes of Trump announcing the victory
[1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:41.140]  that we should be celebrating greatly because prosperity to Democrats
[1:01:41.140 --> 1:01:46.440]  Communists globalist dirtbags parasites Ernie Sanders scam artists like him
[1:01:46.440 --> 1:01:50.920]  rich filthy five six houses you 100,000 dollar car never worked in his life big
[1:01:50.920 --> 1:01:54.640]  flim flammer at the college big scam artists it's like high noon to count
[1:01:54.640 --> 1:02:01.720]  Dracula so here it is in 34 years but actually really hasn't been done because
[1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:07.560]  we broke every record it's the largest I always say the most massive but it's
[1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:14.520]  the largest tax cut in the history of our country and reform but tax cut really
[1:02:14.520 --> 1:02:20.680]  something special and I noticed this just came out two minutes ago they handed
[1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:26.200]  it to me AT&T plans to increase US capital spending one billion dollars
[1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:33.040]  and provide $1,000 special bonus to more than 200,000 US employees and that's
[1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:37.320]  because the way dozens of companies have now announced some things that's pretty
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:45.200]  good and whole leadership a whole list of accomplishments that the group behind
[1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:50.600]  me have done in terms of this administration and this Congress but
[1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:56.600]  you've heard it before records all over the place and that will continue and
[1:02:56.600 --> 1:03:02.160]  then some because of what we did but three point two trillion dollars just
[1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:06.040]  think of it in tax cuts for American families including doubling the standard
[1:03:06.040 --> 1:03:12.080]  deduction and doubling the child tax credit the typical family of four
[1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:16.480]  earning seventy five thousand dollars we'll see an income tax cut of more than
[1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:21.800]  $2,000 they're gonna have $2,000 and that's in my opinion going to be less
[1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:27.160]  than the average you're gonna have a lot more than that one thing very important
[1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:31.280]  for the farmers the great farmers and the great small business owners that
[1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:36.560]  were forced to sell their businesses at bargain basement numbers we have
[1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:42.120]  provided for the most part estate taxes wiped out so they can keep their farms
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:50.120]  in the family and that to me is a very big factor very big this is going to
[1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:53.600]  mean companies are going to be coming back you know I campaigned on the fact
[1:03:53.600 --> 1:03:57.560]  that we're not gonna lose our companies anymore they're gonna stay in our
[1:03:57.560 --> 1:04:00.880]  country and they're gonna stay in our country and you've been seeing what's
[1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:04.680]  been happening even at this prospect but they stop right there I'm gonna come
[1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:07.200]  back with more the president after breaking up a guest joining us let's
[1:04:07.200 --> 1:04:10.720]  back it up a little bit you know that's the thing my dad we have an old farm
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:13.600]  slash ranch and they get more and more we get sold just to keep the little
[1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:17.520]  piece pieces we've got and then the way they've got it set up you run cattle do
[1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:20.920]  stuff just to pay the taxes and then everybody has to have a couple of the
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:29.040]  jobs on the side and this is all been actuaried in by the big companies and
[1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:35.680]  there's only one group only one group that has higher levels of suicide than
[1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:40.600]  our veterans and that's US farmers we were so close to total shutdown and we
[1:04:40.600 --> 1:04:45.680]  were still in deep trouble but we were fighting back we're conscious now we've
[1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:49.760]  been stabbed quite a bit but our hearts still pumping we're gonna make it and
[1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:54.160]  know we are we're gonna crush these people and they know it

[1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:46.880]  farms in the family and that to me is a very big factor very big
[1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:51.880]  this is this is going to mean companies are going to be coming back you know I
[1:06:51.880 --> 1:06:55.640]  campaigned on the fact that we're not gonna lose our companies anymore they're
[1:06:55.640 --> 1:06:59.680]  gonna stay in our country and they're gonna stay in our country and you've
[1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:03.800]  been seeing what's been happening even at this prospect but they have tremendous
[1:07:03.800 --> 1:07:07.960]  enthusiasm right now in this country and we have companies pouring back into our
[1:07:07.960 --> 1:07:13.040]  country and that means jobs and it means really the formation of new young
[1:07:13.040 --> 1:07:17.600]  beautiful strong companies so that's going to be very very important the
[1:07:17.600 --> 1:07:21.000]  pass-throughs you know all about and the small businesses are going to be big
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:25.600]  beneficiaries we are going to bring at least four trillion dollars back into
[1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:30.320]  this country money that was frozen overseas and in parts and worlds and
[1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:33.880]  some of them don't even like us and they had the money well they're not going to
[1:07:33.880 --> 1:07:41.960]  have the money long and so it's really I guess it's very simple when you think
[1:07:41.960 --> 1:07:48.920]  you haven't heard this expression but we are making America great again you
[1:07:48.920 --> 1:07:56.480]  haven't heard that I want to I want to have them get up and get the glamour
[1:07:56.480 --> 1:08:00.080]  and the glory and I just want to have a few of them come up and they'll speak
[1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:04.280]  for a little while short if they the shorter the better that way we can we
[1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:09.200]  can get all of you we'll get everybody up right but I want to thank Mitch
[1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:16.000]  McConnell I want to thank you what a job what a job and I want to thank Paul
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:20.800]  they're gonna speak they're gonna say a few words but Paul Ryan and Mitch it was
[1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:25.880]  a little team we just got together and we would work very hard didn't we huh it
[1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:30.640]  seems like it was a lot of fun it's always a lot of fun when you win if you
[1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:34.560]  work hard and lose that's not acceptable but I I'm just gonna name a few names and
[1:08:34.560 --> 1:08:39.080]  then some of us we are back live just more of the big historic victory and I
[1:08:39.080 --> 1:08:43.280]  cannot stress upon everybody enough I know you know this but your friends and
[1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:47.560]  family may not the globalist admit in the WikiLeaks and many other documents
[1:08:47.560 --> 1:08:53.200]  many other statements that they've made that they are openly trying to demoralize
[1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:57.760]  the West demoralized free market demoralized renaissance and this tax
[1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:02.160]  bill is far from perfect but it's the biggest in modern history it's as big
[1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:06.320]  as Kennedy tax cuts that by the way double tax receipts in one year and you
[1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:10.880]  ask well why don't Democrats want that they want control and they admit it so
[1:09:10.880 --> 1:09:16.000]  this is a big victory the worm is turning in my view it'll be so hard for
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:19.920]  the nasty Mueller and his whole fake thing to try to bring Trump down now
[1:09:19.920 --> 1:09:23.600]  even with the Christmas indictment of Kushner that was supposedly gonna happen
[1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:27.160]  a few days before we have that on good sources they may back off on that now
[1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:30.560]  Mueller saying maybe a year out hoping you forget about the criminality of
[1:09:30.560 --> 1:09:34.760]  their investigation now the EU's come out and said this is gonna flood jobs back
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:38.520]  in the US you're supposed to match taxes with us under these secret agreements
[1:09:38.520 --> 1:09:41.840]  I mean that's in the Associated Press that we're breaking global government
[1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:46.040]  rules yeah that screwed us over I mean we might have got sucked into your rule
[1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:49.200]  government it was some great deal then later you could have took over but you
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:53.080]  made it a screw job from the beginning you want to tell us who runs the TPP and
[1:09:53.080 --> 1:09:57.240]  all this oh Trump killed that too so I could be critical of Trump on quite a
[1:09:57.240 --> 1:10:01.680]  few things but frankly I couldn't do what he's done and the global movement that
[1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:05.560]  all of you are leading that Matt drudge is leading I mean I can't thank
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:10.680]  everybody in the independent real press but now having talk show hosts you know
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:15.200]  John King on CNN say this is a great deal for people this is really historic
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:19.320]  1.5 trillion getting rid of the cutting way back the estate tax bringing back
[1:10:19.320 --> 1:10:22.240]  the corporate money that this is a big deal and I couldn't think of a better
[1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:27.160]  person in the aftermath of this victory the consummate libertarian talk show
[1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:32.240]  host expert a businessman father a patriot Stefan Malinu needs no
[1:10:32.240 --> 1:10:37.440]  introduction youtube forward slash free domain radio Twitter Stefan Malinu a
[1:10:37.440 --> 1:10:41.880]  free domain radio calm you get is a book the art of the argument that's
[1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:47.440]  excellent by the way so he joins us now to give us his look at this and how he
[1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:50.200]  thinks they're gonna counter strike or maybe maybe he disagrees maybe this isn't
[1:10:50.200 --> 1:10:54.960]  that huge of a victory Stefan Malinu thanks for coming on with us sir thanks
[1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:58.960]  Alex great to be here Merry Christmas to you your family and your great
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:03.640]  listenership I really appreciate the time to chat today back at you it is a
[1:11:03.640 --> 1:11:06.760]  great victory it is a great victory because it does a whole number of things
[1:11:06.760 --> 1:11:11.280]  number one it puts money back into the hands of the American worker which of
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:14.120]  course is a great thing you get to keep more of your own money and some of that
[1:11:14.120 --> 1:11:18.440]  is direct in terms of the tax cuts themselves but another is that by
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:22.080]  lowering corporate tax rates corporations have more money to invest in
[1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:26.360]  upgrades to to pay their workers more so it is a wonderful Christmas present for
[1:11:26.360 --> 1:11:30.520]  the American worker that's a great thing the other great thing is it reveals the
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:33.560]  Democrat Party to be basically a combination of the Grinch and a bond
[1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:37.920]  villain I mean it's weird when you think about it oh no American workers are
[1:11:37.920 --> 1:11:42.120]  getting more money around Christmas time that's the worst thing in the world and
[1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:48.960]  it's like what terrible up you're a bad one they work with this 34 years since
[1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:52.440]  we've had a real tax cut for the middle class and workers while we've been
[1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:55.680]  deindustrialized which they admits a plan I mean why do you think the EU's so
[1:11:55.680 --> 1:12:00.640]  dumb they're openly bitching saying you're gonna get the jobs now well of
[1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:04.200]  course the EU doesn't want to have to restrain their own socialist spending so
[1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:07.600]  of course they would love a deal where everyone keeps their corporate tax rates
[1:12:07.600 --> 1:12:11.640]  high and keeps their tax rates high the EU is also being revealed this season as
[1:12:11.640 --> 1:12:16.320]  well for sanctioning working on massive sanctions against Poland while paying
[1:12:16.320 --> 1:12:21.480]  billions of euros to Turkey of all places Poland that the West fought to
[1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:25.520]  try and free and failed in the Second World War who fought valiantly against
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:30.480]  both Nazism and communism are being sanctioned while Turkey of all places
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:37.560]  is being rewarded with billions of euros with billions and fines a hundred
[1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:42.480]  thousand euros explain that to people per illegal that's come in military age
[1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:46.280]  man the raping the killing going on the welfare they're giving them throwing
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:49.560]  pensioners out of their sectionated housing putting them in I mean this is a
[1:12:49.560 --> 1:12:56.760]  crazy plan well of course they hate the fact that Poland is a Christian nation
[1:12:56.760 --> 1:13:01.080]  they hate the fact that Poland is a proud nation and they hate the fact that
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:05.560]  Polish people having been subjugated and controlled for a significant portion of
[1:13:05.560 --> 1:13:09.960]  their history either as Poland or the pre-Poland countries subjugated by
[1:13:09.960 --> 1:13:16.440]  Islam subjugated by communism the fact that they fought so hard to be free that
[1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:19.800]  they value and treasure their freedom and are willing to stand up against the
[1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:23.040]  corrupt tyranny of the EU is something that simply cannot be allowed to stand
[1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:26.920]  I mean Turkey is working nicely with the EU but Poland wishes to remain in
[1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:31.400]  sovereign country and to resist mass immigration from the Third World and so
[1:13:31.400 --> 1:13:36.240]  naturally of course they are fighting it tooth and nail and they also don't want
[1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:40.160]  they don't want the example you know one prisoner walks through a fence that
[1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:43.520]  everyone thinks is locked the other prisoners not getting ideas they can't
[1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:47.360]  have one example of a country with borders they can't have one example of
[1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:50.480]  a country with an in-group preference and they sure as hell can't have a
[1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:56.520]  country where Christianity stands against foreign religions one I'm
[1:13:56.520 --> 1:14:01.320]  concerned about though is the wild-eyed insanity Stefan Malinu where they've
[1:14:01.320 --> 1:14:04.440]  gone from laughing at me yelling in the street to like trying to attack me now
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:08.880]  they're getting more and more desperate and Rosie O'Donnell trying to make bribes
[1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:13.320]  on on Twitter saying I'm serious a million dollars two million for senators
[1:14:13.320 --> 1:14:17.720]  that vote against it and then and like saying go let's go kill congressmen I
[1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:21.840]  mean they're getting they're going into complete insane asylum land and I'm not
[1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:25.360]  scared of them like they're gonna beat us I'm just worried about their mental
[1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:31.080]  illness I mean clearly what is wrong with them they are addicted to power and
[1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:36.400]  they are representing an entire community in in America this is tens
[1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:41.880]  possibly even a hundred million or more people who probably feel genuinely
[1:14:41.880 --> 1:14:45.120]  having been dependent on the state for generations and I'm not just talking
[1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:48.680]  about the poor we also talk about the military industrial complex and all the
[1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:52.600]  people who benefit from the state's awesome power to create and redistribute
[1:14:52.600 --> 1:14:56.400]  trillions of dollars in the economy that has created a market of people dependent
[1:14:56.400 --> 1:15:00.720]  upon state power dependent upon the coercive nature of the state apparatus
[1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:04.040]  and when someone like Donald Trump comes along and says we're gonna make the
[1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:07.240]  state smaller we're gonna put more people in the free market we're gonna put
[1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:10.840]  more people in the tax-paying private sector and out of the government
[1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:14.960]  dependent public sector they panic and they freak out because they view the
[1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:19.000]  government as the sole source of their survival they do not they no longer have
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:22.960]  the self-esteem to believe that they can survive without welfare exactly we
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:25.160]  gotta go to break Stefan Mullin who stayed right there cuz I'm gonna talk
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:28.520]  about this because literally they're the ones that always been robbing us and
[1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:31.240]  feeding on us and trying to dumb us down to be better servants in
[1:15:31.240 --> 1:15:35.640]  domesticated and then we're finally struggling back cuz you know half our
[1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:38.360]  wealth isn't enough for them and they think we're killing them because they
[1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:41.400]  act like we're killing them meanwhile we're bringing all this wealth back I'm
[1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:44.280]  gonna help them that's what created all the wealth idiots was a little bit of
[1:15:44.280 --> 1:15:48.800]  free market we just get out of the way and let the adults give you freedom like
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:53.920]  God you morons but sees they crave the power to control people it's worse than

[1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:39.560]  it Ted Malik joining us again he's finally ready to talk about Luciferian
[1:20:39.560 --> 1:20:45.560] ism and Satanism in the elite he himself has you know degrees not just in
[1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:51.520]  economics the rest of it but also in theology and in the study of religions
[1:20:51.520 --> 1:20:55.880]  and it's rampant in the globalist but again whether you believe the devil or
[1:20:55.880 --> 1:21:01.480]  not it's an operating system a spirit an attitude like pirates are you know catch
[1:21:01.480 --> 1:21:04.640]  their hair on fire and you'll have skull and crossbones saying if you don't give
[1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:07.400]  up we'll kill you there's blood dripping out of the skull on the flag it means
[1:21:07.400 --> 1:21:11.360]  we'll kill you anyways so it's it's kind of an idea of we're gonna hurt
[1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:14.400]  everybody we're gonna steal from everybody we're gonna invert reality
[1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:17.400]  we're gonna be corrupt anybody who isn't into that you finally run into people
[1:21:17.400 --> 1:21:22.080]  that are like that you're just blown away that they get off on blowing systems
[1:21:22.080 --> 1:21:27.720]  up controlling people dumb people down they get off on it and free market is a
[1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:32.240]  system that allows you to make choices through the market and generally the
[1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:37.920]  will of the people in a real market is the best system but you see BuzzFeed
[1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:46.760]  editor saying I want total communism for Christmas okay so again living here in
[1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:49.920]  a quasi-free system much better than North Korea they're making these
[1:21:49.920 --> 1:21:54.200]  statements and Stefan also wanted to get into Christmas because in my view if
[1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:58.080]  you're able to say two plus two equals four that's freedom quoting George
[1:21:58.080 --> 1:22:02.600]  Arwell well if you can say Christmas it's freedom and it sounds silly but they
[1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:06.280]  really want to erase everything whether it was perfect or bad or good or
[1:22:06.280 --> 1:22:10.320]  indifferent because they want to force you to accept their new system so that's
[1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:14.760]  why they they go after Christian culture particularly I don't mean the fake
[1:22:14.760 --> 1:22:17.960]  churches and all the corrupt things that are involved with those but I mean the
[1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:23.800]  actual idea of that and then they make fun of you know that and want to destroy
[1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:28.560]  it so Stefan Malinu why you know just as a researcher looking at like an
[1:22:28.560 --> 1:22:33.640]  anthropologist or sociologist why do they want to attack Christmas and why
[1:22:33.640 --> 1:22:37.560]  are they going after it so much in this culture war and how are they doing in
[1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:40.840]  the culture war and that feeds back into what we hit at the break what are they
[1:22:40.840 --> 1:22:44.400]  gonna do as this all caves in most of them weren't even part of the power
[1:22:44.400 --> 1:22:48.520]  structure but they were living through it feeling like they were running things
[1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:53.760]  culturally and we're gonna excoriate and control and reeducate those of us
[1:22:53.760 --> 1:22:57.960]  liberal conservative libertarian agnostic that didn't fit into their
[1:22:57.960 --> 1:23:03.080]  little box I mean really they're a cult of bullies well there are those and this
[1:23:03.080 --> 1:23:06.280]  is I think very appropriate to Christmas time Alex there are those in the world
[1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:11.160]  who want to do good to be virtuous and that is individual action that is going
[1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:14.920]  to help the poor that is going to bring food to people that's going to work in
[1:23:14.920 --> 1:23:18.200]  soup kitchens it's going to speak to someone who's down and raise up their
[1:23:18.200 --> 1:23:22.960]  spirits or if you want workers to to make more money then it's about starting
[1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:26.160]  a business and hiring people and paying them well or if you want people to get
[1:23:26.160 --> 1:23:29.040]  free health care then it's about donating to a hospital or church or
[1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:33.960]  becoming a doctor and working pro bono from time to time so there's individual
[1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:37.480]  action which gives you the satisfaction of having done good in the world but
[1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:41.560]  there's people who just want to feel good without actually expending the time
[1:23:41.560 --> 1:23:44.400]  energy and resources to do good themselves and those are the people who
[1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:48.520]  want to change the system or the structure or the state or the law in
[1:23:48.520 --> 1:23:53.320]  order to remove negative stimuli from them poor people sick people but they
[1:23:53.320 --> 1:23:56.600]  don't actually want to go out and do good individually that's too much work
[1:23:56.600 --> 1:24:00.480]  they want to get all of the benefits of doing good by advocating for a system
[1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:04.800]  that's usually coercive in nature and thus as literally is said the road to
[1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:09.720]  hell is paved with good intentions I could I've never heard it said better
[1:24:09.720 --> 1:24:14.160]  that I mean that's it and so you pointed out the groups out there that just
[1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:16.200]  think hey I'm gonna be thrown on the street and they don't know any better
[1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:21.840]  and that's that's kind of the folks in the bottom of the room but in the last
[1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:26.520]  decade or so more and more of that pyramidal structure actually thinks
[1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:30.320]  they're part of the elite and have been taught kind of the upper crust anti
[1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:36.280]  liberty anti-human authoritarianism and so they've the left in its modern sense
[1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:40.560]  has I believe converted to a crazy form of authoritarianism do you agree with
[1:24:40.560 --> 1:24:46.600]  that and if so why I think it's the devil's temptation right the devil
[1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:50.520]  takes Jesus to a mountaintop in the desert and shows in the whole world
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:55.000]  and says all of this can be yours if you follow me and this Darwinian thirst
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:59.400]  for material power for material resources it's a merely about gene
[1:24:59.400 --> 1:25:03.640]  reproduction for the most part we are we are driven to seek resources to ensure
[1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:07.460]  the survival of our offspring and if you take away Christian ethics or
[1:25:07.460 --> 1:25:12.240]  philosophical ethics or virtues that surmount and surpass and restrain the
[1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:15.560]  mere Nietzschean Darwinian will for power it's a government for control of
[1:25:15.560 --> 1:25:20.560]  resources society falls apart society is a common code of self-restraint and in
[1:25:20.560 --> 1:25:24.360]  under Darwinism there is no self-restraint you get as many resources by
[1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:28.200]  whatever means necessary as possible you have just crystallized it and the
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:31.920]  globalist endorsed that they say we're social Darwinist explain what that means
[1:25:31.920 --> 1:25:38.360]  to people well social Darwinism to some degree is I think allowing for the state
[1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:41.560]  to favor particular groups what one of the things that's happened that's been
[1:25:41.560 --> 1:25:46.080]  really really tragic is the growth of the single mom industry so to speak where
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:50.920]  you have this breakdown in marriage you have easy divorces you have alimony you
[1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:54.920]  have child support and you have the state stepping in for irresponsible women
[1:25:54.920 --> 1:25:58.280]  who have children and then they lionized it they were not attacking single woman
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:02.840]  but then they lionized it they set it up well it used to be the case of course
[1:26:02.840 --> 1:26:05.520]  that if you were a single mom your parents would end up having to pay to
[1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:09.040]  raise your child so your parents had a very strong incentive to restrain the
[1:26:09.040 --> 1:26:13.200]  wild tsunami like hormones of teenage sexuality with the welfare state taking
[1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:16.720]  away the negative consequences of irresponsible sexuality it's the old
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:19.720]  Chesterton quote says when you get rid of the big laws you don't end up with no
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:23.560]  laws you end up with an infinity of tiny laws and now we have all of this crazy
[1:26:23.560 --> 1:26:27.400]  breakdown in sexual morality which is causing massive amounts of predation
[1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:31.560]  and massive amounts of single motherhood and so this is the welfare state takes
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:35.520]  resources from more responsible people and gives it to less responsible people
[1:26:35.520 --> 1:26:39.120]  thus encouraging the reproduction of less responsible people personality is
[1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:42.560]  largely genetic and therefore you have social engineering you have a kind of
[1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:46.960]  dysgenics operating at a social level through the welfare state and it is
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:55.160]  exactly the genesis claimed they were going to clean all that up but instead they made it 50 times worse yeah the government should not be
[1:26:55.160 --> 1:26:59.120]  involved in providing resources for reproduction that is eugenics at a
[1:26:59.120 --> 1:27:03.360]  fundamental level whether you have eugenics on a race or class-based level
[1:27:03.360 --> 1:27:07.480]  is wrong to take resources from one group and give it to another group because
[1:27:07.480 --> 1:27:12.040]  it's fundamentally messing with the DNA of the species usually to extraordinarily
[1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:15.120]  terrible effect well we've seen that I don't know if you've seen the compilation
[1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:18.760]  of videos we might play it again where people go I got 12 kids you somebody
[1:27:18.760 --> 1:27:22.800]  better take care of them it's not enough to get $10,000 a month free housing and
[1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:26.600]  free furniture and everything I'm gonna sit here on my butt squirting kids out
[1:27:26.600 --> 1:27:32.120]  and you're gonna pay for it oh and it's terrible and children when children are
[1:27:32.120 --> 1:27:37.040]  an expense society gets more responsible because responsible people have to pay
[1:27:37.040 --> 1:27:40.920]  for those expenses and women choose the best provider in a free market the best
[1:27:40.920 --> 1:27:44.080]  provider tends to be the smartest the most resourceful the most intelligent
[1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:49.080]  the most wise the most mature and so you end up with a positive eugenics in the
[1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:52.800]  free market where smarter people end up with more resources more free market is
[1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:57.880]  the only humane true eugenics it is absolutely and when you end up with the
[1:27:57.880 --> 1:28:02.640]  system where children become an asset rather than a liability then what happens
[1:28:02.640 --> 1:28:06.520]  is people have children in order to make money and that means they don't have to
[1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:10.280]  have anybody responsible sticking around and of course the whole welfare state
[1:28:10.280 --> 1:28:13.560]  thing where they say you only get welfare if there's no man in the house
[1:28:13.560 --> 1:28:19.080]  they are paying women to have children and keep fatherhood at bay to keep
[1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:22.360]  fathers away they gotta go to break when come back I gotta ask you I mean they
[1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:26.360]  admit they're doing about design just to have control but don't they see what it
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:30.440]  ends up in it literally ends in idiocracy and in idiocracy isn't coming in

[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:09.560]  January and I bet on dr. group's butt about this because it's got a much
[1:34:09.560 --> 1:34:13.680]  proprietary products in it that are so hard to get that it's been sold out for
[1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:18.640]  over six months and this would be the best seller we ever had if we could keep
[1:34:18.640 --> 1:34:22.640]  it in but to have try to have it at California standards and all the rest of
[1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:25.960]  it's impossible with these ingredients because you know kale has 20 times the
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:30.840]  lead that that you know that this has but that's a food so California lets you
[1:34:30.840 --> 1:34:35.400]  have it so we have to put stickers on this for California because it doesn't
[1:34:35.400 --> 1:34:39.680]  pass that California standard prop 65 they put in 20 years ago you know where
[1:34:39.680 --> 1:34:43.120]  that the buildings say this building's toxic even it's brand new and the cars
[1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:47.880]  they sell there have big stickers this is toxic and it's just insane so this
[1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:54.520]  has I think like a third as much lead in it as kale does but it's got herbs in it
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:34:58.080]  that have naturally occurring lead in it so that we tried to even source it
[1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:00.840]  where we could have it without it and have it pass California standards that by
[1:35:00.840 --> 1:35:03.760]  the way you got a whole foods at 90% of it says does not pass California
[1:35:03.760 --> 1:35:08.360]  standards because nobody can okay but again I just said forget it we're not
[1:35:08.360 --> 1:35:11.160]  doing it we're putting the we're putting the sticker on it okay doesn't pass
[1:35:11.160 --> 1:35:15.800]  stupid California baloney standards where the lawyers pass that law the air
[1:35:15.800 --> 1:35:20.760]  has more lead in it okay I mean it's unbelievable the point is is that it's
[1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:24.520]  amazing and it goes in we're not just put on a formula saying this knocks out
[1:35:24.520 --> 1:35:27.880]  yeast and candida and then put anything out and then there was a problem we just
[1:35:27.880 --> 1:35:32.040]  changed it this is the formula that works taking a six plus months to even get
[1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:36.120]  it back in stock and people it has five star reviews it's insane and if you
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:39.320]  think just probiotics are good to just place the bad bacteria because all the
[1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:42.920]  pesticides in the food kill the good bacteria and then you take good
[1:35:42.920 --> 1:35:45.640]  bacteria so that you can replace it that's a good thing to do we have
[1:35:45.640 --> 1:35:49.920]  fluorolife and carnivore enzyme they're all excellent 50 billion live enzymes
[1:35:49.920 --> 1:35:54.240]  you name it it's I mean 50 billion live live cultures it's all there but Myco

[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:10.160]  let's be clear we're not victims so we'll tell you in full wars has grown
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:13.800]  usually 30 40% a year we've tripled the last year
[1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:18.240]  everybody knows we're under total attack and they have just cut off millions in
[1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:22.760]  sponsorship destroyed things I mean they've had black ops disinfo teams then
[1:38:22.760 --> 1:38:25.760]  we got it's it's it's I'm not whining it's actually quite entertaining and
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:28.400]  enjoyable and makes my life exciting I'm seriously I'm not just saying that
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:32.960]  that's kind of sad for my family but that's you know I trust in God but they
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:36.080]  hate the fact that you're direct funding as they're trying to shut that off it's
[1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:39.160]  so Stefan's like yeah you know we're growing 20% every year they've been
[1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:42.400]  after him too so he's not gonna whine about it he's saying hey we're growing
[1:38:42.400 --> 1:38:46.600]  despite the attacks we would have completely taken the culture back if
[1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:50.760]  if if they weren't fighting back just know this a war is happening it's
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:54.840]  critical to your own interest to know we're not funded by George Soros and
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:38:59.160]  globalist we're funded by you so we are your fist and we are taking action
[1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:03.600]  Stefan well let's sort of take a little bit of an example here just to talk
[1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:06.160]  about the financial benefit to the listeners because you know cold hard
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:11.640]  cash runs the world and numbers don't lie so your channel and my channel were
[1:39:11.640 --> 1:39:16.400]  very very interested in Donald Trump and although he is a man with laws and we
[1:39:16.400 --> 1:39:21.160]  paid I've paid for it with $70,000 a month now it's like 5,000 that's how
[1:39:21.160 --> 1:39:27.960]  we paid well I've paid so I did a lot of shows reaching millions of people
[1:39:27.960 --> 1:39:30.880]  about the lies that were being told about Donald Trump because for me it was a
[1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:34.520]  two-fer it was help get people to the truth about Trump and his agenda and
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:37.480]  also show just how much the mainstream media lies how do you know they're
[1:39:37.480 --> 1:39:42.320]  lying they're broadcast how much did you pay for tell the truth well it was a
[1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:46.280]  bit of a challenge let's put it that way at times but look I mean just look at
[1:39:46.280 --> 1:39:50.640]  so Donald Trump got in and now the biggest tax cut in US history has just
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:54.120]  been passed which puts lots of money back into the hands of our listeners so
[1:39:54.120 --> 1:39:58.400]  if you've helped support at the show 20 bucks a month 50 bucks a month 5 bucks a
[1:39:58.400 --> 1:40:01.600]  month whatever bought some stuff from your store bought my book help support
[1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:05.240]  things I think it's kind of paid off just in terms of you may be getting
[1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:09.720]  thousand explain we went from mandate we went from 70,000 a month when they
[1:40:09.720 --> 1:40:15.240]  delisted us and went like 95% demonetized to again like seven to ten
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:17.840]  thousand a month I mean I'm not whining I want people to know this is what
[1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:21.840]  YouTube did to us and admittedly to punish us so I'm not saying hey look at
[1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:24.960]  me I'm just telling listeners thank God you're there we'd be gone because
[1:40:24.960 --> 1:40:29.760]  listeners filled in that gap you want to find the people who are being opposed
[1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:33.480]  the most because the people who are being opposed the most are doing the most
[1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:36.840]  you know if you're in a war and you're marching in the wrong direction you're
[1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:39.760]  really not going to reach any opposition nobody's going to be fighting you in
[1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:43.480]  fact the other the team the other army the enemy are very happy that you're
[1:40:43.480 --> 1:40:46.320]  marching in the wrong direction it's when you march in the right direction I
[1:40:46.320 --> 1:40:49.880]  guess Wonder Woman style that you run into the blistering fire so look at the
[1:40:49.880 --> 1:40:53.200]  people who've got the most smoking craters around them and give them some
[1:40:53.200 --> 1:40:57.400]  ammo gosh you just it's true and it's not that I'm even whining I want folks to
[1:40:57.400 --> 1:41:00.760]  know like like I'm a heat-seeking missile that goes towards their fire like the
[1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:04.560]  World War two analogy of they didn't have a radar or satellite then they went
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:07.600]  towards the flag because they would shoot you know wherever the factories
[1:41:07.600 --> 1:41:11.600]  were and it's the same thing we're we're steering into it we just want folks to
[1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:14.960]  know exactly as you said whoever's being attacked the most is the key to
[1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:21.440]  spread there is no substitute for and it's a great kind of radar because when
[1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:24.400]  you look at the people who are being attacked the most and listen there are
[1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:27.880]  people who are wrong and it depends how you're being attacked if you put it like
[1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:31.180]  if I put out an argument that has some incorrect data or I've made a reasoning
[1:41:31.180 --> 1:41:36.000]  error fantastic you know people will tell me that but instead it's racist you
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:41.320]  have it they're not attacking us on what we did right and if they go after you at
[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:46.680]  this hysterical venomous puff adder viper strikes personal level yeah he's a
[1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:50.680]  this he's a that and it just tries to bury you in negative adjectives that
[1:41:50.680 --> 1:41:54.280]  means you're doing something right and so when people are being attacked libeled
[1:41:54.280 --> 1:41:58.560]  slandered lied about and so on that's when you really want to pay them
[1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:03.160]  attention because they're not fools the enemies are not fools they know who's
[1:42:03.160 --> 1:42:06.640]  having the most impact and they also know when the person having the most
[1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:10.040]  impact has good reason and evidence behind them because if you've got bad
[1:42:10.040 --> 1:42:15.040]  reason and evidence you just say oh the data is contradict exactly we have their
[1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:20.440]  number we know their program and we're winning that's why they hate us and they
[1:42:20.440 --> 1:42:24.600]  have openly told they've openly told everyone through the solar linsky book
[1:42:24.600 --> 1:42:28.320]  rules for radicals and a lot of other publications they've openly said we just
[1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:32.280]  want power we just want control we don't have any values we don't have any
[1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:35.680]  ethics we don't have any standards but we know our enemies do and we're dying to
[1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:39.760]  use them against them yes all of us he said I worship Lucifer I pledge myself

[1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:41.000]  got paid by the FBI to put it out hedges on linking Trump to Russia now in
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:45.440]  court documents he says he can't I mean it has imploded okay and then the
[1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:48.520]  crimes but that's a secondary thing the big one is I haven't mentioned yet
[1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:52.320]  today is 19 people injured his car deliberately hits pedestrians in
[1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:56.600]  Melbourne you know for every car attack one out of a hundred might be somebody
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:48:01.280]  else but it's always Islamists the other times and I noticed that CNN didn't
[1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:04.680]  say it was Islamists even though he pledged leads to ISIS they said he was
[1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:11.120]  mentally ill mental health issues Muslim who ramped 18 people with car has no
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:15.320]  link to terror because they say and now they're saying the guy that attacked
[1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:19.120]  New York was mentally ill well of course they're mentally ill but they're being
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:25.040]  directed by by a monotheistic death call that the left bizarrely is sided with
[1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:29.200]  because this is our guest just a certain amount earlier it's this whole
[1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:36.080]  solowansky a power what's crazy is you read the elite books of Karl Marx and
[1:48:36.080 --> 1:48:41.320]  and and Vi Lenin and all these people they they say we love Lucifer but Lenin
[1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:44.680]  was a devil worshipper it doesn't mean he's even believes in the devil he is
[1:48:44.680 --> 1:48:49.080]  the devil you know it's kind of like a lot of the top Google people say I don't
[1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:54.120]  believe in God yet I'm gonna be one Kurzweil so it's megalomania is what
[1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:58.080]  it is and it's the same craziness so so I said hey whatever topic you want to
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:01.520]  cover but I'm just throwing this out because the Europeans have come out a
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:06.760]  new poll saying immigration terrorism's biggest issue what 40% said while
[1:49:06.760 --> 1:49:12.360]  they're being oppressed and told if you report what color somebody is will arrest
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:17.120]  you and then we're not joking this is this is like naked crazy authoritarian
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:22.000]  ism I hope this is the last desperate gasp of the authoritarian left but you
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  know even though we're getting a few beach heads here I don't think we're out
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:32.760]  of the woods yet stuff I'm on him it's horrible and tragic and I'm kind of torn
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:37.320]  I tell you straight up Alex I'm really ambivalent about this I do want the
[1:49:37.320 --> 1:49:41.600]  mainstream media to reform themselves and I kind of don't you know that old
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:45.120]  saying never interrupt your enemy when he's in the process of making one giant
[1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:50.160]  mistake after another the fact that they are so doubling down on avoiding basic
[1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:55.560]  issues like demographics like IQ like belief systems like compatibility like
[1:49:55.560 --> 1:49:59.720]  welfare usage like crime statistics the fact that they're so steadfastly
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:03.560]  covering their eyes sticking their heads in the sand and screaming la la la la
[1:50:03.560 --> 1:50:07.440]  like a half upside down ostrich is creating massive market opportunities
[1:50:07.440 --> 1:50:10.920]  for us if they reform themselves and if they start telling basic truths about
[1:50:10.920 --> 1:50:14.880]  the world people will start tuning into them rather than us so it's not like I
[1:50:14.880 --> 1:50:18.160]  just want people to watch me if they really reformed themselves I'd be happy
[1:50:18.160 --> 1:50:21.240]  to have fewer audiences because that would mean more truth would be getting
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:25.840]  exactly I don't think this plague of crazies that's all I want but the left
[1:50:25.840 --> 1:50:30.520]  is one more standard in the world yeah I just now the fact that they are
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:34.240]  literally delusional I mean of course they're talking about mental illness
[1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:40.040]  because leftism is a mental illness it is a steadfast denial of basic biological
[1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:44.640]  empirical reality it is a denial of universal moral values like thou shalt
[1:50:44.640 --> 1:50:49.560]  not steal thou shalt not kill thou shalt not thirst for demonic power over
[1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:54.640]  thy fellow bipeds it is a denial of reality it is a denial of virtue it is
[1:50:54.640 --> 1:50:59.360]  a denial of compassion and it arises from a childhood written empathetic grave
[1:50:59.360 --> 1:51:03.800]  of maltreatment and so it is of course they say that these people are mentally
[1:51:03.800 --> 1:51:10.000]  ill because they're mentally ill expanding on that Russia gate whether
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:13.140]  topics I got hundreds but I want to hear what what's front and center on on
[1:51:13.140 --> 1:51:16.960]  stuff I'm on his brain well I want to think about Christmas just a little bit
[1:51:16.960 --> 1:51:20.000]  because you know we spent a lot of time fighting the forces of darkness and it
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:25.480]  is important excuse me to love and remember to turn towards the light so if
[1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:29.760]  you've had a year of combat I suggest you rest and enjoy your time of a
[1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:33.720]  Christmas it's funny you say that because I never rest and I'm committed for next
[1:51:33.720 --> 1:51:36.960]  year I apologize erupting it's just too I've committed actually taken off next
[1:51:36.960 --> 1:51:42.520]  week sorry go ahead well so if you fought the good fight rest enjoy and get
[1:51:42.520 --> 1:51:47.840]  ready for next year if you haven't then rest anyway and gear up to commit to
[1:51:47.840 --> 1:51:52.200]  next year which is going to be one hell of a year to be fighting well that's my
[1:51:52.200 --> 1:51:56.480]  next question for you that's why we're mind melded yes this was the most
[1:51:56.480 --> 1:51:59.400]  insane year in my life everybody else says it was good the bad thing I believe
[1:51:59.400 --> 1:52:06.440]  was incredible year of change what is 2018 well 2018 is the rack and rock of
[1:52:06.440 --> 1:52:11.320]  freedom 2018 is the final battle I think because either there's going to be a
[1:52:11.320 --> 1:52:15.080]  tipping point where people start to go towards the truth tellers and those who
[1:52:15.080 --> 1:52:19.080]  have virtue compassion empathy and goodness in their heart or they're
[1:52:19.080 --> 1:52:24.720]  going to slide down to the satanic pit of the surface and the liars we have to
[1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:28.160]  upper game we who are out there in the public sphere telling the truth we have
[1:52:28.160 --> 1:52:32.520]  to be more engaging more entertaining more enjoyable we have to use every
[1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:36.920]  trick in the book to pull people towards the giant geyser light of freedom
[1:52:36.920 --> 1:52:42.240]  that we pursue and represent we have to upper game and not just stare at the
[1:52:42.240 --> 1:52:46.200]  demons in hatred but stare at the light and the virtues enjoy because there's
[1:52:46.200 --> 1:52:48.720]  only a certain amount of opposition that's going to attract people we have
[1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:51.960]  to show people what we love as well as what we hate like the old thing about
[1:52:51.960 --> 1:52:55.040]  the soldier the soldier doesn't fight because he hates what's in front of him
[1:52:55.040 --> 1:52:58.680]  he fights because he loves what he's protecting he loves what's behind him so
[1:52:58.680 --> 1:53:03.320]  we have to remember to share the love of freedom the love of free of free markets
[1:53:03.320 --> 1:53:07.040]  the love of free speech the love of gun ownership we have to remember to share
[1:53:07.040 --> 1:53:12.040]  what we love in order to attract people to our course and not just simply as the
[1:53:12.040 --> 1:53:15.480]  old saying that Nietzsche has said if you hunt monsters your own your whole
[1:53:15.480 --> 1:53:21.040]  life you have to be very careful you do not turn into one total veritas you know
[1:53:21.040 --> 1:53:23.280]  I woke up at 3 30 in the morning and I couldn't go back to sleep and I wrote
[1:53:23.280 --> 1:53:26.480]  a bunch of notes and I forgot to bring him a course that was one of them was
[1:53:26.480 --> 1:53:31.840]  that just celebrate and just turn loose and appreciate kind of a Zen moment all
[1:53:31.840 --> 1:53:36.940]  that is good and magnify that and think about the good instead of hating the
[1:53:36.940 --> 1:53:40.600]  evil so much that I tend to do and there's a place for that but I had that
[1:53:40.600 --> 1:53:44.480]  and I'd never really experienced this much in my life but now that I had the
[1:53:44.480 --> 1:53:48.240]  feeling of all there was like kind of like not turning loose but feeling the
[1:53:48.240 --> 1:53:54.520]  source and like like resting back into it it I mean this really is metaphysical
[1:53:54.520 --> 1:53:59.040]  hermetic we I mean we know all this and that's why that's why I know next year
[1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:03.280]  is the battle of the gods you know as you just said the good or dumb are wrong
[1:54:03.280 --> 1:54:06.760]  because of course things repeat themselves I'm saying the final battle
[1:54:06.760 --> 1:54:11.160]  the gods but but a model of that because they're gonna throw everything and for
[1:54:11.160 --> 1:54:14.920]  every action there's an opposite and equal reaction quantum mechanic shows and
[1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:21.640]  as I feel my personal discernment energy increasing because the enemy is now
[1:54:21.640 --> 1:54:25.560]  about to throw its full weight against us so don't think just because we feel
[1:54:25.560 --> 1:54:29.080]  all this energy and strength right now that that's because we're totally want
[1:54:29.080 --> 1:54:33.080]  to be arrogant that's because we're like Godzilla something big is about to
[1:54:33.080 --> 1:54:37.080]  come out of the ocean the big fights about to happen well that's true and it
[1:54:37.080 --> 1:54:40.360]  is going to be on social media it's going to be on YouTube it's going to be on
[1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:43.560]  Facebook it's going to be on the Internet because the Internet was the
[1:54:43.560 --> 1:54:49.240]  very great equation variable that they did not anticipate the Internet was
[1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:52.640]  responsible for getting Donald Trump in power and keeping Hillary Clinton the
[1:54:52.640 --> 1:54:57.480]  sorceress of iniquity out of power so they're very aware where the true power
[1:54:57.480 --> 1:55:00.560]  resides they can read the numbers of subscriptions as well as we can they
[1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:03.800]  know where the audience is going for being arrogant to panic that makes them
[1:55:03.800 --> 1:55:08.040]  stronger now that they're not arrogant anymore but more dangerous right because
[1:55:08.040 --> 1:55:12.560]  when people panic cornered animals get more random in their behaviors so yeah
[1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:16.520]  you need to be alert but we do need you know we fight ugliness but we worship
[1:55:16.520 --> 1:55:20.280]  beauty and we must remember to turn away from the ugliness to drink deep of the
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:23.760]  cup of beauty to inspire people with the beauty of the world that we want to
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:28.520]  create rather than simply showing people all the time how ugly is the enemies we
[1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:33.160]  face because people will be drawn to that beauty and that beauty that love you
[1:55:33.160 --> 1:55:36.560]  know we may fear the devil but we love God if that's where virtue lives in our
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:40.080]  hearts and we must remember to bring people to church rather than to the
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:44.200]  exorcism all the time you're right you that is literally the epiphany I had
[1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:47.080]  earlier on it's a common truth like I discovered you're absolutely right but
[1:55:47.080 --> 1:55:49.920]  I think that's spreading right now is that we need to celebrate our victories be
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:55.080]  thankful and as you said we fight evil but we love beauty we fight evil to
[1:55:55.080 --> 1:56:01.320]  protect beauty and if we allow our all of our actions to be dictated by evil
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:06.240]  doers we simply are the shadow cast by immorality in the world and that is not
[1:56:06.240 --> 1:56:10.720]  enough we really must we can we can show the darkness by being the light just as
[1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:13.880]  much as going down to the dungeons you know if you brighten something up and
[1:56:13.880 --> 1:56:17.400]  something's in the way of the light it costs a long and highly visible shadow
[1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:22.040]  and if we blaze brightly in our joy of truth and beauty and virtue then we will
[1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:26.840]  show the horrifying nature of those I agree more than if we go down and fight
[1:56:26.840 --> 1:56:30.560]  them all the time how did Hercules defeat it when he had to go into the
[1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:34.280]  dark or his final feet of a memory serves and I guess he had to like go
[1:56:34.280 --> 1:56:38.600]  inwardly the light that was within him to defeat it it wasn't battling anymore
[1:56:38.600 --> 1:56:43.200]  he couldn't beat the darkness by sure will he had to think about the light
[1:56:43.200 --> 1:56:48.440]  that was in him that God had given him to defeat it Jesus was not a ninja Jesus
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:53.360]  had no nunchucks Jesus was somebody who pursued and talked about virtue and the
[1:56:53.360 --> 1:56:58.600]  light and sacrificed himself for it and in that sacrifice he created an epiphany
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:02.400]  of beauty and virtue that people have been following for thousands of years
[1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:05.840]  and that's not a bad model to be following and that's why they hated so
[1:57:05.840 --> 1:57:10.880]  much right right they could not talk to their cowards they're fighting at their
[1:57:10.880 --> 1:57:15.080]  level they could not taunt Jesus into fighting at their level he transcended
[1:57:15.080 --> 1:57:19.640]  their level and provoked a following that was in many ways the true foundation
[1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:22.240]  and beauty of Western civilization just like they attack Christ they attack
[1:57:22.240 --> 1:57:26.040]  Uncle Tom because Uncle Tom wasn't a wimp he was strong he just let them kill
[1:57:26.040 --> 1:57:29.560]  him and torture him to bring them down and the fools see that go look at this
[1:57:29.560 --> 1:57:35.360]  idiot but he sacrificed himself yeah just when they think you've lost is the
[1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:39.080]  time for your greatest victory and that I think is next year all right wow well
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:41.160]  we'll be there together hopefully they haven't done the internet kill switch

[2:00:30.680 --> 2:00:34.720]  little segment before our next guest joins us at former board member of the
[2:00:34.720 --> 2:00:39.320]  Davis group head of the Aspen Institute highest levels of the globalist
[2:00:39.320 --> 2:00:45.080]  operation he wants to get into Luciferianism Satanism the operating
[2:00:45.080 --> 2:00:50.480]  system of the psychopaths we're facing Ted Malick joining us coming up in the
[2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:55.440]  next segment but I wanted to get into senator Warner because again if their
[2:00:55.440 --> 2:01:01.600]  whole Russia gates falling apart if the head of the PP gate dossier has now
[2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:05.160]  come out in court and said well there isn't Russian collusion in it they're
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:09.320]  getting sued for saying it so he goes oh no we didn't actually say it the dossier
[2:01:09.320 --> 2:01:13.560]  there's no proof it's not real that's in the news today out of the Washington
[2:01:13.560 --> 2:01:19.200]  Times but they haven't told their minions that yet so Warner comes out with
[2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:23.400]  press conferences almost every day along with that shipless creature shift and
[2:01:23.400 --> 2:01:29.080]  they get up there and they go don't you try to fire him you stop it I heard
[2:01:29.080 --> 2:01:32.600]  you're gonna and Trump's like I'm not gonna fire him he's falling apart he's a
[2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:34.880]  joke
[2:01:37.040 --> 2:01:41.200]  it's an embarrassment to them the whole thing's a fraud it's blowing up with
[2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:45.680]  their face but they just came out saying don't you fire him to act like it's got
[2:01:45.680 --> 2:01:50.360]  all this gravity to act like he's scared of it that's their cover story and it's
[2:01:50.360 --> 2:01:54.040]  so pathetic meanwhile kid Daniels just wrote a story that needs to go viral it's
[2:01:54.040 --> 2:01:58.320]  on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and news wars.com because you know we're
[2:01:58.320 --> 2:02:02.480]  winning but some of the public does it so it's neck and neck here sometimes not
[2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:05.840]  quite neck and neck now we're gonna pull it away but let's not like the wolf says
[2:02:05.840 --> 2:02:09.840]  in Pulp Fiction let's not start you know doing you know what to each other yet
[2:02:09.840 --> 2:02:12.840]  because we're not there yet okay we're never there soon as you think you're
[2:02:12.840 --> 2:02:17.280]  there you know it's all over. Trump re-election odds explode after first
[2:02:17.280 --> 2:02:21.440]  year tax cuts that's I'll start the next segment with that juicy Ronald Reagan
[2:02:21.440 --> 2:02:25.040]  famously said he said when I met Donald Trump it was like I was meeting the
[2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:30.000]  president I knew he would end up being the president was Roger Stone seemed to
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:36.040]  meet with him and then Reagan had folks called Stone and called Stone back and
[2:02:36.040 --> 2:02:40.560]  said that's something about that guy that that that he needed to run him for
[2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:44.800]  office by like Reagan never did that so there you go it's all destiny ladies
[2:02:44.800 --> 2:02:50.800]  and gentlemen what matters about Trump is delivery the Judjitry Bites Fruits
[2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:59.040]  Judjit Bites Fruits for the enemy attacks us they're not stupid they know I am that
[2:02:59.040 --> 2:03:02.080]  they think I'm an insane maniac I tried to buy me off ten million dollars a year
[2:03:02.080 --> 2:03:07.640]  is what the last number got to eat it over a decade ago well we're way surpassed
[2:03:07.640 --> 2:03:10.240]  that it's not about me and ten million dollars but how much money do I have in
[2:03:10.240 --> 2:03:12.880]  the bank if I have to fight them when they come after me which they're already
[2:03:12.880 --> 2:03:17.160]  doing how much money do I have to build an operation and try to go after them to
[2:03:17.160 --> 2:03:20.520]  go you want to kill me let's go all the way but here's Warner with his
[2:03:20.520 --> 2:03:24.760]  incredible and it's all fake trying to go powerful and like to look distinguished
[2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:30.280]  it's all a con game they're all failed actors basically here he is I rise
[2:03:30.280 --> 2:03:35.560]  today concerned about the threats the special counsel's critical
[2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:39.320]  investigation I'm not saying he is one of Russian interference in the 2016
[2:03:39.320 --> 2:03:45.840]  disaster over the last several weeks a growing chorus sick of an irresponsible
[2:03:45.840 --> 2:03:51.760]  and reckless voices have called for President Trump to shut down see
[2:03:51.760 --> 2:03:56.280]  criticizing your fake investigation is shutting it down no it's not these
[2:03:56.280 --> 2:04:01.800]  calls came from the fringes of our political discourse those who would
[2:04:01.800 --> 2:04:04.920]  refuse and then we figured out we're kicking your ass we said don't do it
[2:04:04.920 --> 2:04:11.600]  before base political instincts any attempt by this president to remove
[2:04:11.600 --> 2:04:16.880]  special counsel Mueller from his position the Hillary minion or to pardon key
[2:04:16.880 --> 2:04:23.280]  witnesses in any effort to shield them for from accountability or shut down the
[2:04:23.280 --> 2:04:30.040]  investigation would be a gross abuse of power well buddy don't worry it ain't
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:35.160]  gonna happen you dumbass trying to change the whole subject excuse me I
[2:04:35.160 --> 2:04:39.680]  mean what a sack of parasitic crap that's the type of stuff the global is
[2:04:39.680 --> 2:04:43.080]  put in this country to get in power to screw us over and guess what the tide
[2:04:43.080 --> 2:04:47.280]  turns come like all those other senators aren't running for reelection and you
[2:04:47.280 --> 2:04:50.320]  better start getting ready not to run for it because don't worry everything we
[2:04:50.320 --> 2:04:54.360]  know about you's about to come out Warner get ready

[2:06:54.840 --> 2:06:58.360]  former board member of the Davos Group former head of the Aspen Institute been
[2:06:58.360 --> 2:07:01.680]  in the highest levels of globalism and he's gonna tell some big secrets today
[2:07:01.680 --> 2:07:05.880]  about their mindset their view and the whole nine yards so get ready for that
[2:07:05.880 --> 2:07:12.440]  in a moment but first Ivanka Ivanka Trump talking about just the child tax
[2:07:12.440 --> 2:07:19.120]  credit one of the 30 little juicy gifts of our own money back to us to choose
[2:07:19.120 --> 2:07:23.360]  how we want to spend our money and hence social engineer things according to
[2:07:23.360 --> 2:07:28.920]  the people's will not a bunch of hunchback skexies in DC New York and
[2:07:28.920 --> 2:07:32.960]  LA and Hollywood who again want to just cuckle everything because they're
[2:07:32.960 --> 2:07:35.960]  demonic hunchback demons that though they should be throw to the furnaces of
[2:07:35.960 --> 2:07:41.520]  hell immediately let's go ahead now and go to this this video your name actually
[2:07:41.520 --> 2:07:46.520]  has been linked to this for a while because you were pushing an increase in
[2:07:46.520 --> 2:07:52.440]  the child tax credit in the ultimate final bill it essentially is doubled and
[2:07:52.440 --> 2:07:56.600]  I know you also had Mike Lee with you the senator from Utah and Marco Rubio as
[2:07:56.600 --> 2:08:00.960]  well explain to the folks at home what it's gonna do for them well the
[2:08:00.960 --> 2:08:04.680]  president was very clear that he really wanted to ensure that this bill
[2:08:04.680 --> 2:08:09.320]  accomplished two goals of enabling American business is to grow and be
[2:08:09.320 --> 2:08:14.280]  competitive and therefore lead to wage increase for for working Americans but
[2:08:14.280 --> 2:08:19.600]  to also target relief and middle-income families and the child tax credit is an
[2:08:19.600 --> 2:08:23.560]  incredible vehicle to do that we all know the cost of raising children has
[2:08:23.560 --> 2:08:28.920]  gone up exponentially in this country as until recently wages have stagnated so
[2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:33.280]  raising children is very expensive but it's the most important investment that
[2:08:33.280 --> 2:08:38.120]  we as a country can make in the in in the future this is this is the next
[2:08:38.120 --> 2:08:43.080]  generation of American workers American entrepreneurs and innovators so the child
[2:08:43.080 --> 2:08:49.040]  tax credit was doubled the refund ability was expanded very importantly the
[2:08:49.040 --> 2:08:55.200]  standard deduction the standard for the average family the standard deduction was
[2:08:55.200 --> 2:09:00.120]  actually doubled which is enormously beneficial incredible child independent
[2:09:00.120 --> 2:09:04.840]  tax care credit was maintained as part of the bill the adoption credit a lot of
[2:09:04.840 --> 2:09:08.360]  good stuff in there what well when you look at the things that were cut the
[2:09:08.360 --> 2:09:11.840]  things that were cut were the loopholes that benefited lobbyists and the
[2:09:11.840 --> 2:09:15.560]  special yeah the things that we're gonna pay more taxes here actually were
[2:09:15.560 --> 2:09:19.680]  things like the child tax credit that would have such meaningful impact for
[2:09:19.680 --> 2:09:26.240]  for everyday Americans one of the things that was really so amazing to me in
[2:09:26.240 --> 2:09:30.800]  traveling across the country is just the sense of financial fragility most
[2:09:30.800 --> 2:09:35.760]  American families experience even middle-income American families the average
[2:09:35.760 --> 2:09:40.560]  American family can't come up with $400 in the event of an emergency and my
[2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:44.520]  father is committed to changing that this administration is committed to
[2:09:44.520 --> 2:09:50.440]  changing that amen but see the globalist want a bankruptcy cloud and piven to be
[2:09:50.440 --> 2:09:55.160]  able to reorganize everything that's the plan they admitted it's not like we're
[2:09:55.160 --> 2:10:00.200]  just here seeing it no one that looks like that that's what they say and so
[2:10:00.200 --> 2:10:04.440]  when you realize that it's just so cold-blooded what they're up to and how
[2:10:04.440 --> 2:10:13.160]  close they got us to the edge of that precipice and how sweeter it makes this
[2:10:13.160 --> 2:10:17.640]  reprieve but we better work harder and realize the globalist the leftist they
[2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:22.160]  admit the New York Times that they are just energized Soros gave 18 billion he
[2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:26.280]  usually spends about 500 million a year trying to bring down the US and now it's
[2:10:26.280 --> 2:10:30.120]  18 billion but here's the deal you go see who he can muster on the streets he's
[2:10:30.120 --> 2:10:34.000]  trying to beat a huge wave and historically you just can't do that
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:36.800]  we're gonna go to Ted Mallink here in just a moment but I wanted to play this
[2:10:36.800 --> 2:10:42.720]  clip because it's triggered the left to have congressman up there Tim Scott who
[2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:46.480]  they say could end up being you know the next president down the road who cares
[2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:50.400]  these black all I care about his brain he's a patriot he's shaking with
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:54.000]  pleasure when he realizes how much true affirmative action under Trump's plans
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:59.080]  already being dumped into inner-city areas real jobs high-paying these aren't
[2:10:59.080 --> 2:11:02.720]  just fake make-work stuff turning to a social worker with no pay this is the
[2:11:02.720 --> 2:11:10.640]  real deal and this has got them so incredibly panicked right now this has
[2:11:10.640 --> 2:11:15.920]  them scared because they were so close to seizing control of America and using
[2:11:15.920 --> 2:11:19.480]  as a pure engine of evil you think the Russians were bad when they went in and
[2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:23.880]  took the czars out in 1917 and a moment of weakness and turn Russia into an
[2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:29.120]  engine of evil it was bad can you imagine the United States as a pure
[2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:35.440]  engine of evil this been a mixed bag last 50 years pure psychopath driven evil
[2:11:35.440 --> 2:11:42.680]  by the globalist the Hollywood globalist type I mean good God good God we'd
[2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:45.720]  have to go to the emergency backups then wouldn't it that they laid down because
[2:11:45.720 --> 2:11:48.120]  they're already get they couldn't get our second they're going up the first
[2:11:48.120 --> 2:11:52.640]  right now so here's the congressman Tim Scott who's got them all trigger call
[2:11:52.640 --> 2:11:56.880]  them an uncle Tom all these names blah blah blah because the left's been good
[2:11:56.880 --> 2:11:59.760]  at making black folks not think they could be part of the tea party or part
[2:11:59.760 --> 2:12:02.280]  of the public party while the public party said we want to run you for office
[2:12:02.280 --> 2:12:05.040]  you got a good background good person I will wake up the chief of staff saying
[2:12:05.040 --> 2:12:08.160]  we want you in here if you're a minority with the White House wants to hire you
[2:12:08.160 --> 2:12:13.000]  come on let's go come on come on come on let's go the Democrats aren't playing
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:18.200]  strangleholds in come on up come on up let's go let's go because they want you
[2:12:18.200 --> 2:12:21.040]  literally on their plantation let's go this club
[2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:25.360]  Mr. President during one of those conversations that we had we talked
[2:12:25.360 --> 2:12:31.040]  about ways to improve distressed communities throughout this country 52
[2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:35.680]  million Americans living in distressed communities and we talked about legislation
[2:12:35.680 --> 2:12:40.560]  that can move those communities forward got please Trump is you said yes as a
[2:12:40.560 --> 2:12:45.920]  part of this tax reform package the investing and opportunity act has been
[2:12:45.920 --> 2:12:51.960]  included which will bring trillions of dollars into poor communities because of
[2:12:51.960 --> 2:13:05.960]  your willingness to listen the president said I only have about 45 more minutes
[2:13:05.960 --> 2:13:17.400]  I'm gonna get to my he didn't say that okay let me just say to those Americans
[2:13:17.400 --> 2:13:22.680]  who are watching this process this is not about Washington it's not about the
[2:13:22.680 --> 2:13:31.760]  left it's not about the right it's about single parent moms who are looking for
[2:13:31.760 --> 2:13:40.000]  reason to be hopeful in 2018 this tax reform plan delivers for the average
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:49.480]  single mother a 70% tax cut for the average family who's working paycheck to
[2:13:49.480 --> 2:13:56.040]  paycheck looking for ways to be hopeful about their future to have an extra
[2:13:56.040 --> 2:14:02.520]  night for dinner out at a restaurant this tax reform package cuts their taxes
[2:14:02.520 --> 2:14:10.760]  by nearly 60% and because of folks like Marco Rubio and Ivanka when you think
[2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:17.480]  about the folks with kids in the household this plan doubles the child tax
[2:14:17.480 --> 2:14:23.520]  credit and makes about 70% of it refundable this is a plan that we can
[2:14:23.520 --> 2:14:28.920]  be proud of because it speaks to the hearts of everyday Americans but it's
[2:14:28.920 --> 2:14:33.600]  not the poor workers shouldn't be paying any taxes Trump try to get rid of it
[2:14:33.600 --> 2:14:37.520]  okay they shouldn't be paying anything because their taxes are already slow but
[2:14:37.520 --> 2:14:43.240]  they need it all back it's the middle class tax cuts they're gonna surge 7.3
[2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:48.880]  to 10.1 they're saying the most analyst I mean this is explosive growth real
[2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:52.320]  growth not fake come to Chinese growth we're all goes to you know a couple
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:55.680]  hundred generals we're gonna talk about all this on the other side but this is
[2:14:55.680 --> 2:15:01.520]  just massive and I just think about the fact that Trump that very same podium at
[2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:06.960]  the Capitol just 11 months ago committed to do so much TPP killing and all of it
[2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:12.840]  he did it so that's there again so the president the Capitol is at the White
[2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:16.320]  House then but I mean it's just right there in that very same area committing
[2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:20.040]  to do it I was just right down below when he did it and I knew it I knew it my
[2:15:20.040 --> 2:15:24.240]  gut my instinct said this is real it's happening and it's happened it's not
[2:15:24.240 --> 2:15:27.360]  perfect it's a bloody war but it's in the right direction it's got the globalist

[2:20:29.720 --> 2:20:33.200]  all right Ted Malick is with us for the balance the transmission and then we've
[2:20:33.200 --> 2:20:37.560]  got the fourth hour coming up that I'm gonna be segling into with anti-cumia
[2:20:37.560 --> 2:20:42.720]  always does an incredible job in the war with Owen shroyer Roger Stone coming up
[2:20:42.720 --> 2:20:48.240]  Ted Malick was former board member of the Debo's group of course former head of
[2:20:48.240 --> 2:20:51.760]  the Aspen Institute with the top levels organizations but he's always been a
[2:20:51.760 --> 2:20:55.200]  patriot I've gone back to writings he did 25 years ago I'm looking into all his
[2:20:55.200 --> 2:20:59.480]  PhDs international political economy and then he's also got degrees you know
[2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:04.120]  dealing with religion but that's why it's important to get him on he's worked
[2:21:04.120 --> 2:21:07.440]  in capital markets with Solomon brothers and service senior policy positions the
[2:21:07.440 --> 2:21:10.760]  US Senate committee on farm relations the US State Department I'm gonna get into
[2:21:10.760 --> 2:21:16.280]  all that the reason I got him on last time I wanted to get into the occult
[2:21:16.280 --> 2:21:20.040]  obsessions of some of the globalists he wasn't ready he said yeah it goes on but
[2:21:20.040 --> 2:21:23.560]  he said let me just think about what I'm willing to get into and then I'll talk
[2:21:23.560 --> 2:21:26.880]  about it because I've been involved some with Hollywood and some with stuff in
[2:21:26.880 --> 2:21:30.000]  the UK and they're like won't you come to Hellfire Club it's like major
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:33.400]  directors people we're gonna go on these catacombs and it's like eyes wide shut
[2:21:33.400 --> 2:21:36.520]  and once you do it you're in the club I'm like no so I never did at all and I'm
[2:21:36.520 --> 2:21:43.560]  sure Ted hasn't either the point is not that I'm scared of it I just like going
[2:21:43.560 --> 2:21:47.080]  crazy I'm scared of like people just being involved in all that so because
[2:21:47.080 --> 2:21:50.360]  then it leads to other things you know like killing somebody at the end of the
[2:21:50.360 --> 2:21:54.240]  night or whatever so Ted Malick's here to to break it all down but he wanted to
[2:21:54.240 --> 2:21:58.960]  get into his prolific articles that are published all over the place from you
[2:21:58.960 --> 2:22:02.720]  name it world that daily to info orders to big establish for publications but
[2:22:02.720 --> 2:22:08.520]  US tax reform breaks global rules says EU that's how to DW.com big German news
[2:22:08.520 --> 2:22:12.880]  now they admit it's gonna move jobs back to US they we have secret combines with
[2:22:12.880 --> 2:22:14.800]  you we have agreements you're not supposed to do it
[2:22:14.800 --> 2:22:18.240]  Germany demands UK's unconditional surrender on Brexit that that that's
[2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:23.200]  Ted Malick Trump's top EU pick warrants German media of seismic shift in ties
[2:22:23.200 --> 2:22:29.120]  shows world in daily article let's revisit the Podesta pigeon for pedophilic
[2:22:29.120 --> 2:22:34.480]  cannibalistic and satanic art which we can say okay not the pizza place that's
[2:22:34.480 --> 2:22:38.600]  how they divert us off into that but but but but but you know them themselves in
[2:22:38.600 --> 2:22:41.760]  the WikiLeaks which we're ready to really release some big stuff on very
[2:22:41.760 --> 2:22:46.560]  soon there's lots of that behind the scenes so Ted Malick joins us now when
[2:22:46.560 --> 2:22:49.440]  I give him the floor we don't do pre-interviews and I haven't talked to
[2:22:49.440 --> 2:22:52.080]  him since you visit us in studio a few weeks ago in Austin where do you want
[2:22:52.080 --> 2:22:55.800]  to start with that palette that you kind of laid out a few few little pieces of
[2:22:55.800 --> 2:23:00.080]  blobs of pain I put there where do you want to go first I think there are some
[2:23:00.080 --> 2:23:06.840]  we have some time so we have some linkages the EU is part of of course the
[2:23:06.840 --> 2:23:13.560]  globalist empire the new world order and I think that many of its origins are
[2:23:13.560 --> 2:23:19.000]  in fact quite evil and I think we we should talk about that I've written
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:24.920]  about it in his leg wars where I describe the under unconditional surrender
[2:23:24.920 --> 2:23:30.440]  the Germany is demanding of Britain of the UK during the Brexit negotiations is
[2:23:30.440 --> 2:23:35.320]  basically a German takeover of Europe making Europe into its own puppet state
[2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:41.480]  with its crony capitalism and its fake currency the euro but I what I really
[2:23:41.480 --> 2:23:47.560]  want to do after our conversation just a few weeks ago in studio is come back to
[2:23:47.560 --> 2:23:53.000]  this question that you asked me that I was unprepared for because you know
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:56.600]  some times it's uncomfortable particularly this time of year but I want
[2:23:56.600 --> 2:24:02.080]  to talk about it and that is Luciferianism Luciferianism is a belief
[2:24:02.080 --> 2:24:06.400]  system that venerates the essential characteristics that are fixed to Lucifer
[2:24:06.400 --> 2:24:13.600]  that tradition has been informed by Gnosticism my Satanism and it usually
[2:24:13.600 --> 2:24:18.680]  refers to Lucifer not as the devil per se but as some kind of liberator some kind
[2:24:18.680 --> 2:24:23.640]  of guardian some kind of guiding spirit in fact is the true God as opposed to
[2:24:23.640 --> 2:24:41.040]  Jehovah and I think many people in Europe and this state is Luciferian
[2:24:41.040 --> 2:24:49.840]  orientation is really this creation of a fallen angel of course we know who Lucifer
[2:24:49.840 --> 2:24:55.480]  is and he's seen as one of the morning stars as a symbol of enlightenment as a
[2:24:55.480 --> 2:25:01.520]  kind of independence and of true human progress turning away from God and
[2:25:01.520 --> 2:25:06.200]  turning to Lucifer in order to enlighten yourself so I did a little research on
[2:25:06.200 --> 2:25:12.560]  this and you'll find this very interesting in his very famous 1971 book
[2:25:12.560 --> 2:25:19.040]  which was his final book rules for radicals the very prominent American
[2:25:19.040 --> 2:25:24.880]  community organizer on the far left Saul Alinsky wrote at the end of his
[2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:30.960]  acknowledgments to that book and I want to quote this less we forget at least
[2:25:30.960 --> 2:25:35.360]  and over the shoulder acknowledgement at the very first radical from our
[2:25:35.360 --> 2:25:41.120]  legends mythology and history and who knows where mythology leaves off and
[2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:46.080]  history begins or which is which the first radical known to man who rebelled
[2:25:46.080 --> 2:25:52.720]  against the establishment and did it so effectively that he is one his own
[2:25:52.720 --> 2:26:01.000]  kingdom was Lucifer Saul Inski dedicating rules to radical to his
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:08.960]  hero Lucifer and of course that's him in public just saying oh I do this kind of
[2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:12.360]  in a you know a little cheat you wear whatever but when you get down to brass
[2:26:12.360 --> 2:26:16.320]  tax these people really believe they're setting themselves up as God and they
[2:26:16.320 --> 2:26:20.040]  advertise just like you're in the French Revolution the false revolution the
[2:26:20.040 --> 2:26:25.600]  Jacobin system versus our real revolution that they want to become God
[2:26:25.600 --> 2:26:28.760]  they want absolute power and he writes about the book he believes in nothing
[2:26:28.760 --> 2:26:34.080]  but absolute power this is so creepy this is the opposite of chivalry the
[2:26:34.080 --> 2:26:40.720]  opposite of Christ the opposite of Jehovah that's what it is we're talking
[2:26:40.720 --> 2:26:45.240]  about the anti-Christ we're talking about the fallen angel but for these
[2:26:45.240 --> 2:26:49.760]  people turning their you know their face against the true God they're turning
[2:26:49.760 --> 2:26:55.920]  to this form of anti-Christ of Lucifer and that's the foundation for their
[2:26:55.920 --> 2:26:59.560]  guidance for their enlightenment for their institutions I would argue even
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:04.360]  for the whole definition of this new world order and we can get into John
[2:27:04.360 --> 2:27:08.760]  Podesta and his emails which we will do that next is we want to break but but
[2:27:08.760 --> 2:27:11.680]  truly whether you're an atheist or not they believe in the archetypes and
[2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:15.840]  operating system like a program you look at what they did to Russia I mean they
[2:27:15.840 --> 2:27:20.560]  tried this whole Luciferian operation there they are so angry I talked to
[2:27:20.560 --> 2:27:23.760]  folks high level in Hollywood other is they're mad that Russia is truly
[2:27:23.760 --> 2:27:30.360]  becoming Christian they it's literally spiritual they are so angry well they
[2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:38.160]  have to obviously feel very annoyed by any people any person any community any
[2:27:38.160 --> 2:27:42.960]  nation that turns their hearts back to God and there's increasing evidence that
[2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:47.280]  lots of people in Russia are doing that obviously since that was impossible
[2:27:47.280 --> 2:27:52.240]  during the 70 years of Hania's communism so they are falling back on these
[2:27:52.240 --> 2:27:57.960]  traditions their old religion the Eastern Orthodoxy in Russia but if you look at
[2:27:57.960 --> 2:28:02.760]  the pure statistics Alex around the world about 85% of people believe in God
[2:28:02.760 --> 2:28:08.360]  in different spiritual traditions in different sacred texts Christian ideas
[2:28:08.360 --> 2:28:16.320]  obviously the largest of those Islam Hinduism Buddhism etc. they're all
[2:28:16.320 --> 2:28:22.400]  very strong faith traditions Luciferians detest this and they particularly
[2:28:22.400 --> 2:28:28.840]  detest the Christian tradition because Lucifer is the fallen angel away from
[2:28:28.840 --> 2:28:31.520]  Christ that's right they they said they want to play all religions off against
[2:28:31.520 --> 2:28:35.440]  each other till nothing's left but Lucifer we're gonna come back again I
[2:28:35.440 --> 2:28:38.840]  know you're gonna get into this as a theologian you have a degree in but I

[2:28:45.440 --> 2:28:49.680]  I can't talk about it but in general the the spirit of Lucifer the attitude the

[2:33:28.080 --> 2:33:36.400]  humanity faces incredible challenges but only being aware of it can save us a
[2:33:36.400 --> 2:33:40.160]  globalist ahead of one of the he wasn't the head of the big three he was the
[2:33:40.160 --> 2:33:43.600]  head of the fourth largest bank in the u.s. the time again I flew to be on the
[2:33:43.600 --> 2:33:48.440]  view years ago it's like six seven years ago now and I sat down next kind of
[2:33:48.440 --> 2:33:52.080]  recognizing a little bit from watching financial shows he wasn't a gas but you'd
[2:33:52.080 --> 2:33:56.240]  seen him he figured out how I was real quick as folks were shaking my hand and
[2:33:56.240 --> 2:34:01.080]  he was telling his visit his dad who was a retired general in San Antonio and he
[2:34:01.080 --> 2:34:04.480]  just had about a three hour conversation by the way got the perfect
[2:34:04.480 --> 2:34:09.240]  suit after being on the plane and got his you know french coat out hair
[2:34:09.240 --> 2:34:13.640]  perfect everything and is there all about that and he goes as the plane's
[2:34:13.640 --> 2:34:19.040]  landing he goes alex you think people are gonna adapt and overcome the Marine
[2:34:19.040 --> 2:34:24.160]  Corps term improvise overcome that overcome you'll you don't get it
[2:34:24.160 --> 2:34:29.040]  that's what you're gonna do the general public is gonna adapt to being in the
[2:34:29.040 --> 2:34:35.800]  system and he laughed at me and I said to him once he did his thing in turn
[2:34:35.800 --> 2:34:39.280]  getting his jacket out he waited to say it after he listened to me for like an
[2:34:39.280 --> 2:34:44.960]  hour on the plane we didn't talk the first few hours first he's like looking
[2:34:44.960 --> 2:34:50.400]  over at me I'm sitting right next to American Airlines and he wanted to have
[2:34:50.400 --> 2:34:54.480]  his piece of me done and I said listen I can't bet against humanity and want to
[2:34:54.480 --> 2:35:00.960]  live and his back was turning he shuttered and it was that point like
[2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:05.520]  I'm not giving my soul up I get the public's thumb down I get they'll tear
[2:35:05.520 --> 2:35:09.400]  me apart I get I get it you've made him into a weapon the point is I can't feel
[2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:13.240]  big while they're little I don't want to join you and look down on the slaves
[2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:16.880]  don't you get it doesn't mean if somebody tries to destroy me I won't rip
[2:35:16.880 --> 2:35:21.200]  their head off the difference is I'm not out to get people it's not like I'm
[2:35:21.200 --> 2:35:25.160]  some saint you people virtue signal all day because you have no virtue and
[2:35:25.160 --> 2:35:29.480]  studies show that the average liberal is always flip the numbers it's in a bunch
[2:35:29.480 --> 2:35:34.520]  of British and US studies in Canadian but on average it's what six times more
[2:35:34.520 --> 2:35:40.720]  unlikely to lie nine times more likely to steal or is it vice versa because
[2:35:40.720 --> 2:35:44.000]  they're not real liberals and they've changed all the terms so Ted Mallick
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:47.200]  you've got the floor of the segment I'm running Ted mallick.com got your new
[2:35:47.200 --> 2:35:50.840]  book out secrets of business we really tell folks what's going on again former
[2:35:50.840 --> 2:35:55.480]  board member of the Davos group so much more you know major envoy of the Senate
[2:35:55.480 --> 2:35:59.320]  government of the Senate Committee for relations the US State Department big
[2:35:59.320 --> 2:36:02.840]  insider but that's been a patriot on a bad guy not everybody in the insides bad
[2:36:02.840 --> 2:36:05.400]  point is you've got a track where you're exposing it you're getting into
[2:36:05.400 --> 2:36:08.480]  Luciferianism you're getting into their worldview you're getting into who they
[2:36:08.480 --> 2:36:12.680]  are where are we historically what is this obsession with Lucifer what are we
[2:36:12.680 --> 2:36:28.360]  facing the DNC Hillary Clinton campaign John Podesta of course was the top of all
[2:36:28.360 --> 2:36:33.680]  the top of everything they were trying to do everything they were trying to
[2:36:33.680 --> 2:36:39.280]  foment on the rest of us very involved in international organizations all kinds
[2:36:39.280 --> 2:36:43.360]  of deals the Clinton Foundation if you look at his emails now the public and
[2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:47.720]  for the first time actually look at these emails thanks to WikiLeaks and you
[2:36:47.720 --> 2:36:53.240]  can see the references that he made over and over again to Luciferianism and
[2:36:53.240 --> 2:36:59.680]  this is abhorrent also to sexual abuse abuse of children by himself he uses
[2:36:59.680 --> 2:37:04.840]  code words such as cheese which means little girl pasta which means little
[2:37:04.840 --> 2:37:10.400]  boy math which means steam and sauce which means orgy and he uses them over
[2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:16.160]  and over again these code words on the deep web pedophile messaging boards and
[2:37:16.160 --> 2:37:20.000]  emails and there are many of them your viewers can go look at them they're
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:26.560]  available online they prove that he is involved very deeply involved as a
[2:37:26.560 --> 2:37:33.600]  committed Luciferian and it's in among other things it's his invitation by
[2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:40.040]  Marina Abramovitz to what is called a spirit cooking ritual which I think
[2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:45.840]  proves the most revealing now for the year that was invented by Alistair
[2:37:45.840 --> 2:37:49.320]  Crowley reportedly the most evil man alive reportedly sacrificed his own
[2:37:49.320 --> 2:37:58.040]  son precisely this is a ritual a specific ritual in which participants use
[2:37:58.040 --> 2:38:03.000]  the violist human body fluids in order to summon spiritual energies or
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:08.800]  assistance in favor and to any same person this sounds completely lucrative
[2:38:08.800 --> 2:38:15.920]  you know ludicrous but to Luciferian this is the practice of enlightenment it's
[2:38:15.920 --> 2:38:20.320]  something that initiates them it's something that they understand that they
[2:38:20.320 --> 2:38:25.320]  have to lower their humanity to a low enough level to be possessed by this
[2:38:25.320 --> 2:38:32.800]  evil force that's the whole idea to be possessed by Lucifer himself and these
[2:38:32.800 --> 2:38:39.120]  practices of a Luciferian religion and anti-Christianity are I would argue the
[2:38:39.120 --> 2:38:45.040]  absolute inversion of Christianity as he says in the emails come we have blood
[2:38:45.040 --> 2:38:48.680]  we have semen and this is what they use pizza gate to divert off to some pizza
[2:38:48.680 --> 2:38:51.880]  store that the media all covered we covered it then they claim we were part
[2:38:51.880 --> 2:38:55.040]  of it again this is what they're pouring out this is
[2:38:55.040 --> 2:39:11.880]  unbelievable you know holy Eucharist the mass we also have cannibalism and
[2:39:11.880 --> 2:39:18.040]  pedophilia these are highlights these are common practices actually amongst
[2:39:18.040 --> 2:39:23.440]  Luciferians and this makes I think Podesta's choice of paintings in his
[2:39:23.440 --> 2:39:30.160]  own office all the more revealing the paintings in his office and we actually
[2:39:30.160 --> 2:39:36.400]  have photos of those as well are very disturbing they to pick cannibalism and
[2:39:36.400 --> 2:39:41.560]  when asked in an interview by the you know the political magazine Politico
[2:39:41.560 --> 2:39:48.440]  about the paintings Podesta replied that it's better to be the guy with the fork
[2:39:48.440 --> 2:39:55.880]  rather than the guy on the table this is the guy that was leading the Democratic
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:40:01.360]  Party this is the shot of what looks like eight-year-old girls begging not to
[2:40:01.360 --> 2:40:06.280]  be gang-raped in a shower with I guess like step the time up the ceiling this
[2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:10.280]  is and this is they would tweet photos of dungeons and then things and then they
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:13.720]  and then again I didn't realize what was happening at the time when Washington
[2:40:13.720 --> 2:40:17.240]  Post New York Times CNN all focus on a pizza place instead of the emails in
[2:40:17.240 --> 2:40:20.680]  New York we covered the pizza place covered the rumors then they said we
[2:40:20.680 --> 2:40:24.720]  created it and there's and then I had a crazy woman and a bunch of Democrats
[2:40:24.720 --> 2:40:28.560]  attacked me literally at a restaurant to the night screaming do you screw your
[2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:32.880]  baby we're going to get you screw your baby and the whole family was just like
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:36.440]  I've got video of it I haven't put it out yet yeah this is Podesta's art chained
[2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:39.600]  up little children I know and they're and they're so foolish they think that
[2:40:39.600 --> 2:40:43.200]  they think that they I mean behind the scenes it's just unbelievable I can't
[2:40:43.200 --> 2:40:46.560]  believe you're I just can't handle it I usually came and look at this stuff we're
[2:40:46.560 --> 2:40:50.240]  putting on screen this is Tony Podesta's art that though notice it's lesser
[2:40:50.240 --> 2:40:55.520]  magic though mr. Mallink they put this in 2007 in the paper as a public
[2:40:55.520 --> 2:40:59.240]  celebration of what they were doing to throw it in our face and to dehumanize
[2:40:59.240 --> 2:41:06.200]  us which is a form of mind rape so I mean what kind of people are we dealing
[2:41:06.200 --> 2:41:11.040]  with what kind of leaders are we dealing with if these are their deepest
[2:41:11.040 --> 2:41:19.680]  spiritual sentiments and practices chained up children kind of respect any
[2:41:19.680 --> 2:41:24.080]  kind of a court let alone think of them for public office I mean it's beyond the
[2:41:24.080 --> 2:41:33.640]  test of it is actually radical evil please continue well I actually think
[2:41:33.640 --> 2:41:40.640]  that we have to expose this Alex where it exists to the degree it exists the
[2:41:40.640 --> 2:41:45.520]  fact that it is at the top of our government that is in fact this is the
[2:41:45.520 --> 2:41:51.120]  top of our national organization that has ran by the U.R. that is the U.R. in the
[2:41:51.120 --> 2:41:53.960]  European Union stay right there stay right there I don't want to do
[2:41:53.960 --> 2:41:57.920]  conspiracies but you've been on Skype many times no problem it is hammered and

[2:42:04.120 --> 2:42:07.280]  want you to repeat all this is too critical and the media will play clips
[2:42:07.280 --> 2:42:10.520]  and you know make fun of the sound and say you know whatever but that's why
[2:42:10.520 --> 2:42:17.640]  they've got front-page articles in daily beast Buzzfeed all of them with me and
[2:42:17.640 --> 2:42:22.560]  UFOs I don't even cover UFOs is trying to desperately inoculate people that
[2:42:22.560 --> 2:42:29.840]  were cooks when all we're showing you is Podesta's public art that is children
[2:42:29.840 --> 2:42:37.560]  chained up in dungeons and again his brother is an emails and they say sir

[2:47:41.760 --> 2:47:50.760]  time a finger like that Sistine Chapel painting Ed Malik globalist insider not
[2:47:50.760 --> 2:47:58.440]  a globalist is our guest he's gonna recap his critical information but first
[2:47:58.440 --> 2:48:05.160]  let's hear Donald Trump pledging what he is now one year in already delivered

[2:48:40.160 --> 2:48:45.840]  you Albany get out and vote how could he say that because of the boats tied to
[2:48:45.840 --> 2:48:50.400]  the dock and he just needs to take the rope off they've already parlayed our
[2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:54.560]  power to build up the world but not for the people for the globalist then he
[2:48:54.560 --> 2:49:00.080]  already knows all he's got to do is untie it he knows we get this done it
[2:49:00.080 --> 2:49:03.440]  works because we already know the economics Ted Malik take over my
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:06.360]  friend for the nine minutes we've got in this segment we'll hold over the next
[2:49:06.360 --> 2:49:08.720]  hour I know you had some Skype problems never happened before but it's happening
[2:49:08.720 --> 2:49:12.840]  as you break as a big insider you're not talking about what you saw inside not
[2:49:12.840 --> 2:49:17.600]  breaking any confidences you're only exposing what is in public domain recap
[2:49:17.600 --> 2:49:21.320]  everything you said my friend you have a lot of courage go ahead well we were
[2:49:21.320 --> 2:49:28.000]  talking about Luciferianism about its origin and offices in you know and
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:32.880]  antique history what it amounts to anti-Christian orientation but more
[2:49:32.880 --> 2:49:36.680]  specifically for the last few minutes we've been talking about the head of the
[2:49:36.680 --> 2:49:41.120]  Democrat Party the head of the Clinton campaign a number of people in that
[2:49:41.120 --> 2:49:47.200]  organization who worship Lucifer and what that means in their emails
[2:49:47.200 --> 2:49:52.360]  officially in their emails officially world.com article please continue we
[2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:57.800]  can't make this stuff up I mean it's just too grotesque but we also can look at
[2:49:57.800 --> 2:50:01.640]  the paintings that they have in their offices the pedophilia that they practice
[2:50:01.640 --> 2:50:10.880]  the spirit cooking that they become involved in and a whole nature of their
[2:50:10.880 --> 2:50:15.720]  enlightenment and what that means and I we actually also pointed out that it's
[2:50:15.720 --> 2:50:21.680]  all in ski and his original book for radicals pointed to the same tradition
[2:50:21.680 --> 2:50:27.840]  to Lucifer so this is part of the left it's part of a turning away from our
[2:50:27.840 --> 2:50:33.120]  which historically left meant left-hand path and the French Revolution the
[2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:35.960]  occult it never meant left there wasn't left or right until then please
[2:50:35.960 --> 2:50:39.640]  continue that that is an actual you're correct
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:45.080]  so logically but what I really want to talk about because this is dark and
[2:50:45.080 --> 2:50:50.720]  it's evil and it upsets me and my wife no end even let's just say you're taking
[2:50:50.720 --> 2:50:53.920]  up this is a big deal to have somebody like you that's been in these circles
[2:50:53.920 --> 2:50:57.440]  at the highest levels but this is a big deal a lot of courage I know you're not
[2:50:57.440 --> 2:51:01.400]  going to say it yourself but this is a big deal so go ahead well I also taught
[2:51:01.400 --> 2:51:05.680]  at Yale Divinity School as well as Yale School of Management I've been in major
[2:51:05.680 --> 2:51:11.360]  universities I'm I am not making this stuff up I have the academic credentials
[2:51:11.360 --> 2:51:16.840]  I understand its depth but I also realize we're talking here about something
[2:51:16.840 --> 2:51:23.160]  that is radically evil it is anti-Christian so what what we have to
[2:51:23.160 --> 2:51:27.640]  do is expose it for what it is and we have to point it out and I think that
[2:51:27.640 --> 2:51:36.080]  the public will rebuke it well just continue breaking this down well I
[2:51:36.080 --> 2:51:42.120]  think that what I'd like to do instead is talk about our own tradition because
[2:51:42.120 --> 2:51:46.320]  after all it is Christmas exactly we know that's what that's the theme without
[2:51:46.320 --> 2:51:50.200]  us even saying it we know the evil let's celebrate the light right now and the
[2:51:50.200 --> 2:51:55.800]  beauty that truly despairs that that truly drives off the dark you know we
[2:51:55.800 --> 2:52:00.760]  gave five minutes or ten minutes to this very radical and dark light let's
[2:52:00.760 --> 2:52:05.240]  let's put the bright light on our own tradition the real root of our being in
[2:52:05.240 --> 2:52:08.520]  Christian thinking which is rooted in the New Testament of course and the
[2:52:08.520 --> 2:52:13.920]  wonderful insights of Saint Paul they actually have great relevance to us as
[2:52:13.920 --> 2:52:18.240]  people not least of all because it's an attempt to spell out in very detailed
[2:52:18.240 --> 2:52:23.720]  terms exactly what it means to live in the belief that the world is ordered
[2:52:23.720 --> 2:52:29.320]  that it's ordered by a loving God that he demands love from each one of us not
[2:52:29.320 --> 2:52:34.520]  only towards himself but also towards our neighbors and at Christmas and I'm
[2:52:34.520 --> 2:52:39.080]  reflecting on this my family's coming home tomorrow flying in from all over the
[2:52:39.080 --> 2:52:45.720]  world we especially need to reflect on what gift has meant in the Christian
[2:52:45.720 --> 2:52:51.000]  tradition the tradition again that has shaped our Western culture that we cannot
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:55.080]  give up we have to pray for those countries like Poland and Hungary where
[2:52:55.080 --> 2:52:59.200]  they're actually battling the European Union over this very culture right now
[2:52:59.200 --> 2:53:04.840]  and this whole concept of charity as love to which we are commanded to use the
[2:53:04.840 --> 2:53:10.200]  original term so this giving which is of course part of the Christmas tradition
[2:53:10.200 --> 2:53:14.720]  we all have these gifts under our tree we've all purchased these items we're
[2:53:14.720 --> 2:53:19.120]  all excited about the pleasure it's a way of opening yourself up to the other
[2:53:19.120 --> 2:53:23.720]  it's an invitation to friendship it's very exciting it's also very much a
[2:53:23.720 --> 2:53:29.160]  part of the American tradition if you think about it Americans are really
[2:53:29.160 --> 2:53:33.880]  defined I would say in many ways by their generosity by their volunteering I
[2:53:33.880 --> 2:53:40.040]  mean when Toto came to America you know 180 years ago what he found across the
[2:53:40.040 --> 2:53:45.320]  entire American hinterland was this feature and we should be rightly
[2:53:45.320 --> 2:53:52.080]  proud of it this notion of generosity in America and in Europe you don't see this
[2:53:52.080 --> 2:53:58.440]  very much because the state has taken charge and they carry out all the family
[2:53:58.440 --> 2:54:02.360]  functions they carry out the charity they carry out all these sacred things but
[2:54:02.360 --> 2:54:05.640]  then corrupt them and again they made it all commercial it could become sick
[2:54:05.640 --> 2:54:08.920]  there but that's just it was back when people didn't have a lot to give
[2:54:08.920 --> 2:54:12.960]  something was a big deal because that spirit made all this wealth now we
[2:54:12.960 --> 2:54:16.360]  think of nothing giving all this again they've distorted everything that's
[2:54:16.360 --> 2:54:23.240]  sacred indeed and so you have on the hold and in socialism and Europe is
[2:54:23.240 --> 2:54:28.600]  socialistic to large extent you have this hostility to private giving this
[2:54:28.600 --> 2:54:33.200]  hostility to the notion of gift because they want to get in the middle of
[2:54:33.200 --> 2:54:37.120]  private association men and women community they want to get the middle of
[2:54:37.120 --> 2:54:42.840]  our private associations that is a cult it shows no respect for private
[2:54:42.840 --> 2:54:49.000]  property for industry for wealth and it tries to put this this notion of
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:53.040]  equality in the state being the Arbitur over and all of this it's not
[2:54:53.040 --> 2:54:58.200]  surprising to me when you think of the first act of Lenin after the Bolshevik
[2:54:58.200 --> 2:55:04.840]  Revolution in Russia was to abolish and expropriate all private charities all
[2:55:04.840 --> 2:55:09.000]  gift giving what happened in the Second World War when the Communist took
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:14.680]  power in Hungary they had 10,000 religious voluntary societies in that
[2:55:14.680 --> 2:55:19.600]  little tiny country of 8 million people within two years all of them were
[2:55:19.600 --> 2:55:23.760]  abolished they stole the goodwill of the people they stole the goodwill of
[2:55:23.760 --> 2:55:28.800]  people and this is true in Communist Party wherever you find it in China
[2:55:28.800 --> 2:55:34.640]  today people have to give in secret or they have to give at risk of
[2:55:34.640 --> 2:55:37.560]  imprisonment they have their underground schools or underground
[2:55:37.560 --> 2:55:42.320]  universities their underground churches underground medicine and it's the
[2:55:42.320 --> 2:55:47.960]  heroic actions and of the few that that lead to that kind of wonderful shared
[2:55:47.960 --> 2:55:53.320]  experience of the gift and now here's my argument I'm saying that giving is not
[2:55:53.320 --> 2:55:58.800]  only natural but it's a fundamental part of moral health and by giving which is
[2:55:58.800 --> 2:56:02.880]  what we're doing in this season the existence of the other is fulfilled in
[2:56:02.880 --> 2:56:08.800]  love and this kind of gratitude is absolutely is absolutely crucial to
[2:56:08.800 --> 2:56:14.080]  being a human being if you read the Bible and some people do I hopefully in
[2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:18.960]  church over the next few days the first letter to the Corinthians of St. Paul
[2:56:18.960 --> 2:56:26.600]  delivers his celebrated aconium of the three theological virtues faith hope and
[2:56:26.600 --> 2:56:33.200]  charity and that word for charity agape that is so critical a love that has
[2:56:33.200 --> 2:56:38.960]  been brought to this world by Christ and which is the love which God extends to
[2:56:38.960 --> 2:56:44.400]  all of us and which you are asked to extend to one another this is gift love
[2:56:44.400 --> 2:56:49.480]  is what Paul talks about it is one it's an overwhelming spirit that's why I
[2:56:49.480 --> 2:56:53.360]  get tears of eyes talking about this because it's so strong it's so pure
[2:56:53.360 --> 2:57:00.520]  it's destiny for the species you can feel destiny knocking on the door at St.
[2:57:00.520 --> 2:57:04.920]  Thomas Aquinas in you know in Christian history argues that it's the
[2:57:04.920 --> 2:57:11.480]  fundamental gift it's granted by God to himself by his own nature and to the
[2:57:11.480 --> 2:57:18.080]  world in choice so it's my life your gifts are a gift stay there we're gonna
[2:57:18.080 --> 2:57:21.880]  come back so to 70 seconds stay there two minutes now the breakthrough that
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:26.320]  said everything else is satanic it wants to hold God is giving giving giving
[2:57:26.320 --> 2:57:30.240]  giving consciousness everything all the beauty everything and we're just like
[2:57:30.240 --> 2:57:34.600]  bitching and complaining we've been given consciousness on this star base in
[2:57:34.600 --> 2:57:39.880]  the middle of the galaxy with unlimited potential I mean we just it's thank God

[3:00:35.360 --> 3:00:39.200]  yesterday what do you think this is going next how are they gonna strike back
[3:00:39.200 --> 3:00:43.040]  because their rush investigations falling apart been proven inside jobs
[3:00:43.040 --> 3:00:47.640]  spectacularly it shows how arrogant they are that was so shoddy how they paid
[3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:52.960]  for it they admit it's fake I mean they should all go to jail this is crazy well
[3:00:52.960 --> 3:00:57.880]  we'll have our special counsel in a year and hopefully we can pick up all those
[3:00:57.880 --> 3:01:03.360]  loose ends and bring them to justice I was in tears yesterday when I saw the
[3:01:03.360 --> 3:01:10.360]  Republican Congress on the steps there with the president and I mean it's just
[3:01:10.360 --> 3:01:14.800]  an incredible accomplishment it's it's taken you know three decades to bring
[3:01:14.800 --> 3:01:21.880]  this about it was four years but the leader of this whole exercise is a
[3:01:21.880 --> 3:01:27.240]  person that took center stage he shared the stage with many of its authors of
[3:01:27.240 --> 3:01:33.280]  course but without Donald Trump this wouldn't have happened so he also you
[3:01:33.280 --> 3:01:39.960]  know remind your listeners said in the White House and again yesterday it was
[3:01:39.960 --> 3:01:46.680]  that we have probably a decade from the White House you heard them from his own
[3:01:46.680 --> 3:01:50.920]  lips Merry Christmas and again it seems like they make fun of it but they're
[3:01:50.920 --> 3:01:55.360]  trying to ban it everywhere that's what an incredible cult of control freaks
[3:01:55.360 --> 3:02:03.000]  these people are oh they've had this war against Christmas on for you know more
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:07.440]  than two decades and Christmas has become an enormous you know commercial
[3:02:07.440 --> 3:02:12.040]  occasion now so we divorced it pretty much from its religious original
[3:02:12.040 --> 3:02:17.320]  original you know context so I mean where I want to go in this last few
[3:02:17.320 --> 3:02:22.160]  minutes is basically just to remind the listeners that you know my life their
[3:02:22.160 --> 3:02:28.560]  lives are a gift and so to our the goods that come to me and you and the gifts
[3:02:28.560 --> 3:02:32.280]  that we're going to have under our tree in the next few days they come from the
[3:02:32.280 --> 3:02:38.000]  source that granted life and once we see the world in that way which frankly is
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:43.040]  the way of faith then we see the reality of just love and how the world is
[3:02:43.040 --> 3:02:50.120]  ordered and we see its power we see the chain of gift and gratitude spread to
[3:02:50.120 --> 3:02:55.360]  all things and it leads to our own spiritual well-being and we can join to
[3:02:55.360 --> 3:02:59.720]  them and these are not burdensome chains on the contrary I think their
[3:02:59.720 --> 3:03:03.520]  ingredients their main ingredient is actually freedom and by linking to these
[3:03:03.520 --> 3:03:08.280]  chains we receive a benefit far greater than the one exactly I mean you have a
[3:03:08.280 --> 3:03:12.400]  child to take care of them and they take care of you everything is symbiotic in
[3:03:12.400 --> 3:03:17.000]  God's plan you see the incredible it's like all these atheists math mathematicians
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:20.440]  genetic engineers they finally they become masters they go God there's a
[3:03:20.440 --> 3:03:24.840]  God it all works so perfectly and it couldn't just come together by itself
[3:03:24.840 --> 3:03:32.960]  and this is the story of Christmas God gave his only beloved son so that we
[3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:38.720]  could have eternal life and that is of course the greatest gift of all time
[3:03:38.720 --> 3:03:45.680]  it's it's his story it's the great drama of human existence so when we
[3:03:45.680 --> 3:03:52.280]  celebrate the advent this year you should remember that nativity scene we
[3:03:52.280 --> 3:03:58.400]  need to think about that form of gift love of God's grace which is bestowed on
[3:03:58.400 --> 3:04:03.520]  every one of us on his creation in the first instance but to every single one
[3:04:03.520 --> 3:04:07.920]  of us as human beings and then we can have a very blessed Christmas because we
[3:04:07.920 --> 3:04:12.480]  can celebrate the Christ mass I'd explain to somebody the other day that
[3:04:12.480 --> 3:04:18.360]  Christmas actually means if you can believe this Christ mass it does it
[3:04:18.360 --> 3:04:26.000]  means them the mass of Christ's birth and death and risen that's it Christ was
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:32.600]  born in Christmas he had his ministry on earth for a short period of time he
[3:04:32.600 --> 3:04:39.240]  died and ascended into heaven and he takes us there as our final place so you
[3:04:39.240 --> 3:04:43.560]  have to have the whole sweep of that humanity makes it we're going to the
[3:04:43.560 --> 3:04:47.400]  heavens Ted Malick incredible it's all allegory it's all there it's all a

[3:07:02.120 --> 3:07:06.480]  job but I wanted to hit this piece that's on info wars calm and news wars
[3:07:06.480 --> 3:07:13.320]  calm left his students ripped down races Kate Stanley moral boasters you know I
[3:07:13.320 --> 3:07:21.880]  literally got heart palpitations well I've never had those before last couple
[3:07:21.880 --> 3:07:29.680]  weeks ago when Owen shroyer went downtown and men with guns not guns
[3:07:29.680 --> 3:07:34.880]  operating their free speech or their second amendment but men with guns said
[3:07:34.880 --> 3:07:37.800]  you're not going to the capital rally and then blocked him and attacked him
[3:07:37.800 --> 3:07:41.200]  with clubs and you know he's like a Patriots I made a big goal they hit
[3:07:41.200 --> 3:07:44.720]  with clubs would let me in on big deal how you guys are idiots but he was
[3:07:44.720 --> 3:07:51.520]  assaulted and they the Antifa wouldn't let him get in for a Kate Stanley
[3:07:51.520 --> 3:07:56.600]  Memorial for this poor beautiful young woman that lover was just black Hispanic
[3:07:56.600 --> 3:08:04.120]  whatever shot in the back with her father she had dreams too and you've got
[3:08:04.120 --> 3:08:10.200]  this guy who's been deported five times it's like the railway killer he was
[3:08:10.200 --> 3:08:14.320]  deported I forget like 15 times I think he killed like 40-something people all
[3:08:14.320 --> 3:08:18.160]  of them were Hispanic by the way it's not that Hispanics are serial killers or
[3:08:18.160 --> 3:08:22.040]  have a hired the innocence of crime it's that they can go to any cutter they
[3:08:22.040 --> 3:08:25.240]  want and governments just let them in because this global operation to open
[3:08:25.240 --> 3:08:30.200]  up the Americas so this literal lunatic shoots her in the back and then the
[3:08:30.200 --> 3:08:35.720]  jury won't even convict him of manslaughter which would just mean he
[3:08:35.720 --> 3:08:39.120]  didn't know he killed her but still you're liable seven years in jail
[3:08:39.120 --> 3:08:43.560]  California it's like that in most states served like three years maybe two
[3:08:43.560 --> 3:08:49.480]  if you're good behavior maybe one in federal you serve 90% states serve like
[3:08:49.480 --> 3:08:56.240]  a third a half there's video at the college where somebody put up I had
[3:08:56.240 --> 3:09:01.400]  dreams too and again she's a white lady I think she has some Hispanics in her
[3:09:01.400 --> 3:09:05.160]  family it doesn't matter Hispanics are mix of white folks and natives and the
[3:09:05.160 --> 3:09:09.240]  Spanish bloods of some North African doesn't matter we're all humans beautiful
[3:09:09.240 --> 3:09:13.880]  the Spanish women all of them are beautiful everybody's beautiful I love everybody the
[3:09:13.880 --> 3:09:20.440]  point is is that she gets killed out with her daddy eating a snow cone and the
[3:09:20.440 --> 3:09:25.000]  left can't even send the jerk blacked out of a mentally ill put him a mental
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  institution they won't do anything and they say 19 people run over one of them
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:34.840]  they say is basically dead brain dead and they wouldn't say it's a Muslim they
[3:09:34.840 --> 3:09:38.760]  go well it's ISIS but it's mentally ill yeah the Nazis were mentally ill
[3:09:38.760 --> 3:09:44.360]  humans go into these weird things you and you can say other cultures were
[3:09:44.360 --> 3:09:54.360]  mentally ill so they they the killer and then we got video at the university
[3:09:54.360 --> 3:09:59.800]  where they won't even let them put up signs they could put up every other
[3:09:59.800 --> 3:10:03.840]  sign they want kill the cops you name it that's in the article but you can't put
[3:10:03.840 --> 3:10:09.960]  up a sign just saying she had dreams to left the students ripped down racist
[3:10:09.960 --> 3:10:14.320]  cake Stanley Memorial posters to see if they're scared of a martyr and my own
[3:10:14.320 --> 3:10:18.600]  reporters at Austin can't go to a rally for her that was by the way black
[3:10:18.600 --> 3:10:22.480]  Hispanic everybody you name it there's nobody let me tell you something you
[3:10:22.480 --> 3:10:25.200]  try to go to a patriot meeting if you're some white supremacists will kick your
[3:10:25.200 --> 3:10:30.160]  ass and you have your free speech I'm just I'm not doing this because I hate
[3:10:30.160 --> 3:10:37.840]  black people or anybody else I'm doing this because I want justice and the left
[3:10:37.840 --> 3:10:46.440]  is so evil as like a union is like a system that they they will they will
[3:10:46.440 --> 3:10:50.040]  defend anything as long as they're white which again is using race culture
[3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:53.720]  which is very primitive very bad we're fighting Nazism which means we're
[3:10:53.720 --> 3:10:57.200]  fighting this the Nazis were a race culture it works we're primitive we'll
[3:10:57.200 --> 3:11:03.960]  do it well they got the whites in I'm not just being not defending leftist to
[3:11:03.960 --> 3:11:09.480]  say this but it's mainly white people that are engaging in race baiting two
[3:11:09.480 --> 3:11:14.360]  minority groups trying to get them to be racist and they got some blacks to do
[3:11:14.360 --> 3:11:17.880]  it and I guess a small minority Hispanics but I don't want to bash white
[3:11:17.880 --> 3:11:25.000]  people but it's mainly white people you name it Jewish German whatever
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:30.360]  background to push this and you read the Southern Probably Law Center ADL put
[3:11:30.360 --> 3:11:36.640]  out is the most classic racist crap you've ever seen and so now this dead
[3:11:36.640 --> 3:11:39.840]  woman people can't have a rally in Austin forum you can have hand up signs
[3:11:39.840 --> 3:11:43.800]  in San Francisco conservative students continue mourning the death of Kate
[3:11:43.800 --> 3:11:47.640]  Stanley the woman murdered by a legal alien given sanctuary and remember most
[3:11:47.640 --> 3:11:51.120]  these victims were spanning I'm not just saying that to virtue signal that's
[3:11:51.120 --> 3:11:56.080]  just being heard people say oh thank you for caring about a Hispanic person or
[3:11:56.080 --> 3:12:00.600]  black I care about everybody folks just I got feelings in San Francisco a left
[3:12:00.600 --> 3:12:04.840]  of students continues to be triggered by her memory and they again pull down the
[3:12:04.840 --> 3:12:10.360]  the the posters saying it's racist so here they are anti-free speech here's
[3:12:10.360 --> 3:12:12.680]  the video
[3:12:12.680 --> 3:12:19.280]  oh you guys got a problem with the posters you guys got a problem with the
[3:12:19.280 --> 3:12:26.120]  posters yes and what would that be the problem by things you have to put a
[3:12:26.120 --> 3:12:32.320]  quite a racist view point oh James Ovasis now huh this is her white
[3:12:32.320 --> 3:12:35.920]  woman you know I'm not gonna have this conversation with you you're gonna have
[3:12:35.920 --> 3:12:40.800]  that kind of tone so oh my tone I don't want to have a conversation in the first
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:46.560]  place you'd rather care done posters these are women that the state is their
[3:12:46.560 --> 3:12:48.840]  man
[3:12:50.880 --> 3:12:56.920]  so they they take down her picture and notice the jury had most mainly a white
[3:12:56.920 --> 3:13:02.280]  jury they had to say we will not put a Hispanic man in jail because she's white
[3:13:02.280 --> 3:13:08.080]  if he'd been Hispanic he'd have gone to prison because they can't ever say their
[3:13:08.080 --> 3:13:13.520]  policies are wrong and they have to take her picture now so she had dreams too
[3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:21.800]  and she's dead she's in a coffin she's a skeleton now and you know I you're not
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:24.760]  gonna hear one activist you're not gonna hear those liberal white women that
[3:13:24.760 --> 3:13:27.760]  want to just act like they're on this big job and they live in this little
[3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:31.200]  fantasy land University where they can do this probably but they both look like
[3:13:31.200 --> 3:13:39.360]  professors or assistant professors most the antifa is did they say hey Hispanics
[3:13:39.360 --> 3:13:46.560]  hate that words just people you shouldn't take Gardasil it sterilizes and
[3:13:46.560 --> 3:13:52.840]  reduces fertility massively here's the studies and they in Mexico tied IMF and
[3:13:52.840 --> 3:13:58.160]  World Bank money billions of dollars to giving Hispanic women Gardasil and then
[3:13:58.160 --> 3:14:01.800]  it sterilizes them it reduces their fertility doesn't completely sterilize
[3:14:01.800 --> 3:14:06.600]  them it's statistical but it reduces it and I have people go hey man I've had
[3:14:06.600 --> 3:14:10.360]  this a few times like not with white people even but but it's like they go
[3:14:10.360 --> 3:14:15.880]  hey if you're worried about all them Mexicans or whatever why are you they're
[3:14:15.880 --> 3:14:19.640]  just people I'm gonna put with Mexicans being racist against me don't like me
[3:14:19.640 --> 3:14:24.080]  because I'm quote white even though I'm part Native American I can say
[3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:28.640]  statistically you know I'm Hispanic that's all that means I don't want them
[3:14:28.640 --> 3:14:33.880]  to get screwed me nobody I just want a future together we can all by the time
[3:14:33.880 --> 3:14:37.680]  we reach 50 light years from here we'll all just be basically a nice medium

[3:14:41.440 --> 3:14:45.360]  right now God gives us a choice I think it's 5050 where we blow the whole
[3:14:45.360 --> 3:14:49.920]  planet up and you know God will just start back over again but God Almighty

[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:58.320]  Gardasil shot I'd say maybe Mitchell or Raza is a good group but they don't
[3:14:58.320 --> 3:15:01.760]  because they're bought and paid for they want to make you dumb racist to

[3:20:27.000 --> 3:20:31.760]  of course very Christmas happy new year to everybody over there over here at
[3:20:31.760 --> 3:20:40.520]  Infowars I was listening to Alex before this for the past probably a half hour
[3:20:40.520 --> 3:20:49.720]  my god my god that the Kate Steinal debacle over there in California it's
[3:20:49.720 --> 3:21:00.320]  heart-wrenching and infuriating just the sheer anger that you feel looking at
[3:21:00.320 --> 3:21:06.400]  something like this from beginning to end the second we heard that she was
[3:21:06.400 --> 3:21:16.320]  murdered right there in front of her dad I mean just a beautiful creative
[3:21:16.320 --> 3:21:23.720]  contributing member of society and it's rare that we see that in in the news
[3:21:23.720 --> 3:21:29.240]  that there's people that actually are doing something and and have a family
[3:21:29.240 --> 3:21:36.640]  structure she's out with her dad how how much more American can you get just a
[3:21:36.640 --> 3:21:43.760]  dad out with his daughter beautiful day out by the water it's it's a it's just
[3:21:43.760 --> 3:21:50.600]  such an affront to everything that we hold dear to us in this country and her
[3:21:50.600 --> 3:21:56.880]  life is snuffed out by someone that shouldn't even have been in this
[3:21:56.880 --> 3:22:05.760]  country it's so easy to see it's so simple for any rational human being to
[3:22:05.760 --> 3:22:11.120]  see the good and the bad in this the right and the wrong the just and the
[3:22:11.120 --> 3:22:17.920]  unjust that we see in this entire story from the moment she was she was killed
[3:22:17.920 --> 3:22:27.960]  until this very second it's not difficult for somebody that has a rational
[3:22:27.960 --> 3:22:42.640]  thought process to see what's wrong here yet he he's not convicted of like
[3:22:42.640 --> 3:22:50.160]  Alex said even manslaughter you pick up a gun and it accidentally discharges and
[3:22:50.160 --> 3:22:56.040]  goes into somebody there's a pretty good case for manslaughter there and that was
[3:22:56.040 --> 3:23:04.120]  the defense saying that's what happened you know and they don't even convict him
[3:23:04.120 --> 3:23:13.960]  of that based on what evidence now it's based on a thought process and a system
[3:23:13.960 --> 3:23:24.360]  over there in California and especially the Bay Area that says that that woman's
[3:23:24.360 --> 3:23:33.720]  life was not worth as much as the life of somebody who was deported five times
[3:23:33.720 --> 3:23:43.160]  obviously a criminal and they let him go because of that this was based on race
[3:23:43.160 --> 3:23:53.960]  and culture and social status all of it the the idea of of justice and weighing
[3:23:53.960 --> 3:24:01.960]  evidence and and doling out punishment for crimes committed had nothing to do
[3:24:01.960 --> 3:24:11.080]  with this the legal proceedings in this case it was all politically motivated all
[3:24:11.080 --> 3:24:17.720]  motivated by the the the liberal agenda in California and especially up there in
[3:24:17.720 --> 3:24:24.160]  the Bay Area and we saw the result of that is the entire country like this
[3:24:24.160 --> 3:24:34.760]  thank God no but there are many areas in this country that are completely the
[3:24:34.760 --> 3:24:41.880]  opposite of what America is supposed to be about and when we come around we get
[3:24:41.880 --> 3:24:48.920]  around to Christmas time which we are the the Christmas season we we get
[3:24:48.920 --> 3:24:55.640]  nostalgic and we start looking back to our our youth and and remembering what
[3:24:55.640 --> 3:25:02.440]  America was back then what celebrating Christmas was how much it was all about
[3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:12.080]  family and common values in this country a common culture the idea that we all
[3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:20.240]  know as Americans what's right what's wrong what's good what's bad that made
[3:25:20.240 --> 3:25:26.960]  this country the place that people did want to come to because the population
[3:25:26.960 --> 3:25:31.200]  of this country and for the most part believe me I know there's been lunatics
[3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:39.200]  and fringes in America since its inception but overall when you think back
[3:25:39.200 --> 3:25:49.240]  to America you think back to a time when there was a common thread through its
[3:25:49.240 --> 3:25:56.080]  people a pride there's a pride in your nation in in living in a place that is
[3:25:56.080 --> 3:26:03.440]  so amazing that people die trying to get here and that's what held it together
[3:26:03.440 --> 3:26:08.160]  that's what held the country together because no matter how different we are
[3:26:08.160 --> 3:26:14.440]  and when they talk about diversity it's our differences but we need a common
[3:26:14.440 --> 3:26:21.600]  factor in there and that's what made us Americans and that common factor was a
[3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:31.360]  basic value system and an ideology that we all held dear and when you look at a
[3:26:31.360 --> 3:26:36.440]  case like Kate Steinal and see that there is a portion of this country
[3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:43.280]  willing to throw all that away they don't want to be a part of the commonality
[3:26:43.280 --> 3:26:51.640]  and thread throughout the American people that made this country a a cohesive
[3:26:51.640 --> 3:26:57.000]  unit because no matter where you come from and what your culture is and what
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:27:02.320]  you brought from the land that you came from or that your ancestors came from to
[3:27:02.320 --> 3:27:10.400]  this country the one thing that that brought it all together that made us
[3:27:10.400 --> 3:27:19.520]  enjoy different foods and different interests and activities religions was
[3:27:19.520 --> 3:27:24.800]  that we were all doing it here in in this amazing country where we weren't
[3:27:24.800 --> 3:27:30.640]  supposed to be persecuted for those things and those ideas where there was a
[3:27:30.640 --> 3:27:36.160]  distinction between good and bad and what you should be doing and shouldn't be
[3:27:36.160 --> 3:27:44.160]  doing in this country that is really going to the wayside and and that's the
[3:27:44.160 --> 3:27:49.240]  thing that people like myself and Alex and so many other people that call
[3:27:49.240 --> 3:27:55.080]  themselves patriots and and to to the laughter of certain people when you say
[3:27:55.080 --> 3:28:00.760]  you're a patriot and you're proud of your country people laugh at that and joke
[3:28:00.760 --> 3:28:08.120]  about it while the whole thing seems to be swirling down the toilet it's because
[3:28:08.120 --> 3:28:15.200]  we have that we remember that we enjoyed it I enjoy thinking back and when you
[3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:19.480]  say make America great again people laugh at that oh Trump's little call sign
[3:28:19.480 --> 3:28:24.800]  no there was a greatness and it had nothing to do with the race or white
[3:28:24.800 --> 3:28:30.480]  supremacy it had to do with that common thread that runs through us as
[3:28:30.480 --> 3:28:35.360]  Americans and always has that ran through that that that makes you do things
[3:28:35.360 --> 3:28:43.320]  for the greater good Americans and if we don't realize that very quickly we're
[3:28:43.320 --> 3:28:48.440]  doomed as a once great nation gonna be back in a matter of moments don't go

[3:34:41.520 --> 3:34:46.600]  this is my last broadcast here until the new year so I want to talk a little bit
[3:34:46.600 --> 3:34:54.600]  about about Christmas I was saying just before that break I get a bit nostalgic
[3:34:54.600 --> 3:35:01.160]  I think everybody does when you think of Christmas it's one of those it's one of
[3:35:01.160 --> 3:35:08.240]  those times of the year when you reflect on your youth it was such a big part of
[3:35:08.240 --> 3:35:16.520]  of being a kid your parents family friends and you tend to remember all the
[3:35:16.520 --> 3:35:24.560]  good things when you think back and wax fantastic about days gone by but I think
[3:35:24.560 --> 3:35:28.520]  it truly is one of those times a year where you do remember a lot of good
[3:35:28.520 --> 3:35:37.640]  things that that actually happened and I recall Christmas back I guess it was the
[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:44.760]  70s I could even remember people late 60s I do remember late 60s maybe first
[3:35:44.760 --> 3:35:51.560]  inklings of of thought process of your pal Anthony was probably 67 68 I
[3:35:51.560 --> 3:35:57.640]  remember I remember things like the Apollo program and used to go to the
[3:35:57.640 --> 3:36:02.240]  gas station with my dad and they would give away they would give away these
[3:36:02.240 --> 3:36:07.280]  little lunar modules that you'd put together like a little model and oh I
[3:36:07.280 --> 3:36:14.040]  loved that I loved the space program and the pride it brought everyone here in
[3:36:14.040 --> 3:36:19.880]  the United States of America just those things from back then and and like I
[3:36:19.880 --> 3:36:23.840]  said before the break when when you say make America great again and people see
[3:36:23.840 --> 3:36:31.680]  hashtag MAGA and and you get this these people that laugh at it or call it
[3:36:31.680 --> 3:36:38.760]  racist or sexist oh you want to go back to this time when people didn't have
[3:36:38.760 --> 3:36:47.320]  rights and people are being beaten in the streets and the no no every country
[3:36:47.320 --> 3:36:54.720]  no matter how great it is has had a period of time that people were being
[3:36:54.720 --> 3:37:02.200]  plagued by injustice doesn't matter how great the country was at the time there
[3:37:02.200 --> 3:37:09.280]  were always problems nothing's perfect and no no one is talking about making
[3:37:09.280 --> 3:37:18.920]  America great again by returning to injustices and nightmares of civil
[3:37:18.920 --> 3:37:24.920]  rights infringements and and whatnot no but when you say make America great
[3:37:24.920 --> 3:37:30.880]  again you're talking about a greatness of the people of this country and and
[3:37:30.880 --> 3:37:37.600]  what I said before about a cohesive people not everyone thinking the same
[3:37:37.600 --> 3:37:43.600]  but just having a common thread of being American and being proud of being
[3:37:43.600 --> 3:37:49.080]  American and who you are your culture your background everything that that your
[3:37:49.080 --> 3:37:56.280]  ancestors brought here is part of what makes this country America and I'm
[3:37:56.280 --> 3:38:01.440]  thinking back at Christmas and and I remember coming into New York City as a
[3:38:01.440 --> 3:38:09.600]  kid during Christmas with my family and it was just an amazing thing the way
[3:38:09.600 --> 3:38:16.000]  the city is decorated and no matter how repulsive New York can be there
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:20.720]  there tended to be this niceness that went along with it people were in there
[3:38:20.720 --> 3:38:25.040]  from the suburbs just seeing what what New York City was like at Christmas time
[3:38:25.040 --> 3:38:31.360]  very romantic it's been portrayed in so many movies and whatnot and then I walk
[3:38:31.360 --> 3:38:39.040]  around now and I try to weigh some of the differences because as you know
[3:38:39.040 --> 3:38:44.680]  Christmas in certain parts of the country is a bad word it's not inclusive
[3:38:44.680 --> 3:38:53.520]  enough it's racist it's Islamophobic it's so many terrible things and and as I
[3:38:53.520 --> 3:38:58.480]  say when I hearken back to my youth I just remember it as being great being
[3:38:58.480 --> 3:39:03.360]  just an amazing time you're off of school you're gonna get presents your
[3:39:03.360 --> 3:39:10.440]  family is there there's a little bit more niceness in the streets so walk
[3:39:10.440 --> 3:39:20.400]  around now and what do I say I see soldiers with automatic weapons I see
[3:39:20.400 --> 3:39:29.240]  cement barriers that are set up everywhere to protect people that are
[3:39:29.240 --> 3:39:34.320]  just trying to shop and and walk around and enjoy the sights and see the tree
[3:39:34.320 --> 3:39:40.680]  here and celebrate Christmas signs everywhere see something say something
[3:39:40.680 --> 3:39:50.680]  there's there's an overhanging threat a black cloud hovering over Christmas now
[3:39:50.680 --> 3:39:59.560]  everywhere and this is an exclusive to New York this is every city London you
[3:39:59.560 --> 3:40:04.480]  see these same barriers and look they paint them red and white like they're
[3:40:04.480 --> 3:40:11.520]  supposed to like they're supposed to be festive this is a constant reminder that
[3:40:11.520 --> 3:40:20.280]  there are people out there and cultures out there that want us dead and want our
[3:40:20.280 --> 3:40:28.000]  traditions wiped from the face of the earth including yes of course Christmas
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:35.680]  there's people in this very country that sympathize with that that also want our
[3:40:35.680 --> 3:40:45.360]  traditions and cultures wiped away when when when you used to come in to a big
[3:40:45.360 --> 3:40:49.480]  city and celebrate Christmas at least like I said when I was a kid back in the
[3:40:49.480 --> 3:40:57.660]  late 60s early 70s you only thought about Christmas and and how much
[3:40:57.660 --> 3:41:02.880]  fun it was and to walk around now and see the tree and the decorations and
[3:41:02.880 --> 3:41:08.720]  everything it seemed to be that you still capture a little of that but when you
[3:41:08.720 --> 3:41:14.640]  see men walking around various branches of the military and the police forces
[3:41:14.640 --> 3:41:19.960]  walking around with automatic weapons it's a constant reminder and that's it's
[3:41:19.960 --> 3:41:24.480]  just a sad thing that we need to be constantly reminded even at this time
[3:41:24.480 --> 3:41:29.440]  of year that there are cultures that want to eliminate everything that we
[3:41:29.440 --> 3:41:37.040]  hold dear and that is a tradition there you go that's that's great and that's a
[3:41:37.040 --> 3:41:46.680]  tradition to America that that that one of the many traditions that we built
[3:41:46.680 --> 3:41:53.920]  this country on and that separates us from other countries and other cultures
[3:41:53.920 --> 3:42:00.820]  you hear liberals constantly saying live and let live let's be tolerant we
[3:42:00.820 --> 3:42:11.440]  must accept this and that well why are traditional American traditions the
[3:42:11.440 --> 3:42:17.600]  thing that can be sacrificed with impunity and the second you start
[3:42:17.600 --> 3:42:23.120]  defending them you are either a racist or homophobic or Islamophobic is
[3:42:23.120 --> 3:42:29.880]  something some kind of phobic or ist when you're only defending traditions
[3:42:29.880 --> 3:42:36.600]  that you remember and that were great when I think back to this country the
[3:42:36.600 --> 3:42:42.160]  traditional Christmas with your family going out on in the city and and seeing
[3:42:42.160 --> 3:42:47.440]  all the amazing things as a kid can we get back to that I have no idea be back

[3:49:02.920 --> 3:49:09.480]  progressives trying to destroy our traditions it is amazing
[3:49:09.480 --> 3:49:17.720]  Christmas is a holiday that is just fair game fair game for anyone any group
[3:49:17.720 --> 3:49:25.080]  that wants to trot upon it trounce it denounce it twist it and turn it till it's
[3:49:25.080 --> 3:49:32.800]  barely recognizable to the offense of people that hold it dear as a tradition
[3:49:32.800 --> 3:49:40.120]  to them but again people that celebrate Christmas traditionally through through
[3:49:40.120 --> 3:49:44.880]  the liberal left what we've seen from progressives are the most intolerant
[3:49:44.880 --> 3:49:51.320]  people so intolerant yet they happen to be the most tolerant people ever because
[3:49:51.320 --> 3:50:00.320]  no one's rioting when when these people just trounce on on our traditions you
[3:50:00.320 --> 3:50:05.200]  don't see riots you don't see people murdering or beating people in the
[3:50:05.200 --> 3:50:11.600]  streets because we've we've been offended by some of these things I'm gonna
[3:50:11.600 --> 3:50:17.760]  tell you a little story here and I want you to to insert Mohammed in here or
[3:50:17.760 --> 3:50:25.720]  Islam or or any other religion really CNN was hyping a new children's book and
[3:50:25.720 --> 3:50:34.880]  that adorable a children's book about Santa this is great right yeah we suppose
[3:50:34.880 --> 3:50:39.640]  there's supposed to be some sort of shock factor involved in learning there's a
[3:50:39.640 --> 3:50:48.520]  children's book called Santa's husband in which Santa is black and gay but
[3:50:48.520 --> 3:50:52.960]  frankly now that we're aware of it we'd be more surprised if there wasn't such a
[3:50:52.960 --> 3:51:00.040]  thing would we would we be more surprised if there wasn't such a thing as
[3:51:00.040 --> 3:51:10.800]  Santa's husband where Santa is black and gay after seeing the gaitivity scene
[3:51:10.800 --> 3:51:23.840]  with two Joseph's the gaitivity scene why why do they always pick these
[3:51:23.840 --> 3:51:32.880]  Christianity whenever a group wants to crap all over a religion it will always
[3:51:32.880 --> 3:51:44.080]  be Christianity and and the the traditional holidays and services figures
[3:51:44.080 --> 3:51:51.760]  religious figures of Christianity constantly they are able to make Santa
[3:51:51.760 --> 3:51:59.880]  Joseph gay change their race make them gay which would be an affront to oh my
[3:51:59.880 --> 3:52:04.760]  god could you imagine look I don't know if this is proper to say but just imagine
[3:52:04.760 --> 3:52:12.600]  you did whole Mohammed do you think that would fly do you think everyone
[3:52:12.600 --> 3:52:18.320]  involved with doing something like that would need to strap on Kevlar to go to
[3:52:18.320 --> 3:52:26.200]  work every day lest they be gunned down or blown up I do I absolutely do you
[3:52:26.200 --> 3:52:34.160]  know why intolerance we talk about or the progressives talk about Christianity
[3:52:34.160 --> 3:52:38.840]  and and Christmas and all of the holidays pretty much and and our
[3:52:38.840 --> 3:52:46.920]  traditions and basic values of Christianity as being intolerant yet
[3:52:46.920 --> 3:52:54.240]  when our religion and our culture and value system gets crapped on we just
[3:52:54.240 --> 3:53:00.760]  take it we literally turn the other cheek complain about it talk about it
[3:53:00.760 --> 3:53:07.960]  that is our right that is our right but do we take to the streets do we destroy
[3:53:07.960 --> 3:53:12.960]  property do we assault people do we murder people because of it no because
[3:53:12.960 --> 3:53:19.920]  we are tolerant it's another one of these crazy backward world things that go
[3:53:19.920 --> 3:53:27.480]  on when you talk about progressives it's just a grave intolerance going on we
[3:53:27.480 --> 3:53:32.760]  all remember Charlie Hebdo oh boy were they in Dutch when they tried to talk
[3:53:32.760 --> 3:53:40.800]  about Islam yet Christianity can just be used and abused by people the
[3:53:40.800 --> 3:53:46.320]  gaitivity scene I've never I've never heard of the gaitivity scene and now I'm
[3:53:46.320 --> 3:53:53.040]  just hearing about Santa being gay and black there is that the gaitivity scene
[3:53:53.040 --> 3:54:02.720]  now any other religion using any other religious figures in this way I would I
[3:54:02.720 --> 3:54:10.160]  would say that that house would be in flames in no time but they're able to
[3:54:10.160 --> 3:54:14.400]  do this they practice their freedom of expression on their own property and
[3:54:14.400 --> 3:54:21.540]  they get complaints they get people like myself and other people in independent
[3:54:21.540 --> 3:54:26.880]  media that might criticize it but no one's going over there and kicking it
[3:54:26.880 --> 3:54:33.920]  over or throwing a Molotov cocktail through their window because the the
[3:54:33.920 --> 3:54:39.640]  progressives version of the most intolerant people are the most tolerant
[3:54:39.640 --> 3:54:46.240]  people topsy-turvy backward world that we live in I must talk quickly about Rosie
[3:54:46.240 --> 3:54:52.840]  O'Donnell the the giant gift that keeps giving Rosie O'Donnell she's lost her
[3:54:52.840 --> 3:54:58.960]  mind since Trump even said he was running for president a few years back
[3:54:58.960 --> 3:55:03.400]  her and Donald Trump were in a bit of a battle when he was still with the
[3:55:03.400 --> 3:55:11.680]  apprentice and she was so angry with Donald Trump's tax plan that looks like
[3:55:11.680 --> 3:55:19.120]  it will come to fruition that she offered two senators two million dollars
[3:55:19.120 --> 3:55:28.120]  each to vote no on it to vote no this is a crime there it is she promises they
[3:55:28.120 --> 3:55:31.840]  have a two million to senator Susan Collins and two million to senator Jake
[3:55:31.840 --> 3:55:41.080]  Flake to vote no on the tax bill two million dollars apparently this is
[3:55:41.080 --> 3:55:46.440]  against the 18 US code 201 criminalizing the attempt of bribery of federal
[3:55:46.440 --> 3:55:54.040]  officials by whoever and apparently you will be fined three times the amount of
[3:55:54.040 --> 3:56:04.480]  the bribe so she could be fined twelve million dollars and go to prison for
[3:56:04.480 --> 3:56:12.480]  doing this she's insane much like the progressive left is insane but I I give
[3:56:12.480 --> 3:56:15.840]  her one pass and it's like my good friend Michael Malice said on my show
[3:56:15.840 --> 3:56:22.280]  yesterday think about it this is a guy that called her fat called her a slob
[3:56:22.280 --> 3:56:28.520]  said that if she doesn't watch her step he will take her girlfriend away and
[3:56:28.520 --> 3:56:34.720]  believe me I can do it Trump said all these things hilarious hilarious that
[3:56:34.720 --> 3:56:42.080]  guy is now the president imagine somebody that is you and perceived as
[3:56:42.080 --> 3:56:46.880]  bullying you over over the years and calling you horrible things and not
[3:56:46.880 --> 3:56:53.520]  only do do they get away with it they become the leader of the free world so
[3:56:53.520 --> 3:57:04.520]  I almost give Rosie O'Donnell a pass on on her insanity the rest of the left I

[3:57:10.960 --> 3:57:16.600]  hope some branch of the judicial system goes after Rosie O'Donnell for offering
[3:57:16.600 --> 3:57:26.080]  millions of dollars in bribery to senators to vote no on a bill that a
[3:57:26.080 --> 3:57:33.240]  legally elected president and Congress voted on she's out of her mind thank
