[00:00.000 --> 00:07.440]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[00:07.440 --> 00:09.680]  a war on for your mind.
[00:09.680 --> 00:33.400]  It's the 11th day of July 2016, 7-Eleven.
[00:33.400 --> 00:37.000]  We're gonna be live here for the next four hours, we have no guests because I wanted to
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.240]  clear the decks out so that we have a chance to really get into what's happening in the
[00:42.240 --> 00:49.560]  world today, not just economically but culturally, and break down all the latest developments
[00:49.560 --> 00:53.360]  that are unfolding here in the United States as well.
[00:53.360 --> 01:00.160]  I'm your host Alex Jones, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00.160 --> 01:05.920]  There is incredible technology news, there is amazing robotics news, there is over the
[01:05.920 --> 01:14.960]  top global government news, there's Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, 2016 news, there's
[01:14.960 --> 01:23.720]  major nuclear news, why I've got a BBC article here saying that radiation wasn't so bad
[01:23.720 --> 01:30.400]  after all and Fukushima isn't a problem, that's even better than the one I heard about
[01:30.400 --> 01:37.440]  Obamacare being free, there's more police departments than police being shot around
[01:37.440 --> 01:45.680]  the country, oh there's plenty to talk about dealing with black lives matter, but as a
[01:45.680 --> 01:54.080]  backdrop to all of this, I just want to make the point that humanity is in a deepening
[01:54.080 --> 02:06.880]  crisis, biologically, culturally, spiritually.
[02:06.880 --> 02:14.080]  We have lost our human identity by design and I was sitting back last night before I
[02:14.080 --> 02:16.760]  went to bed and then at about 3.30 in the morning when I woke up and couldn't sleep
[02:16.760 --> 02:28.760]  for about an hour, with just the profound understanding that the evil forces running
[02:28.760 --> 02:36.600]  our planet are out to get the species itself, everything they do and their own textbooks
[02:36.600 --> 02:42.600]  and their own white papers and their own statements are about how bad humanity is and how we've
[02:42.600 --> 02:50.160]  got to be cold, reduced or completely exterminated and this is being said and pushed by fellow
[02:50.160 --> 03:04.440]  humans and they just undermine real clean technology, they undermine real innovation,
[03:04.440 --> 03:15.960]  everything they end up giving us is some twisted aberration filled with Trojan horses
[03:15.960 --> 03:21.960]  and I'm not being negative saying this, I'm being honest, the positive point here is that
[03:21.960 --> 03:28.720]  we know, the globalists are the enemy of humanity, we know whoever they are and whatever
[03:28.720 --> 03:45.280]  runs them, the devil, some mass psychotic psychic link of evil, I don't know, all I know is
[03:45.280 --> 03:51.160]  they're working around the clock to sabotage civilization, not just to be able to manage
[03:51.160 --> 04:04.400]  and control it but because they like seeing poverty and collapse and ignorance and failure.
[04:04.400 --> 04:10.280]  There is a war going on against humanity just as the Bible says the devil comes to
[04:10.280 --> 04:19.520]  kill, steal and destroy and is the author of lies and I look at our world system and
[04:19.520 --> 04:29.440]  I tell you if there isn't a physical entity, an interdimensional entity, a creature, a
[04:29.440 --> 04:42.200]  group of creatures, if that doesn't exist, then it's about to exist because if you look
[04:42.200 --> 04:47.640]  at the genetic engineering and all the chimeras and what's going on, aliens by the thousands
[04:47.640 --> 04:56.160]  a week are being produced by the technocrats on the earth right now and they've already
[04:56.160 --> 05:26.120]  got AI which is a new life form.
[05:26.120 --> 05:35.240]  And that's exactly what the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton want to do.
[05:35.240 --> 05:39.600]  As we previously reported, President Obama is fueling racial tensions between African
[05:39.600 --> 05:43.960]  Americans and the police to justify a federal takeover of local law enforcement.
[05:43.960 --> 05:46.920]  Do you really want a police officer to pull you over on the side of the road and arrest
[05:46.920 --> 05:50.120]  you for a federal law that originated from the UN?
[05:50.120 --> 05:53.400]  Expansion of federal control will only lead to an expansion of the police state, which
[05:53.400 --> 05:56.320]  is exact opposite of what the protesters want.
[06:23.400 --> 06:30.160]  or call 888-253-3139 to order your ProMax shower filter from ProPure today.
[06:30.160 --> 06:33.640]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[06:33.640 --> 06:38.760]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[06:38.760 --> 06:42.040]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[06:42.040 --> 06:47.320]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[06:47.320 --> 06:49.840]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[06:49.840 --> 06:52.240]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[07:00.320 --> 07:05.080]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously
[07:05.080 --> 07:08.480]  low price, you were not going to want to miss this important message.
[07:08.480 --> 07:09.480]  Here's why.
[07:09.480 --> 07:13.480]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse.
[07:13.480 --> 07:14.480]  So please listen.
[07:14.480 --> 07:18.080]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[07:18.080 --> 07:21.080]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently.
[07:21.080 --> 07:24.480]  Amid no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun.
[07:24.480 --> 07:29.400]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[07:29.400 --> 07:31.800]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[07:31.800 --> 07:34.480]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[07:34.480 --> 07:39.080]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators and they're
[07:39.080 --> 07:43.600]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low
[07:43.600 --> 07:45.680]  price for info wars listeners.
[07:45.680 --> 07:47.400]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[07:47.400 --> 07:49.160]  Go to gridwars.com.
[07:49.160 --> 07:50.840]  That's gridwars.com.
[07:50.840 --> 07:54.720]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[07:54.720 --> 07:56.320]  Go to gridwars.com.
[07:56.320 --> 08:24.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[08:24.400 --> 08:47.560]  This is Alex Jones.
[08:47.560 --> 08:57.000]  Trying to communicate with people that have been brought up from birth, drinking deadly
[08:57.000 --> 09:07.160]  formula, fluoride and GMO foods, trying to communicate with populations that have been
[09:07.160 --> 09:15.000]  completely reprogrammed by the television and reprogrammed by their computer screens
[09:15.000 --> 09:28.760]  and to actually see the general population slipping into more and more of a trance state
[09:28.760 --> 09:37.920]  is quite frankly incredible in how horrifying it is.
[09:37.920 --> 09:44.160]  And I'm now 100% sure and a lot of other people are starting to point this out now
[09:44.160 --> 09:51.720]  that young people, old people, you name it, suddenly have trouble talking now.
[09:51.720 --> 09:58.480]  Most people cannot write an email that is it full of typos.
[09:58.480 --> 10:03.600]  Most people have no attention span suddenly.
[10:03.600 --> 10:12.520]  And all of the degeneration of our society is now basically compounding on itself and
[10:12.520 --> 10:24.680]  we are seeing the soul of humanity being sucked out right now.
[10:24.680 --> 10:32.320]  And because I feel a connection to humanity, it's so horrifying I catch myself almost wishing
[10:32.320 --> 10:37.240]  that my consciousness would be taken away and I've never felt like this until the last
[10:37.240 --> 10:47.160]  year because it's so painful to see even really smart awake people starting to dim.
[10:47.160 --> 10:52.440]  And then I can tell over the next few years they're going to be gone too.
[10:52.440 --> 10:58.760]  And then God forbid my children, oh my God, oh my God, I don't know what the globalists
[10:58.760 --> 10:59.760]  are.
[10:59.760 --> 11:06.240]  Well, I do know what they're up to and it's anti-human, it's super evil and it's so sophisticated,
[11:06.240 --> 11:09.360]  it's hard to believe it's directed by our fellow humans.
[11:09.360 --> 11:18.720]  And I say that more and more on air because that's just where I'm coming from, it's bad.
[11:18.720 --> 11:27.960]  Now if I was the globalist and this goes back 10 years and I had viral compounds that are
[11:27.960 --> 11:42.200]  basically nanotech that can go in and do basically micro lobotomies in certain nerve center structures
[11:42.200 --> 11:52.240]  of the brain and I wanted to end free will and I wanted to incrementally take over.
[11:52.240 --> 11:57.880]  I would slowly poison the population, slowly dumb them down, slowly put out this information,
[11:57.880 --> 12:02.880]  slowly confuse them intellectually, spiritually, culturally.
[12:02.880 --> 12:08.880]  And then I would just start titrating the dose up, increasing the level of the poison
[12:08.880 --> 12:12.320]  as more and more of the public falls to it.
[12:12.320 --> 12:18.960]  Those that haven't yet fallen completely to it are still somewhat numb and our other fellow
[12:18.960 --> 12:21.080]  humans around us are sick.
[12:21.080 --> 12:29.400]  Humans tend to, quote, adapt and overcome to just accept hardship and war and bad things
[12:29.400 --> 12:36.280]  happening around them because long term you would just come out of it by surviving it.
[12:36.280 --> 12:42.280]  But this you don't survive because it's incremental and from all angles and designed to quietly
[12:42.280 --> 12:47.680]  strangle you over the years, a soft kill.
[12:47.680 --> 12:54.040]  And we've talked a lot about this but intellectually when they started coming out and saying soon
[12:54.040 --> 12:59.120]  there'll be anti-stress vaccines, soon there'll be anti-depression vaccines, soon there'll
[12:59.120 --> 13:04.720]  be anti-PTSD vaccines, all I went and looked them up and they weren't vaccines, they were
[13:04.720 --> 13:10.280]  live viruses that are basically engineered so they're artificial, they're nanotech.
[13:10.280 --> 13:23.040]  They self-replicate themselves off your tissue, off of your cell engines and they're now
[13:23.040 --> 13:29.720]  been testing and on trips for five or six years and testing and on other people and
[13:29.720 --> 13:33.400]  folks describe, oh yeah, he used to be really angry and upset now, he just comes home and
[13:33.400 --> 13:40.400]  watches TV and does whatever he's told, in fact it's weird, Bob, it's like he's not even
[13:40.400 --> 13:41.400]  there.
[13:41.400 --> 13:44.160]  And if I was the globalist, I'd go ahead with aerial spray and the rest of it, I'd go ahead
[13:44.160 --> 13:48.040]  and through the pharmacological crops, you know, for decades they've had bananas and
[13:48.040 --> 13:51.680]  tomatoes and things, they can have actually grow the vaccine as part of their cellular
[13:51.680 --> 13:58.120]  activity so that you're unable to escape it, I would deploy that against the public.
[13:58.120 --> 14:02.000]  And I know they have it, they admit they have it, I shot a video like eight years ago,
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  a warning of it called brain-eating vaccines, I gave it kind of a hollywoodish term hoping
[14:06.000 --> 14:15.120]  that that would somehow get people to go look at it and find out about it.
[14:15.120 --> 14:18.040]  I mean this is the fall of civilization.
[14:18.040 --> 14:20.640]  This is the fall of the species by design we're seeing.
[14:20.640 --> 14:26.600]  This isn't all our modern technologies compounded and we're kind of poisoned and having a problem,
[14:26.600 --> 14:32.360]  we've already worked through that, we've already been through that before.
[14:32.360 --> 14:44.200]  No, this is scientifically implemented and they admit they're implementing it.
[14:44.200 --> 14:46.880]  And there are hundreds of different ways they're heading us, we should probably have Dr. Nick
[14:46.880 --> 14:51.720]  Beggach on to talk about this more in the future but he's one of the chief chroniclers
[14:51.720 --> 14:55.120]  of these technologies, they're admitted and patented and been tested and been deployed
[14:55.120 --> 15:08.160]  and they're just trying to get the public at this point prepared and ready to not have
[15:08.160 --> 15:18.840]  empathy for each other as we see the slow ongoing rot of civilization so that we don't
[15:18.840 --> 15:23.120]  try to reverse any of it and so we don't try to find out why it's happening or who's
[15:23.120 --> 15:29.840]  directing and who is exempting themselves from it.
[15:29.840 --> 15:34.840]  The globalist to a great extent have tried to carry this out against us but exempt themselves
[15:34.840 --> 15:41.840]  from it and they argue that even if they end up getting burned by it, it's for the greater
[15:41.840 --> 15:53.760]  good to end the parasite that is humanity so if this new synthetic silicon based God
[15:53.760 --> 16:01.720]  can rise up out of our ashes and see they don't even have vice or the New York Times
[16:01.720 --> 16:05.720]  or all the trendy publications make fun of me anymore for that.
[16:05.720 --> 16:10.640]  I talk about it 20 years ago, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, 8 years ago and it was all big
[16:10.640 --> 16:14.600]  joke when I had the quotes in my films and video clips of them saying it and their white
[16:14.600 --> 16:15.600]  papers.
[16:15.600 --> 16:16.600]  It was all a big joke.
[16:16.600 --> 16:19.840]  This crazy man says the elite are going to merge with machines and then wipe out the
[16:19.840 --> 16:21.240]  rest of us.
[16:21.240 --> 16:24.760]  Now you turn on history channel, discovery channel, you read what Ray Kurzweil saying,
[16:24.760 --> 16:28.360]  you read what all these big globalists are saying, what all the trendies are saying,
[16:28.360 --> 16:36.120]  what all the trendy podcasts are saying, this is all being admitted and then a lot of Hollywood
[16:36.120 --> 16:39.960]  stars and people, they think they're going to be part of this if they just go along with
[16:39.960 --> 16:45.600]  it, it's pretty grim.
[16:45.600 --> 16:53.920]  And then I sit back knowing the history of secret testing that's been declassified, thousands
[16:53.920 --> 17:01.240]  of different programs, in some cases each program exposing tens of thousands, if not
[17:01.240 --> 17:08.920]  hundreds of thousands and killing thousands, each program and that's what they decided
[17:08.920 --> 17:13.400]  to tell us about.
[17:13.400 --> 17:19.360]  And then you want me to take a vaccine when the insert says it can kill me or give me
[17:19.360 --> 17:24.560]  hundreds of different disorders and I can go do the research, work and find out where
[17:24.560 --> 17:31.640]  they produced it and I know the UN's been caught adding cancer viruses, adding steroids,
[17:31.640 --> 17:43.200]  I mean these are facts people and I look at the numbers of neurological disorders in cancer
[17:43.200 --> 17:51.520]  and everything, I don't care what color you are, the numbers are all straight up for everybody.
[17:51.520 --> 17:55.520]  I don't care if you're a German from Germany or a Russian from Russia or Japanese from
[17:55.520 --> 18:04.840]  Japan or South Africa from South Africa or you're a Hispanic from Brazil or whatever,
[18:04.840 --> 18:16.600]  you're getting hit and that's what's crazy about all this and it's getting worse and
[18:16.600 --> 18:19.440]  it's on purpose.
[18:19.440 --> 18:23.280]  My uncle almost died from a tetanus shot, my grandmother three weeks after she got the
[18:23.280 --> 18:27.720]  polio vaccine, they said they needed to come in and take this new strain, she went in and
[18:27.720 --> 18:35.520]  got the new shot and a week later got the next strain and they admit most people in
[18:35.520 --> 18:42.000]  the US got polio from the vaccine, they didn't eradicate it, they spread the thing with it
[18:42.000 --> 18:49.040]  and they had cancer viruses in it, hundreds of them, one of them alone SV 40 estimated
[18:49.040 --> 18:58.360]  to have infected over 100 million Americans killing more than 25 million, that's a CDC.gov,
[18:58.360 --> 19:09.040]  go look it up for yourself, who's right on the show, some bad hombres, now let's talk
[19:09.040 --> 19:13.720]  about black lives matter when we come back because that's only one little plan brought
[19:13.720 --> 19:21.600]  to you by the folks in Tuskegee, Alabama that told black folks roll their sleeves up because
[19:21.600 --> 19:25.520]  we got something good for you.
[19:25.520 --> 19:32.000]  This is the ultimate sigh up, but if people will just not be emotional, pull back and
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.400]  look at it, it's as naked as they come and I'm going to break down exactly where this
[19:37.400 --> 19:42.000]  is all going and I guess it's really just this.
[19:42.000 --> 19:52.000]  I have come to the full understanding that our worst analysis is dead accurate and then
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.160]  it's still worse than we even thought and that's not a negative thing to say, it's
[19:56.160 --> 20:26.080]  good to know the truth and to make preparation for it.
[20:26.080 --> 20:30.080]  Take it.
[20:30.080 --> 20:32.080]  The investment world isn't fair.
[20:32.080 --> 20:35.600]  A precious metals trader buys gold and silver at spot price.
[20:35.600 --> 20:40.780]  You pay his price plus fees, costs and shipping, but today you don't.
[20:40.780 --> 20:45.940]  Today, J. M. Bullion offers a 10 ounce bar of pure silver at spot price, no fees, no
[20:45.940 --> 20:50.480]  markups, no shipping, invest in something real, not wall street paper.
[20:50.480 --> 20:52.800]  10 ounces of silver at spot price.
[20:52.800 --> 20:57.400]  RealPriceSilver.com for this limited time offer, one per household, 50 United States
[20:57.400 --> 20:58.400]  only.
[20:58.400 --> 20:59.400]  RealPriceSilver.com.
[20:59.400 --> 21:04.720]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but were waiting for an outrageously
[21:04.720 --> 21:08.200]  low price, you were not going to want to miss this important message.
[21:08.200 --> 21:09.200]  Here's why.
[21:09.200 --> 21:13.360]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse, so please
[21:13.360 --> 21:14.360]  listen.
[21:14.360 --> 21:19.320]  Solar generators really do provide life saving electrical power and unlike gas generators,
[21:19.320 --> 21:23.680]  solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the
[21:23.680 --> 21:24.680]  sun.
[21:24.680 --> 21:29.000]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going

[22:33.160 --> 22:37.520]  from insurance while providing compliance with the Obamacare individual mandate.

[23:29.560 --> 23:33.640]  I was taught that if you're wicked, you go to hell and suffer eternal fiery torment forever
[23:33.640 --> 23:34.640]  and ever.
[23:34.640 --> 23:35.640]  Is that what the Bible really says?
[23:35.640 --> 23:39.960]  But have you found out that nobody's burning in hell right now?
[23:39.960 --> 23:44.040]  We go to a website for the curious, it's called TheBibleSaysThat.org.
[23:44.040 --> 23:46.920]  What you've been taught might not actually be in the Bible.

[24:10.480 --> 24:27.840]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine, I've been on fire with Sally,
[24:27.840 --> 24:45.200]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine, I've been on fire with Sally,
[24:45.200 --> 25:09.200]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine, I've been on fire with Sally,
[25:09.200 --> 25:14.200]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine, I've been on fire with Sally,
[25:14.200 --> 25:26.720]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine, I've been on fire with Sally,
[25:26.720 --> 25:35.600]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine, I've been on fire with Sally,
[25:35.600 --> 25:40.760]  And seeing through it, I mean, it was like half the people or more commenting on it.
[25:40.760 --> 25:51.360]  You could go to their channels were, you know, black folks, and I saw a few people in there
[25:51.360 --> 25:55.720]  who when you went to their sites were Caucasian, I don't know if they really were or whatever.
[25:55.720 --> 26:01.480]  And they were saying things like, oh no, this guy, you know, he works for Israel or he works
[26:01.480 --> 26:10.320]  for the Vatican or he's got an agenda. Don't believe him. I'm not addressing this because
[26:10.320 --> 26:16.920]  that type of criticism does anything to me. That criticism and manipulation is aimed at you.
[26:16.920 --> 26:23.320]  So you stay on the globalist plantation of divide and conquer. It's not racism. Racism is just
[26:23.320 --> 26:28.440]  tribalism. We all have it. We all do it. It's how we're designed. It has its functions when
[26:28.440 --> 26:36.200]  we're really under attack. It's groupthink. It's mob psychology. But it is absolutely important
[26:36.200 --> 26:48.160]  to understand that facts are facts and you better believe I have an agenda and my agenda is
[26:48.160 --> 26:57.240]  treating others like I want to be treated, trying to build a good community, enjoying seeing other
[26:57.240 --> 27:03.200]  people get ahead and be successful and innovate and produce art and literature and science.
[27:03.200 --> 27:10.720]  My agenda is to try to wake people up. My agenda is to try to find the words to transcend all
[27:10.720 --> 27:16.040]  this manipulation because it's hard to even fight this stuff and not somehow add to it,
[27:16.040 --> 27:27.880]  especially when the public across the board is so incredibly dumbed down. But it doesn't matter
[27:27.880 --> 27:32.600]  whether I'm a good person or a bad person. I am a very good person, but they could set me up,
[27:32.600 --> 27:39.600]  destroy me, put out a lie to assassinate my character. The issues shouldn't be about Alex
[27:39.600 --> 27:46.600]  Jones because I'm not running the world. The globalists are attempting to and do to a great
[27:46.600 --> 27:57.680]  extent. What matters is the facts I've put out that you can go check for yourself. The only way
[27:57.680 --> 28:01.720]  they get away with something like Obamacare being written by foreign banks to screw us over and
[28:01.720 --> 28:07.440]  rob us is to have people not go check the facts. The only way they get away with funding ISIS
[28:07.440 --> 28:12.600]  and al Qaeda is to have people not geopolitically be informed and know the facts. The only way
[28:12.600 --> 28:18.880]  they get away with our basic rights and freedoms being destroyed and dismantled is that we're
[28:18.880 --> 28:24.320]  all fighting with each other over idiotic issues that don't exist in the great scheme of things
[28:24.320 --> 28:31.800]  and the general public doesn't have basic knowledge about political systems work. The people perish
[28:31.800 --> 28:38.880]  for lack of knowledge and that's why we're in this position. That said, the useful idiots at
[28:38.880 --> 28:46.080]  Black Lives Matter actually are much, much better people than the globalists that are
[28:46.080 --> 28:49.360]  manipulating them and controlling them. They actually believe they're fighting injustice.
[28:49.360 --> 28:55.600]  They actually have the courage to go out and demonstrate. They have the crazy, wild, misguided
[28:55.600 --> 29:01.320]  courage to go out and even though they ambush folks, that's cowardly, it still takes some courage
[29:01.320 --> 29:08.920]  to know you're about to get killed. Now if you're going to do that, it is cowardly just to sneak
[29:08.920 --> 29:13.000]  up and shoot people in the back, but at the same time, still there's some dumb courage on the
[29:13.000 --> 29:23.400]  back end of that cowardice. It's a sophisticated, delicate point. I don't hate these people,
[29:23.400 --> 29:30.480]  but I sure hate the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, the Tides Foundation, George Soros
[29:30.480 --> 29:35.600]  and the people that know exactly what they're doing. And I look at people like that that enjoy
[29:35.600 --> 29:40.840]  CNN folks hurt, who love punching people's buttons, who enjoy seeing humanity fall,
[29:40.840 --> 29:48.040]  and my dislike of them makes me nauseous. I am beyond hatred for George Soros.
[29:48.040 --> 29:56.200]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:56.200 --> 30:04.200]  The head of French police warned that the country is on the verge of a civil war, triggered by
[30:04.200 --> 30:08.200]  another mass sexual assault of women by migrants like the one that occurred in Cologne, Germany
[30:08.200 --> 30:13.080]  on New Year's Eve, as reported by Paul Joseph Watson on Infowars.com. The head of the directorate
[30:13.080 --> 30:17.600]  general of internal security said the situation in France is so potentially explosive that one
[30:17.600 --> 30:22.240]  more major Islamic terror attack or mass migrant sexual assault could lead to a massive public
[30:22.240 --> 30:27.120]  backlash. He said, quote, I think it will take place. Even one or two attacks in it will happen.
[30:27.120 --> 30:32.000]  It therefore behooves us to anticipate and block all these groups. As we previously reported,
[30:32.000 --> 30:35.800]  hundreds of German women were sexually abused during a series of attacks in Cologne on December
[30:35.800 --> 30:40.760]  31. The situation that I witnessed is described as a war zone. Most of the culprits who were
[30:40.760 --> 30:45.120]  Muslim migrants were never charged for the rapes. Additionally, these Muslim migrants from North
[30:45.120 --> 30:49.400]  Africa and the Middle East have turned the once peaceful country of Sweden into a rape capital
[30:49.400 --> 30:53.880]  of the world, second only to a tiny country in Southern Africa. For more news on the migrant
[30:53.880 --> 30:57.880]  crisis in Europe, you're not going to find in the mainstream media. Tune in to Infowars.com.
[30:57.880 --> 31:02.600]  This is Kit Daniels reporting. Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over
[31:02.600 --> 31:07.720]  a year to do it. Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that
[31:07.720 --> 31:13.640]  pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and
[31:13.640 --> 31:19.400]  water and beverages in my system. But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is
[31:19.400 --> 31:24.840]  anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[31:25.720 --> 31:30.440]  spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all
[31:30.440 --> 31:33.880]  parasites. Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it. You have
[31:33.880 --> 31:39.720]  the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite
[31:39.720 --> 31:43.640]  cleanse at least twice a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going
[31:43.640 --> 31:47.800]  back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living defense. Infowarslife.com. And folks,
[31:47.800 --> 31:53.080]  you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast.
[31:53.080 --> 31:57.400]  Infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for
[31:57.400 --> 32:02.840]  all your work, sir, on this great product. Last week, we pointed out that globalists have declared
[32:02.840 --> 32:08.520]  open season on free individuals and nations worldwide. When the British left the Euro,
[32:08.520 --> 32:12.440]  the globalists decided to go into high gear. They've now announced that Hillary won't be
[32:12.440 --> 32:16.280]  indicted no matter how many crimes she commits. It's time for us to take our matters into our
[32:16.280 --> 32:21.400]  own hands. The globalist warfare model is siege. It wants to make us dependent. It wants to cut
[32:21.400 --> 32:26.440]  off our economies. It wants to be able to set up a worldwide financial crisis where there are food
[32:26.440 --> 32:30.280]  shortages that are already happening in most parts of the world, where they basically bring us to our
[32:30.280 --> 32:35.080]  knees and where we can pitch like their demands. That's why we're extending the July 4th sale
[32:35.080 --> 32:40.280]  right through next week because it's all about declaring your independence from the globalist.
[32:40.280 --> 32:44.520]  You don't just declare independence when you buy high-quality, storeable foods or water filters
[32:44.520 --> 32:49.400]  or shortwave radios at infowarstore.com. You declare independence when you share links of
[32:49.400 --> 32:53.640]  articles and videos and information from the broadcast because there's a warrant for your mind.
[32:53.640 --> 33:09.560]  It's a total 360 win at infowarstore.com.
[33:16.680 --> 33:20.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:20.680 --> 33:26.600]  Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:33.800 --> 33:36.600]  What is the end game of the technotronic system?
[33:39.400 --> 33:45.560]  Using the economy, using sociology, psychology,
[33:45.560 --> 33:53.240]  the absolutely, totally and completely game of the global economy to fix every major stock
[33:53.240 --> 34:00.840]  market, every major currency system to selectively destroy the language, break down the family.
[34:00.840 --> 34:07.720]  You can see it everywhere. You can see it every day. And here is the boil down of what Black Lives
[34:07.720 --> 34:15.160]  Matter is that I'm going to drill into the latest developments. It is an attempt to divert
[34:15.160 --> 34:19.080]  attention away from government corruption, multinationals running our government,
[34:19.080 --> 34:26.040]  all the big scandals, the 2016 election, and to make it all basically racially based
[34:29.320 --> 34:34.840]  and to create a type of anti-white sentiment that is attached to a lot of legitimate
[34:34.840 --> 34:42.440]  anti-establishment sentiment and to make revolution in this country not be about restoration of the
[34:42.440 --> 34:49.560]  Republic and kicking the globalist out like the British exit has begun to do, but instead making
[34:49.560 --> 34:58.680]  revolution about paying back old scores and reinstituting obsessions with race and religion
[34:59.240 --> 35:08.120]  and ethnicity and then having local governments capitulate to multinational UN UNESCO policies
[35:08.120 --> 35:15.320]  enforced by the federal government through block grants and strong cities federal slash
[35:15.320 --> 35:23.640]  UN watchdogs. It is the next phase of the Federal Reserve beachhead established in 1913
[35:24.200 --> 35:29.160]  of expanding the civil emergency into local government and putting their people in charge at
[35:29.160 --> 35:35.560]  every level. Then the very same Democrats that passed minimum sentencing under Clinton
[35:35.560 --> 35:43.080]  to falsely imprison a lot of black males which then creates a culture of crime they go to
[35:43.080 --> 35:49.560]  they go to criminal school the book gets thrown at them they go to criminal school they come out
[35:49.560 --> 35:55.160]  that's all they know they don't have the same rights as other people and then that creates the
[35:55.160 --> 35:59.800]  cycle of not having men in the house and breaking down the family and the very same cycles being
[35:59.800 --> 36:07.320]  beta tested everywhere else now you just see it's full full implementation at least to this phase
[36:08.040 --> 36:11.720]  in the black communities with devastating effect
[36:15.000 --> 36:20.520]  and now black lives matter goes out and has its leaders all over the country we have new videos
[36:20.520 --> 36:27.480]  today call for killing the police and they have miss alabama call out and say that these guys
[36:27.480 --> 36:33.480]  you are martyrs that are getting killed well it's killing police and you have the people leading
[36:33.480 --> 36:36.680]  demonstrations around the country saying kill police we're going to play those clubs coming up
[36:37.240 --> 36:41.480]  and these people really believe they're fighting a fight against the establishment
[36:41.480 --> 36:46.840]  when the entire thing is run by facebook google twitter the winehouse the justice department on
[36:46.840 --> 36:55.160]  record hillary saying how great it is facebook headquarters lit up over the weekend saying
[36:55.160 --> 37:00.040]  black lives matter this is totally orchestrated to send you out in the streets
[37:03.880 --> 37:08.840]  you know war against local government to bring in federalization and globalization
[37:08.840 --> 37:11.640]  but when the feds are done winning that war
[37:14.680 --> 37:21.080]  they're going to absolutely put you in prison and on a plantation much smaller than the one you were
[37:21.080 --> 37:27.000]  already on and that makes me sick i don't sit back i like some of the social engineers and go
[37:27.000 --> 37:32.040]  ha ha look at how hilarious this is these idiots have no idea what they're doing i sit here with
[37:32.040 --> 37:37.960]  a nauseous feeling in my stomach because what happens to you i know comes back on me as well
[37:37.960 --> 37:41.720]  we're all in this together the biggest lie the globalists ever tell themselves is that they
[37:41.720 --> 37:47.000]  somehow are gonna never have to deal with the things they've done in this lifetime
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.520]  through this stuff you do in this lifetime comes back on you
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.520]  and my god-fearing sense and people say what is god-fearing when i even think about the
[37:58.520 --> 38:03.480]  perspective of an evil group from their view i'm not actually thinking evil things
[38:05.240 --> 38:09.560]  in that i'm entertaining them i i run through them militarily that's what you do
[38:10.680 --> 38:16.920]  as a tactician getting in the enemy's mind and when i get in their mind and i actually study them
[38:16.920 --> 38:20.520]  and i studied them long enough to really understand their spirit and who they are
[38:21.720 --> 38:29.160]  it is the only time i'm scared is when i actually get into their skin and it's like whoa whoa oh
[38:29.160 --> 38:34.520]  my god and i just feel scared of god like i want to just get on my knees and start repenting
[38:35.880 --> 38:41.080]  people ask why i get tears in my eyes people the joy of how good god is the joy of creation
[38:41.080 --> 38:47.720]  the joy of all the good things that god's given us is so wonderful i can bring tears to my eyes but
[38:47.720 --> 38:54.680]  what really brings tears to my eyes is when i see the master plan and i just wish other people could
[38:54.680 --> 39:00.040]  see it and i hate to make it about myself it's just that where are the other people that are
[39:00.040 --> 39:04.680]  prominent that see this i mean i've proven i know what i'm looking at i'm proven i can predict the
[39:04.680 --> 39:11.480]  enemy's operations i mean a lot of us just reading their own writings but i i i pull back from it and
[39:11.480 --> 39:19.800]  it's just horrible but we're so trained to take a side instead of just pulling back and saying
[39:20.680 --> 39:26.040]  well in this case they've got the cops as the good guys and black lives matter is the bad guys
[39:26.040 --> 39:32.360]  clearly for logical people that walk through it but in some cases they put the police in the spot
[39:32.360 --> 39:37.000]  of the bad guys with warrantless checkpoints and unconstitutional stuff and then when they go
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.080]  along with that that makes them the bad guys you see what i'm saying but still they're all pawns
[39:41.080 --> 39:46.520]  in the globalist system and the globalist admit that and that's what makes me so angry
[39:47.320 --> 39:53.960]  is i don't hate a cop whether they be black or white i don't hate a woman because she's a woman
[39:53.960 --> 39:58.760]  i don't hate a hispanic person because they're hispanic i want them to have a great life and be
[39:58.760 --> 40:04.280]  successful and live in love if they're in a lorosa group and racist and hate me i see them as a
[40:04.280 --> 40:11.480]  brainwashed mental midget who has to be dealt with if they're a group of black youth walking by
[40:11.480 --> 40:16.040]  and saying hey what are you doing crackerhead yeah oh we see you're looking you want somebody to you
[40:16.040 --> 40:25.000]  know beat you up i think to myself man i don't look like a wimp i can't believe these are some
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.080]  bold teenagers this is texas don't they think i have a gun in this car
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.320]  my god they're gonna get swept up by the cops they'll be lucky if they're not dead in a couple
[40:35.320 --> 40:41.160]  of years man i wish i could reach out and deprogram them but you know what i'm not gonna be able to
[40:41.160 --> 40:49.080]  do it here i don't do it on the street corner and there's my frustration how do i reach people
[40:49.880 --> 40:53.400]  god that's all i want to do is reach people people say what's my agenda my agenda is to not see
[40:53.400 --> 40:59.480]  everybody get played i fundamentally when i've been in parking lots because it almost happened to me
[41:01.400 --> 41:06.120]  when i was about 16 i later learned about it that they're these guys that are being parking lots
[41:08.440 --> 41:12.760]  i've seen them 20 30 times over the years do it they're just you want to stereotype they're almost
[41:12.760 --> 41:19.480]  always white and they'll say oh man listen i just bought this but they can't let me return it
[41:19.480 --> 41:24.120]  and it's like a 500 speaker system and i'll give it to you for only a hundred dollars right now
[41:24.120 --> 41:29.000]  and they're these big cheap thin crappy speakers and they're just trying to hustle you and sell you
[41:29.000 --> 41:34.280]  something but but but but i get mad at that and that's just a scam if i'm dumb enough it's not
[41:34.280 --> 41:40.680]  really criminal what they're doing they see you coming out of a best buy parking lot they know
[41:40.680 --> 41:45.080]  you might be looking for electronics they want to give you this quote great deal and most people
[41:45.080 --> 41:51.720]  listen go yeah i've been approached by that i today in my modern life
[41:54.120 --> 41:58.120]  it was about a year ago some guys came up to me in a parking lot did the same thing and i said hey
[41:58.120 --> 42:01.880]  man no oh really it's great deal i said look i know it's a scam oh it's a scam the guy kind of a
[42:01.880 --> 42:05.880]  little angry and i said look go run your scam man don't run your mouth or i'm gonna knock your damn
[42:05.880 --> 42:11.160]  teeth out i said a little bit more than that and i realized then i wasn't trying to act tough i wasn't
[42:11.160 --> 42:16.120]  trying to act like a man i'm not looking for trouble the guy wants to go around in his baseball cap
[42:16.120 --> 42:20.840]  in his baggy pants and sit there and scam people all day i said just take a scam somewhere else
[42:20.840 --> 42:27.000]  and he didn't like that now the truth is i i wish i wouldn't have gotten mad and gotten the guy's face
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.320]  i should have i got more important things to do and bigger fish to fry bigger enemies to fight
[42:31.320 --> 42:36.280]  but but but really it comes down to that fundamentally my agenda is i don't like scam artists
[42:36.280 --> 42:43.400]  people are always asking what's your agenda that's my agenda when i even think about doing something
[42:43.400 --> 42:51.880]  wrong fear comes over me when i think about not standing up against evil fear comes upon me
[42:51.880 --> 42:57.720]  when i think about taking on the enemy and overrunning them all i feel is victory
[42:59.160 --> 43:03.320]  and it's that simple and for people that have lost their connection to god i feel sorry for you
[43:03.320 --> 43:08.440]  because it's simple that's not just genetics or conscience or something built into us it's spiritual
[43:08.440 --> 43:13.640]  that you know when something's wrong you know when something's right and that's my agenda
[43:14.840 --> 43:20.680]  and i have tried my best to be the most moral person i can and get this job done
[43:22.920 --> 43:27.000]  i'm not perfect though i hear ads on the network that are not my sponsors that uh
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.840]  that i can't vet or say are good and i have major moral issues with it but it's on our local
[43:30.840 --> 43:33.960]  affiliates too that's just part of the world we're in the world none of us are perfect
[43:35.640 --> 43:39.320]  and i'm not trying to set up here and preach today but i'm just telling you about my personal
[43:39.320 --> 43:45.960]  journey fighting this and researching this and knowing we're losing our free will knowing our
[43:45.960 --> 43:52.600]  consciousness is being shuttered knowing people are losing their humanity all around me
[43:52.600 --> 44:00.360]  and all i can say is even though i come to you electronically
[44:03.000 --> 44:07.720]  if you want to defeat the globalist you have to turn off the phones turn off the tvs turn off
[44:07.720 --> 44:16.200]  the sports and get away from the wireless and get out in the woods out in the desert out in the
[44:16.200 --> 44:21.160]  rural areas and they know people just instinctively are involved in an exodus out of the cities right
[44:21.160 --> 44:27.240]  now and they're trying to do everything they can to pass laws and regulations and militarize the police
[44:27.240 --> 44:31.480]  and militarize the blm to really be mean and really harass folks in rural areas
[44:32.920 --> 44:38.280]  but i'm telling you the only everything in me tells me get out of the city with your kids get
[44:38.280 --> 44:52.280]  out now get out now get out now and i sit here and i look at black lives matter the average police
[44:52.280 --> 45:01.080]  officer on record does have a lower rate of crime is an honorable person and is genuinely
[45:01.080 --> 45:09.880]  wanting to help people and is one of the last vestiges of supposed male defensive prowess
[45:11.160 --> 45:16.280]  and if we want to know how far we've fallen our supposed knights in shining armor are the police
[45:16.280 --> 45:22.040]  in the military and look at how screwed up they are we're even more screwed up folks
[45:24.280 --> 45:25.400]  look at ourselves in the mirror
[45:25.400 --> 45:31.880]  and the reason bad people have gotten control of our governments and the police have been
[45:31.880 --> 45:37.000]  turned into instruments of oppression in some cases is because we failed
[45:39.480 --> 45:46.520]  look in the mirror i failed you failed we failed
[45:49.720 --> 45:53.880]  i'll tell you something right now the police when you look at the hierarchy of enemies aren't
[45:53.880 --> 46:00.520]  even on the list people like george soros and that royal family that i asked on the wimbledon
[46:00.520 --> 46:06.280]  or whatever i saw on the news the royal family the prince and princess up there at the box while
[46:06.280 --> 46:11.960]  the while the you know the the uk guy won the match or whatever i mean and it's just all fun
[46:11.960 --> 46:17.800]  and cute and non-threatening these are the people coming after your guns these are the people shipping
[46:17.800 --> 46:22.600]  tb into the country these are the people that have old ladies freezing to death in the uk
[46:22.600 --> 46:26.760]  because they can't get their gas allotment in the winter while all of their hundreds of palaces
[46:26.760 --> 46:33.000]  for billions of pounds a year are paid for by taxpayers you imagine having hundreds of palaces
[46:33.640 --> 46:37.800]  and letting old people freeze to death but don't worry you go lay wreaths at old people's graves
[46:37.800 --> 46:42.360]  and veterans graves and talk about charities for old people it's all sick
[46:42.360 --> 46:50.120]  i want to get into the news on black lives matter and open the phones up in the second hour but
[46:54.760 --> 46:58.440]  here's what's fantastic about all this and i mean fantastic in a bad way
[47:00.840 --> 47:02.280]  this is what is completely
[47:02.280 --> 47:11.400]  totally and totally over the top fantastical
[47:18.360 --> 47:25.000]  we really are watching criminal multinational corporations that have taken over our government
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.520]  they're doing this to a bunch of other governments right now as well look right across the pond same
[47:28.520 --> 47:33.880]  stuff going on just different groups are playing off they really are trying to shut our energy off
[47:33.880 --> 47:38.520]  they really are trying to shut our jobs off they really are trying to shut our industry off
[47:38.520 --> 47:43.640]  the globalists really are shutting down almost every facet of our civilization they're attacking
[47:43.640 --> 47:49.400]  our families they're making it almost impossible to raise our children they are poisoning us at
[47:49.400 --> 47:54.760]  every level culturally but also chemically in the food and water and writing white house books on
[47:54.760 --> 48:04.040]  how they do it like eco science they're bold they think we're that stupid and they're trying
[48:04.040 --> 48:16.280]  to cause a civil war in america over 200 and 58 black people that are killed by cops every year
[48:16.280 --> 48:25.720]  on average when 500 plus die a year on average in chicago at the hands of other black people
[48:25.720 --> 48:31.880]  think about that and you've got all the major media and the government and the democratic party
[48:31.880 --> 48:38.200]  and even some republicans coming out and acting like i mean i've got the quotes from hillary and
[48:38.200 --> 48:44.440]  obama well we better reform the police well we better do some listening legitimizing some
[48:44.440 --> 48:50.840]  random crazy person going and shooting innocent people and then they turn around and blame other
[48:50.840 --> 48:57.080]  people who have guns to defend ourselves during this degenerating society that we collectively
[48:57.080 --> 49:02.760]  the right of individuals forget what color you are the real discrimination is taken our rights
[49:02.760 --> 49:12.120]  individually and collectively to defend ourselves and then it's hillary clinton who helped bill
[49:12.120 --> 49:22.920]  get mandatory minimum sentencing in that is definitely been racist in a big big way
[49:28.040 --> 49:29.240]  i'm gonna skip this network break
[49:32.920 --> 49:34.760]  now before i go any further
[49:34.760 --> 49:42.680]  speaking of where do we come from what do we stand for because the mainstream media always
[49:42.680 --> 49:47.800]  makes some issue out of oh they sell t-shirts they sell books they sell swarable food they sell
[49:47.800 --> 49:56.360]  shortwave radios they sell solar systems that are excellent by the way oh my gosh it's so bad
[49:56.360 --> 50:00.120]  we don't get our money like from taxpayers like npr and then beg for money every week
[50:00.120 --> 50:06.520]  oh we don't uh get it in in in bank or bailouts like nbc and msnbc billions the orachel madel
[50:06.520 --> 50:12.440]  raises oh no we just say hey we got good products in the marketplace very affordable uh great
[50:12.440 --> 50:16.520]  nutraceuticals you might want to buy from us and fund our operation oh we're so evil no i'm
[50:16.520 --> 50:22.600]  proud of our agenda to be shelf funded and to grow in the face of the enemy and and to be strong
[50:22.600 --> 50:26.840]  so that we can stand up against their attacks and that we've built a
[50:26.840 --> 50:33.480]  media platform that's growing and becoming more sophisticated and more
[50:35.880 --> 50:42.680]  focused by the day driven by truth with a great group of people that i know has
[50:42.680 --> 50:49.400]  providence in god's hand on it and your prayers so when i do something again this is what built
[50:49.400 --> 50:52.920]  any civilization something special it's something that i believe in when i sell
[50:52.920 --> 50:58.600]  storeable foods they are the best quality i can find for the lower price you could actually
[50:58.600 --> 51:01.960]  probably find something that costs four or five times more that tastes better and has you know
[51:01.960 --> 51:07.000]  better quality but it's a it's a nexus point the most food for the best quality that's what
[51:07.000 --> 51:12.120]  i chose for my family that's who i went out and got as a sponsor and then i private labeled it to
[51:12.120 --> 51:17.160]  go even lower 20 to 40 off the sale does in today it will end in full or store.com
[51:17.160 --> 51:26.760]  10% off on all the nutraceuticals unless there's bigger specials like x2 that will end
[51:26.760 --> 51:31.160]  today as well because it is about to sell out 10% off and everything else 10% off you sign up for
[51:31.160 --> 51:36.840]  auto ship on any of those items and free shipping on orders of $50 or more the hillary for pros and
[51:36.840 --> 51:43.640]  shirts we're going to put aircraft in the skies all four days of the rnc and all four days of the dnc
[51:43.640 --> 51:50.200]  we're doing it you're buying the shirts at this rate we'll be able to pay for it by the end of
[51:50.200 --> 51:57.240]  the philadelphia convention thank you but thank yourself too and i mean in a way i don't even
[51:57.240 --> 52:00.600]  thank you i mean we're in a fight good you got a shirt we're exposing a tyrant you're putting
[52:00.600 --> 52:05.480]  aircraft in the air thank yourself i mean we're in a war here we better use money it's the symbol
[52:05.480 --> 52:10.600]  of energy it's a weapon projected at them because they're trying to break our will intimidate us
[52:10.600 --> 52:14.600]  with political correctness to sit down and shut up and oh after the civil war they want to start
[52:15.720 --> 52:20.600]  we better ban incendiary language by everybody because that's what caused the great riot of
[52:20.600 --> 52:27.320]  2016 or whatever they're going to do they've already done it in europe i told you they ship all the
[52:27.320 --> 52:32.120]  muslims in cause a crisis have them start rioting and raping that's back on the news today and then
[52:32.120 --> 52:41.880]  just ban germans and french and others having any free speech bottom line it's very expensive to run
[52:41.880 --> 52:46.280]  this operation i don't think people even believe it we couldn't even do this if we were in another
[52:46.280 --> 52:51.480]  state texas is the best when it comes to be able to run something like this we'd be a third this
[52:51.480 --> 52:57.080]  size we were in new york or la didn't even operate basically in those places we don't want to operate
[52:57.080 --> 53:05.240]  there so take advantage of that sale it ends today there's a lot of other specials running it in
[53:05.240 --> 53:12.200]  full war store dot com as well you can also call toll free and ask any questions 888 2533139 888
[53:12.200 --> 53:27.640]  2533139 888 2533139 and it is your purchases again that make everything we do here possible
[53:29.800 --> 53:36.280]  now before i go any further again i could burrow into all this news it's all sensational it's all
[53:36.280 --> 53:44.760]  crazy it's all really important and we're going to do it all but black lives matter and the people
[53:44.760 --> 53:56.200]  that are involved in it that are pushing all of this race war garbage think that they're being
[53:56.200 --> 54:01.160]  bold they think they have courage they think they're going after the right enemy they think they're
[54:01.160 --> 54:06.360]  standing up for themselves for things they've gone through in their lives you stand up for yourself
[54:06.360 --> 54:13.400]  by building your own economy and by becoming successful and by transcending oppression and
[54:13.400 --> 54:21.720]  racism that you've gone through and by being a leader that transcends that you don't become a
[54:21.720 --> 54:29.720]  leader or transcend it by letting the racism or the projected media narrative the simulation
[54:29.720 --> 54:35.960]  define who you are so that you're just simply part of your own racist hate group and let's get
[54:35.960 --> 54:40.520]  down to brass tacks i've been there our crews been there all over the country we've shot most
[54:40.520 --> 54:48.360]  of seminal video the hispanic groups that come out are the most hateful racist nationalistic
[54:48.360 --> 54:53.000]  and i'm not saying nationalism is bad i'm saying they're very nationalistic racist it is ridiculous
[54:53.000 --> 55:01.400]  the blacks are some of the most racist out of control hateful entitled people i've ever seen
[55:01.400 --> 55:06.280]  and and just attacking and beating people it's just it's just it's just an excuse for criminals to
[55:06.280 --> 55:13.240]  be on parade with some of the folks that think they're on some special mission the whites are
[55:13.240 --> 55:24.040]  self-loving hateful controlling twisted closet racist in most cases who actually
[55:24.040 --> 55:29.080]  get off on the whole spectacle because they're not about building things they're not about doing
[55:29.080 --> 55:38.360]  things they're not about transcending they're about virtue signaling and just kind of leading
[55:38.360 --> 55:46.200]  their own little social justice warrior cult it's their form of power they weren't taught reading
[55:46.200 --> 55:50.760]  writing or arithmetic they weren't taught business they weren't taught how to be charming they weren't
[55:50.760 --> 55:54.760]  taught about getting into emerging markets they weren't taught about how to be successful
[55:54.760 --> 55:59.560]  they weren't taught how to innovate they weren't taught how to organize they weren't taught anything
[55:59.560 --> 56:07.480]  but being upset and being victims in the whole victim cosmology i know people in my life that
[56:07.480 --> 56:13.640]  live their whole lives to be victims and the pageantry of being the victim and making up how
[56:13.640 --> 56:19.400]  they're victims and it's like it's like they own a chateau in france or something that they can tell
[56:19.400 --> 56:23.880]  their friends they're a victim and they say oh honey we feel sorry for you it's like they've
[56:24.440 --> 56:29.240]  been an astronaut and walked on the moon or something they it's like their possession
[56:30.840 --> 56:37.160]  i'm not here exposing the globalist so you can be in victimology and feel like a victim and and
[56:37.160 --> 56:41.080]  people say you're just demoralizing us and i go wait a minute oh your perspective is as a victim
[56:41.080 --> 56:46.840]  no no i'm telling you someone's robbing your house if i see them breaking in your back door
[56:46.840 --> 56:52.520]  i live across the street because i'm calling the police i'm getting my gun ready and i'm calling
[56:52.520 --> 56:57.320]  you because it looks like you're in the house it's not so you can get on your back and you know
[56:57.320 --> 57:05.880]  like a beetle and go i'm warning you because because listen i want you to warn me if somebody's
[57:05.880 --> 57:10.600]  breaking in my house if the dam breaks up the river and there's five minutes till 50 feet of
[57:10.600 --> 57:14.520]  water hit me and you heard on the radio and i'm not listening to radio i'm out there mowing my
[57:14.520 --> 57:19.480]  yard i want you to come over and say hey alex the dam broke get your kids get in the cars get out
[57:19.480 --> 57:24.440]  i just get the high ground not because you're a hero because you're alive
[57:27.640 --> 57:33.160]  all over the country and all over the world but you can judge a country by how free it is by how
[57:33.160 --> 57:38.680]  much people render aid they don't just say on facebook give money to you know some charity
[57:38.680 --> 57:44.760]  but don't really give they actually go out and really help people
[57:47.400 --> 57:50.600]  and now all over the west you hear what we always write about in china and other countries
[57:51.720 --> 57:54.120]  well there's a little kid just dying on the street nobody helps him
[57:56.120 --> 58:00.280]  because in china the people have been taught you get ahead by not caring about anybody
[58:00.280 --> 58:06.360]  but yourself and then when you get drug away to have your organs taken for no reason nobody
[58:06.360 --> 58:12.840]  cares about you that's why it can happen because you don't have a sense that a wilderbeast in africa
[58:12.840 --> 58:21.880]  has you know cows if wolves are coming into attack them cows will get around their babies
[58:21.880 --> 58:27.640]  and point their horns out and cows aren't really known as being you know that aggressive or that
[58:27.640 --> 58:32.280]  but at least they've got that basic instinct and most of time it saves their babies modern humans
[58:32.840 --> 58:37.640]  if they were cows they would sell their baby to the wolf hoping the wolf wouldn't eat them
[58:40.840 --> 58:46.360]  thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today

[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.920]  and i sat there and thought about this this morning
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:07.560]  i i i told welden henson our shipping manager did friend of mine 10 years
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:15.000]  he's also involved a lot of the marketing but the point is i told him i said you know
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:19.800]  i was against the iraq war i was against stirring up the muslims but i understand they're very
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:27.160]  tyrannical oppressive system in in my view and in very uh anti-classically liberal and i said man
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:31.720]  again i'm gonna start videotaping and i just am always so culture shocked by it i don't
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:40.520]  but i went to two different stores the small stores this morning one of them was a doctor's
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:45.000]  office i went to get some interstitials i take but it's it's not prescription but you still
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.800]  gotta go to a doctor to get them that's why i'm thinking about coming out with some of the stuff
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:54.440]  they've got it's actually kind of a research project and i went to get that and it's like
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:02:06.200]  glutathione pills and i uh went to another store to get a piece for my sink and at both places
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.080]  there were muslim women with full
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:24.680]  face coverings on bergus and in both cases they were sitting on the ground
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:34.440]  outside the doctor's office but in a hallway and then outside on the street at the little mom and
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:47.240]  pop store little mom and pop hardware store and they were sitting there on the ground in one case
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:52.760]  with one kid another case with two kids and man i realized that i walked in by the second time
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:59.720]  and i saw the lady's husbands in both cases and they knew who i was or something they were like
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:09.640]  looking at me and looked completely freaked out and so i started talking to wellan henson
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:16.680]  and i said man they claim there's only 400 refugees in texas every high school we've called has hundreds
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:25.320]  i go they're all over the place just everywhere i go and and oh listen i was you know full but
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.240]  there's you see women with the headdresses on and you don't like it the point is they're lying to
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:34.440]  us about the numbers and he goes man i took my daughter to the playground at circle c
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:45.480]  where they have soccer fields and he said there were over a hundred muslim men playing soccer
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.320]  he's been in the military he's been overseas and he knows we're seeing
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:55.160]  and and he said and just table after table with the women with the hoods on their heads
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:01.400]  and he said yeah it freaked me out absolutely man it freaks you out when all of a sudden boom
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:12.040]  all over the place and they're on the news going texas has gotten 400 just like they did in europe
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:17.080]  and it was five million and go we've gotten a hundred thousand it'd be a million
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:26.280]  trance has gotten 88 000 it'd be a million and i'm like what is the government what is this
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:34.280]  shutting our power plants off putting tariffs on us where we can't operate just screwing us
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:40.200]  at every level and it's just you come to the realization they mean business and i can tell
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:46.680]  you right now folks these are sunnis they're bringing in there are sleeper cells guaranteed
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:49.880]  and i'm sure of it probably not to sure even next but down the road
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.600]  that's how they're going to bring the country down is with islamic cells
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:57.320]  it's as clear as day i just it is amazing it is amazing
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:04.360]  it's the summer of riots this past weekend riders and baton rouge and st paul through
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:09.400]  monotov cocktails fireworks glass bottles concrete slabs and even bricks at riot police
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:14.440]  overall two under protesters were arrested between the two cities even more according to abc news
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:19.160]  the st paul protesters who started rioting at the governor's mansion forced the closure of interstate
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:24.120]  94 some riders through objects and dropped liquids from overpasses on officers below while
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:28.600]  others targeted laser pointers at police interestingly a prominent black lives matter
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.920]  activist said he hoped the justice department intervenes and that's exactly what the obama
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:37.880]  ministration to hillard glennon want to do as we previously reported president obama is fueling
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:42.440]  racial tensions between african-americans and the police to justify a federal takeover of
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:46.280]  local law enforcement do you really want a police officer to pull you over on the side of the road
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:51.160]  and arrest you for a federal law that originated from the un expansion of federal control only
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.880]  lead to an expansion of the police state which is exact opposite of what the protesters want

[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:43.160]  anything
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.120]  all right we're gonna be open to the phones of the balanced broadcast today with a lot of news a
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:59.080]  lot of clubs i was preaching or pontificating on the nature of the world and what we faced from
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:05.000]  my perspective in the last hour if you'd like to chime in on this loss of awareness this glaze
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.320]  in people's eyes everybody's talked about it for decades but it's getting worse and and i've
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:16.600]  got all these scientific reports uh that the population is in more and more in a highly
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:26.840]  suggestible near sleep state like daydreaming or sleepwalking uh that the neurological uh
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:34.600]  firings of the human brain especially in children are very limited the higher centers of the brain
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:39.400]  associated with religious experience mathematics classical music are not even being accessed in
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:48.360]  most cases humanities being lost take this new pokemon craze that i heard everybody's been
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:54.920]  told me about for a week where i guess pokemon you have a cell phone and you go out and look
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:58.840]  for these little monsters that you get and you train you know i mean some of my kids play with
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:04.360]  pokemon i know my sister did she's like 14 years younger than me i was too young and i was too old
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:16.680]  that came out uh that came out after i was doing such things and so it geolocates where you're at
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:20.680]  and then puts one of these little monsters that you have to capture and then take back and train
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:29.480]  in the real world but because children spend less time outside in the west than super max
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:35.560]  prisoners looks less than one hour a day emt's are reporting kids are collapsing everywhere
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:41.000]  heat stroke uh they're getting hurt they're running out in front of cars and in a way
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.760]  that's good it's not good they're gonna get my cars but it's good they're outside it's
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:52.120]  good to rediscovering the outside world but it took the japanese game brought to the internet
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:11:00.520]  to push a system they call augmented reality for the kids to even go outside where they could
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.520]  have gone and caught fish in the local creek even if they were in a big city
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:13.720]  or they could have gone and birdwashed or built a fort or played baseball or gone swimming or
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:22.760]  stolen beer out of golfer's ice chest like i would do i'm sorry but i mean everybody has
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:31.000]  their adventures as a kid or how about when you're 12 13 14 going and knocking on the
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:38.120]  uh cute girl down the street's door and having her mom come to the door and say well who are you
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:42.200]  well i met your daughter at the pool last week and i'd like i just want to see if she wants to
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:47.000]  go to a movie or something movie theater is only about a mile away we could walk or i got the money
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.640]  i'll pay for it man how about you take us well you are sure are a polite young man come on in here
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:59.160]  you you're only 13 like you're about 16 well my daughter's 15 comes in the daughter so that's the
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:05.880]  kind of video game i was playing and it was real it was a lot better than oh i had a nintendo and i
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:14.840]  you know i'd play it when my buddies came over sometime but uh the air conditioner with these
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:20.440]  lights just in the heat of texas for some reason they're so humid outside uh that uh it's it's
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:23.960]  it's uh been a little bit hot in here that's that's why for tb viewers you've seen me occasionally
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:30.360]  wiping a uh dish rag on my face but side issue for the radio listeners they're not having to watch that
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.920]  and again i could only talk about the universe from my perspective it's not about
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:43.960]  but alex jones did this and alex jones did that but i look at the stunted world these children
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:50.040]  are in they're not at swim meets they're not in basketball meets they're not no the vast majority
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.680]  are not some are and you see the kids that are in sports you see the kids that aren't watching tv all
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:00.280]  day it's like they look super healthy super alive there's electricity in their eyes i don't care what
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:06.840]  color they are but you see the tv head kids and they kind of stumble around they kind of bump into
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:12.040]  walls they you can't really talk to them they're always looking down or they do talk to you what
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:16.920]  about this tv show what about this video game what about this comic book and if you go well
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:21.960]  you know there's more in the world to just comic books they'll go oh yeah whatever and like immediately
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:29.400]  have a pavlovian angry response to you well if you don't like it that's fine
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:35.480]  i'm like whoa whoa i'm not hey you one brought up video games and comic books to me
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:43.960]  and you'd think i was awake to all this stuff i'd let my children get ingratiated and some
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:48.920]  because you know you're going on a trip or on a plane or a four-hour car drive and you want to go
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:52.520]  ahead and let them have access to media or you want to do research on the internet for their
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:57.320]  paper they're writing and then it always train wrecks into something bad and then you take
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:03.960]  all the media away from them except maybe let my kids watch the new true grit and it's got violence
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:08.120]  and stuff in it but but but at least it's giving them instincts it's it's based on something
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:14.040]  honorable it's got good actors in it it's long form the scenes are long it develops a longer
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:19.000]  attention span oh here you want to go to the bookstore you want to go to the library and
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:26.600]  take 20 books home let's do that because it gets you to form ideas in your own mind
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.320]  it gets you to have to image everything you're reading if you're reading about
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:38.520]  Moby Dick and what he looked like with all the harpoons and wires wrapped all around him in his
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:42.760]  big intelligent eyes staring at Captain Ahab
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:49.400]  as the two go deep into the sea interlocked together in hatred
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.560]  you image that in your mind that creates synapses that creates understanding that creates
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:06.360]  systems in your mind that came originally from the depths of your imagination and then forces
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:28.200]  you to access the massively compressed but accessible race memory of every one of your ancestors
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.080]  it said though that one problem humanity has
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:37.640]  is that they're unable
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.920]  to pass down the knowledge of one generation to the next
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.600]  but if you look at the modern system it's all about blocking the lore
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:59.240]  blocking the knowledge blocking the information blocking the wisdom show that you can be enslaved
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:03.960]  and I know I've already said that a thousand times but that's the key and that's how you
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:12.760]  know the globalist are bad now that said Obama going into his final six months in office four
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:21.480]  months as an elected leader but another good two and a half months after that in the Oval Office
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:33.880]  and the entire corporate globalist media combine is trying to hype total cultural guilt by everybody
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:39.320]  and incredible in fighting to then have the media and the universities and all the systems roll
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:45.400]  out their next level of political correctness where you have to sign pledges to have a government
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:52.280]  job or sign pledges to be in an even state funded university or private that's in the news today to
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.920]  go to all the sensitivity training and all of this brainwashing and to reduce the language
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:03.080]  and to pledge yourself into this new cult and that we've got to turn our guns in they now admit
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:10.680]  it's time to ban the guns new york times washington post rolling stone la times time to repeal the
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:16.520]  second amendment thought they never wanted our guns now they admit that's what they want everything's
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:25.560]  being uncloaked right now it's a microaggression to smile at a black person it's a microaggression
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:40.840]  to not smile round paper bags are racist on and on and on with hillary and obama and all the
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:50.120]  usual suspects saying yes it's true we're sorry we're bad white people need to look in the mirror
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:57.880]  and need to need to basically listen up's what hillary said that means check it oh you see the
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:04.280]  cops getting killed they need to reform themselves that's separate from a debate about reform random
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:08.760]  people that had nothing to do with these other tragedies around the country are dead and before
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:16.440]  they're even cold obama is out there adding fuel and lynch is adding fuel which lets you know
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:23.080]  what you already knew they're a hundred percent trying to cause civil insurrection in this country
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:29.160]  which will be used to bring in anti-free speech laws the anti-gun laws it'll create more racial
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:37.720]  division and all any of this does is turn people against each other and create more paranoia and
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:44.040]  more mental illness while the big multinational combines steal everything including the kitchen
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:49.800]  sink our birthright our future our industrial base all of us are under attack all of us are
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:54.760]  drinking deadly fluoride water all of us are getting hit with the geoengineering that's going
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:19:00.920]  on all of us are having trouble avoiding the GMO all of us are under the very same anti-human
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:08.600]  globalist program and it's so pathetic to see the media weaponized and the big corporations of
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:14.360]  the government all together legitimizing that the number one issue in the country is that the
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:20.600]  police are the bad guys and you do what the feds say and that means go under you and control and
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:27.000]  become political police officers that go out like leftist university officers who let the leftist
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:34.840]  beat up the conservatives this is a Maoist style push to intimidate the country using misguided
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:42.120]  black people into accepting the next level of tyranny just as they've done in Europe using
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:49.480]  the muslims as pawns and it is a very very sickening evil program and it's out in the open

[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:50.200]  800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 here's another big question is america done i mean the globalist
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:55.080]  have taken the most independent wealthiest nation in world history and turned it into the most
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:01.000]  unhealthy obese dumb down indebted nation in the world we still have a lot of great things in the
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.920]  country and a lot of great ideals but as we lose the bedrock of what made us successful
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:13.000]  is there a point when you can say the country's gone because you'd think a hillary getting
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:19.240]  elected would finally wake everybody up no her supporters are delusional they don't care if the
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:24.120]  actual economy goes down they don't care if they actually see the nation disintegrate
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:28.600]  they want to feel like winners and feel like they're in charge of the country
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:34.280]  coming up i have a clip of bernie sanders saying oh we've done a great job you know now that i'm
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:39.960]  gonna step step down and let hillary run things you know we've won everything he claimed he was
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:46.360]  against is what hillary represents trump is way more populist than her but bernie sanders has
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:53.720]  always been a dirty fraud he doesn't even live up to his own socialist dreams because they never do
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:26:00.680]  do socialist countries always end up going bankrupt or collapsing even wealthy western europe
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:10.520]  it doesn't work ever unless it's a tribal group of less than 200 people who are an agrarian area
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:22.920]  and then it is a combine a commune where you get the word communist and then people that don't
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:31.080]  produce as much food or whatever don't get as big a share and when people cheat handing out the shares
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.760]  folks get stabbed to death there are some deaths in those communities
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:44.280]  but because it's so micro it's so localized it's hard to make it corrupt because people will kill you
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:55.560]  that's how that works if i'm on a commune and i'm raising cows and i've delivered 10 cows that year
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:02.280]  and i don't get back my share of the meat from the commune it's fraud well let me tell you don't
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:09.080]  get back your share in one of these globalist communes you got the holes un supported your
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:14.520]  new york times supported revolutionary grassroots zeitgeist movement with a bunch of pseudo-intellectuals
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:20.040]  dressed in black knowing the computer will decide how much food you get and we'll all live in big
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:26.280]  white plastic super stadiums oh that sounds like a dystopic nightmare but don't worry a computer
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:39.880]  will decide what you do and where you live a computer who programs the computer dumbo and then
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:45.560]  their answer was you will have to be reeducated for a period of time once the movement takes over
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:53.000]  and we end all money and then the person ran around saying that they never said i'd be sent for
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:00.040]  reeducation it's on the internet him saying it to me i said i'll be sent to reeducation yes you'll
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:08.680]  be sent to a reeducation center it's in the official resettlement manual of the us army

[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:24.440]  and again i know i harp on that folks that is the totalitarian the authoritarian name is the
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:37.080]  communist name the army uses communist lingo listen to me carefully i'm not here saying
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:42.600]  that what they talk about in resettlement and emergency centers is that reeducation camp
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:50.840]  they use the term reeducation camp fm3-39.40 how to process your social security numbers
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:56.760]  how to run you through it and it's got dual use overseas in here domestically but it's for domestic

[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:07.320]  guess folks you're not in kansas anymore that's what i keep telling people

[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:21.080]  these days absolutely it's white knuckle time boys and girls they've proven that they're going
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:24.360]  for broke they've proven we were right about them they've proven they were worse than we thought
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:37.480]  and the public may be too dumb down and too selfish and too culturally ruined
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:41.880]  to be able to reverse it i mean they're they're in game of just creating a bunch of dumb idiots
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:46.120]  has been successful but there's silver lining and all this we're gonna come back go to the
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:55.240]  clubs and your calls i'm out of shows we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:30:03.400]  radio network the head of french police warned that the country is on the verge of a civil war
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:07.560]  triggered by another mass sexual assault of women by migrants like the one that occurred in cologne
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:12.280]  germany on new year's eve as reported by paul joseph watson on info wars dot com the head of the
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:17.000]  directorate general of internal security said the situation in france is so potentially explosive
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.560]  that one more major islamic terror attack or mass migrant sexual assault could lead to a massive
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:26.520]  public backlash he said quote i think it will take place even one or two attacks and it will
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:31.720]  happen it therefore behooves us to anticipate and block all these groups as we previously reported
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:35.560]  hundreds of german women were sexually abused during a series of attacks in cologne on december
[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:40.920]  31st the situation that i witnessed is described as a war zone most of the culprits who were muslim

[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:58.760]  into the culture to cause destabilization to not even fix the problem they claim they were fixing
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:04.120]  but to hand more power to the un more power to the foundations more power to the universities

[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.400]  that they know we're lying about what the globalists are up to
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:45.960]  this whole agenda is just so criminal
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.920]  and it'd be one thing if they were running a criminal agenda just to be in control
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:37:01.640]  like boss hog and skim off the top i'd be against that but this is a takeover system meant to end
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:09.000]  us as a species as we know it that's what the new world order's plan is but the globalist

[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:56.760]  neurological disorders and cancer i mean we're we're really we're we're walking dead folks and
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:02.120]  the military simulates to mow down the zombies they're actually turning us into walking dead
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:07.960]  as an ark type and then if things break down it will be like a zombie apocalypse
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:17.960]  that isn't surreal to you as the military would go we're trained to mow down thousands of people
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:25.800]  begging for food oh yeah in the simulation they're now zombies but let me tell you something all these
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:33.160]  entitled people they will be like zombies if there's a great depression and then god forbid you try to

[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:05.960]  just bizarre hi michael jeremy eva imit raptor man we're gonna go to all your phone calls but
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:09.720]  since i haven't gotten any clips yet i've really been remiss today with all the powerful clips
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:17.560]  let's play a few of those right now this is portland black lives matter protest and we've
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:23.720]  bleeped out the cuss words with the leader of it the organizer going around saying kill the police
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.040]  pull out your peace
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:36.680]  and i mean folks i go to demonstrate for the first amendment and there are cops there waiting for
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:44.520]  me under orders to do one thing wrong and i'm arrested but all over the country especially
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:49.080]  in leftist strongholds they let people sit there and say get your guns out shoot the police
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:59.960]  i mean that's a call to capital murder that's like a mafia don saying you know hey capo tell your
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:07.080]  soldiers go kill this guy you're just as guilty as the don as the person that that pulls the trigger
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:12.920]  down the line 10 levels down i'm folks this is protected and you look at these morons doing
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:17.960]  this they have no idea that when after black lives matters done causing a civil war if they're
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:23.080]  successful that you're going to be in a federal supermax prison for the rest of your lives
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:33.400]  and i take no pleasure in that because i'm probably going to fail just like others are trying to stop
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:41.320]  this ignorance rules videos on info wars dot com i don't even plug my own website i don't
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:47.240]  even tell all the stuff it's so important video black lives matter protest leaders
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:53.240]  says kill the police and run over them with cars and then i've got miss alabama
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:03.000]  saying that she thinks this guy that died in dallas is a martyr yes a martyr
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:08.200]  for syops a martyr for the globalists yes he is a martyr
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:16.040]  and people say well alex you say a lot of stuff's false flag why isn't this oh it's false flag
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:26.120]  it's false flag sure it is the media ran the whole artificial thing they're blaming it on
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:31.400]  black lives matter a false flag is just something that's done that's blamed on one group but it's
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:36.040]  really another black lives matter or just the idiots out pushing the narrative the media and the
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:41.640]  president and soros they're the ones that launched this attack knowing full well they put out propaganda
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:46.760]  like this in the middle of the summer long enough hard enough somebody is gonna go crazy and go out
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:51.160]  and start killing and we knew there'd be copycat shootings at where this happened and that happened
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:55.560]  i was criticized on friday by the media for saying there'd be copycat shootings that's not hard to know
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:43:07.160]  they know exactly what they're doing pushing the buttons pulling the chains jerking the chains
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:12.760]  and i'm just surprised there hadn't been more like that guy up there when they
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:19.000]  you know went into the church and shot the black people another wound up loon
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:25.880]  oh but when that happened it was horrible and evil you know he said he was mad that black people
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:31.320]  were going around and killing white people so he was retaliating and folks said well wait random
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:35.400]  black people at a church who have nothing to do with what other racist black people are doing
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:41.000]  why would you go kill random people oh but the media you know they all got that oh it's
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.240]  terrible that he just killed random people it's the end of the world let's blame all whites
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:49.800]  of the confederate flag and restrict more speech and do all this but then when this guy does it
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:58.360]  he's a martyr and obama and loretta lynch and hillary and all the usual suspects come out and
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:05.800]  say better listen up hillary said that better listen up white people better listen up or you're
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:12.600]  gonna get killed better do what the justice department says it speaks for black lives matter
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:18.200]  here's the woman behind it who's about to be president if we don't stop her saying you better
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:26.440]  listen up to what our wound up lunatics did she's right there telling you you better do what I say
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:33.960]  cops you better let's strong cities in better let the you in run things then we'll protect you
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:38.760]  then you can kill whoever you want you don't let us run the show we're gonna burn your cities down
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:42.920]  when you and I say lady you go ahead and burn it down and we're gonna blame you for it because we
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:47.320]  know you did it because let me give you a little newsflash witch I know you told congress this is
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:53.160]  true you were begging for more money to fight us and others you're losing the info war badly
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:57.480]  and this little act of desperation is just woken up the police the military 10 times more
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:04.360]  to the entire paradigm including their own issues and so you think you're operating in a vacuum
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:08.760]  because you've got a bunch of stupid college kids and folks that want to go out and die in some
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:13.720]  bloodbath sociopaths and criminals and lunatics listening to you they feel empowered because
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:19.480]  the big tv and the mtv and all the rest of the media has been hyping this culture war it's totally
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:27.400]  synthetic you are going to get the blame for all of this and anyone who's a thinking person knows
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:31.720]  what you've done and you've woken people up like nothing I've ever seen so I guess I should say to
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:35.160]  Hillary Clinton thank you for what you've done because you've woken up a lot of people but let's
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:42.760]  go ahead and play some of this video of Portland black lives matter the videos on info wars.com
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:49.240]  if you want to see it uncensored we've cut out the cuss words here it is why do we have to hold
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:46:03.080]  a picture of this mother's baby this young man here clackamish county sheriff this is their work no your right no your life and I promise you if they go about
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:09.480]  they burning up of whatever they said you're doing you put your pussy out you bust that you put your
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:15.880]  pussy out you bust that because at the end of the day it's gonna be you and you sit and when we do when we
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:24.200]  move with the panthers trust me when you see me move I'm moving in violence because most
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:31.080]  of y'all folks it involves real talk we're tired of walking around here asking y'all to help us
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:38.760]  we need action take action I'll give a whether you knock them over whether you run up bono
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:50.360]  whatever you do you better take action notice the whites all are like professors and operatives
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.920]  they know full well what they're doing so you can actually see controllers they're probably paid to be
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:59.320]  there they're all holding up signs they're supposed to be handwritten it's the same handwriting
[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:04.520]  let's let's pause it for tv viewers radio listeners info wars.com
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:09.320]  forward slash show to see the live feed or go see the video that's all written by the same person
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:14.360]  look at that they even tried to make it look like somebody else did it but the a's and the s's and the
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:17.800]  and the and the y's it all and the g's tell you
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:26.440]  look at those operatives look at that professor guarantee that guy's a professor look at that guy
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:38.120]  in yellow right there look at his bernie wife look at him look at the controllers in the crowd
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:44.760]  and then you've got their time bomb idiots they've got out front right there with them
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.080]  you've got the muslims in the back and all the rest of it just waiting in the shadows
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:56.120]  and again you've got all these mental medgets out there that really believe there's an epidemic
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:48:00.200]  of black people being killed there's an epidemic and i've got the studies here even the new york
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:05.960]  times admits it of police roughing up black people and driving while black and harassing black folks
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:10.920]  mainly because of all the horrible bad behavior and the fact that so many over the weekend black
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:14.520]  men would just pull guns on police even the witnesses said this black witnesses and they would
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:18.600]  say oh another black man's been killed because they tried to shoot cops so again this is the whole
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:23.000]  sigh opt to get everybody hating each other and and the police will then treat folks even worse
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:28.520]  and be more paranoid and they're all also problems with the police as well uh so it's a time bomb
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:39.880]  let's let's let's go back to more of this tape let's go black lambs matter black lambs matter
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:44.600]  so if i get the terrorist disrespect and problems going on by the police against quote minorities
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:48.680]  but all this is going to do is cause more of that and if you get into what's happening in
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:52.440]  many of the inner city areas there's a culture of absolutely hating the police in general
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:58.680]  including black officers who are most black officers quit. Yeah, yeah, back it up. It's the
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:03.880]  kill pigs part. And there's a powerful letter up on info wars.com by a black officer talking about
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:09.800]  a decade of living under this and what it's like and how hard it is to then recruit other black
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:16.360]  officers because they get into this area where and it's just like they call people there and then
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:22.840]  screaming yell at them and shoot at them once they're there to respond to what's already happened.
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:28.760]  And it's just crazy. Let me tell you cops have a tough job one I wouldn't want but let me tell
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:37.800]  you working in an inner city. I don't care where it is. It is scary folks. All right, let's let's
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:50:04.040]  finish the club. Here it is. And it's our time to stand where we deserve and we will dismantle
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:10.520]  these are Bernie supporters and I don't say they want to kill everybody.
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:27.000]  That I know a lot of people are not going to like I'm a bad ass black Puerto Rican trans.
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:51.560]  And now the mob wants to attack some white devils I guess. So this is gonna unravel very,
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:55.720]  very quickly. Police arrested Strickland and he has been charged the two felony counts of
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:59.480]  unlawful use of a weapon. And that's when they reportedly started trying to assault
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:06.280]  a blogger. So he pulled his firearm out to protect himself. And of course the Portland
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:13.640]  world now probably throw the bookhead I'll never be seen again. And you've just got a bunch of
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:20.760]  disenfranchised people who don't have jobs who are going to college and being learning
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:24.760]  how they've been disenfranchised, not by the globalist deindustrializing the country,
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:28.360]  not by the globalist dumbing everybody down, not with the globalist shipping their jobs out,
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:34.600]  no, no, no. They just know that the media says the number one problem is the police are attacking
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:41.720]  minorities. And so now local leftist government with the feds are going to organize them to
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:46.200]  go out and do this. And when cops get killed, well, the police better start reforming themselves.
[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:53.640]  This is an internal globalist army trying to use useful idiots on the ground to start a shooting
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:58.840]  war they can use as cover to send in paramilitaries to start overthrowing major cities.
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:05.800]  I'm telling you, and they've done this in Ukraine, they've done this in Egypt, the New World Order
[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:11.000]  is not playing games. And we either have a total awakening to this, or I'm here to tell you,
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:17.720]  they're getting ready to go forward with this. And then of course the giant third world populations
[01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:22.760]  are being brought in. The big think tanks admit to drive down wages not to help anybody.
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:28.200]  And all the folks that are out there begging for socialism are going to be just like the people
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:35.640]  in Venezuela that are now eating their dogs and cats. The country has more oil in the United States.
[01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:42.440]  The country has better soil in the US. The place should be a paradise. It's not.
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:51.800]  It was as rich per capita as the US in the 1950s. Argentina was more rich on average.
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:58.440]  I actually wouldn't look up the numbers. I thought it was as rich. Both countries are hell holes now.
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:06.920]  How those red flags working out for you. Oh, I know the imperialist pigs did it all. Oh,
[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:11.320]  you mean the big multinational banks that come in and fund socialism and communism in your country?
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:15.160]  So they have one big corrupt government that gets everybody domesticated so they can then
[01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:23.640]  bankrupt you. You know who the best debtors ever were to chase Goldman Sachs, the IMF and World Bank?
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:30.280]  Venezuela, per capita, paid back debts better than anybody ever did and paid back more.
[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:34.920]  Oh, Goldman Sachs likes a good commie.
[01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:42.040]  Now, this other story is up on infowars.com. I should have been talking about this for minute one.
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:49.080]  Very important to get this out. First, Black Miss Alabama says she can't help but feel
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:54.920]  Dallas Shooter was a martyr. I don't feel sad for the officers who lost their lives.
[01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:03.800]  Really, I feel sad for anybody I see.
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:11.480]  When they had that dark cop in San Francisco shoot the Black man in the back who'd done
[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:15.560]  nothing wrong, was in handcuffs and then cover it up. I called for that guy to be in prisons
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:19.960]  and he was put in prison only two years. That was wrong. And the police lied about what happened
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:23.480]  and said that he'd tried to scuffle and take the cop's gun. It was horrible. It's corruption. It's
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:29.080]  what I expose. But that's the low level stuff, folks. Not all of us having our rights taken,
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:36.200]  world government being brought in, being medically attacked, all this compartmentalization.
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:42.520]  And why shouldn't she say he's a martyr? You've got Hillary and Obama and everybody
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:46.200]  saying, listen up. Yeah, we need to reform the police. Right after the cops are shot.
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:49.400]  Like it's legitimate. Yeah, cops are getting killed because you're not reformed.
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:54.920]  And the New York Times even has an article out because statistics are a fact
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:59.400]  that police do not shoot Blacks on average more than they shoot Whites or anybody else.
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:10.520]  But that they do search them more. And then it has the statistics because on average,
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:15.960]  they shoot cops 10 times more often. And why is that? Because in the hood, that's the culture
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:21.080]  that's been made cool by the media. And by everybody else is kill a cop, shoot a cop,
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:25.480]  get it done. Just get it done. It's tough. It's manly. Get it done. Get it done. Here,
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:30.840]  where are these baggy pants? That's what a punk wears in prison. In prison, if you're seen as a
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:36.680]  female that gets extra goodies and stuff because you bend over for whoever gives you $5, that's
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:46.680]  what a punk is. 30, 40 years ago, punk ass bitches is the term in prison. Punk ass bitches have
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:51.960]  their pants hanging down. And that's why MTV is a joke in the 80s made it cool. And it's still the
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:57.640]  style to wear your pants hanging down. So when you get to prison, everybody laughs because you're
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:08.680]  a punk ass bitch. That's what a punk is. A punk gets bent over. And so MTV Sumner Redstone,
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:18.040]  a big fat evil racist sits there and teaches you how to be a punk and hires these rock bands and
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:23.080]  hip hop bands and groups to dress like that. And notice it never goes out of style because you're
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:28.280]  being inducted. The cops see you. They're trained before you ever dress like that to be cool.
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:32.760]  This is what a punk looks like. Normally, once they're out, a low level drug dealer.
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:38.520]  They're like, if you identify this, this is the garb of a gang. Then the kids wear the stuff to
[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:44.280]  look cool. The cops are like trained dogs to go after that. That's what they're trained to go after.
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:51.800]  So if you're a doxin that's trained to go after badgers and a doxin sees a badger who goes chasing
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:55.960]  after it and then they train you how to dress up in a uniform that's going to have the system come
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:01.400]  after you. Let me tell you, if you're a black person walking along wearing a nice shirt, nice
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:05.480]  pants, whole nine yards, you're going to get left alone a lot more than you are if you're
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:09.480]  dressed like a punk. If I dress like a punk, I'd be messed with when I'm walking around a sports
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:15.000]  jacket and stuff. Doors are open. Everything else. And I'm out in public. I'm watching. You see
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:19.400]  black ladies, black guys dressed in eye people are open doors. Yes, sir. What do you need? I mean,
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:22.600]  I don't know where these places are where you see the cops pulling over and asking. I'm sure it's
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:27.080]  going on. The point is, is that the reason for the whole civil war? Is that the reason this guy
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:34.280]  is a martyr? No. You've been set up by the media. You bring set up again. The media is run by foreign
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:41.960]  banks that are raping everyone. Let's play this clip. First Black Miss Alabama says she can't help
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:45.160]  feel Dallas shooter was a martyr. I'm going to break her back with your calls directly. Stay with
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:52.680]  us. Hi, Facebook. Um, I'm just reaching out to everybody because I'm just leaving church. Look
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:56.840]  how scared she looks. I prayed a lot about everything that's happened this week. She really
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:02.760]  believes there has been killed. I can't stop replaying the image of these men being killed
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:09.640]  in my mind and my heart weeps. But I think more than anything, I'm dealing with a bit of guilt
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:20.600]  because you didn't do what the martyr did. This is mental illness in my view because I don't feel
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:27.800]  I don't feel sad for the officers that lost their lives. And I know that that's really not
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:34.920]  my heart. Hit pause. We're going to go back. I told you about the lady I know who won't go
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:38.680]  outside because she thinks the cops are going to kill her son and she's white.
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:46.760]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:54.920]  Last week, we pointed out the globalists have declared open season on free individuals and
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:59:00.520]  nations worldwide. When the British left the Euro, the globalists decided to go into high gear.
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:04.520]  They've now announced that Hillary won't be indicted no matter how many crimes she commits.
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:08.440]  It's time for us to take our matters into our own hands. The globalist warfare model
[01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:12.920]  is siege. It wants to make us dependent. It wants to cut off our economies. It wants to be able to
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:17.560]  set up a worldwide financial crisis where there are food shortages that are already happening
[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:21.480]  in most parts of the world where they basically bring us to our knees and where we can pitch
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:26.520]  like their demands. That's why we're extending the July 4th sale right through next week because
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:31.880]  it's all about declaring your independence from the globalist. You don't just declare independence
[01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:36.840]  when you buy high quality, storeable foods or water filters or shortwave radios at infowarstore.com.
[01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:41.640]  You declare independence when you share links of articles and videos and information from the
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:51.800]  broadcast because there's a warrant for your mind. It's a total 360 win at infowarstore.com.
[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:29.960]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:33.720]  We've got two hours left in the worldwide transmission. We're going to start taking
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:37.800]  your phone calls right now and then I'm going to finish up some clips, get into the economic news,
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:42.360]  the military news. I remember talking about this 15 years ago. It wasn't hard to guess. I mean it was
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:46.760]  all of a pop culture but the Pentagon had drones already obviously. It was going to go to combat
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:50.920]  robots on the ground replacing humans and then we'd actually have articles going conspiracy
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:55.480]  theorists claims this is happening. That's just what they do to get people not to look at what's
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:01.000]  happening. Conspiracy theorists say there's death panels in Obamacare. Yeah, we have the subsection
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:07.800]  now. It's there. Conspiracy theorists claim you can't keep your doctor. Told you they just stall you
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:12.760]  with that term and I know you know that. But it's crazy. I haven't even gotten to know what's happening
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:18.280]  in Europe with the Muslims and again they're now bringing in not the educated upper crust Muslims
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:24.440]  folks who I've known and are really smart amazing people. I'll just be honest and make that statement.
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:31.720]  They're pretty smart informed folks. They're bringing in third world hardcore Muslims that
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:34.920]  man I mean if they see your wife cut show it a little bit of her face they kill her.
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:42.280]  And it's just a head of French police migrant sex assaults could trigger civil war. That's the plan.
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:47.080]  Notice all the terms I kept telling you are now in you know the New York Times, the LA Times civil
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:51.560]  war could happen. Europe civil would be like oh Alex quit fear mongering soon as trying to cause
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:57.960]  a civil war. I know their program. I'm not that smart man they told us what they're gonna do.
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:00.680]  You know that's why I'm so frustrated at this point.
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:09.720]  Syrian refugee assaults girl 13 at Boston pool. They can't hide that because it's in front of all
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:18.440]  the witnesses. That's the culture. You want a woman? Take her. It's not that that's old world. I mean
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:21.800]  if you're a woman in areas of say Italy or something you're good looking you're young
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:26.440]  you're showing some skirt you're showing some leg men are gonna hit on you. Hey hey let's go out
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:30.520]  come on. I mean that's what you're advertising that's what you're showing. The feminists say hey
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:34.440]  don't do that that's wrong okay whatever but it's a free country. I mean I don't really do that.
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:38.600]  Back before I was married or whatever I mean a woman you're sitting there checking out
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:42.520]  there I should ask you questions. Hey what do you do? It's like well what do I do? Let's go see
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:52.920]  a movie sweetheart. Let's take you out to dinner. Feminists say that's bad too but oh you want to
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:03:02.680]  come over here and start raping people that's fine. Carl Lagerfeld is now saying Paris is now a
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:08.600]  nightmare even CNN now admits it's like a third world pit. Oh you just destroyed your big fabulous
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:13.800]  thing. You just totally turned into like a Star Wars spacebar scene.
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:23.240]  Not with all these different cultures and groups bringing you know quality
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:28.120]  because you didn't bring the quality ones in. There is great diversity to be able to go in an
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:32.520]  area and have the best Chinese food or the best Middle Eastern Mediterranean food or
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:40.040]  from mouth watering. I mean great yeah but no multiculturalism bringing giant huge groups
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:45.160]  and then piss them all off and wind them all up and have the media instigated. Oh you got screwed
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:50.520]  over oh you got cheated wrong and the whites are so oh my god I'm a minister I was just raped at the
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:55.480]  bus terminal by four men. I'm a German minister. I'll cover it up and say it was whites because I
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:04:00.360]  mean you talk about Stockholm syndrome freakazoid and now top designers and and just you know the
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:06.280]  liberal elite are like where's my beloved Paris it's gloomy and scary and and there's it's like
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:13.720]  Islamabad. Well I thought that's what you wanted. But it is freaky to walk in a mall and be outnumbered
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:17.640]  and the women you can't see their faces it's like what the fuck. I mean you know and you're with
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:21.640]  your daughters you're just I mean I started having an anxiety attack. I've never had anxiety attacks
[02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:25.320]  in my life. I knew what it was when I was having it the other night. I was actually because I kept
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:33.320]  rounding the I was like oh god help me. I mean because it's crazy. It's nuts. Women with freaking
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:38.920]  hoods on their heads. It makes you want to throw up because I'm a liberal. They make those women do
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:44.600]  that from birth. It's wrong. They cut their genitals off and I got to sit there and watch huge
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:50.120]  motion pictures made where I'm an Islamophobe and a racist because I don't want genitals cut off my
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:54.840]  daughters. Listen you bastards I don't know what your freaking problem is in the New World Order
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:05:01.720]  but we're gonna beat your ass get ready phone calls coming up. It's the summer of riots. This
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:06.760]  past weekend writers and Baton Rouge and St. Paul threw monotone cocktails, fireworks, glass bottles,
[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:11.800]  concrete slabs and even bricks at riot police. Overall 200 protesters were arrested between
[02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:16.680]  the two cities. Even more according to ABC News the St. Paul protesters who started rioting at
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:21.160]  the governor's mansion forced the closure of Interstate 94. Some riders threw objects and
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:26.200]  dropped liquids from overpasses on officers below while others targeted laser pointers at police.
[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:30.600]  Interestingly a prominent Black Lives Matter activist said he hoped the Justice Department
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:34.760]  intervenes and that's exactly what the Obama administration and Hitler Clinton want to do.
[02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:39.960]  As we previously reported President Obama is fueling racial tensions between African Americans
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:44.200]  and the police to justify a federal takeover of local law enforcement. Do you really want a
[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:47.800]  police officer to pull you over on the side of the road and arrest you for a federal law that
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:52.280]  originated from the UN? Expansion of federal control will only lead to an expansion of the
[02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:57.080]  police state which is exact opposite of what the protesters want. This is Kit Daniels reporting
[02:05:57.080 --> 02:06:03.000]  for infoworse.com. Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it.
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:08.440]  Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares
[02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:14.120]  me the most. I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages
[02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:20.520]  in my system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful
[02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:26.360]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease

[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:28.680]  your phone calls michael raptor man imit eva jeremy right now and then i'm going to play the rest
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:35.720]  of the clip of miss alabama saying that she feels like the guy that shot the cops in dallas was
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:42.200]  martyr we just played black lives matter leaders leading the protest in in portland
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:47.480]  saying let's kill the police let's go out and run them over let's kill them let's shoot them
[02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:51.960]  and then reportedly they were roughing up or attacking some blogger who was a white
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:57.400]  i guess a white devil and as he pulls a gun out so now they're charging him with a felony
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:02.760]  for pulling the gun and saying back off uh so we have all of that going on meanwhile the wall
[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:08.760]  street journal police swipe at obama over tensions some law enforcement officials say president has
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:14.280]  helped so distrust between police minorities some law enforcement officials say that grass is green
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:22.600]  i love how they take the government the federal government the media in open war against local
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:29.560]  government hyping the almost non-existent story of police killing innocent black men
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:33.720]  i mean almost non-existent and causes the death of black people
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:39.960]  then that's how statistics work and hyping it like it is the end of the world to bring in un
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:45.800]  control that's official if you're a new listener the un with the attorney general is openly setting
[02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:53.560]  up offices in every city to monitor police they're suing joe arpio you cannot make this up and then
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:10:00.120]  by the time it hits the news it's well some police claim obama's kind of obama i have a clip coming
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:07.480]  up let's just play this down on one of your calls this is obama this is obama compares
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:16.040]  blm cop killing to woman's suffrage movement on cbs news women's one of the great things about
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:27.880]  america is that individual citizens and groups of citizens can petition their government can protest
[02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:40.360]  can speak truth to power truth to power and that is sometimes messy and controversial
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:50.520]  but because of that ability to protest and engage in free speech america over time has
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:11:00.200]  gotten better we've all benefited from that you know the abolition movement was contentious
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:09.960]  the effort for women to get the right to vote was contentious and messy look at that hardcore
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:16.680]  guys were trying to win these guys know exactly what they're doing activists might have engaged in
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:25.560]  rhetoric that was overheated and occasionally counterproductive but the point was to raise issues
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:34.200]  so that we as a society could grapple with them the same was true with the civil rights movement
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:39.880]  and the union movement and the environmental movement and the anti-war movement during vietnam
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:47.240]  and and i think what you're seeing now is part of that long-standing tradition what you're seeing
[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:52.200]  now women's suffrage all of it shooting random police you don't even know their names you just
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:56.680]  shoot them and shoot some black lives matter supporters too while you're at it just randomly
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:08.280]  spray a crowd with uh bullets and then the leader of the free world who won't call islam radical
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:14.280]  or won't even call terror attacks islamic gets up there on tv and talks about women's suffrage
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:18.360]  but hillary's gotten a hundred million bucks from the sawties that execute women that get caught
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:27.960]  driving cars without authorization i mean it's just the most hypocritical crazy town stuff
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:33.000]  i'm gonna go to your calls i'm sorry to give the number out then i go to your calls the number is
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:39.720]  800-25-99-231 800-25-99-231 just make your point i want to hear from you i want to get to the next
[02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:43.320]  person and then we'll take calls right into the next hour when one of the other great
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:46.360]  hosts comes in and they plan to take a lot of calls day of the night i want him to take a ton of
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:49.960]  calls he hasn't taken a ton of calls i got a lot more to get to here but this is a plan
[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:55.880]  and it's just outrageous that they sit there the cynically and do this i mean that is crazy
[02:12:57.400 --> 02:13:01.240]  and they are letting black lives matter call for killing police all over the country
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  in fact it's basically time for citizens arrest i mean i'm surprised they arrested that blogger
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.440]  when folks tried to assault him he pulled out a handgun and said get back that's all he said
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:17.880]  i mean i gotta say if i'm there and i see organized people saying let's go kill cops pull guns out
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:26.600]  cap them and let's run people over with cars i have not been putting myself on that type of
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:34.120]  situation because uh i would really try to stop it i mean it's it's it's people organizing murder
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:41.160]  and it's not some love affair with the police it's a love affair with the country that's on
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:45.880]  its knees the people taking us over are as cold blooded as it gets if you're a teen viewer look
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:54.200]  at that EU minister he's with unelected pure evil and the guy's smiling listening to all this
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:58.280]  these they're doing the same thing with the muslims there except black people are from here
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:02.760]  and have been screwed over and aren't trying to put hoods over women's heads i feel so sorry i'll
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:06.920]  be honest with you i feel so sorry for the average black person that just wants to have a great life
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:13.080]  and live and love great people to have the culture culture attacked scientifically and turned into
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:19.640]  this and be led by obama who is dedicated to making sure africa stays in the stone ages and is
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:24.600]  dedicated to aborting as many black people as he can and keeping them as poor as he can to control
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:32.520]  them i mean that guy i guarantee you is a just anti-human people that's crazy he's he's black how
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:36.920]  do you hate black people look at that look at the the globalists that want to kill everybody
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:42.680]  kill white people too they want to they they hate everybody it isn't about color it's about evil
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:47.080]  the ultimate form of control is to be able to starve somebody and and and tell them what they're
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:51.320]  going to eat and run their lives you can't have air condition you can't have cars he told africans
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:59.240]  in a speech letting his true intentions out i want you to live to be 500 years old and your kids
[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:07.480]  it's people the stars i just loved envision humans by them will definitely all be merged into one
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:14.600]  on distant incredible things building things we can't even imagine and if these people have their
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:18.600]  way that's not happening because they've already decided you're ugly and you're bad and they've
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:26.840]  already decided to get rid of you jeremy and kansas thanks for holding for 50 minutes you're on the
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:33.480]  air and we'll go to michael and raptor go ahead this is a dangerous moment but we the people will
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:37.960]  make it through to american renaissance with courage and vigilance and compassion
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:44.040]  i'm very concerned right now that the context has been created for a follow-up to the seven seven
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:51.720]  american gladio attack in dalis um that has the resonance with uh the daily plaza and the
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:16:00.360]  assassination of kennedy with a potential uh attack this tomorrow tuesday um when obama and
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:06.840]  biden and george w bush and laura bush are all going to be together in a uh symphony center
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:13.000]  who which was uh built by the same engineer who built the world trade center it's ross perot's a
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:18.920]  business partner morton miras and it's named after and so i'm very concerned that that that
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:25.400]  loyal element in secret service and fbi and local law enforcement stay aware it does it's not about
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:31.000]  agreeing with obama's policies and obama is no kennedy in terms of political courage but we know
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:36.840]  that there is a spark that's been lit here that we need to put out and then focus on creating an
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:43.320]  american renaissance with all people of good faith at the table and so you know you know here's the
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:49.480]  deal i don't like to speculate on upcoming terror attacks and when people say this is a false flag
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:53.320]  the media pushed the narrative and hyped it knowing mental patients would do it
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:59.480]  the false flag would be staging it and blaming a group they wanted to go after at this point
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:03.800]  the media wants to push it to make the police capitulate and local governments capitulate
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:09.720]  to a globalist takeover but we will find out tomorrow i appreciate your call let's go ahead
[02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:15.720]  and talk to michael in california on the year hey i'll explain how to talk to you after about 12
[02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:23.560]  to 13 years um so man this thing that happened in dallas has been a little perplexed and some of
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:27.560]  the other things that surround it but one of the things i want to get to wrap the get go you've
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:33.080]  talked about a trump possible assassination i think the bigger target's actually hillary they've got
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:38.040]  so many skeletons in the closet that you can hear the bones crack every time the door gets closed
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:43.960]  but getting on to dallas i am very curious to find out what was written on the wall if anything
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:49.640]  was written on the wall because if something like all lives matter was written on the wall
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:54.760]  that's going to turn everything upside down and that would tell you why the cops are so
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:18:00.680]  perplexed on what he actually wrote you know that's a great point why aren't we being told what he
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:05.160]  wrote on the wall i should be asking that all day to the listeners um that that is a really good
[02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:11.720]  question what do you think i mean why aren't they releasing it maybe i have maybe maybe you know it
[02:18:11.720 --> 02:18:15.720]  might be some girlfriend's name and they just don't want to they just don't want to destroy i mean
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:21.160]  i'm hypothetically thinking they don't want to destroy her life by putting that name out well
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:26.440]  i don't think that's it i think i don't think that's it at all this i mean this almost reminds
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:30.840]  me this was before that uh you you were in your teenage years but i was old enough to remember
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:37.640]  this palace but in california when we had the stockton school shooting they found all kinds of stuff
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:43.080]  in the shooter's room that he was staying at that he was staying in army men all this other crazy
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:49.480]  stuff that doesn't go reported at this point if you go and look at old articles on uh what happened
[02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:55.800]  in the stockton shooting in california which really started what we have now today as far as the new
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:19:01.560]  california gun laws that started at the beginning of that shooting back in stockton but they found
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:06.920]  all kinds of crazy stuff in the room that he was staying in now you have this dollar shooter you
[02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:13.080]  find all kinds of evidence as far as what he was up to it nobody really knows what's going on here
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:19.480]  but the guy was military he was well trained i don't think he was racist i think it's hard for me
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:25.640]  to believe that anybody that has been in the u.s military service is a racist it's very hard for
[02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:31.720]  me to believe that especially after they've been in a combat zone so i'm really curious of what he
[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:37.480]  actually wrote on that wall if you wrote anything at all the great question we will look into it and
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:40.520]  i'm not saying i think it had a girlfriend's name on the wall i'm just saying hypothetically i don't
[02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:45.960]  know why they would block that it could be something political uh who knows uh but uh will
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:50.920]  we'll find out all right raptor man emet blake evan and many others your calls are straight ahead

[02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:30.200]  kiss here's my issue we know that this kill the cops narrative is run out of the white house and
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:37.000]  the globalist media we know it's being done to make local government capitulate to a multinational
[02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:43.400]  system we know political correctness is about destroying free speech and taking over and it's
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:49.480]  going into high gear now admitting it's a totalitarian so that's why people adding theories
[02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:55.800]  to what happened here as if it's its own thing we already know it's part of the larger false flag
[02:24:55.800 --> 02:25:01.160]  narrative of stirring up angry disenfranchised youths who've been taught their victims they've
[02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:05.160]  been taught their losers they've been taught they have no future they've been taught the only way
[02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:10.600]  to man up is to go out and attack the police then the cops freak out and act like goons back in some
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:15.320]  cases and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and sure cops did bad stuff before as well it's just
[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:24.520]  an ongoing living the past groundhog day victimology the globalists want you to live in victimology
[02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:29.400]  not live in the future not live in building your own world and when you have a good attitude
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:34.120]  and when you're successful people resonate with that you're still going to run into jerks i've
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:38.280]  run into jerk police and then arrested for no reason all sorts of stuff there's big problems
[02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:44.840]  but in this time and season the globalists are orchestrating this to bring in a major
[02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:49.640]  civil unrest slash civil war program we're taking your calls right now raptor man from
[02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:55.480]  new york thank you for holding good to have you on with us today how you doing alex good brother
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:26:02.600]  love your organization's work man hey there's the uh davis report that i did an article on
[02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:09.400]  called security outlook to 2030 three alternative scenarios and i'll tell you what they go from
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:15.880]  bad to worse someone reads this article reads the report the scenarios are entitled walled cities
[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:22.920]  strong regions and war and peace and it goes into all kinds of details about what they believe
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:30.840]  the scenario is going to be like going into 2030 goes from bad to worse alex now which particular
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:38.120]  government report is that it's a davis report it's called security outlook to 2030 three alternative
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:44.280]  scenarios i wrote an article on it on my website so i remember that that was a was that this year
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:49.800]  last year it was it was last year yeah when they had a big davis meeting yeah i remember that and
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:57.160]  it's basically a carbon copy of the 2007 and 2006 pentagon and british ministry of defense reports
[02:26:57.160 --> 02:27:03.240]  that talk about there will be a global meltdown there will be a global shutdown starting in 2016
[02:27:03.240 --> 02:27:09.400]  and going into 2030 with walled cities ultra rich with robots defending them everything else
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:15.080]  collapsed and billions dying and of course this is actually their war on humanity scenario
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:19.320]  but they're going to pose as saviors while taking all the resources in and then using
[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:24.600]  anthropology sociology psychology to play off against all the culture groups in divide and
[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:29.880]  conquer so this is a breakaway civilization and how it basically saves the earth from the human
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:35.960]  infestation so this is the globalist seeing themselves as alien saviors exactly if you let
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:40.920]  me quote from the uh from the document it says the three scenarios may come across as somewhat
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:47.240]  dystopian because they are extrapolations of existing negative trends so that's what they
[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:53.240]  think's going to happen absolutely read some more of the loving report well i mean if you
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:57.640]  look at the artwork on it you can go right through it there the artwork is uh pretty amazing how they
[02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:01.960]  do each chapter to the artwork tells you all but let me let me define the international
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:07.880]  security for you as in the document international risk security refers to the measures taken by state
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:14.520]  or non-state actors individually or collectively to ensure their survival and integrity against
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:20.440]  trans boundary threats that's what beginning of the article and so this is two years ago but
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:26.840]  then europe advertises we have open borders come here everything's free rape whoever you want and
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:32.040]  then arrest anyone that criticizes it that's back in the news so again they're acting in these reports
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  about these horrible things that are coming while they make sure they happen
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:41.880]  isn't that just special yeah they never say how they're gonna happen but they just say they're
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:48.520]  gonna happen well i'm glad you wrote an article about i think we we wrote one as well what's
[02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:54.040]  the name of your website uh raptor man reports i actually took your advice took a man known to

[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:22.520]  click on the debuts report itself wow look at the artwork it's like drone all-seeing eye
[02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:28.760]  robots with a swastika in the compact breakaway civilization with satellites ruling everyone
[02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:35.080]  with another all-seeing eye panopticon and then they've got a technocracy over grid uh satellite
[02:29:35.080 --> 02:29:47.000]  layout uh wow man i tell you that is unbelievable wow thank you raptor man for letting us know about that
[02:29:49.320 --> 02:29:56.040]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:59.960 --> 02:30:03.400]  the head of french police warned that the country is on the verge of a civil war
[02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:07.480]  triggered by another mass sexual assault of women by migrants like the one that occurred in cloned
[02:30:07.480 --> 02:30:12.120]  germany on new year's eve as reported by paul joseph watson on info wars dot com the head of
[02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:16.280]  the directorate general of internal security said the situation in france is so potentially
[02:30:16.280 --> 02:30:20.600]  explosive that one more major islamic terror attack or mass migrant sexual assault could
[02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:25.960]  lead to a massive public backlash he said quote i think it will take place even one or two attacks
[02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:30.600]  and it will happen it therefore behooves us to anticipate and block all these groups as we
[02:30:30.600 --> 02:30:34.600]  previously reported hundreds of german women were sexually abused during a series of attacks
[02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:39.240]  that cloned on december 31st the situation that i witnessed is described as a war zone
[02:30:39.240 --> 02:30:43.720]  most of the culprits who were muslim migrants were never charged for the rapes additionally these
[02:30:43.720 --> 02:30:47.560]  muslim migrants from north africa and the middle east have turned the once peaceful country of
[02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:52.840]  sweden into a rape capital of the world second only to a tiny country in southern africa for more
[02:30:52.840 --> 02:30:56.360]  news on the migrant crisis in europe you're not going to find in the mainstream media tune into
[02:30:56.360 --> 02:31:02.520]  info wars dot com this is kit daniel supporting hi i'm dr david jones i've been in practice
[02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:07.400]  for over 30 years in dentistry in our health histories we've always asked what people's
[02:31:07.400 --> 02:31:13.400]  primary complaint were a third of the time it's i want whiter teeth in the early days of dentistry
[02:31:13.400 --> 02:31:19.560]  we used some fairly harsh chemicals in order to bleach the teeth and whiten them and people were
[02:31:19.560 --> 02:31:24.360]  happy with the results even though it created hypersensitivity and some problems that i consider
[02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:31.160]  fairly high risk recently i was exposed to the ghost mild system it allows a whitening gel to
[02:31:31.160 --> 02:31:38.440]  be applied to the teeth with a very good ultrasonic toothbrush system the gel is activated by a
[02:31:38.440 --> 02:31:43.000]  light emitting diode or actually two light emitting diodes so it's a simple and elegant
[02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:48.600]  procedure that delivers office quality whitening and you don't have to spend the six hundred dollars
[02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:53.880]  that typically costs for an in-office treatment in my opinion it's the most elegant and best value
[02:31:53.880 --> 02:32:00.520]  that i've ever seen to get your ghost mild system go to info war store dot com over the years there

[02:33:12.280 --> 02:33:25.080]  alex jones show
[02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:47.240]  i'll be honest with you i guess i am a weirdo
[02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:53.400]  because i think about humanity in the hands of these mad scientists
[02:33:55.160 --> 02:34:00.120]  and i think about how they have all these devos reports they admit they're getting rid of cash
[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:06.760]  to control us they admit they hate us they admit they're gonna break us down or isolated individuals
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:13.080]  with no family no communities they can just euthanize us all they all play god they're a
[02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:20.440]  bunch of wicked twisted ugly people and i just sit there and watch them manipulate the dumb
[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:25.400]  down masses of people that have no idea what's even happening to them that makes me sick i saw
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:33.000]  that report two years ago when it came out saw the freaky artwork and i think i read it in a
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:37.720]  paragraph in one of watson's articles i don't even think we even did a story on it and it's just
[02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:45.480]  this total admission of walled cities total control world government surveillance everywhere
[02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:52.200]  it's literally the intro to endgame the first three minutes of endgame is the first warning
[02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:55.320]  about what their admitted plan is and what they're going to do from their own quotes
[02:34:57.240 --> 02:35:00.360]  and they put them in white papers after white papers after white papers
[02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:04.600]  with a counterclockwise swastika
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:11.800]  with hovering all-seeing eyed drones watching the humans
[02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:19.320]  but what it really means is walled cities and of course that's the name of that paper
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:26.600]  the walled cities are where the elites live in their compact cities mainly in rural areas
[02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:31.640]  new cities they're building and then you go to the next image it has
[02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:39.560]  from the economic world forum that's committed to improving the state of the world we have their
[02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:43.400]  own internal documents it's for shredding the world but if you go back to the first images
[02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:49.800]  we were looking at strong regions means global government you've got the north american union
[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:58.520]  the asian union the european union you've got sub unions and then you've got of course
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:05.160]  war and peace the image of a satellite icbm's coming in tanks
[02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:16.760]  the keyhole through which you see the world and then you read it and it's just a hell planet
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:31.240]  but the people are slaves on their knees giving their power to the all-seeing eye pyramid above
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:39.240]  them just the images and to think that i have been so close to so long that when they admitted
[02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:43.720]  all i don't even cover it i get so mad at myself every day when i got off the air of all the things
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:49.160]  i didn't cover thank god i took that caller seat the problem is i don't take a lot of calls that
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:53.640]  make people hold that only folks that are basically half asleep stay on and then you don't hear all
[02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:58.200]  these incredible callers like the guy that just called in and thank god he took my advice a few
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:02.840]  years ago and started to know him to plume started his own website by the way this this
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:07.320]  stuff's popular you you take news and information write stories you'll get traffic and they can
[02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:12.440]  make a living off of it and a lot of folks go alex quick telling all your listeners to do that
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:16.360]  they'll be all these new big sites and you won't be the only one and get all the traffic i would
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:23.960]  love to be made obsolete and defeat the globalist you think i do this for money they're putting
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:29.160]  hydrofluorosalic acid in the water on record that lowers the IQ massively and gives you
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:36.920]  incredible health problems like cancer we're being murdered they write about it in textbooks
[02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:43.400]  they are arrogant just like they admitted the euro's a tyranny and unelected and finally
[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:49.400]  we force the issue you force the issue collectively and you see it starting to collapse we will beat
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:55.000]  them their only hope is to steal the world's wealth hoard it so we're poor so that when
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:00.040]  everything collapses they control us and i'm not going to sit here and play games these people anymore
[02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:06.520]  listen get outdoors take your kids hiking and camping turn off the television be healthy take
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:12.920]  vitamins and minerals drink purified water get right with god start a garden start going in
[02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:17.160]  with your neighbors and buying a cow and butchering it and saving money just get out of the system
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:21.480]  that's all i can say and believe me none of us are perfect but all of us can start doing little
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:28.600]  things like i'm not going to take the kids and see a hollywood movie i'm not going to uh associate
[02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:32.600]  with the establishment i'm not going to give them my money anymore i don't need stuff from their

[02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:58.120]  i love your show it's been fascinating but as far as this civil unrest i kind of wanted to put you
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:03.160]  know a different spin on it it doesn't surprise me and you and i you know know about this we've
[02:42:03.160 --> 02:42:08.440]  talked about this or at least you have me tonight the dumbing down of our education system and the
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:16.600]  social engineering from first grade on up has created a lot of this i mean their rules in schools
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:23.240]  you can't hug your close friends i always did in grade school and high school i think that is so we
[02:42:23.240 --> 02:42:28.920]  don't lock arms against the new world order if we're not close to each other you know but then
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:33.880]  they say homosexuality is great and that really confuses the kids but then they say hugging your
[02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:39.560]  friends that's homosexual it's this new world order get yourself exactly no no can't have dodge
[02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:43.720]  ball can't have tag don't go outside if you they catch your kids playing outside the police you
[02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:49.880]  know take them away under orders this is the end of normal human activity the domestication the
[02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:57.640]  enslavement the isolation they know in every study in fact just google it children not held close for
[02:42:57.640 --> 02:43:04.360]  hours a day by their mothers and fathers have massively lower IQ and don't even live as long
[02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:11.320]  i mean people are wrecks that are not i mean folks let me tell you something your small
[02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:16.440]  children should be sleeping with you at night they should be up against your skin at least
[02:43:16.440 --> 02:43:21.240]  an hour during the day until they're two people say oh i can't stand having kids you know they
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:25.880]  they're always clinging and stuff they are meant to be on you till they're two years old you're
[02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:29.560]  meant i mean my kids just always are hugging me always are kissing people say man your kids are
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:34.120]  so nice they're they're so happy they're always they love you what is going on and it's because
[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:43.000]  i've given them nurture but i know mothers and i know people who basically can't give affection
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.720]  to their kids because they didn't have it and again sir most formulates two-thirds
[02:43:47.720 --> 02:43:51.720]  high fructose corn syrup it's deadly full of mercury lead you name it but that's not even the
[02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:57.160]  issue the brain you know i mean you look at the different ratios of human milk but it's almost
[02:43:57.160 --> 02:44:03.160]  all basically fat and then a fat protein and then some sugar well it's almost all sugar the children
[02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:10.600]  are brain damaged okay i'm putting early neglect alters kids brains live science read about it
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:16.040]  for yourself so that's what's going on here these children all of this the the scientists came up
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:23.000]  with plans 200 years ago in england to create servile minions and they started putting children
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:28.040]  in cribs all day long and stop letting them sleep with their parents and stop holding them and this
[02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:34.440]  is all part of the death of humanity anything else in it yes absolutely of course the psychiatric
[02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:39.400]  medications and you know the microaggressions you can't have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
[02:44:39.400 --> 02:44:44.680]  until a friend it'll offend the black people at your school so the kids can't think straight
[02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:49.160]  so they go out screaming about the police screaming black lives matter and there are a lot of white
[02:44:49.160 --> 02:44:54.920]  kids you know teenagers young adults who've been brainwashed by the education system and they don't
[02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:59.880]  even know how to think straight they don't go outside or again and they don't know history
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:05.480]  i mean 50 years ago or 60 years ago they wouldn't have been you know you know i don't know how
[02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:10.440]  to um bought into this they wouldn't have bought into all these lives and all these high and imagine
[02:45:10.440 --> 02:45:14.280]  they were able to think critically they keep opening and expanding it to literally say
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:19.240]  you said brownie we're calling the police well no i want brownies a brownie you're calling me a
[02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:26.040]  brownie oh my gosh peanut butter and jelly that's what black people like i thought that's what i like
[02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:30.440]  i used to give that at least once a week you know in my school last mom would send me like that asked
[02:45:30.440 --> 02:45:35.000]  for it but the point in fact i'd get a dessert a lot of times of that and then also the you know
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:40.360]  the ham and cheese sandwich but the point is exactly total mental illness where the kids are all
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:45.560]  uh brownie uh but peanut butter jelly sandwich that is written by psych ward chiefs to create
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:51.080]  gibbering mental patients people always call liberals idiots no the ones on top are the most
[02:45:51.080 --> 02:45:56.680]  savage criminal predators using psychology the world's ever seen they know what they're doing
[02:45:56.680 --> 02:46:04.760]  it's funny to them go ahead no it's horrible um one other thing i was just kind of as long as i
[02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:09.160]  have you're really happy to be able to talk to you i'm still worried that they're going to topple
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:13.000]  donald trump at next week's next convention and that's why we're going to want to admit
[02:46:13.720 --> 02:46:18.840]  yeah we're want to met romney and and this is what are we to do i mean they're going to steal
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:23.880]  our election i don't want hillary but one way or the other with you know with the brainwashing
[02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:29.400]  the schools whatever happens there's going to be blood in the streets there's going to be
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:34.520]  riots like you couldn't believe especially if they do nominate trump i'm a huge trump supporter
[02:46:34.520 --> 02:46:39.160]  i really love trump but boy i mean well sir i'm going to be there covering it but you're absolutely
[02:46:39.160 --> 02:46:43.160]  right it's an epic time to be alive listen here's the deal we've seen the social engineering they
[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:48.040]  call liberalism it's not it's psych warfare to screw society up and turn people into gibbering
[02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:55.320]  basket cases who can be put in on their knees with a word it's mind control with super conditioning
[02:46:55.320 --> 02:47:01.640]  pavlovian brainwashing i mean they admitted it thank you emin and we've got to change course now
[02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:06.600]  now the problem is the republican leadership is part of the same global crime syndicate
[02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:13.720]  and they are racing to finish their plan and complete the dumbing down and we've got to
[02:47:13.720 --> 02:47:18.840]  rehabilitate so-called liberals these are cult members and you can get people out of cults
[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:23.320]  once you are able to talk to them i mean look calling police because someone says they want
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:28.280]  brownies or banning peanut butter and jelly sandwiches because they're racist or banning
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:35.560]  halloween parties this isn't an overreaction of something good this is scientific mental illness
[02:47:35.560 --> 02:47:41.400]  waging war against culture and language and ending debate and human behavior this is a cult
[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:46.120]  takeover that's why you see the whole power structure pushing it people think going on
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:51.000]  shooting cops battles the establishment it's bringing in the globalist takeover that is
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:59.400]  hell on earth eva in texas you're on the air hi alex i have an update and a point to make about
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:08.280]  black lives matter as you know alex this past friday the brave local police chief african-american
[02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:16.520]  of opasso texas made the statement to the media that the black lives matter is a radical group
[02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:27.240]  well he's now being persecuted by some local members here including the judge bronica eskibar
[02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:36.520]  and the infamous congressman bethory or orc who is the same congressman who denied the judicial
[02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:43.160]  watch report that we have open voters and that is coming here he's okay absolutely i mean the
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:47.720]  police chief came out we played the clip and he said they are a radical hate group well they are
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:53.320]  they're a terrorist organization meant to terrorize local government into submitting to a multinational
[02:48:53.320 --> 02:49:02.840]  takeover well well you know he bethory orc wrote a letter demanding that the police chief be disciplined
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:08.120]  okay now the police chief the liberal media have been calling him he's not answering the phones and
[02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:13.400]  he's not backing down so i wanted to share that with you now the other thing i just wanted to
[02:49:13.400 --> 02:49:19.160]  tell you as you know many people who have gone on facebook and have said all lives matter their
[02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:26.440]  accounts are removed well you know what all got children matter and anyone who has a problem with
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:37.960]  all got children matter is satanic that's veritas other points yeah that is all alex thank you
[02:49:37.960 --> 02:49:45.400]  very much for everything you do you look fantastic by the way well you're sweetheart i appreciate
[02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:54.120]  those kind words let me expand on what she just said because it's very simple but also very profound
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:02.120]  facebook i mean that's admitted but it just hit me i've seen that so many times but it hit me so hard
[02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:10.600]  that facebook zuckerberg slammed staff for all lives matter stance because not only are they
[02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:14.440]  censoring people on facebook that say it it's happened to us and others
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:24.440]  laura southern you name it but his own people were writing it on a chalkboard and he slammed them
[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:33.560]  and you ask why would he do that because in 1984 when o brian's torturing winston winston says the
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:38.040]  ability to say two plus two equals four is freedom if i could say that i can be free and he tortures
[02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:41.720]  him to a point he doesn't even know that anymore and that's what they're saying if you can't say
[02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:47.960]  all lives matter and all god's children are equal and that you can let zuckerberg define that only
[02:50:47.960 --> 02:50:53.160]  black lives matter it has nothing to do with black lives it has to do with illogic and overthrowing
[02:50:53.160 --> 02:50:57.960]  reality and that's what they're doing two plus two they're saying doesn't equal four

[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:19.480]  and so my dad about a week later comes over to my house he goes you got more of those that's
[02:55:19.480 --> 02:55:25.480]  incredible uh you know where'd you get that and i said that's probably going to be a sponsor i'm
[02:55:25.480 --> 02:55:30.280]  thinking about carrying them ourselves uh they're really uh great he goes yeah he goes the ultrasonic
[02:55:30.280 --> 02:55:34.760]  level is like better than six hundred dollar toothbrushes we used to sell and he goes it's
[02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:40.520]  something i always said they needed it has this um ultraviolet light and it's strong that kills
[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:48.040]  bacteria while that's going on and it's just so affordable and so i bought a giant mass of these
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:53.400]  uh and uh you can get the second one for something like well it's more than 25 off
[02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:58.680]  that's a great toothbrush when you purchase it it funds our operation it's available at
[02:55:58.680 --> 02:56:04.600]  infowarstore.com now this is not the regular toothbrushes that are colloidal silver impregnated

[02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:12.120]  sometimes i use electric other times but since i got this a month or so ago or a few months ago
[02:56:12.120 --> 02:56:18.440]  it's mainly what i've been using and it's also so compact that's another great part about it and
[02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:23.320]  it's just it's it's really is amazing and it's much better than toothbrushes that are three

[02:57:15.640 --> 02:57:20.120]  unlike so many other gels so that's why my dad who's also an oral surgeon and taught
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:27.080]  dentistry at the college level at baler uh is just so so crazy about it so it's good to have him
[02:57:27.080 --> 02:57:31.000]  you know he's involved in some of the nutraceutical development with us because he's done that before
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:35.080]  with stuff that's been approved by the FDA we're not going that route but that's why he's good for
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:39.400]  all the FDA compliance and things that's really his job with the lawyers is to make sure that's all
[02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:44.760]  super kosher and we doctor group test everything three times his suppliers test things then we test
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:50.120]  things again uh just to be you know just to be super neurotic that's his main job but uh it's
[02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:55.880]  kind of funny if my dad's a pretty private guy and uh he looks like colonel sanders or something
[02:57:55.880 --> 02:58:02.120]  up there uh i wish he'd cut that he's had a beard for about 20 years he looks he likes it i don't
[02:58:02.120 --> 02:58:07.320]  know why he has it uh i'm not knocking him here on air just he looks more like me i look more like
[02:58:07.320 --> 02:58:12.520]  him he's a handsome guy with that beard i think i'm gonna wait till he's asleep one night and sneak
[02:58:12.520 --> 02:58:16.680]  in with some shears and cut it off but now he's had it 20 something years my kids all know him
[02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:22.840]  with it he cut it off about six months ago and the whole family was like whoa david you don't have
[02:58:22.840 --> 02:58:27.640]  the the beard the good he used to be a full beard back before that was cool like 15 years ago he had
[02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:33.400]  the beard then he went to the little goatee in the uh colonel sanders look uh and so the truth is
[02:58:33.400 --> 02:58:37.800]  i'm not just bill hex i'm actually a clone of colonel sanders he's the first clone of the
[02:58:37.800 --> 02:58:42.760]  original colonel sanders uh get the toothbrush at m4warstore.com or come back take a few calls stay

[03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:39.080]  this is good music when you're uh in a jeep or something rumbling down the sand dunes knowing
[03:00:39.080 --> 03:00:45.640]  you're about to hit the beach about five minutes hit the beach there's a big bonfire a lot of happy
[03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:57.880]  people dancing around it i'm sorry i know a lot of folks who are probably not miss its listeners
[03:00:57.880 --> 03:01:03.000]  and i'm just gonna stop this at this point right now i could be in a bad mood and this really makes
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:13.240]  me happy aunt farmer who disagrees go ahead uh ant farmer you're on the air alex rather than uh
[03:01:13.240 --> 03:01:19.160]  uh thanking you like everybody else does i'd like to know how do you have multiple articles
[03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:27.080]  multiple shows specifically about cell phone and cancer yet you make your listeners wait
[03:01:27.080 --> 03:01:35.000]  for almost an hour well i have never said that i'm not a hypocrite uh but i think that
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:42.520]  hypocritical argument you just put out is crazy how is it my fault that you are on a cell phone
[03:01:42.520 --> 03:01:48.280]  if you made that decision and not a landline or let's go further i only made you hold like five
[03:01:48.280 --> 03:01:53.160]  minutes you were given preferential treatment because you disagreed and i always want to put
[03:01:53.160 --> 03:01:58.680]  the ignorance on display sure so there's other people that are holding so i'll get quickly to
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:02:02.280]  my point well no no no no no let's let we're gonna hold you over the next seven weeks and we're
[03:02:02.280 --> 03:02:05.240]  gonna get to tom and margaret and black and everybody and then and then a day but not but
[03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:10.680]  but let's let's lovingly walk through all this can we we're just a moment i'll just have people
[03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:14.440]  disagree all day that's that really wakes me up because i've been it's to interface with you is
[03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:23.000]  so freaky you just claimed that i'm a horrible person exposing cell phone radiation but then
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:28.840]  i'm getting people to contribute to using the cell phones i've said apple's one of the worst
[03:02:28.840 --> 03:02:33.480]  companies when it comes to treating its employees and it's its factory contractors and i admit
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:38.840]  that i then have one because it's an easier operating system for me than a droid and i use
[03:02:38.840 --> 03:02:43.720]  it for limited things and i think it out balances days for good the photos the videos i shoot
[03:02:43.720 --> 03:02:47.480]  exposing the whole system it's like if i'm a soldier on a battlefield and i pick up the
[03:02:47.480 --> 03:02:52.040]  enemy's weapon to use it against them but i point out the problems with it and i point out the issues
[03:02:52.040 --> 03:02:56.760]  and i say i'm not perfect so i could see some hypocritical argument there how i'm bad but how
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:01.800]  in a million years is making you hold just a few minutes going right to you and that you
[03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:09.640]  disagree with me because i am making people fry their brains on cell phones i've called in before
[03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:14.280]  and waited over an hour so that puts but you're you're in a victimology you're probably a big
[03:03:14.280 --> 03:03:17.880]  liberal and so you're mad that you've had to hold to be on the show i mean this is just crazy you're
[03:03:17.880 --> 03:03:23.400]  like bitching about some side issue that doesn't matter it's a popular show brother hey i think i
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:27.960]  have a right to i got five bottles of dna force in front of me i think i have a right to be able
[03:03:27.960 --> 03:03:32.680]  to okay well you have a right to criticize me anyway sir before you said you have five bottles
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:38.200]  of dna force and i appreciate your support uh that that's hold on just a second you have a right to
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:42.680]  call in if you don't buy some from us but let me just say something now be honest what did dna force
[03:03:42.680 --> 03:03:50.840]  do i haven't done anything for me yet and you really have you know you have five bottles of
[03:03:50.840 --> 03:03:57.640]  hey alex i quit smoking taking x2 your listeners know me very well can i get to the comparison
[03:03:57.640 --> 03:04:01.800]  that i wanted to make between black lives matter you can but you're the one hold on we're going
[03:04:01.800 --> 03:04:06.760]  to go over the break i'm gonna hold you because more you got a cell phone there the only thing i
[03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:12.600]  have i work am i supposed to use a landline when i'm a treatment well no but you could use you i i
[03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:15.640]  do want to go more to skype and stuff so folks have to do that where they can just call in the
[03:04:15.640 --> 03:04:20.440]  main line i think skype can or they've got computer phones they can call sir i think it's a red

[03:04:59.880 --> 03:05:04.200]  it's the summer of riots this past weekend rioters and baton ruse and st paul threw
[03:05:04.200 --> 03:05:09.240]  monotov cocktails fireworks glass bottles concrete slabs and even bricks at riot police
[03:05:09.240 --> 03:05:14.360]  overall two under protesters were arrested between the two cities even more according to abc news the
[03:05:14.360 --> 03:05:19.000]  st paul protesters who started rioting at the governor's mansion forced the closure of interstate
[03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:24.280]  94 some rioters threw objects and dropped liquids from overpasses on officers below while others
[03:05:24.280 --> 03:05:29.240]  targeted laser pointers at police interestingly a prominent black lives matter activist said he
[03:05:29.240 --> 03:05:33.320]  hoped that justice department intervenes and that's exactly what the obama ministration to
[03:05:33.320 --> 03:05:38.120]  hillard clinton want to do as we previously reported president obama is fueling racial
[03:05:38.120 --> 03:05:42.680]  tensions between african-americans and the police to justify a federal takeover of local
[03:05:42.680 --> 03:05:46.280]  law enforcement do you really want a police officer to pull you over on the side of the road and
[03:05:46.280 --> 03:05:51.000]  rescue for a federal law that originated from the un expansion of federal control will only
[03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:55.640]  lead to an expansion of the police state which is exact opposite of what the protesters want

[03:08:06.840 --> 03:08:26.840]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[03:08:29.800 --> 03:08:35.080]  all right day to night has a really timely guest coming on an expert on driverless cars a bunch of
[03:08:35.080 --> 03:08:41.960]  tesla deaths last week military robotics makers see a future for armed police robots we just saw
[03:08:41.960 --> 03:08:47.240]  this reported shooter in dallas killed by a robot so it shows where all of this is going day was
[03:08:47.240 --> 03:08:52.680]  going to break it some of that down and more of it will be popping in here in just a second with us
[03:08:53.240 --> 03:08:58.280]  but ant farmer and to be fair i i get lost in the shovel sometimes and make mistakes
[03:08:58.280 --> 03:09:03.240]  he was saying he didn't like dna force that he didn't get any response from it but that he did
[03:09:03.240 --> 03:09:09.960]  from survival shield nascent iodine x2 well um then he probably doesn't have nerve damage
[03:09:09.960 --> 03:09:17.080]  or other stuff because dna force is patented over 700 studies the ingredients that are patented
[03:09:17.080 --> 03:09:23.080]  like the bio pqq the true the true one the v patented real one you can absorb their synthetic
[03:09:23.080 --> 03:09:27.400]  fakes that cost more than what we sell ours for we buy it from mission bc america just that one
[03:09:27.400 --> 03:09:33.560]  ingredient so that's that's a neurological super nutraceutical um
[03:09:36.120 --> 03:09:40.120]  i was thinking i thought he said brain force and he wasn't getting an effect off that
[03:09:40.840 --> 03:09:45.960]  brain force is strong and i can't take more than one of some folks take two or three and
[03:09:45.960 --> 03:09:51.240]  are literally climbing the walls around here and it's a powerful new tropic but but i'm gonna
[03:09:51.240 --> 03:09:54.600]  show about that go back to ant farmer uh ant farmer you said you disagree with me on the black
[03:09:54.600 --> 03:10:00.600]  lives matter situation go ahead and i'll continue taking the supplements because i don't think you're
[03:10:00.600 --> 03:10:06.120]  lying about it i don't think you're trying to force people but i think your best criticism is
[03:10:06.120 --> 03:10:11.480]  going to come from people who've been listening to you for 20 years well i listen i listen i love
[03:10:11.480 --> 03:10:17.720]  people that calling and disagree so just go ahead i'm i'm sorry black lives matter has been around
[03:10:17.720 --> 03:10:25.720]  for about two years they've generated tens of millions of dollars they've had about 1500 demonstrations
[03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:33.400]  info wars has been around for more than 20 years 110 million dollars has passed through your hand
[03:10:34.280 --> 03:10:40.680]  how many demonstrations have you had i think more money than that's come through here probably
[03:10:40.680 --> 03:10:46.440]  that's an old number um i mean it costs millions and millions and millions and millions a year just
[03:10:46.440 --> 03:10:52.440]  to pay for bandwidth i don't want to tell people much i mean it's crazy but we're very effective and
[03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:57.160]  we're an information war we're changing the narrative we're exposing larger operations
[03:10:57.720 --> 03:11:01.160]  i've been out to many demonstrations we've had hundreds of demonstrations i'm going to cleveland
[03:11:01.160 --> 03:11:07.000]  i'm actually financing i have to pay 30 000 for the police i'm paying 10 000 the check was sent
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:12.120]  last week i'm putting aircraft in the air i'm we just signed a contract to put trucks
[03:11:12.120 --> 03:11:17.640]  driving around all day with a huge hillar for prison uh all over cleveland i'm and i mean i'm
[03:11:17.640 --> 03:11:23.000]  fighting so i don't think that's that's fair criticism i mean but but why am i being compared
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:29.240]  to black lives matter black lives matter has the entire mainstream media backing it and facebook
[03:11:29.240 --> 03:11:33.640]  backing it and google backing it and and the white house because it's creating division
[03:11:34.440 --> 03:11:40.120]  and distracting people of the red herring of police i used to buy into this red herring of police
[03:11:40.120 --> 03:11:45.080]  so sort of looking at statistics okay i mean i've made books i've made films i've written books
[03:11:45.640 --> 03:11:51.720]  look get to the heart what is your criticism uh ant farmer my criticism is this is that
[03:11:51.720 --> 03:11:56.200]  we see your face every day and just like you've said you've admitted there needs to be somebody
[03:11:56.200 --> 03:12:02.840]  else it's not me i've been funding you so i have the right to be able to say this without being told
[03:12:02.840 --> 03:12:07.880]  that i'm mentally ill or i have some kind of grudge well well i'm look i think if you're a
[03:12:07.880 --> 03:12:11.640]  mainline black lives matter supporter something's wrong with you i mean is that what you're saying
[03:12:13.160 --> 03:12:17.800]  alex what i'm saying is they're getting a lot more done in two years than what infowars is
[03:12:17.800 --> 03:12:25.000]  getting done in 20 years okay what are they getting done other than creating massive division
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:30.520]  getting innocent people killed and making the police not respond to to to inner city areas
[03:12:30.520 --> 03:12:35.160]  as crime rates double and triple so are you willing to tell me that every single person
[03:12:35.160 --> 03:12:41.960]  that you've seen a black lives matter even the white people are murderers um are we talking
[03:12:41.960 --> 03:12:48.920]  about the same issues here you just said that black lives matters are promoting murdering cops
[03:12:49.720 --> 03:12:54.520]  are you being specific to yeah i think the whole black nationalist movement that ap's got an
[03:12:54.520 --> 03:13:00.200]  article today police agencies on edge on guard amid heightened threats uh attacks on police inspired
[03:13:00.200 --> 03:13:07.080]  or directed by militant groups i mean at the heart of this thing even even loose fair con
[03:13:07.080 --> 03:13:11.080]  who used to get mad and say if you kill us we're gonna kill you back well yeah the person that kills
[03:13:11.080 --> 03:13:16.280]  you for no reason then yes defend yourself but even he's going hey well we don't want a civil war
[03:13:16.280 --> 03:13:21.640]  he sees what's going on this is a plan to set black people up okay and so you're having a
[03:13:21.640 --> 03:13:29.000]  fundamental disagreement black lives matter is run out of the justice department sir well sir
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:32.680]  the six what are they getting done what are they getting done and farmer what are they getting
[03:13:32.680 --> 03:13:39.400]  done the 60 year old white woman that you see in the protest she's getting more done than we
[03:13:39.400 --> 03:13:45.240]  are getting done in 20 years the woman with a bernie shirt hillary clinton lying and getting away
[03:13:45.240 --> 03:13:52.520]  with it over and over i'm talking about your country bombing people as we speak sir this is
[03:13:52.520 --> 03:13:59.880]  no longer about just chat like you say uh listen i mean you're in canada and i hear your country i mean
[03:13:59.880 --> 03:14:06.520]  you know i've been just it's this is a very illogical conversation and farmer this day but
[03:14:06.520 --> 03:14:09.400]  david nine i'm about to let him go take a few calls and handle the time to you but i promise
[03:14:09.400 --> 03:14:13.400]  that these calls do you want to say something and farmer am i missing it am i wrong because i'm
[03:14:13.400 --> 03:14:17.960]  not understanding what he's saying or maybe maybe i'm missing the forest for the trees well let me
[03:14:17.960 --> 03:14:22.200]  say something about the protests you know quite frankly there's a difference between activism
[03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:28.040]  and journalism we keep a foot in both of those but we're not wholly one or the other okay we do
[03:14:28.040 --> 03:14:33.400]  advocate for causes that we believe in we do take a position we report things uh to report the facts
[03:14:33.400 --> 03:14:38.200]  we try to cover the stories but that's what we do to wake people up i think we are having a
[03:14:38.200 --> 03:14:43.880]  difference here but i disagree with him that black lives matter has been a positive influence
[03:14:43.880 --> 03:14:50.440]  they are promoting the kind of white skin privilege that bill errs and obama and all these 60 radicals
[03:14:50.440 --> 03:14:55.480]  that mentored him were the students for democratic society they all grabbed onto this white skin
[03:14:55.480 --> 03:15:00.680]  privilege that's what i talked about uh friday on the nightly news they have grabbed this narrative
[03:15:00.680 --> 03:15:07.000]  they have used it to foster division hatred and rebellion the weathermen basically programmed
[03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:12.680]  obama yeah and they're now using the exact same playbook but they're using the media to hype people
[03:15:12.680 --> 03:15:19.800]  up to do the stuff for them it's all the same terms it's the same people bill errs stopped
[03:15:19.800 --> 03:15:26.600]  bill errs wants for the big board foundations it's all a stinking plan yeah he stopped bombing
[03:15:26.600 --> 03:15:31.640]  buildings bill errs did and his uh weathermen underground okay they stopped bombing buildings
[03:15:31.640 --> 03:15:36.520]  and they went into education and what they have given us is the common core the programming about
[03:15:36.520 --> 03:15:41.640]  white privilege and what they're doing is they're using it to foster revolution in europe they came
[03:15:41.640 --> 03:15:45.880]  after classism okay different classes they looked at they said well you know america is pretty much
[03:15:45.880 --> 03:15:50.920]  a class of society but we can exploit this division uh between black and white and that's what they
[03:15:50.920 --> 03:15:55.320]  have done and they said that at the time they wrote books they wrote books they wrote books about it
[03:15:55.320 --> 03:16:01.320]  i mean i mean uh and now we're seeing it brought to fruition and he was in these institutions in
[03:16:01.320 --> 03:16:06.680]  chicago working with obama at the same time wrote letters and wrote books saying we can't get the
[03:16:06.680 --> 03:16:11.000]  blacks they've got their own communities their own areas we've got to buy off all their preachers
[03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:16.680]  teach them their liberal induct communism and then we've got to break up their families because
[03:16:16.680 --> 03:16:25.400]  these these things are weeds i just i'm so sick of it i'm telling you folks gibbering liberal
[03:16:25.400 --> 03:16:32.760]  professors nine times out of ten are the most hardcore anti-human people they hate black people
[03:16:32.760 --> 03:16:40.280]  with a passion that oh my god i'm so sick of trying to explain this i'm right period okay it's
[03:16:40.280 --> 03:16:46.040]  been proven it's an absolute fact but they pay people all this lip service how much they love you
[03:16:46.040 --> 03:16:51.880]  i will talk to everybody straight just like david will and i'm just gonna throw up i'm look look
[03:16:51.880 --> 03:16:56.040]  in africa the un will play one african tribe off against the other in europe they'll play
[03:16:56.600 --> 03:17:01.560]  catholic off against orthodox they will find the divisions and there's always some real beefs on
[03:17:01.560 --> 03:17:06.920]  both sides and play them off okay i won't take a few more calls i'm gonna skip the summer break so
[03:17:06.920 --> 03:17:13.000]  we have more time for calls and david but david we need to do a lot more we need to do a lot more
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:17.720]  with them hiring w ed to boys and hiring all the black preachers and her quotes we've got to really
[03:17:17.720 --> 03:17:23.000]  educate people because we've got people tuned in and listening but i tell you george soros the
[03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:29.240]  nazi collaborator didn't help create black lives matter and didn't it doesn't finance it because he
[03:17:29.240 --> 03:17:34.840]  cares about people tell folks what he set up in ukraine i mean the literal first president they
[03:17:34.840 --> 03:17:40.840]  put in walks around in black uniforms hiling hitler and he called these color revolutions and
[03:17:40.840 --> 03:17:46.040]  what he's trying to do here is have a revolution based on the color of skin okay all these revolutions
[03:17:46.040 --> 03:17:50.680]  that they funded throughout eastern europe they were based on different colors a kind of tribalism
[03:17:50.680 --> 03:17:56.280]  if you will but look this is a pattern that's been going on and our educational system has been taken
[03:17:56.280 --> 03:18:00.760]  over by the federal government that's what's wrong with it and now they're moving to take even more
[03:18:00.760 --> 03:18:05.160]  control over our law enforcement that's what's wrong with it and it's their training it's their
[03:18:05.160 --> 03:18:10.120]  armored vehicles they're so called all their this is all the global training yes this is what turned
[03:18:10.120 --> 03:18:15.800]  our police into this you know we're linked up on drudge report dot com a story uh with the uh
[03:18:16.600 --> 03:18:25.000]  migrants uh you know uh uh uh raping people uh all over and it is just a a true tragedy
[03:18:25.560 --> 03:18:29.240]  that this is happening and now we have the french police saying migrants sex assault
[03:18:29.240 --> 03:18:37.640]  could trigger civil war uh that's been their plan all along that's been their plan all along
[03:18:37.640 --> 03:18:45.240]  david and david again everywhere i go now there are suddenly refugees all over austin yes well
[03:18:45.240 --> 03:18:50.840]  then went to the to the park it was like a hundred plus men and the women had all sit over here and
[03:18:50.840 --> 03:18:54.680]  i go now and the women are like sitting up with doorstep of businesses on the ground and the
[03:18:54.680 --> 03:18:59.480]  husband goes in i mean it's like you tie your dog up or something i i just can't handle it man
[03:18:59.480 --> 03:19:02.840]  the left i gotta say because i've never been left or right i mean they call me a right guy because
[03:19:02.840 --> 03:19:09.000]  i'm for guns and stuff but the so-called left is just a very evil group of people i mean they really
[03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:14.200]  are and i'm now realizing it's a lot of even their low-level people know this they just want power
[03:19:14.200 --> 03:19:18.760]  david it's always been about dividing conquer alex and they can't get this done quickly enough
[03:19:18.760 --> 03:19:22.040]  with the people that they have here the divide and conquer so what they're doing is they're
[03:19:22.040 --> 03:19:27.000]  importing people who are going to come in and that and massive numbers okay and that's that's
[03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:31.240]  the problem with it we can't assimilate people we can't tell if the people who are coming in or even
[03:19:31.240 --> 03:19:37.400]  criminals or terrorists okay we can't tell it can't even screen them for diseases and so what
[03:19:37.400 --> 03:19:42.040]  they're doing is they're bringing this in very rapidly trying to alter the basis of society
[03:19:42.040 --> 03:19:46.040]  in order to create conflict because they're bringing the people in such numbers that they
[03:19:46.040 --> 03:19:50.280]  cannot be assimilated into a melting pot they don't want a melting pot anymore and they want
[03:19:50.280 --> 03:19:54.040]  to divide and conquer that's right and so that's why we've got the open borders it's part of the
[03:19:54.040 --> 03:19:59.320]  globalist move to try to take down the west because quite frankly there isn't any opposition to
[03:19:59.320 --> 03:20:05.000]  their neocolonialism nobody has to do it except the western nations every creature you can imagine
[03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:10.520]  everything's going total robot controlled the whole world's just falling to pure evil and despite all
[03:20:10.520 --> 03:20:15.320]  of our problems and decadence we have some of the culture and ideas that will block this this
[03:20:15.320 --> 03:20:20.280]  dehumanization and so we must be snuffed out the renaissance that ended slavery the renaissance
[03:20:20.280 --> 03:20:25.160]  that worldwide empowered women they've got to destroy it while they claim they own the mantle
[03:20:25.160 --> 03:20:30.200]  to it it's the most classic takeover program ever let's take a few calls here uh who's been
[03:20:30.200 --> 03:20:35.560]  holding the longest uh let's talk to tom in mash no no no blake's been holding longer than tom
[03:20:35.560 --> 03:20:41.400]  blake thanks for holding from texas you're only here alex um hey real quick i just wanted to
[03:20:41.400 --> 03:20:48.840]  respond to uh something ant farmer had said um i'm actually calling you from my cell phone
[03:20:48.840 --> 03:20:56.600]  and i've got a blue tube headset it's just a it's uh uh just stethoscope material uh instead of a
[03:20:56.600 --> 03:21:02.200]  cord and um completely blocks radiation and keeps it away uh as a matter of fact i don't think
[03:21:02.200 --> 03:21:06.120]  there's a patent on this so you could probably sell the daylight set of something like that if
[03:21:06.120 --> 03:21:09.800]  you ever uh decided to rather you ought to get the patent we'll license it for me and put it out
[03:21:09.800 --> 03:21:15.000]  that's what we want to we want to advance civilization and morals while funding our
[03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:20.280]  political ideas and that's what we're all about innovation so we ought to do it well it sounds
[03:21:20.280 --> 03:21:25.560]  fantastic yeah that's his job to either radiate himself or not radiate himself how is it my fault
[03:21:25.560 --> 03:21:33.160]  it was a very liberal argument yeah right right absolutely absolutely yeah it's your fault um
[03:21:33.160 --> 03:21:41.640]  um by the way too i put i put i'm a doctor i put a lot of uh my patients on dna force who
[03:21:41.640 --> 03:21:47.000]  have statin induced cardiomyopathy or pain all of their body and i've had great feedback i've
[03:21:47.000 --> 03:21:53.160]  i've just told them about info we're stored and um uh everyone goes on x2 also uh is great great
[03:21:53.160 --> 03:21:57.880]  feedback so anyway just wanted to get that out there before i got to my main point but um
[03:21:57.880 --> 03:22:03.880]  um wanted to say um what what do you think of of this idea because i know roger stone
[03:22:03.880 --> 03:22:08.760]  was uh trying to get together some speakers i don't know if he's already got everyone booked
[03:22:08.760 --> 03:22:16.600]  and i know even donald trump was um looking at uh getting some people uh since tom brady had
[03:22:16.600 --> 03:22:23.800]  canceled on him and mike did could cancel on him uh what about this is a wild idea but in light of
[03:22:23.800 --> 03:22:28.600]  the uh dallas shootings in a light of the way the media is trying to divide everyone and put the
[03:22:28.600 --> 03:22:34.920]  idea out that trump is racist trump is racist trump's racist what about lewis barricade having him
[03:22:34.920 --> 03:22:39.640]  speak on trump's behalf i don't know if he would do it uh i don't think he really endorsed trump i
[03:22:39.640 --> 03:22:43.880]  think he overall said trump's right that we can't just bring in when muslims are are infiltrating
[03:22:43.880 --> 03:22:47.160]  terrorists just not even vet them and then bring them in of course we got to check them and stop
[03:22:47.160 --> 03:22:50.200]  terrorist because that's going to be used to scapegoat all the muslims and in the end they're
[03:22:50.200 --> 03:22:55.640]  going to do that too you know it's it's they're bringing in the most primitive third world muslims
[03:22:55.640 --> 03:22:59.320]  who are full of jihadis and it's going to give all the other muslims a bad name i want to believe
[03:22:59.320 --> 03:23:05.800]  that islam you know isn't isn't you know radical in its orthodox areas but i haven't really followed
[03:23:05.800 --> 03:23:11.000]  the you know the whole roger stone thing i'm going to speak next week he asked me to we don't need
[03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:15.800]  you know quote names of people to speak at some rally for the first amendment in case i try to
[03:23:15.800 --> 03:23:23.880]  steal the uh trump deal uh the r and c i know really puts pressure on people not to be involved
[03:23:23.880 --> 03:23:28.840]  with anything trump period uh they're trying to block trump getting control of the r and c
[03:23:28.840 --> 03:23:34.680]  when he's nominated he doesn't get control of it until the last day so there's an internal war
[03:23:34.680 --> 03:23:39.320]  trying to shoot down trump shoot down his people tell other republicans and people don't go speak
[03:23:39.320 --> 03:23:43.800]  it to sing this is about the citizens diamonds and laces going to be there i'm speaking it's not
[03:23:43.800 --> 03:23:49.240]  even a ooh big deal a rally you know and then oh my gosh i speak to a crowd of you know 50 000 people
[03:23:49.240 --> 03:23:55.320]  or whatever 20 000 people whatever it is it's about being on the street with the soros people
[03:23:55.320 --> 03:23:59.880]  against them you know the black lives matter the rest of it forcing our first amendment videotaping
[03:23:59.880 --> 03:24:05.560]  the speeches putting it out into cyberspace and just being there for cleveland as a force to cover
[03:24:05.560 --> 03:24:11.240]  what's happening and to speak out uh if things are stolen but people always think one dimensional
[03:24:11.240 --> 03:24:16.200]  two dimensional about rallies rallies rallies rallies are so important no putting out news
[03:24:16.200 --> 03:24:20.920]  articles that millions of people read every day videos that millions watch every day being on radio
[03:24:20.920 --> 03:24:25.400]  that millions listen to and and and then coming to cleveland for the first amendment it's about the
[03:24:25.400 --> 03:24:31.480]  citizens coming it's about the citizens speaking out it's about citizens going uh to philadelphia
[03:24:31.480 --> 03:24:36.120]  and speaking out and and and pointing out what's going on and being part of the collapse of the
[03:24:36.120 --> 03:24:41.080]  dinosaur media but great points Blake um and i really appreciate your support and all the things
[03:24:41.080 --> 03:24:45.560]  you're doing thank you uh but yeah that that would be a very interesting idea just the media
[03:24:46.840 --> 03:24:51.560]  gave the the the lewis fair con interview that we did almost no attention still seen by millions
[03:24:51.560 --> 03:24:55.480]  of people because they don't have to deal with it they want division and they didn't know how to
[03:24:55.480 --> 03:25:01.320]  spin that one way or the other so that's why they didn't cover that uh going back to david night
[03:25:01.320 --> 03:25:06.280]  david your take on that yeah alex uh you know i don't know what donald trump is going to do at
[03:25:06.280 --> 03:25:09.960]  the convention my biggest concern is what he's going to do with the vice president i would very
[03:25:09.960 --> 03:25:13.480]  much like to see jeff sessions i don't really know anybody else that he would pick out the
[03:25:13.480 --> 03:25:17.240]  republican party that i would feel very good about because most of the people that are senior
[03:25:17.240 --> 03:25:22.680]  in the republican party are going to be pushing the kind of globalism and open borders and globalist
[03:25:22.680 --> 03:25:27.880]  trade deals that he seems to be at the core opposed to so unless he gets somebody from
[03:25:27.880 --> 03:25:33.560]  outside the political spectrum uh unless he gets somebody like jeff sessions who has integrity and
[03:25:33.560 --> 03:25:38.440]  who thinks the constitution actually means something and who's been a mentor for to him for the last
[03:25:38.440 --> 03:25:41.800]  eight months unless he does something like that i'm going to be very concerned about it sure what
[03:25:41.800 --> 03:25:47.000]  about michael flinn uh well again there's an outsider and i'm not really sure i don't i i know
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:51.640]  he's a you know retired general he said he was fired because he talked about islamic jihad and and
[03:25:51.640 --> 03:25:56.040]  they didn't want to use those terms uh that's a good point i just hope he doesn't see a jihadi
[03:25:56.040 --> 03:25:59.800]  well here's the word and this isn't from stone but i asked somebody said yeah that's spot on
[03:26:01.320 --> 03:26:07.080]  sessions is not we're not really at the top of the running anymore just because all you know
[03:26:07.880 --> 03:26:12.280]  if he ever spoke at one rally that somebody halfway sponsored you know hillary can you know get
[03:26:12.280 --> 03:26:16.600]  mentored by grand dragon and you know the democrat top guy could be a grand dragon or whatever but
[03:26:16.600 --> 03:26:20.680]  if you know sessions was ever connected to some you know nationalist group or anything which he
[03:26:20.680 --> 03:26:25.160]  wouldn't even part of they could really turn that into something i mean trump came and put out a
[03:26:25.160 --> 03:26:29.400]  star on something they claim it's anti-semitic right so that's one thought against sessions uh
[03:26:29.960 --> 03:26:32.920]  i've looked into his history i really don't see that but they'll try to spin that like they're
[03:26:32.920 --> 03:26:38.520]  ron paul uh you know claiming stuff in one of his newsletters uh but uh you know flinn flinn's
[03:26:38.520 --> 03:26:42.840]  right up there at the top of the list right now and of course there's this concern about gingrich as
[03:26:42.840 --> 03:26:45.880]  well but you know everything alec let me tell you he picks again rich i'm gonna have a big problem
[03:26:45.880 --> 03:26:50.360]  with trump yeah i mean hillary's so bad that i'll still be for trump but let me tell you i am gonna
[03:26:50.360 --> 03:26:54.680]  be really upset yeah you know one of the things that i've tried to do i've reached out to three
[03:26:54.680 --> 03:26:59.160]  different people who are trying to bring up this free the delegate idea okay we've got the guy who
[03:26:59.160 --> 03:27:04.520]  filed a lawsuit in virginia we've got the lady out in utah who has the organization i've tried to
[03:27:04.520 --> 03:27:09.960]  reach out to the people who wrote a book curly uh hoaglin and and he's got an op-ed piece out on
[03:27:10.600 --> 03:27:15.240]  the hill today i've reached out to all of them in the last week total silence crickets come on
[03:27:15.240 --> 03:27:20.840]  talk to me about it let's talk about what the real justice is in this system are you going to shut down
[03:27:20.840 --> 03:27:26.040]  the uh votes of millions of people because you say you have a conscience let's talk about what a
[03:27:26.040 --> 03:27:29.960]  delegate really means but they won't come on and talk about that that's where it's total spin where
[03:27:29.960 --> 03:27:35.560]  george will says we are the sovereigns members of the party we will decide not a mere plurality of
[03:27:35.560 --> 03:27:42.760]  mere voters i mean it was even mere we're royalty we're the sovereigns and you're mere i mean actually
[03:27:42.760 --> 03:27:47.400]  using the imperial words and people think that's arrogant but if you go back to most societies
[03:27:47.400 --> 03:27:52.120]  it was that arrogance that would con everybody to just stand down we as americans think of that royal
[03:27:52.120 --> 03:27:56.680]  arrogance as ridiculous but more and more we worship the royals because the tv told us to
[03:27:56.680 --> 03:28:00.840]  yeah uh a lot of these collars been holding a long time but david's got a guest coming up
[03:28:00.840 --> 03:28:05.480]  i apologize we may not be able to get to everybody kh uh khi says they disagree so i can give them

[03:28:54.760 --> 03:29:01.400]  but i think that um what i would like to call you out on is i think that some of your rhetoric on
[03:29:01.400 --> 03:29:09.480]  um race relations is further dividing what is already a dividing country um i will point out
[03:29:09.480 --> 03:29:12.680]  well let me just throw this out of you a bit and you can get your number we call you back tomorrow
[03:29:12.680 --> 03:29:17.480]  but david's about to take over he's got a guest i saw this quick call eating around the edges of
[03:29:17.480 --> 03:29:22.040]  being all kiss butt oh i'm sorry blacklist matter oh it's okay blah blah they're just as department
[03:29:22.040 --> 03:29:27.560]  run it needs to be totally exposed it's they're to hurt people it's a fraud it's not going to make
[03:29:27.560 --> 03:29:34.440]  the police reform themselves it'll make them worse that's my view go ahead but i would also
[03:29:34.440 --> 03:29:40.600]  say that not every muslim is an islamic terrorist and i think the picture that you paint in white
[03:29:40.600 --> 03:29:46.680]  americans minds is that every black person is somehow affiliated with black lives matter
[03:29:46.680 --> 03:29:50.360]  no that is not what i'm saying but i've i've i've i came across it's not what i intended

[03:29:59.880 --> 03:30:04.200]  the head of french police warned that the country is on the verge of a civil war triggered by another
[03:30:04.200 --> 03:30:08.120]  mass sexual assault of women by migrants like the one that occurred in cologne germany on new
[03:30:08.120 --> 03:30:13.080]  years eve as reported by paul joseph watson on info wars dot com the head of the director at general
[03:30:13.080 --> 03:30:17.720]  of internal security said the situation in france is so potentially explosive that one more major
[03:30:17.720 --> 03:30:22.840]  islamic terror attack or mass migrant sexual assault could lead to a massive public backlash he
[03:30:22.840 --> 03:30:27.400]  said quote i think it will take place even one or two attacks and it will happen it therefore
[03:30:27.400 --> 03:30:32.120]  behooves us to anticipate and block all these groups as we previously reported hundreds of
[03:30:32.120 --> 03:30:36.840]  german women were sexually abused during a series of attacks in cologne on december 31st the situation
[03:30:36.840 --> 03:30:41.720]  that eyewitnesses described as a war zone most of the culprits who were muslim migrants were never
[03:30:41.720 --> 03:30:45.880]  charged for the rapes additionally these muslim migrants from north africa and the middle east

[03:33:43.800 --> 03:33:48.360]  11 2016 i'm david and i'll be your host for the rest of the hour we have a very interesting
[03:33:48.360 --> 03:33:54.360]  guest i've read a lot of his work for a very long time erik peter so he has e p autos dot com
[03:33:54.360 --> 03:34:00.920]  he's an independent journalist and uh he writes about automobiles and mobility and liberty he
[03:34:00.920 --> 03:34:05.560]  does it from a libertarian perspective he's done this for 25 plus years as a columnist and author
[03:34:05.560 --> 03:34:10.440]  he's worked for uh places that you'll recognize like washington times all street journal chicago
[03:34:10.440 --> 03:34:17.400]  tribune many others he's got a couple of books uh automotive atrocities and road hogs uh his latest
[03:34:17.400 --> 03:34:23.000]  one is called doomed and i don't know if that's about the drivers because we're seeing the last
[03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:29.720]  couple of uh last couple of weeks there's been a rash of news about self-driving cars causing
[03:34:29.720 --> 03:34:35.320]  accidents one of them fatal and i would suggest that maybe we ought to stop calling them self-driving
[03:34:35.320 --> 03:34:39.960]  because i drive myself these are self-crashing cars i think that's the way we have to start
[03:34:39.960 --> 03:34:45.000]  referring to these things as so we want to talk to him about what's going on with tesla the cars
[03:34:45.000 --> 03:34:49.720]  today we've had a third one and i want to tell you about this one this was on the drudge report
[03:34:49.720 --> 03:34:55.480]  we've now had a third crash attributed to tesla's autopilot and again that's something that eric
[03:34:55.480 --> 03:35:01.960]  peters has talked about the fact that autopilot is really a misnomer really shouldn't call it that
[03:35:01.960 --> 03:35:08.440]  okay now these are beta tests if you do this in your tesla you have to acknowledge that you
[03:35:08.440 --> 03:35:13.480]  are participating in unproven software that you agree with that that you're going to take the risk
[03:35:13.480 --> 03:35:18.600]  to do that that you're going to follow their guidelines you know what i didn't sign a beta
[03:35:18.600 --> 03:35:22.840]  release to be on the road with somebody who is doing a science experiment with their car that's
[03:35:22.840 --> 03:35:29.240]  one of the things that i have a problem with and before we had this rash of uh self-driving
[03:35:29.240 --> 03:35:34.120]  autopilot cars with tesla and of course the third one just happened this last weekend this was in
[03:35:34.120 --> 03:35:40.040]  montana the guy was going along he says at about 55 to 60 miles an hour he said that he did not have
[03:35:40.040 --> 03:35:48.520]  a center line the car went off the road and hit the wood barriers on the side and essentially
[03:35:49.240 --> 03:35:54.120]  totaled his car looks like took off one side of the car they have survived in this but we see
[03:35:54.120 --> 03:35:59.640]  this over and over again even before we had the fatal accident that got so much attention and
[03:35:59.640 --> 03:36:04.760]  again it was a navy seal isn't it interesting that somebody who lived a dangerous life doing
[03:36:04.760 --> 03:36:12.040]  all kinds of risky things would be lulled to sleep like you know something like you know
[03:36:12.040 --> 03:36:18.840]  ulysses going on to the the rocks by the sirens home be lulled to sleep by this idea of this safe
[03:36:18.840 --> 03:36:24.840]  utopian technology so let's talk to eric peters now and get his take on this eric thank you for
[03:36:24.840 --> 03:36:31.160]  joining us it's interesting isn't it there's a juxtaposition between this notion that human
[03:36:31.160 --> 03:36:36.280]  drivers are fallible uh and we have to get them out of the equation but but somehow technology
[03:36:36.280 --> 03:36:43.320]  is infallible yeah i think all of us who've dealt with a pc uh know that technology is far from
[03:36:43.320 --> 03:36:48.200]  infallible that's right it's written by people right people who are writing the software they're
[03:36:48.200 --> 03:36:53.000]  okay but not the people who are behind the wheel well if you think about this you think about
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:36:58.360]  your computer that's that's in your home that's on your desk uh it's liable to getting software
[03:36:58.360 --> 03:37:03.160]  glitches and other problems and it's in a very safe controlled environment it's on your desk
[03:37:03.160 --> 03:37:08.280]  now the computers that control cars are in a moving vehicle that's being jostled around
[03:37:08.280 --> 03:37:13.240]  that's subject to extremes of heat and cold uh that's exposed to moisture and all of those other
[03:37:13.240 --> 03:37:19.000]  things and problems are going to happen and that's you got that on the left hand and then the other
[03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:23.720]  you've got this touted benefit of these self-driving or automatic driving cars that you can take your
[03:37:23.720 --> 03:37:30.680]  eyes off the road and your mind off driving and when the car then piles into a semi or an oak tree
[03:37:30.680 --> 03:37:33.960]  somehow it's your fault for not having paid attention to what's going on around you it's
[03:37:33.960 --> 03:37:38.520]  crazy yeah and that's what we're hearing from tesla now in the wake of these accidents basically
[03:37:38.520 --> 03:37:42.840]  it's not our fault they misused the technology we didn't make any mistakes and yet what they did
[03:37:42.840 --> 03:37:47.480]  was they lulled people into this fault since the security we've seen pictures of people going down
[03:37:47.480 --> 03:37:51.800]  the highway i think it was in california the guy totally asleep behind the wheel of a tesla
[03:37:51.800 --> 03:37:56.040]  people took video and put that up and says isn't this scary and it is very scary well it is very
[03:37:56.040 --> 03:38:01.400]  scary and i find it very interesting uh that on the one hand we are constantly lectured about uh
[03:38:01.400 --> 03:38:06.840]  the need to have ever escalating safety uh on a variety of things and yet here we have something
[03:38:06.840 --> 03:38:12.200]  that's demonstrably not just unsafe but arguably reckless and there's no human cry because in my
[03:38:12.200 --> 03:38:17.400]  opinion uh there's political pressure being applied to put these cars into circulation whereas you
[03:38:17.400 --> 03:38:21.640]  know of anything that involves us being able to control our cars that's a different matter
[03:38:21.640 --> 03:38:26.280]  and that's a key point you talk about that in your uh and you're uh posting along for the
[03:38:26.280 --> 03:38:31.800]  ride at epautos.com you talk about let's talk first about autopilot and why this really is a
[03:38:31.800 --> 03:38:36.680]  misnomer well it's not autopilot the car is not under your control but it's under the control
[03:38:36.680 --> 03:38:41.640]  of someone first and foremost it's under the control of the people who designed the software
[03:38:41.640 --> 03:38:46.920]  and put the parameters into the computer that controls everything and secondarily uh it's
[03:38:46.920 --> 03:38:52.600]  under the control potentially of someone else in real time um people out there may not realize it
[03:38:52.600 --> 03:38:59.000]  but uh every tesla that's out in circulation uh transmits constantly uh to tesla the company
[03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:03.720]  telemetry about your driving about where you're headed how fast you're going and so on all of
[03:39:03.720 --> 03:39:09.400]  these vehicles have that that capability and um GM's on-star system for example has that capability
[03:39:09.400 --> 03:39:14.760]  and they can control your car remotely and and i really worry that potentially that is the long
[03:39:14.760 --> 03:39:19.640]  term agenda with these things absolutely and they want to control not just your car but they want
[03:39:19.640 --> 03:39:23.640]  to control you you know when we talk about gun control we're talking about people control when
[03:39:23.640 --> 03:39:29.720]  we talk about some third party or the government controlling your movement that ought to make all
[03:39:29.720 --> 03:39:37.160]  of us uh just just you know why why would people accept that and yet we see that people really
[03:39:37.160 --> 03:39:41.640]  are happy and totally ready for this they took a poll in the new york as well as california said
[03:39:41.640 --> 03:39:46.920]  people are totally ready for autonomous cars this is the automotive establishment pushing
[03:39:46.920 --> 03:39:51.560]  this this one came from a road and track that headline said nine out of ten new yorkers 86
[03:39:51.560 --> 03:39:56.440]  percent of residents in california think that autonomous cars are a great idea and there is
[03:39:56.440 --> 03:40:01.720]  a picture i think of that guy who was asleep in this car for city people in new york and la but
[03:40:01.720 --> 03:40:06.360]  i think they've also been sold a bill of goods i think that they have been marketed a kind of
[03:40:06.360 --> 03:40:11.080]  jetson's view of this future where they'll be whisked along uh at great efficiency to wherever
[03:40:11.080 --> 03:40:16.840]  they want to go it's not going to be like that if you think about how traffic laws are right now
[03:40:16.840 --> 03:40:21.080]  and if you think about what government generally does when it controls mobility or controls our
[03:40:21.080 --> 03:40:26.840]  access to it it tends not to be speedy or efficient that's right and you made an excellent point i think
[03:40:26.840 --> 03:40:33.080]  when you were talking about autopilot and the difference between real autopilot in an airplane
[03:40:33.080 --> 03:40:38.600]  you mentioned the jetson view of the world when you're in an airplane as you pointed out autopilot
[03:40:38.600 --> 03:40:44.920]  you file your flight plan with them they keep all other planes a huge distance away from you not only
[03:40:45.560 --> 03:40:50.840]  front and back but uh altitude wise and that sort of thing so there's a tremendous spatial bubble
[03:40:50.840 --> 03:40:56.360]  but around you to correct for any error and yet you can't do cars that way cars are going to be
[03:40:56.360 --> 03:41:00.840]  in very close proximity in a real world environment and there's going to be a lot of unexpected
[03:41:00.840 --> 03:41:05.960]  things flying in there they freak out about the idea that they've got drones in the air around
[03:41:05.960 --> 03:41:10.600]  airports i mean that's the real the analogy would be is if you got you know a gazillion
[03:41:10.600 --> 03:41:14.120]  drones around the airport as their planes are trying to land that would be a true analogy to
[03:41:14.120 --> 03:41:18.280]  what's going to happen with their self-driving cars well sure but let's just for the sake of
[03:41:18.280 --> 03:41:22.680]  discussion say that it would be technologically feasible to do that would we want that yes um
[03:41:22.680 --> 03:41:27.320]  you know i write often about mobility and its relationship to freedom and that means our ability
[03:41:27.320 --> 03:41:32.520]  to just jump in our car and spur of the moment uh take a trip someplace without filing a flight
[03:41:32.520 --> 03:41:37.880]  plan um without getting permission beforehand um i think there is no way that this could be
[03:41:37.880 --> 03:41:43.080]  implemented technologically without uh requiring that everybody basically file a flight plan and
[03:41:43.080 --> 03:41:48.760]  with our movements being not only monitored but completely controlled at all times absolutely
[03:41:48.760 --> 03:41:52.760]  and we're going to see that just as we have seen the no fly list for example you can put you on a
[03:41:52.760 --> 03:41:58.920]  no fly list put you on a watch list and use that to apply punishments to you uh you're you don't
[03:41:58.920 --> 03:42:02.520]  know that you're on the list you don't know why you're on the list you're not allowed to confront
[03:42:02.520 --> 03:42:07.000]  your accusers in a public and speedy trial you're not allowed to call witnesses in your defense
[03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:11.320]  they just put you on that list of course they're going to do that with a car they're going to apply
[03:42:11.320 --> 03:42:15.560]  that kind of punishment to people and they're going to do it if they say that you owe them money
[03:42:15.560 --> 03:42:19.480]  for example you owe the IRS or you owe somebody else some money they will essentially put you
[03:42:19.480 --> 03:42:24.440]  under house arrest it'll be very easy when they control all transportation you pointed out that
[03:42:24.440 --> 03:42:29.240]  once you turn over that control you said for an automated car to be safe it's necessary it is
[03:42:29.240 --> 03:42:34.840]  mandatory that the caprice of human drivers be taken entirely out of the picture so get ready
[03:42:34.840 --> 03:42:41.400]  if you want to be safe turn over all control of your movement to the government forever forever
[03:42:41.400 --> 03:42:46.760]  it has to be that way it's an either or situation as these accidents approved either the driver uh
[03:42:46.760 --> 03:42:51.480]  the human driver is responsible for maintaining control of the vehicle and being aware of the
[03:42:51.480 --> 03:42:57.160]  driving environment and so on or he's not you can't have it in the middle absolutely let's talk
[03:42:57.160 --> 03:43:02.120]  a little bit about some of the crony capitalist aspects of this because as we see this being
[03:43:02.120 --> 03:43:10.120]  investigated we've already seen some charges questions brought up about tesla's uh uh s models
[03:43:10.120 --> 03:43:15.960]  and their suspension problems and we learned uh just the last couple of days that to fix these
[03:43:15.960 --> 03:43:21.480]  problems they were demanding that the owners first sign a nondisclosure agreement that they
[03:43:21.480 --> 03:43:25.720]  not talk about the fact that they're having a problem with this car that is totally unprecedented
[03:43:25.720 --> 03:43:30.360]  in the automotive industry to my knowledge yeah i've never heard of anything like that happening
[03:43:30.360 --> 03:43:35.800]  and um more significantly uh and more interestingly i think uh the government apparently isn't too
[03:43:35.800 --> 03:43:42.520]  interested in that yes yes because meanwhile they're crucifying volkswagen overly fractional
[03:43:42.520 --> 03:43:47.400]  difference oh yeah tailpipe emissions for their diesel vehicles absolutely yeah you had another
[03:43:47.400 --> 03:43:53.160]  interesting comment comment on that it was uh called bank run talking about how they're trying
[03:43:53.160 --> 03:43:58.600]  to put volkswagen out of business and now we've had the state of california jump in with 86 million
[03:43:58.600 --> 03:44:03.720]  dollars which is like a petty change compared to what the federal government is trying to do to
[03:44:03.720 --> 03:44:09.480]  volkswagen uh talk about that briefly well um this who is unprecedented i think the total
[03:44:09.480 --> 03:44:14.200]  liability the number that's being bandied around now is something on the order of 80 billion billion
[03:44:14.200 --> 03:44:19.560]  not million dollars total um uh that will be involved here not just in terms of the the
[03:44:19.560 --> 03:44:24.600]  government's uh fines but also potential litigation from class action lawsuits
[03:44:24.600 --> 03:44:30.040]  and again to put that into some kind of perspective um you might recall the uh the firestone explorer
[03:44:30.040 --> 03:44:36.120]  rollover fiasco that happened back in the 90s that's right um that cost forward about 24 million
[03:44:36.120 --> 03:44:44.680]  dollars excuse me that cost 42.4 billion and the prior exploding pinto fiasco of the 70s
[03:44:44.680 --> 03:44:49.640]  in which there actually were real victims actually people who were hurt uh that cost the equivalent
[03:44:49.640 --> 03:44:55.720]  in today's money of about 24 million dollars wow and nobody to date has produced a single actual
[03:44:55.720 --> 03:45:01.800]  flesh and blood victim somebody who can you know who can say hey i was harmed by uh the fractionally
[03:45:01.800 --> 03:45:06.840]  increased emissions of these of these volkswagen cars which by the way would have been fully
[03:45:06.840 --> 03:45:11.880]  compliant with all the federal mandates that were in effect for say circa 2005 model year cars and
[03:45:11.880 --> 03:45:15.720]  nobody's claiming that those cars hurt anybody either well here's another one for you eric one
[03:45:15.720 --> 03:45:22.200]  of the first uh stories that i covered when i came here to info wars was the epa hooking people up to
[03:45:22.200 --> 03:45:27.800]  diesel tailpipes university of north carolina to try to show that they needed to have more stringent
[03:45:27.800 --> 03:45:33.080]  regulations on diesel fumes on fine particulate matter and so what they did was they first they
[03:45:33.080 --> 03:45:38.520]  went to congress and uh the time they had the epa was lisa jackson and she did a little dog
[03:45:38.520 --> 03:45:44.680]  and pony show that was pre-arranged with uh then congressman marquis from massachusetts and uh he was
[03:45:44.680 --> 03:45:49.000]  actually leading her with questions and actually read some of her lines as how you know it was
[03:45:49.000 --> 03:45:52.680]  all coordinated ahead of time and basically said you're not talking about people getting
[03:45:52.680 --> 03:45:57.720]  sicker you're talking about people actually dying from this she said oh yes yes they will die
[03:45:57.720 --> 03:46:02.680]  from fine particulate matter and and very quickly and and it's more people dying from that than
[03:46:02.680 --> 03:46:08.280]  are dying from cancer and then they took their own levels and they gate they exposed people to 72
[03:46:08.280 --> 03:46:14.680]  times their maximum level and they pre-screened to try to find people had respiratory and heart
[03:46:14.680 --> 03:46:18.920]  issues so they could create an event and and now we've got the same people coming out and saying
[03:46:18.920 --> 03:46:23.880]  we're going to shut down Volkswagen uh because they disobeyed our laws and that's really the
[03:46:23.880 --> 03:46:28.120]  issue isn't it they disobeyed their laws they disobeyed their laws i mean it's the equivalent
[03:46:28.120 --> 03:46:33.400]  uh this cheating and i put it near quotes uh of the emissions test is analogous to uh you or i
[03:46:33.400 --> 03:46:39.400]  having a radar detector in our car to avoid the speed traps uh most people don't realize it and i
[03:46:39.400 --> 03:46:43.160]  wish that volkswagen had done a better job of explaining it in fact i wish the industry generally
[03:46:43.160 --> 03:46:49.240]  had done this but uh all the low hanging fruit has already been picked uh the tailpipe exhaust
[03:46:49.240 --> 03:46:53.800]  emissions of any recent vintage car whether it's a gas engine car or a diesel engine car are
[03:46:53.800 --> 03:46:59.960]  effectively nil uh 95 percent of what comes out of the tailpipe of a modern car is carbon dioxide
[03:46:59.960 --> 03:47:04.520]  and water vapor both of which are inert gases that have nothing to do whatsoever with asthma
[03:47:04.520 --> 03:47:09.080]  or air quality issues um but they don't want to talk about that because then EPA would no longer
[03:47:09.080 --> 03:47:14.440]  have a reason to exist yeah yeah well when we look at this we can also you know we can see the
[03:47:15.080 --> 03:47:19.080]  what many people call the regulatory captures you pointed out the national highway traffic
[03:47:19.080 --> 03:47:23.240]  safety administration doesn't really want to see anything wrong with these self-driving cars because
[03:47:23.240 --> 03:47:28.200]  it fits so well with the government's agenda you know and i look at the automotive regular
[03:47:28.200 --> 03:47:32.360]  mainstream automotive press you know like car and driver pushing this stuff and i'm wondering
[03:47:32.360 --> 03:47:35.880]  who are they going to be selling magazines to are they going to have like a bus and rider
[03:47:35.880 --> 03:47:39.800]  magazine in the future you know i wonder what happened to those guys you know when i was a
[03:47:39.800 --> 03:47:44.840]  kid i grew up reading guys like rock gates so you probably know about you know guys who not only
[03:47:44.840 --> 03:47:49.480]  loved cars and loved mobility but were car guys and who understood mechanical things and engineering
[03:47:49.480 --> 03:47:54.120]  things yeah and the people that they've got covering the industry today are nothing like that you
[03:47:54.120 --> 03:47:59.560]  know except for myself a couple of other people who are who have kind of become outliers off the
[03:47:59.560 --> 03:48:05.480]  reservation yeah i remember the uh the motto we had kajito ergo zoom i wish that would fit on a
[03:48:05.480 --> 03:48:10.760]  license plate let's talk about the regulatory capture though with with tesla because one of
[03:48:10.760 --> 03:48:16.200]  the things i was really surprised when i went back and looked at this was the timeline this fatal
[03:48:16.200 --> 03:48:20.760]  accident that we just recently had of the guy who now they're saying no we don't think he even had
[03:48:20.760 --> 03:48:27.240]  autopilot on after this has been going for about 10 days this happened back on may 4th and it was
[03:48:27.240 --> 03:48:33.960]  54 days before the national highway traffic safety administration publicly disclosed those
[03:48:33.960 --> 03:48:41.480]  details in the meantime you had massive stock movements to the favor of tesli had goldman sacks
[03:48:41.480 --> 03:48:47.800]  upgrading them to a buy you had tesla buying back at stock and making a 1.5 billion dollars
[03:48:49.160 --> 03:48:56.840]  profit after they cash that in so that they could then move on and try to take over solar city which
[03:48:56.840 --> 03:49:02.680]  is about 2.8 billion dollars so you've got all these moves that are happening they know about it
[03:49:02.680 --> 03:49:08.760]  the nth sa knows about it but the public doesn't know about it in that time i think that's pretty
[03:49:08.760 --> 03:49:13.640]  telling well it is and it's the media's fault uh for not publicizing that and and it's an open
[03:49:13.640 --> 03:49:17.960]  question as to why they don't uh it seems that they take its face value everything every every
[03:49:17.960 --> 03:49:23.480]  pronouncement that musk makes uh is not examined critically and it's simply transmitted to the
[03:49:23.480 --> 03:49:29.960]  public uh whether by friends or other forms of media it's ridiculous you know the company musk
[03:49:29.960 --> 03:49:36.520]  does not sell cars he sells carbon credits which is an elaborate flap doodle um it's a it's a means
[03:49:36.520 --> 03:49:41.560]  by which to mulk the major car companies that do sell functionally viable and economically
[03:49:41.560 --> 03:49:46.040]  practical vehicles uh in states like california and some other states there are requirements
[03:49:46.040 --> 03:49:51.720]  that every automaker that does business in the state sell a certain percentage of so-called
[03:49:51.720 --> 03:49:57.480]  zero emissions cars well since only electric cars qualify for that if you as a car company do not
[03:49:57.480 --> 03:50:02.120]  sell electric cars or do not sell a certain number of electric cars then you got to buy the carbon
[03:50:02.120 --> 03:50:06.360]  credit from somebody like no on muck that's how the guy makes his money exactly even though his
[03:50:06.360 --> 03:50:10.840]  cars are incredibly expensive and even though he just had a press conference not too long ago
[03:50:10.840 --> 03:50:15.320]  where he said yeah their first generation of cars uh the tesla roadster was total garbage
[03:50:15.320 --> 03:50:21.480]  and unsafe that was his characterization of it to me it's it's literally lunatic asylum crazy you
[03:50:21.480 --> 03:50:26.280]  know they they uh they tout these cars uh for their performance and their advanced technology
[03:50:26.280 --> 03:50:30.520]  and their sexiness well you could say the same thing about a Porsche or a Lamborghini so why
[03:50:30.520 --> 03:50:34.920]  aren't we paying people to buy Porsches is it not the same thing yeah yeah well it's all about
[03:50:34.920 --> 03:50:41.000]  control and the government is allied with them uh tooth and nail because they have always wanted
[03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:45.160]  to have control of our transportation and it's not just the government and these car companies
[03:50:45.160 --> 03:50:59.000]  of course it's also uber stay with us we'll be right back with eric peters

[03:54:11.400 --> 03:54:15.560]  welcome back to the alex joneshow on david night and we're talking to eric peters of
[03:54:15.560 --> 03:54:23.400]  ep autos dot com about the future of transportation the future of freedom quite frankly because if
[03:54:23.400 --> 03:54:28.920]  you don't have control over your movement okay you're essentially locked up you're under house
[03:54:28.920 --> 03:54:33.320]  arrest and that's what we're moving towards we've always had the government want to control our
[03:54:33.320 --> 03:54:39.880]  transportation and now they have the perfect vehicle if you will for it the so-called self-driving car
[03:54:39.880 --> 03:54:46.200]  we've been talking to eric about the recent spate of tesla crashes but even before these last three
[03:54:46.200 --> 03:54:51.960]  crashes that have been blamed on autopilot the one where the former navy seal was killed as
[03:54:51.960 --> 03:54:59.720]  his car passed under a semi trailer 18 wheel truck from the side we also had before that
[03:55:00.840 --> 03:55:07.000]  we had multiple cases where people reporting that autopilot not only did not do collision
[03:55:07.000 --> 03:55:13.400]  avoidance but it sped up as it saw the situation developing and so we have a different approach
[03:55:13.400 --> 03:55:18.840]  that's being taken by tesla to put people out there in a beta test putting them out there on
[03:55:18.840 --> 03:55:24.840]  the road and they have complete protection from the federal government and its regulatory agencies
[03:55:24.840 --> 03:55:29.720]  they're trying to override any concerns at the state level about the safety of these systems
[03:55:30.440 --> 03:55:35.160]  a different approach is being taken by google who say they want to take complete control of your car
[03:55:35.160 --> 03:55:39.720]  no steering wheel no brakes that that's the only safe way to do that and of course that's what
[03:55:39.720 --> 03:55:43.080]  they're eventually going to do because that's what the government wants to do before we go back to
[03:55:43.080 --> 03:55:48.520]  eric real quickly i want to let you know that we have our independence day mega sale ends tonight

[03:56:50.440 --> 03:56:54.920]  there's a common thread that i see all the time as the government wants to take control of our
[03:56:54.920 --> 03:57:01.000]  lives they always promise us that we'll be safer if we just give up our freedom sure let's talk
[03:57:01.000 --> 03:57:06.840]  about that a little bit and let's talk about the the false trade-off uh in light of airbags let's
[03:57:06.840 --> 03:57:13.000]  let's a good example of how the promise of safety is truly a lie well it's interesting you'll hear
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:18.760]  the the phrase used if it saves even one life then it's worth doing um recently well guys within
[03:57:18.760 --> 03:57:24.280]  the last two years uh the feds mandated backup cameras in all new cars because there were a
[03:57:24.280 --> 03:57:29.560]  handful literally a handful of incidents where somebody uh didn't look before they backed up
[03:57:29.560 --> 03:57:36.520]  and they ran over a kid um well okay that's that's you know well and good now we've got airbags
[03:57:36.520 --> 03:57:40.760]  which have killed people these are mandated devices that were forced to have in our cars
[03:57:40.760 --> 03:57:45.480]  there are millions of cars literally millions of cars out there with these defective claymore
[03:57:45.480 --> 03:57:50.760]  mines in the dashboard that can kill you yes the current death toll i think 13 people have been killed
[03:57:50.760 --> 03:57:55.720]  um many more have been severely uh wounded by these things and they literally skew shrapnel
[03:57:55.720 --> 03:58:00.600]  you know people hear the term airbag and they uh they tend to think oh it's uh it's a pillowy soft
[03:58:00.600 --> 03:58:04.760]  thing that keeps your face you know from being hurt by the steering wheel on the crash well in
[03:58:04.760 --> 03:58:10.360]  order for it to work it has to it has to explode out of the dash great force they're very violent
[03:58:10.360 --> 03:58:15.720]  and the engineers made this clear uh to nitsa back in the 70s when this that was first being
[03:58:15.720 --> 03:58:20.120]  proposed and they were deliberately ignored yeah first generation airbags proved to be very
[03:58:20.120 --> 03:58:24.520]  unsafe second generation airbags were better but they're more complicated we're out of time
[03:58:26.680 --> 03:58:30.680]  we're out of time eric sorry yeah the bottom line is they won't even let us turn off even
[03:58:30.680 --> 03:58:35.640]  when they know they're defective until they can get it fixed that's the lie that they keep selling us
[03:58:35.640 --> 03:58:40.840]  thank you so much eric petersepautos.com join us tonight and for war's nightly news seven central
