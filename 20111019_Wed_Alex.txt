[01:24.240 --> 01:30.520]  the FDIC which would force the FDIC to protect those derivative investments
[01:30.520 --> 01:34.840]  should the bank fail also exposing them to the Fed discount window and
[01:34.840 --> 01:41.280]  apparently JP Morgan has also got about 79 trillion with the T of derivatives

[01:51.160 --> 01:56.160]  reporting on how William Crystal and other neocons who helped bring about the
[01:56.160 --> 02:03.200]  Iraq war in 2003 are pressuring Obama to strike Iran after the phony fake plot to
[02:03.200 --> 02:07.600]  allegedly assassinate the Saudi ambassador we've also got a clip coming up
[02:07.600 --> 02:11.320]  later of Ron Paul talking about how there's no good evidence for that plot
[02:11.320 --> 02:15.840]  despite the fact that so many have begun beating the drums of war against Iran
[02:15.840 --> 02:20.720]  we also have Curt Nimo with private security allegedly hired to clear
[02:20.720 --> 02:27.520]  Occupy Wall Street from Zoukati Park despite the First Amendment they are
[02:27.520 --> 02:30.920]  being pressured out according to an email sent to info wars.com Brookfield
[02:30.920 --> 02:35.200]  Properties recently posted an ad on New York Craigslist calling for able-bodied
[02:35.200 --> 02:39.200]  men to evict the Occupy Wall Street demonstrators from Zoukati Park on
[02:39.200 --> 02:43.160]  Friday. Brookfield Properties is the company that owns Zoukati Park where

[03:02.200 --> 03:09.240]  admittedly behind the Stuxnet worm that attacked Iran rather and now experts
[03:09.240 --> 03:13.080]  suspect the Dooku worm is from the same source that targeted Iran's nuclear
[03:13.080 --> 03:19.200]  facilities widely said to have been US and Israel. We also have the judge who
[03:19.200 --> 03:24.200]  ruled that no food rights exist that you do not have an inherent right to produce

[03:55.960 --> 04:00.920]  serving under the law is said to be classified and the request to reveal the
[04:00.920 --> 04:05.040]  interpretation being used to kill American citizens overseas and all the
[04:05.040 --> 04:13.400]  rest of it will not be revealed despite lawsuits the family of Alaki son hits
[04:13.400 --> 04:18.760]  out at the US in fury over the fate of that of the son the teenager killed in

[08:49.640 --> 08:54.640]  gonna have a lot of key analysis coming up with Paul Watson in about 25 minutes
[08:54.640 --> 09:00.400]  from prison planet breaking down the fact that known Marxist groups funded by
[09:00.400 --> 09:04.000]  the British and US government are trying to implement the Cass Sunstein program
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.280]  to brainwash kids and teach them to not trust any alternative media the system
[09:09.280 --> 09:14.920]  is just absolutely panicking right now Alan Watt I can't wait that today as I'm
[09:14.920 --> 09:20.320]  driving home to hear his analysis on Occupy Wall Street and this global move
[09:20.320 --> 09:25.840]  for the elite to trigger revolutions so they can artificially steer them before
[09:25.840 --> 09:30.520]  the real revolutions kick off on their own followed up timing that's what the
[09:30.520 --> 09:34.320]  globalists are doing this right now of course Webster Griffin Tarpley on the
[09:34.320 --> 09:42.680]  african huge invasion of Africa Chad Ivory Coast Uganda all of it coming up
[09:42.680 --> 09:46.480]  you can also get a take on Iran Occupy Wall Street you name it so a jam-packed
[09:46.480 --> 09:51.120]  transmission definitely today and I tell you I'm chomping at the bit the crew
[09:51.120 --> 09:56.880]  knows I almost just decided to Skype in from the road as I drive down the road
[09:56.880 --> 10:03.240]  with the family but I decided not do that because you're there in the cockpit
[10:03.240 --> 10:07.880]  and you've got all these great informative minds joining the transmission
[10:07.880 --> 10:15.520]  today but most important is that we go with our research we go with our gut we
[10:15.520 --> 10:20.360]  go with the facts I should have five six weeks ago in Occupy Wall Street was
[10:20.360 --> 10:25.520]  being announced by the George Soros groups come out against the bed instead I
[10:25.520 --> 10:27.960]  knew that it would be a lot of grassroots people that were going to show
[10:27.960 --> 10:31.960]  off the globalists put off the call they know there's angry people a diverse
[10:31.960 --> 10:36.200]  group of in the fetters liberals people who can't get jobs we've got multiple
[10:36.200 --> 10:42.120]  degrees you know smorgasbord anti-war people they all show up and that's just
[10:42.120 --> 10:48.800]  used as a set background like a like a Western painting by John Wayne I can
[10:48.800 --> 10:53.560]  stagecoach shot on the soundstage just say look you'll hear the people here's
[10:53.560 --> 10:57.600]  what they want then the system can selectively talk to the people they
[10:57.600 --> 11:03.040]  want to to create the perception that redistribute or else capitalism went
[11:03.040 --> 11:06.760]  wrong we want all these new taxes which will really just be used to pay
[11:06.760 --> 11:10.960]  austerity to the central banks we told you these scams are coming so this is
[11:10.960 --> 11:14.200]  about the establishment knowing we're really in a depression that they've
[11:14.200 --> 11:20.440]  engineered and then trying to trigger the revolution before it organically
[11:20.440 --> 11:24.800]  developed and to try to really kind of take over the end of that movement that
[11:24.800 --> 11:28.360]  of course has been going on now for decades but under that name for four
[11:28.360 --> 11:32.920]  years now we get to be lectured by the occupied Wall Street people and all the
[11:32.920 --> 11:38.480]  big tides foundation blogs are attacking myself Ron Paul and others right now the
[11:38.480 --> 11:44.120]  service your employees the corporation international what SCI you they've I've
[11:44.120 --> 11:48.560]  now noticed they're having big groups right at pieces on myself and others
[11:48.560 --> 11:52.960]  really you know calling us criminals calling us racist calling us trash but
[11:52.960 --> 11:58.280]  they are desperate about the floodgates and Colin tell pro in disinformation in
[11:58.280 --> 12:03.040]  attacks on websites and blogs and YouTube all of our listeners are noticing
[12:03.040 --> 12:06.600]  it and have become very sophisticated and notice that as soon as I threw the
[12:06.600 --> 12:10.600]  gauntlet down against the fellow reserve I tried to shift the activist groups
[12:10.600 --> 12:14.400]  on to the actual power structure that created this economic collapse you know
[12:14.400 --> 12:18.000]  the true criminal one percent who are waiting for organs with left the middle
[12:18.000 --> 12:24.280]  class in the working class the gates of Haiti have been released against us that
[12:24.280 --> 12:28.720]  doesn't scare me that lets me know we're getting directly at the heart of the
[12:28.720 --> 12:33.920]  system the good news is they've not been able to co-opt the entire ox by Wall
[12:33.920 --> 12:39.600]  Street movement and instead a lot of their union type people and others are
[12:39.600 --> 12:42.800]  actually waking up I'm not against unions I'm against how they've been taken
[12:42.800 --> 12:47.280]  over by globalist and don't oppose NAFTA and gas and then promote gun control and
[12:47.280 --> 12:53.240]  police aid and open borders everything destroying American workers jobs so they
[12:53.240 --> 12:56.080]  want to play us off against each other but just as the Republicans were
[12:56.080 --> 13:01.200]  unable to co-opt the Tea Party entirely you now see Rick Perry and all them with
[13:01.200 --> 13:08.000]  Tea Party talking points we're actually co-opting them a true populism in the
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.600]  vein of Thomas Jefferson is here upon us but there is no doubt the elites
[13:12.600 --> 13:17.320]  making their move worldwide through fake color revolution run by the State
[13:17.320 --> 13:20.880]  Department and Watson's got that news coming up I know you have it in front
[13:20.880 --> 13:24.720]  of you there Aaron you can give folks the headline in a moment but we already knew
[13:24.720 --> 13:28.600]  this this came out a month ago and then it's now been confirmed the State
[13:28.600 --> 13:34.840]  Department the CIA think tanks they use are on the ground all over the country
[13:34.840 --> 13:38.320]  including Austin these are the people that come up and say don't have a wrong
[13:38.320 --> 13:42.800]  poll sign don't talk about the color reserve but then they allow the union
[13:42.800 --> 13:46.360]  stuff and the calls for redistribution of wealth to be there they want to claim
[13:46.360 --> 13:49.440]  they don't have an agenda except redistribute wealth but then that's
[13:49.440 --> 13:53.440]  actually so they can quietly organize and try to take control the globalists
[13:53.440 --> 13:59.560]  have prematurely launched the revolution in this country to try to hijack it
[13:59.560 --> 14:04.200]  into a Marxist redistribution vein directed by the mega bankers George
[14:04.200 --> 14:08.720]  Soros and of course Warren Buffett and others who are Rockefeller Rothschild
[14:08.720 --> 14:13.080]  agents now publicly captaining it and you've got the State Department operatives
[14:13.080 --> 14:17.880]  who were literally behind the overthrow in Egypt which made it ten times worse
[14:17.880 --> 14:22.480]  total banning of free speech killing of women picking women out of college just
[14:22.480 --> 14:27.880]  just stoning and again Mubarak was a dictator but he actually tried to build
[14:27.880 --> 14:33.120]  his people up a little bit he was a US backed dictator but that said he's gone
[14:33.120 --> 14:37.400]  and now it's total evil this is the model all over the world all over Africa
[14:37.400 --> 14:42.000]  everywhere now with invasion forces going in and either attacking rebels
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.120]  trying to overthrow Western puppets or having rebels triggered to overthrow
[14:46.120 --> 14:53.600]  people that and regimes that don't go along with their operation so that's
[14:53.600 --> 14:57.400]  basically it Aaron I'm gonna let you get into the news and the headlines but
[14:57.400 --> 15:01.200]  this is so incredibly important the globalists are launching their global
[15:01.200 --> 15:07.080]  takeover their next phase we're gonna know by next week the exact details of
[15:07.080 --> 15:10.400]  this new euro superstate run by private banks where the countries have no
[15:10.400 --> 15:14.920]  sovereignty can say I can't say no to the new taxes our regulations we are
[15:14.920 --> 15:19.440]  seeing history being made the globalist are moving in Africa Asia Latin America
[15:19.440 --> 15:23.800]  they're moving in the total takeover of Europe and the last shreds of sovereignty
[15:23.800 --> 15:28.160]  and citizens chance to get out of it a literal economic dictatorship we're
[15:28.160 --> 15:32.480]  watching the control design depression launch here in this republic and they're
[15:32.480 --> 15:36.840]  trying to divert people that engineered this are now trying to trigger the people
[15:36.840 --> 15:40.880]  and divide the Congress play us off against each other so that's basically
[15:40.880 --> 15:45.080]  it gets on and you're just gonna get crazy here from here on out we are
[15:45.080 --> 15:50.120]  literally seeing history unfold right now Aaron this is so amazing I know
[15:50.120 --> 15:52.680]  you're about to get into that State Department story we've got to get this
[15:52.680 --> 15:56.360]  out to everyone people are so confused they go the corrupt elements of Wall
[15:56.360 --> 16:00.000]  Street the big six mega banks the brokerage firms funded Obama he went
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.440]  along with all the stuff Bush did Bush followed the Clinton stuff with the
[16:03.440 --> 16:07.360]  architect of this Alan Greenspan the derivatives the bubble they did all this
[16:07.360 --> 16:11.880]  how can he say he's with Occupy Wall Street because they're with the element
[16:11.880 --> 16:15.320]  of Occupy Wall Street that wants to jack up taxes on the middle class and
[16:15.320 --> 16:19.120]  transfer it to the bank's good this is how the mega wealth was developed was
[16:19.120 --> 16:23.240]  what government public partnerships with these private entities the UN a
[16:23.240 --> 16:28.400]  Jenna 21 model it's on Mayday Mayday Mayday but the good news is we're not
[16:28.400 --> 16:32.280]  just rolling over we understood the enemy attack profile decades ago and
[16:32.280 --> 16:35.840]  warned people about the globalist paradigm we planted so many seats that
[16:35.840 --> 16:39.280]  now that we're right here at the edge of this situation we've got a chance to
[16:39.280 --> 16:42.800]  defeat these people because the polar of ears of the Liberty Movement who've been
[16:42.800 --> 16:46.920]  demonized and attacked all along have been proven absolutely correct so now
[16:46.920 --> 16:50.760]  we've got a chance to beat these people because they miscalculated and didn't
[16:50.760 --> 16:54.000]  understand that we were going to continue to work to expose them decades
[16:54.000 --> 16:58.280]  before they launched this operation so they have they have miscalculated we are
[16:58.280 --> 17:02.640]  in the fight we've got a chance to win but we have 110% output against these
[17:02.640 --> 17:07.040]  cards by everybody right now erin dice yeah and just for a background you were
[17:07.040 --> 17:10.680]  talking about the Egypt revolution isn't it convenient how the heavy press
[17:10.680 --> 17:15.480]  coverage dropped off after the celebratory victory of the spontaneous
[17:15.480 --> 17:19.920]  revolution now you've got the military who to refusing to give over power
[17:19.920 --> 17:24.080]  putting off elections making excuses in the news right now in the London
[17:24.080 --> 17:28.160]  Guardian jailed Egyptian blogger on hunger strike says he's ready to die
[17:28.160 --> 17:34.760]  declares he would rather commit suicide than be tried before this kangaroo court
[17:34.760 --> 17:40.120]  in front of the military junta just for criticizing them in a blog but of course
[17:40.120 --> 17:45.080]  we have the State Department agitator who we now know is advising the Occupy
[17:45.080 --> 17:51.400]  Wall Street movement there's Ahmed Maher Maher helped lead Egypt's Arab Spring
[17:51.400 --> 17:55.800]  that resulted in military dictatorship Paul Joseph Watson a US government backed
[17:55.800 --> 18:00.840]  pioneer of the so-called Arab Spring in Egypt eventually resulted in a military
[18:00.840 --> 18:05.680]  dictatorship is now advising the Occupy Wall Street protesters and another
[18:05.680 --> 18:21.760]  sign the movement's been subverted most revolutions go bad you get a
[18:21.760 --> 18:25.280]  French Revolution on American Revolution that's what the globalist one
[18:25.280 --> 18:29.800]  they want to launch it themselves try to steer and use the old horror media
[18:29.800 --> 18:34.320]  establish the media to get this done this is life and death situation to
[18:34.320 --> 18:37.560]  expose these people get back to what you're covering God bless you all we
[18:37.560 --> 18:41.040]  will defeat this globalist new world order again to turn America into a
[18:41.040 --> 18:47.240]  communist state God bless you all there goes Alex Jones thanks Alex and we're
[18:47.240 --> 18:51.240]  gonna have Paul Joseph Watson with more on this article in a moment but yeah of
[18:51.240 --> 18:55.600]  course the energy is gonna be there the question is what kind of chemistry is
[18:55.600 --> 18:59.760]  gonna result from it what catalysts will be put forward to transform that
[18:59.760 --> 19:04.600]  energy into the various solutions that are out there the globalists have been
[19:04.600 --> 19:09.920]  masters for decades and decades it's steering energy outside of the left
[19:09.920 --> 19:15.120]  right paradigm back into the left right paradigm that's largely what did happen
[19:15.120 --> 19:19.640]  with the Tea Party and hopefully it will not now happen with the Occupy Wall
[19:19.640 --> 19:24.400]  Street movement we know from on the ground reports that many of the Occupy
[19:24.400 --> 19:29.120]  Wall Street protesters have nothing to do with the establishment but at the
[19:29.120 --> 19:32.880]  same time the signs are all there that they're being absorbed and here they are
[19:32.880 --> 19:37.720]  being steered by a State Department backed agitator asset who was part of
[19:37.720 --> 19:42.240]  the Egypt Revolution the Arab Spring of course we will get more into that on the
[19:42.240 --> 19:47.080]  other side and lots of this economic news EU bank failures posing on another

[24:24.040 --> 24:28.640]  segment we have Paul Joseph Watson more foreign policy analysis coming up
[24:28.640 --> 24:33.600]  later with Webster Tarpoli and Alan Watt but as they are beating the drums
[24:33.600 --> 24:38.480]  for war with Iran of course they've been provoking for a long time but it's on
[24:38.480 --> 24:44.160]  the burner again we have a clip from Ron Paul where he talks to Wolf Blitzer on
[24:44.160 --> 24:47.960]  CNN I don't know if we have that ready but if we could get it ready he talks
[24:47.960 --> 24:50.680]  about how there's really been no evidence proven of this alleged
[24:50.680 --> 24:55.800]  assassination plot we don't have the clip well hopefully we can come back to
[24:55.800 --> 24:59.680]  that later but he essentially points out that you know it's good the guys in
[24:59.680 --> 25:03.160]  custody and he should see a trial but would even see a trial with such a
[25:03.160 --> 25:07.120]  provocated hoax we've had on the intelligence officials who pointed out
[25:07.120 --> 25:12.680]  there's nothing in the justice files about a Bob Scherr's activities the
[25:12.680 --> 25:17.720]  alleged FBI sting even if it even took place Ray McGovern and others have
[25:17.720 --> 25:22.600]  pointed out that the CIA may well be behind it meanwhile we have market
[25:22.600 --> 25:28.000]  watch EU bank failures will crash Wall Street again this is a column from Paul
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.080]  B. Ferrell but it's pretty well-written worst-case scenarios closing fast occupy
[25:33.080 --> 25:37.960]  Wall Street growing but no political power or allies yet feared yes attacked
[25:37.960 --> 25:42.400]  by GOP proxy Tea Party soon the occupation will explode into a new
[25:42.400 --> 25:47.560]  American Revolution when when a string of European bank collapses is dead
[25:47.560 --> 25:51.360]  ahead like the Arab Spring they will trigger an economic disaster for
[25:51.360 --> 25:57.040]  American banks is this a perfect storm brewing obviously we hope not we were
[25:57.040 --> 26:01.520]  talking before the break about the way the energy is absorbed back into the
[26:01.520 --> 26:05.880]  establishment back into the left-right paradigm and it's just ironic that the
[26:05.880 --> 26:10.680]  Tea Party happens to be a perfect sort of metaphor for a venting of the steam of
[26:10.680 --> 26:15.160]  that heat energy as it's converted back into the left-right now we see Obama and
[26:15.160 --> 26:20.000]  other Democratic factions as well as the foundation-funded Soros and Rockefeller
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.280]  back factions trying to absorb that energy and transform it into their
[26:24.280 --> 26:29.400]  agenda to quote tax the rich while the true rich are offshore and really
[26:29.400 --> 26:34.400]  steering the revolutionaries isn't it ironic that the strength of the unions
[26:34.400 --> 26:38.840]  was largely built up because robber barons like the Rockefellers were so
[26:38.840 --> 26:43.920]  heavy-handed but they have come to really steer those groups to finance a
[26:43.920 --> 26:48.080]  lot of the leftist political activity and the right for that matter they
[26:48.080 --> 26:52.160]  really have learned to steer so much meanwhile there's no money for street
[26:52.160 --> 26:56.120]  lights roving packs of wild dogs and open-air drug markets that's an
[26:56.120 --> 27:03.800]  economic collapse we have who is to blame Washington or Wall Street a poll
[27:03.800 --> 27:08.240]  shows conservatives blame washington's while many liberals blame Wall Street
[27:08.240 --> 27:12.880]  obviously they're working together for crony capitalism we know that but it's
[27:12.880 --> 27:17.000]  being steered back into the left-right agenda last night at the GOP debate you
[27:17.000 --> 27:22.120]  have Herman Cain and Ron Paul going head-to-head over that sort of issue of
[27:22.120 --> 27:26.320]  whether or not to blame Wall Street Herman Cain earlier made the statement
[27:26.320 --> 27:31.360]  that essentially the Occupy Wall Street people were to blame that they were just
[27:31.360 --> 27:34.320]  trying to hit out at Wall Street and that it was their fault if they're not
[27:34.320 --> 27:38.200]  rich Ron Paul called out that they're blaming the victims and that really
[27:38.200 --> 27:42.720]  Wall Street does have a lot to answer for while not everything of course so
[27:42.720 --> 27:46.800]  much is going on in Washington as well we'll keep an eye on that issue the big
[27:46.800 --> 27:51.240]  Wall Street banks are already trying to buy the 2012 election and the winner is
[27:51.240 --> 27:56.800]  if you follow the money and of course the most money correlates about 90% of
[27:56.800 --> 28:00.880]  the time with who wins these major elections 2008 it was certainly Barack
[28:00.880 --> 28:05.560]  Obama with more Wall Street money than John McCain and so far in this 2012
[28:05.560 --> 28:10.200]  cycle it is Mitt Romney again and again with the Big Bank money at the top of
[28:10.200 --> 28:15.400]  the list for all of the big six banks including Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley
[28:15.400 --> 28:21.240]  Bank of America City Group JP Morgan Chase and the rest of them Ron Paul
[28:21.240 --> 28:25.880]  consistently at the bottom of that list Herman Cain too even though he worked
[28:25.880 --> 28:31.200]  for the Federal Reserve and has opposed an audit debt surfdom is the new
[28:31.200 --> 28:35.560]  American normal trapped assets that generate no income streams are not
[28:35.560 --> 28:40.480]  capital pointing out how American hassle households are totally insolvent and are
[28:40.480 --> 28:44.280]  just swallowed up in debt and their assets lose value all the time the
[28:44.280 --> 28:48.600]  Greeks have already shifted over 200 billion euros out of the country into
[28:48.600 --> 28:53.320]  Swiss banks that is the quote fat cat Greeks as the Daily Mail calls them
[28:53.320 --> 28:59.080]  meanwhile there is record protests there the mother of all strike shuts down
[28:59.080 --> 29:04.000]  Greece reports Sky News a two-day general strike is shut down public transport
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.840]  schools and shopping Greece is over 50,000 protesters converge in central
[29:08.840 --> 29:14.320]  Athens and of course all the debates over further bailouts in Europe continue
[29:14.320 --> 29:18.800]  to threaten all the world markets Bob Chapman has also written on this on the
[29:18.800 --> 29:22.400]  coming stock market crash the stock market will fall the world is drowning
[29:22.400 --> 29:27.960]  in debt and that of course is all on top of what I've already brought up how the
[29:27.960 --> 29:32.360]  Federal Reserve has now pressured the FDIC into backing hundreds of trillions
[29:32.360 --> 29:35.800]  of derivatives from the major banks we'll get into it with Paul Watson on the

[33:48.240 --> 33:53.880]  lead Egypt's Arab Spring with US State Department backing and now he is part of

[34:16.320 --> 34:22.080]  co-op Occupy Wall Street movement but this one goes a step further because
[34:22.080 --> 34:26.760]  none other as you mentioned than the US State Department has now stepped in to
[34:26.760 --> 34:32.080]  try and subvert and control this movement just as I did with the so-called Arab
[34:32.080 --> 34:37.200]  Spring from the start of the year and now wired news is reporting that Ahmed Ma
[34:37.200 --> 34:42.560]  who was one of the leading pioneers of the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt is now
[34:42.560 --> 34:49.040]  quote advising the Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York and Washington DC
[34:49.040 --> 34:55.360]  so I mean why should that provoke suspicion well because Ma is basically a
[34:55.360 --> 35:00.360]  stooge of the US State Department it was the State Department who years before
[35:00.360 --> 35:05.720]  the uprising in Egypt trained and funded all these full revolutionaries Ma
[35:05.720 --> 35:13.040]  prime amongst them through the Alliance for Youth Movement Summit in 2008 as
[35:13.040 --> 35:19.160]  well as the canvas organization after that and it was actually Ahmed Ma's
[35:19.160 --> 35:25.280]  April 6th organization that's what it's called the Genesis of it at least who
[35:25.280 --> 35:31.280]  met in 2008 you know three years before the uprising in Egypt with the likes of
[35:31.280 --> 35:36.560]  the CFR Homeland Security the State Department and heads of some of the
[35:36.560 --> 35:42.160]  biggest corporations in the world and they met to quote facilitate solutions
[35:42.160 --> 35:48.320]  to problem spots in the world so we have these umbrella organizations who
[35:48.320 --> 35:54.320]  proclaim to be grassroots activists all of which you know regularly convene and
[35:54.320 --> 35:57.480]  get their marching orders from the US government and the heads of top
[35:57.480 --> 36:02.800]  corporations now they're becoming involved in directing and steering the
[36:02.800 --> 36:09.000]  Occupy Wall Street movement so you know Houston we have a problem yeah I would
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.880]  say so I'd like to remind the audience that Al Gore none other than the climate
[36:14.880 --> 36:20.280]  change carbon tax former vice president called for an American version of the
[36:20.280 --> 36:24.720]  Arab Spring just about three weeks before it actually kicked off Paul now
[36:24.720 --> 36:28.920]  we have someone from the Arab Spring helping to steer it someone who even
[36:28.920 --> 36:33.840]  the Egyptian protesters called a dictator and tried to kick out of the group
[36:33.840 --> 36:39.600]  well precisely and I mean it looks like they're trying to turn Occupy Wall
[36:39.600 --> 36:43.560]  Street into an American Spring which as you said is exactly what I'll go called
[36:43.560 --> 36:48.920]  for which is worrying because the Arab Spring certainly in Egypt you know did
[36:48.920 --> 36:54.360]  not result in some glorious grassroots people's revolution it resulted in a
[36:54.360 --> 36:59.840]  military dictatorship the tyranny in Egypt is now worse under this interim
[36:59.840 --> 37:04.560]  military hunter which refuses to relinquish power than it ever was under
[37:04.560 --> 37:08.880]  Mubarak the military's killing minorities in
[37:08.880 --> 37:12.800]  prisoning dissidents it's worse than it was before they kicked him out because
[37:12.800 --> 37:18.080]  from the very start it was steered subverted infiltrated by these very
[37:18.080 --> 37:23.880]  State Department CFR interests who use people like Ma as their stooge to go in
[37:23.880 --> 37:30.320]  there and do that and then there's also good well there's other characters I
[37:30.320 --> 37:36.280]  mean Ivan Marovich he was on the ground in New York on the very first day of
[37:36.280 --> 37:41.600]  the protest and he was the one that's taught them how to use this creepy
[37:41.600 --> 37:46.040]  collectivist consensus thing where you know they all repeat these zombie-like
[37:46.040 --> 37:50.800]  mantras his group is called OPTOR and it's one of the same umbrella
[37:50.800 --> 37:56.440]  organization similar to the April 6th organization this is the group the CIA
[37:56.440 --> 38:01.840]  sponsored to help get rid of Slobodan Milosevic this is the group backed by
[38:01.840 --> 38:07.480]  the US National Endowment for Democracy and we've seen their clenched fist logo
[38:07.480 --> 38:11.640]  it's a specific type of logo it's not just a generic clenched fist appear on
[38:11.640 --> 38:16.160]  these Wall Street Occupy Wall Street banners and it's because the leader of
[38:16.160 --> 38:20.240]  that organization was there on the ground at the very start coordinating a lot of
[38:20.240 --> 38:25.240]  it and his group is admittedly a CIA National Endowment for Democracy front
[38:25.240 --> 38:29.600]  that has been used in the past by the US military industrial complex to help do
[38:29.600 --> 38:34.760]  its bidding yeah I mean we had on the ground reports there in Egypt Max
[38:34.760 --> 38:38.960]  Kaiser if I recall properly saying you know this is spontaneous these are real
[38:38.960 --> 38:42.640]  people in the street streets true grassroots and I believe all those
[38:42.640 --> 38:47.360]  reports but at the same time we now know about the groups behind that movement
[38:47.360 --> 38:51.880]  that seemed to crop up spontaneously and then where is the press coverage after
[38:51.880 --> 38:56.320]  all that celebratory stuff what happened what's going on with leaders like
[38:56.320 --> 39:00.520]  Al Bairadi you know with ties to the International Crisis Group and the CFR
[39:00.520 --> 39:06.520]  even now today he's calling for a new roadmap to Egypt for Egypt rather you
[39:06.520 --> 39:11.520]  know you see where I'm going with this Paul precisely and the International
[39:11.520 --> 39:16.120]  Crisis Group also fraternized with this Ahmed Maher and of course that involves
[39:16.120 --> 39:20.480]  Zabigniew Brzezinski and George Soros on top of that so it's all the same
[39:20.480 --> 39:24.440]  characters again I mean these these groups are formed in what they call
[39:24.440 --> 39:29.800]  revolution training schools in places like Serbia which are funded controlled
[39:29.800 --> 39:34.280]  by the US military industrial complex and they then dispatch to different parts
[39:34.280 --> 39:39.240]  of the world to either create or co-op these revolutionary movements and again
[39:39.240 --> 39:42.960]  it's to ensure that the outcome is beneficial to US military industrial
[39:42.960 --> 39:46.880]  complex interest they knew ahead of time that Egypt was going to happen do you
[39:46.880 --> 39:50.760]  really think they're just going to stand by and let that vacuum of power allow
[39:50.760 --> 39:55.360]  anyone to step in and take control of that key country in the Middle East no
[39:55.360 --> 39:59.600]  which is why they were on it from the very start so to think that these same
[39:59.600 --> 40:05.200]  interests weren't also watching Occupy Wall Street from the very start would be
[40:05.200 --> 40:08.600]  naive to say the least
[40:08.600 --> 40:13.320]  think yeah it's amazing we just need to continue to watch that now you reported
[40:13.320 --> 40:17.600]  a couple days ago on the government front group known as demos who have
[40:17.600 --> 40:22.040]  called to abolish critical thinking and they're re-educating students in the
[40:22.040 --> 40:28.680]  classroom Paul can we talk about that so yeah this is a it's a government front
[40:28.680 --> 40:34.040]  group is it was actually founded by Marxist back in the 90s it was then
[40:34.040 --> 40:38.760]  closely affiliated with Tony Blair's Labour Party now David Cameron the
[40:38.760 --> 40:43.560]  current Prime Minister has given speeches at their events as part of the
[40:43.560 --> 40:48.960]  quote progressive conservatism agenda and basically the article I wrote was
[40:48.960 --> 40:55.800]  about how demos is now going into schools in Great Britain and teaching
[40:55.800 --> 41:01.200]  students how to maintain critical thinking and they do this by basically
[41:01.200 --> 41:04.920]  saying that anything that disagrees with the official version of events either
[41:04.920 --> 41:09.280]  from government or the mainstream media is a quote conspiracy theory and then
[41:09.280 --> 41:16.040]  they go on to define the term conspiracy theory as completely false so I wrote
[41:16.040 --> 41:20.880]  that it's it's a fantastic irony that while they're trying to promote quote
[41:20.880 --> 41:26.560]  critical thinking they're actually in an authoritarian manner telling people that
[41:26.560 --> 41:30.800]  they can't have critical thinking and that they can't trust alternative sources
[41:30.800 --> 41:35.440]  of information which as we've seen over the past few years though not perfect
[41:35.440 --> 41:39.520]  to proven a dam site more accurate than the likes of the BBC which is where this
[41:39.520 --> 41:45.200]  report went out you know from weapons of mass destruction the murder of Dr. David
[41:45.200 --> 41:52.240]  Kelly the the establishment has proven itself completely not credible in these
[41:52.240 --> 41:57.600]  instances and yet demos is going in and saying that children aren't allowed to
[41:57.600 --> 42:00.720]  bring conspiracy theories into the classroom when it was the British
[42:00.720 --> 42:05.000]  government who ordered Al Gore's an inconvenient truth which is found by a
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.840]  British High Court judge to contain nine significant errors it was the British
[42:08.840 --> 42:13.280]  government that ordered that film to be shown to school children in England
[42:13.280 --> 42:17.600]  Wales and Scotland so while the government's enforcing this BS onto them
[42:17.600 --> 42:21.160]  they're simultaneously saying that you know if you question it then you're
[42:21.160 --> 42:24.400]  going to be in trouble and demos has been sent in there as this government
[42:24.400 --> 42:29.160]  lobbying group to ensure that students don't have critical thinking because that
[42:29.160 --> 42:33.000]  underpins the entire education system. All right Paul I think we want to go to a
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.440]  clip of that now but of course this is a textbook almost word-for-word out of the
[42:37.440 --> 42:41.680]  Cass Sunstein playbook that's Obama's informations are he wrote a paper in
[42:41.680 --> 42:46.640]  2008 on conspiracy theories how they need to be infiltrated and how that
[42:46.640 --> 42:50.640]  information needs to be steered and broken up and otherwise undermined let's
[42:50.640 --> 42:58.320]  go to that clip now and then talk more about Cass Sunstein. Okay we're having
[42:58.320 --> 43:01.840]  some technical issues they're going to queue up that audio. The consequences can
[43:01.840 --> 43:05.840]  be dangerous that's the warning from the think tank demos which is concerned
[43:05.840 --> 43:10.360]  that conspiracy theories and propaganda are entering the classroom. The BBC Asian
[43:10.360 --> 43:15.160]  Network's Catherine Nye reports. We're here about information and how we get it
[43:15.160 --> 43:19.520]  so you have trust on one side and you have distrust on the other side. Two
[43:19.520 --> 43:24.120]  school sessions in which demos explore pupils online abilities in Liverpool. I
[43:24.120 --> 43:28.920]  was searching on Google and believed the first answer that came up to be honest.
[43:28.920 --> 43:35.040]  I know I shouldn't do it but Google's like a trusted website. And in East London
[43:35.040 --> 43:38.440]  where conspiracy theories are quickly raised. There was a documentary about
[43:38.440 --> 43:43.880]  this guy he does his own research finding out that in one of the FBI you
[43:43.880 --> 43:49.640]  know the building that got hit by a plane apparently it was a not a plane it
[43:49.640 --> 43:54.200]  was a missile from the army. Some pupils are internet savvy others fall
[43:54.200 --> 43:57.840]  foul to the problems the think tank says are common. Demos brought together
[43:57.840 --> 44:02.760]  existing research and surveyed 500 teachers across England and Wales. Teachers
[44:02.760 --> 44:07.240]  are increasingly finding that their pupils are bringing into the classroom
[44:07.240 --> 44:12.140]  conspiracy theories misinformation propaganda that they found on the
[44:12.140 --> 44:16.000]  internet. And what I think that means is that young people aren't really being
[44:16.000 --> 44:21.560]  taught enough about how to critically assess and evaluate the information that
[44:21.560 --> 44:26.800]  they're finding online. Demos want digital judgment to be a core part of the
[44:26.800 --> 44:31.040]  curriculum. They say teachers need the training and resources to do that and
[44:31.040 --> 44:35.880]  they want parents to encourage their children to think more critically. Okay
[44:35.880 --> 44:39.480]  that's enough of that clip but Paul Watson what's your reaction they bring
[44:39.480 --> 44:43.600]  in 9-11 conspiracy theories there and they openly talk about how you can only
[44:43.600 --> 44:48.660]  trust official propaganda sources when there's more propaganda going on than
[44:48.660 --> 44:53.560]  during the Soviet Union Paul. Well yeah again it's complete hypocrisy they say
[44:53.560 --> 44:56.680]  oh we just want to encourage critical thinking when they're doing the exact
[44:56.680 --> 45:00.000]  opposite they're saying believe the government believe the mainstream media
[45:00.000 --> 45:05.880]  everything else is BS and I mean they put out a report this Demos group which
[45:05.880 --> 45:10.240]  again is just a front for the government always has been founded by Marxists
[45:10.240 --> 45:15.080]  called the power of unreason and in that report they say they need to quote
[45:15.080 --> 45:19.800]  fight back against people who question the authorities to quote increase
[45:19.800 --> 45:25.440]  trusting government and they advocate infiltrating conspiracy websites so it's
[45:25.440 --> 45:30.520]  as he said it's the Cass Sunstein model it's not just you know getting in a
[45:30.520 --> 45:34.080]  marketplace of ideas and saying let's look at all different sides of the story
[45:34.080 --> 45:38.480]  it's saying this is extremist this is wrong and in their own report they go
[45:38.480 --> 45:42.200]  on to basically say that anyone who questions the government is an extremist
[45:42.200 --> 45:47.280]  and a quote terrorist recruiter and so as Cass Sunstein's agenda was
[45:47.280 --> 45:51.320]  admittedly about you know he went on to talk about why don't we tax certain
[45:51.320 --> 45:55.960]  ideas or ban free speech that's precisely the the core of this Demos
[45:55.960 --> 46:01.120]  groups agenda and they're trying to because they know kids in British
[46:01.120 --> 46:04.480]  schools are starting to get information which contradicts what they're being
[46:04.480 --> 46:08.200]  taught in schools on their own government curriculums they're getting very
[46:08.200 --> 46:12.760]  worried about it and that's why they need to launch these kind of infiltration
[46:12.760 --> 46:17.680]  strategies and of course Cass Sunstein talks about infiltrating in his
[46:17.680 --> 46:22.880]  conspiracy theory papers at least 14 times and openly talks about the 9-11
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.280]  conspiracy theories in particular and how all this kind of alternative
[46:27.280 --> 46:31.240]  information poses a threat to the establishment whether or not it's true
[46:31.240 --> 46:37.360]  simply that it poses a threat to the establishment precisely I mean that's
[46:37.360 --> 46:42.320]  why and it's not a conspiracy theory anymore st.com Israel they all admit to
[46:42.320 --> 46:47.520]  it they hire armies of people to go online to vote things up or down to leave
[46:47.520 --> 46:53.640]  negative comments that's part of cyber warfare and it's 2011 that's a routine
[46:53.640 --> 46:59.520]  part of cyber warfare we certainly are subject to that on a regular basis you
[46:59.520 --> 47:04.560]  know Alex was talking the other day about how immediately when the Alex
[47:04.560 --> 47:09.840]  Jones channel releases a video it gets voted down by 11 people often they don't
[47:09.840 --> 47:14.280]  even leave comments just instantly voted down with 11 dislikes and that's
[47:14.280 --> 47:18.680]  precisely what happened on why I saw the other day almost minutes after it was
[47:18.680 --> 47:23.600]  uploaded 11 people had voted it down so they've literally hired people to
[47:23.600 --> 47:29.080]  sit on our websites and other websites and engage in this you know infiltration
[47:29.080 --> 47:32.120]  effort and they admit to it and now they're doing it it's not a conspiracy
[47:32.120 --> 47:36.640]  theory anymore it's on the record yeah and some scene calls for that to cyber
[47:36.640 --> 47:41.440]  warfare as well as physical infiltration through quote information diversity
[47:41.440 --> 47:44.840]  well we're going to work on getting some of those people on the show but what
[47:44.840 --> 47:52.040]  else are we looking at in the news today Paul well I mean last night Obama gave
[47:52.040 --> 47:56.280]  this interview where he's again he's offering support for Occupy Wall Street
[47:56.280 --> 48:00.560]  they've had bead and Pelosi you know the rest of the Democratic machine offer
[48:00.560 --> 48:05.360]  their support for it Obama's basically trying to exploit the whole movement as
[48:05.360 --> 48:11.120]  an election campaign gimmick he's trying to pose as a populist and we predicted
[48:11.120 --> 48:14.240]  this would happen several weeks ago along with other people like Gerald
[48:14.240 --> 48:20.680]  Tlenti when in reality you know it's 2008 campaign completely funded by Wall
[48:20.680 --> 48:25.000]  Street he's received the most money from Wall Street out of any candidate his
[48:25.000 --> 48:29.920]  cabinet stuff with Wall Street inside us he's even more reliant on Wall Street in
[48:29.920 --> 48:35.200]  2012 because we know a lot of the money's also gone behind Mitt Romney but I
[48:35.200 --> 48:40.560]  mean for Obama to pose and embrace this this movement when he's you know he's
[48:40.560 --> 48:44.360]  Mr. Wall Street himself is the ultimate Wall Street puppet just shows how
[48:44.360 --> 48:48.800]  people are trying to co-op this but according to the polls which you covered
[48:48.800 --> 48:53.280]  last night on Nightly News it's probably a little over half of Americans
[48:53.280 --> 48:58.320]  actually see right through that and they still blame Washington itself more so
[48:58.320 --> 49:03.600]  than Wall Street so it's a desperate attempt by the Obama campaign to wrap
[49:03.600 --> 49:08.840]  himself in this phony cloak of populism but I mean it it looks like it's
[49:08.840 --> 49:12.560]  probably going to fail I mean what do you call that how do you steer people
[49:12.560 --> 49:18.120]  towards the crony capitalism problem just as we saw in the daily bail today
[49:18.120 --> 49:23.040]  that the Federal Reserve facilitated absorbing basically hundreds of
[49:23.040 --> 49:26.960]  trillions of dollars in derivatives and guaranteeing that they'd be insured by
[49:26.960 --> 49:30.480]  the FDIC Paul I mean that is a Wall Street problem but it's certainly a
[49:30.480 --> 49:34.520]  Washington issue as well but we're not allowed to talk about the Federal Reserve
[49:34.520 --> 49:39.600]  well now I mean you had the reports that occupy Wall Street demonstrations where
[49:39.600 --> 49:42.920]  they were they were saying you know if you've got a Ron Paul sign get out of
[49:42.920 --> 49:47.240]  here and it's a fundamental problem that comes up time and time again I think
[49:47.240 --> 49:51.680]  it's fair to say judging from the PBS poll which I talked about which is in the
[49:51.680 --> 49:57.280]  Wall Street Journal yesterday probably about 50% of those protesters in New
[49:57.280 --> 50:01.840]  York and DC and other places are aware of the true scope of the problem that
[50:01.840 --> 50:05.440]  it's more than just Wall Street as you were just mentioning but then you've
[50:05.440 --> 50:10.080]  got this strain which is becoming increasingly dominant I'm afraid to say
[50:10.080 --> 50:14.920]  who are basically communists socialists and collectivists and they're being led
[50:14.920 --> 50:20.480]  by the likes of Francis Fox Piven and all these are the leftist elites to call
[50:20.480 --> 50:26.440]  for the destruction of capitalism and its replacement with this state mandated

[53:07.000 --> 53:10.360]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[53:10.360 --> 53:14.240]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[53:14.240 --> 53:18.440]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[53:18.440 --> 53:22.920]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[53:22.920 --> 53:27.640]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[53:27.640 --> 53:31.440]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[53:31.440 --> 53:35.040]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[53:35.040 --> 53:39.360]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[53:39.360 --> 53:42.560]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[53:42.560 --> 53:46.200]  generators offered by Solutions from Science one of my oldest sponsors you

[53:56.560 --> 54:01.600]  1-877-327-0365
[54:01.600 --> 54:21.600]  you
[54:21.600 --> 54:26.760]  Paul Joseph Watson editor of prisonplanet.com is with us we are
[54:26.760 --> 54:31.360]  essentially wrapping up our analysis of Occupy Wall Street Paul we were cut off
[54:31.360 --> 54:35.720]  by the break can you please continue with the point you were making yeah I was
[54:35.720 --> 54:39.880]  just making the point that from the poll figures that we've seen it looks like
[54:39.880 --> 54:45.280]  there's about 50% of the demonstrators who are who understand the full scope of
[54:45.280 --> 54:49.800]  the problem and also understand that communism and socialism aren't the
[54:49.800 --> 54:53.440]  answer but then there's a there's another hardcore I mean this is a quote
[54:53.440 --> 54:58.840]  from a New York Post columnist who went and visited them quote it's not an
[54:58.840 --> 55:04.080]  overstatement to describe the Cutty Park as an as New York's Marxist epicenter
[55:04.080 --> 55:08.400]  flags with the iconic face of the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara are
[55:08.400 --> 55:13.800]  everywhere the only American flag I saw was hanging upside down the occupiers
[55:13.800 --> 55:18.200]  openly refer to each other as comrade and just about every piece of literature
[55:18.200 --> 55:23.680]  on offer advocated socialism in the Marxist tradition as a cure all for the
[55:23.680 --> 55:29.680]  inequalities of the American economic system so I mean you've got a communist
[55:29.680 --> 55:33.920]  party USA marching in Chicago and you know they get cheered by the
[55:33.920 --> 55:39.560]  demonstrators and a lot of people don't want to hear this but 50% of that
[55:39.560 --> 55:43.620]  movement I mean there's a lot of great people involved but the ones leading the
[55:43.620 --> 55:48.520]  chorus and you can see this in the Adam Kokesh interviews they're
[55:48.520 --> 55:53.440]  collectivist they want to concentrate more power in the hands of government well
[55:53.440 --> 55:57.920]  that's the issue really even in a rosy analysis it's been extreme abuse is a
[55:57.920 --> 56:02.080]  big government all the insider deals and the rest of it that's helped contribute
[56:02.080 --> 56:06.640]  to so much of these problems and many people as you point out one another big
[56:06.640 --> 56:10.800]  government solution what more big government think that taxing the quote
[56:10.800 --> 56:16.900]  rich will somehow fix our issues of course the austerity measures to tax the
[56:16.900 --> 56:21.280]  middle class and lower class are equally flawed but how are we going to begin to
[56:21.280 --> 56:26.480]  reign in these offshore interest well by understanding that it's the Federal
[56:26.480 --> 56:31.680]  Reserve that you know gave the green light for the trillions in bailout
[56:31.680 --> 56:36.200]  money to foreign banks mainly that doesn't seem to be a central problem with
[56:36.200 --> 56:40.840]  a lot of these protesters you know they're not occupying the Fed that I mean
[56:40.840 --> 56:45.640]  we had a protest last week where Alex Jones went and led a rally but primarily
[56:45.640 --> 56:49.440]  they're occupying places in New York they're not occupying the White House
[56:49.440 --> 56:53.200]  lawn when these are the sources of sources are most of the problems and
[56:53.200 --> 56:58.320]  their solution to the problem of corporate greed is to give the government
[56:58.320 --> 57:04.680]  power to seize wealth by force by violent means if necessary and remember
[57:04.680 --> 57:09.560]  that a third of the protesters according to this poll I mentioned in the
[57:09.560 --> 57:14.640]  Wall Street Journal support using violence to enforce their ideas and they
[57:14.640 --> 57:18.200]  want to concentrate that power in the hands of government to oversee this
[57:18.200 --> 57:23.600]  program of quote fair redistribution which of course you know every example
[57:23.600 --> 57:27.600]  throughout history tells us that this never works and that it always ends up
[57:27.600 --> 57:32.480]  with an even more tyrannical and corrupt state while you know the country
[57:32.480 --> 57:36.000]  itself rots away and the people are enslaved I mean maybe that's why North
[57:36.000 --> 57:41.080]  Korea came out and embrace Occupy Wall Street because that perfectly describes
[57:41.080 --> 57:45.720]  their country so as he said there's a tipping point and it's it's getting to
[57:45.720 --> 57:49.420]  the level where the communists and the collectivists are starting to take this
[57:49.420 --> 57:54.120]  over you know the other side of the Occupy Wall Street is the police
[57:54.120 --> 57:59.200]  occupation I mean we've got a kind of militarized police action down there and
[57:59.200 --> 58:03.600]  whatever the views of these protesters may be why are police beating them
[58:03.600 --> 58:08.520]  slamming women's heads dragging people into banks basically protecting the
[58:08.520 --> 58:12.320]  banks directly arresting people trying to close accounts and all the rest of it
[58:12.320 --> 58:15.600]  well let's talk about it on the other side we also have Webster Tarpley and
[58:15.600 --> 58:21.000]  then Alan Watt coming up stay tuned info wars.com Eric Dike sitting in Alex
[58:21.000 --> 58:46.320]  back tomorrow and for his nightly news this is GCN the Genesis Communications

[58:59.480 --> 59:03.560]  think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away number one

[59:09.640 --> 59:16.200]  dangerous food shortage trends number three take decisive action a perfect
[59:16.200 --> 59:21.200]  storm is brewing or a global food crisis that's why I'm telling everyone to

[59:26.400 --> 59:31.360]  deadliest famines in history don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits

[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:12.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:19.960]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:27.840]  Alex Jones it is the second hour and we are just
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:32.160]  getting started with the full-scale all-points analysis we have Webster
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.560]  Tarpley coming up on the other side of this break then later Alan Watt but
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:41.200]  right now we are with Paul Joseph Watson prisonplanet.com editor also in the
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:45.480]  news today in the London Telegraph White House accused of Barack Obama
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:50.640]  green-screen trickery so much as the economy bottom been bottomed out that
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:56.880]  even Barack Obama's PR stunts have become illusory and hollow the White
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.480]  House has been accused of digitally adjusting President Barack Obama's
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:04.920]  weekly address to the nation to give the impression he was sitting in front of a
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:09.520]  car assembly line in Detroit when in fact it was just later digitally added
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:14.040]  he was not in fact giving a speech in front of a car plant just kind of
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:19.400]  another little note in this symphony of economic disaster that's spiraling out
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:24.800]  of control it's no wonder people are out crying over the economic implosion
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.720]  the question is where will the energy go Paul and what is happening with the
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:32.840]  police state on the police side of things of this Occupy Wall Street movement
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:37.480]  well I mean you're right it gives the it gives the police the opportunity to
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.840]  crack some heads and a lot of the American people support it because of
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.440]  these people will have been demonized by some sectors of the mainstream media
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:51.360]  the police go in with a heavy-handed response and a lot of the American
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.400]  people support it similar thing happens in England when these protests take
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.680]  place so yeah it's a police state bandwagon and of course they get the
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.800]  opportunity to do that and that's that's only going to continue as these
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:10.640]  these occupation events are prolonged I'm sure that the certainly in Europe the
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.560]  cold weather is going to put a lot to it a stop to a lot of it because people
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.720]  simply you know won't be able to camp out all night but certainly in America I
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:25.520]  can see this going on for several weeks and months to come yeah yeah and then
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:30.040]  you've got reports of donations from major banks to the police department
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:35.360]  you've got police on video helping corral protesters back into banks so they
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.920]  could be arrested for allegedly causing a disruption when they simply tried to
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.440]  close their bank accounts regardless of if they were protesters what are we
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.640]  seeing in kind of this fascist nexus between the Wall Street big banks who are
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.840]  really behind the Wall Street problems and the police there to defend them well
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.880]  of course it's completely allied with each other in a close relationship I
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.920]  mean all these the same with Obama I mean he's the biggest Wall Street puppet
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:08.160]  going but in this poll which I've been talking about 50% of the protesters say
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:13.360]  they're gonna vote for him again so I don't I mean it's the same people falling
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.440]  for the same tricks over and over again so but it's only half of them you know
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.360]  in in years gone by it might be 70 80% of them falling for these same political
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:27.480]  stunts again and again so it's up to us the alternative media to really get in
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:31.880]  there and try and dictate the conversation otherwise these Obama lobby
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:36.680]  groups will do so and they'll continue to define where all this energy goes in
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:41.160]  the long run I don't know sometimes I think people like being con that they
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.400]  almost find power and people who are obviously lying and telling them what
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:51.000]  they want to hear I don't know where the lazy I mean it's it's not easy to see
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.280]  through it on a set it's not easy to see oh this guy's involved in Occupy Wall
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.040]  Street three years ago he was working with the State Department to do this two
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:02.440]  years before that he was doing that people are never gonna look into that
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.800]  because they don't have the time to scratch below the surface so it you know
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.120]  it takes it it takes a bit more gumption and interest in the subject to
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.800]  actually find out what's going on which is why it's easier for them to fall for
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:18.960]  these simple minded stunts every time so that's our job to prevent that from
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.040]  happening and of course the way the media is portraying it and yeah I mean we
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.680]  just have to get ready for the same kind of tea party co-opting with this
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:31.400]  Occupy Wall Street energy what kind of new taxes will they impose based on the
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:35.680]  supposed demands we have Webster Tarpley on the other side and more analysis of
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:40.720]  Iran Occupy Wall Street and much more coming up stay tuned info wars calm

[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:24.160]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.480]  the breakthroughs right now we are joined by Dr. Webster Tarpley a PhD in
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:44.320]  history a longtime analyst and critic who's been right about so many things
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:53.480]  and a truth teller to boot thanks for joining us Webster are you there Webster
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:58.400]  yes hi okay now I hear you yes so out of the gates we've been talking all
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:03.560]  morning about this State Department agitator Ahmed Maher who has now been
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:08.920]  openly advising the Occupy movement and he was part of Egypt's Arab Spring what
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:14.440]  do you know about this Webster well this is just one one case of many and I
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:18.920]  think you got to put this in perspective the Occupy Wall Street movement is
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:23.240]  tremendously positive development it's exactly what we need in the sense that
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:28.080]  it finally tells people who is the enemy and Wall Street finance capital is the
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:32.720]  enemy any other enemy is a sham and you're fighting anybody else you're
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.200]  wasting your time this is an authentic mass strike it started in Wisconsin in
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:41.520]  February it kicked over into Ohio a bunch of other places fighting these
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:47.440]  reactionary governors but now it's it's this Occupy Wall Street now the problem
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.600]  of course is that whereas the ferment right when you see members of the
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:56.960]  transport workers union and local 199 people to work in hospitals these are
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.480]  real working people with real concerns and sometimes they do get interviewed and
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:05.920]  you can hear what they think the problem of course is that the intelligence
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.480]  community has prepared a counterinsurgency apparatus so I wouldn't
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:16.000]  call this guy an advisor he's a wrecker he's a saboteur he's a brainwasher and I
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.160]  have tried very hard to delve into how this stuff was all done it started
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:25.400]  during the summer in a steering committee in 16 Beaver Street which means
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:30.040]  basically Wall Street it's right down there in the financial district and we
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:36.680]  got a couple of veterans of European wrecking operations these I think many
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:40.480]  of these people are you know suspected of having connections to NATO
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:44.640]  intelligence we're told for example in an article in Mother Jones that a lady
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.200]  called Begonia and a guy called Luis came in from Madrid and he said oh we
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:53.240]  just had the wonderful Ingeniados of Madrid and isn't that great and we had
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:57.560]  this general assembly where we have consensus and facilitators and all the
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:01.360]  rest of this and you guys should copy it now the problem of course with copying
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:05.960]  the Madrid in Ingeniados is that they were a total failure and one of the main
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:10.560]  reasons they failed totally completely absolutely was because they had this
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:15.360]  straight-jacket this crazy consensus method which means you don't get any
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.400]  leaders you get these creepy facilitators who are not political leaders but
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:24.440]  they're technical experts in this idiotic system and of course since they
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:29.240]  they debate like it's a filibuster right nothing but an endless filibuster they
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.840]  they debate about what to have for lunch and where to put the garbage cans and
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.520]  all this stuff they never get down to having any demand so you look at the
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:41.200]  Ingeniados the main international monetary fund agent on the scene was
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:46.880]  Zapatero at the beginning and he's still there they they failed now I dealt a
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:51.840]  little bit further into these Ingeniados the lady called Pilar Bazelga and if
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.960]  you can read Spanish you can go to her site no morir idiota don't die a fool
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:02.200]  they can be translated quite easily she on my television on my radio program this
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:06.600]  past week she said look the camp of the Ingeniados was built by the Spanish
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.560]  Army it was built essentially by NATO and they got all kinds of you know
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.000]  positive things that were essentially delivered but the price of this of course
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.760]  is that those people then run the show and her quote on it was I think a very
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:24.600]  good one the Ingeniados were a soap opera for zombies who thought they were
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:29.040]  doing the revolution now the answer to this of course is don't give up on the
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:33.040]  revolution the revolution against finance capital and Wall Street is the
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:37.480]  one it's the authentic one but what you've got to do is kick out the kick
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:42.360]  out these facilitators get rid of them stop with the consensus method the
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:46.840]  consensus method is a filibuster in the sense that it's minority rule a small
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:51.160]  minority can block the entire thing and wreck the entire proceedings so kick
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.080]  that out the American way is majority rule and the rights of the minority of
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:00.480]  course to speak are are taken care of they remain but you're going to need
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.360]  majority rule and you got to develop an organic stratum of political leaders
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.920]  that would not be these creepy facilitators you saw one of those
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:13.560]  creeps in action when the the Atlanta General Assembly refused to listen to
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:17.480]  representative John Lewis who's a real authentic veteran hero of the civil
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.760]  rights struggle and he should have been seen as an emissary of the black
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:25.040]  community to a mainly white group one of the main principles of mass strike
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.760]  organizing is once you get something going you got to spread it you got to
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.160]  bring in new groups you've got if your students mainly at the beginning you've
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.040]  got to get labor you've got to get blacks you got to get Hispanics you got to
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:39.520]  get women you got to get all the main groups in the society so they're doing
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:43.160]  the opposite politically where do you see this going in terms of top-down
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.640]  democratic and left-leaning leadership attempting to absorb the energy whatever
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:51.720]  they say on the ground whatever the grassroots protesters are talking about
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.480]  individually I say break it I say that they're very vulnerable see this is
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.280]  exactly when the ruling class is most vulnerable because they've now got masses
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:03.600]  going in motion they did this right they put this on TV what I recommend people
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:07.520]  to do is go to your local occupy whatever it is and these now exist in
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:11.920]  hundreds and hundreds of cities go in there with some workers some some people
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:17.040]  who have some sense go in there and stage a coup take over their general
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:22.240]  assemblies they look this straightjacket this this pro crusty in bed if you want
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.840]  right it's the bed where you lie down and if you're if you're too short they
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.280]  stretch you and if you're too long they cut your feet off nobody wants to lie
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.480]  down on this right the American working people don't have time for endless
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:38.000]  debate they need a job they need a doctor they need to stop a fraud closure on
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.680]  their house they need they need to you know to do something about student loan
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:47.280]  debts so go in there and say look we're going back to typical American methods
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:51.960]  the majority rules kick out the facilitator have had somebody elected
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:56.400]  chairman who enjoys the confidence of the people based on political criteria
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:00.680]  not because they're experts in the in the stupid anarchist system of a of
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:05.800]  gilder loose and that is also the the other thing about it is that most of
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:11.080]  these groups are anarchist anarchoid and when you look at them those are not
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:15.400]  professional revolutionaries their professional records their professional
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:20.840]  saboteurs their police agents their task is is largely to destroy so we have
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:25.680]  the headbusters of Vancouver British Columbia it is a branch of the
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:30.360]  situation is international in effect which is a group of goes back to the
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:35.760]  1950s a bunch of washed up has been never was artists and writers and so for
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:40.040]  and they were used by NATO intelligence to overthrow general de Gaulle of France
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:44.920]  in 1968 to 70 because that's that was the main enemy of NATO at the time so
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:50.200]  those methods also live on in this group and they're all agreed when you when
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.040]  some of these people get on television they get a network television they
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:58.800]  could be saying things like 1% Wall Street sales tax on all transactions make
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:04.400]  Wall Street pay they could say cancel all student loans wipe out 1 trillion let
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:08.120]  the zombie bankers eat the losses they were bailed out now let them say thank
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:11.000]  you Webster on another front the derivatives is something you've been
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.080]  talking about for literally years and years and years being the huge elephant
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:20.160]  in the room and another front of the same issue we have Bank of America moving
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:25.360]  its Merrill Lynch derivatives into the FDIC and open to the Federal Reserve
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:30.040]  discount have you seen that news well again we want to instead of worrying
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.480]  about what the enemy is doing we got to figure out what we're doing and what we
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:38.760]  should be doing is is use the vehicle of these these these protests in
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.280]  which if you can go into one of these protests take out the facilitator take
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:46.600]  over the meeting vote up a series of demands and again I just cancel student
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:51.120]  loans 1% Wall Street sales tax stop all foreclosures foreclosures for five
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.840]  years no cuts in the social safety net no genocide against the American people
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:02.080]  nationalized the Federal Reserve go for blocks of 1 trillion of 0% federal
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.440]  credit with maturities of 50 to 100 years rebuild the country road rail
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:10.880]  water energy public building schools hospitals in the entire thing Webster
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.920]  the derivatives jobs fight because now you go in there and get that voted you
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:19.960]  get on TV in other words the reason that you see Limbaugh Hannity these
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.360]  characters there they say oh they're dirty they're all this stuff yeah I
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.680]  suppose they are but that's a void in other words as long as you have a
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:32.800]  programmatic void these these parrots of Rupert Murdoch will be able to fill in
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.320]  the blank right they can define you when you have actual demands then you force
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:41.160]  people to talk about your demands and that's what you want to do yeah I'm
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.880]  sure that's true but but I want to know what you have to say about the
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:51.000]  derivatives I say I say ban some tax the rest get them out of existence this is
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.200]  this is precisely where the where the depression comes from under the New
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:59.360]  Deal derivatives were illegal they were banned they were Leavenworth material
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:05.600]  from 1936 to 1982 under the Commodity Exchange Act they were simply illegal
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:11.880]  Reagan under you know Milton Friedman and Austrian auspices said let's bring
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:16.160]  them back they were so smelly it took 20 years the job was completed by by
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:22.280]  Clinton and and Ruben and that is the one and a half a 1.5 quadrillion to 2
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.800]  quadrillion that's crushing the world economy well what do you do we just had
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:31.600]  a deal today right on Citibank Citibank has to pay 285 million which is a tap on
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:37.360]  the wrist for their collateralized debt obligations the two the two kinds of
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.720]  derivatives that have played the biggest role in this depression of the
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:45.000]  collateralized debt obligations where the news guy the news guys this morning
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.760]  they were saying well they said it was dog do-do yeah said the people who were
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.480]  making them up selling them and then and then shorting them all right so let's
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:58.200]  ban collateralized debt obligations even blank fine of Goldman Sachs when he
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:02.320]  testified in Congress last May said maybe we we shouldn't have them yeah you
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:06.040]  shouldn't have them ban them the other one of course is credit default
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:10.880]  swaps that is what is being used to create the European debt crisis and make
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:16.120]  it much much worse so ban those two kinds and all others fall under the 1%
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:22.040]  Wall Street sales tax Tobin tax very important the nurses union national
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:26.560]  nurses United stands out as the best union in the United States because
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.080]  they're in all of these protests saying tax Wall Street transactions those are
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:36.040]  the nurses they fought the reactionary Schwarzenegger to a standstill in in
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:40.240]  California and now they're out there we're coming back we're coming up on
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:43.760]  the break we'll be back on the other side we want to also get into the
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:48.480]  provocations for war with Iran what's going on there and what's going on with

[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:22.800]  19th 2011 we're on with dr. Webster Tarpley Webster we talked about the occupy
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:29.560]  issues I want to talk now about the drum the beating the drums for war with
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:35.880]  Iran we've seen this phony in my opinion phony assassination plot cooked up and
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:40.840]  now we see the usual suspects trying to take us into war William Crystal among
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.400]  others trying to pressure Obama what do you see on that front well let's look at
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:48.600]  where this story comes from your first of what you're very right to say this is
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:53.080]  this is a complete part for us right this is scraping the bottom of the barrel in
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:57.480]  terms of the scenario department on this one right this character our Bob our
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:02.760]  Bob CR right the failed use car dealer he's a he's a drunk he's a substance
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:07.160]  abuser he's not very bright I think he's mentally impaired either because of too
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:12.960]  much narcotics or or whatever it is so the idea you go to this this group in
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:17.600]  Mexico which is obviously a battleground of every spook agency in the world right
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:23.080]  look at that I guess it is and you try to recruit somebody there again this is
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:27.360]  not how anybody would would do these things and and and even if the Iranians
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:31.320]  say themselves right what's the point why go to Washington to do this when it's
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:35.080]  so much easier to do something similar somewhere else and what are you gaining
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:39.040]  anyway acting out your your rage or whatever it is right the Iran
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:44.680]  Revolutionary Guard a very professional group and obviously this is not this is
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:48.880]  anything but professional but now let's see where this is coming from because I
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:52.800]  heard some funny stories about this who is running the US government right now
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.760]  I don't think it's Obama right the reports we're getting from all kinds of
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:00.920]  sources that the infamous Ulster man or indeed the Washington Post of a week
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:06.720]  ago Saturday that Obama is increasingly withdrawn right he's like Nixon maybe
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:13.000]  paranoid right retreating into the family quarters watching TV sports games not
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.360]  very polite to people who show up sometimes insult them maybe hitting the
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:23.960]  bottle maybe change smoking again who knows but under a lot of anxiety but
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:29.720]  he's tending towards the dropping out he he thrives on adulation and adulation
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:33.440]  is not so easy to come by now so who's running the government I would say it's
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:37.720]  the principles committee the principles committee right now is composed of
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:42.760]  Hillary Clinton Leon Panetta now as Secretary of Defense General David
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:47.320]  Petraeus of the CIA Donald on this is Tom Donald on the head of the National
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:53.480]  Security Council and Eric Holder this multi-malifactor who's the head of the
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:58.320]  Justice Department and if you look at that group I would say the likely source
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:03.840]  of this Iranian story is Petraeus in other words the author of this is Petraeus
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:09.640]  not the civilian government but Petraeus who unites now in a personal union we
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:17.600]  might say the Pentagon with the CIA and let's just look back he came to power in
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:21.960]  the CIA on September 6th and September 6th what have we had since then we've
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:28.440]  had three big big false flag type stunts we had the special alert over the 911
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:32.640]  weekend you go back and look Petraeus arrives at the CIA and the call goes out
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:38.240]  special alert I think two days later then we had this amazing story which is
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:44.120]  attributed to to the outgoing admiral there at the Joint Chiefs of Staff right
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:48.400]  but it's really Petraeus Petraeus is the one who delivered this story to the
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:54.160]  Pakistanis he called in the head of the ISI of Pakistan and said you are
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:58.720]  supporting terrorism you are supporting the Haqqani network you're no good and
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:05.000]  that has created a tremendous wave of acrimony hatred and possible war right
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.400]  we get we're constantly getting stories that there are shooting incidents
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:13.160]  between US forces and Pakistani forces on different sides of the Afghani
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:18.840]  Pakistan border and then within the first month still of his tenure at the CIA we
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:26.520]  then get the this unbelievable Iran story so I would warn I've heard
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:31.680]  various people saying oh this is the work of bungling civilians and we need
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:35.200]  somebody like general Petraeus because we're praying that he's competent well
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:41.000]  yes again Petraeus is the number one bonapartist and of course what I mean by
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.960]  that is somebody who wants to have a military dictatorship the term comes
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:49.960]  from Napoleon right coined after Napoleon Bonaparte a general who becomes
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.840]  a dictator and then much much more Petraeus is I think he's up to his neck
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:58.480]  in this and I would say in terms of these personalities he's probably the
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:01.920]  dominant one on this principles committee so they may have already been a
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.840]  coup behind the scenes where they keep Obama as a figurehead and this
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.200]  principles committee runs the government and Petraeus well think of somebody like
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:14.280]  Field Marshall von Hindenburg becoming president of Germany after World War
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:19.880]  I very bad results right he was not Hitler but he brought in Hitler so some
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:25.600]  something like this now why do they do this now we're gonna hold off here we're
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:29.200]  gonna keep you to the other side bring you into the next segment as well of

[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:08.280]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double

[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:20.360]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:24.640]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.800]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:33.080]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:36.800]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:36.360]  now we are still with Webster Tarpley and we were breaking down the CIA
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:42.480]  manufactured tensions with Iran Webster where do we go from here with the Iran
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:47.360]  situation well I think they're there are a couple of things working in the
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:51.720]  background one specifically if this is an attempt to intervene into Iran right
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:57.320]  there's this ongoing fight between Ahmadinejad and the president of the
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:03.400]  country and Kamenai right the the head of the Mullah Ki right the
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:08.840]  spiritual leader and you can see the US is trying to intervene in favor of the
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:12.840]  Mullahs they Hillary Clinton has said this right we want to have an Islamic
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:18.760]  Republic well and in the sense of a Mullah Ki they fear and hate Ahmadinejad
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:22.960]  because he represents the military industrial complex he's a military man
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:27.560]  he's a modernizer he's interested in science he's interested in scientific
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:31.040]  research and all the other things that actually make a country strong and
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:35.160]  indeed nuclear energy which is an indispensable part of being a strong
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:38.680]  independent country so you can see that they're trying to skew the outcome of
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:44.480]  that in favor of the of the Mullahs and against and against the the president
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:48.320]  the the other part of the background is the Anglo-Americans are not happy
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:51.440]  campers these days I think a number of things are going very wrong for them
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:55.200]  number one Putin is back Putin is back stronger than ever
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:59.320]  Medvedev is out I think if we'd had if we'd had Putin here all the time we
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:02.520]  probably wouldn't have had the Libya war at least in the in the way that it
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:08.080]  happened Putin is not only back but he's back without Kudrin and Kudrin was
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:13.040]  precisely the free market reformer the stooge of the International Monetary
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:18.000]  Fund the World Bank the European Central Bank and all the rest of them so
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.400]  Kudrin who's the really the last of the leftovers from the shock therapy
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:26.520]  era when the IMF came into Russia and wrecked them using free market
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:31.360]  deregulation privatization union busting all that stuff he's now out so
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:37.120]  Putin is back to some extent at least of his weakest side the other thing is the
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:40.960]  destabilization of Syria is going nowhere notice that we had this
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:45.560]  interesting I think a good wonderful moment in the UN when China and Russia
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:51.400]  voted to veto the US proposal which was to begin essentially civil war and
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:57.440]  bombing in Syria and that was done that's thanks to Putin again Putin stood up
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:02.520]  and said no in effect and the Chinese then had the guts to do the same thing
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:06.600]  the other thing is Libya and that's going too well right Colonel Gaddafi and
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:11.160]  his entire family leadership team and so forth this is all still intact it's
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:17.760]  now been two months since the big NATO attack on on on the Tripoli and the
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:22.360]  fighting still goes on in Sirta in Bani Walid and in in Sabah and other places
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:28.000]  in the south of Libya so there's going to be a long civil war and the these NATO
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.080]  agents right the Al Qaeda terrorist council they're fighting among themselves
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:36.720]  one of the top ones Jabril Hillary Clinton's boyfriend says that he's
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:40.600]  going to quit as soon as they finish the military part well don't don't hold
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:44.640]  your breath on that I would like to recommend to people it's clear now that
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:48.920]  Obama is a total warmonger in case there was any doubt about this right we've
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:55.360]  got seven wars we've got Afghanistan Iraq Pakistan Somalia Libya Yemen and
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:59.440]  now as you've said we've added Uganda which is really more in Central African
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:04.240]  Republic we're up to seven was easily and maybe eight or nine and the Uganda
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:07.760]  operations in four different countries and that's what I mean if that's in
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:12.600]  theory it's it can expand from there so we know seven and counting or you know
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:16.480]  you want to count those four I guess we're up to ten there may be a cyber
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:22.120]  war with China makes 11 look for people on the center left of the spectrum which
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:26.640]  is about 75% of the United States by most polls in terms of content what
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:32.680]  you're for primary Obama now primary Obama now calm this is a website where
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:38.280]  you can go and vote you can say I'm sick of Obama I want somebody else there's
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:42.160]  a list of people some of the some of the good ones like Marcy captor in the
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.600]  House of Representatives doing things to fight foreclosures and other stuff you
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:49.980]  can go through the list right and if you want somebody added you can also
[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:54.800]  propose that there's a way you can you can send that in so primary Obama now
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:38:01.080]  calm primary Obama now calm and let that go viral is a couple of weeks left
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:05.840]  right November 1st is the deadline for filing in the Democratic primary in
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:09.480]  New Hampshire and other other deadlines are now coming up so this is basically
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:15.840]  the last chance to get somebody in the field against this warmonger Obama and
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:20.240]  I would say the Democratic Party doesn't do that they they may be clinically dead
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:25.440]  that may be the end of them yeah but as far as the actual Africa situation you
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:29.440]  predicted or outlined which direction so many so much of this was going to go
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:34.720]  with the AFRICOM mechanism that was put in place can you break down some of that
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:39.160]  Webster what I what I argued in Obama the postmodern coup the making of a
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:44.320]  manchurian candidate published first in April of 2008 and in the middle of the
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:49.440]  primaries was that with Obama Africa would become a battle between the United
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:53.760]  States and China and the idea is always China is present in these countries
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:58.080]  because they want oil raw materials they they were getting oil from Libya no
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:03.520]  more they were getting raw materials from Zimbabwe man I'm trying to bring it
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:09.680]  into that by overthrowing Mugabe on the NATO side Gaddafi's big big sin from
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:13.360]  their point of view was he was one of the few African countries that refused to
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:18.800]  become a part of US African command US AFRICOM I think still in the US
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:24.720]  I think still in in Stuttgart so when you look at Libya right remember that
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:30.200]  Libya is not just Libya Libya was also really the only fairly advanced country
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:34.120]  and it was at more advanced than many countries in Europe in Eastern Europe
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:40.600]  but anyway they had the development projects going in Mali in Chad lots of
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:45.520]  other places a big presence in that belt the Sahel right on the sort of the
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:50.080]  southern side of the of the Sahara and that's what we're talking about now
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:53.600]  we're talking about Uganda and the Central African Republic and and the
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:40:00.320]  other ones including Congo right Congo well the big Congo right not the
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:07.200]  little one so all of these areas are areas of Chinese commercial penetration
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:12.440]  and since the US under the current economic system cannot compete in terms
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:17.320]  of economics they they choose to fall back on military aggression of course
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:21.240]  this this doesn't work the other thing that when you're in Uganda the special
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:25.680]  D of Uganda as I learned visiting southern Sudan some years ago that's
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:31.720]  where you destabilize southern Sudan which has now been detached if you saw
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:36.680]  this character Pat Buchanan this this reactionary writer he's been pushing his
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:40.200]  new book and he says oh look all these countries are falling apart all these
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:44.040]  countries are falling apart yeah who's wrecking them who's who's tearing them
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:48.440]  apart the US the British and the Israelis are the ones who who fomented
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.680]  the split of Sudan into two parts especially the British who have been
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:55.000]  trying to do that for a hundred and twenty years they finally did it so now
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:00.040]  there's South Sudan so with Uganda as a military base you can strike right
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:03.040]  across the border into South Sudan although they don't mention that one
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:09.280]  Congo and then over Central African Republic and indeed any others it is
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:14.520]  also you get the idea that Obama maybe he's the Obama the regime is trying to
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:18.400]  compete with the French because this is typically a French sphere so the idea is
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:23.400]  that if Gaddafi is for the moment focused on on the guerrilla war and civil
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:27.360]  war in Libya a space opens up so they want to go in and do that now of course
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:30.840]  this is absolutely insane right this doesn't help the United States this is
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:36.280]  this is another recipe for disaster but notice the difference is that Bush
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:40.440]  would have gone on television with some kind of a blustering warmonger brutal
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:45.400]  imperialist speech and Obama basically says nothing he pretends it's not
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:50.120]  happening right it might interfere with his election year demagogy so this is
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:54.360]  where we are and the answer to that once again is political primary Obama now
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:59.880]  dot com get him out dump him in 2012 he is the new Carter there's no doubt he's
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:04.320]  he cratered exactly at the same time as Carter 30 months into the term that was
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:09.720]  July 1979 for Carter with the malaise speech and firing the cabinet and for
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:15.920]  Obama it was his failure to invoke the 14th Amendment and stop that that crazy
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:21.240]  race to default which then gave the the financiers acting through standard and
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:25.480]  pours the chance to downgrade the United States and those agencies are still on a
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:28.680]  rampage around the world right they haven't stopped and somebody's gonna
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:35.080]  have to let them see the inside of a jail cell in order to stop that does it
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:37.880]  look to you like they're gonna be able to contain these various countries
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:42.440]  through these smaller coups or does it look like a wider world war is kicking
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:47.920]  off will he actually bite off on Iran as they're sort of gearing up to do again
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:53.120]  Webster are we gonna see another false flag attack look all of this is
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:57.280]  possible right you got to have maximum vigilance on this my reading of what
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:02.400]  they're doing with Iran right now is they're trying to skew this faction
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:07.560]  fight in favor of the supreme leader and against Ahmadinejad because
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:12.480]  Ahmadinejad is the modernizer the military guy he's basically a new
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:18.880]  Nasser with a with an overlay of Islamic doctrine which is sort of what
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:24.400]  belongs to our our times for good or for ill there it is so the ones that the
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:28.600]  US and the British have always hated and feared other people in the tradition of
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:34.200]  colonel master of Egypt that would be in various ways like distorted though they
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:40.400]  be the Assad in Syria Gaddafi you can look at Chavez of Venezuela they will
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:44.760]  they all start off as colonels right middle-level officer so Ahmadinejad
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:49.600]  the same thing they want to get rid of him but then you know under under
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:53.720]  conditions of a breakdown crisis things get out of control you can look at the
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:44:00.520]  the border between Turkey and and Syria this constant grave danger that in
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:05.440]  order to save the failed Syria destabilization NATO will finally convince
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:10.120]  Turkey or or blackmail Turkey or whatever they do to cross the border into
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:15.760]  Syria and help the democratic forces now the democratic forces in Syria are the
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:19.960]  death squads of the Muslim Brotherhood that's who's doing these things there
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:23.640]  these are al-Qaeda terrorists these are fighters that have been brought in from
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:28.560]  Afghanistan and God knows where so far Turkey has not done that I see Turkey has
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:34.400]  just made a move into northern Iraq to fight the Kurds which I think for them
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:40.680]  is more realistic but if Turkey attacks Syria that could then blow the lid off
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:44.160]  the whole thing because if you attack Syria it's the same as attacking Iran
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:49.400]  and then you get the big regional war and then then then the missiles go up
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:54.880]  and I mean you know these these hundreds and thousands of smaller conventionally
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:45:00.800]  on ballistic missiles may be with various other things on top
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:05.640]  all right well thanks for joining us Webster we're gonna let you go right
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:10.520]  now and coming up on the other side we have Alan Watt joining us to give his
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:15.440]  breakdown of how they steer and control these revolutions just want to mention
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:19.560]  that Ron Paul has been the one candidate willing to bring up that this
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:23.480]  Iranian assassination plot is false I don't know if we have that clip he was
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:29.000]  also in the debates last night bowding against Herman Cain total Federal
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.420]  Reserve stooge about how he's been blaming the victims saying that they
[01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:39.000]  occupy Wall Street crowd it's their fault if they're not rich instead Ron
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.280]  Paul says why don't they direct the protests at the Federal Reserve guys do
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:49.160]  we have that clip now of Ron Paul talking about the phony Iranian plot with
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:55.240]  Wolf Blitzer is running he's just on beta unveiled a huge plan of his own
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:59.360]  congressman thanks very much for coming in so let's talk a little bit about your
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:02.360]  jobs proposal we heard a little bit from the president of the United States he's
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:06.480]  got his ideas yours is the most revolutionary shall we say you want to
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:12.240]  cut one trillion dollars in spending over how long over three years but the
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:15.600]  first year is one trillion bounce budget in three years so cut a trillion the
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:19.840]  first year first year and you want to do that by eliminating one two three four
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:26.040]  five cabinet positions right right the problem we have is I think the radicals
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:29.120]  have been in charge the people who believe in spending and deficits don't
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:33.320]  matter and we can be any place in the world you can print up money forever and
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:37.120]  they've been doing this for about 40 years so this is an inevitable problem
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:41.800]  that we have today and yet I think the country people are waking up people in
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:46.120]  Washington the bureau you know the bureaucrats and and the other politicians
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:51.160]  the other candidates running for this office I think I think they're living
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:54.280]  in a different world because that plan is pretty radical let's take a look at
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:58.040]  this you would cut and correct me if I'm wrong the Department of Energy a hundred
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:02.360]  thousand jobs right there Department of Education 4200 jobs Department of
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:07.480]  Commerce 38,000 jobs Department of Interior 70,000 jobs Department of
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:12.960]  Housing and Urban Development 9,000 jobs that's 221,000 government jobs you
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:16.760]  would seek to eliminate over three years but they're not they're non-productive so
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:19.720]  they go back in and they're non-productive productive they're not
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:23.280]  productive jobs you have these jobs these people have worked in these jobs they
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:26.800]  think I'm pretty pretty I know but when government spends your money they don't
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:30.840]  spend it as wisely as you do you spend it more diligently and smartly and
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:34.000]  investments are much better so governments aren't smart enough for example
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.560]  the Department of Energy all of America's nuclear power is related to the
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:42.800]  stop it right there and that's Ron Paul breaking down his specific economic
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:48.120]  plan to slash various departments and cut trillions from the budget all the
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:53.080]  other GOP candidates have proposed maybe tens of billions of dollars of cuts at
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:57.840]  best if they even follow through with those plans no one else is even serious
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:02.440]  here and yet the media of course continues to ignore Ron Paul and another
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:06.280]  gutsy thing he brought up that was trying to have them originally cue we're
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:10.480]  going to find that right now about how the Iranian plot was false the
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:14.080]  assassination plot let's cue that up or how there's no evidence how high the
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:17.440]  highest levels that they said was seeking to assassinate the Saudi
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:21.280]  ambassador in Washington if you were president and that report came to you
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:25.440]  from your CIA your Justice Department your FBI what would you do about that I'd
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:29.640]  check it very carefully for the facts because now the facts are are filling out
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:32.760]  they've arrested and that's fine these could be a very dangerous person maybe
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:36.080]  he'll get a day in court but I predict they won't because I think I don't
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:40.040]  think they have much concrete evidence at least he's captured easy in a court
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:45.520]  and there's going to do it because various Republicans and Democrats
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:48.960]  Mike Rogers the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee you know he
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:53.800]  believes that these these the evidence is strong Diane Feinstein I think it's
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:57.160]  mostly war propaganda they've been itching to go to war against Iran for a
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:01.440]  long long time this is exactly what they did leading up to the war in Iraq and
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:07.160]  the danger was not there I don't think the Iranians are that stupid and and yet
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:10.600]  the people here right now are getting pretty excited about you see people
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:15.640]  giving us this this information gave us fast and furious why they don't they're
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:19.720]  having investigations in Washington fast and furious is a fraud but all of a
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:23.440]  sudden they believe this no the same people are telling the same thing they
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:26.880]  need to look at it very carefully as president I would look at this type of
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:31.320]  intelligence very carefully I certainly wouldn't advocate going into another war
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:35.480]  these people are using this this one episode possibility of this one guy
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:39.200]  doing something with a distinct operation we don't know people are
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:42.800]  suggesting we go to war over there just what that is such a careless attitude
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:45.600]  make sure you're what I heard you're right you said these allegations are
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:51.040]  war propaganda on the part of the Obama administration I think you see no the
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:54.720]  people who are jumping up and down on say well this is wonderful wonderful it's
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:58.640]  all the way up to the top yes I think people who are suggesting that this is
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:03.840]  a okay and that is wrong Paul calling out the war propaganda trying to take us
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:09.600]  into conflict with Iran as those tensions gear up he joins all the other
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:14.400]  intelligence analysis such as Ray McGovern Steve Pachesnik and Lieutenant
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:18.840]  Colonel Anthony Schaefer who've all spoken out and called out this plot is
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:23.440]  totally dubious of course the papers openly admit it was yet another sting
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:28.400]  operation there's been dozens of them all the so-called major al-Qaeda plots have
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:33.680]  been nothing more than setups usually with unwitting dupes maybe not good

[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:08.680]  do that a few more headlines Kurt Nemo has written that Occupy Wall Street calls
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:12.960]  for global governments prior to worldwide Occupy Wall Street inspired
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:17.480]  protests on October 15th a group of prominent leftists issued a manifesto
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:22.600]  that includes a strong call for global democracy and in particular democratic
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:28.480]  rule over international finance system reports UNPA campaign that is the
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:33.120]  establishment of United Nations Parliamentary Assembly a global network
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:38.360]  of parliamentarians so there you have people pushing for basically greater
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:43.280]  global governance you've had the Soros people not only backing and supporting
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:47.560]  and sort of steering the Occupy Wall Street crowd but not too long ago
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:52.440]  converging the Bretton Woods to meeting to try to steer which way global
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:57.480]  finance will go after the next crash you've also got Steve Watson expanding
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:02.440]  on federal records that show Romney campaign is bought and paid for by the
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:06.960]  big banks that it is Romney this time around who is Wall Street supported of
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:12.560]  course in 2008 it was overwhelmingly Barack Obama and he continues to serve
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:18.320]  them I'm sure I do agree with Webster's analysis that it's basically the shadow
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:22.520]  networks the black ops people behind it who are steering Barack Obama and
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:26.440]  plenty of other puppet presidents I really personally think that's been
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:31.960]  going on since the establishment of the National Security Act in 1947 Truman the
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:36.360]  very man who said the buck stops here certainly did not run things and neither
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:40.400]  have most of these other presidents and you saw what happened to people like JFK
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:45.280]  and others who stuck their neck out and tried to even fight part of what's going
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:51.720]  on now we want to talk again about the US Hawks behind the Iraq War now rallying
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:56.440]  for strikes against Iran leading the charge is the foreign policy initiative
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:01.320]  the ideological successor to the project for a new American Century the
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:05.760]  familiar players from the Bush administration William Crystal also
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:10.160]  editor of the weekly standard has said that the alleged plot amounts to an
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:16.600]  engraved invitation by Tehran to use force against Iran the very plot that's
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:20.520]  so dubious that it wasn't even in the Justice Department files
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:24.680]  according to intelligence analysis who've blown the whistle the very plot
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:29.280]  that was admittedly a sting of really a low-level used car salesmen who happen
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:34.360]  to be Iranian American obviously involved in some dark shadowy stuff now
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:38.520]  may be the kind of issue that takes us to war with Iran let's really hope not
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:43.720]  he's now pressuring President Obama to bomb Iran and try to set back the
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:49.040]  Iranian Revolutionary Guard as well as to weaken the regime's nuclear weapons
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:54.280]  program just as Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton did respectively in Libya in
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:58:01.120]  1986 and Iraq in 1993 just more alarming news and of course we covered
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:11.680]  earlier something that is now buried in my stack and that is to do well we'll
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:15.840]  get to that on the other side Alan Watt joining us with his analysis on the
[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:20.040]  Occupy Wall Street movement the push for Iran and the larger global system that

[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:41.040]  erin dyke sitting in until alex is back tomorrow but we are now joined by alan
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:45.600]  watt he's a long-term researcher of really the true causes behind the
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:50.680]  various global changes going on and really has a sharp analysis of the
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:56.360]  unifying agenda behind it all he's also a bit of a Renaissance man he's done
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:03.480]  music poetry philosophy written books and many other items alan thanks for
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:09.880]  joining us and welcome to the program yes pleasure to be back now alan we've
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:14.400]  seen so much happening with the occupy wall street movement itself in many
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:18.520]  ways a diverse group we've seen even many protesters targeting the federal
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:23.800]  reserve and other sort of heart of the beast systems but at the same time we've
[02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:28.360]  seen left-leaning democratic factions trying to absorb that energy trying to
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:32.400]  steer it back into the left-right paradigm of the main establishment just
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:36.840]  as it happened with the tea party so we wanted to today really have you break
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:40.680]  down how they trigger revolutions how they steer them how they see them coming
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:46.560]  and how they help direct what the eventual outcome will be
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:53.640]  well it's all to do with geopolitics and our world agenda plan the gender
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:59.080]  a planned a long time ago and many of the big leaders over the years have gone
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:05.400]  through this agenda they've published books on it both I think tanks they
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:10.720]  have openly declared their objectives we find that they never sleep by the way
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:14.080]  they never sleep at 24 hours per day because they have shifts in the big
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:19.040]  thing tanks and they work full-time on being a system of government for the
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:25.600]  world and it's the age actually to call this the age of world managers and we
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:29.880]  have been managed for quite some time as you privatize everything off and this
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:34.800]  semi this is kind of public private private partnership deal and the system
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:38.680]  going into now is in the transformation into the culmination of a
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:43.680]  worldwide system under really the United Nations and that's what I'm calling for
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:49.200]  now you'll notice to the coin for world governance and to be under and actually
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:53.040]  officially under the United Nations which actually technically it is because all
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:56.320]  laws been coming through the United Nations for an awful lot of years across
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:03:01.240]  the whole world right down to your building codes so we're simply going
[02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:07.560]  into the transformation phases right now too it's like wars these massive
[02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:13.200]  demonstrations have the same effect as a war it changes society understand the
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:16.200]  most most of the general public are passive viewers that they're not
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:21.920]  participants in anything and to change society and to get them to go along with
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:26.640]  it you must convince everyone of the necessity of it either through warfare
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:29.240]  or because of gross dissatisfaction amongst
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:34.360]  map that appears to be on television massive factions of society because it's
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:38.200]  them that you have to convince for the changes that are coming in and believe
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:41.640]  you me this is all part of the self-power technique that Brazinski and
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:46.600]  Kissinger and United Nations and many other think tanks have been using for
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:51.160]  years they always start off with with soft power they've said that the Middle
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:56.480]  East they would use soft power and sometimes increasing into hard military
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:01.800]  power when required which we've watched over the last year or two so it's our
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:05.360]  turn now to go through the same transformation into the planned
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:09.440]  society the big bankers at the top the ones who are international money
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:14.440]  lenders have always used geopolitics they don't sit and wait for something to
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:18.800]  happen in the future they plan the future and they favor what's called
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:23.360]  socialism because it's big government and big government always borrows from
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:28.600]  them and big government also can keep tabs on the general public and keep them
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:33.200]  under control when necessary the trick in the government is to bring in
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:37.480]  socialism and make the people think it's actually theirs for the first time
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:43.360]  it's a favorite just a kinder etc etc the stuff that Tony Blair used to spout
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:48.440]  out as he was taught to do so well by his trainers as well so you're seeing it
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:52.680]  happening in America too because it's a global system okay I'll hold that thought

[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:50.600]  cancer cures and some of the hospitals that are carrying them out rather than
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:55.520]  chemotherapy we're gonna cover debate highlights and many other items from the
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:59.600]  breaking news but right now we are joined by Alan Watt really one of the
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:06.040]  most well-researched and deeply understood people who have analyzed what's
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:10.880]  going on in the global system behind what seems to be unrelated events going
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:15.520]  on in the world now Alan we have the planned economic crisis they knew it
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:19.280]  was coming they hedged their bets against it after abusing the system for
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:23.600]  decades and now the sort of this righteous anger that's brewed up first in
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:27.400]  the Middle East in various parts of Europe and now it's hitting home in
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:31.920]  America help us understand what has been going on behind the scenes of all
[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:37.400]  this well what you've had for years actually under the guise of again public
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:43.000]  private partnerships are really just a monopoly conglomerates of people into
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:48.120]  energy thinking the energy resources of the world remember to the council and
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:52.680]  foreign relations for an example and the Royal Institute of international affairs
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:56.680]  had their roots in the Milner group it was called the time international
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:01.720]  financiers these guys lent to nations and it created this organization and their
[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:06.480]  plan was to take over all the resources of the world all energy all resources
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:10.600]  food water and everything you need to put to live basically and bring in a
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:15.320]  planned world system like an economy which would be worldwide using a
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:21.640]  socialist type system to control the populace of the entire globe these are
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:26.040]  the guys who designed the free trade deals they wanted to all the buyers
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:29.520]  brought down of course they wouldn't lose money for the nations in the meantime
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:32.960]  because it would replace it with a value-added tax or in the case of Canada
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:38.080]  a general sales tax and and at the same time they would do it with borders
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:42.960]  gradually and split the world into regions and had a free flow of goods and
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:48.600]  labor and therefore multicultural multiculturalism was a big big part of
[02:10:48.600 --> 02:10:54.280]  their agenda too and so the guy who was the Tony Blair's right-hand man and
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:58.200]  the device next prime minister basically admitted that in the British
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:04.120]  newspapers the Blair had told him that the agenda was to completely open the
[02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:08.360]  floodgates to Britain to the most diverse cultures in order to destroy the
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:13.000]  culture of Britain forever that was to go by the wayside that ties in with the
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:17.640]  educational system the Frankfurt school John Dewey John Dewey said
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:22.360]  eventually will eradicate all conflicting history for people had old
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:27.200]  grievances with neighbors etc that's already been done actually under the
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:31.160]  European Union they're eliminating history prior to the world war one
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:37.400]  basically and the start was close now nothing happened before it's like it's
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:42.440]  like in Cambodia when they started off with the year one when it took over it's
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:45.480]  very very similar so we're seeing a new world order and this is what it's all
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:51.120]  about it's a world order where only a few big international corporations own
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:55.960]  supplies of the world are still going after the last part of the resources the
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:01.480]  at the gas again that for instance is on the world's largest oil and tap oil
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:06.480]  fields and underneath there plus cobalt and gas natural gas as well which they
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:10.560]  want for this East African Federation and that's why that's so strategically
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:15.960]  important to to get in there and get them conquered as well so it's all about
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:21.440]  resources because these points at the top plan this world's planned economy
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:26.680]  plan society right down to how many how many people will be allowed to have
[02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:32.600]  children etc and they use China as the model state to copy one one child per
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:37.920]  parent or parents depending on how you look at it today etc and also they want
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:42.000]  to plan you from birth to death what you will do what your work can't be tested
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:46.200]  scientifically for your abilities and it be school to work only more perfected
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:51.600]  it's a more perfected version of the laboratory that was the Soviet Union
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:56.960]  which they also funded the same big big international organizations so we're
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:00.200]  going through the same thing here and they must convince the Americans at
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:04.920]  home that it's necessary that we have this particular change and that's what
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:09.840]  the hype was about in the last century in academia because academia was brought
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:16.400]  on board very early on the council in foreign relations Lord veteran Russell
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:19.960]  all the big boys who helped plan this present time we're living in right now
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:24.200]  and the cultures that we're going through the changes these guys said we
[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:28.880]  bring academia on board because they will train the future world managers so
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:32.160]  forget the ones beneath them they're working class go for the man jewels
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:37.960]  classes and they'll be on board with us but they've done that in academia in
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:43.160]  cahoots with this new expert driven world governance will run your life in a
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:48.160]  scientific fashion a scientific dictatorship actually was called by the
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:54.440]  first United Nations UNESCO CEO and that was Huxley's brother Julian Huxley so
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:58.400]  this is what we're going through now the big changes towards their goal and to
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:03.640]  a planned economy and they're even using energy which was planned back in the
[02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:10.320]  1920s 1930s under technocracy Inc. it was a new theory put up by the same boys by
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:14.620]  the way councilor foreign relations and the Royal Institute of international
[02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:19.360]  affairs to take over the world's energy supplies and really all money was was a
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:24.720]  unit that they would use against the value of energy units and eventually
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:28.960]  they'd be replaced by energy units so we have carbon taxes carbon units coming
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:33.280]  in right now and eventually there will be how much it costs and energy units to
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:37.800]  keep you as an individual alive alive so this is the actual whole
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:42.880]  conglomerate of the Fabian society which was just a left-wing part of the
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:46.480]  Royal Institute of international affairs backed by multi billionaires I mean
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:52.200]  the Aster family helped to kick it off and fund it and the big bankers of
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:55.920]  course creating the Royal Institute of international affairs and the councilor
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:59.800]  foreign relations and they have branches across the entire planet and George
[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:04.520]  Soros in fact is the CEO of the Europe for the one for the whole of the European
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:09.160]  Parliament group he's the head of that so sustained organization across the
[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:13.240]  world government India in Africa all Australia all the British
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:17.440]  Commonwealth countries other memberships and this is the planned system
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:20.800]  that's taking them over a hundred years to achieve we're going through parts of
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:24.800]  the stages right now yeah I really had to back you up wouldn't you trace the
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:29.080]  history of anyone for example the Rockefeller Foundation it's hard to
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:33.240]  find where they deviate from that Cecil Rhodes roundtable group that have
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:37.600]  steered off into so many of the entities you mentioned but help bring us up to
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:42.000]  speed of how they saw the current revolutions coming and how they've
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.320]  prepared for it and where they plan to take it as part of their larger world
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:49.040]  government takeover well the number one they always know is going to get
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:53.400]  backlash whenever they do something but there's a plan it's a corporation
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:59.400]  called cooperation and backlash because they remember these guys run the big
[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:03.320]  far-left groups they run and finance them in fact your own governments have
[02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:08.440]  been financing them for last 50 years the same organizations they'll get tax
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:14.480]  funded and foundation funded so this is the ones that they simply dropped out on
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:20.800]  Q to bring in a just a fairer globalism actually if you look at most of these
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:24.400]  protesters it isn't just about America in fact America's at the bottom of the
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:29.760]  list it's about a favor globalism and a world's governance under the United
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:36.000]  Nations for all workers of the world etc etc I understand to the strategy of
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.600]  their owners because those who own the world basically must keep the working
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:43.800]  classes under control and make them think they're going to get something out of
[02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:48.600]  this which is like the Soviet system to be made they always make sure that you
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:53.040]  think you can get something out of it for yourselves a just a fair kinder
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:57.200]  society but in reality that the world is planned to go under
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:02.520]  communitarianism Britain is the flagship as you know you have these NGOs
[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:08.080]  already created they're coming in as and just appointing themselves as leaders
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:14.440]  of your communities ones for energy consumption ones for if wastage disposal
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:19.600]  you've got NGO leaders for environmental for your area they just
[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:24.400]  happen to be there they're already trained and this is the perfect Soviet
[02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:30.960]  Soviet met ruled by councils and councils in the Soviet Union were non
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:36.280]  governmental organizations and of course their leaders were appointed by the KGB
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:41.840]  and the Politburo and in the West they're appointed again by the shadow
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:45.720]  government as it is you make call it that so the same system only more
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:51.640]  perfected than that's what the actually calling it in some quarters yeah it's
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:56.360]  amazing in the same group that creates the crisis of course typically brings
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:18:03.360]  the solution that's the whole formula at hand so how do they how do they predict
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:06.800]  the timing of these kind of they see these revolutions coming and happen with
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:10.440]  the Arab Spring but they know we know it's something they were developing for
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:15.840]  years Alan yes absolutely they've been working on Africa for an awful long time
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:22.280]  and Mandela is in it too he's part of he wants an African Union and of course
[02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:26.120]  what they've really decided to do is initially started off with regional parts
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:31.320]  of Africa unions for each one of them the United Nations is heavily involved in
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:35.800]  fact all of the Western counselors and bureaucracies are heavily involved too
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:40.080]  setting up the State Department's heavily involved too so they want these regions
[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:47.000]  and it's all again to do with free trade allowing the big mega corporations in to
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:51.080]  take control of all energy that and mineral resources everything they can
[02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:54.520]  get out of those countries under the guise of sharing it to the world the
[02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:58.240]  wealth of the world etc they've released itself to pass through the masters of
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:02.200]  the world who already own the wealth of the world and really consolidate their
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:08.520]  power over all all goods etc all all necessities of life and all they have to
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:12.480]  do in the meantime is knock down the petty dictators they've already put in
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:17.040]  for a certain phase that who have now set their purpose and are getting too
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:21.000]  comfortable in their seats they don't really want to part and leave the throne
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:28.080]  and into a no more open society so they simply get rid of them instead actually
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:31.520]  the wars are very very good for that because the thing accomplished so much
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:36.120]  in time of war but when you go into the Middle Eastern situation it was very
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:40.400]  interesting that years ago Kissinger and Brzezinski when they were asked their

[02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:06.720]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:10.520]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:14.880]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:19.240]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:23.680]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:28.440]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:32.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:35.880]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:40.200]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:43.360]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:47.040]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:27.720]  Alan Watt is our guest here in the third hour I am Aaron Dyke sitting in until
[02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:33.080]  Alex returns tomorrow with a powerful broadcast but you also want to check out
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:37.000]  the Info Wars nightly news again tonight we have some very special reports
[02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:41.880]  prepared but Alan you were just getting into some of the factors in the Middle
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:46.920]  East bringing up Brzezinski and Kissinger if you could please continue yeah
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:51.720]  the the agenda for the Middle East was complete destabilization they wanted to
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:56.720]  destabilize the countries and makes it easier for the big boys to go in which
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:02.400]  they did of course smash the infrastructure get the taxpayers of
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:07.560]  America and Britain elsewhere to build brand new refineries to settle ones were
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:12.040]  inadequate and we did in any auction the more actually they gave them away to the
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:16.720]  big corporations that was published in mainstream so it's much easier to have
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:22.440]  control in an area when a technically is destabilized because you can bribe the
[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:26.520]  local little gangs that farm or sides that farm when you when you break up
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:30.880]  especially most ones against different sections different factions and that's
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:35.160]  exactly what to Kissinger and Brzezinski said they'd like to do long term
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:39.000]  destabilization and that with that way the big corporations with private
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:43.320]  armies can can basically draw the oil and an excess excess stuff out of there
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:47.280]  for free basically very little money at all first if you have a strong
[02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:50.840]  government to deal with you have to go through regular channels and pay a good
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:55.680]  a good rate of return etc for the oil so that that's happened and don't keep it
[02:25:55.680 --> 02:26:00.640]  destabilized for an awful long time and also to have actually said that the
[02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:04.240]  Council on Foreign Relations they must keep that whole region safe for Israel
[02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:08.640]  that's a big big part of it it's out in the open to keep it safe for Israel
[02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:12.640]  there will be no other superpower in that area and we see the same thing with
[02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:17.560]  with Egypt one of the prime ministers of Israel said years ago he said if we can
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:22.720]  get Egypt then that's the jewel that's the jewel that they were after that be
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:26.160]  the jewel in the crown basically like getting Egypt control of each very
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:30.880]  strategic point for them as well and so the chief goal after goal after goal
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:35.600]  with cooperation from the US and the military and doing all the work and
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:41.440]  being all the cash for it basically so there's different geopolitical strategy
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:45.000]  but the main thing is to keep them destabilized for an awful long time to
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:50.320]  come almost into a third-role status in many cases and that's what we see
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:55.160]  happening right now yeah and obviously for a power that doesn't belong in the
[02:26:55.160 --> 02:26:59.680]  region to project its force you have to kind of implement destabilization get
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:03.520]  the different factions fighting with each other otherwise they'll have too much
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:08.040]  stability and then you can't interject with the various yeah energy powers as
[02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:13.280]  you say in the rest of it yes and in the current realize too is a very old policy
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:18.200]  and tactic because Britain was using the exact same tactic when India was a
[02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:22.560]  conglomeration of small principles basically and Britain united it by
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:26.400]  getting all the factions fighting each other for a long time and they'd play
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:30.560]  them all off against each other and eventually over time when it was when it
[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:35.680]  was right to do they consolidate different sides and bring them into a bigger
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:40.800]  region and then the next region until they had the whole of India united under
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:46.480]  their own particular rule so they might be doing this for next 50 60 years in the
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:50.440]  Middle East at least yeah well they did that in so many places for so many
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:54.600]  hundreds of years they coined it the great game it's all technique is well
[02:27:54.600 --> 02:28:00.520]  understood and they finance all sides the problem in a money system is that you
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:05.880]  can always get people within any faction any group to turn and their own people
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:11.080]  and and be a spy or a provocateur and therefore you can always follow money
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:15.720]  into the size they're fighting each other but only to a few people who are in
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:20.080]  the know who keep it all going and that's what they're doing yeah and
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:24.400]  obviously it's far too easy to buy out a leader at the top although we seem to
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:31.720]  fall for a time and again regardless of country or context yes yeah so on the
[02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:35.800]  other side we want to get into the Iranian war where things are headed with
[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:40.240]  all the provocations and so many of the other events that are going on I also
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:44.640]  want to bring up some of Brzezinski's book between two ages he really talks
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:49.040]  about how under the emerging global government you have the illusion that
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:52.080]  states are the real players but really it's multi-million dollar
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:56.600]  international corporations the banks and the other entrants behind it he talks
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:28:59.880]  about how even organized crime becomes part of the system because it's
[02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:06.060]  preferable to chaos and he also talks about how third world conflict is just
[02:29:06.060 --> 02:29:10.640]  routine really to be expected part of the larger development Alan I'm sure you
[02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:14.760]  could speak to that as well and so we're coming up on the break in just a
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:19.680]  moment and just want to remind you once again about the Info Wars nightly news

[02:33:03.760 --> 02:33:09.800]  Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your
[02:33:09.800 --> 02:33:12.200]  mind
[02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:28.680]  we are back once again at info wars.com I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in until Alex is
[02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:33.320]  back tomorrow our guest is still Alan Watt he joins us for the rest of the
[02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:39.280]  hour a long-term researcher into their long-term strategy long as in fifty
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:43.360]  hundred year and even longer intervals but we also want to talk about current
[02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:47.800]  events where the current Occupy Wall Street movement is going and what kind
[02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:52.680]  of legislation will be piggybacked on their energy but before the break I
[02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:56.880]  brought up some of Brzezinski's quotes just really talking about how
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:34:01.560]  third-world conflict organized crime and all the rest of it is really
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:06.920]  routinized as even states are really just chess pieces for the multi-million
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:12.080]  dollar international corporations major banks financial institutions and the
[02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:18.200]  rest of it as Brzezinski puts it in his 1970s between two ages book Alan can you
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:22.600]  speak to those issues yeah obviously this is actually what's happening right
[02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:26.360]  now of course is that the state of old idea of the Royal Institute of National
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:30.440]  Affairs Council on Foreign Relations was to bring the world through a series of
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:36.240]  conflicts in order to take over the all energy supplies all everything vital for
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:44.080]  human sustainment basically our containment or even continue continue
[02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:50.280]  it as ability has to be taken over and owned by a conglomeration a world
[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:56.040]  conglomeration and we're seeing that right now as the destabilize other
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:35:00.160]  countries and do the same with them one after another using the soft power but
[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:04.200]  you're quite right there with using organized crime and I've always used
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:08.960]  org organized crime in fact the latest Department of Defense from the think tank
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:14.240]  department that works for NATO and Britain came out with their report for
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:18.680]  the year that's very similar to last year of the last of 2007 report was the
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:22.160]  last one to give out and these are the guys who said though that the world to
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:28.600]  come for a while will be one of conflict everywhere and as they bring all
[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:32.480]  basically these third world countries are brought under the control of the
[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:38.880]  global governance system and and the big corporations go in to disease again
[02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:43.320]  resources on natural resources from those countries and take ownership of
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:48.160]  them and you understand it and also said to that the distinction as you
[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:52.560]  mentioned there but gangsters etc it's a distinction between organized crime and
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:56.560]  legitimate government would be very blurred and it already has been for
[02:35:56.560 --> 02:36:00.840]  quite some time for instance the United States has been training for the last
[02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:05.760]  few years mercenaries from all overland America and elsewhere training them in
[02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:09.880]  the United States like the old school for America's idea and sending them in as
[02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:15.320]  assassins into Mexico and so you have these organized militarized assassination
[02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:19.360]  squads in Mexico right now and you don't know if it's the drug gangs who are
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:22.480]  assassinating people and putting the bodies out in the streets a warning or
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:27.480]  if it's actually these mercenaries the US has as using and because if they don't
[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:32.280]  use the mercenaries right now to take out all the gangs in Mexico they're
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:36.320]  going to have to send in the military and people within Mexico know that it
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:40.120]  will never be resolved from within will have to be another invasion from
[02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:46.320]  without these particular mercenary gangs don't work so it's quite an
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:50.680]  interesting time to be watching all of this happening as they really move
[02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:54.560]  forward because the agenda has a timetable and these guys are obsessed with
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:37:00.360]  timetables and even in the in strategic trends the again the report they put
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:04.080]  out recently they talk about the timetables stretching up now to the
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:10.480]  year 2050 and it's got everything in it world depopulation how much it will
[02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:16.320]  plummet in China elsewhere etc and how they must fulfill the millennium goals
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:21.920]  the gender 21 goals and really ram them through with it with the animal corridors
[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:27.600]  human corridors etc we already have that happening back home we have again
[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:31.760]  even here we have Communitarianism in Canada and America you have these
[02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:36.880]  self-appointed panels green panels right down to your city your town councils
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:40.400]  they have them appointed to them as well you can't do anything at all in
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:45.800]  property without getting advice or paying a fee for an eco impact etc so
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:51.680]  we're probably seeing the emergence of this whole new change society time for
[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:55.720]  change getting back to academia when you brought academia on board that was the
[02:37:55.720 --> 02:38:00.680]  that was a buzzword used in academia for the last 50 years but the 21st century
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:04.920]  would be the century of change and that's why they gave that mantra to
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:11.440]  Obama to give out change change is good they simply are told those in the dark
[02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:16.400]  would actually meant that while we're seeing what it really means is the
[02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:20.880]  emergence of a world order the plant society and any plant society they
[02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:24.880]  planned if they're never let the workers run it never let that happen like if
[02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:29.200]  they're periods of a more orderly worker society and it will be ordered you'll
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:31.960]  be weighed from birth rights for your whole life to see how much you're
[02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:35.360]  eating for instance that kind of stuff but they've always got to have a leisure
[02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:39.040]  class for what they call progress shows you've always got to have a leisure
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:44.240]  class therefore you'll have a very high elite paid class of the
[02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:48.520]  professional people working in their think tanks and you'll be funding them
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:53.720]  all and they will be basically planning the future for the world that's their
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:57.760]  lovely utopia that they hope to bring in and I don't see why they can't because
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:02.560]  they've achieved so many objectives right now and we forget all the time how
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:06.720]  many changes that brought in to stay right down to your local council by
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:11.560]  appointing themselves over as an over bureau basically to every little time
[02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:16.720]  council if to the federal level and provincial in Canada up to the federal
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:22.600]  government so it's it's all there that the the basic blueprint is all in
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:26.800]  position all the other players are there and I'll have to get now is more
[02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:32.800]  more power over the general population if Britain is a flagship a trial balloon
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:37.720]  for the whole world to follow it's so far ahead now where everyone is pleased
[02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:43.240]  from a thousand different sources on a daily basis from your garbage pick up
[02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:48.160]  to how you take your children to school how do you interact with your
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:53.920]  children it is complete socialist planned scientific society they're bringing in
[02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:59.440]  and America after it's finished off the unification of the Americas and finished
[02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:04.440]  office job in the Middle East has to emulate that exact same society for the
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:08.760]  whole world has to do it in fact and then will be taxed on energy units
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:13.760]  consumption etc. austerity for those at the bottom a very high living for those
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:17.960]  at the top who are the world managers and that that's the whole game plan yeah
[02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:22.160]  yeah just to go back to what you said about the Mexican drug gangs and the CIA
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:26.520]  trained assassination squads there's really no doubt that those people are
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:31.000]  being used for the purpose you describe but also they're using the drug gang
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:36.360]  thing to advance the perimeter the North American security perimeter even as
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:40.120]  they have this kind of Iran contrast style fast and furious scandal unfolding
[02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:47.640]  yes as you know to the Department of Homeland Security took over the the
[02:40:47.640 --> 02:40:53.320]  basically the perimeter of the United States and decided with 50 miles never
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:57.440]  into a hundred miles around the coastline right inland etc. and from the
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:02.680]  Canadian border southwards and they want to do the same thing a few years ago in
[02:41:02.680 --> 02:41:06.600]  the paper they wanted the whole of the Americas to have this organization they
[02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:10.440]  called the Fortress America and that's when the Prime Minister Canada then the
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:14.880]  US president of Mexico met together a few black American countries and they
[02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:19.440]  drew up a map and they want to actually bring in the Fortress America with a
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:24.560]  homeland security of all along the Canadian border that's a coastline a
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:30.160]  whole lot like down through Latin America and back up again so they're using
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:34.040]  every crisis trip for complete amalgamation and by the way the
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:37.880]  Council of Foreign Relations has said in Canada we are using this financial
[02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:42.040]  crisis for deeper integration that means that means merging with the United
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:47.200]  States of America that's been in the open here so I'm sure and getting back
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:53.520]  into the Occupy Wall Street formation of that global revolution what do you see
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:57.200]  happening because obviously there's a lot of grassroots energy people upset
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:01.160]  about general economic condition conditions but not a lot of specifics
[02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:05.680]  and it's really pretty textbook that if you don't have an energy that's inside
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:09.520]  of what's already been established inside the left-right paradigm you can
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:15.000]  either a disrupted or more easily you can vent that anger give them a certain
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:19.960]  pleasure that they're being spoken to and heard while co-opting it Allen so
[02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:23.280]  what direction do you see this going well but we're only told where they're
[02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:27.240]  going because and one of the first world trade organization meetings they had
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:33.680]  and publicized they showed you a little interview inside the meeting they were
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:37.800]  looking down at the protests and as I always do from ivory towers and they
[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:42.040]  said we'll have to eventually over the years bring the leaders in on board with
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:46.080]  our panel discussions and become part of it well they've been doing that for
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:51.120]  years now since then and we've been up for instance we've watched appointees of
[02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:55.960]  Obama's specialists on his panels and elected people who are now experts these
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:43:01.240]  science stars etc who are really into sociology and family planning and
[02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:06.080]  depopulation well every country is doing the same Britain has this version of
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:09.520]  them too so does Canada but for appointees now there's many appointees
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:14.040]  almost the top is you as elected people and these are representatives of unions
[02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:19.280]  and everything else and if you notice even that some of the the organizations
[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:27.200]  in the Occupy Wall Street you find this is backed by the EFSCME the FLCIO the
[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:32.160]  Labour Union and these organizations and the President Gerald Macintree is a
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:36.360]  co-founder and chairman of the Board for Economic Policy Institute he's one of
[02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:39.920]  the leaders now at Wall Street there and he also helped pass the Obamacare so
[02:43:39.920 --> 02:43:45.680]  they're already on board these panels in the US government and also members of
[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:50.040]  these unions down below they're both you see and there's quite a few of them like
[02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:54.120]  that there's also Robert Johnson who serves managing director of Tassara's
[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:58.040]  fund management and they also work to the chief of the chief of economists for
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:44:03.120]  the Senate Banking Budget Committee he's down there too leading the thing
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:06.200]  against Wall Street the charge against Wall Street so they already have these
[02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:10.080]  guys on board with government and all these organizations and they're also
[02:44:10.080 --> 02:44:14.600]  part of these supposedly left-wing socialist organizations for world
[02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:20.600]  governments or governments they call it Lawrence Mitchell as well there was the
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:24.480]  Economic Policy Institute president along with a member of the Democratic
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:30.040]  Socialists of America and he's also in it too so all these big boys are in on the
[02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:33.940]  Wall Street thing while they also work with these big foundations that work
[02:44:33.940 --> 02:44:39.120]  with the Obama and government as well so as government leading what appears to
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:47.320]  be a revolt of the people we've seen a big hype for war with Iran with this
[02:44:47.320 --> 02:44:52.560]  phony assassination plot taking place last week really paper thin despite
[02:44:52.560 --> 02:44:56.000]  what the headlines would lead you to believe now there's other incidents
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:00.920]  there's a guy on a plane they landed in Texas who is screaming in Arabic and
[02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:04.720]  then how everyone was gonna die now you've got these Muslims busted at a
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:10.120]  Texas courthouse who I believe they had blueprints and there was a bomb scare
[02:45:10.120 --> 02:45:15.400]  or something are they preparing for something Alan oh yeah I mean from the
[02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:19.280]  90s they've been preparing for it in fact because we know that in the new
[02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:24.600]  American Century group I published a list of countries they had to take out
[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:29.240]  and they wanted to start with Afghanistan Iraq and then it would be a
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:34.760]  toss-up between Syria or Iran to follow they mentioned Egypt as well and
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:38.880]  eventually North Korea but said the main ones were the Middle East so of what
[02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:43.240]  and we see that Rumsfeld and Cheney have both congratulated Obama for
[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:47.520]  continuing their policy of taking over these those countries now the new
[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:51.320]  American Century group under Bush called a revolutionary democracy now
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:56.840]  which you invade and force democracy upon them and now we're seeing this
[02:45:56.840 --> 02:46:00.040]  group you're using the color revolutions followed by hard power
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:03.360]  military power which is exactly again what the think tank for the military
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:07.240]  said they do any published their findings I've got them all on my website so
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:12.240]  all are different think tank reports so we're following the agenda they
[02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:17.120]  said that the Apollo back in the 90s and as Jefferson said it when you say
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:23.320]  the same policies the same policies follow from changes in house between
[02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:26.320]  one to the next house then you know you're under tyranny you know under
[02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:30.320]  different government a different party it's the same organization running the
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:34.720]  same policies and that's what you're seeing yeah yeah certainly if you want
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:39.320]  to call a black ops network or whatever and now you even have reports like Paul
[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:43.400]  Watson from today on the State Department agitator who was part of the
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:48.580]  Egypt Arab Spring backed by the State Department now he's advising the
[02:46:48.580 --> 02:46:53.800]  Occupy Wall Street movement Alan yes let the ones is right off to this guys are
[02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:58.760]  all members and working with the government and they also run some of
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:05.360]  the largest socialist organizations of America you know I don't realize I don't
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:10.880]  know if Americans realize that the socialist international how big and
[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:15.440]  powerful they are and that the British labor government a kick the kick
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:19.000]  softest annual meeting and they finished the annual meeting and he's
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:24.200]  seeing the red flag did they know that Tony Blair I've got videos about Tony
[02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:28.440]  Blair and all the big boys who in charge of Britain and they were singing
[02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:33.440]  we keep the red flag flying high they don't understand that Sarkozy all the
[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:36.520]  people across the world right through into the United Nations are members of
[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:43.320]  this organization including the ones in America yeah not to mention the thing
[02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:47.280]  at their annual meetings and the press generally doesn't bother reporting that
[02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:53.200]  part but in Britain some people have and they filmed it and documented it
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:57.120]  there's a side note I've seen a lot of these trendy bars popping up here in
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:04.120]  town in Austin with the communist hammer and sickle on the logo but it just goes
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:09.840]  to show mm-hmm so the dialectics remember he go pointed out the dialectic
[02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:14.640]  and how y'all use opposing sides to bring out the new and what you also do
[02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:23.840]  under the Marxist program basically is that each generation of Marxist must be
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:28.560]  more radical than the previous one and that they put the right to eliminate
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:32.520]  physically if need be the older ones who are still contaminated with the old
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:38.480]  ideas and today we're seeing they are ones who the fresh group the fresh crop
[02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:41.280]  that freshly trained in university because that's where all the leaders
[02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:47.280]  come from they're all trained by professional professors to agitate for
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:52.960]  the new system a better more fairer world of justice etc but of course with
[02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:57.400]  world managers like themselves living a high on the hog because I say they said
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:01.200]  you have to have an intelligentsia class and a leisure class to help plan the
[02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:08.240]  future so yeah this is really the Marxist agenda and that's why the
[02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:14.120]  Marxism was was funded basically in London the marks was funded by one of
[02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:18.720]  the biggest factory owners in the whole of Europe he was not poor little guy it
[02:49:18.720 --> 02:49:24.560]  is on personal servant all the rest of it and that they've used this dialectic
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:31.040]  for all since then because the bankers prefer socialist governments because it
[02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:36.200]  is a leader of government for every facet of humanity is total control over
[02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:40.640]  humanity is what it is yeah and maybe on the other side of the break here in
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:43.760]  the last segment we could talk about how Al Gore who is part of the Armand
[02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:48.960]  Hammer Empire who back the Soviet Union called for this American version of the
[02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:55.120]  Arab Spring about three weeks before it popped up Alan mm-hmm okay yeah or your
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:59.760]  comments now as we go out to break you oh yeah I mean Armand Hammer again he
[02:49:59.760 --> 02:50:05.680]  his father changed his name to be the arm and hammer that you see on the
[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:09.420]  British Communist site and the British Freemason site by the way these the
[02:50:09.420 --> 02:50:14.520]  arm and hammers that he comes in square and that's we changed his name to
[02:50:14.520 --> 02:50:20.160]  actually be a Soviet the epitome of the sovietism basically multi-millionaire
[02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:24.600]  and he had an apartment next to Lenin and then Stalin and he came back and
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:28.720]  forced during the whole war cold war arm and hammer and no one stopped them
[02:50:28.720 --> 02:50:34.400]  bother them or ask them what he was up to and to help organize the far left in
[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:38.800]  America the big boys all knew what they were doing the big bankers all knew it
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:42.560]  was up about because it's part of the agenda they must merge the two systems
[02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:48.000]  together to bring out the synthesis the next part the next part of the segment

[02:53:06.640 --> 02:53:10.760]  constant attack the globalist want to ban all supplements formulated after
[02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:15.120]  1994 governments are hoarding raw materials affecting our ability to
[02:53:15.120 --> 02:53:19.440]  purchase these products at a reasonable price even organic foods are stripped of
[02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:24.080]  nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing conditions storeable

[02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:21.600]  we are in the final segment with our guest Alan Watt he's covered really the
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:26.640]  spectrum here of the long-term strategy the rebroadcast is coming up with Alex
[02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:32.000]  Jones Paul Joseph Watson Webster Tarpley and Alan Watt of course but Alan in
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:36.000]  these final few minutes in addition to anything you want to bring up I would
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:39.120]  just like to point out that obviously the elections are totally controlled
[02:54:39.120 --> 02:54:43.240]  really have always been a farce but at the same time the Democratic Party is
[02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:48.520]  looking to co-op the energy of Occupy movements everywhere they have plans for
[02:54:48.520 --> 02:54:53.640]  new taxes the puppets on the right also have their plans for fresh taxes how
[02:54:53.640 --> 02:54:57.520]  will this energy be used and what do we make of people like Al Gore calling for
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:03.000]  an American Arab Spring Alan well you and you see more more and more of the
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:10.200]  private people from really from these labor organizations or the the the ones
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:14.600]  who run them or control them or agitate them more and more of those guys brought
[02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:19.400]  on board for government policy just appointees again on behalf of the
[02:55:19.400 --> 02:55:25.400]  workers as I'll tell you and in reality they're professionally trained and run by
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:31.760]  the big boys who run the policy institutes etc so it's it's time for
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:36.760]  change to say and make the people think that more representation etc and a
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:40.640]  little sure in government as they yell at each other once in a while but nothing
[02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:46.520]  but show you ain't a plan society you're already into a global society and so
[02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:50.360]  many treaties have been signed over the last 50 years to bind it all together
[02:55:50.360 --> 02:55:56.000]  so that you can't just pull out and continue we are now dependent on outside
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:01.520]  the sources to even eat nowadays and most of the food's been imported from
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:05.080]  elsewhere that made sure that all the farms were destroyed that was part of
[02:56:05.080 --> 02:56:09.400]  the destruction of the farms by government policies and interference with
[02:56:09.400 --> 02:56:14.240]  the EPA and and may various other agencies also get rid of being
[02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:20.240]  independent independence must be destroyed for global society and all the
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:24.200]  right wingers as well have been parting interdependence from the days of
[02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:29.240]  Maggie Thatcher onwards so believe me they're all in on the same deal at the
[02:56:29.240 --> 02:56:32.560]  top there's not a lot of difference between them you can't work your way up
[02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:37.920]  into politics and be vetted and okayed and and be completely ignorant of the big
[02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:44.400]  agenda the big goal at the end of it all you cannot it cannot happen and I gave
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:48.840]  up on this left-wing right-wing strategy a long time ago I knew it was a con I've
[02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:51.760]  seen it happen in other countries to various countries across Europe I see
[02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:55.520]  us all the cons been played it's been played in America to the very very end
[02:56:55.520 --> 02:56:59.920]  of course because most Americans know darn well that they've just signed another
[02:56:59.920 --> 02:57:04.560]  free trade deal one of the biggest ones with various Latin American countries
[02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:08.760]  that's a one-way street for trade it's all imports into America and subsidizing
[02:57:08.760 --> 02:57:12.000]  those countries to come up the first world status we're going to pay out pay out
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:15.680]  pay out that's part of the redistribution of wealth that we're
[02:57:15.680 --> 02:57:21.000]  talking about so it's a one-way deal America has to come down into a
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:25.960]  sterility one way or another and they've set up the whole game board for that to
[02:57:25.960 --> 02:57:32.040]  happen if you can't fit yourself to be honest with you you're in trouble that's
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:36.520]  that's a very basic thing very basic thing and when you do we're totally
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:41.680]  dependent now on on the electricity power energy of all kinds and they want to
[02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:45.560]  have a world grid system they're building it now we're literally a world
[02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:50.280]  power supply company that will feed it to each region and they'll decide that
[02:57:50.280 --> 02:57:55.560]  on how much you'll get that day or that week and that's the plan system of the
[02:57:55.560 --> 02:57:59.760]  future be very expensive even for a day's worth of it in the fight so the
[02:57:59.760 --> 02:58:03.280]  companies aren't losing money by getting you less and we're being set up with
[02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:07.400]  smart meters smart grids all for that system but they actually have maps up
[02:58:07.400 --> 02:58:12.720]  off the world grid system at the United Nations and elsewhere so we're we're
[02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:17.760]  well along the road to it and we're still talking in a almost 19th century
[02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:22.640]  paradigm of politics and left and right but we passed that point okay Alan we'll
[02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:26.000]  leave it there we really appreciate you joining us once again and always
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:30.680]  appreciate your insights again turn into the rebroadcast and tonight the infowars
