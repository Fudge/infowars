[00:00.000 --> 00:29.360]  In an old video from 1995, a theology professor named Pierre Gilbert warned of mandatory
[00:29.360 --> 00:36.400]  vaccines that would turn recipients into zombies. He speaks in French, so I will translate.
[00:37.040 --> 00:42.400]  In the biological destruction, there are the organized tempests on the magnetic fields.
[00:42.960 --> 00:47.360]  What will follow is the contamination of the bloodstreams of mankind,
[00:50.240 --> 00:57.680]  creating intentional infections. This will be enforced via laws
[00:57.680 --> 01:04.160]  that will make vaccination mandatory, and these vaccines will make possible to control people.
[01:05.600 --> 01:09.760]  The vaccines will have liquid crystals that will become
[01:09.760 --> 01:17.760]  hosted in the brain cells, which will become micro receivers of electromagnetic fields,
[01:20.320 --> 01:23.680]  where waves of very low frequencies will be sent.
[01:23.680 --> 01:29.120]  And through these low frequency waves, people will be unable to think.
[01:30.240 --> 01:37.200]  You'll be turned into a zombie. Don't think of this as a hypothesis. This has been done.
[01:40.080 --> 01:41.280]  Think of Rwanda.
[01:44.320 --> 01:47.520]  There isn't much information I could find about Pierre Gilbert,
[01:47.520 --> 01:52.560]  but what he said 26 years ago certainly rings true today.
[01:54.400 --> 02:01.440]  In 2016, the Guardian published genetically engineered magnetoprotein remotely controls
[02:01.440 --> 02:07.280]  brain and behavior. Here we can see zebrafish larvae that have been injected with magneto
[02:07.280 --> 02:14.240]  being manipulated with magnetic fields. In March of 2020, Defense One published an
[02:14.240 --> 02:19.520]  article on how hydrogel biosensors are ready to be injected into people's bodies,
[02:20.240 --> 02:26.240]  funded by DARPA and Bill Gates. If you search magnetic nanoparticles,
[02:26.240 --> 02:30.640]  you will find several articles and videos explaining the so-called benefits of this
[02:30.640 --> 02:36.320]  invasive technology that can control parts of the human body via external frequencies.
[02:36.320 --> 02:45.200]  Livestock needs to be branded and tracked, and the enslavement of humanity is voluntary,
[02:46.160 --> 02:53.600]  which is why the so-called vaccines are voluntary. And sadly, there seems to be millions of people
[02:53.600 --> 03:00.240]  eagerly lining up to be state property. For ReaseReport.com, this is Greg Rease.
[03:00.240 --> 03:07.440]  People talk glibly about science. What is science? People coming out of a university
[03:07.440 --> 03:13.280]  with a master's degree or a PhD, you take them into the field, and they literally
[03:13.280 --> 03:18.640]  don't believe anything, and this is a peer-reviewed paper. It's the only thing they accept,
[03:18.640 --> 03:24.240]  and you say to them, but let's observe, let's think, let's discuss, they don't do it.
[03:24.240 --> 03:31.920]  It's just, is it in the peer-reviewed paper or not? That's their view of science. I think it's
[03:31.920 --> 03:39.920]  pathetic. Gone into universities as bright young people, they come out of them brain dead,
[03:39.920 --> 03:46.480]  not even knowing what science means. They think it means peer-reviewed papers, etc. No,
[03:46.480 --> 03:53.600]  that's academia. And if a paper is peer-reviewed, it means everybody thought the same,
[03:53.600 --> 04:00.800]  therefore they approved it. An unintended consequence is that when new knowledge emerges,
[04:00.800 --> 04:08.560]  new scientific insights, they can never, ever be peer-reviewed. So we're blocking
[04:08.560 --> 04:16.000]  all new advances in science that are big advances. If you look at the breakthroughs in science,
[04:16.720 --> 04:21.760]  almost always they don't come from the center of that profession. They come from the fringe.
[04:21.760 --> 04:27.520]  The finest candle makers in the world couldn't even think of electric lights. They don't come
[04:27.520 --> 04:33.120]  from within. They often come from outside the brakes. We're going to kill ourselves because
[04:33.120 --> 04:41.200]  of stupidity. Ladies and gentlemen, it's May 30th on this live Sunday edition. I'm your host Alex
[04:41.200 --> 04:46.960]  Jones. Please stay with us for the next two hours and beyond because we are going to break
[04:46.960 --> 04:52.000]  incredibly important news exclusively here that could affect the future of the planet
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.560]  in a great way. And folks, no, that's not pretentious. That's a fact.
[04:59.280 --> 05:03.760]  A lot of virtue signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how much
[05:03.760 --> 05:07.920]  they care about veterans. But at the same time, they won't stand up for what those veterans
[05:07.920 --> 05:13.680]  and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of U.S. history. And now more than ever,
[05:13.680 --> 05:19.600]  what our republic stands for and has stood for is under attack. America is under globalist
[05:19.600 --> 05:24.880]  takeover. It's an information war. It is an economic war. But most importantly, it is a
[05:24.880 --> 05:31.600]  spiritual war. And now, of course, it's a biological and chemical war with the vaccines. We were
[05:31.600 --> 05:36.080]  the first to tell you that the virus came out. We were the first to tell you that vaccine
[05:36.080 --> 05:40.080]  passports were coming. We were the first to lay out basically everything because we actually
[05:40.080 --> 05:43.600]  do our research and know what we're talking about. And that's why it's important to keep
[05:43.600 --> 05:48.000]  info wars in the air now more than ever. And for Memorial Day week, we're having store-wide
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.520]  free shipping and double-paid trade points. A lot of great products are back in stock,
[05:51.520 --> 05:55.920]  like DNA Force, Alpha Power, and Polyblock. So to all the veterans and all the patrons,
[05:55.920 --> 06:12.160]  we salute you. And I want to ask the listeners, please support Info Wars now more than ever.
[06:12.160 --> 06:18.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[06:18.960 --> 06:28.720]  so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. It's Sunday, May 30th, the
[06:28.720 --> 06:36.160]  year is 2021. And per usual, we will break absolutely critical information for the future
[06:36.720 --> 06:42.320]  of our species on this planet and beyond. Thank you again so much for joining us
[06:42.320 --> 06:48.960]  on the eve of Memorial Day. We're live. I'll be here for the next two hours.
[06:48.960 --> 06:54.240]  The Troyer is coming in to do Sunday Live, 6 to 8 p.m. Central as well.
[06:55.440 --> 06:59.360]  Okay. Obviously, a lot of people are paying attention to this transmission.
[07:00.240 --> 07:08.240]  I have had so many national talk show hosts and others. Folks involved, former directors of
[07:08.240 --> 07:13.760]  intelligence agencies, not just General Flynn, but others calling me up congratulating me in
[07:13.760 --> 07:18.880]  the last 48 hours saying, how did you know that it came out of the Wuhan lab?
[07:20.720 --> 07:26.400]  And the key to victory here is not taking credit for this, because if I just take credit for that,
[07:26.400 --> 07:30.160]  people think I'm some type of Nostradamus. We're going to lose the whole planet.
[07:30.160 --> 07:38.400]  It specifically came out in late January, early February, and then March of 2020,
[07:39.200 --> 07:45.920]  the exact virus combo, the five viruses spliced together, six insertions
[07:47.040 --> 07:53.760]  on the CRISPR standard systems, and in other gene editing and gene reading systems.
[07:55.120 --> 08:00.000]  Exactly what it was. And then we went and looked up that Fauci had run the entire program there.
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.320]  Since 2015, when it was D&B legal in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[08:05.680 --> 08:10.320]  And so we had on a lot of virologists and epidemiologists and scientists and the guy that
[08:10.320 --> 08:17.920]  wrote the U.S. Biological Weapons Law back in the late 80s and helped write world treaties on
[08:17.920 --> 08:23.440]  biological chemical weapons in the 90s and was the chief UN war crimes prosecutor of
[08:23.440 --> 08:30.320]  Sullivan. I mean, the list goes on and on. And he came on and went over all that data. He's a professor in Chicago
[08:31.360 --> 08:39.040]  and laid out exactly what the facts were. So it's the equivalent of if they would have had film
[08:39.600 --> 08:46.000]  shot 35 millimeter of Charlie Manchin telling his cult to go kill Sharon Tate.
[08:46.960 --> 08:50.480]  It was enough that you don't have witnesses that he said do it. And he got convicted ultimately.
[08:50.480 --> 08:58.640]  But this would be like having 35 millimeter film of him giving the order. And so it's all there.
[08:59.600 --> 09:06.400]  And so we put all this out over a year ago. 15 months ago, 16 months ago,
[09:07.760 --> 09:14.160]  17 months ago, hard to believe time's flying. However, many months go back from the end of May
[09:14.160 --> 09:27.440]  20, 21 to late January 2020. And there it all is. And the same thing happens. These smart people call
[09:27.440 --> 09:31.200]  me and they go, well, congratulations on this. You've really been proven right again. I say,
[09:31.200 --> 09:35.920]  listen, it's not me. Let me send you some articles from the scientists and said, oh, come on, Alex.
[09:35.920 --> 09:41.520]  Nobody knew but you. And then I start trying to tell them what's coming next. And as usual,
[09:41.520 --> 09:47.200]  no one's listening or no one's paying attention like they should be because it's all right here.
[09:49.040 --> 09:54.240]  But even more importantly, why it's all coming out is here. Don't you want to know why CNN's
[09:54.240 --> 10:02.480]  done a U-turn, a 180, a bat turn, and come out and said, okay, it looks like it came out of the
[10:02.480 --> 10:07.920]  lab. Here's a headline. We need to know how COVID-19 emerged so we can stop it from happening.
[10:07.920 --> 10:15.200]  And ABC News saying, well, looks like it came out of the lab. They knew 16 months ago,
[10:17.600 --> 10:26.240]  17 months ago, they knew all this same stuff. In fact, it was the WHO and Fauci that went and
[10:26.240 --> 10:30.960]  threatened Australia and threatened India and threatened French scientists. Because you don't
[10:30.960 --> 10:37.680]  think all our scientists do this too? That have these multi-billion-dollar machines and they threaten
[10:37.680 --> 10:44.960]  their funding. Because you see, multinational corporations, they quote, donate these machines
[10:44.960 --> 10:50.720]  to these big scientific institutions so they can control what information comes out about the
[10:50.720 --> 10:55.440]  genetic code of humans and everything else on this planet and what they're doing. And so
[10:56.000 --> 11:03.040]  scientists got samples. They scanned it. They said this is the Frankenstein of Frankensteins,
[11:03.040 --> 11:07.920]  whether it's super deadly or not, that's up for debate. The fact is, it was five different species
[11:07.920 --> 11:14.880]  of virus welded together. Now, top US and British scientists, or at the top of food chain, they're
[11:14.880 --> 11:26.640]  saying six viruses. So it's all there, the P Shuttle genes, all of it, where they actually
[11:26.640 --> 11:34.800]  physically put these viruses together. And Wuhan was an industrial level site. You got video coming
[11:34.800 --> 11:41.040]  up of the Wuhan scientists just covered in blood, had to tell and just get animals and stuff everywhere
[11:41.040 --> 11:50.000]  because they were feeding pigs with the flesh, the organs of pigs that had died from the virus,
[11:50.000 --> 11:56.800]  so that they could industrially get tons of the virus out for bio weapons. The only reason you do
[11:56.800 --> 12:04.400]  that are reportedly thousands of pigs. Because still the machine they use as a human body or
[12:04.400 --> 12:10.240]  an animal body, they're not really making these in labs, they're just mass producing it. They isolate
[12:10.240 --> 12:16.160]  it, then they put it back into an animal, and then they start mass producing that particular
[12:16.160 --> 12:22.320]  replication of the virus, then they freeze it. Because most viruses that have become deadly,
[12:22.320 --> 12:28.560]  quickly become non-deadly. They mutate and no longer a deadly strain. That's the big secret
[12:28.560 --> 12:32.720]  about germs and about how they go into us, and then our body learns how to deal with them,
[12:32.720 --> 12:39.120]  and then you get herd immunity. And that's all the science. But today, starting next segment,
[12:39.120 --> 12:47.360]  I am going to, in a very focused way, go through how all this comes together, and how big a deal
[12:47.360 --> 12:51.760]  it is that this is now actually coming out. But here's some of the headlines. We need to know
[12:51.760 --> 12:57.360]  how COVID-19 emerged so we can stop it happening again. Well, I thought we knew it was the wet
[12:57.360 --> 13:03.760]  market and somebody ate a bat. ABC's John Carl admits Trump write about COVID origins, some things
[13:03.760 --> 13:11.280]  may be true, even if Donald Trump said them. Virologist says genetic fingerprints prove COVID-19
[13:11.280 --> 13:17.040]  man-made, no credible ancestor. That's in the Daily Mail with these top scientists over in the UK,
[13:17.040 --> 13:24.160]  but that's not really the headline. The big news is that there's six inserts created through gain
[13:24.160 --> 13:29.200]  of function research at the Lula Institute in the virus. It's a bunch of different species of
[13:29.200 --> 13:36.960]  virus. It didn't naturally mutate into this. A lizard doesn't mutate in a million years
[13:37.680 --> 13:48.160]  into a giraffe. It's whole different viruses, different species of virus from the wild fused
[13:48.160 --> 13:55.200]  into one in a laboratory. And as Rand Paul, being a doctor, went over the medical system
[13:55.200 --> 14:03.600]  of this, they use natural animals to gestate it in, to basically produce it in, so that it would
[14:03.600 --> 14:08.000]  then not have all the markings of being made in the lab, but it was spliced in the lab,
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.160]  then put into animals to be produced in their blood and then strained out. That's why it was
[14:12.160 --> 14:17.440]  like a slaughterhouse because it was just massive amounts of these viruses that they were purifying
[14:17.440 --> 14:24.240]  out and preparing. For the bio attack, they then launched, but humans are so strong and so healthy
[14:24.240 --> 14:28.720]  it didn't work on most people, only the old, only the sick, and the Chinese and Wuhan, the most toxic
[14:28.720 --> 14:34.240]  city in the world, who already have destroyed lungs from the toxic air. A lot of them did die,
[14:34.880 --> 14:42.080]  and so then that was used to create massive hype and massive fear. But it's all the timing of the
[14:42.080 --> 14:46.080]  release that is the most important. Yeah, just click the first link right there where it says
[14:46.080 --> 14:50.800]  Daily Mail. Show folks that article. Thanks for TV viewers. I'm directing the crew here. There it is.
[14:50.800 --> 14:59.760]  So we're going to lay it all out today and why it's coming out now, but the big issue here is
[15:01.440 --> 15:07.120]  it didn't leak from the lab accidentally. Look at the timing of it. Look at Fauci saying Trump
[15:07.120 --> 15:11.520]  will be challenged in the next few years by a massive pandemic when he first got into office.
[15:11.520 --> 15:16.800]  He gave that speech when Trump first got in. You look at how we stayed locked down,
[15:16.800 --> 15:21.840]  but China didn't. Then China bragged that they won the economic war and America's over
[15:21.840 --> 15:27.120]  because we stayed locked down and they didn't. I mean, they had the motive, they had the background,
[15:27.120 --> 15:32.960]  they had the history, they bragged about it. Fauci has said China's incredible. Gates has said China's
[15:32.960 --> 15:38.400]  incredible. Then America's done. Big techs moved to China. This was an economic warfare weapon
[15:38.400 --> 15:44.000]  using a virus scare to take over, and they wanted it to be a Chimera virus. So when scientists
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.080]  looked at it, they would get really scared and believe the story that it was a super deadly
[15:48.080 --> 15:54.640]  bio weapon, but that's only part one of it. It's a carrier virus for any new bio weapon system they
[15:54.640 --> 15:58.800]  want to release. I believe they're going to release a later COVID that will be super deadly. Stay with
[15:58.800 --> 16:04.880]  us. I share with you the viewers and listeners the facts of where info wars is, and it's always a
[16:04.880 --> 16:09.680]  complex picture, but I do my best to explain it to you because you are the patrons that make all
[16:09.680 --> 16:16.080]  this possible. So in short, the world's awakening, the spiral censorship, info wars has never been
[16:16.080 --> 16:21.120]  more influential and has never had a bigger effect exposing the global agenda and fighting it.
[16:21.120 --> 16:26.560]  But that said, the COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains has almost shut us down,
[16:26.560 --> 16:30.720]  because most of us selling products which you want to buy, like DNA Force Plus and others,
[16:30.720 --> 16:35.760]  have been sold out for up to seven months. Well, guess what? DNA Force Plus just came back in.
[16:35.760 --> 16:41.120]  Thank God for seven months. It's 40% off. It's amazing at infowarshore.com. And for the week
[16:41.120 --> 16:46.560]  leading up through Memorial Day, we have store-wide free shipping and double patriot points and alpha
[16:46.560 --> 16:51.440]  powers back in stock and super mill vitality back in stock and pollen block and vaso beach. They're
[16:51.440 --> 16:57.280]  all back in stock as much as 50% off store-wide free shipping, double patriot points, infowarshore.com.
[16:57.280 --> 17:02.000]  Thanks for keeping us on the air, info warriors. I always shoot you straight. And when I've told
[17:02.000 --> 17:07.040]  you over the years that if you don't support us, we'll be off the air. It's been true. But info
[17:07.040 --> 17:13.360]  wars has never been in a position where your support is more critical and more vital. The enemy
[17:13.360 --> 17:17.280]  behind the scenes is doing so many things. I'm not going to take time up to whine about it. It's
[17:17.280 --> 17:22.480]  okay. I expect to be attacked because we're over the target. We're having a great effect. We're
[17:22.480 --> 17:26.880]  exposing evil. You're exposing evil. So you spread the word about the broadcast or when you buy
[17:26.880 --> 17:33.360]  products or when you pray for info wars and our talk show hosts and our crew, it is so powerful.
[17:33.360 --> 17:40.160]  So again, as Memorial Day 2021 comes and goes, I want all of you to realize that I appreciate you
[17:40.160 --> 17:44.880]  as being veterans of the info war. And I particularly think our veterans as well that serve the armed
[17:44.880 --> 17:49.840]  forces because they understand what it is to sacrifice and they're needed more now than ever
[17:49.840 --> 17:54.080]  to be leaders in our republic to expose the globalist before and takeover that we're in
[17:54.080 --> 17:57.360]  the middle of right now. So it's a very historical time to be alive. I want to thank you all for
[17:57.360 --> 18:04.320]  your support and ask you to support us again. We're launching our 2021 Memorial Week specials.
[18:04.880 --> 18:10.880]  And right now we've got store wide free shipping. We've got double patriot points. We've got 40%
[18:10.880 --> 18:17.200]  off on DNA force plus sold out for seven months. We've got 50% off on ultra 12, 50% off on vaso
[18:17.200 --> 18:21.840]  beads, 50% off on alpha power. These are all incredible products. I talk about each one for
[18:21.840 --> 18:25.280]  several minutes, but a lot of you have already used them. Some of you haven't. You got to go
[18:25.280 --> 18:30.080]  check these out. These are all top of the line formulas. Some of them clones of best sellers,
[18:30.080 --> 18:35.280]  others original formulations that we came up with with top developers to blow people away.
[18:35.280 --> 18:39.760]  And it's all there. There's a bunch of other big specials on water filtration, air filtration,
[18:39.760 --> 18:45.600]  too many sales and specials to mention them all here today. But whatever you do, go to info
[18:45.600 --> 18:51.840]  or short.com with a story of free shipping and double patriot points and sold out for seven months,
[18:51.840 --> 18:57.600]  DNA force plus with the PQQ and the CoQ 10 that's been sold out is now back in stock 40% off info
[18:57.600 --> 19:05.040]  or store.com. I've been on there 27 years and we've gone through a lot of criticism, a lot of attacks,
[19:05.040 --> 19:10.400]  but also a lot of amazing support. And so that's why I always take time out to thank you for keeping
[19:10.400 --> 19:14.400]  us on there because without you, without the crew, without our sponsors, without our affiliates,
[19:14.400 --> 19:18.720]  without everybody, we would not be on air and the world would be a different place.
[19:18.720 --> 19:24.400]  So it's not a power trip when I realized the great effect we've had. It's really counting
[19:24.400 --> 19:28.880]  the cost and realizing that if we weren't here, if you hadn't have supported us,
[19:29.600 --> 19:33.200]  the whole planet would be in a much worse position with the globalist.
[19:33.200 --> 19:37.360]  Instead, a lot of really, really positive things are happening. And so many of the corrupt things
[19:37.360 --> 19:42.080]  the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open. And so info war credibility
[19:42.080 --> 19:46.400]  is higher than it's ever been. But the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many different
[19:46.400 --> 19:51.120]  attacks. We've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air. It's so expensive. So please get
[19:51.120 --> 19:56.080]  great products and keep info wars on the air at the same time at infowarstore.com. In fact,
[19:56.080 --> 19:59.440]  for the week of Memorial Day, we have for free shipping and double patriot points.
[19:59.440 --> 20:09.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:09.440 --> 20:36.320]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on your mind. And that there certainly is. Okay.
[20:36.320 --> 20:44.560]  If you want next year's news today, you're about to get it. And I don't bring you this information
[20:44.560 --> 20:51.760]  out of speculation. I bring it to you from deep research analysis and basically tracking everything
[20:51.760 --> 20:56.560]  that's going on in the world and having a deep understanding of all the different power players
[20:56.560 --> 20:59.920]  that are involved. So let me give you the bottom line that I'm going to drill into all of it.
[20:59.920 --> 21:05.360]  There is a giant AI run world government corporate system being set up.
[21:05.920 --> 21:11.200]  Communist China is run by these people. It's the model. They want to standardize total tyranny,
[21:11.200 --> 21:17.760]  AI control, global social credit score there. And then they want to sell that as the idea
[21:17.760 --> 21:22.320]  of living a safe and secure life. So the rest of the world basically adopts the same system.
[21:22.320 --> 21:26.640]  But it won't be run by the communist Chinese. We run by the globalist that put the chai comms in
[21:26.640 --> 21:32.560]  power in 1949 and basically launched them for global takeover in the late 1970s.
[21:33.360 --> 21:38.720]  But that's admitted by the CFR, all the rest of this is a fact. That's why Joe Biden has come out
[21:38.720 --> 21:44.720]  in a speech and said China believes it will own America within 15 years. That's not what he really
[21:44.720 --> 21:54.240]  said. The New York Post gets it wrong. He actually said by 2030 or 2035, but he bubbles around that
[21:54.240 --> 22:01.520]  they've now released the transcript. So he says within nine years to 14 years is the real statement,
[22:01.520 --> 22:08.880]  nine to 14 years. But when he says China, he means the globalist. And he says we're a democracy.
[22:08.880 --> 22:14.880]  We have so much freedom. That's the problem. You could do what I say and I'll be a strong man and
[22:14.880 --> 22:21.680]  I could stop G.G. Ping when he's actually running Biden. And notice that statement to Americans
[22:21.680 --> 22:25.200]  sounds like, hey, we better do what Biden says. He's going to protect us from China.
[22:25.200 --> 22:34.240]  But in China and in that area of Asia period to say that they're taking over and that he's a
[22:34.240 --> 22:41.760]  stronger dictator, that is taken by the people as an admission of weakness and incredible praise
[22:41.760 --> 22:48.240]  of G.G. Ping who's got his thumb on Joe Biden and on Hunter. So this is really rubbing it in
[22:48.240 --> 22:52.640]  just as bad as when he was only in office two weeks after selling the election and he was on
[22:52.640 --> 22:57.280]  CNN. We ought to cue that up and play it later if you guys can find it. And he told Anderson Cooper,
[22:58.960 --> 23:04.960]  one of the robber baronaires, he told him that China is just doing what China's got to do for
[23:04.960 --> 23:09.040]  its interior. G. is doing what he has to to protect China, running those death stamps with
[23:09.040 --> 23:14.240]  Uyghurs and taking over Hong Kong. And we're going to stay out of it. And then you saw the
[23:14.240 --> 23:19.680]  Chinese military start really cracking down more in Hong Kong and other areas within a day of that
[23:19.680 --> 23:26.160]  being said. I mean, this is the equivalent of double Chamberlain telling Hitler he could go
[23:26.160 --> 23:35.760]  ahead and invade Czechoslovakia and other areas. So you are seeing incredible developments happen
[23:35.760 --> 23:41.920]  right now and it's amazing. So there's a global power structure that doesn't want China to get
[23:41.920 --> 23:51.200]  too powerful, too quick. Biden's fully controlled. Gates is fully controlled. They are China files.
[23:52.640 --> 23:57.920]  Fauci. That's what they all say. China's good. America's bad. China's the future. They're all
[23:57.920 --> 24:04.400]  invested in China. So they're not even American double agents. They are total China file globalist.
[24:04.400 --> 24:10.320]  That's their group. Then there's other globalist arms. Think of this as back to the Roman Senate
[24:10.320 --> 24:14.880]  and the intrigue that was there thousands of years ago, 2000 years ago. It's very similar,
[24:14.880 --> 24:23.120]  but in a high tech format. In modern format, even more players. And so there's another arm that
[24:23.120 --> 24:28.320]  doesn't like the fact that the globalist tried to push too fast and tried to have China win the
[24:28.320 --> 24:33.200]  global domination fight now. When that's not supposed to happen down the road, all nations
[24:33.200 --> 24:37.920]  are supposed to lose. And then a global corporate system is meant to dominate them in the end.
[24:37.920 --> 24:44.240]  And so the fact that China did purposely leak this with Fauci and with Gates as their economic
[24:44.240 --> 24:48.720]  weapon along with Klaus Schwab, which they basically admitted they've done and China brags
[24:48.720 --> 24:54.640]  that they've won the war in a bio attack, that their response was better than ours.
[24:54.640 --> 25:00.800]  I mean, they've all but said it. There are other groups that have the proof, have the
[25:00.800 --> 25:08.560]  whistleblowers, have the scans of the viruses that they had 16 months ago. But they wanted
[25:08.560 --> 25:12.960]  to have the lockdown and learn to work from home and teach the public live under martial law and
[25:13.600 --> 25:18.560]  push medical IDs and push vaccine passports. They wanted to get all that going worldwide.
[25:18.560 --> 25:24.160]  And everybody used to a QR code and had the banks in control, but they don't want Bill Gates and
[25:24.160 --> 25:30.400]  Fauci and Xi Jinping to be too big for their britches. And so now all this is allowed to come
[25:30.400 --> 25:35.040]  out to say we're going to say it's a leak and we're going to release the fact that it was done on
[25:35.040 --> 25:43.840]  purpose if you don't start singing to the same sheet of music as us. Remember, the global is
[25:43.840 --> 25:47.760]  built up China. They put them in charge, gave them all our jobs, one side of trade policies.
[25:48.720 --> 25:53.840]  For 30 years, China wasn't supposed to go outside the South China Sea. China was supposed to have
[25:53.840 --> 25:59.360]  all the economic development, but the NATO was supposed to be the new military superpower with
[25:59.360 --> 26:05.920]  the U.S. subservient to it in the future, with the U.N. and NATO in charge. But China, of course,
[26:06.880 --> 26:11.440]  double and triple agent and bought up a bunch of the globalists and U.N. operatives. That's why
[26:11.440 --> 26:17.040]  even the Times of London admits, the Financial Times admits that globalism is failing because
[26:17.040 --> 26:25.280]  they all keep in fighting. And so when Biden says, oh, you need to let me be more dictatorial in our
[26:25.280 --> 26:30.000]  democracy, which I mean democracy, to counter China, he's again trying to trick people to go
[26:30.000 --> 26:38.080]  under autocratic technocrats speak so that, quote, we'll be prosperous. Same thing that
[26:38.080 --> 26:43.360]  Trudeau said to a group of women a few years ago, the leader of the Canadians,
[26:44.160 --> 26:50.160]  Justin Trudeau said, I admire the dictatorship of China. I think it's the best political system in
[26:50.160 --> 26:55.920]  the world. Basic dictatorship is what he called it. He said, we need that to be able to make quick
[26:55.920 --> 27:04.560]  decisions. So we're being told autocratic centralized control is the best if you want a bunch of goodies.
[27:04.560 --> 27:10.880]  And the women got quite excited hearing about the aspiring dictator that they were in the room with
[27:10.880 --> 27:16.240]  and became physically aroused, some of them wiggling around in their seats. It was very,
[27:16.240 --> 27:23.200]  very, very bad boyish. Well, that's because his father served under the tutelage of one of the
[27:23.200 --> 27:28.000]  Chinese Communist dictators and received heavy funding from the Communist Chinese. That's actually
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.160]  on record. And so he's basically a China file as well. Trudeau's a China file. The Carnegie
[27:34.160 --> 27:41.680]  Endowment China file now. And the CIA director's a China file. And so they are all kind of like
[27:41.680 --> 27:46.720]  Americans, a lot of them were pro Nazi until World War two started. And they thought Hitler was
[27:46.720 --> 27:52.720]  going to win. And then of course, they all got set up and put in prison or killed. And it's the
[27:52.720 --> 27:59.120]  same thing here is a sophisticated setup going on that will just basically destroy the US China
[27:59.680 --> 28:04.320]  in the end. And Russia knows that. And they don't want to play any part of this world government
[28:04.320 --> 28:10.240]  AI takeover that wants to collapse all society, all civilization, all human systems, and then
[28:10.240 --> 28:16.320]  leave on its ashes a robot controlled global police state with only a few mega cities
[28:17.440 --> 28:22.320]  that are above the law and their own jurisdictions. That's what the Vatican is. That's what Israel
[28:22.320 --> 28:27.040]  is. That's what the city of London is. That's the model where you'll have high tech cities,
[28:27.600 --> 28:32.800]  city states, and then no more nation states. And then the city states will control all trade
[28:32.800 --> 28:38.560]  and systems worldwide. The rest of us basically starving in a collapse civilization. You wait,
[28:38.560 --> 28:43.200]  that's like the hunger games. We'll see that the UN is not copying the hunger games. People read
[28:43.200 --> 28:48.640]  what the UN was planning in their post industrial world. It's actually UN World Law. And it is
[28:48.640 --> 28:53.120]  the hunger games in each country. What's left of it will have one district that's wealthy.
[28:53.120 --> 28:58.240]  Everyone else will be slaves under 10 to 20 30. We'll be back with the rest of the story on the
[28:58.240 --> 29:04.880]  other side. Memorial Day 2021 is here. And that means store wide free shipping and double
[29:04.880 --> 29:10.560]  patriot points at infowarstore.com. And on top of it, a lot of our best selling products that
[29:10.560 --> 29:15.840]  have been sold out for up to six months because of the COVID supply chain problems are finally
[29:15.840 --> 29:20.320]  back in stock. And that's a good thing because these are products that are really good for you
[29:20.320 --> 29:24.080]  and your family, good for your immune system, good for yourselves, good for your body. All of them
[29:24.080 --> 29:30.400]  are amazing, but DNA Force Plus is again the flagship. It's got the PQQ, the CoQ10 and so much
[29:30.400 --> 29:35.600]  more. It helps your telemeters last longer. It cleans out your mitochondria. The list goes on
[29:35.600 --> 29:43.200]  and on. It is 40% off with free shipping and double patriot points. That's an unprecedented deal.
[29:43.200 --> 29:48.800]  What else is back in stock? People are very excited to hear pollen block for seasonal discomfort,
[29:48.800 --> 29:54.400]  for allergies. It's back in stock 40% off as well with a bunch of other items like alpha power and
[29:54.400 --> 30:01.440]  more at infowarstore.com, free shipping and double patriot points for Memorial Day. I'm not going to
[30:01.440 --> 30:06.000]  say this five times in a row to be obnoxious. I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over
[30:06.000 --> 30:14.400]  these criminals. Last week, the arch globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top
[30:14.400 --> 30:20.480]  brass and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it, have taken the so-called COVID
[30:20.480 --> 30:28.000]  19 fragment shot. I'm going to say the second time. Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH
[30:28.000 --> 30:35.120]  refused to take the fragment shots. They don't trust it. You shouldn't trust it. The vaccines
[30:35.120 --> 30:39.360]  have been banned in most countries around the world. This is an attack on the American people,
[30:39.360 --> 30:45.280]  the people of the world. This is an absolute red flag smoking gun. Again, let me say it two more
[30:45.280 --> 30:51.360]  times. Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff refuse to
[30:51.360 --> 30:56.000]  take the vaccines. That's right. The doctors, nurses, and scientists do not trust a so-called
[30:56.000 --> 31:00.960]  vaccine, and you shouldn't either. You should never know about the truth. A lot of virtuous
[31:00.960 --> 31:05.440]  signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how much they care about
[31:05.440 --> 31:10.080]  veterans, but at the same time, they won't stand up for what those veterans and what those troops
[31:10.080 --> 31:16.240]  fought for in the last 250 years of U.S. history. And now more than ever, what our republic stands
[31:16.240 --> 31:22.080]  for and has stood for is under attack. America is under globalist takeover. It's an information
[31:22.080 --> 31:28.320]  war. It is an economic war, but most importantly, it is a spiritual war. And now, of course,
[31:28.320 --> 31:33.840]  it's a biological and chemical war with the vaccines. We were the first to tell you that the
[31:33.840 --> 31:37.760]  virus came out of Wuhan. We were the first to tell you the vaccine passports were coming. We were
[31:37.760 --> 31:42.320]  the first to lay out basically everything because we actually do our research and know what we're
[31:42.320 --> 31:46.160]  talking about. And that's why it's important to keep info wars in the air now more than ever.
[31:46.160 --> 31:50.560]  And for Memorial Day Week, we're having store-wide free shipping and double-paid free of points.
[31:50.560 --> 31:54.880]  A lot of great products are back at stock, like DNA force, alpha power, and pollen block.
[31:54.880 --> 31:58.400]  So to all the veterans and all the patriots we salute you, and I want to ask the listeners,
[31:58.400 --> 32:02.080]  please support info wars now more than ever. I've got some really good news for the viewers and
[32:02.080 --> 32:07.920]  listeners this broadcast. And then I've got some really, really, really, really, really good news. Yes,
[32:07.920 --> 32:11.760]  I could spend an hour telling you about how the globals are getting exposed and how they launched
[32:11.760 --> 32:16.480]  COVID-19 as a bio weapon and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are in. I can even tell you
[32:16.480 --> 32:20.320]  about how the states are turning against the puppet president Biden and saying we're going to
[32:20.320 --> 32:24.320]  have $1,000 five to try to make people wear masks. I could tell you about all of that,
[32:24.320 --> 32:29.440]  but why shouldn't I instead tell you about the super good news concerning the info war?
[32:29.440 --> 32:33.680]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are running right now, the Memorial Day special
[32:33.680 --> 32:40.560]  for the next week only with store-wide free shipping, double-paid free of points, and DNA
[32:40.560 --> 32:47.360]  force plus is back in stock, sold out for seven months, 40% off, supermobile mentality, 50% off,
[32:47.920 --> 32:54.240]  cross to guard, 40% off, alpha power, 50% over 12, 50% as it will be, 50% free shipping and
[32:54.240 --> 32:59.280]  pay three of points, and an OZM4, and it's incredible products, and George Soros hates it! Ha ha!
[33:03.280 --> 33:07.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:07.280 --> 33:23.360]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[33:26.320 --> 33:30.800]  All right, so let me show you these headlines and time all together like I said I would do.
[33:32.320 --> 33:37.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Biden says China believes it will own America
[33:37.120 --> 33:43.840]  within 15 years, that's not what he really said. He said by 2030 or 2035, which is nine to 14 years,
[33:44.560 --> 33:48.800]  and I agree with that statement, but he means China would have been used by the globalists
[33:48.800 --> 33:55.120]  economically, militarily break our back. Then that ties in with this, China establishes
[33:56.240 --> 34:02.000]  company to build satellites, broadband, mega constellation of thousands of satellites,
[34:02.000 --> 34:09.040]  which can also then be hunter-killer satellites and take out western satellites. That's about
[34:09.040 --> 34:16.000]  dominance. And then that ties into this incredibly important stack, genetically modified salmon
[34:16.000 --> 34:23.200]  heads to US dinner plates. It's got insect genes, it's got plant genes in it, it's not even really
[34:23.200 --> 34:29.600]  a salmon, it eats the other salmon, but that's okay. They're all wearing their mask in the photo.
[34:29.600 --> 34:34.160]  Humans are dirty, but GMO salmon, released into the wild, they're good.
[34:36.480 --> 34:42.240]  Dims vote to allow scientists to create animal human hybrids in disturbing move.
[34:43.200 --> 34:47.120]  I first reported that back in the week, people didn't believe it, a few days later,
[34:47.120 --> 34:50.800]  folks went and watched C-SPAN, they were trying to pass a bill to ban it,
[34:51.440 --> 34:55.600]  and the Democrats said no, it's legal, create human animal hybrids.
[34:55.600 --> 35:00.640]  And that leads us to this next point before I go back to the big picture.
[35:02.000 --> 35:08.400]  If you go to infowars.com or newswars.com, you can see the headline for the live
[35:08.400 --> 35:14.880]  feed of the show today that always focuses in on one of the central big points. And there it is,
[35:14.880 --> 35:22.640]  Sunday Live, Biden's EEOC, you know, the guys that fight racism for humanity says forced
[35:22.640 --> 35:31.680]  injections are legal. Overhead shot, please. Companies can make employees take COVID-19
[35:31.680 --> 35:41.040]  vaccine, EEOC says. And saying, if you can't have your job, if somebody can't put a GMO
[35:41.040 --> 35:48.080]  experimental secret potion into you, that's forced. Saying, we'll take your job if you
[35:48.080 --> 35:56.240]  don't do it, that's forced. Terrorism is the threat of violence or actual violence to get a
[35:57.040 --> 36:03.520]  political or economic concession. And to say, I'm going to take all your money away,
[36:03.520 --> 36:10.000]  I'm going to put you on the street. If you don't do what I say, if you don't take our inoculations,
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.480]  you know, the UN 50 years ago said, we're going to have a universal guaranteed income,
[36:14.480 --> 36:19.920]  we're going to control everybody and make people get sterilized. So they even get their
[36:19.920 --> 36:23.920]  goal. And you can argue, well, there are too many people, but you don't want the UN running that.
[36:23.920 --> 36:30.720]  My God, these are murderers. So that's what this is, ladies and gentlemen. And remember,
[36:30.720 --> 36:35.680]  all the left said, nobody's going to make you have a vaccine passport. Nobody's going to make
[36:35.680 --> 36:42.960]  you have a job. That's preposterous. But now it's here. Oh, oh, and they said there's new variants.
[36:42.960 --> 36:48.160]  Sorry, the old shots didn't work. You got to take more. And the deaths are mounting and mounting
[36:48.160 --> 36:54.240]  and mounting. Universal basic income is the answer to the inequalities exposed by COVID-19.
[36:54.240 --> 37:00.640]  That's right. Big tech and big media and big governments say your small business is not essential.
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.520]  So after a few months of lockdown, you got to go get on welfare. And oh, we need more welfare
[37:05.520 --> 37:12.880]  because there's inequity by the very people that are setting it all up. So what do you get from
[37:12.880 --> 37:19.200]  these headlines? Genetically modified salmon had the U.S. dinner plates. And that image right there
[37:19.200 --> 37:25.120]  says it all. Well, here's the scientist showing you they're frank and fish that's twice as big and
[37:25.120 --> 37:29.840]  grows almost twice as fast, but does attack and kill the other salmon. And it's part insect and
[37:29.840 --> 37:34.960]  it's part plant. But that's okay. Who knows what it will do when you eat it? Who knows what viruses
[37:34.960 --> 37:41.840]  it will shed when you splice organisms? Don't worry, the dirty humans are wearing their mask
[37:41.840 --> 37:48.080]  while they introduce this life form. Continuing dims vote to allow scientists to create animal
[37:48.080 --> 37:54.880]  human hybrids in disturbing move western journal.com in disturbing move. I think that says it lightly.
[37:55.680 --> 38:00.720]  This is a revolution against basic common sense, a revolution against our bodies,
[38:00.720 --> 38:08.560]  a revolution against our privacy. Companies can make employees take COVID-19 vaccine.
[38:08.560 --> 38:16.240]  EEOC says so. If you don't hire enough people the right color, this federal agency comes after
[38:16.240 --> 38:21.760]  you. But if you don't want to put some secret concoction for multinational corporations that's
[38:21.760 --> 38:27.840]  been banned in hundreds of countries in your body and your job discriminates against your religious
[38:27.840 --> 38:33.920]  or your economic or just your conscientious objection, you don't trust the big pharma?
[38:33.920 --> 38:41.040]  Never before could they do this, but now the EEOC says so. They're legalizing animal human cloning.
[38:41.040 --> 38:46.400]  They just did it. That's light years, you see, of what you thought they'd do. What have I told
[38:46.400 --> 38:51.200]  you probably a thousand times the last 10 years? You'll wake up one day and they'll announce human
[38:51.200 --> 38:56.560]  clones are legal, animal human clones are legal. I've said that a thousand times in the last five
[38:56.560 --> 39:04.320]  years conservatively. And you woke up last week and the Senate said it's legal because it's already
[39:04.320 --> 39:11.360]  been done. They tried to pass a law to stop it and they fell 10 votes short. It's going on.
[39:13.120 --> 39:17.680]  It's been going on for 50 years, but now they're ready to roll it out. Now they think they've
[39:17.680 --> 39:22.080]  perfected it. So they're like, yeah, we're going to put stuff in your body, you're fired. We're
[39:22.080 --> 39:24.960]  going to put stuff in your body, you can't leave your house. We're going to put stuff in your body
[39:24.960 --> 39:29.600]  or you can't get on a bus or a train. We're going to track it where you go and you're non-essential.
[39:30.640 --> 39:34.880]  But we're going to create salmon that aren't even really salmon. And notice all the world,
[39:34.880 --> 39:38.720]  the same announcement got made the same day. That's the U.S. Here's the U.K.
[39:40.080 --> 39:46.800]  U.K. Minister. U.K. could make COVID-19 jabs compulsory in health care. Minister says always
[39:46.800 --> 39:55.920]  more, more, more. Told you that was coming. And next it'll be in your job, in your area. So now
[39:55.920 --> 40:02.160]  you understand what's going on. This is a revolution. China's been creating animal human
[40:02.160 --> 40:06.240]  clones. They've been creating all sorts of other animal and animal clones. They've been creating
[40:06.240 --> 40:13.280]  these splices like this salmon. There's a bunch of varieties of GMO salmon. And they would never
[40:13.280 --> 40:18.240]  approve in the last few decades because every time they test them in tanks, they kill the other
[40:18.240 --> 40:24.160]  wildlife and other fish and act totally psychotic and then have all sorts of mutations and have
[40:24.160 --> 40:29.200]  all sorts of weird deformed babies and just God knows what it's going to do. But now they just
[40:29.200 --> 40:36.000]  said, you know what? We're doing it. The bottom fell out. Human animal clonings, animal clone
[40:36.000 --> 40:43.360]  clones, splices, chimeras. And then Joe Biden is on the news telling you,
[40:45.520 --> 40:49.360]  well, he'll just meet sandwiches on the news saying, let's go ahead and play a clip of Joe Biden
[40:49.360 --> 40:54.800]  explaining how China's going to win because G.G. Ping's a dictator. Here it is.
[40:56.240 --> 41:00.640]  We're in a battle between democracies and autocracies.
[41:00.640 --> 41:07.840]  The more complicated the world becomes, the more difficult it is for democracies to come together
[41:07.840 --> 41:16.160]  and reach consensus. I've spent more time with President Xi of China than any world leader
[41:16.160 --> 41:25.920]  has for 24 hours of private meetings with him. I just interpreted 17,000 miles traveling in China
[41:25.920 --> 41:34.160]  here. He firmly believes that China before the year 3035 is going to own America
[41:36.480 --> 41:43.920]  because autocracies can make quick decisions. And what he's saying is,
[41:43.920 --> 41:48.960]  dictatorship can make quick decisions just like Trudeau said, when that's not true.
[41:48.960 --> 41:52.240]  I've got a bunch of financial analysis here. It's excellent. We'll cover when we come back
[41:52.240 --> 41:58.000]  about the fact that all the rigging of the markets is what's creating all the disparities
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.600]  and all the problems and all the instability. And they're doing it because they control the
[42:01.600 --> 42:07.680]  instability and it's beyond insider trading. It's manipulating the markets to make the general
[42:07.680 --> 42:12.800]  public poor and the establishment have all the money and currency so they can dictate to us
[42:13.360 --> 42:20.480]  the terms of our surrender. This is economic war. And everything Biden does, shutting off our
[42:20.480 --> 42:25.920]  pipelines, raising the gas prices, bankrupting the border, calling for people that don't add
[42:25.920 --> 42:30.400]  anything to the U.S., pregnant women with children, to come here to weigh down the system,
[42:31.440 --> 42:38.320]  attacking our military, creating all this racism, promoting riots, promoting pedophilia,
[42:38.320 --> 42:43.600]  all of it should demoralize us and bring us down. He's shutting down U.S. pipelines
[42:43.600 --> 42:50.880]  and authorizing Russian pipelines. It's war. Figure it out. He's a globalist chai-com agent.
[42:50.880 --> 42:56.240]  They stole the election. They put him in there to destroy the country. We'll be right back.
[42:59.760 --> 43:04.000]  I always shoot you straight. And when I've told you over the years that if you don't support us,
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.840]  we'll be off the air. It's been true. But info wars has never been in a position
[43:09.840 --> 43:14.640]  where your support is more critical and more vital. The enemy behind the scenes is doing so
[43:14.640 --> 43:19.040]  many things. I'm not going to take time up to whine about it. It's okay. I expect to be attacked
[43:19.040 --> 43:23.840]  because we're over the target. We're having a great effect. We're exposing evil. You're
[43:23.840 --> 43:28.160]  exposing evil. So you spread the word about the broadcast or when you buy products or when you
[43:28.160 --> 43:34.560]  pray for info wars and our talk show hosts and our crew, it is so powerful. So again,
[43:34.560 --> 43:40.640]  as Memorial Day 2021 comes and goes, I want all of you to realize that I appreciate you as being
[43:40.640 --> 43:45.440]  veterans of the info war. And I particularly think our veterans as well that serve the armed forces
[43:45.440 --> 43:50.640]  because they understand what it is to sacrifice and they're needed more now than ever to be leaders
[43:50.640 --> 43:54.800]  in our republic to expose the globalist of a foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right
[43:54.800 --> 43:58.320]  now. So it's a very historical time to be alive. I want to thank you all for your support and ask
[43:58.320 --> 44:03.680]  you to support us again. I share with you the viewers and listeners the facts of where info wars
[44:03.680 --> 44:08.240]  is. And it's always a complex picture, but I do my best to explain to you because you are the
[44:08.240 --> 44:14.320]  patrons that make all this possible. So in short, the world's awakening, the spiral censorship,
[44:14.320 --> 44:19.600]  info wars has never been more influential and has never had a bigger effect exposing the global
[44:19.600 --> 44:25.520]  agenda and fighting it. But that said, the COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains has almost
[44:25.520 --> 44:29.760]  shut us down because most of the best selling products which you want to buy, like DNA Force
[44:29.760 --> 44:34.640]  Plus and others have been sold out for up to seven months. Well, guess what? DNA Force Plus just
[44:34.640 --> 44:40.240]  came back in. Thank God for seven months. It's 40% off. It's amazing at infowarstore.com. And for
[44:40.240 --> 44:45.840]  the week leading up through Memorial Day, we have store wide free shipping and double patriot points
[44:45.840 --> 44:50.880]  and alpha powers back in stock and super mill vitality back in stock and pollen block and vaso

[45:01.600 --> 45:07.200]  to tell you how amazing pollen block is, but you should go to infowarstore.com and read the third
[45:07.200 --> 45:11.040]  party review sites that we have links to where it's got five stars and people love it.
[45:11.680 --> 45:18.160]  Pollen block is a proprietary formula from France where they just learned by happenstance that
[45:18.160 --> 45:24.800]  quail that eat a certain diet produce eggs and eggshells that are amazing when people eat them
[45:24.800 --> 45:30.000]  for knocking out seasonal discomfort or what folks call allergies. It's back in stock. It's
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.800]  been sold out for a long time. It's very hard to get. Despite that, it's 40% off. We have store
[45:34.800 --> 45:39.680]  wide free shipping right now for Memorial Day and double patriot points. So pollen block is back
[45:39.680 --> 45:44.320]  in stock. So is DNA force. So are some of the great products store wide free shipping and your
[45:44.320 --> 45:52.000]  purchase funds the info war. So that is a true 360 win. Get your pollen block today. 40% off free
[45:52.000 --> 45:56.560]  shipping double patriot points to infowarstore.com. And I know you're going to become a regular customer
[45:56.560 --> 46:00.560]  because everybody else has gotten it basically has this stuff really, really works. I've been on
[46:00.560 --> 46:05.840]  there 27 years and we've gone through a lot of criticism, a lot of attacks, but also a lot of
[46:05.840 --> 46:10.960]  amazing support. And so that's why I always take time out to thank you for keeping us on there,
[46:10.960 --> 46:14.960]  because without you, without the crew, without our sponsors, without our affiliates, without
[46:14.960 --> 46:19.280]  everybody, we would not be on the air and the world would be a different place. So it's not a
[46:19.280 --> 46:26.560]  power trip when I realized the great effect we've had. It's really counting the cost and realizing
[46:26.560 --> 46:31.680]  that if we weren't here, if you hadn't supported us, the whole planet would be in a much worse
[46:31.680 --> 46:36.080]  position with the globalist. Instead, a lot of really, really positive things are happening.
[46:36.080 --> 46:40.160]  And so many of the corrupt things the globalist have been involved in are now coming out in the
[46:40.160 --> 46:45.360]  open. And so info wars credibility is higher than it's ever been. But the enemy is trying to shut us
[46:45.360 --> 46:49.360]  down with so many different attacks. We've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air. It's
[46:49.360 --> 46:54.080]  so expensive. So please get great products and keep info wars on the air at the same time
[46:54.080 --> 46:58.480]  at infowarstore.com. In fact, for the week of Memorial Day, we have for one free shipping and
[46:58.480 --> 47:24.240]  double paid for your points. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back to Alex Jones
[47:24.240 --> 47:29.520]  show. Why would ABC News and CNN and all of them come out and say, okay, maybe it did come out of
[47:29.520 --> 47:33.840]  the lab? Because they know there's whistleblowers, they know there's scientists, they know that
[47:33.840 --> 47:39.680]  there's insiders who've been exposing this in the last 16, 17 months. And they know they can't hide it
[47:39.680 --> 47:45.120]  anymore. And so instead, they're going to try to spin it and say it just leaked out of the lab on
[47:45.120 --> 47:51.760]  accident. When Fauci and others funded the game of function and lied to Congress, Fauci needs to be
[47:51.760 --> 47:58.160]  arrested now. Bill Gates who funded it and ran it all needs to be indicted. Or they're going to
[47:58.160 --> 48:03.360]  continue to launch more of these attacks in the future through the UN and use it as a pretext to
[48:03.360 --> 48:10.160]  have the UN run our speech to say what doctors can and can't do to totally control our lives and to
[48:10.160 --> 48:17.360]  give themselves total power and control over the planet. It's an operation lockstep. It's an event
[48:17.360 --> 48:23.280]  201 with Bill Gates that they would use a virus for their takeover. And they've all massively
[48:23.280 --> 48:28.400]  increased their wealth doubling or tripling it because they're essential and we're not. And
[48:28.400 --> 48:35.040]  that's the most important point I want to hit here in just a moment. Because in this article on GMO
[48:35.040 --> 48:44.320]  salmon, now hitting US tables after 20 years of it being blocked is key. I'm going to hit it
[48:44.320 --> 48:53.120]  in a moment. But first, and I mentioned it, let's go ahead and go to ABC's John Carl saying,
[48:53.120 --> 48:57.120]  well, I mean, even if Trump said it, he can be right sometimes. Oh, like the election being
[48:57.120 --> 49:01.840]  stolen. Here it is. And yes, I think a lot of people have egg on their face. This was an idea
[49:02.720 --> 49:08.640]  that was first put forward by Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State, Donald Trump. And look, some
[49:08.640 --> 49:14.960]  things may be true even if Donald Trump said them. And there was because Trump was saying so much
[49:14.960 --> 49:21.920]  else that was just out of control. And because he was, you know, making a frankly racist appeal
[49:21.920 --> 49:28.800]  talking about Kung flu and the China virus, his notion that put forward that this may have,
[49:28.800 --> 49:33.680]  or he said flatly that this came from that lab was widely dismissed. But actually,
[49:34.240 --> 49:37.760]  there's some real reason we don't know, by the way, we still don't know. We absolutely don't
[49:37.760 --> 49:44.160]  know. But now serious people are saying it needs a serious inquiry. Okay, well, number one,
[49:45.600 --> 49:51.360]  you call a virus where it came from. That's why they have these new strains, they call it the
[49:51.360 --> 49:56.400]  British strain or they call it the Brazilian strain, pure bull, you know, the Spanish flu,
[49:56.400 --> 50:00.560]  they thought came out of Spain. So they call it the Spanish flu has nothing to do with the
[50:00.560 --> 50:04.800]  people there. And they know that. But that's how they try to turn everything into a racial issue
[50:04.800 --> 50:12.720]  instead of the science. But here's what we know. They use the fear of the virus to shut down
[50:12.720 --> 50:18.080]  society. They lied about how deadly it was. They promoted the fake PCR test. And anywhere the people
[50:18.080 --> 50:23.600]  don't stand up and demand to be reopened, never reopens like Canada, or Australia,
[50:24.800 --> 50:28.400]  or New Zealand, where they let you off lockdown for a few weeks and go right back on it.
[50:28.400 --> 50:34.160]  Because if you are a service economy person, or you work for a small company, you're nonessential.
[50:34.960 --> 50:39.760]  Well, in the US, we still produce a lot of the world's food and a lot of the world's energy. So
[50:39.760 --> 50:45.200]  as long as those industries have to have humans doing it, those areas will be somewhat open.
[50:46.400 --> 50:51.040]  But if you're in an area where you aren't essential to the globalist, you're done.
[50:51.040 --> 50:57.680]  And of course, that's why we have to, with our energy, only buy and only promote local
[50:58.960 --> 51:05.440]  and regional that is small and medium-sized businesses that have a code of being pro-human.
[51:06.960 --> 51:11.360]  You've heard of fair trade coffee and all this to make sure the villagers get a little bit
[51:11.360 --> 51:15.200]  of money to actually be able to have a decent life. Absolutely. That's a great idea. But let's
[51:15.200 --> 51:23.040]  go away further of pro-human trade. Sustainable doesn't mean get rid of the humans. Real sustainability
[51:23.040 --> 51:28.160]  means building a clean, good, healthy earth that also helps humans be clean and healthy.
[51:28.160 --> 51:33.840]  The globalists just want to engineer a collapse that they control to massively reduce population
[51:33.840 --> 51:40.000]  on the ashes of it, build a very high-tech technology. And we're showing you footage of
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.480]  Australia where they beat people in Germany, where they beat people with clubs in Spain,
[51:44.480 --> 51:48.800]  with water cannons and dogs for trying to go outside to the park.
[51:54.560 --> 51:58.400]  That's what happens in Australia. That's what happens in New Zealand. That's what happens in
[51:58.400 --> 52:02.160]  Germany. That's what happens in the UK. And now they're on the news in the UK saying,
[52:02.160 --> 52:08.320]  oh, a million people marched again for opening the economy. You're dumb. We're already open.
[52:08.320 --> 52:14.000]  Oh, at 25% capacity, got to wear a mask. You got to show a QR code to get in places.
[52:14.000 --> 52:20.640]  Oh, they promised that wouldn't happen. Remember? Again, they're not creeping up
[52:20.640 --> 52:25.040]  to a takeover anymore. That was all beta. Now it's, hey, you're going to eat GMO salmon.
[52:25.040 --> 52:29.440]  Hey, the borders are wide open. Hey, we waive the laws. No background checks on who we give.
[52:29.440 --> 52:34.320]  One-year-old babies thrown over a wall. They're just given to some fake Catholic charity and
[52:34.320 --> 52:37.600]  then delivered to known smugglers' hands and then disappeared.
[52:37.600 --> 52:44.720]  Human animal clones legalized last Tuesday by the US Senate.
[52:49.920 --> 52:57.040]  And you notice that no law had to be signed because they're already doing it. They wouldn't
[52:57.040 --> 53:02.080]  pass a law to prohibit it. Possessions, not intense law. They're just doing it.
[53:02.080 --> 53:06.320]  They're just telling your kids to wear a mask and teach them a non-essential.
[53:06.320 --> 53:09.600]  They're just having convicted pedophiles dressed like women come in and have your
[53:09.600 --> 53:14.560]  son bounce on their knee at public school. They're just teaching Satanism. They're just pushing
[53:14.560 --> 53:18.640]  partial birth abortion and keeping the babies alive until they get a list of who wants the
[53:18.640 --> 53:26.480]  organs and get top dollar. They're doing it all. It's their satanic globalist revolution against us.
[53:28.160 --> 53:32.240]  Where they teach us to not value each other, where they teach us to not be able to have
[53:32.240 --> 53:37.280]  anything labeled like the GMO Franken shots. They've got legislation where from now on,
[53:37.280 --> 53:41.360]  there won't be anything on vaccines or drugs of any type. There won't be an insert.
[53:41.360 --> 53:44.480]  There won't be adverse reactions. They'll just do whatever they want,
[53:44.480 --> 53:50.960]  just like 5G and all the studies gives you cancer. This is an anti-human revolution
[53:50.960 --> 53:54.960]  where they got so many things killing us, no one ever knows exactly what got you.
[53:56.080 --> 53:59.280]  But let me show you the key in this article, hidden in this AP article.
[53:59.280 --> 54:04.880]  Genetically modified salmon at the U.S. dinner plates. Oh, it's so nice.
[54:06.400 --> 54:14.080]  Indianapolis, AP, the inaugural harvest of genetically modified salmon begins this week
[54:14.080 --> 54:18.000]  after the pandemic delayed the sale. You mean the martial law worldwide drill
[54:19.680 --> 54:24.880]  of the first such altered salmon to be cleared for human consumption in the United States.
[54:24.880 --> 54:32.480]  Trump wouldn't clear it, but don't worry, Biden did. The CEO of the company
[54:33.840 --> 54:40.720]  says several times of the engineered biotech company, AquaBounty Technology Zinc,
[54:40.720 --> 54:44.400]  will now head to restaurants and away from home dining services,
[54:44.400 --> 54:51.200]  where labeling as genetically engineered is not required. Oh, the only area where
[54:51.200 --> 54:56.320]  there's not a law that you've got to have it, and they're not going to tell you.
[54:58.880 --> 55:04.000]  In the Midwest and along the East Coast, they're going to bomb you with this stuff.
[55:04.000 --> 55:09.040]  Continuing, thus far, the only customer to announce it is selling the salmon,
[55:09.040 --> 55:13.200]  is Samuels and Sun Seafood, a Philadelphia-based seafood distributor.
[55:13.920 --> 55:18.000]  Well, here's what you tell people. You hang a sign up saying, we don't have GMO.
[55:18.000 --> 55:24.560]  Animals. And by the way, this thing's got insects in it. It's got plant genes in it.
[55:24.560 --> 55:29.920]  The mutations, the top sign is that this is insane. Who knows what zoological mutations of
[55:29.920 --> 55:33.760]  viruses you're going to get out of this. I mean, look what you got in the Pfizer shot,
[55:33.760 --> 55:38.320]  jellyfish, and the entire human genome. People ask, what's that for? We're not going to tell you.
[55:38.320 --> 55:48.560]  And the EEOC says, your employer can make you take it. No, they can't. The EEOC is a Nazi
[55:48.560 --> 55:52.960]  organization, but it runs around saying it's fighting racism all day because they want to
[55:52.960 --> 55:58.720]  fight with each other while humans are being annihilated. But there's the answer to the
[55:58.720 --> 56:06.880]  genetically modified creature. It's not even a salmon. It's an insectoid, spliced chimera
[56:06.880 --> 56:16.000]  abomination. The answer is refused it. The answer is demand labeling laws. The answer is say no.
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.640]  But instead, what is the club of Rome? And it's offshoot, say, every day on every channel.
[56:21.520 --> 56:27.600]  Klaus Schwab and the Davos Group. You will eat bugs. You will drink sewage. You will eat weeds.
[56:27.600 --> 56:31.840]  And you will like it. And now all these liberal states are legalizing bugs and saying,
[56:31.840 --> 56:36.080]  we're going to put it on school lunch tables. You're like, they won't do that. Really,
[56:36.080 --> 56:40.320]  they send pedophiles into your schools. Oh, really? They legalize human animal cloning.
[56:41.120 --> 56:47.360]  Oh, really? Yes, they will. Because you won't say no. And everyone's been preconditioned when we
[56:47.360 --> 56:52.640]  warned about this. It's like we walk into the Austin City Council with top scientists,
[56:53.760 --> 56:59.760]  heads of university departments saying fluoride causes brain damage and lower IQ and just low
[56:59.760 --> 57:03.680]  levels when it's added to water supplies and the mayor just laughs and says, I'm going to turn
[57:03.680 --> 57:10.160]  my mic off. I'm not listening to you. And the mayor leaves. They just laugh at you. You're
[57:10.160 --> 57:15.120]  going to drink sewage. You're going to eat bugs. You're going to eat GMO. You're going to eat plant,
[57:15.120 --> 57:19.280]  animal, spliced animals. And we're going to radiate you with 5Gs. And this is how it is.
[57:20.480 --> 57:25.680]  No, we as consumers say no. We'll never shop or buy from anybody again. And everybody better
[57:25.680 --> 57:30.640]  tell you of their service crap. Or we're going to sue your ass. We've got to get aggressive
[57:30.640 --> 57:35.600]  and say no and stand up for humans and the earth or it's all over. That's what I tell you to ban
[57:35.600 --> 57:40.000]  carbon dioxide all day long. It's what plants breathe. So while you're worried about carbon
[57:40.000 --> 57:45.440]  dioxide, they're Frankensteining the entire planet with a genetic alien takeover basically.
[57:45.440 --> 57:54.400]  We'll be right back with hour number two. I'm giving you a status report on what your support
[57:54.400 --> 58:00.320]  of info wars has done. We are kicking globalist ass up and down the planet right now. They're
[58:00.320 --> 58:06.000]  entire agenda of depopulation, poison vaccines. It's all coming out. And yes, I'm risking my life
[58:06.000 --> 58:10.160]  and yes, this is very dangerous. But it's worth it. I'm very honored to be in the fight. So thanks
[58:10.160 --> 58:15.760]  for keeping me in the fight and our great crew during info wars. And here's the other good news.

[59:48.000 --> 1:00:14.720]  double Patriot points for Memorial Day. All right. Chris Sky has been arrested. He's just
[1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:19.440]  a well-spoken activist. Wanted Canada to be reopened. He said over a year ago it wouldn't
[1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:24.640]  be reopened in a viral video. He's been proven dead on and subsequent videos. He's joining us.
[1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:29.360]  They sent police to his house when he dare go to the grocery store and interview people about
[1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:34.880]  the lockdown. The level of tyranny you will live under is the exact level you will accept,
[1:00:34.880 --> 1:00:41.200]  to quote Thomas Jefferson. I did not plug any last hour. And if I don't plug, we're not going to be
[1:00:41.200 --> 1:00:45.760]  here because we were in the red the first five months of the year because a bunch of our best
[1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:52.000]  selling products would not come in because of the COVID fake lockdowns, warehouses, supply
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:56.720]  change totally broke down. And you're seeing supply chain problems everywhere, food prices
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:03.360]  increase, supplement prices increase, lumber prices, steel prices triple. And this is just the beginning
[1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:08.880]  because now people milk it where if one person gets tested at a company for COVID,
[1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:13.040]  even though they're not sick, the whole company just shuts down. Well, China never shut down.
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:18.640]  So they're taking over the planet and they've doubled and tripled their profits and we're
[1:01:18.640 --> 1:01:24.480]  falling apart. So we finally got a bunch of the products in seven months since DNA Force Plus was
[1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:29.920]  in. A whole bunch of times and some of the other products like pollen block, I forget how many
[1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:34.000]  months, seasonal discomfort, allergies, it's all natural, it's amazing, people love it.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  It comes from quail eggs, not the eggs itself, the quail shell from a specially
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:45.440]  type of quail, not GMO, it's a special type of quail, fed a special diet. It's a French
[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:49.520]  secret they discovered in the last 50 years and it creates some type of natural antihistamine.
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:56.240]  People love it. Well, it's been sold out. We have store-wide free shipping
[1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:03.600]  and double patriot points for the first time this year and 40% off on DNA Force,
[1:02:03.600 --> 1:02:09.040]  40% off on pollen block, 50% off on Ultra 12. Now, you'll talk about natural clean energy,
[1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:12.880]  you can take Turbo Force all day long, it's great, it's amazing, 10 hours of clean energy.
[1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:17.840]  But Ultra 12, good vitamin B12 from a good organic source, taken under the tongue,
[1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:22.880]  is the platform for your entire body's operation and it tastes sweet naturally.
[1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:30.480]  That's what real B12 tastes like. It's back in stock, 50% off. So these are all amazing products
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:37.600]  and they're all priced very low for the quality you're getting. I could buy a crappy type of
[1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:43.760]  PQQ or CoQ10 for half the cost, but the studies show it doesn't get absorbed by your cells,
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:47.840]  it doesn't get into your mitochondria, it doesn't get into your telomeres and have them last longer.
[1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:54.240]  And telomeres like a candle is your DNA strands. When they stop dividing, you die. The cell dies
[1:02:54.240 --> 1:02:59.040]  and every time a cell divides, the telomeres get shorter. It's how many times it can replicate.
[1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:04.240]  Well, you're even allowed to say with all the discrimination against supplements out there
[1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:10.000]  with PQQ and CoQ10 that they do that because they do. Nerve growth factor, all of it is in there,
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:14.880]  it's back in stock, a flagship product. I mean, it's our number one seller when we can get it.
[1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:18.960]  But because it's pharmaceutical, they call it nutraceutical grade,
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:23.040]  we have a lot of trouble always getting it in anyways, as you know. So it's sold out for a few
[1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:27.120]  months, a few times a year. It's been sold out for almost seven months. It's back in stock,
[1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:31.760]  but I'm still doing 40% off for those that haven't tried it for all the regulars. I know you
[1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:36.160]  would buy a lot of it. That's great. And it's going to go back to full price in about a week.
[1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:40.320]  We've got this Memorial Day special. I'm going to extend it through next week,
[1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:45.840]  except some of the products are so close to selling out or it's going to be so long we get it back
[1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:50.880]  in, they'll go back to regular price before we sell out. So DNA Force Plus may go back to regular
[1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:57.600]  price or maybe 10% off, sort of 40% off coming up here by Wednesday or so because it really is
[1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:04.400]  an amazing product and it's very expensive for us to make it. I mean, to have the real ingredients,
[1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:08.960]  these nutraceutical grade ingredients in it is very, very expensive. I mean, little mini
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:14.640]  bottles of it that are the crap type are like $40 a piece just for PQQ or CoQ10. It's the PQQ
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:21.280]  that costs the most. So that is available and it funds the operation infowarstore.com. We've got a
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:28.720]  lot of new t-shirts in that I have not designed but told people these are my concepts. That's why
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:32.000]  some of the shirts aren't that good. Some are amazing. I'm the main guy that does the concepts
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:36.800]  for them. We've got a bunch of new shirts at infowarstore.com. We really like them and that
[1:04:36.800 --> 1:04:40.800]  helps spread the word as well. So be sure and check those out. I want to thank you all for your
[1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:48.320]  support. We'll be right back with Chris Sky and then I've got a bunch of other news. Did you hear?
[1:04:48.320 --> 1:04:54.080]  The military's announced a plan to disarm the military. Yep, that's 7277. Stay with us.
[1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:03.520]  A lot of virtuous signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how much
[1:05:03.520 --> 1:05:07.920]  they care about veterans but at the same time they won't stand up for what those veterans and what
[1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:13.760]  those troops fought for in the last 250 years of U.S. history and now more than ever what our
[1:05:13.760 --> 1:05:19.840]  republic stands for and it stood for is under attack. America is under globalist takeover.
[1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:26.160]  It's an information war. It is an economic war but most importantly it is a spiritual war and now
[1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:32.320]  of course it's a biological and chemical war with the vaccines. We were the first to tell you that
[1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:36.320]  the virus came out of Wuhan. We were the first to tell you the vaccine passports were coming. We
[1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:40.800]  were the first to lay out basically everything because we actually do our research and know what
[1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:44.800]  we're talking about and that's why it's important to keep info wars in the air now more than ever
[1:05:44.800 --> 1:05:49.440]  and for Memorial Day week we're having store wide free shipping and double patriot points. A lot of
[1:05:49.440 --> 1:05:54.720]  great products are back in stock like DNA force alpha power and pollen block. So to all the veterans
[1:05:54.720 --> 1:06:09.120]  and all the patriots we salute you and I want to ask the listeners please support them for worse now more than ever.
[1:06:09.120 --> 1:06:25.280]  Live from Austin Texas it's Alex Jones. So I predicted this 16 months ago on air because I was
[1:06:25.280 --> 1:06:34.000]  reading the Rockefeller Foundation documents ladies and gentlemen and I was reading all the other
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:42.960]  Bill Gates union war games like Crimson contagion event 201 and right there they said we're creating
[1:06:42.960 --> 1:06:50.080]  a new society a new civilization where the general public is non-essential where we train people to
[1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:57.120]  have less for the environment. This is about carbon and cutting carbon to save the earth from
[1:06:57.120 --> 1:07:03.920]  global warming. This is not about the virus and Bill Gates has said that Klaus Schwab has said that.
[1:07:04.080 --> 1:07:12.400]  They have all said that over and over and over again and so if you look at Australia or you
[1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:17.680]  look at areas of Europe like Germany and Spain or the UK they're still locked down. They have police
[1:07:17.680 --> 1:07:22.880]  horses running over women and children. They're beating people ability clubs. This is all about
[1:07:22.880 --> 1:07:27.200]  the general public becoming prisoners learning to be locked in your house. I was talking to Craig
[1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:33.120]  Jones who's the number two grappler in the world at this big grappling deal. I went to Friday night
[1:07:33.120 --> 1:07:38.800]  with Joe Rogan here in Austin and he was on the show but he was talking about it after his fight
[1:07:38.800 --> 1:07:47.040]  that he won a record 60 seconds. We went and had a beer and he was talking about how his town
[1:07:47.040 --> 1:07:52.560]  in Australia where he lives has gone back on lockdown Melbourne and how when you fly in for
[1:07:52.560 --> 1:07:58.240]  14 days they lock you in a hotel room you can't leave the room for 14 days. Not even an hour
[1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:07.040]  like a prisoner gets 23 in one hour. This is all prisoner training and so once they train you to
[1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:12.080]  do it once they give you the tracker chips and the face scans and social credit score it's game
[1:08:12.080 --> 1:08:21.040]  over. That's the admitted plan. Well Chris Sky who's just a businessman and a patriot up in
[1:08:21.040 --> 1:08:28.800]  Canada he predicted all of this last year and now everything he said came true. I want to play a
[1:08:28.800 --> 1:08:34.240]  clip of him almost a year ago predicting all of this because he had a document that's now been
[1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:38.000]  confirmed of how they were never going to get rid of the lockdowns how they'd have lockdown three
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:44.560]  and then lockdown four they're now going under the next lockdown. They're arresting pastors,
[1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:51.120]  closing churches but Walmart and Target are open because they are essential. This is total
[1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:56.160]  corporate takeover tyranny and then we'll talk about one of the premiers up in Canada.
[1:08:56.160 --> 1:09:02.160]  Mr. Ford who tells people this is basically going to be permanent you can't have one case so they've
[1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:07.920]  got to do this. One case of something that's totally exaggerated in the PCR test are almost
[1:09:07.920 --> 1:09:13.920]  completely fake so Chris Sky always has a lot to say but let's hear from him last year predicting
[1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:19.520]  exactly what happened. Clients because they know Canadians like to do what they're told so they
[1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:23.600]  tell you have to wear a mask next they're going to tell you have to contact trace then they're
[1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:27.360]  going to tell you you have to take the vaccine and because Canadians like to do what they're told
[1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:32.320]  they're hoping that everyone just complies and then guess what kids once you take your vaccine
[1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:37.440]  like a dumb person that doesn't know any better they're going to tell you sorry the vaccine isn't
[1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:41.440]  as effective as we thought it was going to be so now you still got to wear your mask still
[1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:45.840]  got to get contact trace still have all the restrictions and social distancing and still
[1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:54.640]  take your vaccine. There you go and we're going to go to him here in just a moment but I wanted
[1:09:54.640 --> 1:10:03.200]  to play that clip of one of the premiers Mr. Ford talking about martial law just a few months ago
[1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:09.680]  so the people understand exactly what's going on so this is the Ontario government Doug Ford
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:15.360]  announcing an extended province wide stay-at-home order and new restrictions that's called martial
[1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:21.360]  law including checkpoints where they ask where you're going here it is. So effective immediately
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:29.120]  we're extending the emergency declaration and prolonging the stay-at-home order province wide
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:36.720]  for an additional two weeks for a total of six weeks. Outdoor gatherings will now be strictly
[1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:44.880]  limited to members of your own household only anyone who lives alone can join with one other
[1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:52.160]  household. We'll be closing all non-essential construction we're restricting all outdoor
[1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:57.760]  recreational amenities such as golf courses basketball courts soccer fields and playgrounds
[1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:06.400]  we're reducing capacity in big box retail even further to 25 percent beginning on Monday places
[1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:15.440]  of worship will be capped at a maximum of 10 people indoors. To get ahead of the variants that are
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:23.200]  plaguing western Canada beginning Monday we're setting up checkpoints at all interprovincial
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:30.320]  borders we'll be limiting access to border crossings between Ontario and the provinces of
[1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:37.280]  Manitoba and Quebec with exceptions such as work medical care or transportation of goods
[1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:44.160]  and we're calling on the federal government to immediately tighten up our international borders
[1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:50.960]  we're currently facing the devastating consequences okay that's enough now now we know
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:55.120]  they lot about the PCR test if you haven't had the vaccine they turn up to 40 to make you false
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:12:00.080]  positive 94 percent of the time they admit that your times if you've had the vaccine but of course
[1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:05.600]  you're sick from it they will turn it down to 28 so that you'll get all false negatives Chris
[1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:10.960]  Guy joins us because people need to not go back to sleep in Texas in Florida and even New York
[1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:16.800]  basically you'll back open now and understand that the next phases are coming and that the beta test
[1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:21.360]  is Canada and other areas if you're a radio listener we're rolling footage of Germans being
[1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:27.680]  attacked with water cannons women's being women's heads being split open in the UK giant Clydesdales
[1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:34.160]  running over women almost killing women uh just beating people with billy clubs arresting children
[1:12:34.160 --> 1:12:39.120]  people arrested walking their dogs German shepherds attacking families I mean this is just and it's
[1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:44.400]  all you indirected world government in the name of saving us from something that is pure bull
[1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:49.760]  you have just also been arrested and got out of jail Chris Guy thanks for joining us thank you for
[1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:54.080]  having me once again this is a very important broadcast because we had a lot of important
[1:12:54.080 --> 1:12:58.720]  information that we were getting out to the public and the number one thing they were trying to do
[1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:03.520]  was stop me from going on tour again because our last tour was so successful we called it
[1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:08.000]  the freedom convoy tour and I had to drive all the way to Vancouver because they put me on the no
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:12.560]  fly list and we drove from Vancouver all the way to Montreal and when we ended up in Montreal on
[1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:18.800]  May 1st there were 300,000 people on the streets with me marching in solidarity to end these
[1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:22.400]  lockdowns and the government didn't want anybody to know about that and the last thing the government
[1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:27.760]  wanted was a repeat of that and so when I when I told everybody that I was doing a repeat tour
[1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:31.920]  and we were calling it the just say no tour to launch my new book which is right here just say
[1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:38.720]  no oh sorry it's upside down uh they did everything they could to stop me first of all they arrested
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:43.920]  me the day before I was supposed to leave to go to Vancouver thinking it was going to stop me I
[1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:48.800]  got out of jail that very same day I had to make alternate arrangements to leave to make it there
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:56.080]  I had I left at Friday at midnight to get to Vancouver at Sunday at 2 p.m which was over
[1:13:56.080 --> 1:14:02.320]  5,000 kilometers or roughly 3,500 mile drive and with the help of patriots around Canada we had
[1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:07.600]  nine different cars take us from place to place to place including a helicopter to get us there on
[1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:12.640]  time and then the day before my book was supposed to go on sale which was May 25th it was supposed
[1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:17.920]  to go on sale at Amazon books Amazon announced for the very first time ever in history that this
[1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:25.600]  book right here just say no is the first book in history to be banned by Amazon the day before it
[1:14:25.600 --> 1:14:30.560]  was to go on sale they tried to do that to stop me to uh because they tried to stop me from going
[1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:35.440]  by making me in jail that didn't work they tried to stop me from going by making it so I can't drive
[1:14:35.440 --> 1:14:41.600]  I can't fly they confiscated all my legally owned firearms and weapons uh they made so I had to stay
[1:14:41.600 --> 1:14:46.560]  with my bail surety who actually comes on tour with me thankfully so that's the only reason I
[1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:50.960]  was allowed to do this tour and then even when I went on tour I was supposed to make a stop in Winnipeg
[1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:58.160]  Manitoba our governments are now so corrupt so lawless that they got a preemptive warrant for
[1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:03.760]  me and four other people before the event even happened so now in Canada they can give you arrest
[1:15:03.760 --> 1:15:07.920]  warrants for things you have not even done all right stay there let's explain this is all you
[1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:13.920]  indirected the UN puts out a statement big tech enforces it with the police and the model is Canada
[1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:18.480]  coming to america next to literally with a guy with no criminal record try to arresting you
[1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:23.280]  attacking you for traveling around saying let's end this lockdown in germany they're trying to pass
[1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:29.680]  a law five years in prison if you criticize the lockdown yes folks australia similar things facebook
[1:15:29.680 --> 1:15:35.600]  banned members of parliament from facebook in australia if they criticize the lockdown and you
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:40.400]  saw the big tech whistleblowers on this show and dr. Carlson last week from facebook where they say
[1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:45.760]  when someone tells the truth that's who they particularly banned and so facebook by the way
[1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:50.320]  spies on people in europe and calls the police on them and they get arrested live on facebook
[1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:53.760]  this is serious because what they're doing is criminal they've got to suppress our speech
[1:15:53.760 --> 1:16:00.480]  showing our speak is powerful stay with us a lot of virtue signalers out there will tell you how
[1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:05.120]  much they care about troops and how much they care about veterans but at the same time they won't
[1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:10.560]  stand up for what those veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of us
[1:16:10.560 --> 1:16:16.080]  history and now more than ever what our republic stands for and it stood for is under attack
[1:16:16.080 --> 1:16:21.680]  america is under globalist takeover it's an information war it is an economic war but most
[1:16:21.680 --> 1:16:28.480]  importantly it is a spiritual war and now of course it's a biological and chemical war
[1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:32.800]  with the vaccines we were the first to tell you that the virus came out a little while we were the
[1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:37.440]  first to tell you that vaccine passports were coming we're the first to lay out basically
[1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:41.360]  everything because we actually do our research know what we're talking about and that's why it's

[1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:51.120]  and they're needed more now than ever to be leaders in our republic to expose the globalism
[1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:54.800]  of foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right now so it's a very historical time to be

[1:20:21.760 --> 1:20:26.960]  canada looked into him and the last year he's become one of the leading voices traveling around
[1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:32.320]  the world europe you name it exposing what was coming off the un zone documents and that's
[1:20:32.320 --> 1:20:38.000]  really what blows people away this is all a un worldwide drill for a bio weapon being released
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:42.240]  they released a real gain of function virus doesn't kill many people but it is the chimeras
[1:20:42.240 --> 1:20:46.720]  scientists knew that when they first looked at it over a year ago we told you we're vindicated
[1:20:46.720 --> 1:20:50.880]  and we told you more lockdowns are coming and even in places like texas where the lockdowns
[1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:55.120]  pretty much ended they're planning on bringing it back if the truth doesn't come out so you
[1:20:55.120 --> 1:21:02.080]  heard chris sky who has been arrested harassed had 30 police cars come to his house because he dared
[1:21:02.080 --> 1:21:07.520]  you know go walk around the supermarket and interview people they don't want people communicating
[1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:12.480]  and they admit they want to want anyone but the un being able to have this speech and the left is
[1:21:12.480 --> 1:21:19.360]  called for anti lockdown protesters to be arrested but they've been attacking them all over the world
[1:21:19.360 --> 1:21:25.360]  germany england you name it and so just absolutely criminal activity but i know doug ford when he
[1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:30.800]  called for martial law he did another lockdown i know that he was very unpopular he later had to
[1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:36.960]  apologize so chris guy you've got a lot to say you fill this in on the harassment then try to stop
[1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:43.200]  you getting your book out just like you'd be banned on facebook if you criticized and said we think
[1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:48.240]  it came from his lab you know now you're allowed to amazon's been attacking a lot of publishers
[1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:53.600]  uh that that you know that say covid is manufactured but now they're saying the day before you were
[1:21:53.600 --> 1:21:59.840]  going to put this on amazon that no you can't sell your evil book incredible yeah and they didn't
[1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:04.000]  even give me a reason they basically said they're just reserving the right to say no which is a
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:08.080]  hilarious because that's the title of the book and they had no problems with it prior to that i
[1:22:08.080 --> 1:22:11.440]  did all the paperwork i talked to all the representatives i did everything they want so
[1:22:11.440 --> 1:22:16.000]  now the only place that the book is available is either in in person when i'm on tour and
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:22.320]  bought to people have been buying or on my website real chris sky dot com i urge everybody to not
[1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:25.840]  just buy it for them but buy it for someone who doesn't understand what's really going on buy it
[1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:30.880]  for someone who's on the fence and just needs to know to have their to have that to have that
[1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:35.120]  inspiration and that knowledge that will give them the hope that they need to get through this
[1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:39.200]  because this this book is it'll do that for people that are awake it'll give them the inspiration
[1:22:39.200 --> 1:22:43.120]  and the knowledge to speak out further for people that are on the fence and have questions they
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:47.280]  won't have questions after they read this book and for people that haven't even asked questions for
[1:22:47.280 --> 1:22:51.680]  people that are still sitting at home with two mats on waiting for this to be over waiting for
[1:22:51.680 --> 1:22:55.680]  the government to give them their freedom back this book will do what the government is more
[1:22:55.680 --> 1:23:00.480]  afraid of than anything it will get people to ask questions this book has the ability to spark a
[1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:05.440]  national and even international conversation i totally agree and they're also trying to censor
[1:23:05.440 --> 1:23:11.360]  a very important book put up a medical doctor um mercola that's an info or sort of com guys put
[1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:14.960]  that up they've been trying to censor this book as well but we have it in stock the truth about
[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:22.400]  covid-19 book exposing covid-19 the great reset lockdowns vaccine passports of the new normal
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:27.680]  everyone has to get chris sky's book at his site everybody's got to get this it's an information
[1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:33.440]  war and i just told chris because their printer's printing more right now i'm gonna buy 10 000 of
[1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:38.400]  his book and sell it at infowarstore.com because knowledge is power and we got to circumvent
[1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:45.120]  these censors again chris explain what's happening in canada church is still closed walmart oh my god
[1:23:45.760 --> 1:23:50.880]  it's absolutely disgusting i actually went to pastor arts church in the calgary the fame pastor
[1:23:50.880 --> 1:23:55.680]  i was i was privileged enough to even speak there and then i watched him get arrested
[1:23:55.680 --> 1:24:01.520]  straight up nazi style on the middle of the highway on his knees carried away by multiple police
[1:24:01.520 --> 1:24:07.200]  officers now they're issuing warrants in places like manitoba to organizers of events before the
[1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:14.160]  events even happened this is literal pre-crime in on on display i have a warrant out for my arrest
[1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:21.040]  apparently in manitoba for a play for an event i never even went to this is absolute lunacy and
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:25.200]  they're doing it because they can this is the this is what i was talking about the nazi arrest of the
[1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:31.120]  pastor and we've seen other pastors get arrested but we've seen wonderful institutions like the jccf
[1:24:31.120 --> 1:24:35.200]  justice center for constitutional freedoms standing up for people like myself standing up for people
[1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:39.200]  like the pastor they actually took on my no fly case and they're going to be working on it
[1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:43.760]  and they had some they filed injunctions against multiple governments against these illegal measures
[1:24:43.760 --> 1:24:48.240]  that they're pulling the governments aren't even cutting corners right now these aren't police officers
[1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:55.200]  these are beyond nazis these are the enemy they are 100 the police officers are more than like on
[1:24:55.200 --> 1:25:00.240]  our side when i talk to police officers i'm the good cops are good i mean the cops that follow
[1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:06.960]  orders to close churches are our serving satan 100 and they know it and they get and and a lot
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:11.760]  of cases they have to hire third party people to do this because the the actual police department
[1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:16.560]  themselves won't so when you're in a protest in toronto and you see this huge bus and these
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:21.600]  guys get off the bus and they're wearing like swat style gear and they have police like vests on
[1:25:21.600 --> 1:25:26.080]  these guys aren't even real police officers they're basically glorified security guards
[1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:29.680]  that they put in police like uniform they don't even have guns or anything like that
[1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:33.440]  but they've been given arrest powers and these are the kind of guys that have the bad attitude
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:37.200]  these are the kind of guys that are looking for trouble and that's why they unleash them on protesters
[1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:40.800]  because they want to agitate they want to cause violence they want to cause a division and again
[1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:46.400]  they put black tarps up around huge churches for months put hundreds of police there and let no one
[1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:52.480]  go in major churches down the streets from topless bars that aren't open that's right and i could
[1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:55.840]  tell you why they don't want people at churches because i was there at pastor arch church and when
[1:25:55.840 --> 1:26:00.640]  people are there they feel hopeful they feel togetherness they feel unity they feel everything
[1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:04.880]  that you need in order to get through this and in order to fight back and the government wants
[1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:10.560]  you to feel isolated hopeless despair and that's why they hate this more than anything because not
[1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:15.680]  only does it expose all their lives it empowers you to stand up for yourself it gives you the
[1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:20.320]  knowledge it gives you the power it gives you the courage and you got to go to realchristguy.com
[1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:24.880]  and get it and it's going to be available like he said on his on his site soon i'm really excited
[1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:29.440]  about that because i need this book to get into everybody but listen i want to get listen i want
[1:26:29.440 --> 1:26:32.560]  to get a hundred thousand of these out of what you and i were even talking about after you sell an
[1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:35.840]  additional amount just be able to fund yourself on this term we're talking about selling them
[1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:39.520]  basically at cost because we need millions of these books to get out ladies and gentlemen
[1:26:39.520 --> 1:26:43.840]  this is a total war so chris continue for folks that don't know people like oh who cares about
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:49.280]  canada or australia this is all you indirectly the same stuff is coming here why are they keeping
[1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:55.280]  canada permanently locked down why are they saying germany may never reopen very simple canada is the
[1:26:55.280 --> 1:26:59.840]  prize on the worldwide state if you're a super villain and you wanted to take over any country
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:05.840]  in the world that you could canada is the prize the largest landmass unlimited amount of resources
[1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:10.800]  and the smallest weakest population you can imagine and that's why we have the worst lockdown
[1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:14.960]  because we don't have the balls we don't have the fortitude we don't have the freedom loving
[1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:19.760]  instincts of some place like florida or texas and that's why i tell every canadian the government
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:23.920]  didn't close your business you closed your business and you're keeping it closed the government didn't
[1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:28.480]  put a mask on your children you did the government didn't put a mask on you you're putting it on
[1:27:28.480 --> 1:27:32.880]  yourself every day and canadians are the best of the world at making excuses they want to be called
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:36.480]  the nicest people in the world and our government loves to push that around the world canadians
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:41.440]  are nice the origin of the world nice in latin is ignorant and naive meaning you're easy to take
[1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:45.200]  advantage of and when they do take advantage of you they know you're not going to do anything
[1:27:45.200 --> 1:27:49.600]  and canadians are a perfect example of that and they want to make an example of people like me
[1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:54.320]  so canadians won't stand up and they've arrested me multiple times they put such conditions on me
[1:27:54.320 --> 1:27:58.000]  and i'm going to explain to folks you have the highest suicide right now in the world
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  your children are killing themselves this nanny state is vicious and is killing the nanny state
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:09.200]  is way worse than covid itself the the consequences of lockdown like the the raging suicides and
[1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:14.240]  children the overdoses i just came from vittish columbia there's more overdose deaths for people
[1:28:14.240 --> 1:28:19.040]  under 60 than there are covid deaths and we're talking about a pandemic give me a break the real
[1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:24.880]  pandemic the real the real catastrophe is all the unrelated deaths to lockdowns the the the the
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:29.280]  virus didn't close businesses the virus didn't cause suicide the virus didn't cause divorces
[1:28:29.280 --> 1:28:35.280]  overdoses no that's the consequences of government shutdown and it's all planned the government wants
[1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:39.600]  total control so they're using the vaccine passport to take away your rights and freedoms
[1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:42.960]  and they're using the fact that they're closing your businesses and putting you on universal
[1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:47.120]  basic income to control you physically and for the rest of the people that still have a little
[1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:50.640]  property left they're going to be coming for that too and we'll be talking about that in the next
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:54.640]  segment because this has to stop that's right let's talk about the next phase of what they admit
[1:28:54.640 --> 1:29:01.040]  they're going to do it's in all the clauslaw documents i've been on there 27 years and we've
[1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:05.680]  gone through a lot of criticism a lot of attacks but also a lot of amazing support and so that's
[1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:10.720]  why i always take time out to thank you for keeping us on there because without you without the crew
[1:29:10.720 --> 1:29:14.960]  without our sponsors without our affiliates without everybody we would not be on air and the
[1:29:14.960 --> 1:29:19.360]  world would be a different place so it's not a power trip when i realized the great effect
[1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:26.160]  we've had it's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here if you hadn't
[1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:31.120]  have supported us the whole planet would be in a much worse position with the globalist
[1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:35.280]  instead a lot of really really positive things are happening and so many of the corrupt things
[1:29:35.280 --> 1:29:40.000]  the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open and so info wars credibility
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:44.320]  is higher than it's ever been but the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many different
[1:29:44.320 --> 1:29:49.040]  attacks we've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air it's so expensive so please get

[1:33:57.920 --> 1:34:04.000]  okay i'm sitting here and quite a few people listen to the show we're talking about dictatorship
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:08.160]  in canada and i just got sent an interesting text by a very well-known talk show host to
[1:34:08.160 --> 1:34:14.240]  leave it at that saying have you seen this and i said during a little short break i said no that's
[1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:19.200]  incredible and i sent it to the producers to play it and i didn't just believe the clip i went and
[1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:23.600]  did a search and found out that indeed he bragged that he bought the media off we're going to play
[1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:30.480]  in a moment i didn't know he'd said this so i shoot the talk show host household name back the
[1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:36.640]  i'm not bragging this is funny small world i sent him back trudeau saying i want to be a dictator
[1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:43.520]  like china he hadn't seen that so it shows how don't think everybody knows stuff so i see people all
[1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:48.400]  the time going jones you haven't covered this because i didn't know about it i mean this is
[1:34:48.400 --> 1:34:54.240]  so over the top so trudeau admires egp his dad admired the previous communist dictator and wrote
[1:34:54.240 --> 1:34:59.120]  books about how he wanted communism here he is saying he wants it and now he's got his premieres
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:05.200]  over your provinces from from coast to coast like you said you're one of the biggest countries in
[1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:10.720]  the world incredible resources only rivaled by russia way more than the us as and you're being
[1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:16.400]  taken over and people have no defense mechanism in canada because you were a christian society
[1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:21.120]  now you're a globalist society and you said the people are wide open to this but people don't seem
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:25.840]  to understand how much danger the world's in and that canada is just the start that that's where
[1:35:25.840 --> 1:35:30.560]  the globalists had their free hand like you said it's where a supervillain would strike first
[1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:37.200]  exactly and that's exactly what we're seeing and that's why we're seeing it so harshly
[1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:40.960]  there there's a statistic that just got released a couple days ago that our gyms
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:48.880]  have been closed 322 days out of the last 365 days what business can survive being closed
[1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:54.960]  90 of the time over an entire year answer absolutely nothing and that's what they want
[1:35:54.960 --> 1:35:59.840]  they want to crush small business because when you are an independent business owner
[1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:05.120]  you are independent you look after yourself the people that work for you look after themselves
[1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:08.800]  the government serves you as they're supposed to as soon as the government closed your business
[1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:12.960]  puts you out of work puts everybody that worked for you out of work now you rely on universal
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:16.880]  basic income or stimulus checks or whatever the hell they want to call it the government no longer
[1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:21.200]  serves you the government rules you and they can make you do things like take vaccines or do
[1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:25.840]  contact tracing or do force testing and if you disagree you don't get your money and now they're
[1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:29.600]  combining that with the vaccine passport that's going to take away your rights and freedoms
[1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:35.680]  forever so they hope and now you have a system where you have no rights and freedoms and the
[1:36:35.680 --> 1:36:39.920]  government controls you financially so for what's going to happen that means we're going to have
[1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:44.560]  really high taxes rampant inflation and for the rest of the people that still have jobs and still
[1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:48.960]  have property they're coming for them next they already are talking about their government-insured
[1:36:48.960 --> 1:36:54.240]  reverse mortgage program and that's because when inflation and taxes take over all the people that
[1:36:54.240 --> 1:36:59.760]  are at a boom baby boomer age and ready to retire aren't going to have the money left that they need
[1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:03.600]  to live out their life so the government's going to come and say we got a great idea for you
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:07.280]  government insured reverse mortgage we're going to give you thousands of dollars every month for
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:12.000]  the next 10 or 15 years you'll be able to look like kings and queens only problem is when you're done
[1:37:12.560 --> 1:37:17.920]  they own your house so this is the way they're going to recoup all the property it's the biggest
[1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:22.480]  transfer and by the way Claude Schwab has said that he says in the future you will own nothing
[1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:26.480]  you will have nothing and you will like it but then they'll dictate total control over you
[1:37:27.360 --> 1:37:32.000]  exactly their future looks something like this i'll go through it real quick if you're living
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:36.640]  by yourself you're an 150 square foot if you're living with another person you're in 250 square
[1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:42.000]  feet you may or may not have a bathroom in your condo slash prison cell depending on your social
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:47.120]  status you will live in a giant building complex where you will work from you will eat you will
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:52.080]  shop at starbucks get your care cut do your grocery shopping get your clothing so you virtually never
[1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:56.800]  leave if you are going to leave if you have a job where you need to get to you don't have a car
[1:37:56.800 --> 1:38:01.520]  no no no you walk outside you scan the barcode on your wrist and you see if you have enough
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:06.720]  pivotal credits left in your bank account to rent that e-bike that's going to take you the 15 minutes
[1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:11.520]  to get to your job this is the kind of right and if you socially and if you socially go out and
[1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:16.640]  protest to take guns protest the force will be inoculate protest or like sterilize your five
[1:38:16.640 --> 1:38:20.240]  year old son if you're even able to be able to have a child with all the chemicals of food and
[1:38:20.240 --> 1:38:24.960]  water then they'll give you enough credits to be able to buy food but if you don't go out and
[1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:29.680]  behave the way they want you won't that's the social credit score that's exactly right you go
[1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:33.600]  on a show like this you take a picture with someone like you or me or social credit score drops now
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:37.280]  all of a sudden you can't travel internationally then you do something else they don't like now
[1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:40.640]  all of a sudden you can't work you do something else you can't they don't like now you can't even
[1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:44.320]  access your digital wallet we're talking about a world where you won't even be able to sell your
[1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:49.840]  used shoes on friggin ebay without the government knowing having to take their having to give you
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:54.400]  permission tracking tracing and taking their piece of the pie they're going to control every
[1:38:54.400 --> 1:38:58.800]  aspect of your life from cradle to grave and they're setting it all up with this covid virus
[1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:03.760]  and that's why they do not want people reading my book because it exposes all of that everything
[1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:08.160]  it exposes their lives it makes people ask questions and when we can spark an international
[1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:12.160]  conversation at the highest levels of government we can expose these people we can hold them
[1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:16.720]  accountable and we can make sure that we restructure society in a way that it benefits
[1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:21.280]  everybody not just those people at the top and we make such examples of them that this
[1:39:21.280 --> 1:39:25.920]  never happens again exactly this great reset could be the real reset over the globalist
[1:39:25.920 --> 1:39:30.240]  because they've stolen the planet they've created thousands of trillions of dollars
[1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:34.720]  of fake derivatives now they want to reset it and act like they're the saviors and tell us the
[1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:39.600]  collapse is because of covid when the collapse was them ordering the shutdown with the whole third
[1:39:39.600 --> 1:39:44.400]  world starving to death now being organized as political weapons against the west now here's
[1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:49.840]  the new clip i hadn't seen this is trudeau last year he gave six hundred million dollars to the
[1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:57.440]  media and he openly makes jokes about taxpayer funded media here it is now you sometimes hear
[1:39:57.440 --> 1:40:02.640]  about liberal bias in the media these days how they're constantly letting off our government
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:10.480]  letting our government off the hook for no good reason frankly i think that's insulting it's clear
[1:40:10.480 --> 1:40:16.080]  that they let us off the hook for a very good reason because we paid them six hundred million
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:22.560]  dollars that's not edited he goes on that's the sick joke that's the rubbing it in
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:27.600]  yeah of course they're making they make jokes about it to us now they're like they don't even hide
[1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:31.200]  what they're doing anymore and by the way when he proposed what he started doing about a year
[1:40:31.200 --> 1:40:36.560]  and a half ago now the new york times is proposing a bailout to the media and biden's talking about
[1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:42.400]  paying media paying the corporate media paying them of course well guess well our our government's
[1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:47.360]  so corrupt they just voted to suspend all elections until they decide covet is over did you hear about
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:53.200]  that i did i guess tell us about that suspending elections announcing martial law saying trudeau
[1:40:53.200 --> 1:40:58.480]  wants to be a dictator say he wants to be a dictator he wants to install a vaccine passport
[1:40:58.480 --> 1:41:03.440]  he's suspended elections he's putting checkpoints between provinces he's having governments issue
[1:41:03.440 --> 1:41:09.120]  arrest warrants for people for things they haven't even done yet and this is literally every dystopian
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:14.880]  movie and novel rolled into one and just thrown at our doorstep i was in vancouver and at a best
[1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:21.440]  shelter i saw a an advertisement telling you that you're selfish if you have more than one child in
[1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:28.000]  canada this is the great reset new world order depopulation operation the new york times are
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:33.440]  an article saying white women having a white boyfriend is racist and that they're terrorist and
[1:41:33.440 --> 1:41:38.080]  it's not a joke article and the new article is not written by all these white professors saying get
[1:41:38.080 --> 1:41:43.680]  rid of white people i mean this is just this is insane it's beyond insane and it's not getting
[1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:47.920]  any better like look at me i'm in a i'm in a truck right now doing the show with you because i was
[1:41:47.920 --> 1:41:51.760]  in a i was in a rally right before this and the police showed up to try to give me a hassle and
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:57.040]  we had to literally just take off jump in a car set up a hot spot and here we are this is how i'm
[1:41:57.040 --> 1:42:01.520]  living right now i live from place to place you are literally an information warfare gorilla
[1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:08.160]  on the run like you are paul revere brother i can't even get home i have to drive through
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:12.320]  manitoba to get home and that's the province where i have a warrant for in my arrest for
[1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:16.160]  something that i never even did i have a warrant for my arrest for going to a rally on friday
[1:42:16.160 --> 1:42:21.920]  that i never went to so hopefully they're smart enough because they're saying assembly is illegal
[1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:26.320]  unless you're walmart or unless you're an airport i mean this is the total excuse for control and
[1:42:26.320 --> 1:42:32.320]  it's all over the western world now it's all over the western world and in canada a lot of people
[1:42:32.320 --> 1:42:36.160]  are actually asking for but before we go to the last commercial i gotta say the west coast of
[1:42:36.160 --> 1:42:40.560]  canada really did what i asked them to i said that we needed to organize small businesses to open by
[1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:46.000]  may 24th and when i went there on may 23rd 2000 businesses in british columbia had signed on to
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:51.120]  the other segment let's talk about action don't hang up the absolutely christ sky hold your horses
[1:42:51.120 --> 1:42:59.920]  literally we'll be right back we're gonna talk about solutions a lot of virtue signalers out there
[1:42:59.920 --> 1:43:04.160]  will tell you how much they care about troops and how much they care about veterans but at the same
[1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:09.680]  time they won't stand up for what those veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250
[1:43:09.680 --> 1:43:15.520]  years of us history and now more than ever what our republic stands for and it stood for is under
[1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:21.840]  attack america is under globalist takeover it's an information war it is an economic war but most
[1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:28.640]  importantly it is a spiritual war and now of course it's a biological and chemical war
[1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:33.200]  with the vaccines we were the first to tell you that the virus came out of wuhan we were the first
[1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:38.160]  to tell you the vaccine passports were coming we were the first to lay out basically everything
[1:43:38.160 --> 1:43:41.840]  because we actually do our research know what we're talking about and that's why it's important to
[1:43:41.840 --> 1:43:46.320]  keep in fours in the air now more than ever and for Memorial Day week we're having store-wide

[1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:43.200]  as being veterans of the info war and i particularly think our veterans as well that have served the
[1:45:43.200 --> 1:45:48.400]  armed forces because they understand what it is to sacrifice and they're needed more now than ever
[1:45:48.400 --> 1:45:52.880]  to be leaders in our republic to expose the globalism of foreign takeover that we're in the middle
[1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:56.400]  of right now so it's a very historical time to be alive i want to thank you all for your support

[1:46:04.480 --> 1:46:28.640]  you

[1:47:21.040 --> 1:47:33.880]  I'm Alex Jones your host final segment ahead of two hours of more live radio
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:38.720]  slash TV with Owen shroyer and Sunday live which we've cut the ads in half for
[1:47:38.720 --> 1:47:41.760]  that we only have local ads for local stations we've cut our network ads on
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:47.600]  that show a lot of stations are picking it up again Chris Guy is a modern Paul
[1:47:47.600 --> 1:47:51.840]  Revere I follow what he does he has been arrested harassed they have been after
[1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:55.680]  him because he's eloquent he's well spoken he predicted it all he is a
[1:47:55.680 --> 1:48:00.160]  leader and he's getting other leaders to take action they try to stop him he had
[1:48:00.160 --> 1:48:03.600]  to helicopter into his last place he had to change clothes three times from
[1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:07.840]  trying to arrest him they've got warrants out for him all over for speaking and
[1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:12.080]  they're arresting preachers all over the once free country of Canada I mean we
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:16.040]  live basically next order North Korea but everyone's behaving so nicely under
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:21.200]  it Chris guy I'm really worried about Canada at least there was a lot of
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:26.240]  anger at Ford when he announced official martial law we already played Trudeau
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:33.160]  laughing about buying off the media here is your leader Trudeau talking about
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:37.680]  dictatorship admiring the G.G. Ping here it is
[1:48:38.520 --> 1:48:44.480]  meeting last week with a group of Toronto women was an example even with
[1:48:44.480 --> 1:48:49.400]  Sun TV watching for any slip he was asked which country he most admired and
[1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:58.560]  referred to China level of admiration I actually have for China because their
[1:48:58.560 --> 1:49:04.640]  basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a
[1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:08.480]  dime and say we need to go green as fast as we need to start you know investing
[1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:12.320]  in solar China doesn't do any of that there's a dirty
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:16.560]  issue the worst we do all that and we can't operate and and what did what did
[1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:20.400]  Biden just say oh China's gonna take over because they're a dictatorship you
[1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:23.920]  got to do what I say we got to be able to make decisions quick you notice all
[1:49:23.920 --> 1:49:27.680]  the women were winking at each other getting excited they've signed on to
[1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:32.880]  dictatorship the left does what they're told when they told there's two papers
[1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:38.440]  in Austin every magazine I saw said what to do once we reopen and it was on
[1:49:38.440 --> 1:49:42.480]  every magazine cover in our country it's it's centralized control folks it's
[1:49:42.480 --> 1:49:47.200]  dangerous it's evil it's bad and it's saying you're not essential if you're
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:51.240]  not a corporate operative and you're gonna live in a compact coffin apartment
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:55.840]  this isn't coming Chris guy it's here brother hundred percent the long list
[1:49:55.840 --> 1:50:00.240]  this is crazy and speaking of Doug Ford I have to be careful what I say cuz I
[1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:03.320]  don't know if you saw but I was front-page news all over Canada and all
[1:50:03.320 --> 1:50:06.520]  the mainstream media because apparently I made death threats against him and all
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:09.400]  the other premiers and then I apparently tried to assault the police
[1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:14.200]  officer and I thought other bullshit all false allegations that were started by
[1:50:14.200 --> 1:50:17.320]  a man I just gotta address this so everybody understands a man by the
[1:50:17.320 --> 1:50:20.760]  name of Rob Carbone who fancies himself the leader of the Republican Party of
[1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:25.080]  Canada representing him the self like a Canadian Donald Trump in reality he's a
[1:50:25.080 --> 1:50:29.520]  con a fraud a liar and I had evidence that he was committing fraud and stealing
[1:50:29.520 --> 1:50:33.000]  money and I had that irrefutable evidence and witnesses that I was about to go
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:36.880]  public with and that's why he called the police and his and the only evidence
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:40.680]  they have of these so-called alleged threats I made was this man calling and
[1:50:40.680 --> 1:50:44.040]  saying that he had a conversation with me and I said it everybody who knows me
[1:50:44.040 --> 1:50:47.840]  know that didn't say that I'm not like that so these are more false allegations
[1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:51.280]  that just gave them more fuel for the fire to the point like where you like
[1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:54.800]  you said now when I go to a rally at the I see the police watching me taking
[1:50:54.800 --> 1:50:57.920]  pictures of me at the end of the rally that have to like swap clothes and walk
[1:50:57.920 --> 1:51:02.280]  away with groups of people just so I don't get grabbed illegally detained for
[1:51:02.280 --> 1:51:06.320]  whatever reason they will look at any excuse to detain me and arrest me and
[1:51:06.320 --> 1:51:09.720]  then they'll try to not give me bail because their their agenda is to try to
[1:51:09.720 --> 1:51:13.200]  lock me up throw away the key and shut me up but all they're doing is turning you
[1:51:13.200 --> 1:51:17.520]  into a folk hero and we got caught up on the break you are the resistance we are
[1:51:17.520 --> 1:51:21.240]  the resistance all the world the resistance explain what you did what
[1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:24.720]  locals did and why some areas are being forced to reopen because the public is
[1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:28.720]  no longer submitting to the year plus martial law let's talk about solutions
[1:51:28.720 --> 1:51:32.560]  while they're after you perfect it was part of my taking action tour which was
[1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:36.400]  phase two of united non-compliance phase one was the global awakening when
[1:51:36.400 --> 1:51:39.840]  people like me and others went around and told the truth and we elevated the
[1:51:39.840 --> 1:51:43.120]  human consciousness and changed the perception to let everybody know that
[1:51:43.120 --> 1:51:46.400]  everything that's happening right now is not about our safety and health but it's
[1:51:46.400 --> 1:51:50.680]  about control and dominance and so phase two of united non-compliance in 2021 we
[1:51:50.680 --> 1:51:54.360]  called taking action and to take action we started breaking down our protest
[1:51:54.360 --> 1:51:57.760]  groups into smaller groups they could take individual actions on the ground
[1:51:57.760 --> 1:52:00.720]  level that'll make a difference and the number one group we created with the
[1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:04.080]  small business owners and British Columbia the west coast of Canada took
[1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:09.080]  this very seriously and by the time I got back there on the 23rd and our opening
[1:52:09.080 --> 1:52:13.840]  date that I we all declared was the 24th over 2,000 businesses had signed on a
[1:52:13.840 --> 1:52:16.800]  declaration that they were gonna open whether the government liked it or not
[1:52:16.800 --> 1:52:23.800]  and guess what may 25th by coincidence I'm sure the government removed a lot of
[1:52:23.800 --> 1:52:28.240]  restrictions they had like in dying in route they had dying in they had all
[1:52:28.240 --> 1:52:31.880]  kinds of things opening up they had all kinds of capacity limits removed and
[1:52:31.880 --> 1:52:37.120]  it's because the people took action if there was only 20 businesses that signed
[1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:40.200]  on the government wouldn't have done anything except extend the lockdown
[1:52:40.200 --> 1:52:44.040]  because thousands of thousands of selectively targeted does when the
[1:52:44.040 --> 1:52:48.040]  churches of Canada see 50 churches closed they should all open they should
[1:52:48.040 --> 1:52:52.000]  have never closed the government saying your religion is not essential so
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:55.640]  everything's open but your churches and your small businesses this is so
[1:52:55.640 --> 1:53:00.680]  predatory this is so obvious this is so ridiculous they're not even hiding
[1:53:00.680 --> 1:53:04.600]  their intentions anymore it's full feathered dominance full feathered you
[1:53:04.600 --> 1:53:08.360]  will comply or else and that's why they're breaking every single law
[1:53:08.360 --> 1:53:13.120]  violating every protection they even made it now wow you guys in the states
[1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:17.080]  your your Red Cross will not allow blood donations from people who have been
[1:53:17.080 --> 1:53:21.960]  given the COVID vaccine for good reason in Canada Canadian blood services
[1:53:21.960 --> 1:53:26.640]  will not only allow it they're just fine with it this is like a double standard
[1:53:26.640 --> 1:53:30.120]  when you guys banned the AstraZeneca vaccine Trudeau was trying to buy it
[1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:33.320]  from you guys at a discount so he can still inject Canadian and let's remind
[1:53:33.320 --> 1:53:36.720]  people a lot of these vaccines are banned in major countries we never hear
[1:53:36.720 --> 1:53:40.200]  that because the media is so damn controlled and then you are medical
[1:53:40.200 --> 1:53:43.400]  doctors or scientists they get censored you know that Facebook thing about how
[1:53:43.400 --> 1:53:49.080]  medical doctors and Senate hearings and hearings in Texas and Florida who are
[1:53:49.080 --> 1:53:55.720]  banned under Facebook orders that's doctors in legislative hearings big tech
[1:53:55.720 --> 1:53:59.760]  saying we can't hear that they're banning members of the Australian
[1:53:59.760 --> 1:54:03.920]  Parliament that criticize it off Facebook this is a power grab Facebook is
[1:54:03.920 --> 1:54:08.680]  heavily invested so is Google in Big Pharma and I mean it Congress must act
[1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:14.560]  I'm telling you though I typed in Trudeau dictatorship I didn't know that even
[1:54:14.560 --> 1:54:18.120]  the Huffington Post said that there was a plan for him to basically become a
[1:54:18.120 --> 1:54:21.760]  dictator and he wants to be a dictator so I guess this is an actual plan the
[1:54:21.760 --> 1:54:27.120]  Labor Party up there well it is he is a dictator like they're all dictators Doug
[1:54:27.120 --> 1:54:30.680]  Ford like you said he put in that plan that was basically martial law but with
[1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:33.960]  the government still in control he wanted us we're still under a stay-at-home
[1:54:33.960 --> 1:54:37.880]  order in Ontario we're not supposed to leave our houses for any reason except
[1:54:37.880 --> 1:54:43.400]  medical or essential until June 16th and that's been since frigging November then
[1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:46.680]  they made the checkpoints interprovincial and they announced that they were
[1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:50.720]  going to make checkpoints within different regions of the province and give
[1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:55.880]  police power to pull over any vehicle and ask them where they were going it was
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:55:00.720]  the police that said no finally and it was the police that finally said no so
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:05.600]  he came out and apologized it's incredible let's hit this explain the
[1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:10.360]  listeners though whether all over the US they need to know this is coming back
[1:55:10.360 --> 1:55:15.160]  this is a UN directive so people have to realize what's happening to Canada is a
[1:55:15.160 --> 1:55:19.560]  beta test for us we are all gonna be Canadians very very soon how do you see
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:24.520]  them rolling it back out in the West as they promise to do you guys have no
[1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:28.440]  idea what's coming if you know what this year is this is the 50th year for the
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:33.440]  US currency no fiat currency has ever lasted longer than 50 years they're
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:37.040]  actually running bets in Vegas right now on which month the US dollar is gonna
[1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:40.640]  collapse and all of this is gonna all this COVID and all this stuff and all
[1:55:40.640 --> 1:55:44.280]  this part of the great reset is a part of the dollar collapse you're gonna see a
[1:55:44.280 --> 1:55:47.840]  huge devaluation of the US dollars sometime around the middle of summer
[1:55:47.840 --> 1:55:50.880]  you're gonna see supply chain disruptions you're gonna see all the same
[1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:54.200]  type of stuff that's happening here in the States I've already applied for a
[1:55:54.200 --> 1:55:57.200]  waiver to make sure I have no problems going to the states because I know I'm
[1:55:57.200 --> 1:56:00.360]  gonna have to take this tour over there and I know that this is a problem that
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:04.000]  can't be fixed by just one kind of just announced they're worried of bubbles
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:07.640]  about the break and that the dollars to the dime you show your sophistication it
[1:56:07.640 --> 1:56:12.640]  was back in 63 that they re monetize the US debt they did it previously we've
[1:56:12.640 --> 1:56:16.240]  had the US dollar for 200 plus years but it's always being re monetized and
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:20.000]  changed you're right they're moving for a new Bretton Woods and a new global
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:24.240]  currency right now and they need COVID collapse as the cover for what they call
[1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:28.440]  a global Marshall plan where the central banks put us all into deeper debt but
[1:56:28.440 --> 1:56:31.800]  make a sign our rights over and claus Schwab says we'll all have a global ID
[1:56:31.800 --> 1:56:36.560]  and implantable microchip on French TV that's pretty much what they want to do
[1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:40.160]  they want to use debt to create a situation of a crisis where then they
[1:56:40.160 --> 1:56:44.160]  can then use a world currency which will most likely be a digital currency and
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:47.480]  it's just like what we said it's when we talk about a one-world government
[1:56:47.480 --> 1:56:52.120]  takeover we're not talking about one supernatural government with one world
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:55.480]  leader that's gonna take over the entire world no we're still gonna have our own
[1:56:55.480 --> 1:56:58.480]  countries our own governments their own leaders but they're gonna follow a
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:01.880]  universal directive like we've seen with COVID and they're gonna follow that
[1:57:01.880 --> 1:57:05.560]  universal directive with all the laws when it comes to current and that's the
[1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:09.320]  plan you're gonna be giving us daily updates on the war room on the all
[1:57:09.320 --> 1:57:13.760]  shown show and on American journals 8 a.m. weekdays you're gonna be popping in

[1:57:37.240 --> 1:57:41.600]  all right Owen Shroyer is about to take over speak of funding free shipping
[1:57:41.600 --> 1:57:44.480]  store wire from Memorial Day double paid three points biggest sell the year
[1:57:44.480 --> 1:57:48.680]  info or store that's how we fund this operation thank you I've been on there
[1:57:48.680 --> 1:57:53.560]  27 years and we've gone through a lot of criticism a lot of attacks but also a
[1:57:53.560 --> 1:57:58.280]  lot of amazing support and so that's why I always take time out to thank you for
[1:57:58.280 --> 1:58:01.800]  keeping us on there because without you without the crew without our sponsors
[1:58:01.800 --> 1:58:05.320]  without our affiliates without everybody we would not be on air and the world
[1:58:05.320 --> 1:58:08.900]  would be a different place so it's not a power trip when I realized the great
[1:58:08.900 --> 1:58:15.160]  effect we've had it's really counting the cost and in realizing that if we
[1:58:15.160 --> 1:58:19.060]  weren't here if you hadn't supported us the whole planet would be in a much
[1:58:19.060 --> 1:58:22.880]  worse position with the globalist instead a lot of really really positive
[1:58:22.880 --> 1:58:26.160]  things are happening and so many of the corrupt things the globalist have been
[1:58:26.160 --> 1:58:30.240]  involved in are now coming out in the open and so info or credibility is
[1:58:30.240 --> 1:58:34.240]  higher than it's ever been but the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many
[1:58:34.240 --> 1:58:37.360]  different attacks we've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air it's
[1:58:37.360 --> 1:58:41.320]  so expensive so please get great products and keep info wars on the air at
[1:58:41.320 --> 1:58:45.440]  the same time at info or store.com in fact for the week of Memorial Day we
[1:58:45.440 --> 1:58:49.480]  have short free shipping and double Patriot points I share with you the

[1:58:57.880 --> 1:59:02.520]  make all this possible so in short the world's awakening to spiral the
[1:59:02.520 --> 1:59:06.640]  censorship info wars has never been more influential and has never had a bigger
[1:59:06.640 --> 1:59:11.840]  effect exposing the global agenda and fighting it but that said the COVID
[1:59:11.840 --> 1:59:16.000]  lockdowns the shutdown of supply chains has almost shut us down because most of
